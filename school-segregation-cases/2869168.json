This case began when appellants\nJohn and Mary Doe, an interracial couple with an HIV -\npositive son named Adam,1 appr oached Centre County's\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Names have been changed to preserve confidentiality.\n\n                                 3\n\fFoster Child Program, seeking to become foster parents.\nCounty officials responded by adopting a policy providing\nthat foster families whose members have \"serious infectious\ndiseases\" may care only for children with the same disease.\nThe policy would permit the Does to car e for uninfected\nchildren only if the Does agreed to r elease information\nregarding their son and the biological par ents executed a\nwritten consent releasing the County fr om potential\nliability. The Does refused to agree to the policy and filed\nsuit, alleging disability discrimination in violation of, among\nother statutes, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\nand Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and racial\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964. The Does sought invalidation of the policy,\napproval as foster parents, and compensatory and punitive\ndamages. The District Court granted summary judgment to\nthe County on the disability discrimination claims,\nreasoning that the policy was justified under the ADA's\ndirect threat exception since foster children placed with the\nDoes could sexually assault Adam and contract HIV .\n\nBecause we believe that a reasonable fact finder could\nfind that placement of at least some foster childr en in the\nDoes' home would not entail a significant risk of harm, we\nwill reverse. Furthermore, we will r everse the District\nCourt's judgment that none of the Does' racial\ndiscrimination claims are ripe for adjudication. However, we\nwill affirm the District Court's decision that the individual\nCounty officials are entitled to qualified immunity. We will\nalso affirm the District Court's holding that county\ngovernment entities are immune fr om punitive damages.\n\nI.\n\nThe appellants, John Doe, a 51 year old African-\nAmerican man, and Mary Doe, a 52 year old Caucasian\nwoman, are married, and live in State College, Centre\nCounty, Pennsylvania, with their two adopted sons, Adam,\n11 years old, and Steven, 12.\n\nOver the years, Mary has dedicated herself to the care of\nfoster children with special needs. From 1972 to 1989, she\ncared for 8 foster children and eventually adopted 7 of\n\n                                4\n\fthem. Adam and Steven, who came to Mary as infants, were\nthe last two children she adopted. Adam came to Mary with\nHIV and AIDS, which he contracted from his birth mother.\nAnother of Mary's adopted sons was blind, retar ded and\nhad cerebral palsy. Others had been physically and\nsexually abused. Her efforts have earned her several\nawards, including Foster Parent of the Y ear by the New\nYork State Foster Parents' Association.\n\nOvercoming a troubled youth and time in prison, John\nearned a college degree and became active in church and\ncommunity affairs. He has served as a pr ogram worker in\nresidential group homes for persons with mental\nretardation and is currently a cab driver. He had no\nchildren of his own, but upon marrying Mary, he accepted\nher children, including Adam, into his home.\n\nAIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndr ome) is the last\nstage of progression of the HIV virus (Human\nImmunodeficiency Virus). HIV infects and destroys specific\nwhite blood cells, known as T lymphocytes, that support\nthe body's immune system. As the virus progr esses,\ninfected persons become more and more susceptible to\nopportunistic infections and diseases, and, although\npersons with HIV can live for years, the virus has no cure.\nSee generally Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 633-37\n(1998) (describing the course of HIV and AIDS in detail,\nwith references to medical texts and authorities).\n\nDue to the virus, Adam suffers eating and digestion\nproblems. He receives nourishment thr ough a feeding tube.\nHe has symptoms of autism and permanent lear ning\ndeficits, including difficulties speaking and expressing\nhimself. Unable to care for himself, Adam r elies on his\nparents and others to assist him with eating, cleaning, and\npersonal hygiene.\n\nPrior to 1996, HIV and AIDS severely thr eatened Adam's\nhealth. His eating and digestive problems wer e far more\nsevere, and he weighed only 37 pounds at the age of six in\nMarch 1996. At that time, doctors began aggr essive drug\ntherapy that has suppressed Adam's HIV viral load to\nundetectable levels.2 Today, despite his physical limitations,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Viral load refers to the level of virus in an HIV-positive person's\nblood.\n\n                               5\n\fAdam has good overall health, and suffers no greater risk\nof opportunistic infection than a child without HIV .\n\nAdam attends school classes for children with special\nneeds. School officials keep his HIV-positive status\nconfidential and do not require disclosure of that status to\nparents of HIV-negative students. Adam has not\ntransmitted HIV to his brother, Steven, nor to any children\nwith whom he attends school.\n\nThe probability of HIV transmission from Adam to others\nis a crucial issue in this case. During proceedings, the\nDistrict Court entertained testimony about HIV and AIDS\nfrom two medical experts, Joel H. Hersh, an expert in\nPublic Health Administration, and Robert M. Swenson,\nM.D., a physician and expert in the treatment of infectious\ndiseases. The following discussion proceeds fr om their\ntestimony and related affidavits. See generally Doe v.\nCounty of Centre, 60 F. Supp. 2d 417, 419-26 (M.D. Pa.\n1999) (summarizing portions of the medical evidence)\n[hereinafter Doe I]; Doe v. County of Centre, 80 F. Supp. 2d\n437, 441-44 (M.D. Pa. 2000) (same) [hereinafter Doe II].\n\nHIV is transmitted only through absorption of infected\nblood or sexual secretions into the bloodstr eam or mucous\nmembranes of an uninfected person. Bodily fluids such as\nsweat, tears, or saliva, while containing minute amounts of\nHIV, pose little to no risk of infection, nor does skin contact\nwith HIV-positive blood, unless the skin is br oken or has\nopen wounds. Thus, the chance of HIV transmission fr om\ncasual contact is virtually nonexistent. Nor mal sibling\nfighting and roughhousing present negligible risk of\ntransmission. In fact, Dr. Hersh testified that out of the\n21,000 AIDS cases in Pennsylvania, there ar e no reported\ncases of virus transmission due to familial contact or\nfighting. Even intense physical activities cr eate little risk of\ninfection. For example, Dr. Swenson noted that a study\ninvolving football players found that the risk of HIV\ntransmission was one in every 85 million violent contacts.\n\nThe two primary modes of infection are thr ough the use\nof infected hypodermic needles and thr ough unprotected\nsex. According to Dr. Swenson, the pr obability of HIV\ntransmission through sexual activity varies depending on\n\n                               6\n\fthe activity involved, the specific roles of the infected and\nuninfected persons in the sexual activity, and the viral load\nof the infected person. Certain generalities apply. For\nexample, the lower an HIV-positive person's viral load, the\nlower the transmission risk. In addition, during sexual\nintercourse, HIV is more easily transmitted from an\ninsertive to a receptive partner than fr om a receptive to an\ninsertive partner.\n\nRelying on his professional experience and the prevailing\nmedical research, Dr. Swenson testified as to the\nprobability of transmission in non-consensual male-to-male\nsexual activity. These risk findings rely on medical models\nof disease transmission based on observations of patients,\nrather than on actual controlled tests. Accor ding to Dr.\nSwenson, the probability of transmission to a person with\nHIV who performs oral sex on an infected partner is low,\nabout 1 in 2500 for each occurrence. The pr obability of\ntransmission from a receptive HIV-positive partner to an\ninsertive HIV-negative partner in anal sex is about 1 in\n1666. However, the probability of transmission from an\ninsertive HIV-positive partner to a receptive HIV-negative\npartner under these circumstances is much higher, about\n1 in 120.\n\nThe appellees in this case are Centre County, the Office\nof Children and Youth Services of Centr e County (\"CYS\"),\nand the Board of Commissioners of Centr e County (\"County\nBoard\"), as well as individual CYS officials Terry Watson,\nCarol Smith, and Lisa Rice. We will r efer to the appellees\ncollectively as the \"County.\" Centre County provides a\nfoster care program for children in need of temporary or\npermanent placements outside the homes of their biological\nor custodial families. CYS operates the foster car e program\nand is obligated to follow all applicable federal and\nPennsylvania laws. In particular, CYS operates under a\nstatutory duty to investigate foster parent applicants in\norder to preserve the physical and emotional health of\nfoster children. See, e.g., 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. S 6344(d)\n(requiring foster programs to investigate prospective foster\nparents for criminal activity or child abuse). Both Centre\nCounty and CYS receive federal funds, and the foster care\nprogram receives a portion of these funds.\n\n                               7\n\fTerry Watson is the Director of CYS, and oversees the\nfoster care program. Carol Smith is the Assistant Director\nof CYS, bearing ultimate responsibility and oversight for the\ntraining of foster parents. Lisa Rice is a foster home\nspecialist employed by CYS. She helps select and counsel\nfoster families. Tom Groninger, who is not an appellee in\nthis case, is an employee of CYS who perfor ms home\nstudies for prospective foster parents. According to Carol\nSmith, there are several steps in a foster parent\napplication: (1) an initial phone call; (2) a pr eliminary home\nstudy by Groninger; (3) six weeks of pr e-service training for\nfoster parents; (4) a meeting between the foster parents and\nLisa Rice, and a final assessment; and (5) a meeting\nbetween Rice and Smith to approve or disappr ove the\napplication.\n\nIn January 1998, the Does applied to become foster\nparents under the CYS foster care pr ogram. During the\npreliminary home study, the Does disclosed to Groninger\nthat Adam had HIV and AIDS. Prior to the Does'\napplication, CYS officials had never knowingly placed a\nchild in a foster home where someone had HIV , and\ntherefore had no policy to address the limitations, if any,\napplying to such a home. The County claims that CYS,\nlooking for guidance, investigated the policies of other\ncounties throughout Pennsylvania. CYS officials found\nsome infectious disease policies in other counties, but claim\nthat none addressed the specific situation of placing an\nHIV-negative child in a foster home wher e HIV is present.\n\nAmici curiae, the American Public Health Association and\nothers, challenge the County's claims of investigation, citing\nnumerous policies from other jurisdictions. These policies\ngenerally state that family services agencies should neither\napply blanket prohibitions against placing HIV -positive\nfoster children with HIV-negative childr en, nor segregate\nHIV-positive foster children from HIV-negative children\nwithout analyzing the particular circumstances of each\ncase. See Dep't of Pub. Welfar e, Commonwealth of Pa.,\nChildren, Youth and Families Bulletin: HIV/AIDS Policy 9\n(1989) (unofficial draft policy) (\"HIV positive children should\nnot be segregated in day care facilities, foster homes, group\nhomes, residential placements, or institutions based on\n\n                               8\n\ftheir HIV status alone\"); The Dep't of Servs. for Children,\nYouth and their Families, State of Del., Policy and Procedure\nManual: Communicable Diseases S 103 (IV)(F) (1998)\n(\"Except where the presence or risk of[HIV infection from\na foster child] presents specialized car e needs, the presence\nor risk of [HIV] should not be the mitigating factor in the\nplacement decision\"); N.J. Div. of Youth and Family Servs.,\nField Operations Casework Policy and Procedur es Manual\nS 1502.10 (1999) (when placing HIV-positive foster children,\n\"[s]iblings and children of any age may be placed together\nin the same household, unless a physician advises\notherwise\"); Child Welfare League of Am., Meeting the\nChallenge of HIV Infection in Family Foster Car e 18-22\n(1991); Child Welfare League of Am., Serving HIV-Infected\nChildren, Youth, and their Families: A Guide for Residential\nGroup Care Providers 29-33 (1989).\n\nThe policies cited are not, however, entirely on point,\nsince they apply to the placement of HIV-positive foster\nchildren into foster homes rather than the placement of\nHIV-negative children into foster homes where HIV is\npresent. Having reviewed these polices, we conclude that\nonly the policy of the Philadelphia Department of Human\nServices applies to the present situation. That policy\ndeclares that \"[t]he Department . . . does not discriminate\nin . . . its recruitment or development of kinship caregivers,\nfoster parents, adoptive parents, and contracted providers\non the basis of . . . [their] living or[being] perceived as living\nwith HIV/AIDS.\" See Children and Youth Div., Phila. Dep't\nof Human Servs., Policy Manual SS 1010, 5200 (emphasis\nadded).\n\nAfter its investigation, CYS officials examined the records\nof Centre County's foster care program. They found a\npattern of physical and sexual abuse among foster children:\n\n       As of March 31, 1999, CYS had 125 childr en in\n       placement. Of those children:\n\n       (a) 49% (61 children) had behavioral or emotional\n       problems,\n\n       (b) 24% (30 children) had been victims only of sexual\n       abuse[,]\n\n                               9\n\f       (c) 5% (6 children) were perpetrators only of sexual\n       abuse[,] and\n\n       (d) 7% (9 children) were both victims and perpetrators\n       of sexual abuse.\n\nDoe II, 80 F. Supp. 2d at 441 (inter nal quotations and\ncitation omitted). According to CYS officials, a \"perpetrator,\"\nas used in (c), is a child who has assaulted another child\nsexually, but CYS's definition of \"assault\" includes such\nactivities as fondling and disrobing others.\n\nCYS officials further concluded that, given the emergency\nnature of foster child placement, there was inadequate time\nto assess each foster child for behavioral or emotional\nproblems prior to placement. While able to identify some\nsexual perpetrators, CYS officials found that a number of\nfoster children were not identified as sexual perpetrators\nuntil after foster placement. Especially disturbing were\ndocumented instances of sexual assault by foster children\non other children in foster homes.\n\nMotivated by the concern that a foster child might\nsexually assault Adam, and thereby contract HIV , CYS\nDirector Watson developed the following policy regarding\nthe placement of children when infectious diseases are\npresent:\n\n       C) Placement Of Children With Ser ious Infectious\n       Diseases\n\n       . . . If a child with a serious infectious disease is placed\n       in a foster home, or if there is a family member of the\n       foster family who has a serious infectious disease, only\n       children with the same serious infectious disease will\n       be considered for placement in that home. The only\n       exception to this policy would be for a parent/guardian\n       of a child in the care and custody of C&YS to sign an\n       informed consent for the placement of their non-\n       infected child in such a home. . . . For this exception\n       to occur, the foster parents would have to voluntarily\n       agree to release information to the child's parents that\n       a member of the foster family has been diagnosed with\n       a specific serious infectious disease.\n\n                               10\n\fThe County Board adopted this policy and dir ected CYS to\ncarry out its terms.3\n\nMeanwhile, Lisa Rice informed the Does that Adam's HIV\nmight present a problem for foster par ent approval.\nAccording to plaintiffs' version of events, Rice also alluded\nto racial considerations, telling Yolanda Lollis of the AIDS\nLaw Project in Pennsylvania,4 as well as Mary Doe, that the\nHIV issue was irrelevant since CYS did not have any\nAfrican-American foster children to place with the Does.\nDuring later proceedings, Rice explained that CYS uses\nrace as a factor in placing children because it tries to\nreplicate a foster child's original home envir onment. Racial\ncontinuity minimizes disruption and change in the child's\nlife. Rice also acknowledged the possibility of racial\nanimosity between the interracial foster par ents and\nCaucasian biological or custodial parents.\n\nGiven the HIV controversy, the Does' application stalled\nwithout a formal evaluation of their fitness as foster\nparents. After delay and mutual recriminations, CYS\nofficials sent the Does a formal letter on December 18,\n1998 stating that:\n\n       we are prepared to consider appr oval of you as\n       available foster parents for any HIV-infected child. If\n       you would like to be approved for other childr en, per\n       our policy, you would need to sign a consent allowing\n       CYS to disclose to any child's parents that a member\n       of your family/household is HIV-infected. In turn, the\n       parent must sign an informed consent allowing their\n       child to be placed in your home.\n\nThe Does refused to consent to this arrangement.\n\nOn April 28, 1999, the Does sued Centre County, CYS,\nand the County Board, as well as CYS officials Watson,\nSmith, and Rice, individually and in their official capacities.\nThe Does charged the County with disability discrimination\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. The quoted passage is actually provision IV.C in a policy containing\nnumerous provisions. Nevertheless, for ease we will refer to this\nprovision as the County's policy.\n\n4. Lollis had provided legal advice to the Does in connection with this\ncase.\n\n                               11\n\fin violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act,\n42 U.S.C. SS 12131-34 [hereinafter\"Title II of the ADA\"],\nand Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.S 794;\nracial discrimination in violation of Title VI of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. S 2000d-1-7; and racial and\ndisability discrimination in violation of the equal protection\nguarantees under the United States Constitution, pursuant\nto 42 U.S.C. S 1983. They also filed a motion for injunctive\nrelief. With respect to remedies, the Does sought\ninvalidation of the County's infectious disease policy, their\napproval as foster parents, and compensatory and punitive\ndamages.\n\nOn June 22, 1999, the District Court held a one-day\nhearing on the Does' preliminary injunction motion. It was\nduring this hearing that nearly all of the r ecord in this case\nwas developed.\n\nOn July 12, 1999, the County moved to dismiss the Does'\ncomplaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to\nstate a claim, arguing that: (a) the Policy was valid since\nAdam's AIDS posed a direct and significant threat to foster\nchildren; (b) the Does' racial discrimination claims were\nunripe; (c) the individual defendants were entitled to\nqualified immunity; and (d) punitive damages wer e\nunavailable. Within its motion, the County r eferred to\nmatters outside of the complaint, specifically r elying on\nevidence from the June 22, 1999 preliminary injunction\nhearing.\n\nThe District Court dealt with the preliminary injunction\nmotion and the 12(b)(6) motion in several related steps. By\norder dated August 30, 1999, the District Court denied the\npreliminary injunction motion, finding that the Does failed\nto prove a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits.\nDoe I, 60 F. Supp. 2d at 426. By or der dated October 13,\n1999, the District Court, believing that the evidence from\nthe hearing sufficed to resolve the case, accepted and\nconsidered the County's proffer ed extrinsic evidence.\nFollowing Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b), the Court r easoned that the\ninclusion of extrinsic evidence mandated the conversion of\nthe motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.\nSee generally Hilfirty v. Shipman, 91 F .3d 573, 578 (3d Cir.\n1996) (outlining procedure for conversion). The Court\n\n                               12\n\ftherefore gave the parties 16 days tofile briefs, affidavits,\nand other materials that might be relevant. The Does\nobjected to conversion, arguing that discovery had been\ninadequate. They also argued that, in any case, the Court\nshould deny summary judgment on the available r ecord.\n\nOn February 1, 2000, the District Court granted\nsummary judgment to the County on all claims. Doe II, 80\nF. Supp. 2d 437. It held that Adam's HIV posed a\nsignificant risk to foster children who might sexually\nassault Adam, and that therefore, the dir ect threat\nexception to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act applied,\njustifying discrimination via the infectious disease policy.\nThe District Court also held that the individual CYS officials\nwere entitled to qualified immunity because any right the\nDoes had was not clearly established, and, further , that\nCounty government entities were immune fr om punitive\ndamages. Lastly, the Court found that the Does' racial\ndiscrimination claims were unripe. The Does appealed the\norder granting summary judgment for the County, 5 and we\nhave jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. S 1291.\n\nII.\n\nWe exercise plenary review over the District Court's grant\nof summary judgment, Dowling v. City of Philadelphia, 855\nF.2d 136, 141 (3d Cir. 1988), and we independently apply\nthe same standard applicable to district courts, Olson v.\nGen. Elec. Astrospace, 101 F.3d 947, 951 (3d Cir. 1996)\n(citations omitted). Federal Rule of Civil Pr ocedure 56(c)\ndirects that summary judgment is appropriate \"if the\npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\nthat the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter\nof law.\" In following this directive, a court must take the\nfacts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\nthe Does, and draw all reasonable infer ences in their favor.\nMcCarthy v. Recordex Serv., Inc., 80 F .3d 842, 847 (3d Cir.\n1996).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The Does have not contested the denial of their motion for a\npreliminary injunction.\n\n                               13\n\fIII.\n\nWe first consider the Does' contention that the District\nCourt erred in dismissing their disability discrimination\nclaims brought under Title II of the ADA and Section 504\nof the Rehabilitation Act. As a starting point, the\nprotections found in the ADA and in the Rehabilitation Act\nare interpreted similarly, and, in this case, are identical.\nSee Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 632 (using statutory construction\nto conclude that the Court should \"construe the ADA to\ngrant at least as much protection as pr ovided by the\nregulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act\").\nTherefore, except where necessary, we refer only to Title II\nof the ADA, with the understanding that both statutes are\nimplicated.\n\nTitle II of the ADA provides, in pertinent part, that:\n\n       no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason\n       of such disability, be excluded from participation in or\n       be denied the benefits of the services, pr ograms, or\n       activities of a public entity, or be subjected to\n       discrimination by any such entity.\n\n42 U.S.C. S 12132; see also 29 U.S.C.S 794(a) (Section 504\nof the Rehabilitation Act) (prohibition on disability\ndiscrimination in federal programs). The ADA describes a\ndisability as \"a physical or mental impair ment that\nsubstantially limits one or more of the major life activities\nof [an] individual.\" 42 U.S.C. S 12102(2); see also 29 U.S.C.\n705(20)(B) (same under the Rehabilitation Act). Adam's HIV\nclearly constitutes a disability since it is a physical\nimpairment, 28 C.F.R. S 35.104 (defining \"physical\nimpairment\"), that substantially limits several of Adam's\nmajor life activities, such as talking, walking, and digestion,\n28 C.F.R. S 35.104 (defining \"major life activities\"). See also\n45 C.F.R. S 84.3(j) (defining physical impairment and major\nlife activities under the Rehabilitation Act); Bragdon, 524\nU.S. at 637, 641 (holding that HIV, even in the so-called\nasymptomatic phase, is an impairment which substantially\nlimits the major life activity of reproduction).\n\nThe protections of the ADA extend to \"qualified\nindividuals\" who are discriminated against because of their\nrelationship or association with individuals who have a\n\n                               14\n\fknown disability. 28 C.F.R. 35.130(g); compare 42 U.S.C.\nS 12112(b)(4) (Title I of ADA); H.R. Rep. No. 101-485(III), at\n38 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 461 (Title I\nof ADA) (the ADA \"protects persons who associate with\npersons with disabilities and who are discriminated against\nbecause of that association. This may include family,\nfriends, and persons who provide care for persons with\ndisabilities.\"). As the adoptive parents of Adam, John and\nMary Doe have a close relationship entitling them to\nprotection under the ADA.\n\nCYS's policy requires notification of and consent from the\nbiological or custodial parents of HIV-negative foster\nchildren when placing those children in homes with HIV-\npositive individuals. The policy therefor e treats John and\nMary Doe differently during the foster parent application\nprocess solely on the basis of Adam's HIV and AIDS. As a\nfacial matter, then, the policy constitutes disability\ndiscrimination against the Does under the ADA.\n\nNevertheless, the ADA allows disparate treatment in\ncertain cases. In particular, the ADA r ecognizes that the\ngoal of ending disability discrimination must be balanced\nagainst the health and safety risks that disabilities\nsometimes pose to others. See Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 648-\n49. Thus, the ADA contains a direct thr eat exception, which\nallows discrimination if a disability \"poses a direct threat to\nthe health or safety of others.\" 28 C.F.R. Part 35, App. A at\n483; compare 42 U.S.C. S 12182(b)(3) (Title III of ADA); see\nalso 29 U.S.C. S 705(20)(D) (Rehabilitation Act). A \"direct\nthreat\" exists when there is a \"significant risk to the health\nor safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a\nmodification of polices, practices, or procedures or by the\nprovision of auxiliary aids or services.\" 42 U.S.C.\nS 12182(b)(3) (emphasis added).6 As the Supreme Court has\nstated, the exception can only be invoked wher e a risk is\nsignificant: \"[b]ecause few, if any, activities in life are risk\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. The direct threat exception was a judicially created doctrine first\nannounced in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273,\n287 n.16 (1987). Following that case, Congress amended the disability\ndiscrimination statutes to include the Court's dir ect threat language.\nSee\nBragdon, 524 U.S. at 649.\n\n                               15\n\ffree . . . the ADA do[es] not ask whether a risk exists, but\nwhether it is significant.\" Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 649. Thus,\ncourts and entities deciding whether to exclude the\ndisabled must rely on evidence that \"assess[es] the level of\nrisk\" for the \"question under the statute is one of statistical\nlikelihood.\" Id. at 652.\n\nTo determine the existence of a significant risk, the\nSupreme Court in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline\ndirected courts to make factual findings concerning the\nfollowing four factors:\n\n       (a) the nature of the risk (how the disease is\n       transmitted), (b) the duration of the risk (how long is\n       the carrier infectious), (c) the severity of the risk (what\n       is the potential harm to third parties) and (d) the\n       probabilities the disease will be transmitted and will\n       cause varying degrees of harm.\n\n480 U.S. 273, 288 (1987) (internal quotations and citation\nomitted). These findings must be based on \"medical or\nother objective evidence,\" with special defer ence to the\nviews of public health authorities. Bragdon, 524 U.S. at\n649.\n\nIn the leading Supreme Court case, Bragdon v. Abbott, a\ndentist refused to treat a patient with HIV, believing the\npatient might infect him. Addressing the dentist's\ninvocation of the ADA's direct threat exception, the Court\nconducted a rigorous and individualized inquiry into the\nrisk of HIV transmission from patient to dentist. Id. at 650-\n54 (scrutinizing the details of studies and other cited\nauthorities). Despite the existence of a theor etically possible\nmeans of transmission from patient to dentist, the Court\nremanded the case to \"permit a full exploration of the\nissue\" of risk of transmission given the Court's\"analysis of\nsome of the studies cited by the parties.\" Id. at 655 (dentist\nargued that he might be infected by HIV -positive patient\nthrough airborne blood vapors or thr ough an accidental\ncut). In doing so, the Court did \"not for eclose the possibility\nthat the Court of Appeals [might] reach the same\nconclusion it did earlier\" in holding that ther e was no\nsignificant risk to the dentist. Id.; see Abbott v. Bragdon,\n163 F.3d 87, 90 (1st Cir. 1998) (finding no significant risk\non remand), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1131 (1999).\n\n                                16\n\fThe disposition in Bragdon follows fr om Congress' intent\nthat the ADA's prohibitions on disability discrimination\nrequire an individualized determination as to the\nsignificance of risk underlying the direct threat exception,\nboth by entities evaluating disabilities and by courts\njudging the actions of those entities:\n\n       A person with a disability must not be excluded . . .\n       based on stereotypes or fear. Nor may a decision be\n       based on speculation about the risk or harm to others.\n       Decisions are not permitted to be based on\n       generalizations about the disability but rather must be\n       based on the facts of an individual case. . . The purpose\n       of creating the `direct thr eat' standard is to eliminate\n       exclusions which are not based on objective evidence\n       about the individual involved.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485(III), at 45 (1990), r eprinted in 1990\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 468 (emphasis added); see also Holiday\nv. City of Chattanooga, 206 F.3d 637, 643 (6th Cir. 2000)\n(holding that a district court erred in accepting a\nphysician's report about the abilities of an HIV-positive\npolice officer applicant where \"ther e [was] no indication that\nthe physician conducted the individualized inquiry\nmandated by the ADA\"); Taylor v. Pathmark Stores, Inc.,\n177 F.3d 180, 192-93 (3d Cir. 1999) (employers must make\nindividualized determinations about the disabilities of\nemployees); Doe v. Dekalb County Sch. Dist., 145 F.3d\n1441, 1446 (11th Cir. 1998) (the Supr eme Court \"insist[s]\nthat district courts undertake `individualized inquiry' in\neach case\" regarding the significance of risk).\n\nIn ruling against the Does' disability discrimination\nclaims, the District Court accepted the County's ar gument\nthat Adam's HIV posed a significant risk to foster children\nplaced in the Does' home. The direct thr eat exception\ntherefore applied, justifying the County's policy. While\nacknowledging that the probability of transmission might\nbe low during a specific sexual act, the Court stated that it\nwas \"unaware of any way of assuring that contact between\n[Adam and a foster child] will be indeed casual,\" and that\nif not casual, there would be a chance that HIV -\ntransmitting sexual intercourse might take place. Doe II, 80\n\n                               17\n\fF. Supp. 2d at 443 (internal quotations and citation\nomitted).\n\nIn an effort to follow Arline and Bragdon, the District\nCourt based its significance of risk conclusion on four\nfindings of fact. As to the nature of the risk, it found that\n\"the HIV virus has been proven to be transmitted through\nsexual intercourse (homosexual or heter osexual),\nintravenous drug use, and transfusion of blood and blood\nproducts.\" Doe I, 60 F. Supp. 2d at 428. As to the duration\nof the risk, it found that \"AIDS is a ter minal disease for\nwhich there is no cure. . . . [T]he risk [is] present until the\ncarrier succumbs to the disease.\" Id. W ith respect to the\nseverity of the risk, it found that \"[t]he harm to third\nparties is life-threatening.\" Id. W e agree that there is no\ngenuine dispute regarding these findings.\n\nMost of the tension in this case, however, surrounds the\nfourth and final factor -- the probability of transmission. As\nto this factor, the District Court agr eed with the County,\nand found \"a high probability that [HIV] will be transmitted\n[through sexual contact] to childr en placed in foster care\nwith the Does.\" Id. at 428. With r espect to this factor, we\ncannot agree with the District Court because we conclude\nthat there is definitely a genuine dispute of fact. It is\nobvious from the record that Adam's physical limitations\nprevent him from being a sexual aggr essor. The District\nCourt must have derived its conclusion regar ding the\nprobability of transmission from the possibility of a sexual\nmisdeed by a foster child, reasoning that: (1) given the data\nprovided by CYS officials, CYS foster childr en have a high\npropensity to sexually abuse other childr en, see Doe II, 80\nF. Supp. 2d at 441; and (2) according to testimony by Carol\nSmith, \"CYS cannot identify with any certainty at the time\nof placement which of its foster children will engage in\nassaultive behavior or those children who will be sexual\nperpetrators,\" id. at 442 (internal quotations and citation\nomitted).\n\nWe believe that the reasoning the County and the District\nCourt employed is contrary to Congress' intent that\nanalysis of the ADA's direct threat exception should involve\nan individualized inquiry into the significance of the threat\nposed. See Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 649. In concluding that\n\n                               18\n\fCYS foster children have a high propensity for sexual\nabuse, the District Court relied on a bland and generalized\nset of statistics, lacking in individual specificity. These\nstatistics reveal that 12% of the foster childr en have had\nhistories of perpetrating some form of \"sexual abuse,\" but\nthe statistics broadly define \"sexual abuse\" to include\nactivities such as fondling and disrobing that carry no risk\nof transmitting HIV. Does II, 80 F . Supp. 2d at 441. More\nimportant, the statistics do not indicate how many children\ncan be readily identified as being unable or unlikely to\nengage in high-risk behavior.\n\nThe following example illustrates this point. The Does\nhave stated a preference for foster childr en under the age of\n12. Foster children of tender age -- i.e., infants and\nchildren who have not reached puberty-- are extremely\nunlikely to commit forcible sexual inter course leading to the\ntransmission of HIV.7 Mor eover, as noted there is no\nevidence indicating that Adam is at all likely to commit\nsuch an assault, and much evidence suggesting that this is\nmost unlikely. Thus, we believe that the probability of HIV\ntransmission from Adam to a tender-aged child placed in\nthe Does' home appears to be insignificant. Mor eover,\ncontrary to Carol Smith's testimony, such children are\nprecisely the type of children whom CYS can identify as\nunlikely perpetrators of HIV-transmitting sexual assault.\n\nThe County argues that even though the pr obability of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. We use \"tender age\" only as helpful terminology for defining a range\nof sexual development. In doing so, we are not drawing on any legal\ndefinition of tender years or age, but rather on the practical physical\nlimits of pre-pubescent children. In fact, we note that the definition of\nthe phrase \"children of tender years\" has varied in social and legal\ncontexts, with little direct connection to sexual development. See, e.g.,\nBlack's Law Dictionary 1480 (7th ed. 1999) (in family law, the tender\nyears doctrine provides \"that custody of very young children (usu[ally]\nfive years of age and younger) should generally be awarded to the mother\nin a divorce unless she is found to be unfit\"); Robert G. Marks, Note,\nShould We Believe the People Who Believe the Children?: The Need for a\nNew Sexual Abuse Tender Years Hearsay Exception Statute, 32 Harv. J.\non Legis. 207, 245-46 (1995) (noting that all states limit their tender\nyears statutes to children below a certain age, and arguing that some of\nthe age limits are too low).\n\n                               19\n\ftransmission is negligible, a generalized policy is justified\nwhere a disability, such as HIV, is deadly and has no cure,\nbecause the loss of even one life is too great a cost in\npursuit of the ADA's honorable goals. Admittedly, when\nfacing the life-threatening consequences of HIV , some\nfederal appellate courts have held that any amount of risk\nthrough a \"specific and theoretically sound means of\ntransmission\" constitutes a significant risk, allowing\ninvocation of the direct threat exception. Onishea v. Hopper,\n171 F.3d 1289, 1297-99 (11th Cir. 1999) (allowing\nsegregation of HIV-positive prisoners), cert. denied, 528 U.S.\n1114 (2000); see also Estate of Mauro v. Borgess Med. Ctr.,\n137 F.3d 398, 405, 407 (6th Cir. 1998) (affirming summary\njudgment against HIV-positive surgical technician even\nthough Centers for Disease Control calculated odds of\ntransmission during a surgery as between 1 in 42,000 and\n1 in 420,000); Doe v. Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp., 50 F.3d\n1261, 1265-66 (4th Cir. 1995) (affir ming summary\njudgment against HIV-positive physician wher e the risk of\ntransmission was \"minimal but nevertheless\nascertainable\"); Bradley v. Univ. of T ex. M.D. Anderson\nCancer Ctr., 3 F.3d 922, 924 (5th Cir. 1993) (per curiam)\n(affirming summary judgment in favor of hospital that\nrefused to permit an HIV-positive surgical assistant to\nassist surgeries, even though risk was \"small\").\n\nOther appellate courts have endorsed a more exacting\nstandard, requiring some actual risk of transmission\nincluding documented cases. See Abbott, 163 F.3d at 90\n(finding that plaintiff HIV-positive dental patient produced\nsufficient evidence that there would be no significant threat\nto dentist from treatment); Chalk v. United States Dist.\nCourt Cent. Dist. of Cal., 840 F.2d 701, 707-09, 712 (9th\nCir. 1988) (directing entry of pr eliminary injunction\nprohibiting school from transferring teacher with HIV from\nclassroom because uncertain and theoretical possibility of\nHIV transmission to students did not present significant\nrisk, despite district court's characterization of the potential\nharm as \"catastrophic\").\n\nWe need not decide the merits of these two positions\nsince, even under the more cautious rule, a r easonable fact\nfinder could find that there is no \"specific and theoretically\n\n                               20\n\fsound means of [HIV] . . . transmission\" fr om Adam to a\ntender-aged foster child. Onishea, 171 F.3d at 1297. In\nlight of the objective medical evidence in the r ecord, a\nreasonable fact finder could easily find that the risk of a\nlittle boy or girl contracting HIV from Adam by forcing him\nto engage in high-risk behavior is the type of r emote and\nspeculative risk that is insufficient for a finding of\nsignificant risk, and insufficient for the invocation of the\ndirect threat exception. See Bragdon , 524 U.S. at 649 (in\nassessing whether patient with HIV presented a significant\nrisk to dentist, \"Arline and the ADA do not ask whether a\nrisk exists, but [rather] whether it is significant\"); see also\nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485(II), at 56 (1990), r eprinted in 1990\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 338 (Title I of ADA) (noting that a\n\"speculative or remote risk\" is insufficient to support a\nfinding of a \"significant risk\"), H.R. Rep. No. 101-485(III), at\n46 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 469 (Title I\nof ADA) (\"The plaintiff is not requir ed to prove that he or\nshe poses no risk\").\n\nIts original sexual assault justification faltering, the\nCounty turns to another, contending that physical\nroughhousing or fighting between Adam and a foster child\nof tender age could still lead to the transmission of HIV. We\nreject this contention. Even if we accept the less than\nobvious proposition that a young child or infant could\nphysically assault Adam, a reasonable factfinder could\nfind, based on the objective medical evidence in the record,\nthat the risk of HIV transmission from casual contact, even\nintense physical contact, is negligible.\n\nFurthermore, the County's sexual assault and physical\nviolence arguments lose all force in the case of a foster\nchild who is so disabled that he or she is simply incapable\nof committing sexual or physical assault.8 In such a\nsituation, the County's blanket policy discriminates against\nthe Does because of Adam's HIV positive status even\nthough the probability of HIV transmission, and\nconsequently the risk, is next to zero.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. We believe there are such handicapped foster children. After all, the\nrecord demonstrates that Adam himself was a physically disabled foster\nchild before being adopted by the Does.\n\n                               21\n\fIn sum, the record is insufficient to support the grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of the County, because a\nreasonable fact finder could not find, based on the\nsummary judgment record, that an individual with HIV\nwould always pose a significant risk to a foster child placed\nby the County in that individual's home. This generalization\nfails to address, for example, the placement of tender-aged\nand disabled foster children. The County ther efore failed to\nconduct the ADA-mandated individualized deter mination,\nand the District Court erred in concluding that the ADA's\ndirect threat exception applied.\n\nIn addition to its significance of risk ar guments under\nArline and Bragdon, the County has pr esented several other\njustifications for the policy. First, and most persuasively,\nthe County argues that the direct thr eat test in Arline and\nBragdon developed in the context of HIV-positive persons\nrightfully demanding inclusion into the public spher e and\ninto public life. See, e.g., Abbott, 163 F.3d at 90 (holding\nthat HIV-positive dental patient was entitled to dental\ntreatment); Chalk, 840 F.2d at 708-09, 712 (9th Cir. 1988)\n(holding that school could not transfer teacher with HIV\nfrom classroom). The present case, by contrast, involves an\nHIV-positive family requesting the placement of a non-HIV\npositive child into their private home. The County argues\nthat this is a novel situation, demanding mor e stringent\nstandards since the threat posed in a private home is much\ngreater.\n\nWe have found no authority on this issue. W e\nacknowledge the intuitive difference between inclusion into\nthe public sphere and placement in a private home. A\nprivate home is much more difficult to monitor and involves\nmore intimate contact than would ordinarily take place in\nthe public sphere, such as at a school or within a hospital.\nFurther, as compared to the HIV-positive person seeking\ninclusion, the HIV-negative child and his or her guardians\nlack choice in the foster placement process. In addition,\nentities responsible for foster placement, such as the\nCounty, normally have an independent statutory directive\nto ensure that the placement of children is safe. See, e.g.,\n23 Pa. Cons. Stat. S 6344. Nevertheless, the differences\nsuggested, while possibly significant in some cases, cannot\n\n                               22\n\fjustify the type of blanket policy implemented her e. Simply\nput, the distinction between the public spher e and a private\nhome, which relates primarily to monitoring and intimacy,\nhas no material effect on the significance of risk analysis\nfor tender-aged and disabled foster childr en who, by their\ninherent physical limitations, face negligible risk from an\nHIV-positive child such as Adam, whether in the public\nsphere or private home.\n\nSecond, the County argues that its policy is analogous to\nthe legal concept of informed consent, which r equires that\nphysicians, before performing any medical procedure,\nprovide patients with information about the potential risks\nof the procedure to the health and safety of the patient. Doe\nI, 60 F. Supp. 2d at 429-30 (employing this argument). The\nanalogy is inappropriate here. No pr ovision of the ADA\nincorporates the concept of informed consent, and we see\nno basis for engrafting that concept onto the statutory\nscheme.\n\nThird, the County argues that the particular\ncircumstances of the Does' family situation would compel\nCYS to deny foster placement anyway, even in the absence\nof the policy. In particular, the County is concerned with\nfamily instability if Adam is hospitalized or has increased\nneeds, an event that might reduce the level of care to a\nfoster child. The problem with this argument is that the\nCounty, by virtue of its application of the policy to the\nDoes, never reached this evaluative stage. Mor eover, the\nrecord contradicts the County's assertions. Adam's\ncondition is stable. He has good health and faces no greater\nrisk of infection than a child without HIV. T o the extent the\nCounty enacts a policy based on the belief that HIV , as a\ngeneral matter, causes instability, it again controverts the\nADA-mandate of individualized determination. The\ninstability argument further rings hollow given that the\nCounty does not require disclosure of other stability\nthreatening conditions, such as cancer or neur ological\nproblems.\n\nFinally, the County argues that making accommodations\nfor the Does will be difficult and resour ce-intensive given\nthe realities of foster care. Specifically, the County contends\nthat placements are often made under emer gency time\n\n                               23\n\fconstraints with inadequate time for evaluation. Placing\nyoung children with the Does, according to the County,\ncould also be psychologically damaging if those children\nneed to be moved at a later time due to their sexual\ndevelopment. This argument, however, again ignores the\nprinciple of individualized evaluation. After all, not every\nplacement will be an emergency, and not every child will\nneed to be moved.\n\nFor the reasons stated, we will reverse its grant of\nsummary judgment on the Does' claims of disability\ndiscrimination. We emphasize that, while we have used\ntender-aged and disabled foster childr en to illustrate the\nshortcomings of the County's policy, our holding does not\nforeclose the possibility of placing other foster children with\nthe Does, so long as there is no significant risk.\n\nGiven our decision, we need not consider the Does'\nfurther arguments that the District Court impr operly\nconverted the County's motion to dismiss and that it erred\nin not deferring summary judgment pursuant to Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 56(f) until the completion of discovery. See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 12(b) (on conversion, \"all parties shall be given\nreasonable opportunity to present all material made\npertinent to such a motion by Rule 56\"); Fed. R. Civ. Pro.\n56(f); Ford Motor Co. v. Summit Motor Pr ods., Inc., 930 F.2d\n277, 284 (3d Cir. 1991).\n\nIV.\n\nWith respect to the Does' claims of racial discrimination\nunder Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C.\nS 1983, the District Court granted summary judgment to\nthe County. Reasoning that the Does' foster par ent\napplication had not yet been approved and that CYS had\nnot yet denied referral of a foster child to the Does on any\ngrounds, the District Court concluded that the Does' racial\ndiscrimination claims were not ripe. See Doe II, 80 F. Supp.\n2d at 446. On appeal, the Does argue that the District\nCourt erred. We exercise plenary r eview over whether a\ncause of action is ripe. Felmeister v. Office of Attorney\nEthics, 856 F.2d 529, 535 n.8 (3d Cir . 1988). Upon review,\nwe conclude that the District Court's ripeness\ndetermination was incorrect.\n\n                               24\n\fThe ripeness doctrine helps determine whether a dispute\nor claim has matured to a point warranting judicial\nintervention. 13A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, &\nEdward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure S 3532\n(2d ed. 1984). The doctrine exists \"to pr event the courts,\nthrough avoidance of premature adjudication, from\nentangling themselves in abstract disagreements over\nadministrative policies, and also to protect . . . agencies\nfrom judicial interference until an administrative decision\nhas been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by\nthe challenging parties.\" Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner,\n387 U.S. 136, 148-149 (1967), overruled on other grounds,\nCalifano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 105 (1977). T o evaluate\nripeness, we must look at the \"fitness of the issues for\njudicial decision and the hardship to the parties of\nwithholding court consideration.\" Id. at 149. \"A claim is not\nripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future\nevents that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may\nnot occur at all.\" Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300\n(1998) (internal quotations and citation omitted).\n\nHere, the record shows ripe claims. The County enacted\nthe infectious disease policy, and, on December 18, 1998,\nsent a letter informing the Does that they would not be\napproved as foster parents without disclosure of Adam's\nHIV status and without consent of the parents of any\nprospective foster child. During the application process,\nCYS officials allegedly made statements that might support\nan inference of underlying racial motivations-- in\nparticular, Rice allegedly stated that the HIV issue was to\nsome degree irrelevant given the lack of racially suitable\nfoster children.\n\nThe District Court erroneously focused on the alleged\ndenial of placement as the Does' sole claim. Besides\nalleging an improper denial, the Does alleged that the\nCounty imposed discriminatory restrictions on the process\nitself, in part because of racism engendered by the Does'\ninterracial relationship. This allegation, while disputed by\nthe County, does not constitute an \"abstract\ndisagreement[ ]\" incapable of judicial resolution. See, e.g.,\nAbbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 148. Withholding judicial\nconsideration causes an immediate and significant\n\n                               25\n\fhardship on the Does, who will be deprived of their right to\npresent their federal statutory and constitutional claims for\nredress. Therefore, we hold that the racial discrimination\nclaims are ripe.9 Accor dingly, we will reverse summary\njudgment, and remand the case to the District Court for\nfurther consideration.\n\nV.\n\nIn this action, the Does sued CYS officials W atson, Smith,\nand Rice in their individual capacities, seeking to impose\nliability and personal damages. The officials claimed\nqualified immunity from suit. The District Court agreed,\nholding that qualified immunity applied because the Does\nfailed to show that the individual officials' conduct violated\nrights clearly established at the time the conduct occurred.\nDoe II, 80 F. Supp. 2d at 445. The Does appeal this\ndetermination, and we have plenary review. Elder v.\nHolloway, 510 U.S. 510, 516 (1994). We agree with the\nDistrict Court.\n\nThe doctrine of qualified immunity \"hold[s] that\ngovernment officials performing discretionary functions\ngenerally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar\nas their conduct does not violate clearly established\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a r easonable\nperson would have known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.\n800, 818 (1982). The doctrine recognizes \"the need to\nprotect officials who are requir ed to exercise their discretion\nand the related public interest in encouraging the vigorous\nexercise of official authority.\" Id. at 807 (internal quotations\nand citation omitted).\n\nIn determining whether the individual CYS officials are\nentitled to claim qualified immunity, we engage in a three-\npart inquiry: (1) whether the plaintiffs alleged a violation of\ntheir statutory or constitutional rights; (2) whether the right\nalleged to have been violated was clearly established in the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. We express no view as to whether there is sufficient evidence in the\nsummary judgment record to support a claim that the defendants were\nmotivated by racial considerations or that any such considerations had\nany determinative effect on the proceedings concerning the plaintiffs.\n\n                               26\n\fexisting law at the time of the violation; and (3) whether a\nreasonable official should have known that the alleged\naction violated the plaintiffs' rights. Rouse v. Plantier, 182\nF.3d 192, 196-97 (3d Cir. 1999). Under the first part of the\ninquiry, the Does allege a violation of their federal statutory\nand constitutional rights. The second and thir d parts are\nrelated, and involve an inquiry into the \"objective legal\nreasonableness\" of an official's action, assessed in light of\nlegal rules that were \"clearly established\" at the time the\nofficials took the action. Anderson v. Cr eighton, 483 U.S.\n635, 639 (1987) (internal quotations and citation omitted).\nRights may be clearly established even though the pr ecise\nconduct at issue has not yet been declared unlawful. See\nid. at 640. Throughout the inquiry, the officials' subjective\nintent is irrelevant. See id. at 639.\n\nThe Supreme Court has directed that the right in\nquestion should be defined in a particularized and relevant\nmanner, rather than abstractly. See id. at 640. Therefore,\nwe define the right in question as the right of HIV-positive\nindividuals and related persons to be fr ee from generalized\ndiscrimination when public agencies place HIV -negative\nindividuals into their HIV-positive private homes. To defeat\nqualified immunity, this right must have been sufficiently\nclear such that a reasonable official would have known that\nenacting and applying the County's policy would have\nviolated the right. See id. at 640.\n\nTo the contrary, however, the placement of HIV-negative\nchildren into HIV-positive private homes presents a novel\nlegal issue. As we noted earlier, federal cases involving HIV\nand disability discrimination nearly universally deal with\naccess to the public sphere, rather than placement into\nprivate contexts, such as homes or residences. Of the\nPennsylvania county policies we have reviewed in this case,\nonly one directly applies to the right in question, and then\nonly in general terms. Children and Y outh Div., Phila. Dep't\nof Human Servs., Policy Manual SS 1010, 5200.\n\nIn addition to the novelty of the issue, CYS officials had\na separate legal duty to protect the health of foster\nchildren. See, e.g., 23 Pa. Cons. Stat.S 6344. As a legal\nmatter, the interplay between this duty and the ADA's\nprohibition of generalized determinations under the direct\n\n                                27\n\fthreat exception was unclear when the policy was drafted.\nThis is especially true given that there exists authority\nsupporting the proposition that HIV-positive individuals\nmay be segregated from HIV-negative individuals under the\ndirect threat exception even where the possibility of\ntransmission is low. See, e.g., Onishea , 171 F.3d 1289\n(segregation of HIV-positive prisoners in the prison context);\nEstate of Mauro, 137 F.3d 398 (limiting activities of HIV-\npositive surgical technician); Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp.,\n50 F.3d 1261 (limiting activities of an HIV -positive\nphysician); Bradley, 3 F.3d 922 (limiting activities of a HIV-\npositive surgical assistant). For these r easons, we conclude\nthat the right in question was not clearly established such\nthat a reasonable official would have known that the policy\nviolated the ADA, and we will therefore affirm the District\nCourt's holding that the CYS officials had qualified\nimmunity from suit.\n\nVI.\n\nThe Does' final argument on appeal is that the District\nCourt erred in holding that the County gover nment entities\n-- Centre County, CYS, and the County Boar d -- are\nimmune from punitive damages in suits under T itle II of the\nADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.10 We\nexercise plenary review over this legal issue.\n\nThe Does seek punitive damages from the County\ngovernment entities under Title II of the ADA, Section 504\nof the Rehabilitation Act, and 42 U.S.C. S 1983. As to\nS 1983, City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., stands for the\nproposition that municipalities, and mor e broadly, state\nand local governments entities, are immune from punitive\ndamages under that statute. 453 U.S. 247, 271 (1981). The\nissue presented here is whether the District Court correctly\nextended the holding of City of Newport, to suits brought\nunder Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. In order to address the Does' ar guments, we must depart from\nprevious practice in this opinion and r efer separately to Title II of the\nADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\n\n                               28\n\fWe have not found any federal appellate court opinions\nthat have addressed this issue. The district courts that\nhave addressed it are divided, some holding that punitive\ndamages are available against municipalities under Title II\nand Section 504, and some holding that they ar e not.\nCompare, e.g., Dadian v. Village of Wilmette, No. 98-C-3731,\n1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6846, at *9-10 (N.D. Ill. May 4,\n1999) (punitive damages available); Purcell v. Pennsylvania\nDep't of Corr., No. 95-6720, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105, at\n*34-39 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 9, 1998) (same); DeLeo v. City of\nStamford, 919 F. Supp. 70, 74 (D. Conn. 1995) (same);\nPenney v. Town of Middleton, 888 F . Supp. 332, 342\n(D.N.H. 1994) (refusing to dismiss S 504 punitive damages\nclaim but not definitively deciding the issue); with Adelman\nv. Dunmire, No. 95-4039, 1996 WL 107853, at *4 (E.D. Pa.\nMar. 12, 1996) (punitive damages unavailable).\n\nOur analysis begins with City of Newport. In holding that\na municipality is immune from punitive damages under 42\nU.S.C. S 1983, the Supreme Court r easoned that, at the\ntime Congress enacted the statute that is nowS 1983, it\nwas generally understood in common law that a\nmunicipality \"was to be treated as a natural person subject\nto suit for a wide range of tortious activity, but this\nunderstanding did not extend to the award of punitive or\nexemplary damages.\" City of Newport, 453 U.S. at 259-60\n(footnote omitted). The common law rule developed fr om a\nreluctance to punish innocent taxpayers and bankrupt\nlocal governments because of the actions of a few miscreant\npublic officials. Id. at 266. ReviewingS 1983, the Court\nfound no indications, in the common law or legislative\nhistory, that Congress intended to abolish the doctrine of\nmunicipal immunity from punitive damages. Id. at 259-66.\n\nThe Supreme Court also looked to public policy. It\nreasoned that the rationales underlying punitive damages\ndid not support exposing a municipality to such damages\nfor the bad faith actions of its officials. First, since\nmunicipal officials, rather than municipalities, were the\nwrongdoers, sanctioning municipalities would not advance\nthe retributive purpose of S 1983. Id. at 267-68. Second,\nthe Court believed that it was unlikely that municipal\nofficials would be deterred from wr ongdoing by large\n\n                               29\n\fpunitive damages awarded against municipalities. And, in\nany case, a more effective deterr ent existed in the\npossibility of awarding punitive damages dir ectly against\nofficials and their personal finances. Id. at 269-70.\nFurthermore, the Supreme Court noted the high costs of\nexpanded damages remedies under federal statutory and\nconstitutional law, costs that might threaten the financial\nintegrity of local governments. Id. at 270. Since City of\nNewport, the principle that municipalities ar e immune to\npunitive damages under S 1983 has been extended to other\ngovernment entities. See, e.g., Bolden v. Southeastern Pa.\nTransp. Auth., 953 F.2d 807, 830 (3d Cir. 1991) (extending\nthe rule to regional authorities).\n\nThe principles derived from City of Newport are directly\napplicable to the present case. When Congr ess enacted Title\nII of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, it\nknew of the common law rule precluding punitive damages\nagainst municipalities. Therefore, under the City of Newport\nframework, the question is whether Congress intended to\ndisturb that settled common-law immunity.\n\nTo be sure, an opposing principle exists. Namely, the\nSupreme Court in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public\nSchools directed courts to \"presume the availability of all\nappropriate remedies [for a federal right of action] unless\nCongress has expressly indicated otherwise.\" 503 U.S. 60,\n66 (1992). For example, relying on the Franklin\npresumption of remedies and the lack of congressional\nexpression to the contrary, the Fourth Cir cuit held in\nPandazides v. Virginia Board of Education, an employment\ncase in which the sole defendant was a state boar d of\neducation, that the plaintiff could seek punitive damages\nunder Section 504. 13 F.3d 823, 830-32 (4th Cir. 1994) (full\npanoply of legal remedies available, including punitive\ndamages in suit against employer); see also Pur cell, 1998\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 105, at *34-39 (following similar\nreasoning); cf. Schultz v. Young Men's Christian Ass'n of the\nUnited States, 139 F.3d 286, 291 (1st Cir. 1998) (suggesting\nthat, in a suit under Section 504, \"damages for emotional\ndistress [might] be justified to punish patent misbehavior or\nthe deliberate infliction of humiliation\"); but see Moreno v.\nConsol. Rail Corp., 99 F.3d 782, 790-92 (6th Cir. 1996) (en\n\n                               30\n\fbanc) (holding that, based on the lack of congressional\nintent to override existing punitive damage norms, Section\n504 does not allow punitive damages).\n\nWe believe, however, that the analysis underlying\nFranklin, and employed in Pandazides, does not control in\nthis case. The Franklin presumption is rooted in the\ncommon law principle, recognized by the Supr eme Court as\nearly as Marbury v. Madison, that a right without a remedy\nis not a right at all. See 503 U.S. at 66-67 (citing numerous\nauthorities). Prior to Franklin, some courts had held that\nmonetary damages were unavailable in suits br ought under\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. See 503\nU.S. at 64-65. The Franklin Court settled this dispute,\nholding that monetary damages were available. In the\npresent case, the principle of Franklin has limited\napplicability since, irrespective of the availability of punitive\ndamages against municipalities, several other monetary\nremedies are available to enforce the rights in Title II and\nSection 504. Limiting punitive damages will not r ender\nthose rights meaningless. Moreover, insofar as the rules of\nFranklin and City of Newport conflict, the reasonable way to\nreconcile them is to give effect to the narrower rule in the\nlatter. Cf. Morales v. Trans W orld Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S.\n374, 384 (1992) (in statutory construction, \"the specific\ngoverns the general\"). After all, the issue here is not the\ngeneral availability of damage remedies, but rather the\nspecific availability of punitive damages against\nmunicipalities. In these circumstances, City of Newport tells\nus to assume that Congress intended to r etain common law\nimmunity, unless there is a clear expression of\ncongressional intent to the contrary. See 453 U.S. at 263-\n64.\n\nTitle II and Section 504 incorporate by r eference the\nenforcement scheme found in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964. See 42 U.S.C. S 12133 (T itle II incorporates\nenforcement scheme in Section 505 of the Rehabilitation\nAct); 29 U.S.C. S 794a(a)(2) (Section 504 and 505 of the\nRehabilitation Act adopt the remedies available under Title\nVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964). Therefor e, we may look\nfor congressional intent in Title II and Section 504, as well\nas in Title VI. On their face, however , neither Title II nor\n\n                                31\n\fSection 504 indicate a congressional intent to override\nmunicipal immunity to punitive damages. Likewise, support\nfor the availability of punitive damages against\nmunicipalities cannot come from Title VI since the general\nview is that punitive damages are not available, in any\nform, under that statute. Moreno , 99 F.3d at 790 (citing\nnumerous cases).\n\nNevertheless, the Does argue that the Rehabilitation Act\nAmendments of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-506, 100 Stat. 1807\n(1986), demonstrate Congress' intent to eliminate municipal\nimmunity from punitive damages in suits under T itle II and\nSection 504. Title X, section 1003, of the Rehabilitation Act\nAmendments of 1986, entitled \"Civil Rights Remedies\nEqualization,\" abrogates the states' Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity from, among other things, suits under Section\n504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title VI of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964. See 42 U.S.C. S 2000d-7. In particular, the\nCivil Rights Remedies Equalization provision states that,\n\"[i]n a suit against a State for a violation of [these statutes]\n. . . remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity)\nare available . . . to the same extent as such remedies are\navailable for such a violation in the suit against any public\nor private entity other than a State.\" 42 U.S.C.S 2000d-\n7(a)(2). The Does construe the Equalization pr ovision as a\nbroad grant of remedies, evidencing Congr ess' intent that\npunitive damages should be available against\nmunicipalities. We disagree with the Does' interpretation.\nThe provision only states that the remedies available\nagainst a state government would be the same as those\nalready available against an entity other than a state. It\nsays nothing more about punitive damages.\n\nAnother argument suggested by the Does hinges on the\nCivil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat.\n1071 (1991). That act expressly amended T itle I of the ADA\n(employment discrimination) to allow awards of punitive\ndamages against individuals and private entities, but not\nagainst municipalities and government entities. 42 U.S.C.\nS 1981a(b)(1). The act did not amend T itle II. One district\ncourt has reasoned that the amendment of T itle I, without\nchange to Title II, shows that Congress intended not only to\nprohibit punitive damages against municipalities in the\n\n                                32\n\femployment context under Title I, but also to allow punitive\ndamages against municipalities under Title II. See generally\nPurcell, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105, at *34-39. We decline to\ndraw such a broad inference of congr essional intent,\nespecially where numerous explanations for the lack of\namendment to Title II are possible. Compare, e.g., id. at\n*36-38 (lack of amendment to Title II indicates availability\nof punitive damages); with Harrelson v. Elmore County, 859\nF. Supp. 1465, 1468-69 (M.D. Ala. 1994) (lack of\namendment to Title II \"counsels against a statutory\nconstruction that punitive damages are available\").\n\nIn summary, we find that Title II of the ADA and Section\n504 of the Rehabilitation Act lack any indicia of Congress'\nintent to override the settled common law immunity of\nmunicipalities from punitive damages. In addition, just as\nin the S 1983 context, notions of retribution and deterrence\nprovide weak support for awarding punitive damages\nagainst dispassionate municipal government entities, rather\nthan offending officials. See City of Newport, 453 U.S. at\n267-70. Awarding such damages also thr eatens the\nfinancial integrity of local governments. Id. at 270. Given\nthese considerations, we believe that City of Newport should\napply with equal force to suits under T itle II of the ADA and\nunder Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Consequently,\nthe Does may not recover punitive damages fr om the\nCounty government entities.\n\nVII.\n\nFor all these reasons, we will reverse the District Court's\ngrant of summary judgment against the Does on their\nclaims of disability discrimination and remand for further\ndiscovery and factual findings. We will also reverse the\nDistrict Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the\nCounty on the Does' racial discrimination claims and\nremand for further proceedings. Lastly, we will affirm the\nDistrict Court's conclusions that the CYS officials are\nentitled to qualified immunity and that punitive damages\nare unavailable against the County entities.\n\n                               33\n\fA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               34\n\f",

This case began when appellants\nJohn and Mary Doe, an interracial couple with an HIV -\npositive son named Adam,1 appr oached Centre County's\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Names have been changed to preserve confidentiality.\n\n                                 3\n\fFoster Child Program, seeking to become foster parents.\nCounty officials responded by adopting a policy providing\nthat foster families whose members have \"serious infectious\ndiseases\" may care only for children with the same disease.\nThe policy would permit the Does to car e for uninfected\nchildren only if the Does agreed to r elease information\nregarding their son and the biological par ents executed a\nwritten consent releasing the County fr om potential\nliability. The Does refused to agree to the policy and filed\nsuit, alleging disability discrimination in violation of, among\nother statutes, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\nand Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and racial\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964. The Does sought invalidation of the policy,\napproval as foster parents, and compensatory and punitive\ndamages. The District Court granted summary judgment to\nthe County on the disability discrimination claims,\nreasoning that the policy was justified under the ADA's\ndirect threat exception since foster children placed with the\nDoes could sexually assault Adam and contract HIV .\n\nBecause we believe that a reasonable fact finder could\nfind that placement of at least some foster childr en in the\nDoes' home would not entail a significant risk of harm, we\nwill reverse. Furthermore, we will r everse the District\nCourt's judgment that none of the Does' racial\ndiscrimination claims are ripe for adjudication. However, we\nwill affirm the District Court's decision that the individual\nCounty officials are entitled to qualified immunity. We will\nalso affirm the District Court's holding that county\ngovernment entities are immune fr om punitive damages.\n\nI.\n\nThe appellants, John Doe, a 51 year old African-\nAmerican man, and Mary Doe, a 52 year old Caucasian\nwoman, are married, and live in State College, Centre\nCounty, Pennsylvania, with their two adopted sons, Adam,\n11 years old, and Steven, 12.\n\nOver the years, Mary has dedicated herself to the care of\nfoster children with special needs. From 1972 to 1989, she\ncared for 8 foster children and eventually adopted 7 of\n\n                                4\n\fthem. Adam and Steven, who came to Mary as infants, were\nthe last two children she adopted. Adam came to Mary with\nHIV and AIDS, which he contracted from his birth mother.\nAnother of Mary's adopted sons was blind, retar ded and\nhad cerebral palsy. Others had been physically and\nsexually abused. Her efforts have earned her several\nawards, including Foster Parent of the Y ear by the New\nYork State Foster Parents' Association.\n\nOvercoming a troubled youth and time in prison, John\nearned a college degree and became active in church and\ncommunity affairs. He has served as a pr ogram worker in\nresidential group homes for persons with mental\nretardation and is currently a cab driver. He had no\nchildren of his own, but upon marrying Mary, he accepted\nher children, including Adam, into his home.\n\nAIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndr ome) is the last\nstage of progression of the HIV virus (Human\nImmunodeficiency Virus). HIV infects and destroys specific\nwhite blood cells, known as T lymphocytes, that support\nthe body's immune system. As the virus progr esses,\ninfected persons become more and more susceptible to\nopportunistic infections and diseases, and, although\npersons with HIV can live for years, the virus has no cure.\nSee generally Bragdon v. Abbott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118241\"><a href=\"/opinion/118241/bragdon-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 633-37\n(1998) (describing the course of HIV and AIDS in detail,\nwith references to medical texts and authorities).\n\nDue to the virus, Adam suffers eating and digestion\nproblems. He receives nourishment thr ough a feeding tube.\nHe has symptoms of autism and permanent lear ning\ndeficits, including difficulties speaking and expressing\nhimself. Unable to care for himself, Adam r elies on his\nparents and others to assist him with eating, cleaning, and\npersonal hygiene.\n\nPrior to 1996, HIV and AIDS severely thr eatened Adam's\nhealth. His eating and digestive problems wer e far more\nsevere, and he weighed only 37 pounds at the age of six in\nMarch 1996. At that time, doctors began aggr essive drug\ntherapy that has suppressed Adam's HIV viral load to\nundetectable levels.2 Today, despite his physical limitations,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Viral load refers to the level of virus in an HIV-positive person's\nblood.\n\n                               5\n\fAdam has good overall health, and suffers no greater risk\nof opportunistic infection than a child without HIV .\n\nAdam attends school classes for children with special\nneeds. School officials keep his HIV-positive status\nconfidential and do not require disclosure of that status to\nparents of HIV-negative students. Adam has not\ntransmitted HIV to his brother, Steven, nor to any children\nwith whom he attends school.\n\nThe probability of HIV transmission from Adam to others\nis a crucial issue in this case. During proceedings, the\nDistrict Court entertained testimony about HIV and AIDS\nfrom two medical experts, Joel H. Hersh, an expert in\nPublic Health Administration, and Robert M. Swenson,\nM.D., a physician and expert in the treatment of infectious\ndiseases. The following discussion proceeds fr om their\ntestimony and related affidavits. See generally Doe v.\nCounty of Centre, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2580616\"><a href=\"/opinion/2580616/doe-v-county-of-centre/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Bodily fluids such as\nsweat, tears, or saliva, while containing minute amounts of\nHIV, pose little to no risk of infection, nor does skin contact\nwith HIV-positive blood, unless the skin is br oken or has\nopen wounds. Thus, the chance of HIV transmission fr om\ncasual contact is virtually nonexistent. Nor mal sibling\nfighting and roughhousing present negligible risk of\ntransmission. In fact, Dr. Hersh testified that out of the\n21,000 AIDS cases in Pennsylvania, there ar e no reported\ncases of virus transmission due to familial contact or\nfighting. Even intense physical activities cr eate little risk of\ninfection. For example, Dr. Swenson noted that a study\ninvolving football players found that the risk of HIV\ntransmission was one in every 85 million violent contacts.\n\nThe two primary modes of infection are thr ough the use\nof infected hypodermic needles and thr ough unprotected\nsex. According to Dr. Swenson, the pr obability of HIV\ntransmission through sexual activity varies depending on\n\n                               6\n\fthe activity involved, the specific roles of the infected and\nuninfected persons in the sexual activity, and the viral load\nof the infected person. Certain generalities apply. For\nexample, the lower an HIV-positive person's viral load, the\nlower the transmission risk. In addition, during sexual\nintercourse, HIV is more easily transmitted from an\ninsertive to a receptive partner than fr om a receptive to an\ninsertive partner.\n\nRelying on his professional experience and the prevailing\nmedical research, Dr. Swenson testified as to the\nprobability of transmission in non-consensual male-to-male\nsexual activity. These risk findings rely on medical models\nof disease transmission based on observations of patients,\nrather than on actual controlled tests. Accor ding to Dr.\nSwenson, the probability of transmission to a person with\nHIV who performs oral sex on an infected partner is low,\nabout 1 in 2500 for each occurrence. The pr obability of\ntransmission from a receptive HIV-positive partner to an\ninsertive HIV-negative partner in anal sex is about 1 in\n1666. However, the probability of transmission from an\ninsertive HIV-positive partner to a receptive HIV-negative\npartner under these circumstances is much higher, about\n1 in 120.\n\nThe appellees in this case are Centre County, the Office\nof Children and Youth Services of Centr e County (\"CYS\"),\nand the Board of Commissioners of Centr e County (\"County\nBoard\"), as well as individual CYS officials Terry Watson,\nCarol Smith, and Lisa Rice. We will r efer to the appellees\ncollectively as the \"County.\" Centre County provides a\nfoster care program for children in need of temporary or\npermanent placements outside the homes of their biological\nor custodial families. CYS operates the foster car e program\nand is obligated to follow all applicable federal and\nPennsylvania laws. In particular, CYS operates under a\nstatutory duty to investigate foster parent applicants in\norder to preserve the physical and emotional health of\nfoster children. See, e.g., 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. S 6344(d)\n(requiring foster programs to investigate prospective foster\nparents for criminal activity or child abuse). Both Centre\nCounty and CYS receive federal funds, and the foster care\nprogram receives a portion of these funds.\n\n                               7\n\fTerry Watson is the Director of CYS, and oversees the\nfoster care program. Carol Smith is the Assistant Director\nof CYS, bearing ultimate responsibility and oversight for the\ntraining of foster parents. Lisa Rice is a foster home\nspecialist employed by CYS. She helps select and counsel\nfoster families. Tom Groninger, who is not an appellee in\nthis case, is an employee of CYS who perfor ms home\nstudies for prospective foster parents. According to Carol\nSmith, there are several steps in a foster parent\napplication: (1) an initial phone call; (2) a pr eliminary home\nstudy by Groninger; (3) six weeks of pr e-service training for\nfoster parents; (4) a meeting between the foster parents and\nLisa Rice, and a final assessment; and (5) a meeting\nbetween Rice and Smith to approve or disappr ove the\napplication.\n\nIn January 1998, the Does applied to become foster\nparents under the CYS foster care pr ogram. During the\npreliminary home study, the Does disclosed to Groninger\nthat Adam had HIV and AIDS. Prior to the Does'\napplication, CYS officials had never knowingly placed a\nchild in a foster home where someone had HIV , and\ntherefore had no policy to address the limitations, if any,\napplying to such a home. The County claims that CYS,\nlooking for guidance, investigated the policies of other\ncounties throughout Pennsylvania. CYS officials found\nsome infectious disease policies in other counties, but claim\nthat none addressed the specific situation of placing an\nHIV-negative child in a foster home wher e HIV is present.\n\nAmici curiae, the American Public Health Association and\nothers, challenge the County's claims of investigation, citing\nnumerous policies from other jurisdictions. These policies\ngenerally state that family services agencies should neither\napply blanket prohibitions against placing HIV -positive\nfoster children with HIV-negative childr en, nor segregate\nHIV-positive foster children from HIV-negative children\nwithout analyzing the particular circumstances of each\ncase. See Dep't of Pub. Welfar e, Commonwealth of Pa.,\nChildren, Youth and Families Bulletin: HIV/AIDS Policy 9\n(1989) (unofficial draft policy) (\"HIV positive children should\nnot be segregated in day care facilities, foster homes, group\nhomes, residential placements, or institutions based on\n\n                               8\n\ftheir HIV status alone\"); The Dep't of Servs. for Children,\nYouth and their Families, State of Del., Policy and Procedure\nManual: Communicable Diseases S 103 (IV)(F) (1998)\n(\"Except where the presence or risk of[HIV infection from\na foster child] presents specialized car e needs, the presence\nor risk of [HIV] should not be the mitigating factor in the\nplacement decision\"); N.J. Div. of Youth and Family Servs.,\nField Operations Casework Policy and Procedur es Manual\nS 1502.10 (1999) (when placing HIV-positive foster children,\n\"[s]iblings and children of any age may be placed together\nin the same household, unless a physician advises\notherwise\"); Child Welfare League of Am., Meeting the\nChallenge of HIV Infection in Family Foster Car e 18-22\n(1991); Child Welfare League of Am., Serving HIV-Infected\nChildren, Youth, and their Families: A Guide for Residential\nGroup Care Providers 29-33 (1989).\n\nThe policies cited are not, however, entirely on point,\nsince they apply to the placement of HIV-positive foster\nchildren into foster homes rather than the placement of\nHIV-negative children into foster homes where HIV is\npresent. Having reviewed these polices, we conclude that\nonly the policy of the Philadelphia Department of Human\nServices applies to the present situation. That policy\ndeclares that \"[t]he Department . . . does not discriminate\nin . . . its recruitment or development of kinship caregivers,\nfoster parents, adoptive parents, and contracted providers\non the basis of . . . [their] living or[being] perceived as living\nwith HIV/AIDS.\" See Children and Youth Div., Phila. Dep't\nof Human Servs., Policy Manual SS 1010, 5200 (emphasis\nadded).\n\nAfter its investigation, CYS officials examined the records\nof Centre County's foster care program. They found a\npattern of physical and sexual abuse among foster children:\n\n       As of March 31, 1999, CYS had 125 childr en in\n       placement. Of those children:\n\n       (a) 49% (61 children) had behavioral or emotional\n       problems,\n\n       (b) 24% (30 children) had been victims only of sexual\n       abuse[,]\n\n                               9\n\f       (c) 5% (6 children) were perpetrators only of sexual\n       abuse[,] and\n\n       (d) 7% (9 children) were both victims and perpetrators\n       of sexual abuse.\n\nDoe II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 441 (inter nal quotations and\ncitation omitted). According to CYS officials, a \"perpetrator,\"\nas used in (c), is a child who has assaulted another child\nsexually, but CYS's definition of \"assault\" includes such\nactivities as fondling and disrobing others.\n\nCYS officials further concluded that, given the emergency\nnature of foster child placement, there was inadequate time\nto assess each foster child for behavioral or emotional\nproblems prior to placement. While able to identify some\nsexual perpetrators, CYS officials found that a number of\nfoster children were not identified as sexual perpetrators\nuntil after foster placement. Especially disturbing were\ndocumented instances of sexual assault by foster children\non other children in foster homes.\n\nMotivated by the concern that a foster child might\nsexually assault Adam, and thereby contract HIV , CYS\nDirector Watson developed the following policy regarding\nthe placement of children when infectious diseases are\npresent:\n\n       C) Placement Of Children With Ser ious Infectious\n       Diseases\n\n       . . . If a child with a serious infectious disease is placed\n       in a foster home, or if there is a family member of the\n       foster family who has a serious infectious disease, only\n       children with the same serious infectious disease will\n       be considered for placement in that home. The only\n       exception to this policy would be for a parent/guardian\n       of a child in the care and custody of C&YS to sign an\n       informed consent for the placement of their non-\n       infected child in such a home. . . . For this exception\n       to occur, the foster parents would have to voluntarily\n       agree to release information to the child's parents that\n       a member of the foster family has been diagnosed with\n       a specific serious infectious disease.\n\n                               10\n\fThe County Board adopted this policy and dir ected CYS to\ncarry out its terms.3\n\nMeanwhile, Lisa Rice informed the Does that Adam's HIV\nmight present a problem for foster par ent approval.\nAccording to plaintiffs' version of events, Rice also alluded\nto racial considerations, telling Yolanda Lollis of the AIDS\nLaw Project in Pennsylvania,4 as well as Mary Doe, that the\nHIV issue was irrelevant since CYS did not have any\nAfrican-American foster children to place with the Does.\nDuring later proceedings, Rice explained that CYS uses\nrace as a factor in placing children because it tries to\nreplicate a foster child's original home envir onment. Racial\ncontinuity minimizes disruption and change in the child's\nlife. Rice also acknowledged the possibility of racial\nanimosity between the interracial foster par ents and\nCaucasian biological or custodial parents.\n\nGiven the HIV controversy, the Does' application stalled\nwithout a formal evaluation of their fitness as foster\nparents. After delay and mutual recriminations, CYS\nofficials sent the Does a formal letter on December 18,\n1998 stating that:\n\n       we are prepared to consider appr oval of you as\n       available foster parents for any HIV-infected child. If\n       you would like to be approved for other childr en, per\n       our policy, you would need to sign a consent allowing\n       CYS to disclose to any child's parents that a member\n       of your family/household is HIV-infected. In turn, the\n       parent must sign an informed consent allowing their\n       child to be placed in your home.\n\nThe Does refused to consent to this arrangement.\n\nOn April 28, 1999, the Does sued Centre County, CYS,\nand the County Board, as well as CYS officials Watson,\nSmith, and Rice, individually and in their official capacities.\nThe Does charged the County with disability discrimination\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. The quoted passage is actually provision IV.C in a policy containing\nnumerous provisions. Nevertheless, for ease we will refer to this\nprovision as the County's policy.\n\n4. Lollis had provided legal advice to the Does in connection with this\ncase.\n\n                               11\n\fin violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act,\n42 U.S.C. SS 12131-34 [hereinafter\"Title II of the ADA\"],\nand Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.S 794;\nracial discrimination in violation of Title VI of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. S 2000d-1-7; and racial and\ndisability discrimination in violation of the equal protection\nguarantees under the United States Constitution, pursuant\nto 42 U.S.C. S 1983. They also filed a motion for injunctive\nrelief. With respect to remedies, the Does sought\ninvalidation of the County's infectious disease policy, their\napproval as foster parents, and compensatory and punitive\ndamages.\n\nOn June 22, 1999, the District Court held a one-day\nhearing on the Does' preliminary injunction motion. It was\nduring this hearing that nearly all of the r ecord in this case\nwas developed.\n\nOn July 12, 1999, the County moved to dismiss the Does'\ncomplaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to\nstate a claim, arguing that: (a) the Policy was valid since\nAdam's AIDS posed a direct and significant threat to foster\nchildren; (b) the Does' racial discrimination claims were\nunripe; (c) the individual defendants were entitled to\nqualified immunity; and (d) punitive damages wer e\nunavailable. Within its motion, the County r eferred to\nmatters outside of the complaint, specifically r elying on\nevidence from the June 22, 1999 preliminary injunction\nhearing.\n\nThe District Court dealt with the preliminary injunction\nmotion and the 12(b)(6) motion in several related steps. By\norder dated August 30, 1999, the District Court denied the\npreliminary injunction motion, finding that the Does failed\nto prove a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits.\nDoe I, 60 F. Supp. 2d at 426. By or der dated October 13,\n1999, the District Court, believing that the evidence from\nthe hearing sufficed to resolve the case, accepted and\nconsidered the County's proffer ed extrinsic evidence.\nFollowing Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b), the Court r easoned that the\ninclusion of extrinsic evidence mandated the conversion of\nthe motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.\nSee generally Hilfirty v. Shipman, 91 F .3d 573, 578 (3d Cir.\n1996) (outlining procedure for conversion). The Court\n\n                               12\n\ftherefore gave the parties 16 days tofile briefs, affidavits,\nand other materials that might be relevant. The Does\nobjected to conversion, arguing that discovery had been\ninadequate. They also argued that, in any case, the Court\nshould deny summary judgment on the available r ecord.\n\nOn February 1, 2000, the District Court granted\nsummary judgment to the County on all claims.

It held that Adam's HIV posed a\nsignificant risk to foster children who might sexually\nassault Adam, and that therefore, the dir ect threat\nexception to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act applied,\njustifying discrimination via the infectious disease policy.\nThe District Court also held that the individual CYS officials\nwere entitled to qualified immunity because any right the\nDoes had was not clearly established, and, further , that\nCounty government entities were immune fr om punitive\ndamages. Lastly, the Court found that the Does' racial\ndiscrimination claims were unripe. The Does appealed the\norder granting summary judgment for the County, 5 and we\nhave jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.

The Does have not contested the denial of their motion for a\npreliminary injunction.\n\n                               13\n\fIII.\n\nWe first consider the Does' contention that the District\nCourt erred in dismissing their disability discrimination\nclaims brought under Title II of the ADA and Section 504\nof the Rehabilitation Act. As a starting point, the\nprotections found in the ADA and in the Rehabilitation Act\nare interpreted similarly, and, in this case, are identical.\nSee Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 632 (using statutory construction\nto conclude that the Court should \"construe the ADA to\ngrant at least as much protection as pr ovided by the\nregulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act\").\nTherefore, except where necessary, we refer only to Title II\nof the ADA, with the understanding that both statutes are\nimplicated.\n\nTitle II of the ADA provides, in pertinent part, that:\n\n       no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason\n       of such disability, be excluded from participation in or\n       be denied the benefits of the services, pr ograms, or\n       activities of a public entity, or be subjected to\n       discrimination by any such entity.\n\n42 U.S.C. S 12132; see also 29 U.S.C.S 794(a) (Section 504\nof the Rehabilitation Act) (prohibition on disability\ndiscrimination in federal programs). The ADA describes a\ndisability as \"a physical or mental impair ment that\nsubstantially limits one or more of the major life activities\nof [an] individual.\" 42 U.S.C. S 12102(2); see also 29 U.S.C.\n705(20)(B) (same under the Rehabilitation Act). Adam's HIV\nclearly constitutes a disability since it is a physical\nimpairment, 28 C.F.R. S 35.104 (defining \"physical\nimpairment\"), that substantially limits several of Adam's\nmajor life activities, such as talking, walking, and digestion,\n28 C.F.R. S 35.104 (defining \"major life activities\"). See also\n45 C.F.R. S 84.3(j) (defining physical impairment and major\nlife activities under the Rehabilitation Act); Bragdon, 524\nU.S. at 637, 641 (holding that HIV, even in the so-called\nasymptomatic phase, is an impairment which substantially\nlimits the major life activity of reproduction).\n\nThe protections of the ADA extend to \"qualified\nindividuals\" who are discriminated against because of their\nrelationship or association with individuals who have a\n\n                               14\n\fknown disability. 28 C.F.R. 35.130(g); compare 42 U.S.C.\nS 12112(b)(4) (Title I of ADA); H.R. Rep. No. 101-485(III), at\n38 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 461 (Title I\nof ADA) (the ADA \"protects persons who associate with\npersons with disabilities and who are discriminated against\nbecause of that association. This may include family,\nfriends, and persons who provide care for persons with\ndisabilities.\"). As the adoptive parents of Adam, John and\nMary Doe have a close relationship entitling them to\nprotection under the ADA.\n\nCYS's policy requires notification of and consent from the\nbiological or custodial parents of HIV-negative foster\nchildren when placing those children in homes with HIV-\npositive individuals. The policy therefor e treats John and\nMary Doe differently during the foster parent application\nprocess solely on the basis of Adam's HIV and AIDS. As a\nfacial matter, then, the policy constitutes disability\ndiscrimination against the Does under the ADA.\n\nNevertheless, the ADA allows disparate treatment in\ncertain cases. In particular, the ADA r ecognizes that the\ngoal of ending disability discrimination must be balanced\nagainst the health and safety risks that disabilities\nsometimes pose to others. See Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 648-\n49. Thus, the ADA contains a direct thr eat exception, which\nallows discrimination if a disability \"poses a direct threat to\nthe health or safety of others.\" 28 C.F.R. Part 35, App. A at\n483; compare 42 U.S.C. S 12182(b)(3) (Title III of ADA); see\nalso 29 U.S.C. S 705(20)(D) (Rehabilitation Act). A \"direct\nthreat\" exists when there is a \"significant risk to the health\nor safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a\nmodification of polices, practices, or procedures or by the\nprovision of auxiliary aids or services.\" 42 U.S.C.\nS 12182(b)(3) (emphasis added).6 As the Supreme Court has\nstated, the exception can only be invoked wher e a risk is\nsignificant: \"[b]ecause few, if any, activities in life are risk\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6.

The direct thr eat exception\ntherefore applied, justifying the County's policy. While\nacknowledging that the probability of transmission might\nbe low during a specific sexual act, the Court stated that it\nwas \"unaware of any way of assuring that contact between\n[Adam and a foster child] will be indeed casual,\" and that\nif not casual, there would be a chance that HIV -\ntransmitting sexual intercourse might take place. Doe II, 80\n\n                               17\n\fF. Supp. 2d at 443 (internal quotations and citation\nomitted).\n\nIn an effort to follow Arline and Bragdon, the District\nCourt based its significance of risk conclusion on four\nfindings of fact. As to the nature of the risk, it found that\n\"the HIV virus has been proven to be transmitted through\nsexual intercourse (homosexual or heter osexual),\nintravenous drug use, and transfusion of blood and blood\nproducts.\" Doe I, 60 F. Supp. 2d at 428. As to the duration\nof the risk, it found that \"AIDS is a ter minal disease for\nwhich there is no cure. . . . [T]he risk [is] present until the\ncarrier succumbs to the disease.\" Id. W ith respect to the\nseverity of the risk, it found that \"[t]he harm to third\nparties is life-threatening.\" Id. W e agree that there is no\ngenuine dispute regarding these findings.\n\nMost of the tension in this case, however, surrounds the\nfourth and final factor -- the probability of transmission. As\nto this factor, the District Court agr eed with the County,\nand found \"a high probability that [HIV] will be transmitted\n[through sexual contact] to childr en placed in foster care\nwith the Does.\" Id. at 428. With r espect to this factor, we\ncannot agree with the District Court because we conclude\nthat there is definitely a genuine dispute of fact. It is\nobvious from the record that Adam's physical limitations\nprevent him from being a sexual aggr essor. The District\nCourt must have derived its conclusion regar ding the\nprobability of transmission from the possibility of a sexual\nmisdeed by a foster child, reasoning that: (1) given the data\nprovided by CYS officials, CYS foster childr en have a high\npropensity to sexually abuse other childr en, see Doe II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 441; and (2) according to testimony by Carol\nSmith, \"CYS cannot identify with any certainty at the time\nof placement which of its foster children will engage in\nassaultive behavior or those children who will be sexual\nperpetrators,\" id. at 442 (internal quotations and citation\nomitted).\n\nWe believe that the reasoning the County and the District\nCourt employed is contrary to Congress' intent that\nanalysis of the ADA's direct threat exception should involve\nan individualized inquiry into the significance of the threat\nposed. See Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 649. In concluding that\n\n                               18\n\fCYS foster children have a high propensity for sexual\nabuse, the District Court relied on a bland and generalized\nset of statistics, lacking in individual specificity. These\nstatistics reveal that 12% of the foster childr en have had\nhistories of perpetrating some form of \"sexual abuse,\" but\nthe statistics broadly define \"sexual abuse\" to include\nactivities such as fondling and disrobing that carry no risk\nof transmitting HIV. Does II, 80 F . Supp. 2d at 441. More\nimportant, the statistics do not indicate how many children\ncan be readily identified as being unable or unlikely to\nengage in high-risk behavior.\n\nThe following example illustrates this point. The Does\nhave stated a preference for foster childr en under the age of\n12. Foster children of tender age -- i.e., infants and\nchildren who have not reached puberty-- are extremely\nunlikely to commit forcible sexual inter course leading to the\ntransmission of HIV.7 Mor eover, as noted there is no\nevidence indicating that Adam is at all likely to commit\nsuch an assault, and much evidence suggesting that this is\nmost unlikely. Thus, we believe that the probability of HIV\ntransmission from Adam to a tender-aged child placed in\nthe Does' home appears to be insignificant. Mor eover,\ncontrary to Carol Smith's testimony, such children are\nprecisely the type of children whom CYS can identify as\nunlikely perpetrators of HIV-transmitting sexual assault.\n\nThe County argues that even though the pr obability of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. We use \"tender age\" only as helpful terminology for defining a range\nof sexual development. In doing so, we are not drawing on any legal\ndefinition of tender years or age, but rather on the practical physical\nlimits of pre-pubescent children. In fact, we note that the definition of\nthe phrase \"children of tender years\" has varied in social and legal\ncontexts, with little direct connection to sexual development. See, e.g.,\nBlack's Law Dictionary 1480 (7th ed. 1999) (in family law, the tender\nyears doctrine provides \"that custody of very young children (usu[ally]\nfive years of age and younger) should generally be awarded to the mother\nin a divorce unless she is found to be unfit\"); Robert G. Marks, Note,\nShould We Believe the People Who Believe the Children?: The Need for a\nNew Sexual Abuse Tender Years Hearsay Exception Statute, 32 Harv. J.\non Legis. 207, 245-46 (1995) (noting that all states limit their tender\nyears statutes to children below a certain age, and arguing that some of\nthe age limits are too low).\n\n                               19\n\ftransmission is negligible, a generalized policy is justified\nwhere a disability, such as HIV, is deadly and has no cure,\nbecause the loss of even one life is too great a cost in\npursuit of the ADA's honorable goals. Admittedly, when\nfacing the life-threatening consequences of HIV , some\nfederal appellate courts have held that any amount of risk\nthrough a \"specific and theoretically sound means of\ntransmission\" constitutes a significant risk, allowing\ninvocation of the direct threat exception.

Onishea, 171 F.3d at 1297. In\nlight of the objective medical evidence in the r ecord, a\nreasonable fact finder could easily find that the risk of a\nlittle boy or girl contracting HIV from Adam by forcing him\nto engage in high-risk behavior is the type of r emote and\nspeculative risk that is insufficient for a finding of\nsignificant risk, and insufficient for the invocation of the\ndirect threat exception. See Bragdon , 524 U.S. at 649 (in\nassessing whether patient with HIV presented a significant\nrisk to dentist, \"Arline and the ADA do not ask whether a\nrisk exists, but [rather] whether it is significant\"); see also\nH.R.

We\nreject this contention. Even if we accept the less than\nobvious proposition that a young child or infant could\nphysically assault Adam, a reasonable factfinder could\nfind, based on the objective medical evidence in the record,\nthat the risk of HIV transmission from casual contact, even\nintense physical contact, is negligible.\n\nFurthermore, the County's sexual assault and physical\nviolence arguments lose all force in the case of a foster\nchild who is so disabled that he or she is simply incapable\nof committing sexual or physical assault.8 In such a\nsituation, the County's blanket policy discriminates against\nthe Does because of Adam's HIV positive status even\nthough the probability of HIV transmission, and\nconsequently the risk, is next to zero.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. We believe there are such handicapped foster children. After all, the\nrecord demonstrates that Adam himself was a physically disabled foster\nchild before being adopted by the Does.\n\n                               21\n\fIn sum, the record is insufficient to support the grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of the County, because a\nreasonable fact finder could not find, based on the\nsummary judgment record, that an individual with HIV\nwould always pose a significant risk to a foster child placed\nby the County in that individual's home. This generalization\nfails to address, for example, the placement of tender-aged\nand disabled foster children. The County ther efore failed to\nconduct the ADA-mandated individualized deter mination,\nand the District Court erred in concluding that the ADA's\ndirect threat exception applied.\n\nIn addition to its significance of risk ar guments under\nArline and Bragdon, the County has pr esented several other\njustifications for the policy. First, and most persuasively,\nthe County argues that the direct thr eat test in Arline and\nBragdon developed in the context of HIV-positive persons\nrightfully demanding inclusion into the public spher e and\ninto public life. See, e.g., Abbott, 163 F.3d at 90 (holding\nthat HIV-positive dental patient was entitled to dental\ntreatment); Chalk, 840 F.2d at 708-09, 712 (9th Cir. 1988)\n(holding that school could not transfer teacher with HIV\nfrom classroom). The present case, by contrast, involves an\nHIV-positive family requesting the placement of a non-HIV\npositive child into their private home. The County argues\nthat this is a novel situation, demanding mor e stringent\nstandards since the threat posed in a private home is much\ngreater.\n\nWe have found no authority on this issue. W e\nacknowledge the intuitive difference between inclusion into\nthe public sphere and placement in a private home. A\nprivate home is much more difficult to monitor and involves\nmore intimate contact than would ordinarily take place in\nthe public sphere, such as at a school or within a hospital.\nFurther, as compared to the HIV-positive person seeking\ninclusion, the HIV-negative child and his or her guardians\nlack choice in the foster placement process. In addition,\nentities responsible for foster placement, such as the\nCounty, normally have an independent statutory directive\nto ensure that the placement of children is safe. See, e.g.,\n23 Pa. Cons. Stat. S 6344. Nevertheless, the differences\nsuggested, while possibly significant in some cases, cannot\n\n                               22\n\fjustify the type of blanket policy implemented her e. Simply\nput, the distinction between the public spher e and a private\nhome, which relates primarily to monitoring and intimacy,\nhas no material effect on the significance of risk analysis\nfor tender-aged and disabled foster childr en who, by their\ninherent physical limitations, face negligible risk from an\nHIV-positive child such as Adam, whether in the public\nsphere or private home.\n\nSecond, the County argues that its policy is analogous to\nthe legal concept of informed consent, which r equires that\nphysicians, before performing any medical procedure,\nprovide patients with information about the potential risks\nof the procedure to the health and safety of the patient. Doe\nI, 60 F. Supp. 2d at 429-30 (employing this argument). The\nanalogy is inappropriate here. No pr ovision of the ADA\nincorporates the concept of informed consent, and we see\nno basis for engrafting that concept onto the statutory\nscheme.\n\nThird, the County argues that the particular\ncircumstances of the Does' family situation would compel\nCYS to deny foster placement anyway, even in the absence\nof the policy. In particular, the County is concerned with\nfamily instability if Adam is hospitalized or has increased\nneeds, an event that might reduce the level of care to a\nfoster child. The problem with this argument is that the\nCounty, by virtue of its application of the policy to the\nDoes, never reached this evaluative stage. Mor eover, the\nrecord contradicts the County's assertions. Adam's\ncondition is stable. He has good health and faces no greater\nrisk of infection than a child without HIV. T o the extent the\nCounty enacts a policy based on the belief that HIV , as a\ngeneral matter, causes instability, it again controverts the\nADA-mandate of individualized determination. The\ninstability argument further rings hollow given that the\nCounty does not require disclosure of other stability\nthreatening conditions, such as cancer or neur ological\nproblems.\n\nFinally, the County argues that making accommodations\nfor the Does will be difficult and resour ce-intensive given\nthe realities of foster care. Specifically, the County contends\nthat placements are often made under emer gency time\n\n                               23\n\fconstraints with inadequate time for evaluation. Placing\nyoung children with the Does, according to the County,\ncould also be psychologically damaging if those children\nneed to be moved at a later time due to their sexual\ndevelopment. This argument, however, again ignores the\nprinciple of individualized evaluation. After all, not every\nplacement will be an emergency, and not every child will\nneed to be moved.\n\nFor the reasons stated, we will reverse its grant of\nsummary judgment on the Does' claims of disability\ndiscrimination. We emphasize that, while we have used\ntender-aged and disabled foster childr en to illustrate the\nshortcomings of the County's policy, our holding does not\nforeclose the possibility of placing other foster children with\nthe Does, so long as there is no significant risk.\n\nGiven our decision, we need not consider the Does'\nfurther arguments that the District Court impr operly\nconverted the County's motion to dismiss and that it erred\nin not deferring summary judgment pursuant to Fed.

The County enacted\nthe infectious disease policy, and, on December 18, 1998,\nsent a letter informing the Does that they would not be\napproved as foster parents without disclosure of Adam's\nHIV status and without consent of the parents of any\nprospective foster child. During the application process,\nCYS officials allegedly made statements that might support\nan inference of underlying racial motivations-- in\nparticular, Rice allegedly stated that the HIV issue was to\nsome degree irrelevant given the lack of racially suitable\nfoster children.\n\nThe District Court erroneously focused on the alleged\ndenial of placement as the Does' sole claim. Besides\nalleging an improper denial, the Does alleged that the\nCounty imposed discriminatory restrictions on the process\nitself, in part because of racism engendered by the Does'\ninterracial relationship. This allegation, while disputed by\nthe County, does not constitute an \"abstract\ndisagreement[ ]\" incapable of judicial resolution. See, e.g.,\nAbbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 148.

Under the first part of the\ninquiry, the Does allege a violation of their federal statutory\nand constitutional rights.

See\nid. at 640. Throughout the inquiry, the officials' subjective\nintent is irrelevant. See id. at 639.\n\nThe Supreme Court has directed that the right in\nquestion should be defined in a particularized and relevant\nmanner, rather than abstractly. See id. at 640. Therefore,\nwe define the right in question as the right of HIV-positive\nindividuals and related persons to be fr ee from generalized\ndiscrimination when public agencies place HIV -negative\nindividuals into their HIV-positive private homes. To defeat\nqualified immunity, this right must have been sufficiently\nclear such that a reasonable official would have known that\nenacting and applying the County's policy would have\nviolated the right. See id. at 640.\n\nTo the contrary, however, the placement of HIV-negative\nchildren into HIV-positive private homes presents a novel\nlegal issue. As we noted earlier, federal cases involving HIV\nand disability discrimination nearly universally deal with\naccess to the public sphere, rather than placement into\nprivate contexts, such as homes or residences. Of the\nPennsylvania county policies we have reviewed in this case,\nonly one directly applies to the right in question, and then\nonly in general terms. Children and Y outh Div., Phila. Dep't\nof Human Servs., Policy Manual SS 1010, 5200.\n\nIn addition to the novelty of the issue, CYS officials had\na separate legal duty to protect the health of foster\nchildren. See, e.g., 23 Pa. Cons. Stat.S 6344. As a legal\nmatter, the interplay between this duty and the ADA's\nprohibition of generalized determinations under the direct\n\n                                27\n\fthreat exception was unclear when the policy was drafted.\nThis is especially true given that there exists authority\nsupporting the proposition that HIV-positive individuals\nmay be segregated from HIV-negative individuals under the\ndirect threat exception even where the possibility of\ntransmission is low.

Pa.\nMar. 12, 1996) (punitive damages unavailable).\n\nOur analysis begins with City of Newport. In holding that\na municipality is immune from punitive damages under 42\nU.S.C. S 1983, the Supreme Court r easoned that, at the\ntime Congress enacted the statute that is nowS 1983, it\nwas generally understood in common law that a\nmunicipality \"was to be treated as a natural person subject\nto suit for a wide range of tortious activity, but this\nunderstanding did not extend to the award of punitive or\nexemplary damages.\" City of Newport, 453 U.S. at 259-60\n(footnote omitted). The common law rule developed fr om a\nreluctance to punish innocent taxpayers and bankrupt\nlocal governments because of the actions of a few miscreant\npublic officials. Id. at 266. ReviewingS 1983, the Court\nfound no indications, in the common law or legislative\nhistory, that Congress intended to abolish the doctrine of\nmunicipal immunity from punitive damages. Id. at 259-66.\n\nThe Supreme Court also looked to public policy. It\nreasoned that the rationales underlying punitive damages\ndid not support exposing a municipality to such damages\nfor the bad faith actions of its officials. First, since\nmunicipal officials, rather than municipalities, were the\nwrongdoers, sanctioning municipalities would not advance\nthe retributive purpose of S 1983. Id. at 267-68. Second,\nthe Court believed that it was unlikely that municipal\nofficials would be deterred from wr ongdoing by large\n\n                               29\n\fpunitive damages awarded against municipalities. And, in\nany case, a more effective deterr ent existed in the\npossibility of awarding punitive damages dir ectly against\nofficials and their personal finances. Id. at 269-70.\nFurthermore, the Supreme Court noted the high costs of\nexpanded damages remedies under federal statutory and\nconstitutional law, costs that might threaten the financial\nintegrity of local governments. Id. at 270. Since City of\nNewport, the principle that municipalities ar e immune to\npunitive damages under S 1983 has been extended to other\ngovernment entities. See, e.g., Bolden v. Southeastern Pa.\nTransp. Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575838\"><a href=\"/opinion/575838/russell-bolden-in-no-90-1478-v-southeastern-pennsylvania-transportation/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 830 (3d Cir. 1991) (extending\nthe rule to regional authorities).\n\nThe principles derived from City of Newport are directly\napplicable to the present case. When Congr ess enacted Title\nII of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, it\nknew of the common law rule precluding punitive damages\nagainst municipalities. Therefore, under the City of Newport\nframework, the question is whether Congress intended to\ndisturb that settled common-law immunity.\n\nTo be sure, an opposing principle exists. Namely, the\nSupreme Court in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public\nSchools directed courts to \"presume the availability of all\nappropriate remedies [for a federal right of action] unless\nCongress has expressly indicated otherwise.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112696\"><a href=\"/opinion/112696/franklin-v-gwinnett-county-public-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n66 (1992). For example, relying on the Franklin\npresumption of remedies and the lack of congressional\nexpression to the contrary, the Fourth Cir cuit held in\nPandazides v.

The Franklin presumption is rooted in the\ncommon law principle, recognized by the Supr eme Court as\nearly as Marbury v. Madison, that a right without a remedy\nis not a right at all. See 503 U.S. at 66-67 (citing numerous\nauthorities). Prior to Franklin, some courts had held that\nmonetary damages were unavailable in suits br ought under\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. See 503\nU.S. at 64-65. The Franklin Court settled this dispute,\nholding that monetary damages were available. In the\npresent case, the principle of Franklin has limited\napplicability since, irrespective of the availability of punitive\ndamages against municipalities, several other monetary\nremedies are available to enforce the rights in Title II and\nSection 504. Limiting punitive damages will not r ender\nthose rights meaningless. Moreover, insofar as the rules of\nFranklin and City of Newport conflict, the reasonable way to\nreconcile them is to give effect to the narrower rule in the\nlatter. Cf. Morales v. Trans W orld Airlines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112742\"><a href=\"/opinion/112742/morales-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 384 (1992) (in statutory construction, \"the specific\ngoverns the general\"). After all, the issue here is not the\ngeneral availability of damage remedies, but rather the\nspecific availability of punitive damages against\nmunicipalities. In these circumstances, City of Newport tells\nus to assume that Congress intended to r etain common law\nimmunity, unless there is a clear expression of\ncongressional intent to the contrary. See 453 U.S. at 263-\n64.\n\nTitle II and Section 504 incorporate by r eference the\nenforcement scheme found in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964. See 42 U.S.C. S 12133 (T itle II incorporates\nenforcement scheme in Section 505 of the Rehabilitation\nAct); 29 U.S.C. S 794a(a)(2) (Section 504 and 505 of the\nRehabilitation Act adopt the remedies available under Title\nVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964). Therefor e, we may look\nfor congressional intent in Title II and Section 504, as well\nas in Title VI. On their face, however , neither Title II nor\n\n                                31\n\fSection 504 indicate a congressional intent to override\nmunicipal immunity to punitive damages. Likewise, support\nfor the availability of punitive damages against\nmunicipalities cannot come from Title VI since the general\nview is that punitive damages are not available, in any\nform, under that statute. Moreno , 99 F.3d at 790 (citing\nnumerous cases).\n\nNevertheless, the Does argue that the Rehabilitation Act\nAmendments of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-506, 100 Stat. 1807\n(1986), demonstrate Congress' intent to eliminate municipal\nimmunity from punitive damages in suits under T itle II and\nSection 504. Title X, section 1003, of the Rehabilitation Act\nAmendments of 1986, entitled \"Civil Rights Remedies\nEqualization,\" abrogates the states' Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity from, among other things, suits under Section\n504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title VI of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964. See 42 U.S.C. S 2000d-7. In particular, the\nCivil Rights Remedies Equalization provision states that,\n\"[i]n a suit against a State for a violation of [these statutes]\n. . . remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity)\nare available . . . to the same extent as such remedies are\navailable for such a violation in the suit against any public\nor private entity other than a State.\" 42 U.S.C.S 2000d-\n7(a)(2). The Does construe the Equalization pr ovision as a\nbroad grant of remedies, evidencing Congr ess' intent that\npunitive damages should be available against\nmunicipalities. We disagree with the Does' interpretation.\nThe provision only states that the remedies available\nagainst a state government would be the same as those\nalready available against an entity other than a state. It\nsays nothing more about punitive damages.\n\nAnother argument suggested by the Does hinges on the\nCivil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat.\n1071 (1991). That act expressly amended T itle I of the ADA\n(employment discrimination) to allow awards of punitive\ndamages against individuals and private entities, but not\nagainst municipalities and government entities. 42 U.S.C.\nS 1981a(b)(1). The act did not amend T itle II. One district\ncourt has reasoned that the amendment of T itle I, without\nchange to Title II, shows that Congress intended not only to\nprohibit punitive damages against municipalities in the\n\n                                32\n\femployment context under Title I, but also to allow punitive\ndamages against municipalities under Title II.

LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *34-39. We decline to\ndraw such a broad inference of congr essional intent,\nespecially where numerous explanations for the lack of\namendment to Title II are possible. Compare, e.g., id. at\n*36-38 (lack of amendment to Title II indicates availability\nof punitive damages); with Harrelson v. Elmore County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1396608\"><a href=\"/opinion/1396608/harrelson-v-elmore-county-ala/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1465</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1468-69 (M.D. Ala. 1994) (lack of\namendment to Title II \"counsels against a statutory\nconstruction that punitive damages are available\").\n\nIn summary, we find that Title II of the ADA and Section\n504 of the Rehabilitation Act lack any indicia of Congress'\nintent to override the settled common law immunity of\nmunicipalities from punitive damages. In addition, just as\nin the S 1983 context, notions of retribution and deterrence\nprovide weak support for awarding punitive damages\nagainst dispassionate municipal government entities, rather\nthan offending officials. See City of Newport, 453 U.S. at\n267-70. Awarding such damages also thr eatens the\nfinancial integrity of local governments. Id. at 270. Given\nthese considerations, we believe that City of Newport should\napply with equal force to suits under T itle II of the ADA and\nunder Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Consequently,\nthe Does may not recover punitive damages fr om the\nCounty government entities.\n\nVII.\n\nFor all these reasons, we will reverse the District Court's\ngrant of summary judgment against the Does on their\nclaims of disability discrimination and remand for further\ndiscovery and factual findings. We will also reverse the\nDistrict Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the\nCounty on the Does' racial discrimination claims and\nremand for further proceedings. Lastly, we will affirm the\nDistrict Court's conclusions that the CYS officials are\nentitled to qualified immunity and that punitive damages\nare unavailable against the County entities.\n\n                               33\n\fA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               34\n\f</pre>",
