Acevedo (on brief).\n\n\n\nMilitary Judge:    James Pohl\n\n\n       THIS OPINION IS SUBJECT TO REVISION BEFORE FINAL PUBLICATION.\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n\n       Judge BAKER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n       Appellant was a private first class (E-3) serving with the\n\n411th Military Police Company in Iraq.    On December 16, 2003, he\n\nwas convicted pursuant to his pleas by a military judge sitting\n\nalone of false official statements and wrongful use and\n\ndistribution of controlled substances on divers occasions, in\n\nviolation of Articles 107 and 112a, Uniform Code of Military\n\nJustice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. §§ 907, 912a (2000), respectively.\n\nThe military judge sentenced Appellant to a bad-conduct\n\ndischarge, confinement for eight months, and reduction to grade\n\nE-1.   The convening authority approved the bad-conduct discharge\n\nand grade reduction, but in accordance with a pretrial agreement\n\nonly approved seven months of confinement.   On February 2, 2006,\n\nthe United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals summarily\n\naffirmed.   United States v. Wise, No. ARMY 20031310 (A. Ct.\n\nCrim. App. Feb. 2, 2006).   Upon Appellant’s petition we granted\n\nreview of the following modified issue:\n\n       WHETHER APPELLANT’S CONFINEMENT CONDITIONS, INCLUDING AND\n       IN PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT TO HIS CLAIM OF HAVING BEEN\n       CONFINED WITH ENEMY PRISONERS OF WAR IN IRAQ, WERE\n       UNLAWFUL, AND WHETHER, IN THE CONTEXT PRESENTED, APPELLANT\n       FORFEITED HIS CLAIMS OF UNLAWFUL POST-TRIAL PUNISHMENT BY\n       FAILING TO EXHAUST HIS ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES UNDER UNITED\n       STATES V. WHITE, 54 M.J. 469 (C.A.A.F. 2001).\n\n       A prisoner must seek administrative relief prior to\n\ninvoking judicial intervention to redress concerns regarding\n\npost-trial confinement conditions.    United States v. White, 54\n\n\n                                  2\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n\nM.J. 469, 472 (C.A.A.F. 2001).   Absent some unusual or egregious\n\ncircumstance this means that the prisoner has exhausted the\n\nprisoner grievance system in his detention facility and that he\n\nhas petitioned for relief under Article 138, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §\n\n938 (2000).   Id.   For the case-specific reasons stated below,\n\nincluding Appellant’s unrebutted statements regarding the nature\n\nof his confinement, his informal efforts to seek redress, and\n\nthe unusual circumstances in which he was confined –- which\n\naccording to Appellant included the absence of a formal\n\ngrievance process –- we conclude that a review of Appellant’s\n\nclaims is warranted.\n\n     Turning to Appellant’s allegation that he was detained with\n\nIraqi enemy prisoners of war (EPWs) in violation of Article 12,\n\nUCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 812 (2000), we conclude that even if the facts\n\nare as alleged by Appellant, based on the plain text and\n\nlegislative history to Article 12, UCMJ, Appellant was not\n\nconfined in “immediate association” with enemy prisoners or\n\nother foreign nationals.\n\n     Appellant also avers that he was placed in irons while\n\nconfined in Iraq, in violation of Article 55, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §\n\n855 (2000).   Unlike the absolute proscription in Article 55,\n\nUCMJ, against flogging and branding, the proscription against\n\nthe use of irons is qualified.   Irons are permitted for the\n\npurposes of safe custody.   As there may be well-founded reasons\n\n\n                                  3\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n\nfor the use of irons in the combat situation presented, applying\n\nthe principles of United States v. Ginn, 47 M.J. 236 (C.A.A.F.\n\n1997), we are unable to resolve Appellant’s claim without\n\nfurther fact-finding.    As a result, we remand this aspect of the\n\ncase to the Court of Criminal Appeals, which is authorized to\n\nresolve the factual issue of why Appellant was confined in\n\nTikrit with irons.    If the Court of Criminal Appeals orders\n\nfurther fact-finding, including a DuBay1 hearing, and the\n\nconvening authority determines that such fact-finding is\n\nimpracticable, the convening authority may moot the issue and\n\nthe necessity of further fact-finding by awarding Appellant a\n\ncredit of twenty-one days for that period of time Appellant\n\nalleges in his unrebutted affidavit that he was confined in\n\ndouble irons in the Tikrit compound.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    Unites States v. DuBay, 17 C.M.A. 147, C.M.R. 411 (1967).\n\n                                  4\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n\n                           BACKGROUND2\n\n     During operations in Iraq, the 4th Infantry Division\n\ncaptured and detained a number of EPWs.3   According to\n\nAppellant’s affidavits, at the time of his court-martial, 100 to\n\n150 EPWs were being held in the 4th Infantry Division EPW\n\nconfinement area in Tikrit, Iraq.   The confinement area,\n\ncommonly referred to as “the cage,” was not a structure but an\n\narea cordoned off by concertina wire, and further subdivided by\n\nconcertina wire into at least two sections.   American soldiers,\n\nincluding Appellant, were assigned as guards and escorted the\n\nEPWs any time it was necessary to take them beyond the confines\n\nof the wired area.\n\n     Following his conviction, Appellant was ordered into\n\nconfinement in “the cage” pending transfer to the confinement\n\nfacility in Kuwait to serve the remainder of his sentence.\n\n\n\n2\n  Descriptions of Appellant’s confinement are from two sworn\naffidavits Appellant executed in preparation for his appeal.\nThere is no evidence or affidavits provided on behalf of the\nGovernment rebutting the information in these documents. “Under\nthese circumstances, we shall treat the statements in the\ndocuments as establishing the factual setting of the appellate\nproceedings.” United States v. Simon, 64 M.J. 205, 207\n(C.A.A.F. 2006) (citing Ginn, 47 M.J. at 250). This is in\naccord with the Supreme Court’s view that “[s]olemn declarations\nin open court carry a strong presumption of verity.” Blackledge\nv. Allison, 431 U.S. 63, 73-74 (1977).\n3\n  For the purposes of this opinion, we take Appellant’s\nnomenclature as stated, and express no view as to whether the\n\n\n\n                                5\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n\nAppellant and two fellow American soldiers were confined in a\n\nsection separated from the EPWs by “a single strand of\n\nconcertina wire.”   According to Appellant, he was close enough\n\nto the Iraqi EPWs for some of the EPWs to approach the dividing\n\nwire and attempt to engage the Americans in conversation.\n\nAppellant also states that one of the EPWs recognized him as a\n\nformer guard, and that he recognized several of the EPWs as\n\nprisoners he had once guarded.   Further, he states that two of\n\nthe EPWs had tuberculosis and were quarantined from the others,\n\nbut were separated from Appellant by no more than fifteen feet\n\nand one coil of concertina wire.\n\n     Appellant states that he was ordered to wear a blue\n\njumpsuit, similar to the one worn by many of the EPWs.      He also\n\nasserts that for the seven days he remained confined in “the\n\ncage,” he was kept in “double irons” -- leg shackles and\n\nhandcuffs -- even while eating and sleeping.      The handcuffs were\n\nonly removed when he was taken to the latrine.\n\n     After a week, Appellant was transferred to a confinement\n\nfacility at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, where he served the remainder\n\nof his sentence before returning to the United States.\n\n     Appellant argues that the conditions of his post-trial\n\nconfinement violated his rights.       In particular, with respect to\n\n\n\nindividuals referenced are appropriately referenced as EPWs,\n“other foreign nationals,” or in some other manner.\n\n                                   6\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n\nhis placement in irons, Appellant claims a violation of Article\n\n55, UCMJ.     With respect to his placement in proximity to the\n\nIraqi prisoners, Appellant claims a violation of Article 55,\n\nUCMJ, and of his Eighth Amendment right to be free from “cruel\n\nand unusual punishment.”     See U.S. Const. amend. VIII.\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n\n      This case poses two separate questions:\n\n      (1)    Is Appellant barred from pursuing his claim by a\n             failure to exhaust his administrative remedies while\n             confined in Iraq?; and\n\n      (2)    Was Appellant’s incarceration in the enclosed\n             confinement area in violation of his rights in that he\n             was:\n\n             a. Placed in immediate association with EPWS; or\n\n             b. Placed in double irons for the extent of his stay in\n                “the cage”?\n\nI.   Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\n\n      “[A] prisoner must seek administrative relief prior to\n\ninvoking judicial intervention” to redress concerns regarding\n\npost-trial confinement conditions.     White, 54 M.J. at 472;\n\nUnited States v. Miller, 46 M.J. 248, 250 (C.A.A.F. 1997)\n\n(quoting United States v. Coffey, 38 M.J. 290, 291 (C.M.A.\n\n1993)).     This requirement “promot[es] resolution of grievances\n\nat the lowest possible level [and ensures] that an adequate\n\nrecord has been developed [to aid appellate review].”       Miller,\n\n46 M.J. at 250.\n\n\n\n                                   7\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n\n     We review factual findings under a clearly erroneous\n\nstandard, but the “ultimate determination” of whether an\n\nAppellant exhausted administrative remedies is reviewed de novo,\n\nas a mixed question of law and fact.    See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Anderson, 55 M.J. 198, 201 (C.A.A.F. 2001).\n\n     Exhaustion requires Appellant to demonstrate that two paths\n\nof redress have been attempted, each without satisfactory\n\nresult.   Appellant must show that “absent some unusual or\n\negregious circumstance . . . he has exhausted the prisoner-\n\ngrievance system [in his detention facility] and that he has\n\npetitioned for relief under Article 138.”   White, 54 M.J. at 472\n\n(citation and quotation marks omitted); see also United States\n\nv. Lovett, 63 M.J. 211, 215 (C.A.A.F. 2006) (holding that in\n\norder to claim Eighth Amendment violations, the appellant must\n\nshow, inter alia, “that he has exhausted the prisoner-grievance\n\nsystem . . . and that he has petitioned for relief under Article\n\n138”) (citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Article 138, UCMJ, provides that:\n\n     Any member of the armed forces who believes himself\n     wronged by his commanding officer, and who, upon due\n     application to that commanding officer, is refused\n     redress, may complain to any superior officer, who\n     shall forward the complaint to the commissioned\n     officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction\n     over the officer against whom it is made. The officer\n     exercising general court-martial jurisdiction shall\n     examine into the complaint and take proper measures\n     for redressing the wrong complained of; and he shall,\n     as soon as possible, send to the Secretary concerned a\n\n\n                                 8\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n\n     true statement of that complaint, with the proceedings\n     had there on.\n\n     Since a prime purpose of ensuring administrative exhaustion\n\nis the prompt amelioration of a prisoner’s conditions of\n\nconfinement, courts have required that these complaints be made\n\nwhile an appellant is incarcerated.      See, e.g., United States v.\n\nWhite, No. ACM 33583, 1999 CCA LEXIS 220, at *4, 1999 WL 605616\n\n(A.F. Ct. Crim. App. July 23, 1999) (holding that solely raising\n\nconditions of confinement complaints in post-release clemency\n\nsubmissions is inadequate to fulfill the requirement of\n\nexhausting administrative remedies and that “after the appellant\n\nhas been released from confinement . . . we have no remedy to\n\nprovide”), aff’d, White, 54 M.J. at 475.\n\n     In the current case, there is no record of Appellant filing\n\ncomplaints about his confinement conditions while in “the cage,”\n\neither through a prisoner grievance system or to his chain of\n\ncommand under Article 138, UCMJ.       Even when Appellant was\n\nremoved from the confinement area and transported to Kuwait,\n\ncomplaints regarding his confinement conditions in Iraq were\n\nstill not raised.   Pursuant to Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.)\n\n1105(b)(2)(D), Appellant submitted a clemency request on January\n\n1, 2004, less than a week after his removal from the confinement\n\narea in Tikrit.   In that request he did not reference the\n\nconditions in Tikrit.   Appellant’s counsel also did not raise\n\n\n\n                                   9\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nthe matter in an additional clemency submission filed February\n\n6, 2004.\n\n     However, Appellant states that he raised concerns about\n\nconfinement early during the course of his legal proceedings.\n\nAppellant initially raised this issue immediately after his\n\nconviction and before his confinement.   Worried that he would be\n\nincarcerated with the EPWs, Appellant spoke with his battalion\n\ncommander about his concerns and the commander attempted to\n\narrange for Appellant to be held in his unit area in Tikrit\n\nuntil he could be transferred to a confinement facility to serve\n\nhis sentence.   According to Appellant, his battalion commander’s\n\nsuperior declined and ordered him into “the cage.”   Prior to\n\nincarceration, Appellant was also in contact with other\n\nrepresentatives from his unit and his trial defense counsel, to\n\nwhom he relayed his concerns.   These attempts were also to no\n\navail.\n\n     Appellant further claims that upon being placed in “the\n\ncage,” he was given only a rudimentary in-processing, was denied\n\ncontact with his attorney, and was provided no explanation of\n\nhow to raise complaints.   Appellant also claims that he had no\n\nknowledge of Article 138, UCMJ, procedures and further states\n\nthat he did not believe that he had any way of raising his\n\nconcerns while in “the cage.”\n\n\n\n\n                                10\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n     The present record does not reflect that Appellant’s\n\ncommand in Tikrit had an institutionalized complaint mechanism\n\nspecific to the EPW confinement area, and Appellant’s attempts\n\nto informally communicate with, and complain to, his guards were\n\nmet with silence.   On one of the few occasions that the guards\n\nresponded to Appellant’s concerns -- when Appellant raised his\n\nanxiety about being kept in close proximity to two EPWs who he\n\nwas informed were suffering from tuberculosis -- the guards\n\nspurned his complaints.   Additionally, notwithstanding the\n\npreference for raising the issue while undergoing the alleged\n\nonerous confinement conditions, in this case Appellant was kept\n\nunder the complained-of conditions for only a week, limiting the\n\npossible time during which to complain.\n\n     Appellant also states that he attempted to lodge complaints\n\nabout “the cage” as soon as he was afforded the opportunity to\n\ndo so once he arrived at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait.   He raised his\n\ncomplaints about his treatment in Iraq with the guard force\n\nsupervisor at Camp Arifjan but was told that he could not use\n\nthe Camp Arifjan complaint system to lodge an objection about\n\nhis confinement in another location.    Finally, less than a month\n\nafter being released from confinement and returning to the\n\nUnited States, Appellant swore an affidavit that detailed the\n\nconditions he experienced in Iraq.\n\n\n\n\n                                11\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n     Based on the foregoing, we conclude that in the “unusual”\n\ncircumstances presented, Appellant is entitled to have the\n\nmerits of his claims addressed.    Among other things, Appellant\n\nhas asserted that he made numerous informal attempts to raise\n\nthe conditions of his confinement in Iraq with his chain of\n\ncommand.   Accepting Appellant’s affidavits on their face,\n\nAppellant asserts that he was not briefed on, nor otherwise made\n\naware of, any formal process of complaint at the facility in\n\nTikrit during the first year of combat operations in Iraq.    He\n\nfurther states that his efforts while confined in Kuwait to\n\nraise his concerns were brushed aside.   The Government has\n\nchosen not to factually rebut Appellant’s affidavits.   Those\n\nallegations regarding confinement with EPWs and the use of leg\n\nirons are serious, raise matters of first impression for this\n\nCourt for which there is no extant guidance, and are potentially\n\nsubject to repetition during ongoing combat operations.   In such\n\ncircumstances, we conclude that unusual circumstances warrant\n\nreview of Appellant’s claims, notwithstanding his failure to\n\nexhaust those formal mechanisms of administrative review usually\n\nassociated with permanent and established facilities.\n\n     In reaching this conclusion, we are cognizant that\n\nAppellant was represented by counsel.    Further, defense counsel\n\nwas sufficiently established in the operational setting\n\npresented to file for clemency using letterhead designated “U.S.\n\n\n                                  12\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nArmy Trial Defense Service, Region IX, Tikrit Field Office,\n\nTikrit, Iraq.”   Ordinarily, we would expect competent counsel to\n\nraise confinement concerns like Appellant’s at the time they are\n\nbrought to counsel’s attention, or to indicate as part of the\n\nappellate record, why they were unable to do so in the context\n\npresented.   These factors weigh in favor of a conclusion that\n\nAppellant did not exhaust his administrative remedies.\n\nNonetheless, in our view, it factors into, but does not\n\nultimately change, our conclusion that the better view is that\n\nunusual circumstances warrant consideration of Appellant’s\n\nclaims.    In this regard we note the absence of guidance from\n\nthis Court on the subject of exhaustion in an operational\n\nsetting.\n\nII.   Did the Conditions of Confinement in Tikrit Violate Article\n      12, UCMJ, Article 55, UCMJ, or the Eighth Amendment?\n\n      We now examine the specific aspects of confinement about\n\nwhich Appellant complains.   This Court reviews de novo the\n\nquestion of whether an appellant has been subject to\n\nimpermissible conditions of post-trial confinement in violation\n\nof Article 55, UCMJ, and/or the Eighth Amendment.   White, 54\n\nM.J. at 471.\n\n      Appellant’s initial grievance is that the conditions of\n\nconfinement in Tikrit and then at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait,\n\nsubjected him to conditions that did not meet the standards for\n\n\n\n                                 13\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nthe incarceration of United States Army prisoners set out in the\n\nDep’t of the Army, Reg. 190-47, Military Police, The Army\n\nCorrections System (June 15, 2006) [hereinafter AR Reg. 190-47].\n\nIn this context, we find his complaints regarding his\n\nconfinement in Kuwait without merit4 and turn to the two issues\n\nthat warrant review:   Appellant’s claim of having been\n\nincarcerated in irons and his incarceration in proximity to\n\nenemy prisoners of war during the seven days in Tikrit.\n\n     1.   Appellant’s Incarceration with Iraqi Prisoners of War\n\n     Article 12, UCMJ, provides:     “Confinement with Enemy\n\nPrisoners Prohibited[.]   No member of the armed forces may be\n\nplaced in confinement in immediate association with enemy\n\nprisoners or other foreign nationals not members of the armed\n\nforces.”5 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n4\n AR. 190-47 is a 100-pluspage document detailing the Army\ncorrections program, including the appropriate conditions of\nconfinement for Army inmates. The extensive list includes\ndetails ranging from the physical design of facilities to the\nprovision of “health and comfort supplies” for prisoners. Id.\nat para. 10-9. However, the Army is provided explicit\nflexibility by a provision in the regulation for “field\nexpedient detention cells,” a provision that holds, inter alia,\nthat “[d]etention cells used during field and combat operations\nwill correspond to established . . . standards to the maximum\ndegree possible under existing conditions.”\n5\n We note that para 3-2.e, of AR Reg. 190-47 tracks the language\nof Article 12, UCMJ:\n\n     Incarceration with enemy prisoners of war. Members of the\n     Armed Forces of the United States will not be incarcerated\n     in immediate association with enemy prisoners of war (EPW)\n\n                                14\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n     Interpreting Article 12, UCMJ, is an issue of statutory\n\ninterpretation, which we review de novo, United States v.\n\nMartinelli, 62 M.J. 52, 56 (C.A.A.F. 2005), as is the question\n\nwhether Article 12, UCMJ, has been violated.   The interpretation\n\nof Article 12, UCMJ, in this context is an issue of first\n\nimpression.\n\n     A.   Text of the Statute\n\n     The prohibition to which Article 12, UCMJ, is directed is\n\nnot absolute in the sense that flogging or branding is\n\nproscribed in Article 55, UCMJ.    Rather, the prohibition against\n\n“placing” American personnel in association with enemy prisoners\n\nor other foreign nationals is qualified by the nature of the\n\nassociation.   Only “immediate association” is directly\n\nproscribed.    Thus, the interpretation of Article 12, UCMJ, rests\n\non an understanding of not just “association” but of the\n\nparticular type of association to which the article is directed.\n\nAlthough the other terms in Article 12, UCMJ, are\n\nstraightforward and can and should be read in light of their\n\nplain meaning and prior use in our case law, “immediate\n\n\n\n     or other foreign nationals not members of the Armed\n     Services of the United States, unless the EPW or foreign\n     nationals are being detained under military control for\n     suspected or proven criminal conduct.\n\nWe conclude that the stated exception in AR Reg. 190-47 is\ninapposite in this case.\n\n\n\n                                  15\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nassociation” is subject to multiple interpretations.    See United\n\nStates v. Warner, 62 M.J. 114, 120 n.30 (C.A.A.F. 2005) (citing\n\nLamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U.S. 526, 536 (2004)).\n\n     There is no explanatory introductory paragraph in the\n\narticle that sheds light on the meaning or purpose of the\n\nstatute.   The few military cases that have used the term\n\n“immediate association” have done so outside the context of\n\nArticle 12, UCMJ, analysis and are not on point.6    The dictionary\n\nis only marginally more helpful.     The dictionary defines\n\n“immediate” as “direct” or “proximate.”    Webster’s Third New\n\nInternational Dictionary Unabridged (2002), available at\n\nhttp://unabridged.merriamwebster.com (last visited Apr. 24,\n\n2007).   “Association” is defined as the state of being\n\n“connected” or “combine[d].”   Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate\n\n\n6\n This Court recognizes that the term “immediate association” has\nbeen used in cases referring to Article 13, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §\n813 (2000), and in particular when analyzing whether pretrial\ninmates were inappropriately held with convicted prisoners. In\nthat context, “immediate association” was synonymous with\n“commingling.” See, e.g., United States v. Palmiter, 20 M.J.\n90, 98 (C.M.A. 1985) (Everett, C.J., concurring in the result).\nWhile informative, we find our use of the term in reference to\nArticle 13, UCMJ, inapposite in our discussions of Article 12,\nUCMJ, for two reasons. First, the understanding that the\nprohibition on “commingling” is synonymous with “immediate\nassociation” has become moribund as this Court has followed\ncivilian courts into looking at the intent of jailers, rather\nthan the physical placement of inmates, in determining\nviolations of Article 13, UCMJ. See id. at 95 (majority\nopinion). Second, Congress only saw fit to place “immediate\nassociation” in Article 12, UCMJ, suggesting that there were\nspecial concerns that it wished to address in this regard.\n\n                                16\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nDictionary 110 (9th ed. 1991).     Thus, it appears that Article\n\n12, UCMJ, prohibits United States personnel from being confined\n\nin a manner so that they would be directly connected or combined\n\nwith captured foreign personnel.      Appellant contends that he was\n\nseparated from Iraqi prisoners by only a “single strand of\n\nconcertina wire.”   Yet, even a single strand of wire is not an\n\ninsubstantial barrier and may have prevented Appellant’s\n\n“connection” or “combination” with captured personnel.\n\nConcertina wire is high-strength, spring-steel wire with\n\nmultiple barbs attached at short intervals.     Field\n\nFortifications, Subcourse EN0065, Edition B, United States Army\n\nEngineer School, Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, Lesson 4, §4-5.a,\n\navailable at http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/\n\nlibrary/policy/army/accp/en0065/le4.htm (last visited Apr. 24,\n\n2007).   Wires form coils so that when they are unrolled they\n\ntake on a cylindrical shape akin to a concertina.       See id.\n\nPersons handling concertina wire wear heavy reinforced gloves to\n\navoid being cut by the wire.   See id. §§ 4-2.6., 4-6.      The\n\nstandard concertina wire used by the United States military\n\ncreates a cylindrical shape three feet in diameter.      Id. § 4-\n\n5.a.\n\n       In our view, a single strand of concertina wire represents\n\na real boundary between Appellant and foreign personnel.\n\nNonetheless, the fundamental question remains:     what sort of\n\n\n                                 17\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nseparation is mandated by Article 12, UCMJ?   With the text of\n\nthe statute indeterminate, and in the absence of case law, we\n\n“turn to the primary source of the statute,” its legislative\n\nhistory, for guidance.   Warner, 62 M.J. at 120 n.30.\n\n     B.   Legislative History\n\n     Unclear language can become clear if the congressional\n\nintent behind the legislation is reviewed.    See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Disney, 62 M.J. 46, 51 (C.A.A.F. 2005) (looking inter\n\nalia to legislative history to divine the purpose of a statute\n\ncriminalizing the certain activities with explosive materials);\n\nUnited States v. Reeves, 62 M.J. 88, 93 (C.A.A.F. 2005)\n\n(invoking legislative history to understand the congressional\n\npurpose behind the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996);\n\nLoving v. United States, 62 M.J. 235, 241 (C.A.A.F. 2005)\n\n(relying on legislative history to glean the congressional\n\nintent behind Article 76, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 876 (2000)).\n\n     The legislative history surrounding Article 12, UCMJ,\n\nidentifies the concerns it sought to address.   Article 12, UCMJ,\n\nstems from conditions of confinement experienced in World War\n\nII, a still-recent event when the UCMJ was debated in 1950.\n\nDuring that war the various military branches conducted two\n\nmillion courts-martial of United States personnel.     James B.\n\nRoan & Cynthia Buxton, The American Military Justice System in\n\nthe New Millennium, 52 A.F. L. Rev. 185, 187 (2002).    Some\n\n\n                                18\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nAmerican servicemembers who had been convicted in these courts-\n\nmartial had, at times, been held in prisons overseas with\n\nprisoners of war or other enemy nationals.     See Uniform Code of\n\nMilitary Justice:      Hearings on H.R. 2498 Before a Subcommittee\n\nof the House Committee on Armed Services, 81st Cong. 914-16\n\n(1949), reprinted in Index and Legislative History, Uniform Code\n\nof Military Justice (1950) (not separately paginated)\n\n[hereinafter Legislative History].\n\n        The legislation from which Article 12, UCMJ, eventually\n\nderived was initially presented in the House of Representatives,\n\nas a part of the Selective Service Act directed to remediating\n\nthe concerns about United States personnel being confined with\n\nforeign nationals during World War II.     According to testimony\n\nfrom Robert W. Smart, a professional staff member of the House\n\nCommittee on Armed Services at the time, the article was\n\noriginally “brought before the House [by] Mr. [Omar T.] Burleson\n\nof Texas [the previous year during debates on the Selective\n\nService Act, with the sole goal ensuring] that American boys\n\nwere not confined with prisoners of war or other enemy\n\nnationals,” which Representative (Rep.) L. Mendel Rivers, the\n\nvice chair of the Committee stated “[often] happened during the\n\nwar.”    Id. at 914.    Language in line with Rep. Burleson’s\n\namendment was adopted in Article 16 of the Selective Service Act\n\nof 1948, which stated that American servicemen could not be\n\n\n                                   19\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n“confined with enemy prisoners or any other foreign nationals\n\noutside of the continental limits of the United States.”\n\nSelective Service Act of 1948, Pub. L. No. 80-759, § 212, 62\n\nStat. 604, 630 (1948) (emphasis added).\n\n     However, once debate on the UCMJ commenced before the House\n\nCommittee on Armed Services in March 1949, it became evident\n\nthat the breadth of the article’s language could create\n\ndifficulties for military operations overseas.   Felix Larkin,\n\nAssistant General Counsel in the Office of the Department of\n\nDefense, testified before the Committee and asserted that in\n\nmany places “[t]here may not be more than one jail or place of\n\nconfinement.”   Legislative History, supra, at 914.    Thus, if\n\nprisoners of war or enemies were already incarcerated in the\n\nsingle facility, no American could be imprisoned with them, and\n\nvice versa.\n\n     Mr. Larkin and the Committee were especially concerned\n\nabout this language as it pertained to the Navy.   Id. at 914-15.\n\nIf a naval vessel captured an enemy vessel at sea it may have\n\nbeen unable to incarcerate enemy sailors in the ship’s brig if\n\nAmerican sailors were already confined there.    Id.\n\n     This concern led the Committee to propose and the Congress\n\nto adopt the “immediate association” language, which, according\n\nto Mr. Larkin, meant that “you could keep [American and foreign\n\npersonnel] in the same jail [but had to] segregat[e] them in\n\n\n                                20\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\ndifferent cells.”   Legislative History, supra, at 914.      As the\n\ncommentary to the proposed article stated, it was “intended to\n\npermit confinement in the same guardhouse or brig, but would\n\nrequire segregation.”   Id.\n\n     Appellant avers that he was held in a facility that also\n\nhoused Iraqi prisoners of war.   As he recounted, “[t]here were\n\nEPWs in the cage when I was housed there, although we were\n\nseparated by a strand of concertina wire.”    Despite this\n\nbarrier, the Iraqis were close enough for some of prisoners to\n\nattempt to engage Appellant in conversation and for one prisoner\n\nto recognize Appellant, and for Appellant to recognize many of\n\nhis former prisoners.   Moreover, for five of the seven days\n\nAppellant was as close as fifteen feet to two of quarantined\n\nIraqis.\n\n     The situation in forward positions during combat -- as in\n\nthe current case -- is not dissimilar from the hypothetical Navy\n\nship at sea that has captured enemy sailors.   In both cases,\n\ncapacity to house prisoners may be limited and thus placing\n\nforeign and American prisoners in the same facility -- while\n\nensuring some segregation -- is in line with the text as well as\n\nthe spirit and history of Article 12, UCMJ.    Indeed, the\n\nalteration of the text of Article 12, UCMJ, from the original\n\nseen in the Selective Service Act of 1948, reflects that\n\nCongress specifically intended to avoid designating situations\n\n\n                                 21\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nlike the one in which Appellant found himself as per se\n\nviolations of Article 12, UCMJ.\n\n        As Mr. Larkin testified in 1949, the drafters intended\n\nArticle 12, UCMJ, to “prohibit incarceration in close\n\nassociation but not with because ‘with’ has the connotation that\n\nyou could not keep them in the same prison and there may be only\n\none.”    Legislative History, supra, at 915.   The following\n\ntestimonial exchange between Mr. Larkin and Rep. John Anderson\n\nfurther emphasized this point, expanding it to include both\n\nUnited States facilities and “foreign jails”:\n\n        MR. ANDERSON: [I]s there any place in the code that\n        expresses prohibition against confining our men in foreign\n        jails?\n\n        MR. LARKIN: No; but this one prevents them being confined\n        with enemy prisoners of war or foreign nationals not\n        members in the same cell.\n\n             . . . .\n\n        MR. ANDERSON: [U]nder this code, could a commanding\n        officer have an enlisted man . . . confined in a foreign\n        jail?\n\n        MR. LARKIN: Yes, he could, for a short time or whatever\n        time is necessary. But if they are so confined they may\n        not be in immediate association with any [foreign\n        nationals].\n\nId.\n\n        In the only federal case in either the military or civilian\n\nsystems directly addressing this provision, the United States\n\nCourt of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit -- hearing a habeas\n\n\n\n                                  22\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\ncorpus claim -- came to the same conclusion, holding that the\n\n“heart of this prohibition [in Article 12, UCMJ] lies in the\n\nwords ‘in immediate association’ and is not necessarily violated\n\nby the general confinement of the designated classes of\n\nprisoners within the same institution.”   Kuykendall v. Taylor,\n\n285 F.2d 480, 481 (10th Cir. 1960).7\n\n     Based on this analysis, and assuming Appellant’s statements\n\nas factually accurate, we conclude that Appellant’s conditions\n\nof confinement while housed in the EPW “cage” did not violate\n\nhis Article 12, UCMJ, rights.8   See Ginn, 47 M.J. at 248 (“[I]f\n\n\n\n7\n The appellant’s Article 12, UCMJ, claim was one of several he\nlodged in his habeas claim, which centered on his mistaken\nbelief that the Naval Reviewing Authority did not have the power\nto change the location of his confinement. Kuykendall, 285 F.2d\nat 480-81. While rejecting the entirety of his petition, the\nreviewing court could find no evidence that any foreign\nnationals were incarcerated in the same facilities in which he\nwas imprisoned (initially the United States Naval Disciplinary\nBarracks, Naval Operating Base, Terminal Island, San Pedro,\nCalifornia, and then the United States Disciplinary Barracks at\nFort Leavenworth), let alone “in immediate association” to the\nappellant. Id. at 481. Regardless, the court’s view on the\nmeaning of Article 12, UCMJ, while not binding, is persuasive\nand instructive.\n8\n Applying Ginn, and assuming Appellant’s affidavits are\naccurate, Appellant has not demonstrated that the conditions to\nwhich he was subjected were “sufficiently egregious” or amounted\nto unnecessary or wanton infliction of pain to give rise to the\npresumption that he was being impermissibly punished. Nor is\nthere evidence that the Government intended to punish Appellant\nby confining him in “the cage” rather than a more formalized\nfacility, or that the Government was “deliberately indifferent”\nto Appellant’s well-being in doing so. As a result, we do not\nfind Article 55, UCMJ, or the Eighth Amendment implicated in\nAppellant’s placement in the confinement area in Tikrit. See\n\n                                 23\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nthe facts alleged in the affidavit allege an error that would\n\nnot result in relief even if any factual dispute were resolved\n\nin appellee’s favor, the claim may be rejected on that basis.”\n\nGinn, 47 M.J. at 248.)   The Government’s segregation of\n\nAppellant from enemy prisoners and other foreign nationals was\n\nmanifest and bona fide, and as a result, if indeed he was\n\nseparated by concertina wire,9 Appellant was not imprisoned in\n\n“immediate association” with foreign personnel.\n\n     2.   Appellant’s Incarceration in Irons\n\n     According to Appellant’s unrebutted affidavit, for the\n\nentirety of his incarceration in the EPW confinement area he was\n\nplaced in double irons, i.e., handcuffs and leg cuffs.     His\n\nhandcuffs were only removed when he was escorted to the latrine.\n\n\n\n\nUnited States v. Fischer, 61 M.J. 415, 423 (C.A.A.F. 2005)\n(holding in the context of pretrial confinement that\n“sufficiently egregious” conditions can give rise to a\npresumption that a detainee is being punished citing United\nStates v. James, 28 M.J. 214, 216 (C.M.A. 1989)); Palmiter, 20\nM.J. at 95 (holding that improper intent by confinement\nofficials can be determinative in finding violations of\nconfinement conditions); Lovett, 63 M.J. at 216 (holding that an\nappellant must demonstrate that “officials knew and . . .\ndisregarded known risks to inmate safety” in order to show a\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment (citing Farmer v. Brennan, 511\nU.S. 825, 837 (1994)).\n9\n  We reach this conclusion without expressing a view as to the\nrelative merits in this and other contexts of the government’s\nmethods of complying with Article 12, UCMJ. Indeed, in this\ncase our decision is based not on the facts as adjudicated, but\non one side’s unrebutted affidavit examined consistent with\nGinn.\n\n                                24\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nThese facts implicate Appellant’s rights under Article 55, UCMJ,\n\nwhich provides that:\n\n     Punishment by flogging, or by branding, marking, or\n     tattooing on the body, or any other cruel or unusual\n     punishment, may not be adjudged by any court-martial\n     or inflicted upon any person subject to this chapter.\n     The use of irons, single or double, except for the\n     purpose of safe custody, is prohibited.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n     To have been permissible, the use of irons must have met\n\ntwo criteria:   such use could not have been for punishment, and\n\nthe irons must have been employed to effectuate “safe custody.”\n\nRegarding the possible punitive use of the irons, this Court has\n\nstated that “[I]n the absence of a showing of intent to punish,\n\na court must look to see if a particular restriction . . . ,\n\nwhich may on its face appear to be punishment, is instead but an\n\nincident of a legitimate nonpunitive governmental objective.”\n\nPalmiter, 20 M.J. at 95 (quoting Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520,\n\n539 n.20 (1979)) (alteration in original).   Further, as the\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held:\n\n     Prison officials have wide discretion to determine\n     what measures should be taken in order to preserve\n     order and security in a detention facility.\n     Determining [for example] that a particular inmate\n     poses a security risk to fellow inmates and to\n     corrections personnel [or to himself], and requiring\n     that inmate to wear ankle and wrist restraints is\n     certainly within this discretion.\n\n\n\n\n                                25\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nSanders v. Hopkins, 131 F.3d 152 (10th Cir. 1997) (table\n\ndecision) (published in text format at 1997 U.S. App LEXIS\n\n34179, at *6-*7, 1997 WL 7552776, at *2).\n\n     This Court has not addressed the meaning of “safe custody.”\n\nLower courts have found the use of irons appropriate when\n\nnecessary to limit the potential risk of harm to an inmate or\n\nharm caused by an inmate, or to prevent a well-founded concern\n\nregarding escape.   For instance, the United States Navy Court of\n\nMilitary Review found that leg irons were appropriately used for\n\nsafe custody when they were placed on a known violent prisoner\n\nwho had recently threatened an officer, and the prisoner was\n\nonly constrained in such a manner for the duration of a two-hour\n\ntransport flight.   United States v. Ewing, 44 C.M.R. 738, 741\n\n(N.C.M.R. 1971).    Similarly, the United States Coast Guard Board\n\nof Review approved the use of leg irons on a prisoner who had\n\nescaped in the past and “showed . . . signs of [once again]\n\ngoing over the hill.”   United States v. St. Croix, 18 C.M.R.\n\n465, 467 (C.G.B.R. 1955).   The logic of Ewing and St. Croix is\n\nparallel to holdings in the civilian courts.   See, e.g., LeMaire\n\nv. Maass, 12 F.3d 1444, 1457 (9th Cir. 1993) (holding that\n\nkeeping a known violent prisoner shackled and handcuffed even\n\nwhen showering was permissible so as to protect staff and fellow\n\ninmates); Selby v. Martin, 84 F. App’x 496, 498-99 (6th Cir.\n\n\n\n\n                                 26\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n2003) (holding that confinement in leg irons and belly chains\n\nwas allowed for an inmate convicted of attempted escape).\n\n     Though the location of Appellant’s confinement in Tikrit,\n\nIraq, may have limited his escape risk, we are not provided any\n\nevidence of his propensity to abscond.   Nor are we provided any\n\nevidence that the use of irons was necessary for safe custody.\n\nSuch evidence is dispositive of an Article 55, UCMJ, violation\n\nregarding the use of irons, and once an appellant makes a\n\ncolorable claim that he was put in irons, the burden for\n\nestablishing that an exception to the statute’s prohibitions\n\nwere met falls to the government.    In the context of an Article\n\n13, UCMJ, claim, the appellant is experiencing the deprivations,\n\nor has experienced the deprivations, of which he complains and\n\nthus retains the burden of demonstrating the violative\n\nconditions.   However, in this context, the information as to\n\nwhether the irons were used as punishment or were used to\n\neffectuate “safe custody” is within the possession of the\n\ngovernment.\n\n     As a result, on the present record before this Court we\n\nlack the necessary facts to determine whether the use of irons\n\nwas necessary for “safe custody” and thus nonpunitive given the\n\ncombat context presented.   Such a finding “may justify [the]\n\nimposition of conditions and restrictions” without those\n\nconditions and restrictions becoming punitive.   Bell, 441 U.S.\n\n\n                                27\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nat 539-40   (“[I]f a particular condition or restriction . . . is\n\nreasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective, it\n\ndoes not, without more, amount to ‘punishment.’”).\n\n                             DECISION\n\n     The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals is affirmed as to the findings but set aside as to the\n\nsentence.   The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate\n\nGeneral of the Army for remand to that court.   The Court of\n\nCriminal Appeals is authorized to resolve the factual issue of\n\nwhy Appellant was confined in Tikrit with irons.   If necessary,\n\nthat court may order a DuBay hearing.    If the Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals orders further fact-finding and the convening authority\n\ndetermines that such fact-finding is impracticable, the\n\nconvening authority may resolve the matter and moot the\n\nnecessity for further fact-finding by awarding Appellant twenty-\n\none days of confinement credit for that period of time Appellant\n\nalleges in his unrebutted affidavit that he was confined in\n\ndouble irons in the Tikrit compound.    Following this action,\n\nArticles 66 and 67, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §§ 866, 867 (2000), shall\n\napply.\n\n\n\n\n                                28\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n       EFFRON, Chief Judge (dissenting):\n\n       Exhaustion of remedies is a critical component of\n\nlitigation concerning the conditions of confinement.    Our case\n\nlaw requires an appellant to demonstrate exhaustion of remedies\n\nabsent unusual or egregious circumstances.   See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. White, 54 M.J. 469, 472-73 (C.A.A.F. 2001).      As noted\n\nin the majority’s opinion, the exhaustion requirement promotes\n\ntwo goals:   (1) resolution of grievances at the lowest possible\n\nlevel; and (2) development of an adequate record for judicial\n\nreview.\n\n       The record in the present case demonstrates that Appellant\n\ndid not pursue the opportunities for relief that were available\n\nearly in his period of confinement when he had the assistance of\n\ncounsel.   Further, the record does not establish the unusual or\n\negregious circumstances that would excuse failure to exhaust\n\nunder our case law.   Under these circumstances, I respectfully\n\ndissent from the majority’s decision to remand this case to the\n\nUnited States Army Court of Criminal Appeals for proceedings on\n\nthe merits of Appellant’s claim.\n\n\n\n                           I.   BACKGROUND\n\n  A.    RECENT SUPREME COURT DECISIONS ON EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES\n\n       Recent decisions by the Supreme Court confirm our reliance\n\non the exhaustion doctrine, but call into question our practice\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nof placing the burden on the appellant to demonstrate\n\nexhaustion.\n\n     In Woodford v. Ngo, 126 S. Ct. 2378 (2006), the Supreme\n\nCourt underscored the dual purposes of the exhaustion\n\nrequirement in the context of the Prison Litigation Reform Act\n\nof 1995, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (2000).   First, exhaustion creates\n\nan incentive for resolution of claims at the prison level\n\nwithout resort to litigation.   Woodford, 126 S. Ct. at 2388.\n\nSecond, “exhaustion often results in the creation of an\n\nadministrative record that is helpful to the court.   When a\n\ngrievance is filed shortly after the event giving rise to the\n\ngrievance, witnesses can be identified and questioned while\n\nmemories are still fresh, and evidence can be gathered and\n\npreserved.”   Id.\n\n     In Jones v. Bock, 127 S. Ct. 910, 919 (2007), the Supreme\n\nCourt considered which party should bear the burden of proving\n\nexhaustion.   The Supreme Court concluded that failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies is an affirmative defense available to\n\nthe government in civil litigation about prison conditions.     Id.\n\nat 921.   In that context, once a prisoner raises a claim of\n\nillegal punishment, the burden is on the government to prove\n\nfailure to exhaust.   Id.\n\n     Although our prison condition litigation arises in a\n\ncriminal rather than a civil context, we typically have looked\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nto the Supreme Court’s doctrine in such cases to guide the\n\nlitigation of prison condition complaints in the military\n\njustice system.   See, e.g., United States v. Lovett, 63 M.J.\n\n211, 215 (C.A.A.F. 2006) (relying on Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S.\n\n825, 834 (1994), to allocate the relative burdens of the parties\n\non the merits of a prison conditions claim).   Our practice of\n\nplacing the burden on an appellant to prove exhaustion is a\n\njudicial doctrine, not specifically required by the Uniform Code\n\nof Military Justice or the Manual for Courts-Martial.      In light\n\nof the Supreme Court’s decision in Jones, 127 S. Ct. at 921, it\n\nis not apparent why the prison condition litigation in the\n\nmilitary should not place the burden on the government rather\n\nthan on the defense to demonstrate a failure to exhaust\n\navailable remedies.\n\n     B.   THE CONVENING AUTHORITY’S POWER TO PROVIDE A REMEDY\n                 FOR ILLEGAL CONFINEMENT CONDITIONS\n\n     The convening authority has broad power to provide relief\n\nfor illegal confinement conditions imposed prior to the\n\nconvening authority’s action on the sentence under Rule for\n\nCourts-Martial (R.C.M.) 1107.   In the course of taking such\n\naction, the convening authority has broad discretion to\n\ndisapprove the sentence in whole or in part, mitigate the\n\nsentence, or change the sentence as long as the severity of the\n\npunishment is not increased.    R.C.M. 1107(d)(1).   The\n\nrequirement for post-trial action on the sentence provides an\n\n\n                                  3\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nopportunity to bring illegal confinement conditions to the\n\nattention of a responsible official, because the convening\n\nauthority is obligated to consider “any matters submitted by the\n\naccused under R.C.M. 1105 or, if applicable, R.C.M. 1106(f).”\n\nR.C.M. 1107(b)(3)(A)(iii).\n\n     The defense counsel’s obligation to serve the post-trial\n\ninterests of his or her client includes a responsibility to\n\nensure that appropriate sentence credits are applied against the\n\nsentence approved by the convening authority.    See David A.\n\nSchlueter, Military Criminal Justice Practice and Procedure §\n\n17-2(B)(7) (6th ed. 2004).   As noted in Schlueter’s treatise,\n\n“defense counsel should be prepared to file any written briefs\n\nor documentation that demonstrate accused’s entitlement to a\n\nsentence credit. . . . [A]ny information about sentence credits\n\nshould be transmitted to the convening authority at an early\n\nopportunity.”   Id.\n\n     The defense has multiple opportunities to present\n\ninformation about confinement conditions to the convening\n\nauthority before the convening authority decides whether to\n\napprove the sentence.   See R.C.M. 1105; R.C.M. 1106; Article\n\n38(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 838(c) (2000); United States v. Fagnan,\n\n12 C.M.A. 192, 195, 30 C.M.R. 192, 195 (1961).   See generally\n\nDavid A. Shaw, The Article 38c Brief:   A Renewed Vitality, Army\n\nLaw., June 1975, at 26.   Given this direct access to the\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nconvening authority, defense counsel “bears a . . . [heavy]\n\nburden of ensuring that the convening authority is aware of\n\nthose matters that indicate that clemency may be warranted.”\n\nSchlueter, supra, at § 17-8(B)(1).\n\n                C.   DEVELOPMENT OF THE FACTUAL RECORD\n\n1.   Trial and post-trial proceedings (December 2003-March 2004)\n\n      a.   The Appellate Rights Memorandum\n\n      Two days before his trial, Appellant signed and initialed a\n\nmemorandum documenting his post-trial rights.    Appellant\n\nacknowledged that:\n\n            I have the right to submit any matters I\n            wish [sic] the convening authority to\n            consider in deciding what action to take in\n            my case. . . . If I have matters that I wish\n            the convening authority to consider, . . .\n            such matters must be submitted within 10\n            days after I or my counsel receive a copy of\n            the record of trial . . . .\n\n      b.   Trial and Sentencing\n\n      On December 16, 2003, in Tikrit, a special court-martial\n\nconsisting of a military judge sitting alone adjudged the\n\nsentence in Appellant’s case.     The sentence included eight\n\nmonths of confinement.\n\n      c.   Appellant’s Memorandum to the Convening Authority\n\n      On January 1, 2004, Appellant submitted a memorandum to the\n\nconvening authority requesting approval of an administrative\n\ndischarge or reduction of confinement to no more than four\n\nmonths.    Appellant’s request was typed on “United States Army\n\n\n                                   5\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nTrial Defense Service” letterhead, with the image of the\n\nDepartment of Defense symbol and the reply address of the Trial\n\nDefense Service.\n\n     In his two-page memorandum, Appellant admitted having made\n\nmistakes in his life, and accepted responsibility for the crimes\n\nhe committed.   He told the convening authority that he wrote the\n\nletter not to make excuses, but to ask for clemency.    He\n\ndescribed his difficult childhood and the abuse he suffered in\n\nfoster homes.   Appellant discussed his decision to join the\n\nmilitary, and the happiness he found in the Army.    Finally, he\n\ntold the convening authority that he was ready to excel again in\n\nthe civilian world, and that approval of his request for a post-\n\ntrial administrative discharge or reduction of confinement would\n\ngive him the head start he needed.    Appellant concluded by\n\nthanking the convening authority for reading his letter.\n\n     The January 1 memorandum did not mention the conditions of\n\nAppellant’s confinement.    The memorandum did not indicate that\n\nhe was incarcerated with enemy prisoners, that he was\n\nincarcerated in irons, or that he had any concerns about health,\n\nor safety, or improper treatment.     Appellant did not indicate\n\nthat he had any difficulty in contacting his lawyer or his unit\n\nduring his incarceration.\n\n\n\n\n                                  6\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n     d.   The SJA’s Post-Trial Recommendation\n\n     The staff judge advocate (SJA) submitted the required post-\n\ntrial recommendation under R.C.M. 1106 to Appellant’s defense\n\ncounsel on January 30, 2004.   The defense counsel acknowledged\n\nreceipt the same day.   The SJA’s post-trial advice recommended\n\napproval of the adjudged sentence except for any confinement in\n\nexcess of seven months, as provided for in the pretrial\n\nagreement.\n\n     e.   Defense Counsel’s Submission to the Convening Authority\n\n     On February 6, 2004, Appellant’s defense counsel submitted\n\npost-trial matters to the convening authority “[p]ursuant to\n\n[R.C.M.] 1105 and 1106 and Articles 38(c) and 60.”   The\n\nsubmission consisted of a two-page memorandum typed on “U.S.\n\nArmy Trial Defense Service” stationary.   The memorandum included\n\nthe Trial Defense Service Tikrit Field Office reply symbol and\n\naddress in Iraq.\n\n     Defense counsel’s memorandum did not request any\n\ncorrections to or changes in the SJA’s post-trial advice.     The\n\ndefense requested that the convening authority approve an\n\nadministrative discharge or, in the alternative, disapprove any\n\nconfinement in excess of four months.\n\n     Defense counsel described Appellant’s background and his\n\nefforts to become a good soldier.    The defense memorandum\n\nattached two stipulations of expected testimony from Appellant’s\n\n\n\n                                 7\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\ntrial in which noncommissioned officers who knew Appellant\n\nvouched for his ability to overcome his troubles.   Defense\n\ncounsel personally offered to discuss Appellant’s case with the\n\nconvening authority, and listed his phone number at Forward\n\nOperating Base Speicher in Tikrit, Iraq.\n\n      f.   The SJA’s Addendum and the Convening Authority’s Action\n\n      The SJA’s Addendum to the post-trial recommendation, dated\n\nMarch 7, 2004, acknowledged Appellant’s R.C.M. 1105 and 1106\n\nsubmissions, and adhered to the original recommendation.     The\n\nconvening authority acted that same day, approving Appellant’s\n\nsentence to confinement for seven months, reduction to Private\n\nE-1, and a bad-conduct discharge.\n\n2.   Proceedings before the Court of Criminal Appeals\n\n      a.   Appellant’s First Affidavit\n\n      On August 9, 2004, while in the State of Texas, Appellant\n\nsigned a four-page affidavit, which he wrote “to accompany” the\n\nappellate brief in his case.   The affidavit described his\n\nconditions of confinement in Tikrit, Iraq, and Camp Arifjan,\n\nKuwait.    Appellate defense counsel included the affidavit as\n\nAppendix A in the brief filed with the Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals.\n\n      The affidavit is the first document in the record in which\n\nAppellant discusses the conditions of his confinement.   The\n\naffidavit describes the first week after his sentence was\n\n\n\n                                  8\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nadjudged, in which he was confined in Tikrit, Iraq.    The\n\naffidavit stated that:   Appellant spent one week confined in\n\nTikrit along with Iraqi prisoners; he was separated from the\n\nIraqis by only a strand of concertina wire, and he was able to\n\nrecognize some of the Iraqi prisoners as having been\n\nincarcerated previously with his unit; he was placed in\n\nhandcuffs and leg irons the entire time he was incarcerated in\n\nTikrit, even while eating and sleeping; he was housed\n\napproximately fifteen feet away from two Iraqi prisoners with\n\ntuberculosis for five days.   The affidavit stated that after one\n\nweek in Tikrit, he was transferred to Camp Arifjan, Kuwait,\n\nwhere he spent the remainder of his seven month sentence in\n\npoorly ventilated conditions, oppressive heat, and\n\nunsatisfactory hygiene and dining facilities.   He was released\n\nin June 2004.\n\n     The affidavit does not mention any attempt on his part to\n\ntalk with prison authorities or his defense counsel about his\n\ntreatment in Tikrit or Kuwait.   The affidavit contains no claim\n\nthat he was discouraged or prevented from complaining about the\n\nconditions of his confinement.   The affidavit contains no\n\nindication as to why he did not raise these matters to the\n\nconvening authority or otherwise file a complaint during the\n\nperiod in which he had the active assistance of defense counsel\n\nin submitting post-trial matters.\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n      b.    Appellant’s Brief to the Court of Criminal Appeals\n\n      Appellant’s brief to the Army Court of Criminal Appeals\n\nalleged cruel and unusual punishment during his incarceration in\n\nIraq and Kuwait.    The defense brief did not address the issue of\n\nexhaustion of administrative remedies, nor did the brief\n\notherwise indicate why Appellant had not complained to military\n\nauthorities requesting relief from the appellate courts.     The\n\nbrief did not claim that trial defense counsel had been\n\nineffective in his post-trial representation of Appellant.\n\n      c.    The Government’s Brief at the Court of Criminal Appeals\n\n      The Government’s Answer at the Court of Criminal Appeals\n\naddressed Appellant’s complaints of cruel and unusual punishment\n\nby asserting Appellant’s failure to exhaust administrative\n\nremedies.    Appellant did not file a reply brief to the Court of\n\nCriminal Appeals and did not file a further affidavit at that\n\ncourt addressing the question of exhaustion.\n\n      d.    The Decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals\n\n      The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed in a summary\n\ndisposition.\n\n3.   Further appellate proceedings\n\n      a.    The Petition for Review\n\n      Appellant sought a grant of review under this Court’s\n\ndiscretionary jurisdiction, Article 67(a)(3), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §\n\n867(a)(3) (2000).    In his petition supplement, Appellant\n\n\n\n                                  10\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nrequested that we grant review of a single issue, whether his\n\nconfinement conditions constituted cruel and unusual punishment\n\nunder Article 55, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 855 (2000), and the Eighth\n\nAmendment to the Constitution.    The Government filed a letter\n\nresponse attaching its brief before the Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals in which it argued that Appellant had failed to exhaust\n\nhis administrative remedies.    Appellant did not address\n\nexhaustion in his petition supplement, and did not file a reply\n\nto the Government’s submission.\n\n     b.   The Grant of Review\n\n     On August 15, 2006, this Court granted review of a modified\n\nissue, asking whether Appellant’s confinement conditions were\n\nunlawful, and “whether, in the context presented, Appellant\n\nforfeited his claims of unlawful post-trial punishment by\n\nfailing to exhaust his administrative remedies.”\n\n     c.   Appellant’s Second Affidavit\n\n     On September 21, 2006, Appellant wrote and signed an\n\naffidavit that, for the first time, addressed exhaustion of\n\nadministrative remedies.   The affidavit stated that he had not\n\nhad any contact with his unit or anyone else during the week\n\nfollowing December 16, 2003, in which he was confined in Tikrit.\n\nHe stated that he had not received normal in-processing in\n\nTikrit, and was not informed how to contact an attorney or how\n\nto raise concerns and complaints.      He stated that when he tried\n\n\n\n                                  11\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nto speak with American personnel he was ignored.   He added that\n\nafter he arrived at the confinement facility in Kuwait he was\n\nallowed to file complaints and raise concerns about the Kuwait\n\nfacility, but was told that he could not complain about the\n\nconditions in Tikrit because it was a different facility.     He\n\nfurther stated that he did not receive any explanation about the\n\nArticle 138, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 938 (2000), grievance process,\n\nand that he did not know what it was, how it worked, or how he\n\ncould use it to address his treatment in confinement.\n\n     The affidavit makes no mention of his submission to the\n\nconvening authority on January 1, 2004, a week after he\n\ncompleted his confinement in Tikrit, nor does the affidavit\n\naddress the representation he received from his defense counsel\n\nover the next two months.   The affidavit offers no explanation\n\nas to why he did not request relief from the convening authority\n\nin his post-trial submission during the period in which he was\n\nreceiving legal representation by trial defense counsel on post-\n\ntrial matters.\n\n     The brief filed by appellate defense counsel likewise is\n\nsilent on these matters.    Appellant has not addressed his\n\nfailure to request redress during the period in early 2004,\n\nimmediately following his time in the Tikrit facility, in the\n\ncontext of the direct communications that he and counsel were\n\nhaving with the convening authority.    The defense brief makes no\n\n\n\n                                 12\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nclaim that combat, field, or operational conditions facing\n\nAppellant and his counsel restricted communications between\n\ncounsel and client, or otherwise inhibited the filing of a\n\ncomplaint during the two-month period following his time in the\n\nTikrit facility when counsel and client were communicating with\n\nthe convening authority.   The defense brief makes no claim of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel either with respect to the\n\nsubmissions to the convening authority or with respect to\n\npreserving Appellant’s rights by seeking redress under Article\n\n138, UCMJ, or otherwise.\n\n\n\n                           II.   DISCUSSION\n\n     The primary focus of the present case is Appellant’s\n\nconfinement in Tikrit during the week after his December 16,\n\n2003, court-martial.   The record demonstrates that in the two-\n\nmonth period following his confinement in Tikrit, Appellant had\n\naccess to counsel, communicated with counsel, and submitted\n\nrequests for sentence relief to the convening authority while he\n\nwas incarcerated.    Appellant’s brief does not explain why he\n\nfailed to request that the convening authority provide him with\n\nsentence credit for illegal confinement, or why he did not have\n\nan adequate opportunity to utilize the assistance of counsel in\n\nobtaining redress.   Since his release from confinement,\n\nAppellant has not asserted that operational conditions or any\n\n\n\n                                  13\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nother circumstances inhibited his communication with counsel\n\nduring the period in which the defense was making submissions to\n\nthe convening authority.   He has not asserted that his defense\n\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to inquire about or pursue\n\nthe conditions of his post-trial confinement.\n\n     The record demonstrates that Appellant had a clear\n\nopportunity to seek relief during the period immediately\n\nfollowing his confinement in Tikrit when he was in communication\n\nwith defense counsel and the convening authority.   The record\n\ndoes not contain an adequate explanation for Appellant’s failure\n\nto do so during that period.   A request for relief at that time\n\nwould have provided the opportunity to create an appropriate\n\nadministrative record of his confinement conditions.   As the\n\nSupreme Court recently observed in Woodford, 126 S. Ct. at 2388,\n\nwitnesses could have been identified and questioned while\n\nmemories were still fresh, and evidence could have been gathered\n\nand preserved.\n\n     Under these circumstances, whether the burden falls on\n\nAppellant or on the Government, the record demonstrates that\n\nAppellant’s claim does not meet the exhaustion of remedies\n\nrequirement.   In that posture, it would be inappropriate to\n\nprovide Appellant with the opportunity to create the record now\n\nthat could have been created near the time of his incarceration\n\nin Tikrit.   Further inquiry into the merits of the claim is\n\n\n\n                                14\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nunwarranted.   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the\n\nmajority’s decision to remand this case for further proceedings\n\non the merits of Appellant’s claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                15\n\f",

On December 16, 2003, he\n\nwas convicted pursuant to his pleas by a military judge sitting\n\nalone of false official statements and wrongful use and\n\ndistribution of controlled substances on divers occasions, in\n\nviolation of Articles 107 and 112a, Uniform Code of Military\n\nJustice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. §§ 907, 912a (2000), respectively.\n\nThe military judge sentenced Appellant to a bad-conduct\n\ndischarge, confinement for eight months, and reduction to grade\n\nE-1.

Unlike the absolute proscription in Article 55,\n\nUCMJ, against flogging and branding, the proscription against\n\nthe use of irons is qualified.   Irons are permitted for the\n\npurposes of safe custody.   As there may be well-founded reasons\n\n\n                                  3\n\fUnited States v.

Further, he states that two of\n\nthe EPWs had tuberculosis and were quarantined from the others,\n\nbut were separated from Appellant by no more than fifteen feet\n\nand one coil of concertina wire.\n\n     Appellant states that he was ordered to wear a blue\n\njumpsuit, similar to the one worn by many of the EPWs.      He also\n\nasserts that for the seven days he remained confined in “the\n\ncage,” he was kept in “double irons” -- leg shackles and\n\nhandcuffs -- even while eating and sleeping.      The handcuffs were\n\nonly removed when he was taken to the latrine.\n\n     After a week, Appellant was transferred to a confinement\n\nfacility at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, where he served the remainder\n\nof his sentence before returning to the United States.\n\n     Appellant argues that the conditions of his post-trial\n\nconfinement violated his rights.       In particular, with respect to\n\n\n\nindividuals referenced are appropriately referenced as EPWs,\n“other foreign nationals,” or in some other manner.\n\n                                   6\n\fUnited States v.

See, e.g., United States v.\n\nWhite, No. ACM 33583, 1999 CCA LEXIS 220, at *4, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">605616</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(A.F.

App. July 23, 1999) (holding that solely raising\n\nconditions of confinement complaints in post-release clemency\n\nsubmissions is inadequate to fulfill the requirement of\n\nexhausting administrative remedies and that “after the appellant\n\nhas been released from confinement . . . we have no remedy to\n\nprovide”), aff’d, White, 54 M.J. at 475.\n\n     In the current case, there is no record of Appellant filing\n\ncomplaints about his confinement conditions while in “the cage,”\n\neither through a prisoner grievance system or to his chain of\n\ncommand under Article 138, UCMJ.       Even when Appellant was\n\nremoved from the confinement area and transported to Kuwait,\n\ncomplaints regarding his confinement conditions in Iraq were\n\nstill not raised.   Pursuant to Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.)\n\n1105(b)(2)(D), Appellant submitted a clemency request on January\n\n1, 2004, less than a week after his removal from the confinement\n\narea in Tikrit.   In that request he did not reference the\n\nconditions in Tikrit.   Appellant’s counsel also did not raise\n\n\n\n                                   9\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nthe matter in an additional clemency submission filed February\n\n6, 2004.\n\n     However, Appellant states that he raised concerns about\n\nconfinement early during the course of his legal proceedings.\n\nAppellant initially raised this issue immediately after his\n\nconviction and before his confinement.   Worried that he would be\n\nincarcerated with the EPWs, Appellant spoke with his battalion\n\ncommander about his concerns and the commander attempted to\n\narrange for Appellant to be held in his unit area in Tikrit\n\nuntil he could be transferred to a confinement facility to serve\n\nhis sentence.   According to Appellant, his battalion commander’s\n\nsuperior declined and ordered him into “the cage.”   Prior to\n\nincarceration, Appellant was also in contact with other\n\nrepresentatives from his unit and his trial defense counsel, to\n\nwhom he relayed his concerns.   These attempts were also to no\n\navail.\n\n     Appellant further claims that upon being placed in “the\n\ncage,” he was given only a rudimentary in-processing, was denied\n\ncontact with his attorney, and was provided no explanation of\n\nhow to raise complaints.   Appellant also claims that he had no\n\nknowledge of Article 138, UCMJ, procedures and further states\n\nthat he did not believe that he had any way of raising his\n\nconcerns while in “the cage.”\n\n\n\n\n                                10\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n     The present record does not reflect that Appellant’s\n\ncommand in Tikrit had an institutionalized complaint mechanism\n\nspecific to the EPW confinement area, and Appellant’s attempts\n\nto informally communicate with, and complain to, his guards were\n\nmet with silence.   On one of the few occasions that the guards\n\nresponded to Appellant’s concerns -- when Appellant raised his\n\nanxiety about being kept in close proximity to two EPWs who he\n\nwas informed were suffering from tuberculosis -- the guards\n\nspurned his complaints.   Additionally, notwithstanding the\n\npreference for raising the issue while undergoing the alleged\n\nonerous confinement conditions, in this case Appellant was kept\n\nunder the complained-of conditions for only a week, limiting the\n\npossible time during which to complain.\n\n     Appellant also states that he attempted to lodge complaints\n\nabout “the cage” as soon as he was afforded the opportunity to\n\ndo so once he arrived at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait.   He raised his\n\ncomplaints about his treatment in Iraq with the guard force\n\nsupervisor at Camp Arifjan but was told that he could not use\n\nthe Camp Arifjan complaint system to lodge an objection about\n\nhis confinement in another location.    Finally, less than a month\n\nafter being released from confinement and returning to the\n\nUnited States, Appellant swore an affidavit that detailed the\n\nconditions he experienced in Iraq.\n\n\n\n\n                                11\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n     Based on the foregoing, we conclude that in the “unusual”\n\ncircumstances presented, Appellant is entitled to have the\n\nmerits of his claims addressed.    Among other things, Appellant\n\nhas asserted that he made numerous informal attempts to raise\n\nthe conditions of his confinement in Iraq with his chain of\n\ncommand.   Accepting Appellant’s affidavits on their face,\n\nAppellant asserts that he was not briefed on, nor otherwise made\n\naware of, any formal process of complaint at the facility in\n\nTikrit during the first year of combat operations in Iraq.    He\n\nfurther states that his efforts while confined in Kuwait to\n\nraise his concerns were brushed aside.   The Government has\n\nchosen not to factually rebut Appellant’s affidavits.   Those\n\nallegations regarding confinement with EPWs and the use of leg\n\nirons are serious, raise matters of first impression for this\n\nCourt for which there is no extant guidance, and are potentially\n\nsubject to repetition during ongoing combat operations.   In such\n\ncircumstances, we conclude that unusual circumstances warrant\n\nreview of Appellant’s claims, notwithstanding his failure to\n\nexhaust those formal mechanisms of administrative review usually\n\nassociated with permanent and established facilities.\n\n     In reaching this conclusion, we are cognizant that\n\nAppellant was represented by counsel.    Further, defense counsel\n\nwas sufficiently established in the operational setting\n\npresented to file for clemency using letterhead designated “U.S.\n\n\n                                  12\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nArmy Trial Defense Service, Region IX, Tikrit Field Office,\n\nTikrit, Iraq.”   Ordinarily, we would expect competent counsel to\n\nraise confinement concerns like Appellant’s at the time they are\n\nbrought to counsel’s attention, or to indicate as part of the\n\nappellate record, why they were unable to do so in the context\n\npresented.   These factors weigh in favor of a conclusion that\n\nAppellant did not exhaust his administrative remedies.\n\nNonetheless, in our view, it factors into, but does not\n\nultimately change, our conclusion that the better view is that\n\nunusual circumstances warrant consideration of Appellant’s\n\nclaims.    In this regard we note the absence of guidance from\n\nthis Court on the subject of exhaustion in an operational\n\nsetting.\n\nII.   Did the Conditions of Confinement in Tikrit Violate Article\n      12, UCMJ, Article 55, UCMJ, or the Eighth Amendment?\n\n      We now examine the specific aspects of confinement about\n\nwhich Appellant complains.   This Court reviews de novo the\n\nquestion of whether an appellant has been subject to\n\nimpermissible conditions of post-trial confinement in violation\n\nof Article 55, UCMJ, and/or the Eighth Amendment.   White, 54\n\nM.J. at 471.\n\n      Appellant’s initial grievance is that the conditions of\n\nconfinement in Tikrit and then at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait,\n\nsubjected him to conditions that did not meet the standards for\n\n\n\n                                 13\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nthe incarceration of United States Army prisoners set out in the\n\nDep’t of the Army, Reg. 190-47, Military Police, The Army\n\nCorrections System (June 15, 2006) [hereinafter AR Reg. 190-47].\n\nIn this context, we find his complaints regarding his\n\nconfinement in Kuwait without merit4 and turn to the two issues\n\nthat warrant review:   Appellant’s claim of having been\n\nincarcerated in irons and his incarceration in proximity to\n\nenemy prisoners of war during the seven days in Tikrit.\n\n     1.   Appellant’s Incarceration with Iraqi Prisoners of War\n\n     Article 12, UCMJ, provides:     “Confinement with Enemy\n\nPrisoners Prohibited[.]   No member of the armed forces may be\n\nplaced in confinement in immediate association with enemy\n\nprisoners or other foreign nationals not members of the armed\n\nforces.”5 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n4\n AR. 190-47 is a 100-pluspage document detailing the Army\ncorrections program, including the appropriate conditions of\nconfinement for Army inmates. The extensive list includes\ndetails ranging from the physical design of facilities to the\nprovision of “health and comfort supplies” for prisoners. Id.\nat para. 10-9. However, the Army is provided explicit\nflexibility by a provision in the regulation for “field\nexpedient detention cells,” a provision that holds, inter alia,\nthat “[d]etention cells used during field and combat operations\nwill correspond to established . . . standards to the maximum\ndegree possible under existing conditions.”\n5\n We note that para 3-2.e, of AR Reg. 190-47 tracks the language\nof Article 12, UCMJ:\n\n     Incarceration with enemy prisoners of war. Members of the\n     Armed Forces of the United States will not be incarcerated\n     in immediate association with enemy prisoners of war (EPW)\n\n                                14\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n     Interpreting Article 12, UCMJ, is an issue of statutory\n\ninterpretation, which we review de novo, United States v.\n\nMartinelli, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56 (C.A.A.F. 2005), as is the question\n\nwhether Article 12, UCMJ, has been violated.   The interpretation\n\nof Article 12, UCMJ, in this context is an issue of first\n\nimpression.\n\n     A.   Text of the Statute\n\n     The prohibition to which Article 12, UCMJ, is directed is\n\nnot absolute in the sense that flogging or branding is\n\nproscribed in Article 55, UCMJ.    Rather, the prohibition against\n\n“placing” American personnel in association with enemy prisoners\n\nor other foreign nationals is qualified by the nature of the\n\nassociation.   Only “immediate association” is directly\n\nproscribed.    Thus, the interpretation of Article 12, UCMJ, rests\n\non an understanding of not just “association” but of the\n\nparticular type of association to which the article is directed.\n\nAlthough the other terms in Article 12, UCMJ, are\n\nstraightforward and can and should be read in light of their\n\nplain meaning and prior use in our case law, “immediate\n\n\n\n     or other foreign nationals not members of the Armed\n     Services of the United States, unless the EPW or foreign\n     nationals are being detained under military control for\n     suspected or proven criminal conduct.\n\nWe conclude that the stated exception in AR Reg. 190-47 is\ninapposite in this case.\n\n\n\n                                  15\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nassociation” is subject to multiple interpretations.    See United\n\nStates v.

The dictionary defines\n\n“immediate” as “direct” or “proximate.”    Webster’s Third New\n\nInternational Dictionary Unabridged (2002), available at\n\nhttp://unabridged.merriamwebster.com (last visited Apr. 24,\n\n2007).   “Association” is defined as the state of being\n\n“connected” or “combine[d].”   Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate\n\n\n6\n This Court recognizes that the term “immediate association” has\nbeen used in cases referring to Article 13, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §\n813 (2000), and in particular when analyzing whether pretrial\ninmates were inappropriately held with convicted prisoners. In\nthat context, “immediate association” was synonymous with\n“commingling.” See, e.g., United States v. Palmiter, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">90</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 98 (C.M.A. 1985) (Everett, C.J., concurring in the result).\nWhile informative, we find our use of the term in reference to\nArticle 13, UCMJ, inapposite in our discussions of Article 12,\nUCMJ, for two reasons. First, the understanding that the\nprohibition on “commingling” is synonymous with “immediate\nassociation” has become moribund as this Court has followed\ncivilian courts into looking at the intent of jailers, rather\nthan the physical placement of inmates, in determining\nviolations of Article 13, UCMJ. See id. at 95 (majority\nopinion). Second, Congress only saw fit to place “immediate\nassociation” in Article 12, UCMJ, suggesting that there were\nspecial concerns that it wished to address in this regard.\n\n                                16\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nDictionary 110 (9th ed. 1991).     Thus, it appears that Article\n\n12, UCMJ, prohibits United States personnel from being confined\n\nin a manner so that they would be directly connected or combined\n\nwith captured foreign personnel.      Appellant contends that he was\n\nseparated from Iraqi prisoners by only a “single strand of\n\nconcertina wire.”   Yet, even a single strand of wire is not an\n\ninsubstantial barrier and may have prevented Appellant’s\n\n“connection” or “combination” with captured personnel.\n\nConcertina wire is high-strength, spring-steel wire with\n\nmultiple barbs attached at short intervals.

Wires form coils so that when they are unrolled they\n\ntake on a cylindrical shape akin to a concertina.       See id.\n\nPersons handling concertina wire wear heavy reinforced gloves to\n\navoid being cut by the wire.   See id. §§ 4-2.6., 4-6.      The\n\nstandard concertina wire used by the United States military\n\ncreates a cylindrical shape three feet in diameter.      Id. § 4-\n\n5.a.\n\n       In our view, a single strand of concertina wire represents\n\na real boundary between Appellant and foreign personnel.\n\nNonetheless, the fundamental question remains:     what sort of\n\n\n                                 17\n\fUnited States v.

Article 12, UCMJ,\n\nstems from conditions of confinement experienced in World War\n\nII, a still-recent event when the UCMJ was debated in 1950.\n\nDuring that war the various military branches conducted two\n\nmillion courts-martial of United States personnel.     James B.\n\nRoan & Cynthia Buxton, The American Military Justice System in\n\nthe New Millennium, 52 A.F. L. Rev. 185, 187 (2002).    Some\n\n\n                                18\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nAmerican servicemembers who had been convicted in these courts-\n\nmartial had, at times, been held in prisons overseas with\n\nprisoners of war or other enemy nationals.     See Uniform Code of\n\nMilitary Justice:      Hearings on H.R. 2498 Before a Subcommittee\n\nof the House Committee on Armed Services, 81st Cong. 914-16\n\n(1949), reprinted in Index and Legislative History, Uniform Code\n\nof Military Justice (1950) (not separately paginated)\n\n[hereinafter Legislative History].\n\n        The legislation from which Article 12, UCMJ, eventually\n\nderived was initially presented in the House of Representatives,\n\nas a part of the Selective Service Act directed to remediating\n\nthe concerns about United States personnel being confined with\n\nforeign nationals during World War II.     According to testimony\n\nfrom Robert W. Smart, a professional staff member of the House\n\nCommittee on Armed Services at the time, the article was\n\noriginally “brought before the House [by] Mr. [Omar T.] Burleson\n\nof Texas [the previous year during debates on the Selective\n\nService Act, with the sole goal ensuring] that American boys\n\nwere not confined with prisoners of war or other enemy\n\nnationals,” which Representative (Rep.) L. Mendel Rivers, the\n\nvice chair of the Committee stated “[often] happened during the\n\nwar.”    Id. at 914.    Language in line with Rep. Burleson’s\n\namendment was adopted in Article 16 of the Selective Service Act\n\nof 1948, which stated that American servicemen could not be\n\n\n                                   19\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n“confined with enemy prisoners or any other foreign nationals\n\noutside of the continental limits of the United States.”\n\nSelective Service Act of 1948, Pub. L. No. 80-759, § 212, 62\n\nStat. 604, 630 (1948) (emphasis added).\n\n     However, once debate on the UCMJ commenced before the House\n\nCommittee on Armed Services in March 1949, it became evident\n\nthat the breadth of the article’s language could create\n\ndifficulties for military operations overseas.   Felix Larkin,\n\nAssistant General Counsel in the Office of the Department of\n\nDefense, testified before the Committee and asserted that in\n\nmany places “[t]here may not be more than one jail or place of\n\nconfinement.”   Legislative History, supra, at 914.    Thus, if\n\nprisoners of war or enemies were already incarcerated in the\n\nsingle facility, no American could be imprisoned with them, and\n\nvice versa.\n\n     Mr. Larkin and the Committee were especially concerned\n\nabout this language as it pertained to the Navy.   Id. at 914-15.\n\nIf a naval vessel captured an enemy vessel at sea it may have\n\nbeen unable to incarcerate enemy sailors in the ship’s brig if\n\nAmerican sailors were already confined there.    Id.\n\n     This concern led the Committee to propose and the Congress\n\nto adopt the “immediate association” language, which, according\n\nto Mr. Larkin, meant that “you could keep [American and foreign\n\npersonnel] in the same jail [but had to] segregat[e] them in\n\n\n                                20\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\ndifferent cells.”   Legislative History, supra, at 914.      As the\n\ncommentary to the proposed article stated, it was “intended to\n\npermit confinement in the same guardhouse or brig, but would\n\nrequire segregation.”   Id.\n\n     Appellant avers that he was held in a facility that also\n\nhoused Iraqi prisoners of war.   As he recounted, “[t]here were\n\nEPWs in the cage when I was housed there, although we were\n\nseparated by a strand of concertina wire.”    Despite this\n\nbarrier, the Iraqis were close enough for some of prisoners to\n\nattempt to engage Appellant in conversation and for one prisoner\n\nto recognize Appellant, and for Appellant to recognize many of\n\nhis former prisoners.   Moreover, for five of the seven days\n\nAppellant was as close as fifteen feet to two of quarantined\n\nIraqis.\n\n     The situation in forward positions during combat -- as in\n\nthe current case -- is not dissimilar from the hypothetical Navy\n\nship at sea that has captured enemy sailors.   In both cases,\n\ncapacity to house prisoners may be limited and thus placing\n\nforeign and American prisoners in the same facility -- while\n\nensuring some segregation -- is in line with the text as well as\n\nthe spirit and history of Article 12, UCMJ.    Indeed, the\n\nalteration of the text of Article 12, UCMJ, from the original\n\nseen in the Selective Service Act of 1948, reflects that\n\nCongress specifically intended to avoid designating situations\n\n\n                                 21\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nlike the one in which Appellant found himself as per se\n\nviolations of Article 12, UCMJ.\n\n        As Mr. Larkin testified in 1949, the drafters intended\n\nArticle 12, UCMJ, to “prohibit incarceration in close\n\nassociation but not with because ‘with’ has the connotation that\n\nyou could not keep them in the same prison and there may be only\n\none.”    Legislative History, supra, at 915.   The following\n\ntestimonial exchange between Mr. Larkin and Rep. John Anderson\n\nfurther emphasized this point, expanding it to include both\n\nUnited States facilities and “foreign jails”:\n\n        MR. ANDERSON: [I]s there any place in the code that\n        expresses prohibition against confining our men in foreign\n        jails?\n\n        MR. LARKIN: No; but this one prevents them being confined\n        with enemy prisoners of war or foreign nationals not\n        members in the same cell.\n\n             . . . .\n\n        MR. ANDERSON: [U]nder this code, could a commanding\n        officer have an enlisted man . . . confined in a foreign\n        jail?\n\n        MR. LARKIN: Yes, he could, for a short time or whatever\n        time is necessary. But if they are so confined they may\n        not be in immediate association with any [foreign\n        nationals].\n\nId.\n\n        In the only federal case in either the military or civilian\n\nsystems directly addressing this provision, the United States\n\nCourt of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit -- hearing a habeas\n\n\n\n                                  22\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\ncorpus claim -- came to the same conclusion, holding that the\n\n“heart of this prohibition [in Article 12, UCMJ] lies in the\n\nwords ‘in immediate association’ and is not necessarily violated\n\nby the general confinement of the designated classes of\n\nprisoners within the same institution.”   Kuykendall v. Taylor,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"252715\"><a href=\"/opinion/252715/james-v-kuykendall-v-j-c-taylor-warden-united-states-penitentiary/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 481 (10th Cir. 1960).7\n\n     Based on this analysis, and assuming Appellant’s statements\n\nas factually accurate, we conclude that Appellant’s conditions\n\nof confinement while housed in the EPW “cage” did not violate\n\nhis Article 12, UCMJ, rights.8   See Ginn, 47 M.J. at 248 (“[I]f\n\n\n\n7\n The appellant’s Article 12, UCMJ, claim was one of several he\nlodged in his habeas claim, which centered on his mistaken\nbelief that the Naval Reviewing Authority did not have the power\nto change the location of his confinement. Kuykendall, 285 F.2d\nat 480-81. While rejecting the entirety of his petition, the\nreviewing court could find no evidence that any foreign\nnationals were incarcerated in the same facilities in which he\nwas imprisoned (initially the United States Naval Disciplinary\nBarracks, Naval Operating Base, Terminal Island, San Pedro,\nCalifornia, and then the United States Disciplinary Barracks at\nFort Leavenworth), let alone “in immediate association” to the\nappellant. Id. at 481. Regardless, the court’s view on the\nmeaning of Article 12, UCMJ, while not binding, is persuasive\nand instructive.\n8\n Applying Ginn, and assuming Appellant’s affidavits are\naccurate, Appellant has not demonstrated that the conditions to\nwhich he was subjected were “sufficiently egregious” or amounted\nto unnecessary or wanton infliction of pain to give rise to the\npresumption that he was being impermissibly punished. Nor is\nthere evidence that the Government intended to punish Appellant\nby confining him in “the cage” rather than a more formalized\nfacility, or that the Government was “deliberately indifferent”\nto Appellant’s well-being in doing so. As a result, we do not\nfind Article 55, UCMJ, or the Eighth Amendment implicated in\nAppellant’s placement in the confinement area in Tikrit. See\n\n                                 23\n\fUnited States v.

The Government’s segregation of\n\nAppellant from enemy prisoners and other foreign nationals was\n\nmanifest and bona fide, and as a result, if indeed he was\n\nseparated by concertina wire,9 Appellant was not imprisoned in\n\n“immediate association” with foreign personnel.\n\n     2.   Appellant’s Incarceration in Irons\n\n     According to Appellant’s unrebutted affidavit, for the\n\nentirety of his incarceration in the EPW confinement area he was\n\nplaced in double irons, i.e., handcuffs and leg cuffs.     His\n\nhandcuffs were only removed when he was escorted to the latrine.\n\n\n\n\nUnited States v.

For instance, the United States Navy Court of\n\nMilitary Review found that leg irons were appropriately used for\n\nsafe custody when they were placed on a known violent prisoner\n\nwho had recently threatened an officer, and the prisoner was\n\nonly constrained in such a manner for the duration of a two-hour\n\ntransport flight.

Nor are we provided any\n\nevidence that the use of irons was necessary for safe custody.\n\nSuch evidence is dispositive of an Article 55, UCMJ, violation\n\nregarding the use of irons, and once an appellant makes a\n\ncolorable claim that he was put in irons, the burden for\n\nestablishing that an exception to the statute’s prohibitions\n\nwere met falls to the government.

As noted\n\nin the majority’s opinion, the exhaustion requirement promotes\n\ntwo goals:   (1) resolution of grievances at the lowest possible\n\nlevel; and (2) development of an adequate record for judicial\n\nreview.\n\n       The record in the present case demonstrates that Appellant\n\ndid not pursue the opportunities for relief that were available\n\nearly in his period of confinement when he had the assistance of\n\ncounsel.   Further, the record does not establish the unusual or\n\negregious circumstances that would excuse failure to exhaust\n\nunder our case law.   Under these circumstances, I respectfully\n\ndissent from the majority’s decision to remand this case to the\n\nUnited States Army Court of Criminal Appeals for proceedings on\n\nthe merits of Appellant’s claim.\n\n\n\n                           I.   BACKGROUND\n\n  A.    RECENT SUPREME COURT DECISIONS ON EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES\n\n       Recent decisions by the Supreme Court confirm our reliance\n\non the exhaustion doctrine, but call into question our practice\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nof placing the burden on the appellant to demonstrate\n\nexhaustion.\n\n     In Woodford v. Ngo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145635\"><a href=\"/opinion/145635/woodford-v-ngo/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006), the Supreme\n\nCourt underscored the dual purposes of the exhaustion\n\nrequirement in the context of the Prison Litigation Reform Act\n\nof 1995, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (2000).   First, exhaustion creates\n\nan incentive for resolution of claims at the prison level\n\nwithout resort to litigation.   Woodford, 126 S. Ct. at 2388.\n\nSecond, “exhaustion often results in the creation of an\n\nadministrative record that is helpful to the court.   When a\n\ngrievance is filed shortly after the event giving rise to the\n\ngrievance, witnesses can be identified and questioned while\n\nmemories are still fresh, and evidence can be gathered and\n\npreserved.”   Id.\n\n     In Jones v. Bock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145763\"><a href=\"/opinion/145763/jones-v-bock/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 919 (2007), the Supreme\n\nCourt considered which party should bear the burden of proving\n\nexhaustion.   The Supreme Court concluded that failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies is an affirmative defense available to\n\nthe government in civil litigation about prison conditions.     Id.\n\nat 921.   In that context, once a prisoner raises a claim of\n\nillegal punishment, the burden is on the government to prove\n\nfailure to exhaust.   Id.\n\n     Although our prison condition litigation arises in a\n\ncriminal rather than a civil context, we typically have looked\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nto the Supreme Court’s doctrine in such cases to guide the\n\nlitigation of prison condition complaints in the military\n\njustice system.   See, e.g., United States v. Lovett, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">211</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 215 (C.A.A.F. 2006) (relying on Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 834 (1994), to allocate the relative burdens of the parties\n\non the merits of a prison conditions claim).   Our practice of\n\nplacing the burden on an appellant to prove exhaustion is a\n\njudicial doctrine, not specifically required by the Uniform Code\n\nof Military Justice or the Manual for Courts-Martial.      In light\n\nof the Supreme Court’s decision in Jones, 127 S. Ct. at 921, it\n\nis not apparent why the prison condition litigation in the\n\nmilitary should not place the burden on the government rather\n\nthan on the defense to demonstrate a failure to exhaust\n\navailable remedies.\n\n     B.   THE CONVENING AUTHORITY’S POWER TO PROVIDE A REMEDY\n                 FOR ILLEGAL CONFINEMENT CONDITIONS\n\n     The convening authority has broad power to provide relief\n\nfor illegal confinement conditions imposed prior to the\n\nconvening authority’s action on the sentence under Rule for\n\nCourts-Martial (R.C.M.) 1107.   In the course of taking such\n\naction, the convening authority has broad discretion to\n\ndisapprove the sentence in whole or in part, mitigate the\n\nsentence, or change the sentence as long as the severity of the\n\npunishment is not increased.    R.C.M. 1107(d)(1).   The\n\nrequirement for post-trial action on the sentence provides an\n\n\n                                  3\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nopportunity to bring illegal confinement conditions to the\n\nattention of a responsible official, because the convening\n\nauthority is obligated to consider “any matters submitted by the\n\naccused under R.C.M. 1105 or, if applicable, R.C.M. 1106(f).”\n\nR.C.M. 1107(b)(3)(A)(iii).\n\n     The defense counsel’s obligation to serve the post-trial\n\ninterests of his or her client includes a responsibility to\n\nensure that appropriate sentence credits are applied against the\n\nsentence approved by the convening authority.    See David A.\n\nSchlueter, Military Criminal Justice Practice and Procedure §\n\n17-2(B)(7) (6th ed. 2004).   As noted in Schlueter’s treatise,\n\n“defense counsel should be prepared to file any written briefs\n\nor documentation that demonstrate accused’s entitlement to a\n\nsentence credit. . . . [A]ny information about sentence credits\n\nshould be transmitted to the convening authority at an early\n\nopportunity.”   Id.\n\n     The defense has multiple opportunities to present\n\ninformation about confinement conditions to the convening\n\nauthority before the convening authority decides whether to\n\napprove the sentence.   See R.C.M. 1105; R.C.M. 1106; Article\n\n38(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 838(c) (2000); United States v. Fagnan,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">C.M.A.</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">C.M.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195 (1961).   See generally\n\nDavid A. Shaw, The Article 38c Brief:   A Renewed Vitality, Army\n\nLaw., June 1975, at 26.   Given this direct access to the\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nconvening authority, defense counsel “bears a . . . [heavy]\n\nburden of ensuring that the convening authority is aware of\n\nthose matters that indicate that clemency may be warranted.”\n\nSchlueter, supra, at § 17-8(B)(1).\n\n                C.   DEVELOPMENT OF THE FACTUAL RECORD\n\n1.   Trial and post-trial proceedings (December 2003-March 2004)\n\n      a.   The Appellate Rights Memorandum\n\n      Two days before his trial, Appellant signed and initialed a\n\nmemorandum documenting his post-trial rights.    Appellant\n\nacknowledged that:\n\n            I have the right to submit any matters I\n            wish [sic] the convening authority to\n            consider in deciding what action to take in\n            my case. . . . If I have matters that I wish\n            the convening authority to consider, . . .\n            such matters must be submitted within 10\n            days after I or my counsel receive a copy of\n            the record of trial . . . .\n\n      b.   Trial and Sentencing\n\n      On December 16, 2003, in Tikrit, a special court-martial\n\nconsisting of a military judge sitting alone adjudged the\n\nsentence in Appellant’s case.     The sentence included eight\n\nmonths of confinement.\n\n      c.   Appellant’s Memorandum to the Convening Authority\n\n      On January 1, 2004, Appellant submitted a memorandum to the\n\nconvening authority requesting approval of an administrative\n\ndischarge or reduction of confinement to no more than four\n\nmonths.    Appellant’s request was typed on “United States Army\n\n\n                                   5\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nTrial Defense Service” letterhead, with the image of the\n\nDepartment of Defense symbol and the reply address of the Trial\n\nDefense Service.\n\n     In his two-page memorandum, Appellant admitted having made\n\nmistakes in his life, and accepted responsibility for the crimes\n\nhe committed.   He told the convening authority that he wrote the\n\nletter not to make excuses, but to ask for clemency.    He\n\ndescribed his difficult childhood and the abuse he suffered in\n\nfoster homes.   Appellant discussed his decision to join the\n\nmilitary, and the happiness he found in the Army.    Finally, he\n\ntold the convening authority that he was ready to excel again in\n\nthe civilian world, and that approval of his request for a post-\n\ntrial administrative discharge or reduction of confinement would\n\ngive him the head start he needed.    Appellant concluded by\n\nthanking the convening authority for reading his letter.\n\n     The January 1 memorandum did not mention the conditions of\n\nAppellant’s confinement.    The memorandum did not indicate that\n\nhe was incarcerated with enemy prisoners, that he was\n\nincarcerated in irons, or that he had any concerns about health,\n\nor safety, or improper treatment.     Appellant did not indicate\n\nthat he had any difficulty in contacting his lawyer or his unit\n\nduring his incarceration.\n\n\n\n\n                                  6\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n     d.   The SJA’s Post-Trial Recommendation\n\n     The staff judge advocate (SJA) submitted the required post-\n\ntrial recommendation under R.C.M. 1106 to Appellant’s defense\n\ncounsel on January 30, 2004.   The defense counsel acknowledged\n\nreceipt the same day.   The SJA’s post-trial advice recommended\n\napproval of the adjudged sentence except for any confinement in\n\nexcess of seven months, as provided for in the pretrial\n\nagreement.\n\n     e.   Defense Counsel’s Submission to the Convening Authority\n\n     On February 6, 2004, Appellant’s defense counsel submitted\n\npost-trial matters to the convening authority “[p]ursuant to\n\n[R.C.M.] 1105 and 1106 and Articles 38(c) and 60.”   The\n\nsubmission consisted of a two-page memorandum typed on “U.S.\n\nArmy Trial Defense Service” stationary.   The memorandum included\n\nthe Trial Defense Service Tikrit Field Office reply symbol and\n\naddress in Iraq.\n\n     Defense counsel’s memorandum did not request any\n\ncorrections to or changes in the SJA’s post-trial advice.     The\n\ndefense requested that the convening authority approve an\n\nadministrative discharge or, in the alternative, disapprove any\n\nconfinement in excess of four months.\n\n     Defense counsel described Appellant’s background and his\n\nefforts to become a good soldier.    The defense memorandum\n\nattached two stipulations of expected testimony from Appellant’s\n\n\n\n                                 7\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\ntrial in which noncommissioned officers who knew Appellant\n\nvouched for his ability to overcome his troubles.   Defense\n\ncounsel personally offered to discuss Appellant’s case with the\n\nconvening authority, and listed his phone number at Forward\n\nOperating Base Speicher in Tikrit, Iraq.\n\n      f.   The SJA’s Addendum and the Convening Authority’s Action\n\n      The SJA’s Addendum to the post-trial recommendation, dated\n\nMarch 7, 2004, acknowledged Appellant’s R.C.M. 1105 and 1106\n\nsubmissions, and adhered to the original recommendation.     The\n\nconvening authority acted that same day, approving Appellant’s\n\nsentence to confinement for seven months, reduction to Private\n\nE-1, and a bad-conduct discharge.\n\n2.   Proceedings before the Court of Criminal Appeals\n\n      a.   Appellant’s First Affidavit\n\n      On August 9, 2004, while in the State of Texas, Appellant\n\nsigned a four-page affidavit, which he wrote “to accompany” the\n\nappellate brief in his case.   The affidavit described his\n\nconditions of confinement in Tikrit, Iraq, and Camp Arifjan,\n\nKuwait.    Appellate defense counsel included the affidavit as\n\nAppendix A in the brief filed with the Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals.\n\n      The affidavit is the first document in the record in which\n\nAppellant discusses the conditions of his confinement.   The\n\naffidavit describes the first week after his sentence was\n\n\n\n                                  8\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nadjudged, in which he was confined in Tikrit, Iraq.    The\n\naffidavit stated that:   Appellant spent one week confined in\n\nTikrit along with Iraqi prisoners; he was separated from the\n\nIraqis by only a strand of concertina wire, and he was able to\n\nrecognize some of the Iraqi prisoners as having been\n\nincarcerated previously with his unit; he was placed in\n\nhandcuffs and leg irons the entire time he was incarcerated in\n\nTikrit, even while eating and sleeping; he was housed\n\napproximately fifteen feet away from two Iraqi prisoners with\n\ntuberculosis for five days.   The affidavit stated that after one\n\nweek in Tikrit, he was transferred to Camp Arifjan, Kuwait,\n\nwhere he spent the remainder of his seven month sentence in\n\npoorly ventilated conditions, oppressive heat, and\n\nunsatisfactory hygiene and dining facilities.   He was released\n\nin June 2004.\n\n     The affidavit does not mention any attempt on his part to\n\ntalk with prison authorities or his defense counsel about his\n\ntreatment in Tikrit or Kuwait.   The affidavit contains no claim\n\nthat he was discouraged or prevented from complaining about the\n\nconditions of his confinement.   The affidavit contains no\n\nindication as to why he did not raise these matters to the\n\nconvening authority or otherwise file a complaint during the\n\nperiod in which he had the active assistance of defense counsel\n\nin submitting post-trial matters.\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\n      b.    Appellant’s Brief to the Court of Criminal Appeals\n\n      Appellant’s brief to the Army Court of Criminal Appeals\n\nalleged cruel and unusual punishment during his incarceration in\n\nIraq and Kuwait.    The defense brief did not address the issue of\n\nexhaustion of administrative remedies, nor did the brief\n\notherwise indicate why Appellant had not complained to military\n\nauthorities requesting relief from the appellate courts.     The\n\nbrief did not claim that trial defense counsel had been\n\nineffective in his post-trial representation of Appellant.\n\n      c.    The Government’s Brief at the Court of Criminal Appeals\n\n      The Government’s Answer at the Court of Criminal Appeals\n\naddressed Appellant’s complaints of cruel and unusual punishment\n\nby asserting Appellant’s failure to exhaust administrative\n\nremedies.    Appellant did not file a reply brief to the Court of\n\nCriminal Appeals and did not file a further affidavit at that\n\ncourt addressing the question of exhaustion.\n\n      d.    The Decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals\n\n      The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed in a summary\n\ndisposition.\n\n3.   Further appellate proceedings\n\n      a.    The Petition for Review\n\n      Appellant sought a grant of review under this Court’s\n\ndiscretionary jurisdiction, Article 67(a)(3), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §\n\n867(a)(3) (2000).    In his petition supplement, Appellant\n\n\n\n                                  10\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nrequested that we grant review of a single issue, whether his\n\nconfinement conditions constituted cruel and unusual punishment\n\nunder Article 55, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 855 (2000), and the Eighth\n\nAmendment to the Constitution.    The Government filed a letter\n\nresponse attaching its brief before the Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals in which it argued that Appellant had failed to exhaust\n\nhis administrative remedies.    Appellant did not address\n\nexhaustion in his petition supplement, and did not file a reply\n\nto the Government’s submission.\n\n     b.   The Grant of Review\n\n     On August 15, 2006, this Court granted review of a modified\n\nissue, asking whether Appellant’s confinement conditions were\n\nunlawful, and “whether, in the context presented, Appellant\n\nforfeited his claims of unlawful post-trial punishment by\n\nfailing to exhaust his administrative remedies.”\n\n     c.   Appellant’s Second Affidavit\n\n     On September 21, 2006, Appellant wrote and signed an\n\naffidavit that, for the first time, addressed exhaustion of\n\nadministrative remedies.   The affidavit stated that he had not\n\nhad any contact with his unit or anyone else during the week\n\nfollowing December 16, 2003, in which he was confined in Tikrit.\n\nHe stated that he had not received normal in-processing in\n\nTikrit, and was not informed how to contact an attorney or how\n\nto raise concerns and complaints.      He stated that when he tried\n\n\n\n                                  11\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nto speak with American personnel he was ignored.   He added that\n\nafter he arrived at the confinement facility in Kuwait he was\n\nallowed to file complaints and raise concerns about the Kuwait\n\nfacility, but was told that he could not complain about the\n\nconditions in Tikrit because it was a different facility.     He\n\nfurther stated that he did not receive any explanation about the\n\nArticle 138, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 938 (2000), grievance process,\n\nand that he did not know what it was, how it worked, or how he\n\ncould use it to address his treatment in confinement.\n\n     The affidavit makes no mention of his submission to the\n\nconvening authority on January 1, 2004, a week after he\n\ncompleted his confinement in Tikrit, nor does the affidavit\n\naddress the representation he received from his defense counsel\n\nover the next two months.   The affidavit offers no explanation\n\nas to why he did not request relief from the convening authority\n\nin his post-trial submission during the period in which he was\n\nreceiving legal representation by trial defense counsel on post-\n\ntrial matters.\n\n     The brief filed by appellate defense counsel likewise is\n\nsilent on these matters.    Appellant has not addressed his\n\nfailure to request redress during the period in early 2004,\n\nimmediately following his time in the Tikrit facility, in the\n\ncontext of the direct communications that he and counsel were\n\nhaving with the convening authority.    The defense brief makes no\n\n\n\n                                 12\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nclaim that combat, field, or operational conditions facing\n\nAppellant and his counsel restricted communications between\n\ncounsel and client, or otherwise inhibited the filing of a\n\ncomplaint during the two-month period following his time in the\n\nTikrit facility when counsel and client were communicating with\n\nthe convening authority.   The defense brief makes no claim of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel either with respect to the\n\nsubmissions to the convening authority or with respect to\n\npreserving Appellant’s rights by seeking redress under Article\n\n138, UCMJ, or otherwise.\n\n\n\n                           II.   DISCUSSION\n\n     The primary focus of the present case is Appellant’s\n\nconfinement in Tikrit during the week after his December 16,\n\n2003, court-martial.   The record demonstrates that in the two-\n\nmonth period following his confinement in Tikrit, Appellant had\n\naccess to counsel, communicated with counsel, and submitted\n\nrequests for sentence relief to the convening authority while he\n\nwas incarcerated.    Appellant’s brief does not explain why he\n\nfailed to request that the convening authority provide him with\n\nsentence credit for illegal confinement, or why he did not have\n\nan adequate opportunity to utilize the assistance of counsel in\n\nobtaining redress.   Since his release from confinement,\n\nAppellant has not asserted that operational conditions or any\n\n\n\n                                  13\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nother circumstances inhibited his communication with counsel\n\nduring the period in which the defense was making submissions to\n\nthe convening authority.   He has not asserted that his defense\n\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to inquire about or pursue\n\nthe conditions of his post-trial confinement.\n\n     The record demonstrates that Appellant had a clear\n\nopportunity to seek relief during the period immediately\n\nfollowing his confinement in Tikrit when he was in communication\n\nwith defense counsel and the convening authority.   The record\n\ndoes not contain an adequate explanation for Appellant’s failure\n\nto do so during that period.   A request for relief at that time\n\nwould have provided the opportunity to create an appropriate\n\nadministrative record of his confinement conditions.   As the\n\nSupreme Court recently observed in Woodford, 126 S. Ct. at 2388,\n\nwitnesses could have been identified and questioned while\n\nmemories were still fresh, and evidence could have been gathered\n\nand preserved.\n\n     Under these circumstances, whether the burden falls on\n\nAppellant or on the Government, the record demonstrates that\n\nAppellant’s claim does not meet the exhaustion of remedies\n\nrequirement.   In that posture, it would be inappropriate to\n\nprovide Appellant with the opportunity to create the record now\n\nthat could have been created near the time of his incarceration\n\nin Tikrit.   Further inquiry into the merits of the claim is\n\n\n\n                                14\n\fUnited States v. Wise, No. 06-0610/AR\n\nunwarranted.   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the\n\nmajority’s decision to remand this case for further proceedings\n\non the merits of Appellant’s claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                15\n\f</pre>",
