We must also address several issues\nsurrounding the remedies available when such an intrusion proves too great to\nexcuse. Convinced that the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons\nAct (“RLUIPA”) demands less intrusion than Texas exercised in one area, we\n\f                                       No. 07-50632\n\nreverse and remand in part; but, discerning no error otherwise, and taking note\nof the accommodations that Texas has offered the Plaintiff-Appellant Harvey\nLeroy Sossamon, III during the pendency of this appeal, we also affirm in part\nand dismiss some of his claims as moot with instructions to vacate.\n                         I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n       Sossamon is an inmate of the Robertson Unit of the Texas Department of\nCriminal Justice (the “TDCJ”) — Correctional Institutions Division. He alleges\nthat (1) he has been deprived of access to Robertson’s chapel for purposes of his\nChristian worship (the “chapel-use” claim or policy) and (2) while on cell\nrestriction, he was forbidden to attend any worship services at all (the “cell-\nrestriction” claim or policy).\n       Concerning the chapel-use claim, Sossamon provided competent summary\njudgment evidence that he is denied access to Robertson’s chapel for Christian\nworship and that the venues for such worship offered as alternatives to the\nchapel do not have Christian symbols or furnishings, such as an altar and cross,\nwhich “have special significance and meaning to Christians.” This, he insists,\nprevents him from “kneeling at the alter [sic] in view of the Cross, to pray, or\nreceive holy communion in obedience to Christ Jesus[’s] command, to observe the\nLord’s Supper, by Christian ceremony, in remembrance of the divine sacrifice the\nLord God made, for the atonement of plaintiff’s sins at Calvary.” Sossamon\ncontends that even if this were not so, services and Bible study at the alternative\nvenues are frequently interrupted by security personnel or noise from the prison\nyard. He alleges that if worshipers refuse to end their prayer or devotion and\nreturn to work when ordered, they are subjected to harassment and retaliation\nby prison guards, such as by strip searches.1 He surmises that the prison has\n\n\n       1\n        Sossamon does not allege that he has been subjected to a strip search and did not file\nan administrative grievance of this matter to the prison, as required by the Prison Litigation\nReform Act (“the PLRA”).\n\n                                              2\n\f                                       No. 07-50632\n\n“evict[ed] and throw[n] God[] out of his house.” According to Sossamon, this is\nnot so for Muslim prisoners, whom he claims are provided special\naccommodations for worship, along with special meals, that Christians are not.\n       Concerning the cell-restriction claim, Sossamon has provided competent\nsummary judgment evidence that inmates on cell restriction for disciplinary\ninfractions were not permitted to attend religious services at all, even though\nthey were permitted to attend work, to eat, to shower, to have medical lay-ins,\nto attend educational classes, to use the law library, and to participate in other\nsecular activities. On September 15, 2005, Sossamon, who had been found guilty\nof a minor rule infraction, was placed on cell restriction for fifteen days. During\nthat time, he was twice denied permission to attend religious services.\n       Based on these allegations, Sossamon proceeded pro se against the “Lone\nStar State of Texas” and a number of individuals involved in the TDCJ2\n(collectively referred to as “Texas”) under: (1) 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for violations of\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          They are: Christina Melton Crain (Chair of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice),\nCathy Clement (Assistant Regional Director for Region VI of the TDCJ), Brad Livingston\n(Executive Director of the TDCJ), Doug Dretke (former Director of the TDCJ - Correctional\nInstitutions Division; Nathaniel Quarterman, the current Director, automatically replaced\nDretke as the defendant against whom the official-capacity claims are brought, see FED. R. APP.\nP. 43(c)(2)), Reverend R.G. Muphy (Region V Program Administrator for the Chaplaincy\nDepartment, Rehabilitation, and Reentry Programs Director of the TDCJ), Robert Eason\n(Senior Warden of Robertson), Stacy Jackson (Assistant Warden of Robertson), and Paul Klein\n(a volunteer chaplain at Robertson). All were sued in their personal and official capacities.\nSossamon subsequently moved to dismiss all of his TRFRA individual-capacity claims against\nall defendants and to dismiss all claims against Murphy, Jackson, and Klein. Those motions\nwere granted. The notice of appeal erroneously listed those defendants as parties, so they\nappear in our caption, but we note that they are now non-parties over whom we have no\njurisdiction. See Castillo v. Cameron County, Tex., 238 F.3d 339, 349-50 (5th Cir. 2001).\n\n                                              3\n\f                                         No. 07-50632\n\nhis First, Eighth,3 and Fourteenth Amendment rights; (2) RLUIPA;4 and (3) the\nTexas Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“TRFRA”).5 He sought declaratory\nand injunctive relief against the defendants in their official capacities, along\nwith compensatory and punitive damages from them in their official and\nindividual capacities.\n       The parties cross-moved for summary judgment. On the cell-restriction\npolicy, Texas noted that after Sossamon filed a grievance on this issue, the\nwarden at Robertson amended the local cell-restriction policy by allowing\nprisoners at Sossamon’s custody level (G-3) to attend worship services while on\ncell restriction. The Director of the Correctional Institutions Division of the\nTDCJ, Nathaniel Quarterman, submitted an affidavit during the pendency of\nthis appeal advising that the TDCJ has adopted Robertson’s relaxation of the\ncell-restriction policy for all Texas correctional facilities.\n       On the chapel-use claim, Texas concedes that Sossamon — like all other\nprisoners — has been denied access to the Robertson chapel for congregational\nreligious services during the entirety of his incarceration at Robertson. In fact,\nall religious worship is now prohibited at the chapel. The Senior Warden of\n\n\n\n       3\n         The Eighth Amendment claim is completely abandoned on appeal. Mindful of our\nresponsibility to construe pro se filings liberally, see Al-Ra’id v. Ingle, 69 F.3d 28, 31 (5th Cir.\n1995), we nevertheless point out that the claim fails under the test announced in Farmer v.\nBrennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994). Sossamon has not demonstrated that the chapel-use policy\nand the cell-restriction policy deprive him of “the minimal civilized measure of life’s\nnecessities.” Id.\n       4\n           42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc to 2000cc-5 (2006).\n       5\n         TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ch. 110 (Vernon 2007). This claim has been abandoned\non appeal. Again mindful of our duty to construe his briefs liberally, we point out that state\nlaw cannot be the basis on which a federal court either enters an injunction or an award of\nmonetary relief against a state. See Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89,\n117 (1984) (“The reasoning of our recent decisions on sovereign immunity thus leads to the\nconclusion that a federal suit against state officials on the basis of state law contravenes the\nEleventh Amendment.”). As Sossamon dismissed all of his individual-capacity claims under\nTRFRA, we have no need to further discuss them.\n\n                                                 4\n\f                                       No. 07-50632\n\nRobertson, Robert Eason, submitted an affidavit justifying this restriction on\nsafety and security grounds.           He averred that Robertson has a policy of\nphysically segregating prisoners in different buildings based on a number of\nfactors. In addition to assignment based on custody level, the prison attempts\nto suppress gang activity by assignments to different buildings based on gang\naffiliations. Warden Eason contends that allowing prisoners to gather in one\nlocation would undercut his policy of segregating hostile gang members. Also,\nmoving prisoners from building to building taxes the staff and creates security\nrisks, problems that are exacerbated by Robertson’s security-personnel staffing\nlevels, which are typically below authorized strength because the work is\ndifficult and the pay is low. By providing religious services at alternative\nlocations6 — such as in Building 4 of Robertson, where Sossamon is currently\nhoused — prisoners need not be moved from one building to another, thereby\nrelaxing the demands on security personnel and reducing the amount of\ninteraction among segregated prisoners.\n       Warden Eason also averred that the chapel poses special security\nconcerns. Chaplains and religious volunteers would have to walk through\ngroups of prisoners to lead services from the front of the room. If an incident\nwere to occur, the religious personnel could be trapped. The location of the\nchapel in the main administrative building also exposes the non-security\npersonnel of the prison (such as secretaries and support staff) to the risk of an\nincident. Further, the main administrative building has storage spaces that\ncould be used for hiding weapons and contraband. Warden Eason based his\nconcerns in part on his personal experience: While serving as a captain at a\n\n\n\n       6\n         Texas offered competent summary judgment evidence that “numerous hours of\nreligious services and instruction [other than at the chapel] are provided to inmates sharing\n[Sossamon’s] faith.” The district court also found that “it is clear . . . [that prisoners have]\naccess to religious books and materials . . . for the practice of their faith.”\n\n                                               5\n\f                                   No. 07-50632\n\ncorrectional facility, a difficult-to-control riot broke out in a chapel with a design\nsimilar to that of the Robertson chapel.\n      Finally, Warden Eason noted that the Robertson chapel can hold only\naround 75 people at a time, which makes it too small to hold the number of\nprisoners who routinely attend non-Roman Catholic Christian services. Instead,\naccording to Warden Eason, the prison uses the chapel as a library for religious\nbooks, a meeting place for staff, and a facility for teleconferencing. Regarding\nthe merits of Sossamon’s claimed need for access to the chapel, the prison\nchaplain averred that “it is not a basic tenant [sic] of the Christian faith that\nservices must be held in particular locations.”\n      Sossamon replied to Warden Eason’s assertions. In an affidavit, he\ncontended that a number of the non-religious purposes for which the chapel is\nused present the same security risks as would religious services. For example,\nhe contends that the chapel is used for “teaching convicted sexual predators and\nchild molesters how to practice safe sex at TDCJ-sponsored ‘Peer Education’\nclasses.” These classes are taught by a “small petite” female security officer who\nis “left alone with a group of men, and groups of men attending these classes are\nsome times [sic] left unsupervised in the chapel.”          He also contends that\nprisoners “can enter the chapel for marriage seminars that begin on Friday\nafternoon and last until Sunday. During these seminars[,] prisoners[’] wives are\nallowed to spend up to twelve (12) hours inside the chapel with them.” Prisoners\nwho obtain a GED are given a celebration inside the chapel, “including contact\nvisits with free world members of their family and with friends.” Finally, he\nalleges that prisoners are permitted to use the chaplain’s office to make phone\ncalls at night, but not to enter the chapel and pray at the cross.\n      The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants, reasoning\nthat (1) Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity bars Sossamon’s claims for\nmonetary relief from Texas and the defendants in their official capacities, (2) the\n\n\n                                          6\n\f                                        No. 07-50632\n\ndefendants are entitled to qualified immunity from suit for damages in their\nindividual capacities because no violation of Sossamon’s rights occurred, and (3)\nSossamon did not demonstrate that injunctive relief under TRFRA or his federal\nclaims is proper. The district court also refused to appoint counsel. This timely\nappeal followed, and we appointed appellate counsel.\n\n\n                                       II. ANALYSIS\n1.     Mootness\n       a.       Standard of Review\n       We review de novo matters of justiciability, such as mootness, that affect\nour jurisdiction to hear a case.7\n       b.       Merits\n       Texas contends that Sossamon’s claims for injunctive relief based on\nRobertson’s cell-restriction policy are moot because Director Quarterman has\ncertified that Texas has ended the policy of preventing general-population\nprisoners on cell restriction from attending religious services. We were apprised\nof the change in policy and Texas’s argument that Sossamon’s injunctive-relief\nclaims are now moot in a Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j) letter\naccompanied by an affidavit from Director Quarterman. As support for the\nconclusion that its voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct moots the case,\nTexas cites Staley v. Harris County, Texas, in which we held that an appeal\nraising First Amendment challenges to a New Testament Bible monument\nbecame moot after the defendant, Harris County, Texas, removed the\nmonument.8 We further held in Staley that any concern about a possible\n\n\n       7\n           United States v. Lares-Meraz, 452 F.3d 352, 355 (5th Cir. 2006) (per curiam).\n       8\n         485 F.3d 305, 309 (5th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (citing Harris v. City of Houston, 151 F.3d\n186, 189 (5th Cir. 1998) (“[W]e find it beyond dispute that a request for injunctive relief\ngenerally becomes moot upon the happening of the event sought to be enjoined.”)).\n\n                                               7\n\f                                          No. 07-50632\n\nredisplay of the monument in the future was not yet ripe because “there are no\nfacts before us to determine whether such a redisplay might violate the\nEstablishment Clause.”9\n          If the controversy between Sossamon and Texas has resolved to the point\nthat they no longer qualify as “adverse parties with sufficient legal interests to\nmaintain the litigation,” we are without power to entertain the case.10 This\ngeneral rule is subject to several important exceptions however. For example,\nthe voluntary cessation of a complained-of activity by a defendant ordinarily\ndoes not moot a case: If defendants could eject plaintiffs from court on the eve of\njudgment, then resume the complained-of activity without fear of flouting the\nmandate of a court, plaintiffs would face the hassle, expense, and injustice of\nconstantly relitigating their claims without the possibility of obtaining lasting\nrelief.\n          The Supreme Court has recently addressed this exception to mootness. In\nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc., the Court\nsaid that “[i]t is well settled that a defendant’s voluntary cessation of a\nchallenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the\nlegality of the practice.”11          Further, “the standard we have announced for\ndetermining whether a case has been mooted by the defendant’s voluntary\nconduct is stringent: A case might become moot if subsequent events made it\nabsolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be\n\n\n\n\n          9\n               Id.\n          10\n               Lares-Meraz, 452 F.3d at 354 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n          11\n               528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                                 8\n\f                                        No. 07-50632\n\nexpected to recur.”12 This is a “heavy burden,” which must be born by the party\nasserting mootness.13\n       On the other hand, courts are justified in treating a voluntary\ngovernmental cessation of possibly wrongful conduct with some solicitude,\nmooting cases that might have been allowed to proceed had the defendant not\nbeen a public entity14 — a practice that is reconcilable with Laidlaw. Although\nLaidlaw establishes that a defendant has a heavy burden to prove that the\nchallenged conduct will not recur once the suit is dismissed as moot, government\nactors in their sovereign capacity and in the exercise of their official duties are\naccorded a presumption of good faith because they are public servants, not self-\ninterested private parties. Without evidence to the contrary, we assume that\nformally announced changes to official governmental policy are not mere\nlitigation posturing.\n       Under this lighter burden to make “absolutely clear” that the cell-\nrestriction condition cannot “reasonably be expected to recur,” Director\nQuarterman’s affidavit is sufficient. In it, he swears that the he is the party\nresponsible for enforcing administrative directives of the TDCJ, that the\nExecutive Director of the TDCJ revised the relevant administrative directive,\nand that prisoners on cell restriction will now be permitted to attend religious\nservices.         Any claim that Sossamon might be removed from the general\npopulation is too speculative to avoid mooting the case; we cannot foresee how\n\n       12\n            Id.\n       13\n            Id.\n       14\n         See, e.g., Zepeda v. Boerne Indep. Sch. Dist., 294 F. App’x 834, 840 n.9 (5th Cir. 2008)\n(unpublished) (citing McCrary v. Poythress, 638 F.2d 1308, 1310 & n.1 (5th Cir. 1981);\nRagsdale v. Turnock, 841 F.2d 1358, 1365 (7th Cir. 1988); 13A WRIGHT, MILLER & COOPER,\nFEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 3533.7 n.6 (West 2008)). Our case that Zepeda cites pre-\ndates Laidlaw and only cites to a Supreme Court case that dealt with the “capable of\nrepetition, yet evading review” exception, not the voluntary-cessation exception to mootness.\nThe Seventh Circuit case Zepeda cited is on point.\n\n                                               9\n\f                                      No. 07-50632\n\na claim made by a prisoner presenting special security concerns may differ.\nFurther, the fact that the change in policy is now state-wide obviates any\nconcern that local prison officials might change their minds on a whim or that\nSossamon might be transferred to a facility with different rules.\n       We will not require some physical or logical impossibility that the\nchallenged policy will be reenacted absent evidence that the voluntary cessation\nis a sham for continuing possibly unlawful conduct. The good faith nature of\nTexas’s cessation is buttressed by the fact that Sossamon did not obtain relief\nbelow. Had the trial court granted the injunction, we might view any attempt\nto force a vacatur of such a determination (particularly in favor of a pro se\nprisoner) with a jaundiced eye. As things stand, Texas has given Sossamon that\nwhich he did not obtain in the district court and that which there at least existed\na possibility he might not have obtained here. We therefore dismiss as moot\nthose parts of the appeal that relate to Sossamon’s claims for injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief from the erstwhile cell-restriction policy (but not his claims for\ndamages based on the September 2005 enforcement of that restriction) with\ninstructions that the district court vacate these portions of its opinion as well.15\n2.     RLUIPA\n       a.     Standard of Review\n       We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment (and a district\ncourt’s statutory interpretation) de novo, using the same standards as the\n\n\n\n\n       15\n          The rule of automatic vacatur after a finding of mootness on appeal, best expressed\nin United States v.

In 42 U.S.C. §\n2000cc-2(a), Congress granted prisoners permission to “assert a violation of this\nchapter as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate\nrelief against a government.” No decision cited by the parties and none of which\nwe are aware holds that RLUIPA’s “appropriate relief” language fails to confer\nan individual right to pursue declaratory and injunctive relief. We therefore\naddress whether RLUIPA also authorizes suits for damages against (1) RLUIPA\ndefendants in their individual capacities or (2) the state and its officers in their\nofficial capacities, or both. We address each damages question in turn before\naddressing Sossamon’s claims for injunctive and declaratory relief.\n       A number of circuits appear to have assumed that an individual-capacity\ncause of action for damages exists because the courts have conducted, or on\nremand have required that the district court conduct, a qualified immunity\nanalysis.23 Some circuits have also reached the PLRA issue and held that,\nbecause it bars compensatory damages absent physical injury, the question\nabout RLUIPA’s remedial scope is irrelevant.24 Of course, if no private right of\n\n\n       23\n          The Ninth Circuit appears to have assumed that a cause of action for monetary relief\nagainst state actors in their individual capacities exists, but its cases contain no analysis and\nare unpublished. See Campbell v. Alameida, 295 F. App’x 130, 131 (9th Cir. 2008) (mem.)\n(unpublished); Von Staich v. Hamlet, Nos. 04-16011 & 06-17026, 2007 WL 3001726, at *2 (9th\nCir. Oct. 16, 2007) (mem.) (unpublished). The Third Circuit has declined to address the issue.\n Brown v. Dep’t of Corr., 265 F. App’x 107, 111 n.3 (3d Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (unpublished)\n(“We also find it unnecessary to reach the questions whether individuals may be liable for\nmonetary damages under the RLUIPA and whether qualified immunity applies here.”). The\nFourth Circuit noted a split in the district courts over the issue, but did not resolve it. Madison\nv. Virginia, 474 F.3d 118, 130 n.3 (4th Cir. 2006).\n       24\n         See cases cited supra note 23. This is not true as a general proposition, although it\nappears to have been accurate for the case that held as much, i.e., the plaintiffs did not request\nnominal or punitive damages, which are the only damages absent physical injury that the\n\n                                               12\n\f                                        No. 07-50632\n\naction exists against the defendants in their individual capacities, then a\nqualified immunity or PLRA analysis would be unnecessary. In Mayfield v.\nTexas Department of Criminal Justice, the only case in which we have examined\nthis issue, we appeared to countenance the idea that a cause of action exists, but\nthen expressly declined to resolve the issue.25 We will assume that if RLUIPA\ncreates an action against defendants in their individual capacities, then it\nprovides for damages.26 For the reasons that we explain below, we decline to\nfind any authority for individual-capacity actions in the statute.\n       The Eleventh Circuit is the only circuit that has resolved this issue. After\nacknowledging a split in the district courts, Smith v. Allen held that RLUIPA\ndoes not provide for damages from individuals.27 The plain language of RLUIPA,\nhowever, seems to contemplate such relief. Despite providing a cause of action\nfor suits against “a government,” the definition of government provided by the\nstatute is expansive.28 The term “government” means:\n       (i) a State county, municipality, or other governmental entity\n       created under the authority of a State; (ii) a branch, department,\n       agency, instrumentality, or official of an entity listed in [that] clause\n       . . . ; and (iii) any other person acting under color of state law . . . .29\n\n\n\nPLRA does not bar. See Mayfield v. Tex. Dep’t of Criminal Justice, 529 F.3d 599, 605-06 (5th\nCir. 2008).\n       25\n            529 F.3d 599 at 605-06 & n.8.\n       26\n          See Smith v. Allen, 502 F.3d 1255, 1272 (11th Cir. 2007). For example, the Smith\ncourt noted that the Supreme Court has instructed us to “presume the availability of all\nappropriate remedies unless Congress has expressly indicated otherwise” or given guidance\nby a “clear indication of its purpose with respect to remedies.” Id. at 1270 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). There is no clear or express indication in RLUIPA that damages are\nunrecoverable.\n       27\n            Id.\n       28\n            42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-2(a) (2006).\n       29\n            Id. § 2000cc-5 (emphases added).\n\n                                               13\n\f                                          No. 07-50632\n\nSmith acknowledged that this language appears to create a right against state\nactors in their individual capacities.            It even mirrors the “under color of”\nlanguage in § 1983, which we know creates an individual-capacity cause of\naction for damages.30\n       In holding that individuals may nevertheless not be sued for damages\nunder RLUIPA, the Eleventh Circuit added an important gloss to a plain-\nlanguage interpretation of the statute: RLUIPA was enacted pursuant to\nCongress’s Spending Clause power, not pursuant to the Section 5 power of the\nFourteenth Amendment.31 Accordingly, only the grant recipient — the state —\nmay be liable for its violation.32 Spending Clause legislation is not legislation in\nits operation; instead, it operates like a contract,33 and individual RLUIPA\ndefendants are not parties to the contract in their individual capacities.\n       We too conclude that RLUIPA, at least as Sossamon asserts a claim under\nit, was passed pursuant to the Spending Clause,34 and we too follow the same\n\n\n       30\n          See, e.g., Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 172 (1961), overruled on other grounds by\nMonell v. Dep’t of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658 (1978).\n       31\n       See Cutter v.

Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).\n       34\n           Every circuit to consider whether RLUIPA is Spending Clause legislation has\nconcluded that it is constitutional under at least that power. See Madison v. Virginia, 474 F.3d\n118, 124 (4th Cir. 2006) (approving of enactment under the Spending Clause, but not passing\non a Commerce Clause authority); Cutter v. Wilkinson, 423 F.3d 579, 584-90 (6th Cir. 2005)\n(same); Benning v. Georgia, 391 F.3d 1299, 1313 (11th Cir. 2004) (same); Charles v. Verhagen,\n348 F.3d 601, 606-11 (7th Cir. 2003) (same); Mayweathers v. Newland, 314 F.3d 1062, 1066-70\n(9th Cir. 2002) (same). Only the Eleventh Circuit has explicitly held that RLUIPA is Spending,\nnot Commerce, Clause legislation. Smith, 503 F.3d at 1274 n.9. In light of the Supreme\nCourt’s rationale for striking down the prior incarnation of RLUIPA as applied to the states,\nsee Cutter, 544 U.S. at 715 (characterizing City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 532-36 (1997),\nthe case that struck down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), as focusing on the\nabsence of a Commerce Clause underpinning or Spending Clause limitation), we agree with\nthe Eleventh Circuit’s conclusion (and the implicit conclusion of the other circuits by their\n\n                                               14\n\f                                       No. 07-50632\n\nrule for such legislation.35 The legislation/contract distinction makes good sense\n— if a congressional enactment could provide the basis for an individual’s\nliability based only on the agreement of (but not corresponding enactment of\nlegislation by) a state, then important representation interests protected by\nfederalism would be undermined. After passively acquiescing in the regulation\nof its citizens under a federal standard to receive needed funding from Congress,\na state legislature could point its finger at the federal government for tying\nneeded funds to an undesired liability — the regulation or law responsible for\nsuch liability not having been enacted by the state. Congress could reciprocate\nby pointing its finger at the state legislature for accepting the funds and visiting\nliability on its citizens by the state’s own choice, even though the state itself did\nnot enact the law or regulation in question. Such an approach blurs the lines of\ndecisional responsibility; that, in turn, undermines the popular check on both\nstate and federal legislatures. We therefore make explicit that which was\nimplicit in our earlier cases:          Congressional enactments pursuant to the\nSpending Clause do not themselves impose direct liability on a non-party to the\ncontract between the state and the federal government.36 Cases like South\n\n\n\nuniform choice to select the Spending Clause as the most natural source of congressional\nauthority to pass RLUIPA) when there is no evidence concerning the effect of the substantial\nburden on “commerce with foreign nations, among the several States, or with Indian tribes.”\n42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(b)(2).\n       35\n          See Pederson v. LSU, 213 F.3d 858, 876 (5th Cir. 2000) (“Title IX is Spending Clause\nlegislation, and as a statute enacted under the Spending Clause, Title IX generates liability\nwhen the recipient of federal funds agrees to assume liability.” (emphasis added) (citing Rosa\nH. v. San Elizario Indep. Sch. Dist., 106 F.3d 648, 654 (5th Cir. 1997))). In fact, Smith cited\nRosa H. as support for its conclusion. 502 F.3d at 1274.\n       36\n          Cf. Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17 (“The legitimacy of Congress’ power to legislate under\nthe spending power . . . rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accept[ed] the\nterms of the ‘contract.’” (emphasis added)). Perhaps there is an argument to be made that by\naccepting employment in a federally funded state enterprise, a state official becomes a third-\nparty beneficiary to the contract, or knowingly and voluntarily subjects himself to liability.\nSossamon does not make this argument.\n\n                                              15\n\f                                  No. 07-50632\n\nDakota v. Dole, despite its lax approach to indirect legislation (such as requiring\nthat a state itself pass a particular law) under the Spending Clause, were clearly\nintended to prevent — in spirit, if not by doctrine — this type of end-run around\nthe limited powers of Congress to directly affect individual rights.37 To decide\notherwise would create liability on the basis of a law never enacted by a\nsovereign with the power to affect the individual rights at issue. For this reason,\nas a matter of statutory interpretation and to avoid the constitutional concerns\nthat an alternative reading would entail, we decline to read Congress’s\npermission to seek “appropriate relief against a government” as permitting suits\nagainst RLUIPA defendants in their individual capacities.\n      Having concluded that an action under RLUIPA does not exist for\nindividual-capacity claims, we will assume arguendo that an official-capacity\ndamages action exists. Whether or not RLUIPA creates such a cause of action,\nit is barred by Texas’s sovereign immunity. As we noted above, RLUIPA was\npassed pursuant to the Spending Clause. It is therefore not an attempt by\nCongress to abrogate Texas’s sovereign immunity, but to goad Texas to waive its\nsovereign immunity by accepting federal funds conditioned on accepting\n\n\n\n\n      37\n           483 U.S. 203 (1987).\n\n                                        16\n\f                                          No. 07-50632\n\nliability.38 We recently declined to address this issue,39 and there is a circuit\nsplit on the question. In Benning v. Georgia, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that\na state waives its sovereign immunity by participating in RLUIPA’s quid pro\nquo.40        In Madison v. Virginia, the Fourth Circuit reached the opposite\nconclusion.41\n         When deciding the validity of a putative waiver of sovereign immunity\nthrough a state’s participation in a Spending Clause “contract,” we ask whether\nCongress spoke with sufficient clarity to put the state on notice that, to accept\nfederal funds, the state must also accept liability for monetary damages.42 The\nEleventh Circuit did not dwell long on whether the phrase “appropriate relief”\nunambiguously notified Georgia that its acceptance of federal funds was\nconditioned on a waiver of immunity from suit, holding that it did.43 Against a\n\n         38\n          Sossamon’s supplemental brief, prepared by the counsel we appointed him, contends\nthat Texas waived its sovereign immunity for this case by requesting attorneys’ fees in its\nanswer to the original complaint. For this proposition, the brief cites Powell v. Texas\nDepartment of Criminal Justice, 251 S.W.3d 783, 791 (Tex. App.–Corpus Christi 2008, pet.\nfiled). Our waiver inquiry is limited by the Supreme Court to determining whether the state\n(1) expressly consented to suit in federal court, see Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S.\n234, 241 (1985), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Pace v. Bogalusa City Sch.\nBd., 403 F.3d 272, 280 n.29 (5th Cir. 2005) (en banc), or (2) waived its sovereign immunity\nthrough litigation conduct, for example, by voluntarily invoking a federal court’s subject matter\njurisdiction, see Lapides v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., 535 U.S. 613, 619 (2002).\nSossamon makes no claim that a request for attorneys’ fees in an answer is a voluntary\ninvocation of our subject matter jurisdiction like removal, so his Lapides waiver argument fails.\n         39\n         Mayfield v. Tex. Dep’t of Criminal Justice, 529 F.3d 599, 605 n.8 (5th Cir. 2008)\n(“However, circuit courts are currently split on whether RLUIPA provides for a waiver of state\nsovereign immunity. . . .

Halderman44 required more\nspecificity than the quoted language, the Benning court held that “[t]he federal\nlaw in Pennhurst was unclear as to whether the states incurred any obligations\nat all by accepting federal funds, but RLUIPA is clear that states incur an\nobligation when they accept federal funds.”45\n      The Fourth Circuit, we believe properly, continued the analysis where the\nEleventh left off, observing that RLUIPA clearly apprises states that they incur\nan obligation, to wit, amenability to some sort of suit seeking to enforce the\nrights RLUIPA creates; however, the question then becomes, “Which kind?” To\nchoose between deciding whether Virginia knew that the cause of action\nenvisioned by Congress permitted damages (which is what we read Pennhurst\nto require) or only knew that it was subjecting itself to equitable remedies, the\nMadison court turned to the rules of construction found in the Supreme Court’s\nwaiver jurisprudence. The court pointed out that any alleged waiver must be\nstrictly construed in favor of the sovereign. Further, the waiver may not be\nenlarged “beyond what the language requires,” and ambiguities must be resolved\nin favor of immunity.46 With those principles in mind, the opinion concluded\nthat “appropriate relief” is “subject to more than one interpretation,” making the\nlanguage “open-ended and equivocal.”47 This fell short of the requirement that\na textual waiver of immunity must “extend unambiguously to such monetary\nclaims.”48 For the Fourth Circuit, this meant that RLUIPA could not satisfy\nDole’s requirement that the spending condition be unambiguous. We find the\n\n\n      44\n           451 U.S. at 13-14.\n      45\n           Benning, 391 F.3d at 1307.\n      46\n           Madison, 474 F.3d at 131 (citing Lane v.

That is, we must presume that\nCongress intended to afford all ordinary remedies not expressly disclaimed when\nwe interpret the ambiguous language it uses to create a cause of action.49 We\nmay not presume the same when we ask whether a state knowingly waived its\nimmunity from damages when damages are not expressly provided. RLUIPA is\nclear enough to create a right for damages on the cause-of-action analysis, but\nnot clear enough to do so in a manner that abrogates state sovereign immunity\nfrom suits for monetary relief.50 Accordingly, Sossamon’s claims for monetary\nrelief from Texas and its officers in their official capacities are barred.\n       To briefly recap, we hold that whether or not RLUIPA creates a cause of\naction for damages against Texas and the defendants in their official capacities,\nany award of damages is barred by Texas’s sovereign immunity. We also hold\nthat RLUIPA does not create a cause of action against defendants in their\nindividual capacities. Accordingly, we need not address Texas’s PLRA argument\nfor the RLUIPA claims.51\n\n       49\n            See Smith v. Allen, 502 F.3d 1255, 1272 (11th Cir. 2007).\n       50\n            Cf.

That we reached the above\nconclusions for compensatory damages only strengthens the conclusion that punitive damages\nare (1) unavailable against RLUIPA defendants in their individual capacities and (2) barred\nby a state’s sovereign immunity even if RLUIPA intended to permit them.\n       52\n         As discussed above, any claims for prospective relief based on the old cell-restriction\npolicy are moot.\n       53\n            42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a) (2006).\n       54\n            Adkins v.

Kaspar that the uniformity of a burden is nevertheless relevant.61\nThe inquiry is a “case-by-case, fact-specific inquiry,” and we have also considered\nwhether the “rule or regulation . . . directly prohibits” the practice.62\n       The compelling-governmental-interest issue is not in significant dispute\nin this case.       Effective and affordable prison security at the chapel is a\ncompelling governmental interest.63 The phrase “least restrictive means” has its\nplain meaning.\n       Concerning the first question in our RLUIPA inquiry, viz., whether the\nclaim involves “religious activity,” there can be no serious dispute that\nSossamon’s claimed need for access to the chapel and its symbols relates to the\nexercise of his religion. As for the second question, we perceive a genuine issue\nof material fact whether the chapel-use policy creates a substantial burden on\nSossamon’s free exercise.\n\n       58\n            Id.\n       59\n            Id.\n       60\n            42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a) (2006).\n       61\n            Adkins, 393 F.3d at 571.\n       62\n            Id.

One of the clerical affidavits submitted by TDCJ points out\nthat Christianity, on the chaplain’s understanding of it, does not consider these\nacts basic tenets of the faith. But, the chaplain’s understanding is irrelevant\nexcept to the extent that it might call into question Sossamon’s good faith, which\nit does not purport to do. Adkins was quite clear that a practice need not be\ncentral to an adherent’s religion, simply important. No summary judgement\nevidence contradicts Sossamon’s claim that these religious practices are\nimportant to his practice of Christianity. Prison chaplains are not arbiters of the\nmeasure of religious devotion that prisoners may enjoy or the discrete way that\nthey may practice their religion.\n       Texas nevertheless contends that by making alternative venues available\nto Sossamon, he cannot claim that denying him access to the chapel and its\nChristian symbols substantially burdens his religious exercise. This ignores the\nfact that the rituals which Sossamon claims are important to him — without\napparent contradiction — are now completely forbidden by Texas.64 He may go\nto Christian services, but none of those services satisfy his need to perform what\n\n\n\n       64\n           See Greene v. Solano County Jail, 513 F.3d 982, 987-88 (9th Cir. 2008) (clarifying\nthat specific practices of a religion fall within the definition of “any exercise of religion” in\nRLUIPA); Murphy v. Mo. Dep’t of Corr., 372 F.3d 979, 988 (8th Cir. 2004) (“[A] substantial\nburden to free exercise rights may exist when a prisoner’s sole opportunity for group worship\narises under the guidance of someone whose beliefs are significantly different from his own.”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). Smith v. Allen, 502 F.3d 1255, 1277 (11th Cir. 2007), is\nnot to the contrary. There, after a very extensive review of the prisoner’s many requests for\nreligious items, the prison denied the adherent a quartz crystal, but only after the prison\ngranted the adherent “a Thor’s hammer necklace; a candle in his cell; a fern tree; a number of\nreligious ‘runes’ . . . as well as permission to have a designated day of the week to practice his\nOdinism; and permission to recognize four Odinist holidays.” Id. at 1277 n.13 The denial of\nthe quartz crystal, after a back and forth on supporting documentation, is markedly different\nfrom a wholesale denial of what Sossamon claims is core to the practice of his Christianity, at\nleast for summary judgment purposes.\n\n                                               22\n\f                                        No. 07-50632\n\nare apparently important aspects of his free exercise of Christianity, to wit:\n“[K]neeling at the alter [sic] in view of the Cross, to pray . . . .” and the like.\n       In Mayfield, we held that denying runestones to an Odinist created a\ngenuine issue of material fact whether the adherent’s religious exercise was\nsubstantially burdened.65 Faced with a claim that all prisoners were barred\nfrom having similar items for security reasons, the court held that “TDCJ cannot\nuse what is effectively a compelling interest argument to answer the preceding\nquestion of whether Mayfield’s religious exercise is substantially burdened.”66 So\ntoo in this case: The fact that the chapel is off limits to all congregational\nworship does not answer whether Sossamon’s religious exercise has been\nsubstantially burdened. Mayfield is even stronger support for Sossamon because\nthe Mayfield plaintiff was permitted to possess runestones whenever a lay\nvolunteer was available.67 Here, Sossamon is never permitted to engage in\nreligious worship in the chapel, at least according to the summary-judgment\nevidence.\n       Perhaps the best argument in Texas’s favor is that Sossamon is simply\nasking to enjoy some “benefit” or to act in some way “not otherwise allowed.” In\ndebunking Texas’s prison-security argument, Sossamon alleges that other\nprisoners are allowed to use the chapel for secular purposes. Thus, when viewed\nin the light most favorable to Sossamon, chapel access is clearly not something\nthat is generally disallowed or a benefit not generally possessed by prisoners at\n\n\n       65\n            529 F.3d 599, 615-16 (5th Cir. 2008).\n       66\n            Id. at 616.\n       67\n          We also found that genuine issues of material fact existed as to the lay-volunteer\npolicy, which precluded Mayfield from forming a group in which to worship without a volunteer\npresent (volunteers came very irregularly). Id. at 613-15, 617. Texas responded that Mayfield\ncould worship in his cell, but could not possess all of the worship items he contended were\nnecessary. Id. We found that this alternative — solo worship — was inadequate to remedy\nthe burden.

Congregational worship is not generally allowed in the chapel, but\nthe key security factor — physical presence in the chapel of a group of prisoners\nengaged in communal activity — is allowed. The fact that the policy directly\nresponsible for this burden bars all such religious worship (a fact that we noted\nwas not present in Adkins) hardly makes a stronger case for finding no\nsubstantial burden when substantial secular use is made of the facility at issue.\n      Other RLUIPA cases in this circuit have recognized that a genuine issue\nof material fact exists in determining whether refusing to allow a Native\nAmerican to let his hair grow out creates a substantial burden on religious\nexercise.68 Failure to provide kosher food may also constitute a substantial\nburden.69 It is primarily cases in which the small number of available lay\nvolunteers makes religious services less frequent than an adherent would like\n(but still available on a somewhat regular basis) that a neutrally applied policy\ndoes not substantially burden religious exercise.70 In Sossamon’s case, the\nreligious practice that he claims is important to him is denied to him at all\ntimes, whether or not volunteers are present. Accordingly, genuine issues of\nmaterial fact exist on the “substantial burden” question of RLUIPA.\n      If there is (or could be) a substantial burden, the second RLUIPA question\nrequires us to answer whether the substantial burden is nevertheless justified\nby a compelling governmental interest achieved through the least restrictive\nmeans. Texas obviously has compelling governmental interests in the security\nand reasonably economical operation of its prisons, but there are genuine issues\nof material fact as to whether vis-à-vis the chapel it has furthered those interests\nthrough the least restrictive means possible. Sossamon produced competent\n\n\n      68\n           Longoria v. Dretke, 507 F.3d 898, 903 (5th Cir. 2007) (per curiam).\n      69\n           Baranowski v. Hart, 486 F.3d 112, 125 (5th Cir. 2007).\n      70\n           See id. at 124-25; Adkins, 393 F.3d at 571.\n\n                                              24\n\f                                       No. 07-50632\n\nsummary-judgment evidence which, when viewed in the light most favorable to\nhim, reveals that the chapel can be and is safely used for other kinds of prisoner\ngatherings, such as weekend-long marriage training sessions (with outside\nvisitors), sex education, and parties for GED graduates. Texas contends that\nbecause Sossamon is allowed to attend religious services elsewhere, it has\nadopted the least restrictive means of accommodating his religious beliefs\nbecause Texas has not banned Christian worship entirely.71\n       This misses the point. Odinist worship was not banned in Mayfield either;\nthe prison simply made inadequate accommodations for it. Yet we found a\ngenuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the prison had furthered a\ncompelling governmental interest by the least restrictive means. In contrast,\nTexas has banned the kind of Christian worship Sossamon contends is\nindispensable to the exercise of his Christianity — kneeling in front of the cross\nand such. Yet in its brief, Texas does not even engage the issue of other groups\nof prisoners using the chapel. We cannot say that there are no genuine issues\nof material fact about how prison security might be furthered by the chapel-use\npolicy when Texas essentially asks us to accept the conclusional assertion that\na worship service presents significantly more danger than a sex-ed class.\n       Neither can we see why many of the security concerns voiced by Texas\ncannot be met by using less restrictive means, even taking into account cost. For\ninstance, shifts of prisoners, segregated by building, could be permitted to\nworship in the chapel, which would obviate concerns about the mixing of rival\ngangs and seating capacity. Services might be limited to days when fewer\n\n\n\n       71\n           Even this argument fails. For example, Texas could provide a portable altar and a\nportable set of Christian furnishings that could be used for worship in one of the rooms where\ncongregational services are held. Whether that would satisfy Sossamon is uncertain; he does\nseem to contend that services in the chapel itself, which to him is God’s house, are necessary.\nStill, providing a portable altar and Christian symbols at the alternative worship venues would\nrestrict his religious exercise less.\n\n                                              25\n\f                                        No. 07-50632\n\nadministrative personnel are in the main building (say, on Sundays), which\nshould lessen the risk to non-security personnel of a riot and the strain of\nfrequent prisoner movements. Some of these options might not prove feasible,\nand there might be as-yet-unarticulated reasons why Texas must ban worship\nservices in the chapel while nevertheless using it for other prisoner gatherings\n(or that it in fact does not).72 Those issues may be further developed on remand.\n       Concluding that there are genuine issues of material fact in both steps of\nthe strict-scrutiny analysis that RLUIPA instructs us to apply, we reverse the\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of Texas on this claim and remand for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n3.     Section 1983 Claims\n       a.       Standard of Review\n       As with the RLUIPA claims, we review the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment on these claims de novo, applying the same standards as the\ndistrict court and construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-\nmoving party.73\n       b.       Merits\n       Sossamon’s First Amendment claim is, as a practical matter, only relevant\nin this appeal to his individual-capacity-damages claims under § 1983.74\nRLUIPA, by directing that we apply strict scrutiny, makes injunctive relief\neasier for Sossamon to obtain than it would be under the First Amendment. In\nTurner v. Safley, which provides the standard for establishing a First\n\n\n       72\n         Perhaps only prisoners unlikely to create a security concern are permitted in these\nother gatherings, if the other gatherings in fact happen. This would be no excuse for failing\nto permit such low-risk prisoners from using the chapel for worship as well.\n       73\n            Condrey v. SunTrust Bank of Ga., 429 F.3d 556, 562 (5th Cir. 2005).\n       74\n           Section 1983 does not provide a cause of action against states or state employees in\ntheir official capacities for damages. See Will v. Mich. Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 66-67\n(1989).\n\n                                               26\n\f                                       No. 07-50632\n\nAmendment violation in the prison context, the Supreme Court held that so long\nas actions are “reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,”75 they are\nconstitutional. That is an easier showing for Texas to make than that its actions\npass strict scrutiny. We also perceive no remedial differences between RLUIPA\nand the Constitution for purposes of an injunction. But, for the same reasons\nthat summary judgment was improper on Sossamon’s claims for injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief under RLUIPA, we perceive that there are genuine issues of\nmaterial fact going to the reasonableness of Texas’s conduct under even the laxer\nFirst Amendment standard. Should the distinction between the two causes of\naction become important going forward, the district court is free in the first\ninstance to assess anew, after further proceedings, whether the chapel-use policy\nstates a First Amendment violation.\n       As for the individual-capacity claims for damages under the First\nAmendment, we note that the defendants who Sossamon sued enjoy qualified\nimmunity as government actors.76 Whether Sossamon could establish a violation\nof the First Amendment in addition to RLUIPA is not a question that we resolve\ntoday. Instead, we simply note that Sossamon has pointed to no cases that\nrender the defendants’ actions — under either the cell-restriction policy or the\nchapel-use policy — unreasonable in light of clearly established federal law. We\ntherefore affirm on that basis the grant of summary judgment in favor of the\nindividual defendants for the First Amendment claims.\n       Although barely briefed on appeal, Sossamon also claims that the\nprovision of special food and religious accommodations to Muslim prisoners\nviolates the Equal Protection Clause. But, for such a claim to succeed, Sossamon\n\n       75\n            482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987).\n       76\n          See Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 205-06 (1996) (“[T]he qualified immunity\ndefense shield[s] [government agents] from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct\ndoes not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable\nperson would have known.” (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original)).\n\n                                              27\n\f                                        No. 07-50632\n\nmust prove “purposeful discrimination resulting in a discriminatory effect among\npersons similarly situated.”77 Turner applies in the equal protection context, and\nnot “every religious sect or group within a prison — however few in numbers —\nmust have identical facilities or personnel.”78\n       Other than alleging that Muslim prisoners receive special meals and\nreligious accommodations (requests for which are handled under a consent\ndecree entered into for past discrimination against them),79 Sossamon has\nmarshaled absolutely no evidence in support of his equal protection claim. Even\nwithout the consent decree as an explanation, he fails to allege anything but the\n“bald, unsupported, conclusional allegations that defendants purposefully\ndiscriminated against him” that we found inadequate in Adkins.80 These claims\nare without merit, so summary judgment in favor of the defendants was proper.\n                                   III. CONCLUSION\n       For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment to Texas and the other defendants on Sossamon’s RLUIPA\nand First Amendment claims for declaratory and injunctive relief arising out of\nthe chapel-use policy and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion. We DISMISS AS MOOT so much of the appeal as relates to Sossamon’s\nclaims for injunctive and declaratory relief based on the cell-restriction policy\nwith instructions that the district court VACATE those portions of its opinion as\nwell. Otherwise, we AFFIRM the grant of summary judgment in favor of Texas\nand the defendants in their official and individual capacities on all (1) claims\n\n\n\n       77\n            Adkins v.

We must also address several issues\nsurrounding the remedies available when such an intrusion proves too great to\nexcuse. Convinced that the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons\nAct (“RLUIPA”) demands less intrusion than Texas exercised in one area, we\n\f                                       No. 07-50632\n\nreverse and remand in part; but, discerning no error otherwise, and taking note\nof the accommodations that Texas has offered the Plaintiff-Appellant Harvey\nLeroy Sossamon, III during the pendency of this appeal, we also affirm in part\nand dismiss some of his claims as moot with instructions to vacate.\n                         I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n       Sossamon is an inmate of the Robertson Unit of the Texas Department of\nCriminal Justice (the “TDCJ”) — Correctional Institutions Division. He alleges\nthat (1) he has been deprived of access to Robertson’s chapel for purposes of his\nChristian worship (the “chapel-use” claim or policy) and (2) while on cell\nrestriction, he was forbidden to attend any worship services at all (the “cell-\nrestriction” claim or policy).\n       Concerning the chapel-use claim, Sossamon provided competent summary\njudgment evidence that he is denied access to Robertson’s chapel for Christian\nworship and that the venues for such worship offered as alternatives to the\nchapel do not have Christian symbols or furnishings, such as an altar and cross,\nwhich “have special significance and meaning to Christians.” This, he insists,\nprevents him from “kneeling at the alter [sic] in view of the Cross, to pray, or\nreceive holy communion in obedience to Christ Jesus[’s] command, to observe the\nLord’s Supper, by Christian ceremony, in remembrance of the divine sacrifice the\nLord God made, for the atonement of plaintiff’s sins at Calvary.” Sossamon\ncontends that even if this were not so, services and Bible study at the alternative\nvenues are frequently interrupted by security personnel or noise from the prison\nyard. He alleges that if worshipers refuse to end their prayer or devotion and\nreturn to work when ordered, they are subjected to harassment and retaliation\nby prison guards, such as by strip searches.1 He surmises that the prison has\n\n\n       1\n        Sossamon does not allege that he has been subjected to a strip search and did not file\nan administrative grievance of this matter to the prison, as required by the Prison Litigation\nReform Act (“the PLRA”).\n\n                                              2\n\f                                       No. 07-50632\n\n“evict[ed] and throw[n] God[] out of his house.” According to Sossamon, this is\nnot so for Muslim prisoners, whom he claims are provided special\naccommodations for worship, along with special meals, that Christians are not.\n       Concerning the cell-restriction claim, Sossamon has provided competent\nsummary judgment evidence that inmates on cell restriction for disciplinary\ninfractions were not permitted to attend religious services at all, even though\nthey were permitted to attend work, to eat, to shower, to have medical lay-ins,\nto attend educational classes, to use the law library, and to participate in other\nsecular activities. On September 15, 2005, Sossamon, who had been found guilty\nof a minor rule infraction, was placed on cell restriction for fifteen days. During\nthat time, he was twice denied permission to attend religious services.\n       Based on these allegations, Sossamon proceeded pro se against the “Lone\nStar State of Texas” and a number of individuals involved in the TDCJ2\n(collectively referred to as “Texas”) under: (1) 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for violations of\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          They are: Christina Melton Crain (Chair of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice),\nCathy Clement (Assistant Regional Director for Region VI of the TDCJ), Brad Livingston\n(Executive Director of the TDCJ), Doug Dretke (former Director of the TDCJ - Correctional\nInstitutions Division; Nathaniel Quarterman, the current Director, automatically replaced\nDretke as the defendant against whom the official-capacity claims are brought, see FED. R. APP.\nP. 43(c)(2)), Reverend R.G. Muphy (Region V Program Administrator for the Chaplaincy\nDepartment, Rehabilitation, and Reentry Programs Director of the TDCJ), Robert Eason\n(Senior Warden of Robertson), Stacy Jackson (Assistant Warden of Robertson), and Paul Klein\n(a volunteer chaplain at Robertson). All were sued in their personal and official capacities.\nSossamon subsequently moved to dismiss all of his TRFRA individual-capacity claims against\nall defendants and to dismiss all claims against Murphy, Jackson, and Klein. Those motions\nwere granted. The notice of appeal erroneously listed those defendants as parties, so they\nappear in our caption, but we note that they are now non-parties over whom we have no\njurisdiction. See Castillo v.

On the cell-restriction\npolicy, Texas noted that after Sossamon filed a grievance on this issue, the\nwarden at Robertson amended the local cell-restriction policy by allowing\nprisoners at Sossamon’s custody level (G-3) to attend worship services while on\ncell restriction. The Director of the Correctional Institutions Division of the\nTDCJ, Nathaniel Quarterman, submitted an affidavit during the pendency of\nthis appeal advising that the TDCJ has adopted Robertson’s relaxation of the\ncell-restriction policy for all Texas correctional facilities.\n       On the chapel-use claim, Texas concedes that Sossamon — like all other\nprisoners — has been denied access to the Robertson chapel for congregational\nreligious services during the entirety of his incarceration at Robertson. In fact,\nall religious worship is now prohibited at the chapel. The Senior Warden of\n\n\n\n       3\n         The Eighth Amendment claim is completely abandoned on appeal.

As Sossamon dismissed all of his individual-capacity claims under\nTRFRA, we have no need to further discuss them.\n\n                                                 4\n\f                                       No. 07-50632\n\nRobertson, Robert Eason, submitted an affidavit justifying this restriction on\nsafety and security grounds.           He averred that Robertson has a policy of\nphysically segregating prisoners in different buildings based on a number of\nfactors. In addition to assignment based on custody level, the prison attempts\nto suppress gang activity by assignments to different buildings based on gang\naffiliations. Warden Eason contends that allowing prisoners to gather in one\nlocation would undercut his policy of segregating hostile gang members. Also,\nmoving prisoners from building to building taxes the staff and creates security\nrisks, problems that are exacerbated by Robertson’s security-personnel staffing\nlevels, which are typically below authorized strength because the work is\ndifficult and the pay is low. By providing religious services at alternative\nlocations6 — such as in Building 4 of Robertson, where Sossamon is currently\nhoused — prisoners need not be moved from one building to another, thereby\nrelaxing the demands on security personnel and reducing the amount of\ninteraction among segregated prisoners.\n       Warden Eason also averred that the chapel poses special security\nconcerns. Chaplains and religious volunteers would have to walk through\ngroups of prisoners to lead services from the front of the room. If an incident\nwere to occur, the religious personnel could be trapped. The location of the\nchapel in the main administrative building also exposes the non-security\npersonnel of the prison (such as secretaries and support staff) to the risk of an\nincident. Further, the main administrative building has storage spaces that\ncould be used for hiding weapons and contraband. Warden Eason based his\nconcerns in part on his personal experience: While serving as a captain at a\n\n\n\n       6\n         Texas offered competent summary judgment evidence that “numerous hours of\nreligious services and instruction [other than at the chapel] are provided to inmates sharing\n[Sossamon’s] faith.” The district court also found that “it is clear . . . [that prisoners have]\naccess to religious books and materials . . . for the practice of their faith.”\n\n                                               5\n\f                                   No. 07-50632\n\ncorrectional facility, a difficult-to-control riot broke out in a chapel with a design\nsimilar to that of the Robertson chapel.\n      Finally, Warden Eason noted that the Robertson chapel can hold only\naround 75 people at a time, which makes it too small to hold the number of\nprisoners who routinely attend non-Roman Catholic Christian services. Instead,\naccording to Warden Eason, the prison uses the chapel as a library for religious\nbooks, a meeting place for staff, and a facility for teleconferencing. Regarding\nthe merits of Sossamon’s claimed need for access to the chapel, the prison\nchaplain averred that “it is not a basic tenant [sic] of the Christian faith that\nservices must be held in particular locations.”\n      Sossamon replied to Warden Eason’s assertions. In an affidavit, he\ncontended that a number of the non-religious purposes for which the chapel is\nused present the same security risks as would religious services. For example,\nhe contends that the chapel is used for “teaching convicted sexual predators and\nchild molesters how to practice safe sex at TDCJ-sponsored ‘Peer Education’\nclasses.” These classes are taught by a “small petite” female security officer who\nis “left alone with a group of men, and groups of men attending these classes are\nsome times [sic] left unsupervised in the chapel.”          He also contends that\nprisoners “can enter the chapel for marriage seminars that begin on Friday\nafternoon and last until Sunday. During these seminars[,] prisoners[’] wives are\nallowed to spend up to twelve (12) hours inside the chapel with them.” Prisoners\nwho obtain a GED are given a celebration inside the chapel, “including contact\nvisits with free world members of their family and with friends.” Finally, he\nalleges that prisoners are permitted to use the chaplain’s office to make phone\ncalls at night, but not to enter the chapel and pray at the cross.\n      The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants, reasoning\nthat (1) Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity bars Sossamon’s claims for\nmonetary relief from Texas and the defendants in their official capacities, (2) the\n\n\n                                          6\n\f                                        No. 07-50632\n\ndefendants are entitled to qualified immunity from suit for damages in their\nindividual capacities because no violation of Sossamon’s rights occurred, and (3)\nSossamon did not demonstrate that injunctive relief under TRFRA or his federal\nclaims is proper. The district court also refused to appoint counsel. This timely\nappeal followed, and we appointed appellate counsel.\n\n\n                                       II. ANALYSIS\n1.     Mootness\n       a.       Standard of Review\n       We review de novo matters of justiciability, such as mootness, that affect\nour jurisdiction to hear a case.7\n       b.       Merits\n       Texas contends that Sossamon’s claims for injunctive relief based on\nRobertson’s cell-restriction policy are moot because Director Quarterman has\ncertified that Texas has ended the policy of preventing general-population\nprisoners on cell restriction from attending religious services. We were apprised\nof the change in policy and Texas’s argument that Sossamon’s injunctive-relief\nclaims are now moot in a Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j) letter\naccompanied by an affidavit from Director Quarterman. As support for the\nconclusion that its voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct moots the case,\nTexas cites Staley v. Harris County, Texas, in which we held that an appeal\nraising First Amendment challenges to a New Testament Bible monument\nbecame moot after the defendant, Harris County, Texas, removed the\nmonument.8 We further held in Staley that any concern about a possible\n\n\n       7\n           United States v.

For example,\nthe voluntary cessation of a complained-of activity by a defendant ordinarily\ndoes not moot a case: If defendants could eject plaintiffs from court on the eve of\njudgment, then resume the complained-of activity without fear of flouting the\nmandate of a court, plaintiffs would face the hassle, expense, and injustice of\nconstantly relitigating their claims without the possibility of obtaining lasting\nrelief.\n          The Supreme Court has recently addressed this exception to mootness. In\nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc., the Court\nsaid that “[i]t is well settled that a defendant’s voluntary cessation of a\nchallenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the\nlegality of the practice.”11          Further, “the standard we have announced for\ndetermining whether a case has been mooted by the defendant’s voluntary\nconduct is stringent: A case might become moot if subsequent events made it\nabsolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be\n\n\n\n\n          9\n               Id.\n          10\n               Lares-Meraz, 452 F.3d at 354 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n          11\n               </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118329\"><a href=\"/opinion/118329/friends-of-earth-v-laidlaw-environmental-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 189 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                                 8\n\f                                        No. 07-50632\n\nexpected to recur.”12 This is a “heavy burden,” which must be born by the party\nasserting mootness.13\n       On the other hand, courts are justified in treating a voluntary\ngovernmental cessation of possibly wrongful conduct with some solicitude,\nmooting cases that might have been allowed to proceed had the defendant not\nbeen a public entity14 — a practice that is reconcilable with Laidlaw. Although\nLaidlaw establishes that a defendant has a heavy burden to prove that the\nchallenged conduct will not recur once the suit is dismissed as moot, government\nactors in their sovereign capacity and in the exercise of their official duties are\naccorded a presumption of good faith because they are public servants, not self-\ninterested private parties. Without evidence to the contrary, we assume that\nformally announced changes to official governmental policy are not mere\nlitigation posturing.\n       Under this lighter burden to make “absolutely clear” that the cell-\nrestriction condition cannot “reasonably be expected to recur,” Director\nQuarterman’s affidavit is sufficient. In it, he swears that the he is the party\nresponsible for enforcing administrative directives of the TDCJ, that the\nExecutive Director of the TDCJ revised the relevant administrative directive,\nand that prisoners on cell restriction will now be permitted to attend religious\nservices.         Any claim that Sossamon might be removed from the general\npopulation is too speculative to avoid mooting the case; we cannot foresee how\n\n       12\n            Id.\n       13\n            Id.\n       14\n         See, e.g., Zepeda v.

The good faith nature of\nTexas’s cessation is buttressed by the fact that Sossamon did not obtain relief\nbelow. Had the trial court granted the injunction, we might view any attempt\nto force a vacatur of such a determination (particularly in favor of a pro se\nprisoner) with a jaundiced eye. As things stand, Texas has given Sossamon that\nwhich he did not obtain in the district court and that which there at least existed\na possibility he might not have obtained here. We therefore dismiss as moot\nthose parts of the appeal that relate to Sossamon’s claims for injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief from the erstwhile cell-restriction policy (but not his claims for\ndamages based on the September 2005 enforcement of that restriction) with\ninstructions that the district court vacate these portions of its opinion as well.15\n2.

In 42 U.S.C. §\n2000cc-2(a), Congress granted prisoners permission to “assert a violation of this\nchapter as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate\nrelief against a government.” No decision cited by the parties and none of which\nwe are aware holds that RLUIPA’s “appropriate relief” language fails to confer\nan individual right to pursue declaratory and injunctive relief. We therefore\naddress whether RLUIPA also authorizes suits for damages against (1) RLUIPA\ndefendants in their individual capacities or (2) the state and its officers in their\nofficial capacities, or both. We address each damages question in turn before\naddressing Sossamon’s claims for injunctive and declaratory relief.\n       A number of circuits appear to have assumed that an individual-capacity\ncause of action for damages exists because the courts have conducted, or on\nremand have required that the district court conduct, a qualified immunity\nanalysis.23 Some circuits have also reached the PLRA issue and held that,\nbecause it bars compensatory damages absent physical injury, the question\nabout RLUIPA’s remedial scope is irrelevant.24 Of course, if no private right of\n\n\n       23\n          The Ninth Circuit appears to have assumed that a cause of action for monetary relief\nagainst state actors in their individual capacities exists, but its cases contain no analysis and\nare unpublished.

In Mayfield v.\nTexas Department of Criminal Justice, the only case in which we have examined\nthis issue, we appeared to countenance the idea that a cause of action exists, but\nthen expressly declined to resolve the issue.25 We will assume that if RLUIPA\ncreates an action against defendants in their individual capacities, then it\nprovides for damages.26 For the reasons that we explain below, we decline to\nfind any authority for individual-capacity actions in the statute.\n       The Eleventh Circuit is the only circuit that has resolved this issue. After\nacknowledging a split in the district courts, Smith v. Allen held that RLUIPA\ndoes not provide for damages from individuals.27 The plain language of RLUIPA,\nhowever, seems to contemplate such relief. Despite providing a cause of action\nfor suits against “a government,” the definition of government provided by the\nstatute is expansive.28 The term “government” means:\n       (i) a State county, municipality, or other governmental entity\n       created under the authority of a State; (ii) a branch, department,\n       agency, instrumentality, or official of an entity listed in [that] clause\n       . . . ; and (iii) any other person acting under color of state law . . . .29\n\n\n\nPLRA does not bar.

Flores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118140\"><a href=\"/opinion/118140/city-of-boerne-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 532-36 (1997),\nthe case that struck down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), as focusing on the\nabsence of a Commerce Clause underpinning or Spending Clause limitation), we agree with\nthe Eleventh Circuit’s conclusion (and the implicit conclusion of the other circuits by their\n\n                                               14\n\f                                       No. 07-50632\n\nrule for such legislation.35 The legislation/contract distinction makes good sense\n— if a congressional enactment could provide the basis for an individual’s\nliability based only on the agreement of (but not corresponding enactment of\nlegislation by) a state, then important representation interests protected by\nfederalism would be undermined. After passively acquiescing in the regulation\nof its citizens under a federal standard to receive needed funding from Congress,\na state legislature could point its finger at the federal government for tying\nneeded funds to an undesired liability — the regulation or law responsible for\nsuch liability not having been enacted by the state. Congress could reciprocate\nby pointing its finger at the state legislature for accepting the funds and visiting\nliability on its citizens by the state’s own choice, even though the state itself did\nnot enact the law or regulation in question. Such an approach blurs the lines of\ndecisional responsibility; that, in turn, undermines the popular check on both\nstate and federal legislatures. We therefore make explicit that which was\nimplicit in our earlier cases:          Congressional enactments pursuant to the\nSpending Clause do not themselves impose direct liability on a non-party to the\ncontract between the state and the federal government.36 Cases like South\n\n\n\nuniform choice to select the Spending Clause as the most natural source of congressional\nauthority to pass RLUIPA) when there is no evidence concerning the effect of the substantial\nburden on “commerce with foreign nations, among the several States, or with Indian tribes.”\n42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(b)(2).\n       35\n          See Pederson v.

Perhaps there is an argument to be made that by\naccepting employment in a federally funded state enterprise, a state official becomes a third-\nparty beneficiary to the contract, or knowingly and voluntarily subjects himself to liability.\nSossamon does not make this argument.\n\n                                              15\n\f                                  No. 07-50632\n\nDakota v.

Whether or not RLUIPA creates such a cause of action,\nit is barred by Texas’s sovereign immunity. As we noted above, RLUIPA was\npassed pursuant to the Spending Clause. It is therefore not an attempt by\nCongress to abrogate Texas’s sovereign immunity, but to goad Texas to waive its\nsovereign immunity by accepting federal funds conditioned on accepting\n\n\n\n\n      37\n           </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111939\"><a href=\"/opinion/111939/south-dakota-v-dole/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987).\n\n                                        16\n\f                                          No. 07-50632\n\nliability.38 We recently declined to address this issue,39 and there is a circuit\nsplit on the question.

The court pointed out that any alleged waiver must be\nstrictly construed in favor of the sovereign. Further, the waiver may not be\nenlarged “beyond what the language requires,” and ambiguities must be resolved\nin favor of immunity.46 With those principles in mind, the opinion concluded\nthat “appropriate relief” is “subject to more than one interpretation,” making the\nlanguage “open-ended and equivocal.”47 This fell short of the requirement that\na textual waiver of immunity must “extend unambiguously to such monetary\nclaims.”48 For the Fourth Circuit, this meant that RLUIPA could not satisfy\nDole’s requirement that the spending condition be unambiguous.

Mayfield is even stronger support for Sossamon because\nthe Mayfield plaintiff was permitted to possess runestones whenever a lay\nvolunteer was available.67 Here, Sossamon is never permitted to engage in\nreligious worship in the chapel, at least according to the summary-judgment\nevidence.\n       Perhaps the best argument in Texas’s favor is that Sossamon is simply\nasking to enjoy some “benefit” or to act in some way “not otherwise allowed.” In\ndebunking Texas’s prison-security argument, Sossamon alleges that other\nprisoners are allowed to use the chapel for secular purposes. Thus, when viewed\nin the light most favorable to Sossamon, chapel access is clearly not something\nthat is generally disallowed or a benefit not generally possessed by prisoners at\n\n\n       65\n            </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"61673\"><a href=\"/opinion/61673/mayfield-v-texas-dept-of-criminal-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 615-16 (5th Cir. 2008).\n       66\n            Id. at 616.\n       67\n          We also found that genuine issues of material fact existed as to the lay-volunteer\npolicy, which precluded Mayfield from forming a group in which to worship without a volunteer\npresent (volunteers came very irregularly).

Congregational worship is not generally allowed in the chapel, but\nthe key security factor — physical presence in the chapel of a group of prisoners\nengaged in communal activity — is allowed. The fact that the policy directly\nresponsible for this burden bars all such religious worship (a fact that we noted\nwas not present in Adkins) hardly makes a stronger case for finding no\nsubstantial burden when substantial secular use is made of the facility at issue.\n      Other RLUIPA cases in this circuit have recognized that a genuine issue\nof material fact exists in determining whether refusing to allow a Native\nAmerican to let his hair grow out creates a substantial burden on religious\nexercise.68 Failure to provide kosher food may also constitute a substantial\nburden.69 It is primarily cases in which the small number of available lay\nvolunteers makes religious services less frequent than an adherent would like\n(but still available on a somewhat regular basis) that a neutrally applied policy\ndoes not substantially burden religious exercise.70 In Sossamon’s case, the\nreligious practice that he claims is important to him is denied to him at all\ntimes, whether or not volunteers are present. Accordingly, genuine issues of\nmaterial fact exist on the “substantial burden” question of RLUIPA.\n      If there is (or could be) a substantial burden, the second RLUIPA question\nrequires us to answer whether the substantial burden is nevertheless justified\nby a compelling governmental interest achieved through the least restrictive\nmeans.

Texas contends that\nbecause Sossamon is allowed to attend religious services elsewhere, it has\nadopted the least restrictive means of accommodating his religious beliefs\nbecause Texas has not banned Christian worship entirely.71\n       This misses the point. Odinist worship was not banned in Mayfield either;\nthe prison simply made inadequate accommodations for it. Yet we found a\ngenuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the prison had furthered a\ncompelling governmental interest by the least restrictive means. In contrast,\nTexas has banned the kind of Christian worship Sossamon contends is\nindispensable to the exercise of his Christianity — kneeling in front of the cross\nand such. Yet in its brief, Texas does not even engage the issue of other groups\nof prisoners using the chapel. We cannot say that there are no genuine issues\nof material fact about how prison security might be furthered by the chapel-use\npolicy when Texas essentially asks us to accept the conclusional assertion that\na worship service presents significantly more danger than a sex-ed class.\n       Neither can we see why many of the security concerns voiced by Texas\ncannot be met by using less restrictive means, even taking into account cost. For\ninstance, shifts of prisoners, segregated by building, could be permitted to\nworship in the chapel, which would obviate concerns about the mixing of rival\ngangs and seating capacity. Services might be limited to days when fewer\n\n\n\n       71\n           Even this argument fails. For example, Texas could provide a portable altar and a\nportable set of Christian furnishings that could be used for worship in one of the rooms where\ncongregational services are held. Whether that would satisfy Sossamon is uncertain; he does\nseem to contend that services in the chapel itself, which to him is God’s house, are necessary.\nStill, providing a portable altar and Christian symbols at the alternative worship venues would\nrestrict his religious exercise less.\n\n                                              25\n\f                                        No. 07-50632\n\nadministrative personnel are in the main building (say, on Sundays), which\nshould lessen the risk to non-security personnel of a riot and the strain of\nfrequent prisoner movements. Some of these options might not prove feasible,\nand there might be as-yet-unarticulated reasons why Texas must ban worship\nservices in the chapel while nevertheless using it for other prisoner gatherings\n(or that it in fact does not).72 Those issues may be further developed on remand.\n       Concluding that there are genuine issues of material fact in both steps of\nthe strict-scrutiny analysis that RLUIPA instructs us to apply, we reverse the\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of Texas on this claim and remand for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n3.

Even\nwithout the consent decree as an explanation, he fails to allege anything but the\n“bald, unsupported, conclusional allegations that defendants purposefully\ndiscriminated against him” that we found inadequate in Adkins.80 These claims\nare without merit, so summary judgment in favor of the defendants was proper.\n                                   III.

We DISMISS AS MOOT so much of the appeal as relates to Sossamon’s\nclaims for injunctive and declaratory relief based on the cell-restriction policy\nwith instructions that the district court VACATE those portions of its opinion as\nwell. Otherwise, we AFFIRM the grant of summary judgment in favor of Texas\nand the defendants in their official and individual capacities on all (1) claims\n\n\n\n       77\n            Adkins v.
