Despite participating in the appraisal\n            process, Cantu was dissatisfied with the award and nonsuited after\n            Southern paid the award and moved for summary judgment. In\n            Southern’s subsequent declaratory action, Cantu challenged the\n            appraisal award based on the original court’s replacement of the\n            first appraisal umpire.\n\n            1.

Cantu did not assert any extra-contractual claims regarding\n                    Southern’s pre- or post-appraisal conduct and is not entitled\n                    to an advisory opinion on the effect of the appraisal award on\n                    hypothetical claims that are now barred.\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS ........................................................................................3\n\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT ........................................................................6\n\n\n\n                                                       ii\n\fARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES ........................................................................6\n\n             A.

Southern agrees with Cantu’s list of parties and counsel, but\n\npresents its own statement of the case, statement of the issues presented, and\n\nstatement of facts.\n\n                                      Statement of the Case\n\n          The lawsuit giving rise to this appeal involves Cantu’s claims under her\n\nSouthern homeowners’ insurance policy for damage resulting from the 2011\n\nBastrop County wildfires.2 Cantu filed suit in Bastrop district court,3 and the court\n\nordered the parties to appraisal. After paying the appraisal award, Southern moved\n\nfor summary judgment.4 Cantu nonsuited this Original Bastrop Suit.5 Southern\n\nfiled the declaratory action underlying this appeal, Cause Number 29,079, in the\n\n335th Judicial District Court of Bastrop County (“Bastrop Dec Action”), the\n\nHonorable Reva Towslee Corbett, presiding, to determine its contractual and\n\n\n\n\n1\n Cantu’s first name is identified in the record as both “Rose” and “Rosa.” Southern uses “Rosa”\nas directed in the Court’s letter of August 27, 2014.\n2\n    R. 5-7. The record for this appeal consists solely of an original clerk’s record [R.].\n3\n Cause No. 28,370; Rose Ena Cantu v.

Despite participating in the appraisal process,\n         Cantu was dissatisfied with the award and nonsuited after Southern\n         paid the award and moved for summary judgment. In Southern’s\n         subsequent declaratory action, Cantu challenged the appraisal award\n         based on the original court’s replacement of the first appraisal umpire.\n\n         1. Cantu did not seek appellate review of the original trial court’s\n            replacement of the appraisal umpire and cannot collaterally attack\n            that court’s orders in a court of concurrent jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n6\n    R. 6-10.\n7\n    R. 532-33.\n8\n    R. 534-35.\n\nAppellee’s Brief                                                                    Page 2\n\f            2.

Don Wittig as umpire.17 Cantu continued to participate in the\n\nappraisal and did not ask the 21st District Court to reconsider its appointment of\n\nJudge Wittig or seek mandamus review of this order. In April 2013, Judge Wittig\n\nand Southern’s appraiser signed an appraisal award.18 After Cantu’s counsel failed\n\nto respond to multiple requests for drafting instructions, Southern tendered a check\n\nfor the full replacement cost value of the appraisal award less the deductible and\n\nprior payments.19\n\n         Following its payment of the appraisal award, Southern filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment, arguing that the payment of the award satisfied Southern’s\n\nobligations under the policy and negated the only bases for Cantu’s extra-\n\ncontractual causes of action.20       Shortly before her response was due, Cantu\n\n\n15\n     R. 255-68.\n16\n     R. 459.\n17\n     R. 273.\n18\n     R. 227.\n19\n     R. 228-36.\n20\n     R. 275-87.\n\nAppellee’s Brief                                                             Page 4\n\fnonsuited the Original Bastrop Suit.21 Cantu did not cash the award check because\n\nshe disputed the validity and binding effect of the appraisal award.22\n\n          Two days after Cantu’s nonsuit, Southern filed the Bastrop Dec Action,\n\nrequesting that the Court declare that:\n\n        (1) The appraisal award signed by Southern’s appraiser and the umpire\n            is valid and binding on the parties with regard to the amount of\n            Cantu’s loss;\n\n        (2) Southern’s payment of the appraisal award fulfills its obligations\n            under the insurance policy with regard to Cantu’s claim; and\n\n        (3) Southern’s liability to pay Cantu’s claim was not reasonably clear\n            until the appraisal award was issued and Southern’s payment was\n            therefore prompt for purposes of Texas Insurance Code sections\n            541.061 and 542.060 and tie-in provisions of the DTPA.23\n\nAfter Southern filed the Bastrop Dec Action, Cantu filed suit in Dallas County,\n\nalleging the same claims and causes of action she had raised in the Original\n\nBastrop Suit and disputing the validity of the appraisal award.24 The Dallas court\n\nabated Cantu’s suit against Southern in favor of the Bastrop court’s dominant\n\njurisdiction over the parties and subject matter.25 Despite the dominant jurisdiction\n\nof the Bastrop court, Cantu did not assert any counterclaims in the Bastrop Dec\n\n\n\n21\n     R. 288.\n22\n     R. 295.\n23\n     R. 6-10.\n24\n     R. 290-315.\n25\n     R. 316-17.\n\nAppellee’s Brief                                                                 Page 5\n\fAction.26 The Bastrop court rendered summary judgment in favor of Southern, and\n\nthis appeal ensued.27\n\n                             Summary of the Argument\n\n         Appraisal awards are presumptively valid and binding. Cantu did not plead\n\nor adduce evidence of any basis to set aside the appraisal award. She could not\n\ncollaterally attack in this suit the former trial court’s decision to appoint a new\n\numpire after the appraisal was complete and she had nonsuited her claims.\n\nBecause Southern promptly paid the appraisal award in full, the trial court\n\ncorrectly ruled that Southern satisfied its contractual and statutory obligations with\n\nrespect to her loss. Cantu is not entitled to an advisory opinion on the effect of an\n\nappraisal award on causes of action she never raised.\n\n                              Argument and Authorities\n\nA.       Cantu cannot collaterally attack a different trial court’s appraisal\n         orders in this suit.\n\n         Cantu’s primary argument is that the court in which she originally filed suit\n\n– the Bastrop 21st District Court – had no authority to replace an appraisal umpire\n\nafter finding Cantu’s counsel had inappropriate communications with that\n\numpire.28 In this case, Cantu complains that the 335th District Court should have\n\n\n26\n     R. 17-22.\n27\n     R. 532-33.\n28\n  Cantu’s assertion that she was denied “due process” in the appointment of a new umpire is\ngroundless. See Appt. Br. at 13. Judge Campbell appointed Judge Wittig as the replacement\n\nAppellee’s Brief                                                                    Page 6\n\finvalidated the appraisal award based on the 21 st District Court’s alleged lack of\n\njurisdiction to replace the umpire. A district court does not have the authority to\n\nreview or invalidate the orders of a court of concurrent jurisdiction.\n\n           The Dallas Court of Appeals recently rejected the same argument by Cantu’s\n\ncounsel.29 In Barrentine, the 423rd District Court of Bastrop County disqualified\n\numpire Ducloux for the same inappropriate contact by plaintiff’s counsel and\n\nappointed Judge Wittig as a replacement.30               The homeowners in Barrentine\n\nnonsuited, refiled in Dallas County, and sought a temporary injunction to prevent\n\nthe appraisal ordered by the Bastrop court from proceeding.31                 On appeal, the\n\nDallas Court of Appeals dissolved the temporary injunction, holding that the\n\ninjunction ignored and unwound the orders of the Bastrop court, which “‘allow[ed]\n\nthe Barrentines to collaterally attack those orders in a court of concurrent\n\njurisdiction.’”32 The Barrentines also sought a writ of mandamus in this Court,\n\n\n\numpire at a hearing on Southern’s motion to compel completion of the appraisal process, which\ncounsel for Cantu attended. A copy of the trial court’s order setting the hearing in which Judge\nCampbell removed umpire Ducloux and appointed umpire Wittig is attached at Appendix A.\nContrary to Cantu’s assertion, the record in Cause No. 28,370 shows that Judge Campbell\nexplicitly removed umpire Ducloux when he appointed Judge Wittig as umpire and then set the\nappraisal deadlines. See Order of January 28, 2013, attached at Appendix B. Southern agrees\nwith Cantu that the Court should take judicial notice of these and other documents from Cause\nNo. 28,370. See Appt. Br. at 14.\n29\n  Safeco Lloyds Ins. Co. v. Barrentine, No. 05-13-01011-CV, 2014 WL 7399307 (Tex. App.–\nDallas Dec. 17, 2014, n.p.h.).\n30\n     Id. at *1; R. 493-500.\n31\n     Barrentine, 2014 WL 7399307 at *1.\n32\n     Id.\n\nAppellee’s Brief                                                                         Page 7\n\farguing that the Bastrop trial court abused its discretion by appointing Judge Wittig\n\nas replacement umpire. This Court summarily denied the petition and the\n\nBarrentines’ motion for rehearing.33\n\n         After Judge Campbell replaced the umpire in the Original Bastrop Suit,\n\nCantu did not ask for reconsideration of this decision or file a petition for writ of\n\nmandamus.34 Instead, Cantu participated in the appraisal process and nonsuited\n\nwhen she was dissatisfied with the appraisal award. She then asked the trial court\n\nin this case to rule on its sister court’s authority to replace the umpire. Judge\n\nCorbett had neither the obligation nor the authority to sit in appellate review of\n\nJudge Campbell’s appraisal orders.35\n\n         Even if the 335th District Court could have reviewed the 21st District Court’s\n\norder to replace the umpire, the 335th District Court did not err in confirming\n\nvalidity of the appraisal. Nothing in the insurance policy or Texas law limited the\n\n21st District Court’s authority to appoint, remove, or replace the appraisal umpire.\n\nAlthough appraisal is intended to take place before suit is filed, Cantu filed suit in\n\nthe 21st District Court, which gave the court jurisdiction over all matters\n\nappurtenant to that suit, including the appraisal. Cantu has cited no authority\n\n33\n See R. 501-31; In re Barrentine, No. 03-13-00752-CV, 2013 WL 6466574 (Tex. App.–Austin\nNov. 27, 2013, orig. proceeding).\n34\n     See Docket Sheet for Cause No. 28,370, attached hereto as Appendix C.\n35\n   Because Cantu is actually attacking the actions of the 21st District Court in replacing the\numpire, she confuses the suit on appeal. See Appt. Br. at 14 (“Entry of the order appointing a\nsecond Umpire was reversible error and an abuse of discretion by the District Court.”).\n\nAppellee’s Brief                                                                       Page 8\n\flimiting that jurisdiction or discretion, and this Court already rejected the same\n\nargument by Cantu’s counsel when it denied the petition for writ of mandamus in\n\nBarrentine.\n\nB.        The appraisal award was valid and binding.\n\n          Cantu further argues that appraisal award was not in compliance with the\n\npolicy because it was not “itemized.”36             An appraisal award is binding and\n\nenforceable if it is in “substantial compliance” with the policy.37 “Substantial\n\ncompliance” means fulfillment of the essential requirements of a contract or a\n\nstatute.38      The Southern policy does not require a particular form for the appraisal\n\naward; appraisers and umpires use different templates for their awards. The award\n\nin this case itemizes the amount of loss for all coverages provided under the\n\npolicy.39 The award is in writing and includes the actual cash value, depreciation,\n\nand replacement cost of the damage to Cantu’s property caused by the fires. The\n\n\n\n\n36\n     Appt. Br. at 14-16.\n37\n   See Wells v. American States Preferred Ins. Co., 919 S.W.2d 679, 683 (Tex. App.–Dallas\n1996, writ denied) (“Texas courts recognize three situations in which an appraisal award may be\ndisregarded: (1) when the award was made without authority; (2) when the award was the result\nof fraud, accident, or mistake; or (3) when the award was not made in substantial compliance\nwith the terms of the contract.”). As discussed supra, Cantu’s argument that umpire Wittig was\nwithout authority to act is really an attack on Judge Campbell’s authority to appoint him. Cantu\ndoes not argue that the award was the result of fraud, accident, or mistake.\n38\n  Wentworth v. Medellin, 529 S.W.2d 125, 128 (Tex. Civ. App.–San Antonio 1975, no writ); see\nalso Harris County Appraisal Dist. v. Bradford Realty, Ltd., 919 S.W.2d 131, 135 (Tex. App.–\nHouston [14th Dist.] 1994, no writ).\n39\n     R. 227.\n\nAppellee’s Brief                                                                         Page 9\n\faward was signed by Southern’s appraiser and the duly-appointed umpire, Judge\n\nWittig.40\n\n           Cantu’s counsel has raised and had the same arguments rejected in another\n\nBastrop wildfire case.41 In response to the carrier’s motion for summary judgment\n\nin Michels, plaintiffs argued that the form of the award was not in substantial\n\ncompliance with the policy because it was not itemized and provided only the\n\nreplacement cost and actual cash value of the loss.42 The district court disagreed\n\nand denied the Michelses’ motion to set aside the award.43 The appellate court\n\naffirmed, holding that the lump sum award substantially complied with the policy’s\n\nrequirements.44\n\n           Cantu’s reliance on Richardson v. Allstate Texas Lloyds,45 is misplaced. In\n\nRichardson, the court held that the entire appraisal process was not in substantial\n\ncompliance with the policy because: (1) the appraisers did not prepare an itemized\n\nlist of damages; (2) the appraisers did not meet to discuss their estimates; (3) the\n\nappraisers did not submit to the umpire the items upon which they did not agree;\n\n40\n     Id.\n41\n     See Michels v.

App.–Dallas July 11, 2007, no pet.).\n\nAppellee’s Brief                                                                         Page 10\n\f(4) the umpire did not discuss the award with both appraisers before it was entered;\n\nand (5) the award was a lump-sum amount written next to the phrase “to be\n\ndetermined by hygienist.”46 The lack of an itemized decision was just one part of\n\nthe wholly flawed process that was not in substantial compliance with the policy. 47\n\n          Appraisal awards “are binding and enforceable, and every reasonable\n\npresumption will be indulged to sustain an appraisal award.”48 Because every\n\nreasonable presumption is indulged in favor of the award, the burden of proof is on\n\nthe party seeking to avoid the award.49 Cantu did not request clarification of the\n\naward and did not adduce any evidence that the appraisal process or award in this\n\ncase was not in substantial compliance with the policy.\n\nC.        Cantu cannot complain about the effect of the trial court’s declarations\n          on extra-contractual causes of action she did not assert.\n\n          Cantu’s final argument is that the trial court erred in holding that Southern’s\n\npayment of the appraisal award foreclosed her bad-faith claims.50 This misstates\n\nthe trial court’s judgment. The trial court declared that Southern’s liability under\n\nthe policy was not reasonably clear until the appraisal award was issued and that\n\nSouthern’s timely payment of the award therefore satisfied the prompt-payment\n46\n     Id. at *2-3.\n47\n     See id. at *4.\n48\n  Franco v.

Her pleadings consisted solely of an\n\nanswer with affirmative defenses to the validity of the appraisal award, a plea to\n\nthe jurisdiction, and a motion to transfer venue to Dallas based on convenience.52\n\nEven if Cantu had bad-faith claims that were not extinguished by Southern’s\n\npayment of the appraisal award, she did not raise them, providing no impediment\n\nto the trial court’s final summary judgment and preserving nothing for this Court to\n\nreview.

Croucher v. Croucher, 660 S.W.2d 55, 58 (Tex.1983). Since\n       fraud, accident, and mistake are affirmative defenses, Western, and not Barnes, had the burden of proof on Jury Question 14.\n          The supreme court has adopted a liberal rule of reference to the construction of points of error contained in appellate briefs,\n          however, (see Pool v. Ford Motor Co., 715 S.W.2d 629, 630 (Tex.1986) (opinion on reh’g), O’Neil v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 542\n          S.W.2d 112, 114 (Tex.1976), and TEX.R.APP.P. 74(p)), and so we will construe an inappropriately phrased point of error as\n          raising a challenge to the factual sufficiency of the evidence. See Muhlbauer v. Muhlbauer, 686 S.W.2d 366, 368\n          (Tex.App.—Fort Worth 1985, no writ).\n3      Barnes claimed that the March 1988 hailstorm damaged two of his properties: the Lamar property, where Barnes maintained\n       offices, and the Thaten property, which was a strip shopping center. Winn’s Variety Stores was one of two tenants located at the\n       Thaten property.\n4      We cannot determine the basis of Thayer’s and Olsovsky’s award because their testimony is not before us.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(4) by continuous or repeated seepage or\n           leakage over a period of weeks, months, years[.]\n5      Slavonic’s motion raises both traditional and no-evidence grounds, and appellants concede the rules do not prohibit a hybrid\n       summary judgment motion such as Slavonic’s.\n6      Appellants did not identify in their special exception (or on appeal) the particular grounds in Slavonic’s motion that lack\n       specificity. We recognize that Slavonic’s motion is not a model of clarity—the motion does not set forth the applicable\n       standards of review under Rule 166a(c) and (i) and does not segregate the traditional from the no-evidence grounds; however,\n       the motion does comply with Rule 166a in stating the grounds and sufficiently puts appellants on notice of the claims and\n       causes of action being challenged by appellees. The better practice is to file two separate motions or to file one document\n       containing both motions but with the arguments and authorities for each clearly delineated and separated from one another. For\n       example, Southland’s motion also was a hybrid, but it clearly segregated the traditional from the no-evidence grounds.\n7      Notably, appellants do not allege a cause of action to set aside the appraisal award in their petition. The claims and facts alleged\n       in appellants’ live petition focus on alleged misrepresentations made by appellees concerning the policy and the alleged\n       mishandling of Franco’s claim. However, despite not having alleged a cause of action to set aside the award, appellants are not\n       barred from raising the issue of the appraisal award’s validity for the first time in their summary judgment response, and this\n       issue was properly before the trial court and is subject to review by this court.

Despite participating in the appraisal process,\n         Cantu was dissatisfied with the award and nonsuited after Southern\n         paid the award and moved for summary judgment. In Southern’s\n         subsequent declaratory action, Cantu challenged the appraisal award\n         based on the original court’s replacement of the first appraisal umpire.\n\n         1. Cantu did not seek appellate review of the original trial court’s\n            replacement of the appraisal umpire and cannot collaterally attack\n            that court’s orders in a court of concurrent jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n6\n    R. 6-10.\n7\n    R. 532-33.\n8\n    R. 534-35.\n\nAppellee’s Brief                                                                    Page 2\n\f            2.

In April 2013, Judge Wittig\n\nand Southern’s appraiser signed an appraisal award.18 After Cantu’s counsel failed\n\nto respond to multiple requests for drafting instructions, Southern tendered a check\n\nfor the full replacement cost value of the appraisal award less the deductible and\n\nprior payments.19\n\n         Following its payment of the appraisal award, Southern filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment, arguing that the payment of the award satisfied Southern’s\n\nobligations under the policy and negated the only bases for Cantu’s extra-\n\ncontractual causes of action.20       Shortly before her response was due, Cantu\n\n\n15\n     R. 255-68.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span>\n     <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span>\n     <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span>\n     <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n19\n     R. 228-36.\n20\n     R. 275-87.\n\nAppellee’s Brief                                                             Page 4\n\fnonsuited the Original Bastrop Suit.21 Cantu did not cash the award check because\n\nshe disputed the validity and binding effect of the appraisal award.22\n\n          Two days after Cantu’s nonsuit, Southern filed the Bastrop Dec Action,\n\nrequesting that the Court declare that:\n\n        (1) The appraisal award signed by Southern’s appraiser and the umpire\n            is valid and binding on the parties with regard to the amount of\n            Cantu’s loss;\n\n        (2) Southern’s payment of the appraisal award fulfills its obligations\n            under the insurance policy with regard to Cantu’s claim; and\n\n        (3) Southern’s liability to pay Cantu’s claim was not reasonably clear\n            until the appraisal award was issued and Southern’s payment was\n            therefore prompt for purposes of Texas Insurance Code sections\n            541.061 and 542.060 and tie-in provisions of the DTPA.23\n\nAfter Southern filed the Bastrop Dec Action, Cantu filed suit in Dallas County,\n\nalleging the same claims and causes of action she had raised in the Original\n\nBastrop Suit and disputing the validity of the appraisal award.24 The Dallas court\n\nabated Cantu’s suit against Southern in favor of the Bastrop court’s dominant\n\njurisdiction over the parties and subject matter.25 Despite the dominant jurisdiction\n\nof the Bastrop court, Cantu did not assert any counterclaims in the Bastrop Dec\n\n\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span>\n     <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span>\n     <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">295</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n23\n     R. 6-10.\n24\n     R. 290-315.\n25\n     R. 316-17.\n\nAppellee’s Brief                                                                 Page 5\n\fAction.26 The Bastrop court rendered summary judgment in favor of Southern, and\n\nthis appeal ensued.27\n\n                             Summary of the Argument\n\n         Appraisal awards are presumptively valid and binding. Cantu did not plead\n\nor adduce evidence of any basis to set aside the appraisal award. She could not\n\ncollaterally attack in this suit the former trial court’s decision to appoint a new\n\numpire after the appraisal was complete and she had nonsuited her claims.\n\nBecause Southern promptly paid the appraisal award in full, the trial court\n\ncorrectly ruled that Southern satisfied its contractual and statutory obligations with\n\nrespect to her loss. Cantu is not entitled to an advisory opinion on the effect of an\n\nappraisal award on causes of action she never raised.\n\n                              Argument and Authorities\n\nA.       Cantu cannot collaterally attack a different trial court’s appraisal\n         orders in this suit.\n\n         Cantu’s primary argument is that the court in which she originally filed suit\n\n– the Bastrop 21st District Court – had no authority to replace an appraisal umpire\n\nafter finding Cantu’s counsel had inappropriate communications with that\n\numpire.28 In this case, Cantu complains that the 335th District Court should have\n\n\n26\n     R. 17-22.\n27\n     R. 532-33.\n28\n  Cantu’s assertion that she was denied “due process” in the appointment of a new umpire is\ngroundless. See Appt. Br. at 13. Judge Campbell appointed Judge Wittig as the replacement\n\nAppellee’s Brief                                                                    Page 6\n\finvalidated the appraisal award based on the 21 st District Court’s alleged lack of\n\njurisdiction to replace the umpire. A district court does not have the authority to\n\nreview or invalidate the orders of a court of concurrent jurisdiction.\n\n           The Dallas Court of Appeals recently rejected the same argument by Cantu’s\n\ncounsel.29 In Barrentine, the 423rd District Court of Bastrop County disqualified\n\numpire Ducloux for the same inappropriate contact by plaintiff’s counsel and\n\nappointed Judge Wittig as a replacement.30               The homeowners in Barrentine\n\nnonsuited, refiled in Dallas County, and sought a temporary injunction to prevent\n\nthe appraisal ordered by the Bastrop court from proceeding.31                 On appeal, the\n\nDallas Court of Appeals dissolved the temporary injunction, holding that the\n\ninjunction ignored and unwound the orders of the Bastrop court, which “‘allow[ed]\n\nthe Barrentines to collaterally attack those orders in a court of concurrent\n\njurisdiction.’”32 The Barrentines also sought a writ of mandamus in this Court,\n\n\n\numpire at a hearing on Southern’s motion to compel completion of the appraisal process, which\ncounsel for Cantu attended. A copy of the trial court’s order setting the hearing in which Judge\nCampbell removed umpire Ducloux and appointed umpire Wittig is attached at Appendix A.\nContrary to Cantu’s assertion, the record in Cause No. 28,370 shows that Judge Campbell\nexplicitly removed umpire Ducloux when he appointed Judge Wittig as umpire and then set the\nappraisal deadlines. See Order of January 28, 2013, attached at Appendix B. Southern agrees\nwith Cantu that the Court should take judicial notice of these and other documents from Cause\nNo. 28,370. See Appt.

This Court summarily denied the petition and the\n\nBarrentines’ motion for rehearing.33\n\n         After Judge Campbell replaced the umpire in the Original Bastrop Suit,\n\nCantu did not ask for reconsideration of this decision or file a petition for writ of\n\nmandamus.34 Instead, Cantu participated in the appraisal process and nonsuited\n\nwhen she was dissatisfied with the appraisal award. She then asked the trial court\n\nin this case to rule on its sister court’s authority to replace the umpire. Judge\n\nCorbett had neither the obligation nor the authority to sit in appellate review of\n\nJudge Campbell’s appraisal orders.35\n\n         Even if the 335th District Court could have reviewed the 21st District Court’s\n\norder to replace the umpire, the 335th District Court did not err in confirming\n\nvalidity of the appraisal. Nothing in the insurance policy or Texas law limited the\n\n21st District Court’s authority to appoint, remove, or replace the appraisal umpire.\n\nAlthough appraisal is intended to take place before suit is filed, Cantu filed suit in\n\nthe 21st District Court, which gave the court jurisdiction over all matters\n\nappurtenant to that suit, including the appraisal. Cantu has cited no authority\n\n33\n See R. 501-31; In re Barrentine, No. 03-13-00752-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6466574</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.–Austin\nNov. 27, 2013, orig. proceeding).\n34\n     See Docket Sheet for Cause No. 28,370, attached hereto as Appendix C.\n35\n   Because Cantu is actually attacking the actions of the 21st District Court in replacing the\numpire, she confuses the suit on appeal. See Appt. Br. at 14 (“Entry of the order appointing a\nsecond Umpire was reversible error and an abuse of discretion by the District Court.”).\n\nAppellee’s Brief                                                                       Page 8\n\flimiting that jurisdiction or discretion, and this Court already rejected the same\n\nargument by Cantu’s counsel when it denied the petition for writ of mandamus in\n\nBarrentine.\n\nB.        The appraisal award was valid and binding.\n\n          Cantu further argues that appraisal award was not in compliance with the\n\npolicy because it was not “itemized.”36             An appraisal award is binding and\n\nenforceable if it is in “substantial compliance” with the policy.37 “Substantial\n\ncompliance” means fulfillment of the essential requirements of a contract or a\n\nstatute.38      The Southern policy does not require a particular form for the appraisal\n\naward; appraisers and umpires use different templates for their awards. The award\n\nin this case itemizes the amount of loss for all coverages provided under the\n\npolicy.39 The award is in writing and includes the actual cash value, depreciation,\n\nand replacement cost of the damage to Cantu’s property caused by the fires.

Cantu cannot complain about the effect of the trial court’s declarations\n          on extra-contractual causes of action she did not assert.\n\n          Cantu’s final argument is that the trial court erred in holding that Southern’s\n\npayment of the appraisal award foreclosed her bad-faith claims.50 This misstates\n\nthe trial court’s judgment. The trial court declared that Southern’s liability under\n\nthe policy was not reasonably clear until the appraisal award was issued and that\n\nSouthern’s timely payment of the award therefore satisfied the prompt-payment\n46\n     Id. at *2-3.\n47\n     See id. at *4.\n48\n  Franco v.

Her pleadings consisted solely of an\n\nanswer with affirmative defenses to the validity of the appraisal award, a plea to\n\nthe jurisdiction, and a motion to transfer venue to Dallas based on convenience.52\n\nEven if Cantu had bad-faith claims that were not extinguished by Southern’s\n\npayment of the appraisal award, she did not raise them, providing no impediment\n\nto the trial court’s final summary judgment and preserving nothing for this Court to\n\nreview.

We recognize that Slavonic’s motion is not a model of clarity—the motion does not set forth the applicable\n       standards of review under Rule 166a(c) and (i) and does not segregate the traditional from the no-evidence grounds; however,\n       the motion does comply with Rule 166a in stating the grounds and sufficiently puts appellants on notice of the claims and\n       causes of action being challenged by appellees. The better practice is to file two separate motions or to file one document\n       containing both motions but with the arguments and authorities for each clearly delineated and separated from one another. For\n       example, Southland’s motion also was a hybrid, but it clearly segregated the traditional from the no-evidence grounds.\n7      Notably, appellants do not allege a cause of action to set aside the appraisal award in their petition. The claims and facts alleged\n       in appellants’ live petition focus on alleged misrepresentations made by appellees concerning the policy and the alleged\n       mishandling of Franco’s claim. However, despite not having alleged a cause of action to set aside the award, appellants are not\n       barred from raising the issue of the appraisal award’s validity for the first time in their summary judgment response, and this\n       issue was properly before the trial court and is subject to review by this court.

The jury was asked whether it found\n       from a preponderance of the evidence that the [appraisal] award should be set aside because of fraud, accident or mistake. The\n       jury answered that it should be set aside.
