Plaintiff Redondo Construction\n\nCorporation has been in litigation against the defendants -- the\n\nPuerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority (PRHTA), the\n\nPuerto Rico Public Buildings Authority (PBA), and several officials\n\nat both agencies (the individual defendants) -- for over a decade.\n\nRedondo alleges that the defendants were in breach of certain\n\nsettlement agreements with Redondo, that this caused Redondo's\n\nbankruptcy, and that the defendants are liable in damages.            The\n\ndistrict court granted the PRHTA's and the individual defendants'\n\nmotions for summary judgment on the grounds that the record\n\ncontained insufficient evidence to prove damages.            See Redondo\n\nConstr. Co. v. Izquierdo, 929 F. Supp. 2d 14, 24 (D.P.R. 2013).         It\n\nalso dismissed Redondo's claims against the PBA sua sponte.           See\n\nid. We affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment as to\n\nthe PRHTA and the individual defendants but vacate the dismissal of\n\nthe claim against the PBA and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                   I.\n\nA.        Guilty Plea and Initial Contract Cancellations\n\n          The events leading to this case began on April 15, 1999,\n\nwhen   Redondo    entered   into   a     plea   agreement   with   federal\n\nprosecutors.     Under the agreement, Redondo pled guilty to aiding\n\nand abetting the making of false statements to the U.S. Department\n\nof Transportation and to Banco Santander de Puerto Rico in the\n\ncourse of its work on a federal highway project.            See 18 U.S.C.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f§§ 2, 1014, 1020.     The next day, the PRHTA informed Redondo that,\n\nin light of the guilty plea, it was revoking the bids it had\n\nawarded Redondo before the plea and was suspending Redondo from\n\nbidding on new contracts for 30 days, with an extension likely to\n\nbe announced in the future.     In May 1999, the PBA did the same.\n\n            Redondo   challenged   both    decisions,     initiating   two\n\nadministrative proceedings.     The proceeding against the PBA ended\n\nwith a settlement agreement allowing Redondo to resume bidding for\n\nPBA contracts on April 16, 2000.     The proceeding against the PRHTA\n\nended with a settlement agreement allowing Redondo to resume\n\nbidding for PRHTA contracts on December 11, 2000, subject to the\n\noversight of a monitoring service for approximately a year and a\n\nhalf.\n\nB.          Enactment of Law 458\n\n            Redondo's eligibility to bid for Puerto Rico contracts\n\nshortly came into question again, this time under a new Puerto Rico\n\nstatute.    On December 29, 2000, Puerto Rico passed Law 458.          See\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, §§ 928-928i.       Law 458 prohibits Puerto Rico\n\nagencies from awarding contracts to any person or corporation\n\nconvicted   of   fraud,   embezzlement,    or   other   similar   offenses\n\ninvolving public funds, for a period of 20 years after a felony\n\nconviction and 8 years after a misdemeanor.             Id. §§ 928, 928b,\n\n928d.   Law 458 included a provision explaining that it \"shall not\n\napply retroactively nor shall [it] . . . interfere with contracts\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fin effect.\"      Id. § 928h.    The law was effective as of the date of\n\nits passage.\n\n            As to the PBA, between April 16 and December 29, 2000,\n\nRedondo had placed fourteen bids for PBA projects and had been\n\nawarded one contract.          After Law 458 became effective, the PBA\n\ncancelled ten of Redondo's fourteen bids, as well as the contract\n\nwhich it had already executed with Redondo.          At the time, the PBA\n\nstated    that   it   lacked   sufficient   funds   to   proceed   with   the\n\nprojects.\n\n            As to the PRHTA, between December 11 and December 29,\n\n2000, Redondo did not place any bids for PRHTA contracts.           Shortly\n\nafter Law 458 became effective, however, on February 14, 2001, the\n\nPRHTA informed Redondo that it was withdrawing from the settlement\n\nit had reached with Redondo, citing Redondo's failure to comply\n\nwith a settlement term requiring it to deposit $25,000 into escrow\n\nto fund the monitoring service.        Later deposition evidence tended\n\nto show that the PRHTA was motivated by the policy of Law 458\n\nregardless of the Law's non-retroactivity provision.                Redondo\n\ndeposited the funds into escrow.        The PRHTA then sought to reopen\n\nadministrative proceedings against Redondo to determine the length\n\nof Redondo's suspension.        As described later, the PRHTA eventually\n\nprevailed at the administrative level, and Redondo later sought\n\njudicial review of the administrative decision in the Puerto Rico\n\ncourts.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fC.         Procedural History\n\n           While the Puerto Rico administrative proceedings between\n\nRedondo and the PRHTA were pending, in December 2001, Redondo filed\n\na complaint in federal court, alleging that the PRHTA, the PBA, and\n\nthe   individual   defendants       had    unlawfully    applied      Law   458    to\n\nRedondo,   putting    the    agencies      in   breach   of   their     respective\n\nsettlement    agreements.         Redondo's     complaint     alleged    that     the\n\napplication of Law 458 violated various provisions of the U.S.\n\nConstitution, including its Due Process and Ex Post Facto Clauses.\n\nThe complaint also stated supplemental claims under Puerto Rico law\n\nfor damages arising out of the alleged breach of contract. Shortly\n\nafter filing the complaint, Redondo filed for bankruptcy.\n\n           The defendants in the federal action filed a motion to\n\ndismiss.     In response, in October 2002, the district court held\n\nthat Redondo had failed to state a federal claim with respect to\n\nthe Ex Post Facto, Double Jeopardy, and Due Process clauses.                      See\n\nRedondo Constr. Corp. v. Izquierdo (Redondo I), No. 01-2690, slip\n\nop. at 6-23 (D.P.R. Oct. 30, 2002).             In reaching that conclusion,\n\nthe district court explicitly considered Redondo's argument that\n\nLaw 458 \"runs afoul of the presumption against retroactivity\n\ninherent in the common law tradition.\"             Id. at 27.        The district\n\ncourt explained that although the law takes into account past\n\nbehavior   in   the   form   of    past    convictions,       it   operates     only\n\nprospectively:     \"In   essence,     no   bid   or   public       contract   after\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fDecember 2000 shall be awarded to anyone convicted of the crimes\n\nlisted in the debarment statute.\"         Id. at 23.\n\n              While providing that construction of the statute, the\n\ndistrict court did not dismiss the case outright. Instead, it held\n\nthat some of Redondo's claims could be \"re-characterized\" as a\n\nContracts Clause challenge, which could survive the motion to\n\ndismiss.    Id.   Thus, the remaining claims after Redondo I were the\n\nContracts Clause claim and the supplemental claims under Puerto\n\nRico law.\n\n              Following the ruling on the motion to dismiss, the\n\nfederal proceedings were stayed on the PRHTA's motion until the\n\nPuerto Rico administrative proceedings concluded.\n\n              Redondo's administrative hearing occurred in 2003.        The\n\nhearing examiner concluded that the PRHTA could not withdraw from\n\nthe settlement based on Redondo's failure to place the funds into\n\nescrow promptly, concluding that this failure was not a material\n\nbreach   of    the   settlement   agreement.     The   Secretary   of   the\n\nDepartment of Transportation and Public Works initially adopted the\n\nexaminer's report but, on the PRHTA's motion, later reversed his\n\ndecision and ruled in favor of the PRHTA in October 2004.          Redondo\n\nsought judicial review of the agency decision in the Puerto Rico\n\nCourt of Appeals.       On May 31, 2005, the Puerto Rico Court of\n\nAppeals ruled that, even if Redondo was in breach of the settlement\n\nagreement, the breach was not sufficient to excuse the PRHTA from\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fits obligations.   The court held that the PRHTA had to comply with\n\nthe settlement agreement and ordered specific performance.           See\n\nApp. 863 (certified translation of Redondo Constr. Corp. v. P.R.\n\nHwy. & Transp. Auth. (Redondo II), No. KLRA0400982, 2005 WL 1475931\n\n(P.R. Cir. May 31, 2005)).     The Puerto Rico Supreme Court denied\n\nthe PRHTA's petition for certiorari and its two motions for\n\nreconsideration.    The Puerto Rico Court of Appeals did not discuss\n\nthe impact of Law 458, which was not briefed or argued before it.\n\n           The federal proceedings resumed after Redondo II, but no\n\nsignificant action occurred for over a year and a half as the case\n\nwas transferred to three successive judges.             Eventually, the\n\ndistrict court set a deadline of April 30, 2007 for all dispositive\n\nmotions.   On that date, the PRHTA and the PBA each moved for\n\nsummary judgment on the Contracts Clause claim and argued that,\n\nafter summary judgment was granted on that claim, the district\n\ncourt should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the\n\nremaining Puerto Rico law claims.         Over the next few months,\n\nseveral other pretrial motions were filed, and trial was set for\n\nFebruary 11, 2008.\n\n           On February 7, 2008, about nine months after the summary\n\njudgment motions were filed and just four days before the scheduled\n\ntrial date, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nthe defendants and dismissed the supplemental Puerto Rico law\n\nclaims   without   prejudice   in   accordance   with   the   defendants'\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fmotions.   Redondo Constr. Corp. v. Izquierdo (Redondo III), 550 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 257, 268 (D.P.R. 2008).\n\n             Redondo appealed.       On appeal, this court upheld the\n\ndistrict court's ruling on the Contracts Clause claim but reversed\n\nits decision to dismiss the supplemental claims.            Redondo Constr.\n\nCorp. v. Izquierdo (Redondo IV), 662 F.3d 42 (1st Cir. 2011).             We\n\nreasoned that considerations of equity demanded that the court\n\nretain   jurisdiction   over   the    supplemental    claims    because   the\n\nparties had dedicated substantial resources to the case and the\n\nsummary judgment decision had come just four days before the\n\nscheduled trial date.    Id. at 48-50.       In doing so, we observed that\n\nthe Contracts Clause claim failed in part because \"[n]either\n\nAuthority has asserted as an affirmative defense that it is excused\n\nby Law 458 . . . from compensating Redondo in damages if Redondo\n\nestablishes a breach of contract,\" meaning that Law 458 did not\n\nimpermissibly extinguish Redondo's remedies for breach of contract.\n\nId. at 48.\n\n             Our holding meant that the only remaining claims in the\n\ncase were Redondo's breach of contract claims against the various\n\ndefendants under Puerto Rico law.          See id. at 50.   We further noted\n\nthat the Puerto Rico courts had already resolved the question of\n\nwhether the PRHTA was in breach, meaning that the only remaining\n\nissue as against the PRHTA on remand was \"whether Redondo was\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fentitled to damages for the Highway Authority's breach, and if so,\n\nhow much.\"     Id. at 50.\n\n             On remand, the district court invited additional briefing\n\non the remaining issues.     The individual defendants filed a motion\n\nfor judgment on the pleadings, which was denied.        Later, the PRHTA\n\nand the individual defendants, but not the PBA, moved for summary\n\njudgment.    On May 28, 2013, the district court granted the PRHTA's\n\nand individual defendants' motions for summary judgment.                See\n\nRedondo Constr. Co. v. Izquierdo (Redondo V), 929 F. Supp. 2d 14,\n\n24 (D.P.R. 2013). It went on to dismiss the entire case, including\n\nthe claims against the PBA, sua sponte.          See id.   The district\n\ncourt reasoned that, after our decision in Redondo IV, the only\n\nremaining issue was whether Redondo was entitled to damages and, if\n\nso, what amount.     It then surveyed the pleadings, observing that\n\nnone included any precise statement of damages, or even of the\n\ngeneral   nature    of   damages   beyond   broad   statements   such    as\n\n\"financial collapse.\"       Id. at 18.      It concluded that the only\n\nrecord evidence on this point was a pair of expert reports (one\n\nfrom 2010 and one from 2007) from Redondo's expert, CPA Rafael\n\nPerez Villarini, and Villarini's related deposition testimony. Id.\n\nat 19.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f               Turning to the evidence, the court excluded the 2010\n\nexpert report as inadmissible hearsay because it was unsworn.1 Id.\n\nIt then examined the expert's deposition testimony, referring to\n\nthe two reports where necessary to illuminate the testimony. After\n\nestablishing the framework of the Daubert inquiry, see Daubert v.\n\nMerrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 592 (1993), the district\n\ncourt       determined     that   Villarini's    testimony      was   \"unreliable\"\n\nbecause it depended on the faulty assumption that Redondo could\n\nhave bid for contracts from the time its two debarment periods\n\nended, in April and December 2000, through the present.                        See\n\nRedondo V, 929 F. Supp. 2d at 20-21.                   That was because Law 458\n\nbarred Redondo from bidding on contracts after December 2000.                  The\n\ndistrict court explained that the law of the case established that\n\npoint.       Id. at 21-22.         The court went on to reject Redondo's\n\ncounterargument that Redondo IV had required that Law 458 not apply\n\nretroactively, distinguishing between Redondo's future ability to\n\npursue      bids   after    December   29,     2000,    which   the   law   validly\n\nextinguished, and its remedy for any breach of the settlement\n\nagreement, which the law did not and could not affect under Redondo\n\nIV.     See id. at 22.       There was no evidence of damages segregated\n\nout for the period before December 29, 2000 as to the PRHTA.\n\nBecause the expert testimony was unreliable, the court reasoned,\n\n\n\n        1\n       The district court did not mention whether the 2007 expert\nreport was likewise excluded.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fRedondo could point to no evidence of damages against the PRHTA,\n\nmeaning that it had failed to make out a necessary element of its\n\ncase and could not survive summary judgment.     Id. at 23.\n\n             The district court concluded by observing that the only\n\nclaims against the individual defendants were for damages under the\n\nsame theory, which meant that summary judgment was also proper\n\nthere because there was likewise no proof of damages.     See id. at\n\n23-24.\n\n             Finally, acting sua sponte, the court \"dismissed\" the\n\ncase \"with prejudice,\" thereby terminating the claim against the\n\nPBA even though the PBA had not moved for summary judgment.      See\n\nid. at 24.     Redondo appeals.\n\n                                  II.\n\n             We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo.     See Bisbano v. Strine Printing Co., 737 F.3d 104, 107\n\n(1st Cir. 2013).      We first examine whether the law of the case\n\nplaces any limits on Redondo's breach of contract claim, then turn\n\nto whether Redondo has presented evidence sufficient to carry a\n\nproperly limited claim through summary judgment.\n\n                                  A.\n\n             The law of the case doctrine establishes that \"when a\n\ncourt decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to\n\ngovern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\"\n\nUnited States v. Matthews, 643 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fArizona   v.   California,    460      U.S.   605,   618   (1983))   (internal\n\nquotation mark omitted).      \"[A] legal decision made at one stage of\n\na civil or criminal case, unchallenged in a subsequent appeal\n\ndespite the existence of ample opportunity to do so, becomes the\n\nlaw of the case for future stages of the same litigation.\"                  Id.\n\n(quoting United States v. Bell, 988 F.2d 247, 250 (1st Cir. 1993))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           In Redondo I, the district court considered Redondo's\n\nclaim that Law 458 had an improper retroactive effect.                In doing\n\nso, it gave a statement of the law's construction, explaining:\n\n           [Law 458] takes account of past behavior in\n           order    to    institute   civil    debarment\n           proceedings. The statute, however, does not\n           operate to regulate past behavior but future\n           behavior.    In essence, no bid or public\n           contract after December 2000 shall be awarded\n           to anyone convicted of the crimes listed in\n           the debarment statute. Therefore, the statute\n           cannot be said to apply retroactively because\n           it takes into account past admissions of\n           guilt.\n\nRedondo   I,    slip   op.   at   27    (emphasis     added).      Under    this\n\nconstruction,    Redondo     would     not    be   eligible   to   earn   public\n\ncontracts after December 2000.2\n\n\n     2\n         This construction was supported by other statements in\nRedondo I. For example, the court also explained that, under Law\n458, Puerto Rico \"simply refuses to do business with\" Redondo, and\nthat this refusal was not improper. Redondo I, slip op. at 23.\nSimilarly, in allowing a Contracts Clause claim to proceed, the\ndistrict court limited its discussion to a provision of Law 458\nthat called for the \"automatic rescission of all contracts in\neffect,\" id.; it did not discuss the possibility of a Contracts\nClause claim with respect to the failure to award future contracts.\n\n                                       -12-\n\f            This statement in Redondo I is a legal decision governing\n\nthe application of Law 458. Redondo did not challenge it on appeal\n\ndespite an ample opportunity to do so.         Consequently, the district\n\ncourt's 2002 interpretation of Law 458 in Redondo I is law of the\n\ncase.   Redondo cannot now challenge the conclusion that Law 458\n\nvalidly prevented it from bidding for public contracts after\n\nDecember 29, 2000.    Nor can it argue that Law 458 did not apply to\n\nit at all; its entire federal case was premised on the notion that\n\nLaw 458 did apply.\n\n            Redondo argues that even if Redondo I established this\n\nprinciple, it is no longer law of the case because of intervening\n\ndecisions in Redondo II and Redondo IV.         In Redondo II, plaintiff\n\nobserves,   the   Puerto   Rico   Court   of   Appeals   ordered   specific\n\nperformance, more than four years after Law 458 took effect.           See\n\nRedondo II, App. 900.      Redondo argues that this order implicitly\n\nassumes that Law 458 does not apply to it, since otherwise specific\n\nperformance would be impossible.           It also argues that legal\n\nimpossibility is an affirmative defense that the PRHTA had to, but\n\ndid not, raise.\n\n            Redondo's argument fails to acknowledge that the impact\n\nof Law 458 was not before the court in Redondo II.          Neither party\n\ndiscussed Law 458 in the briefs, and the court did not mention the\n\nlaw even a single time.     Because the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals\n\ndid not consider the effect of Law 458 at all, we do not read its\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\forder       of   specific    performance   as   an   implicit    endorsement   of\n\nRedondo's position.            Likewise, we do not consider the PRHTA's\n\nfailure to brief the issue of Law 458 before the Puerto Rico Court\n\nof Appeals to waive any argument regarding the law's effect,\n\nbecause the issue of whether specific performance was possible did\n\nnot arise until the court issued its opinion ordering specific\n\nperformance.3\n\n                 Redondo goes on to argue that our opinion in Redondo IV\n\nresolves the law of the case issue in its favor.                  It argues that\n\nour Contracts Clause holding depended on an \"understanding\" that\n\nRedondo \"had an available remedy in damages.\"                   This argument is\n\ncorrect on its own terms; we did explain that the fact that Redondo\n\nstill had a remedy in damages meant there was no Contracts Clause\n\nviolation.        See Redondo IV, 662 F.3d at 48 (\"If a state breaches a\n\ncontract but does not impair the counterparty's right to recover\n\ndamages for the breach, the state has not impaired the obligation\n\nof the contract.\").           But that conclusion does not lead as far as\n\nRedondo believes.           We held only that Law 458 was not available as\n\nan affirmative defense to excuse the defendants \"from compensating\n\nRedondo in damages if Redondo establishes a breach of contract.\"\n\nId.         We did not call into question the district court's prior\n\n\n\n        3\n        Additionally, Redondo has not filed suit to compel the\nenforcement of the specific performance order from Redondo II, so\nthe PRHTA still, nine years after Redondo II, has had no need to\nraise Law 458 as an affirmative defense.\n\n                                       -14-\n\fdecision in Redondo I that Law 458 validly barred Redondo from\n\nbidding after December 2000.      Nor did we hold, either expressly or\n\nimplicitly, that the agencies had waived the use of Law 458 as an\n\naffirmative   defense   against   any     challenge   to   their   decisions\n\nbarring Redondo from bidding after December 2000.4\n\n           Because neither the Puerto Rico court's decision in\n\nRedondo II nor our decision in Redondo IV called Redondo I's\n\nconstruction of Law 458 into question, that construction still\n\ngoverns here.   Redondo's damages on its breach of contract claims\n\ncannot be premised on the proposition that, absent any breach by\n\nthe PRHTA, Redondo would have had an unfettered right to bid on and\n\nwin PRHTA contracts after December 29, 2000.\n\n                                    B.\n\n           Because Redondo bears the burden of proof, it must point\n\nto   affirmative,   admissible    evidence    supporting    its    claim   for\n\ndamages to survive the PRHTA's and the individual defendants'\n\nmotions for summary judgment. See FDIC v. Elder Care Servs., Inc.,\n\n82 F.3d 524, 526 (1st Cir. 1996); Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895\n\nF.2d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 1990).            We review the district court's\n\nexclusion of evidence on Daubert grounds for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee Smith v. Jenkins, 732 F.3d 51, 64 (1st Cir. 2013).\n\n\n\n\n      4\n       Redondo also offers arguments based on the doctrines of res\njudicata and judicial estoppel. These arguments fail for the same\nreasons detailed above.\n\n                                   -15-\n\f          The only record evidence regarding damages caused by the\n\nPRHTA and the individual defendants was the deposition testimony of\n\nCPA Villarini and his two expert reports.5             Even assuming the\n\nreports were admissible,6 this evidence was properly excluded as\n\nunreliable.    Villarini's   reports      and   deposition   rely   on    the\n\nassumption that \"Redondo could have submitted bids for contracts\n\nfrom December 11, 2000 to the present, without interruptions, for\n\nconstruction   projects   carried   out    by   the   [PRHTA].\"     But   as\n\ndescribed above, the law of the case establishes that Redondo could\n\nnot have bid for contracts from the PRHTA after December 29, 2000.\n\nThe assumption is flawed, and the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in concluding that this makes Villarini's evidence\n\nunreliable.\n\n          Villarini's evidence cannot be salvaged by trying to\n\nextract from it the amount of damages, if any, corresponding to the\n\nproper time period.   The expert reports calculated total damages\n\nbetween 2000 and 2010 but did not break down the damages for\n\nindividual years within that period. The reports show no plausible\n\n\n\n     5\n        The content of the reports is essentially the same as the\ndeposition testimony. Our analysis applies equally to the reports\nand the testimony, and we consider them as a single unit for\npurposes of simplicity in addressing Redondo's arguments.\n     6\n        Redondo asserts, without citation to the record, that the\nreports were \"authenticated\" during Villarini's deposition, and\nthat this would be enough to render the reports admissible, citing\n11-56 Moore's Federal Practice § 56.94[4][b].      We assume this\npoint, without deciding, in Redondo's favor.\n\n                                -16-\n\fway, and Redondo suggests none, to distinguish the damages premised\n\non the faulty assumption that Redondo could win PRHTA contracts\n\nafter December 29, 2000 from those that do not rely on that\n\nassumption.      That problem is compounded with respect to the\n\nindividual defendants, for whom there is no reliable way to\n\nseparate either the proper time period or the proportion of damages\n\nattributable to the individual defendants.\n\n            Without Villarini's evidence, Redondo has no record\n\nevidence of damages against the PRHTA or the individual defendants.\n\nThe district court correctly entered summary judgment accordingly.\n\n                                      III.\n\n            We   next     consider   the     district   court's    sua    sponte\n\ndismissal7 of the breach of contract claims against the PBA.                    We\n\napply    \"especially    rigorous     appellate   review\"    to    the   district\n\ncourt's    sua   sponte    dismissal,   although    the    ultimate      de   novo\n\nstandard of review does not vary.             Santiago v. Puerto Rico, 655\n\n\n\n\n     7\n        The district court did not explicitly discuss the claims\nagainst the PBA. Instead, it addressed them after granting the\nPRHTA's and individual defendants' motions for summary judgment\nsimply by stating \"[t]his case is DISMISSED, with prejudice.\" We\nwill refer to the \"dismissal\" as a proxy for entry of summary\njudgment against Redondo on the claims against the PBA. The label\ndoes not change our analysis, because the standards for reviewing\nsua sponte dismissals and sua sponte entry of summary judgment are\nlargely identical. Compare, e.g., Chute v. Walker, 281 F.3d 314,\n319 (1st Cir. 2002) (standard for sua sponte dismissal), with\nBerkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc., 89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 1996)\n(standard for sua sponte summary judgment).\n\n                                      -17-\n\fF.3d 61, 72 (1st Cir. 2011); N.H. Right to Life Political Action\n\nComm. v. Gardner, 99 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          There are two important limits on a district court's\n\nauthority to enter judgment sua sponte at the summary judgment\n\nstage:\n\n          First, a district court ordinarily may order\n          summary judgment on its own initiative only\n          when discovery is sufficiently advanced that\n          the   parties   have  enjoyed   a   reasonable\n          opportunity to glean the material facts.\n          Second, the court may enter summary judgment\n          sua sponte only if it first gives the targeted\n          party appropriate notice and a chance to\n          present its evidence on the essential elements\n          of the claim or defense.\n\nBerkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc., 89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n          We are satisfied that the first condition was met here.\n\nThe district court entered judgment on the claims against the PBA\n\nwell after the close of discovery, and no party has argued that\n\nadditional time for discovery was needed.   However, the sua sponte\n\nentry of summary judgment fails on the second condition. Since the\n\nPBA did not seek summary judgment or dismissal, Redondo was never\n\nput on notice that entry of judgment was a possibility, nor was it\n\ngiven the opportunity to present its evidence to avoid that result.\n\n          The district court explained that one defendant's motion\n\nfor summary judgment may be sufficient to put the plaintiff on\n\nnotice of the need to identify proof as to the other defendants.\n\nThat may be true when the same proof applies to both defendants.\n\n                               -18-\n\fHere, however, the claim against the PBA is differently situated\n\nthan the claims against the PRHTA and the individual defendants.\n\nUnder the law of the case, Redondo was eligible to bid for PBA\n\ncontracts between April 16 and December 29, 2000.          It actually did\n\nplace several bids during that period and was awarded a PBA\n\ncontract for one project, the Van Scoy school project.            The PBA\n\nlater cancelled the Van Scoy contract after Law 458 was passed.\n\nThis contrasts with Redondo's relationship with the PRHTA for\n\nseveral   reasons,   including   that   the   Van   Scoy    contract   was\n\nterminated8 and that Redondo had not placed any bids with the PRHTA\n\nduring that time.\n\n           The district court's failure to provide Redondo notice\n\nand the opportunity to put forward that different evidence was\n\nerror.    Because the court did not meet the second necessary\n\ncondition for entering judgment sua sponte at this stage, its sua\n\nsponte dismissal of the claims against the PBA cannot stand.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n           For the reasons stated above, the district court's entry\n\nof summary judgment in favor of the PRHTA and the individual\n\ndefendants is affirmed.    The dismissal of the claims against the\n\n\n\n\n     8\n        Without in any way indicating a view on its admissibility\nas part of Redondo's case, we note that the PBA's expert report\nstates that, if the PBA owes damages at all, the sum of damages for\nthe cancelled contract is $190,088.\n\n                                 -19-\n\fPBA is vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n          Costs are awarded to the PRHTA and individual defendants.\n\nNo costs are awarded with respect to the PBA.\n\n\n\n\n                                -20-\n\f",

The\n\ndistrict court granted the PRHTA's and the individual defendants'\n\nmotions for summary judgment on the grounds that the record\n\ncontained insufficient evidence to prove damages.

Guilty Plea and Initial Contract Cancellations\n\n          The events leading to this case began on April 15, 1999,\n\nwhen   Redondo    entered   into   a     plea   agreement   with   federal\n\nprosecutors.     Under the agreement, Redondo pled guilty to aiding\n\nand abetting the making of false statements to the U.S. Department\n\nof Transportation and to Banco Santander de Puerto Rico in the\n\ncourse of its work on a federal highway project.            See 18 U.S.C.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f§§ 2, 1014, 1020.     The next day, the PRHTA informed Redondo that,\n\nin light of the guilty plea, it was revoking the bids it had\n\nawarded Redondo before the plea and was suspending Redondo from\n\nbidding on new contracts for 30 days, with an extension likely to\n\nbe announced in the future.     In May 1999, the PBA did the same.\n\n            Redondo   challenged   both    decisions,     initiating   two\n\nadministrative proceedings.     The proceeding against the PBA ended\n\nwith a settlement agreement allowing Redondo to resume bidding for\n\nPBA contracts on April 16, 2000.     The proceeding against the PRHTA\n\nended with a settlement agreement allowing Redondo to resume\n\nbidding for PRHTA contracts on December 11, 2000, subject to the\n\noversight of a monitoring service for approximately a year and a\n\nhalf.\n\nB.          Enactment of Law 458\n\n            Redondo's eligibility to bid for Puerto Rico contracts\n\nshortly came into question again, this time under a new Puerto Rico\n\nstatute.    On December 29, 2000, Puerto Rico passed Law 458.          See\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, §§ 928-928i.       Law 458 prohibits Puerto Rico\n\nagencies from awarding contracts to any person or corporation\n\nconvicted   of   fraud,   embezzlement,    or   other   similar   offenses\n\ninvolving public funds, for a period of 20 years after a felony\n\nconviction and 8 years after a misdemeanor.             Id. §§ 928, 928b,\n\n928d.   Law 458 included a provision explaining that it \"shall not\n\napply retroactively nor shall [it] . . . interfere with contracts\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fin effect.\"      Id. § 928h.    The law was effective as of the date of\n\nits passage.\n\n            As to the PBA, between April 16 and December 29, 2000,\n\nRedondo had placed fourteen bids for PBA projects and had been\n\nawarded one contract.          After Law 458 became effective, the PBA\n\ncancelled ten of Redondo's fourteen bids, as well as the contract\n\nwhich it had already executed with Redondo.          At the time, the PBA\n\nstated    that   it   lacked   sufficient   funds   to   proceed   with   the\n\nprojects.\n\n            As to the PRHTA, between December 11 and December 29,\n\n2000, Redondo did not place any bids for PRHTA contracts.           Shortly\n\nafter Law 458 became effective, however, on February 14, 2001, the\n\nPRHTA informed Redondo that it was withdrawing from the settlement\n\nit had reached with Redondo, citing Redondo's failure to comply\n\nwith a settlement term requiring it to deposit $25,000 into escrow\n\nto fund the monitoring service.        Later deposition evidence tended\n\nto show that the PRHTA was motivated by the policy of Law 458\n\nregardless of the Law's non-retroactivity provision.                Redondo\n\ndeposited the funds into escrow.        The PRHTA then sought to reopen\n\nadministrative proceedings against Redondo to determine the length\n\nof Redondo's suspension.        As described later, the PRHTA eventually\n\nprevailed at the administrative level, and Redondo later sought\n\njudicial review of the administrative decision in the Puerto Rico\n\ncourts.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fC.         Procedural History\n\n           While the Puerto Rico administrative proceedings between\n\nRedondo and the PRHTA were pending, in December 2001, Redondo filed\n\na complaint in federal court, alleging that the PRHTA, the PBA, and\n\nthe   individual   defendants       had    unlawfully    applied      Law   458    to\n\nRedondo,   putting    the    agencies      in   breach   of   their     respective\n\nsettlement    agreements.         Redondo's     complaint     alleged    that     the\n\napplication of Law 458 violated various provisions of the U.S.\n\nConstitution, including its Due Process and Ex Post Facto Clauses.\n\nThe complaint also stated supplemental claims under Puerto Rico law\n\nfor damages arising out of the alleged breach of contract. Shortly\n\nafter filing the complaint, Redondo filed for bankruptcy.\n\n           The defendants in the federal action filed a motion to\n\ndismiss.     In response, in October 2002, the district court held\n\nthat Redondo had failed to state a federal claim with respect to\n\nthe Ex Post Facto, Double Jeopardy, and Due Process clauses.                      See\n\nRedondo Constr. Corp. v. Izquierdo (Redondo I), No. 01-2690, slip\n\nop. at 6-23 (D.P.R. Oct. 30, 2002).             In reaching that conclusion,\n\nthe district court explicitly considered Redondo's argument that\n\nLaw 458 \"runs afoul of the presumption against retroactivity\n\ninherent in the common law tradition.\"             Id. at 27.        The district\n\ncourt explained that although the law takes into account past\n\nbehavior   in   the   form   of    past    convictions,       it   operates     only\n\nprospectively:     \"In   essence,     no   bid   or   public       contract   after\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fDecember 2000 shall be awarded to anyone convicted of the crimes\n\nlisted in the debarment statute.\"         Id. at 23.\n\n              While providing that construction of the statute, the\n\ndistrict court did not dismiss the case outright. Instead, it held\n\nthat some of Redondo's claims could be \"re-characterized\" as a\n\nContracts Clause challenge, which could survive the motion to\n\ndismiss.    Id.   Thus, the remaining claims after Redondo I were the\n\nContracts Clause claim and the supplemental claims under Puerto\n\nRico law.\n\n              Following the ruling on the motion to dismiss, the\n\nfederal proceedings were stayed on the PRHTA's motion until the\n\nPuerto Rico administrative proceedings concluded.\n\n              Redondo's administrative hearing occurred in 2003.        The\n\nhearing examiner concluded that the PRHTA could not withdraw from\n\nthe settlement based on Redondo's failure to place the funds into\n\nescrow promptly, concluding that this failure was not a material\n\nbreach   of    the   settlement   agreement.     The   Secretary   of   the\n\nDepartment of Transportation and Public Works initially adopted the\n\nexaminer's report but, on the PRHTA's motion, later reversed his\n\ndecision and ruled in favor of the PRHTA in October 2004.          Redondo\n\nsought judicial review of the agency decision in the Puerto Rico\n\nCourt of Appeals.       On May 31, 2005, the Puerto Rico Court of\n\nAppeals ruled that, even if Redondo was in breach of the settlement\n\nagreement, the breach was not sufficient to excuse the PRHTA from\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fits obligations.   The court held that the PRHTA had to comply with\n\nthe settlement agreement and ordered specific performance.           See\n\nApp. 863 (certified translation of Redondo Constr. Corp. v.

The Puerto Rico Court of Appeals did not discuss\n\nthe impact of Law 458, which was not briefed or argued before it.\n\n           The federal proceedings resumed after Redondo II, but no\n\nsignificant action occurred for over a year and a half as the case\n\nwas transferred to three successive judges.             Eventually, the\n\ndistrict court set a deadline of April 30, 2007 for all dispositive\n\nmotions.   On that date, the PRHTA and the PBA each moved for\n\nsummary judgment on the Contracts Clause claim and argued that,\n\nafter summary judgment was granted on that claim, the district\n\ncourt should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the\n\nremaining Puerto Rico law claims.         Over the next few months,\n\nseveral other pretrial motions were filed, and trial was set for\n\nFebruary 11, 2008.\n\n           On February 7, 2008, about nine months after the summary\n\njudgment motions were filed and just four days before the scheduled\n\ntrial date, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nthe defendants and dismissed the supplemental Puerto Rico law\n\nclaims   without   prejudice   in   accordance   with   the   defendants'\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fmotions.

Id. at 48-50.       In doing so, we observed that\n\nthe Contracts Clause claim failed in part because \"[n]either\n\nAuthority has asserted as an affirmative defense that it is excused\n\nby Law 458 . . . from compensating Redondo in damages if Redondo\n\nestablishes a breach of contract,\" meaning that Law 458 did not\n\nimpermissibly extinguish Redondo's remedies for breach of contract.\n\nId. at 48.\n\n             Our holding meant that the only remaining claims in the\n\ncase were Redondo's breach of contract claims against the various\n\ndefendants under Puerto Rico law.          See id. at 50.   We further noted\n\nthat the Puerto Rico courts had already resolved the question of\n\nwhether the PRHTA was in breach, meaning that the only remaining\n\nissue as against the PRHTA on remand was \"whether Redondo was\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fentitled to damages for the Highway Authority's breach, and if so,\n\nhow much.\"     Id. at 50.\n\n             On remand, the district court invited additional briefing\n\non the remaining issues.

It then surveyed the pleadings, observing that\n\nnone included any precise statement of damages, or even of the\n\ngeneral   nature    of   damages   beyond   broad   statements   such    as\n\n\"financial collapse.\"       Id. at 18.

See\n\nRedondo V, 929 F. Supp. 2d at 20-21.                   That was because Law 458\n\nbarred Redondo from bidding on contracts after December 2000.                  The\n\ndistrict court explained that the law of the case established that\n\npoint.       Id. at 21-22.         The court went on to reject Redondo's\n\ncounterargument that Redondo IV had required that Law 458 not apply\n\nretroactively, distinguishing between Redondo's future ability to\n\npursue      bids   after    December   29,     2000,    which   the   law   validly\n\nextinguished, and its remedy for any breach of the settlement\n\nagreement, which the law did not and could not affect under Redondo\n\nIV.

In doing\n\nso, it gave a statement of the law's construction, explaining:\n\n           [Law 458] takes account of past behavior in\n           order    to    institute   civil    debarment\n           proceedings. The statute, however, does not\n           operate to regulate past behavior but future\n           behavior.    In essence, no bid or public\n           contract after December 2000 shall be awarded\n           to anyone convicted of the crimes listed in\n           the debarment statute. Therefore, the statute\n           cannot be said to apply retroactively because\n           it takes into account past admissions of\n           guilt.\n\nRedondo   I,    slip   op.   at   27    (emphasis     added).      Under    this\n\nconstruction,    Redondo     would     not    be   eligible   to   earn   public\n\ncontracts after December 2000.2\n\n\n     2\n         This construction was supported by other statements in\nRedondo I. For example, the court also explained that, under Law\n458, Puerto Rico \"simply refuses to do business with\" Redondo, and\nthat this refusal was not improper. Redondo I, slip op. at 23.\nSimilarly, in allowing a Contracts Clause claim to proceed, the\ndistrict court limited its discussion to a provision of Law 458\nthat called for the \"automatic rescission of all contracts in\neffect,\" id.; it did not discuss the possibility of a Contracts\nClause claim with respect to the failure to award future contracts.\n\n                                       -12-\n\f            This statement in Redondo I is a legal decision governing\n\nthe application of Law 458. Redondo did not challenge it on appeal\n\ndespite an ample opportunity to do so.         Consequently, the district\n\ncourt's 2002 interpretation of Law 458 in Redondo I is law of the\n\ncase.   Redondo cannot now challenge the conclusion that Law 458\n\nvalidly prevented it from bidding for public contracts after\n\nDecember 29, 2000.    Nor can it argue that Law 458 did not apply to\n\nit at all; its entire federal case was premised on the notion that\n\nLaw 458 did apply.\n\n            Redondo argues that even if Redondo I established this\n\nprinciple, it is no longer law of the case because of intervening\n\ndecisions in Redondo II and Redondo IV.         In Redondo II, plaintiff\n\nobserves,   the   Puerto   Rico   Court   of   Appeals   ordered   specific\n\nperformance, more than four years after Law 458 took effect.           See\n\nRedondo II, App. 900.      Redondo argues that this order implicitly\n\nassumes that Law 458 does not apply to it, since otherwise specific\n\nperformance would be impossible.           It also argues that legal\n\nimpossibility is an affirmative defense that the PRHTA had to, but\n\ndid not, raise.\n\n            Redondo's argument fails to acknowledge that the impact\n\nof Law 458 was not before the court in Redondo II.          Neither party\n\ndiscussed Law 458 in the briefs, and the court did not mention the\n\nlaw even a single time.     Because the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals\n\ndid not consider the effect of Law 458 at all, we do not read its\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\forder       of   specific    performance   as   an   implicit    endorsement   of\n\nRedondo's position.            Likewise, we do not consider the PRHTA's\n\nfailure to brief the issue of Law 458 before the Puerto Rico Court\n\nof Appeals to waive any argument regarding the law's effect,\n\nbecause the issue of whether specific performance was possible did\n\nnot arise until the court issued its opinion ordering specific\n\nperformance.3\n\n                 Redondo goes on to argue that our opinion in Redondo IV\n\nresolves the law of the case issue in its favor.                  It argues that\n\nour Contracts Clause holding depended on an \"understanding\" that\n\nRedondo \"had an available remedy in damages.\"                   This argument is\n\ncorrect on its own terms; we did explain that the fact that Redondo\n\nstill had a remedy in damages meant there was no Contracts Clause\n\nviolation.        See Redondo IV, 662 F.3d at 48 (\"If a state breaches a\n\ncontract but does not impair the counterparty's right to recover\n\ndamages for the breach, the state has not impaired the obligation\n\nof the contract.\").           But that conclusion does not lead as far as\n\nRedondo believes.           We held only that Law 458 was not available as\n\nan affirmative defense to excuse the defendants \"from compensating\n\nRedondo in damages if Redondo establishes a breach of contract.\"\n\nId.         We did not call into question the district court's prior\n\n\n\n        3\n        Additionally, Redondo has not filed suit to compel the\nenforcement of the specific performance order from Redondo II, so\nthe PRHTA still, nine years after Redondo II, has had no need to\nraise Law 458 as an affirmative defense.\n\n                                       -14-\n\fdecision in Redondo I that Law 458 validly barred Redondo from\n\nbidding after December 2000.      Nor did we hold, either expressly or\n\nimplicitly, that the agencies had waived the use of Law 458 as an\n\naffirmative   defense   against   any     challenge   to   their   decisions\n\nbarring Redondo from bidding after December 2000.4\n\n           Because neither the Puerto Rico court's decision in\n\nRedondo II nor our decision in Redondo IV called Redondo I's\n\nconstruction of Law 458 into question, that construction still\n\ngoverns here.   Redondo's damages on its breach of contract claims\n\ncannot be premised on the proposition that, absent any breach by\n\nthe PRHTA, Redondo would have had an unfettered right to bid on and\n\nwin PRHTA contracts after December 29, 2000.\n\n                                    B.\n\n           Because Redondo bears the burden of proof, it must point\n\nto   affirmative,   admissible    evidence    supporting    its    claim   for\n\ndamages to survive the PRHTA's and the individual defendants'\n\nmotions for summary judgment.

Villarini's   reports      and   deposition   rely   on    the\n\nassumption that \"Redondo could have submitted bids for contracts\n\nfrom December 11, 2000 to the present, without interruptions, for\n\nconstruction   projects   carried   out    by   the   [PRHTA].\"     But   as\n\ndescribed above, the law of the case establishes that Redondo could\n\nnot have bid for contracts from the PRHTA after December 29, 2000.\n\nThe assumption is flawed, and the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in concluding that this makes Villarini's evidence\n\nunreliable.\n\n          Villarini's evidence cannot be salvaged by trying to\n\nextract from it the amount of damages, if any, corresponding to the\n\nproper time period.   The expert reports calculated total damages\n\nbetween 2000 and 2010 but did not break down the damages for\n\nindividual years within that period. The reports show no plausible\n\n\n\n     5\n        The content of the reports is essentially the same as the\ndeposition testimony. Our analysis applies equally to the reports\nand the testimony, and we consider them as a single unit for\npurposes of simplicity in addressing Redondo's arguments.\n     6\n        Redondo asserts, without citation to the record, that the\nreports were \"authenticated\" during Villarini's deposition, and\nthat this would be enough to render the reports admissible, citing\n11-56 Moore's Federal Practice § 56.94[4][b].      We assume this\npoint, without deciding, in Redondo's favor.\n\n                                -16-\n\fway, and Redondo suggests none, to distinguish the damages premised\n\non the faulty assumption that Redondo could win PRHTA contracts\n\nafter December 29, 2000 from those that do not rely on that\n\nassumption.      That problem is compounded with respect to the\n\nindividual defendants, for whom there is no reliable way to\n\nseparate either the proper time period or the proportion of damages\n\nattributable to the individual defendants.\n\n            Without Villarini's evidence, Redondo has no record\n\nevidence of damages against the PRHTA or the individual defendants.\n\nThe district court correctly entered summary judgment accordingly.\n\n                                      III.\n\n            We   next     consider   the     district   court's    sua    sponte\n\ndismissal7 of the breach of contract claims against the PBA.

Instead, it addressed them after granting the\nPRHTA's and individual defendants' motions for summary judgment\nsimply by stating \"[t]his case is DISMISSED, with prejudice.\" We\nwill refer to the \"dismissal\" as a proxy for entry of summary\njudgment against Redondo on the claims against the PBA. The label\ndoes not change our analysis, because the standards for reviewing\nsua sponte dismissals and sua sponte entry of summary judgment are\nlargely identical. Compare, e.g., Chute v.

Home Box Office, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196881\"><a href=\"/opinion/196881/berkovitz-v-home-box-office/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 29 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n          We are satisfied that the first condition was met here.\n\nThe district court entered judgment on the claims against the PBA\n\nwell after the close of discovery, and no party has argued that\n\nadditional time for discovery was needed.   However, the sua sponte\n\nentry of summary judgment fails on the second condition. Since the\n\nPBA did not seek summary judgment or dismissal, Redondo was never\n\nput on notice that entry of judgment was a possibility, nor was it\n\ngiven the opportunity to present its evidence to avoid that result.\n\n          The district court explained that one defendant's motion\n\nfor summary judgment may be sufficient to put the plaintiff on\n\nnotice of the need to identify proof as to the other defendants.\n\nThat may be true when the same proof applies to both defendants.\n\n                               -18-\n\fHere, however, the claim against the PBA is differently situated\n\nthan the claims against the PRHTA and the individual defendants.\n\nUnder the law of the case, Redondo was eligible to bid for PBA\n\ncontracts between April 16 and December 29, 2000.          It actually did\n\nplace several bids during that period and was awarded a PBA\n\ncontract for one project, the Van Scoy school project.            The PBA\n\nlater cancelled the Van Scoy contract after Law 458 was passed.\n\nThis contrasts with Redondo's relationship with the PRHTA for\n\nseveral   reasons,   including   that   the   Van   Scoy    contract   was\n\nterminated8 and that Redondo had not placed any bids with the PRHTA\n\nduring that time.\n\n           The district court's failure to provide Redondo notice\n\nand the opportunity to put forward that different evidence was\n\nerror.    Because the court did not meet the second necessary\n\ncondition for entering judgment sua sponte at this stage, its sua\n\nsponte dismissal of the claims against the PBA cannot stand.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n           For the reasons stated above, the district court's entry\n\nof summary judgment in favor of the PRHTA and the individual\n\ndefendants is affirmed.    The dismissal of the claims against the\n\n\n\n\n     8\n        Without in any way indicating a view on its admissibility\nas part of Redondo's case, we note that the PBA's expert report\nstates that, if the PBA owes damages at all, the sum of damages for\nthe cancelled contract is $190,088.\n\n                                 -19-\n\fPBA is vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n          Costs are awarded to the PRHTA and individual defendants.\n\nNo costs are awarded with respect to the PBA.\n\n\n\n\n                                -20-\n\f</pre>",
