We  affirm,  in part,  and\r\n\nremand other claims for further proceedings. \r\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r\n\n                           BACKGROUND1\r                                     BACKGROUND\r                                               \r\n\n          At  approximately  10:00  p.m.  on July  20,  1990,  in\r\n\nFramingham, Massachusetts, Alexis and her family, who are African\r\n\nAmericans,  entered a  McDonald's  restaurant,  proceeded to  the\r\n\nservice counter, placed their  order, and paid in advance.   When\r\n\nthe food was placed before them at the service counter, it became\r\n\napparent that  Alfredo Pascacio, whose native  tongue is Spanish,\r\n\nhad mistaken  their order.   During the ensuing  exchange between\r\n\nAlexis and  Pascacio, defendant-appellee Donna Domina, the \"swing\r\n\nmanager,\" intervened in behalf of Pascacio, which prompted Alexis\r\n\nto say:   \"[Y]ou take care of  the people in front of  you.  He's\r\n\ntaking  care of me, and we're sorting this out.\"  Domina nonethe-\r\n\nless persisted for several more minutes.  \r\n\n          Ultimately,  Domina said  to Alexis,  \"I don't  have to\r\n\nlisten to you.\"   Alexis replied, \"[Y]ou're damn right  you don't\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The material facts  in genuine dispute  are related in  the\r\nlight  most  favorable  to  plaintiffs-appellants,  against  whom\r\nsummary judgment was entered.  See Velez-Gomez v. SMA Life Assur.\r                                                                           \r\nCo., 8 F.3d 873, 874 (1st Cir. 1993).\r             \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nhave to listen to me.  I was not speaking to you.  I was speaking\r\n\nto him.\"  Domina then instructed Pascacio:  \"Just put their stuff\r\n\nin a  bag and get them out  of here.\"  Turning  to Alexis, Domina\r\n\nretorted:   \"You're not eating here.   If you [do] we're going to\r\n\ncall the cops.\"  Alexis responded:  \"Well you do what you have to\r\n\ndo  because  we  plan to  eat  here.\"    Notwithstanding Domina's\r\n\ninstructions, Pascacio placed the  food order on a  service tray,\r\n\nwithout bagging it.   The entire incident at the  service counter\r\n\nhad lasted approximately ten minutes.  \r\n\n          After  the Alexis  family  went into  the dining  area,\r\n\nSherry Topham, a managerial employee, summoned  defendant Michael\r\n\nLeporati  into the  restaurant.   Leporati, a  uniformed off-duty\r\n\npolice sergeant, had  been patrolling on foot outside the restau-\r\n\nrant by  prearrangement  with the  Town  of Framingham,  but  had\r\n\nwitnessed no  part of the earlier exchange among Alexis, Pascacio\r\n\nand Domina. \r\n\n          Upon entering the restaurant, Leporati  was informed by\r\n\nDomina  that Alexis had been  yelling, creating a  \"scene\" and an\r\n\n\"unwarranted disturbance\" over a mistaken food order, and direct-\r\n\ning abusive remarks at Pascacio.2   Domina informed Leporati that\r\n\nAlexis  had argued loudly with her and another employee; that she\r\n\n\"just wasn't stopping\"; and  that Alexis was still in  the dining\r\n\narea though Domina  had \"asked  her to leave.\"   Finally,  Domina\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2At summary judgment, we must credit Alexis's statement that\r\nshe did  not yell or  cause a \"disturbance.\"   See supra  note 1.\r                                                                  \r\nBut since it is  uncontradicted, we must also assume  that Domina\r\ninformed Leporati that Alexis had caused a disturbance.  Id. \r                                                                      \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\ntold Leporati, \"I would like her to leave.\"  \r                                          \r\n\n          Without further inquiry into the \"disturbance\" alleged-\r\n\nly  caused by Alexis, Leporati proceeded to the dining area where\r\n\nAlexis and her family were seated, and informed the entire Alexis\r\n\nfamily that the manager wanted them  to leave and that they would\r\n\nhave to go.   Alexis  immediately asked why,  denied causing  any\r\n\ndisturbance,  and claimed a right to finish eating in the restau-\r\n\nrant.   When she urged Leporati to ask other restaurant customers\r\n\nwhether there had been any disturbance, Leporati simply reiterat-\r\n\ned  that the  family would  have to  leave, then returned  to the\r\n\nservice counter.3  \r\n\n          At the service counter, Leporati relayed his  conversa-\r\n\ntion with Alexis and  informed Domina that the Alexis  family had\r\n\nrefused to leave.  In  Leporati's presence, Domina discussed  the\r\n\nmatter with  Sherry Topham, who  recalled having had  a \"problem\"\r\n\nwith Alexis on a prior occasion.4   At that point, Domina stated,\r\n\n\"Well, if that's the case, then maybe we should  have her leave.\"\r\n\nWith that,  Sergeant Leporati returned  to the Alexis  family and\r\n\nadvised  Alexis that she would be arrested unless she left before\r                                  \r\n\nhis backup arrived.   Cf. supra  note 3.  Alexis  reiterated that\r                                         \r\n\nshe believed she had the right  to finish eating.  Leporati  left\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The  record is silent as  to why all  Alexis family members\r\nwere  ordered to leave, though  only Alexis had  been involved in\r\nthe exchange at the service counter.\r\n\n     4The record  reflects  no other  information concerning  the\r\ntiming or  nature of any such \"problem.\"   As Alexis attests that\r\nthere  had been no prior  incident, we are  required to assume as\r\nmuch.  \r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nthe dining area to call for backup.\r\n\n          Approximately  ten minutes later,  Officer William Fuer\r\n\narrived and Alexis was told by Leporati that she was being placed\r\n\nunder arrest.  Then, without asking or directing Alexis to get up\r\n\nfrom  the  table, Leporati  suddenly  and  violently grabbed  and\r\n\npulled her bodily from the booth and across the table, handcuffed\r\n\nher hands  tightly behind her back, and, with the help of Officer\r\n\nFuer,  dragged her  from  the booth,  bruising  her legs  in  the\r\n\nprocess.  Insisting  that she was \"not  resisting arrest,\" Alexis\r\n\nasked the  officers to  allow her  to walk  out.   Instead,  they\r\n\nhoisted her by her elbows and carried  her from the restaurant to\r\n\nthe police car,  where Leporati pushed her into  the car with the\r\n\ninstruction, \"Get your ass in there.\"  \r\n\n          As she  was being  removed from the  restaurant, Alexis\r\n\nand her husband repeatedly  asked the officers why she  was being\r\n\ntreated in this manner.  When  Mr. Alexis said, \"We have rights,\"\r\n\nLeporati  responded, \"You people have no rights.  You better shut\r\n\nup your [expletive] mouth before I arrest you too.\"\r\n\n          Alexis eventually was charged with criminal trespass, a\r\n\nmisdemeanor  under  Mass. Gen.  Laws Ann.  ch.  266,    120 (West\r\n\n1994).  Following  her acquittal by a jury, Alexis and her family\r\n\nfiled  the present action in the United States District Court for\r\n\nthe  District of  Massachusetts,  asserting  civil rights  claims\r\n\nunder 42  U.S.C.    1981, 1983,  &amp; 1985(3), as well  as state law\r\n\nclaims  for use  of  excessive force,  intentional infliction  of\r\n\nemotional  distress, assault, battery,  false imprisonment, mali-\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\ncious prosecution,  and abuse  of  process.   The district  court\r\n\ngranted summary judgment for the defendants on all federal claims\r\n\nand on  the excessive force  claim against  Leporati under  Mass.\r\n\nGen. Laws Ann. ch. 12,   11I.  Finally, the court granted summary\r\n\njudgment  for all defendants  on the remaining  state law claims,\r\n\nwithout stating its grounds.  Plaintiffs appealed.  \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          A grant of summary judgment  is reviewed de novo  under\r                                                                    \r\n\nthe same  criteria incumbent upon  the district court;  it cannot\r\n\nstand on appeal unless the record  discloses no trialworthy issue\r\n\nof material  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as\r\n\na matter of law.

We have  been presented\r\n\nwith no basis in law or reason for departing from this solid line\r\n\nof authority.\r\n\n          During  the  arrest,  Sergeant Leporati  stated  to Mr.\r\n\nAlexis:  \"You people have no rights.

Given its context, we cannot\r\n\nagree.\r\n\n          A rational factfinder who  credited this statement,  as\r\n\nwe must at summary  judgment, see supra note 1,  reasonably could\r                                                 \r\n\ninfer that Leporati harbored a racial animus  adequate to support\r\n\na section 1981 claim,  especially since the record reflects  that\r\n\nthe  only relevant  behavior or  physical characteristic     both\r                   \r\n\napparent to Leporati and shared by the Alexis family    was their\r                                         \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nblack skin.  Indeed, a rational factfinder would be  hard-pressed\r\n\nto glean a more  plausible inference, particularly since Leporati\r\n\nhas  tendered  no  alternative  interpretation supported  by  the\r\n\npresent  record.6   Viewed  in context,  therefore, the  Leporati\r\n\nstatement, tarring  the  entire family  with  the same  brush    \r\n\nabsent a scintilla of evidence that any member, with the possible\r\n\nexception  of Alexis, had said or done anything remotely wrong or\r\n\ndisorderly     cannot reasonably  be presumed so  innocent as  to\r                                                                           \r\n\npreclude a discriminatory animus.\r                  \r\n\n          Accordingly,  we  hold  that  the evidence  adduced  at\r\n\nsummary judgment, viewed in context,  was sufficient to support a\r\n\nreasonable inference that Leporati not only gratuitously employed\r\n\nexcessive force  in arresting  Alexis but  that his actions  were\r\n\nmotivated by a racial animus violative of the \"equal benefit\" and\r\n\n\"like  punishment\"  clauses of  section  1981(a).   Thus,  Alexis\r\n\nraised  a  trialworthy issue  under  section 1981  as  to whether\r\n\nLeporati deprived her of \"the full and equal benefit\"  of the law\r\n\naccorded white  persons and the right  to \"like punishment  . . .\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6The only alternative interpretation advanced by Leporati is\r\nthat \"there are objective undisputed  facts which are contrary to\r\nplaintiffs' premise (i.e. that four black people were not ordered\r\nto  leave and were not  arrested).\"  The  undisputed facts flatly\r\ncontradict a material portion of Leporati's  parenthetical asser-\r\ntion, however.  When Leporati first confronted them in the dining\r\narea, he ordered the entire Alexis family to leave.  See supra p.\r                                                                        \r\n4.  After returning  to the service  counter to inform Domina  of\r\ntheir  refusal to leave, and upon learning that Topham recalled a\r\n\"problem\" with Alexis in the past, Leporati returned to the table\r\nand announced his  intention to  arrest only Alexis.   Given  his\r\ndecision to  arrest only  Alexis, Leporati's retort,  \"You people\r\nhave  no rights,\" accompanied by the  subsequent threat to arrest\r\nMr. Alexis, remains unexplained by any argumentation presented on\r\nappeal.  \r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\n[and] no other.\"  42 U.S.C.   1981(a).7\r\n\nB.

Finally, she alleges that\r\n\nLeporati  determined to arrest her, and effected her arrest, in a\r\n\ndiscriminatory  manner, based on her race and in violation of the\r\n\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\n\n     1.

First, the crime\r               \r\n\nfor  which she was  arrested    criminal trespass     is a misde-\r\n\nmeanor.  See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 266,   120 (maximum term 30\r                      \r\n\ndays).  Second, there is no suggestion that Alexis posed a threat\r\n\nto the peace or safety of anyone, including Sergeant Leporati and\r\n\nOfficer Fuer.  Third,  taking her evidence at face  value, Alexis\r\n\nneither  threatened nor attempted to evade or resist arrest.  Nor\r\n\ndid any Alexis  family member pose  a threat to  the officers  or\r\n\nanyone else.  Yet, without even having been requested or directed\r\n\nto  get  up from  the  table     and though  all  the surrounding\r\n\ncircumstances, individually and in combination, plainly counseled\r\n\nminimal  force in  effecting any  arrest     Alexis  was abruptly\r\n\npulled from  the  booth, and  across the  table, with  sufficient\r\n\nforce to bruise her  legs, then handcuffed with her  hands behind\r\n\nher back and  dragged and carried to a police  cruiser and pushed\r\n\ninside.\r\n\n          Viewed  in context  and accepted  as true,  we are  not\r\n\npersuaded that the record  evidence compelled the conclusion that\r\n\nthe force  with which Leporati effected  the sudden, unannounced,\r\n\nviolent seizure  and removal  of Alexis's person  was objectively\r\n\nreasonable, especially  since there is no  evidence or suggestion\r\n\nthat  she posed a  risk of flight,  attempted to resist  or evade\r\n\narrest,  or threatened  the  peace, property  or  safety of  any-\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\none.10   See Palmer  v.

I  concur in all  of the court's  holdings\r\n\nexcept the one dismissing the  section 1983 claim against Domina.\r\n\nThe  evidence taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs\r\n\nis sufficient, I believe, for a reasonable factfinder to conclude\r\n\nthat  there  was  a conspiracy  between  Domina  and  Leporati to\r\n\ndiscriminate against the plaintiff, Yvonne Alexis, because of the\r\n\ncolor of her skin.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n          The facts from which such a conspiracy could rationally\r\n\nbe inferred are  as follows.   A dispute  over an incorrect  food\r\n\norder occurred  at the McDonald's service  counter between plain-\r\n\ntiff Yvonne Alexis,  an African American woman, Donna Domina, the\r\n\n\"swing manager,\" and the  counterperson, Alfredo Pascacio.  After\r\n\nthe  dispute was  over, Shirley  Topham, a  McDonald's managerial\r\n\nemployee, went outside the restaurant for police assistance.  She\r\n\nreturned  with  Officer  Leporati,  a uniformed  off-duty  police\r\n\nofficer assigned  to McDonald's pursuant to  an agreement between\r\n\nMcDonald's and  the Town of Framingham.   Leporati conferred with\r\n\nboth Topham  and Domina,  who identified  Yvonne Alexis  as \"that\r\n\nblack woman.\"  Domina told Leporati that she wanted Alexis out of\r\n\nthe restaurant.   Domina made  this request even  though she  was\r\n\naware  Yvonne  Alexis  and  her family  had  already  taken seats\r\n\npreparatory to eating the food they had purchased.  \r\n\n          Officer Leporati neither asked Topham and Domina why he\r\n\nshould make  Alexis leave  the restaurant nor  made inquiries  of\r\n\n                                28\r\r\n\nanybody else  as to  the behavior of  the Alexis  family.   Based\r\n\nsolely on his initial discussion with Domina and Topham, Leporati\r\n\nproceeded  to the dining room  table where the  Alexis family sat\r\n\nquietly  eating their food.   He told Yvonne  Alexis that she and\r\n\nher  entire  family had  to leave  the  premises.   Yvonne Alexis\r\n\nstated that  they would  not leave  until  they finished  eating.\r\n\nUpon  hearing  this, Officer  Leporati left  the dining  area and\r\n\nconferred again with Topham and Domina.  He told them that Alexis\r\n\nrefused to leave.        During  this  second discussion,  Topham\r\n\nsaid she  had a  problem with  this woman  on  a prior  occasion.\r\n\nDomina then said, \"Well, if that's the case, then maybe we should\r\n\nhave  her leave.\"  Neither Domina  nor Officer Leporati requested\r\n\ninformation about the alleged prior problem with Alexis.  Signif-\r\n\nicantly,  Officer Leporati again failed  to inquire as  to why he\r\n\nwas being told to remove Alexis from the restaurant.  Instead, he\r\n\nsaid that \"it wouldn't be pretty\" but he would make Yvonne Alexis\r\n\nleave  if Domina wanted  him to.   Domina then told  him that she\r\n\nwanted Yvonne Alexis out of the restaurant.  \r\n\n          Officer  Leporati  returned  to  the  Alexis  table and\r\n\nnotified Yvonne Alexis that she would be arrested unless she left\r\n\nwithin  the ten  minutes  it would  take  his backup  cruiser  to\r\n\narrive.  Neither Yvonne nor any member of her family  left.  When\r\n\nthe cruiser  arrived, Officer  Leporati physically  pulled Yvonne\r\n\nAlexis out of her  seat and over the table  at which she and  her\r\n\nfamily  had been  eating, bruising  her in  the process.   Yvonne\r\n\nAlexis was then handcuffed, pushed into the cruiser, and taken to\r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\njail.\r\n\n          Both  Yvonne  Alexis  and  her  husband  protested  the\r\n\nviolent treatment  she received from Officer  Leporati during her\r\n\nremoval from the  restaurant.   At one juncture,  Mr. Alexis  ex-\r\n\nclaimed,  \"We have  rights,\"  to which  Officer Leporati  retort-\r\n\ned,\"You  people have no rights.   You better shut up your [exple-\r\n\ntive]  mouth before  I arrest  you too.\"   Officer  Leporati made\r\n\nthese comments while still inside the restaurant.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          The  majority  opinion's cursory  treatment  of Alexis'\r\n\nsection 1983  claims overlooks several factual  bases for finding\r\n\nthat there was a conspiracy within section 1983's \"under color of\r\n\nlaw\"  requirement  between Domina  and  Leporati.

City of Lawton v.

But, I\r\n\nam  persuaded by the fact  that Domina and  Leporati conferred on\r\n\n                                31\r\r\n\ntwo separate occasions before Alexis' brutal arrest.  The  record\r\n\nestablishes that Domina, not Leporati, made the decision to expel\r\n\nAlexis from McDonald's premises, and that she made  that decision\r\n\nwith the knowledge  that some harm  could befall Alexis  (Alexis'\r\n\nremoval \"would not be pretty\").  And it is clear that Domina knew\r\n\nthat Leporati would do as she requested.\r\n\n          Viewed  in context,  the  events  precipitating  Yvonne\r\n\nAlexis' claims against Domina cast a  long shadow of doubt on the\r\n\nmajority's  conclusion that  there was  \"no evidence\"  to suggest\r\n\nAlexis'  claims  against  Domina  should  have  survived  summary\r\n\njudgment.   The facts --  that Leporati consulted  with Domina on\r\n\ntwo occasions; that Leporati based his decision to  arrest Alexis\r\n\non Domina's order; and  that it could be found that both Leporati\r\n\nand  Domina took Yvonne Alexis'  race into account  --  certainly\r\n\nsuggest  something more  than independent,  race neutral,  police\r\n\naction.    A factfinder  could reasonably  infer that  Domina and\r\n\nLeporati  were acting in concert with one another according to an\r\n\ninformal  plan  whereby  Leporati  would eject  anyone  from  the\r\n\nrestaurant identified by Domina as a problem without independent-\r\n\nly investigating the situation.    \r\n\n          Evidence  of  such  substituted  judgment  arrangements\r\n\nprovides a basis  for extending section 1983 liability to private\r\n\nactors.   See Cruz  v. Donnelly, 727  F.2d 79, 81  (3d Cir. 1984)\r                                         \r\n\n(holding  evidence of  a  pre-arranged plan  to arrest  suspected\r\n\nshoplifters without independently  investigating the presence  of\r\n\nprobable  cause was  needed  to confer  section 1983  liability);\r\n\n                                32\r\r\n\nLusby, 749 F.2d at 1432-33.  While it generally does not  suffice\r               \r\n\nto show that a police officer fulfilled a private actor's request\r\n\nto  arrest someone,  courts  will impose  liability  where it  is\r\n\nevident  the  police officer  would  not have  acted  without the\r\n\nprivate  actor's order.   Cruz,  727 F.2d  at 81.   A  failure to\r                                        \r\n\ninvestigate, though not dispositive, has been deemed sufficiently\r\n\ndemonstrative of  conspiratorial conduct. See Lusby,  749 F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n1432.\r\n\n          Despite  the majority's  attempts to  do so,  this case\r\n\ncannot  be squared  with  the  holding  in Carey  v.  Continental\r                                                                           \r\n\nAirlines, Inc., 823 F.2d 1402 (10th Cir. 1987).  In that case the\r                        \r\n\nTenth Circuit found that there was no substituted  judgment where\r\n\na police officer was  called into an airport to arrest a striking\r\n\nairline pilot.  The police officer in Carey, however, was more of\r                                                     \r\n\nan  independent actor than the facts show Officer Leporati was in\r\n\nthis case.   That officer actually  conducted a separate  inquiry\r\n\ninto the  facts before arresting  the pilot.   823 F.2d  at 1403.\r\n\nOfficer Leporati  failed to investigate  at all, choosing  to act\r\n\nsolely at Domina's behest.  Additionally, it is worth noting that\r\n\nthe  use of  excessive force  and obvious  racial overtones  that\r\n\nmarked  Officer Leporati's actions in this  case were not present\r\n\nin Carey.  \r                  \r\n\n          The  current case  more closely  patterns Wagenmann  v.\r                                                                           \r\n\nAdams, 829 F.2d 196 (1st Cir. 1987), a case the majority attempts\r               \r\n\nto distinguish.  In that  case the private actor enjoyed a  close\r\n\nrelationship  with local  police  officers and  enlisted them  in\r\n\n                                33\r\r\n\ncarrying out a plan to eject a potential agitator from his  son's\r\n\nwedding  ceremony.  We held that a section 1983 conspiracy exist-\r\n\ned, concluding  that the defendant  in that case  was essentially\r\n\nusing the law  enforcement officials involved to achieve his own,\r\n\nunconstitutional ends. 829 F.2d at 211. \r\n\n          A  sound evidentiary basis exists for concluding Domina\r\n\nand Leporati adhered to a substituted  judgment policy not unlike\r\n\nthe one  deemed constitutionally violative in  Wagenmann.  First,\r                                                                  \r\n\nthe record reveals Domina,  not Leporati, as the impetus  for the\r\n\ndecision to eject Yvonne  Alexis.  Second,  Domina  and Leporati,\r\n\nas individuals who worked  at McDonald's, could be found  to have\r\n\nhad a  shared  understanding  to  deprive Yvonne  Alexis  of  her\r\n\nrights.   See Adickes v. Kress,  398 U.S. 144, 152  (1970).  Lep-\r                                        \r\n\norati worked the McDonald's detail on numerous occasions and must\r\n\nhave  had a  working  knowledge of  company  policy and  decision\r\n\nmaking  procedures  for  removals.   Finally,  the  conversations\r\n\nDomina  and Leporati  held  regarding Alexis  were sufficient  in\r\n\nduration  and  number to  cement  a  conspiracy.   These  factors\r\n\nconvince me  that the independent police  actions which persuaded\r\n\nthe  Tenth Circuit that no private liability existed in Carey are\r                                                                       \r\n\nnot present in this case.\r\n\n          I am not  dissuaded by the  absence of conclusive  evi-\r\n\ndence that an express plan to discriminate existed between Domina\r\n\nand Leporati.  The  Supreme Court has found a section 1983 viola-\r\n\ntion where there was no formal plan to  discriminate.  In Adickes\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  Kress  &amp; Co.,  398 U.S.  144 (1970),  the  Court held  that a\r                          \r\n\n                                34\r\r\n\npoliceman's  presence  in a  segregated  lunch  counter might  be\r\n\nenough to infer a  conspiracy between the police officer  and the\r\n\nestablishment, where the plaintiff  had both been refused service\r\n\nand  arrested.  In a notable decision the Seventh Circuit found a\r\n\nconspiracy  where the state  agents with  whom the  private actor\r\n\nconspired  were  not  actively  involved in  the  deprivation  of\r\n\nrights.   See Soldal v. County  of Cook, 942 F.2d  1073 (7th Cir.\r                                                 \r\n\n1991), rev'd  on other  grounds by 113  S.Ct. 538  (1992)(finding\r                                            \r\n\nthat private owner and deputy sheriffs conspired to \"get rid of a\r\n\npesky tenant\"  when sheriffs passively watched  an unlawful evic-\r\n\ntion).  It was not necessary that there be evidence of an express\r\n\nplan between Domina and Leporati to implicate section 1983.  \r\n\n          There was sufficient  evidence from which  a factfinder\r\n\ncould conclude that Domina and Officer Leporati conspired togeth-\r\n\ner to  deprive Yvonne Alexis of  her due process right  not to be\r\n\narrested  without probable  cause and  that such  deprivation was\r\n\nbased on the color of Alexis' skin.\r\n\n          For the  reasons discussed  above, I would  reverse the\r\n\njudgment of the district court on the section 1983 claims brought\r\n\nagainst Donna Domina.\r\n\n                                35\r\r\n",

When the food was placed before them at the service counter, it became apparent that Alfredo Pascacio, whose native tongue is Spanish, had mistaken their order.  During the ensuing exchange between Alexis and Pascacio, defendant-appellee Donna Domina, the \"swing manager,\" intervened in behalf of Pascacio, which prompted Alexis to say:  \"[Y]ou take care of the people in front of you.  He's taking care of me, and we're sorting this out.\"   Domina nonetheless persisted for several more minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, Domina said to Alexis, \"I don't have to listen to you.\"   Alexis replied, \"[Y]ou're damn right you don't have to listen to me.  I was not speaking to you.  I was speaking to him.\"   Domina then instructed Pascacio:  \"Just put their stuff in a bag and get them out of here.\"   Turning to Alexis, Domina retorted:  \"You're not eating here.  If you [do] we're going to call the cops.\"   Alexis responded:  \"Well you do what you have to do because we plan to eat here.\"   Notwithstanding Domina's instructions, Pascacio placed the food order on a service tray, without bagging it.  The entire incident at the service counter had lasted approximately ten minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Alexis family went into the dining area, Sherry Topham, a managerial employee, summoned defendant Michael Leporati into the restaurant.  Leporati, a uniformed off-duty police sergeant, had been patrolling on foot outside the restaurant by prearrangement with the Town of Framingham, but had witnessed no part of the earlier exchange among Alexis, Pascacio and Domina.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon entering the restaurant, Leporati was informed by Domina that Alexis had been yelling, creating a \"scene\" and an \"unwarranted disturbance\" over a mistaken food order, and directing abusive remarks at Pascacio.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Domina informed Leporati that Alexis had argued loudly with her and another employee;  that she \"just wasn't stopping\";  and that Alexis was still in the dining area though Domina had \"asked her to leave.\"   Finally, Domina told Leporati, \"I would like her to leave.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without further inquiry into the \"disturbance\" allegedly caused by Alexis, Leporati proceeded to the dining area where Alexis and her family were seated, and informed the entire Alexis family that the manager wanted them to leave and that they would have to go.  Alexis immediately asked why, denied causing any disturbance, and claimed a right to finish eating in the restaurant.  When she urged Leporati to ask other restaurant customers whether there had been any disturbance, Leporati simply reiterated that the family would have to leave, then returned to the service counter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the service counter, Leporati relayed his conversation with Alexis and informed Domina that the Alexis family had refused to leave.  In Leporati's presence, Domina discussed the matter with Sherry Topham, who recalled having had a \"problem\" with Alexis on a prior occasion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  At that point, Domina stated, \"Well, if that's the case, then maybe we should have her leave.\"   With that, Sergeant Leporati returned to the Alexis family and advised Alexis that she would be arrested unless she left before his backup arrived.  Cf. supra note 3.  Alexis reiterated that she believed she had the right to finish eating.  Leporati left the dining area to call for backup.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately ten minutes later, Officer William Fuer arrived and Alexis was told by Leporati that she was being placed under arrest.  Then, without asking or directing Alexis to get up from the table, Leporati suddenly and violently grabbed and pulled her bodily from the booth and across the table, handcuffed her hands tightly behind her back, and, with the help of Officer Fuer, dragged her from the booth, bruising her legs in the process.  Insisting that she was \"not resisting arrest,\" Alexis asked the officers to allow her to walk out.  Instead, they hoisted her by her elbows and carried her from the restaurant to the police car, where Leporati pushed her into the car with the instruction, \"Get your ass in there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As she was being removed from the restaurant, Alexis and her husband repeatedly asked the officers why she was being treated in this manner.  When Mr. Alexis said, \"We have rights,\" Leporati responded, \"You people have no rights.  You better shut up your [expletive] mouth before I arrest you too.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alexis eventually was charged with criminal trespass, a misdemeanor under Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 266, Sec. 120 (West 1994).  Following her acquittal by a jury, Alexis and her family filed the present action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, asserting civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981, 1983, &amp; 1985(3), as well as state law claims for use of excessive force, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, battery, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and abuse of process.  The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on all federal claims and on the excessive force claim against Leporati under Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 12, Sec. 11I.  Finally, the court granted summary judgment for all defendants on the remaining state law claims, without stating its grounds.  Plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo under the same criteria incumbent upon the district court;  it cannot stand on appeal unless the record discloses no trialworthy issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Contractors Ass'n v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 391, 102 S.Ct. 3141, 3150, 73 L.Ed.2d 835 (1982);  Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 17 (1st Cir.1989).  The district court found no competent evidence of intentional race-based discrimination.  Alexis presses her section 1981 claims against Domina and McDonald's on the theory that her race-based exclusion from the dining area violated her right to make and enforce contracts.  See 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  As to defendant Leporati, she alleges that her race-based arrest deprived her of the right to \"full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens,\" id. Sec. 1981(a), and to \"like punishment, pains, penalties ... of every kind, and to no other.\"   Id. (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Domina and McDonald's</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court initially excluded, as incompetent, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (affidavits may be considered at summary judgment only if facts attested to are based on admissible evidence);  Fed.R.Evid. 701, portions of the deposition testimony of six witnesses--the five Alexis family members and Karen Stauffer, an eyewitness to the events--each of whom opined, in effect, that had Alexis been \"a rich white woman,\" she would not have been treated in the same manner.  The court found that the proffered testimony was \"not supported by sufficient factual undergirding\" to permit a reasonable inference that either Domina or McDonald's discriminated against Alexis on the basis of her race.  The court nonetheless allowed Alexis further time to submit supplemental affidavits setting forth more particular grounds for the conclusory deposition testimony relating to racial animus.  Alexis failed to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Opinion testimony from lay witnesses is admissible only if it is \"rationally based on the perception of the witness and ... helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of the fact in issue.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 701;  see Swajian v. General Motors Corp., 916 F.2d 31, 36 (1st Cir.1990).  Rulings on the admissibility of lay opinion testimony are reviewed only for \"manifest abuse of discretion.\"  United States v. Jackman, 48 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1995) (citing Keller v. United States, 38 F.3d 16, 31 (1st Cir.1994)).  The exclusionary ruling was well within the district court's broad discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The six deponents based their inferences of racial animus on their personal observations that Domina reacted \"angrily\" toward Alexis and with \"a negative tone in her voice,\" was \"unfriendly,\" \"uncooperative,\" \"high strung,\" \"impolite,\" \"impatient,\" and had \"no reason\" to eject Alexis.  Although these observations may be entirely compatible with a race-based animus, there simply is no foundation for an inference that Domina harbored a racial animus toward Alexis or anyone else, absent some probative evidence that Domina's petulance stemmed from something other than a race-neutral reaction to the stressful encounter plainly evidenced in the summary judgment record, including Alexis's persistence (however justified).  As the depositions disclosed no evidentiary foundation for an inference of racial animus, the conclusory lay opinions were properly excluded.  See Fed.R.Evid. 701(a);  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a);  Willco Kuwait (Trading) S.A.K. v. deSavary, 843 F.2d 618, 624 (1st Cir.1988) (lay opinion testimony, which does little more than tell the jury what result to reach, should not be admitted);  see also Connell v. Bank of Boston, 924 F.2d 1169, 1177-78 (1st Cir.)  (lay opinion--that employer was \" 'determined to eliminate ... senior employees' \"--pointed to no specific facts sufficient to buttress such a \"broad assertion\") (ADEA claim), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1218, 111 S.Ct. 2828, 115 L.Ed.2d 997 (1991);  cf. Gross v. Burggraf Constr.  Co., 53 F.3d 1531, 1544 (10th Cir.1995) (determining inadmissible the lay opinion of co-worker that sexual harassment defendant had \" 'a problem with women who were not between the ages of 19 and 25 and who weighed more than 115 pounds' \");  Coca-Cola Co. v. Overland, Inc., 692 F.2d 1250, 1254-55 (9th Cir.1982) (upholding exclusion of lay opinion testimony by bar and restaurant employees that customers used term \"Coke\" in generic sense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Alexis points to no competent evidence that Domina and McDonald's intentionally discriminated against her on account of her race, the district court correctly ruled that this section 1981 claim was not trialworthy.  See Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at 18 (\" 'Disputes generally arise out of mutual misunderstanding, misinterpretation and overreaction, and without more, such disputes do not give rise to an inference of discrimination.' \")  (quoting Johnson v. Legal Servs. of Ark., Inc., 813 F.2d 893, 896 (8th Cir.1987)).  Accordingly, the summary judgment entered in favor of Domina and McDonald's must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Leporati</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All courts of appeals which have considered the question have held that a misuse of governmental power motivated by racial animus comes squarely within the \"equal benefit\" and \"like punishment\" clauses of section 1981(a).  See Mahone v. Waddle, 564 F.2d 1018, 1027-30 (3d Cir.1977) (false arrest), cert. denied, 438 U.S. 904, 98 S.Ct. 3122, 57 L.Ed.2d 1147 (1978);  see also Evans v. McKay, 869 F.2d 1341, 1344-45 (9th Cir.1989) (reversing dismissal of section 1981 claim alleging that police officers and others instigated \"racially-motivated arrest-boycott conspiracy\");  Coleman v. Franklin Parish Sch. Bd., 702 F.2d 74, 76-77 (5th Cir.1983) (remanding for factfinding on section 1981 claim that school officials denied black pupil equal benefit of laws and proceedings relating to corporal punishment).  We have been presented with no basis in law or reason for departing from this solid line of authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the arrest, Sergeant Leporati stated to Mr. Alexis:  \"You people have no rights.  You better shut up your ... mouth before I arrest you too.\"   Alexis insists that this statement betrayed a racial animus.  Leporati responds that the statement--\"You people have no rights\"--is too general to support the section 1981(a) claim.  Given its context, we cannot agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A rational factfinder who credited this statement, as we must at summary judgment, see supra note 1, reasonably could infer that Leporati harbored a racial animus adequate to support a section 1981 claim, especially since the record reflects that the only relevant behavior or physical characteristic--both apparent to Leporati and shared by the Alexis family--was their black skin.  Indeed, a rational factfinder would be hard-pressed to glean a more plausible inference, particularly since Leporati has tendered no alternative interpretation supported by the present record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Viewed in context, therefore, the Leporati statement, tarring the entire family with the same brush--absent a scintilla of evidence that any member, with the possible exception of Alexis, had said or done anything remotely wrong or disorderly--cannot reasonably be presumed so innocent as to preclude a discriminatory animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we hold that the evidence adduced at summary judgment, viewed in context, was sufficient to support a reasonable inference that Leporati not only gratuitously employed excessive force in arresting Alexis but that his actions were motivated by a racial animus violative of the \"equal benefit\" and \"like punishment\" clauses of section 1981(a).  Thus, Alexis raised a trial-worthy issue under section 1981 as to whether Leporati deprived her of \"the full and equal benefit\" of the law accorded white persons and the right to \"like punishment ... [and] no other.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>B. Section 1985(3)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alexis alleged that Leporati and Domina \"directly and explicitly conspired to deprive [her] of the equal protection, equal privileges and equal rights guaranteed to her under the Constitution and the laws of the United States\" in violation of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985(3).  A trialworthy section 1985(3) conspiracy claim requires competent evidence that \" 'some racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus' \" motivated the alleged conspirators.  Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, ----, 113 S.Ct. 753, 758, 122 L.Ed.2d 34 (1993) (quoting Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 102, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 1798, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971)).  Alexis predicated her section 1985(3) conspiracy claim on Sergeant Leporati's statement:  \"You people have no rights.\"   Although this evidence, viewed in context, is sufficient to enable a reasonable inference that Leporati harbored the requisite racial animus, see supra Section II.A.2, there is no evidence which would support such an inference as to Domina.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Section 1983</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gravamen of these federal claims is that Sergeant Leporati, acting under color of Massachusetts law, deprived Alexis of her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure of her person in effecting her misdemeanor arrest with excessive force, without a warrant and without probable cause.  She also claims that Domina deprived her of procedural due process by summoning Leporati into the restaurant and directing her removal under color of state law.  Finally, she alleges that Leporati determined to arrest her, and effected her arrest, in a discriminatory manner, based on her race and in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.

Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 225-26, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964);  Santiago v. Fenton, 891 F.2d 373, 383 (1st Cir.1989).  The \"probable cause\" analysis entails \" 'an objective assessment of the officer's actions in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him at the time' and not [an assessment of] the officer's state of mind at the time the challenged action was taken.\"  Maryland v. Macon, 472 U.S. 463, 470-71, 105 S.Ct. 2778, 2783, 86 L.Ed.2d 370 (1985) (quoting Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128, 136, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 1723, 56 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978)).  Probable cause will be found if \"the facts and circumstances within [the officer's] knowledge and of which [he] had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent [person] in believing that the [defendant] had committed or was committing an offense.\"  Rivera v.

Revocation of Invitation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although appellants argue that the district court erred in finding probable cause for Alexis's arrest, we perceive no error.  As previously noted, Alexis was arrested for criminal trespass, a misdemeanor under the applicable Massachusetts statute:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>Whoever, without right enters or remains in or upon the ... buildings ... of another, after having been forbidden so to do by the person who has lawful control of said premises ... shall be punished by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than thirty days or both such fine and imprisonment....  A person who is found committing such trespass may be arrested by a ... police officer and kept in custody in a convenient place, not more than twenty-four hours, Sunday excepted, until a complaint can be made against him for the offence, and he be taken upon a warrant issued upon such complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 266, Sec. 120 (emphasis added).  Thus, under chapter 266, section 120, a person who remains, without right, on the property of another commits a continuing misdemeanor for which she may be subjected to a warrantless arrest by a police officer provided there is probable cause.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The undisputed facts demonstrate that Domina expressly directed Alexis to leave the restaurant, but that Alexis nevertheless refused to leave until she and her family had finished eating.  Appellants cite no authority for their implicit suggestion that Massachusetts recognizes an exception to the seemingly absolute right of a private business owner to withdraw, without cause, its implied license to enter a business establishment.

See Stager v. G.E. Lothrop Theatres Co., 291 Mass. 464, 197 N.E. 86, 87 (1935) (finding that, \"[g]enerally speaking,\" a theater owner has an absolute right to revoke theater-goer's license to enter or remain on the premises);  cf.

Hood, 389 Mass. 581, 452 N.E.2d 188, 194 (1983) (stating that Massachusetts trespass statute \" 'protect[s] the rights of those in lawful control of property to forbid entrance by those whom they are unwilling to receive, and to exclude them if, having entered, those in control see fit to command them to leave' \") (quoting Commonwealth v.

Hellman Enters., Inc., 147 A.D.2d 788, 537 N.Y.S.2d 659, 661 (1989) (same).  Absent some invidious ulterior purpose, therefore, once proper notice has been given by the owner, and the business licensee nonetheless remains on the property, the Massachusetts trespass statute permits arrest of the uncooperative trespasser.

See supra Section II.A.1.  Thus, on the record evidence, Domina acted within her lawful authority--as \"the person [having] lawful control of said premises,\" Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 266, Sec. 120--in revoking Alexis's implied license to utilize McDonald's dining facilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>ii.

Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 162, 45 S.Ct. 280, 288, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925);  United States v. Drake, 673 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.1982).  Leporati effected this arrest based on the eyewitness report from Domina that Alexis had created an \"unwarranted disturbance\" and refused to leave the premises, and on the representation by Sherry Topham that there had been an unspecified \"problem\" with Alexis in the past.  An objectively reasonable police officer so informed by the person in charge of the business premises, see supra note 2, fairly could conclude that the implied license extended to Alexis had been revoked and that there was probable cause to believe that her continued presence constituted a criminal trespass.  See Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 266, Sec. 120 (\"A person ... found committing such trespass may be arrested by a ... police officer....\");  see also United States v. Figueroa, 818 F.2d 1020, 1023 (1st Cir.1987) (\"The constitutionality of a warrantless arrest 'depends ... upon whether, at the moment the arrest was made, the officers had probable cause to make it--whether at that moment the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent [person] in believing that the [defendant] had committed or was committing an offense.' \")  (quoting Beck, 379 U.S. at 91, 85 S.Ct. at 225).

Superior Court of P.R., 988 F.2d 252, 258 (1st Cir.1993);  42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 (providing remedy for deprivations \"under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage\" of any state or territory).  There are two components to the \"state action\" requirement.  First, the deprivation must be shown to have been caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the state, or by a rule of conduct imposed by the state, or by a person for whom the state is responsible.  Casa Marie, 988 F.2d at 258.   Second, the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor.  Id.  Where a private individual is a defendant in a section 1983 action, there must be a showing that the private party and the state actor jointly deprived plaintiff of her civil rights.  Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 209 (1st Cir.1987);  Casa Marie, 988 F.2d at 258-59;  see also Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S. 24, 27-28, 101 S.Ct. 183, 186-187, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980) (\"Private persons, jointly engaged with state officials in the challenged action, are acting 'under color' of law for purposes of Sec. 1983 actions.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no evidence of joint discriminatory action between Leporati and Domina--whether by plan, prearrangement, conspiracy, custom, or policy--which would enable a rational factfinder to conclude that Alexis's arrest resulted from concerted action tantamount to substituting the judgment of a private party for that of the police or allowing the private party to exercise state power.  Compare Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 209-11 (close relationship between private citizen and deputy police chief, together with evidence that private actor and police collectively determined to arrest plaintiff, raised inference that private actor was more than \"mere complainant\" and that a \"meeting of the minds\" occurred between police and private defendant sufficient to warrant finding that defendant was state actor) with Carey v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 823 F.2d 1402, 1404 (10th Cir.1987) (airline employee, who complained of striking airline pilot's presence in airport terminal and refusal to leave, found not to be state actor where police officer summoned to airport terminal asked pilot to leave and, upon pilot's refusal, called for three additional officers who escorted pilot to airport security station where he was arrested);  see also Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. 144, 152, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1605-06, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970) (holding that white schoolteacher, in company of six black youths denied service at lunch counter, would be entitled to relief under section 1983 upon proof that lunch counter employee and policeman had reached an understanding to deny service to teacher because she was a white person in company of blacks).  As there is no evidence in the summary judgment record from which it could fairly be inferred that Domina and Leporati had any understanding, tacit or explicit, to deprive Alexis of any right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States, we conclude that the district court correctly granted summary judgment for Domina on this section 1983 claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Excessive Force</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alexis asserts an \"excessive force\" claim under the Fourth Amendment, which guarantees citizens the right \"to be secure in their persons ... against unreasonable ... seizures.\"   See Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1871, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (\"Where [an] excessive force claim arises in the context of an arrest or investigatory stop of a free citizen, it is most properly characterized as one invoking the protections of the Fourth Amendment....\").  In the Fourth Amendment setting, a viable excessive force claim must demonstrate that the police defendant's actions were not objectively reasonable, viewed in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him and without regard to his underlying intent or motivation.  Id. at 397, 109 S.Ct. at 1872 (\"An officer's evil intentions will not make a Fourth Amendment violation out of an objectively reasonable use of force;  nor will an officer's good intentions make an objectively unreasonable use of force constitutional.\")  (citations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Supreme Court has counseled, our inquiry must be undertaken from the perspective of \"a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\"  Id. at 396, 109 S.Ct. at 1872 (citations omitted).  Though the reasonableness test under the Fourth Amendment \" 'is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application,' \" id.  (quoting Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979)), \" '[n]ot every push or shove' \" will reach the level required for an actionable \"excessive force\" claim.  Id.

Salem, 923 F.2d 203, 205 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[P]olice officers making arrests are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force needed to effect an arrest while operating under tense, dangerous and rapidly-changing circumstances.\"), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 956, 111 S.Ct. 2266, 114 L.Ed.2d 718 (1991).  Accordingly, Graham prescribes three criteria for evaluating the objective reasonableness of the force used:  (1) \"the severity of the crime at issue;\"  (2) \"whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others;\"  and (3) \"whether [the suspect] is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\"   Graham, 490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. at 1872;  see also Gaudreault, 923 F.2d at 205.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All three Graham factors, viewed in the context of \"the totality of the circumstances,\" Graham, 490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. at 1872;  see also supra p. 346, weigh heavily in favor of Alexis.  First, the crime for which she was arrested--criminal trespass--is a misdemeanor.  See Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 266, Sec. 120 (maximum term 30 days).  Second, there is no suggestion that Alexis posed a threat to the peace or safety of anyone, including Sergeant Leporati and Officer Fuer.  Third, taking her evidence at face value, Alexis neither threatened nor attempted to evade or resist arrest.  Nor did any Alexis family member pose a threat to the officers or anyone else.  Yet, without even having been requested or directed to get up from the table--and though all the surrounding circumstances, individually and in combination, plainly counseled minimal force in effecting any arrest--Alexis was abruptly pulled from the booth, and across the table, with sufficient force to bruise her legs, then handcuffed with her hands behind her back and dragged and carried to a police cruiser and pushed inside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in context and accepted as true, we are not persuaded that the record evidence compelled the conclusion that the force with which Leporati effected the sudden, unannounced, violent seizure and removal of Alexis's person was objectively reasonable, especially since there is no evidence or suggestion that she posed a risk of flight, attempted to resist or evade arrest, or threatened the peace, property or safety of anyone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See Palmer v.

Equal Protection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alexis claims that Leporati discriminated against her on the basis of her race, both in deciding to enforce the criminal trespass statute by effecting her immediate arrest, and by employing unreasonable force.

Harris County, 21 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.1994).  This she did.  See supra Section II.A.2.  A rational factfinder, who credited Alexis's evidence of racial animus and excessive force, could conclude that Leporati resolved, on the basis of her race, to enforce the criminal trespass statute by effecting an immediate seizure of her person.  See Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 373-74, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 1073, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886) (\"[I]f [the law] is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and an unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the constitution.\");  Johnson, 876 F.2d at 479 (plaintiff stated viable Equal Protection Clause claim, where officer humiliated and harassed plaintiff prior to and during lawful arrest on basis of plaintiff's race);  United States v.

Heise, 879 F.2d 572, 580 n. 5 (9th Cir.1989) (where plaintiff alleged \"equal protection\" violation, police officers' \"mere compliance\" with state law would not shield them from liability under Sec. 1983, provided plaintiff could prove that officers' motivation for arrest was to harass plaintiff because of his religious beliefs).  Furthermore, a rational factfinder could conclude that, in electing to use excessive force to effect the violent seizure of Alexis's person and her forcible removal from the restaurant, Leporati was motivated by a discriminatory animus.  See Smith v. Fontana, 818 F.2d 1411, 1420 (9th Cir.)

The evidence taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs is sufficient, I believe, for a reasonable factfinder to conclude that there was a conspiracy between Domina and Leporati to discriminate against the plaintiff, Yvonne Alexis, because of the color of her skin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts from which such a conspiracy could rationally be inferred are as follows.  A dispute over an incorrect food order occurred at the McDonald's service counter between plaintiff Yvonne Alexis, an African American woman, Donna Domina, the \"swing manager,\" and the counterperson, Alfredo Pascacio.  After the dispute was over, Sherry Topham, a McDonald's managerial employee, went outside the restaurant for police assistance.  She returned with Officer Leporati, a uniformed off-duty police officer assigned to McDonald's pursuant to an agreement between McDonald's and the Town of Framingham.  Leporati conferred with both Topham and Domina, who identified Yvonne Alexis as \"that black woman.\"   Domina told Leporati that she wanted Alexis out of the restaurant.  Domina made this request even though she was aware Yvonne Alexis and her family had already taken seats preparatory to eating the food they had purchased.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Leporati neither asked Topham and Domina why he should make Alexis leave the restaurant nor made inquiries of anybody else as to the behavior of the Alexis family.  Based solely on his initial discussion with Domina and Topham, Leporati proceeded to the dining room table where the Alexis family sat quietly eating their food.  He told Yvonne Alexis that she and her entire family had to leave the premises.  Yvonne Alexis stated that they would not leave until they finished eating.  Upon hearing this, Officer Leporati left the dining area and conferred again with Topham and Domina.  He told them that Alexis refused to leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this second discussion, Topham said she had a problem with this woman on a prior occasion.  Domina then said, \"Well, if that's the case, then maybe we should have her leave.\"   Neither Domina nor Officer Leporati requested information about the alleged prior problem with Alexis.  Significantly, Officer Leporati again failed to inquire as to why he was being told to remove Alexis from the restaurant.  Instead, he said that \"it wouldn't be pretty\" but he would make Yvonne Alexis leave if Domina wanted him to.  Domina then told him that she wanted Yvonne Alexis out of the restaurant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Leporati returned to the Alexis table and notified Yvonne Alexis that she would be arrested unless she left within the ten minutes it would take his backup cruiser to arrive.  Neither Yvonne nor any member of her family left.  When the cruiser arrived, Officer Leporati physically pulled Yvonne Alexis out of her seat and over the table at which she and her family had been eating, bruising her in the process.  Yvonne Alexis was then handcuffed, pushed into the cruiser, and taken to jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Yvonne Alexis and her husband protested the violent treatment she received from Officer Leporati during her removal from the restaurant.  At one juncture, Mr. Alexis exclaimed, \"We have rights,\" to which Officer Leporati retorted, \"You people have no rights.  You better shut up your [expletive] mouth before I arrest you too.\"   Officer Leporati made these comments while still inside the restaurant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion's cursory treatment of Alexis' section 1983 claims overlooks several factual bases for finding that there was a conspiracy within section 1983's \"under color of law\" requirement between Domina and Leporati.  See Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 928, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 2749, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982) (\" 'under color of law' has consistently been treated as the same thing as the 'state action' required under the Fourteenth Amendment\").

Assocs., 57 F.3d 119, 122 (1st Cir.1995), supports the view that Alexis' arrest resulted from concerted action between Domina and Leporati.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1983 conspiracies are \"commonly defined as 'a combination of two or more persons acting in concert to commit an unlawful act, or to commit a lawful act by unlawful means, the principal element of which is an agreement between the parties to inflict a wrong against or injury upon another'....\"  Earle v. Benoit, 850 F.2d 836, 844 (1st Cir.1988) (quoting Hampton v. Hanrahan, 600 F.2d 600, 620-21 (7th Cir.1979), rev'd in part on other grounds, 446 U.S. 754, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980)).  Under this definition, section 1983 liability attaches to private actors deemed \"willful participant[s] in [a] joint action with a State or its agents.\"  Lugar, 457 U.S. at 941, 102 S.Ct. at 2756;  Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S. 24, 27, 101 S.Ct. 183, 186, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980);  Casa Marie, Inc. v. Superior Court of Puerto Rico, 988 F.2d 252, 259 (1st Cir.1993).  And joint action may be proved by circumstantial evidence of a prearranged conspiracy.  See Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 211 (1st Cir.1987);  see also Moore v. Marketplace Restaurant, Inc., 754 F.2d 1336, 1352 (7th Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not contend that joint action existed in this case because Leporati worked the McDonald's detail or that Domina's supervisor, Sherry Topham, requested his assistance.  This court has clearly stated that \"merely initiating a good faith request for police protection would not attach liability for the subsequent unconstitutional conduct of arresting officers.\"  Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 210;  see also Lusby v. T.G. &amp; Y. Stores, Inc., 749 F.2d 1423, 1433 (10th Cir.1984), vacated on other grounds sub nom.  City of Lawton v. Lusby, 474 U.S. 805, 106 S.Ct. 40, 88 L.Ed.2d 33 (1985), aff'd by 796 F.2d 1307 (10th Cir.1986) (a store that employs an off-duty police officer is not vicariously liable under section 1983 for such officer's deprivation of customer's civil rights).  But, I am persuaded by the fact that Domina and Leporati conferred on two separate occasions before Alexis' brutal arrest.  The record establishes that Domina, not Leporati, made the decision to expel Alexis from McDonald's premises, and that she made that decision with the knowledge that some harm could befall Alexis (Alexis' removal \"would not be pretty\").  And it is clear that Domina knew that Leporati would do as she requested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in context, the events precipitating Yvonne Alexis' claims against Domina cast a long shadow of doubt on the majority's conclusion that there was \"no evidence\" to suggest Alexis' claims against Domina should have survived summary judgment.  The facts--that Leporati consulted with Domina on two occasions;  that Leporati based his decision to arrest Alexis on Domina's order;  and that it could be found that both Leporati and Domina took Yvonne Alexis' race into account--certainly suggest something more than independent, race neutral, police action.  A factfinder could reasonably infer that Domina and Leporati were acting in concert with one another according to an informal plan whereby Leporati would eject anyone from the restaurant identified by Domina as a problem without independently investigating the situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of such substituted judgment arrangements provides a basis for extending section 1983 liability to private actors.  See Cruz v. Donnelly, 727 F.2d 79, 81 (3d Cir.1984) (holding evidence of a pre-arranged plan to arrest suspected shoplifters without independently investigating the presence of probable cause was needed to confer section 1983 liability);  Lusby, 749 F.2d at 1432-33.   While it generally does not suffice to show that a police officer fulfilled a private actor's request to arrest someone, courts will impose liability where it is evident the police officer would not have acted without the private actor's order.  Cruz, 727 F.2d at 81.   A failure to investigate, though not dispositive, has been deemed sufficiently demonstrative of conspiratorial conduct.  See Lusby, 749 F.2d at 1432.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the majority's attempts to do so, this case cannot be squared with the holding in Carey v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 823 F.2d 1402 (10th Cir.1987).  In that case the Tenth Circuit found that there was no substituted judgment where a police officer was called into an airport to arrest a striking airline pilot.  The police officer in Carey, however, was more of an independent actor than the facts show Officer Leporati was in this case.  That officer actually conducted a separate inquiry into the facts before arresting the pilot.  823 F.2d at 1403.   Officer Leporati failed to investigate at all, choosing to act solely at Domina's behest.  Additionally, it is worth noting that the use of excessive force and obvious racial overtones that marked Officer Leporati's actions in this case were not present in Carey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The current case more closely patterns Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196 (1st Cir.1987), a case the majority attempts to distinguish.  In that case the private actor enjoyed a close relationship with local police officers and enlisted them in carrying out a plan to eject a potential agitator from his son's wedding ceremony.  We held that a section 1983 conspiracy existed, concluding that the defendant in that case was essentially using the law enforcement officials involved to achieve his own, unconstitutional ends.  829 F.2d at 211.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sound evidentiary basis exists for concluding Domina and Leporati adhered to a substituted judgment policy not unlike the one deemed constitutionally violative in Wagenmann.   First, the record reveals Domina, not Leporati, as the impetus for the decision to eject Yvonne Alexis.  Second, Domina and Leporati, as individuals who worked at McDonald's, could be found to have had a shared understanding to deprive Yvonne Alexis of her rights.  See Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. 144, 152, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1605-06, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970).  Leporati worked the McDonald's detail on numerous occasions and must have had a working knowledge of company policy and decision making procedures for removals.  Finally, the conversations Domina and Leporati held regarding Alexis were sufficient in duration and number to cement a conspiracy.  These factors convince me that the independent police actions which persuaded the Tenth Circuit that no private liability existed in Carey are not present in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I am not dissuaded by the absence of conclusive evidence that an express plan to discriminate existed between Domina and Leporati.  The Supreme Court has found a section 1983 violation where there was no formal plan to discriminate.  In Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. 144, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970), the Court held that a policeman's presence in a segregated lunch counter might be enough to infer a conspiracy between the police officer and the establishment, where the plaintiff had both been refused service and arrested.  In a notable decision the Seventh Circuit found a conspiracy where the state agents with whom the private actor conspired were not actively involved in the deprivation of rights.  See Soldal v. County of Cook, 942 F.2d 1073 (7th Cir.1991), rev'd on other grounds by 506 U.S. 56, 113 S.Ct. 538, 121 L.Ed.2d 450 (1992) (finding that private owner and deputy sheriffs conspired to \"get rid of a pesky tenant\" when sheriffs passively watched an unlawful eviction).  It was not necessary that there be evidence of an express plan between Domina and Leporati to implicate section 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was sufficient evidence from which a factfinder could conclude that Domina and Officer Leporati conspired together to deprive Yvonne Alexis of her due process right not to be arrested without probable cause and that such deprivation was based on the color of Alexis' skin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons discussed above, I would reverse the judgment of the district court on the section 1983 claims brought against Donna Domina.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The material facts in genuine dispute are related in the light most favorable to plaintiffs-appellants, against whom summary judgment was entered.

When Leporati first confronted them in the dining area, he ordered the entire Alexis family to leave.  See supra p. 345-46.  After returning to the service counter to inform Domina of their refusal to leave, and upon learning that Topham recalled a \"problem\" with Alexis in the past, Leporati returned to the table and announced his intention to arrest only Alexis.  Given his decision to arrest only Alexis, Leporati's retort, \"You people have no rights,\" accompanied by the subsequent threat to arrest Mr. Alexis, remains unexplained by any argumentation presented on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Of course, qualified immunity may be available to a police defendant in a Sec. 1981 action.

Mississippi St. Employment Servs., 41 F.3d 991, 996 n. 21 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2555, 132 L.Ed.2d 809 (1995);  Gallegos v.

Yerardi's Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. v. Board of Selectmen, 878 F.2d 16, 19-21 (1st Cir.1989) (recognizing qualified immunity defense to Sec. 1983 equal protection claim analogous to \"equal benefit\" claim in instant case).  Nevertheless, qualified immunity does \"not bar inquiry into a defendant's state of mind when the applicable law makes the defendant's state of mind (as distinct from defendant's knowledge of the law) an essential element of plaintiff's constitutional claim.\"  Feliciano-Angulo v. Rivera-Cruz, 858 F.2d 40, 46 (1st Cir.1988);  see also Tompkins v.

Thus, whether Leporati violated Alexis's civil rights under Sec. 1981(a) turns on a material issue of fact in genuine dispute, which precluded summary judgment.  See Feliciano-Angulo, 858 F.2d at 47;  see also Johnson v.

When the food was placed before them at the service counter, it became apparent that Alfredo Pascacio, whose native tongue is Spanish, had mistaken their order.  During the ensuing exchange between Alexis and Pascacio, defendant-appellee Donna Domina, the \"swing manager,\" intervened in behalf of Pascacio, which prompted Alexis to say:  \"[Y]ou take care of the people in front of you.  He's taking care of me, and we're sorting this out.\"   Domina nonetheless persisted for several more minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, Domina said to Alexis, \"I don't have to listen to you.\"   Alexis replied, \"[Y]ou're damn right you don't have to listen to me.  I was not speaking to you.  I was speaking to him.\"   Domina then instructed Pascacio:  \"Just put their stuff in a bag and get them out of here.\"   Turning to Alexis, Domina retorted:  \"You're not eating here.  If you [do] we're going to call the cops.\"   Alexis responded:  \"Well you do what you have to do because we plan to eat here.\"   Notwithstanding Domina's instructions, Pascacio placed the food order on a service tray, without bagging it.  The entire incident at the service counter had lasted approximately ten minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Alexis family went into the dining area, Sherry Topham, a managerial employee, summoned defendant Michael Leporati into the restaurant.  Leporati, a uniformed off-duty police sergeant, had been patrolling on foot outside the restaurant by prearrangement with the Town of Framingham, but had witnessed no part of the earlier exchange among Alexis, Pascacio and Domina.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon entering the restaurant, Leporati was informed by Domina that Alexis had been yelling, creating a \"scene\" and an \"unwarranted disturbance\" over a mistaken food order, and directing abusive remarks at Pascacio.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Domina informed Leporati that Alexis had argued loudly with her and another employee;  that she \"just wasn't stopping\";  and that Alexis was still in the dining area though Domina had \"asked her to leave.\"   Finally, Domina told Leporati, \"I would like her to leave.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without further inquiry into the \"disturbance\" allegedly caused by Alexis, Leporati proceeded to the dining area where Alexis and her family were seated, and informed the entire Alexis family that the manager wanted them to leave and that they would have to go.  Alexis immediately asked why, denied causing any disturbance, and claimed a right to finish eating in the restaurant.  When she urged Leporati to ask other restaurant customers whether there had been any disturbance, Leporati simply reiterated that the family would have to leave, then returned to the service counter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the service counter, Leporati relayed his conversation with Alexis and informed Domina that the Alexis family had refused to leave.  In Leporati's presence, Domina discussed the matter with Sherry Topham, who recalled having had a \"problem\" with Alexis on a prior occasion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  At that point, Domina stated, \"Well, if that's the case, then maybe we should have her leave.\"   With that, Sergeant Leporati returned to the Alexis family and advised Alexis that she would be arrested unless she left before his backup arrived.  Cf. supra note 3.  Alexis reiterated that she believed she had the right to finish eating.  Leporati left the dining area to call for backup.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately ten minutes later, Officer William Fuer arrived and Alexis was told by Leporati that she was being placed under arrest.  Then, without asking or directing Alexis to get up from the table, Leporati suddenly and violently grabbed and pulled her bodily from the booth and across the table, handcuffed her hands tightly behind her back, and, with the help of Officer Fuer, dragged her from the booth, bruising her legs in the process.  Insisting that she was \"not resisting arrest,\" Alexis asked the officers to allow her to walk out.  Instead, they hoisted her by her elbows and carried her from the restaurant to the police car, where Leporati pushed her into the car with the instruction, \"Get your ass in there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As she was being removed from the restaurant, Alexis and her husband repeatedly asked the officers why she was being treated in this manner.  When Mr. Alexis said, \"We have rights,\" Leporati responded, \"You people have no rights.  You better shut up your [expletive] mouth before I arrest you too.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alexis eventually was charged with criminal trespass, a misdemeanor under Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 266, Sec. 120 (West 1994).  Following her acquittal by a jury, Alexis and her family filed the present action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, asserting civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981, 1983, &amp; 1985(3), as well as state law claims for use of excessive force, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, battery, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and abuse of process.  The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on all federal claims and on the excessive force claim against Leporati under Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 12, Sec. 11I.  Finally, the court granted summary judgment for all defendants on the remaining state law claims, without stating its grounds.

Indeed, a rational factfinder would be hard-pressed to glean a more plausible inference, particularly since Leporati has tendered no alternative interpretation supported by the present record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Viewed in context, therefore, the Leporati statement, tarring the entire family with the same brush--absent a scintilla of evidence that any member, with the possible exception of Alexis, had said or done anything remotely wrong or disorderly--cannot reasonably be presumed so innocent as to preclude a discriminatory animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we hold that the evidence adduced at summary judgment, viewed in context, was sufficient to support a reasonable inference that Leporati not only gratuitously employed excessive force in arresting Alexis but that his actions were motivated by a racial animus violative of the \"equal benefit\" and \"like punishment\" clauses of section 1981(a).  Thus, Alexis raised a trial-worthy issue under section 1981 as to whether Leporati deprived her of \"the full and equal benefit\" of the law accorded white persons and the right to \"like punishment ...

The district court judgment entered in favor of Leporati on the section 1981, excessive force, and Equal Protection Clause claims is vacated, and these claims are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, along with all pendent state law claims against Leporati, see 28 U.S.C.

The evidence taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs is sufficient, I believe, for a reasonable factfinder to conclude that there was a conspiracy between Domina and Leporati to discriminate against the plaintiff, Yvonne Alexis, because of the color of her skin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts from which such a conspiracy could rationally be inferred are as follows.  A dispute over an incorrect food order occurred at the McDonald's service counter between plaintiff Yvonne Alexis, an African American woman, Donna Domina, the \"swing manager,\" and the counterperson, Alfredo Pascacio.  After the dispute was over, Sherry Topham, a McDonald's managerial employee, went outside the restaurant for police assistance.  She returned with Officer Leporati, a uniformed off-duty police officer assigned to McDonald's pursuant to an agreement between McDonald's and the Town of Framingham.  Leporati conferred with both Topham and Domina, who identified Yvonne Alexis as \"that black woman.\"   Domina told Leporati that she wanted Alexis out of the restaurant.  Domina made this request even though she was aware Yvonne Alexis and her family had already taken seats preparatory to eating the food they had purchased.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Leporati neither asked Topham and Domina why he should make Alexis leave the restaurant nor made inquiries of anybody else as to the behavior of the Alexis family.  Based solely on his initial discussion with Domina and Topham, Leporati proceeded to the dining room table where the Alexis family sat quietly eating their food.  He told Yvonne Alexis that she and her entire family had to leave the premises.  Yvonne Alexis stated that they would not leave until they finished eating.  Upon hearing this, Officer Leporati left the dining area and conferred again with Topham and Domina.  He told them that Alexis refused to leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this second discussion, Topham said she had a problem with this woman on a prior occasion.  Domina then said, \"Well, if that's the case, then maybe we should have her leave.\"   Neither Domina nor Officer Leporati requested information about the alleged prior problem with Alexis.  Significantly, Officer Leporati again failed to inquire as to why he was being told to remove Alexis from the restaurant.  Instead, he said that \"it wouldn't be pretty\" but he would make Yvonne Alexis leave if Domina wanted him to.  Domina then told him that she wanted Yvonne Alexis out of the restaurant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Leporati returned to the Alexis table and notified Yvonne Alexis that she would be arrested unless she left within the ten minutes it would take his backup cruiser to arrive.  Neither Yvonne nor any member of her family left.  When the cruiser arrived, Officer Leporati physically pulled Yvonne Alexis out of her seat and over the table at which she and her family had been eating, bruising her in the process.  Yvonne Alexis was then handcuffed, pushed into the cruiser, and taken to jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Yvonne Alexis and her husband protested the violent treatment she received from Officer Leporati during her removal from the restaurant.  At one juncture, Mr. Alexis exclaimed, \"We have rights,\" to which Officer Leporati retorted, \"You people have no rights.  You better shut up your [expletive] mouth before I arrest you too.\"   Officer Leporati made these comments while still inside the restaurant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion's cursory treatment of Alexis' section 1983 claims overlooks several factual bases for finding that there was a conspiracy within section 1983's \"under color of law\" requirement between Domina and Leporati.

But, I am persuaded by the fact that Domina and Leporati conferred on two separate occasions before Alexis' brutal arrest.  The record establishes that Domina, not Leporati, made the decision to expel Alexis from McDonald's premises, and that she made that decision with the knowledge that some harm could befall Alexis (Alexis' removal \"would not be pretty\").  And it is clear that Domina knew that Leporati would do as she requested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in context, the events precipitating Yvonne Alexis' claims against Domina cast a long shadow of doubt on the majority's conclusion that there was \"no evidence\" to suggest Alexis' claims against Domina should have survived summary judgment.  The facts--that Leporati consulted with Domina on two occasions;  that Leporati based his decision to arrest Alexis on Domina's order;  and that it could be found that both Leporati and Domina took Yvonne Alexis' race into account--certainly suggest something more than independent, race neutral, police action.  A factfinder could reasonably infer that Domina and Leporati were acting in concert with one another according to an informal plan whereby Leporati would eject anyone from the restaurant identified by Domina as a problem without independently investigating the situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of such substituted judgment arrangements provides a basis for extending section 1983 liability to private actors.  See Cruz v. Donnelly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430985\"><a href=\"/opinion/430985/modesto-cruz-v-peter-donnelly-john-adams-a-p-food-stores-and-william/\"><span class=\"volume\">727</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 81 (3d Cir.1984) (holding evidence of a pre-arranged plan to arrest suspected shoplifters without independently investigating the presence of probable cause was needed to confer section 1983 liability);  Lusby, 749 F.2d at 1432-33.   While it generally does not suffice to show that a police officer fulfilled a private actor's request to arrest someone, courts will impose liability where it is evident the police officer would not have acted without the private actor's order.  Cruz, 727 F.2d at 81.   A failure to investigate, though not dispositive, has been deemed sufficiently demonstrative of conspiratorial conduct.  See Lusby, 749 F.2d at 1432.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the majority's attempts to do so, this case cannot be squared with the holding in Carey v.

In that case the Tenth Circuit found that there was no substituted judgment where a police officer was called into an airport to arrest a striking airline pilot.  The police officer in Carey, however, was more of an independent actor than the facts show Officer Leporati was in this case.  That officer actually conducted a separate inquiry into the facts before arresting the pilot.  823 F.2d at 1403.   Officer Leporati failed to investigate at all, choosing to act solely at Domina's behest.  Additionally, it is worth noting that the use of excessive force and obvious racial overtones that marked Officer Leporati's actions in this case were not present in Carey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The current case more closely patterns Wagenmann v.

In that case the private actor enjoyed a close relationship with local police officers and enlisted them in carrying out a plan to eject a potential agitator from his son's wedding ceremony.  We held that a section 1983 conspiracy existed, concluding that the defendant in that case was essentially using the law enforcement officials involved to achieve his own, unconstitutional ends.  829 F.2d at 211.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sound evidentiary basis exists for concluding Domina and Leporati adhered to a substituted judgment policy not unlike the one deemed constitutionally violative in Wagenmann.   First, the record reveals Domina, not Leporati, as the impetus for the decision to eject Yvonne Alexis.  Second, Domina and Leporati, as individuals who worked at McDonald's, could be found to have had a shared understanding to deprive Yvonne Alexis of her rights.  See Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108153\"><a href=\"/opinion/108153/adickes-v-sh-kress-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span>, 152, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108153\"><a href=\"/opinion/108153/adickes-v-sh-kress-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span> (1970).  Leporati worked the McDonald's detail on numerous occasions and must have had a working knowledge of company policy and decision making procedures for removals.  Finally, the conversations Domina and Leporati held regarding Alexis were sufficient in duration and number to cement a conspiracy.  These factors convince me that the independent police actions which persuaded the Tenth Circuit that no private liability existed in Carey are not present in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I am not dissuaded by the absence of conclusive evidence that an express plan to discriminate existed between Domina and Leporati.  The Supreme Court has found a section 1983 violation where there was no formal plan to discriminate.  In Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108153\"><a href=\"/opinion/108153/adickes-v-sh-kress-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108153\"><a href=\"/opinion/108153/adickes-v-sh-kress-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
