Their claims were related to incidents of\n\n\n\n1\n    We use initials to protect the privacy of those who were children at the time of the events.\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\nchild abuse by their foster, and later adoptive, parents, Scott and Drew Anne Hamrick (the\n\nHamricks).\n\n        The children contend that the trial court erred by (1) dismissing under CR 50 their claims\n\nregarding DSHS’s failure to investigate during the period before they were adopted, (2) adopting\n\na special verdict form that improperly asked the jury to apportion fault for both intentional torts\n\nand negligence, (3) excluding the testimony of two late-disclosed witnesses, and (4) speaking\n\ncandidly about personal political leanings in court. They also assert that (5) cumulative error\n\nviolated their rights to a fair trial.\n\n        In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that (1) DSHS has a duty of reasonable\n\ncare to protect children it places in foster homes based on a special relationship and that the\n\nplaintiffs produced sufficient evidence to avoid dismissal under CR 50 for claims regarding\n\nDSHS’s negligence during the period before the children were adopted. In the unpublished\n\nportion we hold that (2) the trial court erred by submitting an incorrect special verdict form to the\n\njury, but the error was harmless for those claims; (3) the trial court erred in excluding the two\n\nwitnesses, but this error also was harmless; (4) the trial court did not create any appearance of\n\nunfairness by speaking about political matters; and (5) there was no cumulative error.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the trial court’s CR 50 ruling and remand for trial on the claim of\n\nnegligent failure to investigate and to appropriately protect foster children. We affirm the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment as to the remaining claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n                                             FACTS\n\n1.      Pre-Adoption Period\n\n        In February 1998, DSHS placed KMH in foster care with the Hamricks. Social worker\n\nAmy Page was assigned to KMH’s case and conducted health and safety checks. Page did not\n\nreceive any information or make any observations suggesting that the Hamricks were abusing\n\nKMH or that the placement was otherwise harmful.\n\n        In October 1999, twins HBH and SAH were placed with the Hamricks as well. The twins\n\nhad been in other foster homes for the preceding seven years, and had suffered abuse and neglect\n\nin those homes. DSHS social worker Mary Woolridge was assigned to the twins’ cases.\n\nAccording to agency policies, Woolridge was supposed to conduct in-home health and safety\n\nchecks every 90 days at which she was to talk with the girls about their experiences in the home.\n\nHowever, evidence presented at trial indicated that Woolridge may not have conducted these\n\nvisits as required.\n\n        During this period, the Hamricks allegedly abused KMH, HBH, and SAH emotionally\n\nand physically, and abused SAH sexually. However, DSHS received no reports of any abuse,\n\nand individuals in contact with the children reported that they seemed happy.\n\n        In January 2000, DSHS placed KEH and JBH in the Hamricks’ home. Social worker\n\nLisa Gilman was assigned to their cases and conducted health and safety visits. Gilman did not\n\nreceive any indication that abuse was occurring in the Hamrick home. Page later took over as\n\ntheir assigned social worker, and similarly believed KEH and JBH were happy and doing well in\n\nthe home.\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n        In June 2000, DSHS conducted a home study to determine whether the Hamricks would\n\nbe suitable adoptive parents. The resulting report recommended that DSHS allow them to adopt\n\nall of the children.\n\n2.      Post-Adoption Period\n\n        In October 2000, the Hamricks adopted KMH, HBH, and SAH. In January 2003, they\n\nadopted KEH and JBH as well.\n\n        In April 2008, a school counselor reported suspected physical abuse of SAH. Child\n\nProtective Services (CPS) screened this report and decided not to investigate. In November\n\n2009, CPS received a referral related to Scott Hamrick’s alleged sexual contact with a juvenile\n\nneighbor girl. CPS apparently referred this incident to local law enforcement for criminal\n\ninvestigation but did not investigate the Hamrick household for abuse.\n\n        In March 2010, a neighbor reported possible abuse and neglect of KEH to CPS. CPS\n\ninvestigated this report, visiting the Hamrick household and interviewing the children and the\n\nHamricks. Ultimately, CPS determined that the report was unfounded.\n\n        In 2011, the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department began an investigation of allegations\n\nthat the Hamricks had abused KMH, HBH, SAH, KEH, and JBH. This investigation led DSHS\n\nto remove the children from the Hamrick home. Scott Hamrick committed suicide during the\n\ninvestigation, and Drew Ann Hamrick was charged with crimes related to the abuse.\n\n3.      Claims and Trial\n\n        In October 2011, HBH and SAH sued DSHS, claiming that its negligence in failing to\n\ninvestigate or take other protective action allowed the Hamricks to abuse them during their\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\nperiod as foster, and later adoptive, children in the Hamrick home. A guardian ad litem sued\n\nDSHS on similar grounds on behalf of KMH, KEH, and JBH, who were still juveniles at the\n\ntime, and the two cases were consolidated. Following an initial mistrial, the case was tried\n\nbeginning in February 2015.\n\n       Several days before trial began, the children disclosed two additional witnesses who\n\nwould testify concerning matters related to the 2009 CPS referral. The State objected to their\n\ntestimony. The trial court excluded the witnesses as a sanction for the children’s late disclosure,\n\nbelieving that the testimony would not add anything significant to the case.\n\n4.     CR 50 Motion\n\n       Following the close of both parties’ cases, the State moved under CR 50 for judgment as\n\na matter of law that, inter alia, DSHS was not negligent during the pre-adoption period or in\n\nrelation to the 2009 CPS referral. The trial court agreed with the State and granted the motion.\n\nAs to the pre-adoption period, it ruled:\n\n       there were so many people involved that were handling this prior to the adoption,\n       all of these other voices that were coming in saying, no, there was nothing to show\n       there was any abuse. I mean, absent — I mean, does it really matter whether Mary\n       Woolridge was or was not doing her health and safety visits[?]. . . . Seems to me\n       most of this case comes down to what did they know and when did they know it. .\n       . . I can’t really see there are any claims based on anything Mary Woolridge did or\n       did not do.\n\nReport of Proceedings (RP) (Mar. 5, 2015) at 83. As to the 2009 CPS referral, the court ruled\n\nthat “the fact they didn’t investigate it is not evidence of any kind of negligence on their part\n\nbecause they didn’t have any duty or obligation to investigate it.” RP (Mar. 5, 2015) at 82.\n\n5.     Special Verdict Form\n\n       The trial court provided the jury a special verdict form on which it was to document its\n\nverdicts as to negligence and the assignment of any resulting damages. The verdict form first\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\nasked the jury to decide whether DSHS was negligent in its treatment of the 2008 and 2010\n\nreferrals and whether its negligence proximately caused harm to the children. It then asked\n\nwhether certain other nonparties’ negligence proximately caused harm to KMH, HBH, SAH,\n\nKEH, and JBH. In accordance with the trial court’s CR 50 rulings, the verdict form included no\n\nquestions concerning the pre-adoption period or the 2009 referral.\n\n       The verdict form included several questions regarding damages. It asked the jury to\n\ndetermine “each plaintiff’s total amount of damages” as a dollar value. Clerk’s Papers (CP) at\n\n638. Next, it stated:\n\n       Assume that 100% represents the total combined negligence or fault that\n       proximately caused each plaintiff's damages. What percentage of this 100% is\n       attributable to each individual or entity, if any, for whom you answered “yes” in\n       answer to [the questions concerning DSHS’s and certain nonparties’ negligence]?\n       For each plaintiff, the percentage of fault must equal 100 %.\n\nCP at 638.\n\n       The verdict form next asked, “Were the intentional acts of the following individuals a\n\nproximate cause of any of the plaintiff[s’] damages?” CP at 638. Finally, the form asked:\n\n       What percentage of each plaintiff's damages were caused by . . . all of the\n       intentional conduct of [Scott and Drew Ann Hamrick], and what percentage of\n       plaintiff[s’] damages were caused by all of the negligent conduct you identified in\n       your answers to [the questions concerning negligence]? Your answer for each\n       plaintiff must total 100 %.\n\nCP at 639.\n\n6.     Outcome of Trial\n\n       The jury found that DSHS was not negligent in its treatment of either the 2008 or 2010\n\nCPS referrals. As a result, it did not calculate or assign any damages to the children on the\n\nspecial verdict form.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n       The plaintiffs moved for a new trial, arguing that the trial court had erred in its CR 50\n\nruling, its exclusion of the two witnesses’ testimony, and in providing the special verdict form.\n\nThe trial court denied the motion. The children now appeal.\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n                   I. CR 50 MOTION REGARDING PRE-ADOPTION NEGLIGENCE\n\n       The children argue that the trial court erred by dismissing their claims of negligence by\n\nDSHS during the pre-adoption period. Underlying this request is the contention that DSHS owes\n\na common law duty of reasonable care to protect children it places in foster homes. We agree.\n\nWe further hold that the children here established genuine issues of fact as to both breach and\n\ncausation and, therefore, that the trial court erred in granting the CR 50 motion and in declining\n\nto instruct the jury as to DSHS’s negligence during the pre-adoption period.\n\n1.     Standard of Review\n\n       We review de novo a trial court’s decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law\n\non a particular issue under CR 50. Estate of Bordon ex rel. Anderson v. Dep’t of Corr., 122 Wn.\n\nApp. 227, 240, 95 P.3d 764 (2004). Like the trial court, we must determine whether there is any\n\nlegally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to have found for a party with respect to\n\nthe issue. CR 50; Bordon, 122 Wn. App. at 240. We view all conflicting evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the nonmoving party, here KMH, HBH, SAH, KEH, and JBH. Bordon, 122\n\nWn. App. at 240.\n\n2.     Duty to Protect\n\n       The children argue that DSHS owes a duty of reasonable care to investigate the health\n\nand safety of children it places in foster homes based on a special protective relationship between\n\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\nthe agency and those children.2 We agree.\n\n       Liability in tort for negligence may lie only where the defendant owes the plaintiff a duty\n\nof care. Caulfield v. Kitsap County, 108 Wn. App. 242, 250, 29 P.3d 738 (2001). “As a general\n\nrule, there is no duty to prevent a third party from intentionally harming another unless ‘a special\n\nrelationship exists between the defendant and either the third party or the foreseeable victim of\n\nthe third party’s conduct.’” Niece v. Elmview Grp. Home, 131 Wn.2d 39, 43, 929 P.2d 420\n\n(1997) (quoting Hutchins v. 1001 Fourth Ave. Assocs., 116 Wn.2d 217, 227, 802 P.2d 1360\n\n(1991)); accord RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 315. Such a special relationship is\n\ncharacterized by either (1) a duty by one party to control the conduct of a third person or (2) a\n\nright by one party to the protection of the other. Niece, 131 Wn.2d at 43; Caulfield, 108 Wn.\n\nApp. 253; RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 315.\n\n       “Many special relationships give rise to a duty to prevent harms caused by the intentional\n\nor criminal conduct of third parties.” Niece, 131 Wn.2d at 44-45. Common examples include\n\nthe relationships between schools and their students, innkeepers and their guests, common\n\ncarriers and their passengers, and hospitals and their patients. Niece, 131 Wn.2d at 44; Caulfield,\n\n108 Wn. App. at 255. These relationships are “‘protective in nature, historically involving an\n\n\n\n\n2\n  The State argues that the trial court correctly dismissed the childrens’ negligent investigation\nclaims because DSHS did not breach the duty to investigate imposed by RCW 26.44.050. The\nduty to investigate under this statute arises “upon the receipt of a report concerning the possible\noccurrence of abuse or neglect [by] the law enforcement agency or the [DSHS].” RCW\n26.44.050; see also Albertson v. State, 191 Wn. App. 284, 301, 361 P.3d 808 (2015). The\nchildren argued in the trial court that DSHS breached its duty under RCW 26.44.050. However,\non appeal they expressly disclaim any argument based on RCW 26.44.050, contending instead\nthat DSHS’s duty to perform health and safety checks was based on a special relationship of\nentrustment. Therefore, we need only address the latter source of duty.\n                                                 8\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\naffirmative duty to render aid.’” Caulfield, 108 Wn. App. at 253 (quoting Hutchins, 116 Wn.2d\n\nat 228). Our Supreme Court held that the duty to protect another person from the intentional or\n\ncriminal actions of third parties arises, “where one party is ‘entrusted with the well being of\n\nanother.’” Niece, 131 Wn.2d at 50 (quoting Lauritzen v. Lauritzen, 74 Wn. App. 432, 440, 874\n\nP. 2d 861 (1994). In finding such a duty, Niece also relied on the vulnerability of the person\n\nharmed. 131 Wn.2d at 50-51. Similarly, this court in Caulfield, 108 Wn. App. at 255, held that\n\nthese special relationships arise where one party is entrusted with the care of another party\n\nrendered vulnerable by the nature of the arrangement.\n\n       In finding that a social worker has no duty to protect third persons from the tortious acts\n\nof children for whom it coordinates services, Division One of our court noted that social workers\n\nare not responsible for day-to-day supervision of such children. Terrell C. v. Dep’t of Soc. &\n\nHealth Servs., 120 Wn. App. 20, 28, 84 P.3d 899 (2004). It explained that “[a]ny ‘ongoing’\n\nrelationship between the social worker and the child is to prevent future harm to that child, not to\n\nprotect members of the community from harm.” Id. (emphasis added). Our Supreme Court later\n\nquoted this language approvingly in Sheikh v. Choe, 156 Wn.2d 441, 450, 128 P.3d 574 (2006).\n\nHowever, no Washington court has yet addressed whether such an ongoing relationship between\n\na social worker and a foster child constitutes a special relationship within the meaning of\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts, section 315, giving rise to a duty to protect that child from the\n\ntortious acts of foster parents. We turn to the Restatement and to Washington case law\n\npertaining to foster children to meet that issue.\n\n       In defining the contours of a protective special relationship, Niece relied on Restatement\n\n(Second) of Torts § 315, among other sources. 131 Wn.2d at 43. Section 315 states:\n\n       There is no duty so to control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him from\n       causing physical harm to another unless\n\n                                                    9\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n               (a) a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which\n        imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person’s conduct, or\n               (b) a special relation exists between the actor and the other which gives to\n        the other a right to protection.\n\n        Comment c to this section explains that “[t]he relations between the actor and the other\n\nwhich require the actor to control the conduct of third persons for the protection of the other are\n\nstated in §§ 314 A and 320.” RESTATEMENT, supra, cmt. c. Section 314 A, in turn, lists a\n\nnumber of specific relations of this type, such as common carrier and passenger, none of which\n\ninvolve social worker and foster child. Section 320 deals with custodial relations. Significantly,\n\ncomment b to Restatement, supra, section 314A specifies that\n\n        [t]he relations listed are not intended to be exclusive, and are not necessarily the\n        only ones in which a duty of affirmative action for the aid or protection of another\n        may be found. . . . The law appears, however, to be working slowly toward a\n        recognition of the duty to aid or protect in any relation of dependence or of mutual\n        dependence.\n\nThus, we must turn back to our case law to determine the extent to which the State had a duty to\n\nprotect these plaintiffs.3\n\n        In M.W. v. Department of Social & Health Services, 149 Wn.2d 589, 70 P.3d 954 (2003),\n\nthe court examined whether RCW 26.44.050 imposes a duty on DSHS to protect children from\n\nharm by DSHS workers while investigating potential abuse. M.W., 149 Wn.2d at 597. After\n\nexamining the statute and the case law interpreting it, the court held that liability under this\n\nstatute arises only for children\n\n        who are harmed because DSHS has gathered incomplete or biased information that\n        results in a harmful placement decision, such as removing a child from a\n\n\n\n3\n  We note that Restatement (Third) of Torts, section 40, replaced section 314 A of the\nRestatement (Second) of Torts. However, no party cites to the Restatement (Third), and none\nargue that the Restatement (Third) changed the principles of Restatement (Second), section 315,\nin a way that affects this appeal.\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n       nonabusive home, placing a child in an abusive home, or letting a child remain in\n       an abusive home.\n\nId. at 602. As noted above, the plaintiffs in this appeal make no claim of liability under RCW\n\n26.44.050. Therefore, the holding in M.W. does not govern the resolution of this appeal.4\n\n       M.W. does contain language which, read in isolation, could suggest that all claims of\n\nnegligence in monitoring the welfare of foster children are limited to this statutory liability. For\n\nexample, after noting that our courts have not recognized a general tort claim for negligent\n\ninvestigation, the court stated, “The negligent investigation cause of action against DSHS is a\n\nnarrow exception that is based on, and limited to, the statutory duty and concerns we discuss\n\nabove.\" Id. at 601. However, the court’s entire analysis in M.W. was restricted to determining\n\nwhether liability lay in M.W.’s case under the statute. It examined the wording of the statute, its\n\npurpose, and case law interpreting it. Its gaze did not reach the larger question presented here:\n\nwhether a special relationship is present from which a tort duty to exercise ordinary care would\n\narise. This narrow focus on statutory liability cannot be the basis for a denial of any liability in\n\ntort, especially when the cornerstone of that liability, the special protective relationship, was not\n\neven discussed. In addition, any duty under the statute is triggered only if a report is received of\n\npossible abuse or neglect. To read M.W. to deny any liability outside the statute, then, is to\n\nrestrict liability to situations where a report has been made. Such a narrowing of liability, and its\n\nconsequent reduction of legal protection of foster children, cannot rest on a doubtful implication\n\nfrom ambiguous language. M.W. does not speak to the issue here before us.\n\n\n\n\n4\n The Supreme Court cited M.W. for its holding in Roberson v. Perez, 156 Wn.2d 33, 123 P.3d\n844 (2005). Roberson, like M.W., is restricted to an interpretation of liability under chapter\n26.44 RCW. Roberson, 156 Wn.2d at 35, 48.\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n       Another central decision in this area is Braam, ex rel. Braam v. State, 150 Wn.2d 689, 81\n\nP.3d 851 (2003). The principal issue in Braam was whether foster children have a constitutional\n\nsubstantive due process right to be free from unreasonable risks of harm and a right to reasonable\n\nsafety. Braam, 150 Wn.2d at 700. In holding that foster children have this right, the court\n\nspecified that “the Constitution does not guarantee due care on the part of state officials; liability\n\nfor negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due\n\nprocess.” Braam, 150 Wn.2d at 699 (quoting County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 849,\n\n118 S. Ct. 1708, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1043 (1998). Thus, Braam’s due process analysis and holding\n\ndoes not bear on the issue presented here.\n\n       The most direct authority on a common law duty of care is Caulfield and Niece, both\n\nsupra. In Caulfield, we examined whether a special relationship arose when a county contracted\n\nwith a third party to provide in-home caregiving services to a physically disabled adult as part of\n\na program designed to support disabled people living outside of group nursing facilities. 108\n\nWn. App. at 255-56. We held that this was a special relationship and that it gave rise to a duty\n\non the part of the county “to protect . . . [such] vulnerable clients from the tortious acts of others,\n\nespecially when a case manager knows or should know that serious neglect is occurring.” Id. at\n\n256. We reasoned that because county case workers were responsible under the program for\n\nplanning and monitoring care, and for terminating the contracted caregiver if care was\n\ninadequate, they must use ordinary care to protect their clients from dangers imposed by the\n\ncaregiver’s tortious conduct. Id.\n\n       The State argues that a special relationship giving rise to tort liability must be custodial in\n\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\nnature. However, it is clear from Caulfield that custody is not a crucial element of such a\n\nrelationship. There, the contracted caregiver, not the county case worker, had a custodial\n\nrelationship to the disabled client. 108 Wn. App. at 245-46. The case worker’s relationship with\n\nthe client extended only to planning, monitoring, and providing other support services. Id. at\n\n256. The fact that the case worker was entrusted with ensuring the client’s wellbeing proved\n\ncrucial in our assessment of the relationship. Id. at 255. Caulfield stands for the proposition that\n\nentrustment, not custody, is at the heart of a special protective relationship for purposes of\n\nimposing a common law tort duty. Niece, on the other hand, did involve a custodial relationship\n\nbetween the group home operator and the resident. As noted, however, Niece did not base its\n\nfinding of a special relationship on custody, but rather on the same ground as Caulfield,\n\nentrustment of a vulnerable individual. Niece, 131 Wn.2d at 50; Caulfield, 108 Wn. App. at 255.\n\nThus, the decisions of both the Supreme Court and this court signal that custody is not a\n\nprerequisite to a protective special relationship.5\n\n       The relationship between DSHS and children it places in foster homes is quite similar to\n\nthe one analyzed in Caulfield. Just as the county contracted with an in-home caregiver in\n\nCaulfield, DSHS contracts with licensed foster parents to take in the children. See DeWater v.\n\nState, 130 Wn.2d 128, 136, 921 P.2d 1059 (1996). Like the county case workers, DSHS social\n\nworkers are responsible for monitoring the health and safety of the children. See former RCW\n\n74.13.031 (1998). Like the county’s disabled adult clients, the children are especially vulnerable\n\nto harms created by their caregivers. Aponte v. Dep’t of Soc. & Health Servs., 92 Wn. App. 604,\n\n\n\n5\n  Alternatively, if some degree of custody were required, it is present. In Braam’s discussion of\na foster child’s substantive due process right to be free from unreasonable risks of harm and a\nright to reasonable safety, the Supreme Court characterized the State as “custodian and caretaker\nof foster children.” 150 Wn.2d at 700. This custodial relation is not somehow effaced when the\ninquiry shifts from substantive due process to a special relationship.\n                                                  13\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n622, 965 P.2d 626 (1998). The facts and policies at work in this appeal parallel those in\n\nCaulfield. As in Caulfield, they lead to the presence of a special relationship.\n\n          Perhaps more to the point, Niece found a special relationship “where one party is\n\n‘entrusted with the well being of another,’” and the entrusted party is vulnerable to a degree. 131\n\nWn.2d at 50 (quoting Lauritzen, 74 Wn. App. at 440). As noted, Niece did not rely on custody in\n\nfinding this relationship. Absent proper monitoring by the State, a foster child is wholly exposed\n\nto the will of the foster parents, whether that will is a blessing or a horror. In this setting, the\n\nState is the last watchman of the foster child’s well being. A more compelling illustration of the\n\nbases of a special relationship established in Niece is hard to imagine.\n\n          For these reasons, we hold that DSHS owed the children a duty like that recognized in\n\nCaulfield to take ordinary care to protect them from the tortious or criminal conduct of their\n\nfoster parents. The trial court erred to the extent it ruled that no such duty exists.\n\n3.        Breach of Duty\n\n          DSHS policies require case workers to conduct health and safety checks for foster\n\nchildren. Evidence presented at trial showed that such visits were supposed to occur every 90\n\ndays during the first year children are in a new foster home. The evidence, however, indicated\n\nthat Woolridge did not conduct such health and safety checks for SAH during the pre-adoption\n\nperiod.\n\n          DSHS’s failure to conduct required health and safety checks—either at all or with\n\nsufficient regularity—constituted sufficient evidence of a breach of its duty of care to avoid\n\ndismissal under CR 50. Accordingly, the trial court erred to the extent it ruled that there was an\n\n\n\n\n                                                   14\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\ninsufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find that DSHS breached its duty to protect\n\nthe children.6\n\n4.     Causation\n\n       The State argues that even if DSHS had a duty to perform health and safety checks, the\n\nchildren did not produce evidence from which the jury could find that a breach of that duty\n\ncaused their injuries. We disagree.\n\n       To prove negligence, a plaintiff must establish that the negligent party’s action or failure\n\nto act was the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s harm. Wuthrich v. King County, 185 Wn.2d 19,\n\n25, 366 P.3d 926 (2016). Proximate cause consists of two elements: cause in fact and legal\n\ncausation. Tyner v. Dep’t of Soc. & Health Servs., 141 Wn.2d 68, 82, 1 P.3d 1148 (2000).\n\nCause in fact requires a determination that if the defendant did not breach the duty of care, the\n\nplaintiff’s injuries would not have occurred. See id. Legal causation describes the policy-based\n\ndetermination that the defendant’s breach of the duty of care was of sufficient causal proximity\n\nto support imposition of liability for the resulting injuries. See id.\n\n       To establish cause in fact, a negligence plaintiff must prove that but for the defendant’s\n\nbreach of duty, the plaintiff would not have been injured. Id. This is a factual question, but may\n\nbe resolved as a matter of law where a reasonable jury could reach only one conclusion based on\n\nthe evidence presented. Hungerford v. Dep’t of Corr., 135 Wn. App. 240, 251, 139 P.3d 1131\n\n(2006). Mere speculation or argumentative assertions of possible counterfactual events is\n\ninsufficient to prove that but for the defendant’s breach of duty the plaintiff would not have been\n\ninjured. Id. at 252, 254.\n\n\n\n\n6\n We do not suggest that compliance with DSHS policies is necessarily enough to ensure\ncompliance with the duty to exercise ordinary care to protect foster children.\n                                                  15\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n       The children claim that if DSHS had properly conducted health and safety checks, they\n\nwould have given the social worker some indication of abuse. SAH testified at trial that\n\n       if I felt safe and knew—and the woman was always there, if I felt safe, I believe I would\n       have said something. I was a very outspoken young girl.\n\nRP (Feb. 11, 2015) at 32 (emphasis added). The record also shows that SAH wanted someone to\n\ngive her the opportunity to tell what was happening to her and that she asked to talk privately\n\nwith a therapist. The jury reasonably could have found based on this evidence that had the social\n\nworker properly performed health and safety checks, SAH or the other girls would likely have\n\nfelt safe enough with the social worker to disclose the abuse or that the checks would have\n\notherwise uncovered or given DSHS reason to suspect abuse during the pre-adoption period.\n\n       In addition, records of SAH’s and HBH’s visits with a therapist showed that the girls\n\nwere “sexually acting out together and using language which you wouldn’t expect a child to\n\nuse.” RP (Feb. 9, 2015) at 48. The children’s standard of care expert testified if Woolridge had\n\nbeen aware of this behavior, it would have been reason to increase the health and safety checks\n\nby DSHS. The jury could reasonably have found based on this evidence that the social worker\n\nwould likely have encountered similar behaviors had she properly performed health and safety\n\nchecks and that such encounters would have triggered an investigation. Notably, the jury would\n\nhave considered all of this evidence in light of the testimony of the children’s standard of care\n\nexpert that proper health and safety checks in general help built rapport, encourage honest\n\ncommunication, and provide an avenue for disclosure of abuse and for observation of various\n\nindicators of abuse.\n\n       This evidence supplies a sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find that but for the\n\nallegedly deficient health and safety checks, SAH or one of the other girls would have disclosed\n\nthe abuse and the State would have intervened. It also provides a sufficient basis for a finding of\n\n                                                 16\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\nlegal causation. With this, there was a sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find\n\nthat DSHS’s breach of its duty to protect the children was a proximate cause of their injuries.\n\nTherefore, the trial court erred in entering judgment as a matter of law under CR 50 on the\n\nchildren’s claims regarding the pre-adoption period.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n       We hold that DSHS has a duty to exercise ordinary care to protect foster children on the\n\nbasis of its special relationship with such children. We hold also that the evidence, viewed in the\n\nlight most favorable to KMH, HBH, SAH, KEH, and JBH, supplied a legally sufficient\n\nevidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find by a preponderance that DSHS breached that duty\n\nduring the pre-adoption period and proximately caused at least some of the children’s damages.\n\nConsequently, we reverse the trial court’s CR 50 ruling and remand for trial on the claims of\n\nnegligent investigation and failure to take appropriate protective action during the period before\n\nadoption.\n\n       A majority of the panel having determined that only the foregoing portion of this opinion will\n\nbe printed in the Washington Appellate Reports and that the remainder shall be filed for public record\n\nin accordance with RCW 2.06.040, it is so ordered.\n\n                                    II. SPECIAL VERDICT FORM\n\n       The children argue that the trial court erred by providing a special verdict form that asked\n\nthe jury to segregate damages in an improper way. We agree, but hold that the error was\n\nharmless.\n\n       We review errors of law in jury instructions de novo. Hue v. Farmboy Spray Co., 127\n\nWn.2d 67, 92, 896 P.2d 682 (1995). A trial court’s instructions to the jury are legally sufficient\n\nif they properly inform the jury of the applicable law, are not misleading, and permit each party\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\nto argue its theory of the case as to any matters the jury will decide. Boyd v. Dep’t of Soc. &\n\nHealth Servs., 187 Wn. App. 1, 11, 349 P.3d 864 (2015). However, even where the trial court\n\nerred in instructing the jury, we reverse only if the error prejudiced a party below. Hue, 127\n\nWn.2d at 92.\n\n        Jury instruction 19 required the jury to determine what percentage of total negligence was\n\nattributable to the negligence of DSHS and what percentage was attributable to the negligence of\n\nthe Hamricks, and stated that the total must equal 100 percent. Further, in calculating any\n\ndamage award, the jury was instructed to segregate any damages caused by such negligence from\n\ndamages caused solely by the Hamricks’ intentional acts. Instruction 21 stated:\n\n                In calculating any damage award, you must not include any damages that\n        were caused by the intentional acts of Drew Anne Hamrick and/or Scott Hamrick\n        and not proximately caused by negligence of State of Washington/DSHS, nonparty\n        Trey Hamrick, and/or nonparty Kelly Hamrick. Any damages caused solely by the\n        intentional acts of Drew Ann Hamrick and/or Scott Hamrick and not proximately\n        caused by negligence of State of Washington/DSHS, Trey Hamrick and/or Kelly\n        Hamrick must be segregated from and not made part of any damage award against\n        State of Washington/DSHS.\n\nCP at 632. The children agree that instructions 19 and 21 correctly state the law.\n\n        Questions 1 through 5 of the trial court’s verdict form involved whether DSHS was\n\nnegligent and question 6 involved whether the Hamricks were negligent. Question 7 then asked\n\nthe jury to find the amount of each child’s damages. Based on instruction 21, the jury was not\n\nallowed to include in this amount any damages caused solely by the Hamricks’ intentional acts.\n\nConsistent with instruction 19, question 8 required the jury to determine what percentage of total\n\nnegligence was attributable to the negligence of DSHS and what percentage was attributable to\n\nthe negligence of the Hamricks, and stated that the total must equal 100 percent. Again, the\n\nPlaintiffs do not object to this series of instructions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   18\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n       Next, question 9 asked the jury to determine whether the Hamricks’ intentional acts were\n\na proximate cause of any of the children’s damages. Question 10 then asked the jury:\n\n       What percentage of each plaintiff[s’] damages were caused by . . . all of the\n       intentional conduct of [Scott and Drew Ann Hamrick], . . . and what percentage of\n       plaintiff[s’] damages were caused by all of the negligent conduct you identified in\n       your answers to Question No. 7? Your answer for each plaintiff must total 100%.\n\nCP at 639. Question 10 also asked the jury to allocate percentages to either “[d]amages from\n\nintentional conduct” or “[d]amages from negligent conduct,” with the total equaling 100 percent.\n\nCP at 640.\n\n       The children argue that including question 10 in the verdict form misled the jury as to the\n\nsegregation of damages by indicating that it could allocate some of the negligence damages\n\nalready segregated under instruction 21 to the Hamricks’ intentional torts. We agree.\n\n       We read jury instructions as a whole when determining sufficiency. Rollins v. King\n\nCounty Metro Transit, 148 Wn. App. 370, 379-80, 199 P.3d 499 (2009). We believe that here\n\nthe instructions read as a whole were misleading. Instruction 21 correctly required the jury to\n\nsegregate the damages caused by DSHS’s negligence from the damages “caused solely by the\n\n[Hamricks’] intentional acts.” CP at 632 (emphasis added). This instruction directed the jury\n\nresponse to question 7 of the verdict form, requiring the jury to exclude damages caused solely\n\nby the Hamricks’ intentional acts in determining the amount of the children’s damages. But\n\nquestion 10 then allowed for a second segregation of those negligence-related damages between\n\ndamages “caused by all of the negligent conduct” and those “caused by . . . all of the [Hamricks’]\n\nintentional conduct.” CP at 638-40.\n\n       The State argues that question 10 simply presented a step-by-step method of\n\nimplementing instruction 21. Read in the context of instruction 21, however, question 10 created\n\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\na significant risk that the jury would segregate damages twice. We hold that the jury instructions\n\nand verdict form questions as a whole were misleading as to the segregation of damages.7\n\n       However, KMH, HBH, SAH, KEH, and JBH have shown no resulting prejudice. An\n\nerroneous jury instruction is prejudicial if it affects the outcome of the trial. RWR Mgmt., Inc. v.\n\nCitizens Realty Co., 133 Wn. App. 265, 278, 135 P.3d 955 (2006). We will not presume\n\nprejudice if an instruction was misleading but did not misstate the law. Paetsch v. Spokane\n\nDermatology Clinic, P.S., 182 Wn.2d 842, 849, 348 P.3d 389 (2015). Here, because the jury\n\nfound that DSHS was not negligent, it assigned no damages at all. It could not have been misled\n\nby the damage assignment portion of the special verdict form because it did not reach that\n\nportion of the form. Any error in that unused portion of the form had no effect on the outcome\n\nof the case.\n\n       Accordingly, we hold that the trial court committed no reversible error regarding the\n\nclaims that went to the jury in issuing the special verdict form. However, on remand the trial\n\ncourt’s verdict form should be consistent with our analysis above.\n\n                             III. EXCLUSION OF WITNESS TESTIMONY\n\n       The children argue that the trial court erred by excluding the testimony of two late-\n\ndisclosed witnesses without performing the analysis required by Jones v. City of Seattle, 179\n\nWn.2d 322, 314 P.3d 380 (2013). We agree that the trial court erred but hold that the error was\n\nharmless.\n\n\n\n\n7\n Question 9 also is inconsistent with instruction 21. Instruction 21 requires segregation of\ndamages caused solely by the Hamricks’ intentional conduct and damages caused by DSHS’s\nnegligence. Question 9 asked the jury to determine whether the Hamricks’ intentional acts were\na proximate cause of any of the children’s damages. Under instruction 21, the jury should have\nbeen asked whether the Hamricks’ intentional acts were the sole proximate cause of any of the\nchildren’s damages\n                                                 20\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n       We review a trial court’s decision to exclude witness testimony for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Id. at 337. A trial court abuses its discretion if its decision is manifestly unreasonable\n\nor based on untenable grounds or reasons. Peralta v. State, 191 Wn. App. 931, 951, 366 P.3d 45\n\n(2015), review granted in part, 185 Wn.2d 1027 (2016). The erroneous exclusion of witnesses\n\nwithout performing the analysis required by Jones and Burnet v. Spokane Ambulance, 131\n\nWn.2d 484, 933 P.2d 1036 (1997), has been held to be subject to harmless error analysis. Jones,\n\n179 Wn.2d at 338. An error is harmless, and therefore not grounds for reversal, if it does not\n\naffect the outcome of the case. Blaney v. International Association of Machinists and\n\nAerospace Workers, Dist. No. 160, 151 Wn.2d 203, 211, 87 P.3d 757 (2004).\n\n       Under Jones, a trial court may not exclude late-disclosed witnesses as a sanction without\n\nfirst “explicitly consider[ing] whether a lesser sanction would probably suffice, whether the\n\nviolation at issue was willful or deliberate, and whether the violation substantially prejudiced the\n\nopponent’s ability to prepare for trial.” Id. at 338; see also Burnet, 131 Wn.2d at 484. The trial\n\ncourt need not invoke Jones or Burnet specifically, but the record must show that the trial court\n\nevaluated the necessary elements before excluding the testimony. Jones, 179 Wn.2d at 344.\n\n       Here, the trial court did not conduct the evaluation required by Jones and Burnet. In\n\nruling to exclude the testimony, the court reasoned as follows:\n\n       [I]f you were intending on calling them as witnesses, they could have been\n       disclosed at least a month ago; so I'm not going to allow them to testify at this time.\n       I don't think that their testimony is going to add materially to anything. We already\n       know the subject of the 2009 referral, and I would assume at some point we're going\n       to have a caseworker that's going to be testifying about that referral and why they\n       did or did not do anything. All right? So I don't think we need either [of the\n       witnesses] to add anything to that; so at this point, I'm not going to allow [them],\n       as lay witnesses, to testify.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\nRP (Feb. 5, 2015) at 26. This ruling did not address whether a lesser sanction would suffice,\n\nwhether the late disclosure was willful or deliberate, or whether the late disclosure prejudiced the\n\nState in its trial preparation. Therefore, the trial court erred under Jones.\n\n       However, the children have made no showing—in fact, they do not even argue—that the\n\nexclusion prejudiced them. The record shows that the witnesses would have testified to matters\n\nrelated to a 2009 referral to CPS. The evidence presented at trial showed that that particular\n\nreferral did not result in any mandate for DSHS to investigate. Consequently, the trial court\n\ndismissed all claims based on DSHS’s inaction in light of that referral, and the children have not\n\nappealed that dismissal. Given the dismissal and the absence of a showing of prejudice from\n\nexcluding the witnesses, we hold that the trial court’s failure to follow Jones did not prejudice\n\nKMH, HBH, SAH, KEH, or JBH and constituted harmless error.\n\n                   IV. COMMENTS REGARDING PERSONAL POLITICAL LEANINGS\n\n       The children argue that the trial court violated their rights to a trial presided over by a fair\n\nand impartial judge when it discussed matters of personal political preference. We disagree.\n\n       The children base their argument on the appearance of fairness doctrine. Under that\n\ndoctrine, they must show actual or perceived bias to establish a violation of their right to a fair\n\ntrial. GMAC v. Everett Chevrolet, Inc., 179 Wn. App. 126, 154, 317 P.3d 1074, review denied,\n\n181 Wn.2d 1008 (2014). The critical question is whether the proceedings would have appeared\n\nunfair to a reasonably prudent and disinterested person. Id. We review appearance of fairness\n\nclaims de novo. In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against King, 168 Wn.2d 888, 899, 232 P.3d\n\n1095 (2010).\n\n       According to SAH’s declaration in support of the children’s motion for a new trial, the\n\npresiding judge discussed the lifelong trajectory of her political views and described political\n\n\n\n                                                  22\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\ndisagreements with another judge. Yet the record shows no nexus between these comments and\n\nthe parties or the issues to be decided in the case. It is unclear how commentary regarding\n\npolitical matters would have produced any actual or potential bias in a negligence case related to\n\nthe abuse of foster children. No reasonably prudent, disinterested person would infer from these\n\ncomments by the trial court that it was biased as to the issues before it.\n\n       The children also argued in the superior court that “it is clear that members of the jury\n\nlikely over[]heard the Court’s comments and was [sic] likely influenced by it in some unknown,\n\nbut prejudicial, way.” CP at 676. They speculated that jurors may have decided the case\n\naccording to their own political biases rather than the evidence presented in the case and the\n\ninstructions of the court as to the applicable law. However, the jury was properly instructed to\n\nfind the facts of the case based only on the evidence presented, and we presume that the jurors\n\nfollowed those instructions. Peralta, 191 Wn. App. at 950.\n\n       Speculation as to jurors’ motivations does not rebut this presumption and is no substitute\n\nfor a showing of actual or potential bias. The children have not shown that the trial court’s\n\ncomments produced any actual or perceived bias on the part of any jurors.\n\n                                      V. CUMULATIVE ERROR\n\n       The children also argue that the cumulative effects of the preceding claimed errors in\n\naggregate violated their right to a fair trial. We disagree.\n\n       The children cite no authority for applying the cumulative error doctrine in a civil case.\n\nIn criminal cases our courts have held that cumulative error may warrant reversal even where the\n\ntrial court’s individual errors were harmless. In re Pers. Restraint of Cross, 180 Wn.2d 664, 690,\n\n327 P.3d 660 (2014). This is the case “when there have been several trial errors that standing\n\nalone may not be sufficient to justify reversal but when combined may deny a defendant a fair\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\ntrial.” State v. Greiff, 141 Wn.2d 910, 929, 10 P.3d 390 (2000). “The test to determine whether\n\ncumulative errors require reversal of a defendant’s conviction is whether the totality of\n\ncircumstances substantially prejudiced the defendant and denied him a fair trial.” Cross, 180\n\nWn.2d at 690.\n\n        Assuming that the doctrine applies in civil cases, the children have not shown cumulative\n\nerror warranting reversal. The trial court erred in instructing the jury as to the segregation of\n\ndamages and in excluding two witnesses as a sanction for the children’s late disclosure of those\n\nwitnesses. However, there is no clear cumulative impact from those errors. The children argue\n\nthat “key rulings were decided on the fly without any serious consideration as to the controlling\n\nlaw and/or admitted evidence.” Br. of Appellant at 33-34. This addresses a commonality of\n\ncausation—and a highly abstracted one—but does not speak to the cumulative effects of those\n\nerrors. 8\n\n        The children have not shown that cumulative error denied them a fair trial.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n        We hold that DSHS has a duty to exercise ordinary care to protect foster children on the\n\nbasis of its special relationship with such children. We hold also that the evidence, viewed in the\n\nlight most favorable to the children, supplied a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a\n\nreasonable jury to find by a preponderance that DSHS breached that duty during the pre-adoption\n\nperiod and proximately caused at least some of the children’s damages. Consequently, we\n\n\n\n8\n  The children seem to argue that they suffered generalized prejudice because the trial court’s CR\n50 rulings forced them to give a closing argument that did not mirror their opening statement,\nharming their attorneys’ credibility in the eyes of the jury. However, a change in legal argument\nis an ineluctable result of granting a CR 50 motion on some but not all claims. In addition, the\njury was properly instructed to base its verdict only on the evidence presented and the\ninstructions of the court. We presume that the jurors followed those instructions, Peralta, 191\nWn. App. at 950, and nothing in the record or briefing shows that they did not.\n                                                 24\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\nreverse the trial court’s CR 50 ruling and remand for trial on the claims of negligent investigation\n\nand failure to take appropriate protective action during the period before adoption. However, we\n\ndisagree with the children’s other arguments and affirm the trial court’s judgment as to the 2008\n\nand 2010 CPS referrals.\n\n\n\n                                                     BJORGEN, C.J.\n We concur:\n\n\n\nJOHANSON, J.\n\n\n\n\nMAXA, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                                25\n\f",

Their claims were related to incidents of\n\n\n\n1\n    We use initials to protect the privacy of those who were children at the time of the events.\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\nchild abuse by their foster, and later adoptive, parents, Scott and Drew Anne Hamrick (the\n\nHamricks).\n\n        The children contend that the trial court erred by (1) dismissing under CR 50 their claims\n\nregarding DSHS’s failure to investigate during the period before they were adopted, (2) adopting\n\na special verdict form that improperly asked the jury to apportion fault for both intentional torts\n\nand negligence, (3) excluding the testimony of two late-disclosed witnesses, and (4) speaking\n\ncandidly about personal political leanings in court. They also assert that (5) cumulative error\n\nviolated their rights to a fair trial.\n\n        In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that (1) DSHS has a duty of reasonable\n\ncare to protect children it places in foster homes based on a special relationship and that the\n\nplaintiffs produced sufficient evidence to avoid dismissal under CR 50 for claims regarding\n\nDSHS’s negligence during the period before the children were adopted. In the unpublished\n\nportion we hold that (2) the trial court erred by submitting an incorrect special verdict form to the\n\njury, but the error was harmless for those claims; (3) the trial court erred in excluding the two\n\nwitnesses, but this error also was harmless; (4) the trial court did not create any appearance of\n\nunfairness by speaking about political matters; and (5) there was no cumulative error.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the trial court’s CR 50 ruling and remand for trial on the claim of\n\nnegligent failure to investigate and to appropriately protect foster children. We affirm the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment as to the remaining claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n                                             FACTS\n\n1.      Pre-Adoption Period\n\n        In February 1998, DSHS placed KMH in foster care with the Hamricks. Social worker\n\nAmy Page was assigned to KMH’s case and conducted health and safety checks. Page did not\n\nreceive any information or make any observations suggesting that the Hamricks were abusing\n\nKMH or that the placement was otherwise harmful.\n\n        In October 1999, twins HBH and SAH were placed with the Hamricks as well. The twins\n\nhad been in other foster homes for the preceding seven years, and had suffered abuse and neglect\n\nin those homes. DSHS social worker Mary Woolridge was assigned to the twins’ cases.\n\nAccording to agency policies, Woolridge was supposed to conduct in-home health and safety\n\nchecks every 90 days at which she was to talk with the girls about their experiences in the home.\n\nHowever, evidence presented at trial indicated that Woolridge may not have conducted these\n\nvisits as required.\n\n        During this period, the Hamricks allegedly abused KMH, HBH, and SAH emotionally\n\nand physically, and abused SAH sexually. However, DSHS received no reports of any abuse,\n\nand individuals in contact with the children reported that they seemed happy.\n\n        In January 2000, DSHS placed KEH and JBH in the Hamricks’ home. Social worker\n\nLisa Gilman was assigned to their cases and conducted health and safety visits. Gilman did not\n\nreceive any indication that abuse was occurring in the Hamrick home. Page later took over as\n\ntheir assigned social worker, and similarly believed KEH and JBH were happy and doing well in\n\nthe home.\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n        In June 2000, DSHS conducted a home study to determine whether the Hamricks would\n\nbe suitable adoptive parents. The resulting report recommended that DSHS allow them to adopt\n\nall of the children.\n\n2.      Post-Adoption Period\n\n        In October 2000, the Hamricks adopted KMH, HBH, and SAH. In January 2003, they\n\nadopted KEH and JBH as well.\n\n        In April 2008, a school counselor reported suspected physical abuse of SAH. Child\n\nProtective Services (CPS) screened this report and decided not to investigate. In November\n\n2009, CPS received a referral related to Scott Hamrick’s alleged sexual contact with a juvenile\n\nneighbor girl. CPS apparently referred this incident to local law enforcement for criminal\n\ninvestigation but did not investigate the Hamrick household for abuse.\n\n        In March 2010, a neighbor reported possible abuse and neglect of KEH to CPS. CPS\n\ninvestigated this report, visiting the Hamrick household and interviewing the children and the\n\nHamricks. Ultimately, CPS determined that the report was unfounded.\n\n        In 2011, the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department began an investigation of allegations\n\nthat the Hamricks had abused KMH, HBH, SAH, KEH, and JBH. This investigation led DSHS\n\nto remove the children from the Hamrick home. Scott Hamrick committed suicide during the\n\ninvestigation, and Drew Ann Hamrick was charged with crimes related to the abuse.\n\n3.      Claims and Trial\n\n        In October 2011, HBH and SAH sued DSHS, claiming that its negligence in failing to\n\ninvestigate or take other protective action allowed the Hamricks to abuse them during their\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\nperiod as foster, and later adoptive, children in the Hamrick home. A guardian ad litem sued\n\nDSHS on similar grounds on behalf of KMH, KEH, and JBH, who were still juveniles at the\n\ntime, and the two cases were consolidated. Following an initial mistrial, the case was tried\n\nbeginning in February 2015.\n\n       Several days before trial began, the children disclosed two additional witnesses who\n\nwould testify concerning matters related to the 2009 CPS referral. The State objected to their\n\ntestimony. The trial court excluded the witnesses as a sanction for the children’s late disclosure,\n\nbelieving that the testimony would not add anything significant to the case.\n\n4.     CR 50 Motion\n\n       Following the close of both parties’ cases, the State moved under CR 50 for judgment as\n\na matter of law that, inter alia, DSHS was not negligent during the pre-adoption period or in\n\nrelation to the 2009 CPS referral. The trial court agreed with the State and granted the motion.\n\nAs to the pre-adoption period, it ruled:\n\n       there were so many people involved that were handling this prior to the adoption,\n       all of these other voices that were coming in saying, no, there was nothing to show\n       there was any abuse. I mean, absent — I mean, does it really matter whether Mary\n       Woolridge was or was not doing her health and safety visits[?]. . . . Seems to me\n       most of this case comes down to what did they know and when did they know it. .\n       . . I can’t really see there are any claims based on anything Mary Woolridge did or\n       did not do.\n\nReport of Proceedings (RP) (Mar. 5, 2015) at 83. As to the 2009 CPS referral, the court ruled\n\nthat “the fact they didn’t investigate it is not evidence of any kind of negligence on their part\n\nbecause they didn’t have any duty or obligation to investigate it.” RP (Mar. 5, 2015) at 82.\n\n5.     Special Verdict Form\n\n       The trial court provided the jury a special verdict form on which it was to document its\n\nverdicts as to negligence and the assignment of any resulting damages. The verdict form first\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\nasked the jury to decide whether DSHS was negligent in its treatment of the 2008 and 2010\n\nreferrals and whether its negligence proximately caused harm to the children. It then asked\n\nwhether certain other nonparties’ negligence proximately caused harm to KMH, HBH, SAH,\n\nKEH, and JBH. In accordance with the trial court’s CR 50 rulings, the verdict form included no\n\nquestions concerning the pre-adoption period or the 2009 referral.\n\n       The verdict form included several questions regarding damages. It asked the jury to\n\ndetermine “each plaintiff’s total amount of damages” as a dollar value. Clerk’s Papers (CP) at\n\n638. Next, it stated:\n\n       Assume that 100% represents the total combined negligence or fault that\n       proximately caused each plaintiff's damages. What percentage of this 100% is\n       attributable to each individual or entity, if any, for whom you answered “yes” in\n       answer to [the questions concerning DSHS’s and certain nonparties’ negligence]?\n       For each plaintiff, the percentage of fault must equal 100 %.\n\nCP at 638.\n\n       The verdict form next asked, “Were the intentional acts of the following individuals a\n\nproximate cause of any of the plaintiff[s’] damages?” CP at 638. Finally, the form asked:\n\n       What percentage of each plaintiff's damages were caused by . . . all of the\n       intentional conduct of [Scott and Drew Ann Hamrick], and what percentage of\n       plaintiff[s’] damages were caused by all of the negligent conduct you identified in\n       your answers to [the questions concerning negligence]? Your answer for each\n       plaintiff must total 100 %.\n\nCP at 639.\n\n6.     Outcome of Trial\n\n       The jury found that DSHS was not negligent in its treatment of either the 2008 or 2010\n\nCPS referrals. As a result, it did not calculate or assign any damages to the children on the\n\nspecial verdict form.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n       The plaintiffs moved for a new trial, arguing that the trial court had erred in its CR 50\n\nruling, its exclusion of the two witnesses’ testimony, and in providing the special verdict form.\n\nThe trial court denied the motion. The children now appeal.\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n                   I. CR 50 MOTION REGARDING PRE-ADOPTION NEGLIGENCE\n\n       The children argue that the trial court erred by dismissing their claims of negligence by\n\nDSHS during the pre-adoption period. Underlying this request is the contention that DSHS owes\n\na common law duty of reasonable care to protect children it places in foster homes. We agree.\n\nWe further hold that the children here established genuine issues of fact as to both breach and\n\ncausation and, therefore, that the trial court erred in granting the CR 50 motion and in declining\n\nto instruct the jury as to DSHS’s negligence during the pre-adoption period.\n\n1.

We turn to the Restatement and to Washington case law\n\npertaining to foster children to meet that issue.\n\n       In defining the contours of a protective special relationship, Niece relied on Restatement\n\n(Second) of Torts § 315, among other sources. 131 Wn.2d at 43. Section 315 states:\n\n       There is no duty so to control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him from\n       causing physical harm to another unless\n\n                                                    9\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n               (a) a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which\n        imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person’s conduct, or\n               (b) a special relation exists between the actor and the other which gives to\n        the other a right to protection.\n\n        Comment c to this section explains that “[t]he relations between the actor and the other\n\nwhich require the actor to control the conduct of third persons for the protection of the other are\n\nstated in §§ 314 A and 320.” RESTATEMENT, supra, cmt. c. Section 314 A, in turn, lists a\n\nnumber of specific relations of this type, such as common carrier and passenger, none of which\n\ninvolve social worker and foster child. Section 320 deals with custodial relations. Significantly,\n\ncomment b to Restatement, supra, section 314A specifies that\n\n        [t]he relations listed are not intended to be exclusive, and are not necessarily the\n        only ones in which a duty of affirmative action for the aid or protection of another\n        may be found. . . . The law appears, however, to be working slowly toward a\n        recognition of the duty to aid or protect in any relation of dependence or of mutual\n        dependence.\n\nThus, we must turn back to our case law to determine the extent to which the State had a duty to\n\nprotect these plaintiffs.3\n\n        In M.W. v. Department of Social & Health Services, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639395\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639395/mw-v-dshs/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003),\n\nthe court examined whether RCW 26.44.050 imposes a duty on DSHS to protect children from\n\nharm by DSHS workers while investigating potential abuse. M.W., 149 Wn.2d at 597. After\n\nexamining the statute and the case law interpreting it, the court held that liability under this\n\nstatute arises only for children\n\n        who are harmed because DSHS has gathered incomplete or biased information that\n        results in a harmful placement decision, such as removing a child from a\n\n\n\n3\n  We note that Restatement (Third) of Torts, section 40, replaced section 314 A of the\nRestatement (Second) of Torts. However, no party cites to the Restatement (Third), and none\nargue that the Restatement (Third) changed the principles of Restatement (Second), section 315,\nin a way that affects this appeal.\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n       nonabusive home, placing a child in an abusive home, or letting a child remain in\n       an abusive home.\n\nId. at 602. As noted above, the plaintiffs in this appeal make no claim of liability under RCW\n\n26.44.050. Therefore, the holding in M.W. does not govern the resolution of this appeal.4\n\n       M.W. does contain language which, read in isolation, could suggest that all claims of\n\nnegligence in monitoring the welfare of foster children are limited to this statutory liability. For\n\nexample, after noting that our courts have not recognized a general tort claim for negligent\n\ninvestigation, the court stated, “The negligent investigation cause of action against DSHS is a\n\nnarrow exception that is based on, and limited to, the statutory duty and concerns we discuss\n\nabove.\" Id. at 601. However, the court’s entire analysis in M.W. was restricted to determining\n\nwhether liability lay in M.W.’s case under the statute. It examined the wording of the statute, its\n\npurpose, and case law interpreting it. Its gaze did not reach the larger question presented here:\n\nwhether a special relationship is present from which a tort duty to exercise ordinary care would\n\narise. This narrow focus on statutory liability cannot be the basis for a denial of any liability in\n\ntort, especially when the cornerstone of that liability, the special protective relationship, was not\n\neven discussed. In addition, any duty under the statute is triggered only if a report is received of\n\npossible abuse or neglect. To read M.W. to deny any liability outside the statute, then, is to\n\nrestrict liability to situations where a report has been made. Such a narrowing of liability, and its\n\nconsequent reduction of legal protection of foster children, cannot rest on a doubtful implication\n\nfrom ambiguous language. M.W. does not speak to the issue here before us.\n\n\n\n\n4\n The Supreme Court cited M.W. for its holding in Roberson v. Perez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2634818\"><a href=\"/opinion/2634818/roberson-v-perez/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005). Roberson, like M.W., is restricted to an interpretation of liability under chapter\n26.44 RCW. Roberson, 156 Wn.2d at 35, 48.\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n       Another central decision in this area is Braam, ex rel. Braam v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2623383\"><a href=\"/opinion/2623383/braam-ex-rel-braam-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">851</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003). The principal issue in Braam was whether foster children have a constitutional\n\nsubstantive due process right to be free from unreasonable risks of harm and a right to reasonable\n\nsafety. Braam, 150 Wn.2d at 700. In holding that foster children have this right, the court\n\nspecified that “the Constitution does not guarantee due care on the part of state officials; liability\n\nfor negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due\n\nprocess.” Braam, 150 Wn.2d at 699 (quoting County of Sacramento v. Lewis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118214\"><a href=\"/opinion/118214/countyof-sacramento-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 849,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118214\"><a href=\"/opinion/118214/countyof-sacramento-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1043</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998). Thus, Braam’s due process analysis and holding\n\ndoes not bear on the issue presented here.\n\n       The most direct authority on a common law duty of care is Caulfield and Niece, both\n\nsupra. In Caulfield, we examined whether a special relationship arose when a county contracted\n\nwith a third party to provide in-home caregiving services to a physically disabled adult as part of\n\na program designed to support disabled people living outside of group nursing facilities. 108\n\nWn. App. at 255-56. We held that this was a special relationship and that it gave rise to a duty\n\non the part of the county “to protect . . . [such] vulnerable clients from the tortious acts of others,\n\nespecially when a case manager knows or should know that serious neglect is occurring.” Id. at\n\n256. We reasoned that because county case workers were responsible under the program for\n\nplanning and monitoring care, and for terminating the contracted caregiver if care was\n\ninadequate, they must use ordinary care to protect their clients from dangers imposed by the\n\ncaregiver’s tortious conduct. Id.\n\n       The State argues that a special relationship giving rise to tort liability must be custodial in\n\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\nnature. However, it is clear from Caulfield that custody is not a crucial element of such a\n\nrelationship. There, the contracted caregiver, not the county case worker, had a custodial\n\nrelationship to the disabled client. 108 Wn. App. at 245-46. The case worker’s relationship with\n\nthe client extended only to planning, monitoring, and providing other support services. Id. at\n\n256. The fact that the case worker was entrusted with ensuring the client’s wellbeing proved\n\ncrucial in our assessment of the relationship. Id. at 255. Caulfield stands for the proposition that\n\nentrustment, not custody, is at the heart of a special protective relationship for purposes of\n\nimposing a common law tort duty. Niece, on the other hand, did involve a custodial relationship\n\nbetween the group home operator and the resident. As noted, however, Niece did not base its\n\nfinding of a special relationship on custody, but rather on the same ground as Caulfield,\n\nentrustment of a vulnerable individual. Niece, 131 Wn.2d at 50; Caulfield, 108 Wn. App. at 255.\n\nThus, the decisions of both the Supreme Court and this court signal that custody is not a\n\nprerequisite to a protective special relationship.5\n\n       The relationship between DSHS and children it places in foster homes is quite similar to\n\nthe one analyzed in Caulfield. Just as the county contracted with an in-home caregiver in\n\nCaulfield, DSHS contracts with licensed foster parents to take in the children. See DeWater v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 136, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1119387\"><a href=\"/opinion/1119387/dewater-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1059</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996). Like the county case workers, DSHS social\n\nworkers are responsible for monitoring the health and safety of the children. See former RCW\n\n74.13.031 (1998). Like the county’s disabled adult clients, the children are especially vulnerable\n\nto harms created by their caregivers. Aponte v. Dep’t of Soc. & Health Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">604</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n\n\n5\n  Alternatively, if some degree of custody were required, it is present. In Braam’s discussion of\na foster child’s substantive due process right to be free from unreasonable risks of harm and a\nright to reasonable safety, the Supreme Court characterized the State as “custodian and caretaker\nof foster children.” 150 Wn.2d at 700. This custodial relation is not somehow effaced when the\ninquiry shifts from substantive due process to a special relationship.\n                                                  13\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n622, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1134886\"><a href=\"/opinion/1134886/aponte-v-state-dshs/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998). The facts and policies at work in this appeal parallel those in\n\nCaulfield. As in Caulfield, they lead to the presence of a special relationship.\n\n          Perhaps more to the point, Niece found a special relationship “where one party is\n\n‘entrusted with the well being of another,’” and the entrusted party is vulnerable to a degree. 131\n\nWn.2d at 50 (quoting Lauritzen, 74 Wn. App. at 440). As noted, Niece did not rely on custody in\n\nfinding this relationship. Absent proper monitoring by the State, a foster child is wholly exposed\n\nto the will of the foster parents, whether that will is a blessing or a horror. In this setting, the\n\nState is the last watchman of the foster child’s well being. A more compelling illustration of the\n\nbases of a special relationship established in Niece is hard to imagine.\n\n          For these reasons, we hold that DSHS owed the children a duty like that recognized in\n\nCaulfield to take ordinary care to protect them from the tortious or criminal conduct of their\n\nfoster parents. The trial court erred to the extent it ruled that no such duty exists.\n\n3.        Breach of Duty\n\n          DSHS policies require case workers to conduct health and safety checks for foster\n\nchildren. Evidence presented at trial showed that such visits were supposed to occur every 90\n\ndays during the first year children are in a new foster home. The evidence, however, indicated\n\nthat Woolridge did not conduct such health and safety checks for SAH during the pre-adoption\n\nperiod.\n\n          DSHS’s failure to conduct required health and safety checks—either at all or with\n\nsufficient regularity—constituted sufficient evidence of a breach of its duty of care to avoid\n\ndismissal under CR 50. Accordingly, the trial court erred to the extent it ruled that there was an\n\n\n\n\n                                                   14\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\ninsufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find that DSHS breached its duty to protect\n\nthe children.6\n\n4.     Causation\n\n       The State argues that even if DSHS had a duty to perform health and safety checks, the\n\nchildren did not produce evidence from which the jury could find that a breach of that duty\n\ncaused their injuries. We disagree.\n\n       To prove negligence, a plaintiff must establish that the negligent party’s action or failure\n\nto act was the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s harm. Wuthrich v. King County, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n25, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2016). Proximate cause consists of two elements: cause in fact and legal\n\ncausation. Tyner v.

See id. Legal causation describes the policy-based\n\ndetermination that the defendant’s breach of the duty of care was of sufficient causal proximity\n\nto support imposition of liability for the resulting injuries. See id.\n\n       To establish cause in fact, a negligence plaintiff must prove that but for the defendant’s\n\nbreach of duty, the plaintiff would not have been injured. Id. This is a factual question, but may\n\nbe resolved as a matter of law where a reasonable jury could reach only one conclusion based on\n\nthe evidence presented. Hungerford v. Dep’t of Corr., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

Mere speculation or argumentative assertions of possible counterfactual events is\n\ninsufficient to prove that but for the defendant’s breach of duty the plaintiff would not have been\n\ninjured. Id. at 252, 254.\n\n\n\n\n6\n We do not suggest that compliance with DSHS policies is necessarily enough to ensure\ncompliance with the duty to exercise ordinary care to protect foster children.\n                                                  15\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n       The children claim that if DSHS had properly conducted health and safety checks, they\n\nwould have given the social worker some indication of abuse. SAH testified at trial that\n\n       if I felt safe and knew—and the woman was always there, if I felt safe, I believe I would\n       have said something. I was a very outspoken young girl.\n\nRP (Feb. 11, 2015) at 32 (emphasis added). The record also shows that SAH wanted someone to\n\ngive her the opportunity to tell what was happening to her and that she asked to talk privately\n\nwith a therapist. The jury reasonably could have found based on this evidence that had the social\n\nworker properly performed health and safety checks, SAH or the other girls would likely have\n\nfelt safe enough with the social worker to disclose the abuse or that the checks would have\n\notherwise uncovered or given DSHS reason to suspect abuse during the pre-adoption period.\n\n       In addition, records of SAH’s and HBH’s visits with a therapist showed that the girls\n\nwere “sexually acting out together and using language which you wouldn’t expect a child to\n\nuse.” RP (Feb. 9, 2015) at 48. The children’s standard of care expert testified if Woolridge had\n\nbeen aware of this behavior, it would have been reason to increase the health and safety checks\n\nby DSHS. The jury could reasonably have found based on this evidence that the social worker\n\nwould likely have encountered similar behaviors had she properly performed health and safety\n\nchecks and that such encounters would have triggered an investigation. Notably, the jury would\n\nhave considered all of this evidence in light of the testimony of the children’s standard of care\n\nexpert that proper health and safety checks in general help built rapport, encourage honest\n\ncommunication, and provide an avenue for disclosure of abuse and for observation of various\n\nindicators of abuse.\n\n       This evidence supplies a sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find that but for the\n\nallegedly deficient health and safety checks, SAH or one of the other girls would have disclosed\n\nthe abuse and the State would have intervened. It also provides a sufficient basis for a finding of\n\n                                                 16\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\nlegal causation. With this, there was a sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find\n\nthat DSHS’s breach of its duty to protect the children was a proximate cause of their injuries.\n\nTherefore, the trial court erred in entering judgment as a matter of law under CR 50 on the\n\nchildren’s claims regarding the pre-adoption period.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n       We hold that DSHS has a duty to exercise ordinary care to protect foster children on the\n\nbasis of its special relationship with such children. We hold also that the evidence, viewed in the\n\nlight most favorable to KMH, HBH, SAH, KEH, and JBH, supplied a legally sufficient\n\nevidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find by a preponderance that DSHS breached that duty\n\nduring the pre-adoption period and proximately caused at least some of the children’s damages.\n\nConsequently, we reverse the trial court’s CR 50 ruling and remand for trial on the claims of\n\nnegligent investigation and failure to take appropriate protective action during the period before\n\nadoption.\n\n       A majority of the panel having determined that only the foregoing portion of this opinion will\n\nbe printed in the Washington Appellate Reports and that the remainder shall be filed for public record\n\nin accordance with RCW 2.06.040, it is so ordered.\n\n                                    II. SPECIAL VERDICT FORM\n\n       The children argue that the trial court erred by providing a special verdict form that asked\n\nthe jury to segregate damages in an improper way.

However, even where the trial court\n\nerred in instructing the jury, we reverse only if the error prejudiced a party below. Hue, 127\n\nWn.2d at 92.\n\n        Jury instruction 19 required the jury to determine what percentage of total negligence was\n\nattributable to the negligence of DSHS and what percentage was attributable to the negligence of\n\nthe Hamricks, and stated that the total must equal 100 percent. Further, in calculating any\n\ndamage award, the jury was instructed to segregate any damages caused by such negligence from\n\ndamages caused solely by the Hamricks’ intentional acts. Instruction 21 stated:\n\n                In calculating any damage award, you must not include any damages that\n        were caused by the intentional acts of Drew Anne Hamrick and/or Scott Hamrick\n        and not proximately caused by negligence of State of Washington/DSHS, nonparty\n        Trey Hamrick, and/or nonparty Kelly Hamrick. Any damages caused solely by the\n        intentional acts of Drew Ann Hamrick and/or Scott Hamrick and not proximately\n        caused by negligence of State of Washington/DSHS, Trey Hamrick and/or Kelly\n        Hamrick must be segregated from and not made part of any damage award against\n        State of Washington/DSHS.\n\nCP at 632. The children agree that instructions 19 and 21 correctly state the law.\n\n        Questions 1 through 5 of the trial court’s verdict form involved whether DSHS was\n\nnegligent and question 6 involved whether the Hamricks were negligent. Question 7 then asked\n\nthe jury to find the amount of each child’s damages. Based on instruction 21, the jury was not\n\nallowed to include in this amount any damages caused solely by the Hamricks’ intentional acts.\n\nConsistent with instruction 19, question 8 required the jury to determine what percentage of total\n\nnegligence was attributable to the negligence of DSHS and what percentage was attributable to\n\nthe negligence of the Hamricks, and stated that the total must equal 100 percent. Again, the\n\nPlaintiffs do not object to this series of instructions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   18\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n       Next, question 9 asked the jury to determine whether the Hamricks’ intentional acts were\n\na proximate cause of any of the children’s damages. Question 10 then asked the jury:\n\n       What percentage of each plaintiff[s’] damages were caused by . . . all of the\n       intentional conduct of [Scott and Drew Ann Hamrick], . . . and what percentage of\n       plaintiff[s’] damages were caused by all of the negligent conduct you identified in\n       your answers to Question No. 7? Your answer for each plaintiff must total 100%.\n\nCP at 639. Question 10 also asked the jury to allocate percentages to either “[d]amages from\n\nintentional conduct” or “[d]amages from negligent conduct,” with the total equaling 100 percent.\n\nCP at 640.\n\n       The children argue that including question 10 in the verdict form misled the jury as to the\n\nsegregation of damages by indicating that it could allocate some of the negligence damages\n\nalready segregated under instruction 21 to the Hamricks’ intentional torts. We agree.\n\n       We read jury instructions as a whole when determining sufficiency. Rollins v. King\n\nCounty Metro Transit, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 379-80, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2602012\"><a href=\"/opinion/2602012/rollins-v-king-county-metro-transit/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009). We believe that here\n\nthe instructions read as a whole were misleading. Instruction 21 correctly required the jury to\n\nsegregate the damages caused by DSHS’s negligence from the damages “caused solely by the\n\n[Hamricks’] intentional acts.” CP at 632 (emphasis added). This instruction directed the jury\n\nresponse to question 7 of the verdict form, requiring the jury to exclude damages caused solely\n\nby the Hamricks’ intentional acts in determining the amount of the children’s damages. But\n\nquestion 10 then allowed for a second segregation of those negligence-related damages between\n\ndamages “caused by all of the negligent conduct” and those “caused by . . . all of the [Hamricks’]\n\nintentional conduct.” CP at 638-40.\n\n       The State argues that question 10 simply presented a step-by-step method of\n\nimplementing instruction 21. Read in the context of instruction 21, however, question 10 created\n\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\na significant risk that the jury would segregate damages twice. We hold that the jury instructions\n\nand verdict form questions as a whole were misleading as to the segregation of damages.7\n\n       However, KMH, HBH, SAH, KEH, and JBH have shown no resulting prejudice. An\n\nerroneous jury instruction is prejudicial if it affects the outcome of the trial.

We will not presume\n\nprejudice if an instruction was misleading but did not misstate the law. Paetsch v. Spokane\n\nDermatology Clinic, P.S., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">842</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 849, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015). Here, because the jury\n\nfound that DSHS was not negligent, it assigned no damages at all. It could not have been misled\n\nby the damage assignment portion of the special verdict form because it did not reach that\n\nportion of the form. Any error in that unused portion of the form had no effect on the outcome\n\nof the case.\n\n       Accordingly, we hold that the trial court committed no reversible error regarding the\n\nclaims that went to the jury in issuing the special verdict form. However, on remand the trial\n\ncourt’s verdict form should be consistent with our analysis above.\n\n                             III. EXCLUSION OF WITNESS TESTIMONY\n\n       The children argue that the trial court erred by excluding the testimony of two late-\n\ndisclosed witnesses without performing the analysis required by Jones v. City of Seattle, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">314</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2013). We agree that the trial court erred but hold that the error was\n\nharmless.\n\n\n\n\n7\n Question 9 also is inconsistent with instruction 21. Instruction 21 requires segregation of\ndamages caused solely by the Hamricks’ intentional conduct and damages caused by DSHS’s\nnegligence. Question 9 asked the jury to determine whether the Hamricks’ intentional acts were\na proximate cause of any of the children’s damages. Under instruction 21, the jury should have\nbeen asked whether the Hamricks’ intentional acts were the sole proximate cause of any of the\nchildren’s damages\n                                                 20\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\n       We review a trial court’s decision to exclude witness testimony for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Id. at 337. A trial court abuses its discretion if its decision is manifestly unreasonable\n\nor based on untenable grounds or reasons. Peralta v.

Jones,\n\n179 Wn.2d at 338. An error is harmless, and therefore not grounds for reversal, if it does not\n\naffect the outcome of the case. Blaney v. International Association of Machinists and\n\nAerospace Workers, Dist. No. 160, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 211, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2583898\"><a href=\"/opinion/2583898/blaney-v-international-assn-of-machinists/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">757</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004).\n\n       Under Jones, a trial court may not exclude late-disclosed witnesses as a sanction without\n\nfirst “explicitly consider[ing] whether a lesser sanction would probably suffice, whether the\n\nviolation at issue was willful or deliberate, and whether the violation substantially prejudiced the\n\nopponent’s ability to prepare for trial.” Id. at 338; see also Burnet, 131 Wn.2d at 484. The trial\n\ncourt need not invoke Jones or Burnet specifically, but the record must show that the trial court\n\nevaluated the necessary elements before excluding the testimony. Jones, 179 Wn.2d at 344.\n\n       Here, the trial court did not conduct the evaluation required by Jones and Burnet. In\n\nruling to exclude the testimony, the court reasoned as follows:\n\n       [I]f you were intending on calling them as witnesses, they could have been\n       disclosed at least a month ago; so I'm not going to allow them to testify at this time.\n       I don't think that their testimony is going to add materially to anything. We already\n       know the subject of the 2009 referral, and I would assume at some point we're going\n       to have a caseworker that's going to be testifying about that referral and why they\n       did or did not do anything. All right? So I don't think we need either [of the\n       witnesses] to add anything to that; so at this point, I'm not going to allow [them],\n       as lay witnesses, to testify.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\nRP (Feb. 5, 2015) at 26. This ruling did not address whether a lesser sanction would suffice,\n\nwhether the late disclosure was willful or deliberate, or whether the late disclosure prejudiced the\n\nState in its trial preparation. Therefore, the trial court erred under Jones.\n\n       However, the children have made no showing—in fact, they do not even argue—that the\n\nexclusion prejudiced them. The record shows that the witnesses would have testified to matters\n\nrelated to a 2009 referral to CPS. The evidence presented at trial showed that that particular\n\nreferral did not result in any mandate for DSHS to investigate. Consequently, the trial court\n\ndismissed all claims based on DSHS’s inaction in light of that referral, and the children have not\n\nappealed that dismissal. Given the dismissal and the absence of a showing of prejudice from\n\nexcluding the witnesses, we hold that the trial court’s failure to follow Jones did not prejudice\n\nKMH, HBH, SAH, KEH, or JBH and constituted harmless error.\n\n                   IV. COMMENTS REGARDING PERSONAL POLITICAL LEANINGS\n\n       The children argue that the trial court violated their rights to a trial presided over by a fair\n\nand impartial judge when it discussed matters of personal political preference. We disagree.\n\n       The children base their argument on the appearance of fairness doctrine. Under that\n\ndoctrine, they must show actual or perceived bias to establish a violation of their right to a fair\n\ntrial. GMAC v. Everett Chevrolet, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 154, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1074</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, review denied,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1008</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014). The critical question is whether the proceedings would have appeared\n\nunfair to a reasonably prudent and disinterested person. Id. We review appearance of fairness\n\nclaims de novo. In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against King, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 899, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2517933\"><a href=\"/opinion/2517933/in-re-disciplinary-proceeding-against-king/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1095</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010).\n\n       According to SAH’s declaration in support of the children’s motion for a new trial, the\n\npresiding judge discussed the lifelong trajectory of her political views and described political\n\n\n\n                                                  22\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\ndisagreements with another judge. Yet the record shows no nexus between these comments and\n\nthe parties or the issues to be decided in the case. It is unclear how commentary regarding\n\npolitical matters would have produced any actual or potential bias in a negligence case related to\n\nthe abuse of foster children. No reasonably prudent, disinterested person would infer from these\n\ncomments by the trial court that it was biased as to the issues before it.\n\n       The children also argued in the superior court that “it is clear that members of the jury\n\nlikely over[]heard the Court’s comments and was [sic] likely influenced by it in some unknown,\n\nbut prejudicial, way.” CP at 676. They speculated that jurors may have decided the case\n\naccording to their own political biases rather than the evidence presented in the case and the\n\ninstructions of the court as to the applicable law. However, the jury was properly instructed to\n\nfind the facts of the case based only on the evidence presented, and we presume that the jurors\n\nfollowed those instructions. Peralta, 191 Wn. App. at 950.\n\n       Speculation as to jurors’ motivations does not rebut this presumption and is no substitute\n\nfor a showing of actual or potential bias. The children have not shown that the trial court’s\n\ncomments produced any actual or perceived bias on the part of any jurors.\n\n                                      V. CUMULATIVE ERROR\n\n       The children also argue that the cumulative effects of the preceding claimed errors in\n\naggregate violated their right to a fair trial. We disagree.\n\n       The children cite no authority for applying the cumulative error doctrine in a civil case.\n\nIn criminal cases our courts have held that cumulative error may warrant reversal even where the\n\ntrial court’s individual errors were harmless. In re Pers. Restraint of Cross, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 690,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014). This is the case “when there have been several trial errors that standing\n\nalone may not be sufficient to justify reversal but when combined may deny a defendant a fair\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\ntrial.” State v. Greiff, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 929, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2632189\"><a href=\"/opinion/2632189/state-v-greiff/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000). “The test to determine whether\n\ncumulative errors require reversal of a defendant’s conviction is whether the totality of\n\ncircumstances substantially prejudiced the defendant and denied him a fair trial.” Cross, 180\n\nWn.2d at 690.\n\n        Assuming that the doctrine applies in civil cases, the children have not shown cumulative\n\nerror warranting reversal. The trial court erred in instructing the jury as to the segregation of\n\ndamages and in excluding two witnesses as a sanction for the children’s late disclosure of those\n\nwitnesses. However, there is no clear cumulative impact from those errors. The children argue\n\nthat “key rulings were decided on the fly without any serious consideration as to the controlling\n\nlaw and/or admitted evidence.” Br. of Appellant at 33-34. This addresses a commonality of\n\ncausation—and a highly abstracted one—but does not speak to the cumulative effects of those\n\nerrors. 8\n\n        The children have not shown that cumulative error denied them a fair trial.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n        We hold that DSHS has a duty to exercise ordinary care to protect foster children on the\n\nbasis of its special relationship with such children. We hold also that the evidence, viewed in the\n\nlight most favorable to the children, supplied a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a\n\nreasonable jury to find by a preponderance that DSHS breached that duty during the pre-adoption\n\nperiod and proximately caused at least some of the children’s damages. Consequently, we\n\n\n\n8\n  The children seem to argue that they suffered generalized prejudice because the trial court’s CR\n50 rulings forced them to give a closing argument that did not mirror their opening statement,\nharming their attorneys’ credibility in the eyes of the jury. However, a change in legal argument\nis an ineluctable result of granting a CR 50 motion on some but not all claims. In addition, the\njury was properly instructed to base its verdict only on the evidence presented and the\ninstructions of the court. We presume that the jurors followed those instructions, Peralta, 191\nWn. App. at 950, and nothing in the record or briefing shows that they did not.\n                                                 24\n\fNo. 47438-7-II\n\n\nreverse the trial court’s CR 50 ruling and remand for trial on the claims of negligent investigation\n\nand failure to take appropriate protective action during the period before adoption. However, we\n\ndisagree with the children’s other arguments and affirm the trial court’s judgment as to the 2008\n\nand 2010 CPS referrals.\n\n\n\n                                                     BJORGEN, C.J.\n We concur:\n\n\n\nJOHANSON, J.\n\n\n\n\nMAXA, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                                25\n\f</pre>",
