(Stats.1998, ch. 856, § 2.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Legislative History Generally</i></h2>\n<p>Before turning to the specifics of appellant's request for judicial notice, we have some general comments about requests for judicial notice of legislative history received by this court.</p>\n<p>Many attorneys apparently believe that every scrap of paper that is generated in the legislative process constitutes the proper subject of judicial notice. They are aided in this view by some professional legislative intent services. Consequently, it is not uncommon for this court to receive motions for judicial notice of documents that are tendered to the court in a form resembling a telephone book.<sup>[1]</sup> The various documents are not segregated and no attempt is made in a memorandum of points and authorities to justify each request for judicial notice. This must stop. And the purpose of this opinion is to help attorneys to better understand the role of legislative history and to encourage them to request judicial notice only of documents that constitute cognizable legislative history.</p>\n<p>Preliminarily, we note that resort to legislative history is appropriate only where statutory language is ambiguous. As the California Supreme Court has said, \"Our role in construing a statute is to ascertain the Legislature's intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citation.] In determining intent, we look first to the words of the statute, giving the language its usual, ordinary meaning. If there is no ambiguity in the language, we presume the Legislature meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the statute governs. [Citation.]\" (<i>Hunt v. Superior Court</i> (1999) 21 Cal.4th 984, 1000, 90 Cal.Rptr.2d 236, 987 P.2d 705, followed in <i>Curle v. Superior Court</i> (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1057, 1063, 103 Cal.Rptr.2d 751, 16 P.3d 166; accord: <i>Hoechst Celanese Corp. v. Franchise Tax Bd.</i> (2001) 25 Cal.4th 508, 519, 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 22 P.3d 324.) Thus, \"[o]nly when the language of a statute is susceptible to more than one reasonable construction is it appropriate to turn to extrinsic aids, including the legislative history of the measure, to ascertain its meaning.\" (<i>Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc. v. Superior Court</i> (1999) 19 Cal.4th 1036, 1055, 80 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 968 P.2d 539, followed in <i>People v. Farell</i> (2002) 28 Cal.4th 381, 394, 121 Cal.Rptr.2d 603, 48 P.3d 1155; accord: <i>Esberg v. Union Oil Co.</i> (2002) 28 Cal.4th 262, 269, 121 Cal.Rptr.2d 203, 47 P.3d 1069; <i>Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope &amp; Opportunity</i> (1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1119-1120, 81 Cal. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*523</span> Rptr.2d 471, 969 P.2d 564, and authorities cited therein; <i>Professional Engineers in Cal. Government v. State Personnel Bd.</i> (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 678, 688-689, 109 Cal.Rptr.2d 375, but see <i>Kulshrestha v. First Union Commercial Corp.</i> (2004) 33 Cal.4th 601, 613, fn. 7, 15 Cal.Rptr.3d 793, 93 P.3d 386.)</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, we will not require a party moving for judicial notice of legislative history materials to demonstrate the ambiguity of the subject statute at this juncture. This is so for two reasons. First, the ambiguity <i>vel non</i> of a statute will often be the central issue in a case, and parties would incur needless expense briefing the issue twice  once in a motion for judicial notice and again in a party's brief on the merits. Second, motions for judicial notice of legislative history materials are decided by writ panels of three justices who may not be the justices later adjudicating the case on the merits. The panel adjudicating the case on the merits should not be stuck with an earlier determination, by a different panel, as to the ambiguity <i>vel non</i> of a statute.</p>\n<p>Even though we will grant motions for judicial notice of legislative history materials without a showing of statutory ambiguity, we do so with the understanding that the panel ultimately adjudicating the case may determine that the subject statute is unambiguous, so that resort to legislative history is inappropriate.</p>\n<p>Even where statutory language is ambiguous, and resort to legislative history is appropriate, as a general rule in order to be cognizable, legislative history must shed light on the collegial view of the Legislature <i>as a whole.</i> (See <i>California Teachers Assn. v. San Diego Community College Dist.</i> (1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 701, 170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856.) Thus, to pick but one example, our Supreme Court has said, \"We have frequently stated . . . that the statements of an individual legislator, including the author of a bill, are generally not considered in construing a statute, as the court's task is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature as a whole in adopting a piece of legislation. [Citations.]\" (<i>Quintano v. Mercury Casualty Co.</i> (1995) 11 Cal.4th 1049, 1062, 48 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 906 P.2d 1057.)</p>\n<p>In order to help this court determine what constitutes properly cognizable legislative history, and what does not, in the future motions for judicial notice of legislative history materials in this court should be in the following form:<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>1. The motion shall identify each separate document for which judicial notice is sought as a separate exhibit;</p>\n<p>2. The moving party shall submit a memorandum of points and authorities citing authority why each such exhibit constitutes cognizable legislative history.</p>\n<p>To aid counsel in this respect, we shall now set forth a list of legislative history documents that have been recognized by the California Supreme Court or this court as constituting cognizable legislative history together with a second list of documents that do <i>not</i> constitute cognizable legislative history in this court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DOCUMENTS CONSTITUTING COGNIZABLE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY IN THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR THE THIRD APPELLATE DISTRICT</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Ballot Pamphlets: Summaries and Arguments/Statement of Vote</i> (<i>Robert L.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*524</span> <i>v.

The first document is entitled \"AB 1950 (Torlakson) Construction Defect Litigation Reform [¶] Fact Sheet.\" Nothing in appellant's motion suggests this document was made available to the Legislature as a whole. Rather, it appears to reflect the personal view of Assemblymember Tom Torlakson. Appellant argues that judicial notice is appropriate because the document was located in the file of a legislative committee. We acknowledge that in <i>James v. St. Elizabeth Community Hospital</i> (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 73 at page 81, 35 Cal.Rptr.2d 372, this court considered the contents of a document simply because it was found in the files of a committee. But, upon reflection, we now conclude that this practice should not be further condoned. Many pieces of paper that are never seen by members of the committee, let alone by the Legislature as a whole, find their way into committee files. Unlike committee reports, which are routinely available to the Legislature as a whole, these random documents are not reliable indicia of legislative intent. Because there is no showing that Assemblymember Torlakson's \"Fact Sheet\" was communicated to the Legislature as a whole, it does not constitute cognizable legislative history, and the request for judicial notice of this document is denied. (See <i>Quintano v. Mercury Casualty Co., supra,</i> 11 Cal.4th at p. 1062, 48 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 906 P.2d 1057; <i>People v. Patterson, supra,</i> 72 Cal.App.4th at p. 444, 84 Cal.Rptr.2d 870.)</p>\n<p>B. Next is the Assembly Judiciary Committee Report dated April 21, 1998, pertaining to AB 1950. The request for judicial notice is granted with respect to this document. (<i>Guillemin v. Stein, supra,</i> 104 Cal.App.4th at p. 166, 128 Cal.Rptr.2d 65, and authorities cited at p. 525 of this opinion, <i>ante.</i>)</p>\n<p>C. Next is the Senate Judiciary Committee Report pertaining to AB 1950. The request for judicial notice is granted with respect to this document. (<i>Martin v. Szeto, supra,</i> 32 Cal.4th at p. 450, 9 Cal.Rptr.3d 687, 84 P.3d 374, and authorities cited at p. 526 of this opinion, <i>ante.</i>)</p>\n<p>D. Next, and finally, are three enrolled bill reports on AB 1950, prepared respectively by the Office of Insurance Advisor, the Department of Real Estate, and the Franchise Tax Board.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*530</span> Generally, \"enrolled bill\" refers to a bill that has passed both houses of the Legislature and that has been signed by the presiding officers of the two houses. (1 Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction (6th ed.2002) § 15:1, p. 814.) In some states, enrollment also includes signature by the Governor (<i>ibid.</i>), but not in California.</p>\n<p>California law provides that bills ordered enrolled by the Senate or Assembly are delivered to the clerk of the house ordering the enrollment. (Gov.Code, § 9502.)<sup>[3]</sup> The clerk delivers the bills to the State Printer. (§ 9503.) The State Printer shall \"engross[<sup>[4]</sup>] or enroll (print) them\" and return them to the clerk. (§§ 9504-9505.) \"If the enrolled copy of a bill or other document is found to be correct, [it shall be presented] to the proper officers for their signatures. When the officers sign their names thereon, as required by law, <i>it is enrolled.</i>\" (§ 9507, italics added.) Enrolled bills are then transmitted to the Governor for his approval. (§ 9508.) If the Governor approves it and deposits it with the Secretary of State, it becomes the official record and is given a chapter number. (§ 9510.)</p>\n<p>Thus, an enrolled bill is one that has been passed by the Senate and Assembly but has not yet been signed by the Governor.</p>\n<p>An \"enrolled bill report\" is prepared by a department or agency in the executive branch that would be affected by the legislation. Enrolled bill reports are typically forwarded to the Governor's office before the Governor decides whether to sign the enrolled bill.</p>\n<p>In <i>McDowell v. Watson</i> (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1155 at pages 1161 through 1162, footnote 3 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 692] (<i>McDowell</i>), the Fourth Appellate District opined that enrolled bill reports should not be considered for legislative intent: \"[I]t is not reasonable to infer that enrolled bill reports prepared by the executive branch for the Governor were ever read by the Legislature.</p>\n<p>\"We recognize that courts have sometimes cited the latter materials as indicia of legislative intent. [Numerous citations.] However, none of those opinions address[es] the propriety of doing so. Accordingly, we decline to follow their example. `Such a departure from past rules of statutory construction, we believe, should be effected only after full discussion and exposure of the issue.' (<i>California Teachers Assn. v. San Diego Community College Dist.</i> [(1981)] 28 Cal.3d [692] 701 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856].)</p>\n<p>\"We also note that <i>Commodore Home Systems, Inc. v. Superior Court</i> (1982) 32 Cal.3d 211 at pages 218 through 219 [185 Cal.Rptr. 270, 649 P.2d 912], has been relied upon as authority for considering enrolled bill reports to determine legislative intent. [Citations.] However, that reliance is misplaced, because the Supreme Court in <i>Commodore</i> specifically noted that it had been requested to take notice of those reports and that the opposing party had not objected. [Citation.] Moreover, while <i>Commodore</i> cites authority for taking judicial notice of such executive acts, it does not address the relevance of that evidence to determining legislative intent.\" (<i>McDowell, supra,</i> 59 Cal.App.4th at p. 1162, fn. 3, 69 Cal.Rptr.2d 692; see also <i>Whaley v. Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc.</i> (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 479, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*531</span> 487, fn. 4, 17 Cal.Rptr.3d 88 [following <i>McDowell</i>].)</p>\n<p>This court has twice followed <i>McDowell, supra,</i> 59 Cal.App.4th 1155, 69 Cal.Rptr.2d 692, in declining judicial notice of enrolled bill reports. (See <i>Lewis v. County of Sacramento</i> (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 107, 121, fn. 4, 113 Cal.Rptr.2d 90; <i>People v. Patterson, supra,</i> 72 Cal.App.4th at p. 444, 84 Cal.Rptr.2d 870.)</p>\n<p>On the other hand, in <i>People v. Allen</i> (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 986, 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 253, this court said, \"While enrolled bill reports prepared by the executive branch for the Governor do not necessarily demonstrate the Legislature's intent [citation], they can <i>corroborate</i> the Legislature's intent, as reflected in legislative reports, by reflecting a contemporaneous common understanding shared by participants in the legislative process from both the executive and legislative branches.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 995, fn. 19, 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 253.)</p>\n<p>And in <i>People v. Carmony</i> (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1066, 26 Cal.Rptr.3d 365, this court recently took judicial notice of an enrolled bill report without discussion. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1078, 26 Cal.Rptr.3d 365.)</p>\n<p>For practical purposes, these inconsistencies have been resolved by a 2004 decision of our Supreme Court in <i>Elsner v. Uveges, supra,</i> 34 Cal.4th 915, 22 Cal.Rptr.3d 530, 102 P.3d 915. There, the court took judicial notice of an enrolled bill report prepared by the Department of Industrial Relations. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 934, 22 Cal.Rptr.3d 530, 102 P.3d 915.) The court said, \"Uveges challenges Elsner's reliance on the enrolled bill report, arguing that it is irrelevant because it was prepared after passage. However, we have routinely found enrolled bill reports, prepared by a responsible agency contemporaneous with passage and before signing, instructive on matters of legislative intent. [Citations.]\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 934, fn. 19, 22 Cal.Rptr.3d 530, 102 P.3d 915.)</p>\n<p>We are obligated to follow <i>Elsner.</i> (<i>Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court</i> (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455, 20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937.) We hereby grant appellant's motion for judicial notice of the enrolled bill reports, and we leave it to the panel deciding this case to determine the extent to which these reports may be \"instructive.\"</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, we respectfully add that we continue to find the logic of <i>McDowell, supra,</i> 59 Cal.App.4th 1155, 69 Cal.Rptr.2d 692, unassailable. In fact, enrolled bill reports cannot reflect the intent of the Legislature because they are prepared by the executive branch, and then not until after the bill has passed the Legislature and has become \"enrolled.\" Moreover, to permit consideration of enrolled bill reports as cognizable legislative history gives the executive branch an unwarranted opportunity to determine the meaning of statutes. That is the proper and exclusive duty of the judicial branch of government. \"`[T]he determination of the meaning of statutes is a judicial function. . . .' [Citation.]\" (<i>People v. Franklin</i> (1999) 20 Cal.4th 249, 256, 84 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 975 P.2d 30.)</p>\n<p>But we do not write on a clean slate.</p>\n<p>We concur: SCOTLAND, P.J., and DAVIS, J.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Appellant's motion was not one of these; rather, each document was separately tabbed.</p>\n<p>[2]  The correct way to request judicial notice of a document is by motion. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 22(a).)</p>\n<p>[3]  Further statutory references are to the Government Code.</p>\n<p>[4]  Traditionally, engrossing meant the process of final authentication in a single house.

(Stats.1998, ch. 856, § 2.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Legislative History Generally</i></h2>\n<p>Before turning to the specifics of appellant's request for judicial notice, we have some general comments about requests for judicial notice of legislative history received by this court.</p>\n<p>Many attorneys apparently believe that every scrap of paper that is generated in the legislative process constitutes the proper subject of judicial notice. They are aided in this view by some professional legislative intent services. Consequently, it is not uncommon for this court to receive motions for judicial notice of documents that are tendered to the court in a form resembling a telephone book.<sup>[1]</sup> The various documents are not segregated and no attempt is made in a memorandum of points and authorities to justify each request for judicial notice. This must stop. And the purpose of this opinion is to help attorneys to better understand the role of legislative history and to encourage them to request judicial notice only of documents that constitute cognizable legislative history.</p>\n<p>Preliminarily, we note that resort to legislative history is appropriate only where statutory language is ambiguous. As the California Supreme Court has said, \"Our role in construing a statute is to ascertain the Legislature's intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citation.] In determining intent, we look first to the words of the statute, giving the language its usual, ordinary meaning. If there is no ambiguity in the language, we presume the Legislature meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the statute governs. [Citation.]\" (<i>Hunt v.

This is so for two reasons. First, the ambiguity <i>vel non</i> of a statute will often be the central issue in a case, and parties would incur needless expense briefing the issue twice  once in a motion for judicial notice and again in a party's brief on the merits. Second, motions for judicial notice of legislative history materials are decided by writ panels of three justices who may not be the justices later adjudicating the case on the merits. The panel adjudicating the case on the merits should not be stuck with an earlier determination, by a different panel, as to the ambiguity <i>vel non</i> of a statute.</p>\n<p>Even though we will grant motions for judicial notice of legislative history materials without a showing of statutory ambiguity, we do so with the understanding that the panel ultimately adjudicating the case may determine that the subject statute is unambiguous, so that resort to legislative history is inappropriate.</p>\n<p>Even where statutory language is ambiguous, and resort to legislative history is appropriate, as a general rule in order to be cognizable, legislative history must shed light on the collegial view of the Legislature <i>as a whole.</i> (See <i>California Teachers Assn. v. San Diego Community College Dist.</i> (1981) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2608665\"><a href=\"/opinion/2608665/calif-teachers-assn-v-san-diego-comm-college-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></a></span>, 701, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2608665\"><a href=\"/opinion/2608665/calif-teachers-assn-v-san-diego-comm-college-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Thus, to pick but one example, our Supreme Court has said, \"We have frequently stated . . . that the statements of an individual legislator, including the author of a bill, are generally not considered in construing a statute, as the court's task is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature as a whole in adopting a piece of legislation.

The first document is entitled \"AB 1950 (Torlakson) Construction Defect Litigation Reform [¶] Fact Sheet.\" Nothing in appellant's motion suggests this document was made available to the Legislature as a whole. Rather, it appears to reflect the personal view of Assemblymember Tom Torlakson. Appellant argues that judicial notice is appropriate because the document was located in the file of a legislative committee. We acknowledge that in <i>James v. St. Elizabeth Community Hospital</i> (1994) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2245369\"><a href=\"/opinion/2245369/james-v-st-elizabeth-community-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span> at page 81, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2245369\"><a href=\"/opinion/2245369/james-v-st-elizabeth-community-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span>, this court considered the contents of a document simply because it was found in the files of a committee. But, upon reflection, we now conclude that this practice should not be further condoned. Many pieces of paper that are never seen by members of the committee, let alone by the Legislature as a whole, find their way into committee files. Unlike committee reports, which are routinely available to the Legislature as a whole, these random documents are not reliable indicia of legislative intent. Because there is no showing that Assemblymember Torlakson's \"Fact Sheet\" was communicated to the Legislature as a whole, it does not constitute cognizable legislative history, and the request for judicial notice of this document is denied. (See <i>Quintano v. Mercury Casualty Co., supra,</i> 11 Cal.4th at p. 1062, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1127676\"><a href=\"/opinion/1127676/quintano-v-mercury-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The request for judicial notice is granted with respect to this document. (<i>Guillemin v. Stein, supra,</i> 104 Cal.App.4th at p. 166, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The request for judicial notice is granted with respect to this document. (<i>Martin v. Szeto, supra,</i> 32 Cal.4th at p. 450, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Next, and finally, are three enrolled bill reports on AB 1950, prepared respectively by the Office of Insurance Advisor, the Department of Real Estate, and the Franchise Tax Board.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*530</span> Generally, \"enrolled bill\" refers to a bill that has passed both houses of the Legislature and that has been signed by the presiding officers of the two houses. (1 Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction (6th ed.2002) § 15:1, p. 814.) In some states, enrollment also includes signature by the Governor (<i>ibid.</i>), but not in California.</p>\n<p>California law provides that bills ordered enrolled by the Senate or Assembly are delivered to the clerk of the house ordering the enrollment. (Gov.Code, § 9502.)<sup>[3]</sup> The clerk delivers the bills to the State Printer. (§ 9503.) The State Printer shall \"engross[<sup>[4]</sup>] or enroll (print) them\" and return them to the clerk. (§§ 9504-9505.) \"If the enrolled copy of a bill or other document is found to be correct, [it shall be presented] to the proper officers for their signatures. When the officers sign their names thereon, as required by law, <i>it is enrolled.</i>\" (§ 9507, italics added.) Enrolled bills are then transmitted to the Governor for his approval. (§ 9508.) If the Governor approves it and deposits it with the Secretary of State, it becomes the official record and is given a chapter number. (§ 9510.)</p>\n<p>Thus, an enrolled bill is one that has been passed by the Senate and Assembly but has not yet been signed by the Governor.</p>\n<p>An \"enrolled bill report\" is prepared by a department or agency in the executive branch that would be affected by the legislation. Enrolled bill reports are typically forwarded to the Governor's office before the Governor decides whether to sign the enrolled bill.</p>\n<p>In <i>McDowell v. Watson</i> (1997) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></span>] (<i>McDowell</i>), the Fourth Appellate District opined that enrolled bill reports should not be considered for legislative intent: \"[I]t is not reasonable to infer that enrolled bill reports prepared by the executive branch for the Governor were ever read by the Legislature.</p>\n<p>\"We recognize that courts have sometimes cited the latter materials as indicia of legislative intent. [Numerous citations.] However, none of those opinions address[es] the propriety of doing so.

The court said, \"Uveges challenges Elsner's reliance on the enrolled bill report, arguing that it is irrelevant because it was prepared after passage.

We hereby grant appellant's motion for judicial notice of the enrolled bill reports, and we leave it to the panel deciding this case to determine the extent to which these reports may be \"instructive.\"</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, we respectfully add that we continue to find the logic of <i>McDowell, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In fact, enrolled bill reports cannot reflect the intent of the Legislature because they are prepared by the executive branch, and then not until after the bill has passed the Legislature and has become \"enrolled.\" Moreover, to permit consideration of enrolled bill reports as cognizable legislative history gives the executive branch an unwarranted opportunity to determine the meaning of statutes.
