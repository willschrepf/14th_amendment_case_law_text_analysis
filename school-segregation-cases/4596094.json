Turman            Opinion No. w'W-828\nExecutive Director\nTexas Youth Council            Re:   Does the Texas Youth\nState Office Buil&ing                Council have authority,\nAustin, Texas                        under existing law, to\n                                     establish a new institu-\n                                     tion or school when funds\n                                     are available for that\n                                     purpose, and related\nDear Dr. Turman:                     questions.\n        You have requested the opinion of this office in\nanswer to certain questions with reference to the establish-\nment of a new school or institution. Your first question Is\nas follows:\n            \"1* Does the Texas Youth Council\n       have the authority under existing law\n       (Article 5143d, Section 26 (a) and. (b)\n       to establish a new Institution or school\n       when funds are available for the purpose?\"\n        Sectlon 26, Article 5143d, Vernon's Civil Statutes,\nprovides:\n             \"When funds are available for the\n        purpose, the Youth Council may:\n             \"(a) Establish and operate places\n        for detention and dlagnosls of all de-\n        linquent children committed'to it;\n             \"(b) Establish and operate addltlon-\n        al treatment and training facilities, ln-\n        cludlng forestry or parks- maintenance\n        camps and boys' ranches, necessary to\n        classify and segregate and handle juve-\n        nile delinquents of different ages, habits\n        and mental and physical condition accord-\n        ing to their needs;\"\n\fDr. James A,.Turman, page 2 (~~-828).\n\n\n        We are of the opinion that this question is answered\nin the affirmative. The Texas Youth Council, which was cre-\nated by the 55th Legislature in 1957, was granted the control\nand administration of the State's correctional facilities for\ndelinquent children, At the time of Its creation, the Legis-\nlature recognized the fact that the'correctional facilities\nwere crowded and totally Inadequate. Realizing the need for\nnew facilities, the Legislature provided this method of estab-\nlishing new schools and institutions by the Youth Council when\nfunds are available,\n       Your second question Is ashfollows:\n             \"~2\n               . Does House Bill 4, Article II,\n        Section 1, Line Item 13, Appropriations\n        for the Texas Youth Council (Central Of-\n        fice), provide funds for the Texas Youth\n        Council to construct a new school for de-\n        linquent boys, at Gatesvllle?\"\n        This question is likewise answered in the affirmative\nfor the General Appropriation Bill (House Bill 4, Acts, 56\nLegislature, Third Called Session, 1959, Chapter 23, page :;71,\nprovides:\n       \"13. For construcing, equipping, fur-\n       nishing, paying architect's feea, and\n       perimeter fencing of a new school for\n       delinquent boys to be loacted at Gates-\n                                 .l,gg8,ooo.\"\n       $&$a&     added)\",* ' * '\n       Your third question reads as follows:\n            \"3. If your answers to the above\n       questions are in the affirmative, has the\n       Legislature created a New State Institution\n       separate and apart from the existing Gates-\n       ville School for Boys?\"\n        The above quoted portion of the General Appropriation\nBill provides funds for a \"new school for delinquent boys to\nbe located at Gatesville.\" The language used by the 56th Legis-\nlature is very plain and explicit. They have appropriated\nfunds for a'hew school\" and nowhere do they Indicate that this\nnew school shall be part of or even contiguous to the existing\nState School for Boys at Gatesville. However, it should be\nnoted that it does not follow that the new school could not be\n\fDr. James A, Turman, page 3 @w-828).\n\n\ncontiguous to the existing State school. In view of this,\nit is our opinion that the Legislature has provided funds\nfor the establishment of a New State Institution that is\nseparate and apart from the existing institution now lo-\ncated at Gatesville.\n        Your fourth question Is:\n            â€œ4. If your answers to the above\n       questions are in the affirmative, will\n       additional statutory authority be re-\n       quired before the Council can request,\n       and the Legislature appropriate, the\n       necessary funds for the operation of the\n       new school?\"\n        Section 44 of Article III of the Texas Constitution\nprovides that appropriations must be authorized by pre-existing\nlaw. We are of the opinion that Section 26 of Article 5143d,\nVernon's Civil Statutes, constitutes pre-existing law upon\nwhich appropriations may be made. Therefore, additional statu-\ntory authority will not be required before the Council can re-\nquest and the Legislature appropriate funds necessary for the\noperation of the new school.\n\n\n                           SUMMARY\n\n            The Texas Youth Council has authori-\n            ty under Section 26 of Article 5143d,\n            Vernon's Civil Statutes, to establish\n            new schools when funds are available\n            for that purpose.\n            House Bill 4, Article II, Section 1,\n            provides funds for the construction of\n            a new school for delinquent boys at\n            Gafesville, and it will be separate\n            and apart from the existing Gatesville\n            State School for Boys.\n\fDr. James A. Turman, page 4 (~~-828).\n\n\n            Additional statutory authority will\n            not be required before the Legislature\n            may appropriate operating expenses for\n            the new school.\n                              Yours very truly,\n                              WILL WILSON\n                              Attorney General of Texas\n\n\n\n                                    James M.
