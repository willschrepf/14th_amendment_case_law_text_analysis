She argues that she stated a claim for violation of the federal Americans with\nDisability Act (ADA) (Pub.L. No. 101-336; 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.) and California’s\nDisabled Persons Act (DPA) (Civ. Code, § 54 et seq.), or alternatively that the trial court\nshould have granted her leave to amend.1 We conclude that the trial court properly\nsustained the MTA’s demurrer but should have granted Gilbert-Davis leave to amend.\nTherefore, we reverse in part with directions.\n\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n\n       On October 21, 2010 Gilbert-Davis filed this action against the MTA, alleging\ncauses of action for premises liability and negligence. She alleged that on April 29, 2010\nshe entered the Green Line station in Norwalk and obtained a ticket from a ticket vending\nmachine. On her way to the boarding area she tripped and fell on “uneven concrete,”\nfracturing her right wrist. Gilbert-Davis alleged that the MTA negligently maintained the\narea where she fell, causing her to trip and fall and sustain injuries. MTA answered on\nDecember 22, 2010.\n       On October 14, 2011 Gilbert-Davis, with leave of court, filed a first amended\ncomplaint alleging causes of action for negligence, violation of the DPA, and violation of\nthe Unruh Civil Rights Act. She alleged that she is visually impaired and walks with a\nwhite cane with a red tip. She alleged that the walkway where she tripped “is required to\n\n\n1     Gilbert-Davis does not challenge the trial court’s decision to sustain without leave\nto amend the demurrer to her third cause of action for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights\nAct (Civ. Code, § 51 et seq.).\n\n\n                                             2\n\fbut fails to comply with various provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act of\n1990 (Pub[.L. No.] 1001-336 [sic]) (ADA), Title II and Title III of the ADA.” She\nfurther alleged that “the walkway violates the [ADA] in that there was an impermissible\nchange in level of more than 1/4 inch with a slope steeper than 1:2 which was\nunbeveled . . . .” She claimed that this condition denied her “right to full and equal\naccess to public facilities,” in violation of Civil Code section 54. She further alleged that\nthe MTA had actual or constructive notice of the violation.2\n       The trial court sustained the MTA’s demurrer to the first amended complaint with\nleave to amend on uncertainty grounds because a cause of action against a public entity\nmust be based on a statute, and Gilbert-Davis asserted claims for both negligence and\nstatutory violations. The court also found that the negligence cause of action in the first\namended complaint was uncertain because Gilbert-Davis cited both title II and title III of\nthe ADA in her negligence cause of action but failed to allege a violation of any\nparticular section. The court also noted that Gilbert-Davis did not sufficiently identify, in\nthe second and third causes of action for violations of the Civil Code, the particular\nprovisions on which her claims were based.\n       On January 17, 2012 Gilbert-Davis filed a second amended complaint that\nabandoned her negligence cause of action and alleged three statutory causes of action for\nviolation of the ADA, the DPA, and Unruh Civil Rights Act. Gilbert-Davis alleged in her\nADA claim that the MTA “owned, managed, maintained, and controlled the MTA ‘Green\nLine’ Station in the City of Norwalk.” She further alleged that the “walkway that was\nsolely for pedestrian traffic . . . was located near the turnstiles of the upper level of the\nStation. The walkway was the only access Plaintiff and members of the public had to the\n\n\n2      Counsel for Gilbert-Davis stated in his declaration in support of his request for\nleave to file the first amended complaint that he got the idea of adding the statutory\ncauses of action from his expert witness, Brad Avrit, who advised them that “the crack in\nthe cement which caused Patsy Gilbert-Davis to fall was, upon careful measurements,\nmore than ½ inch tall, was unbeveled and therefore violated at least one provision of the\nADA.”\n\n\n                                               3\n\fGreen Line platform . . . at the Norwalk station which was on the lower level of the\nNorwalk station. In turn, the platform was [the] only access Plaintiff, visually\nhandicapped and the general public had to the Green Line Trains.” Gilbert-Davis alleged\nthat the “walkway was required to but failed to comply with various provisions of Title II\nof the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (Pub[.L. No.] 1001-336 [sic]),” and that\nthe walkway violated the ADA because “it contained a change in level of more than 1/4\ninch with a slope steeper than 1:2 which was unbeveled . . . .” She again alleged that the\nMTA had actual or constructive notice of the violation in time to fix it or warn of it, and\nthat she “tripped and fell and fractured her wrist and injured her neck and back.” Her\nsecond cause of action for violation of the DPA was based on the same allegations, and\nincluded references to various provisions of the DPA and Civil Code section 54,\nsubdivision (c), violation of which she claimed was also a violation of the DPA.\n       The MTA demurred again. With her opposition to the demurrer, Gilbert-Davis\nsubmitted a proposed third amended complaint that revived her negligence and premises\nliability causes of action and restated her federal and state statutory claims.\n       At the April 18, 2012 hearing, counsel for Gilbert-Davis stated that the second\namended complaint “sets forth the precise language . . . of the [ADA] that was violated.”\nCounsel for Gilbert-Davis further stated, “The complaint, I regret to say, and the\nproposed amended complaint that I filed in an effort to make things easier . . . did not . . .\ncite the name of the code section.” Counsel for Gilbert-Davis asked for leave to “amend\nto provide the precise identity of the code section,” and identified the bases of the ADA\nclaim as the “2010 Standards for Accessible Design under section 303.2, 303.3 and 303.4\nas promulgated under title authority of the regulations 28 C.F.R. Part 36 revised July 1,\n1994.” The trial court took the matter under submission but allowed Gilbert-Davis to\nsubmit additional authority.\n       The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. The court stated in\nits written order: “In sustaining Defendant’s demurrer to the [first amended complaint],\nthis Court ruled that the pleading was uncertain in that it failed to allege statutory bases\nfor its causes of action. The Court also indicated that the facts as alleged appeared\n\n                                              4\n\finsufficient to establish liability. [¶] The [second amended complaint] is largely the\nsame as the [first amended complaint] — Plaintiff has eliminated her cause of action for\nnegligence and added dates to ¶¶ 5, 7, and 8; allegations regarding access to ¶ 7; and a\ndescription of Civil Code [section] 54 to ¶¶ 17-20 (with what is likely Plaintiff’s attempt\nto cite the specific statutory bases of the [second amended complaint]). Plaintiff\nreorganized her third cause of action and combined several paragraphs but the actual\ncontent is more or less the same. Plaintiff still uses incorrect and overbroad citations —\nfor example, Plaintiff continues to refer to the ADA as Public Law [No.] 1001-336 [sic]\nrather than the code citation, making it very difficult to determine the precise elements\nneeded for Plaintiff’s claims. Plaintiff still includes only conclusory allegations that\nDefendant was on notice and acted intentionally. [¶] The minimal and superficial\nchanges do not remedy the problems previously identified by the Court. Accordingly, the\ndemurrer is sustained. [¶] Plaintiff requests leave to amend and attaches a proposed\nThird Amended Complaint to her opposition. The proposed amended pleading still fails\nto remedy the defects previously identified by the Court. In light of Plaintiff’s continued\ninability to amend the pleadings, leave to amend is DENIED.” Gilbert-Davis appeals\nfrom the subsequent order dismissing her action.\n\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n\n       A.     Standard of Review\n       A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law. On appeal\nfrom an order of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to\namend, we review the pleading de novo to ascertain whether a cause of action has been\nstated as a matter of law. (Thrifty Payless, Inc. v. The Americana at Brand, LLC (2013)\n218 Cal.App.4th 1230, 1238; Rodriguez v. County of Los Angeles (2013) 217\nCal.App.4th 806, 810; Birke v. Oakwood Worldwide (2009) 169 Cal.App.4th 1540,\n1547.) “[W]e assume the truth of all facts properly pleaded in the complaint or\nreasonably inferred from the pleading, but not mere contentions, deductions, or\n\n                                              5\n\fconclusions of law. [Citation.] We then determine if those facts are sufficient, as a\nmatter of law, to state a cause of action under any legal theory. [Citation.]” (Scott v.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 743, 751.)\n       We review the trial court’s decision to deny leave to amend for an abuse of\ndiscretion. (Freeny v. City of San Buenaventura (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1339.)\nThe trial court abuses its discretion in denying leave to amend when there is a reasonable\npossibility the existing defects can be cured by amending the pleading. (McAllister v. Los\nAngeles Unified School Dist. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1198, 1206.) The plaintiff has the\nburden of demonstrating that the defect can be cured. (May v. City of Milpitas (2013)\n217 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1324.) This showing may be made for the first time in the\nreviewing court. (Fontenot v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 275,\nfn. 14; Careau & Co. v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d\n1371, 1386.)\n\n\n       B.      Cause of Action for Violation of the ADA\n       “‘Congress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy widespread discrimination against\ndisabled individuals. In studying the need for such legislation, Congress found that\n“historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and,\ndespite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with\ndisabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.”’ (PGA Tour, Inc. v.\nMartin (2001) 532 U.S. 661, 674-675 [149 L.Ed.2d 904, 121 S.Ct. 1879].) ‘Congress\nnoted that the many forms such discrimination takes include “outright intentional\nexclusion” as well as the “failure to make modifications to existing facilities and\npractices.” [Citation.] After thoroughly investigating the problem, Congress concluded\nthat there was a “compelling need” for a “clear and comprehensive national mandate” to\neliminate discrimination against disabled individuals, and to integrate them “into the\neconomic and social mainstream of American life.”’ (Id. at p. 675.) [¶] ‘In the ADA,\nCongress provided that broad mandate. . . . To effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA\nforbids discrimination against disabled individuals in major areas of public life, among\n\n                                              6\n\fthem employment (Title I of the Act), public services (Title II), and public\naccommodations (Title III).’ (PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, supra, 532 U.S. at p. 675, fns. &\ncitation omitted.)” (Californians for Disability Rights v. Mervyn’s LLC (2008) 165\nCal.App.4th 571, 583.)\n       In the first cause of action of her second amended complaint, Gilbert-Davis\nalleged a violation of title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12165),3 which covers\ndiscrimination in the provision of public services. Title II has two parts. Part A (42\nU.S.C. §§ 12131-12134) contains general provisions prohibiting discrimination. Part B\n(42 U.S.C. §§ 12141-12165) applies to discriminatory actions in public transportation\nprovided by public entities.\n       Title II provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of\nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,\nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such\nentity.” (42 U.S.C. § 12132.) “‘[Title II of the ADA] guards against both intentional\ndiscrimination and simple exclusion from services resulting not from intentional\ndiscriminatory acts, but rather from inaction, thoughtlessness, or equal treatment when\nparticular accommodations are necessary.’” (McGary v. City of Portland (9th Cir. 2004)\n386 F.3d 1259, 1267, quoting Presta v. Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Bd. (N.D.Cal.\n1998) 16 F.Supp.2d 1134, 1136; cf. Gunther v. Lin (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 223, 253,\noverruled on another ground in Munson v. Del Taco, Inc. (2009) 46 Cal.4th 661, 678.)\n“Since the ADA was designed to address indifference to or benign neglect of the plight of\nthe disabled, outright intentional discrimination is not required under title II of the ADA.”\n(Black v. Department of Mental Health (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 739, 749.) If, however,\nthe plaintiff seeks monetary damages for the alleged ADA violation, as Gilbert-Davis\ndoes here, the plaintiff must demonstrate intentional discrimination by the defendant.\n\n\n3        Gilbert-Davis did not, as she intimates in her opening brief, allege a violation of\ntitle III of the ADA in her second amended complaint. She specifically referenced only\ntitle II. In any event, as explained below, title III does not apply to this case.\n\n\n                                              7\n\f(Duvall v. County of Kitsap (9th Cir. 2001) 260 F.3d 1124, 1138.) The plaintiff,\nhowever, need only prove “deliberate indifference,” which “requires both knowledge that\na harm to a federally protected right is substantially likely, and a failure to act upon that\nthe likelihood.” (Id. at p. 1139.)\n       “‘To state a claim of disability discrimination under Title II, the plaintiff must\nallege four elements: (1) the plaintiff is an individual with a disability; (2) the plaintiff is\notherwise qualified to participate in or receive the benefit of some public entity’s\nservices, programs, or activities; (3) the plaintiff was either excluded from participation\nin or denied the benefits of the public entity’s services, programs, or activities, or was\notherwise discriminated against by the public entity; and (4) such exclusion, denial of\nbenefits, or discrimination was by reason of the plaintiff’s disability.’ [Citation.]” (In re\nM.S. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1252.)\n       Gilbert-Davis does not mention the elements of an ADA cause of action in her\nopening brief, let alone make a reasoned attempt to demonstrate that she pleaded all of\nthe necessary elements. As the appellant, Gilbert-Davis has the burden of demonstrating\nerror affirmatively. “In order to prevail on appeal from an order sustaining a demurrer,\nthe appellant must affirmatively demonstrate error . . . [by] show[ing] that the facts\npleaded are sufficient to establish every element of a cause of action and overcome all\nlegal grounds on which the trial court sustained the demurrer. [Citation.]” (Scott v.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., supra, 214 Cal.App.4th at p. 752; accord, Landmark\nScreens, LLC v. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, LLP (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.) She\nhas failed to make this showing. Therefore, we reject her challenge to the trial court’s\norder sustaining the MTA’s demurrer to her ADA cause of action.\n\n\n       C.       Cause of Action for Violation of the DPA\n       In her second amended complaint Gilbert-Davis attempted to state a cause of\naction for violation of the DPA that is derivative of her ADA cause of action. She\nspecifically referenced Civil Code section 54, subdivisions (a) and (c), as well as\nsection 54.1.\n\n                                                8\n\f       Civil Code section 54, subdivision (a), provides that “[i]ndividuals with\ndisabilities or medical conditions have the same right as the general public to the full and\nfree use of the streets, highways, sidewalks, walkways, public buildings, medical\nfacilities, including hospitals, clinics, and physicians’ offices, public facilities, and other\npublic places.” Civil Code section 54.1, subdivision (a)(1), states that “[i]ndividuals with\ndisabilities shall be entitled to full and equal access, as other members of the general\npublic, to . . . privileges of all common carriers, airplanes, motor vehicles, railroad trains,\nmotorbuses, streetcars, boats, or any other public conveyances or modes of transportation\n(whether private, public, franchised, licensed, contracted, or otherwise provided) . . .\nsubject only to the conditions and limitations established by law, or state or federal\nregulation, and applicable alike to all persons.” Subdivision (c) of Civil Code section 54\nstates that “[a] violation of the right of an individual under the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990 (Pub[.L. No.] 101-336) also constitutes a violation of this\nsection.” (See Baughman v. Walt Disney World Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 1438, 1446\n[“‘the DPA incorporates the ADA to the extent that “A violation of the right of an\nindividual under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Pub[.L. No.] 101-336) also\nconstitutes a violation of this section”’”].)\n       As best as we can discern, Gilbert-Davis does not argue on appeal that she stated a\ncause of action for violation of the DPA that is independent of her ADA cause of action,\nand her position remains that her DPA claim is entirely derivative of her ADA claim.\nGilbert-Davis argues only that she stated a claim for violation of the DPA because she\nstated a claim for violation of the ADA. In other words, Gilbert-Davis concedes that her\nDPA and ADA claims stand or fall together. Therefore, they fall together. (Cf. Ball v.\nFleetBoston Financial Corp. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 794, 800 [“[w]here a trial court has\nconcluded the plaintiff did not state sufficient facts to support a statutory claim and\ntherefore sustained a demurrer as to that claim, a demurrer is also properly sustained as to\na claim for declaratory relief which is ‘wholly derivative’ of the statutory claim”].)\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f       D.     Leave To Amend\n       The only issue remaining is whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying\nGilbert-Davis leave to amend. Gilbert-Davis argues that she can cure the deficiencies in\nher statutory causes of action by alleging “that the unbeveled ‘change in level’ was more\nthan one and a quarter inches, or almost six times the maximum height differential that is\npermitted by the ADA. Plaintiff can allege that the height differential violates the\nStandards for Accessible Design, Sections 303.3 and promulgated under and as published\nin 28 CFR Part 36, revised July 1, 1994 issued by the Department of Justice.”\n       Section 36.101 provides that the purpose of Part 36 is “to implement title III” of\nthe ADA (42 U.S.C. § 12181), which applies to public accommodations and services\noperated by private entities. The MTA, however, is a public entity. (See Kajima/Ray\nWilson v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (2000) 23 Cal.4th\n305, 317; Douglas E. Barnhart, Inc. v. CMC Fabricators, Inc. (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th\n230, 243.) Title III does not apply to public entities. (Disabled Rights Action Comm. v.\nLas Vegas Events (9th Cir. 2004) 375 F.3d 861, 876-877; see Bloom v. Bexar County,\nTex. (5th Cir. 1997) 130 F.3d 722, 726 [“ADA Title III expressly does not apply to public\nentities”]; DeBord v. Board of Educ. of Ferguson-Florissant (8th Cir. 1997) 126 F.3d\n1102, 1106 [“Title III of the ADA applies to private entities providing public\naccommodations . . . not to public entities”].) Therefore, Gilbert-Davis’ reliance on Part\n36 of 28 Code of Federal Regulations is misplaced, and her proposed amendment still\nwill not state an ADA claim against the MTA.\n       Section 12181 of title 42 of the United States Code, the only section of the ADA\ncited by Gilbert-Davis, is similarly inapplicable. This section is part of subchapter III,\nentitled “Public Accommodations and Services Operated by Private Entities.” Again,\nbecause the MTA is public entity, section 12181 does not apply, and an amendment\nbased on this statute also will not state a claim for violation of the ADA.4\n\n\n\n4      The design standards that Gilbert-Davis cited to the trial court and that she\nreferences in her opening brief can be found in 39 Code of Federal Regulations part 1191.\n\n                                             10\n\f       “A court’s sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend is appropriate when,\nbased on ‘“‘the nature of the [complaint’s] defects and [the plaintiff’s] previous\nunsuccessful attempts to plead,’”’ it is improbable the plaintiff can state a cause of\naction.” (Jenkins v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 497, 534.)\nThis principle applies to Gilbert-Davis’ statutory causes of action. Because Gilbert-Davis\nhas not met her burden of demonstrating that she can cure the defects in her ADA and\nDPA causes of action (May v. City of Milpitas, supra, 217 Cal.App.4th at p. 1324),5 the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in denying her leave to amend these causes of\naction (McAllister v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist., supra, 216 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1206).\n       Gilbert-Davis can amend her complaint, however to state claims for premises\nliability and dangerous condition negligence under Government Code section 835.6\n\n\nThey are part of the Americans with Disabilities Act Access Guidelines (ADAAG).\nGuideline 303.1 provides that “[w]here changes in level are permitted in floor or ground\nsurfaces, they shall comply with 303,” entitled “Changes in Level.” Section 303.2\nprovides that “[c]hanges in level of ¼ inch (6.4 mm) high maximum shall be permitted to\nbe vertical.” Section 303.3 states that “[c]hanges in level between ¼ inch (6.4 mm) high\nminimum and ½ inch (13 mm) high maximum shall be beveled with a slope not steeper\nthan 1:2.” Gilbert-Davis, however, provides no explanation of how these guidelines\napply in this case.\n5      Gilbert-Davis does argue that she can amend her DPA cause of action to state a\nclaim other than stating how she would amend her ADA claim.\n6       Government Code section 835 provides that “[e]xcept as provided by statute, a\npublic entity is liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if the\nplaintiff establishes that the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the\ninjury, that the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous condition, that the\ndangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was\nincurred, and that either:\n        “(a) A negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the public entity\nwithin the scope of his employment created the dangerous condition; or\n        “(b) The public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition\nunder Section 835.2 a sufficient time prior to the injury to have taken measures to protect\nagainst the dangerous condition.”\n\n\n                                             11\n\fAlthough Gilbert-Davis decided to abandon her negligence claim between the first\namended complaint and the second amended complaint, the trial court never sustained a\ndemurrer to that cause of action.7 We interpret her inclusion in her proposed third\namended complaint, submitted in response to the MTA’s demurrer to the second\namended complaint, of causes of action for negligence and dangerous condition of public\nproperty as an inartful request for leave to amend to state or revive those causes of action.\nWe agree with the MTA’s acknowledgement that “it would appear that the original claim\nfor alleged premises liability, since abandoned, may have been [the] appropriate cause of\naction . . . .” Therefore, Gilbert-Davis may have leave to amend to state negligence\ncauses of action for premises liability and dangerous condition of public property.\n\n\n\n\n7      Although the first cause of action in the first amended complaint was entitled\nnegligence, it was based on a violation of the ADA.\n\n\n                                             12\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n\n\n       The order of dismissal is reversed. The matter is remanded to the trial court with\ndirections to vacate its order sustaining the MTA’s demurrer to the second amended\ncomplaint without leave to amend and to enter a new order sustaining the demurrer with\nleave to file a third amended complaint alleging only negligence causes of action for\npremises liability and dangerous condition of public property. The parties are to bear\ntheir costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                 SEGAL, J.*\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n              PERLUSS, P.

She argues that she stated a claim for violation of the federal Americans with\nDisability Act (ADA) (Pub.L. No. 101-336; 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.) and California’s\nDisabled Persons Act (DPA) (Civ. Code, § 54 et seq.), or alternatively that the trial court\nshould have granted her leave to amend.1 We conclude that the trial court properly\nsustained the MTA’s demurrer but should have granted Gilbert-Davis leave to amend.\nTherefore, we reverse in part with directions.\n\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n\n       On October 21, 2010 Gilbert-Davis filed this action against the MTA, alleging\ncauses of action for premises liability and negligence. She alleged that on April 29, 2010\nshe entered the Green Line station in Norwalk and obtained a ticket from a ticket vending\nmachine. On her way to the boarding area she tripped and fell on “uneven concrete,”\nfracturing her right wrist. Gilbert-Davis alleged that the MTA negligently maintained the\narea where she fell, causing her to trip and fall and sustain injuries. MTA answered on\nDecember 22, 2010.\n       On October 14, 2011 Gilbert-Davis, with leave of court, filed a first amended\ncomplaint alleging causes of action for negligence, violation of the DPA, and violation of\nthe Unruh Civil Rights Act. She alleged that she is visually impaired and walks with a\nwhite cane with a red tip. She alleged that the walkway where she tripped “is required to\n\n\n1     Gilbert-Davis does not challenge the trial court’s decision to sustain without leave\nto amend the demurrer to her third cause of action for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights\nAct (Civ. Code, § 51 et seq.).\n\n\n                                             2\n\fbut fails to comply with various provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act of\n1990 (Pub[.L. No.] 1001-336 [sic]) (ADA), Title II and Title III of the ADA.” She\nfurther alleged that “the walkway violates the [ADA] in that there was an impermissible\nchange in level of more than 1/4 inch with a slope steeper than 1:2 which was\nunbeveled . . . .” She claimed that this condition denied her “right to full and equal\naccess to public facilities,” in violation of Civil Code section 54. She further alleged that\nthe MTA had actual or constructive notice of the violation.2\n       The trial court sustained the MTA’s demurrer to the first amended complaint with\nleave to amend on uncertainty grounds because a cause of action against a public entity\nmust be based on a statute, and Gilbert-Davis asserted claims for both negligence and\nstatutory violations. The court also found that the negligence cause of action in the first\namended complaint was uncertain because Gilbert-Davis cited both title II and title III of\nthe ADA in her negligence cause of action but failed to allege a violation of any\nparticular section. The court also noted that Gilbert-Davis did not sufficiently identify, in\nthe second and third causes of action for violations of the Civil Code, the particular\nprovisions on which her claims were based.\n       On January 17, 2012 Gilbert-Davis filed a second amended complaint that\nabandoned her negligence cause of action and alleged three statutory causes of action for\nviolation of the ADA, the DPA, and Unruh Civil Rights Act. Gilbert-Davis alleged in her\nADA claim that the MTA “owned, managed, maintained, and controlled the MTA ‘Green\nLine’ Station in the City of Norwalk.” She further alleged that the “walkway that was\nsolely for pedestrian traffic . . . was located near the turnstiles of the upper level of the\nStation. The walkway was the only access Plaintiff and members of the public had to the\n\n\n2      Counsel for Gilbert-Davis stated in his declaration in support of his request for\nleave to file the first amended complaint that he got the idea of adding the statutory\ncauses of action from his expert witness, Brad Avrit, who advised them that “the crack in\nthe cement which caused Patsy Gilbert-Davis to fall was, upon careful measurements,\nmore than ½ inch tall, was unbeveled and therefore violated at least one provision of the\nADA.”\n\n\n                                               3\n\fGreen Line platform . . . at the Norwalk station which was on the lower level of the\nNorwalk station. In turn, the platform was [the] only access Plaintiff, visually\nhandicapped and the general public had to the Green Line Trains.” Gilbert-Davis alleged\nthat the “walkway was required to but failed to comply with various provisions of Title II\nof the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (Pub[.L. No.] 1001-336 [sic]),” and that\nthe walkway violated the ADA because “it contained a change in level of more than 1/4\ninch with a slope steeper than 1:2 which was unbeveled . . . .” She again alleged that the\nMTA had actual or constructive notice of the violation in time to fix it or warn of it, and\nthat she “tripped and fell and fractured her wrist and injured her neck and back.” Her\nsecond cause of action for violation of the DPA was based on the same allegations, and\nincluded references to various provisions of the DPA and Civil Code section 54,\nsubdivision (c), violation of which she claimed was also a violation of the DPA.\n       The MTA demurred again. With her opposition to the demurrer, Gilbert-Davis\nsubmitted a proposed third amended complaint that revived her negligence and premises\nliability causes of action and restated her federal and state statutory claims.\n       At the April 18, 2012 hearing, counsel for Gilbert-Davis stated that the second\namended complaint “sets forth the precise language . . . of the [ADA] that was violated.”\nCounsel for Gilbert-Davis further stated, “The complaint, I regret to say, and the\nproposed amended complaint that I filed in an effort to make things easier . . . did not . . .\ncite the name of the code section.” Counsel for Gilbert-Davis asked for leave to “amend\nto provide the precise identity of the code section,” and identified the bases of the ADA\nclaim as the “2010 Standards for Accessible Design under section 303.2, 303.3 and 303.4\nas promulgated under title authority of the regulations 28 C.F.R. Part 36 revised July 1,\n1994.” The trial court took the matter under submission but allowed Gilbert-Davis to\nsubmit additional authority.\n       The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. The court stated in\nits written order: “In sustaining Defendant’s demurrer to the [first amended complaint],\nthis Court ruled that the pleading was uncertain in that it failed to allege statutory bases\nfor its causes of action. The Court also indicated that the facts as alleged appeared\n\n                                              4\n\finsufficient to establish liability. [¶] The [second amended complaint] is largely the\nsame as the [first amended complaint] — Plaintiff has eliminated her cause of action for\nnegligence and added dates to ¶¶ 5, 7, and 8; allegations regarding access to ¶ 7; and a\ndescription of Civil Code [section] 54 to ¶¶ 17-20 (with what is likely Plaintiff’s attempt\nto cite the specific statutory bases of the [second amended complaint]). Plaintiff\nreorganized her third cause of action and combined several paragraphs but the actual\ncontent is more or less the same. Plaintiff still uses incorrect and overbroad citations —\nfor example, Plaintiff continues to refer to the ADA as Public Law [No.] 1001-336 [sic]\nrather than the code citation, making it very difficult to determine the precise elements\nneeded for Plaintiff’s claims. Plaintiff still includes only conclusory allegations that\nDefendant was on notice and acted intentionally. [¶] The minimal and superficial\nchanges do not remedy the problems previously identified by the Court. Accordingly, the\ndemurrer is sustained. [¶] Plaintiff requests leave to amend and attaches a proposed\nThird Amended Complaint to her opposition. The proposed amended pleading still fails\nto remedy the defects previously identified by the Court. In light of Plaintiff’s continued\ninability to amend the pleadings, leave to amend is DENIED.” Gilbert-Davis appeals\nfrom the subsequent order dismissing her action.\n\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n\n       A.     Standard of Review\n       A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law. On appeal\nfrom an order of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to\namend, we review the pleading de novo to ascertain whether a cause of action has been\nstated as a matter of law.

Title II has two parts. Part A (42\nU.S.C. §§ 12131-12134) contains general provisions prohibiting discrimination. Part B\n(42 U.S.C. §§ 12141-12165) applies to discriminatory actions in public transportation\nprovided by public entities.\n       Title II provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of\nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,\nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such\nentity.” (42 U.S.C. § 12132.) “‘[Title II of the ADA] guards against both intentional\ndiscrimination and simple exclusion from services resulting not from intentional\ndiscriminatory acts, but rather from inaction, thoughtlessness, or equal treatment when\nparticular accommodations are necessary.’” (McGary v.

She\nspecifically referenced Civil Code section 54, subdivisions (a) and (c), as well as\nsection 54.1.\n\n                                                8\n\f       Civil Code section 54, subdivision (a), provides that “[i]ndividuals with\ndisabilities or medical conditions have the same right as the general public to the full and\nfree use of the streets, highways, sidewalks, walkways, public buildings, medical\nfacilities, including hospitals, clinics, and physicians’ offices, public facilities, and other\npublic places.” Civil Code section 54.1, subdivision (a)(1), states that “[i]ndividuals with\ndisabilities shall be entitled to full and equal access, as other members of the general\npublic, to . . . privileges of all common carriers, airplanes, motor vehicles, railroad trains,\nmotorbuses, streetcars, boats, or any other public conveyances or modes of transportation\n(whether private, public, franchised, licensed, contracted, or otherwise provided) . . .\nsubject only to the conditions and limitations established by law, or state or federal\nregulation, and applicable alike to all persons.” Subdivision (c) of Civil Code section 54\nstates that “[a] violation of the right of an individual under the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990 (Pub[.L. No.] 101-336) also constitutes a violation of this\nsection.” (See Baughman v. Walt Disney World Co.

No.] 101-336) also\nconstitutes a violation of this section”’”].)\n       As best as we can discern, Gilbert-Davis does not argue on appeal that she stated a\ncause of action for violation of the DPA that is independent of her ADA cause of action,\nand her position remains that her DPA claim is entirely derivative of her ADA claim.\nGilbert-Davis argues only that she stated a claim for violation of the DPA because she\nstated a claim for violation of the ADA. In other words, Gilbert-Davis concedes that her\nDPA and ADA claims stand or fall together. Therefore, they fall together. (Cf. Ball v.\nFleetBoston Financial Corp.

Leave To Amend\n       The only issue remaining is whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying\nGilbert-Davis leave to amend. Gilbert-Davis argues that she can cure the deficiencies in\nher statutory causes of action by alleging “that the unbeveled ‘change in level’ was more\nthan one and a quarter inches, or almost six times the maximum height differential that is\npermitted by the ADA. Plaintiff can allege that the height differential violates the\nStandards for Accessible Design, Sections 303.3 and promulgated under and as published\nin 28 CFR Part 36, revised July 1, 1994 issued by the Department of Justice.”\n       Section 36.101 provides that the purpose of Part 36 is “to implement title III” of\nthe ADA (42 U.S.C. § 12181), which applies to public accommodations and services\noperated by private entities. The MTA, however, is a public entity. (See Kajima/Ray\nWilson v.

Therefore, Gilbert-Davis’ reliance on Part\n36 of 28 Code of Federal Regulations is misplaced, and her proposed amendment still\nwill not state an ADA claim against the MTA.\n       Section 12181 of title 42 of the United States Code, the only section of the ADA\ncited by Gilbert-Davis, is similarly inapplicable. This section is part of subchapter III,\nentitled “Public Accommodations and Services Operated by Private Entities.” Again,\nbecause the MTA is public entity, section 12181 does not apply, and an amendment\nbased on this statute also will not state a claim for violation of the ADA.4\n\n\n\n4      The design standards that Gilbert-Davis cited to the trial court and that she\nreferences in her opening brief can be found in 39 Code of Federal Regulations part 1191.\n\n                                             10\n\f       “A court’s sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend is appropriate when,\nbased on ‘“‘the nature of the [complaint’s] defects and [the plaintiff’s] previous\nunsuccessful attempts to plead,’”’ it is improbable the plaintiff can state a cause of\naction.” (Jenkins v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 534.)\nThis principle applies to Gilbert-Davis’ statutory causes of action. Because Gilbert-Davis\nhas not met her burden of demonstrating that she can cure the defects in her ADA and\nDPA causes of action (May v. City of Milpitas, supra, 217 Cal.App.4th at p. 1324),5 the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in denying her leave to amend these causes of\naction (McAllister v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist., supra, 216 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1206).\n       Gilbert-Davis can amend her complaint, however to state claims for premises\nliability and dangerous condition negligence under Government Code section 835.6\n\n\nThey are part of the Americans with Disabilities Act Access Guidelines (ADAAG).\nGuideline 303.1 provides that “[w]here changes in level are permitted in floor or ground\nsurfaces, they shall comply with 303,” entitled “Changes in Level.” Section 303.2\nprovides that “[c]hanges in level of ¼ inch (6.4 mm) high maximum shall be permitted to\nbe vertical.” Section 303.3 states that “[c]hanges in level between ¼ inch (6.4 mm) high\nminimum and ½ inch (13 mm) high maximum shall be beveled with a slope not steeper\nthan 1:2.” Gilbert-Davis, however, provides no explanation of how these guidelines\napply in this case.\n5      Gilbert-Davis does argue that she can amend her DPA cause of action to state a\nclaim other than stating how she would amend her ADA claim.\n6       Government Code section 835 provides that “[e]xcept as provided by statute, a\npublic entity is liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if the\nplaintiff establishes that the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the\ninjury, that the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous condition, that the\ndangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was\nincurred, and that either:\n        “(a) A negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the public entity\nwithin the scope of his employment created the dangerous condition; or\n        “(b) The public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition\nunder Section 835.2 a sufficient time prior to the injury to have taken measures to protect\nagainst the dangerous condition.”\n\n\n                                             11\n\fAlthough Gilbert-Davis decided to abandon her negligence claim between the first\namended complaint and the second amended complaint, the trial court never sustained a\ndemurrer to that cause of action.7 We interpret her inclusion in her proposed third\namended complaint, submitted in response to the MTA’s demurrer to the second\namended complaint, of causes of action for negligence and dangerous condition of public\nproperty as an inartful request for leave to amend to state or revive those causes of action.\nWe agree with the MTA’s acknowledgement that “it would appear that the original claim\nfor alleged premises liability, since abandoned, may have been [the] appropriate cause of\naction . . . .” Therefore, Gilbert-Davis may have leave to amend to state negligence\ncauses of action for premises liability and dangerous condition of public property.\n\n\n\n\n7      Although the first cause of action in the first amended complaint was entitled\nnegligence, it was based on a violation of the ADA.\n\n\n                                             12\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n\n\n       The order of dismissal is reversed. The matter is remanded to the trial court with\ndirections to vacate its order sustaining the MTA’s demurrer to the second amended\ncomplaint without leave to amend and to enter a new order sustaining the demurrer with\nleave to file a third amended complaint alleging only negligence causes of action for\npremises liability and dangerous condition of public property. The parties are to bear\ntheir costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                 SEGAL, J.*\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n              PERLUSS, P.
