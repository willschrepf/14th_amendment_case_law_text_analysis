Indeed, if\nanything, statements that LAUSD was engaged in\n‘discussions’ to achieve greater compliance with the MCD\nwould have only reinforced Appellants’ belief that LAUSD\nplanned to continue to offer special education centers as part\nof the ‘full continuum’ of services available to disabled\nstudents in LAUSD.

LAUSD\n\nneither the MCD nor any governing law. LAUSD’s\nargument misses the point. The question before us is\nwhether Appellants were reasonably on notice that their\ninterest in maintaining special education centers as\nplacement options for their children was not being\nadequately represented by the existing parties to the Chanda\nSmith litigation. We conclude that they were not on notice,\nbecause Appellants reasonably construed the MCD as\nensuring the maintenance of the special education centers\ntheir children attended.

Accordingly, the Petition for Rehearing and\nRehearing En Banc is DENIED.\n\n    Appellants’ June 23, 2016 Motion for an Interim\nInjunction is likewise DENIED without prejudice to refiling\nin the district court.

LAUSD\n\ninterest in ensuring the receipt of public education consistent\nwith their disabilities and federal law.\n\n               I. SUMMARY OF FACTS\n\n     A. Relevant Statutory History and Landscape\n\n    We are called upon today to review only the district\ncourt’s denial of Appellant’s motion to intervene, and\ntherefore do not opine on whether the actions of LAUSD that\nprompted Appellants to file their motions violated federal or\nstate law. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore that at the core of\nthis case is a fundamental disagreement as to the proper\napproach to education of a class of moderately-to-severely\ndisabled children. Thus the statutes upon which the present\nmotion rests provide the basis of our analysis.\n\n    Before 1975, children with disabilities were often\nexcluded from general public schools and required to attend\nseparate school campuses comprised wholly or primarily of\ndisabled children (termed “special education centers” by\nLAUSD). 20 U.S.C. § 1400(c)(2)(B). Following claims that\nthis allocation violated due process, see, e.g., Mills v. Bd. Of\nEduc. of the Dist. of Columbia, 348 F. Supp. 866, 869–70,\n875 (D.D.C. 1972), Congress enacted the Education for All\nHandicapped Children Act (which has since been retitled as\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (the\n‘IDEA’)). See 20 U.S.C. § 1400, et seq.\n\n    The IDEA requires that a “free appropriate public\neducation” (a “FAPE”) be made available to every disabled\nchild; a FAPE must be fashioned so as to accommodate an\nindividual child’s disability. See id. §§ 1401, 1412(a), 1414.\nTo make an adequate FAPE, local education agencies must\ndevelop an Individualized Education Program (an “IEP”) for\neach disabled child. See id. § 1414(d). An IEP consists of a\n\f                      SMITH V. LAUSD                         9\n\nwritten statement setting forth the special services and aids\nthe child needs to get a FAPE. See id. §§ 1401, 1414.\n\n      The IDEA also has a preference for integration of\ndisabled children in the general education schools. But such\nintegration must be beneficial to the disabled child, given the\nnature and severity of his disability. This preference is found\nin the IDEA’s “Least Restrictive Environment” (“LRE”)\nrequirement. It directs that a disabled child should attend\nregular classes with nondisabled children “[t]o the maximum\nextent appropriate.” Id. § 1412(a)(5); see also 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.114(a)(2)(i)–(ii); Cal. Ed. Code § 56364.2. At the\nsame time, however, the IDEA endorses the “removal of\nchildren with disabilities from the regular educational\nenvironment . . . when the nature or severity of the disability\n. . . is such that education in regular classes with the use of\nsupplementary aids and services cannot be achieved\nsatisfactorily.” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5); see also Poolaw v.\nBishop, 67 F.3d 830, 834 (9th Cir. 1995) (“In some cases,\nsuch as where the child’s handicap is particularly severe, it\nwill be impossible to provide any meaningful education to\nthe student in a mainstream environment.”).\n\n    Consistent with this framework, California law requires\neducators to maintain a “continuum of [special education]\nprogram options.” See Cal. Educ. Code § 56361. This\ncontinuum “include[s], but [is] not . . . limited to” full-time\nenrollment in “State special schools,” see Cal. Educ. Code\n§§ 56361(f); 56367—a term of art which includes “the\nCalifornia School for the Deaf,” Cal. Educ. Code § 59020,\nand “the California School for the Blind,” id. § 59120.\n\n    B. The Chanda Smith Litigation and Outcome 7\n\n     Appellants seek to intervene in a class action lawsuit\ninitiated in 1993 in the United States District Court for the\n\f10                        SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nCentral District of California by Chanda Smith, a disabled\nstudent then enrolled in LAUSD. The professed purpose of\nthat suit, brought on behalf of all similarly situated persons,\nwas “to bring the [LAUSD]’s special education program into\ncompliance with federal law.” The Chanda Smith plaintiffs\nsought a number of improvements in the provision of special\neducation, including, to name a few: (1) the centralization\nand computerization of all students’ records, (2) the\nprovision of regular training to administrators as to their\n“legal and professional obligations to students with\ndisabilities,” (3) the “[r]ecruiting and hiring [of] more\ncredentialed special education personnel,” and (4) the\nprovision of “a full continuum of special education and\nrelated services . . . [to] students with disabilities at sites as\nclose to the home of such students as possible.” That\n“continuum” was to include “all of the following”:\n(a) “General education classrooms with appropriate\nsupplemental supports and services”; (b) “A resource\nspecialist program”; (c) “Nonpublic, nonsectarian school\nservices”; and (d) “State special schools pursuant to\nCalifornia Education Code Section 56367,” among other\noptions. This class action culminated in a 1996 Consent\nDecree negotiated between Chanda Smith’s counsel (“Class\nCounsel”) 2 and LAUSD. The Consent Decree was framed\nin terms of general “recommendations” for improvements in\nareas such as those listed above, but lacked any quantifiable\nmeasurements by which to determine whether LAUSD\nshould be deemed in compliance with the parties’ settlement.\n     A few years later, Class Counsel sought and obtained\ncourt approval of a plan that imposed more objectively\n\n  2\n    Class Counsel are legal organizations with a self-professed\nideological interest in advancing the rights of disabled children and their\nfamilies.\n\f                        SMITH V. LAUSD                             11\n\nquantifiable targets on LAUSD (“Plan 12”). Among other\nthings, Plan 12 called for the effective elimination of special\neducation centers. 3 LAUSD appealed the district court’s\nruling approving Plan 12. In 2002 and while that appeal was\npending, parents of children then enrolled in special\neducation centers in LAUSD served Class Counsel with a\nmotion to intervene. The motion to intervene asserted that\nPlan 12’s elimination of special education centers violated\nthe IDEA’s “full continuum” requirement by eliminating an\nimportant placement option for disabled children.\n\n    Before that motion to intervene was filed with the district\ncourt, however, Class Counsel, LAUSD, and the would-be\nintervenors submitted their dispute to mediation. Class\nCounsel agreed to withdraw Plan 12. This mediation also\nled to the execution of a Modified Consent Decree (the\n“MCD”) in 2003, which reaffirmed “[t]he parties[’]\nagree[ment] that special education centers are part of the\ncontinuum of program options for a full continuum of\nspecial education and related services in the least restrictive\nenvironment.” MCD ¶ 47. In lieu of eliminating special\neducation centers, the MCD set forth an “Outcome 7.”\nOutcome 7 required the district to increase the percentage of\nstudents with disabilities aged 6 to 22, and who are to be\nplaced in the general education setting for 40 percent or more\nof the school day, from 29 percent to 52 percent by June 30,\n\n 3\n    Under Plan 12, disabled children could comprise no more than 15\npercent of any school’s population. Because special education centers\nare comprised heavily or wholly of disabled students, Plan 12’s 15\npercent limitation would have effectively eliminated special education\ncenters. The LAUSD objected to the plan by moving to modify and/or\nstay portions of the Consent Decree. The district court denied LAUSD’s\nmotion, which had the practical effect of approving Plan 12.\n\f12                       SMITH V. LAUSD\n\n2006. 4 Outcome 7 also limited to 48 percent those disabled\nstudents who were to spend more than 60 percent of the\ninstructional day in any of the following: (a) special\neducation classes at a general education facility, (b) a public\nspecial education center, (c) a non-public school with a\ncontract to provide special education services to LAUSD\nstudents (“Non-Public Schools”), or (d) a private residence\nor hospital learning environment. The MCD also established\nan “Independent Monitor” to oversee the LAUSD’s progress\nin meeting this and other Outcomes.\n\n    Because Outcome 7 was directed to increasing the\nintegration of disabled students in all four of the groups\nmaking up the 48 percent into LAUSD’s general education\nclasses, reduction of full-time enrollment of disabled\nstudents in special education centers was but one of many\nways LAUSD could achieve compliance with the MCD.\nIndeed, LAUSD necessarily had to look elsewhere than to\nspecial education centers to comply with Outcome 7—not\nonly because the MCD acknowledged the special education\ncenters as an important part of the continuum of educational\nservices available to disabled children, but also because\n\n 4\n    Notably, Outcome 7 excluded students with Specific Learning\nDisabilities (“SLD”) and “Speech and Language” Impediments (“SLI”),\nthe integration of whom was governed by Outcome 6 (which is not at\nissue in the present litigation). The SLD classification encompasses\nchildren with a “severe discrepancy between intellectual ability and\nachievement” in a particular area (such as “basic reading” or\nmathematics) due to “a disorder in one or more . . . basic psychological\nprocess[],” such as “attention” or “visual processing.” The SLI\nclassification encompasses children with speech impediments or\nlanguage fluency issues not due to unfamiliarity with English. See IEP\nEligibility, L.A. UNIFIED SCH. DIST. (last visited Jan. 25, 2016),\nhttp://achieve.lausd.net/Page/3346.\n\f                        SMITH V. LAUSD                              13\n\nenrollment in these centers accounted for a very small\npercentage of disabled student enrollment in LAUSD. 5\nBased on Class Counsel’s abandonment of its plan to\neliminate special education centers and the language in the\nMCD which specifically guaranteed their retention, the\nparent group agreed not to intervene.\n\n    LAUSD initially made significant progress towards\nOutcome 7. By September 2007, placement of disabled\nchildren included in Outcome 7 in general education classes\nfor at least 40 percent of the school day had increased from\n29 percent to 47 percent—though it turned out that this\nreported progress was somewhat inflated. 6 Declaration of\n\n 5\n    In 1998 (several years before the adoption of the Consent Decree)\nonly 5,298 of the roughly 80,000 students in LAUSD who received\nspecial education were enrolled in special education centers. By June\n24, 2012, enrollment in special education centers had fallen to 2,190—\nthough enrollment in Non-Public Schools increased over the same time\nperiod. Indeed, at least half the reduction in enrollment in special\neducation centers from 1998 to 2012 was offset by increased enrollment\nin Non-Public Schools, enrollment in which increased 47 percent\nbetween 1998 and 2012 (from 3,101 to 4,552).\n 6\n     A review of students’ actual class schedules revealed that\nadministrators were “overestimat[ing]” the time disabled students were\nspending in general education classes in order to create the appearance\nthat these targets were being met. See, e.g., Independent Monitor’s\nAnnual Report for the 2008–2009 School Year. Indeed, the Independent\nMonitor’s September 29, 2010 report noted three years of “increasing[]\noverestimat[ion] [of] the number and percentage of students in the\ngeneral education setting for 40% or more of the day.” (The Independent\nMonitor’s Annual Report for the 2009–2010 School Year explained: “As\nnoted in previous reports, a primary contributing factor to these\ndiscrepancies is that schools appear to be entering a percent of time\nbelow 60% in special education without regard or consideration of the\nstudent’s [actual] class schedule.”). See also Independent Monitor’s\nAnnual Report for the 2010–2011 School Year (stating the same).\n\f14                    SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nFrederick J. Weintraub (“Weintraub”), the Independent\nMonitor, ¶ 7. But as the pool of disabled students included\nin Outcome 7 who spent most or all of their day outside\ngeneral education classes and schools dwindled, it became\nincreasingly difficult for LAUSD to identify students for\nwhom greater integration was possible and beneficial.\n\n    Difficulties complying with Outcome 7 led to renewed\nnegotiations in September 2008 between Class Counsel, the\nLAUSD, and the Independent Monitor, who ultimately\nadopted a two-part modification to Outcome 7 (termed\n“Outcome 7A” and “Outcome 7B,” or collectively,\n“Modified Outcome 7”). Weintraub Decl. ¶¶ 8, 9. Modified\nOutcome 7 reduced the integration targets imposed by\noriginal Outcome 7 by exempting from compliance disabled\nstudents aged 18 to 22 and significantly reducing the\npercentage of students with orthopedic disabilities who were\nrequired to attend general education classes.\n\n     LAUSD remained unable to meet Outcome 7, even as\nmodified. The Independent Monitor ultimately concluded in\nits February 17, 2012 report that meeting Modified Outcome\n7 “would require the arbitrary transfer of a significant\nnumber of . . . students” from special education centers to\ngeneral education campuses, an approach the Independent\nMonitor had never endorsed, see, e.g., Independent\nMonitor’s Annual Report for the 2010–2011 School Year\n(“As noted in past reports, . . . [efforts to integrate special\neducation students as required by Outcome 7] should be in\nthe best interest of the student and not solely motivated by\nprogress on this [integration] outcome.”).\n\n   Commencing in October 2011, yet another round of\nnegotiations between the parties and the Independent\nMonitor ensued. This led to an amendment to the MCD\nmemorialized in a stipulation executed September 14, 2012\n\f                          SMITH V. LAUSD                              15\n\n(“Renegotiated Outcome 7”). Renegotiated Outcome 7\nprovided that LAUSD would be deemed fully compliant\nwith Modified Outcome 7 if it accomplished two new goals:\n(a) a flat 33 percent decrease in special education center\nenrollment by June 2015; 7 and (b) integration of all\n“[s]tudents with moderate to severe disabilities at co-located\nschools” into “general education classes an average of 12%\nof the instructional day and during lunch, breaks/recess and\nschool-wide activities.” 8 As described in detail below, the\nimplementation of Renegotiated Outcome 7 in the 2013–14\nschool year brought substantial changes to the educational\nopportunities afforded children who attended (or sought to\nattend) special education centers in 2012. By 2014, over 8\nof LAUSD’s 18 special education centers had been closed to\n\n 7\n    This would represent a reduction of approximately 650 disabled\nstudents from schooling in special education centers, based on June 2012\nenrollment statistics.\n\n 8\n    We remain unable to decipher the precise meaning of “co-located”—\nan amorphous term used by LAUSD in 2012 and 2013 to describe its\nimplementation of Renegotiated Outcome 7. At times, LAUSD used the\nword “co-located” in lieu of “closed” to refer to a special education\ncenter which has undergone the physical transfer of all its students and\nresources from the special education center to a general education school\n(e.g., with respect to the closure of Blend Special Education Center for\nthe Blind). At other times, “co-located” was used to describe special\neducation centers that shared a physical border with a general education\ncampus (e.g., in the case of Banneker Special Education Center). By\n2014, LAUSD interpreted Renegotiated Outcome 7’s requirement that\nstudents at “co-located schools” spend an average of 12 percent of their\nday in general education classes as applying to disabled students at 13 of\nLAUSD’s 18 special education centers. Sometimes this meant the\ncomplete closure of a special education center; other times it meant the\ntransfer of disabled students to a general education school for some part\nor all of the school day.\n\f16                        SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nenrollment to disabled children under the age of 18. Parents\nof affected students were not invited to participate in the\nLAUSD/Class Counsel/Independent Monitor negotiations,\nwhich commenced in October 2011, supra p.14, nor were\ntheir viewpoints solicited in the negotiation, adoption, or\nimplementation phases of Renegotiated Outcome 7. 9\n\n    LAUSD did not start notifying parents of children\naffected by Renegotiated Outcome 7, or provide any\ninformation as to how it intended to accomplish\nRenegotiated Outcome 7’s dual mandates, until Spring 2013.\nAs explained below, LAUSD’s notice varied significantly,\nbut bore certain common themes.\n\n    Appellants whose children had attended Blend Special\nEducation Center for the Blind (“Blend”) were generally told\nduring individual parent IEP meetings in Spring 2013 that\nplacement at Blend (or any other special education center)\nwas no longer an option for their child; the Blend faculty and\nstudent body was being relocated in its entirety to a general\neducation school.\n\n    About the same time, parents of children attending\nBanneker Special Education Center (“Banneker”) were told\nthat their school would be “co-located” with Avalon Gardens\nElementary (“Avalon Gardens”), a general education\ncampus, starting in the 2013–14 school year. At the\n\n 9\n    In fact, the Independent Monitor’s reports treated parental resistance\nto increased placement of severely disabled students on general\neducation campuses as an obstacle to be overcome. See, e.g.,\nIndependent Monitor’s Annual Report for the 2010–2011 School Year\n(instructing that “the District is encouraged to continue its work with\nfamilies to explore existing and new classes on general education\ncampuses. While families may resist, it is important they be exposed to\noptions available outside of special education centers”).\n\f                          SMITH V. LAUSD                               17\n\ncommencement of the 2013 school year, parents learned that\nthis meant that students enrolled in Banneker would be\ntransported to Avalon Gardens for an average of 12 percent\nof their instructional day for “integration activities.” In\nFebruary 2014 (after the motion to intervene at issue in this\ncase was filed), Banneker parents learned that LAUSD\nwould be closing Banneker altogether and relocating its\nstudent body to Avalon Gardens starting in the 2014–15\nschool year. See Mina Lee Request for Judicial Notice (“Lee\nRJN”), Exh. A (Feb. 14, 2014 letter), Exh. E (March 21,\n2014 letter from LAUSD explaining that Banneker, which,\namong other things, had offered one of the district’s primary\n“mentally retarded severe” (“MRS”) programs for school-\naged special education children, was being transitioned into\na Career Transition Center, a school that teaches vocational\nand basic living skills to young adults aged 18 to 22). 10\n\n\n\n  10\n     Both sets of Appellants have requested this court take judicial notice\nof various letters created and sent by the executive director of LAUSD\nto Appellants, as well as annual reports issued by the Independent\nMonitor. Both the letters and the reports summarize LAUSD’s progress\nin implementing Renegotiated Outcome 7, and both post-date\nAppellants’ motions to intervene, so it would have been impossible for\nAppellants to have included such letters and reports in support of their\noriginal motions. LAUSD does not dispute the authenticity or veracity\nof any of these documents. Cf. Fed. R. Evid. 201 (courts may take\njudicial notice of facts only if their veracity “cannot reasonably be\nquestioned”). Moreover, courts routinely take judicial notice of letters\npublished by the government (and here, the executive director of\nLAUSD was a government employee), see, e.g., Cactus Corner, LLC v.\nU.S. Dept. of Agriculture, 346 F.Supp.2d 1075 (E.D. Cal. 2004), as well\nas “records and reports of administrative bodies,” see Interstate Natural\nGas Co. v. S. Cal. Gas. Co., 209 F.2d 380, 385 (9th Cir. 1953). We\ntherefore find Appellants’ documents can be judicially noticed and grant\nAppellants’ motions for judicial notice.\n\f18                    SMITH V. LAUSD\n\n    Notice to parents of disabled children attending\nLanterman Special Education Center (“Lanterman”) took\nthe form of a field “trip slip” that was circulated to parents\nin the Fall of 2013—about a year after the adoption of\nRenegotiated Outcome 7. The “trip slip” purported to seek\ntemporary authorization to transport Lanterman students to\na general education school for an integration “test.”\nAppellants have offered evidence that LAUSD used the field\ntrip slips to justify the permanent and daily transportation of\nLanterman students to general education classes.\n\n   Affidavits submitted by parents of children who were\npreviously enrolled full-time at Lull Special Education\nCenter, Lokrantz Special Education Center, and McBride\nSpecial Education Center contain accounts similar to those\ndescribed by Blend and Banneker parents.\n\n     Aside from the different types of individualized notice\nrelated above, Executive Director of Special Education in\nLAUSD, Sharyn Howell, circulated a letter on May 21, 2013\nto the “LAUSD Community” (the “Howell Letter”),\nannouncing that Modified Outcome 7 had been again\nrenegotiated on September 14, 2012 and that, as a result, a\n“reduc[tion] [in] the number of students with moderate to\nsevere disabilities ages 6–18 at segregated special education\ncenters” would occur. The Howell Letter indicated that four\nspecial education centers (Banneker, Blend, McBride, and\nMiller) would be affected in the 2013–14 school year. The\nletter further explained that all pre-school-aged special\neducation students would be sent to general education\nschools, rather than to special education centers. See Aguilar\nDecl. ¶ 7 (noting declining enrollment in several special\neducation centers as a result of the district’s new policy\nagainst permitting new student enrollment); see also Berrios\nDecl. ¶¶ 6–7 (stating the same).\n\f                         SMITH V. LAUSD                              19\n\n    As the Howell Letter indicated, 2013 was a year of great\nchanges. Even those Proposed Intervenors who received\nnotice through IEP meetings in Spring 2013 that their\nchildren would receive “integration opportunities” in the\ncoming school year were left uncertain as to the actual\neffects on them of Renegotiated Outcome 7. See, e.g., J.\nFlores Decl. ¶ 9. Many parents, particularly those for whom\nEnglish is a second language, were incorrectly led to believe\nthat the services and curriculum offered their children would\nremain the same despite the transfer to a new school. See,\ne.g., J. Flores Decl. ¶ 12; A. Flores Decl. ¶ 4; Lee Decl. ¶ 6;\nChamu Decl. ¶¶ 4–5. Many parents claim simply not to have\nappreciated the effects of the changes until their children\nbegan coming home after school with bruises and other\ninjuries in late August and September of 2013—injuries\nAppellants’ children suffered while in general education\nschools. See, e.g., J. Flores Decl. ¶ 11; A. Flores Decl. ¶ 6;\nHernandez Decl. ¶¶ 3–4; Chamu Decl. ¶ 6; Hernandez Decl.,\nExh. E (photographs of injuries); J. Flores Decl., Exh. C\n(photographs of injuries). Parents also discovered in Fall\n2013 that the general education campuses to which their\nchildren (and over 500 other moderately to severely disabled\nchildren) were being transferred had not been adapted,\nthrough tangible construction alterations, to provide a safe\nand effective learning environment, as memorialized in the\nIndependent Monitor’s October 2014 Report. See Munoz\nRJN, Exh. 1, p. 4.11\n\n\n 11\n    Much of the necessary alteration was not scheduled to start until the\nsummer of 2015. The Independent Monitor’s report following the 2013–\n14 school year also noted a number of “questionable” planning decisions\nthat seemed unlikely to safeguard the health and safety of disabled\nstudents even after renovations were completed. Id. For example, areas\ndesignated for “[diaper] changing, feeding and health care protocols”\n\f20                       SMITH V. LAUSD\n\n    These discoveries came shortly after small group\nmeetings between Stephen Maseda (who became counsel to\nthe Mina Lee Proposed Intervenors), April Munoz (an\nAppellant), unspecified LAUSD board members, Howell,\nthe Independent Monitor, and Class Counsel on August 2\nand 5, 2013, respectively. Maseda Decl. ¶¶ 10–13; Munoz\nDecl. Munoz and Maseda concluded that neither LAUSD\nnor Class Counsel represented their interests or believed that\nspecial education centers should be a part of the continuum\nof special education opportunities available to disabled\nchildren in LAUSD.\n\n    On October 15, 2013, and October 23, 2013, seventy-one\nand seventy-nine days after concluding their interests were\nnot being represented by LAUSD or Class Counsel,\nrespectively, two groups of parents (the April Munoz\nProposed Intervenors and the Mina Lee Proposed\nIntervenors) moved to intervene “individually and on behalf\nof all other persons similarly situated” as a matter of right,\nsee Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 24(a), or, in the alternative, under Rule\n24(b) (permissive intervention). Appellants’ cases were\nconsolidated, and the district court denied both motions on\nJanuary 16, 2014. The court rejected Appellants’ Rule 24(a)\nmotion to intervene as a matter of right as untimely or,\n\n\n\n“were located inside classrooms that lacked running water and\ndrainage”; special education classrooms were placed “over 350 feet”\nfrom bathrooms scheduled to be renovated to accommodate disabled\nchildren; the placement of bus drop-offs and lunch areas required blind\nchildren “to navigate slopes, uneven steps, tripping hazards and\nprotruding objects” to get to class; visually impaired children were also\nplaced in “an isolated part of the campus with inaccessible bathrooms.”\nId.

Standard of Review\n\n    Appellants appeal the denial of their motion to intervene\nas a matter of right pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2). An applicant\nfor intervention under Rule 24(a)(2) must establish four\nelements: (1) that the prospective intervenor’s motion is\n“timely”; (2) that the would-be intervenor has “a\n‘significantly protectable’ interest relating to . . . the subject\nof the action,” (3) that the intervenor is “so situated that the\ndisposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or\nimpede [the intervenor’s] ability to protect that interest”; and\n(4) that such interest is “inadequately represented by the\nparties to the action.” Freedom from Religion Found., Inc.\nv. Geithner, 644 F.3d 836, 841 (9th Cir. 2011) [hereinafter\n“FFRF”]. Though the applicant bears the burden of\nestablishing these elements, we have repeatedly instructed\nthat “the requirements for intervention are [to be] broadly\ninterpreted in favor of intervention.” United States v. Alisal\nWater Corp., 370 F.3d 915, 919 (9th Cir. 2004); see also\nWilderness Soc. v. U.S. Forest Serv., 630 F.3d 1173, 1179\n(9th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (noting that “[a] liberal policy in\nfavor of intervention serves both efficient resolution of\nissues and broadened access to the courts” (quoting United\n\n\n 12\n     The court also rejected Appellant Rule 24(b) motion for permissive\nintervention as untimely. In the alternative, it “exercise[d] its discretion\nto deny” permission intervention on the grounds that it would prejudice\nexisting parties and “open the floodgates to additional proposed\nintervenors.”\n\f22                     SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nStates v. City of Los Angeles, 288 F.3d 391, 397–98 (9th Cir.\n2002) (alteration in original)).\n\n     A lower court’s denial of a motion to intervene is\nreviewed de novo, except that its timeliness determination is\nreviewed for abuse of discretion. Alisal, 370 F.3d at 918–\n19. A court abuses its discretion if it fails to apply the correct\nlegal rule or standard. United States v. Hinkson, 585 F.3d\n1247, 1262 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc). And even “[i]f the trial\ncourt identified the correct legal rule,” we may find an abuse\nof discretion if the court’s application of that rule was\n“(1) illogical, (2) implausible, or (3) without support in\ninferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.”\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                        B. Timeliness\n\n    Timeliness is determined by the totality of the\ncircumstances facing would-be intervenors, with a focus on\nthree primary factors: “(1) the stage of the proceeding at\nwhich an applicant seeks to intervene; (2) the prejudice to\nother parties; and (3) the reason for and length of the delay.”\nAlisal Water, 370 F.3d at 921. In analyzing these factors,\nhowever, courts should bear in mind that “[t]he crucial date\nfor assessing the timeliness of a motion to intervene is when\nproposed intervenors should have been aware that their\ninterests would not be adequately protected by the existing\nparties.” Smith v. Marsh, 194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.\n1999). As explained below, the district court’s analysis did\nnot follow this basic principle. We accordingly hold that the\ncourt abused its discretion in finding Appellants’ motions\nuntimely under the totality of the circumstances of this case.\n\f                      SMITH V. LAUSD                        23\n\n                1. Stage of the Proceedings\n\n    It is true that Appellants seek to intervene in this action\napproximately twenty years after its commencement, and\nseventeen years after the adoption of the first Consent\nDecree.       However, in analyzing the “stage of the\nproceedings” factor, the “[m]ere lapse of time alone is not\ndeterminative.” United States v. State of Oregon, 745 F.2d\n550, 552 (9th Cir. 1984). Where a change of circumstances\noccurs, and that change is the “major reason” for the motion\nto intervene, the stage of proceedings factor should be\nanalyzed by reference to the change in circumstances, and\nnot the commencement of the litigation. See id.\n\n    We previously applied this rule in State of Oregon,\nwhere the State of Idaho moved to intervene in litigation\nbetween the States of Washington and Oregon and various\nIndian Tribes, fifteen years after the commencement of that\naction in 1968, and five years after a settlement had been\nreached in 1977. Id. at 551–52. Notwithstanding the\nsubstantial lapse in time, we held that the “stage of\nproceedings” factor supported a finding of timeliness\nbecause a “change of circumstance” had occurred in 1982—\ntwo Indian tribes had given “notice of their intent to\nwithdraw from the [settlement] or to renegotiate it” which\ncreated “the possibility of new and expanded negotiations.”\nId. at 552. We concluded that this change in circumstances\nweighed in favor of a finding that the State of Idaho’s August\n1983 motion to intervene was timely. Id. at 552–53 (holding\nthat the district court abused its discretion in denying the\nmotion to intervene as untimely).\n\n    Here, the district court’s conclusory determination that\nRenegotiated Outcome 7 did not constitute a change in\ncircumstances because it “appears to be just another\n\f24                        SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nmodification to the MCD aimed at further integration,” was\ncontrary to any plausible interpretation of the record.\nPerhaps viewed as a progression towards “integration,”\nRenegotiated Outcome 7 represented only “another step” in\nLAUSD’s march toward the goal of greater integration of\ndisabled children in LAUSD’s schools; attempts—some\nsuccessful, some not—toward integration had been\noccurring since the adoption of the original Consent Decree.\nBut the record demonstrates that Renegotiated Outcome 7\ncaused a substantial change in the educational opportunities\nafforded the group of disabled students of the LAUSD who\nattended special education centers prior to 2013—namely,\nthe group now seeking to intervene.\n\n    From 1993 to 2012, LAUSD operated approximately 18\nspecial education centers throughout the school district, and\nit offered full-time placement at those schools for children\nwhose IEPs so recommended. During that time, the\nplacement of these students (including, at times, the transfer\nof a student from a special education center to a general\neducation school) was conducted through case-by-case\nassessments of individual students, by IEP teams and with\nparental involvement and consent; indeed, parents retained\nsome influence over, and input into, their child’s placement,\nincluding the opportunity to object during the IEP process to\ntheir child’s removal from a special education center. 13 See,\n\n\n 13\n     For example, the Independent Monitor’s 2010-11 Report indicated\nthat, of the “95 children identified as potential students to transition”\nfrom special education centers to general education campuses, only 27\nwere actually transferred. The Independent Monitor attributed the low\ntransfer rate to parental resistance to the removal of their children from\nspecial education centers.\n\f                          SMITH V. LAUSD                              25\n\ne.g., Efron Decl. ¶¶ 34–36; Gliona Decl. ¶¶ 6, 8, 10;\nAyapana Decl. ¶¶ 4–5.\n\n    Since Renegotiated Outcome 7, however, severely\ndisabled children have been transferred en masse to general\neducation campuses, over parental objections. At least 8 of\nthe 18 special education centers have been closed to\nenrollment by Appellants and similarly situated disabled\nstudents. 14 Appellants have offered evidence that parents\nare not consulted in the development of their child’s IEP.\nRather, they are told that placement in a special education\ncenter is no longer an option. If they disagree with a\npredetermined placement, their only recourse is to file an\nadministrative appeal. See, e.g., Maseda Decl. ¶ 7; Lee Decl.\n¶ 4; J. Flores Decl. ¶ 13; A. Flores Decl. ¶ 4; Gliona Decl.\n\n 14\n     As discussed above, Blend Special Education Center for the Blind\nwas the first special education center to close. LAUSD disputes that the\ntransfer of all students, teachers, assistants, and curriculum materials\nfrom a special education center to a general education campus constitutes\nthe “closure” of a special education center. We reject this slight on the\nmeaning of words. For all practical purposes, the complete transfer of\nstudents, teaching staff, and resources from a school is a closure of that\nschool, at least as to those students and that teaching staff. Moreover,\nletters prepared by LAUSD demonstrate that at least seven more special\neducation centers have followed suit: A letter dated March 3, 2014 from\nLAUSD to parents of students at Lull Special Education Center\nexplained that the school’s “teachers, assistants and classroom materials”\nwould be “relocated to Northridge Middle School,” a general education\nschool. Lee RJN, Exh. B. A letter dated March 21, 2014 (again, from\nthe school district) announced that at the commencement of the 2014–15\nschool year six more of LAUSD’s remaining special education centers\n(Banneker, Salvin, Willenberg, Marlton, Leichman, and Perez) would be\nconverted into “Career Transition Centers.” Lee RJN, Exh. E (also\nexplaining that “[t]his transition means that our 7–11 graders will be\nrelocated to other campuses”). As noted, Career Transition Centers are\nschools that teach children ages 18 to 22 basic job and independent living\nskills.\n\f26                        SMITH V. LAUSD\n\n¶¶ 8–9, 11, 15–17; Goldberg Decl. ¶ 4. Starting in 2013,\nLAUSD began conducting individual student and parent IEP\nmeetings with an attorney present. See Gliona Decl. ¶ 8;\nGliona Decl. ¶ 7. Whereas the 2003 MCD had stated that\nspecial education centers were an important part of the\n“continuum” of educational opportunities available to\ndisabled children, LAUSD Executive Director of Special\nEducation, Sharyn Howell, has now taken the position that\nspecial education centers are unnecessary because the\ndistrict can “provide all supports and services . . . at a general\neducation site.” Howell Decl. ¶ 4.\n\n    Additionally, the record indicates that most, if not all,\nstudents formerly enrolled full-time in special education\ncenters (regardless of whether their schools have been\nclosed) are now required to spend an average of 12 percent\nof their instructional day in general education classes—most\nfrequently physical education, music, theater, and art\nclasses. This curriculum change has been imposed on\nstudents whose individual IEPs previously recommended\nfull-time placement in a special education center. 15\n\n   In short, if the “possibility” of negotiations constituted a\nchange of circumstances in State of Oregon, then LAUSD’s\n\n 15\n     For example, J.R.C. is blind, cannot communicate verbally, and is\nseverely developmentally delayed; yet starting in the 2013–14 school\nyear, he was required to attend “integrated” physical education classes\nover his parents’ objection that such integration is not safe. Chamu Decl.\n¶ 9; see also Gliona Decl. ¶ 5 (offering a comparison of J.R.C.’s IEP with\nthe State of California’s standards for the general education classes in\nwhich J.R.C. is now enrolled, and asserting that general education\nclasses are incompatible with any reasonable reading of J.R.C.’s IEP).\nTo give another example, S.L., who is blind and deaf, is required to\nattend general education music and physical education classes pursuant\nto Renegotiated Outcome 7. Lee Decl. ¶ 5; see also Fazzi Decl. ¶ 7.\n\f                           SMITH V. LAUSD                                27\n\nadoption of a flat quota requiring the reduction of special\neducation center enrollment by 33 percent, since it has led to\nan overhaul of LAUSD’s approach to educating its\nmoderately to severely disabled students enrolled in special\neducation centers in LAUSD, is all the more so a “change in\ncircumstances,” at least as to Appellants.\n\n    As in State of Oregon, the adoption of Renegotiated\nOutcome 7 in 2012 marked the commencement of a “new\nstage” in the Chanda Smith Litigation. For purposes of the\n“stage of proceedings” analysis, it is critical that Appellants\nhave moved to intervene to challenge only Renegotiated\nOutcome 7 and the manner by which it has been\nimplemented—in other words, the most current stage of the\nChanda Smith Litigation. Appellants are not seeking to\nreopen decades of litigation. Thus, it was error to measure\nthe timeliness of Appellants’ motions by reference to stages\nof litigation pre-dating the change in circumstances that\nmotivated Appellants’ motion to intervene. See, e.g.,\nNatural Resources Defense Council v. Costle, 561 F.2d 904,\n907 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (cited with approval in State of Oregon,\n745 F.2d at 552) (“[T]he amount of time which has elapsed\nsince the litigation began is not in itself the determinative\ntest of timeliness. Rather, the court should also look to the\nrelated circumstances, including the purpose for which\nintervention is sought . . . .” (first alteration in original)). 16\n\n  16\n     In Costle, the Natural Resources Defense Council sued the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and successfully negotiated\na settlement whereby the EPA was required to establish regulations\ngoverning water pollution. Id. at 906. Rubber and chemical companies\nsought to intervene at the time of settlement to participate in the oversight\nand implementation of the settlement agreement. Id. at 907. The\nappellate court held that the district court had abused its discretion in\ndenying the companies’ Rule 24(a)(2) motion to intervene, because the\n\f28                        SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nIn failing to analyze timeliness in light of the change in\ncircumstances detailed above, the district court abused its\ndiscretion by failing to apply the correct legal rule. See\nHinkson, 585 F.3d at 1262.\n\n    Our holding that Renegotiated Outcome 7 constituted a\n“change in circumstances” is confined to the specific facts\nof this case. The systematic change in circumstances that\noccurred here, coupled with the fact that (as discussed\nfurther below), Appellants moved to intervene as soon as\nreasonably practicable following such change, serves to\ndistinguish the present case from the sole authority cited by\nthe district court, Delaware Valley Citizens’ Council for\nClean Air v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 674 F.2d 970,\n974–75 (3d Cir. 1982). 17\n\n\npurpose of the intervenors’ motion related to the current stage of the\nproceedings and was therefore timely, notwithstanding appellants’ three-\nyear delay in moving to intervene since the commencement of the\nlitigation. Id. at 906–08.\n\n 17\n     In Delaware Valley, a group of Pennsylvania state legislators sought\nto intervene in a high-profile lawsuit against the State of Pennsylvania\nand various state entities to compel the passage of legislation related to\nautomobile emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. Id. at 971–72. They\ndid so almost two years after the execution of a consent decree requiring\nthe passage of emissions legislation. Id. Though the Third Circuit did\nnot give precise dates, it reasoned that the legislators were or should have\nbeen on notice of the suit, and the consent decree, well before they\nmoved to intervene. Id. at 974–75 (explaining that one prospective\nintervenor had even proposed legislation pursuant to the consent decree).\nThe court found the sole justification offered for the legislators’ delay—\nthat they were “busy”—insufficient. Id. at 975. The court further\nrejected the legislators’ argument that their motion was timely simply\nbecause it was filed 45 days after the first modification to the consent\ndecree. Id. at 974. The court reasoned that the modification did not make\nthe motion timely because “none of the circumstances or facts upon\n\f                          SMITH V.

Prejudice to Other Parties\n\n    We have previously held that prejudice to existing\nparties is “the most important consideration in deciding\nwhether a motion for intervention is untimely.” State of\nOregon, 745 F.2d at 552. We have also recognized that\ncourts may find prejudice on the basis of non-monetary\nfactors: For example, if granting a belated motion to\nintervene would threaten the delicate balance reached by\nexisting parties after protracted negotiations, this factor may\nweigh against intervention. See, e.g., Cty. of Orange v. Air\nCal., 799 F.2d 535, 538 (9th Cir. 1986). However, we\nemphasized in State of Oregon that the only “prejudice” that\nis relevant under this factor is that which flows from a\nprospective intervenor’s failure to intervene after he knew,\nor reasonably should have known, that his interests were not\nbeing adequately represented—and not from the fact that\nincluding another party in the case might make resolution\nmore “difficult[].” 745 F.2d at 552–53; see also Stallworth\nv. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257, 267 (5th Cir. 1977) (“With\nrespect to the second factor, the district court again applied\nan incorrect legal standard. For the purpose of determining\nwhether an application for intervention is timely, the\nrelevant issue is not how much prejudice would result from\n\n\nwhich appellants base their claim for relief have changed since the\n[unmodified] consent decree was entered.” Id. at 975. Moreover, the\nproposed intervenors were not seeking to intervene to challenge the\nmodification, but rather sought to “scrap[]” the original consent decree\nitself. Id. Under the totality of these circumstances, the Third Circuit\nconcluded, the district court had not abused its discretion in denying the\nlegislators’ motion to intervene as untimely. Id.\n\f30                   SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nallowing intervention, but rather how much prejudice would\nresult from the would-be intervenor’s failure to request\nintervention as soon as he knew or should have known of his\ninterest in the case.”).\n\n     In State of Oregon, various Indian tribes and the States\nof Washington and Oregon argued that permitting the State\nof Idaho to intervene in litigation fifteen years after the\ncommencement of the litigation regarding the regulation of\nfishing would jeopardize the existing parties’ negotiations.\n745 F.2d at 552–53. We rejected this argument. We found\nno prejudice because “the existing parties’ concerns have\nlittle to do with timeliness. They do not suggest that their\nproblems are materially different now than they would have\nbeen had Idaho sought to intervene a decade or more ago.”\nId. at 553. We therefore reversed the lower court’s denial of\nthe State of Idaho’s motion to intervene. Id.\n\n    As in State of Oregon, the district court’s finding of\nprejudice here was untethered to any prejudice which was\ncaused by Appellants’ delay. The district court reasoned that\npermitting intervention “would prolong the litigation,”\nbecause it would “upset the delicate balance the Parties and\nthe Independent Monitor have sought and achieved through\ncareful negotiation and research” in devising Renegotiated\nOutcome 7 (chronicling the lengthy negotiations of\nRenegotiated Outcome 7 between Class Counsel, the\nIndependent Monitor, and Dr. David Rostetter, a special\neducation expert, which culminated in Renegotiated\nOutcome 7). But this is merely an argument that permitting\nthe parties who concluded they were detrimentally affected\nin 2013 by Renegotiated Outcome 7 to participate in its\nnegotiation and implementation would make achieving\nresolution more difficult, given the parties’ competing\ninterests. Because this would be true regardless of when the\n\f                         SMITH V. LAUSD                              31\n\nintervention occurred, it is unrelated to timeliness, and\ncannot support a finding of prejudice under State of Oregon.\n\n    The district court also cited LAUSD’s expenditure of\nresources in transferring special education students,\nprograms, and resources to general education schools and\ncampuses. That would be relevant had Appellants failed to\nact in the face of reasonable notice from LAUSD of its plans\nto close special education centers en masse and had LAUSD\ninvested significant resources in reliance on that delay. Cf.\nSmith v. Marsh, 194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir. 1999) (“The\ncrucial date for assessing the timeliness of a motion to\nintervene is when proposed intervenors should have been\naware that their interests would not be adequately protected\nby the existing parties.”).\n\n     But that is not what happened here. LAUSD parents\nwere excluded from the negotiations that led to the adoption\nof Renegotiated Outcome 7 in September 2012. And in the\nyear between the adoption of Renegotiated Outcome 7 and\nits initial implementation in August 2013, Appellants were\nconsistently uninformed or misinformed as to the existence\nand true effects of Renegotiated Outcome 7. 18 The Fifth\nCircuit has recognized, and we agree, that existing parties\ncannot complain about delay or prejudice caused by their\n\n  18\n     Some parents were told that the district was merely changing the\nname of their child’s school. Others were more accurately told that their\nchild would be transferred to a general education school or campus, but\nassured that their child’s curriculum would remain the same in all\nrespects. Of course, neither of these statements were accurate given the\nnew requirement that special education center students be “integrated”\nin general education classes for lunch, recess, and 12 percent of the\ninstructional day. Nor did these statements reasonably put Appellants on\nnotice that LAUSD would be outright closing eight special education\ncenters by the end of 2014.\n\f32                         SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nown efforts to thwart the provision of meaningful notice to\naffected parties. See Stallworth, 558 F.2d at 267 (holding\nthat a district court abused its discretion in finding a motion\nto intervene untimely where an existing party had previously\nprevented notice to affected parties).\n\n     That principle has particular application here, where the\nconsequences of Renegotiated Outcome 7 were uniquely\nwithin LAUSD’s knowledge and control, given that LAUSD\nwas its implementing party. Instead of clearly apprising\naffected parents as to how LASUD intended to implement\nthe changes precipitated by Renegotiated Outcome 7,\nLAUSD issued incomplete information throughout 2013.\nAs a result, the full extent of Renegotiated Outcome 7 was\nnot revealed until 2014 and 2015—well after Appellants’\nfiling in Fall 2013 of the supposedly untimely motion to\nintervene at issue in this appeal. 19\n\n\n\n  19\n     To illustrate, the first district-wide notice of Renegotiated Outcome\n7, the Howell Letter circulated on May 21, 2013, indicated that the\ndistrict would be developing “integration plans” to “co-locate[]” four\nspecial education centers (Banneker, Blend, McBride, and Miller) with\nfour “general education pioneer counterparts (Avalon Gardens, Van\nNess, Grand View, and Cleveland SH, respectively).” It described in\nglowing terms the district’s plans to offer integration “opportunit[ies]”\nthrough “arts,” “physical education,” and “social activities . . . to\nincrease the integration of . . . students with disabilities.” Critically, it\npromised that LAUSD would be “working with school site staff and\nfamilies to analyze the Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) of\nstudents with disabilities to determine how to most effectively increase\nthe integration of students based on their individual needs.” (emphasis\nadded). Nowhere does the May 2013 letter indicate that, just one year\nlater, LAUSD would be closing approximately half of its special\neducation centers, without any prior “working with . . . families.”\n\f                          SMITH V. LAUSD                               33\n\n     When our inquiry is properly narrowed to the prejudice\nattributable to Appellants’ delay in moving to intervene after\nthe time Appellants knew, or reasonably should have known,\nthat their interests were not being adequately represented by\nexisting parties, the prejudice to existing parties becomes\nnominal at best. Indeed, neither the district court nor\nLAUSD has pointed to any evidence whatsoever of\nadditional costs or other prejudice suffered between August\n2013 and October 2013. The district court accordingly\nabused its discretion in concluding that this factor weighed\nagainst intervention.\n\n   3. Reason for and Length of the Intervenor’s Delay\n\n    For the reasons already explained above, the district\ncourt erred to the extent it measured the length of\nAppellants’ delay by reference to events pre-dating the time\nat which Proposed Intervenors were reasonably on notice\n\n\n     The rhetoric used in the May 2013 letter can be sharply contrasted\nwith the notice provided to parents in 2014—notably, after the motion to\nintervene at issue in this appeal was filed. Letters sent to parents of\nstudents at various special education centers in February of 2014, for\nexample, state that all the “teachers, assistants and classroom materials\nare expected to re-locate” from various special education centers to\ngeneral education campuses. See Lee RJN Exh. A (Letter to Banneker\nparents); see also id. Exh. B (Letter to parents of students attending Lull\nSpecial Education Center); Exh. C (Letter to parents of students\nattending Perez Special Education Center); Exh. E (Letter to parents of\nBanneker and Doyle special education centers, explaining that “[t]he\ndistrict . . . has decided to continue transitioning the Special Education\nSchools to Career Transition Centers. For the 2014–2015 school year,\nthe Special Education Schools becoming Career Transition Centers are:\nBanneker, Salvin, Willenberg, Marlton, Leichman, and Perez . . . . This\ntransition means that our 7–11 graders will be relocated to other\ncampuses.”). Whatever “co-location” was supposed to mean, see supra,\nn.8 that term had served its purpose; by 2014, it disappeared.\n\f34                    SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nthat their interests were not being adequately represented,\nsee Smith, 194 F.3d at 1052—and certainly to the extent the\ncourt relied on events predating the change in circumstances\nthat prompted Appellants’ current motion to intervene. In\nState of Oregon, for example, the “changed circumstances”\ngiving rise to the motion to intervene occurred “in 1982\nwhen two of the Tribes gave notice of their intent to\nwithdraw from the Plan or to renegotiate it.” State of\nOregon, 745 F.2d at 552. Yet the proposed intervenors did\nnot file until late August 1983. Id. Despite at least an eight-\nmonth delay (the opinion is not clear as to when in 1982 the\ntribes gave the notice referenced above nor when the State\nof Idaho received that notice), we held that the “reason for\nand length of delay” factor weighed in favor of intervention.\nId.     Similarly here, Appellants moved to intervene\napproximately one year after the change in circumstances\nprompting their motion but, as discussed below, only weeks\nafter definitively learning that their interests were not\nadequately represented by the existing parties.\n\n    Here, not only was the district court’s analysis contrary\nto law, it was contrary to the record before the court. For\nexample, the district court concluded that Appellants\n“arguably have been on notice from the very beginning of\nthis litigation.” But how can that be true when many of the\nProposed Intervenors’ children had not even been born at the\ninception of the litigation, let alone been born disabled?\n\n    The district court alternatively suggested that Proposed\nIntervenors have been on notice of this action since 2002,\nwhen a group of parents served Class Counsel with an earlier\nmotion to intervene. The court’s conclusions are logically\nfallacious because most of the Proposed Intervenors did not\neven have children enrolled in LAUSD in 2002—much less\n\f                         SMITH V. LAUSD                             35\n\nin 1993 when this litigation commenced. 20 Appellants could\nnot possibly have been on notice that their interests were not\nadequately represented prior to having any interest in this\nlitigation at all. The district court’s analysis therefore\nincorrectly conflated the knowledge of an entirely different\ngroup of parents with Appellants’ knowledge.\n\n    Nor should the fact that “the inclusion of special\neducation students into the general education program has\nbeen a primary issue from the beginning of this case” have\nplaced Appellants on notice that intervention was necessary\nto protect their interests prior to 2013. Both the 1996\nConsent Decree and the 2003 MCD specifically required\nLAUSD to maintain special education centers throughout\nthe district as placement options for moderately to severely\ndisabled children. Consistent with this mandate, LAUSD\ncontinued to operate approximately the same number of\nspecial education centers throughout the district from 1993\nto 2013. That LAUSD continued to offer placement in\nspecial education centers despite decades of discussions\nabout greater integration of disabled children in the general\neducation environment only contradicts the lower court’s\nconclusion that the same discussions should have placed\nAppellants on notice that LAUSD planned to start closing\nspecial education centers en masse in 2013 and 2014—an\n\n  20\n     Appellant Lee’s and Ayapana’s children were 14 years old in\nOctober 2013, making them only 4 in 2003. Appellant Moreno’s\ndaughter and Appellant J. Flores’ son were 10 years old in October 2013,\nmeaning they were newborns in 2003. The only potential exception is\nLinda Buschini (a member of the April Munoz Proposed Intervenors),\nwho was a member of the parent group who sought to intervene in 2002.\nEven so, Buschini’s involvement in 2002 could not reasonably have\nplaced her on notice of the change in circumstances that occurred in\n2012, given that the 2003 MCD specifically guaranteed the retention of\nspecial education centers.\n\f36                        SMITH V. LAUSD\n\naction expressly prohibited by both the MCD and the\nConsent Decree. Indeed, if anything, statements that\nLAUSD was engaged in “discussions” to achieve greater\ncompliance with the MCD would have only reinforced\nAppellants’ belief that LAUSD planned to continue to offer\nspecial education centers as part of the “full continuum” of\nservices available to disabled students in LAUSD. LAUSD\nnow takes the position that the MCD does not require it to\nmaintain any particular number of special education centers,\nand therefore its actions violate neither the MCD nor any\ngoverning law. LAUSD’s argument misses the point. The\nquestion before us is whether Appellants were reasonably on\nnotice that their interest in maintaining special education\ncenters as placement options for their children was not being\nadequately represented by the existing parties to the Chanda\nSmith litigation. We conclude that they were not on notice,\nbecause Appellants reasonably construed the MCD as\nensuring the maintenance of the special education centers\ntheir children attended. The district court therefore erred in\nreaching a contrary conclusion. 21\n\n\n\n 21\n    Specifically, the district court cited a statement in the Independent\nMonitor’s October 5, 2011 Annual Report that meeting one aspect of\nModified Outcome 7 “would require the arbitrary transfer of a significant\nnumber of [multiple disabilities orthopedic] students. The Parties are\ncurrently engaged in discussions to find a solution to this problem.” But\nin context, this statement undercuts the district court’s conclusion. The\nIndependent Monitor certainly was not advocating the “arbitrary”\ntransfer of students; indeed, that would be contrary to the IDEA’s IEP\nrequirement. Thus, the Independent Monitor’s statement could not\nreasonably be construed as notice that LAUSD intended to start\n“arbitrarily” transferring special education students to general education\nschools and campuses.           Moreover, the Independent Monitor’s\nacknowledgement that LAUSD had again failed to meet Outcome 7 was\nnothing new. LAUSD had never met any version of Outcome 7; this\n\f                          SMITH V. LAUSD                              37\n\n     In short, only the district court’s finding that Appellants\nvariously received some form of notice in April, May, or\nJune of 2013 is reasonably supported by the record. Even\nso, as discussed above, Appellants had not been privy to the\nnegotiations that led to Renegotiated Outcome 7, and the\ninitial information promulgated by LAUSD as to the\npractical effects of Renegotiated Outcome 7 was incomplete.\nAppellants therefore convincingly urge that they did not\nrealize until the August 5, 2013 meeting with Class Counsel\nthat their interests were not being adequately represented by\nthe existing parties to the Chanda Smith Litigation. The\ndistrict court even conceded that this “could constitute a\nproper explanation for [Appellants’] delay—at least until\nAugust 5, 2013.” We have no reason to disturb the court’s\nfinding in this regard.\n\n    However, the district court then proceeded to find no\nvalid excuse for Appellants’ additional delays of 71 and 79\ndays, respectively, between the August 5, 2013 meeting and\nthe October 15 and 23, 2013 filing dates of the motions to\nintervene. We again reject the district court’s analysis as\ncontrary to law and an abuse of discretion in light of the\nrecord in this case. Where—as here—both the first and\nsecond timeliness factors weigh in favor of intervention, we\nhave found motions to be timely even in the face of longer\ndelays than are present here. 22 See, e.g., State of Oregon,\n745 F.2d at 552.\n\n\nprolonged failure is what led to numerous renegotiations of that\nOutcome.\n  22\n     The off-point and non-binding authorities cited by the district court\ndo not counsel otherwise; those cases merely found unexcused delays of\nfour and five months, respectively, to weigh against a finding of\n\f38                     SMITH V. LAUSD\n\n     More importantly, the totality of the circumstances here\ndemonstrates that Appellants’ delay in filing between\nAugust and October of 2013 was justified. It bears noting,\nfirst of all, that only one Appellant (Munoz) appears to have\nbeen present at the August 2013 meetings. And in any event,\nthe record is replete with evidence that—perhaps in no small\npart due to the rosy language in which the changes were\nportrayed by LAUSD—Appellants reasonably did not\nappreciate the full import of Renegotiated Outcome 7,\nincluding the changes to their children’s curricula and\nlearning environments, until classes actually began in\nAugust of 2013, see, e.g., Moreno Decl. ¶ 3; J. Flores Decl.\n¶¶ 9, 11; Buschini Decl. ¶ 8; Aguilar Decl. ¶ 4; Pineda Decl.\n(explaining that Pineda did not realize the safety risk the new\nlearning environment posed to Pineda’s autistic son, V.P.,\nuntil V.P. was found “walking alone a mile from the school”\ndue to understaffing in V.P.’s classroom and the lack of\nspecial safety features at V.P.’s new general education\ncampus), or until their children began coming home from\nschool with injuries, see, e.g., J. Flores Decl. ¶ 11, Exh. C\n(photographs of injuries); A. Flores Decl. ¶ 6; Hernandez\nDecl. ¶¶ 3–4, Exh. E (photographs of injuries); Chamu Decl.\n¶ 6. Many parents initially attempted informal resolution of\ntheir disagreement with LAUSD as to their child’s\nplacement. See, e.g., Chamu Decl. ¶¶ 6, 10; J. Flores Decl.\n¶ 10; Buschini Decl. ¶ 13. Several parents attended a\nmeeting on September 9, 2013, at which they inquired about\nthe new placement of their children. Even after it became\nclear that intervention was necessary to protect Appellants’\ninterests, it simply took time to organize and gather evidence\nto support Appellants’ motions to intervene. Appellants are\n\ntimeliness. See Key Bank of Puget Sound v. Alaskan Harvester, 738 F.\nSupp. 398, 405 (W.D. Wash. 1989); Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v.\nBreznay, 683 F. Supp. 832, 836 (D.D.C. 1987).\n\f                      SMITH V. LAUSD                          39\n\nnot a sophisticated or unified body, but rather a consortium\nof parents of special education students. See Stallworth,\n558 F.2d at 264 (explaining that the “size and sophistication\nof the would-be intervenor”—in that case, the NAACP—\nwas a relevant factor in determining timeliness). At least one\nAppellant required translation services to prepare the\ndeclaration submitted in support of one of the motions to\nintervene. See Chamu Decl., Translator’s Declaration.\nTaken together, the district court’s conclusion that\nAppellants had offered no valid excuse or explanation for\ntheir delay was contrary to the record and clearly erroneous.\nThe district court therefore committed legal error in failing\nto find that the third timeliness factor weighs in favor of\nintervention.\n\n    Notwithstanding our holding today, we emphasize that\nthis factor cannot be distilled into a bright-line rule. That is,\na delay of 71 or 79 days might, under different\ncircumstances, weigh against timeliness. We merely hold\ntoday that, in light of all the circumstances presented here,\nthe district court abused its discretion in failing to recognize\nthat Appellants have justified their failure to move to\nintervene prior to mid-October 2013.\n\n    Because all three factors weigh in favor of timeliness,\nAppellants have established the first element for intervention\nas a matter of right.\n\n                  C. Protectable Interest\n\n    Second, Appellants must show that they have a\nprotectable interest in the Chanda Smith Litigation. LAUSD\ndoes not challenge the district court’s finding that Appellants\nhave a protectable interest in receiving a free appropriate\npublic education in conformity with their children’s IEPs.\n\f40                        SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nSee 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)(A); Cal. Ed. Code § 5600, et seq.\nWe agree that this is a protectable interest and find the\nsecond element for Rule 24(a) intervention to be established.\n\n                    D. Practical Impairment\n\n    Third, Appellants must show that they are so situated that\nthe disposition of the action without Appellants may as a\npractical matter impair or impede their ability to safeguard\ntheir protectable interest. As an alternative basis for denying\nAppellants’ motion to intervene, the district court found that\nAppellants would “not suffer a practical impairment of their\ninterest in receiving a FAPE in accordance with their IEPs\nbecause the adoption of [Renegotiated] Outcome 7 does not\ndeprive [Appellants] of special education centers as\nplacement options or violate the IEP assessment process.”\nAs a preliminary matter, we note that this statement is at least\npartly contradicted by the record: A number of LAUSD’s\nformer special education centers are no longer accepting\nenrollment of Appellants’ children and similarly situated\ndisabled students ages 6 to 18.\n\n    More to the point, the district court reasoned that denying\nintervention would not practically impair Appellants’\nprotectable interest, given the availability of individual,\nadministrative due process proceedings for parents who\ndisagree with LAUSD’s placement of their child. See Cal.\nEd. Code § 56501, et seq. 23 We review the district court’s\n\n 23\n     Notably, the MCD “preclu[des] . . . any class member [from]\nbringing any class action claim . . . concerning the District’s compliance\nwith IDEA or . . . concerning the provision of a free appropriate public\nschool education.” The MCD carves out a few exceptions, including for\nadministrative proceedings “to review the District’s compliance with its\nobligation to provide a free appropriate public education to any\n\f                         SMITH V. LAUSD                              41\n\nfinding of no practical impairment to the putative class\naction intervenors because of the availability of individual\nremedies de novo, FFRF, 644 F.3d at 840, and conclude that\nthe district court erred.\n\n     Courts have long recognized the benefits conferred by\nthe class action mechanism over numerous individual\nactions. Class actions are used to “vindicate[e] . . . the rights\nof groups of people who individually would be without\neffective strength to bring their opponents into court at all.”\nAmchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 617\n(1997). Particularly where, as here, injunctive relief is\nsought, “[e]conomic reality dictates” that many challenges\nto LAUSD’s placement of disabled children must “proceed\nas a class action or not at all.” Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin,\n417 U.S. 156, 161 (1974). In fact, a determination that the\nclass action vehicle provides a superior mechanism for\nlitigating LAUSD’s district-wide policies regarding the\neducation of its disabled student population was already\nmade at the commencement of the Chanda Smith\nLitigation—itself a class action. The denial of intervention\nhere permits the Chanda Smith plaintiffs to pursue their\neducation policy goals with the benefit of the class action\nmechanism, while denying Appellants the same. This result\ndoes—as a practical matter—impair Appellants’ ability to\nsafeguard the interests of a sub-class of LAUSD students\nseeking retention of special education centers as placement\noptions vis-à-vis Class Counsel’s and LAUSD’s interest in\neliminating them. The impairment is especially perverse\ngiven that Appellants currently have children enrolled in\n\nindividual student.” (emphasis added). However, as members of the\nChanda Smith class, Appellants are precluded by the MCD from\nbringing a separate class action challenging the legality of Renegotiated\nOutcome 7.\n\f42                        SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nLAUSD, while the named Chanda Smith plaintiffs’ children\nhave long since left.\n\n     Not only are individual administrative challenges a\ncomparatively inefficient and ineffective means of achieving\nsystem-wide relief, 24 but the administrative proceedings\npermit Appellants to challenge only the effects of\nRenegotiated Outcome 7 on individual students—not the\nlegality of Renegotiated Outcome 7 itself. See Cal. Educ.\nCode § 56501 (due process hearings are available to resolve\ndisagreements as to the proper placement of an individual\nchild). A collateral challenge on Renegotiated Outcome 7 is\nan inferior means of protecting the interests of LAUSD’s\nspecial education center population. Even if Appellants and\nevery single special education student transferred to a\ngeneral education campus pursuant to Renegotiated\nOutcome 7 to date were able successfully to challenge that\nplacement through the administrative process, and even to\nsecure a court order requiring LAUSD to reopen each child’s\nspecial education center, Renegotiated Outcome 7 would\nstill mandate a 33 percent reduction in the opportunity for\nenrollment in special education centers. Thus, it would still\nrequire LAUSD to identify and transfer 33 percent of the\nspecial education center student population to general\neducation schools, in effect creating a revolving door of\ntransfers between special and general education campuses.\n\n   Of course, it is unlikely that all parents will undertake the\ntime and monetary investment necessary to challenge\nLAUSD’s placement of their child. But that fact, again,\n\n 24\n      Practical considerations, including the allocation of limited\nresources such as teachers and curriculum materials, also favor direct\nintervention in the litigation that has led to the adoption of an allegedly\nunlawful policy, rather than piecemeal efforts to avoid its effects.\n\f                      SMITH V. LAUSD                        43\n\nleads us to conclude that the interests of the sub-class\nAppellants seek to represent would be practically impaired\nif intervention is denied and parents of special education\nstudents are limited to individual challenges to LAUSD’s\nplacement of their children. We accordingly hold that\nAppellants’ interest in ensuring the availability of special\neducation centers to LAUSD students (to the extent\nconsistent with IEP and FAPE requirements) would, as a\npractical matter, be impaired if intervention is denied and\nAppellants are precluded from directly challenging the\nlegality of Renegotiated Outcome 7 in the Chanda Smith\nLitigation. To the extent there is any doubt as to Appellants’\nestablishment of this factor, our resolution of it in favor of\nintervention is consistent with the rule that “the requirements\nfor intervention are [to be] broadly interpreted in favor of\nintervention.” Alisal Water Corp., 370 F.3d at 919.\n\n              E. Inadequate Representation\n\n    There is no dispute that Appellants’ interests are\ninadequately represented by the parties to this action: The\ncurrent parties’ interest in transferring students and\nresources from special education centers to general\neducation campuses is diametrically opposed to Appellants’\ninterest in retaining the system that was in place prior to\nRenegotiated Outcome 7. We have no difficulty finding this\nelement met. Cf. Trbovich v. United Mine Workers of Am.,\n404 U.S. 528, 538 n.10 (1972) (noting that the fourth\nelement of Rule 24(a) intervention requires only a “minimal”\nshowing that existing parties’ representation “may be”\ninadequate).\n\f44                   SMITH V. LAUSD\n\n                            III.\n\n    In sum, Appellants have established all four elements of\nintervention as of right under Rule 24(a).\n\n   We accordingly REVERSE the district court’s denial of\nAppellants’ motion to intervene and REMAND for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\f",

Code §§ 56361(f); 56367—a term\nof art which includes ‘the California School for the Deaf,’\nCal. Educ.

Indeed, if\nanything, statements that LAUSD was engaged in\n‘discussions’ to achieve greater compliance with the MCD\nwould have only reinforced Appellants’ belief that LAUSD\nplanned to continue to offer special education centers as part\nof the ‘full continuum’ of services available to disabled\nstudents in LAUSD.

LAUSD\n\nneither the MCD nor any governing law. LAUSD’s\nargument misses the point. The question before us is\nwhether Appellants were reasonably on notice that their\ninterest in maintaining special education centers as\nplacement options for their children was not being\nadequately represented by the existing parties to the Chanda\nSmith litigation. We conclude that they were not on notice,\nbecause Appellants reasonably construed the MCD as\nensuring the maintenance of the special education centers\ntheir children attended. The district court therefore erred in\nreaching a contrary conclusion.”\n\n    With these amendments, the panel has voted to deny\nAppellees’ June 3, 2016 Petition for Rehearing and\nRehearing En Banc.

Appellees’ Petition for\nRehearing En Banc was also circulated to the judges of this\ncourt, and no judge requested a vote for en banc\nconsideration. Accordingly, the Petition for Rehearing and\nRehearing En Banc is DENIED.\n\n    Appellants’ June 23, 2016 Motion for an Interim\nInjunction is likewise DENIED without prejudice to refiling\nin the district court. Appellants have failed to “show that\nmoving first in the district court would be impracticable,”\ngiven the very late stage of these appellate proceedings. Fed.\nR. App. P. 8(a)(2)(A)(i).

That settlement requires\na class of LAUSD’s most severely disabled students to go to\nthe same schools as the district’s general, non-disabled\nstudent body. LAUSD calls this “integration”; Appellants\nwant their children to be schooled separately. A district\ncourt denied Appellants’ motion to intervene.

LAUSD\n\ninterest in ensuring the receipt of public education consistent\nwith their disabilities and federal law.\n\n               I. SUMMARY OF FACTS\n\n     A. Relevant Statutory History and Landscape\n\n    We are called upon today to review only the district\ncourt’s denial of Appellant’s motion to intervene, and\ntherefore do not opine on whether the actions of LAUSD that\nprompted Appellants to file their motions violated federal or\nstate law. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore that at the core of\nthis case is a fundamental disagreement as to the proper\napproach to education of a class of moderately-to-severely\ndisabled children. Thus the statutes upon which the present\nmotion rests provide the basis of our analysis.\n\n    Before 1975, children with disabilities were often\nexcluded from general public schools and required to attend\nseparate school campuses comprised wholly or primarily of\ndisabled children (termed “special education centers” by\nLAUSD). 20 U.S.C. § 1400(c)(2)(B). Following claims that\nthis allocation violated due process, see, e.g., Mills v. Bd. Of\nEduc. of the Dist. of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2010674\"><a href=\"/opinion/2010674/mills-v-board-of-education-of-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 869–70,\n875 (D.D.C. 1972), Congress enacted the Education for All\nHandicapped Children Act (which has since been retitled as\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (the\n‘IDEA’)). See 20 U.S.C. § 1400, et seq.\n\n    The IDEA requires that a “free appropriate public\neducation” (a “FAPE”) be made available to every disabled\nchild; a FAPE must be fashioned so as to accommodate an\nindividual child’s disability. See id. §§ 1401, 1412(a), 1414.\nTo make an adequate FAPE, local education agencies must\ndevelop an Individualized Education Program (an “IEP”) for\neach disabled child. See id. § 1414(d). An IEP consists of a\n\f                      SMITH V. LAUSD                         9\n\nwritten statement setting forth the special services and aids\nthe child needs to get a FAPE. See id. §§ 1401, 1414.\n\n      The IDEA also has a preference for integration of\ndisabled children in the general education schools. But such\nintegration must be beneficial to the disabled child, given the\nnature and severity of his disability. This preference is found\nin the IDEA’s “Least Restrictive Environment” (“LRE”)\nrequirement. It directs that a disabled child should attend\nregular classes with nondisabled children “[t]o the maximum\nextent appropriate.” Id. § 1412(a)(5); see also 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.114(a)(2)(i)–(ii); Cal. Ed. Code § 56364.2. At the\nsame time, however, the IDEA endorses the “removal of\nchildren with disabilities from the regular educational\nenvironment . . . when the nature or severity of the disability\n. . . is such that education in regular classes with the use of\nsupplementary aids and services cannot be achieved\nsatisfactorily.” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5); see also Poolaw v.\nBishop, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705962\"><a href=\"/opinion/705962/lionel-poolaw-and-daphne-poolaw-as-next-friends-of-lionel-b-poolaw-iii/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">830</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 834 (9th Cir. 1995) (“In some cases,\nsuch as where the child’s handicap is particularly severe, it\nwill be impossible to provide any meaningful education to\nthe student in a mainstream environment.”).\n\n    Consistent with this framework, California law requires\neducators to maintain a “continuum of [special education]\nprogram options.” See Cal. Educ. Code § 56361. This\ncontinuum “include[s], but [is] not . . . limited to” full-time\nenrollment in “State special schools,” see Cal. Educ. Code\n§§ 56361(f); 56367—a term of art which includes “the\nCalifornia School for the Deaf,” Cal. Educ. Code § 59020,\nand “the California School for the Blind,” id. § 59120.\n\n    B. The Chanda Smith Litigation and Outcome 7\n\n     Appellants seek to intervene in a class action lawsuit\ninitiated in 1993 in the United States District Court for the\n\f10                        SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nCentral District of California by Chanda Smith, a disabled\nstudent then enrolled in LAUSD. The professed purpose of\nthat suit, brought on behalf of all similarly situated persons,\nwas “to bring the [LAUSD]’s special education program into\ncompliance with federal law.” The Chanda Smith plaintiffs\nsought a number of improvements in the provision of special\neducation, including, to name a few: (1) the centralization\nand computerization of all students’ records, (2) the\nprovision of regular training to administrators as to their\n“legal and professional obligations to students with\ndisabilities,” (3) the “[r]ecruiting and hiring [of] more\ncredentialed special education personnel,” and (4) the\nprovision of “a full continuum of special education and\nrelated services . . . [to] students with disabilities at sites as\nclose to the home of such students as possible.” That\n“continuum” was to include “all of the following”:\n(a) “General education classrooms with appropriate\nsupplemental supports and services”; (b) “A resource\nspecialist program”; (c) “Nonpublic, nonsectarian school\nservices”; and (d) “State special schools pursuant to\nCalifornia Education Code Section 56367,” among other\noptions. This class action culminated in a 1996 Consent\nDecree negotiated between Chanda Smith’s counsel (“Class\nCounsel”) 2 and LAUSD. The Consent Decree was framed\nin terms of general “recommendations” for improvements in\nareas such as those listed above, but lacked any quantifiable\nmeasurements by which to determine whether LAUSD\nshould be deemed in compliance with the parties’ settlement.\n     A few years later, Class Counsel sought and obtained\ncourt approval of a plan that imposed more objectively\n\n  2\n    Class Counsel are legal organizations with a self-professed\nideological interest in advancing the rights of disabled children and their\nfamilies.\n\f                        SMITH V. LAUSD                             11\n\nquantifiable targets on LAUSD (“Plan 12”). Among other\nthings, Plan 12 called for the effective elimination of special\neducation centers. 3 LAUSD appealed the district court’s\nruling approving Plan 12. In 2002 and while that appeal was\npending, parents of children then enrolled in special\neducation centers in LAUSD served Class Counsel with a\nmotion to intervene. The motion to intervene asserted that\nPlan 12’s elimination of special education centers violated\nthe IDEA’s “full continuum” requirement by eliminating an\nimportant placement option for disabled children.\n\n    Before that motion to intervene was filed with the district\ncourt, however, Class Counsel, LAUSD, and the would-be\nintervenors submitted their dispute to mediation. Class\nCounsel agreed to withdraw Plan 12. This mediation also\nled to the execution of a Modified Consent Decree (the\n“MCD”) in 2003, which reaffirmed “[t]he parties[’]\nagree[ment] that special education centers are part of the\ncontinuum of program options for a full continuum of\nspecial education and related services in the least restrictive\nenvironment.” MCD ¶ 47. In lieu of eliminating special\neducation centers, the MCD set forth an “Outcome 7.”\nOutcome 7 required the district to increase the percentage of\nstudents with disabilities aged 6 to 22, and who are to be\nplaced in the general education setting for 40 percent or more\nof the school day, from 29 percent to 52 percent by June 30,\n\n 3\n    Under Plan 12, disabled children could comprise no more than 15\npercent of any school’s population. Because special education centers\nare comprised heavily or wholly of disabled students, Plan 12’s 15\npercent limitation would have effectively eliminated special education\ncenters. The LAUSD objected to the plan by moving to modify and/or\nstay portions of the Consent Decree. The district court denied LAUSD’s\nmotion, which had the practical effect of approving Plan 12.\n\f12                       SMITH V. LAUSD\n\n2006. 4 Outcome 7 also limited to 48 percent those disabled\nstudents who were to spend more than 60 percent of the\ninstructional day in any of the following: (a) special\neducation classes at a general education facility, (b) a public\nspecial education center, (c) a non-public school with a\ncontract to provide special education services to LAUSD\nstudents (“Non-Public Schools”), or (d) a private residence\nor hospital learning environment. The MCD also established\nan “Independent Monitor” to oversee the LAUSD’s progress\nin meeting this and other Outcomes.\n\n    Because Outcome 7 was directed to increasing the\nintegration of disabled students in all four of the groups\nmaking up the 48 percent into LAUSD’s general education\nclasses, reduction of full-time enrollment of disabled\nstudents in special education centers was but one of many\nways LAUSD could achieve compliance with the MCD.\nIndeed, LAUSD necessarily had to look elsewhere than to\nspecial education centers to comply with Outcome 7—not\nonly because the MCD acknowledged the special education\ncenters as an important part of the continuum of educational\nservices available to disabled children, but also because\n\n 4\n    Notably, Outcome 7 excluded students with Specific Learning\nDisabilities (“SLD”) and “Speech and Language” Impediments (“SLI”),\nthe integration of whom was governed by Outcome 6 (which is not at\nissue in the present litigation). The SLD classification encompasses\nchildren with a “severe discrepancy between intellectual ability and\nachievement” in a particular area (such as “basic reading” or\nmathematics) due to “a disorder in one or more . . . basic psychological\nprocess[],” such as “attention” or “visual processing.” The SLI\nclassification encompasses children with speech impediments or\nlanguage fluency issues not due to unfamiliarity with English. See IEP\nEligibility, L.A. UNIFIED SCH. DIST. (last visited Jan. 25, 2016),\nhttp://achieve.lausd.net/Page/3346.\n\f                        SMITH V. LAUSD                              13\n\nenrollment in these centers accounted for a very small\npercentage of disabled student enrollment in LAUSD. 5\nBased on Class Counsel’s abandonment of its plan to\neliminate special education centers and the language in the\nMCD which specifically guaranteed their retention, the\nparent group agreed not to intervene.\n\n    LAUSD initially made significant progress towards\nOutcome 7. By September 2007, placement of disabled\nchildren included in Outcome 7 in general education classes\nfor at least 40 percent of the school day had increased from\n29 percent to 47 percent—though it turned out that this\nreported progress was somewhat inflated. 6 Declaration of\n\n 5\n    In 1998 (several years before the adoption of the Consent Decree)\nonly 5,298 of the roughly 80,000 students in LAUSD who received\nspecial education were enrolled in special education centers. By June\n24, 2012, enrollment in special education centers had fallen to 2,190—\nthough enrollment in Non-Public Schools increased over the same time\nperiod. Indeed, at least half the reduction in enrollment in special\neducation centers from 1998 to 2012 was offset by increased enrollment\nin Non-Public Schools, enrollment in which increased 47 percent\nbetween 1998 and 2012 (from 3,101 to 4,552).\n 6\n     A review of students’ actual class schedules revealed that\nadministrators were “overestimat[ing]” the time disabled students were\nspending in general education classes in order to create the appearance\nthat these targets were being met. See, e.g., Independent Monitor’s\nAnnual Report for the 2008–2009 School Year. Indeed, the Independent\nMonitor’s September 29, 2010 report noted three years of “increasing[]\noverestimat[ion] [of] the number and percentage of students in the\ngeneral education setting for 40% or more of the day.” (The Independent\nMonitor’s Annual Report for the 2009–2010 School Year explained: “As\nnoted in previous reports, a primary contributing factor to these\ndiscrepancies is that schools appear to be entering a percent of time\nbelow 60% in special education without regard or consideration of the\nstudent’s [actual] class schedule.”). See also Independent Monitor’s\nAnnual Report for the 2010–2011 School Year (stating the same).\n\f14                    SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nFrederick J. Weintraub (“Weintraub”), the Independent\nMonitor, ¶ 7. But as the pool of disabled students included\nin Outcome 7 who spent most or all of their day outside\ngeneral education classes and schools dwindled, it became\nincreasingly difficult for LAUSD to identify students for\nwhom greater integration was possible and beneficial.\n\n    Difficulties complying with Outcome 7 led to renewed\nnegotiations in September 2008 between Class Counsel, the\nLAUSD, and the Independent Monitor, who ultimately\nadopted a two-part modification to Outcome 7 (termed\n“Outcome 7A” and “Outcome 7B,” or collectively,\n“Modified Outcome 7”). Weintraub Decl. ¶¶ 8, 9. Modified\nOutcome 7 reduced the integration targets imposed by\noriginal Outcome 7 by exempting from compliance disabled\nstudents aged 18 to 22 and significantly reducing the\npercentage of students with orthopedic disabilities who were\nrequired to attend general education classes.\n\n     LAUSD remained unable to meet Outcome 7, even as\nmodified. The Independent Monitor ultimately concluded in\nits February 17, 2012 report that meeting Modified Outcome\n7 “would require the arbitrary transfer of a significant\nnumber of . . . students” from special education centers to\ngeneral education campuses, an approach the Independent\nMonitor had never endorsed, see, e.g., Independent\nMonitor’s Annual Report for the 2010–2011 School Year\n(“As noted in past reports, . . . [efforts to integrate special\neducation students as required by Outcome 7] should be in\nthe best interest of the student and not solely motivated by\nprogress on this [integration] outcome.”).\n\n   Commencing in October 2011, yet another round of\nnegotiations between the parties and the Independent\nMonitor ensued. This led to an amendment to the MCD\nmemorialized in a stipulation executed September 14, 2012\n\f                          SMITH V.

Renegotiated Outcome 7\nprovided that LAUSD would be deemed fully compliant\nwith Modified Outcome 7 if it accomplished two new goals:\n(a) a flat 33 percent decrease in special education center\nenrollment by June 2015; 7 and (b) integration of all\n“[s]tudents with moderate to severe disabilities at co-located\nschools” into “general education classes an average of 12%\nof the instructional day and during lunch, breaks/recess and\nschool-wide activities.” 8 As described in detail below, the\nimplementation of Renegotiated Outcome 7 in the 2013–14\nschool year brought substantial changes to the educational\nopportunities afforded children who attended (or sought to\nattend) special education centers in 2012. By 2014, over 8\nof LAUSD’s 18 special education centers had been closed to\n\n 7\n    This would represent a reduction of approximately 650 disabled\nstudents from schooling in special education centers, based on June 2012\nenrollment statistics.\n\n 8\n    We remain unable to decipher the precise meaning of “co-located”—\nan amorphous term used by LAUSD in 2012 and 2013 to describe its\nimplementation of Renegotiated Outcome 7. At times, LAUSD used the\nword “co-located” in lieu of “closed” to refer to a special education\ncenter which has undergone the physical transfer of all its students and\nresources from the special education center to a general education school\n(e.g., with respect to the closure of Blend Special Education Center for\nthe Blind). At other times, “co-located” was used to describe special\neducation centers that shared a physical border with a general education\ncampus (e.g., in the case of Banneker Special Education Center). By\n2014, LAUSD interpreted Renegotiated Outcome 7’s requirement that\nstudents at “co-located schools” spend an average of 12 percent of their\nday in general education classes as applying to disabled students at 13 of\nLAUSD’s 18 special education centers. Sometimes this meant the\ncomplete closure of a special education center; other times it meant the\ntransfer of disabled students to a general education school for some part\nor all of the school day.\n\f16                        SMITH V.

Parents\nof affected students were not invited to participate in the\nLAUSD/Class Counsel/Independent Monitor negotiations,\nwhich commenced in October 2011, supra p.14, nor were\ntheir viewpoints solicited in the negotiation, adoption, or\nimplementation phases of Renegotiated Outcome 7. 9\n\n    LAUSD did not start notifying parents of children\naffected by Renegotiated Outcome 7, or provide any\ninformation as to how it intended to accomplish\nRenegotiated Outcome 7’s dual mandates, until Spring 2013.\nAs explained below, LAUSD’s notice varied significantly,\nbut bore certain common themes.\n\n    Appellants whose children had attended Blend Special\nEducation Center for the Blind (“Blend”) were generally told\nduring individual parent IEP meetings in Spring 2013 that\nplacement at Blend (or any other special education center)\nwas no longer an option for their child; the Blend faculty and\nstudent body was being relocated in its entirety to a general\neducation school.\n\n    About the same time, parents of children attending\nBanneker Special Education Center (“Banneker”) were told\nthat their school would be “co-located” with Avalon Gardens\nElementary (“Avalon Gardens”), a general education\ncampus, starting in the 2013–14 school year. At the\n\n 9\n    In fact, the Independent Monitor’s reports treated parental resistance\nto increased placement of severely disabled students on general\neducation campuses as an obstacle to be overcome. See, e.g.,\nIndependent Monitor’s Annual Report for the 2010–2011 School Year\n(instructing that “the District is encouraged to continue its work with\nfamilies to explore existing and new classes on general education\ncampuses. While families may resist, it is important they be exposed to\noptions available outside of special education centers”).\n\f                          SMITH V. LAUSD                               17\n\ncommencement of the 2013 school year, parents learned that\nthis meant that students enrolled in Banneker would be\ntransported to Avalon Gardens for an average of 12 percent\nof their instructional day for “integration activities.” In\nFebruary 2014 (after the motion to intervene at issue in this\ncase was filed), Banneker parents learned that LAUSD\nwould be closing Banneker altogether and relocating its\nstudent body to Avalon Gardens starting in the 2014–15\nschool year. See Mina Lee Request for Judicial Notice (“Lee\nRJN”), Exh. A (Feb. 14, 2014 letter), Exh.

LAUSD\n\n    Notice to parents of disabled children attending\nLanterman Special Education Center (“Lanterman”) took\nthe form of a field “trip slip” that was circulated to parents\nin the Fall of 2013—about a year after the adoption of\nRenegotiated Outcome 7. The “trip slip” purported to seek\ntemporary authorization to transport Lanterman students to\na general education school for an integration “test.”\nAppellants have offered evidence that LAUSD used the field\ntrip slips to justify the permanent and daily transportation of\nLanterman students to general education classes.\n\n   Affidavits submitted by parents of children who were\npreviously enrolled full-time at Lull Special Education\nCenter, Lokrantz Special Education Center, and McBride\nSpecial Education Center contain accounts similar to those\ndescribed by Blend and Banneker parents.\n\n     Aside from the different types of individualized notice\nrelated above, Executive Director of Special Education in\nLAUSD, Sharyn Howell, circulated a letter on May 21, 2013\nto the “LAUSD Community” (the “Howell Letter”),\nannouncing that Modified Outcome 7 had been again\nrenegotiated on September 14, 2012 and that, as a result, a\n“reduc[tion] [in] the number of students with moderate to\nsevere disabilities ages 6–18 at segregated special education\ncenters” would occur. The Howell Letter indicated that four\nspecial education centers (Banneker, Blend, McBride, and\nMiller) would be affected in the 2013–14 school year. The\nletter further explained that all pre-school-aged special\neducation students would be sent to general education\nschools, rather than to special education centers. See Aguilar\nDecl. ¶ 7 (noting declining enrollment in several special\neducation centers as a result of the district’s new policy\nagainst permitting new student enrollment); see also Berrios\nDecl. ¶¶ 6–7 (stating the same).\n\f                         SMITH V. LAUSD                              19\n\n    As the Howell Letter indicated, 2013 was a year of great\nchanges. Even those Proposed Intervenors who received\nnotice through IEP meetings in Spring 2013 that their\nchildren would receive “integration opportunities” in the\ncoming school year were left uncertain as to the actual\neffects on them of Renegotiated Outcome 7. See, e.g., J.\nFlores Decl. ¶ 9. Many parents, particularly those for whom\nEnglish is a second language, were incorrectly led to believe\nthat the services and curriculum offered their children would\nremain the same despite the transfer to a new school. See,\ne.g., J. Flores Decl. ¶ 12; A. Flores Decl. ¶ 4; Lee Decl. ¶ 6;\nChamu Decl. ¶¶ 4–5. Many parents claim simply not to have\nappreciated the effects of the changes until their children\nbegan coming home after school with bruises and other\ninjuries in late August and September of 2013—injuries\nAppellants’ children suffered while in general education\nschools. See, e.g., J. Flores Decl. ¶ 11; A. Flores Decl. ¶ 6;\nHernandez Decl. ¶¶ 3–4; Chamu Decl. ¶ 6; Hernandez Decl.,\nExh. E (photographs of injuries); J. Flores Decl., Exh. C\n(photographs of injuries). Parents also discovered in Fall\n2013 that the general education campuses to which their\nchildren (and over 500 other moderately to severely disabled\nchildren) were being transferred had not been adapted,\nthrough tangible construction alterations, to provide a safe\nand effective learning environment, as memorialized in the\nIndependent Monitor’s October 2014 Report. See Munoz\nRJN, Exh. 1, p. 4.11\n\n\n 11\n    Much of the necessary alteration was not scheduled to start until the\nsummer of 2015. The Independent Monitor’s report following the 2013–\n14 school year also noted a number of “questionable” planning decisions\nthat seemed unlikely to safeguard the health and safety of disabled\nstudents even after renovations were completed.

Maseda Decl. ¶¶ 10–13; Munoz\nDecl. Munoz and Maseda concluded that neither LAUSD\nnor Class Counsel represented their interests or believed that\nspecial education centers should be a part of the continuum\nof special education opportunities available to disabled\nchildren in LAUSD.\n\n    On October 15, 2013, and October 23, 2013, seventy-one\nand seventy-nine days after concluding their interests were\nnot being represented by LAUSD or Class Counsel,\nrespectively, two groups of parents (the April Munoz\nProposed Intervenors and the Mina Lee Proposed\nIntervenors) moved to intervene “individually and on behalf\nof all other persons similarly situated” as a matter of right,\nsee Fed.

Alisal, 370 F.3d at 918–\n19. A court abuses its discretion if it fails to apply the correct\nlegal rule or standard. United States v. Hinkson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1191667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1191667/united-states-v-hinkson/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1262 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc). And even “[i]f the trial\ncourt identified the correct legal rule,” we may find an abuse\nof discretion if the court’s application of that rule was\n“(1) illogical, (2) implausible, or (3) without support in\ninferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.”\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                        B. Timeliness\n\n    Timeliness is determined by the totality of the\ncircumstances facing would-be intervenors, with a focus on\nthree primary factors: “(1) the stage of the proceeding at\nwhich an applicant seeks to intervene; (2) the prejudice to\nother parties; and (3) the reason for and length of the delay.”\nAlisal Water, 370 F.3d at 921. In analyzing these factors,\nhowever, courts should bear in mind that “[t]he crucial date\nfor assessing the timeliness of a motion to intervene is when\nproposed intervenors should have been aware that their\ninterests would not be adequately protected by the existing\nparties.” Smith v. Marsh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766546\"><a href=\"/opinion/766546/katuria-e-smith-angela-rock-michael-pyle-for-themselves-and-all-others/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1045</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1052 (9th Cir.\n1999). As explained below, the district court’s analysis did\nnot follow this basic principle. We accordingly hold that the\ncourt abused its discretion in finding Appellants’ motions\nuntimely under the totality of the circumstances of this case.\n\f                      SMITH V. LAUSD                        23\n\n                1. Stage of the Proceedings\n\n    It is true that Appellants seek to intervene in this action\napproximately twenty years after its commencement, and\nseventeen years after the adoption of the first Consent\nDecree.       However, in analyzing the “stage of the\nproceedings” factor, the “[m]ere lapse of time alone is not\ndeterminative.” United States v. State of Oregon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"442839\"><a href=\"/opinion/442839/united-states-of-america-and-the-confederated-tribes-and-bands-of-the-warm/\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">550</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 552 (9th Cir. 1984). Where a change of circumstances\noccurs, and that change is the “major reason” for the motion\nto intervene, the stage of proceedings factor should be\nanalyzed by reference to the change in circumstances, and\nnot the commencement of the litigation. See id.\n\n    We previously applied this rule in State of Oregon,\nwhere the State of Idaho moved to intervene in litigation\nbetween the States of Washington and Oregon and various\nIndian Tribes, fifteen years after the commencement of that\naction in 1968, and five years after a settlement had been\nreached in 1977. Id. at 551–52. Notwithstanding the\nsubstantial lapse in time, we held that the “stage of\nproceedings” factor supported a finding of timeliness\nbecause a “change of circumstance” had occurred in 1982—\ntwo Indian tribes had given “notice of their intent to\nwithdraw from the [settlement] or to renegotiate it” which\ncreated “the possibility of new and expanded negotiations.”\nId. at 552. We concluded that this change in circumstances\nweighed in favor of a finding that the State of Idaho’s August\n1983 motion to intervene was timely. Id. at 552–53 (holding\nthat the district court abused its discretion in denying the\nmotion to intervene as untimely).\n\n    Here, the district court’s conclusory determination that\nRenegotiated Outcome 7 did not constitute a change in\ncircumstances because it “appears to be just another\n\f24                        SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nmodification to the MCD aimed at further integration,” was\ncontrary to any plausible interpretation of the record.\nPerhaps viewed as a progression towards “integration,”\nRenegotiated Outcome 7 represented only “another step” in\nLAUSD’s march toward the goal of greater integration of\ndisabled children in LAUSD’s schools; attempts—some\nsuccessful, some not—toward integration had been\noccurring since the adoption of the original Consent Decree.\nBut the record demonstrates that Renegotiated Outcome 7\ncaused a substantial change in the educational opportunities\nafforded the group of disabled students of the LAUSD who\nattended special education centers prior to 2013—namely,\nthe group now seeking to intervene.\n\n    From 1993 to 2012, LAUSD operated approximately 18\nspecial education centers throughout the school district, and\nit offered full-time placement at those schools for children\nwhose IEPs so recommended. During that time, the\nplacement of these students (including, at times, the transfer\nof a student from a special education center to a general\neducation school) was conducted through case-by-case\nassessments of individual students, by IEP teams and with\nparental involvement and consent; indeed, parents retained\nsome influence over, and input into, their child’s placement,\nincluding the opportunity to object during the IEP process to\ntheir child’s removal from a special education center. 13 See,\n\n\n 13\n     For example, the Independent Monitor’s 2010-11 Report indicated\nthat, of the “95 children identified as potential students to transition”\nfrom special education centers to general education campuses, only 27\nwere actually transferred. The Independent Monitor attributed the low\ntransfer rate to parental resistance to the removal of their children from\nspecial education centers.\n\f                          SMITH V. LAUSD                              25\n\ne.g., Efron Decl. ¶¶ 34–36; Gliona Decl. ¶¶ 6, 8, 10;\nAyapana Decl. ¶¶ 4–5.\n\n    Since Renegotiated Outcome 7, however, severely\ndisabled children have been transferred en masse to general\neducation campuses, over parental objections. At least 8 of\nthe 18 special education centers have been closed to\nenrollment by Appellants and similarly situated disabled\nstudents. 14 Appellants have offered evidence that parents\nare not consulted in the development of their child’s IEP.\nRather, they are told that placement in a special education\ncenter is no longer an option. If they disagree with a\npredetermined placement, their only recourse is to file an\nadministrative appeal. See, e.g., Maseda Decl. ¶ 7; Lee Decl.\n¶ 4; J. Flores Decl. ¶ 13; A. Flores Decl. ¶ 4; Gliona Decl.\n\n 14\n     As discussed above, Blend Special Education Center for the Blind\nwas the first special education center to close. LAUSD disputes that the\ntransfer of all students, teachers, assistants, and curriculum materials\nfrom a special education center to a general education campus constitutes\nthe “closure” of a special education center. We reject this slight on the\nmeaning of words. For all practical purposes, the complete transfer of\nstudents, teaching staff, and resources from a school is a closure of that\nschool, at least as to those students and that teaching staff. Moreover,\nletters prepared by LAUSD demonstrate that at least seven more special\neducation centers have followed suit: A letter dated March 3, 2014 from\nLAUSD to parents of students at Lull Special Education Center\nexplained that the school’s “teachers, assistants and classroom materials”\nwould be “relocated to Northridge Middle School,” a general education\nschool. Lee RJN, Exh. B. A letter dated March 21, 2014 (again, from\nthe school district) announced that at the commencement of the 2014–15\nschool year six more of LAUSD’s remaining special education centers\n(Banneker, Salvin, Willenberg, Marlton, Leichman, and Perez) would be\nconverted into “Career Transition Centers.” Lee RJN, Exh. E (also\nexplaining that “[t]his transition means that our 7–11 graders will be\nrelocated to other campuses”). As noted, Career Transition Centers are\nschools that teach children ages 18 to 22 basic job and independent living\nskills.\n\f26                        SMITH V. LAUSD\n\n¶¶ 8–9, 11, 15–17; Goldberg Decl. ¶ 4. Starting in 2013,\nLAUSD began conducting individual student and parent IEP\nmeetings with an attorney present. See Gliona Decl. ¶ 8;\nGliona Decl. ¶ 7. Whereas the 2003 MCD had stated that\nspecial education centers were an important part of the\n“continuum” of educational opportunities available to\ndisabled children, LAUSD Executive Director of Special\nEducation, Sharyn Howell, has now taken the position that\nspecial education centers are unnecessary because the\ndistrict can “provide all supports and services . . . at a general\neducation site.” Howell Decl. ¶ 4.\n\n    Additionally, the record indicates that most, if not all,\nstudents formerly enrolled full-time in special education\ncenters (regardless of whether their schools have been\nclosed) are now required to spend an average of 12 percent\nof their instructional day in general education classes—most\nfrequently physical education, music, theater, and art\nclasses. This curriculum change has been imposed on\nstudents whose individual IEPs previously recommended\nfull-time placement in a special education center. 15\n\n   In short, if the “possibility” of negotiations constituted a\nchange of circumstances in State of Oregon, then LAUSD’s\n\n 15\n     For example, J.R.C. is blind, cannot communicate verbally, and is\nseverely developmentally delayed; yet starting in the 2013–14 school\nyear, he was required to attend “integrated” physical education classes\nover his parents’ objection that such integration is not safe.

For purposes of the\n“stage of proceedings” analysis, it is critical that Appellants\nhave moved to intervene to challenge only Renegotiated\nOutcome 7 and the manner by which it has been\nimplemented—in other words, the most current stage of the\nChanda Smith Litigation. Appellants are not seeking to\nreopen decades of litigation. Thus, it was error to measure\nthe timeliness of Appellants’ motions by reference to stages\nof litigation pre-dating the change in circumstances that\nmotivated Appellants’ motion to intervene.

Prejudice to Other Parties\n\n    We have previously held that prejudice to existing\nparties is “the most important consideration in deciding\nwhether a motion for intervention is untimely.” State of\nOregon, 745 F.2d at 552. We have also recognized that\ncourts may find prejudice on the basis of non-monetary\nfactors: For example, if granting a belated motion to\nintervene would threaten the delicate balance reached by\nexisting parties after protracted negotiations, this factor may\nweigh against intervention. See, e.g., Cty. of Orange v. Air\nCal., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"475322\"><a href=\"/opinion/475322/county-of-orange-v-air-california-american-airlines-america-west-airlines/\"><span class=\"volume\">799</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538 (9th Cir. 1986). However, we\nemphasized in State of Oregon that the only “prejudice” that\nis relevant under this factor is that which flows from a\nprospective intervenor’s failure to intervene after he knew,\nor reasonably should have known, that his interests were not\nbeing adequately represented—and not from the fact that\nincluding another party in the case might make resolution\nmore “difficult[].” 745 F.2d at 552–53; see also Stallworth\nv.

Moreover, the\nproposed intervenors were not seeking to intervene to challenge the\nmodification, but rather sought to “scrap[]” the original consent decree\nitself. Id. Under the totality of these circumstances, the Third Circuit\nconcluded, the district court had not abused its discretion in denying the\nlegislators’ motion to intervene as untimely. Id.\n\f30                   SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nallowing intervention, but rather how much prejudice would\nresult from the would-be intervenor’s failure to request\nintervention as soon as he knew or should have known of his\ninterest in the case.”).\n\n     In State of Oregon, various Indian tribes and the States\nof Washington and Oregon argued that permitting the State\nof Idaho to intervene in litigation fifteen years after the\ncommencement of the litigation regarding the regulation of\nfishing would jeopardize the existing parties’ negotiations.\n745 F.2d at 552–53. We rejected this argument. We found\nno prejudice because “the existing parties’ concerns have\nlittle to do with timeliness. They do not suggest that their\nproblems are materially different now than they would have\nbeen had Idaho sought to intervene a decade or more ago.”\nId. at 553. We therefore reversed the lower court’s denial of\nthe State of Idaho’s motion to intervene. Id.\n\n    As in State of Oregon, the district court’s finding of\nprejudice here was untethered to any prejudice which was\ncaused by Appellants’ delay. The district court reasoned that\npermitting intervention “would prolong the litigation,”\nbecause it would “upset the delicate balance the Parties and\nthe Independent Monitor have sought and achieved through\ncareful negotiation and research” in devising Renegotiated\nOutcome 7 (chronicling the lengthy negotiations of\nRenegotiated Outcome 7 between Class Counsel, the\nIndependent Monitor, and Dr. David Rostetter, a special\neducation expert, which culminated in Renegotiated\nOutcome 7). But this is merely an argument that permitting\nthe parties who concluded they were detrimentally affected\nin 2013 by Renegotiated Outcome 7 to participate in its\nnegotiation and implementation would make achieving\nresolution more difficult, given the parties’ competing\ninterests. Because this would be true regardless of when the\n\f                         SMITH V. LAUSD                              31\n\nintervention occurred, it is unrelated to timeliness, and\ncannot support a finding of prejudice under State of Oregon.\n\n    The district court also cited LAUSD’s expenditure of\nresources in transferring special education students,\nprograms, and resources to general education schools and\ncampuses. That would be relevant had Appellants failed to\nact in the face of reasonable notice from LAUSD of its plans\nto close special education centers en masse and had LAUSD\ninvested significant resources in reliance on that delay. Cf.\nSmith v. Marsh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766546\"><a href=\"/opinion/766546/katuria-e-smith-angela-rock-michael-pyle-for-themselves-and-all-others/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1045</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1052 (9th Cir. 1999) (“The\ncrucial date for assessing the timeliness of a motion to\nintervene is when proposed intervenors should have been\naware that their interests would not be adequately protected\nby the existing parties.”).\n\n     But that is not what happened here. LAUSD parents\nwere excluded from the negotiations that led to the adoption\nof Renegotiated Outcome 7 in September 2012. And in the\nyear between the adoption of Renegotiated Outcome 7 and\nits initial implementation in August 2013, Appellants were\nconsistently uninformed or misinformed as to the existence\nand true effects of Renegotiated Outcome 7. 18 The Fifth\nCircuit has recognized, and we agree, that existing parties\ncannot complain about delay or prejudice caused by their\n\n  18\n     Some parents were told that the district was merely changing the\nname of their child’s school. Others were more accurately told that their\nchild would be transferred to a general education school or campus, but\nassured that their child’s curriculum would remain the same in all\nrespects. Of course, neither of these statements were accurate given the\nnew requirement that special education center students be “integrated”\nin general education classes for lunch, recess, and 12 percent of the\ninstructional day. Nor did these statements reasonably put Appellants on\nnotice that LAUSD would be outright closing eight special education\ncenters by the end of 2014.\n\f32                         SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nown efforts to thwart the provision of meaningful notice to\naffected parties. See Stallworth, 558 F.2d at 267 (holding\nthat a district court abused its discretion in finding a motion\nto intervene untimely where an existing party had previously\nprevented notice to affected parties).\n\n     That principle has particular application here, where the\nconsequences of Renegotiated Outcome 7 were uniquely\nwithin LAUSD’s knowledge and control, given that LAUSD\nwas its implementing party. Instead of clearly apprising\naffected parents as to how LASUD intended to implement\nthe changes precipitated by Renegotiated Outcome 7,\nLAUSD issued incomplete information throughout 2013.\nAs a result, the full extent of Renegotiated Outcome 7 was\nnot revealed until 2014 and 2015—well after Appellants’\nfiling in Fall 2013 of the supposedly untimely motion to\nintervene at issue in this appeal. 19\n\n\n\n  19\n     To illustrate, the first district-wide notice of Renegotiated Outcome\n7, the Howell Letter circulated on May 21, 2013, indicated that the\ndistrict would be developing “integration plans” to “co-locate[]” four\nspecial education centers (Banneker, Blend, McBride, and Miller) with\nfour “general education pioneer counterparts (Avalon Gardens, Van\nNess, Grand View, and Cleveland SH, respectively).” It described in\nglowing terms the district’s plans to offer integration “opportunit[ies]”\nthrough “arts,” “physical education,” and “social activities . . . to\nincrease the integration of . . . students with disabilities.” Critically, it\npromised that LAUSD would be “working with school site staff and\nfamilies to analyze the Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) of\nstudents with disabilities to determine how to most effectively increase\nthe integration of students based on their individual needs.” (emphasis\nadded). Nowhere does the May 2013 letter indicate that, just one year\nlater, LAUSD would be closing approximately half of its special\neducation centers, without any prior “working with . . . families.”\n\f                          SMITH V. LAUSD                               33\n\n     When our inquiry is properly narrowed to the prejudice\nattributable to Appellants’ delay in moving to intervene after\nthe time Appellants knew, or reasonably should have known,\nthat their interests were not being adequately represented by\nexisting parties, the prejudice to existing parties becomes\nnominal at best. Indeed, neither the district court nor\nLAUSD has pointed to any evidence whatsoever of\nadditional costs or other prejudice suffered between August\n2013 and October 2013. The district court accordingly\nabused its discretion in concluding that this factor weighed\nagainst intervention.\n\n   3. Reason for and Length of the Intervenor’s Delay\n\n    For the reasons already explained above, the district\ncourt erred to the extent it measured the length of\nAppellants’ delay by reference to events pre-dating the time\nat which Proposed Intervenors were reasonably on notice\n\n\n     The rhetoric used in the May 2013 letter can be sharply contrasted\nwith the notice provided to parents in 2014—notably, after the motion to\nintervene at issue in this appeal was filed. Letters sent to parents of\nstudents at various special education centers in February of 2014, for\nexample, state that all the “teachers, assistants and classroom materials\nare expected to re-locate” from various special education centers to\ngeneral education campuses. See Lee RJN Exh. A (Letter to Banneker\nparents); see also id. Exh. B (Letter to parents of students attending Lull\nSpecial Education Center); Exh. C (Letter to parents of students\nattending Perez Special Education Center); Exh. E (Letter to parents of\nBanneker and Doyle special education centers, explaining that “[t]he\ndistrict . . . has decided to continue transitioning the Special Education\nSchools to Career Transition Centers. For the 2014–2015 school year,\nthe Special Education Schools becoming Career Transition Centers are:\nBanneker, Salvin, Willenberg, Marlton, Leichman, and Perez . . . . This\ntransition means that our 7–11 graders will be relocated to other\ncampuses.”). Whatever “co-location” was supposed to mean, see supra,\nn.8 that term had served its purpose; by 2014, it disappeared.\n\f34                    SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nthat their interests were not being adequately represented,\nsee Smith, 194 F.3d at 1052—and certainly to the extent the\ncourt relied on events predating the change in circumstances\nthat prompted Appellants’ current motion to intervene. In\nState of Oregon, for example, the “changed circumstances”\ngiving rise to the motion to intervene occurred “in 1982\nwhen two of the Tribes gave notice of their intent to\nwithdraw from the Plan or to renegotiate it.” State of\nOregon, 745 F.2d at 552. Yet the proposed intervenors did\nnot file until late August 1983. Id. Despite at least an eight-\nmonth delay (the opinion is not clear as to when in 1982 the\ntribes gave the notice referenced above nor when the State\nof Idaho received that notice), we held that the “reason for\nand length of delay” factor weighed in favor of intervention.\nId.     Similarly here, Appellants moved to intervene\napproximately one year after the change in circumstances\nprompting their motion but, as discussed below, only weeks\nafter definitively learning that their interests were not\nadequately represented by the existing parties.\n\n    Here, not only was the district court’s analysis contrary\nto law, it was contrary to the record before the court. For\nexample, the district court concluded that Appellants\n“arguably have been on notice from the very beginning of\nthis litigation.” But how can that be true when many of the\nProposed Intervenors’ children had not even been born at the\ninception of the litigation, let alone been born disabled?\n\n    The district court alternatively suggested that Proposed\nIntervenors have been on notice of this action since 2002,\nwhen a group of parents served Class Counsel with an earlier\nmotion to intervene. The court’s conclusions are logically\nfallacious because most of the Proposed Intervenors did not\neven have children enrolled in LAUSD in 2002—much less\n\f                         SMITH V. LAUSD                             35\n\nin 1993 when this litigation commenced. 20 Appellants could\nnot possibly have been on notice that their interests were not\nadequately represented prior to having any interest in this\nlitigation at all. The district court’s analysis therefore\nincorrectly conflated the knowledge of an entirely different\ngroup of parents with Appellants’ knowledge.\n\n    Nor should the fact that “the inclusion of special\neducation students into the general education program has\nbeen a primary issue from the beginning of this case” have\nplaced Appellants on notice that intervention was necessary\nto protect their interests prior to 2013. Both the 1996\nConsent Decree and the 2003 MCD specifically required\nLAUSD to maintain special education centers throughout\nthe district as placement options for moderately to severely\ndisabled children. Consistent with this mandate, LAUSD\ncontinued to operate approximately the same number of\nspecial education centers throughout the district from 1993\nto 2013. That LAUSD continued to offer placement in\nspecial education centers despite decades of discussions\nabout greater integration of disabled children in the general\neducation environment only contradicts the lower court’s\nconclusion that the same discussions should have placed\nAppellants on notice that LAUSD planned to start closing\nspecial education centers en masse in 2013 and 2014—an\n\n  20\n     Appellant Lee’s and Ayapana’s children were 14 years old in\nOctober 2013, making them only 4 in 2003. Appellant Moreno’s\ndaughter and Appellant J. Flores’ son were 10 years old in October 2013,\nmeaning they were newborns in 2003. The only potential exception is\nLinda Buschini (a member of the April Munoz Proposed Intervenors),\nwho was a member of the parent group who sought to intervene in 2002.\nEven so, Buschini’s involvement in 2002 could not reasonably have\nplaced her on notice of the change in circumstances that occurred in\n2012, given that the 2003 MCD specifically guaranteed the retention of\nspecial education centers.\n\f36                        SMITH V. LAUSD\n\naction expressly prohibited by both the MCD and the\nConsent Decree. Indeed, if anything, statements that\nLAUSD was engaged in “discussions” to achieve greater\ncompliance with the MCD would have only reinforced\nAppellants’ belief that LAUSD planned to continue to offer\nspecial education centers as part of the “full continuum” of\nservices available to disabled students in LAUSD. LAUSD\nnow takes the position that the MCD does not require it to\nmaintain any particular number of special education centers,\nand therefore its actions violate neither the MCD nor any\ngoverning law. LAUSD’s argument misses the point. The\nquestion before us is whether Appellants were reasonably on\nnotice that their interest in maintaining special education\ncenters as placement options for their children was not being\nadequately represented by the existing parties to the Chanda\nSmith litigation. We conclude that they were not on notice,\nbecause Appellants reasonably construed the MCD as\nensuring the maintenance of the special education centers\ntheir children attended. The district court therefore erred in\nreaching a contrary conclusion. 21\n\n\n\n 21\n    Specifically, the district court cited a statement in the Independent\nMonitor’s October 5, 2011 Annual Report that meeting one aspect of\nModified Outcome 7 “would require the arbitrary transfer of a significant\nnumber of [multiple disabilities orthopedic] students. The Parties are\ncurrently engaged in discussions to find a solution to this problem.” But\nin context, this statement undercuts the district court’s conclusion. The\nIndependent Monitor certainly was not advocating the “arbitrary”\ntransfer of students; indeed, that would be contrary to the IDEA’s IEP\nrequirement. Thus, the Independent Monitor’s statement could not\nreasonably be construed as notice that LAUSD intended to start\n“arbitrarily” transferring special education students to general education\nschools and campuses.           Moreover, the Independent Monitor’s\nacknowledgement that LAUSD had again failed to meet Outcome 7 was\nnothing new. LAUSD had never met any version of Outcome 7; this\n\f                          SMITH V. LAUSD                              37\n\n     In short, only the district court’s finding that Appellants\nvariously received some form of notice in April, May, or\nJune of 2013 is reasonably supported by the record. Even\nso, as discussed above, Appellants had not been privy to the\nnegotiations that led to Renegotiated Outcome 7, and the\ninitial information promulgated by LAUSD as to the\npractical effects of Renegotiated Outcome 7 was incomplete.\nAppellants therefore convincingly urge that they did not\nrealize until the August 5, 2013 meeting with Class Counsel\nthat their interests were not being adequately represented by\nthe existing parties to the Chanda Smith Litigation. The\ndistrict court even conceded that this “could constitute a\nproper explanation for [Appellants’] delay—at least until\nAugust 5, 2013.” We have no reason to disturb the court’s\nfinding in this regard.\n\n    However, the district court then proceeded to find no\nvalid excuse for Appellants’ additional delays of 71 and 79\ndays, respectively, between the August 5, 2013 meeting and\nthe October 15 and 23, 2013 filing dates of the motions to\nintervene. We again reject the district court’s analysis as\ncontrary to law and an abuse of discretion in light of the\nrecord in this case. Where—as here—both the first and\nsecond timeliness factors weigh in favor of intervention, we\nhave found motions to be timely even in the face of longer\ndelays than are present here. 22 See, e.g., State of Oregon,\n745 F.2d at 552.\n\n\nprolonged failure is what led to numerous renegotiations of that\nOutcome.\n  22\n     The off-point and non-binding authorities cited by the district court\ndo not counsel otherwise; those cases merely found unexcused delays of\nfour and five months, respectively, to weigh against a finding of\n\f38                     SMITH V. LAUSD\n\n     More importantly, the totality of the circumstances here\ndemonstrates that Appellants’ delay in filing between\nAugust and October of 2013 was justified. It bears noting,\nfirst of all, that only one Appellant (Munoz) appears to have\nbeen present at the August 2013 meetings. And in any event,\nthe record is replete with evidence that—perhaps in no small\npart due to the rosy language in which the changes were\nportrayed by LAUSD—Appellants reasonably did not\nappreciate the full import of Renegotiated Outcome 7,\nincluding the changes to their children’s curricula and\nlearning environments, until classes actually began in\nAugust of 2013, see, e.g., Moreno Decl. ¶ 3; J. Flores Decl.\n¶¶ 9, 11; Buschini Decl. ¶ 8; Aguilar Decl. ¶ 4; Pineda Decl.\n(explaining that Pineda did not realize the safety risk the new\nlearning environment posed to Pineda’s autistic son, V.P.,\nuntil V.P. was found “walking alone a mile from the school”\ndue to understaffing in V.P.’s classroom and the lack of\nspecial safety features at V.P.’s new general education\ncampus), or until their children began coming home from\nschool with injuries, see, e.g., J. Flores Decl. ¶ 11, Exh. C\n(photographs of injuries); A. Flores Decl. ¶ 6; Hernandez\nDecl. ¶¶ 3–4, Exh. E (photographs of injuries); Chamu Decl.\n¶ 6. Many parents initially attempted informal resolution of\ntheir disagreement with LAUSD as to their child’s\nplacement. See, e.g., Chamu Decl. ¶¶ 6, 10; J. Flores Decl.\n¶ 10; Buschini Decl. ¶ 13. Several parents attended a\nmeeting on September 9, 2013, at which they inquired about\nthe new placement of their children. Even after it became\nclear that intervention was necessary to protect Appellants’\ninterests, it simply took time to organize and gather evidence\nto support Appellants’ motions to intervene. Appellants are\n\ntimeliness. See Key Bank of Puget Sound v. Alaskan Harvester, 738 F.\nSupp. 398, 405 (W.D. Wash. 1989); Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v.\nBreznay, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">683</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

See Stallworth,\n558 F.2d at 264 (explaining that the “size and sophistication\nof the would-be intervenor”—in that case, the NAACP—\nwas a relevant factor in determining timeliness). At least one\nAppellant required translation services to prepare the\ndeclaration submitted in support of one of the motions to\nintervene. See Chamu Decl., Translator’s Declaration.\nTaken together, the district court’s conclusion that\nAppellants had offered no valid excuse or explanation for\ntheir delay was contrary to the record and clearly erroneous.\nThe district court therefore committed legal error in failing\nto find that the third timeliness factor weighs in favor of\nintervention.\n\n    Notwithstanding our holding today, we emphasize that\nthis factor cannot be distilled into a bright-line rule. That is,\na delay of 71 or 79 days might, under different\ncircumstances, weigh against timeliness. We merely hold\ntoday that, in light of all the circumstances presented here,\nthe district court abused its discretion in failing to recognize\nthat Appellants have justified their failure to move to\nintervene prior to mid-October 2013.\n\n    Because all three factors weigh in favor of timeliness,\nAppellants have established the first element for intervention\nas a matter of right.\n\n                  C. Protectable Interest\n\n    Second, Appellants must show that they have a\nprotectable interest in the Chanda Smith Litigation. LAUSD\ndoes not challenge the district court’s finding that Appellants\nhave a protectable interest in receiving a free appropriate\npublic education in conformity with their children’s IEPs.\n\f40                        SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nSee 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)(A); Cal. Ed.

Practical Impairment\n\n    Third, Appellants must show that they are so situated that\nthe disposition of the action without Appellants may as a\npractical matter impair or impede their ability to safeguard\ntheir protectable interest. As an alternative basis for denying\nAppellants’ motion to intervene, the district court found that\nAppellants would “not suffer a practical impairment of their\ninterest in receiving a FAPE in accordance with their IEPs\nbecause the adoption of [Renegotiated] Outcome 7 does not\ndeprive [Appellants] of special education centers as\nplacement options or violate the IEP assessment process.”\nAs a preliminary matter, we note that this statement is at least\npartly contradicted by the record: A number of LAUSD’s\nformer special education centers are no longer accepting\nenrollment of Appellants’ children and similarly situated\ndisabled students ages 6 to 18.\n\n    More to the point, the district court reasoned that denying\nintervention would not practically impair Appellants’\nprotectable interest, given the availability of individual,\nadministrative due process proceedings for parents who\ndisagree with LAUSD’s placement of their child. See Cal.\nEd. Code § 56501, et seq. 23 We review the district court’s\n\n 23\n     Notably, the MCD “preclu[des] . . . any class member [from]\nbringing any class action claim . . . concerning the District’s compliance\nwith IDEA or . . . concerning the provision of a free appropriate public\nschool education.” The MCD carves out a few exceptions, including for\nadministrative proceedings “to review the District’s compliance with its\nobligation to provide a free appropriate public education to any\n\f                         SMITH V. LAUSD                              41\n\nfinding of no practical impairment to the putative class\naction intervenors because of the availability of individual\nremedies de novo, FFRF, 644 F.3d at 840, and conclude that\nthe district court erred.\n\n     Courts have long recognized the benefits conferred by\nthe class action mechanism over numerous individual\nactions. Class actions are used to “vindicate[e] . . . the rights\nof groups of people who individually would be without\neffective strength to bring their opponents into court at all.”\nAmchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118142\"><a href=\"/opinion/118142/amchem-products-inc-v-windsor/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 617\n(1997). Particularly where, as here, injunctive relief is\nsought, “[e]conomic reality dictates” that many challenges\nto LAUSD’s placement of disabled children must “proceed\nas a class action or not at all.” Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109050\"><a href=\"/opinion/109050/eisen-v-carlisle-jacquelin/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 161 (1974). In fact, a determination that the\nclass action vehicle provides a superior mechanism for\nlitigating LAUSD’s district-wide policies regarding the\neducation of its disabled student population was already\nmade at the commencement of the Chanda Smith\nLitigation—itself a class action. The denial of intervention\nhere permits the Chanda Smith plaintiffs to pursue their\neducation policy goals with the benefit of the class action\nmechanism, while denying Appellants the same. This result\ndoes—as a practical matter—impair Appellants’ ability to\nsafeguard the interests of a sub-class of LAUSD students\nseeking retention of special education centers as placement\noptions vis-à-vis Class Counsel’s and LAUSD’s interest in\neliminating them. The impairment is especially perverse\ngiven that Appellants currently have children enrolled in\n\nindividual student.” (emphasis added). However, as members of the\nChanda Smith class, Appellants are precluded by the MCD from\nbringing a separate class action challenging the legality of Renegotiated\nOutcome 7.\n\f42                        SMITH V. LAUSD\n\nLAUSD, while the named Chanda Smith plaintiffs’ children\nhave long since left.\n\n     Not only are individual administrative challenges a\ncomparatively inefficient and ineffective means of achieving\nsystem-wide relief, 24 but the administrative proceedings\npermit Appellants to challenge only the effects of\nRenegotiated Outcome 7 on individual students—not the\nlegality of Renegotiated Outcome 7 itself. See Cal. Educ.\nCode § 56501 (due process hearings are available to resolve\ndisagreements as to the proper placement of an individual\nchild). A collateral challenge on Renegotiated Outcome 7 is\nan inferior means of protecting the interests of LAUSD’s\nspecial education center population. Even if Appellants and\nevery single special education student transferred to a\ngeneral education campus pursuant to Renegotiated\nOutcome 7 to date were able successfully to challenge that\nplacement through the administrative process, and even to\nsecure a court order requiring LAUSD to reopen each child’s\nspecial education center, Renegotiated Outcome 7 would\nstill mandate a 33 percent reduction in the opportunity for\nenrollment in special education centers. Thus, it would still\nrequire LAUSD to identify and transfer 33 percent of the\nspecial education center student population to general\neducation schools, in effect creating a revolving door of\ntransfers between special and general education campuses.\n\n   Of course, it is unlikely that all parents will undertake the\ntime and monetary investment necessary to challenge\nLAUSD’s placement of their child. But that fact, again,\n\n 24\n      Practical considerations, including the allocation of limited\nresources such as teachers and curriculum materials, also favor direct\nintervention in the litigation that has led to the adoption of an allegedly\nunlawful policy, rather than piecemeal efforts to avoid its effects.\n\f                      SMITH V. LAUSD                        43\n\nleads us to conclude that the interests of the sub-class\nAppellants seek to represent would be practically impaired\nif intervention is denied and parents of special education\nstudents are limited to individual challenges to LAUSD’s\nplacement of their children. We accordingly hold that\nAppellants’ interest in ensuring the availability of special\neducation centers to LAUSD students (to the extent\nconsistent with IEP and FAPE requirements) would, as a\npractical matter, be impaired if intervention is denied and\nAppellants are precluded from directly challenging the\nlegality of Renegotiated Outcome 7 in the Chanda Smith\nLitigation. To the extent there is any doubt as to Appellants’\nestablishment of this factor, our resolution of it in favor of\nintervention is consistent with the rule that “the requirements\nfor intervention are [to be] broadly interpreted in favor of\nintervention.” Alisal Water Corp., 370 F.3d at 919.\n\n              E. Inadequate Representation\n\n    There is no dispute that Appellants’ interests are\ninadequately represented by the parties to this action: The\ncurrent parties’ interest in transferring students and\nresources from special education centers to general\neducation campuses is diametrically opposed to Appellants’\ninterest in retaining the system that was in place prior to\nRenegotiated Outcome 7. We have no difficulty finding this\nelement met. Cf. Trbovich v. United Mine Workers of Am.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108434\"><a href=\"/opinion/108434/trbovich-v-mine-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538 n.10 (1972) (noting that the fourth\nelement of Rule 24(a) intervention requires only a “minimal”\nshowing that existing parties’ representation “may be”\ninadequate).\n\f44                   SMITH V. LAUSD\n\n                            III.\n\n    In sum, Appellants have established all four elements of\nintervention as of right under Rule 24(a).\n\n   We accordingly REVERSE the district court’s denial of\nAppellants’ motion to intervene and REMAND for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\f</pre>",
