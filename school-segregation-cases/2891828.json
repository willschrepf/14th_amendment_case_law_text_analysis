We will affirm the District Court’s orders.\n\n              The record reflects that Henderson was standing in line for medication at\n\nthe prison infirmary when Corrections Officer Brenda Rippey asked her whether she was\n\nwearing her state-issued brown t-shirt. Henderson replied that she was and opened her\n\ncoat to show Rippey the t-shirt. According to Henderson, she asked Rippey her name and\n\nthen entered the infirmary to receive her medication without incident. Rippey, however,\n\nstates that Henderson ran towards her in a threatening manner with her fists clenched and\n\nscreamed, “What the hell is your name? I’m f------ sick of this s—.” Rippey states that\n\nshe believed Henderson was going to assault her, and that she ordered Henderson several\n\ntimes to get her medication and return to her housing unit.\n\n              Rippey filed a misconduct report charging Henderson with threatening an\n\nemployee or his family with bodily harm, using abusive, obscene, or inappropriate\n\nlanguage to an employee, and refusing to obey an order. L.S. Kerns-Barr conducted a\n\ndisciplinary hearing. Kerns-Barr’s report reflects that Henderson pleaded not guilty and\n\nprovided her version of the incident.1 Kerns-Barr denied Henderson’s requests to have\n\nRippey appear and to present witnesses, noting that they were not necessary to establish\n\nHenderson’s guilt or innocence. Kerns-Barr viewed a video of the incident, but she found\n\nthe video inconclusive. Kerns-Barr credited Rippey’s written report and found\n\n\n   1\n    The hearing report reflects that Henderson stated that, after she showed Rippey her t-\nshirt, the officer thanked her. Henderson stated that she and Rippey had an exchange of\npleasant words, but she did tell Rippey “she was not welcome.” Def. Statement of\nMaterial Facts, Ex. C.\n\n                                             2\n\fHenderson guilty. Henderson received 90 days in disciplinary custody. Her\n\nadministrative appeals were unsuccessful.\n\n              Henderson then filed a civil rights action against Kerns-Barr and Rippey\n\nalleging that she was not guilty of the charges, that she was unable to present witnesses at\n\nher hearing, and that she was denied her medication while in disciplinary custody. The\n\nDistrict Court construed Henderson’s complaint as asserting violations of her due process\n\nand Eighth Amendment rights. The District Court granted the defendants’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment, and denied Henderson’s subsequent motion for reconsideration. This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n              We agree with the District Court that summary judgment was warranted on\n\nHenderson’s due process claim because her 90-day disciplinary confinement did not\n\nimplicate a liberty interest. See Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995) (holding that\n\nprisoner’s disciplinary segregation did not deprive him of a cognizable liberty interest\n\nwhere confinement did not impose an atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in\n\nrelation to the ordinary incidents of prison life). Although Henderson attested that the\n\nmisconduct report caused her parole to be “held up,” as recognized by the District Court,\n\nshe provided no evidence showing that her release date was affected.2\n\n              Summary judgment also was warranted on Henderson’s Eighth Amendment\n\n\n   2\n    Because Henderson was not entitled to the procedural protections set forth in Wolff v.\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974), we find it unnecessary to address the District Court’s\nfurther conclusion that Henderson’s hearing satisfied all constitutional mandates. See\nSandin, 515 U.S. at 487.\n\n                                             3\n\fclaim based on the denial of medication while in disciplinary custody. The District Court\n\ncorrectly concluded that Henderson did not establish – or even claim – that either Rippey\n\nor Kerns-Barr was personally involved in her medical care. Rode v. Dellarciprete, 845\n\nF.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988). Finally, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying Henderson’s motion for reconsideration.\n\n              Accordingly, because this appeal does not raise a substantial question, we\n\nwill affirm the District Court’s orders.3\n\n\n\n\n   3\n   Henderson’s motions for appointment of counsel are denied. See Tabron v. Grace, 6\nF.3d 147, 155 (3d Cir. 1993) (requiring claim to appear to have some merit in fact and\nlaw before counsel will be appointed).\n\n                                             4\n\f",
