Held: Under the\ncircumstances of this case, the penalty of life imprisonment without the possibil-\nity of parole was not unconstitutionally disproportionate under Article I, section\n16, of the Oregon Constitution.\n    The decision of the Court of Appeals and the judgment of the circuit court\nare affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n______________\n\t   *  On appeal from Washington County Circuit Court, Andrew Erwin, Judge.\n273 Or App 654, 362 P3d 251 (2015).\n\fCite as 360 Or 392 (2016)\t393\n\n\t          BREWER, J.\n\t        Defendant seeks review of a sentence of life impris-\nonment without the possibility of parole, imposed pursuant\nto ORS 137.719(1), for a conviction for first-degree sexual\nabuse. Defendant argues that, as applied to his circum-\nstances, the sentence is unconstitutionally disproportionate\nunder Article I, section 16, of the Oregon Constitution, which\nprovides in part that “all penalties shall be proportioned to\nthe offense.” The Court of Appeals rejected that challenge,\nState v. Sokell, 273 Or App 654, 362 P3d 251 (2015), and\ndefendant petitioned for review, which we allowed.1 For the\nreasons explained below, we affirm the judgment of the cir-\ncuit court and the decision of the Court of Appeals that the\nsentence did not violate Article I, section 16.2\n          I.  FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nA.  Current Conviction\n\t       The crime for which defendant stands convicted in\nthe present case is first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427,\nbased on a charge that defendant subjected a child under\nthe age of 14 to sexual contact by touching her buttocks and\nhips. The offense took place at a public library in Hillsboro\nin 2011. The victim, an eight-year-old girl, was looking\nat books when defendant, a stranger, approached her and\ntalked to her about books. He then stroked the victim on the\nbuttocks and hips for several minutes, over her clothing, and\nfled when her mother approached. Police obtained a video\nfrom the library that showed the suspect, but they were\nunable to determine his identity at that time. The following\nsummer, defendant returned to the children’s section of the\n\n\t1\n       Defendant also argues that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence\nparts of a presentence investigation report that contained hearsay and that the\nsentence violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\nHowever, defendant did not raise those arguments in the Court of Appeals; we\ntherefore do not consider them. See ORAP 9.20(2) (questions before the Supreme\nCourt include all questions that were properly before the Court of Appeals that\nthe petition or response claim were incorrectly decided).\n\t2\n       As an initial matter, we note that the disproportionality challenge raised\nby defendant is reviewable. See State v. Althouse, 359 Or 668, 678, 375 P3d 475\n(2016) (holding that ORS 138.222(2)(a) does not preclude review of sentence of life\nimprisonment without possibility of parole imposed pursuant to ORS 137.719);\nState v. Davidson, 360 Or 370, ___ P3d ___ (2016) (same).\n\f394\t                                            State v. Sokell\n\nsame library, and an employee recognized him as the sus-\npect and was able to photograph his vehicle’s license plate,\nafter which the police identified defendant as the suspect.\nBased on that evidence, a jury convicted defendant of the\ncharged offense.\n\t        The state presented evidence at sentencing that\nthe victim was traumatized by the crime, was unwilling to\nbe out of the presence of her parents, needed to be home\nschooled for a significant period of time after the crime was\ncommitted, and was unable to sleep in her own bed alone for\napproximately two years after the crime.\nB.  Other Convictions\n\t        At defendant’s sentencing in this case, the following\nevidence was adduced concerning his criminal history. In\n1996, defendant was convicted of first-degree sexual abuse.\nIn that case, defendant approached a 12-year-old child in\na store and asked her to try on a backpack that he said he\nwas considering purchasing for his niece. As the child tried\non the backpack, defendant adjusted the shoulder straps\nand then stroked and squeezed the child’s breasts. He was\napprehended at the store and admitted that he had deliber-\nately touched the child’s breasts. That conviction resulted in\na 75-month prison sentence.\n\t         While defendant was on supervision after serving\nhis prison sentence for the 1996 offense, he failed several\npolygraph examinations and served a jail sanction for having\ncontact with a minor. The Board of Parole and Post-Prison\nSupervision designated him as a predatory sex offender in\n2003. While on supervision, defendant told his parole officer\nthat he had committed similar offenses in another state, tar-\ngeting victims who were between seven and 12 years of age.\nHe admitted during a polygraph examination that he had\nforcibly raped a 10-year-old girl in 1980. He told his therapist\nthat he had had more than 120 underage victims and that\nhe had sodomized a female hitchhiker at knifepoint in the\n1970s. He told another mental health professional during\nan evaluation that, in the 1990s, he had approached young\ngirls in stores with the pretense of having them try some-\nthing on, so that he could touch them. Defendant received\nsex offender treatment three times between 1983 and 2005,\n\fCite as 360 Or 392 (2016)\t395\n\nwhen he most recently completed treatment. Despite his\ncompletion of a program in 2005, he was still considered to\nbe at high risk of re-offending, given his history.\n\t         In June 2012, before he was apprehended for the\ncrime at issue here, defendant committed a similar offense\nin a public library in Newport. He approached a seven-year-\nold girl and asked her to help him find a book. He then put\nhis hand under her dress and rubbed his hands on her sides\nand crotch area, and told her that rubbing her was a “good\nfeeling.” A librarian saw defendant with his hand up the\ngirl’s dress and, as defendant was leaving, alerted other peo-\nple in the library to stop him. Defendant was apprehended\nand convicted of attempted first-degree sexual abuse based\non that incident, for which he was sentenced to 18 months’\nimprisonment.\nC.  Sentence and Appeal\n\t        Based on the foregoing evidence and his conviction\nfor the current offense, the trial court sentenced defendant to\nthe presumptive sentence established by ORS 137.719(1)—\nlife imprisonment without the possibility of parole. On\nappeal, defendant argued that, in light of asserted mitigat-\ning circumstances, the trial court should have imposed a\ndownward departure sentence pursuant to ORS 137.719(2)\nand that the imposition of the presumptive sentence under\nORS 137.719(1) violated Article I, section 16. As noted, the\nCourt of Appeals rejected those arguments, and defendant\npetitioned for review, which we allowed.\n                         II. ANALYSIS\n\t        ORS 137.719 provides:\n    \t “(1)  The presumptive sentence for a sex crime that\n    is a felony is life imprisonment without the possibility of\n    release or parole if the defendant has been sentenced for\n    sex crimes that are felonies at least two times prior to the\n    current sentence.\n    \t “(2)  The court may impose a sentence other than the\n    presumptive sentence provided by subsection (1) of this sec-\n    tion if the court imposes a departure sentence authorized\n    by the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission\n    based upon findings of substantial and compelling reasons.\n\f396\t                                              State v. Sokell\n\n   \t   “(3)  For purposes of this section:\n   \t “(a)  Sentences for two or more convictions that are\n   imposed in the same sentencing proceeding are considered\n   to be one sentence; and\n   \t   “(b)  A prior sentence includes:\n   \t “(A)  Sentences imposed before, on or after July 31,\n   2001; and\n   \t “(B)  Sentences imposed by any other state or federal\n   court for comparable offenses.\n   \t “(4)  As used in this section, ‘sex crime’ has the mean-\n   ing given that term in ORS 163A.005.”\n\tIn Althouse, 359 Or 668, we set out a framework\nfor the evaluation of as-applied proportionality challenges\nto sentences imposed pursuant to ORS 137.719(1). We\nexplained that the factors identified by this court in State\nv. Rodriguez/Buck, 347 Or 46, 217 P3d 659 (2009), are to be\nconsidered:\n   “ ‘(1) a comparison of the severity of the penalty and the\n   gravity of the crime; (2) a comparison of the penalties\n   imposed for other, related crimes; and (3) the criminal his-\n   tory of the defendant.’ ”\nAlthouse, 359 Or at 684 (quoting Rodriguez/Buck, 347 Or at\n58). We went on to observe that, where a challenged sentence\nwas imposed pursuant to a recidivist statute such as ORS\n137.719, the first and third Rodriguez/Buck factors are con-\nsidered together. Althouse, 359 Or at 685. We thus initially\nexamine the gravity of defendant’s crime as compared to the\nseverity of the penalty, and defendant’s criminal history.\n\t        Considering those initial factors, defendant argues\nthat a life sentence without the possibility of parole for his\ncurrent offense is unconstitutionally disproportionate.\nRelying on Rodriguez/Buck, defendant asserts that the\ndegree of harm caused by first-degree sexual abuse is less\nthan the typical harm caused by other sex offenses that\nare subject to ORS 137.719(1), such as forcible first-degree\nrape. He also argues that three mitigating factors—\nsomewhat related to his criminal history—indicate that\nhis sentence is disproportionate. First, he asserts that\n\fCite as 360 Or 392 (2016)\t397\n\nhis status as a Vietnam-era military veteran is a mitigat-\ning factor.3 He further argues that the fact that his three\nsexual abuse convictions occurred over a span of 17 years\nshould be regarded as a mitigating factor, as should his\nadvanced age (he was 69 years old when he committed the\ntwo most recent offenses). Finally, defendant notes, as we\nrecognized today in State v. Davidson, 360 Or 370, 387,\n__ P3d __ (2016), that the penalty under ORS 137.719(1)—\nlife imprisonment without the possibility of parole—is\nthe second most severe criminal penalty available under\nOregon law.\n\t        Initially, we disagree with defendant’s assessment\nof the gravity of his current offense. Although Rodriguez/\nBuck, like this case, involved convictions for first-degree\nsexual abuse, and this court held that mandatory minimum\nsentences imposed pursuant to ORS 137.700 were unconsti-\ntutionally disproportionate under the circumstances there,\nthat case does not stand for the proposition that first-degree\nsexual abuse should be regarded as a minor sex offense. The\nconvictions in those cases involved fleeting touching—not\nincluding fondling—of young teens over their clothing. 347\nOr at 50-52, 70. The court noted that the offense of first-\ndegree sexual abuse encompasses a “wide swath of conduct”\nthat can result in varying degrees of harm. Id. at 69-70.\nThe court contrasted the defendants’ conduct in those cases\nto circumstances in which there was touching of a younger\nchild or where there was deliberate or persistent rubbing or\nfondling. Id. at 72.\n\t         Defendant’s conduct in this case bears little resem-\nblance to the conduct at issue in Rodriguez/Buck. While it is\npossible that, under some circumstances, first-degree sexual\nabuse might not cause extremely serious harm to a victim,\nthat is not the circumstance here. Defendant’s victim was\na young child whom he targeted while she was in a public\nlibrary, then fondled on the buttocks and hips for several\nminutes. The state presented evidence that the victim suf-\nfered from severe trauma that affected her school and home\nlife for years after the abuse occurred. In short, we disagree\nwith defendant’s assertion that the gravity-of-the-offense\n\t3\n     Defendant does not elaborate on the relevance of that circumstance.\n\f398\t                                           State v. Sokell\n\nfactor identified in Rodriguez/Buck weighs in his favor in a\ndisproportionality analysis.\n\t        Because defendant was sentenced under a recidi-\nvist statute, we also attach considerable significance to his\ncriminal history. See Davidson, 360 Or at 382. That is so\nbecause the constitutionality of an enhanced sentence based\non recidivism depends, in part, on the “ ‘seriousness of repet-\nitive sexual conduct’ ” and “ ‘the danger that it forecasts for\nothers unless the defendant is segregated from society.’ ”\nAlthouse, 359 Or at 586 (quoting Jensen v. Gladden, 231 Or\n141, 144-45, 372 P2d 183 (1962)). In Althouse, we rejected\na proportionality challenge by a defendant who was sen-\ntenced under ORS 137.719(1) for public indecency, which we\nacknowledged could be viewed as “not as serious as some\nother sex crimes.” 359 Or at 687. We nevertheless upheld\nthe presumptive true-life sentence imposed in that case, in\nlight of the defendant’s significant history of sexual abuse,\nsodomy, and public indecency, much of which involved and\ntargeted child victims. Id.\n\t        This case, like Althouse, features a defendant who\nhas an extensive history of committing sexual abuse offenses\nagainst young children, and each of his offenses included\nfondling of the victim’s private parts. Despite the consid-\nerable sex offender treatment that defendant has received\nover the course of several decades, he has continued to\nre-offend. Rather than mitigate the circumstances of his\ncurrent offense, the passage of time and defendant’s advanc-\ning age have failed to diminish the danger that he poses\nto children; as noted, defendant was 69 years old when he\ncommitted each of his last two felony sex crimes. Contrary\nto defendant’s view, we conclude that his criminal history\nand the circumstances of his current crime indicate that he\nwould pose a significant danger to children in the commu-\nnity if he is not segregated from society.\n\t        The remaining Rodriguez/Buck factor involves\ncomparison of the penalty here with penalties imposed for\nother, related crimes. 347 Or at 58. Crimes that are rele-\nvant to our analysis include other offenses designated as\n“sex crimes” that are subject to enhanced sentences under\nORS 137.719(1), as well as the offenses identified as sexual\n\fCite as 360 Or 392 (2016)\t399\n\noffenses in ORS chapter 163. See Davidson, 360 Or at 388-\n90; Rodriguez/Buck, 347 Or at 64-65. An extensive reitera-\ntion of the penalties for other sex offenses under Oregon law\nis not required here, in light of our previous decisions that\nhave discussed those penalties at length. See, e.g., Davidson,\n360 Or at 388-90; Althouse, 359 Or at 690-91; Rodriguez/\nBuck, 347 Or at 74-76. Suffice it to say that the penalties\nfor committing physical sexual offenses against young child\nvictims are uniformly significant under Oregon law, gener-\nally carrying mandatory minimum sentences under ORS\n137.700 and being ranked in the highest three crime catego-\nries under the Oregon Sentencing Guidelines. See, e.g., OAR\n213-017-002 - 213-017-0011.\n\t        As defendant observes, and as was the circumstance\nin Althouse, the sentence imposed in this case is the sec-\nond harshest criminal penalty under Oregon law. However,\nin light of the circumstances of defendant’s current offense\nand his history of committing similar offenses against other\nyoung children, we conclude that the sentence of life impris-\nonment without the possibility of parole that the trial court\nimposed pursuant to ORS 137.719(1) is not disproportionate\nunder Article I, section 16.\n\t       The decision of the Court of Appeals and the judg-\nment of the circuit court are affirmed.\n\f",
