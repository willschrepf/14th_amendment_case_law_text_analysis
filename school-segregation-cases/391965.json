Francis\n          J. Foley III, judge trial referee.)\n  David J. Reich, assigned counsel, for the appellant\n(respondent father).\n  Benjamin Zivyon, assistant attorney general, with\nwhom were Susan T.

Parlato, for the minor children.\n\f                          Opinion\n\n   KELLER, J. The respondent father, Tyrone H.,\nappeals from the judgments of the trial court, Hon.\nFrancis J. Foley III, judge trial referee, terminating his\nparental rights with respect to his minor son, Jahein\nH., and minor daughter, Kyara H., pursuant to General\nStatutes § 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (i), for failure to achieve\nsuch a degree of personal rehabilitation as would\nencourage the belief that, within a reasonable time, he\ncould assume a responsible position in the lives of his\nchildren.1 On appeal, the respondent claims that the\ntrial court’s statutorily required finding that the Depart-\nment of Children and Families (department) made rea-\nsonable efforts to reunify him with his two children\nwas clearly erroneous because the department failed\nto continue to make such efforts until the date the court\nterminated parental rights. We affirm the judgments of\nthe trial court.\n   The following facts, as found by the trial court by\nclear and convincing evidence, and procedural history\nare relevant to the disposition of this appeal. Andrea\nK., the mother of Kyara and Jahein, met the respondent\nwhen she was nineteen years old and soon became\npregnant. Kyara was born on January 22, 2004. Tests\nfor the presence of substances in her system were posi-\ntive for the presence of marijuana, which Andrea admit-\nted she used throughout her pregnancy. Andrea\ntransferred guardianship of Kyara to the child’s mater-\nnal grandfather, Leander K., in whose custody Kyara\nremained for the first three years of her life.\n  Andrea gave birth to Jahein, her second child by the\nrespondent, in that same year, on November 13, 2004.\nTests revealed that Jahein also was exposed to mari-\njuana during pregnancy. Two months after Jahein’s\nbirth, the respondent was arrested for an assault upon\nAndrea. Andrea stated that the respondent left her\nshortly after this incident and thereafter, did not\nacknowledge his children in any way. The respondent\nwas later convicted of the assault and sentenced to one\nyear in jail, execution suspended, with three years of\nprobation. He later violated his probation and was incar-\ncerated.\n  From May 6, 2005, until the spring of 2006, neither\nKyara nor Jahein lived with Andrea. Kyara was residing\nwith Leander and Jahein was in foster care, having been\nremoved from Andrea’s care by the department after\nAndrea, while extremely intoxicated and holding Jah-\nein, lost her balance and fell, causing Jahein to hit his\nhead. Andrea was arrested but participated in services\nand treatment programs, enabling Jahein to be returned\nto her care by the end of 2005.\n  In the summer of 2008, Andrea met another man,\nJose M., and began a four year relationship marred by\nsubstance abuse and incidents of domestic violence.\n\fThis relationship produced three more children.\n   On March 26, 2009, when Andrea was pregnant with\nthe first of her three children by Jose, the petitioner,\nthe Commissioner of Children and Families (commis-\nsioner), sought and obtained temporary custody of\nKyara and Jahein due to their exposure to illegal sub-\nstances, domestic violence and inadequate supervision\nin Andrea’s home. Andrea and Jose participated in ser-\nvices resulting in the return of Kyara and Jahein in\nOctober, 2009, under an order of protective super-\nvision.2\n   In November, 2009, during the period of court-\nordered protective supervision for Kyara and Jahein,\nAndrea was arrested for disorderly conduct and fined\n$200. This was her third arrest. The following month,\nAndrea’s third child, Trevon, was born, with indications\nof exposure to marijuana in utero. On April 11, 2001,\nAndrea’s fourth child, Kahlil, was born, also testing\npositive for exposure to marijuana during the preg-\nnancy.3 Andrea acknowledged to the department that\nshe used marijuana and alcohol throughout this preg-\nnancy and admitted mutual domestic violence involving\nher and Jose. Andrea stated that she used marijuana\ndaily and would drink two or three times per week,\nincluding two or three forty ounce bottles of beer and\n‘‘a few shots.’’ From 2008 to 2012, while he was in a\nrelationship with Andrea and was involved in raising\nher children, Jose bought, used and possessed illegal\ndrugs. Jose reported that both he and Andrea smoked\nmarijuana three to four times a day, even during\nAndrea’s pregnancies.\n   Andrea reported that she and Jose also smoked K-2,\nan illegal, synthetic drug chemically similar to mari-\njuana. This drug can be very potent and is popular with\nmarijuana users because it does not show up on drug\nscreenings unless used within the preceding two hours\nof testing. It can produce hallucinations, severe agita-\ntion, panic attacks, dangerously elevated heart rate and\nblood pressure and seizures.\n   The trial court relied on the October 14, 2011 affidavit\nin support of the commissioner’s motion for temporary\ncustody, in which the department social worker\nMichelle Dwyer ‘‘describes an horrific and chaotic home\nlife for Andrea, Jose, the children and Andrea’s alco-\nholic father, Leander.’’ In August, 2010, Jose assaulted\nAndrea in front of Kyara, Jahein and Trevon. Kyara\nreported to the police what had happened, stating, ‘‘Jose\n. . . punched mommy and dragged her on the floor\n. . . .’’\n  On April 18, 2011, the commissioner filed neglect\npetitions on behalf of Kyara, Jahein and their two\nyounger siblings, but did not seek their removal. In\nSeptember, 2011, a behaviorist and clinician at Commu-\nnity Resources, Inc., who was providing services to\n\fAndrea, told a department social worker that Andrea\nsaid that Kyara roams the house in the middle of the\nnight, urinating in her room and that Andrea feared\nleaving Kyara and Jahein unsupervised with one\nanother because Kyara was engaging in inappropriate\nbehaviors with Jahein. During an arrest for motor vehi-\ncle charges on September 30, 2011, Andrea became so\nagitated and combative with police she had to be\nsecured in a jail cell. On October 12, 2011, a department\nsocial worker observed Trevon, then twenty-two\nmonths old, with two black eyes. Andrea and Leander\nindicated Trevon fell on a piece of furniture. The next\nday, Jose went to Andrea’s home with a friend. Andrea\nhad been drinking and continued to drink throughout\nthe afternoon and evening. Jose and Andrea then went\nto a motel with Trevon and six month old Kahlil. Jose\nreported that Andrea was so drunk she dropped Kahlil\ntwice, then left the hotel to start walking on Route 6,\nwearing no shoes and having unzipped pants. Jose\ncalled police and Andrea was arrested. The court noted\nthat two days later, on October 14, 2011, the commis-\nsioner ‘‘finally’’ sought and obtained an order of tempo-\nrary custody of all four children. For Kyara and Jahein,\nthis was their third removal from Andrea’s care.4\n    After specifically addressing Andrea and the chil-\ndren’s involvement with the department since 2004, the\ncourt, as to the respondent, found that little is known\nabout him because he refused to provide background\ninformation to the department and refused to partici-\npate in services to which the department might have\nreferred him. The trial court, referring to the respondent\nas the ‘‘male biological parent,’’ determined: ‘‘He left\nAndrea shortly after he assaulted her in January, 2005.\nHe has never served as a father, as that term is normally\nunderstood.’’ (Emphasis added.) The court further\nfound: ‘‘What is known about this man is that between\n2004 and 2010, he has been arrested nine times and\nspent a considerable amount of his adult life in prison.\nEven in prison he is not a good citizen. His Department\nof [Correction] record reflects loss of telephone privi-\nleges for thirty days, loss of recreation for fifteen days,\nand punitive segregation for seven days. . . . His arrest\nand conviction record . . . indicates that [the respon-\ndent] is a convicted felon. He has multiple arrests for\nassault, breach of peace, disorderly conduct, criminal\nimpersonation, violation of protective orders, violation\nof probation, interfering or resisting arrest and posses-\nsion of narcotics. On October 17, 2011, he received a\nfive year sentence, suspended after eighteen months\nwith [five] years of probation. He was also convicted\nof a subsequent assault and breach of peace upon his\ngirlfriend, for which he received concurrent time of one\nyear on each [offense]. This charge was a domestic\nviolence related assault on the mother of his newest\nchild. . . . [O]n July 16, 2012, he filed a motion in this\ncourt to have guardianship of Kyara and Jahein trans-\n\fferred to his new girlfriend, Kimberly B., the same\nwoman he recently assaulted. Midway through the ter-\nmination trial, [the respondent] withdrew his motion\nfor transfer of guardianship to Kimberly and thereafter,\nKimberly stopped attending the trial. His lawyer\nreported that [the respondent] now wanted the children\n‘to go to Andrea,’ their mother, instead of his girlfriend.’’\n   The respondent was released from prison in August,\n2012, just a few weeks after the petitions to terminate\nhis parental rights were filed on July 25, 2012. The court\nnoted the respondent’s shifting positions before and at\ntrial relative to the placement of children, neither of\nwhich included any plan that he personally would care\nand provide for them. Nonetheless, ‘‘[t]o give full weight\nto all the evidence,’’ the court acknowledged the respon-\ndent’s attendance at a New Perceptions sixteen class\n‘‘Treating Alcohol Dependence Program,’’ in November,\n2012. The court, to emphasize its conclusion that the\nrespondent’s lack of concern for his children was long-\nstanding and continuing, indicated, ‘‘[t]here is nothing\nin the letter from New Perceptions [submitted as\nrespondent’s Exhibit 1A that] addresses whether [the\nrespondent] ever expressed love and affection for his\nchildren; ever expressed personal concern over their\nhealth, education and general well-being; ever fulfilled\nhis duty to supply the necessary food, clothing and\nmedical care for his children; ever provided them with\nan adequate domicile; or ever provided his children\nwith social and religious guidance. The court concludes\nsince he did not visit them after his release and never\nhas provided for them before, that he did not.’’5 The\ncourt determined that the respondent is ‘‘not actively\ninvolved with Kyara and Jahein; he does not support\nthem and he does not visit them except when he is incar-\ncerated.’’\n   In the termination of parental rights petitions regard-\ning the respondent’s two children, the commissioner\nalleged that the respondent had failed to rehabilitate\nsufficiently and that termination of the parental rights\nwas in the children’s best interests. The commissioner\nalso alleged, regarding the reasonable efforts require-\nment of § 17a-112 (j) (1),6 both that the department\nhad made reasonable efforts to locate and reunify the\nrespondent with his children and that he was unable\nor unwilling to benefit from such efforts.\n   The court stated that ‘‘in the adjudicatory phase of\nthe proceedings, the judicial authority is limited to evi-\ndence of events preceding the filing of the petition or the\nlatest amendment, except, as here, where the judicial\nauthority must consider subsequent events as part of\nits determination as to the existence of a ground for\ntermination of parental rights, i.e. rehabilitation.’’ The\ncourt found by clear and convincing evidence, without\nspecifying any temporal period, that the department\nhad made reasonable efforts to locate the respondent\n\f(‘‘the parents have all been served and appeared and\nthus located’’) and that ‘‘[the department] has made\nreasonable efforts through the offer of appropriate and\navailable services to promote a reunification with the\nchildren.’’ Later, the court specifically found as to the\nrespondent that ‘‘the children, Kyara and Jahein, have\nbeen found in a prior proceeding to have been neglected\nor uncared for and the father has failed to achieve such\ndegree of personal rehabilitation that would encourage\nthe belief that within a reasonable time, considering\nthe age and needs of the children, that [the respondent]\ncould assume a responsible position [in] the life of\nthe children.’’\n   In the dispositional phase of the proceeding,7 the\ncourt set forth its findings with regard to the seven\nfactors set forth in § 17a-112 (k), first restating most of\nits adjudicatory findings regarding the respondent. It\nthen stated that ‘‘given the factual findings made in its\ndecision, compliance with § 17a-112 (k) as it relates to\nthe male biological parent [the respondent], only serves\nto re-state the obvious: [The respondent] has never\nacted as a parent and has refused any services which\nmight assist him in acquiring parental skills.’’\n  The court found by clear and convincing evidence\nthat termination of the respondent’s parental rights in\nKyara and Jahein was in their best interests after consid-\nering various factors, ‘‘including the children’s need\nfor safety, stability and nurturance; their interest in\nsustained growth, development, well-being, and in the\ncontinuity and stability of their environment . . . their\nage and individual needs; the length and nature of their\nstay in foster care, the contact maintained with their\nparents and the potential benefit or detriment to the\nchildren of terminating the parental rights, the genetic\nbond to the biological parents . . . and the seven statu-\ntory factors and the court’s findings thereon.’’ (Citations\nomitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Additional\nfacts and procedural history will be set forth as nec-\nessary.\n   We begin by setting forth the statutory requirements\nfor granting a petition for the termination of parental\nrights. ‘‘A hearing on a petition to terminate parental\nrights consists of two phases, adjudication and disposi-\ntion. . . . If the trial court determines that a statutory\nground for termination exists, it proceeds to the disposi-\ntional phase. In the dispositional phase, the trial court\ndetermines whether termination is in the best interest of\nthe child.’’ (Citation omitted; internal quotations marks\nomitted.) In re Roshawn R., 51 Conn. App. 44, 52, 720\nA.2d 1112 (1998). In the adjudicatory phase of the pro-\nceeding, the court must make separate determinations\nas to reasonable efforts and the statutory grounds for\ntermination. ‘‘In the adjudicatory phase, the judicial\nauthority is limited to evidence of events preceding the\nfiling of the petition or the latest amendment, except\n\fwhere the judicial authority must consider subsequent\nevents as part of its determination as to the existence\nof a ground for termination of parental rights. . . . In\nthe adjudicatory phase, the court may rely on events\noccurring after the date of the filing of the petition to\nterminate parental rights when considering the issue\nof whether the degree of rehabilitation is sufficient to\nforesee that the parent may resume a useful role in the\nchild’s life within a reasonable time.’’ (Citation omitted;\nemphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\nIn re Anthony H., 104 Conn. App. 744, 757–58, 936\nA.2d 638 (2007), cert. denied, 285 Conn. 920, 943 A.2d\n1100 (2008).\n   As the statutory ground for terminating the respon-\ndent’s rights, the petition alleges failure to achieve per-\nsonal rehabilitation under § 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (i). With\nrespect to the ground of failure to achieve personal\nrehabilitation, set forth in § 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (i), the\ncourt is required to find that the child (1) ‘‘has been\nfound by the Superior Court . . . to have been\nneglected or uncared for in a prior proceeding,’’ (2)\n‘‘the parent of such child has been provided specific\nsteps to take to facilitate the return of the child to the\nparent pursuant to section 46b-129,’’ and (3) the parent\n‘‘has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabili-\ntation as would encourage the belief that within a rea-\nsonable time, considering the age and needs of the child,\nsuch parent could assume a responsible position in the\nlife of the child.’’\n   A termination of parental rights under § 17a-112 (j)\non a nonconsensual ground, as has been pleaded as to\nthe respondent here, requires the court, in the adjudica-\ntory phase, to find whether there is clear and convincing\nevidence that (1) the department has made reasonable\nefforts to locate the parent; and (2) the department has\nmade reasonable efforts to reunify the child with each\nparent unless the court finds that the parent is unable\nor unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts.\n   The factual determination for the court is whether\nthe parent has achieved rehabilitation as contemplated\nunder the statute, that is, rehabilitation sufficient to\nrender the parent able to responsibly care for the child.\n‘‘Personal rehabilitation as used in [§ 17a-112 (j) (3)\n(B)] refers to the restoration of a parent to his or her\nformer constructive and useful role as a parent. . . .\n[The statute] requires the trial court to analyze the [par-\nent’s] rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of\nthe particular child, and further, that such rehabilitation\nmust be foreseeable within a reasonable time. . . .\n[The statute] requires the court to find, by clear and\nconvincing evidence, that the level of rehabilitation\n. . . achieved, if any, falls short of that which would\nreasonably encourage a belief that at some future date\n[the parent] can assume a responsible position in [the]\nchild’s life.’’ (Citations omitted; internal quotation\n\fmarks omitted.) In re Eden F., 250 Conn. 674, 706, 741\nA.2d 873 (1999).\n   An inquiry regarding personal rehabilitation requires\n‘‘a historical perspective of the respondent’s child car-\ning and parenting.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\nIn re Galen F., 54 Conn. App. 590, 594, 737 A.2d 499\n(1999); see In re Christopher B., 117 Conn. App. 773,\n786–88, 980 A.2d 961 (2009) (trial court properly relied\non respondent’s history with department prior to filing\nof most recent neglect petition); see also In re Jennifer\nW., 75 Conn. App. 485, 499, 816 A.2d 697 (court must\nmake inquiry into full history of respondent’s parenting\nabilities), cert. denied, 263 Conn. 917, 821 A.2d 770\n(2003).\n  As to the respondent, the court found by clear and\nconvincing evidence that his children had been found\nneglected in a prior proceeding, that the department\nhad made reasonable efforts to locate the respondent,\nthat the respondent had been provided with specific\nsteps on October 14, 2011, and later, on February 1,\n2012, and that the respondent had failed to achieve such\ndegree of personal rehabilitation that would encourage\nthe belief that within a reasonable time, considering\nthe age and needs of the children, he could assume a\nresponsible position in their lives.\n   The respondent does not dispute any of these find-\nings, nor does he dispute the court’s findings that it\nwas in the best interests of Kyara and Jahein that his\nparental rights be terminated. His sole claim on appeal\nfocuses on the court’s finding, by clear and convincing\nevidence, that the department had made reasonable\nefforts to reunify Kyara and Jahein with him. The court\nfound: ‘‘[The respondent] was uncooperative and did\nnot attempt to comply with any rehabilitative services\nsave the [Treating] Alcohol Dependence program,\nwhich was likely required as a condition of his release\nand probation. He has demonstrated no interest in the\nchildren and has made no sustained effort at rehabilita-\ntion. He has rebuffed all [department] overtures to\nassist him. He is entirely, unreformed.’’\n  The respondent argues that although the department\npresented evidence that he told the department on three\noccasions prior to the filing of the termination petitions\non July 25, 2012, that he was not interested in any\ndepartment services, the department was required by\nthe specific steps to continue to make efforts to refer\nthe respondent to appropriate services until the trial\nconcluded, and there was no evidence that the depart-\nment even contacted him after his release in August,\n2012, to inquire if he had changed his position of nonco-\noperation with the department or its services. The com-\nmissioner responds that the evidence reasonably\nsupports the court’s findings that the department had\nmade reasonable efforts to reunify respondent with his\nchildren, regardless of whether the trial court consid-\n\fered evidence through the date the petitions were filed,\nJuly 25, 2012, the adjudicatory date, or through the\nconclusion of trial on February 21, 2013, because the\nlaw does not require a continuation of reasonable\nefforts on the part of the department when they will\nbe futile.\n   In support of his claim, the respondent asserts that\nin accordance with § 17a-112 (j) (1), the court was\nrequired to find that the department had made reason-\nable efforts to reunify him with his children until the\ntime that the trial concluded on February 21, 2013. Next,\nthe respondent asserts that the evidence did not support\nthe court’s finding that the department made reasonable\nefforts to reunify because there is no evidence that the\ndepartment made any efforts, reasonable or otherwise,\nafter the respondent’s release from prison in August,\n2012. We will address each aspect of the claim, in turn.\n                            I\n    The respondent first argues that § 17a-112 (j) (1)\nrequires the department to continue to make reasonable\nefforts to reunify a parent with his or her child until\nthe conclusion of the trial on the termination of parental\nrights petition unless the court has found at a previous\nproceeding that, under subsection (a) of General Stat-\nutes § 17a-111b,8 such efforts are no longer appropriate.\nIn light of the circumstances of the present case, we\nneed not decide whether the respondent’s interpreta-\ntion of § 17a-112 (j) (1), which the respondent asserts\nis at odds with our case law interpreting the statute,\nis correct.\n   ‘‘As this court has noted, [t]here is a distinction\nbetween a finding on reasonable reunification efforts\nunder § 17a-112 (j) and consideration of the same under\n§ 17a-112 (k). Section 17a-112 (j) (1) requires the court\nto make a finding by clear and convincing evidence\nin the adjudicatory phase concerning the reasonable\nefforts made by the department of children and families\n. . . to reunify the child with the parent as a prerequi-\nsite to terminating parental rights. . . . A court need\nnot make that finding, however, if the evidence estab-\nlishes that the parent is unable or unwilling to benefit\nfrom reunification efforts or if the court determines at\na hearing pursuant to General Statutes § 17a-110 (b)\nor General Statutes § 17a-111b that such efforts are\ninappropriate. . . .9\n  ‘‘By contrast, [§] 17a-112 (k) requires the court in the\ndispositional phase to make written findings regarding\nseven statutory factors, including [t]he timeliness,\nnature and extent of services offered, provided and\nmade available to the parent and the child by an agency\nto facilitate the reunion of the child with the parent and\nwhether the department has made reasonable efforts to\nreunite the family . . . .\n  ‘‘As noted, in determining whether the department\n\fhas made reasonable efforts to reunify a parent and a\nchild or whether there is sufficient evidence that a par-\nent is unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification\nefforts, the court is required in the adjudicatory phase\nto make its assessment on the basis of events preceding\nthe date on which the termination petition was filed.\nSee also Practice Book § 35a-7 (a).’’10 (Citations omitted;\nfootnote altered; internal quotation marks omitted.) In\nre Shaiesha O., 93 Conn. App. 42, 47–49, 887 A.2d 415\n(2006). This court has consistently held that the court,\n‘‘[w]hen making its reasonable efforts determination\nduring the adjudicatory phase . . . is limited to consid-\nering only those facts preceding the filing of the termina-\ntion petition or the most recent amendment to the\npetition . . . .’’ In re Paul O., 141 Conn. App. 477, 483,\n62 A.3d 637, cert. denied, 308 Conn. 933, 64 A.3d 332\n(2013).\n   The commissioner, however, concedes that, in the\nabsence of a court order that otherwise relieves the\ndepartment of its reasonable efforts obligation, § 17a-\n112 (j) (1), as amended by Public Act 06-102, requires\nthe department to prove that it has continued to make\nreasonable efforts up to the time of the trial’s conclu-\nsion. We, however, need not accept the respondent’s\ninvitation to reexamine prior precedent on this issue.\nUnder the circumstances of this case, although the trial\ncourt’s decision does not, explicitly, indicate the spe-\ncific time period for which it considered evidence as to\nthe reasonable steps element, the evidence reasonably\nsupports the court’s findings that the department had\nmade reasonable efforts to reunify respondent with his\nchildren, regardless of whether the trial court consid-\nered evidence through the date the petitions were filed,\nJuly 25, 2010, or through the conclusion of trial on\nFebruary 21, 2013.11 This is because, as we discuss in\npart II of this opinion, the law does not require a contin-\nuation of reasonable efforts on the part of the depart-\nment when such efforts will be futile.\n                            II\n   We now address the respondent’s second argument,\nwhether the evidence was sufficient for the court to\nfind the department made reasonable efforts to reunify\nthe respondent with his children.\n   Our Supreme Court in In re Melody L., 290 Conn.\n131, 962 A.2d 81 (2009), set forth the standard for\nreviewing the trial court’s finding that the department\nmade reasonable efforts to reunify a parent and a child\nin a termination of parental rights case. ‘‘The trial\ncourt’s determination of this issue will not be over-\nturned on appeal unless, in light of all of the evidence\nin the record, it is clearly erroneous. . . . A finding is\nclearly erroneous when either there is no evidence in\nthe record to support it, or the reviewing court is left\nwith the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has\nbeen made. . . . On appeal, our function is to deter-\n\fmine whether the trial court’s conclusion was factually\nsupported and legally correct. . . . In doing so . . .\n[g]reat weight is given to the judgment of the trial court\nbecause of [the court’s] opportunity to observe the par-\nties and the evidence. . . . We do not examine the\nrecord to determine whether the trier of fact could have\nreached a conclusion other than the one reached. . . .\n[Rather] every reasonable presumption is made in favor\nof the trial court’s ruling.’’ (Citations omitted; internal\nquotation marks omitted.) Id., 145.\n   The ‘‘reasonableness’’ of the department’s efforts\nmust be assessed in the context of each case. ‘‘The word\nreasonable is the linchpin on which the department’s\nefforts in a particular set of circumstances are to be\nadjudged, using the clear and convincing standard of\nproof. Neither the word reasonable nor the word efforts\nis, however, defined by our legislature or by the federal\nact from which the requirement was drawn. . . . [R]ea-\nsonable efforts means doing everything reasonable, not\neverything possible. . . . [R]easonableness is an objec-\ntive standard . . . and whether reasonable efforts have\nbeen proven depends on the careful consideration of\nthe circumstances of each individual case.’’ (Citation\nomitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) In re Ebony\nH., 68 Conn. App. 342, 349, 789 A.2d 1158 (2002).\n   This court has applied the general meaning of ‘‘rea-\nsonable’’ and stated that ‘‘[i]t is axiomatic that the law\ndoes not require a useless and futile act.’’ In re Antony\nB., 54 Conn. App. 463, 476, 735 A.2d 893 (1999). In In re\nAntony B., the trial court’s findings that the department\nmade reasonable efforts at reunification were upheld\nin light of the fact that the respondent rejected many\nof the services offered to her and did not choose to\naccept services from the department. See id. Several\nother cases involving appeals from termination of\nparental rights judgments have held that the department\nis not required to continue to provide reasonable efforts\nto a parent when the parent refuses to participate or\nengage in any of those efforts. See In re Christopher\nC., 134 Conn. App. 473, 481–82, 39 A.3d 1127 (2012)\n(despite department’s repeated offers of referrals and\nassistance so respondent could satisfy specific steps\nrequirements respondent refused to comply); see also\nIn re Samantha C., 268 Conn. 614, 632–33, 847 A.2d 883\n(2004) (not unreasonable for department to abandon\nreunification efforts when it did, given age and needs\nof the child, time allotted for the respondents’ rehabili-\ntation and time child had spent in foster care); In re\nDaniel C., 63 Conn. App. 339, 362, 776 A.2d 487 (2001)\n(after respondents had not benefited from decade of\nefforts and services, it was not unreasonable for depart-\nment to decline to pursue reunification as goal after\nchildren’s final removal).\n   The evidence in the record demonstrates that there\nis sufficient evidence on which to affirm the court’s\n\ffinding that the department made reasonable efforts.\nIn making its reasonable efforts finding as to the respon-\ndent, the court’s decision may reasonably be interpreted\nas including the interest, or lack thereof, the respondent\nhad in cooperating with reunification efforts before and\nafter the time of the adjudicatory date, July 25, 2011,\nup until the date the trial concluded, February 21, 2012.\n   Initially, we observe that, to the extent that the assess-\nment of reasonable efforts is made through the date of\nthe filing of the termination petitions, the respondent\nconcedes that the department’s wholly unsuccessful\nefforts were reasonable. The record reflects that during\nthe pendency of the earlier neglect petitions affecting\nKyara and Jahein, filed in 2005 and 2009, the respondent\nwas offered reunification services. On April, 11, 2011,\nneglect petitions were filed on behalf of Kyara and\nJahein and their two younger siblings. At three separate\ntimes prior to the filing of the termination of parental\nrights petitions, the respondent expressly stated to the\ndepartment worker his unwillingness to engage in any\nservices. On April 25, 2011, prior to his incarceration,\none week after neglect petitions for his children had\nbeen filed for the third time, and after he had been\npresented with preliminary specific steps outlining a\nplan for reunification efforts, the respondent told a\ndepartment worker he ‘‘did not want to be involved\nwith the department.’’\n   It is clear from the record that during the period of\ntime just prior to the children’s removal in October,\n2011, the respondent had an opportunity to observe\ntheir chaotic living environment. Andrea reported that\nthe respondent spent time in the backyard of the home\ndrinking with Leander, but he ignored his children,\nKyara and Jahein. On September 14, 2011, a Community\nResidences, Inc., behaviorist, L. J. Grenada, who pro-\nvided a home-based intensive family preservation ser-\nvice, observed seven year old Kyara display highly\nseductive body language in an effort to gain the respon-\ndent’s attention while he socialized across the street\nfrom the family home. Soon after the court’s October\n14, 2011 orders granting temporary custody, placing his\nchildren in department foster care, the respondent was\narrested and incarcerated for assaulting his girlfriend,\nKimberly B. At the time of the children’s last removal\nin October, 2011, Andrea reported to the department\nthat the respondent ‘‘does not acknowledge his children\nin any way.’’ On October 17, 2011, just after his two\nchildren were ordered into the commissioner’s custody\nfor the second time, he received a five year sentence,\nsuspended after eighteen months with five years of\nprobation after being convicted of a 2010 assault and\nbreach of peace involving domestic violence with the\nmother of his youngest child, Kimberly B.\n  On February 1, 2012, the date the children were adju-\ndicated neglected, the respondent was provided with\n\fspecific steps, which he signed. The steps indicated to\nthe respondent that services would be determined once\nhe was released from incarceration. At the bottom of\nthe specific steps form, the respondent acknowledged\nthat if he did not follow the steps, the chance that his\nparental rights would be terminated would increase. He\nalso acknowledged that he understood that he should\ncontact his lawyer and/or the department worker if he\nneeded help in reaching any of his steps. The depart-\nment could not be faulted for failing to provide any\nservices for the respondent prior to his release from\nprison. His incarceration began before the children\nwere taken from Andrea’s custody and endured until\nAugust, 2012. The record also reflects that he did not\nor was unable to engage in any programs offered to\ninmates in the correctional facility. He was provided\nwith two opportunities to participate in a scheduled\nadministrative case review concerning his children via\nteleconference on November 29, 2011, and May 18, 2012,\nbut did not call in.\n   At least twice, a department worker talked to the\nrespondent about his children’s cases, in November,\n2011, and April, 2012, and suggested services in which\nhe could participate when released. In both these con-\nversations, the respondent stated that ‘‘he would not\nbe willing to do anything once he was released.’’ He\nalso stated that the department is ‘‘full of it,’’ that he\ndid not want to attend any treatment programs once\nhe is released from prison, and that he was not going\nto ‘‘jump through any hoops.’’ During this incarceration,\nat his request, the department provided the respondent\nwith visits with the children by bringing the children\non a monthly basis to the correctional facility where\nthe respondent was housed. During these visits, the\nrecord reflects he did not engage with his children. He\nwould wait for them to acknowledge him and he was\ndemeaning to them. The respondent did not exercise\nhis right to visit his children after his release.\n  On July 16, 2012, while objecting to the department’s\npermanency plans of termination of parental rights for\nboth his children, the respondent filed a motion to trans-\nfer guardianship of them to Kimberly B., the girlfriend\nhe had assaulted in 2011. There is no indication any-\nwhere in the record that the respondent advised the\ncourt at that time, or upon his imminent release, that\nhe was willing to accept referrals for services.\n   At the beginning of the trial, the record reflects that\nthe respondent reminded the court that consideration\nof his motion to transfer guardianship to Kimberly B.\nwas to be part of the consolidated proceedings. The\nonly evidence of a program he had attended to address\nissues of substance abuse and parenting identified in his\nspecific steps was a sixteen week alcohol dependence\nprogram at New Perceptions. This program was not a\nreferral he accepted from the department, allowing for\n\fthe further reasonable inference that he still did not\nwish to request its assistance and preferred to choose\nhis own route, or that he only participated in this pro-\ngram because of the conditions of his probation.\nAlthough he argued that his attendance at this program,\nnot selected by the department, was evidence of his\nrehabilitation, the court found his involvement in the\nprogram, in and of itself, was insufficient proof as to\nthat fact. In addition, the department worker testified\nthat the respondent had made no indication to the\ndepartment after his release from prison that he was\nwilling to engage in services that would assist in his\nrehabilitation.\n  Even after withdrawing his motion to transfer guard-\nianship to Kimberly B. near the end of the trial, the\nrespondent, despite his claimed rehabilitation and the\nevidence presented during the trial that Andrea had not\nfully addressed her parenting issues, advocated that the\nchildren should be returned to Andrea’s care. At no\ntime during the trial did the respondent indicate he was\nready to begin reunification efforts and comply with his\nspecific steps as part of his effort to avoid termination.12\n   In the beginning of its memorandum of decision, the\ncourt found that the department has made reasonable\nefforts through the offer of appropriate and available\nservices to promote a reunification with the children.\nLater on, in setting forth the factual basis for finding\n‘‘reasonable efforts and compliance with specific\nsteps,’’ it found that the respondent ‘‘has made no sus-\ntained effort at rehabilitation’’ and ‘‘has rebuffed all\n[department] overtures to assist him,’’ thereby high-\nlighting the futility of the department’s efforts. The evi-\ndence supports the court’s finding that the respondent\nwas never inclined to cooperate with the department\nor engage in rehabilitative programs. The court noted,\nand the record reflects, periods of time between the\nremoval of the children in October, 2011, and the trial\nin February, 2013, in which Andrea and Jose partici-\npated in services to promote reunification, thereby\nexpending at least some effort to comply with specific\nsteps. This participation also reflects the department’s\nwillingness to continue to work up until the time of\ntrial with willing participants like Andrea and Jose. As\nto the respondent, the court, expressing a desire to ‘‘give\nfull weight to all the evidence,’’ cites one rehabilitative\nservice in which he engaged, an alcohol dependence\ntreatment program in which the respondent engaged in\nthe fall of 2012, after the petitions for termination of\nparental rights were filed, which the court noted ‘‘was\nlikely required as a condition of his release and proba-\ntion.’’ In discussing the department’s reasonable efforts\nand the respondent’s compliance with specific steps,\nthe court found that the respondent ‘‘was uncooperative\nand did not attempt to comply with any rehabilitative\nservices save the [Treating] Alcohol Dependence pro-\ngram. . . . He has demonstrated no interest in the chil-\n\fdren and has made no sustained effort at rehabilitation.\nHe has rebuffed all [department] overtures to assist\nhim. He is entirely, unreformed.’’\n   ‘‘Reviewing the court’s findings and conclusions\nunder the clearly erroneous standard . . . we cannot\ndisturb its decision to terminate parental rights where\nthe totality of the evidence, including reasonable infer-\nences [drawn] therefrom, supports the [court’s] verdict\n. . . .’’ (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks\nomitted.) In re Sheena I., 63 Conn. App. 713, 725, 778\nA.2d 997 (2001). Even were we to assume, as the respon-\ndent argues, that the court was bound to evaluate the\ndepartment’s efforts up until the conclusion of the trial,\nthere is sufficient evidence in the record to support the\nreasonable inference that the respondent, right up to\nthe conclusion of the trial, never altered, by word or\ndeed, his expressed position that he did not wish to\nprovide for his children or cooperate with the depart-\nment. Given the evidence and findings of the court in\nthe adjudicatory section of its memorandum of deci-\nsion, the record reasonably supports the inference that\nthe court’s conclusion, in its reasonable efforts finding,\nthat the respondent ‘‘was uncooperative and did not\nattempt to comply with any rehabilitative services save\nthe [Treating] Alcohol Dependence program,’’ which\nthe respondent did not attend until November, 2012,\nafter the adjudicatory date, was based on evidence it\nconsidered up until the date the trial concluded.\n   In the dispositional phase, in making the seven statu-\ntory findings required under § 17a-112 (k) as to the\nrespondent in its articulation, including a second find-\ning that the department made reasonable efforts at\nreunification, the court first restated all of its adjudica-\ntory findings, which had been found by clear and con-\nvincing evidence earlier in its decision, and noted that\nin making the seven statutory findings, the court was\nrestating the obvious. Thus, the court indicated that\nthere was nothing in the evidence through to the conclu-\nsion of the trial that altered its perception, as stated\nin its finding regarding the department’s reasonable\nefforts, that the respondent is ‘‘entirely unreformed,’’\nhaving demonstrated ‘‘no interest in the children’’ and\nmade ‘‘no sustained effort at rehabilitation.’’\n   The futility of any attempts on the part of the depart-\nment to engage with and involve the respondent in\nreunification services could not be any clearer. ‘‘The\ndepartment is not required to provide reasonable efforts\nto a parent when the parent refuses to participate or\nengage in any of those efforts.’’ In re Christopher C.,\nsupra, 134 Conn. App. 478 n.7. The court’s conclusion\nthat the department made reasonable efforts to reunify\nthe respondent with his children, all of which he\nrebuffed, is not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the\ncourt did not err in terminating the respondent’s paren-\ntal rights.\n\f   The judgments are affirmed.\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n   * In accordance with the spirit and intent of General Statutes § 46b-142\n(b) and Practice Book § 79a-12, the names of the parties involved in this\nappeal are not disclosed. The records and papers of this case shall be open\nfor inspection only to persons having a proper interest therein and upon\norder of the Appellate Court.\n   ** January 16, 2014, the date that this decision was released as a slip\nopinion, is the operative date for all substantive and procedural purposes.\n   1\n     Trial was held over two days, on February 19 and 21, 2012. The petitions\nfor the termination of parental rights to four siblings, Kyara H. and Jahein\nH., and Trevon M. and Kahlil M., were consolidated for trial with hearings\non the petitioner’s motions for review of permanency plans for the four\nchildren and the respondent’s motion to transfer guardianship of Kyara and\nJahein to his girlfriend, Kimberly B. The respondent mother, Andrea K., also\nhas appealed to this court from the trial court’s judgments terminating her\nparental rights as to all four children. See In re Kyara H., 147 Conn. App.\n     ,     A.3d       (2013). Jose M., the father of Trevon M. and Kahlil M.,\nhas not appealed the termination of his parental rights in his two children.\nFor purposes of this opinion, Tyrone H. will be referred to as the respondent.\n   2\n     The trial court specifically found that after the removal of Jahein from\nAndrea in 2005, Andrea participated in reunification services, and that after\nthe removal of Kyara, Jahein and their younger sibling, Trevon, from Andrea\nin 2009, Andrea and Jose both participated in such services. The trial court\nnoted that their cooperation resulted in the return of Andrea’s children\nto her care. No such finding of compliance with reunification services or\ncooperation was made by the court regarding the respondent during these\nsame periods, and there is no indication in the record that he engaged in\nany reunification services during the time periods subsequent to the filing\nof the prior neglect petitions affecting Kyara and Jahein.\n   3\n     The court found that Andrea and Jose also had another child in 2012,\nwho, as of the time of trial, was in the care of one of Andrea’s relatives.\nThat child is not the subject of Andrea’s appeal.\n   4\n     There was evidence that, in addition to being removed from Andrea’s\nhome on two separate occasions pursuant to the commissioner’s motions\nfor orders of temporary custody, Kyara and Jahein, with the acquiescence\nof the department, were voluntarily placed with a paternal uncle after the\ndepartment reopened their cases due to domestic violence occurring\nbetween Andrea and Jose in February, 2009. This arrangement only lasted\nabout one month and the uncle returned the children to Andrea without\nnotifying the department. The department learned that the children were\nback in Andrea’s care when Jahein told school staff that he played with a\ngun and bullets at Andrea’s home.\n   5\n     In addition, the record reflects that following his release, the respondent\nnever informed the department he had changed his explicitly and consis-\ntently expressed position that he would not accept services from the depart-\nment. Furthermore, he never argued that, had he only been provided with\nmore guidance or additional programs from the department, he could have\nrehabilitated. He argued that the evidence was insufficient to show he had\nfailed to rehabilitate.\n   6\n     General Statutes § 17a-112 (j) provides in relevant part: ‘‘The Superior\nCourt, upon notice and hearing as provided in sections 45a-716 and 45a-\n717, may grant a petition filed pursuant to this section if it finds by clear\nand convincing evidence that (1) the Department of Children and Families\nhas made reasonable efforts to locate the parent and to reunify the child\nwith the parent in accordance with subsection (a) of section 17a-111b, unless\nthe court finds in this proceeding that the parent is unable or unwilling to\nbenefit from reunification efforts, except that such finding is not required\nif the court has determined at a hearing pursuant to section 17a-111b, or\ndetermines at trial on the petition, that such efforts are not required. . . .’’\n   7\n     The court granted the respondent’s request for an articulation concerning\nits findings in the dispositional phase of the proceeding.\n   8\n     General Statutes § 17a-111b (a) provides in relevant part: ‘‘The Commis-\nsioner of Children and Families shall make reasonable efforts to reunify a\nparent with a child unless the court (1) determines that such efforts are\nnot required . . . or (2) has approved a permanency plan other than reunifi-\ncation pursuant to subsection (k) of section 46b-129.’’\n   9\n     In the present case, there was no judicial determination that reunification\nefforts were inappropriate pursuant to General Statutes §§ 17a-110 (b) or\n\f17a-111b, and although alleged by the commissioner, the court did not find\nthat the respondent was unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification\nefforts.\n   10\n      Practice Book § 35a-7 (a) provides: ‘‘In the adjudicatory phase, the\njudicial authority is limited to evidence of events preceding the filing of the\npetition or the latest amendment, except where the judicial authority must\nconsider subsequent events as part of its determination as to the existence\nof a ground for termination of parental rights.’’\n   11\n      The court did not expressly state whether its consideration of the depart-\nment’s efforts encompassed events only up to July 25, 2012, the filing date\nof the petitions, and the respondent did not seek articulation on this ground.\nMoreover, as we will discuss in part II of this opinion, a careful reading of\nthe court’s decision reflects that the court, in fact, appears to have considered\nevidence and made findings concerning reasonable efforts made up until\nthe time of trial. Thus, the respondent has not demonstrated that the court\nlimited its evaluation of the department’s efforts to the date the petitions\nwere filed. Although, under the circumstances of the present case, we need\nnot determine whether the court was required to consider reasonable efforts\nuntil the time of trial, we note that ‘‘we read an ambiguous record, in the\nabsence of a motion for articulation, to support rather than undermine the\njudgment. . . . Because the [defendant] did not seek the trial court’s articu-\nlation in that regard, we must assume [that] the [court] acted properly.’’\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v.

Absent an articulation regarding the legal basis for the trial\ncourt’s decision, a claim of error cannot be predicated on the assumption\nthat the trial court acted erroneously. See State v. Richard S., 143 Conn.\nApp. 596, 608, 70 A.3d 1110, cert. denied, 310 Conn. 912, 76 A.3d 628 (2013).\n   12\n      We reject the commissioner’s argument that the respondent did not\npreserve his claim that reasonable efforts were not made. The respondent did\nnot need to specifically raise a claim as to the reasonable efforts requirement\nbecause it is an element that § 17a-112 (j) (1) requires be proven. Thus, it\nwas not incumbent on the respondent to alert the court that it must apply\nthe statute to the issue before it. See Fenton v. Connecticut Hospital Assn.\nWorkers’ Compensation Trust, 58 Conn.

Parlato, for the minor children.\n\f                          Opinion\n\n   KELLER, J. The respondent father, Tyrone H.,\nappeals from the judgments of the trial court, Hon.\nFrancis J. Foley III, judge trial referee, terminating his\nparental rights with respect to his minor son, Jahein\nH., and minor daughter, Kyara H., pursuant to General\nStatutes § 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (i), for failure to achieve\nsuch a degree of personal rehabilitation as would\nencourage the belief that, within a reasonable time, he\ncould assume a responsible position in the lives of his\nchildren.1 On appeal, the respondent claims that the\ntrial court’s statutorily required finding that the Depart-\nment of Children and Families (department) made rea-\nsonable efforts to reunify him with his two children\nwas clearly erroneous because the department failed\nto continue to make such efforts until the date the court\nterminated parental rights. We affirm the judgments of\nthe trial court.\n   The following facts, as found by the trial court by\nclear and convincing evidence, and procedural history\nare relevant to the disposition of this appeal. Andrea\nK., the mother of Kyara and Jahein, met the respondent\nwhen she was nineteen years old and soon became\npregnant. Kyara was born on January 22, 2004. Tests\nfor the presence of substances in her system were posi-\ntive for the presence of marijuana, which Andrea admit-\nted she used throughout her pregnancy. Andrea\ntransferred guardianship of Kyara to the child’s mater-\nnal grandfather, Leander K., in whose custody Kyara\nremained for the first three years of her life.\n  Andrea gave birth to Jahein, her second child by the\nrespondent, in that same year, on November 13, 2004.\nTests revealed that Jahein also was exposed to mari-\njuana during pregnancy. Two months after Jahein’s\nbirth, the respondent was arrested for an assault upon\nAndrea. Andrea stated that the respondent left her\nshortly after this incident and thereafter, did not\nacknowledge his children in any way. The respondent\nwas later convicted of the assault and sentenced to one\nyear in jail, execution suspended, with three years of\nprobation. He later violated his probation and was incar-\ncerated.\n  From May 6, 2005, until the spring of 2006, neither\nKyara nor Jahein lived with Andrea. Kyara was residing\nwith Leander and Jahein was in foster care, having been\nremoved from Andrea’s care by the department after\nAndrea, while extremely intoxicated and holding Jah-\nein, lost her balance and fell, causing Jahein to hit his\nhead. Andrea was arrested but participated in services\nand treatment programs, enabling Jahein to be returned\nto her care by the end of 2005.\n  In the summer of 2008, Andrea met another man,\nJose M., and began a four year relationship marred by\nsubstance abuse and incidents of domestic violence.\n\fThis relationship produced three more children.\n   On March 26, 2009, when Andrea was pregnant with\nthe first of her three children by Jose, the petitioner,\nthe Commissioner of Children and Families (commis-\nsioner), sought and obtained temporary custody of\nKyara and Jahein due to their exposure to illegal sub-\nstances, domestic violence and inadequate supervision\nin Andrea’s home. Andrea and Jose participated in ser-\nvices resulting in the return of Kyara and Jahein in\nOctober, 2009, under an order of protective super-\nvision.2\n   In November, 2009, during the period of court-\nordered protective supervision for Kyara and Jahein,\nAndrea was arrested for disorderly conduct and fined\n$200. This was her third arrest. The following month,\nAndrea’s third child, Trevon, was born, with indications\nof exposure to marijuana in utero. On April 11, 2001,\nAndrea’s fourth child, Kahlil, was born, also testing\npositive for exposure to marijuana during the preg-\nnancy.3 Andrea acknowledged to the department that\nshe used marijuana and alcohol throughout this preg-\nnancy and admitted mutual domestic violence involving\nher and Jose. Andrea stated that she used marijuana\ndaily and would drink two or three times per week,\nincluding two or three forty ounce bottles of beer and\n‘‘a few shots.’’ From 2008 to 2012, while he was in a\nrelationship with Andrea and was involved in raising\nher children, Jose bought, used and possessed illegal\ndrugs. Jose reported that both he and Andrea smoked\nmarijuana three to four times a day, even during\nAndrea’s pregnancies.\n   Andrea reported that she and Jose also smoked K-2,\nan illegal, synthetic drug chemically similar to mari-\njuana. This drug can be very potent and is popular with\nmarijuana users because it does not show up on drug\nscreenings unless used within the preceding two hours\nof testing. It can produce hallucinations, severe agita-\ntion, panic attacks, dangerously elevated heart rate and\nblood pressure and seizures.\n   The trial court relied on the October 14, 2011 affidavit\nin support of the commissioner’s motion for temporary\ncustody, in which the department social worker\nMichelle Dwyer ‘‘describes an horrific and chaotic home\nlife for Andrea, Jose, the children and Andrea’s alco-\nholic father, Leander.’’ In August, 2010, Jose assaulted\nAndrea in front of Kyara, Jahein and Trevon. Kyara\nreported to the police what had happened, stating, ‘‘Jose\n. . . punched mommy and dragged her on the floor\n. . . .’’\n  On April 18, 2011, the commissioner filed neglect\npetitions on behalf of Kyara, Jahein and their two\nyounger siblings, but did not seek their removal. In\nSeptember, 2011, a behaviorist and clinician at Commu-\nnity Resources, Inc., who was providing services to\n\fAndrea, told a department social worker that Andrea\nsaid that Kyara roams the house in the middle of the\nnight, urinating in her room and that Andrea feared\nleaving Kyara and Jahein unsupervised with one\nanother because Kyara was engaging in inappropriate\nbehaviors with Jahein. During an arrest for motor vehi-\ncle charges on September 30, 2011, Andrea became so\nagitated and combative with police she had to be\nsecured in a jail cell. On October 12, 2011, a department\nsocial worker observed Trevon, then twenty-two\nmonths old, with two black eyes. Andrea and Leander\nindicated Trevon fell on a piece of furniture. The next\nday, Jose went to Andrea’s home with a friend. Andrea\nhad been drinking and continued to drink throughout\nthe afternoon and evening. Jose and Andrea then went\nto a motel with Trevon and six month old Kahlil. Jose\nreported that Andrea was so drunk she dropped Kahlil\ntwice, then left the hotel to start walking on Route 6,\nwearing no shoes and having unzipped pants. Jose\ncalled police and Andrea was arrested. The court noted\nthat two days later, on October 14, 2011, the commis-\nsioner ‘‘finally’’ sought and obtained an order of tempo-\nrary custody of all four children. For Kyara and Jahein,\nthis was their third removal from Andrea’s care.4\n    After specifically addressing Andrea and the chil-\ndren’s involvement with the department since 2004, the\ncourt, as to the respondent, found that little is known\nabout him because he refused to provide background\ninformation to the department and refused to partici-\npate in services to which the department might have\nreferred him. The trial court, referring to the respondent\nas the ‘‘male biological parent,’’ determined: ‘‘He left\nAndrea shortly after he assaulted her in January, 2005.\nHe has never served as a father, as that term is normally\nunderstood.’’ (Emphasis added.) The court further\nfound: ‘‘What is known about this man is that between\n2004 and 2010, he has been arrested nine times and\nspent a considerable amount of his adult life in prison.\nEven in prison he is not a good citizen. His Department\nof [Correction] record reflects loss of telephone privi-\nleges for thirty days, loss of recreation for fifteen days,\nand punitive segregation for seven days. . . . His arrest\nand conviction record . . . indicates that [the respon-\ndent] is a convicted felon. He has multiple arrests for\nassault, breach of peace, disorderly conduct, criminal\nimpersonation, violation of protective orders, violation\nof probation, interfering or resisting arrest and posses-\nsion of narcotics. On October 17, 2011, he received a\nfive year sentence, suspended after eighteen months\nwith [five] years of probation. He was also convicted\nof a subsequent assault and breach of peace upon his\ngirlfriend, for which he received concurrent time of one\nyear on each [offense]. This charge was a domestic\nviolence related assault on the mother of his newest\nchild. . . . [O]n July 16, 2012, he filed a motion in this\ncourt to have guardianship of Kyara and Jahein trans-\n\fferred to his new girlfriend, Kimberly B., the same\nwoman he recently assaulted. Midway through the ter-\nmination trial, [the respondent] withdrew his motion\nfor transfer of guardianship to Kimberly and thereafter,\nKimberly stopped attending the trial. His lawyer\nreported that [the respondent] now wanted the children\n‘to go to Andrea,’ their mother, instead of his girlfriend.’’\n   The respondent was released from prison in August,\n2012, just a few weeks after the petitions to terminate\nhis parental rights were filed on July 25, 2012. The court\nnoted the respondent’s shifting positions before and at\ntrial relative to the placement of children, neither of\nwhich included any plan that he personally would care\nand provide for them. Nonetheless, ‘‘[t]o give full weight\nto all the evidence,’’ the court acknowledged the respon-\ndent’s attendance at a New Perceptions sixteen class\n‘‘Treating Alcohol Dependence Program,’’ in November,\n2012. The court, to emphasize its conclusion that the\nrespondent’s lack of concern for his children was long-\nstanding and continuing, indicated, ‘‘[t]here is nothing\nin the letter from New Perceptions [submitted as\nrespondent’s Exhibit 1A that] addresses whether [the\nrespondent] ever expressed love and affection for his\nchildren; ever expressed personal concern over their\nhealth, education and general well-being; ever fulfilled\nhis duty to supply the necessary food, clothing and\nmedical care for his children; ever provided them with\nan adequate domicile; or ever provided his children\nwith social and religious guidance. The court concludes\nsince he did not visit them after his release and never\nhas provided for them before, that he did not.’’5 The\ncourt determined that the respondent is ‘‘not actively\ninvolved with Kyara and Jahein; he does not support\nthem and he does not visit them except when he is incar-\ncerated.’’\n   In the termination of parental rights petitions regard-\ning the respondent’s two children, the commissioner\nalleged that the respondent had failed to rehabilitate\nsufficiently and that termination of the parental rights\nwas in the children’s best interests. The commissioner\nalso alleged, regarding the reasonable efforts require-\nment of § 17a-112 (j) (1),6 both that the department\nhad made reasonable efforts to locate and reunify the\nrespondent with his children and that he was unable\nor unwilling to benefit from such efforts.\n   The court stated that ‘‘in the adjudicatory phase of\nthe proceedings, the judicial authority is limited to evi-\ndence of events preceding the filing of the petition or the\nlatest amendment, except, as here, where the judicial\nauthority must consider subsequent events as part of\nits determination as to the existence of a ground for\ntermination of parental rights, i.e. rehabilitation.’’ The\ncourt found by clear and convincing evidence, without\nspecifying any temporal period, that the department\nhad made reasonable efforts to locate the respondent\n\f(‘‘the parents have all been served and appeared and\nthus located’’) and that ‘‘[the department] has made\nreasonable efforts through the offer of appropriate and\navailable services to promote a reunification with the\nchildren.’’ Later, the court specifically found as to the\nrespondent that ‘‘the children, Kyara and Jahein, have\nbeen found in a prior proceeding to have been neglected\nor uncared for and the father has failed to achieve such\ndegree of personal rehabilitation that would encourage\nthe belief that within a reasonable time, considering\nthe age and needs of the children, that [the respondent]\ncould assume a responsible position [in] the life of\nthe children.’’\n   In the dispositional phase of the proceeding,7 the\ncourt set forth its findings with regard to the seven\nfactors set forth in § 17a-112 (k), first restating most of\nits adjudicatory findings regarding the respondent. It\nthen stated that ‘‘given the factual findings made in its\ndecision, compliance with § 17a-112 (k) as it relates to\nthe male biological parent [the respondent], only serves\nto re-state the obvious: [The respondent] has never\nacted as a parent and has refused any services which\nmight assist him in acquiring parental skills.’’\n  The court found by clear and convincing evidence\nthat termination of the respondent’s parental rights in\nKyara and Jahein was in their best interests after consid-\nering various factors, ‘‘including the children’s need\nfor safety, stability and nurturance; their interest in\nsustained growth, development, well-being, and in the\ncontinuity and stability of their environment . . . their\nage and individual needs; the length and nature of their\nstay in foster care, the contact maintained with their\nparents and the potential benefit or detriment to the\nchildren of terminating the parental rights, the genetic\nbond to the biological parents . . . and the seven statu-\ntory factors and the court’s findings thereon.’’ (Citations\nomitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Additional\nfacts and procedural history will be set forth as nec-\nessary.\n   We begin by setting forth the statutory requirements\nfor granting a petition for the termination of parental\nrights. ‘‘A hearing on a petition to terminate parental\nrights consists of two phases, adjudication and disposi-\ntion. . . . If the trial court determines that a statutory\nground for termination exists, it proceeds to the disposi-\ntional phase. In the dispositional phase, the trial court\ndetermines whether termination is in the best interest of\nthe child.’’ (Citation omitted; internal quotations marks\nomitted.)

In the adjudicatory phase of the pro-\nceeding, the court must make separate determinations\nas to reasonable efforts and the statutory grounds for\ntermination. ‘‘In the adjudicatory phase, the judicial\nauthority is limited to evidence of events preceding the\nfiling of the petition or the latest amendment, except\n\fwhere the judicial authority must consider subsequent\nevents as part of its determination as to the existence\nof a ground for termination of parental rights. . . .

His sole claim on appeal\nfocuses on the court’s finding, by clear and convincing\nevidence, that the department had made reasonable\nefforts to reunify Kyara and Jahein with him. The court\nfound: ‘‘[The respondent] was uncooperative and did\nnot attempt to comply with any rehabilitative services\nsave the [Treating] Alcohol Dependence program,\nwhich was likely required as a condition of his release\nand probation. He has demonstrated no interest in the\nchildren and has made no sustained effort at rehabilita-\ntion. He has rebuffed all [department] overtures to\nassist him. He is entirely, unreformed.’’\n  The respondent argues that although the department\npresented evidence that he told the department on three\noccasions prior to the filing of the termination petitions\non July 25, 2012, that he was not interested in any\ndepartment services, the department was required by\nthe specific steps to continue to make efforts to refer\nthe respondent to appropriate services until the trial\nconcluded, and there was no evidence that the depart-\nment even contacted him after his release in August,\n2012, to inquire if he had changed his position of nonco-\noperation with the department or its services. The com-\nmissioner responds that the evidence reasonably\nsupports the court’s findings that the department had\nmade reasonable efforts to reunify respondent with his\nchildren, regardless of whether the trial court consid-\n\fered evidence through the date the petitions were filed,\nJuly 25, 2012, the adjudicatory date, or through the\nconclusion of trial on February 21, 2013, because the\nlaw does not require a continuation of reasonable\nefforts on the part of the department when they will\nbe futile.\n   In support of his claim, the respondent asserts that\nin accordance with § 17a-112 (j) (1), the court was\nrequired to find that the department had made reason-\nable efforts to reunify him with his children until the\ntime that the trial concluded on February 21, 2013. Next,\nthe respondent asserts that the evidence did not support\nthe court’s finding that the department made reasonable\nefforts to reunify because there is no evidence that the\ndepartment made any efforts, reasonable or otherwise,\nafter the respondent’s release from prison in August,\n2012. We will address each aspect of the claim, in turn.\n                            I\n    The respondent first argues that § 17a-112 (j) (1)\nrequires the department to continue to make reasonable\nefforts to reunify a parent with his or her child until\nthe conclusion of the trial on the termination of parental\nrights petition unless the court has found at a previous\nproceeding that, under subsection (a) of General Stat-\nutes § 17a-111b,8 such efforts are no longer appropriate.\nIn light of the circumstances of the present case, we\nneed not decide whether the respondent’s interpreta-\ntion of § 17a-112 (j) (1), which the respondent asserts\nis at odds with our case law interpreting the statute,\nis correct.\n   ‘‘As this court has noted, [t]here is a distinction\nbetween a finding on reasonable reunification efforts\nunder § 17a-112 (j) and consideration of the same under\n§ 17a-112 (k). Section 17a-112 (j) (1) requires the court\nto make a finding by clear and convincing evidence\nin the adjudicatory phase concerning the reasonable\nefforts made by the department of children and families\n. . . to reunify the child with the parent as a prerequi-\nsite to terminating parental rights. . . . A court need\nnot make that finding, however, if the evidence estab-\nlishes that the parent is unable or unwilling to benefit\nfrom reunification efforts or if the court determines at\na hearing pursuant to General Statutes § 17a-110 (b)\nor General Statutes § 17a-111b that such efforts are\ninappropriate. . . .9\n  ‘‘By contrast, [§] 17a-112 (k) requires the court in the\ndispositional phase to make written findings regarding\nseven statutory factors, including [t]he timeliness,\nnature and extent of services offered, provided and\nmade available to the parent and the child by an agency\nto facilitate the reunion of the child with the parent and\nwhether the department has made reasonable efforts to\nreunite the family . . . .\n  ‘‘As noted, in determining whether the department\n\fhas made reasonable efforts to reunify a parent and a\nchild or whether there is sufficient evidence that a par-\nent is unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification\nefforts, the court is required in the adjudicatory phase\nto make its assessment on the basis of events preceding\nthe date on which the termination petition was filed.\nSee also Practice Book § 35a-7 (a).’’10 (Citations omitted;\nfootnote altered; internal quotation marks omitted.)

The record reflects that during\nthe pendency of the earlier neglect petitions affecting\nKyara and Jahein, filed in 2005 and 2009, the respondent\nwas offered reunification services. On April, 11, 2011,\nneglect petitions were filed on behalf of Kyara and\nJahein and their two younger siblings. At three separate\ntimes prior to the filing of the termination of parental\nrights petitions, the respondent expressly stated to the\ndepartment worker his unwillingness to engage in any\nservices. On April 25, 2011, prior to his incarceration,\none week after neglect petitions for his children had\nbeen filed for the third time, and after he had been\npresented with preliminary specific steps outlining a\nplan for reunification efforts, the respondent told a\ndepartment worker he ‘‘did not want to be involved\nwith the department.’’\n   It is clear from the record that during the period of\ntime just prior to the children’s removal in October,\n2011, the respondent had an opportunity to observe\ntheir chaotic living environment. Andrea reported that\nthe respondent spent time in the backyard of the home\ndrinking with Leander, but he ignored his children,\nKyara and Jahein. On September 14, 2011, a Community\nResidences, Inc., behaviorist, L. J. Grenada, who pro-\nvided a home-based intensive family preservation ser-\nvice, observed seven year old Kyara display highly\nseductive body language in an effort to gain the respon-\ndent’s attention while he socialized across the street\nfrom the family home. Soon after the court’s October\n14, 2011 orders granting temporary custody, placing his\nchildren in department foster care, the respondent was\narrested and incarcerated for assaulting his girlfriend,\nKimberly B. At the time of the children’s last removal\nin October, 2011, Andrea reported to the department\nthat the respondent ‘‘does not acknowledge his children\nin any way.’’ On October 17, 2011, just after his two\nchildren were ordered into the commissioner’s custody\nfor the second time, he received a five year sentence,\nsuspended after eighteen months with five years of\nprobation after being convicted of a 2010 assault and\nbreach of peace involving domestic violence with the\nmother of his youngest child, Kimberly B.\n  On February 1, 2012, the date the children were adju-\ndicated neglected, the respondent was provided with\n\fspecific steps, which he signed. The steps indicated to\nthe respondent that services would be determined once\nhe was released from incarceration. At the bottom of\nthe specific steps form, the respondent acknowledged\nthat if he did not follow the steps, the chance that his\nparental rights would be terminated would increase. He\nalso acknowledged that he understood that he should\ncontact his lawyer and/or the department worker if he\nneeded help in reaching any of his steps. The depart-\nment could not be faulted for failing to provide any\nservices for the respondent prior to his release from\nprison. His incarceration began before the children\nwere taken from Andrea’s custody and endured until\nAugust, 2012. The record also reflects that he did not\nor was unable to engage in any programs offered to\ninmates in the correctional facility. He was provided\nwith two opportunities to participate in a scheduled\nadministrative case review concerning his children via\nteleconference on November 29, 2011, and May 18, 2012,\nbut did not call in.\n   At least twice, a department worker talked to the\nrespondent about his children’s cases, in November,\n2011, and April, 2012, and suggested services in which\nhe could participate when released. In both these con-\nversations, the respondent stated that ‘‘he would not\nbe willing to do anything once he was released.’’ He\nalso stated that the department is ‘‘full of it,’’ that he\ndid not want to attend any treatment programs once\nhe is released from prison, and that he was not going\nto ‘‘jump through any hoops.’’ During this incarceration,\nat his request, the department provided the respondent\nwith visits with the children by bringing the children\non a monthly basis to the correctional facility where\nthe respondent was housed. During these visits, the\nrecord reflects he did not engage with his children. He\nwould wait for them to acknowledge him and he was\ndemeaning to them. The respondent did not exercise\nhis right to visit his children after his release.\n  On July 16, 2012, while objecting to the department’s\npermanency plans of termination of parental rights for\nboth his children, the respondent filed a motion to trans-\nfer guardianship of them to Kimberly B., the girlfriend\nhe had assaulted in 2011. There is no indication any-\nwhere in the record that the respondent advised the\ncourt at that time, or upon his imminent release, that\nhe was willing to accept referrals for services.\n   At the beginning of the trial, the record reflects that\nthe respondent reminded the court that consideration\nof his motion to transfer guardianship to Kimberly B.\nwas to be part of the consolidated proceedings. The\nonly evidence of a program he had attended to address\nissues of substance abuse and parenting identified in his\nspecific steps was a sixteen week alcohol dependence\nprogram at New Perceptions. This program was not a\nreferral he accepted from the department, allowing for\n\fthe further reasonable inference that he still did not\nwish to request its assistance and preferred to choose\nhis own route, or that he only participated in this pro-\ngram because of the conditions of his probation.\nAlthough he argued that his attendance at this program,\nnot selected by the department, was evidence of his\nrehabilitation, the court found his involvement in the\nprogram, in and of itself, was insufficient proof as to\nthat fact. In addition, the department worker testified\nthat the respondent had made no indication to the\ndepartment after his release from prison that he was\nwilling to engage in services that would assist in his\nrehabilitation.\n  Even after withdrawing his motion to transfer guard-\nianship to Kimberly B. near the end of the trial, the\nrespondent, despite his claimed rehabilitation and the\nevidence presented during the trial that Andrea had not\nfully addressed her parenting issues, advocated that the\nchildren should be returned to Andrea’s care. At no\ntime during the trial did the respondent indicate he was\nready to begin reunification efforts and comply with his\nspecific steps as part of his effort to avoid termination.12\n   In the beginning of its memorandum of decision, the\ncourt found that the department has made reasonable\nefforts through the offer of appropriate and available\nservices to promote a reunification with the children.\nLater on, in setting forth the factual basis for finding\n‘‘reasonable efforts and compliance with specific\nsteps,’’ it found that the respondent ‘‘has made no sus-\ntained effort at rehabilitation’’ and ‘‘has rebuffed all\n[department] overtures to assist him,’’ thereby high-\nlighting the futility of the department’s efforts. The evi-\ndence supports the court’s finding that the respondent\nwas never inclined to cooperate with the department\nor engage in rehabilitative programs. The court noted,\nand the record reflects, periods of time between the\nremoval of the children in October, 2011, and the trial\nin February, 2013, in which Andrea and Jose partici-\npated in services to promote reunification, thereby\nexpending at least some effort to comply with specific\nsteps. This participation also reflects the department’s\nwillingness to continue to work up until the time of\ntrial with willing participants like Andrea and Jose. As\nto the respondent, the court, expressing a desire to ‘‘give\nfull weight to all the evidence,’’ cites one rehabilitative\nservice in which he engaged, an alcohol dependence\ntreatment program in which the respondent engaged in\nthe fall of 2012, after the petitions for termination of\nparental rights were filed, which the court noted ‘‘was\nlikely required as a condition of his release and proba-\ntion.’’ In discussing the department’s reasonable efforts\nand the respondent’s compliance with specific steps,\nthe court found that the respondent ‘‘was uncooperative\nand did not attempt to comply with any rehabilitative\nservices save the [Treating] Alcohol Dependence pro-\ngram. . . . He has demonstrated no interest in the chil-\n\fdren and has made no sustained effort at rehabilitation.\nHe has rebuffed all [department] overtures to assist\nhim. He is entirely, unreformed.’’\n   ‘‘Reviewing the court’s findings and conclusions\nunder the clearly erroneous standard . . . we cannot\ndisturb its decision to terminate parental rights where\nthe totality of the evidence, including reasonable infer-\nences [drawn] therefrom, supports the [court’s] verdict\n. . . .’’ (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks\nomitted.) In re Sheena I., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.

Even were we to assume, as the respon-\ndent argues, that the court was bound to evaluate the\ndepartment’s efforts up until the conclusion of the trial,\nthere is sufficient evidence in the record to support the\nreasonable inference that the respondent, right up to\nthe conclusion of the trial, never altered, by word or\ndeed, his expressed position that he did not wish to\nprovide for his children or cooperate with the depart-\nment. Given the evidence and findings of the court in\nthe adjudicatory section of its memorandum of deci-\nsion, the record reasonably supports the inference that\nthe court’s conclusion, in its reasonable efforts finding,\nthat the respondent ‘‘was uncooperative and did not\nattempt to comply with any rehabilitative services save\nthe [Treating] Alcohol Dependence program,’’ which\nthe respondent did not attend until November, 2012,\nafter the adjudicatory date, was based on evidence it\nconsidered up until the date the trial concluded.\n   In the dispositional phase, in making the seven statu-\ntory findings required under § 17a-112 (k) as to the\nrespondent in its articulation, including a second find-\ning that the department made reasonable efforts at\nreunification, the court first restated all of its adjudica-\ntory findings, which had been found by clear and con-\nvincing evidence earlier in its decision, and noted that\nin making the seven statutory findings, the court was\nrestating the obvious. Thus, the court indicated that\nthere was nothing in the evidence through to the conclu-\nsion of the trial that altered its perception, as stated\nin its finding regarding the department’s reasonable\nefforts, that the respondent is ‘‘entirely unreformed,’’\nhaving demonstrated ‘‘no interest in the children’’ and\nmade ‘‘no sustained effort at rehabilitation.’’\n   The futility of any attempts on the part of the depart-\nment to engage with and involve the respondent in\nreunification services could not be any clearer. ‘‘The\ndepartment is not required to provide reasonable efforts\nto a parent when the parent refuses to participate or\nengage in any of those efforts.’’ In re Christopher C.,\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> n.7. The court’s conclusion\nthat the department made reasonable efforts to reunify\nthe respondent with his children, all of which he\nrebuffed, is not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the\ncourt did not err in terminating the respondent’s paren-\ntal rights.\n\f   The judgments are affirmed.\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n   * In accordance with the spirit and intent of General Statutes § 46b-142\n(b) and Practice Book § 79a-12, the names of the parties involved in this\nappeal are not disclosed. The records and papers of this case shall be open\nfor inspection only to persons having a proper interest therein and upon\norder of the Appellate Court.\n   ** January 16, 2014, the date that this decision was released as a slip\nopinion, is the operative date for all substantive and procedural purposes.\n   1\n     Trial was held over two days, on February 19 and 21, 2012. The petitions\nfor the termination of parental rights to four siblings, Kyara H. and Jahein\nH., and Trevon M. and Kahlil M., were consolidated for trial with hearings\non the petitioner’s motions for review of permanency plans for the four\nchildren and the respondent’s motion to transfer guardianship of Kyara and\nJahein to his girlfriend, Kimberly B. The respondent mother, Andrea K., also\nhas appealed to this court from the trial court’s judgments terminating her\nparental rights as to all four children. See In re Kyara H., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn. App.</span>\n     <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,     A.3d       (2013). Jose M., the father of Trevon M. and Kahlil M.,\nhas not appealed the termination of his parental rights in his two children.\nFor purposes of this opinion, Tyrone H. will be referred to as the respondent.\n   2\n     The trial court specifically found that after the removal of Jahein from\nAndrea in 2005, Andrea participated in reunification services, and that after\nthe removal of Kyara, Jahein and their younger sibling, Trevon, from Andrea\nin 2009, Andrea and Jose both participated in such services. The trial court\nnoted that their cooperation resulted in the return of Andrea’s children\nto her care. No such finding of compliance with reunification services or\ncooperation was made by the court regarding the respondent during these\nsame periods, and there is no indication in the record that he engaged in\nany reunification services during the time periods subsequent to the filing\nof the prior neglect petitions affecting Kyara and Jahein.\n   3\n     The court found that Andrea and Jose also had another child in 2012,\nwho, as of the time of trial, was in the care of one of Andrea’s relatives.\nThat child is not the subject of Andrea’s appeal.\n   4\n     There was evidence that, in addition to being removed from Andrea’s\nhome on two separate occasions pursuant to the commissioner’s motions\nfor orders of temporary custody, Kyara and Jahein, with the acquiescence\nof the department, were voluntarily placed with a paternal uncle after the\ndepartment reopened their cases due to domestic violence occurring\nbetween Andrea and Jose in February, 2009. This arrangement only lasted\nabout one month and the uncle returned the children to Andrea without\nnotifying the department. The department learned that the children were\nback in Andrea’s care when Jahein told school staff that he played with a\ngun and bullets at Andrea’s home.\n   5\n     In addition, the record reflects that following his release, the respondent\nnever informed the department he had changed his explicitly and consis-\ntently expressed position that he would not accept services from the depart-\nment. Furthermore, he never argued that, had he only been provided with\nmore guidance or additional programs from the department, he could have\nrehabilitated. He argued that the evidence was insufficient to show he had\nfailed to rehabilitate.\n   6\n     General Statutes § 17a-112 (j) provides in relevant part: ‘‘The Superior\nCourt, upon notice and hearing as provided in sections 45a-716 and 45a-\n717, may grant a petition filed pursuant to this section if it finds by clear\nand convincing evidence that (1) the Department of Children and Families\nhas made reasonable efforts to locate the parent and to reunify the child\nwith the parent in accordance with subsection (a) of section 17a-111b, unless\nthe court finds in this proceeding that the parent is unable or unwilling to\nbenefit from reunification efforts, except that such finding is not required\nif the court has determined at a hearing pursuant to section 17a-111b, or\ndetermines at trial on the petition, that such efforts are not required. . . .’’\n   7\n     The court granted the respondent’s request for an articulation concerning\nits findings in the dispositional phase of the proceeding.\n   8\n     General Statutes § 17a-111b (a) provides in relevant part: ‘‘The Commis-\nsioner of Children and Families shall make reasonable efforts to reunify a\nparent with a child unless the court (1) determines that such efforts are\nnot required . . . or (2) has approved a permanency plan other than reunifi-\ncation pursuant to subsection (k) of section 46b-129.’’\n   9\n     In the present case, there was no judicial determination that reunification\nefforts were inappropriate pursuant to General Statutes §§ 17a-110 (b) or\n\f17a-111b, and although alleged by the commissioner, the court did not find\nthat the respondent was unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification\nefforts.\n   10\n      Practice Book § 35a-7 (a) provides: ‘‘In the adjudicatory phase, the\njudicial authority is limited to evidence of events preceding the filing of the\npetition or the latest amendment, except where the judicial authority must\nconsider subsequent events as part of its determination as to the existence\nof a ground for termination of parental rights.’’\n   11\n      The court did not expressly state whether its consideration of the depart-\nment’s efforts encompassed events only up to July 25, 2012, the filing date\nof the petitions, and the respondent did not seek articulation on this ground.\nMoreover, as we will discuss in part II of this opinion, a careful reading of\nthe court’s decision reflects that the court, in fact, appears to have considered\nevidence and made findings concerning reasonable efforts made up until\nthe time of trial. Thus, the respondent has not demonstrated that the court\nlimited its evaluation of the department’s efforts to the date the petitions\nwere filed. Although, under the circumstances of the present case, we need\nnot determine whether the court was required to consider reasonable efforts\nuntil the time of trial, we note that ‘‘we read an ambiguous record, in the\nabsence of a motion for articulation, to support rather than undermine the\njudgment. . . . Because the [defendant] did not seek the trial court’s articu-\nlation in that regard, we must assume [that] the [court] acted properly.’’\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v.
