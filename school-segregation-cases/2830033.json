REEVES, District Judge. Plaintiff-Appellant Erica Vredevelt appeals the\n\ndecision of the district court granting summary judgment to Defendant-Appellee The GEO\n\nGroup, Inc. on her gender discrimination and sexual harassment claims pursuant to Michigan’s\n\nElliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, M.C.L. § 37.2101 et seq., and intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress claim under Michigan common law. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district\n\ncourt’s judgment.\n\n                                          BACKGROUND\n\n\n\n*\n         The Honorable Danny C. Reeves, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky,\nsitting by designation.\n\n                                                   -1-\n\f       The GEO Group, Inc., formerly known as Wackenhut Corrections Corp. (“GEO”),\n\noperates the Michigan Youth Correctional Facility (the “Facility”) in Baldwin, Michigan, under\n\na contract with the Michigan Department of Corrections. The Facility is a maximum security\n\nyouth detention prison housing inmates ranging in age from 13 to 16 years. GEO hired\n\nVredevelt as a Corrections Officer (“CO”) out of its first training academy in 1999. She worked\n\nat the Facility until April 2002 when she left to take a new job. Shortly after beginning her\n\nemployment, Vredevelt became a member of the Facility’s Corrections Emergency Response\n\nTeam (“CERT”) – a small unit of COs that responds to critical incidents at the Facility involving\n\ninmates.\n\n       As a CERT team member, Vredevelt received additional compensation of $20 to $30 per\n\nmonth. At the Facility, COs are required to work at various posts, including the Medical\n\nDepartment, Visitation, Recreation, ARV (emergency response vehicle), Control Center,\n\nHousing Pods (inmate residence areas), Utility (a rotating post that helps where needed), Tower\n\n(gun towers surrounding the Facility’s perimeter), Checkpoint, and Segregation (a housing unit\n\nreserved for violent and disruptive inmates). GEO has the authority to assign a CO to any post.\n\nSpecifically, the Collective Bargaining Agreement between GEO and the CO’s Union provides\n\nthat “the direction of the working force . . . shall be vested exclusively with the employer.”\n\nIt further provides that GEO “shall have the right . . . to determine work schedules and type\n\nof work.”\n\n       For the first six months of her employment, Vredevelt worked in Segregation. Following\n\nthat assignment, she worked Utility for over a year. She also worked without objection or\n\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\fincident in the Medical Department, Recreation, the Towers and the Housing Pods as those\n\nduties were assigned to her.\n\n       As a CERT member, Vredevelt was required to respond quickly to critical incidents\n\ninvolving inmates. GEO stored all of the CERT equipment in a locker room adjacent to the\n\nmen’s bathroom. Upon notification of an incident, team members would gather their gear (leg\n\npads, elbow pads, a helmet, gas mask and shoulder pads) from the locker room and change\n\nclothing and equipment prior to addressing the incident. GEO contends that, as a matter of\n\npersonal preference, Vredevelt would change her clothing and equipment in the men’s locker\n\nroom rather than carry the equipment to the women’s restroom located approximately 20 to 30\n\nfeet away. Vredevelt claims that, because the equipment was too heavy and because it was\n\ndifficult to maneuver past the men, she was forced to change in the men’s locker room so that\n\nshe could respond to emergencies in a timely manner.\n\n       In 2001, Vredevelt applied for a promotion to sergeant. In applying for this position, she\n\nwas required to submit a letter of interest and participate in a Promotion Board interview.\n\nVredevelt was also required to deliver an oral presentation and complete a written exercise.\n\nAlthough Vredevelt was not selected, she acknowledges that the person who received the\n\nposition, Thomas DeWolf, was a qualified candidate.\n\n       At the end of 2001, Vredevelt took a second job outside the Facility. However, she was\n\npermitted by the Warden to work three days a week at the Facility to accommodate her work\n\nschedule.1 Subsequently, in February or March 2002, Vredevelt was removed from the CERT\n\n\n\n1\n       Vredevelt still worked forty hours a week at the Facility but did so over a three-day period.\n\n                                                   -3-\n\fteam by Deputy Warden Daniel Bosse. According to Bosse, Vredevelt was removed from the\n\nteam because she could only work three days a week and GEO could not afford to have one of\n\nits limited number of CERT members unavailable on other work days. Vredevelt never sought\n\nreversal of this decision from Warden Frank Elo. Instead, approximately one week after her\n\nremoval from the CERT team, she left her job at the Facility and started working as a full-time\n\ndeputy with the Ottawa County Sheriff’s Department. Vredevelt testified that she made more\n\nmoney at this job than she did at the Facility.\n\n       Before resigning, Vredevelt wrote to GEO to announce her intentions and reasoning:\n\n       This is a letter regarding my resignation from Wackenhut Corporation/Michigan\n       Juvenile Prison. I Erica R. Vredevelt will be leaving WCC after 2 weeks of\n       service to further my career elsewhere. I am grateful and thankful of the time and\n       effort Wackenhut has given me, my thanks goes to all those officers above and\n       below me in rank who have taken time to train and educate me in the field of\n       corrections. The knowledge and skills I have learned here will help me in [my]\n       future career.\n\n       I leave WCC with a great respect for the staff and corrections officers. They put\n       forth a good effort in teamwork and keeping company standards and mission\n       statements. There is no reason I would not come back to work for WCC in the\n       future. Once again I thank all those who helped me become the corrections\n       officer I am today.\n\n       On October 1, 2003, Vredevelt and nine other plaintiffs filed a Joint Amended Complaint\n\nagainst GEO alleging gender discrimination, sexual harassment and retaliation claims under\n\nMichigan’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, M.C.L. § 37.2101 et seq. (“MCRA”). In addition,\n\nthe group asserted claims for defamation, false imprisonment and intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress under Michigan common law. In her Joint Amended Complaint, Vredevelt\n\nasserted five claims against the Defendant: (1) disparate treatment gender discrimination (Count\n\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\f1); (2) hostile work environment (Count II); (3) retaliation (Count III); (4) intentional infliction\n\nof emotional distress (Count IV); and (5) false imprisonment (Count V). Subsequently,\n\nVredevelt abandoned her false imprisonment and retaliation claims. Two of the ten plaintiffs\n\nvoluntarily dismissed their claims and six of the ten settled their claims for nominal amounts.\n\nThe district court dismissed the claims of the remaining two plaintiffs (including Vredevelt) on\n\nsummary judgment. That dismissal is the subject of the present appeal.\n\n       Vredevelt’s gender discrimination claim is based on the contention that she and other\n\nwomen were never assigned to the best post positions and that she was improperly removed from\n\nthe CERT team. She also contends that she was passed over for the sergeant job despite being\n\nmore qualified than the male CO who received the promotion. In addition, Vredevelt claims that\n\nshe and the other female CERT members were not provided with a separate changing facility\n\nand, therefore, were forced to change in front of male CERT officers.\n\n       In support of her sexual harassment claim, Vredevelt alleged that GEO employees –\n\nprimarily Deputy Warden Bosse – made comments that were offensive. These comments\n\nincluded:\n\n       1.      Bosse allegedly told Vredevelt that she should be home “barefoot and\n               pregnant.”\n\n       2.      Bosse allegedly told Vredevelt that she was incapable of performing utility\n               or transport after she went part time.\n\n       3.      Someone told Vredevelt that Bosse said that he would never promote a\n               female.\n\n       4.      New corrections officers allegedly made comments to Vredevelt such as\n               “who do you think you are?” or “your s - - - does not stink” in reference\n               to the fact that she wore fatigues instead of a uniform.\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       5.      Bosse made a comment that Vredevelt “was a female and [she] couldn’t\n               handle [herself] around inmates.”\n\n       6.      Officer Griffin allegedly made a comment to Vredevelt about her “camel\n               toe” when she wore her fatigues.\n\n       7.      Vredevelt’s fellow CERT members allegedly made bets about the color of\n               her underwear and asked to see her tattoos.\n\n       8.      A fellow corrections officer made comments to the effect of “let’s go for\n               a quick f - - k” and “give me a b - - w job.”\n\n       9.      After a male officer commented that she was not performing “pat downs”\n               properly, Vredevelt states that she was required to pat down the\n               complaining officer.\n\nVredevelt alleges that these comments support her sexual harassment and hostile work\n\nenvironment claims. In addition, Vredevelt has asserted a claim of intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress.\n\n                                 STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       A district court’s grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. Holloway v. Brush,\n\n220 F.3d 767, 772 (6th Cir. 2000). Summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 56(c). In considering such a motion, the court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the nonmoving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.,\n\n475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986). The central issue is “whether the evidence presents sufficient\n\ndisagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must\n\nprevail as a matter of law.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52 (1986).\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\f        I.      Disparate Treatment\n\n        Section 202 of the MCRA prohibits an employer from discriminating “against an\n\nindividual with respect to employment . . . because of religion, race, color, national origin,\n\nage, sex, height, weight, or marital status.” M.C.L. § 37.2202(1)(a). Courts have recognized two\n\nbroad categories of claims under this section: disparate treatment and disparate impact claims.\n\nSee Dep’t of Civil Rights ex rel. Peterson v. Brighton Area Schools, 431 N.W.2d 65 (Mich. Ct.\n\nApp. 1988) (citing Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335-36 n. 15 (1977).\n\nIn this case, Vredevelt has alleged a disparate treatment gender discrimination claim.\n\n        Disparate treatment claims may be established under ordinary principles of proof by the\n\nuse of indirect or direct evidence. Town v. Michigan Bell Tel. Co., 568 N.W.2d 64 (Mich. 1997).\n\nWhen a plaintiff uses indirect evidence, she must establish a “rebuttable prima facie case on the\n\nbasis of proofs from which a factfinder could infer that [she] was the victim of unlawful\n\ndiscrimination.” Sniecinski v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Mich., 666 N.W.2d 186, 193 (Mich.\n\n2003); see McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).2 Under this test, as applied\n\nby the state of Michigan, a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of prohibited discrimination\n\nby demonstrating that: (1) she was a member of a protected class; (2) adverse employment\n\naction was taken against her; (3) she was qualified for the position; and (4) she was treated\n\n\n2\n         In examining discrimination claims under Michigan’s Civil Rights Act, Michigan courts have adopted\nthe analysis used in evaluating discrimination claims brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n(“Title VII”). See Sniecinski, 666 N.W.2d at 193 (for purposes of Michigan’s Civil Rights Act, the elements\nof a prima facie case of unlawful employment discrimination under the McDonnell Douglas approach should\nbe tailored to the facts and circumstances of each case); Sharp v. City of Lansing, 606 N.W.2d 424 (Mich.\nCt. App. 1999) (an employer is liable under the Michigan Civil Rights Act whenever it would be liable under\nTitle VII); Jackson v. Quanex Corp., 191 F.3d 647 (6th Cir. 1999); Alexander v. Local 496, Laborers’ Int’l\nUnion of N. Am., 177 F.3d 394, 418 (6th Cir. 1999).\n\n                                                    -7-\n\fdifferently than similarly-situated male employees. Town, 568 N.W.2d at 68. If a prima facie\n\ncase is established, the employer has the burden of coming forward with a legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. If the employer offers such\n\nevidence, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the stated reason is merely a pretext for\n\ndiscrimination. This burden merges with the plaintiff’s overall burden of proving the claim. Id.\n\n       A plaintiff alleging discrimination via direct evidence is not subject to the McDonnell\n\nDouglas burden-shifting framework, Harrison v. Olde Fin. Corp., 572 N.W.2d 679, 683 (Mich.\n\nCt. App. 1997), though she still must establish that she suffered an adverse employment action\n\nin order to state a claim, see Sniecinski, 666 N.W.2d at 193. “Direct evidence is evidence which,\n\nif believed, would prove the existence of a fact (i.e. unlawful discrimination) without any\n\ninferences or presumptions.” Herendeen v. Mich. St. Police, 39 F. Supp. 2d 899, (W.D. Mich.\n\n1999); see also Johnson v. Kroger Co., 319 F.3d 858, 865 (6th Cir. 2003) (direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination “does not require a factfinder to draw any inferences in order to conclude that the\n\nchallenged employment action was motivated at least in part by” discriminatory animus).\n\n       Vredevelt contends that she suffered discrimination at her employment because she is\n\nfemale. Thus, the initial issue in dispute, under either an indirect or a direct evidence approach,\n\nis whether she suffered an adverse employment action because of her sex. An “adverse\n\nemployment action” for purposes of proving unlawful discrimination must be materially adverse\n\nin that it is more than a “mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities,” and “must\n\nhave an objective basis for demonstrating that the change is adverse, rather than the mere\n\nsubjective impressions of the plaintiff.” Meyer v. City of Center Line, 619 N.W.2d 182, 188\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f(Mich. Ct. App. 2002) (citing Wilcoxon v. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co., 597 N.W.2d 250, 258\n\n(Mich. Ct. App. 1999)). According to the Michigan courts, a “materially adverse” employment\n\naction includes: termination of employment; demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or\n\nsalary; a less distinguished title; a material loss of benefits; significantly diminished material\n\nresponsibilities; or other indices that might be unique to a particular situation. Wilcoxon, 597\n\nN.W.2d at 258.\n\n         Here, Vredevelt contends that she met this burden because she: (1) received poor post\n\nassignments; (2) was removed from the CERT team; (3) was not provided with comparable\n\nfacility in which to change into her CERT gear; (4) failed to receive a promotion to sergeant; and\n\n(5) was constructively discharged. Vredevelt contends that the actions by GEO were based on\n\nher gender. Thus, she alleges that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on this\n\nclaim.\n\n                A.     The Post Assignments\n\n         Vredevelt alleges that she and the other female employees working at the Facility were\n\nnever assigned to the best post assignments. During her deposition, however, Vredevelt admitted\n\nthat the desirability of the post positions was subjective. Specifically, she indicated that she\n\nparticularly liked to work segregation but others did not because “it was the toughest to work.”\n\nFurther, although Vredevelt claimed that the pod position was undesirable, one of her former co-\n\nplaintiffs testified that she like working “a couple of the pods.”\n\n         Vredevelt failed to demonstrate that her assignment to work certain post positions\n\nconstituted an adverse employment action. As noted in Wilcoxon, in order for an employment\n\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\faction to be adverse for purposes of a discrimination claim, “a plaintiff’s subjective impressions\n\nas to the desirability of one position over another [are] not controlling.” Wilcoxon, 597 N.W.2d\n\nat 258 (citing Kocsis v Multi-Care Mgmt., Inc., 97 F.3d 876, 886 (6th Cir. 1996)). The\n\nCollective Bargaining Agreement between GEO and the CO’s Union provides that GEO “shall\n\nhave the right . . . to determine work schedules and type of work . . .” Moreover, as a CO,\n\nGEO could assign Vredevelt to any post. Certainly, GEO was not required to accommodate the\n\npost preferences of its employees. Thus, GEO’s assignment of Vredevelt to one post position\n\ninstead of another cannot be deemed an adverse employment action.\n\n               B.     Removal From The CERT Team\n\n       Vredevelt also contends that she suffered an adverse employment action when she was\n\nremoved from the CERT team. As a CERT team member, Vredevelt was on a special unit of\n\nCOs that was required to respond to critical situations involving inmates at the Facility.\n\nVredevelt notes that when she was removed from the CERT team, she lost a monthly stipend of\n\n$20 to $30 per month. Moreover, Vredevelt claims that the CERT team members were\n\nconsidered the “cream of the crop” within the Facility. Therefore, according to Vredevelt, the\n\nalteration in pay – in addition to the fact that she was removed from a prestigious position –\n\nconstituted an adverse employment action by GEO.\n\n       Even if all of this amounted to an adverse employment action, a point we need not decide,\n\nVredevelt’s gender-discrimination claim on this score comes up short. To the extent she means\n\nto establish indirect evidence of discrimination in connection with this claim, she has not proved\n\none of the elements of a prima facie case – that she was treated differently from a similarly\n\n\n\n                                              -10-\n\fsituated male employee. Not only has she failed to show that the defendant offered anyone else\n\n(male or female) a comparable benefit – the opportunity to maintain a full-time, full-benefits,\n\nforty-hours-per-week schedule – she also has failed to show that a male employee was spared\n\nthe alleged hardship she faced. In other words, she has not identified a single CERT member\n\nwho was allowed to remain in the unit while working at the prison just three days a week.\n\n       To the extent Vredevelt means to show direct evidence of discrimination in connection\n\nwith this claim and in connection with Bosse’s statements about the job, she faces other\n\nshortcomings. For one, she was a member of the team shortly after commencing work with GEO\n\nin 1999 and she has acknowledged that Bosse never had a problem with her working on the\n\nCERT team until after she adopted her three-day-a-week work schedule. For another, the\n\nallegedly discriminatory statement made in connection with her removal from the CERT team\n\ndoes not appear to be “direct evidence” of discrimination, which is to say a statement that\n\nrequires no inference that the challenged action was substantially motivated by discriminatory\n\nanimus. Johnson, 319 F.3d at 865 (“[D]irect evidence of discrimination does not require a\n\nfactfinder to draw any inferences in order to conclude that the challenged employment action\n\nwas motivated at least in part by prejudice against members of the protected group.”) (emphasis\n\nadded); Sniecinski, 666 N.W.2d at 193 (noting that a plaintiff must “present direct proof that the\n\ndiscriminatory animus was causally related to the adverse decision” and that direct evidence\n\nrequires proof that “discriminatory animus was . . . a substantial or motivating factor in the\n\ndecision”). As Vredevelt herself says in her affidavit, “When affiant questioned Deputy Warden\n\nBosse why she was not being renewed for her CCW permit [concealed weapons permit], Bosse\n\n\n\n                                              -11-\n\freplied that if she didn’t like his authority, then she should be home barefoot and pregnant.” J.A.\n\n808. But these statements require us to draw the inference that the controversy surrounding her\n\nCCW permit was motivated by, and was in preparation for, her removal from the CERT team.\n\nProving that there is a distinction between the two, Vredevelt says later in the same affidavit that\n\nBosse denied her permission to work on the CERT team not because her CCW permit had\n\nexpired but because “she was only a part-time employee.” Id.\n\n       For still another reason, GEO has presented evidence – unrebutted by Vredevelt –\n\nshowing that she would have been removed from the team regardless of any impermissible\n\ngender-based motive. See Sniecinski, 666 N.W.2d at 193 (rejecting a direct evidence claim as\n\na matter of law because the plaintiff failed to establish a causal link between the animus and the\n\nadverse decision); Hein v. All-American Plywood Co., 232 F.3d 482, 488-89 (6th Cir. 2000)\n\n(rejecting direct evidence claim that failed to establish both “that the plaintiff’s employer was\n\npredisposed to discriminate [and] . . . that the employer acted on that predisposition”).\n\nWarden Elo testified that it was important for a CERT member to be available five days a week\n\nso that the Facility could maximize the number of CERT members available on each of the three\n\ndaily shifts. And Vredevelt did not present any evidence to rebut GEO’s proof that the dismissal\n\nfrom the team was based on this eminently non-discriminatory reason.\n\n               C.      Failure To Provide A Comparable CERT Facility\n\n       Vredevelt also alleges that she suffered an adverse employment action when GEO\n\n“forced” her to change into her CERT gear in the men’s locker room. Specifically, Vredevelt\n\ncontends that no separate changing facilities were provided to women CERT members. GEO,\n\n\n\n                                               -12-\n\fhowever, presented evidence that there was a women’s restroom near the locker room where the\n\nCERT gear was stored. In addition, GEO noted that there were stalls in the men’s restroom\n\nwhere at least one other female CERT member changed clothes. Thus, as GEO contends, there\n\nwere other options available to Vredevelt but she opted not to take advantage of these\n\nalternatives. In addressing this issue, the district court acknowledged that this situation was not\n\nideal but determined that women CERT members, including Vredevelt, had other options and\n\nwere not “forced to undress in front of the men.” At most, Vredevelt would have been\n\n“inconvenienced” by having to gather her CERT gear, carry it to the women’s restroom, and\n\nchange in a different location from the male members of the CERT team. And as previously\n\nnoted, a mere inconvenience does not constitute a materially adverse employment action. Meyer,\n\n619 N.W.2d at 188.\n\n               D.     Failure To Receive Promotion To Sergeant\n\n       Vredevelt also argues that she suffered an adverse employment action when GEO\n\nselected a male CO for promotion to sergeant instead of her. A failure to promote may constitute\n\nan adverse employment action. Allen v. Mich. Dept. of Corrections, 165 F.3d 405 (6th Cir.\n\n1999) (construing adverse employment action under Title VII). But even if she suffered an\n\nadverse employment action when she was not promoted, Vredevelt’s claim nonetheless fails\n\nunder either an indirect or direct evidence approach.\n\n       In the context of a failure-to-promote claim, a plaintiff seeking to use indirect evidence\n\nmust demonstrate that: “(1) she belongs to a protected class, (2) she suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action, (3) she was qualified for the position, and (4) the job was given to another\n\n\n\n                                               -13-\n\fperson under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.” Hazle v.\n\nFord Motor Co., 628 N.W.2d 515, 523 (Mich. 2001). Although Vredevelt is able to satisfy the\n\nfirst two elements of this test, she cannot establish the remaining two elements by simply\n\nshowing that she was qualified for the position and yet a male candidate was chosen. See id. at\n\n525. Rather, she must present evidence that the employer’s actions, “if otherwise unexplained,\n\nare more likely than not based on the consideration of impermissible factors.” Id. In short, an\n\ninference of unlawful discrimination does not arise, as a matter of law, merely because an\n\nemployer has chosen between two qualified candidates. Id.\n\n       GEO offered several permissible explanations for promoting DeWolf over Vredevelt.\n\nAmong them were DeWolf’s military background (which it thought was well-suited to the\n\ncorrectional setting), the fact that he had been a CERT team leader, and the fact that he possessed\n\n“natural leadership ability.” In contrast, GEO explained, Vredevelt lacked military experience,\n\nhad only been a CERT team member and “lacked leadership.” In addition, GEO noted that\n\nDeWolf scored higher than Vredevelt on the promotion board exam. According to GEO,\n\nDeWolf in the end was simply more qualified than Vredevelt.\n\n       In response, Vredevelt contends that she was the more qualified candidate for the\n\nsergeant’s position. Specifically, she asserts that she had taken college criminal justice classes,\n\nwhile DeWolf had not, and that she had more seniority than DeWolf. Given GEO’s recitation\n\nof DeWolf’s qualifications, Vredevelt’s allegation that she was more qualified for the position\n\nthan DeWolf is unpersuasive. At best, the comparison in this case is between two qualified\n\nemployees.\n\n\n\n                                               -14-\n\f       Even if Vredevelt’s claims had sufficed to establish a prima facie case, she still could not\n\nprevail. Under the burden-shifting framework used in indirect evidence cases, GEO’s legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons for hiring DeWolf instead of Vredevelt shift the burden once again\n\nto Vredevelt, requiring her to produce evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to conclude\n\nthat GEO’s explanations are a pretext for gender discrimination. The district court, however,\n\ncorrectly concluded that she did not meet this burden. Other than her subjective claim that she\n\nwas more qualified than DeWolf, she has failed to present evidence to support her claim that\n\nGEO’s stated reasons for hiring DeWolf are a pretext. See Hazle, 628 N.W.2d at 521-22; Town,\n\n568 N.W.2d at 72.\n\n       In Texas Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 (1981), the Supreme Court held\n\nthat, when the objective qualifications of a protected class member are equal to an employee who\n\nwas not a member of the protected class, the employer has the discretion to choose among these\n\nemployees, provided that the decision is not based on unlawful criteria. Even though a court\n\nmay conclude that the employer misjudged the qualifications, that fact in and of itself does not\n\nexpose the employer to liability. Id. at 259. In summary, Vredevelt’s evidence merely raises a\n\nquestion about GEO’s business judgment, but such questions are insufficient to overcome\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n       Vredevelt’s claims are likewise unsuccessful under a direct evidence theory of\n\ndiscrimination. As an initial matter, Vredevelt is less than clear in explaining which statements\n\nshe means to use to establish direct evidence of discrimination. But even if we address each of\n\nthe potential candidates for this theory, none of them presents “credible, direct evidence of\n\n\n\n                                               -15-\n\fwrongful discrimination” with respect to her non-promotion claim. See Hein, 232 F.3d at 488.\n\nFor instance, Bosse’s “barefoot and pregnant” comment is not direct evidence of discrimination\n\nbecause it was neither made by a decisionmaker nor conceivably made in connection with the\n\npromotion decision. Most notably, the comment was made almost a year after DeWolf’s\n\npromotion. See Sniecinski, 666 N.W.2d at 193 (noting that a plaintiff must “present direct proof\n\nthat the discriminatory animus was causally related to the adverse decision”). Nor does\n\nVredevelt’s recollection of a comment by Officer Stuart Morin amount to direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination. Vredevelt refers to this statement in her brief in the following way: “Officer\n\nMorin . . . recalled that a captain who apparently had input on the promotion decision or\n\nscoring stated that . . . .” Br. for App’t at 9 (emphasis added). By its terms, this statement\n\nspeculates about the decision-making capacity of this captain; it does not provide direct, credible\n\nevidence of discriminatory animus by a decisionmaker. Finally, Jill Sable’s statements about\n\nthe manner and tone of questioning in Vredevelt’s interview are, at best, indirect evidence of\n\nanimus. Johnson, 319 F.3d at 865 (“[D]irect evidence of discrimination does not require a\n\nfactfinder to draw any inferences in order to conclude that the challenged employment action\n\nwas motivated at least in part by prejudice against members of the protected group.”).\n\n       That leaves the alleged statement by Bosse, overheard by Lt. McDaniel, repeated to\n\nVredevelt and repeated once more in Vredevelt’s affidavit, to the effect that Bosse would never\n\npromote a woman as long as he was a Deputy Warden. But, critically, this statement was not\n\nmade by a decisionmaker. All agree, including Vredevelt, that Warden Elo made the decision\n\nto hire DeWolf, and no one has argued that Elo had any discriminatory animus either in general\n\n\n\n                                               -16-\n\for with respect to this decision. In suggesting that Bosse ought to be treated as a decisionmaker\n\nwith respect to this decision, Vredevelt has done so in the most fainthearted of ways. In her\n\nopening brief on appeal, she argued (1) that Bosse was a “decisionmaker” with respect to the\n\nCERT team decision, not with respect to the promotion decision, App’t Br. at 20 n. 11 and (2)\n\nthat Bosse at most “influence[d] her non-promotion,” id. at 18, a statement that would apply to\n\nanyone with any input in the decisionmaking process. While she attempts to make the necessary\n\n“decisionmaking” argument in her reply brief, she does so at a time when the point had already\n\nbeen waived and at any rate she does so without citing a single case in support of this less than\n\nself-evident proposition. But even if we were to address the issue in the interest of completeness,\n\nas the dissent does, the cases identified by the dissent do not establish that Bosse was a\n\ndecisionmaker, much less the decisionmaker with respect to this decision. Bosse was one of\n\nthree members of a committee tasked with interviewing the candidates; he did not tabulate the\n\ninterview scores; and although he met with Warden Elo to discuss the scores, Vredevelt offers\n\nno evidence that Warden Elo adopted Bosse’s assessment rather than forming his own\n\nconclusion (or even adopting another interviewer’s assessment). The cited cases all are at least\n\none step removed from this situation. See DiCarlo v. Potter, 358 F.3d 408, 413 (6th Cir. 2004)\n\n(holding that a supervisor’s memo to the decisionmaker recommending discharge of an\n\nemployee justified imputation of the supervisor’s animus to the decisionmaker after the\n\ndecisionmaker “agreed with the assessment and approved” the recommended discharge); Wells\n\nv. New Cherokee Corp., 58 F.3d 233, 238 (6th Cir. 1995) (holding that a subordinate’s animus\n\ncould be imputed to the decisionmaker, but involving a situation where the two worked so\n\n\n\n                                               -17-\n\fclosely together that they acted jointly with respect to personnel decisions); Hussain v. Highgate\n\nHotels, Inc., 126 Fed. Appx. 256, 262 (6th Cir. 2005) (unpublished opinion) (holding that the\n\nanimus of a single individual, not a committee, who made a recommendation to those in\n\nauthority, then “awaited their approval,” could be imputed to the decisionmaker).\n\n               E.     Constructive Discharge\n\n       Vredevelt also argues that she suffered an adverse employment action by being\n\nconstructively discharged from her employment at the Facility. To establish a prima facie case\n\nof constructive discharge, an employee must present evidence that her employer deliberately\n\nmade working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person would feel compelled to quit\n\nthe job. Champion v. Nationwide Sec., Inc., 545 N.W.2d 596, 600 (Mich. 1996). In short,\n\nVredevelt has not presented evidence to support this claim.\n\n       When Vredevelt took a second job, GEO accommodated her request to work part-time.\n\nHowever, when she realized that she would not receive full benefits, GEO again agreed to allow\n\nher to work forty hours over the course of three days. Certainly, these accommodations were a\n\nsubstantial benefit to Vredevelt and were beyond what GEO was required to do. Moreover,\n\nVredevelt indicated in her resignation letter to the company that she “was grateful and thankful\n\nof the time and effort [GEO] ha[d] given [to her].” She further stated that “there [was] no reason\n\n[she] would not come back to work for WCC in the future.” These concessions are contradictory\n\nto Vredevelt’s claim that working conditions at the Facility were so intolerable that a reasonable\n\nperson would feel compelled to quit. Rather, the evidence of record supports an opposite\n\n\n\n\n                                              -18-\n\fconclusion: Vredevelt left to take a job for more money. Accordingly, Vredevelt did not present\n\nsufficient evidence to support a constructive discharge claim.\n\n       II.     Hostile Work Environment Claim\n\n       The MCRA prohibits an employer from discriminating because of sex, which includes\n\nsexual harassment. M.C.L § 37.2202(1); M.C.L. § 37.2103 (I); Chambers v. Trettco, Inc., 614\n\nN.W.2d 910 (Mich. 2000). Specifically, M.C.L. § 37.2103(I) provides that:\n\n       Discrimination because of sex includes sexual harassment. Sexual harassment\n       means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal\n       or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature under the following\n       conditions:\n\n       (i)     Submission to the conduct or communication is made a term or condition\n               either explicitly or implicitly to obtain employment....\n\n       (ii)    Submission to or rejection of the conduct or communication by an\n               individual is used as a factor in decisions affecting the individual's\n               employment....\n\n       (iii)   The conduct or communication has the purpose or effect of substantially\n               interfering with an individual's employment ... or creating an intimidating,\n               hostile, or offensive employment ... environment.\n\n       Sexual harassment under one of the first two subsections is commonly referred to as quid\n\npro quo harassment. Sexual harassment under the third subsection is commonly labeled hostile\n\nwork environment harassment. Chambers, 614 N.W.2d at 915. To establish a claim of hostile\n\nwork environment harassment, an employee must prove the following by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence:\n\n       (1)     the employee belonged to a protected group;\n       (2)     the employee was subjected to communication or conduct on the basis of\n               sex;\n\n\n\n                                               -19-\n\f        (3)      the employee was subjected to unwelcome sexual conduct or\n                 communication;\n        (4)       the unwelcome sexual conduct or communication was intended to or in\n                 fact did substantially interfere with the employee's employment or created\n                 an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and\n        (5)      respondeat superior\n\nElezovic v. Ford Motor Co., 673 N.W.2d 776 (Mich. Ct. App. 2003). With regard to the\n\nrespondeat superior element3 of a claim of hostile work environment harassment, an employer\n\nmay avoid liability “if it adequately investigated and took prompt and appropriate remedial\n\naction upon notice of the alleged hostile work environment.” Prompt and appropriate remedial\n\naction will permit an employer to avoid liability if the plaintiff accuses either a co-worker or a\n\nsupervisor of sexual harassment. An employer, of course, must have notice of the alleged\n\nharassment before being held liable for not implementing corrective action. Chambers, 614\n\nN.W.2d at 916.\n\n        Thus, an employer may avoid liability for a claim of sexual harassment if it does not have\n\nactual or constructive notice of the alleged harassment. Radtke v. Everett, 501 N.W.2d 155\n\n(Mich. 1993). The employee gives the employer actual notice if she complains about the\n\nharassment to higher management. McCarthy v. State Farm Ins. Co., 428 N.W.2d 692, 695\n\n(Mich. Ct. App. 1988). If the employee never complained to higher management, she can prove\n\nthe employer had constructive notice “by showing the pervasiveness of the harassment, which\n\ngives rise to the inference of knowledge or constructive knowledge.” Id. Notice is considered\n\n\n\n3\n         The Supreme Court of Michigan has specifically held that the federal principles of vicarious liability\nrelated to sexual harassment claims brought under Title VII do not apply to claims brought under Michigan’s\nCivil Rights Act. See Chambers, 614 N.W.2d 910. Therefore, with respect to this issue, the Title VII cases\nare inapplicable.\n\n                                                     -20-\n\fadequate if, under the totality of the circumstances and viewing the circumstances objectively,\n\na reasonable employer would have known that there was a substantial probability that an\n\nemployee was being sexually harassed. Sheridan v. Forest Hills Pub. School, 637 N.W.2d 536\n\n(Mich. Ct. App. 2001).\n\n       In this case, the Facility had a sexual harassment policy in place. The policy provided\n\nemployees with two sexual harassment coordinators to which they were directed to report any\n\ncomplaints of harassment. However, the policy further provided that, if an employee does not\n\nfeel comfortable reporting a complaint to the coordinators, the employee should report the\n\nincident to someone within supervision. Vredevelt has conceded that she did not report many\n\nof the alleged instances of sexual harassment. Thus, GEO did not have the opportunity to\n\ninvestigate and take remedial action due to complaints from Vredevelt. Specifically, during her\n\ndeposition Vredevelt admitted that she did not report the following incidents: (1) Deputy Warden\n\nBosse’s comment that she should be home “barefoot and pregnant”; (2) Officer Griffin’s\n\ncomment to her about her “camel toe” when she wore her fatigues; (3) the CERT members’ bets\n\nabout what color underwear she wore and their requests to see her tattoos; and (4) a fellow\n\ncorrections officer’s comments of “let’s go for a quick f - - k” and “give me a b - - w job.”\n\n       Notwithstanding this lack of actual notice, Vredevelt contends that GEO had constructive\n\nknowledge of the hostile environment at the Facility due to other women’s complaints. In\n\naddition, she argues that there was a general pervasiveness of sexual harassment toward females\n\nat the Facility. Specifically, Vredevelt asserts that women were commonly called “pod bitches”\n\nand “control bitches” and that they were never assigned to the good post positions. Thus,\n\n\n\n                                             -21-\n\fVredevelt asserts that GEO was constructively aware of the sexual harassment due to an overall\n\nnegative attitude toward, and poor treatment of, females throughout the Facility. Again,\n\nhowever, the record does not support Vredevelt’s contention.\n\n       Vredevelt admitted that she remained silent about most of the alleged incidents and\n\ncomplained about only two incidents over a three year period. Further, she testified during her\n\ndeposition that much of the alleged conduct was “not so apparent.” Moreover, in her resignation\n\nletter to the company, Vredevelt expressed how much she enjoyed working at the Facility, noting\n\nthat “[t]here [was] no reason [she] would not come back to work for WCC in the future.” Again,\n\nVredevelt failed to put GEO on notice of the alleged sexual harassment. Although she claims\n\nthat the sexual harassment complaints of other female employees were sufficient to put GEO on\n\nconstructive notice of the hostile environment at the Facility, we cannot conclude based on the\n\ntotality of the circumstances that this evidence establishes that the alleged sexual harassment was\n\nsuch that GEO had constructive notice. See e.g., Sheridan, 637 N.W.2d at 545-46; Elezovic, 637\n\nN.W.2d at 783 (complaint of alleged sexual harassment of plaintiff’s co-worker cannot be said\n\nto establish notice with respect to plaintiff’s claim of harassment).\n\n       Because Vredevelt failed to show that she provided actual or constructive notice to GEO\n\nconcerning the existence of a sexually hostile working environment, it cannot be liable for her\n\nhostile environment claim. Chambers, 614 N.W.2d at 916; Radtke, 501 N.W.2d at 168. Thus,\n\nthe district court did not err in granting summary judgment to GEO regarding this claim.\n\n       III.    Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Claim\n\n\n\n\n                                               -22-\n\f       The district court was also correct in concluding that Vredevelt failed to present a genuine\n\nissue of material fact in support of her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nIntentional infliction of emotional distress is proved by the following elements: (1) extreme and\n\noutrageous conduct; (2) intent or recklessness; (3) causation; and (4) severe emotional distress.\n\nRoberts v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., 374 N.W.2d 905, 908 (Mich. 1985). The district court\n\ndetermined that Vredevelt failed to present evidence demonstrating extreme and outrageous\n\nconduct. To be extreme and outrageous, Michigan courts have stated that the conduct must be\n\nso extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and to be regarded as\n\natrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community. Id. at 908-09. We agree that\n\nVredevelt’s allegations do not state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nBecause Vredevelt cannot establish a prima facie case, the district court properly granted\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -23-\n\f       CLAY, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part. I join Parts I-A, C and E, as well\n\nas Parts II and III of the majority’s opinion. I write separately because the majority ignores or\n\ndiscounts Vredevelt’s direct evidence of discrimination in connection with her removal from the\n\nCERT team and failure to be promoted to sergeant. I therefore respectfully dissent from Parts\n\nI-B and D of the majority opinion.\n\n                                               I.\n\n       A.     Removal From the CERT Team\n\n       The majority concludes that Vredevelt was removed from the CERT team because of\n\nmodifications in her work schedule. While this is ostensibly a legitimate nondiscriminatory\n\nreason, the majority inappropriately discounts the fact that when Vredevelt questioned Deputy\n\nWarden Bosse about her dismissal, Bosse responded that “if she didn’t like his authority, then\n\nshe should be home barefoot and pregnant.” (Joint Appendix, “J.A.,” at 808.) This type of\n\nsexist comment constitutes direct evidence of gender discrimination because it suggests that\n\nVredevelt’s sex played a role in Warden Bosse’s decision to remove her from the CERT team.\n\nSee Harrison v. Olde Fin. Corp., 572 N.W.2d 679, 683 (Mich. Ct. App. 1997) (“For example,\n\nracial slurs by a decisionmaker constitute direct evidence of racial discrimination that is\n\nsufficient to get the plaintiff’s case to the jury.”) (quotation and citation omitted); see also\n\nJacklyn v. Schering-Plough Healthcare Prods. Sales Corp., 176 F.3d 921, 926 (6th Cir. 1999)\n\n(“[D]irect evidence is that evidence which, if believed, requires the conclusion that unlawful\n\ndiscrimination was at least a motivating factor in the employer’s actions.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                              -24-\n\f       In a case such as this, involving direct evidence of discrimination and mixed motives,\n\n“i.e., where the adverse employment decision could have been based on both legitimate and\n\nlegally impermissible reasons, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant’s discriminatory animus\n\nwas more likely than not a ‘substantial’ or ‘motivating’ factor in the decision.” Sniecinski v.\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of Mich., 666 N.W.2d 186, 192-93 (Mich. 2003) (quoting Price\n\nWaterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 244 (1989) (Plurality Opinion)). Thus, the proper inquiry\n\nat summary judgment is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Vredevelt\n\nas the non-moving party, a reasonable trier of fact could find that Vredevelt’s sex was a\n\nsubstantial or motivating factor in Warden Bosse’s decision to remove her from the CERT team.\n\nInstead of according proper weight to the ‘barefoot and pregnant’ comment, the majority\n\ndismisses it out of hand, giving conclusive weight to Defendant’s proffered reason for removing\n\nVredevelt from the CERT team. The majority’s analysis is inappropriate because at the\n\nsummary judgment stage, it is not this Court’s role to weigh the evidence. Sterling China Co.\n\nv. Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics & Allied Workers Local No. 24, 357 F.3d 546, 551 (6th Cir.\n\n2004) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986)) (“The judge is not to\n\nweigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter, but rather determine whether there is\n\na genuine issue for trial.”). In my opinion, the direct evidence proffered by Vredevelt creates\n\na genuine issue of material fact on the question of whether discriminatory animus was a\n\nsubstantial or motivating factor in Warden Bosse’s decision to remove her from the CERT team,\n\n\n\n\n                                             -25-\n\fsuch that a reasonable jury could find in her favor. Therefore, I would reverse the district court’s\n\ngrant of summary judgment to Defendant on the CERT team removal issue.4\n\n        B.      Failure to Receive Promotion\n\n        I would also reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment to Defendant on the\n\npromotion issue. I do not think that the evidence supports Vredevelt’s claim that she was more\n\nqualified than DeWolf for the sergeant’s position, and I agree with the majority’s position that\n\n“[a]t best, the comparison in this case is between two qualified employees.” (Majority Op. at\n\n15.) Once again, however, the majority discounts Vredevelt’s direct evidence of discriminatory\n\nanimus by individuals who were involved in deciding whether to promote her, thereby\n\ninappropriately weighing the evidence and usurping the role of the trier of fact. Id.; see also\n\nCline v. Catholic Diocese of Toledo, 206 F.3d 651, 657-58 (6th Cir. 2000) (“No doubt,\n\n[defendant] may have sharp retorts to many of [plaintiff’s] factual claims . . . [which] could well\n\nconvince a trier of fact of its case. But at this stage in the trial, the district court’s and our role\n\nis not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter, but to determine whether there\n\n4\n Although it is unnecessary for the majority to address the issue given its conclusion that summary judgment\nwas properly granted, I would also find that removal from the CERT team constituted a materially adverse\nemployment action. Materially adverse employment actions include “‘termination of employment, a\ndemotion evidence by a decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits,\nsignificantly diminished material responsibilities, or other indices that might be unique to a particular\nsituation.’” Wilcoxon v. Minn. Mining & Mfg. Co., 597 N.W.2d 250, 257 (Mich. Ct. App. 1999) (quoting\nKocsis v. Multi-Care Mgmt., Inc., 97 F.3d 876, 886 (6th Cir. 1996) (citations omitted)). It is undisputed that\nCERT team members received a small amount of additional monetary compensation. Perhaps more\nimportantly, however, Defendant’s own arguments support the notion that CERT team membership was\nprestigious and an important element in receiving a promotion. One of the reasons offered by Defendant in\nsupport of the decision to promote DeWolf over Vredevelt was DeWolf’s position as CERT team leader. If\nthis is true, then Vredevelt’s removal from the CERT team, and by extension, the elimination of her ability\nto become a CERT team leader, would materially reduce her chances of receiving a promotion in the future.\nIn this sense, an employee who is not a CERT team member has ‘a less distinguished title’ or position for\npromotion purposes than a CERT team member. Therefore, Vredevelt’s dismissal from the CERT team\narguably constituted an adverse employment action.\n\n                                                    -26-\n\fis a genuine issue for trial. To do so, the court must look at the evidence and make all reasonable\n\ninferences in the light most favorable to [plaintiff].”) (internal citations and quotation marks\n\nomitted). Officer Stuart Morin testified that he was present when a captain who had been on the\n\nreview board for Vredevelt’s promotion stated that “women don’t belong in the prison and\n\nshouldn’t be in that position, they are not capable of doing it.” (J.A. at 852.) Vredevelt also\n\nswore in an affidavit and testified at her deposition that Lieutenant Kevin McDaniels informed\n\nher that Deputy Warden Bosse specifically told him Vredevelt was not promoted because Bosse\n\n“would not promote any females while he was deputy warden.” Id. at 450, 807. Additionally,\n\nJill Sable, the Personnel Director who participated in Vredevelt’s promotion review, testified that\n\nDeputy Warden Bosse was tougher in his questioning of Vredevelt than of DeWolf and Kevin\n\nCox, another male candidate for the promotion, and further, that the questions Bosse asked\n\nVredevelt were “in a different tone and in a different way” and “were more detailed.” Id. at 846.\n\nFinally, there is the ‘barefoot and pregnant’ comment made by Deputy Warden Bosse in\n\nconnection with Vredevelt’s removal from the CERT team, which suggests that discriminatory\n\nanimus colors Bosse’s employment decisions.\n\n       The majority concludes that Warden Elo made the decision of whom to promote, and\n\ntherefore, Vredevelt’s direct evidence of discriminatory animus by Deputy Warden Bosse and\n\nothers is irrelevant. However, the record reflects that although Warden Elo was technically the\n\nfinal decisionmaker, the manner in which the promotion decision was made left a great deal of\n\ninfluence to individuals other than Elo. Contrary to the majority’s claims, we have previously\n\nheld that “courts must consider as probative evidence any statements made by those individuals\n\n\n\n                                               -27-\n\fwho are in fact meaningfully involved in the decision to terminate [or promote] an employee.”\n\nWells v. New Cherokee Corp., 58 F.3d 233, 238 (6th Cir. 1995) (emphasis added); see also\n\nHussain v. Highgate Hotels, Inc., 126 Fed. Appx. 256, 262 (6th Cir. 2005) (unpublished\n\ndecision) (stating that in employment discrimination context, direct evidence “shows that the\n\nperson who made the challenged decision, or was otherwise meaningfully involved in that\n\ndecision, had a bias or that bias affected the challenged decision”) (emphasis added). Warden\n\nElo selected a three-member promotion board, which was chaired by Deputy Warden Bosse as\n\nthe Deputy Warden of Security. Each of these board members interviewed and evaluated the\n\ncandidates for promotion, and provided a scored review. The scores were then tabulated by\n\nSable, as Personnel Director, and given to Warden Elo, who reviewed the scores and discussed\n\nthem with Deputy Warden Bosse. There is no evidence that Warden Elo interviewed the\n\ncandidates or otherwise independently interacted with them; to the contrary, the evidence\n\ndemonstrates that the materials that formed the basis for Warden Elo’s decision were provided\n\nand compiled by other individuals, most notably Deputy Warden Bosse. Therefore, the three-\n\nmember board, and Deputy Warden Bosse, while not the ultimate decisionmakers, had a\n\nsignificant amount of influence in deciding which candidate would be promoted, and their\n\ndiscriminatory comments are clearly relevant evidence in assessing Vredevelt’s claim. Cf.\n\nDiCarlo v. Potter, 358 F.3d 408, 416-17 (6th Cir. 2004) (holding that derogatory comments by\n\nsupervisor constituted direct evidence of discriminatory animus, because although manager made\n\nultimate decision to terminate the plaintiff, supervisor made recommendation to manager and\n\nwas therefore meaningfully involved in the decision to fire the plaintiff).\n\n\n\n                                              -28-\n\f        Additionally, because Vredevelt has produced direct evidence of discriminatory animus\n\nby individuals involved in the promotion decision, the majority errs in suggesting that the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework is appropriate. See Harrison, 572 N.W.2d at\n\n683; DiCarlo, 358 F.3d at 415. Defendant claims that DeWolf was promoted due to his military\n\nbackground and higher test scores, which could be legitimate reasons for the decision to promote\n\nhim over Vredevelt.5 See Sniecinski, 666 N.W.2d at 193 (citing Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at\n\n244-45) (stating that a mixed motive case is one in which “the adverse employment decision\n\ncould have been based on both legitimate and legally impermissible reasons,” and “a defendant\n\nmay avoid liability by proving that it would have made the same decision even if the\n\nimpermissible consideration had not played a role in the decision.”). Thus, the relevant question\n\nfor this Court is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Vredevelt, there\n\nis a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of whether her sex was a substantial or motivating\n\nfactor in the decision not to promote her. See id. at 192-93. Despite Defendant’s proffered\n\nreasons for promoting DeWolf, given the direct evidence of discriminatory animus by Deputy\n\nWarden Bosse and another member of the promotion review board, a reasonable trier of fact\n\ncould find that discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the decision not to\n\npromote Vredevelt. Therefore, I would reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment\n\nto Defendant on the promotion issue.\n\n                                                      II.\n\n\n\n5\n I question whether the test score issue is significant given that only 1.5 percentage points separated Vredevelt\nand DeWolf’s scores, and both scored highly on the test, i.e., 97% for Vredevelt versus 98.5% for DeWolf.\n\n\n                                                      -29-\n\f       I join the majority in upholding the grant of summary judgment to Defendant on\n\nVredevelt’s hostile work environment and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims, as\n\nwell as her disparate treatment claims involving post assignments, changing facilities, and\n\nconstructive discharge.    However, because Vredevelt has presented direct evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory animus in connection with her removal from the CERT team and her failure to\n\nbe promoted to sergeant, summary judgment is inappropriate on these issues. I therefore\n\nrespectfully dissent from Parts I-B and D of the majority opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -30-\n\f",

REEVES, District Judge. Plaintiff-Appellant Erica Vredevelt appeals the\n\ndecision of the district court granting summary judgment to Defendant-Appellee The GEO\n\nGroup, Inc. on her gender discrimination and sexual harassment claims pursuant to Michigan’s\n\nElliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, M.C.L. § 37.2101 et seq., and intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress claim under Michigan common law. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district\n\ncourt’s judgment.\n\n                                          BACKGROUND\n\n\n\n*\n         The Honorable Danny C. Reeves, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky,\nsitting by designation.\n\n                                                   -1-\n\f       The GEO Group, Inc., formerly known as Wackenhut Corrections Corp. (“GEO”),\n\noperates the Michigan Youth Correctional Facility (the “Facility”) in Baldwin, Michigan, under\n\na contract with the Michigan Department of Corrections. The Facility is a maximum security\n\nyouth detention prison housing inmates ranging in age from 13 to 16 years. GEO hired\n\nVredevelt as a Corrections Officer (“CO”) out of its first training academy in 1999. She worked\n\nat the Facility until April 2002 when she left to take a new job. Shortly after beginning her\n\nemployment, Vredevelt became a member of the Facility’s Corrections Emergency Response\n\nTeam (“CERT”) – a small unit of COs that responds to critical incidents at the Facility involving\n\ninmates.\n\n       As a CERT team member, Vredevelt received additional compensation of $20 to $30 per\n\nmonth. At the Facility, COs are required to work at various posts, including the Medical\n\nDepartment, Visitation, Recreation, ARV (emergency response vehicle), Control Center,\n\nHousing Pods (inmate residence areas), Utility (a rotating post that helps where needed), Tower\n\n(gun towers surrounding the Facility’s perimeter), Checkpoint, and Segregation (a housing unit\n\nreserved for violent and disruptive inmates). GEO has the authority to assign a CO to any post.\n\nSpecifically, the Collective Bargaining Agreement between GEO and the CO’s Union provides\n\nthat “the direction of the working force . . . shall be vested exclusively with the employer.”\n\nIt further provides that GEO “shall have the right . . . to determine work schedules and type\n\nof work.”\n\n       For the first six months of her employment, Vredevelt worked in Segregation. Following\n\nthat assignment, she worked Utility for over a year. She also worked without objection or\n\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\fincident in the Medical Department, Recreation, the Towers and the Housing Pods as those\n\nduties were assigned to her.\n\n       As a CERT member, Vredevelt was required to respond quickly to critical incidents\n\ninvolving inmates. GEO stored all of the CERT equipment in a locker room adjacent to the\n\nmen’s bathroom. Upon notification of an incident, team members would gather their gear (leg\n\npads, elbow pads, a helmet, gas mask and shoulder pads) from the locker room and change\n\nclothing and equipment prior to addressing the incident. GEO contends that, as a matter of\n\npersonal preference, Vredevelt would change her clothing and equipment in the men’s locker\n\nroom rather than carry the equipment to the women’s restroom located approximately 20 to 30\n\nfeet away. Vredevelt claims that, because the equipment was too heavy and because it was\n\ndifficult to maneuver past the men, she was forced to change in the men’s locker room so that\n\nshe could respond to emergencies in a timely manner.\n\n       In 2001, Vredevelt applied for a promotion to sergeant. In applying for this position, she\n\nwas required to submit a letter of interest and participate in a Promotion Board interview.\n\nVredevelt was also required to deliver an oral presentation and complete a written exercise.\n\nAlthough Vredevelt was not selected, she acknowledges that the person who received the\n\nposition, Thomas DeWolf, was a qualified candidate.\n\n       At the end of 2001, Vredevelt took a second job outside the Facility. However, she was\n\npermitted by the Warden to work three days a week at the Facility to accommodate her work\n\nschedule.1 Subsequently, in February or March 2002, Vredevelt was removed from the CERT\n\n\n\n1\n       Vredevelt still worked forty hours a week at the Facility but did so over a three-day period.\n\n                                                   -3-\n\fteam by Deputy Warden Daniel Bosse. According to Bosse, Vredevelt was removed from the\n\nteam because she could only work three days a week and GEO could not afford to have one of\n\nits limited number of CERT members unavailable on other work days. Vredevelt never sought\n\nreversal of this decision from Warden Frank Elo. Instead, approximately one week after her\n\nremoval from the CERT team, she left her job at the Facility and started working as a full-time\n\ndeputy with the Ottawa County Sheriff’s Department. Vredevelt testified that she made more\n\nmoney at this job than she did at the Facility.\n\n       Before resigning, Vredevelt wrote to GEO to announce her intentions and reasoning:\n\n       This is a letter regarding my resignation from Wackenhut Corporation/Michigan\n       Juvenile Prison. I Erica R. Vredevelt will be leaving WCC after 2 weeks of\n       service to further my career elsewhere. I am grateful and thankful of the time and\n       effort Wackenhut has given me, my thanks goes to all those officers above and\n       below me in rank who have taken time to train and educate me in the field of\n       corrections. The knowledge and skills I have learned here will help me in [my]\n       future career.\n\n       I leave WCC with a great respect for the staff and corrections officers. They put\n       forth a good effort in teamwork and keeping company standards and mission\n       statements. There is no reason I would not come back to work for WCC in the\n       future. Once again I thank all those who helped me become the corrections\n       officer I am today.\n\n       On October 1, 2003, Vredevelt and nine other plaintiffs filed a Joint Amended Complaint\n\nagainst GEO alleging gender discrimination, sexual harassment and retaliation claims under\n\nMichigan’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, M.C.L. § 37.2101 et seq. (“MCRA”). In addition,\n\nthe group asserted claims for defamation, false imprisonment and intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress under Michigan common law. In her Joint Amended Complaint, Vredevelt\n\nasserted five claims against the Defendant: (1) disparate treatment gender discrimination (Count\n\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\f1); (2) hostile work environment (Count II); (3) retaliation (Count III); (4) intentional infliction\n\nof emotional distress (Count IV); and (5) false imprisonment (Count V). Subsequently,\n\nVredevelt abandoned her false imprisonment and retaliation claims. Two of the ten plaintiffs\n\nvoluntarily dismissed their claims and six of the ten settled their claims for nominal amounts.\n\nThe district court dismissed the claims of the remaining two plaintiffs (including Vredevelt) on\n\nsummary judgment. That dismissal is the subject of the present appeal.\n\n       Vredevelt’s gender discrimination claim is based on the contention that she and other\n\nwomen were never assigned to the best post positions and that she was improperly removed from\n\nthe CERT team. She also contends that she was passed over for the sergeant job despite being\n\nmore qualified than the male CO who received the promotion. In addition, Vredevelt claims that\n\nshe and the other female CERT members were not provided with a separate changing facility\n\nand, therefore, were forced to change in front of male CERT officers.\n\n       In support of her sexual harassment claim, Vredevelt alleged that GEO employees –\n\nprimarily Deputy Warden Bosse – made comments that were offensive. These comments\n\nincluded:\n\n       1.      Bosse allegedly told Vredevelt that she should be home “barefoot and\n               pregnant.”\n\n       2.      Bosse allegedly told Vredevelt that she was incapable of performing utility\n               or transport after she went part time.\n\n       3.      Someone told Vredevelt that Bosse said that he would never promote a\n               female.\n\n       4.      New corrections officers allegedly made comments to Vredevelt such as\n               “who do you think you are?” or “your s - - - does not stink” in reference\n               to the fact that she wore fatigues instead of a uniform.\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       5.      Bosse made a comment that Vredevelt “was a female and [she] couldn’t\n               handle [herself] around inmates.”\n\n       6.      Officer Griffin allegedly made a comment to Vredevelt about her “camel\n               toe” when she wore her fatigues.\n\n       7.      Vredevelt’s fellow CERT members allegedly made bets about the color of\n               her underwear and asked to see her tattoos.\n\n       8.      A fellow corrections officer made comments to the effect of “let’s go for\n               a quick f - - k” and “give me a b - - w job.”\n\n       9.      After a male officer commented that she was not performing “pat downs”\n               properly, Vredevelt states that she was required to pat down the\n               complaining officer.\n\nVredevelt alleges that these comments support her sexual harassment and hostile work\n\nenvironment claims. In addition, Vredevelt has asserted a claim of intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress.\n\n                                 STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       A district court’s grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.

Ct. App. 1999)). According to the Michigan courts, a “materially adverse” employment\n\naction includes: termination of employment; demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or\n\nsalary; a less distinguished title; a material loss of benefits; significantly diminished material\n\nresponsibilities; or other indices that might be unique to a particular situation. Wilcoxon, 597\n\nN.W.2d at 258.\n\n         Here, Vredevelt contends that she met this burden because she: (1) received poor post\n\nassignments; (2) was removed from the CERT team; (3) was not provided with comparable\n\nfacility in which to change into her CERT gear; (4) failed to receive a promotion to sergeant; and\n\n(5) was constructively discharged. Vredevelt contends that the actions by GEO were based on\n\nher gender. Thus, she alleges that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on this\n\nclaim.\n\n                A.     The Post Assignments\n\n         Vredevelt alleges that she and the other female employees working at the Facility were\n\nnever assigned to the best post assignments. During her deposition, however, Vredevelt admitted\n\nthat the desirability of the post positions was subjective. Specifically, she indicated that she\n\nparticularly liked to work segregation but others did not because “it was the toughest to work.”\n\nFurther, although Vredevelt claimed that the pod position was undesirable, one of her former co-\n\nplaintiffs testified that she like working “a couple of the pods.”\n\n         Vredevelt failed to demonstrate that her assignment to work certain post positions\n\nconstituted an adverse employment action. As noted in Wilcoxon, in order for an employment\n\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\faction to be adverse for purposes of a discrimination claim, “a plaintiff’s subjective impressions\n\nas to the desirability of one position over another [are] not controlling.” Wilcoxon, 597 N.W.2d\n\nat 258 (citing Kocsis v Multi-Care Mgmt., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"727337\"><a href=\"/opinion/727337/linda-m-kocsis-v-multi-care-management-inc-dba-bath-manor-special/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 886 (6th Cir. 1996)). The\n\nCollective Bargaining Agreement between GEO and the CO’s Union provides that GEO “shall\n\nhave the right . . . to determine work schedules and type of work . . .” Moreover, as a CO,\n\nGEO could assign Vredevelt to any post. Certainly, GEO was not required to accommodate the\n\npost preferences of its employees. Thus, GEO’s assignment of Vredevelt to one post position\n\ninstead of another cannot be deemed an adverse employment action.\n\n               B.     Removal From The CERT Team\n\n       Vredevelt also contends that she suffered an adverse employment action when she was\n\nremoved from the CERT team. As a CERT team member, Vredevelt was on a special unit of\n\nCOs that was required to respond to critical situations involving inmates at the Facility.\n\nVredevelt notes that when she was removed from the CERT team, she lost a monthly stipend of\n\n$20 to $30 per month. Moreover, Vredevelt claims that the CERT team members were\n\nconsidered the “cream of the crop” within the Facility. Therefore, according to Vredevelt, the\n\nalteration in pay – in addition to the fact that she was removed from a prestigious position –\n\nconstituted an adverse employment action by GEO.\n\n       Even if all of this amounted to an adverse employment action, a point we need not decide,\n\nVredevelt’s gender-discrimination claim on this score comes up short. To the extent she means\n\nto establish indirect evidence of discrimination in connection with this claim, she has not proved\n\none of the elements of a prima facie case – that she was treated differently from a similarly\n\n\n\n                                              -10-\n\fsituated male employee. Not only has she failed to show that the defendant offered anyone else\n\n(male or female) a comparable benefit – the opportunity to maintain a full-time, full-benefits,\n\nforty-hours-per-week schedule – she also has failed to show that a male employee was spared\n\nthe alleged hardship she faced. In other words, she has not identified a single CERT member\n\nwho was allowed to remain in the unit while working at the prison just three days a week.\n\n       To the extent Vredevelt means to show direct evidence of discrimination in connection\n\nwith this claim and in connection with Bosse’s statements about the job, she faces other\n\nshortcomings. For one, she was a member of the team shortly after commencing work with GEO\n\nin 1999 and she has acknowledged that Bosse never had a problem with her working on the\n\nCERT team until after she adopted her three-day-a-week work schedule. For another, the\n\nallegedly discriminatory statement made in connection with her removal from the CERT team\n\ndoes not appear to be “direct evidence” of discrimination, which is to say a statement that\n\nrequires no inference that the challenged action was substantially motivated by discriminatory\n\nanimus. Johnson, 319 F.3d at 865 (“[D]irect evidence of discrimination does not require a\n\nfactfinder to draw any inferences in order to conclude that the challenged employment action\n\nwas motivated at least in part by prejudice against members of the protected group.”) (emphasis\n\nadded); Sniecinski, 666 N.W.2d at 193 (noting that a plaintiff must “present direct proof that the\n\ndiscriminatory animus was causally related to the adverse decision” and that direct evidence\n\nrequires proof that “discriminatory animus was . . . a substantial or motivating factor in the\n\ndecision”). As Vredevelt herself says in her affidavit, “When affiant questioned Deputy Warden\n\nBosse why she was not being renewed for her CCW permit [concealed weapons permit], Bosse\n\n\n\n                                              -11-\n\freplied that if she didn’t like his authority, then she should be home barefoot and pregnant.” J.A.\n\n808. But these statements require us to draw the inference that the controversy surrounding her\n\nCCW permit was motivated by, and was in preparation for, her removal from the CERT team.\n\nProving that there is a distinction between the two, Vredevelt says later in the same affidavit that\n\nBosse denied her permission to work on the CERT team not because her CCW permit had\n\nexpired but because “she was only a part-time employee.” Id.\n\n       For still another reason, GEO has presented evidence – unrebutted by Vredevelt –\n\nshowing that she would have been removed from the team regardless of any impermissible\n\ngender-based motive. See Sniecinski, 666 N.W.2d at 193 (rejecting a direct evidence claim as\n\na matter of law because the plaintiff failed to establish a causal link between the animus and the\n\nadverse decision); Hein v. All-American Plywood Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771112\"><a href=\"/opinion/771112/wayne-hein-v-all-america-plywood-company-incorporated-kurt-adam/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 488-89 (6th Cir. 2000)\n\n(rejecting direct evidence claim that failed to establish both “that the plaintiff’s employer was\n\npredisposed to discriminate [and] . . . that the employer acted on that predisposition”).\n\nWarden Elo testified that it was important for a CERT member to be available five days a week\n\nso that the Facility could maximize the number of CERT members available on each of the three\n\ndaily shifts. And Vredevelt did not present any evidence to rebut GEO’s proof that the dismissal\n\nfrom the team was based on this eminently non-discriminatory reason.\n\n               C.      Failure To Provide A Comparable CERT Facility\n\n       Vredevelt also alleges that she suffered an adverse employment action when GEO\n\n“forced” her to change into her CERT gear in the men’s locker room. Specifically, Vredevelt\n\ncontends that no separate changing facilities were provided to women CERT members. GEO,\n\n\n\n                                               -12-\n\fhowever, presented evidence that there was a women’s restroom near the locker room where the\n\nCERT gear was stored. In addition, GEO noted that there were stalls in the men’s restroom\n\nwhere at least one other female CERT member changed clothes. Thus, as GEO contends, there\n\nwere other options available to Vredevelt but she opted not to take advantage of these\n\nalternatives. In addressing this issue, the district court acknowledged that this situation was not\n\nideal but determined that women CERT members, including Vredevelt, had other options and\n\nwere not “forced to undress in front of the men.” At most, Vredevelt would have been\n\n“inconvenienced” by having to gather her CERT gear, carry it to the women’s restroom, and\n\nchange in a different location from the male members of the CERT team. And as previously\n\nnoted, a mere inconvenience does not constitute a materially adverse employment action. Meyer,\n\n619 N.W.2d at 188.\n\n               D.     Failure To Receive Promotion To Sergeant\n\n       Vredevelt also argues that she suffered an adverse employment action when GEO\n\nselected a male CO for promotion to sergeant instead of her. A failure to promote may constitute\n\nan adverse employment action. Allen v. Mich. Dept. of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760822\"><a href=\"/opinion/760822/78-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1578-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45732-75-empl/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir.\n\n1999) (construing adverse employment action under Title VII). But even if she suffered an\n\nadverse employment action when she was not promoted, Vredevelt’s claim nonetheless fails\n\nunder either an indirect or direct evidence approach.\n\n       In the context of a failure-to-promote claim, a plaintiff seeking to use indirect evidence\n\nmust demonstrate that: “(1) she belongs to a protected class, (2) she suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action, (3) she was qualified for the position, and (4) the job was given to another\n\n\n\n                                               -13-\n\fperson under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.” Hazle v.\n\nFord Motor Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"849201\"><a href=\"/opinion/849201/hazle-v-ford-motor-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 523 (Mich. 2001). Although Vredevelt is able to satisfy the\n\nfirst two elements of this test, she cannot establish the remaining two elements by simply\n\nshowing that she was qualified for the position and yet a male candidate was chosen. See id. at\n\n525. Rather, she must present evidence that the employer’s actions, “if otherwise unexplained,\n\nare more likely than not based on the consideration of impermissible factors.” Id. In short, an\n\ninference of unlawful discrimination does not arise, as a matter of law, merely because an\n\nemployer has chosen between two qualified candidates. Id.\n\n       GEO offered several permissible explanations for promoting DeWolf over Vredevelt.\n\nAmong them were DeWolf’s military background (which it thought was well-suited to the\n\ncorrectional setting), the fact that he had been a CERT team leader, and the fact that he possessed\n\n“natural leadership ability.” In contrast, GEO explained, Vredevelt lacked military experience,\n\nhad only been a CERT team member and “lacked leadership.” In addition, GEO noted that\n\nDeWolf scored higher than Vredevelt on the promotion board exam. According to GEO,\n\nDeWolf in the end was simply more qualified than Vredevelt.\n\n       In response, Vredevelt contends that she was the more qualified candidate for the\n\nsergeant’s position. Specifically, she asserts that she had taken college criminal justice classes,\n\nwhile DeWolf had not, and that she had more seniority than DeWolf. Given GEO’s recitation\n\nof DeWolf’s qualifications, Vredevelt’s allegation that she was more qualified for the position\n\nthan DeWolf is unpersuasive. At best, the comparison in this case is between two qualified\n\nemployees.\n\n\n\n                                               -14-\n\f       Even if Vredevelt’s claims had sufficed to establish a prima facie case, she still could not\n\nprevail. Under the burden-shifting framework used in indirect evidence cases, GEO’s legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons for hiring DeWolf instead of Vredevelt shift the burden once again\n\nto Vredevelt, requiring her to produce evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to conclude\n\nthat GEO’s explanations are a pretext for gender discrimination. The district court, however,\n\ncorrectly concluded that she did not meet this burden. Other than her subjective claim that she\n\nwas more qualified than DeWolf, she has failed to present evidence to support her claim that\n\nGEO’s stated reasons for hiring DeWolf are a pretext. See Hazle, 628 N.W.2d at 521-22; Town,\n\n568 N.W.2d at 72.\n\n       In Texas Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110424\"><a href=\"/opinion/110424/texas-dept-of-community-affairs-v-burdine/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1981), the Supreme Court held\n\nthat, when the objective qualifications of a protected class member are equal to an employee who\n\nwas not a member of the protected class, the employer has the discretion to choose among these\n\nemployees, provided that the decision is not based on unlawful criteria. Even though a court\n\nmay conclude that the employer misjudged the qualifications, that fact in and of itself does not\n\nexpose the employer to liability. Id. at 259. In summary, Vredevelt’s evidence merely raises a\n\nquestion about GEO’s business judgment, but such questions are insufficient to overcome\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n       Vredevelt’s claims are likewise unsuccessful under a direct evidence theory of\n\ndiscrimination. As an initial matter, Vredevelt is less than clear in explaining which statements\n\nshe means to use to establish direct evidence of discrimination. But even if we address each of\n\nthe potential candidates for this theory, none of them presents “credible, direct evidence of\n\n\n\n                                               -15-\n\fwrongful discrimination” with respect to her non-promotion claim. See Hein, 232 F.3d at 488.\n\nFor instance, Bosse’s “barefoot and pregnant” comment is not direct evidence of discrimination\n\nbecause it was neither made by a decisionmaker nor conceivably made in connection with the\n\npromotion decision. Most notably, the comment was made almost a year after DeWolf’s\n\npromotion. See Sniecinski, 666 N.W.2d at 193 (noting that a plaintiff must “present direct proof\n\nthat the discriminatory animus was causally related to the adverse decision”). Nor does\n\nVredevelt’s recollection of a comment by Officer Stuart Morin amount to direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination. Vredevelt refers to this statement in her brief in the following way: “Officer\n\nMorin . . . recalled that a captain who apparently had input on the promotion decision or\n\nscoring stated that . . . .” Br. for App’t at 9 (emphasis added). By its terms, this statement\n\nspeculates about the decision-making capacity of this captain; it does not provide direct, credible\n\nevidence of discriminatory animus by a decisionmaker. Finally, Jill Sable’s statements about\n\nthe manner and tone of questioning in Vredevelt’s interview are, at best, indirect evidence of\n\nanimus. Johnson, 319 F.3d at 865 (“[D]irect evidence of discrimination does not require a\n\nfactfinder to draw any inferences in order to conclude that the challenged employment action\n\nwas motivated at least in part by prejudice against members of the protected group.”).\n\n       That leaves the alleged statement by Bosse, overheard by Lt. McDaniel, repeated to\n\nVredevelt and repeated once more in Vredevelt’s affidavit, to the effect that Bosse would never\n\npromote a woman as long as he was a Deputy Warden. But, critically, this statement was not\n\nmade by a decisionmaker. All agree, including Vredevelt, that Warden Elo made the decision\n\nto hire DeWolf, and no one has argued that Elo had any discriminatory animus either in general\n\n\n\n                                               -16-\n\for with respect to this decision. In suggesting that Bosse ought to be treated as a decisionmaker\n\nwith respect to this decision, Vredevelt has done so in the most fainthearted of ways. In her\n\nopening brief on appeal, she argued (1) that Bosse was a “decisionmaker” with respect to the\n\nCERT team decision, not with respect to the promotion decision, App’t Br. at 20 n. 11 and (2)\n\nthat Bosse at most “influence[d] her non-promotion,” id. at 18, a statement that would apply to\n\nanyone with any input in the decisionmaking process. While she attempts to make the necessary\n\n“decisionmaking” argument in her reply brief, she does so at a time when the point had already\n\nbeen waived and at any rate she does so without citing a single case in support of this less than\n\nself-evident proposition. But even if we were to address the issue in the interest of completeness,\n\nas the dissent does, the cases identified by the dissent do not establish that Bosse was a\n\ndecisionmaker, much less the decisionmaker with respect to this decision. Bosse was one of\n\nthree members of a committee tasked with interviewing the candidates; he did not tabulate the\n\ninterview scores; and although he met with Warden Elo to discuss the scores, Vredevelt offers\n\nno evidence that Warden Elo adopted Bosse’s assessment rather than forming his own\n\nconclusion (or even adopting another interviewer’s assessment). The cited cases all are at least\n\none step removed from this situation. See DiCarlo v.

In short,\n\nVredevelt has not presented evidence to support this claim.\n\n       When Vredevelt took a second job, GEO accommodated her request to work part-time.\n\nHowever, when she realized that she would not receive full benefits, GEO again agreed to allow\n\nher to work forty hours over the course of three days. Certainly, these accommodations were a\n\nsubstantial benefit to Vredevelt and were beyond what GEO was required to do. Moreover,\n\nVredevelt indicated in her resignation letter to the company that she “was grateful and thankful\n\nof the time and effort [GEO] ha[d] given [to her].” She further stated that “there [was] no reason\n\n[she] would not come back to work for WCC in the future.” These concessions are contradictory\n\nto Vredevelt’s claim that working conditions at the Facility were so intolerable that a reasonable\n\nperson would feel compelled to quit.

Specifically, M.C.L. § 37.2103(I) provides that:\n\n       Discrimination because of sex includes sexual harassment. Sexual harassment\n       means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal\n       or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature under the following\n       conditions:\n\n       (i)     Submission to the conduct or communication is made a term or condition\n               either explicitly or implicitly to obtain employment....\n\n       (ii)    Submission to or rejection of the conduct or communication by an\n               individual is used as a factor in decisions affecting the individual's\n               employment....\n\n       (iii)   The conduct or communication has the purpose or effect of substantially\n               interfering with an individual's employment ... or creating an intimidating,\n               hostile, or offensive employment ... environment.\n\n       Sexual harassment under one of the first two subsections is commonly referred to as quid\n\npro quo harassment. Sexual harassment under the third subsection is commonly labeled hostile\n\nwork environment harassment. Chambers, 614 N.W.2d at 915. To establish a claim of hostile\n\nwork environment harassment, an employee must prove the following by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence:\n\n       (1)     the employee belonged to a protected group;\n       (2)     the employee was subjected to communication or conduct on the basis of\n               sex;\n\n\n\n                                               -19-\n\f        (3)      the employee was subjected to unwelcome sexual conduct or\n                 communication;\n        (4)       the unwelcome sexual conduct or communication was intended to or in\n                 fact did substantially interfere with the employee's employment or created\n                 an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and\n        (5)      respondeat superior\n\nElezovic v.

With regard to the\n\nrespondeat superior element3 of a claim of hostile work environment harassment, an employer\n\nmay avoid liability “if it adequately investigated and took prompt and appropriate remedial\n\naction upon notice of the alleged hostile work environment.” Prompt and appropriate remedial\n\naction will permit an employer to avoid liability if the plaintiff accuses either a co-worker or a\n\nsupervisor of sexual harassment. An employer, of course, must have notice of the alleged\n\nharassment before being held liable for not implementing corrective action. Chambers, 614\n\nN.W.2d at 916.\n\n        Thus, an employer may avoid liability for a claim of sexual harassment if it does not have\n\nactual or constructive notice of the alleged harassment.

Ct. App. 2001).\n\n       In this case, the Facility had a sexual harassment policy in place. The policy provided\n\nemployees with two sexual harassment coordinators to which they were directed to report any\n\ncomplaints of harassment. However, the policy further provided that, if an employee does not\n\nfeel comfortable reporting a complaint to the coordinators, the employee should report the\n\nincident to someone within supervision. Vredevelt has conceded that she did not report many\n\nof the alleged instances of sexual harassment. Thus, GEO did not have the opportunity to\n\ninvestigate and take remedial action due to complaints from Vredevelt. Specifically, during her\n\ndeposition Vredevelt admitted that she did not report the following incidents: (1) Deputy Warden\n\nBosse’s comment that she should be home “barefoot and pregnant”; (2) Officer Griffin’s\n\ncomment to her about her “camel toe” when she wore her fatigues; (3) the CERT members’ bets\n\nabout what color underwear she wore and their requests to see her tattoos; and (4) a fellow\n\ncorrections officer’s comments of “let’s go for a quick f - - k” and “give me a b - - w job.”\n\n       Notwithstanding this lack of actual notice, Vredevelt contends that GEO had constructive\n\nknowledge of the hostile environment at the Facility due to other women’s complaints. In\n\naddition, she argues that there was a general pervasiveness of sexual harassment toward females\n\nat the Facility. Specifically, Vredevelt asserts that women were commonly called “pod bitches”\n\nand “control bitches” and that they were never assigned to the good post positions. Thus,\n\n\n\n                                             -21-\n\fVredevelt asserts that GEO was constructively aware of the sexual harassment due to an overall\n\nnegative attitude toward, and poor treatment of, females throughout the Facility. Again,\n\nhowever, the record does not support Vredevelt’s contention.\n\n       Vredevelt admitted that she remained silent about most of the alleged incidents and\n\ncomplained about only two incidents over a three year period. Further, she testified during her\n\ndeposition that much of the alleged conduct was “not so apparent.” Moreover, in her resignation\n\nletter to the company, Vredevelt expressed how much she enjoyed working at the Facility, noting\n\nthat “[t]here [was] no reason [she] would not come back to work for WCC in the future.” Again,\n\nVredevelt failed to put GEO on notice of the alleged sexual harassment. Although she claims\n\nthat the sexual harassment complaints of other female employees were sufficient to put GEO on\n\nconstructive notice of the hostile environment at the Facility, we cannot conclude based on the\n\ntotality of the circumstances that this evidence establishes that the alleged sexual harassment was\n\nsuch that GEO had constructive notice. See e.g., Sheridan, 637 N.W.2d at 545-46; Elezovic, 637\n\nN.W.2d at 783 (complaint of alleged sexual harassment of plaintiff’s co-worker cannot be said\n\nto establish notice with respect to plaintiff’s claim of harassment).\n\n       Because Vredevelt failed to show that she provided actual or constructive notice to GEO\n\nconcerning the existence of a sexually hostile working environment, it cannot be liable for her\n\nhostile environment claim. Chambers, 614 N.W.2d at 916; Radtke, 501 N.W.2d at 168. Thus,\n\nthe district court did not err in granting summary judgment to GEO regarding this claim.\n\n       III.

The district court\n\ndetermined that Vredevelt failed to present evidence demonstrating extreme and outrageous\n\nconduct. To be extreme and outrageous, Michigan courts have stated that the conduct must be\n\nso extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and to be regarded as\n\natrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community. Id. at 908-09. We agree that\n\nVredevelt’s allegations do not state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nBecause Vredevelt cannot establish a prima facie case, the district court properly granted\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -23-\n\f       CLAY, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.

Removal From the CERT Team\n\n       The majority concludes that Vredevelt was removed from the CERT team because of\n\nmodifications in her work schedule. While this is ostensibly a legitimate nondiscriminatory\n\nreason, the majority inappropriately discounts the fact that when Vredevelt questioned Deputy\n\nWarden Bosse about her dismissal, Bosse responded that “if she didn’t like his authority, then\n\nshe should be home barefoot and pregnant.” (Joint Appendix, “J.A.,” at 808.) This type of\n\nsexist comment constitutes direct evidence of gender discrimination because it suggests that\n\nVredevelt’s sex played a role in Warden Bosse’s decision to remove her from the CERT team.\n\nSee Harrison v.

I do not think that the evidence supports Vredevelt’s claim that she was more\n\nqualified than DeWolf for the sergeant’s position, and I agree with the majority’s position that\n\n“[a]t best, the comparison in this case is between two qualified employees.” (Majority Op. at\n\n15.)

It is undisputed that\nCERT team members received a small amount of additional monetary compensation. Perhaps more\nimportantly, however, Defendant’s own arguments support the notion that CERT team membership was\nprestigious and an important element in receiving a promotion. One of the reasons offered by Defendant in\nsupport of the decision to promote DeWolf over Vredevelt was DeWolf’s position as CERT team leader. If\nthis is true, then Vredevelt’s removal from the CERT team, and by extension, the elimination of her ability\nto become a CERT team leader, would materially reduce her chances of receiving a promotion in the future.\nIn this sense, an employee who is not a CERT team member has ‘a less distinguished title’ or position for\npromotion purposes than a CERT team member. Therefore, Vredevelt’s dismissal from the CERT team\narguably constituted an adverse employment action.\n\n                                                    -26-\n\fis a genuine issue for trial.

Officer Stuart Morin testified that he was present when a captain who had been on the\n\nreview board for Vredevelt’s promotion stated that “women don’t belong in the prison and\n\nshouldn’t be in that position, they are not capable of doing it.” (J.A. at 852.) Vredevelt also\n\nswore in an affidavit and testified at her deposition that Lieutenant Kevin McDaniels informed\n\nher that Deputy Warden Bosse specifically told him Vredevelt was not promoted because Bosse\n\n“would not promote any females while he was deputy warden.” Id. at 450, 807. Additionally,\n\nJill Sable, the Personnel Director who participated in Vredevelt’s promotion review, testified that\n\nDeputy Warden Bosse was tougher in his questioning of Vredevelt than of DeWolf and Kevin\n\nCox, another male candidate for the promotion, and further, that the questions Bosse asked\n\nVredevelt were “in a different tone and in a different way” and “were more detailed.” Id. at 846.\n\nFinally, there is the ‘barefoot and pregnant’ comment made by Deputy Warden Bosse in\n\nconnection with Vredevelt’s removal from the CERT team, which suggests that discriminatory\n\nanimus colors Bosse’s employment decisions.\n\n       The majority concludes that Warden Elo made the decision of whom to promote, and\n\ntherefore, Vredevelt’s direct evidence of discriminatory animus by Deputy Warden Bosse and\n\nothers is irrelevant. However, the record reflects that although Warden Elo was technically the\n\nfinal decisionmaker, the manner in which the promotion decision was made left a great deal of\n\ninfluence to individuals other than Elo. Contrary to the majority’s claims, we have previously\n\nheld that “courts must consider as probative evidence any statements made by those individuals\n\n\n\n                                               -27-\n\fwho are in fact meaningfully involved in the decision to terminate [or promote] an employee.”\n\nWells v.

Warden\n\nElo selected a three-member promotion board, which was chaired by Deputy Warden Bosse as\n\nthe Deputy Warden of Security. Each of these board members interviewed and evaluated the\n\ncandidates for promotion, and provided a scored review. The scores were then tabulated by\n\nSable, as Personnel Director, and given to Warden Elo, who reviewed the scores and discussed\n\nthem with Deputy Warden Bosse. There is no evidence that Warden Elo interviewed the\n\ncandidates or otherwise independently interacted with them; to the contrary, the evidence\n\ndemonstrates that the materials that formed the basis for Warden Elo’s decision were provided\n\nand compiled by other individuals, most notably Deputy Warden Bosse. Therefore, the three-\n\nmember board, and Deputy Warden Bosse, while not the ultimate decisionmakers, had a\n\nsignificant amount of influence in deciding which candidate would be promoted, and their\n\ndiscriminatory comments are clearly relevant evidence in assessing Vredevelt’s claim.

Potter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785109\"><a href=\"/opinion/785109/henry-dicarlo-v-john-e-potter-postmaster-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 416-17 (6th Cir. 2004) (holding that derogatory comments by\n\nsupervisor constituted direct evidence of discriminatory animus, because although manager made\n\nultimate decision to terminate the plaintiff, supervisor made recommendation to manager and\n\nwas therefore meaningfully involved in the decision to fire the plaintiff).\n\n\n\n                                              -28-\n\f        Additionally, because Vredevelt has produced direct evidence of discriminatory animus\n\nby individuals involved in the promotion decision, the majority errs in suggesting that the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework is appropriate. See Harrison, 572 N.W.2d at\n\n683; DiCarlo, 358 F.3d at 415. Defendant claims that DeWolf was promoted due to his military\n\nbackground and higher test scores, which could be legitimate reasons for the decision to promote\n\nhim over Vredevelt.5 See Sniecinski, 666 N.W.2d at 193 (citing Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at\n\n244-45) (stating that a mixed motive case is one in which “the adverse employment decision\n\ncould have been based on both legitimate and legally impermissible reasons,” and “a defendant\n\nmay avoid liability by proving that it would have made the same decision even if the\n\nimpermissible consideration had not played a role in the decision.”). Thus, the relevant question\n\nfor this Court is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Vredevelt, there\n\nis a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of whether her sex was a substantial or motivating\n\nfactor in the decision not to promote her. See id. at 192-93. Despite Defendant’s proffered\n\nreasons for promoting DeWolf, given the direct evidence of discriminatory animus by Deputy\n\nWarden Bosse and another member of the promotion review board, a reasonable trier of fact\n\ncould find that discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the decision not to\n\npromote Vredevelt. Therefore, I would reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment\n\nto Defendant on the promotion issue.\n\n                                                      II.\n\n\n\n5\n I question whether the test score issue is significant given that only 1.5 percentage points separated Vredevelt\nand DeWolf’s scores, and both scored highly on the test, i.e., 97% for Vredevelt versus 98.5% for DeWolf.\n\n\n                                                      -29-\n\f       I join the majority in upholding the grant of summary judgment to Defendant on\n\nVredevelt’s hostile work environment and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims, as\n\nwell as her disparate treatment claims involving post assignments, changing facilities, and\n\nconstructive discharge.    However, because Vredevelt has presented direct evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory animus in connection with her removal from the CERT team and her failure to\n\nbe promoted to sergeant, summary judgment is inappropriate on these issues. I therefore\n\nrespectfully dissent from Parts I-B and D of the majority opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -30-\n\f</pre>",
