We substitute the\n\nfollowing revised opinion for our previous opinion issued October 22, 2015.\n\n      On August 6, 2012, a jury found Dale Middleton guilty of first-degree\n\npremeditated murder for the killing of Roberta Christensen, first-degree felony\n\nmurder with a weapon, burglary of an occupied dwelling while armed, and dealing\n\nin stolen property.1 The jury voted 12-0 to impose the death penalty. The trial\n\ncourt followed the jury’s recommendation and sentenced Middleton to death.\n\n\n\n\n      1. The State nolle prossed the third-degree grand theft charge of the\nindictment.\n\fMiddleton now appeals his convictions and sentence of death. We have\n\njurisdiction. See art. V, § 3(b)(1), Fla. Const. For the reasons set forth in this\n\nopinion, we affirm Middleton’s conviction of first-degree murder and uphold his\n\ndeath sentence.\n\n                       I. Statement of the Case and Facts\n\n      Roberta Christensen, as well as her husband of thirty-one years, lived in a\n\ntrailer across the street from Middleton. On July 1, 2009, Mr. Christensen went to\n\nNew Jersey to visit the couple’s son. Before her husband left, they bought mobile\n\nphones that allowed them to use a walkie-talkie mechanism to communicate while\n\nthey were apart.\n\n      Middleton lived in a trailer with Garrett Wade Fowler, Kenneth Wade\n\nSullivan and Sullivan’s girlfriend, Haleigh Zinker. On occasion, Middleton would\n\nvisit the victim at her home and would sometimes borrow money and cigarettes\n\nfrom her. On the morning of July 27, 2009, Middleton went over to the victim’s\n\ntrailer while she was preparing to go to the bank. After he left, she realized that\n\nshe had left approximately $400 in tip money out, and suspected that Middleton\n\nhad seen it. She deposited the money into the bank that afternoon. When the\n\nvictim returned from the bank she noticed that someone had attempted to remove\n\nthe screen from the window by her front door.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f      On the morning of July 28, 2009, Middleton rode around with his\n\ngirlfriend’s roommate, Steve Britnell, for a period of time looking for drugs. The\n\ntwo eventually found methamphetamine around twelve or one o’clock that\n\nafternoon. They returned to Middleton’s trailer and shared the methamphetamine.\n\nAt this time, Garrett Wade Fowler and his girlfriend were also at the trailer. At\n\napproximately 4:30 p.m., Fowler and Britnell decided to go to Walmart to “boost.”\n\nMiddleton declined to go, stating that he had business to take care of, that someone\n\nowed him some money, and that he needed to take a shower.\n\n      While Britnell and Fowler were gone, Middleton took a knife from the sink\n\nof his trailer and went over to the victim’s home. While in the victim’s kitchen, he\n\nasked her for money. When she refused and attempted to push him out of the\n\ntrailer, he attacked her with the knife. Christensen was alive and moving\n\nerratically as she was dragged from the kitchen area to the bedroom. Once in the\n\nbedroom, Middleton cut Christensen’s throat. Before leaving her home, Middleton\n\nstole her flat-screen television and power cord and carried the television across the\n\nstreet to his trailer. There, he washed his hands in the kitchen sink, changed his\n\nclothes, but kept his boots on. He placed the bloody clothes in a bag with the\n\nmurder weapon.\n\n      When Fowler and Britnell returned to Middleton’s trailer, Middleton was\n\nthere with Chris Jenkins, Kenneth Wade Sullivan and Sullivan’s girlfriend. There\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fwas a flat screen television in the kitchen with a blanket covering it. At this time,\n\nMiddleton had already showered and his hair was still wet. He stated that the\n\nperson that owed him money had given him the television as payment.\n\n      After Jenkins and Sullivan left, Fowler was sitting on the porch as Middleton\n\nstood at the door. Fowler noticed that Middleton had a red substance on his boots,\n\nwhich Middleton claimed happened because he got something out of the dumpster.\n\nLater, Britnell and Middleton drove around in Britnell’s black Pontiac to two\n\ndifferent pawn shops trying to sell the victim’s television; both pawn shops were\n\nclosed. They both then got on the phone and began to call around to see if they\n\ncould find someone who wanted to purchase the television.\n\n      At approximately 5:30 p.m., Middleton called Christopher Jenkins to his\n\nhome. Middleton asked Jenkins to bring drugs with him. When Jenkins arrived at\n\nMiddleton’s trailer, Middleton asked Jenkins for assistance in selling the\n\ntelevision. After Jenkins took a photo of the television, he and Middleton went\n\ninto the bedroom where Middleton crushed and consumed two Roxicodone pills,\n\nsaving one pill for later.\n\n      Mrs. Christensen’s husband had last spoken to her on July 28, 2009, around\n\n2:50 p.m. He watched a movie and fell asleep from approximately 4 p.m. to 6:40\n\np.m. When he woke up he was surprised that his wife had not called him; he\n\nrepeatedly attempted to contact his wife on the walkie-talkie phone, to no avail.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fHe also left a message on the home’s voicemail. Mr. Christensen called the\n\ncouple’s other son who lived near the victim’s home and asked him to check on his\n\nmother.\n\n      When the Christensen’s son and his wife arrived at his parents’ home, he\n\nnoticed Mrs. Christensen’s car parked in its usual spot. The trailer door was\n\nunlocked and the son went inside. When the son walked into the kitchen, he saw a\n\nbig puddle of blood on the kitchen floor. Next to the puddle of blood he saw a\n\nyellow broom with a sharp edge. He followed the path of blood to a closed\n\nbedroom door. He opened the door and saw his mother’s dead body on the floor.\n\nHe heard his father on the walkie-talkie calling out for him and his mother. He\n\nwent outside to call the police. He stopped his wife from entering the trailer.\n\nWhile on the phone with the 911 dispatcher, he went back into the trailer to\n\nconfirm that his mother was not breathing.\n\n      Randy Ammons helped Middleton sell the television to his brother, Rolland\n\nAmmons. When Middleton went to Randy Ammons’ house, he said that he had\n\njust taken a shower and did not want the dog to jump on him. A little after 7 p.m.,\n\nMiddleton, in a vehicle driven by Wade Fowler, followed Randy Ammons to\n\nRonnie Ammons’ house to sell the television. Fowler stayed outside by his car\n\nwhile Middleton took the television, covered with a comforter, inside and sold it to\n\nRolland for $200. At some point earlier, while riding around trying to sell the\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\ftelevision, Middleton placed the bag with the bloody clothes and the murder\n\nweapon inside of a dumpster.\n\n      After selling the television, Britnell drove Middleton to a gas station, where\n\nMiddleton purchased cocaine from someone in a truck. They consumed some of\n\nthe drugs while in the car. Soon thereafter, the serpentine belt on the car broke and\n\nBritnell drove to a relative’s house to have it fixed. While the car was being fixed,\n\nMiddleton walked a few hundred yards to a local bar, Brewskis, and called Britnell\n\nto pick him up once the car was fixed. When Middleton got back to the car, he\n\nwas really upset and was crying while he was on the phone with his girlfriend and\n\nsaid, “I’m sorry.” The two drove back to the trailer park where Middleton lived.\n\nWhen they arrived, there were police cars in the area. Not wanting to get too close\n\nto the police officers, the two turned off at someone else’s house, where they got\n\nout of the car and stood in the yard.\n\n      Later that evening, officers found Middleton at the residence of Darrell\n\nDubel. When the officers arrived, Britnell’s car was there. At this time, Middleton\n\nwas barefoot and had placed his boots and socks in Britnell’s trunk. Officer John\n\nRhoden asked Brandon Jenkins, Britnell and Middleton to come to the Sheriff’s\n\nOffice for questioning. Middleton’s boots were later recovered from the trunk and\n\nwere found to have the victim’s blood on them. While in custody, Middleton\n\nconfessed. The bloody clothes and the murder weapon were never discovered.\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f                           A. Middleton’s Confession\n\n      During the trial, the State played Middleton’s interview videos for the jury,\n\nincluding the fifth and final video where Middleton ultimately confessed to the\n\nmurder. Detective Faulkner and Assistant State Attorney Ashley Albright were\n\npresent during Detective Maerki’s questioning of Middleton. The recording of the\n\nfirst interview, which was conducted in Detective Maerki’s office, could not\n\nsubsequently be retrieved. As a precautionary measure, the second and third\n\ninterviews were conducted using the computer equipment located in Detective\n\nFaulkner’s office. Maerki read Middleton his rights, as detailed on a Miranda2\n\ncard. Maerki detected an odor of alcohol on Middleton, and also noticed that his\n\neyes were bloodshot and watery. He was surprised that Middleton did not have\n\nslurred speech and that his coordination was fine. He stated that Middleton\n\nseemed to be fully aware of everything that was happening during the\n\ninterrogation.\n\n      Middleton told Maerki that everything happened so fast that he never\n\nchecked to see if the victim had any money. He stated that he thought that the\n\nvictim ended up in the hallway, and that he did not remember cutting her throat.\n\nHe stated that after the murder, he did not bathe, and only washed his hands. He\n\nadmitted that he acted alone. He told the police the location of the dumpster where\n\n\n      2. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n\n                                        -7-\n\fhe threw the bag with his clothes and the murder weapon. He stated that he kept\n\nhis boots on and put them in the trunk of Steve Britnell’s small black car. He\n\nadmitted to selling the television later that night to Rolland Ammons for $200. He\n\nadditionally admitted that he used the same $200 to purchase more drugs.\n\n                              B. Forensic Testimony\n\n      Crime scene technician Jackie Moore assisted Detective Bradley at the crime\n\nscene. She testified that there was no evidence of a struggle in the living room\n\narea. She recalled that there was a void in the dust on a television stand in the\n\nliving room indicating that there was previously a television and remote there. She\n\ntestified that there were bloodstains on the dining room table and chairs that led\n\ntoward the master bedroom. The bloodstains on the wall of the bedroom indicated\n\nthat at some point the victim had been standing and had stepped in blood. On the\n\nfloor near the wall next to the refrigerator and the dining room table, there was\n\nblood with drag marks and some pooling of blood. The drag marks indicated that\n\nthe victim was alive and moving erratically as she was dragged from the kitchen\n\narea to the bedroom. There was blood with drag marks in the doorway of the\n\nmaster bedroom. There were bloody shoe impressions from the master bedroom to\n\nthe kitchen.\n\n      The victim had a gaping wound in her throat. The medical examiner\n\ntestified that there were several passes like a sawing motion with a sharp\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\finstrument to create the margin of the wound. The blood stains indicated that the\n\nvictim’s carotid artery was not cut until she got into the bedroom. Her hands and\n\nshirt were saturated with blood. She also had blood running down her abdomen\n\nthat soaked into the waistband of her pants. The amount and pattern of blood on\n\nthe victim’s waistband indicated that she may have been sitting up slightly or\n\nhalfway when she received the neck injury. The victim’s shirt was pulled upwards\n\ntoward her neck, which is consistent with being dragged.\n\n      The laceration to the victim’s throat produced significantly more blood than\n\nwas seen in the blood trail through the kitchen. The victim had a bruise on her\n\ncheek that was consistent with the tread and design of Middleton’s boots. The\n\nvictim had bruises and a cut to her face, a puncture and stab wounds on her chest,\n\nneck, ear, and arms. The bloody shoeprints were well defined closer to the\n\nbedroom and became faint as they continued down the hall. The victim’s son’s\n\nshoes were tested and eliminated as the shoes that caused the bloody shoe\n\nimpressions. Moore testified that this indicated that the blood was likely dried by\n\nthe time the victim’s son found her. There were various items located close to the\n\nvictim’s body, which indicated that she was grabbing for things during the\n\nstruggle. The victim had bloody injuries to her arms and wrists. She had defensive\n\nwounds that indicated that she was trying to get away from someone who had a\n\nknife. None of the injuries to the victim’s extremities would have killed or\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fincapacitated her. The autopsy revealed that the neck injury occurred toward the\n\nend of the attack. Following the neck injury, the victim could have been conscious\n\nfor ten to twenty seconds, and alive for minutes after losing consciousness.\n\n      On the kitchen floor of Middleton’s residence, there was a washed-out shoe\n\nimpression that was similar to those found inside the victim’s residence. This print\n\ntested positive for blood, but no DNA profile could be obtained. The medical\n\nexaminer found blood on the sink of the only bathroom in Middleton’s trailer, but\n\nno DNA profile could be obtained. There was blood beside the dresser in\n\nMiddleton’s bedroom, but the DNA profile was determined to be inconclusive. A\n\ndifferent bloodstain in Middleton’s room matched the victim’s DNA on four of\n\nthirteen points. The probability that a randomly selected Caucasian person could\n\nmatch the same DNA profile at these four locations is one in 41,680.\n\n      Donna Lee and Rolland Ammons’ fingerprints were the only prints found on\n\nthe victim’s television. Middleton’s fingerprints were not found inside the victim’s\n\nresidence. There was no evidence that the trailer had been ransacked or that the\n\nvictim’s things had been rifled through. Moore explained that the vanity in the\n\nvictim’s bedroom had blood spatter on the outside, but not the inside, indicating\n\nthat the door to the cabinet of the vanity was closed during the attack. Inside the\n\ncabinet, there was a purse that appeared to have been thrown in there. There was\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 10 -\n\fevidence of blood spatter on the purse and also blood inside of the purse. The\n\npurse was empty, and there were no fingerprints found on the purse.3\n\n                                   C. Penalty Phase\n\n         During the penalty phase, the defense presented testimony from Dr. James\n\nD. Barnard, and the State presented testimony from Dr. Deborah Leporowski.4\n\nThe defense’s court-appointed mitigation investigator, Joe Parish, also testified, as\n\ndid Middleton’s sisters.\n\n                        1. Psychological Witnesses Testimony\n\n         Dr. Barnard assisted the defense in formulating mitigating evidence and\n\nconducted a mental health evaluation of Middleton. His findings indicated that\n\nMiddleton underreported the type of drugs he abused and the frequency of their\n\nuse. Dr. Barnard determined that Middleton began abusing painkillers after being\n\nprescribed the medications following an accidental fall. He also determined that\n\nMiddleton began smoking marijuana between the ages of ten and thirteen. He\n\ndescribed the onset of cocaine use at age twenty-five, ceasing at age thirty.\n\nAdditionally, Middleton told Dr. Barnard that he had used methamphetamine once\n\na year since he was twenty-eight years old. This statement conflicted with his\n\n\n         3. During the guilt phase, the defense rested without presenting a case-in-\nchief.\n\n      4. They testified consistently with their respective testimony provided at the\nhearing on Middleton’s pretrial motion to suppress his confession.\n\n                                          - 11 -\n\fassertion during his police interview that the day of the murder was the first time\n\nhe had ever used methamphetamine. Dr. Barnard testified that Middleton reported\n\nbriefly being medically treated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nDr. Barnard characterized ADHD as symptomatic of difficulty with impulse\n\ncontrol, difficulty regulating behavior to standards or norms, high-rate motor\n\nactivity, and difficulty focusing attention.\n\n      Dr. Barnard also found that Middleton was possibly exaggerating his\n\nsymptoms, which may sometimes be viewed as a cry for help. Dr. Barnard found\n\nit quite significant that Middleton’s personality type is known to have problems\n\nwith repressed anger and hostility and that persons with this condition are\n\nsometimes able to control their anger but sometimes have anger outbursts that are\n\ndifficult or impossible for them to control. Equally significant, opined Dr.\n\nBarnard, is that individuals with this personality type have real problems\n\nresponding to authority and taking direction and often accept little or no\n\nresponsibility for their behavior. Dr. Barnard concluded that Middleton could not\n\nconform his conduct to the requirements of the law on the day in question and that\n\nhis substance abuse on the date of the murder would have likely impaired anyone’s\n\npsychological controls, even someone who had no difficulty with impulse control.\n\n      On cross-examination, Dr. Barnard admitted that he did not review all of the\n\nrecords in this case, i.e., the depositions of people close to Middleton, his arrest\n\n\n                                         - 12 -\n\fand jail records, and his confession to the murder. Dr. Barnard conceded that\n\nMiddleton is not mentally retarded. The State questioned Dr. Barnard about the\n\nreport that was conducted by Dr. Landrum in August 2009 which found\n\nMiddleton’s IQ to be 72. Dr. Barnard testified that Middleton informed him that\n\nhe did not give his best effort on the IQ test conducted by Dr. Landrum. When Dr.\n\nBarnard administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV) test in\n\nSeptember 2011, he determined that Middleton’s full scale IQ was 83. Dr. Barnard\n\ndetermined that Middleton was not malingering during the exam he administered.\n\nHe stated that he was aware that Middleton was administered the WAIS-IV test for\n\na third time in this case by Dr. Riordan in March 2012.\n\n      Dr. Riordan’s March 2012, evaluation indicated that Middleton’s IQ score\n\nwas 75. Dr. Barnard would have expected Middleton’s IQ score to be higher if all\n\nother factors were stable. This lower score could be an indication of various\n\nfactors including Middleton being under the weather or malingering. There were\n\nno indications that Middleton was ever separated from the general population in\n\nprison due to any mental health issues. Dr. Barnard admitted that Middleton slit\n\nhis wrists in a holding cell and did so in an attempt not to be extradited back to a\n\nfacility in Georgia.\n\n      Dr. Deborah Leporowski testified for the State. She stated that in order to\n\nprepare for her testimony, she reviewed the reports, previous testimony, and\n\n\n                                        - 13 -\n\fdepositions of Doctors Barnard and Riordan and the report of Dr. Landrum. She\n\nalso reviewed the police reports in this case, transcripts, witness interviews, letters\n\nthat Middleton wrote while he was in jail, and Department of Corrections records.\n\nShe also interviewed Middleton. Dr. Leporowski maintained that Middleton’s IQ\n\nscores are illogical with an initial score of 72, a score of 83 two years later and\n\nthen months later receiving a score of 75. Dr. Leporowski opined that a score of\n\n83 is likely Middleton’s actual IQ score. Dr. Leporowski diagnosed Middleton\n\nwith antisocial personality disorder, as did Dr. Barnard.\n\n      Dr. Leporowski determined that Middleton was malingering “or at least\n\nexaggerating” when taking his personality tests. Dr. Leporowski found no history\n\nof mental illness in Middleton’s records or in her interview with him. She rejected\n\nany assertion that Middleton’s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct\n\nor to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially\n\nimpaired. She opined that Middleton’s upbringing did not in any way lead him to\n\nbelieve that those actions involving this crime were okay or were warranted in any\n\nway based on the victim’s behavior. She testified that everything he told her about\n\nthe day of the crimes was logical, made sense, and indicated that he was able to\n\nmake decisions and choices. Dr. Leporowski further noted that Middleton\n\nappeared to remember what he did throughout the day, where he did drugs and\n\nwith whom. On cross-examination, she stated that Middleton’s jail records\n\n\n                                         - 14 -\n\findicated that his detox from drugs while in jail was typical and did not evidence\n\ndrug dependence, but that he used them intermittently when he had access to them.\n\n                           2. Family History Testimony\n\n      The trial court appointed Joe Parrish, a licensed private investigator, to assist\n\nthe defense in developing mitigation for the penalty phase. Mr. Parrish determined\n\nthat Middleton’s mother abused drugs and his older siblings acted as parents to\n\nhim. Middleton expressed to Parrish some depression concerning the death of his\n\nfather figure, a former employer, who had died. Mr. Parrish found that Middleton\n\nwas employed at a welding company for a period of time and was described by the\n\nowner as being a hard worker and very dependable. Parrish also found that\n\nmarijuana use at an early age led Middleton to abuse heavier drugs. Mr. Parrish\n\nspoke with Middleton’s eldest daughter, who lived in the same mobile park with\n\nher mother and younger sister. She explained that in the days leading up to the\n\nmurder, she noticed that her father’s physical appearance had changed and that he\n\nwas abusing drugs. Parrish also described a history of domestic violence between\n\nMiddleton and his girlfriend, Sabrina Jones.\n\n      Devenna Pearson, Middleton’s older sister, testified on his behalf. She\n\ndescribed their childhood as physically and emotionally painful. She explained\n\nthat their mother provided for the necessities of life, such as food, clothing, shelter\n\nand basic hygiene through social security benefits that she received following the\n\n\n                                         - 15 -\n\fdeath of her husband. She explained that she and Middleton were never required\n\nto go to school. Pearson additionally explained that she was sexually molested by\n\nher stepfather for approximately three and a half years, and that her mother was\n\naware of the abuse but did not stop it. Her older sister found out and stopped the\n\nabuse by cutting their abusive stepfather. She recalled that she was sent away for a\n\nfew months and Middleton remained in the house with their mother. She described\n\nher brother, as she knew him growing up, as outgoing, fun and someone who\n\nalways tried to make everyone laugh.\n\n      Dewanna Sprowse, Middleton’s eldest sister, also testified on his behalf.\n\nShe explained that their mother would sell her food stamps for beer and drugs.\n\nSprowse recalled that Middleton did not have clean clothes and fitted shoes, and\n\nthat if she was not home to get her siblings up and ready for school then their\n\nmother would just tell them to go outside and play. She explained that one of her\n\nstepfathers was physically abusive to her younger siblings, including Middleton.\n\nShe testified that their mother had always placed men before her children, and that\n\nshe did not spend any money on holidays, birthdays, or books. She recalled\n\nMiddleton being about age twelve or thirteen when he finally quit going to school.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 16 -\n\fShe described Middleton, as she remembered him growing up, as a sweetheart,\n\ntalented, with a good heart.5\n\n          D. Middleton’s Pretrial Motion to Suppress His Confession\n\n      The defense filed a motion to suppress the defendant’s confession, claiming\n\nthat Middleton was too intoxicated to waive his Miranda rights. The motion\n\nadditionally alleged that Middleton did not possess the intellectual ability to\n\ncomprehend his Miranda rights and that Middleton’s final interview was conducted\n\nafter Middleton’s attorney provided the Sheriff’s Office with a form invoking\n\nMiddleton’s constitutional right to remain silent. The hearing on the motion took\n\nplace on April 10, 2012, and June 29, 2012.\n\n                                 1. Lay Witnesses\n\n      At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Christopher Jenkins testified for\n\nthe defense. He testified that he was disabled and was prescribed Roxicodone and\n\nXanax. He testified that since 2007 he would either sell or give Middleton his\n\nprescription medications. On the day of the murder, he went to Middleton’s trailer\n\nto give him some drugs and to look at the television that Middleton wanted to sell.\n\nHe gave Middleton three Roxicodone pills. Middleton snorted two of the pills\n\nwhile Jenkins was there.\n\n\n       5. The trial court held a Spencer hearing on August 24, 2012. See Spencer\nv. State, 615 So. 2d 688 (Fla. 1993). Neither the State nor the defense presented\nany additional evidence.\n\n                                        - 17 -\n\f      The State called Steve Britnell to testify at the suppression hearing. He\n\ntestified consistently with his guilt phase testimony. Britnell recalled he and\n\nMiddleton each taking one Xanax pill on the morning of the murder. He further\n\nrecalled that in the early afternoon, the two shared $20 worth of methamphetamine,\n\nwhich Britnell described as “a little bit.” He indicated that immediately following\n\nthe sale of the television, he drove Middleton to a Circle K to purchase cocaine.\n\nThey each consumed “a line or two” of cocaine in the Circle K parking lot. Later,\n\nCaptain John Rhoden and Lieutenant Brad Stark approached them and asked them\n\nto come to the police station to give a statement. They drove to the station\n\nvoluntarily.\n\n      Captain Rhoden testified that Middleton had no trouble standing or keeping\n\nhis posture, did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, spoke\n\nclearly, and did not appear to have any problems understanding what was being\n\nsaid to him. Lieutenant Stark testified that none of the men appeared to be off-\n\nbalance. Nothing indicated that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol.\n\nOn cross-examination, he stated that it would surprise him to hear that Middleton\n\nhad done crystal meth, cocaine and Xanax during that day.\n\n      Detective Marty Faulkner testified regarding his interviews of Middleton.\n\nThe first interview occurred on July 28, 2009, at 11:56 p.m., in his office, with\n\nanother detective and Assistant State Attorney Ashley Albright present. He read\n\n\n                                        - 18 -\n\fthe Miranda card verbatim to Middleton, who signed, dated and time stamped it.\n\nMiddleton agreed to speak with detectives, but seemed nervous. He stated that\n\nMiddleton appeared to be coherent and not under the influence of any drugs;\n\nMiddleton was responsive to questions and his memory appeared to be fine. The\n\ninterview lasted approximately one hour. Middleton made no admissions during\n\nthis interview.\n\n      Faulkner interviewed Middleton a second time, again in his office, in the\n\nearly morning hours of July 29, 2009. Middleton made no admissions. The third\n\ninterview lasted three minutes, and at that time Middleton claimed that Garrett\n\nWade Fowler had committed the murder. Middleton was placed under arrest at the\n\nend of the third interview. When Faulkner returned to work, at approximately 11\n\na.m., Sergeant Coleman informed him that Middleton wanted to speak with him.\n\nColeman testified and corroborated that Middleton made this request and that he\n\nrelayed the request to Faulkner. This interview lasted for approximately twenty-\n\nthree minutes before Middleton asked to go back to his cell. The officers then\n\nimmediately concluded the interview and returned Middleton to his cell.\n\n      Faulkner further testified that on July 30, he felt obligated to check on\n\nMiddleton, based on Middleton’s state of mind during the interview conducted the\n\nprevious day. When Faulkner arrived, Middleton was in segregation and standing\n\nat the gate of his cell. Middleton asked to speak to him, and Faulkner had\n\n\n                                        - 19 -\n\fMiddleton escorted to his office, where the final interview took place. During this\n\nfinal interview, after repeatedly being advised of his Miranda rights, Middleton\n\nconfessed to murdering Roberta Christensen. On cross-examination, Faulkner\n\nacknowledged that he informed Middleton that he would have to waive his right to\n\ncounsel to speak with him, and it was on the final (approximately seventh) time\n\nthat Faulkner told Middleton what he would have to say in order to waive his\n\nrights, which Middleton had in fact done.\n\n      Assistant Public Defender Stanley Glenn testified that he was initially\n\nappointed to represent Middleton. He stated that on the morning of July 30, 2009,\n\nhe filed an invocation of rights form with the clerk’s office and that afternoon he\n\npersonally delivered it to the Sheriff’s Office front desk, instructing them that it be\n\ngiven to the lead detective investigating Christensen’s death. Glenn first met with\n\nMiddleton the next day and reviewed the form with him. Middleton was very\n\ndepressed at this time. Glenn was concerned that Middleton needed someone to\n\ntalk to and might make incriminating statements. He repeatedly informed\n\nMiddleton not to make any statements without him being present. On cross-\n\nexamination, Glenn acknowledged that unbeknown to him, when he filed the\n\ninvocation of rights form at 11:28 a.m. and delivered it to the Sheriff’s Office that\n\nafternoon on July 30, 2009, the defendant had already confessed at approximately\n\n9:24 a.m. that morning.\n\n\n                                         - 20 -\n\f                          2. Psychological Testimony\n\n       Forensic psychologist Dr. Gregory Landrum testified for the defense at the\n\nsuppression hearing. He testified that he met with Middleton on two occasions in\n\nAugust 2009. He indicated that Middleton was competent to proceed and assist in\n\nhis own defense. He determined that Middleton’s IQ was 72, which is in the\n\nborderline mental retardation range. He additionally determined that Middleton\n\nreads on a fifth-grade level. Dr. Landrum was not asked to do an evaluation\n\nregarding Miranda competency.\n\n       On cross-examination, Dr. Landrum stated emphatically that Middleton is\n\nnot mentally retarded. Dr. Landrum stated that it is possible that Middleton was\n\nfaking when he was examined by Dr. Riordan, who determined that his IQ was 75,\n\nmonths after being examined by Dr. Barnard, who determined that it was 83.\n\nAccording to Dr. Landrum, administering the same tests within a year may result\n\nin a false positive.\n\n       Dr. James Barnard also testified for the defense. He prepared two reports,\n\none of which was a psychological evaluation and the other an examination of\n\nMiddleton’s competency to waive his Miranda rights. He determined that\n\nMiddleton’s full scale IQ was 83. He additionally found that Middleton was not\n\nmalingering. Dr. Barnard indicated that Middleton’s chronic use of drugs resulted\n\nin an increased tolerance for the substances and the need for more of the\n\n\n                                       - 21 -\n\fsubstances to get high. This factor and other factors indicate dependence on a\n\nsubstance as distinguished from abuse. He reported Middleton’s statement that\n\ndrugs make him “go, go, go” and less able to control his impulses and that\n\nMiddleton told him that before he went to jail he had not slept for two nights. Dr.\n\nBarnard opined that Middleton should have been placed in a private detox facility\n\nwhen he was arrested. Dr. Barnard determined that at the time of Middleton’s\n\nconfession, he was likely withdrawing from substances and may have been under\n\nthe effects of substances, at least during the time of his initial interrogation.\n\n      Dr. Barnard administered an instrument entitled “Dr. Thomas Grisso’s\n\nUnderstanding and Appreciating Miranda Rights.” Dr. Barnard testified that\n\nMiddleton’s total score was 13 out of 30, more than two standard deviations below\n\nthe mean. He testified that although Middleton could paraphrase portions of\n\nMiranda, he “showed a very significant weakness in terms of his ability to\n\nintelligently apply knowledge of Miranda, to novel situations.” Dr. Barnard stated\n\nthat it was difficult to reconcile his findings during the testing with what he saw on\n\nthe confession video. He explained that there is no correlation between having had\n\nMiranda warnings administered in the past and actually understanding them. He\n\nalso stated that there are no validity scales for Grisso’s Miranda test.\n\n      On cross-examination, Dr. Barnard stated that Middleton made general\n\nremarks indicating that he may have been malingering during the testing with Dr.\n\n\n                                         - 22 -\n\fLandrum, but he did not specifically mention whether he was referring to the IQ\n\ntest. Dr. Barnard’s testing also indicated that Middleton may have exaggerated\n\nsome of his answers to appear more maladjusted than he actually was on the date\n\nof the testing. Dr. Barnard diagnosed Middleton with antisocial personality\n\ndisorder; he explained that one major feature of this disorder is that the person has\n\na tendency to be untruthful.\n\n      Dr. Barnard further testified that before the Grisso test was administered,\n\nMiddleton stated he had been advised of his rights at least five times. However,\n\nafter the Grisso test, Middleton claimed that he had never been read Miranda\n\nrights, despite his extensive criminal history. After the Grisso test, Middleton told\n\nDr. Barnard that the confession tapes had been altered. Middleton also told the\n\ndoctor that methamphetamines make him think better. Middleton made comments\n\nto Dr. Barnard indicating that the police in Okeechobee violated his rights, which\n\nDr. Barnard opined indicates that he knew what his rights were.\n\n      On redirect, Dr. Barnard stated that the conditions that Middleton was under\n\nat the time of the interrogation, plus the interrogation procedures themselves, made\n\nit more likely that he would acquiesce to the police. He also opined that Middleton\n\ndid not fully comprehend his Miranda rights when he waived them.\n\n      Dr. Michael Riordan testified for the defense. Dr. Riordan was ordered to\n\nconduct a neuropsychological evaluation on Middleton. Dr. Riordan prepared a\n\n\n                                        - 23 -\n\fwritten report, which he subsequently modified or redacted. He modified his\n\noriginal finding that Middleton had brain damage, and in the subsequent report he\n\nindicated that Middleton suffers from a cognitive disorder. He explained that “the\n\ncognitive disorder was the more appropriate term as a neuropsychologist to\n\nreport.” Dr. Riordan reviewed the reports prepared by Dr. Barnard. He agreed\n\nwith Dr. Barnard’s finding that Middleton was incompetent to waive his Miranda\n\nrights at the time of his interrogation, based on his borderline intellectual\n\nfunctioning, his cognitive disorder, and his drug use, which would have caused\n\nwithdrawal at the time of the interrogation. Dr. Riordan also found that Middleton\n\nhad polysubstance dependence disorder. He indicated that Middleton was not\n\nmalingering. Dr. Riordan did not have Middleton perform the Grisso test, but did\n\nnot disagree with Dr. Barnard’s findings.\n\n      Dr. Riordan did not diagnose an antisocial personality disorder. His report\n\nindicated that Middleton had a tendency to exaggerate his problems. Dr. Riordan\n\nhad previously indicated in a February 11, 2012, letter to the defense that\n\nMiddleton was not initially incompetent to waive his Miranda rights, but as the\n\ninterrogation progressed, he became incompetent to proceed. Dr. Riordan wrote a\n\nletter to the defense in April 2012 indicating that Middleton’s drug withdrawal\n\nwould have furthered his incompetence, but Dr. Riordan did not review jail records\n\nto determine whether Middleton was suffering from withdrawal symptoms. And\n\n\n                                         - 24 -\n\fMiddleton did not state that he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms during\n\nthe interrogation. Instead, he told Dr. Riordan that the police harassed him and\n\ntampered with the confession tapes. Dr. Riordan was not aware that Middleton\n\nsigned a Miranda waiver.\n\n      Dr. Deborah Leporowski testified for the State. She testified that she\n\nreviewed Dr. Landrum’s report, along with the deposition reports and in-court\n\ntestimony of Dr. Riordan. She also reviewed Dr. Barnard’s raw data and his\n\ndeposition and was present for his testimony. Additionally, she reviewed\n\nMiddleton’s videotaped confessions, witness statements, drug treatment records,\n\nand Department of Corrections and jail records; she also interviewed Middleton at\n\nthe county jail on May 10, 2012. She did not administer the WAIS test because it\n\nhad already been administered three times. She testified that the discrepancy in the\n\nscores may be due to poor motivation or deliberately underperforming on the test\n\nwith Dr. Riordan. Dr. Leporowski reviewed Dr. Riordan’s testing, his raw data,\n\nand his report and determined that Middleton performed in the average or above-\n\naverage range on most instruments. She opined that “[t]he only areas where he\n\ndemonstrated anything really in an impaired range were instruments that I felt\n\ncould be accounted for by his lack of education.” She observed that his scores\n\nvaried on the memory tests, with delayed recall being in the impaired range and\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 25 -\n\fstated, “Those are essentially the only two areas where there’s anything that’s not\n\nperfectly intact in the overall neuropsychological functioning area.”\n\n          Dr. Leporowski stated that she would not diagnose the defendant with brain\n\ndamage or a cognitive disorder. She stated there was nothing in the testing that\n\nwould indicate that Middleton had trouble comprehending the Miranda warnings.\n\nAdditionally, she said Middleton was candid with her about his drug use on the day\n\nof the murder and even told her that there was another drug that he used that day\n\nthat Britnell did not report. He did not have difficulty reporting the information in\n\na logical order.\n\n          In addition to not administering another WAIS-IV, Dr. Leporowski did not\n\nadminister another Grisso test. She explained that one shortcoming of the exam is\n\nthat it was developed for a certain jurisdiction, in 1980, and the language that the\n\nexam tests for has not been updated, despite the change in the administration of the\n\nwarnings across jurisdictions. Middleton told Dr. Leporowski that he was\n\nthreatened and that the confession tapes had been altered. She concluded that\n\nMiddleton had the capacity to knowingly and intelligently waive his Miranda\n\nrights.\n\n          Dr. Leporowski disagreed with Dr. Riordan’s testimony indicating that\n\nMiddleton was suffering from withdrawal. She opined that withdrawal typically\n\noccurs seventy-two hours after consuming drugs and alcohol. She explained that\n\n\n                                         - 26 -\n\fon his jail medical records, he is described as cool, cooperative, coherent, and not\n\nagitated. Dr. Leporowski spoke with the jail nurse, who indicated that they never\n\nhad to use detox protocols for Middleton and that he did not need any medical\n\nattention at all. She opined that this is indicative of his intermittent, rather than his\n\ncontinuous, use of the substances. Dr. Leporowski found that Middleton was\n\nmalingering during her evaluations of him.\n\n      On cross-examination, Dr. Leporowski acknowledged that Middleton\n\nreported doing methamphetamine before lunch, followed by eighty milligrams of\n\nOxyContin, then Roxicodone that afternoon at his trailer, and Xanax and cocaine\n\nlater that evening. He also indicated that he walked down to Brewskis and\n\nconsumed a couple of beers and three lines of cocaine.\n\n      The trial court denied the defense’s motion to suppress Middleton’s\n\nconfession.\n\n                                  II. ANALYSIS\n\n                            A. Avoid Arrest Aggravator\n\n      Middleton first argues that the trial court erred in finding the avoid arrest\n\naggravator. We agree that the record does not support this aggravator as\n\nMiddleton’s sole or dominant motivation for the murder. This Court has\n\nconsistently held that where the victim is not a law enforcement officer, “the State\n\nmust show that the sole or dominant motive for the murder was the elimination of\n\n\n                                          - 27 -\n\fthe witness” in order to prove this aggravator. Davis v. State, 604 So. 2d 794, 798\n\n(Fla. 1992); see also Green v. State, 583 So. 2d 647 (Fla. 1991); Perry v. State, 522\n\nSo. 2d 817 (Fla. 1988). The trial court’s order on this issue lists eight facts that\n\nsupport this aggravator:\n\n      (1) the defendant personally knew the victim, and went to her home\n      without any type of disguise; (2) the defendant told Garret Wade\n      Fowler that he was going to rob Roberta Christensen, after seeing a\n      large amount of money inside her home the day before; (3) the\n      defendant walked 130 feet to the victim’s home in broad daylight;\n      (4) the defendant knew that the victim was home because he could see\n      her red car from his own home, and the car was parked directly in\n      front of the entrance to her home; (5) the defendant knew that the\n      victim’s husband was out of town and she was home alone; (6) the\n      victim did not pose any physical threat to the defendant; (7) the\n      defendant armed himself with a knife from his residence, before going\n      over to the victim’s home; and (8) the victim was the defendant’s\n      neighbor, who lived almost directly across the street.\n\nIn addition, the trial court indicated that the main object of the criminal endeavor\n\nwas the tip money, not the television. Finally, the trial judge said that if the victim\n\nwas left alive the defendant would have been quickly arrested.\n\n      Notably, only a few of these factors have a direct bearing on or support the\n\navoid arrest aggravator (i.e., the defendant knew the victim and did not wear a\n\ndisguise and the defendant would have been promptly arrested had the victim lived\n\nand identified him). Many of the other factors listed by the trial court for this\n\naggravator either supported Middleton’s statement that he went to the victim’s\n\nhome to borrow money, or that he went there only intending to rob her, before\n\n\n                                         - 28 -\n\fthings became “crazy.” This Court has determined that the eighth factor listed is\n\nnot enough to prove this aggravator. See Foster v. State, 778 So. 2d 906 (Fla.\n\n2000); Consalvo v. State, 697 So. 2d 805 (Fla. 1996). Additionally, the trial\n\ncourt’s determination that Middleton’s primary objective was to obtain the “easily\n\nconcealable tip money,” implies that pecuniary gain was a dominant motive for the\n\nkilling.\n\n       In Davis, Green, and Perry, the defendants raised similar issues involving\n\nthe avoid arrest aggravator. In each of these cases, this Court struck the avoid\n\narrest aggravator even though the defendants were acquainted with the victims. In\n\nDavis, the defendant stabbed an elderly female acquaintance inside her home and\n\nstole some of the victim’s belongings before exiting the residence. Davis, 604 So.\n\n2d at 795. In Green, the defendant and his girlfriend went to the home of their\n\nlandlords, a married couple, and paid them $250, under the threat of an impending\n\neviction. Green, 583 So. 2d at 648. Green went home, changed his shirt, grabbed\n\nthe largest butcher knife from his kitchen and went back to his landlord’s house.\n\nWhen he arrived at the house, his landlord let him into the house, but was adamant\n\nabout keeping Green’s check. Green stabbed the husband and wife. Green\n\nreturned the knife to his home and, later that night, hitched a ride from\n\nHillsborough County to St. Petersburg and then to Ft. Lauderdale. In Perry, the\n\ndefendant killed his neighbor during a robbery attempt. 522 So. 2d at 819. The\n\n\n                                        - 29 -\n\ffact that the victims could have identified the defendants was not enough to\n\ndemonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the sole or dominant motive for the\n\nmurders was witness elimination.\n\n      Although the trial judge correctly stated that the avoid arrest aggravator can\n\nbe supported by circumstantial evidence through inferences from the facts in the\n\nrecord, his reliance on cases such as Jennings v. State, 718 So. 2d 144 (Fla. 1998),\n\nand Riley v. State, 366 So. 2d 19, 22 (Fla. 1978), is not well-founded. In Jennings\n\nwe upheld the finding of this aggravator based on the fact that the defendant knew\n\nthe victim, used gloves, and stated that if he ever committed a robbery he would\n\nnot leave any witnesses. And in Riley, we affirmed the finding of this aggravator\n\nbased on the defendant knowing the victim coupled with the fact that the victim\n\nwas “executed after one of the perpetrators expressed a concern for subsequent\n\nidentification.”\n\n        Although the trial court infers that Middleton killed the victim because he\n\nwould have been arrested quickly if he had left her alive, there are no other facts\n\nthat indicate that this was his sole or dominant reason for killing her, especially in\n\nthe absence of other evidence indicating that Middleton was specifically concerned\n\nabout eliminating the victim as a witness. Therefore, we strike this aggravating\n\ncircumstance.\n\n                                B. CCP Aggravator\n\n\n                                         - 30 -\n\f      Middleton next challenges the trial court’s finding of the cold, calculated\n\nand premeditated aggravator (CCP). On appeal, it is this Court’s task to review the\n\nrecord to ensure that the trial court applied the correct rule of law for each\n\naggravating circumstance, and if so, determine whether there is competent\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record to support the finding. Willacy v. State, 696 So.\n\n2d 695 (Fla. 1997). We agree with Middleton that there was not competent,\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record to support this aggravator.\n\n      In order to establish the CCP aggravator, it is the State’s burden to prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) “the killing was the product of cool and calm\n\nreflection and not an act prompted by emotional frenzy, panic, or a fit of rage\n\n(cold)”; (2) “the defendant had a careful plan or prearranged design to commit\n\nmurder before the fatal incident (calculated)”; (3) “the defendant exhibited\n\nheightened premeditation (premeditated)”; and (4) “the defendant had no pretense\n\nof moral or legal justification.” Franklin v. State, 965 So. 2d 79, 98 (Fla. 2007).\n\n“ ‘CCP involves a much higher degree of premeditation’ than is required to prove\n\nfirst-degree murder.” Deparvine v. State, 995 So. 2d 351, 381-82 (Fla. 2008)\n\n(quoting Foster v. State, 778 So. 2d 906, 921 (Fla. 2000)). “Premeditation can be\n\nestablished by examining the circumstances of the killing and the conduct of the\n\naccused.” Franklin, 965 So. 2d at 98. Further, “the evidence must prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the defendant planned or prearranged to commit murder\n\n\n                                         - 31 -\n\fbefore the crime began.” Thompson v. State, 565 So. 2d 1311, 1318 (Fla. 1990).\n\n“The CCP aggravator can ‘be indicated by circumstances showing such facts as\n\nadvance procurement of a weapon, lack of resistance or provocation, and the\n\nappearance of a killing carried out as a matter of course.’ ” Franklin, 965 So. 2d at\n\n98 (quoting Swafford v. State, 533 So. 2d 270, 277 (Fla. 1988)).\n\n      In this case, the evidence is inconsistent with the murder being a product of\n\ncool and calm reflection. Although Middleton procured a knife prior to entering\n\nthe victim’s residence, there is no evidence that he possessed the weapon for the\n\npurpose of attacking the victim. Rather, Middleton planned to commit a robbery.\n\nIn walking over to the victim’s residence, Middleton did not conceal his identity.\n\nThe evidence suggests that while inside the victim’s residence, the victim refused\n\nMiddleton’s request for money. After a struggle ensued, Middleton fatally stabbed\n\nthe victim. It was during the course of this struggle when Middleton formulated\n\nhis intent to kill her. Middleton’s behavior at the time of the murder can be aptly\n\ndescribed as murder committed in a frenzied rage or during a heated struggle\n\nfollowing the victim’s refusal to give him money. Following this spontaneous\n\nmurder—which was not carried out as a matter of course—the victim’s body\n\nremained in her residence; Middleton left her home with the victim’s property, to\n\nwit, her television.\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 32 -\n\f      Based on this evidence, we conclude that the State did not prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that Middleton had a careful prearranged plan or design to\n\nmurder the victim before he entered the victim’s residence. Thus, we disagree with\n\nthe trial court’s finding that the murder was a planned event, not a sudden,\n\nimpulsive act. Although following the murder Middleton washed his hands in his\n\nkitchen sink, changed his clothes, and placed his bloody clothes in a bag with the\n\nmurder weapon—as noted by the trial court—these actions do not prove that he\n\nplanned the murder beforehand.\n\n       We conclude that the evidence is not indicative of a heightened\n\npremeditated intent to murder. The facts in this case are similar to Castro v. State,\n\n644 So. 2d 987, 991 (Fla. 1994), which did not involve a careful design and\n\nheightened premeditation necessary for CCP when “the record reflect[ed] that\n\nCastro planned to rob Scott.” In addition, we did not find the murder in\n\nHansbrough v. State, 509 So. 2d 1081, 1086 (Fla. 1987), to show the cold and\n\ncalculated premeditation necessary for CCP where there “appear[ed] to be a\n\nrobbery that got out of hand,” resulting in a “frenzied stabbing.” Accordingly, we\n\nconclude that there is no competent, substantial evidence to support the finding of\n\nthe CCP aggravator. Therefore, we strike the finding of this aggravator.\n\n      “When this Court strikes an aggravating factor on appeal, ‘the harmless error\n\ntest is applied to determine whether there is no reasonable possibility that the error\n\n\n                                        - 33 -\n\faffected the sentence.’ ” Williams v. State, 967 So. 2d 735, 765 (Fla. 2007)\n\n(quoting Jennings v. State, 782 So. 2d 853, 863 n.9 (Fla. 2001)); see also Diaz v.\n\nState, 860 So. 2d 960, 968 (Fla. 2003) (“We find this error harmless, however,\n\nafter consideration of the two remaining aggravating circumstances and the five\n\nmitigating circumstances in this case.”). Despite striking the avoid arrest and CCP\n\naggravators, two valid aggravators remain in this unanimous death-\n\nrecommendation case. The two aggravators which remain are that the murder was\n\nespecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel (HAC) and that it was committed during the\n\ncommission of a burglary and for pecuniary gain, which were each given “great\n\nweight” by the trial court. The trial court did not find any statutory mitigation\n\napplicable in this case.\n\n      In its sentencing order, the trial court expressly stated that any of the\n\nconsidered aggravating circumstances found in this case, standing alone, would be\n\nsufficient to outweigh the mitigation in total presented regarding the Christensen\n\nmurder. In Smith v. State, 28 So. 3d 838, 868 (Fla. 2009), this Court held that the\n\ntrial court’s erroneous finding of the CCP aggravator was harmless because the\n\nsentencing order provided that “any one of the aggravators found (except the\n\nfelony probation aggravator) was sufficient to outweigh the mitigating\n\ncircumstances found in this case and due to the other applicable aggravating\n\nfactors.” Therefore, it is clear that the trial court would have imposed a death\n\n\n                                        - 34 -\n\fsentence for Middleton absent the avoid arrest and CCP aggravators. Because we\n\nconclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the erroneous findings of the\n\navoid arrest and CCP aggravators contributed to Middleton’s death sentence, the\n\nerrors were harmless.\n\n                                  C. Proportionality\n\n      Middleton argues that without the avoid arrest and CCP aggravators, his\n\ndeath sentence is disproportionate as compared to cases such as Perry and Davis.\n\nAfter striking the two aggravators in this case, we find that the sentence of death is\n\nstill proportional to similar cases.\n\n      In order to ensure uniformity in death penalty proceedings, this Court\n\nundertakes a comprehensive analysis of the aggravating and mitigating\n\ncircumstances to determine whether the case falls within the category of the most\n\naggravated and least mitigated. See Floyd v. State, 913 So. 2d 564, 578 (Fla.\n\n2005) (quoting Anderson v. State, 841 So. 2d 390, 407-08 (Fla. 2003)). This\n\nanalysis involves a thoughtful and deliberate proportionality review considering\n\nthe totality of circumstances of the case and then comparing it with other capital\n\ncases with similar aggravating and mitigating circumstances. It is not a\n\ncomparison between the number of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\n\nTillman v. State, 591 So. 2d 167, 169 (Fla. 1991) (quoting Porter v. State, 564 So.\n\n2d 1060, 1064 (Fla. 1990)).\n\n\n                                        - 35 -\n\f      In this case, the jury voted twelve to zero in favor of the death penalty. The\n\ntrial court weighed four aggravators against eleven nonstatutory mitigators.6 The\n\naggravators found are: (1) the capital felony was committed while the defendant\n\nwas engaged in the commission of a burglary or an attempt to commit a burglary\n\nand the capital felony was committed for pecuniary gain; (2) the capital felony was\n\ncommitted for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or effecting\n\nescape from custody; (3) the capital felony was HAC; and (4) the capital felony\n\nwas CCP. The court gave all of these aggravators great weight. The eleven\n\nnonstatutory mitigators found are: (a) the defendant has below-average or\n\nborderline intelligence (little weight); (b) the defendant suffers from attention\n\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (little weight); (c) the defendant has a long\n\nhistory of chronic substance abuse (some weight); (d) the defendant had no adult\n\nrole models to guide him as a child (little weight); (e) the defendant’s mother was\n\nnot involved in child-rearing or supervision and was unavailable emotionally for\n\nher children (little weight); (f) the defendant had a steady history of employment\n\nuntil his chronic substance abuse and incarcerations made it difficult to maintain\n\nsuch employment (little weight); (g) the defendant had little, if any, formal\n\neducation (little weight); (h) the defendant has two children (little weight); (i) the\n\n\n       6. The trial court determined that the proposed mitigator that Middleton’s\ncapacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to\nthe requirements of the law was substantially impaired was not proven.\n\n                                         - 36 -\n\fdefendant was subjected to chronic neglect, as well as made aware of sexual abuse\n\nthat was inflicted by his stepfather upon his sister (little weight); (j) the defendant\n\nexpressed remorse for his crime (little weight); and (k) the defendant exhibited\n\nappropriate courtroom behavior (little weight).\n\n      Having stricken two of the aggravators, this Court must analyze the two\n\nappropriately found aggravators of HAC and during the commission of a\n\nburglary/pecuniary gain with the nonstatutory mitigators outlined above. We begin\n\nthis analysis with the trial court’s weighing of both the aggravators and mitigators.\n\nEach of the aggravators was given great weight. We have in a long line of cases\n\nfound the HAC aggravator to be one of the most serious in our limited statutory\n\naggravating circumstances. See, e.g., Larkins v. State, 739 So. 2d 90 (Fla. 1999).\n\nSignificantly, the trial court only gave one of the nonstatutory mitigators “some\n\nweight” and the other eleven were given “little weight.” Additionally, because\n\nsome of the mitigators were similar, the trial court analyzed them together.\n\nNamely, the trial court combined the analysis for the defendant’s proposed\n\nmitigator of low IQ with his diagnoses of ADHD. The trial court also combined\n\nthe analysis for the defendant’s proposed mitigators of no adult role models, his\n\nmother being emotionally unavailable, the defendant being chronically neglected,\n\nand his sister being molested by his stepfather.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 37 -\n\f      The defense argues that this case is similar to Davis v. State, 604 So. 2d 794\n\n(Fla. 1992), and Perry v. State, 522 So. 2d 817 (Fla. 1988). However, both are\n\ndistinguishable from this case. In Davis this Court, after striking two aggravators,\n\ndid not impose a life sentence. Rather we remanded the matter to the trial judge\n\nfor reconsideration of the sentence because we could not determine beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the trial judge would have imposed a death sentence in the\n\nabsence of the two aggravators that were stricken. The trial judge ultimately\n\ndetermined that the remaining aggravating circumstances outweighed the\n\nmitigating circumstances and reimposed a sentence of death. We affirmed. The\n\nfact that Davis ultimately received a life sentence was not based on the elimination\n\nof aggravating circumstances but was the result of postconviction relief for\n\nineffective assistance of counsel regarding racial comments.\n\n      This Court in Perry had to address a situation involving a judge’s override of\n\na jury recommendation of life. In order to uphold the imposition of a death\n\nsentence under those circumstances, we must find that no reasonable person could\n\ndiffer with the sentence of death. See Tedder v. State, 322 So. 2d 908 (Fla. 1975).\n\nWhile Perry also involved the striking of two aggravating circumstances, that\n\nfactor was not the basis for the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment. This\n\nCourt made it clear that there were mitigating circumstances presented to the jury\n\nthat the jury could have considered in reaching its determination of a life sentence.\n\n\n                                        - 38 -\n\fThus, we said the Tedder standard had not been met, and the case was remanded\n\nfor imposition of a life sentence without parole for twenty five years.\n\n      This case is, however, more similar to Geralds v. State, 674 So. 2d 96 (Fla.\n\n1996), where this Court found the defendant’s death sentence to be proportionate\n\nunder circumstances much like the ones presented here. In Geralds the jury\n\nunanimously voted for a death sentence, the same aggravators were proven beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, and the trial court gave minimal weight to the defendant’s\n\nmitigation. Geralds was a carpenter who worked remodeling the victim’s trailer.\n\nKnowing that the victim’s husband was out of town, he attacked her, beating her,\n\nstabbing her in the neck and stealing various items from the home. At his original\n\nsentencing, the trial court found the same four aggravators that were found in this\n\ncase. We struck the CCP and witness elimination aggravators, and remanded for a\n\nnew penalty phase. On appeal from the subsequent sentencing, we again struck the\n\nCCP aggravator, but found there was no reasonable likelihood of a life sentence\n\nunder the circumstance of that case. 674 So. 2d at 104-05.\n\n      In both this case and Geralds, the juries unanimously recommended\n\nsentences of death. Both cases ultimately have the aggravators of heinous,\n\natrocious, and cruel murder during the course of a felony/pecuniary gain, and the\n\naggravators were given great weight. The mitigators in each case were\n\nnonstatutory, with exception of the age mitigator found in Geralds, and in each\n\n\n                                        - 39 -\n\finstance they were given little or very little weight. We conclude here, as we did\n\nin Geralds, that even without the aggravators that were stricken, the trial court\n\nwould have found the aggravating factors substantially outweighed the mitigating\n\nevidence. We, therefore, find that Middleton’s death sentence is proportional.\n\n               D. Order of Penalty Phase Witnesses/Continuance\n\n      Middleton argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his\n\nmotion to continue the penalty phase to allow the family to travel to the trial and\n\npresent mitigation testimony prior to the expert testimony. The defense argues that\n\nthis ruling prohibited the defense from setting the predicate for the expert\n\ntestimony through the lay witness testimony. The decision of whether to grant a\n\nmotion for continuance is in the sound discretion of the trial court. In re Gregory,\n\n313 So. 2d 735, 737 (Fla. 1975). This Court has made clear that it will cautiously\n\nreview the trial court’s decision to deny such a motion and will not reverse the\n\ndecision unless there has been a palpable abuse of this judicial discretion which\n\nclearly and affirmatively appears in the record. Magill v. State, 386 So. 2d 1188,\n\n1188 (Fla. 1980); Cooper v. State, 336 So. 2d 1133, 1138 (Fla. 1976).\n\n      To prevail on his motion for continuance, the defendant was required to\n\nshow: (1) prior due diligence to obtain the witness’s presence; (2) that substantially\n\nfavorable testimony would have been forthcoming; (3) that the witness was\n\navailable and willing to testify; and (4) that the denial of the continuance caused\n\n\n                                        - 40 -\n\fmaterial prejudice. Geralds v. State, 674 So. 2d at 99 (citing United States v.\n\nO’Neill, 767 F.2d 780, 784 (11th Cir. 1985)).\n\n      On the requirement of prior due diligence, the defense admitted that it did\n\nnot use the proper subpoena to ensure that the witnesses traveled from Georgia to\n\nprovide testimony on the date scheduled for their testimony. The trial court gave a\n\nfull day in between the guilt and the penalty phase to allow both sides to resolve\n\nany issues with witness availability. Despite this, the defense witnesses were not\n\navailable to testify. In rejecting the defense’s motion for a continuance, the trial\n\ncourt offered the defense an opportunity to allow its investigator to travel to\n\nGeorgia to pick up the witnesses and bring them to court or, alternatively, to live\n\nstream their testimony from a facility in Georgia. Had the defense done its due\n\ndiligence, the trial court could have been made aware of the possibility that\n\nMiddleton’s relatives could not travel, and these same arrangements could have\n\nbeen made a day prior, without the need for a continuance.\n\n      As to the second, third, and fourth requirements, the denial of the motion did\n\nnot prevent the jury from hearing the testimony of the relatives, and there is no\n\nindication that the defense was materially prejudiced. It only required the jury to\n\nhear this evidence after the expert witness testimony. Additionally, the expert\n\nwitness essentially provided general details about the defendant’s childhood, which\n\nwere corroborated by the relatives’ testimony. Although the defense may have\n\n\n                                        - 41 -\n\fbeen inconvenienced by the denial of the motion because it preferred for the\n\nrelatives to testify before the experts, the denial of the continuance did not prevent\n\nthe jury from hearing the testimony. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying Middleton’s motion for a continuance.\n\n           E. Denial of Defense’s Request for a Mitigation Specialist\n\n      Middleton argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the\n\ndefense funds to appoint a mitigation specialist. The appointment of experts is\n\nwithin the trial court’s discretion. San Martin v. State, 705 So. 2d 1337, 1347 (Fla.\n\n1997). A trial court’s denial of funds to an indigent defendant for appointment of\n\nan expert will not be disturbed unless there has been an abuse of discretion. Id.\n\nFlorida appellate courts use a two-part test to evaluate an alleged abuse of\n\ndiscretion: (1) whether the defendant made a particularized showing of need; and\n\n(2) whether the defendant was prejudiced by the court’s denial of the motion\n\nrequesting the expert assistance. Id. If such a request is denied, and not later\n\nrenewed by the party asserting the need, it is waived. Id.\n\n      On October 28, 2010, the parties attended a hearing where the trial court\n\ngranted the defense’s motions to appoint co-counsel and a fact investigator. In\n\nappointing the investigator, the trial court stated that “in a death penalty case with\n\nissues of mitigation, it’s almost self-evident” why the defense would need an\n\ninvestigator. The very next motion that the trial judge heard in that proceeding was\n\n\n                                         - 42 -\n\fthe defendant’s motion to appoint a mitigation specialist. The State objected to the\n\nmotion, stating that an expert was not needed to do the type of investigations that a\n\nmitigation specialist is expected to do.\n\n      The trial court denied the motion pursuant to Leon Shaffer Golnick Adver.,\n\nInc. v. Cedar, 423 So. 2d 1015 (Fla. 4th DCA 1982), stating that the defense was\n\nasking him to disregard an administrative order from the chief judge of the circuit,\n\nwhich set a maximum hourly rate for specialists on the case, “based on nothing\n\nother than representations of counsel” that the mitigation specialist’s work would\n\nnot be “duplicative of [the investigator just appointed].” The trial court refused to\n\nappoint a mitigation specialist because the defense did not demonstrate a\n\nparticularized need or showing for one. Therefore, the trial court denied the\n\nmotion without prejudice and invited the defense to set a hearing on the motion in\n\nthe future when it could demonstrate a particularized need.\n\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defense’s motion to\n\nappoint a mitigation specialist. The defense did not demonstrate a particularized\n\nneed for the mitigation specialist, in light of its having been granted the\n\nappointment of an experienced investigator. The defense claims that only the\n\nmitigation specialist can explain how his or her responsibilities are different from\n\nthose of a fact investigator. This argument is not persuasive. Although a\n\nmitigation specialist can best explain his or her capabilities and strategy, the\n\n\n                                           - 43 -\n\fattorney requesting the services should at the very least be able to provide the court\n\nwith an explanation of what the mitigation specialist is expected to provide that the\n\nfact investigator may not. Without this explanation, the defense is requesting for\n\nthe court to provide state funds for the defense to conduct what may very well be\n\nthe gathering of information cumulative to that gathered by the court-appointed\n\nfact investigator.\n\n      Middleton’s reliance on Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68 (1985), is misplaced.\n\nIn Ake, the Supreme Court reversed because the state court did not provide the\n\ndefendant expenses for a psychiatric evaluation to assess his sanity at the time of\n\nthe crime. Id. Importantly, in that case, the defendant was initially declared\n\nincompetent to stand trial. Id. Therefore, the Supreme Court determined that the\n\ndefendant was entitled to a psychiatrist once he made a preliminary showing that\n\nhis sanity at the time of the offense was likely to be a significant factor at trial. Id.\n\n       In this case, Middleton was evaluated by four different doctors and was also\n\nappointed a fact investigator. Additionally, during the hearing on Middleton’s\n\nmotion to appoint a mitigation specialist, the defense told the court that it would\n\ncome back a few months before the trial to request the appointment of a mitigation\n\nexpert, and the court invited the defense to do so. The defense never renewed the\n\nmotion. If at any point the defense could specifically demonstrate how a\n\nmitigation specialist was imperative to its case, in addition to the other previously\n\n\n                                          - 44 -\n\fprovided experts, the defense could have set a hearing on the motion that had\n\nalready been filed. Because error has not been demonstrated, we deny relief on\n\nthis claim. Although we find no abuse of discretion in this case, we note that it\n\nmay be appropriate in other cases for a trial court to grant the defense’s request to\n\nappoint a mitigation specialist.\n\n                    F. Individualized Sentencing Requirement\n\n      Middleton raises numerous claims to support his argument that the trial court\n\ndid not perform the individualized sentencing required for death penalty cases. He\n\nfirst claims the trial court improperly and arbitrarily rejected findings of medical\n\nexperts, and cites Nowitzke v. State, 572 So. 2d 1346 (Fla. 1990), for support. In\n\nNowitzke, however, this Court reiterated that it is improper for the prosecution to\n\ndiscredit the insanity defense, as a legal defense, in front of the jury. Id. at 1355.\n\nNo defense of insanity was made in this case, and no argument based on Nowitzke\n\nwas made. Instead the defense argues for a new penalty phase claiming the trial\n\njudge denigrated the field of psychology and rejected the findings of the experts.\n\nThis argument is based on the trial court’s agreement with and citation to the\n\ndissent in United States v. Byers, 740 F.2d 1104 (D.C. Cir. 1984), where the\n\ndissenting judge commented on the imprecision of the science of psychiatry.\n\nDespite this agreement, the trial court evaluated the testimony of all of the experts\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 45 -\n\fwho testified about the defendant’s mental status and determined that Dr.\n\nLeporowski was more credible. Relief on this issue is not warranted.\n\n      Middleton additionally claims that the trial court used a strawman argument\n\nto denigrate the defense’s mitigation. See Consalvo v. State, 697 So. 2d 805, 814-\n\n15 (Fla. 1996) (explaining that a strawman argument is one where the prosecutor\n\ncreates an issue not raised by the defense then proceeds to knock it down). In this\n\ncase, the trial court did not manufacture an argument for the purpose of using the\n\ntestimony regarding Middleton’s psychological state. The defense argued and the\n\ntrial court considered the mitigating factor of substantial impairment. The\n\npsychological data the trial court used to find that Middleton was not impaired was\n\npreviously presented to assess Middleton’s mental state, and the two experts that\n\ntestified during the penalty phase were repeatedly questioned about those reports\n\nand asked to compare their findings to the reports of the nontestifying doctors. The\n\ntrial court considered the entire record of proceedings where Middleton’s\n\npsychological capacity was concerned. This strawman argument has no merit. See\n\nPerez v. State, 919 So. 2d 347, 374 (Fla. 2005) (determining that the trial court was\n\nallowed to use in-court testimony and an expert’s report, which was admitted into\n\nevidence during the Spencer hearing, to conclude that the mitigator of inability to\n\nconform conduct to the requirements of the law was not established).\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 46 -\n\f      Middleton next claims that the trial court improperly rejected mitigating\n\nevidence of impaired capacity. The trial court provided a thorough explanation of\n\nwhy it was rejecting the statutory mitigator that defendant’s ability to conform his\n\nconduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired.7 The trial court\n\ncompared the testimony of Dr. Barnard, who determined that the defendant was\n\nnot “substantially impaired,” to the testimony of Dr. Leporowski, who stated that\n\nshe saw no evidence that the defendant was suffering from a mental disorder and\n\nnoted that the defendant made rational decisions on the night of the murder. After\n\nconsidering the record, the trial court determined that the statutory mitigator did\n\nnot exist. See Walker v. State, 707 So. 2d 300, 318 (Fla. 1997) (contradictory\n\nevidence on mitigating factor supports trial court’s conclusion that factor did not\n\nexist). Relief on this claim is denied.\n\n      Middleton further claims the trial court used the wrong standard in\n\nevaluating his abusive childhood and abused its discretion in assigning weight to\n\nthis mitigation, citing Mines v. State, 390 So. 2d 332 (Fla. 1980), and Campbell v.\n\nState, 571 So. 2d 415 (Fla. 1990), receded from on other grounds by Trease v.\n\n\n\n       7. Middleton also argues the trial court should have evaluated the evidence\nas nonstatutory mitigation. It is clear from the trial court’s discussion that\nconsideration was given to substantial impairment, significant impairment, and\nimpairment, and the court found none had been demonstrated. It should also be\nnoted that the trial court used the mental health and drug use evidence to support\nother nonstatutory mitigation.\n\n\n                                          - 47 -\n\fState, 768 So. 2d 1050 (Fla. 2000), as support. Both Mines and Campbell stand for\n\nthe proposition that once a trial court determines that a defendant is not insane, it\n\nmust still consider the statutory mental mitigating factors. Campbell, 571 So. 2d at\n\n418-19; Mines, 390 So. 2d at 337. The trial court below did not reject the statutory\n\nmental mitigators after finding Middleton to be sane; it rejected them after a\n\nreasoned analysis comparing the findings of the mental health experts who\n\nevaluated him. To the extent that Middleton argues that the trial court erred in\n\nusing the sanity standard to reject the nonstatutory mental mitigation and assigned\n\nit improper weight, this Court addressed this issue in Consalvo. In that case, this\n\nCourt found that where the trial court would have likely accorded a mitigating\n\ncircumstance the same amount of weight had it used a different standard, the\n\ndefendant’s claim should be denied. 697 So. 2d at 818-19. The trial court\n\nincorporated its analysis from the order on Middleton’s motion to suppress his\n\nconfession and additionally referred to Dr. Leporowski’s finding that the defendant\n\nwas thinking rationally on the night of the murder. Therefore, it is not likely that a\n\ndifferent standard of review would have changed the trial court’s ruling on this\n\nissue.\n\n                  G. Admission of Middleton’s Confession Video\n\n         Middleton’s motion to suppress his confession contained three general\n\nallegations: (1) that the defendant’s statements were illegally obtained because the\n\n\n                                         - 48 -\n\fconsumption of drugs and alcohol caused him to become incompetent to proceed\n\nwith the interview process, invalidating his waiver of his rights; (2) that the\n\ndefendant does not have the intellectual ability to adequately comprehend his\n\nMiranda rights in order to knowingly and intelligently waive them; and (3) that the\n\nfinal interview was conducted after the defendant was represented by counsel and\n\nafter his court-appointed counsel filed his Invocation of Constitutional Rights form\n\nwith the clerk on July 30, 2009, at 11:28 a.m. The trial court in the order on the\n\nmotion specifically addressed each allegation, and denied the motion. Middleton\n\nnow claims that the admission of this evidence into his trial was error, based on the\n\nsame claims raised in his pretrial motion.8 We conclude that the motion to\n\nsuppress was properly denied.\n\n      A trial court’s decision to deny a motion to suppress comes to this Court\n\ncloaked with a presumption that its factual findings are correct, but we\n\napply a de novo standard of review to legal issues and mixed questions of law and\n\nfact which ultimately determine constitutional issues. Smithers v. State, 826 So.\n\n2d 916, 924-25 (Fla. 2002). When considering the validity of a confession, this\n\n\n\n       8. Defense counsel raised a standing objection to anything that would\ninvolve the motion to suppress the confession, including but not limited to\ninterviews of the defendant. The jury was provided with an edited transcript that\nhad been approved by both parties to refer to as they watched the interviews.\nJurors were notified that the transcripts were not evidence and would be collected\nonce the video was over.\n\n                                         - 49 -\n\fCourt considers the totality of the circumstances surrounding the defendant’s\n\nconfession. Lukehart v. State, 776 So. 2d 906, 920 (Fla. 2000).\n\n      In Traylor v. State, 596 So. 2d 957 (Fla. 1992), this Court stated that under\n\nthe Florida Constitution,\n\n      if the suspect indicates in any manner that he or she does not want to\n      be interrogated, interrogation must not begin or, if it has already\n      begun, must immediately stop. If the suspect indicates in any manner\n      that he or she wants the help of a lawyer, interrogation must not begin\n      until a lawyer has been appointed and is present or, if it has already\n      begun, must immediately stop until a lawyer is present. Once a\n      suspect has requested the help of a lawyer, no state agent can reinitiate\n      interrogation on any offense throughout the period of custody unless\n      the lawyer is present, although the suspect is free to volunteer a\n      statement to police on his or her own initiative at any time on any\n      subject in the absence of counsel.\n\n            A waiver of a suspect’s constitutional rights must be voluntary,\n      knowing, and intelligent, and, where reasonably practical, prudence\n      suggests it should be in writing. . . . [A]ny statement obtained in\n      contravention of these guidelines violates the Florida Constitution and\n      may not be used by the State.\n\nId. at 966 (footnotes omitted).\n      A defendant who has “expressed his desire to deal with the police only\n\nthrough counsel is not subject to further interrogation until counsel has been made\n\navailable to him, unless the accused has himself initiated further communication,\n\nexchanges, or conversations with the police.” Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477,\n\n484-85 (1981). It does not appear that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\ndenying Middleton’s motion to suppress his confession. The trial court determined\n\n\n\n                                        - 50 -\n\fthat the office where the confession occurred was a standard office, and not an\n\ninterrogation room or any other\n\n      particularly threatening or intimidating venue. The defendant did not\n      appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. His speech was\n      clear and coherent. His answers are fairly responsive to the questions\n      asked. He was capable of articulating thoughts, giving directions and\n      describing events. More importantly, the video tape confirms and\n      corroborates fully the testimony of Captain John Rhoden, Lieutenant\n      Brad Stark, Detective Marty Faulkner and Dr. Deborah Lep[o]rowski.\n      It is more difficult to reconcile the videotape with the testimony of\n      Drs. James B[a]rnard and Michael Riordan.\n\nThese findings are supported by the record.\n\n      The trial court also determined that, based on the testimony of Middleton’s\n\nfriend, Britnell, and the officers who encountered Middleton on the night of the\n\nmurder, he did not appear to be so influenced by drugs and alcohol as to be\n\nincoherent or not understand that he was waiving his right to remain silent. The\n\ntrial court also observed that of the four psychologists who evaluated Middleton,\n\nDr. Leporowski appeared to have been the most thorough; she reviewed all of the\n\nrecords and gave the most reasonable explanation for the discrepancies between\n\nthe doctors on the issue of Middleton’s capacity to knowingly and voluntarily\n\nwaive his right.\n\n      As to the defendant’s claim regarding the invocation of rights form filed by\n\nthe attorney, the trial court observed that it is clear from the record that\n\nMiddleton’s invocation of rights form had not been executed or served on law\n\n\n                                         - 51 -\n\fenforcement prior to the defendant’s last interview. The written invocation of\n\nrights was filed in the court file at 11:28 a.m. on July 30, 2009, and served on the\n\nSheriff’s Office that afternoon after the defendant’s last interview, which was\n\nconducted that morning at approximately 9:24 a.m.\n\n      The trial court’s finding that Middleton initiated contact with Detective\n\nFaulkner is also supported by the record. It is clear from the record that Middleton\n\ninitiated the final interview with Detective Faulkner, understood that he had the\n\nright to remain silent, and voluntarily chose to waive it. At the beginning of the\n\nfourth interview, the defendant was reminded of his Miranda rights. He continued\n\nto blame Wade Fowler; he was arrested minutes later. When Detective Faulkner\n\narrived at the Sheriff’s Office on July 29, 2009, at approximately 11 a.m., he was\n\nnotified that Middleton was requesting to speak to him again. The recording began\n\nat 12:35 p.m. On the recording, Detective Faulkner confirmed that Middleton had\n\nin fact requested to speak to him and that Middleton had not yet been to first\n\nappearance. Detective Faulkner read Middleton his Miranda rights and Middleton\n\nwaived his right to remain silent. After initially asking why a different man was\n\nnot in jail, Middleton began to ramble about clearing his conscience and getting his\n\nlife together. The detectives repeatedly asked him not to waste their time.\n\nMiddleton began to explain the events of the day, including drug use. He\n\nexplained that he and Steve Britnell went to someone’s house and did OxyContin\n\n\n                                        - 52 -\n\fand smoked methamphetamine. He did not remember what time he went to the\n\nvictim’s trailer, only that it was less than twenty minutes after Fowler and Britnell\n\nwent to Walmart. He stated that he knocked on the victim’s door and things just\n\nwent “crazy.” He described the events as “foggy.” When Detective Faulkner\n\nfollowed up with a question about how long Middleton was at the victim’s trailer\n\nbefore the altercation occurred, Middleton stated that he did not want to talk\n\nanymore and requested to go back to his cell. Detective Faulkner immediately\n\nstates, “The time is now 12:58 P.M., concluding the interview with Dale.”\n\n      Faulkner testified that he went over to the jail the next day, July 30, to check\n\non Middleton because he was so distraught the night before. He stated that upon\n\nseeing him at the jail, Middleton requested to speak to him again. Detective\n\nFaulkner immediately had one of the corrections officers escort Middleton to his\n\noffice. The Sheriff’s Office and the jail are connected, with the distance from\n\nFaulkner’s office and the jail being approximately fifty yards. The jury reviewed\n\nthe January 30, 2009, recording of Middleton’s interview, along with a transcript.\n\nThe video begins with Detective Faulkner confirming that it was Middleton who\n\ninitiated the interview. Middleton informs Faulkner during the interview that he\n\nhad been to first appearance that morning and was told not to talk to anyone.\n\nFaulkner told him that they could not speak unless he specifically decided to speak\n\nwithout his attorney being present. Faulkner repeatedly asked Middleton if he was\n\n\n                                        - 53 -\n\fsure that he wanted to talk without his attorney present; Middleton responded that\n\nhe did. Faulkner read Middleton his Miranda rights again. Middleton again\n\nwaived his right to remain silent. Middleton insisted on speaking with Faulkner to\n\nclear his head and get past what happened. Thereafter, Middleton confessed to the\n\nmurder of the victim and the theft of her television.\n\n      When Detective Maerki entered the room, he inquired whether Middleton\n\nhad been to first appearance, to which Middleton replied that he had. He also\n\ninquired whether Middleton had requested to speak to him and Faulkner, to which\n\nMiddleton also replied in the affirmative. Throughout the entire interview,\n\nMiddleton repeatedly offered information, stating that he wanted everything to be\n\nover with because the murder that he committed was out of character; he resisted\n\nthe offer to have counsel present, and he agreed to assist in the investigation.\n\n      It is clear from the record that Middleton initiated contact with Detective\n\nFaulkner, rendering his subsequent interview valid under Edwards v. Arizona.\n\nAdditionally, the requirements of Traylor have been met in this case where the\n\ndetectives immediately stopped the interview at Middleton’s request, and only\n\nresumed their conversation with him on his prompting. The trial court properly\n\ndenied the defendant’s motion to suppress the videotaped confession.\n\n                          H. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 54 -\n\f       Middleton argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal, claiming that the State failed to present sufficient evidence\n\nto support Middleton’s convictions for first-degree premeditated murder and first-\n\ndegree felony murder. After the State rested in the guilt phase, the defense moved\n\nfor a judgment of acquittal, claiming that the State had not proven that the murder\n\nwas premeditated in nature, only that it was committed during a robbery. The\n\nState responded by pointing out that Middleton stabbed the victim thirty-five\n\ntimes. The trial court denied the motion finding the threshold for submission of the\n\ncase to the jury had been surpassed because of the totality of the evidence,\n\nincluding DNA evidence, blood spatter evidence, the number of stab wounds, the\n\nnature of the wounds, and Middleton’s arming of himself prior to going to the\n\nvictim’s trailer.\n\n       The defense also moved for a judgment of acquittal as to the burglary count,\n\nclaiming that Middleton was invited into the trailer and stating that the State did\n\nnot prove that Middleton intended to commit the theft of the television before he\n\nentered the trailer. The State responded that Middleton said the victim told him to\n\nleave and attempted to remove him from the trailer, thus withdrawing any consent\n\nto enter that was initially given. The State also argued that it did not have to prove\n\nintent to commit theft because it could proceed on the theory that the defendant\n\nremained in the home with the intent to commit murder, which he ultimately\n\n\n                                        - 55 -\n\fcommitted. The trial court denied the motion for acquittal on these grounds. The\n\ndefense then notified the court that, based on the court’s decision on the motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal on the burglary charge, the defense had no argument as to the\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal on felony murder, which was predicated on the\n\nburglary. We affirm the denial of the defendant’s motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal.\n\n      The evidence in a capital case is judged to be sufficient when it is both\n\ncompetent and substantial. See Phillips v. State, 39 So. 3d 296, 308 (Fla.), cert.\n\ndenied, 562 U.S. 1010 (2010). This Court has an obligation to independently\n\nreview the record to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to support\n\nMiddleton’s convictions. Id. This Court must “view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the State to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found\n\nthe existence of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Rodgers v.\n\nState, 948 So. 2d 655, 674 (Fla. 2006) (citing Bradley v. State, 787 So. 2d 732, 738\n\n(Fla. 2001)). Further, “[a] general guilty verdict rendered by a jury instructed on\n\nboth first-degree murder alternatives may be upheld on appeal where the evidence\n\nis sufficient to establish either felony murder or premeditation.” Crain v. State,\n\n894 So. 2d 59, 73 (Fla. 2004).\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 56 -\n\f      The jury was instructed on both premeditated and felony murder, and the\n\njury found Middleton guilty on a special verdict form listing both felony murder\n\nand premeditated murder; the jury found him guilty of both.\n\n      “Premeditation is defined as more than a mere intent to kill; it is a\n      fully formed conscious purpose to kill. The purpose may be formed a\n      moment before the act but must exist for a sufficient length of time\n      to permit reflection as to the nature of the act to be committed and\n      the probable result of the act.” Premeditation may be inferred from\n      such facts as “the nature of the weapon used, the presence or absence\n      of adequate provocation, previous difficulties between the parties,\n      the manner in which the homicide was committed, and the nature\n      and manner of the wounds inflicted.”\n\nHall v. State, 107 So. 3d 262, 281 (Fla. 2012) (emphasis added) (footnotes\n\nomitted) (quoting Bradley, 787 So. 2d at 738; Norton v. State, 709 So. 2d 87, 92\n\n(Fla. 1997)), cert. denied 134 S. Ct. 203 (2013).\n\n      Here, sufficient evidence exists to support a conviction for premeditated\n\nfirst-degree murder and first-degree felony murder. The defendant went to his\n\nneighbor’s trailer armed with a knife. When she would not give him money and\n\nattempted to get him out of her trailer, the defendant attacked her with the knife.\n\nThe medical examiner testified that the forensic evidence indicated a struggle\n\nbetween the victim and the defendant that began in the kitchen, and that drag\n\nmarks indicated that the victim was alive and moving erratically as she was\n\ndragged from the kitchen area to the bedroom. The medical examiner also said\n\nthere were several passes of a sharp instrument to create the margin of the wound,\n\n\n\n                                        - 57 -\n\fsuch as a sawing motion. The blood stains indicated that her carotid artery was not\n\ncut until she got into the bedroom. The amount and pattern of blood on the\n\nvictim’s waistband indicates that she may have been sitting up slightly or halfway\n\nwhen she received the neck injury. The victim’s shirt was pulled upwards toward\n\nher neck, which is consistent with being dragged. The victim had a bruise on her\n\ncheek that was consistent with the tread and design of Middleton’s boots. The\n\nvictim had bruises and a cut to her face, a puncture and stab wounds on her chest,\n\nneck, ear, and arms. The victim had defensive wounds that indicated that she was\n\ntrying to get away from someone who had a knife. The autopsy revealed that the\n\nneck injury occurred toward the end of the attack. There was sufficient evidence\n\nthat the defendant committed the homicide with a premeditated design to effect the\n\ndeath of Mrs. Christensen. See Hall, 107 So. 3d at 281.\n\n      There is also sufficient evidence of felony murder. In Bradley v. State, 33\n\nSo. 3d 664 (Fla. 2010), this Court determined that a conviction for felony murder\n\nwill stand where the State can show that, even if the defendant was invited into the\n\nhome by an occupant, the consent was expressly revoked prior to the defendant’s\n\nopportunity to begin the attack on the victim. Id. at 683. In this case, Middleton\n\nexplained that he and Wade Fowler had been discussing the crime for a few days\n\nbecause they were experiencing “hard times.” Middleton asked the victim to loan\n\nhim money, but she said she did not have any money because she paid the bills.\n\n\n                                       - 58 -\n\fHe stated the victim got scared and tried to push him out of her trailer. Middleton\n\npulled out the knife he brought with him, and the attack ensued. Thereafter,\n\nMiddleton took the victim’s television, which he later sold for $200. Under these\n\nfacts, even if the victim invited Middleton into her kitchen, as he claimed, that\n\nconsent was clearly revoked when the victim attempted to get Middleton out of her\n\nhome, and when she struggled with him down the hallway before he ultimately cut\n\nher throat in the bedroom.\n\n                 I. Section 921.141(5)(i), Florida Statutes (2009)\n\n      Middleton claims that the CCP aggravator is unconstitutionally vague and\n\noverbroad, is incapable of a constitutionally narrow construction and has been and\n\nis being applied in an arbitrary and inconsistent manner. He also claims that the\n\nstandard jury instruction administered in this case did not require that the State\n\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt an intent to kill before the crime began, and is\n\ntherefore unconstitutional. We deny relief as this Court has on numerous\n\noccasions upheld the constitutionality of this aggravating factor and the standard\n\njury instruction against similar claims. See, e.g., McWatters v. State, 36 So. 3d\n\n613, 643 (Fla. 2010); Donaldson v. State, 722 So. 2d 177 (Fla. 1998); Hunter v.\n\nState, 660 So. 2d 244 (Fla. 1995).\n\n                                J. Jury Instructions\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 59 -\n\f      Middleton claims that the jury instruction stating that the jury must only\n\nconsider mitigation after it is “reasonably convinced” of its existence is improper.\n\nMore specifically, he claims that it violates separation of powers for the judiciary\n\nto place a limitation on the consideration of mitigation that the legislature has not\n\nspecifically placed in the statute. We deny relief because these specific challenges\n\nhave been raised and rejected by this Court in a number of cases. See Salazar v.\n\nState, 991 So. 2d 364 (Fla. 2008); Johnson v. State, 969 So. 2d 938 (Fla. 2007);\n\nBogle v. State, 655 So. 2d 1103 (Fla. 1995); Walls v. State, 641 So. 2d 381 (Fla.\n\n1994).\n\n                K. Section 921.141 (5)(d), Florida Statutes (2009)\n\n      Middleton argues that the felony murder aggravator is facially\n\nunconstitutional because (1) it does not genuinely narrow the class of persons\n\neligible for the death penalty, and (2) it does not reasonably justify the imposition\n\nof a more severe sentence compared to others found guilty of murder. As support\n\nfor his argument, Middleton cites the decisions of three other state supreme courts\n\nthat have declared this aggravator to be improper, and urges this Court to follow\n\nthose courts, and do the same. We again reject Middleton’s argument on this issue.\n\n      In Mills v. State, 476 So. 2d 172 (Fla. 1985), this Court rejected the\n\nargument that Middleton makes here, stating that “[t]he legislative determination\n\nthat a first-degree murder that occurs in the course of another dangerous felony is\n\n\n                                        - 60 -\n\fan aggravated capital felony is reasonable.” Id. at 178 (citing State v. Dixon, 283\n\nSo. 2d 1, 9 (Fla. 1973)); see also Blanco v. State, 706 So. 2d 7, 11 (Fla. 1997)\n\n(“Eligibility for this aggravating circumstance is not automatic: The list of\n\nenumerated felonies in the provision defining felony murder is larger than the list\n\nof enumerated felonies in the provision defining the aggravating circumstance of\n\ncommission during the course of an enumerated felony. . . . This scheme thus\n\nnarrows the class of death-eligible defendants. We find no error.” (citations\n\nomitted) (footnotes omitted)); see also Blanco v. McNeil, No. 07-61249-CIV, 2010\n\nWL 9098788 at *9 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 7, 2010) (rejecting Blanco’s claim that felony\n\nmurder aggravator was unconstitutional (citing Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 494 U.S.\n\n299 (1990))).\n\n                                L. Hurst v. Florida\n\n      During the pendency of this case, the United States Supreme Court found\n\nFlorida’s death penalty scheme unconstitutional in Hurst v. Florida, 136 S. Ct. 616\n\n(2016). We granted supplemental briefing in which Middleton argued that he is\n\nentitled to a new penalty phase. On remand from the United States Supreme\n\nCourt, we determined that “before a sentence of death may be considered by the\n\ntrial court in Florida, the jury must find the existence of the aggravating factors\n\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt, that the aggravating factors are sufficient to\n\nimpose death, and that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating\n\n\n                                         - 61 -\n\fcircumstances.” Hurst v. State, 202 So. 3d 40, 53 (Fla. 2016). We further held that\n\na unanimous jury recommendation is necessary for the imposition of death and\n\ndetermined that Hurst error is capable of harmless error review. Id. at 68.\n\n      We reject Middleton’s argument that he is entitled to a life sentence under\n\nsection 775.082(2), Florida Statutes (2012). See Hurst, 202 So. 3d at 63-66. Thus,\n\nthe issue before us is whether any Hurst error during Middleton’s penalty phase\n\nproceedings was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. This Court has determined\n\nthat Hurst error is evaluated by the following harmless error standard:\n\n      Where the error concerns sentencing, the error is harmless only if\n      there is no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the\n      sentence. See, e.g., Zack v. State, 753 So. 2d 9, 20 (Fla. 2000).\n      Although the harmless error test applies to both constitutional errors\n      and errors not based on constitutional grounds, “the harmless error\n      test is to be rigorously applied,” [State v.] DiGuilio, 491 So. 2d\n      [1129,] 1137 [Fla. 1986], and the State bears an extremely heavy\n      burden in cases involving constitutional error. Therefore, in the\n      context of a Hurst v. Florida error, the burden is on the State, as the\n      beneficiary of the error, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n      jury’s failure to unanimously find all the facts necessary for\n      imposition of the death penalty did not contribute to Hurst’s death\n      sentence in this case. We reiterate:\n\n             The test is not a sufficiency-of-the-evidence, a correct\n             result, a not clearly wrong, a substantial evidence, a more\n             probable than not, a clear and convincing, or even an\n             overwhelming evidence test. Harmless error is not a\n             device for the appellate court to substitute itself for the\n             trier-of-fact by simply weighing the evidence. The focus\n             is on the effect of the error on the trier-of-fact.\n\n      DiGuilio, 491 So. 2d at 1139. “The question is whether there is a\n      reasonable possibility that the error affected the [sentence].” Id.\n\n                                       - 62 -\n\fId. at 68 (last alteration in original). For the error to be harmless, this Court must\n\ndetermine that a rational jury would have unanimously found that there were\n\nsufficient aggravating factors that outweighed the mitigating circumstances.\n\n      We emphasize the unanimous jury recommendation of death in this case.\n\nThis unanimous recommendation allows us to determine that, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, a rational jury would have unanimously found that sufficient aggravating\n\nfactors outweighed the mitigation. See Davis v. State, 41 Fla. L. Weekly S528,\n\nS539-40 (Fla. Nov. 10, 2016). Jurors in Middleton’s case heard standard jury\n\ninstructions informing them that they were to determine sufficient aggravators\n\nexisted and that aggravation outweighed mitigation before recommending death.\n\nSee Fla. Std. Jury Instr. (Crim.) 7.11. Jurors were presented with mitigation and\n\ninformed that they could consider mitigating circumstances of which they were\n\nreasonably convinced.\n\n      Although the jurors were not informed that they were required to find\n\nunanimously that sufficient aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigation,\n\nthe jury did recommend death unanimously in this case. We conclude that the jury\n\nwould have unanimously made the findings necessary to impose death. See Davis,\n\n41 Fla. L. Weekly at S539-40. The extreme aggravation in this case further\n\nbolsters our determination that any Hurst error is harmless beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt: the trial court found both HAC and during the commission of a burglary\n\n                                         - 63 -\n\faggravators supported by competent, substantial evidence. These are among the\n\nmost serious aggravating factors.\n\n      We find that the State can sustain its burden of showing that any Hurst error\n\nin this case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Although the jury in this\n\ncase was informed that it was not required to recommend death unanimously, it did\n\nso. The unanimous recommendation of death in this case is the sort of\n\nrecommendation we have determined is constitutionally sufficient to impose a\n\nsentence of death. Cf. Davis, 41 Fla. L. Weekly at S539-40. Based on the\n\nforegoing, Middleton is not entitled to a new penalty phase.\n\n                            III. CONCLUSION\n\n      For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm Middleton’s conviction for\n\nfirst-degree murder and his death sentence.\n\n      It is so ordered.\n\nLABARGA, C.J., and PARIENTE, and LEWIS, JJ., concur.\nPARIENTE, J., concurs with an opinion, in which LABARGA, C.J., concurs.\nCANADY and POLSTON, JJ., concur in result.\nQUINCE, J., concurs in part and dissents in part with an opinion.\nLAWSON, J., did not participate.\n\nNOT FINAL UNTIL TIME EXPIRES TO FILE REHEARING MOTION, AND\nIF FILED, DETERMINED.\n\nPARIENTE, J., concurring.\n\n      I join the Court’s opinion, which affirms Middleton’s conviction and death\n\nsentence. I write separately to emphasize the importance of a mitigation specialist\n\n                                       - 64 -\n\fto the defense team’s investigation and presentation in a capital case and to\n\nencourage trial courts to provide defense counsel the assistance of both a\n\nmitigation specialist and a fact investigator upon a proper and timely request.\n\n      In my view, a trial court should not deny a request for a mitigation specialist\n\neither based on the misconception that these specialists are similar to fact\n\ninvestigators or based on undue emphasis on an additional expert “costing too\n\nmuch.” It is also important that prosecutors do not add to that misconception by\n\narguing, as the prosecutor did here, that all “a mitigation expert does is synthesiz[e]\n\nspankings and timeouts and things of that nature,” and “you don’t have to be an\n\nexpert” to “go out and find people who can offer mitigation about . . . bumps [the\n\ndefendant] got on the head or spankings he got in school or whatever the case\n\nmight be.”9\n\n      As for the importance of a mitigation specialist, this Court has emphasized\n\nthat “the obligation to investigate and prepare for the penalty portion of a capital\n\ncase cannot be overstated—this is an integral part of a capital case.” State v.\n\nLewis, 838 So. 2d 1102, 1113 (Fla. 2002). The investigation into mitigation can be\n\n\n\n       9. The prosecutor’s sarcastic comments reflect not only a misunderstanding\nof the effect of early childhood traumas on brain development but also highlight\nthe tendency of some prosecutors to degrade mitigation. Cf. Oyola v. State, 158\nSo. 3d 504, 512-13 (Fla. 2015) (rebuking prosecutorial arguments that\ncharacterize a defendant’s mitigating evidence as “excuses,” “make-believe,”\n“flimsy,” or “phantom”).\n\n\n                                        - 65 -\n\fa monumental undertaking, requiring a significant amount of time that would\n\nideally begin as soon as possible. See American Bar Association (ABA)\n\nGuidelines for the Appointment & Performance of Defense Counsel in Death\n\nPenalty Cases (ABA Guidelines), Commentary to Guideline 1.1, reprinted in 31\n\nHofstra L. Rev. 913, 925 (2003). The difference between a thorough assessment of\n\nmitigation and a cursory one could, quite literally, be a matter of life and death.\n\nWhen funding is properly requested, the defense team should receive the assistance\n\nof both a fact investigator and a mitigation specialist to ensure a complete and\n\nreliable mitigation investigation.\n\n      There is an “apparent widespread use of mitigation specialists or\n\ncoordinators” in Florida, as the First District Court of Appeal has explained when\n\nquashing a trial court order denying a defendant’s motion for additional mitigation\n\ncoordinator fees. Criminal Specialist Investigations, Inc. v. State, 58 So. 3d 883,\n\n886 (Fla. 1st DCA 2011).10 Cases in this Court demonstrate that the use of a\n\nmitigation specialist in capital cases is not unusual in Florida. See, e.g., Turner v.\n\nState, 37 So. 3d 212, 219 (Fla. 2010) (noting that a mitigation specialist testified in\n\na capital case); Twilegar v. State, 42 So. 3d 177, 203 (Fla. 2010) (noting that the\n\n\n\n       10. The issue was before the First District, rather than this Court, because a\nlife sentence was imposed following the penalty phase, and the mitigation\nspecialist was requesting additional compensation for her work in having\nsuccessfully developed mitigation.\n\n\n                                         - 66 -\n\fdefense counsel had enlisted the assistance of a mitigation specialist in a capital\n\ncase); Deparvine v. State, 995 So. 2d 351, 360 (Fla. 2008) (noting that a mitigation\n\nspecialist testified in the penalty phase of a capital case).11\n\n      The ABA has published guidelines to “set forth a national standard of\n\npractice for the defense of capital cases in order to ensure high quality legal\n\nrepresentation” for defendants facing a possible death penalty. ABA Guidelines,\n\n31 Hofstra L. Rev. at 919. At the hearing on the motion to appoint a mitigation\n\nspecialist in this case, the defense counsel urged the trial court to consider the ABA\n\nGuidelines, by explaining that these Guidelines “include[] a suggestion, if not a\n\nmandatory requirement, that a mitigation specialist . . . should be appointed in\n\ndeath cases because of the nature of the crime and because of the serious nature of\n\nthe potential penalty.” The prosecutor’s misguided response was, “I could care\n\nless about what they [the ABA] think about the death penalty and how it operates\n\nin the State of Florida.”\n\n      Contrary to the opinion of the prosecutor in this case, the ABA Guidelines\n\ndo have relevance to capital cases, even if these guidelines are not binding in\n\n\n\n       11. Since at least 2011, mitigation specialists have been recognized as a part\nof capital cases, when the General Appropriations Act of 2011 set the maximum\nhourly rate for mitigation specialists at $75. See ch. 2011-69, § 4, at 126, Laws of\nFla; see also § 27.425, Fla. Stat. (indicating that the rate specified annually in the\nGeneral Appropriations Act is the maximum compensation rate in cases in which\nthe court has appointed private counsel or declared a person indigent for costs).\n\n\n                                          - 67 -\n\fdetermining whether counsel rendered ineffective assistance. The United States\n\nSupreme Court has referred to the various renditions of these guidelines as “guides\n\nto determining what is reasonable” for an attorney’s performance, or as reflecting\n\n“well-defined norms” for attorney conduct. Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 387\n\n& n.7 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 524 (2003). This Court has also\n\nrelied upon these guidelines in determining whether trial counsel has adequately\n\ninvestigated mitigation evidence. See, e.g., Parker v. State, 3 So. 3d 974, 984-85\n\n(Fla. 2009) (citing the ABA Guidelines in a postconviction appeal to determine\n\nthat trial counsel’s performance as to investigating and presenting mitigation\n\nevidence was deficient); Blackwood v. State, 946 So. 2d 960, 974 (Fla. 2006)\n\n(citing the Supreme Court’s reliance on the ABA Guidelines in Wiggins in\n\ndetermining that trial counsel unreasonably failed to attempt to present mental\n\nhealth mitigation evidence, and concluding that there was competent, substantial\n\nevidence to support the trial court’s finding of deficient performance).\n\n      A mitigation specialist is “an indispensable member of the defense team\n\nthroughout all capital proceedings[,] . . . possess[ing] clinical and information-\n\ngathering skills and training that most lawyers simply do not have.” ABA\n\nGuidelines, Commentary to Guideline 4.1, 31 Hofstra L. Rev. at 959. Not only do\n\nmitigation specialists have honed skills in gathering and understanding the nature\n\nof potential mitigation evidence, such as the significance of early childhood\n\n\n                                        - 68 -\n\ftrauma, but mitigation specialists—unlike the defendant’s lawyer—can testify in\n\nthe penalty phase to impart the results of their mitigation investigation to the jury\n\nthat must weigh the mitigation and aggravation in determining whether to\n\nrecommend the death sentence.\n\n      As opposed to fact investigators, mitigation specialists “are generally trained\n\nin the social sciences, with college degrees in social work or psychology,” and “are\n\nadept at gathering institutional records, interviewing lay and professional people,\n\nand compiling case histories.” Hon. Helen G. Berrigan, The Indispensable Role of\n\nthe Mitigation Specialist in a Capital Case: A View From the Federal Bench, 36\n\nHofstra L. Rev. 819, 827-28 (2008). “Significantly, they are trained in uncovering\n\nfamily trauma and screening for often subtle mental and psychological disorders,”\n\nand are “experienced in interpersonal communication so they know how to develop\n\ntrust and rapport with even the most difficult or distrustful of individuals.” Id. at\n\n828 (footnote omitted). Part of the mitigation specialist’s job is to “conduct a\n\ncomprehensive life history investigation of the client and identify all relevant\n\nmitigation issues.” Richard G. Dudley Jr. & Pamela Blume Leonard, Getting It\n\nRight: Life History Investigation as the Foundation for a Reliable Mental Health\n\nAssessment, 36 Hofstra L. Rev. 963, 966 (2008) (footnote omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 69 -\n\f      A mitigation specialist has the potential to benefit a criminal defendant in a\n\ncapital case in a wide variety of ways, as summarized by the commentary to\n\nGuideline 4.1 of the ABA Guidelines:\n\n      They have the time and the ability to elicit sensitive, embarrassing and\n      often humiliating evidence (e.g., family sexual abuse) that the\n      defendant may have never disclosed. They have the clinical skills to\n      recognize such things as congenital, mental or neurological\n      conditions, to understand how these conditions may have affected the\n      defendant’s development and behavior, and to identify the most\n      appropriate experts to examine the defendant or testify on his behalf.\n      Moreover, they may be critical to assuring that the client obtains\n      therapeutic services that render him cognitively and emotionally\n      competent to make sound decisions concerning his case.\n      . . . The mitigation specialist compiles a comprehensive and well-\n      documented psycho-social history of the client based on an exhaustive\n      investigation; analyzes the significance of the information in terms of\n      impact on development, including effect on personality and behavior;\n      finds mitigating themes in the client’s life history; identifies the need\n      for expert assistance; assists in locating appropriate experts; provides\n      social history information to experts to enable them to conduct\n      competent and reliable evaluations; and works with the defense team\n      and experts to develop a comprehensive and cohesive case in\n      mitigation.\n             The mitigation specialist often plays an important role as well\n      in maintaining close contact with the client and his family while the\n      case is pending. The rapport developed in this process can be the key\n      to persuading a client to accept a plea to a sentence less than death.\n\nABA Guidelines, Commentary to Guideline 4.1, 31 Hofstra L. Rev. at 959-60\n\n(footnotes omitted); see also ABA Supplementary Guidelines for the Mitigation\n\nFunction of Defense Teams in Death Penalty Cases (2008), reprinted in 36 Hofstra\n\nL. Rev. 677, 682 (2008) (explaining that mitigation specialists are skilled\n\ninterviewers who can identify and locate relevant persons, recognize and elicit\n\n                                        - 70 -\n\finformation related to mental health, establish a rapport with witnesses, and\n\n“advise counsel on the appropriate mental health and other expert assistance”).\n\n      The importance of appointing a mitigation specialist becomes all the more\n\nevident in a case involving an indigent defendant, where the trial court appoints\n\nprivate counsel, who generally does not have the same institutional resources as the\n\nPublic Defender’s Office. In such cases, the trial judge effectively decides “what\n\nfinancial assistance, investigators, or experts the defense will be allowed.”\n\nBerrigan, 36 Hofstra L. Rev. at 823. “By controlling the purse strings, the trial\n\njudge effectively controls the quantity and quality of information that will flow to\n\nthe jury if a penalty phase is necessary.” Id. As the Eleventh Circuit Court of\n\nAppeals has stated, “[p]ermitting an indigent capital defendant to introduce\n\nmitigating evidence has little meaning if the funds necessary for compiling the\n\nevidence [are] unavailable.” Westbrook v. Zant, 704 F.2d 1487, 1496 (11th Cir.\n\n1983), overruled on other grounds by Peek v. Kemp, 784 F.2d 1479, 1494 (11th\n\nCir. 1986).\n\n      Accordingly, given the importance of a mitigation specialist to the defense’s\n\npresentation in a capital case, I strongly encourage trial courts to liberally grant\n\nproper requests for mitigation specialists. Nevertheless, I would not find reversible\n\nerror in this case because the defense lawyer expressly stated that he would renew\n\nhis request for a mitigation specialist, but he did not do so. Further, in this direct\n\n\n                                         - 71 -\n\fappeal, Middleton is unable to show how he was prejudiced. I therefore concur in\n\nthe affirmance of the conviction and death sentence.\n\nLABARGA, C.J., concurs.\n\nQUINCE, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n      I concur with the majority’s findings that the evidence here is sufficient to\n\nsustain Middleton’s convictions. I disagree with the majority’s finding that the\n\nHurst error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt for the same reasons set forth\n\nin Justice Perry’s partial concurrence in Davis v. State, 41 Fla. L. Weekly S528,\n\nS540-41 (Fla. Nov. 10, 2016) (Perry, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\nThe jury’s unanimous recommendation of death in this case does not enable this\n\nCourt to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the jurors would have made all\n\nthe findings necessary for the imposition of death unanimously. Just as this Court\n\ndeclined to speculate as to how the jurors would have voted in Hurst v. State, 202\n\nSo. 3d 40, 69 (Fla. 2016), so too should we decline to speculate in this case.

We substitute the\n\nfollowing revised opinion for our previous opinion issued October 22, 2015.\n\n      On August 6, 2012, a jury found Dale Middleton guilty of first-degree\n\npremeditated murder for the killing of Roberta Christensen, first-degree felony\n\nmurder with a weapon, burglary of an occupied dwelling while armed, and dealing\n\nin stolen property.1 The jury voted 12-0 to impose the death penalty. The trial\n\ncourt followed the jury’s recommendation and sentenced Middleton to death.\n\n\n\n\n      1. The State nolle prossed the third-degree grand theft charge of the\nindictment.\n\fMiddleton now appeals his convictions and sentence of death. We have\n\njurisdiction. See art. V, § 3(b)(1), Fla. Const. For the reasons set forth in this\n\nopinion, we affirm Middleton’s conviction of first-degree murder and uphold his\n\ndeath sentence.\n\n                       I. Statement of the Case and Facts\n\n      Roberta Christensen, as well as her husband of thirty-one years, lived in a\n\ntrailer across the street from Middleton. On July 1, 2009, Mr. Christensen went to\n\nNew Jersey to visit the couple’s son. Before her husband left, they bought mobile\n\nphones that allowed them to use a walkie-talkie mechanism to communicate while\n\nthey were apart.\n\n      Middleton lived in a trailer with Garrett Wade Fowler, Kenneth Wade\n\nSullivan and Sullivan’s girlfriend, Haleigh Zinker. On occasion, Middleton would\n\nvisit the victim at her home and would sometimes borrow money and cigarettes\n\nfrom her. On the morning of July 27, 2009, Middleton went over to the victim’s\n\ntrailer while she was preparing to go to the bank. After he left, she realized that\n\nshe had left approximately $400 in tip money out, and suspected that Middleton\n\nhad seen it. She deposited the money into the bank that afternoon. When the\n\nvictim returned from the bank she noticed that someone had attempted to remove\n\nthe screen from the window by her front door.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f      On the morning of July 28, 2009, Middleton rode around with his\n\ngirlfriend’s roommate, Steve Britnell, for a period of time looking for drugs. The\n\ntwo eventually found methamphetamine around twelve or one o’clock that\n\nafternoon. They returned to Middleton’s trailer and shared the methamphetamine.\n\nAt this time, Garrett Wade Fowler and his girlfriend were also at the trailer. At\n\napproximately 4:30 p.m., Fowler and Britnell decided to go to Walmart to “boost.”\n\nMiddleton declined to go, stating that he had business to take care of, that someone\n\nowed him some money, and that he needed to take a shower.\n\n      While Britnell and Fowler were gone, Middleton took a knife from the sink\n\nof his trailer and went over to the victim’s home. While in the victim’s kitchen, he\n\nasked her for money. When she refused and attempted to push him out of the\n\ntrailer, he attacked her with the knife. Christensen was alive and moving\n\nerratically as she was dragged from the kitchen area to the bedroom. Once in the\n\nbedroom, Middleton cut Christensen’s throat. Before leaving her home, Middleton\n\nstole her flat-screen television and power cord and carried the television across the\n\nstreet to his trailer. There, he washed his hands in the kitchen sink, changed his\n\nclothes, but kept his boots on. He placed the bloody clothes in a bag with the\n\nmurder weapon.\n\n      When Fowler and Britnell returned to Middleton’s trailer, Middleton was\n\nthere with Chris Jenkins, Kenneth Wade Sullivan and Sullivan’s girlfriend. There\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fwas a flat screen television in the kitchen with a blanket covering it. At this time,\n\nMiddleton had already showered and his hair was still wet. He stated that the\n\nperson that owed him money had given him the television as payment.\n\n      After Jenkins and Sullivan left, Fowler was sitting on the porch as Middleton\n\nstood at the door. Fowler noticed that Middleton had a red substance on his boots,\n\nwhich Middleton claimed happened because he got something out of the dumpster.\n\nLater, Britnell and Middleton drove around in Britnell’s black Pontiac to two\n\ndifferent pawn shops trying to sell the victim’s television; both pawn shops were\n\nclosed. They both then got on the phone and began to call around to see if they\n\ncould find someone who wanted to purchase the television.\n\n      At approximately 5:30 p.m., Middleton called Christopher Jenkins to his\n\nhome. Middleton asked Jenkins to bring drugs with him. When Jenkins arrived at\n\nMiddleton’s trailer, Middleton asked Jenkins for assistance in selling the\n\ntelevision. After Jenkins took a photo of the television, he and Middleton went\n\ninto the bedroom where Middleton crushed and consumed two Roxicodone pills,\n\nsaving one pill for later.\n\n      Mrs. Christensen’s husband had last spoken to her on July 28, 2009, around\n\n2:50 p.m. He watched a movie and fell asleep from approximately 4 p.m. to 6:40\n\np.m. When he woke up he was surprised that his wife had not called him; he\n\nrepeatedly attempted to contact his wife on the walkie-talkie phone, to no avail.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fHe also left a message on the home’s voicemail. Mr. Christensen called the\n\ncouple’s other son who lived near the victim’s home and asked him to check on his\n\nmother.\n\n      When the Christensen’s son and his wife arrived at his parents’ home, he\n\nnoticed Mrs. Christensen’s car parked in its usual spot. The trailer door was\n\nunlocked and the son went inside. When the son walked into the kitchen, he saw a\n\nbig puddle of blood on the kitchen floor. Next to the puddle of blood he saw a\n\nyellow broom with a sharp edge. He followed the path of blood to a closed\n\nbedroom door. He opened the door and saw his mother’s dead body on the floor.\n\nHe heard his father on the walkie-talkie calling out for him and his mother. He\n\nwent outside to call the police. He stopped his wife from entering the trailer.\n\nWhile on the phone with the 911 dispatcher, he went back into the trailer to\n\nconfirm that his mother was not breathing.\n\n      Randy Ammons helped Middleton sell the television to his brother, Rolland\n\nAmmons. When Middleton went to Randy Ammons’ house, he said that he had\n\njust taken a shower and did not want the dog to jump on him. A little after 7 p.m.,\n\nMiddleton, in a vehicle driven by Wade Fowler, followed Randy Ammons to\n\nRonnie Ammons’ house to sell the television. Fowler stayed outside by his car\n\nwhile Middleton took the television, covered with a comforter, inside and sold it to\n\nRolland for $200. At some point earlier, while riding around trying to sell the\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\ftelevision, Middleton placed the bag with the bloody clothes and the murder\n\nweapon inside of a dumpster.\n\n      After selling the television, Britnell drove Middleton to a gas station, where\n\nMiddleton purchased cocaine from someone in a truck. They consumed some of\n\nthe drugs while in the car. Soon thereafter, the serpentine belt on the car broke and\n\nBritnell drove to a relative’s house to have it fixed. While the car was being fixed,\n\nMiddleton walked a few hundred yards to a local bar, Brewskis, and called Britnell\n\nto pick him up once the car was fixed. When Middleton got back to the car, he\n\nwas really upset and was crying while he was on the phone with his girlfriend and\n\nsaid, “I’m sorry.” The two drove back to the trailer park where Middleton lived.\n\nWhen they arrived, there were police cars in the area. Not wanting to get too close\n\nto the police officers, the two turned off at someone else’s house, where they got\n\nout of the car and stood in the yard.\n\n      Later that evening, officers found Middleton at the residence of Darrell\n\nDubel. When the officers arrived, Britnell’s car was there. At this time, Middleton\n\nwas barefoot and had placed his boots and socks in Britnell’s trunk. Officer John\n\nRhoden asked Brandon Jenkins, Britnell and Middleton to come to the Sheriff’s\n\nOffice for questioning. Middleton’s boots were later recovered from the trunk and\n\nwere found to have the victim’s blood on them. While in custody, Middleton\n\nconfessed. The bloody clothes and the murder weapon were never discovered.\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f                           A. Middleton’s Confession\n\n      During the trial, the State played Middleton’s interview videos for the jury,\n\nincluding the fifth and final video where Middleton ultimately confessed to the\n\nmurder. Detective Faulkner and Assistant State Attorney Ashley Albright were\n\npresent during Detective Maerki’s questioning of Middleton. The recording of the\n\nfirst interview, which was conducted in Detective Maerki’s office, could not\n\nsubsequently be retrieved. As a precautionary measure, the second and third\n\ninterviews were conducted using the computer equipment located in Detective\n\nFaulkner’s office. Maerki read Middleton his rights, as detailed on a Miranda2\n\ncard. Maerki detected an odor of alcohol on Middleton, and also noticed that his\n\neyes were bloodshot and watery. He was surprised that Middleton did not have\n\nslurred speech and that his coordination was fine. He stated that Middleton\n\nseemed to be fully aware of everything that was happening during the\n\ninterrogation.\n\n      Middleton told Maerki that everything happened so fast that he never\n\nchecked to see if the victim had any money. He stated that he thought that the\n\nvictim ended up in the hallway, and that he did not remember cutting her throat.\n\nHe stated that after the murder, he did not bathe, and only washed his hands. He\n\nadmitted that he acted alone. He told the police the location of the dumpster where\n\n\n      2. Miranda v.

He stated that he kept\n\nhis boots on and put them in the trunk of Steve Britnell’s small black car. He\n\nadmitted to selling the television later that night to Rolland Ammons for $200. He\n\nadditionally admitted that he used the same $200 to purchase more drugs.\n\n                              B. Forensic Testimony\n\n      Crime scene technician Jackie Moore assisted Detective Bradley at the crime\n\nscene. She testified that there was no evidence of a struggle in the living room\n\narea. She recalled that there was a void in the dust on a television stand in the\n\nliving room indicating that there was previously a television and remote there. She\n\ntestified that there were bloodstains on the dining room table and chairs that led\n\ntoward the master bedroom. The bloodstains on the wall of the bedroom indicated\n\nthat at some point the victim had been standing and had stepped in blood. On the\n\nfloor near the wall next to the refrigerator and the dining room table, there was\n\nblood with drag marks and some pooling of blood. The drag marks indicated that\n\nthe victim was alive and moving erratically as she was dragged from the kitchen\n\narea to the bedroom. There was blood with drag marks in the doorway of the\n\nmaster bedroom. There were bloody shoe impressions from the master bedroom to\n\nthe kitchen.\n\n      The victim had a gaping wound in her throat. The medical examiner\n\ntestified that there were several passes like a sawing motion with a sharp\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\finstrument to create the margin of the wound. The blood stains indicated that the\n\nvictim’s carotid artery was not cut until she got into the bedroom. Her hands and\n\nshirt were saturated with blood. She also had blood running down her abdomen\n\nthat soaked into the waistband of her pants. The amount and pattern of blood on\n\nthe victim’s waistband indicated that she may have been sitting up slightly or\n\nhalfway when she received the neck injury. The victim’s shirt was pulled upwards\n\ntoward her neck, which is consistent with being dragged.\n\n      The laceration to the victim’s throat produced significantly more blood than\n\nwas seen in the blood trail through the kitchen. The victim had a bruise on her\n\ncheek that was consistent with the tread and design of Middleton’s boots. The\n\nvictim had bruises and a cut to her face, a puncture and stab wounds on her chest,\n\nneck, ear, and arms. The bloody shoeprints were well defined closer to the\n\nbedroom and became faint as they continued down the hall. The victim’s son’s\n\nshoes were tested and eliminated as the shoes that caused the bloody shoe\n\nimpressions. Moore testified that this indicated that the blood was likely dried by\n\nthe time the victim’s son found her. There were various items located close to the\n\nvictim’s body, which indicated that she was grabbing for things during the\n\nstruggle. The victim had bloody injuries to her arms and wrists. She had defensive\n\nwounds that indicated that she was trying to get away from someone who had a\n\nknife. None of the injuries to the victim’s extremities would have killed or\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fincapacitated her. The autopsy revealed that the neck injury occurred toward the\n\nend of the attack. Following the neck injury, the victim could have been conscious\n\nfor ten to twenty seconds, and alive for minutes after losing consciousness.\n\n      On the kitchen floor of Middleton’s residence, there was a washed-out shoe\n\nimpression that was similar to those found inside the victim’s residence. This print\n\ntested positive for blood, but no DNA profile could be obtained. The medical\n\nexaminer found blood on the sink of the only bathroom in Middleton’s trailer, but\n\nno DNA profile could be obtained. There was blood beside the dresser in\n\nMiddleton’s bedroom, but the DNA profile was determined to be inconclusive. A\n\ndifferent bloodstain in Middleton’s room matched the victim’s DNA on four of\n\nthirteen points. The probability that a randomly selected Caucasian person could\n\nmatch the same DNA profile at these four locations is one in 41,680.\n\n      Donna Lee and Rolland Ammons’ fingerprints were the only prints found on\n\nthe victim’s television. Middleton’s fingerprints were not found inside the victim’s\n\nresidence. There was no evidence that the trailer had been ransacked or that the\n\nvictim’s things had been rifled through. Moore explained that the vanity in the\n\nvictim’s bedroom had blood spatter on the outside, but not the inside, indicating\n\nthat the door to the cabinet of the vanity was closed during the attack. Inside the\n\ncabinet, there was a purse that appeared to have been thrown in there. There was\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 10 -\n\fevidence of blood spatter on the purse and also blood inside of the purse. The\n\npurse was empty, and there were no fingerprints found on the purse.3\n\n                                   C. Penalty Phase\n\n         During the penalty phase, the defense presented testimony from Dr. James\n\nD. Barnard, and the State presented testimony from Dr. Deborah Leporowski.4\n\nThe defense’s court-appointed mitigation investigator, Joe Parish, also testified, as\n\ndid Middleton’s sisters.\n\n                        1. Psychological Witnesses Testimony\n\n         Dr. Barnard assisted the defense in formulating mitigating evidence and\n\nconducted a mental health evaluation of Middleton. His findings indicated that\n\nMiddleton underreported the type of drugs he abused and the frequency of their\n\nuse. Dr. Barnard determined that Middleton began abusing painkillers after being\n\nprescribed the medications following an accidental fall. He also determined that\n\nMiddleton began smoking marijuana between the ages of ten and thirteen. He\n\ndescribed the onset of cocaine use at age twenty-five, ceasing at age thirty.\n\nAdditionally, Middleton told Dr. Barnard that he had used methamphetamine once\n\na year since he was twenty-eight years old. This statement conflicted with his\n\n\n         3. During the guilt phase, the defense rested without presenting a case-in-\nchief.\n\n      4. They testified consistently with their respective testimony provided at the\nhearing on Middleton’s pretrial motion to suppress his confession.\n\n                                          - 11 -\n\fassertion during his police interview that the day of the murder was the first time\n\nhe had ever used methamphetamine. Dr. Barnard testified that Middleton reported\n\nbriefly being medically treated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nDr. Barnard characterized ADHD as symptomatic of difficulty with impulse\n\ncontrol, difficulty regulating behavior to standards or norms, high-rate motor\n\nactivity, and difficulty focusing attention.\n\n      Dr. Barnard also found that Middleton was possibly exaggerating his\n\nsymptoms, which may sometimes be viewed as a cry for help. Dr. Barnard found\n\nit quite significant that Middleton’s personality type is known to have problems\n\nwith repressed anger and hostility and that persons with this condition are\n\nsometimes able to control their anger but sometimes have anger outbursts that are\n\ndifficult or impossible for them to control. Equally significant, opined Dr.\n\nBarnard, is that individuals with this personality type have real problems\n\nresponding to authority and taking direction and often accept little or no\n\nresponsibility for their behavior. Dr. Barnard concluded that Middleton could not\n\nconform his conduct to the requirements of the law on the day in question and that\n\nhis substance abuse on the date of the murder would have likely impaired anyone’s\n\npsychological controls, even someone who had no difficulty with impulse control.\n\n      On cross-examination, Dr. Barnard admitted that he did not review all of the\n\nrecords in this case, i.e., the depositions of people close to Middleton, his arrest\n\n\n                                         - 12 -\n\fand jail records, and his confession to the murder. Dr. Barnard conceded that\n\nMiddleton is not mentally retarded. The State questioned Dr. Barnard about the\n\nreport that was conducted by Dr. Landrum in August 2009 which found\n\nMiddleton’s IQ to be 72. Dr. Barnard testified that Middleton informed him that\n\nhe did not give his best effort on the IQ test conducted by Dr. Landrum. When Dr.\n\nBarnard administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV) test in\n\nSeptember 2011, he determined that Middleton’s full scale IQ was 83. Dr. Barnard\n\ndetermined that Middleton was not malingering during the exam he administered.\n\nHe stated that he was aware that Middleton was administered the WAIS-IV test for\n\na third time in this case by Dr. Riordan in March 2012.\n\n      Dr. Riordan’s March 2012, evaluation indicated that Middleton’s IQ score\n\nwas 75. Dr. Barnard would have expected Middleton’s IQ score to be higher if all\n\nother factors were stable. This lower score could be an indication of various\n\nfactors including Middleton being under the weather or malingering. There were\n\nno indications that Middleton was ever separated from the general population in\n\nprison due to any mental health issues. Dr. Barnard admitted that Middleton slit\n\nhis wrists in a holding cell and did so in an attempt not to be extradited back to a\n\nfacility in Georgia.\n\n      Dr. Deborah Leporowski testified for the State. She stated that in order to\n\nprepare for her testimony, she reviewed the reports, previous testimony, and\n\n\n                                        - 13 -\n\fdepositions of Doctors Barnard and Riordan and the report of Dr. Landrum. She\n\nalso reviewed the police reports in this case, transcripts, witness interviews, letters\n\nthat Middleton wrote while he was in jail, and Department of Corrections records.\n\nShe also interviewed Middleton. Dr. Leporowski maintained that Middleton’s IQ\n\nscores are illogical with an initial score of 72, a score of 83 two years later and\n\nthen months later receiving a score of 75. Dr. Leporowski opined that a score of\n\n83 is likely Middleton’s actual IQ score. Dr. Leporowski diagnosed Middleton\n\nwith antisocial personality disorder, as did Dr. Barnard.\n\n      Dr. Leporowski determined that Middleton was malingering “or at least\n\nexaggerating” when taking his personality tests. Dr. Leporowski found no history\n\nof mental illness in Middleton’s records or in her interview with him. She rejected\n\nany assertion that Middleton’s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct\n\nor to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially\n\nimpaired. She opined that Middleton’s upbringing did not in any way lead him to\n\nbelieve that those actions involving this crime were okay or were warranted in any\n\nway based on the victim’s behavior. She testified that everything he told her about\n\nthe day of the crimes was logical, made sense, and indicated that he was able to\n\nmake decisions and choices. Dr. Leporowski further noted that Middleton\n\nappeared to remember what he did throughout the day, where he did drugs and\n\nwith whom. On cross-examination, she stated that Middleton’s jail records\n\n\n                                         - 14 -\n\findicated that his detox from drugs while in jail was typical and did not evidence\n\ndrug dependence, but that he used them intermittently when he had access to them.\n\n                           2. Family History Testimony\n\n      The trial court appointed Joe Parrish, a licensed private investigator, to assist\n\nthe defense in developing mitigation for the penalty phase. Mr. Parrish determined\n\nthat Middleton’s mother abused drugs and his older siblings acted as parents to\n\nhim. Middleton expressed to Parrish some depression concerning the death of his\n\nfather figure, a former employer, who had died. Mr. Parrish found that Middleton\n\nwas employed at a welding company for a period of time and was described by the\n\nowner as being a hard worker and very dependable. Parrish also found that\n\nmarijuana use at an early age led Middleton to abuse heavier drugs. Mr. Parrish\n\nspoke with Middleton’s eldest daughter, who lived in the same mobile park with\n\nher mother and younger sister. She explained that in the days leading up to the\n\nmurder, she noticed that her father’s physical appearance had changed and that he\n\nwas abusing drugs. Parrish also described a history of domestic violence between\n\nMiddleton and his girlfriend, Sabrina Jones.\n\n      Devenna Pearson, Middleton’s older sister, testified on his behalf. She\n\ndescribed their childhood as physically and emotionally painful. She explained\n\nthat their mother provided for the necessities of life, such as food, clothing, shelter\n\nand basic hygiene through social security benefits that she received following the\n\n\n                                         - 15 -\n\fdeath of her husband. She explained that she and Middleton were never required\n\nto go to school. Pearson additionally explained that she was sexually molested by\n\nher stepfather for approximately three and a half years, and that her mother was\n\naware of the abuse but did not stop it. Her older sister found out and stopped the\n\nabuse by cutting their abusive stepfather. She recalled that she was sent away for a\n\nfew months and Middleton remained in the house with their mother. She described\n\nher brother, as she knew him growing up, as outgoing, fun and someone who\n\nalways tried to make everyone laugh.\n\n      Dewanna Sprowse, Middleton’s eldest sister, also testified on his behalf.\n\nShe explained that their mother would sell her food stamps for beer and drugs.\n\nSprowse recalled that Middleton did not have clean clothes and fitted shoes, and\n\nthat if she was not home to get her siblings up and ready for school then their\n\nmother would just tell them to go outside and play. She explained that one of her\n\nstepfathers was physically abusive to her younger siblings, including Middleton.\n\nShe testified that their mother had always placed men before her children, and that\n\nshe did not spend any money on holidays, birthdays, or books. She recalled\n\nMiddleton being about age twelve or thirteen when he finally quit going to school.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 16 -\n\fShe described Middleton, as she remembered him growing up, as a sweetheart,\n\ntalented, with a good heart.5\n\n          D. Middleton’s Pretrial Motion to Suppress His Confession\n\n      The defense filed a motion to suppress the defendant’s confession, claiming\n\nthat Middleton was too intoxicated to waive his Miranda rights. The motion\n\nadditionally alleged that Middleton did not possess the intellectual ability to\n\ncomprehend his Miranda rights and that Middleton’s final interview was conducted\n\nafter Middleton’s attorney provided the Sheriff’s Office with a form invoking\n\nMiddleton’s constitutional right to remain silent. The hearing on the motion took\n\nplace on April 10, 2012, and June 29, 2012.\n\n                                 1. Lay Witnesses\n\n      At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Christopher Jenkins testified for\n\nthe defense. He testified that he was disabled and was prescribed Roxicodone and\n\nXanax. He testified that since 2007 he would either sell or give Middleton his\n\nprescription medications. On the day of the murder, he went to Middleton’s trailer\n\nto give him some drugs and to look at the television that Middleton wanted to sell.\n\nHe gave Middleton three Roxicodone pills. Middleton snorted two of the pills\n\nwhile Jenkins was there.\n\n\n       5. The trial court held a Spencer hearing on August 24, 2012. See Spencer\nv. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1618540\"><a href=\"/opinion/1618540/spencer-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">615</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1993). Neither the State nor the defense presented\nany additional evidence.\n\n                                        - 17 -\n\f      The State called Steve Britnell to testify at the suppression hearing. He\n\ntestified consistently with his guilt phase testimony. Britnell recalled he and\n\nMiddleton each taking one Xanax pill on the morning of the murder. He further\n\nrecalled that in the early afternoon, the two shared $20 worth of methamphetamine,\n\nwhich Britnell described as “a little bit.” He indicated that immediately following\n\nthe sale of the television, he drove Middleton to a Circle K to purchase cocaine.\n\nThey each consumed “a line or two” of cocaine in the Circle K parking lot. Later,\n\nCaptain John Rhoden and Lieutenant Brad Stark approached them and asked them\n\nto come to the police station to give a statement. They drove to the station\n\nvoluntarily.\n\n      Captain Rhoden testified that Middleton had no trouble standing or keeping\n\nhis posture, did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, spoke\n\nclearly, and did not appear to have any problems understanding what was being\n\nsaid to him. Lieutenant Stark testified that none of the men appeared to be off-\n\nbalance. Nothing indicated that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol.\n\nOn cross-examination, he stated that it would surprise him to hear that Middleton\n\nhad done crystal meth, cocaine and Xanax during that day.\n\n      Detective Marty Faulkner testified regarding his interviews of Middleton.\n\nThe first interview occurred on July 28, 2009, at 11:56 p.m., in his office, with\n\nanother detective and Assistant State Attorney Ashley Albright present. He read\n\n\n                                        - 18 -\n\fthe Miranda card verbatim to Middleton, who signed, dated and time stamped it.\n\nMiddleton agreed to speak with detectives, but seemed nervous. He stated that\n\nMiddleton appeared to be coherent and not under the influence of any drugs;\n\nMiddleton was responsive to questions and his memory appeared to be fine. The\n\ninterview lasted approximately one hour. Middleton made no admissions during\n\nthis interview.\n\n      Faulkner interviewed Middleton a second time, again in his office, in the\n\nearly morning hours of July 29, 2009. Middleton made no admissions. The third\n\ninterview lasted three minutes, and at that time Middleton claimed that Garrett\n\nWade Fowler had committed the murder. Middleton was placed under arrest at the\n\nend of the third interview. When Faulkner returned to work, at approximately 11\n\na.m., Sergeant Coleman informed him that Middleton wanted to speak with him.\n\nColeman testified and corroborated that Middleton made this request and that he\n\nrelayed the request to Faulkner. This interview lasted for approximately twenty-\n\nthree minutes before Middleton asked to go back to his cell. The officers then\n\nimmediately concluded the interview and returned Middleton to his cell.\n\n      Faulkner further testified that on July 30, he felt obligated to check on\n\nMiddleton, based on Middleton’s state of mind during the interview conducted the\n\nprevious day. When Faulkner arrived, Middleton was in segregation and standing\n\nat the gate of his cell. Middleton asked to speak to him, and Faulkner had\n\n\n                                        - 19 -\n\fMiddleton escorted to his office, where the final interview took place. During this\n\nfinal interview, after repeatedly being advised of his Miranda rights, Middleton\n\nconfessed to murdering Roberta Christensen. On cross-examination, Faulkner\n\nacknowledged that he informed Middleton that he would have to waive his right to\n\ncounsel to speak with him, and it was on the final (approximately seventh) time\n\nthat Faulkner told Middleton what he would have to say in order to waive his\n\nrights, which Middleton had in fact done.\n\n      Assistant Public Defender Stanley Glenn testified that he was initially\n\nappointed to represent Middleton. He stated that on the morning of July 30, 2009,\n\nhe filed an invocation of rights form with the clerk’s office and that afternoon he\n\npersonally delivered it to the Sheriff’s Office front desk, instructing them that it be\n\ngiven to the lead detective investigating Christensen’s death. Glenn first met with\n\nMiddleton the next day and reviewed the form with him. Middleton was very\n\ndepressed at this time. Glenn was concerned that Middleton needed someone to\n\ntalk to and might make incriminating statements. He repeatedly informed\n\nMiddleton not to make any statements without him being present. On cross-\n\nexamination, Glenn acknowledged that unbeknown to him, when he filed the\n\ninvocation of rights form at 11:28 a.m. and delivered it to the Sheriff’s Office that\n\nafternoon on July 30, 2009, the defendant had already confessed at approximately\n\n9:24 a.m. that morning.\n\n\n                                         - 20 -\n\f                          2. Psychological Testimony\n\n       Forensic psychologist Dr. Gregory Landrum testified for the defense at the\n\nsuppression hearing. He testified that he met with Middleton on two occasions in\n\nAugust 2009. He indicated that Middleton was competent to proceed and assist in\n\nhis own defense. He determined that Middleton’s IQ was 72, which is in the\n\nborderline mental retardation range. He additionally determined that Middleton\n\nreads on a fifth-grade level. Dr. Landrum was not asked to do an evaluation\n\nregarding Miranda competency.\n\n       On cross-examination, Dr. Landrum stated emphatically that Middleton is\n\nnot mentally retarded. Dr. Landrum stated that it is possible that Middleton was\n\nfaking when he was examined by Dr. Riordan, who determined that his IQ was 75,\n\nmonths after being examined by Dr. Barnard, who determined that it was 83.\n\nAccording to Dr. Landrum, administering the same tests within a year may result\n\nin a false positive.\n\n       Dr. James Barnard also testified for the defense. He prepared two reports,\n\none of which was a psychological evaluation and the other an examination of\n\nMiddleton’s competency to waive his Miranda rights. He determined that\n\nMiddleton’s full scale IQ was 83. He additionally found that Middleton was not\n\nmalingering. Dr. Barnard indicated that Middleton’s chronic use of drugs resulted\n\nin an increased tolerance for the substances and the need for more of the\n\n\n                                       - 21 -\n\fsubstances to get high. This factor and other factors indicate dependence on a\n\nsubstance as distinguished from abuse. He reported Middleton’s statement that\n\ndrugs make him “go, go, go” and less able to control his impulses and that\n\nMiddleton told him that before he went to jail he had not slept for two nights. Dr.\n\nBarnard opined that Middleton should have been placed in a private detox facility\n\nwhen he was arrested. Dr. Barnard determined that at the time of Middleton’s\n\nconfession, he was likely withdrawing from substances and may have been under\n\nthe effects of substances, at least during the time of his initial interrogation.\n\n      Dr. Barnard administered an instrument entitled “Dr. Thomas Grisso’s\n\nUnderstanding and Appreciating Miranda Rights.” Dr. Barnard testified that\n\nMiddleton’s total score was 13 out of 30, more than two standard deviations below\n\nthe mean. He testified that although Middleton could paraphrase portions of\n\nMiranda, he “showed a very significant weakness in terms of his ability to\n\nintelligently apply knowledge of Miranda, to novel situations.” Dr. Barnard stated\n\nthat it was difficult to reconcile his findings during the testing with what he saw on\n\nthe confession video. He explained that there is no correlation between having had\n\nMiranda warnings administered in the past and actually understanding them. He\n\nalso stated that there are no validity scales for Grisso’s Miranda test.\n\n      On cross-examination, Dr. Barnard stated that Middleton made general\n\nremarks indicating that he may have been malingering during the testing with Dr.\n\n\n                                         - 22 -\n\fLandrum, but he did not specifically mention whether he was referring to the IQ\n\ntest. Dr. Barnard’s testing also indicated that Middleton may have exaggerated\n\nsome of his answers to appear more maladjusted than he actually was on the date\n\nof the testing. Dr. Barnard diagnosed Middleton with antisocial personality\n\ndisorder; he explained that one major feature of this disorder is that the person has\n\na tendency to be untruthful.\n\n      Dr. Barnard further testified that before the Grisso test was administered,\n\nMiddleton stated he had been advised of his rights at least five times. However,\n\nafter the Grisso test, Middleton claimed that he had never been read Miranda\n\nrights, despite his extensive criminal history. After the Grisso test, Middleton told\n\nDr. Barnard that the confession tapes had been altered. Middleton also told the\n\ndoctor that methamphetamines make him think better. Middleton made comments\n\nto Dr. Barnard indicating that the police in Okeechobee violated his rights, which\n\nDr. Barnard opined indicates that he knew what his rights were.\n\n      On redirect, Dr. Barnard stated that the conditions that Middleton was under\n\nat the time of the interrogation, plus the interrogation procedures themselves, made\n\nit more likely that he would acquiesce to the police. He also opined that Middleton\n\ndid not fully comprehend his Miranda rights when he waived them.\n\n      Dr. Michael Riordan testified for the defense. Dr. Riordan was ordered to\n\nconduct a neuropsychological evaluation on Middleton. Dr. Riordan prepared a\n\n\n                                        - 23 -\n\fwritten report, which he subsequently modified or redacted. He modified his\n\noriginal finding that Middleton had brain damage, and in the subsequent report he\n\nindicated that Middleton suffers from a cognitive disorder. He explained that “the\n\ncognitive disorder was the more appropriate term as a neuropsychologist to\n\nreport.” Dr. Riordan reviewed the reports prepared by Dr. Barnard. He agreed\n\nwith Dr. Barnard’s finding that Middleton was incompetent to waive his Miranda\n\nrights at the time of his interrogation, based on his borderline intellectual\n\nfunctioning, his cognitive disorder, and his drug use, which would have caused\n\nwithdrawal at the time of the interrogation. Dr. Riordan also found that Middleton\n\nhad polysubstance dependence disorder. He indicated that Middleton was not\n\nmalingering. Dr. Riordan did not have Middleton perform the Grisso test, but did\n\nnot disagree with Dr. Barnard’s findings.\n\n      Dr. Riordan did not diagnose an antisocial personality disorder. His report\n\nindicated that Middleton had a tendency to exaggerate his problems. Dr. Riordan\n\nhad previously indicated in a February 11, 2012, letter to the defense that\n\nMiddleton was not initially incompetent to waive his Miranda rights, but as the\n\ninterrogation progressed, he became incompetent to proceed. Dr. Riordan wrote a\n\nletter to the defense in April 2012 indicating that Middleton’s drug withdrawal\n\nwould have furthered his incompetence, but Dr. Riordan did not review jail records\n\nto determine whether Middleton was suffering from withdrawal symptoms. And\n\n\n                                         - 24 -\n\fMiddleton did not state that he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms during\n\nthe interrogation. Instead, he told Dr. Riordan that the police harassed him and\n\ntampered with the confession tapes. Dr. Riordan was not aware that Middleton\n\nsigned a Miranda waiver.\n\n      Dr. Deborah Leporowski testified for the State. She testified that she\n\nreviewed Dr. Landrum’s report, along with the deposition reports and in-court\n\ntestimony of Dr. Riordan. She also reviewed Dr. Barnard’s raw data and his\n\ndeposition and was present for his testimony. Additionally, she reviewed\n\nMiddleton’s videotaped confessions, witness statements, drug treatment records,\n\nand Department of Corrections and jail records; she also interviewed Middleton at\n\nthe county jail on May 10, 2012. She did not administer the WAIS test because it\n\nhad already been administered three times. She testified that the discrepancy in the\n\nscores may be due to poor motivation or deliberately underperforming on the test\n\nwith Dr. Riordan. Dr. Leporowski reviewed Dr. Riordan’s testing, his raw data,\n\nand his report and determined that Middleton performed in the average or above-\n\naverage range on most instruments. She opined that “[t]he only areas where he\n\ndemonstrated anything really in an impaired range were instruments that I felt\n\ncould be accounted for by his lack of education.” She observed that his scores\n\nvaried on the memory tests, with delayed recall being in the impaired range and\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 25 -\n\fstated, “Those are essentially the only two areas where there’s anything that’s not\n\nperfectly intact in the overall neuropsychological functioning area.”\n\n          Dr. Leporowski stated that she would not diagnose the defendant with brain\n\ndamage or a cognitive disorder. She stated there was nothing in the testing that\n\nwould indicate that Middleton had trouble comprehending the Miranda warnings.\n\nAdditionally, she said Middleton was candid with her about his drug use on the day\n\nof the murder and even told her that there was another drug that he used that day\n\nthat Britnell did not report. He did not have difficulty reporting the information in\n\na logical order.\n\n          In addition to not administering another WAIS-IV, Dr. Leporowski did not\n\nadminister another Grisso test. She explained that one shortcoming of the exam is\n\nthat it was developed for a certain jurisdiction, in 1980, and the language that the\n\nexam tests for has not been updated, despite the change in the administration of the\n\nwarnings across jurisdictions. Middleton told Dr. Leporowski that he was\n\nthreatened and that the confession tapes had been altered. She concluded that\n\nMiddleton had the capacity to knowingly and intelligently waive his Miranda\n\nrights.\n\n          Dr. Leporowski disagreed with Dr. Riordan’s testimony indicating that\n\nMiddleton was suffering from withdrawal. She opined that withdrawal typically\n\noccurs seventy-two hours after consuming drugs and alcohol. She explained that\n\n\n                                         - 26 -\n\fon his jail medical records, he is described as cool, cooperative, coherent, and not\n\nagitated. Dr. Leporowski spoke with the jail nurse, who indicated that they never\n\nhad to use detox protocols for Middleton and that he did not need any medical\n\nattention at all. She opined that this is indicative of his intermittent, rather than his\n\ncontinuous, use of the substances. Dr. Leporowski found that Middleton was\n\nmalingering during her evaluations of him.\n\n      On cross-examination, Dr. Leporowski acknowledged that Middleton\n\nreported doing methamphetamine before lunch, followed by eighty milligrams of\n\nOxyContin, then Roxicodone that afternoon at his trailer, and Xanax and cocaine\n\nlater that evening. He also indicated that he walked down to Brewskis and\n\nconsumed a couple of beers and three lines of cocaine.\n\n      The trial court denied the defense’s motion to suppress Middleton’s\n\nconfession.\n\n                                  II. ANALYSIS\n\n                            A. Avoid Arrest Aggravator\n\n      Middleton first argues that the trial court erred in finding the avoid arrest\n\naggravator. We agree that the record does not support this aggravator as\n\nMiddleton’s sole or dominant motivation for the murder. This Court has\n\nconsistently held that where the victim is not a law enforcement officer, “the State\n\nmust show that the sole or dominant motive for the murder was the elimination of\n\n\n                                          - 27 -\n\fthe witness” in order to prove this aggravator.

The trial court’s order on this issue lists eight facts that\n\nsupport this aggravator:\n\n      (1) the defendant personally knew the victim, and went to her home\n      without any type of disguise; (2) the defendant told Garret Wade\n      Fowler that he was going to rob Roberta Christensen, after seeing a\n      large amount of money inside her home the day before; (3) the\n      defendant walked 130 feet to the victim’s home in broad daylight;\n      (4) the defendant knew that the victim was home because he could see\n      her red car from his own home, and the car was parked directly in\n      front of the entrance to her home; (5) the defendant knew that the\n      victim’s husband was out of town and she was home alone; (6) the\n      victim did not pose any physical threat to the defendant; (7) the\n      defendant armed himself with a knife from his residence, before going\n      over to the victim’s home; and (8) the victim was the defendant’s\n      neighbor, who lived almost directly across the street.\n\nIn addition, the trial court indicated that the main object of the criminal endeavor\n\nwas the tip money, not the television. Finally, the trial judge said that if the victim\n\nwas left alive the defendant would have been quickly arrested.\n\n      Notably, only a few of these factors have a direct bearing on or support the\n\navoid arrest aggravator (i.e., the defendant knew the victim and did not wear a\n\ndisguise and the defendant would have been promptly arrested had the victim lived\n\nand identified him). Many of the other factors listed by the trial court for this\n\naggravator either supported Middleton’s statement that he went to the victim’s\n\nhome to borrow money, or that he went there only intending to rob her, before\n\n\n                                         - 28 -\n\fthings became “crazy.” This Court has determined that the eighth factor listed is\n\nnot enough to prove this aggravator. See Foster v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1703316\"><a href=\"/opinion/1703316/foster-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">778</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">906</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla.\n\n2000); Consalvo v.

Additionally, the trial\n\ncourt’s determination that Middleton’s primary objective was to obtain the “easily\n\nconcealable tip money,” implies that pecuniary gain was a dominant motive for the\n\nkilling.\n\n       In Davis, Green, and Perry, the defendants raised similar issues involving\n\nthe avoid arrest aggravator. In each of these cases, this Court struck the avoid\n\narrest aggravator even though the defendants were acquainted with the victims. In\n\nDavis, the defendant stabbed an elderly female acquaintance inside her home and\n\nstole some of the victim’s belongings before exiting the residence. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 795. In Green, the defendant and his girlfriend went to the home of their\n\nlandlords, a married couple, and paid them $250, under the threat of an impending\n\neviction. Green, 583 So. 2d at 648. Green went home, changed his shirt, grabbed\n\nthe largest butcher knife from his kitchen and went back to his landlord’s house.\n\nWhen he arrived at the house, his landlord let him into the house, but was adamant\n\nabout keeping Green’s check. Green stabbed the husband and wife. Green\n\nreturned the knife to his home and, later that night, hitched a ride from\n\nHillsborough County to St. Petersburg and then to Ft. Lauderdale. In Perry, the\n\ndefendant killed his neighbor during a robbery attempt. 522 So. 2d at 819. The\n\n\n                                        - 29 -\n\ffact that the victims could have identified the defendants was not enough to\n\ndemonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the sole or dominant motive for the\n\nmurders was witness elimination.\n\n      Although the trial judge correctly stated that the avoid arrest aggravator can\n\nbe supported by circumstantial evidence through inferences from the facts in the\n\nrecord, his reliance on cases such as Jennings v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1105837\"><a href=\"/opinion/1105837/jennings-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">718</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1998),\n\nand Riley v.

In Jennings\n\nwe upheld the finding of this aggravator based on the fact that the defendant knew\n\nthe victim, used gloves, and stated that if he ever committed a robbery he would\n\nnot leave any witnesses. And in Riley, we affirmed the finding of this aggravator\n\nbased on the defendant knowing the victim coupled with the fact that the victim\n\nwas “executed after one of the perpetrators expressed a concern for subsequent\n\nidentification.”\n\n        Although the trial court infers that Middleton killed the victim because he\n\nwould have been arrested quickly if he had left her alive, there are no other facts\n\nthat indicate that this was his sole or dominant reason for killing her, especially in\n\nthe absence of other evidence indicating that Middleton was specifically concerned\n\nabout eliminating the victim as a witness. Therefore, we strike this aggravating\n\ncircumstance.\n\n                                B. CCP Aggravator\n\n\n                                         - 30 -\n\f      Middleton next challenges the trial court’s finding of the cold, calculated\n\nand premeditated aggravator (CCP). On appeal, it is this Court’s task to review the\n\nrecord to ensure that the trial court applied the correct rule of law for each\n\naggravating circumstance, and if so, determine whether there is competent\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record to support the finding. Willacy v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1729119\"><a href=\"/opinion/1729119/willacy-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">696</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 695 (Fla. 1997). We agree with Middleton that there was not competent,\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record to support this aggravator.\n\n      In order to establish the CCP aggravator, it is the State’s burden to prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) “the killing was the product of cool and calm\n\nreflection and not an act prompted by emotional frenzy, panic, or a fit of rage\n\n(cold)”; (2) “the defendant had a careful plan or prearranged design to commit\n\nmurder before the fatal incident (calculated)”; (3) “the defendant exhibited\n\nheightened premeditation (premeditated)”; and (4) “the defendant had no pretense\n\nof moral or legal justification.” Franklin v.

Further, “the evidence must prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the defendant planned or prearranged to commit murder\n\n\n                                         - 31 -\n\fbefore the crime began.” Thompson v.

State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1611010\"><a href=\"/opinion/1611010/swafford-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 277 (Fla. 1988)).\n\n      In this case, the evidence is inconsistent with the murder being a product of\n\ncool and calm reflection. Although Middleton procured a knife prior to entering\n\nthe victim’s residence, there is no evidence that he possessed the weapon for the\n\npurpose of attacking the victim. Rather, Middleton planned to commit a robbery.\n\nIn walking over to the victim’s residence, Middleton did not conceal his identity.\n\nThe evidence suggests that while inside the victim’s residence, the victim refused\n\nMiddleton’s request for money. After a struggle ensued, Middleton fatally stabbed\n\nthe victim. It was during the course of this struggle when Middleton formulated\n\nhis intent to kill her. Middleton’s behavior at the time of the murder can be aptly\n\ndescribed as murder committed in a frenzied rage or during a heated struggle\n\nfollowing the victim’s refusal to give him money. Following this spontaneous\n\nmurder—which was not carried out as a matter of course—the victim’s body\n\nremained in her residence; Middleton left her home with the victim’s property, to\n\nwit, her television.\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 32 -\n\f      Based on this evidence, we conclude that the State did not prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that Middleton had a careful prearranged plan or design to\n\nmurder the victim before he entered the victim’s residence. Thus, we disagree with\n\nthe trial court’s finding that the murder was a planned event, not a sudden,\n\nimpulsive act. Although following the murder Middleton washed his hands in his\n\nkitchen sink, changed his clothes, and placed his bloody clothes in a bag with the\n\nmurder weapon—as noted by the trial court—these actions do not prove that he\n\nplanned the murder beforehand.\n\n       We conclude that the evidence is not indicative of a heightened\n\npremeditated intent to murder. The facts in this case are similar to Castro v. State,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1660143\"><a href=\"/opinion/1660143/castro-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 991 (Fla. 1994), which did not involve a careful design and\n\nheightened premeditation necessary for CCP when “the record reflect[ed] that\n\nCastro planned to rob Scott.” In addition, we did not find the murder in\n\nHansbrough v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1788670\"><a href=\"/opinion/1788670/hansbrough-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1081</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1086 (Fla. 1987), to show the cold and\n\ncalculated premeditation necessary for CCP where there “appear[ed] to be a\n\nrobbery that got out of hand,” resulting in a “frenzied stabbing.” Accordingly, we\n\nconclude that there is no competent, substantial evidence to support the finding of\n\nthe CCP aggravator. Therefore, we strike the finding of this aggravator.\n\n      “When this Court strikes an aggravating factor on appeal, ‘the harmless error\n\ntest is applied to determine whether there is no reasonable possibility that the error\n\n\n                                        - 33 -\n\faffected the sentence.’ ” Williams v.

Despite striking the avoid arrest and CCP\n\naggravators, two valid aggravators remain in this unanimous death-\n\nrecommendation case. The two aggravators which remain are that the murder was\n\nespecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel (HAC) and that it was committed during the\n\ncommission of a burglary and for pecuniary gain, which were each given “great\n\nweight” by the trial court. The trial court did not find any statutory mitigation\n\napplicable in this case.\n\n      In its sentencing order, the trial court expressly stated that any of the\n\nconsidered aggravating circumstances found in this case, standing alone, would be\n\nsufficient to outweigh the mitigation in total presented regarding the Christensen\n\nmurder. In Smith v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1595830\"><a href=\"/opinion/1595830/smith-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">838</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 868 (Fla. 2009), this Court held that the\n\ntrial court’s erroneous finding of the CCP aggravator was harmless because the\n\nsentencing order provided that “any one of the aggravators found (except the\n\nfelony probation aggravator) was sufficient to outweigh the mitigating\n\ncircumstances found in this case and due to the other applicable aggravating\n\nfactors.” Therefore, it is clear that the trial court would have imposed a death\n\n\n                                        - 34 -\n\fsentence for Middleton absent the avoid arrest and CCP aggravators. Because we\n\nconclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the erroneous findings of the\n\navoid arrest and CCP aggravators contributed to Middleton’s death sentence, the\n\nerrors were harmless.\n\n                                  C. Proportionality\n\n      Middleton argues that without the avoid arrest and CCP aggravators, his\n\ndeath sentence is disproportionate as compared to cases such as Perry and Davis.\n\nAfter striking the two aggravators in this case, we find that the sentence of death is\n\nstill proportional to similar cases.\n\n      In order to ensure uniformity in death penalty proceedings, this Court\n\nundertakes a comprehensive analysis of the aggravating and mitigating\n\ncircumstances to determine whether the case falls within the category of the most\n\naggravated and least mitigated.

The trial court determined that the proposed mitigator that Middleton’s\ncapacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to\nthe requirements of the law was substantially impaired was not proven.\n\n                                         - 36 -\n\fdefendant was subjected to chronic neglect, as well as made aware of sexual abuse\n\nthat was inflicted by his stepfather upon his sister (little weight); (j) the defendant\n\nexpressed remorse for his crime (little weight); and (k) the defendant exhibited\n\nappropriate courtroom behavior (little weight).\n\n      Having stricken two of the aggravators, this Court must analyze the two\n\nappropriately found aggravators of HAC and during the commission of a\n\nburglary/pecuniary gain with the nonstatutory mitigators outlined above. We begin\n\nthis analysis with the trial court’s weighing of both the aggravators and mitigators.\n\nEach of the aggravators was given great weight. We have in a long line of cases\n\nfound the HAC aggravator to be one of the most serious in our limited statutory\n\naggravating circumstances. See, e.g., Larkins v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1707034\"><a href=\"/opinion/1707034/larkins-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">739</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1999).\n\nSignificantly, the trial court only gave one of the nonstatutory mitigators “some\n\nweight” and the other eleven were given “little weight.” Additionally, because\n\nsome of the mitigators were similar, the trial court analyzed them together.\n\nNamely, the trial court combined the analysis for the defendant’s proposed\n\nmitigator of low IQ with his diagnoses of ADHD. The trial court also combined\n\nthe analysis for the defendant’s proposed mitigators of no adult role models, his\n\nmother being emotionally unavailable, the defendant being chronically neglected,\n\nand his sister being molested by his stepfather.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 37 -\n\f      The defense argues that this case is similar to Davis v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1702088\"><a href=\"/opinion/1702088/davis-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">794</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(Fla. 1992), and Perry v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1625128\"><a href=\"/opinion/1625128/perry-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1988). However, both are\n\ndistinguishable from this case. In Davis this Court, after striking two aggravators,\n\ndid not impose a life sentence. Rather we remanded the matter to the trial judge\n\nfor reconsideration of the sentence because we could not determine beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the trial judge would have imposed a death sentence in the\n\nabsence of the two aggravators that were stricken. The trial judge ultimately\n\ndetermined that the remaining aggravating circumstances outweighed the\n\nmitigating circumstances and reimposed a sentence of death. We affirmed. The\n\nfact that Davis ultimately received a life sentence was not based on the elimination\n\nof aggravating circumstances but was the result of postconviction relief for\n\nineffective assistance of counsel regarding racial comments.\n\n      This Court in Perry had to address a situation involving a judge’s override of\n\na jury recommendation of life. In order to uphold the imposition of a death\n\nsentence under those circumstances, we must find that no reasonable person could\n\ndiffer with the sentence of death. See Tedder v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1850172\"><a href=\"/opinion/1850172/tedder-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1975).\n\nWhile Perry also involved the striking of two aggravating circumstances, that\n\nfactor was not the basis for the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment. This\n\nCourt made it clear that there were mitigating circumstances presented to the jury\n\nthat the jury could have considered in reaching its determination of a life sentence.\n\n\n                                        - 38 -\n\fThus, we said the Tedder standard had not been met, and the case was remanded\n\nfor imposition of a life sentence without parole for twenty five years.\n\n      This case is, however, more similar to Geralds v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1628173\"><a href=\"/opinion/1628173/geralds-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">674</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla.\n\n1996), where this Court found the defendant’s death sentence to be proportionate\n\nunder circumstances much like the ones presented here. In Geralds the jury\n\nunanimously voted for a death sentence, the same aggravators were proven beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, and the trial court gave minimal weight to the defendant’s\n\nmitigation. Geralds was a carpenter who worked remodeling the victim’s trailer.\n\nKnowing that the victim’s husband was out of town, he attacked her, beating her,\n\nstabbing her in the neck and stealing various items from the home. At his original\n\nsentencing, the trial court found the same four aggravators that were found in this\n\ncase. We struck the CCP and witness elimination aggravators, and remanded for a\n\nnew penalty phase. On appeal from the subsequent sentencing, we again struck the\n\nCCP aggravator, but found there was no reasonable likelihood of a life sentence\n\nunder the circumstance of that case. 674 So. 2d at 104-05.\n\n      In both this case and Geralds, the juries unanimously recommended\n\nsentences of death. Both cases ultimately have the aggravators of heinous,\n\natrocious, and cruel murder during the course of a felony/pecuniary gain, and the\n\naggravators were given great weight. The mitigators in each case were\n\nnonstatutory, with exception of the age mitigator found in Geralds, and in each\n\n\n                                        - 39 -\n\finstance they were given little or very little weight. We conclude here, as we did\n\nin Geralds, that even without the aggravators that were stricken, the trial court\n\nwould have found the aggravating factors substantially outweighed the mitigating\n\nevidence. We, therefore, find that Middleton’s death sentence is proportional.\n\n               D. Order of Penalty Phase Witnesses/Continuance\n\n      Middleton argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his\n\nmotion to continue the penalty phase to allow the family to travel to the trial and\n\npresent mitigation testimony prior to the expert testimony. The defense argues that\n\nthis ruling prohibited the defense from setting the predicate for the expert\n\ntestimony through the lay witness testimony. The decision of whether to grant a\n\nmotion for continuance is in the sound discretion of the trial court. In re Gregory,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1905350\"><a href=\"/opinion/1905350/in-re-gregory/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 737 (Fla. 1975). This Court has made clear that it will cautiously\n\nreview the trial court’s decision to deny such a motion and will not reverse the\n\ndecision unless there has been a palpable abuse of this judicial discretion which\n\nclearly and affirmatively appears in the record. Magill v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1115067\"><a href=\"/opinion/1115067/magill-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1188 (Fla. 1980); Cooper v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1804294\"><a href=\"/opinion/1804294/cooper-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1133</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1138 (Fla. 1976).\n\n      To prevail on his motion for continuance, the defendant was required to\n\nshow: (1) prior due diligence to obtain the witness’s presence; (2) that substantially\n\nfavorable testimony would have been forthcoming; (3) that the witness was\n\navailable and willing to testify; and (4) that the denial of the continuance caused\n\n\n                                        - 40 -\n\fmaterial prejudice. Geralds v. State, 674 So. 2d at 99 (citing United States v.\n\nO’Neill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454949\"><a href=\"/opinion/454949/united-states-v-william-thomas-oneill-united-states-of-america-v-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 784 (11th Cir. 1985)).\n\n      On the requirement of prior due diligence, the defense admitted that it did\n\nnot use the proper subpoena to ensure that the witnesses traveled from Georgia to\n\nprovide testimony on the date scheduled for their testimony. The trial court gave a\n\nfull day in between the guilt and the penalty phase to allow both sides to resolve\n\nany issues with witness availability. Despite this, the defense witnesses were not\n\navailable to testify. In rejecting the defense’s motion for a continuance, the trial\n\ncourt offered the defense an opportunity to allow its investigator to travel to\n\nGeorgia to pick up the witnesses and bring them to court or, alternatively, to live\n\nstream their testimony from a facility in Georgia. Had the defense done its due\n\ndiligence, the trial court could have been made aware of the possibility that\n\nMiddleton’s relatives could not travel, and these same arrangements could have\n\nbeen made a day prior, without the need for a continuance.\n\n      As to the second, third, and fourth requirements, the denial of the motion did\n\nnot prevent the jury from hearing the testimony of the relatives, and there is no\n\nindication that the defense was materially prejudiced. It only required the jury to\n\nhear this evidence after the expert witness testimony. Additionally, the expert\n\nwitness essentially provided general details about the defendant’s childhood, which\n\nwere corroborated by the relatives’ testimony. Although the defense may have\n\n\n                                        - 41 -\n\fbeen inconvenienced by the denial of the motion because it preferred for the\n\nrelatives to testify before the experts, the denial of the continuance did not prevent\n\nthe jury from hearing the testimony. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying Middleton’s motion for a continuance.\n\n           E. Denial of Defense’s Request for a Mitigation Specialist\n\n      Middleton argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the\n\ndefense funds to appoint a mitigation specialist. The appointment of experts is\n\nwithin the trial court’s discretion. San Martin v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1913373\"><a href=\"/opinion/1913373/san-martin-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1347 (Fla.\n\n1997). A trial court’s denial of funds to an indigent defendant for appointment of\n\nan expert will not be disturbed unless there has been an abuse of discretion. Id.\n\nFlorida appellate courts use a two-part test to evaluate an alleged abuse of\n\ndiscretion: (1) whether the defendant made a particularized showing of need; and\n\n(2) whether the defendant was prejudiced by the court’s denial of the motion\n\nrequesting the expert assistance. Id. If such a request is denied, and not later\n\nrenewed by the party asserting the need, it is waived. Id.\n\n      On October 28, 2010, the parties attended a hearing where the trial court\n\ngranted the defense’s motions to appoint co-counsel and a fact investigator. In\n\nappointing the investigator, the trial court stated that “in a death penalty case with\n\nissues of mitigation, it’s almost self-evident” why the defense would need an\n\ninvestigator. The very next motion that the trial judge heard in that proceeding was\n\n\n                                         - 42 -\n\fthe defendant’s motion to appoint a mitigation specialist. The State objected to the\n\nmotion, stating that an expert was not needed to do the type of investigations that a\n\nmitigation specialist is expected to do.\n\n      The trial court denied the motion pursuant to Leon Shaffer Golnick Adver.,\n\nInc. v. Cedar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1150852\"><a href=\"/opinion/1150852/leon-shaffer-golnick-advertising-inc-v-cedar/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1015</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 4th DCA 1982), stating that the defense was\n\nasking him to disregard an administrative order from the chief judge of the circuit,\n\nwhich set a maximum hourly rate for specialists on the case, “based on nothing\n\nother than representations of counsel” that the mitigation specialist’s work would\n\nnot be “duplicative of [the investigator just appointed].” The trial court refused to\n\nappoint a mitigation specialist because the defense did not demonstrate a\n\nparticularized need or showing for one. Therefore, the trial court denied the\n\nmotion without prejudice and invited the defense to set a hearing on the motion in\n\nthe future when it could demonstrate a particularized need.\n\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defense’s motion to\n\nappoint a mitigation specialist. The defense did not demonstrate a particularized\n\nneed for the mitigation specialist, in light of its having been granted the\n\nappointment of an experienced investigator. The defense claims that only the\n\nmitigation specialist can explain how his or her responsibilities are different from\n\nthose of a fact investigator. This argument is not persuasive. Although a\n\nmitigation specialist can best explain his or her capabilities and strategy, the\n\n\n                                           - 43 -\n\fattorney requesting the services should at the very least be able to provide the court\n\nwith an explanation of what the mitigation specialist is expected to provide that the\n\nfact investigator may not. Without this explanation, the defense is requesting for\n\nthe court to provide state funds for the defense to conduct what may very well be\n\nthe gathering of information cumulative to that gathered by the court-appointed\n\nfact investigator.\n\n      Middleton’s reliance on Ake v. Oklahoma, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111356\"><a href=\"/opinion/111356/ake-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985), is misplaced.\n\nIn Ake, the Supreme Court reversed because the state court did not provide the\n\ndefendant expenses for a psychiatric evaluation to assess his sanity at the time of\n\nthe crime. Id. Importantly, in that case, the defendant was initially declared\n\nincompetent to stand trial. Id. Therefore, the Supreme Court determined that the\n\ndefendant was entitled to a psychiatrist once he made a preliminary showing that\n\nhis sanity at the time of the offense was likely to be a significant factor at trial. Id.\n\n       In this case, Middleton was evaluated by four different doctors and was also\n\nappointed a fact investigator. Additionally, during the hearing on Middleton’s\n\nmotion to appoint a mitigation specialist, the defense told the court that it would\n\ncome back a few months before the trial to request the appointment of a mitigation\n\nexpert, and the court invited the defense to do so. The defense never renewed the\n\nmotion. If at any point the defense could specifically demonstrate how a\n\nmitigation specialist was imperative to its case, in addition to the other previously\n\n\n                                          - 44 -\n\fprovided experts, the defense could have set a hearing on the motion that had\n\nalready been filed. Because error has not been demonstrated, we deny relief on\n\nthis claim. Although we find no abuse of discretion in this case, we note that it\n\nmay be appropriate in other cases for a trial court to grant the defense’s request to\n\nappoint a mitigation specialist.\n\n                    F. Individualized Sentencing Requirement\n\n      Middleton raises numerous claims to support his argument that the trial court\n\ndid not perform the individualized sentencing required for death penalty cases. He\n\nfirst claims the trial court improperly and arbitrarily rejected findings of medical\n\nexperts, and cites Nowitzke v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1116737\"><a href=\"/opinion/1116737/nowitzke-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1346</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1990), for support. In\n\nNowitzke, however, this Court reiterated that it is improper for the prosecution to\n\ndiscredit the insanity defense, as a legal defense, in front of the jury. Id. at 1355.\n\nNo defense of insanity was made in this case, and no argument based on Nowitzke\n\nwas made. Instead the defense argues for a new penalty phase claiming the trial\n\njudge denigrated the field of psychology and rejected the findings of the experts.\n\nThis argument is based on the trial court’s agreement with and citation to the\n\ndissent in United States v. Byers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"439952\"><a href=\"/opinion/439952/united-states-v-billy-g-byers/\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1104</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 1984), where the\n\ndissenting judge commented on the imprecision of the science of psychiatry.\n\nDespite this agreement, the trial court evaluated the testimony of all of the experts\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 45 -\n\fwho testified about the defendant’s mental status and determined that Dr.\n\nLeporowski was more credible. Relief on this issue is not warranted.\n\n      Middleton additionally claims that the trial court used a strawman argument\n\nto denigrate the defense’s mitigation. See Consalvo v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">805</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 814-\n\n15 (Fla. 1996) (explaining that a strawman argument is one where the prosecutor\n\ncreates an issue not raised by the defense then proceeds to knock it down). In this\n\ncase, the trial court did not manufacture an argument for the purpose of using the\n\ntestimony regarding Middleton’s psychological state. The defense argued and the\n\ntrial court considered the mitigating factor of substantial impairment. The\n\npsychological data the trial court used to find that Middleton was not impaired was\n\npreviously presented to assess Middleton’s mental state, and the two experts that\n\ntestified during the penalty phase were repeatedly questioned about those reports\n\nand asked to compare their findings to the reports of the nontestifying doctors. The\n\ntrial court considered the entire record of proceedings where Middleton’s\n\npsychological capacity was concerned. This strawman argument has no merit. See\n\nPerez v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">919</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 374 (Fla. 2005) (determining that the trial court was\n\nallowed to use in-court testimony and an expert’s report, which was admitted into\n\nevidence during the Spencer hearing, to conclude that the mitigator of inability to\n\nconform conduct to the requirements of the law was not established).\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 46 -\n\f      Middleton next claims that the trial court improperly rejected mitigating\n\nevidence of impaired capacity. The trial court provided a thorough explanation of\n\nwhy it was rejecting the statutory mitigator that defendant’s ability to conform his\n\nconduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired.7 The trial court\n\ncompared the testimony of Dr. Barnard, who determined that the defendant was\n\nnot “substantially impaired,” to the testimony of Dr. Leporowski, who stated that\n\nshe saw no evidence that the defendant was suffering from a mental disorder and\n\nnoted that the defendant made rational decisions on the night of the murder. After\n\nconsidering the record, the trial court determined that the statutory mitigator did\n\nnot exist. See Walker v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1672000\"><a href=\"/opinion/1672000/walker-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">707</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 318 (Fla. 1997) (contradictory\n\nevidence on mitigating factor supports trial court’s conclusion that factor did not\n\nexist). Relief on this claim is denied.\n\n      Middleton further claims the trial court used the wrong standard in\n\nevaluating his abusive childhood and abused its discretion in assigning weight to\n\nthis mitigation, citing Mines v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1902559\"><a href=\"/opinion/1902559/mines-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1980), and Campbell v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1600179\"><a href=\"/opinion/1600179/campbell-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1990), receded from on other grounds by Trease v.\n\n\n\n       7. Middleton also argues the trial court should have evaluated the evidence\nas nonstatutory mitigation. It is clear from the trial court’s discussion that\nconsideration was given to substantial impairment, significant impairment, and\nimpairment, and the court found none had been demonstrated. It should also be\nnoted that the trial court used the mental health and drug use evidence to support\nother nonstatutory mitigation.\n\n\n                                          - 47 -\n\fState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1139948\"><a href=\"/opinion/1139948/trease-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">768</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1050</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 2000), as support. Both Mines and Campbell stand for\n\nthe proposition that once a trial court determines that a defendant is not insane, it\n\nmust still consider the statutory mental mitigating factors. Campbell, 571 So. 2d at\n\n418-19; Mines, 390 So. 2d at 337. The trial court below did not reject the statutory\n\nmental mitigators after finding Middleton to be sane; it rejected them after a\n\nreasoned analysis comparing the findings of the mental health experts who\n\nevaluated him. To the extent that Middleton argues that the trial court erred in\n\nusing the sanity standard to reject the nonstatutory mental mitigation and assigned\n\nit improper weight, this Court addressed this issue in Consalvo. In that case, this\n\nCourt found that where the trial court would have likely accorded a mitigating\n\ncircumstance the same amount of weight had it used a different standard, the\n\ndefendant’s claim should be denied. 697 So. 2d at 818-19. The trial court\n\nincorporated its analysis from the order on Middleton’s motion to suppress his\n\nconfession and additionally referred to Dr. Leporowski’s finding that the defendant\n\nwas thinking rationally on the night of the murder. Therefore, it is not likely that a\n\ndifferent standard of review would have changed the trial court’s ruling on this\n\nissue.\n\n                  G. Admission of Middleton’s Confession Video\n\n         Middleton’s motion to suppress his confession contained three general\n\nallegations: (1) that the defendant’s statements were illegally obtained because the\n\n\n                                         - 48 -\n\fconsumption of drugs and alcohol caused him to become incompetent to proceed\n\nwith the interview process, invalidating his waiver of his rights; (2) that the\n\ndefendant does not have the intellectual ability to adequately comprehend his\n\nMiranda rights in order to knowingly and intelligently waive them; and (3) that the\n\nfinal interview was conducted after the defendant was represented by counsel and\n\nafter his court-appointed counsel filed his Invocation of Constitutional Rights form\n\nwith the clerk on July 30, 2009, at 11:28 a.m. The trial court in the order on the\n\nmotion specifically addressed each allegation, and denied the motion. Middleton\n\nnow claims that the admission of this evidence into his trial was error, based on the\n\nsame claims raised in his pretrial motion.8 We conclude that the motion to\n\nsuppress was properly denied.\n\n      A trial court’s decision to deny a motion to suppress comes to this Court\n\ncloaked with a presumption that its factual findings are correct, but we\n\napply a de novo standard of review to legal issues and mixed questions of law and\n\nfact which ultimately determine constitutional issues. Smithers v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1630282\"><a href=\"/opinion/1630282/smithers-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 916, 924-25 (Fla. 2002).

It does not appear that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\ndenying Middleton’s motion to suppress his confession. The trial court determined\n\n\n\n                                        - 50 -\n\fthat the office where the confession occurred was a standard office, and not an\n\ninterrogation room or any other\n\n      particularly threatening or intimidating venue. The defendant did not\n      appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. His speech was\n      clear and coherent. His answers are fairly responsive to the questions\n      asked. He was capable of articulating thoughts, giving directions and\n      describing events. More importantly, the video tape confirms and\n      corroborates fully the testimony of Captain John Rhoden, Lieutenant\n      Brad Stark, Detective Marty Faulkner and Dr. Deborah Lep[o]rowski.\n      It is more difficult to reconcile the videotape with the testimony of\n      Drs. James B[a]rnard and Michael Riordan.\n\nThese findings are supported by the record.\n\n      The trial court also determined that, based on the testimony of Middleton’s\n\nfriend, Britnell, and the officers who encountered Middleton on the night of the\n\nmurder, he did not appear to be so influenced by drugs and alcohol as to be\n\nincoherent or not understand that he was waiving his right to remain silent. The\n\ntrial court also observed that of the four psychologists who evaluated Middleton,\n\nDr. Leporowski appeared to have been the most thorough; she reviewed all of the\n\nrecords and gave the most reasonable explanation for the discrepancies between\n\nthe doctors on the issue of Middleton’s capacity to knowingly and voluntarily\n\nwaive his right.\n\n      As to the defendant’s claim regarding the invocation of rights form filed by\n\nthe attorney, the trial court observed that it is clear from the record that\n\nMiddleton’s invocation of rights form had not been executed or served on law\n\n\n                                         - 51 -\n\fenforcement prior to the defendant’s last interview. The written invocation of\n\nrights was filed in the court file at 11:28 a.m. on July 30, 2009, and served on the\n\nSheriff’s Office that afternoon after the defendant’s last interview, which was\n\nconducted that morning at approximately 9:24 a.m.\n\n      The trial court’s finding that Middleton initiated contact with Detective\n\nFaulkner is also supported by the record. It is clear from the record that Middleton\n\ninitiated the final interview with Detective Faulkner, understood that he had the\n\nright to remain silent, and voluntarily chose to waive it. At the beginning of the\n\nfourth interview, the defendant was reminded of his Miranda rights. He continued\n\nto blame Wade Fowler; he was arrested minutes later. When Detective Faulkner\n\narrived at the Sheriff’s Office on July 29, 2009, at approximately 11 a.m., he was\n\nnotified that Middleton was requesting to speak to him again. The recording began\n\nat 12:35 p.m. On the recording, Detective Faulkner confirmed that Middleton had\n\nin fact requested to speak to him and that Middleton had not yet been to first\n\nappearance. Detective Faulkner read Middleton his Miranda rights and Middleton\n\nwaived his right to remain silent. After initially asking why a different man was\n\nnot in jail, Middleton began to ramble about clearing his conscience and getting his\n\nlife together. The detectives repeatedly asked him not to waste their time.\n\nMiddleton began to explain the events of the day, including drug use. He\n\nexplained that he and Steve Britnell went to someone’s house and did OxyContin\n\n\n                                        - 52 -\n\fand smoked methamphetamine. He did not remember what time he went to the\n\nvictim’s trailer, only that it was less than twenty minutes after Fowler and Britnell\n\nwent to Walmart. He stated that he knocked on the victim’s door and things just\n\nwent “crazy.” He described the events as “foggy.” When Detective Faulkner\n\nfollowed up with a question about how long Middleton was at the victim’s trailer\n\nbefore the altercation occurred, Middleton stated that he did not want to talk\n\nanymore and requested to go back to his cell. Detective Faulkner immediately\n\nstates, “The time is now 12:58 P.M., concluding the interview with Dale.”\n\n      Faulkner testified that he went over to the jail the next day, July 30, to check\n\non Middleton because he was so distraught the night before. He stated that upon\n\nseeing him at the jail, Middleton requested to speak to him again. Detective\n\nFaulkner immediately had one of the corrections officers escort Middleton to his\n\noffice. The Sheriff’s Office and the jail are connected, with the distance from\n\nFaulkner’s office and the jail being approximately fifty yards. The jury reviewed\n\nthe January 30, 2009, recording of Middleton’s interview, along with a transcript.\n\nThe video begins with Detective Faulkner confirming that it was Middleton who\n\ninitiated the interview. Middleton informs Faulkner during the interview that he\n\nhad been to first appearance that morning and was told not to talk to anyone.\n\nFaulkner told him that they could not speak unless he specifically decided to speak\n\nwithout his attorney being present. Faulkner repeatedly asked Middleton if he was\n\n\n                                        - 53 -\n\fsure that he wanted to talk without his attorney present; Middleton responded that\n\nhe did. Faulkner read Middleton his Miranda rights again. Middleton again\n\nwaived his right to remain silent. Middleton insisted on speaking with Faulkner to\n\nclear his head and get past what happened. Thereafter, Middleton confessed to the\n\nmurder of the victim and the theft of her television.\n\n      When Detective Maerki entered the room, he inquired whether Middleton\n\nhad been to first appearance, to which Middleton replied that he had. He also\n\ninquired whether Middleton had requested to speak to him and Faulkner, to which\n\nMiddleton also replied in the affirmative. Throughout the entire interview,\n\nMiddleton repeatedly offered information, stating that he wanted everything to be\n\nover with because the murder that he committed was out of character; he resisted\n\nthe offer to have counsel present, and he agreed to assist in the investigation.\n\n      It is clear from the record that Middleton initiated contact with Detective\n\nFaulkner, rendering his subsequent interview valid under Edwards v. Arizona.\n\nAdditionally, the requirements of Traylor have been met in this case where the\n\ndetectives immediately stopped the interview at Middleton’s request, and only\n\nresumed their conversation with him on his prompting. The trial court properly\n\ndenied the defendant’s motion to suppress the videotaped confession.\n\n                          H. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 54 -\n\f       Middleton argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal, claiming that the State failed to present sufficient evidence\n\nto support Middleton’s convictions for first-degree premeditated murder and first-\n\ndegree felony murder. After the State rested in the guilt phase, the defense moved\n\nfor a judgment of acquittal, claiming that the State had not proven that the murder\n\nwas premeditated in nature, only that it was committed during a robbery. The\n\nState responded by pointing out that Middleton stabbed the victim thirty-five\n\ntimes. The trial court denied the motion finding the threshold for submission of the\n\ncase to the jury had been surpassed because of the totality of the evidence,\n\nincluding DNA evidence, blood spatter evidence, the number of stab wounds, the\n\nnature of the wounds, and Middleton’s arming of himself prior to going to the\n\nvictim’s trailer.\n\n       The defense also moved for a judgment of acquittal as to the burglary count,\n\nclaiming that Middleton was invited into the trailer and stating that the State did\n\nnot prove that Middleton intended to commit the theft of the television before he\n\nentered the trailer. The State responded that Middleton said the victim told him to\n\nleave and attempted to remove him from the trailer, thus withdrawing any consent\n\nto enter that was initially given. The State also argued that it did not have to prove\n\nintent to commit theft because it could proceed on the theory that the defendant\n\nremained in the home with the intent to commit murder, which he ultimately\n\n\n                                        - 55 -\n\fcommitted. The trial court denied the motion for acquittal on these grounds. The\n\ndefense then notified the court that, based on the court’s decision on the motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal on the burglary charge, the defense had no argument as to the\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal on felony murder, which was predicated on the\n\nburglary. We affirm the denial of the defendant’s motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal.\n\n      The evidence in a capital case is judged to be sufficient when it is both\n\ncompetent and substantial.

The defendant went to his\n\nneighbor’s trailer armed with a knife. When she would not give him money and\n\nattempted to get him out of her trailer, the defendant attacked her with the knife.\n\nThe medical examiner testified that the forensic evidence indicated a struggle\n\nbetween the victim and the defendant that began in the kitchen, and that drag\n\nmarks indicated that the victim was alive and moving erratically as she was\n\ndragged from the kitchen area to the bedroom. The medical examiner also said\n\nthere were several passes of a sharp instrument to create the margin of the wound,\n\n\n\n                                        - 57 -\n\fsuch as a sawing motion. The blood stains indicated that her carotid artery was not\n\ncut until she got into the bedroom. The amount and pattern of blood on the\n\nvictim’s waistband indicates that she may have been sitting up slightly or halfway\n\nwhen she received the neck injury. The victim’s shirt was pulled upwards toward\n\nher neck, which is consistent with being dragged. The victim had a bruise on her\n\ncheek that was consistent with the tread and design of Middleton’s boots. The\n\nvictim had bruises and a cut to her face, a puncture and stab wounds on her chest,\n\nneck, ear, and arms. The victim had defensive wounds that indicated that she was\n\ntrying to get away from someone who had a knife. The autopsy revealed that the\n\nneck injury occurred toward the end of the attack. There was sufficient evidence\n\nthat the defendant committed the homicide with a premeditated design to effect the\n\ndeath of Mrs. Christensen. See Hall, 107 So. 3d at 281.\n\n      There is also sufficient evidence of felony murder. In Bradley v.

Id. at 683. In this case, Middleton\n\nexplained that he and Wade Fowler had been discussing the crime for a few days\n\nbecause they were experiencing “hard times.” Middleton asked the victim to loan\n\nhim money, but she said she did not have any money because she paid the bills.\n\n\n                                       - 58 -\n\fHe stated the victim got scared and tried to push him out of her trailer. Middleton\n\npulled out the knife he brought with him, and the attack ensued. Thereafter,\n\nMiddleton took the victim’s television, which he later sold for $200. Under these\n\nfacts, even if the victim invited Middleton into her kitchen, as he claimed, that\n\nconsent was clearly revoked when the victim attempted to get Middleton out of her\n\nhome, and when she struggled with him down the hallway before he ultimately cut\n\nher throat in the bedroom.\n\n                 I. Section 921.141(5)(i), Florida Statutes (2009)\n\n      Middleton claims that the CCP aggravator is unconstitutionally vague and\n\noverbroad, is incapable of a constitutionally narrow construction and has been and\n\nis being applied in an arbitrary and inconsistent manner. He also claims that the\n\nstandard jury instruction administered in this case did not require that the State\n\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt an intent to kill before the crime began, and is\n\ntherefore unconstitutional. We deny relief as this Court has on numerous\n\noccasions upheld the constitutionality of this aggravating factor and the standard\n\njury instruction against similar claims. See, e.g., McWatters v.

Section 921.141 (5)(d), Florida Statutes (2009)\n\n      Middleton argues that the felony murder aggravator is facially\n\nunconstitutional because (1) it does not genuinely narrow the class of persons\n\neligible for the death penalty, and (2) it does not reasonably justify the imposition\n\nof a more severe sentence compared to others found guilty of murder. As support\n\nfor his argument, Middleton cites the decisions of three other state supreme courts\n\nthat have declared this aggravator to be improper, and urges this Court to follow\n\nthose courts, and do the same.

We further held that\n\na unanimous jury recommendation is necessary for the imposition of death and\n\ndetermined that Hurst error is capable of harmless error review. Id. at 68.\n\n      We reject Middleton’s argument that he is entitled to a life sentence under\n\nsection 775.082(2), Florida Statutes (2012). See Hurst, 202 So. 3d at 63-66. Thus,\n\nthe issue before us is whether any Hurst error during Middleton’s penalty phase\n\nproceedings was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. This Court has determined\n\nthat Hurst error is evaluated by the following harmless error standard:\n\n      Where the error concerns sentencing, the error is harmless only if\n      there is no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the\n      sentence. See, e.g., Zack v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1832505\"><a href=\"/opinion/1832505/zack-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">753</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 (Fla. 2000).\n      Although the harmless error test applies to both constitutional errors\n      and errors not based on constitutional grounds, “the harmless error\n      test is to be rigorously applied,” [State v.] DiGuilio, 491 So. 2d\n      [1129,] 1137 [Fla. 1986], and the State bears an extremely heavy\n      burden in cases involving constitutional error. Therefore, in the\n      context of a Hurst v. Florida error, the burden is on the State, as the\n      beneficiary of the error, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n      jury’s failure to unanimously find all the facts necessary for\n      imposition of the death penalty did not contribute to Hurst’s death\n      sentence in this case. We reiterate:\n\n             The test is not a sufficiency-of-the-evidence, a correct\n             result, a not clearly wrong, a substantial evidence, a more\n             probable than not, a clear and convincing, or even an\n             overwhelming evidence test. Harmless error is not a\n             device for the appellate court to substitute itself for the\n             trier-of-fact by simply weighing the evidence. The focus\n             is on the effect of the error on the trier-of-fact.\n\n      DiGuilio, 491 So. 2d at 1139. “The question is whether there is a\n      reasonable possibility that the error affected the [sentence].” Id.\n\n                                       - 62 -\n\fId. at 68 (last alteration in original). For the error to be harmless, this Court must\n\ndetermine that a rational jury would have unanimously found that there were\n\nsufficient aggravating factors that outweighed the mitigating circumstances.\n\n      We emphasize the unanimous jury recommendation of death in this case.\n\nThis unanimous recommendation allows us to determine that, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, a rational jury would have unanimously found that sufficient aggravating\n\nfactors outweighed the mitigation. See Davis v. State, 41 Fla. L. Weekly S528,\n\nS539-40 (Fla. Nov. 10, 2016). Jurors in Middleton’s case heard standard jury\n\ninstructions informing them that they were to determine sufficient aggravators\n\nexisted and that aggravation outweighed mitigation before recommending death.\n\nSee Fla. Std. Jury Instr. (Crim.) 7.11. Jurors were presented with mitigation and\n\ninformed that they could consider mitigating circumstances of which they were\n\nreasonably convinced.\n\n      Although the jurors were not informed that they were required to find\n\nunanimously that sufficient aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigation,\n\nthe jury did recommend death unanimously in this case. We conclude that the jury\n\nwould have unanimously made the findings necessary to impose death. See Davis,\n\n41 Fla. L. Weekly at S539-40. The extreme aggravation in this case further\n\nbolsters our determination that any Hurst error is harmless beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt: the trial court found both HAC and during the commission of a burglary\n\n                                         - 63 -\n\faggravators supported by competent, substantial evidence. These are among the\n\nmost serious aggravating factors.\n\n      We find that the State can sustain its burden of showing that any Hurst error\n\nin this case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Although the jury in this\n\ncase was informed that it was not required to recommend death unanimously, it did\n\nso. The unanimous recommendation of death in this case is the sort of\n\nrecommendation we have determined is constitutionally sufficient to impose a\n\nsentence of death. Cf. Davis, 41 Fla. L. Weekly at S539-40. Based on the\n\nforegoing, Middleton is not entitled to a new penalty phase.\n\n                            III. CONCLUSION\n\n      For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm Middleton’s conviction for\n\nfirst-degree murder and his death sentence.\n\n      It is so ordered.\n\nLABARGA, C.J., and PARIENTE, and LEWIS, JJ., concur.\nPARIENTE, J., concurs with an opinion, in which LABARGA, C.J., concurs.\nCANADY and POLSTON, JJ., concur in result.\nQUINCE, J., concurs in part and dissents in part with an opinion.\nLAWSON, J., did not participate.\n\nNOT FINAL UNTIL TIME EXPIRES TO FILE REHEARING MOTION, AND\nIF FILED, DETERMINED.\n\nPARIENTE, J., concurring.\n\n      I join the Court’s opinion, which affirms Middleton’s conviction and death\n\nsentence.

The investigation into mitigation can be\n\n\n\n       9. The prosecutor’s sarcastic comments reflect not only a misunderstanding\nof the effect of early childhood traumas on brain development but also highlight\nthe tendency of some prosecutors to degrade mitigation.

The difference between a thorough assessment of\n\nmitigation and a cursory one could, quite literally, be a matter of life and death.\n\nWhen funding is properly requested, the defense team should receive the assistance\n\nof both a fact investigator and a mitigation specialist to ensure a complete and\n\nreliable mitigation investigation.\n\n      There is an “apparent widespread use of mitigation specialists or\n\ncoordinators” in Florida, as the First District Court of Appeal has explained when\n\nquashing a trial court order denying a defendant’s motion for additional mitigation\n\ncoordinator fees.

ABA Guidelines,\n\n31 Hofstra L. Rev. at 919. At the hearing on the motion to appoint a mitigation\n\nspecialist in this case, the defense counsel urged the trial court to consider the ABA\n\nGuidelines, by explaining that these Guidelines “include[] a suggestion, if not a\n\nmandatory requirement, that a mitigation specialist . . . should be appointed in\n\ndeath cases because of the nature of the crime and because of the serious nature of\n\nthe potential penalty.” The prosecutor’s misguided response was, “I could care\n\nless about what they [the ABA] think about the death penalty and how it operates\n\nin the State of Florida.”\n\n      Contrary to the opinion of the prosecutor in this case, the ABA Guidelines\n\ndo have relevance to capital cases, even if these guidelines are not binding in\n\n\n\n       11. Since at least 2011, mitigation specialists have been recognized as a part\nof capital cases, when the General Appropriations Act of 2011 set the maximum\nhourly rate for mitigation specialists at $75. See ch. 2011-69, § 4, at 126, Laws of\nFla; see also § 27.425, Fla. Stat. (indicating that the rate specified annually in the\nGeneral Appropriations Act is the maximum compensation rate in cases in which\nthe court has appointed private counsel or declared a person indigent for costs).\n\n\n                                          - 67 -\n\fdetermining whether counsel rendered ineffective assistance. The United States\n\nSupreme Court has referred to the various renditions of these guidelines as “guides\n\nto determining what is reasonable” for an attorney’s performance, or as reflecting\n\n“well-defined norms” for attorney conduct. Rompilla v. Beard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799980\"><a href=\"/opinion/799980/rompilla-v-beard/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 387\n\n& n.7 (2005); Wiggins v.

This Court has also\n\nrelied upon these guidelines in determining whether trial counsel has adequately\n\ninvestigated mitigation evidence. See, e.g., Parker v.

Not only do\n\nmitigation specialists have honed skills in gathering and understanding the nature\n\nof potential mitigation evidence, such as the significance of early childhood\n\n\n                                        - 68 -\n\ftrauma, but mitigation specialists—unlike the defendant’s lawyer—can testify in\n\nthe penalty phase to impart the results of their mitigation investigation to the jury\n\nthat must weigh the mitigation and aggravation in determining whether to\n\nrecommend the death sentence.\n\n      As opposed to fact investigators, mitigation specialists “are generally trained\n\nin the social sciences, with college degrees in social work or psychology,” and “are\n\nadept at gathering institutional records, interviewing lay and professional people,\n\nand compiling case histories.” Hon. Helen G. Berrigan, The Indispensable Role of\n\nthe Mitigation Specialist in a Capital Case: A View From the Federal Bench, 36\n\nHofstra L.

Part of the mitigation specialist’s job is to “conduct a\n\ncomprehensive life history investigation of the client and identify all relevant\n\nmitigation issues.” Richard G.

They have the clinical skills to\n      recognize such things as congenital, mental or neurological\n      conditions, to understand how these conditions may have affected the\n      defendant’s development and behavior, and to identify the most\n      appropriate experts to examine the defendant or testify on his behalf.\n      Moreover, they may be critical to assuring that the client obtains\n      therapeutic services that render him cognitively and emotionally\n      competent to make sound decisions concerning his case.\n      . . . The mitigation specialist compiles a comprehensive and well-\n      documented psycho-social history of the client based on an exhaustive\n      investigation; analyzes the significance of the information in terms of\n      impact on development, including effect on personality and behavior;\n      finds mitigating themes in the client’s life history; identifies the need\n      for expert assistance; assists in locating appropriate experts; provides\n      social history information to experts to enable them to conduct\n      competent and reliable evaluations; and works with the defense team\n      and experts to develop a comprehensive and cohesive case in\n      mitigation.\n             The mitigation specialist often plays an important role as well\n      in maintaining close contact with the client and his family while the\n      case is pending. The rapport developed in this process can be the key\n      to persuading a client to accept a plea to a sentence less than death.\n\nABA Guidelines, Commentary to Guideline 4.1, 31 Hofstra L. Rev. at 959-60\n\n(footnotes omitted); see also ABA Supplementary Guidelines for the Mitigation\n\nFunction of Defense Teams in Death Penalty Cases (2008), reprinted in 36 Hofstra\n\nL.
