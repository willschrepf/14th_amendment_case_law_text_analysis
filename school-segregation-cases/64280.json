Ct. No. BA213120\n____________________________________)\n\n\n        A jury convicted defendant Angelina Rodriguez of the first degree murder\nof her husband, Jose Francisco Rodriguez, under the special circumstances of\nmurder by administering poison and murder for financial gain, and of one count of\nattempting to dissuade a witness. (Pen. Code, §§ 136.1, subd. (a)(2), 187, 190.2,\nsubd. (a)(1), (19).)1 The jury was unable to reach a verdict on a charge of\nsoliciting murder, and the court declared a mistrial on that count. After a penalty\ntrial, at which the prosecution presented evidence that defendant had murdered her\ninfant daughter several years previously, the jury returned a verdict of death. The\ncourt denied the automatic motion to modify the verdict and imposed that\nsentence. This appeal is automatic. (§ 1239, subd. (b).) We affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise\nindicated.\n\f                                   I. THE FACTS\n\n       A. Guilt Phase\n\n           1. Overview\n       The evidence showed that in September 2000, on her second attempt,\ndefendant fatally poisoned her husband, Jose Francisco Rodriguez, by giving him\ndrinks containing oleander and antifreeze in order to collect on a life insurance\npolicy she had insisted the two take out a few months earlier. Previously, she had\ntried to kill him by loosening natural gas valves in their garage. From her jail cell\nwhile awaiting trial for the murder, she attempted to dissuade a witness from\ntestifying against her. Evidence was also presented that later she solicited that\nwitness’s murder.\n\n           2. The Events Leading to the Victim’s Death\n       Defendant met her future husband, known as “Frank,” in February 2000,\nwhile they were employed at Angel Gate Academy (Academy) in San Luis\nObispo.2 The Academy was a partnership program of the California National\nGuard and the Los Angeles Unified School District which hosted district students\nat a camp for a month. Defendant described the Academy to police investigators\nas a “four week boot type camp for troubled youth.”\n       Frank and defendant were married on April 8. Shortly after the wedding,\nFrank got a job teaching in the Los Angeles Unified School District, and they\nmoved to Montebello. Defendant’s then nine-year-old daughter by a previous\nmarriage, Autumn F. (Autumn), lived with them.\n\n\n\n2      Because defendant and the victim have the same last name, we will refer to\nthe victim as Frank to avoid confusion. Unless otherwise indicated, all dates are in\nthe year 2000.\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f       In July, defendant and Frank took out a $250,000 life insurance policy on\nFrank’s life from the Midland National Life Insurance Company. Defendant was\nnamed the primary beneficiary. Mickey Marracino, the agent who sold them the\npolicy, testified that defendant had written to him in response to a direct mailing\nadvertisement. He then called her to make an appointment to see them.\nMarracino met the couple at their home on July 15. Marracino heard Frank ask\ndefendant “why she felt that they needed the insurance” in light of the fact that\nthey were already covered at work and through the National Guard. Defendant\nexplained to Frank the benefits of life insurance and why she felt they needed it.\nFrank still hesitated, but then told Marracino to “write it up.” Frank took the\nnecessary physical examination on July 18, and the policy was approved on July\n26. Frank and defendant also discussed insuring defendant’s life for $50,000, but\nthat policy was never finalized.\n       Palmira Gorham, a friend of defendant’s during this time, testified that after\nthe marriage, defendant often visited her in Paso Robles without Frank and\nexpressed unhappiness with her marriage. Sometime around mid-June or mid-\nJuly, Gorham and defendant had a conversation at Gorham’s home in which\ndefendant “was telling me how unhappy she was with Frank.” Gorham said\njokingly, “Why don’t you divorce this one like you divorced all your other ones?”\nDefendant responded, “No, this one has got [a] life insurance policy,” and “[t]hat\nmight be worth my time to do that.” She said something like, “If I were to kill\nhim, at least I’d end up with a little bit of money.” Later, Gorham’s mother joined\nthe conversation, and the two told defendant a story about a woman who had tried\nto kill her husband by giving him “oleander tea.” Gorham did not take the\nconversation seriously.\n       A day or so after this conversation, Gorham and her boyfriend spoke with\ndefendant about a dog that had bitten Gorham’s son and Gorham’s frustration with\n\n                                          3\n\fthe police response. At one point, the boyfriend commented that “we could just\nsoak some hot dogs in antifreeze and throw it over the fence.” When defendant\nasked why, Gorham told her “that we had seen something on TV that antifreeze\nhas like kind of a sweet taste and it’s really colorful, so it’s like bright pink or\ngreen, . . . and that children and animals, they would drink it without thinking\ntwice.”\n       A couple of weeks later, when defendant was at her home in Montebello,\nGorham spoke with her on the telephone. Gorham heard a blender running in the\nbackground and asked what defendant was doing. Defendant responded that “she\nwas making Frank a special milkshake.” In the past, defendant had told Gorham\nthat Frank liked to have milkshakes when he was ill. So Gorham asked defendant\nif Frank was sick. She responded, “Not yet.”\n       Loran Moranes was Gorham’s nephew, although he was older than she. He\ngot out of jail on July 17 and began a relationship with defendant that became\nsexual on August 26. Defendant visited him regularly in Paso Robles, beginning\nwhile Frank was still alive. Moranes testified that about a week before Frank died,\ndefendant was with him in Paso Robles. She told Moranes that she had “left some\nkind of gas on in the garage” in Montebello so that Frank “would die.” She said\nthat “either there would be some kind of explosion in the house or he would go in\nthere and pass out.”\n       Because he did not want to get involved, Moranes did not tell investigators\nabout this conversation until July 2001, long after defendant’s arrest. When the\ninvestigators heard of this, they checked records from Southern California Gas\nCompany, the company that serviced defendant’s home. The records showed that\non September 3, the Sunday of Labor Day weekend, Frank had reported a gas leak\nat his and defendant’s Montebello home. Luis Aguilar, a company service\ntechnician, responded to the report and spoke with Frank. Aguilar found two gas\n\n                                            4\n\fleaks in the garage, one behind the clothes dryer and one on the water heater. The\nvalve fitting on the dryer was “very loose,” which would not have happened on its\nown.\n       On Tuesday, September 5, the day after Labor Day, Frank traveled by bus\nto Angel Gate Academy as chaperone for students from his school who were to\nparticipate in the program there. After dropping the students off at the Academy,\nFrank returned home the same day. He had been a late addition to the group of\nteachers who accompanied the students, and his name was not placed on the list of\nteachers who were coming that was given to employees at the Academy.\n       On Thursday, September 7, Frank, accompanied by defendant, went to the\nemergency room at Kaiser Hospital in Baldwin Park complaining of vomiting and\ndiarrhea. The treating physician diagnosed the cause as food poisoning.\nDefendant voiced no suspicion that Frank had been intentionally poisoned. The\ndoctor discharged Frank that afternoon. When he did so, he wrote on a standard\ninstruction sheet that Frank should drink a lot of fluids and, specifically, “drink\nGatorade as a re-hydration.” Defendant signed the instructions, indicating that she\nhad received them.\n\n           3. The Victim’s Death and Aftermath\n       At 3:19 a.m. on Saturday, September 9, Montebello Police Officer Stephen\nSharpe, responding to a call from defendant’s home at 837 Marconi Street, found\nFrank’s body lying facedown on the carpet in the bedroom. He observed blood on\nthe carpet that apparently came from the victim’s nose but could detect no\napparent cause of death. Defendant identified the man as her husband. Officer\nSharpe testified that defendant’s crying “seemed rehearsed or kind of forced”;\n“[a]lthough it was audible, the crying noise, there was a lack of tears, and as soon\nas I would talk to her, ask her a question, she would immediately kind of snap out\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fof it and answer the questions real quick, and in my experience . . . usually\nsomeone who just lost their husband, they’re very difficult to speak with and\ncommunicate to.”\n       The initial autopsy did not reveal the cause of death. The body contained\nno sign of trauma. Frank was 41 years old when he died and had been in generally\ngood health.\n       At 10:17 a.m., the morning Frank died, defendant called Marracino, the life\ninsurance agent, and left a message for him to call her back. When he returned her\ncall a short time later, she reported her husband’s death and inquired about getting\nthe $250,000 payment on the policy on Frank’s life. Marracino informed her that\nthe company would need an official death certificate showing the cause of death.\nHe also explained that when the death occurs during the first two years after the\npolicy was issued, the company will investigate the claim to determine if it is\nlegitimate. During the conversation, Marracino noticed that defendant spoke\nwithout emotion. “It was sort of matter of fact the way she was talking to me and\nexplaining everything. She didn’t cry, she didn’t hesitate in any way, she didn’t\nlose any train of thought . . . .”\n       Marracino reported Frank’s death to the insurance company the same day.\nHe had several other conversations with defendant over the next few weeks in\nwhich she repeatedly asked when she would get paid. He kept advising her the\ncompany needed a cause of death.\n       Rebecca Perkins, Frank’s sister, who lived in Florida, learned of Frank’s\ndeath from her mother, Janet Baker. Around noon the day of his death (9:00 a.m.\nCalifornia time), she telephoned defendant and asked what had happened.\nDefendant responded, “He drank too much.” Perkins was surprised because Frank\ndid not drink alcohol. Defendant went on to say that Frank had been sick on\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fWednesday and Thursday, and she took him to the hospital on Friday. She said\nFrank had died of a “stomach infection.”\n       A short time after this conversation, Perkins called defendant again. This\ntime, defendant told her that “the people at the Angel Gate Academy gave him\ncookies and Gatorade and that killed him.” She also said “that she thought it was\nthe people at Angel Gate this time who had killed him, and months ago in June\nthat it was the students at his middle school that had tried to poison him.”\nRegarding why someone at Angel Gate Academy would want to kill Frank,\ndefendant said “that she was terminated and she left on a bad note and therefore\nthey didn’t like Frank and so they wanted to kill him.” Perkins testified that\nduring both of these conversations, defendant “had no emotion.”\n       Frank’s other sister, Shirley Coers, spoke with defendant the day after his\ndeath. Defendant said she “wanted to cremate him and sprinkle his ashes on a\nbeach that she said was their favorite place to go.” Later defendant told her that\nFrank might have a military burial. In another conversation, defendant told Coers\nthat an officer at Angel Gate Academy had killed Frank when Frank had gone\nthere for a meeting. She said the officer “put some kind of poison in his cookies\nand Gatorade.” Coers asked defendant how someone could poison another person.\nDefendant said there are many ways; for example, one can make a tea with\noleander. On Tuesday, September 19, Coers drove with defendant and others in a\nlimousine to Frank’s funeral. On the way, defendant pointed at some bushes on\nthe side of the road and said, “That’s oleander.”\n       Elaine Nash, an employee with the Midland National Life Insurance\nCompany, spoke with defendant several times, beginning on September 28,\nregarding defendant’s efforts to collect the insurance money. Nash told defendant\nthe company needed a death certificate stating a cause of death, and it would take\nabout four to six weeks to process the claim after they received the certificate. She\n\n                                           7\n\falso explained that the company would conduct its own investigation because the\ndeath had occurred within two years of issuing the policy. Defendant told her the\nautopsy was being done but the toxicology had not been completed. Later,\ndefendant asked Nash to fax her the claim forms. Nash said she could not do so in\nthe case of a contested claim. Nash also declined defendant’s request to verify to a\nreal estate agent that the funds would be available so she could buy a house. The\ncompany never paid the insurance benefits.\n\n           4. The Investigation\n       Montebello Police Detective Gregory Wilsey was the original investigator\ninto Frank’s death. On September 11, the Monday after Frank died, he received a\ntelephone call from defendant asking about the coroner’s office and how it would\ndispose of the body. He told her that the coroner had not determined the cause of\ndeath, and any information they could receive regarding what Frank might have\ningested would help to narrow the possibilities. She told him that she believed\nsomeone at Angel Gate Academy in San Luis Obispo might have poisoned him.\nShe said that “earlier that year that they had . . . blown a whistle on somebody who\nhad committed — suspected of child abuse on one of the students or children up\nthere, and because of that some people got fired, some people got reassigned and\nshe felt that there was some animosity towards her husband over that.” She said\nFrank had gone to the Academy some days before his death to chaperone\ndisadvantaged youths who were going there. During this conversation, Detective\nWilsey was struck by defendant’s lack of emotion.\n       On September 14, the case was referred to the Los Angeles County\nSheriff’s Department and assigned to Detective Brian Steinwand and Sergeant Joe\nHolmes. Detective Steinwand testified that defendant had been a suspect in\nFrank’s death from the beginning, but they did not tell her that. They pretended to\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\fbelieve her story that someone at Angel Gate Academy had poisoned Frank in\norder to try to get her to talk and provide information. In fact, they never\nsuspected anyone at the Academy of poisoning Frank. Beginning on September\n14, the investigators had numerous conversations with defendant that they\nsurreptitiously tape-recorded. Relevant portions of several of the conversations\nwere played to the jury.\n       Defendant told the investigators she believed a man at Angel Gate\nAcademy named Charles “Chad” Holloway had poisoned Frank. She said that she\nand Frank had blown the whistle on Holloway for inappropriate behavior with\nsome of the students at the Academy. She said that on September 5, Frank had\ngone to the Academy as a chaperone. When he returned home, he told her that\nsomeone there had given him Gatorade and cookies. Defendant also talked about\nthe life insurance policy and said that the company would not pay the claim until it\nhad been advised of the cause of death. She asked if the investigators could help\nget the coroner’s office to do what was necessary to determine a cause of death so\nshe could receive the money.\n       On September 26, Janet Baker, Frank’s mother, informed Sergeant Holmes\nthat defendant had said something about oleander. This was the first mention of\noleander as a possible poison in the case. Detective Steinwand informed the\ncoroner’s office of the possibility of oleander poisoning. However, no test for\noleander was conducted at that time, apparently because very few laboratories can\nperform such a test. A large oleander bush, easily accessible to defendant, grew\nover the fence in the backyard of her Montebello home.\n       During this time, defendant frequently asked the investigators about efforts\nto determine a cause of death because she wanted to collect the insurance money.\nThe investigators explained that the coroner’s office had been unable to determine\nthe cause of death, and that they needed to know what to look for as a possible\n\n                                          9\n\fpoison. As a ruse, they stressed that it would be very useful to know what the\npoison might have been.\n       On October 19, before 9:00 a.m., while driving, Sergeant Holmes received\na call on his cell phone from defendant’s cell phone. Defendant told him she had\njust received a telephone call. (Telephone records later showed that, in fact,\ndefendant had not received any incoming telephone call on her cell phone that\nmorning, before she called Sergeant Holmes.) Sergeant Holmes told her he would\ncall her back. He did so when he returned to his office so he could record the\nconversation. Defendant told him that shortly after 8:00 a.m. that morning, she\nhad received a telephone call while she was driving from a man who refused to\ngive his name. She said the “caller ID” was blocked. The man told her he had\ntalked with Holloway. Holloway had told him, “they can’t pin me.” The man also\nsaid, “Ask them about antifreeze.” Defendant did not know how the man had\ngotten her cell phone number.\n       This was the investigators’ first information that antifreeze might have been\ninvolved. After this conversation, Sergeant Holmes asked the coroner’s office to\ncheck for antifreeze as a possible poison.\n       Dan Anderson, a toxicologist with the Los Angeles County coroner’s\noffice, testified that the results of the initial tests on Frank’s body had been\nnegative except for the presence of Vicodin. That created a problem, because\nwhen checking for the presence of drugs, one must look for something specific.\nThere is no general toxicology test for everything. If a test for the most common\ndrugs is negative, trying to determine what might be present is like “looking for a\nneedle in a haystack.” For example, one must look specifically for ethylene\nglycol, the main chemical component of automotive antifreeze, in order to find it.\n       After defendant mentioned antifreeze to the investigators, specimens from\nFrank’s body were examined for ethylene glycol. All samples showed the\n\n                                           10\n\fpresence of a fatal amount of that chemical. Later testing also showed the\npresence of oleander.\n       Dr. Richard Clark, a toxicologist with the poison center at the University of\nCalifornia, San Diego, testified that ethylene glycol is poisonous but tends to taste\nsweet and can easily be mixed with Gatorade. Oleander, commonly found along\nSouthern California freeways, is also poisonous. It can be served as a tea and\nmixed with another liquid to disguise its bitter taste.\n       After examining documents in the case, Dr. Clark opined that Frank had\ndied of ethylene glycol poisoning. Specimens from his body contained five and\nsix times as much of the chemical as is needed to kill. Frank would have had to\nreceive the fatal dose within 24 hours before his death and “most likely” within six\nto seven hours. After reviewing records from Frank’s September 7 visit to the\nhospital, Dr. Clark opined that Frank could not have had in his system at that time\nthe ethylene glycol that his body later contained. Frank’s symptoms at that visit\nwere consistent with oleander poisoning. Dr. Clark testified it is “hard to say”\nwhat role the oleander played in Frank’s death, although it could have “played a\npart.” Frank must have last ingested oleander within 24 hours before his death.\n       Dr. Ogbonna Chinwah, who had performed the original inconclusive\nautopsy, testified that he later reexamined the body and found evidence of\nethylene glycol in the kidneys. In his opinion, Frank died of ethylene glycol and\noleander poisoning.\n       On December 12, Detective Steinwand told defendant that he was going to\nquestion Holloway about the case. He did in fact speak with Holloway, but only\nto obtain his cooperation and not as a suspect. He arranged for Holloway to\ntelephone defendant with the investigators surreptitiously listening. The next day,\nDecember 13, Holloway called her. Acting pursuant to instructions, Holloway\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\fasked her why she had told the “police that I poisoned Frank with antifreeze.”\nDefendant replied that he needed to talk with the investigators.\n         About one minute after this conversation ended, Sergeant Holmes received\na “911 page” (meaning important) from defendant. He called her back. She told\nhim she had just received a call from Holloway in which he said, “Well, they’ll\nnever be able to — to catch me anyway,” and “You better watch you [sic] back.”\nIn fact, Holloway had said nothing like that to her. Recordings of both December\n13 conversations were played to the jury.\n         In December, the investigators informed defendant of the results of the\nantifreeze testing. In various conversations, defendant asked the status of the\ninvestigation regarding Holloway. As a ruse, the investigators told her that one\nweakness in their case against Holloway was the lack of evidence that Holloway\nhad known in advance that Frank would be coming to Angel Gate Academy on\nSeptember 5. Poisoning requires advance planning, they explained, and Holloway\ncould defend against a poisoning charge by claiming he had not known Frank\nwould be there that day. They stressed that it was important for them to obtain\nevidence that Holloway had received information in advance that Frank would be\nthere.\n         On January 19, 2001, Sergeant Holmes told defendant that oleander had\nbeen found in Frank’s body, and that the cause of death and death certificate\nwould be ready in a few weeks. Defendant asked if they had yet received any\nevidence that Holloway had known in advance that Frank was coming to Angel\nGate Academy on September 5. He told her they had not. She told him that when\nshe worked “at admin,” she always received a fax saying who was coming.\n         On February 5, 2001, Sergeant Holmes received an anonymous fax\naddressed to him at the homicide bureau. It contained no cover sheet and\nindicated it had been sent from Staples Store No. 702. On the first page was\n\n                                          12\n\fwritten, “Urgent. Detective Holmes, I mailed this to you. Why is Chad still free?\nThought maybe you did not get it. Here it is again.” The name “Chad” obviously\nreferred to Holloway. The next two pages appeared to be a printed document\nconcerning a faculty orientation at Angel Gate Academy. On the second of these\npages was the handwritten name “F. Rodriguez.”\n       Later, Sergeant Holmes received in the mail at work an envelope containing\na copy of the same document he had received by fax on February 5, 2001, and a\nnote stating, “I found this in second platoon’s locker, in Sergeant Holloway’s\npapers. I figured this is how he knew Sergeant Rodriguez was coming to SLO\n[San Luis Obispo]. I hope this helps fry the bastard.”\n       On February 6, 2001, the investigators drove to Paso Robles, where\ndefendant had moved after Frank’s death, intending to arrest her. While driving,\nthey received a page from her. Sergeant Holmes called her back. He told her\nabout the fax he had received and said it was important for them to know who had\nsent it. She said she knew nothing about it. She also asked whether they were\ngoing to arrest Holloway. She added that she would like to be present when they\ndid, “to see the expression on his face.”\n       After defendant’s arrest, the investigators searched her Paso Robles home\npursuant to a search warrant. They found in her purse a piece of paper containing\nnumbers and computations, apparently calculations regarding how she would\nspend the insurance money plus accumulated interest that she expected to receive,\nand a napkin on which was written the sheriff’s fax number, the number to which\nthe anonymous fax received by Sergeant Holmes had been sent.\n       The purse also contained a fax confirmation sheet from Staples Store No.\n702 and the original of the fax Sergeant Holmes had received on February 5, 2001.\nOn this original copy, however, the handwritten name “F. Rodriguez” was in red.\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\fA forensic document examiner testified that this name was written in original red\nink and was not a copy from some other document.\n       The Los Angeles school administrator who coordinated the Angel Gate\nAcademy program testified that normally the school district would not provide the\nAcademy with the names of teachers who merely accompanied the students to San\nLuis Obispo and returned the same day. She said the printed document in the fax\nSergeant Holmes had received concerned a session that started on September 5. It\ncontained the names of the teachers who would stay there but not of those who\njust rode the bus. The printed document would not normally contain a handwritten\nname like the one on the fax.\n\n           5. Defendant’s Arrest and Later Events\n       Detective Steinwand and Sergeant Holmes arrested defendant for Frank’s\nmurder on February 7, 2001.\n       Evidence, including a tape-recorded telephone call that defendant made to\nGorham on March 27, 2001, showed that, while in jail awaiting trial, defendant\ntried to dissuade Gorham from testifying against her. In the recorded\nconversation, defendant told Gorham that, based on what Gorham had told the\ninvestigators, she could be considered an accomplice in the case. She suggested\nthat Gorham might be arrested if she did not change her story. Gorham responded\nthat if she changed her story, “isn’t that just gonna make it look worse?”\nDefendant said that people “retract it all the time.” She said Gorham could say she\nhad “found me with Conrad” (Gorham’s boyfriend). She added, “That would be\nenough for you to snap.” She also said that “this is getting bigger than anybody\ncan imagine, and it doesn’t need to be. Do you see what I’m saying?” She\nreiterated that Gorham “knew what I was doing, and you didn’t stop me.” When\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fGorham noted that she had not been arrested, defendant said, “They’re still\ninvestigating,” and “They’re still asking a lot of people questions.”\n       Other evidence showed that in May 2002, while still in jail awaiting trial,\ndefendant tried to solicit fellow inmate Gwendolyn Hall to arrange Gorham’s\nmurder when Hall was released from jail. Defendant first offered to pay $20,000\nfor Gorham’s murder then increased the offer to $30,000.\n\n           6. Defense Evidence\n       Defendant cross-examined prosecution witnesses and, through stipulation,\npresented evidence regarding telephone calls between defendant’s home and\nGorham’s home during the Labor Day weekend of 2000. The apparent purpose of\nthe stipulations was to impeach parts of Loran Moranes’s testimony.\n\n       B. Penalty Phase\n\n           1. Prosecution Evidence\n       The prosecution presented evidence that defendant murdered her infant\ndaughter in 1993 and additional evidence that she solicited Gorham’s murder.\n\n               a. Death of Defendant’s Daughter\n       On September 18, 1993, defendant’s 13-month-old daughter Alicia F.\n(Autumn’s younger sister) choked to death on a pacifier manufactured by the\nGerber Products Company (Gerber) in her crib in the family’s home in Lompoc.\nDefendant’s husband at the time, Thomas F. (Thomas), Alicia’s father, was on a\nbusiness trip, and defendant was the only adult in the house when Alicia died.\n       Santa Barbara County Firefighter David Mandeville was the first to respond\nto an emergency call at defendant’s home just before noon that day. When he\narrived, defendant was waiting for him outside. Mandeville found this unusual\nbecause normally regarding calls “where a child or infant is choking, the parents\nare with the child.” Alicia was in her crib not responding. He found a piece of\n\n\n                                         15\n\fplastic in the baby’s throat and, with an effort, was able to “pop it out.” The\nplastic was the rubber nipple part of a pacifier. Mandeville unsuccessfully applied\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation to try to revive the baby. He turned the baby over\nto paramedics as soon as they arrived.\n       Deputy Sheriff Ralph Ginter responded shortly after Mandeville. He found\nthe plastic backing of the pacifier in the crib and the rubber nipple on the floor.\nHe accompanied defendant to the hospital. After defendant was told that her baby\nhad died, she asked to obtain the pacifier backing, saying “that she wanted to keep\nit, that the manufacturer or company that she purchased it from is going to pay,\nand she didn’t want this to happen to another child.” Deputy Ginter wrote in his\nreport at the time that defendant was “adamant” about wanting to obtain the\npacifier backing. He released it to her at the hospital.\n       Dr. Wallace Carroll, the pathologist who presided over the autopsy,\ntestified that Alicia died of “asphyxiation due to airway obstruction,” that is, she\nchoked to death. Alicia had two teeth — the two lower front teeth.\n       Two months before the baby died, defendant had insured the baby’s life for\n$50,000, and named herself as the primary beneficiary. Defendant did not name\nThomas as a beneficiary and did not tell him about the policy until after the baby\nhad died. On October 22, 1993, the insurance company paid the $50,000, plus\ninterest.\n       Thomas testified that in late 1992 or early 1993, while vacationing in\nMichigan, he and defendant were eating in a restaurant with their daughters.\nAnother customer noticed the pacifier in Alicia’s mouth and “said that she wanted\nto let us know that she was pretty sure that that pacifier was part of a recall.” In\nfact, in March 1993, Gerber had voluntarily recalled the pacifier on which Alicia\nchoked based on five consumer reports that it had separated into three pieces.\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\f       Shortly after Alicia died, Thomas and defendant consulted a local attorney\nabout suing Gerber. Ultimately, they retained Attorney Barry Novak to represent\nthem. Novak filed a lawsuit on their behalf against Gerber for Alicia’s wrongful\ndeath due to the failure of the company’s pacifier. He obtained the actual pacifier,\nwhich was in two pieces. Novak sent both pieces to Dr. Wolfgang Knauss, a\nprofessor at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), for examination.\nDissatisfied with Dr. Knauss’s report, he next sent the pieces to Dr. Gary Hamed,\na professor at The University of Akron, for a second opinion. The defendant in\nthe lawsuit, Gerber, never learned of Dr. Knauss’s opinion.\n       In March 1996, after defendant and Thomas had divorced, Gerber settled\nthe lawsuit by paying $710,000. Defendant received 60 percent and Thomas 40\npercent of what remained after deducting Novak’s fee and expenses. Defendant\nreceived more than Thomas because she had been present at Alicia’s death and\nsuffered emotional trauma.\n       When Detective Steinwand searched defendant’s home after her arrest, he\nfound a copy of Dr. Knauss’s report containing the results of his examination of\nthe pacifier. As a result of this discovery, Detective Steinwand investigated\nfurther into the circumstances of Alicia’s death.\n       Dr. Knauss testified as an expert regarding the “failure and fracture of\npolymers, which includes rubbers.” In 1994, Barry Novak asked him to examine\nthe two pieces. He did so and prepared a report containing his findings and\nopinion. At trial, Dr. Knauss described the two pieces he examined. “A pacifier is\ntypically made up of what one . . . calls the shield, which is the hard part that stays\nin front of the mouth. Then something some people refer to as the baglet or the\nnipple, which is in the baby’s mouth, and the nipple is characteristically out of a\nnatural clear looking rubber, and in this case the nipple part had broken off away\nfrom the hard part, the shield, close to the shield.” Specifically, the separated\n\n                                          17\n\fnipple had “broken off or torn off” from part of the nipple that remained attached\nto the shield. The distance from the shield to the point of the rupture, where the\nseparated nipple had torn away, was short, approximately two or three millimeters.\n       In Dr. Knauss’s opinion, the fracture he observed between the two pieces\ncould not have been caused either by a baby chewing through the pacifier or a\nbaby’s repeated sucking action. He based this opinion on the nature and pattern of\nthe tear, the amount of force necessary to cause it, and the fact the tear was near\nthe shield rather than on some part of the nipple a baby would actually touch.\nBased on his visual and microscopic examination of the pacifier, he believed that\n“some external trauma or tool was responsible for failing this nipple.” One\npossibility was “something rolling over this, some external agent that caused large\nforce in that region, that would be responsible for this kind of complex fracture\npattern.” He said, “it might happen when a chair or some hard object rolls over\nthe pacifier like this. That might be the cause.” A tool such as pliers could also\nhave caused the tear.\n       Dr. Knauss was aware that Dr. Hamed believed the nipple might have had\nan initial cut that a baby’s normal use could have exacerbated, causing the\nrubber’s complete separation. Dr. Knauss believed this was not possible due to\nthe large amount of force that would have been needed to cause the separation. In\nhis opinion, “the ultimate failure as it now appears and documented in these\nphotographs is not consistent with that scenario.”\n       The prosecution presented portions of defendant’s deposition testimony in\nthe lawsuit against Gerber. She testified that she had checked the pacifier when\nshe first received it to “ma[k]e sure there’s no cracks or evidence of wearing.”\nAbout once a week she tested the pacifier’s bulb by pulling on it.\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\f                b. Solicitation of Murder While in Jail\n       The prosecution played for the jury tapes of jail conversations between\ninmate Gwendolyn Hall and defendant on May 10 and 11, 2002, that were\nrecorded with Hall’s cooperation, in which defendant solicited Gorham’s murder.\n       In the May 10 conversation, defendant told Hall “they could do it one of\ntwo ways. They could do it robbery gone bad, or they can make it look like a\nboyfriend gone mad.” Defendant gave Hall the address of and directions to\nGorham’s home in Paso Robles. When Hall asked how she would be paid,\ndefendant responded that “this is one thing I’m trying to figure out, the best way\nto, you know to transport or transfer it because I don’t want it to look . . . all of a\nsudden 25 grand is out my account.” She said she was considering “taking a trip\nto Vegas” because “that would easily show why I would pull out that much —\nkind of money.” Defendant added that the “house is so old that if it blew up, from\na gas leak or something, it wouldn’t surprise anybody.” She also said that “for\nsomebody to go in and shoot them in the head while they’re sleeping would not\nbe . . . surprising.” A pillow could be used to “muffle[] the sound.” She said there\nis an alley behind the house they could use to get away. Hall and defendant\nagreed that when the job was finished Hall should send defendant a “little girl\ncard” signed “happy birfday, love, Cuz.” (The misspelling was intentional so the\nmessage would be clear.)\n       In the May 11 conversation, defendant asked Hall whether “these guys”\nwould be “bright enough” to figure out how to make it look like a suicide. She\ndiscussed other ways to kill Gorham, such as “doing an overdose,” using cyanide,\nor making a gunshot “look self-inflicted.” She suggested that Hall drive because\n“they need a brain.” “They’re going to have to have somebody to tell them go do\nthis.” She added, “It’s your investment. Put it that way. It’s your decision.”\nThey again discussed how Hall would be paid. Defendant also suggested they go\n\n\n                                           19\n\fto Gorham’s house in the morning and watch her leave to “take her kids to\nschool.” “This way when she comes back you know she’s by herself.”\n       Los Angeles Sheriff’s Detective Patrick Valdez, who was assigned to\ninvestigate this matter, had heard from Hall that defendant might also be soliciting\nothers to kill Gorham. Anxious to prevent Gorham’s murder, he decided to try to\nconvince defendant that the murder had been accomplished. On May 21, 2002, he\ninstructed Hall to tell defendant that she had found someone to “act as a\nmiddleman between the hit man and Hall.” He gave Hall the fictitious name of\n“Antonio Davis” as the middleman with a fictitious address. That same day,\ndefendant released $60 from her jail account to “Antonio Davis.”\n       At Detective Valdez’s direction, Detective Steinwand and another officer\ndrove to Paso Robles where, with Gorham’s cooperation, they took photographs of\nher apparently dead body with a fake gunshot wound in the head and fake blood.\nDetective Valdez also arranged to have Detective Jose Mejia, posing as Antonio\nDavis, the fictitious middleman, speak with defendant at the jail on June 8, 2002.\nThe approximately half-hour interview was videotaped and played to the jury.\n       In the jail conversation, defendant and Detective Mejia (posing as Antonio\nDavis) sat divided by a plexiglass window and spoke through a telephone. In\naddition to speaking with one another, they communicated by writing notes and\ndisplaying them through the window, something jail inmates often did because\nthey knew their conversations might be monitored. Defendant wrote separate\nnotes on a single sheet of paper that she folded so that only one note at a time\ncould be read.\n       Detective Mejia showed defendant two photographs of Gorham’s\napparently dead body. He then held up a note saying, “How do you want to take\ncare of it? These guys are asking about the money.” Defendant wrote a note back\nsaying, “I thought Gwen [obviously Gwendolyn Hall] stopped it.” Then she\n\n                                         20\n\fdisplayed a second note saying, “My star witness.” Later she wrote, “Best friend\nof 6 years.” Verbally defendant stated, “This is what I told her.” She then\ndisplayed a note saying, “When out as soon as insurance in —About 45 days I\ngive to Gwen.” Later, she verbally stated, “I think that’s about as long as it takes,”\nand displayed another note saying, “It’s up to how long insurance takes.”\nDefendant displayed another note saying, “I thought she was joking,” then showed\nagain the note saying, “My star witness.”\n       After the conversation, defendant was searched, and the piece of paper on\nwhich she had written the notes was seized. An address book containing Antonio\nDavis’s fictitious address was also found in her possession.\n\n           2. Defense Evidence\n       Defendant presented evidence of two kinds: (1) evidence intended to cast\ndoubt on whether she had murdered her daughter and (2) evidence in mitigation.\n       Dr. Gary Hamed testified as an expert on “fracture adhesion of rubbery\nmaterials, particularly a natural rubber.” In 1995 or 1996, he tested the two pieces\nof the pacifier in the wrongful death case at Attorney Novak’s request. In his\nopinion, the rubber would not have failed as it did if it had not already been\n“degraded in some way.” He believed that three of the baby’s forces could have\ncombined to cause the pacifier to fail completely: sucking, a clamping and\npulling, and the work of the teeth. Dr. Hamed disagreed with Dr. Knauss’s\ncontrary opinion.\n       Autumn, defendant’s daughter, testified, “I would like it for you [the jury]\nnot to execute [her mother] and make it so I can see her.”\n       Anita Rivera, defendant’s mother, and Gigiana Colaiacovo, her older sister,\ntestified about defendant’s unhappy life and family background. Colaiacovo\ntestified that her grandfather had sexually molested her. When she refused his\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\flater advances, it appeared he molested defendant instead. Colaiacovo said, “My\nsister is a good person.” Both witnesses asked the jury to spare defendant’s life so\nthey could continue to have a relationship with her.\n       A defense investigator testified about the defense’s failed efforts to\ninterview and obtain the cooperation of defendant’s father in New York.\n       Dr. William Vicary, a psychiatrist, testified about defendant’s mental state.\nTo prepare his evaluation, he interviewed several people, including defendant’s\nmother, sister, and cousin, and defendant herself. Defendant described to him\nsexual abuse she had suffered from various people, including her grandfather.\nBased on these interviews, Dr. Vicary believed defendant was a victim of sexual\nabuse, and that this abuse had had a major negative impact on her. He also\ntestified that he had found defendant “to be the most emotional and the most\nanimated when she was talking about her children. She said in all her life, none of\nher relationships had ever worked, and that she had only two happy experiences,\nthe birth of her two little girls.” History that her relatives supplied indicated that\n“defendant was a very attentive, loving, supportive mother.” In Dr. Vicary’s\nopinion, defendant “would be a model prisoner who would get along with the\nguards and the other prisoners in the institution.”\n                                   II. DISCUSSION\n\n       A. Pretrial Issues\n       Defendant raises several issues regarding primarily pretrial events.3\n\n\n\n\n3      As will be seen, even though these are primarily pretrial issues, some of the\nevents petitioner cites occurred during and after trial. For convenience, we will\nconsider all of the related facts and arguments together.\n\n\n\n                                           22\n\f           1. Factual Background\n       Defendant was arrested on February 7, 2001. On February 27, 2001, the\ncourt appointed the public defender to represent her. On April 17, 2001, the\nsuperior court issued orders terminating defendant’s telephone privileges in jail\nand ordering the sheriff’s department to monitor her visits. The order was based\non a declaration by Detective Steinwand providing information about defendant’s\nattempts to dissuade Gorham from testifying, including her tape-recorded call to\nGorham on March 27, 2001. On April 24, 2001, the court ordered the sheriff to\nallow defendant’s attorney to have face-to-face interviews with her and to play\ntapes of recorded conversations and interviews regarding the case. On April 26,\n2001, the court also ordered the sheriff to provide to defendant “a set of thermal\nunderwear which is to cover her upper and lower body, in order to help prevent\nfurther coughing and colds.”\n       On September 26, 2001, defendant retained Attorney M.R. Ward to\nrepresent her in place of the public defender.\n       Later defendant moved to lift the telephone restrictions. On December 14,\n2001, the eventual trial judge, the Honorable William R. Pounders (who was to\npreside over all further proceedings in the case), conducted a hearing on the\nmotion. Defendant said she was “seeking replacement counsel” and needed\ntelephone access. The prosecutor stated that, due to defendant’s “misuse of the\nphones in the past, she has been placed in a part of the Twin Towers jail facility\nwhere she has no access to telephones.” Defense counsel requested an order\npermitting defendant limited telephone access to her lawyer. The parties discussed\nwhether the sheriff’s department had the resources to permit defendant to call her\nlawyer while ensuring that she would not be able to use the telephone to speak\nwith others. While recognizing the need to prevent defendant from continuing to\ndissuade witnesses, the court stated, “I think the first choice though is, as you\n\n\n                                          23\n\f[defense counsel] said, to try to reestablish communication between defendant and\ncounsel.”\n       Defendant personally reiterated that she needed telephone privileges to find\na new attorney. The court responded, “It isn’t necessary right now, but again if\nyou think I’m going to be stupid enough to reestablish your ability to call\nwitnesses and threaten them, I’m not going to do that . . . . You do now have\ncounsel that — of your choice, and there are ways to arrange to have counsel\nrepresent you.” Defendant also complained about where she was being housed in\nthe jail. The court responded, “I’m going to let your attorney work out that, if\nthat’s a problem. I’m not in a position to tell the sheriff how to run the jail . . . .\nI’m not going to jump in here and at your word decide that I’m going to change\nyour housing and give you free access to the telephone.” The prosecutor offered\nto check with the sheriff’s department to see if it could permit defendant telephone\naccess to her attorney while ensuring she could not speak with others.\n       The court said it believed defendant had the right to call her attorney but\n“under whatever conditions we need to assure that there’s no third party switch.”\nThe court left it to the parties to “work that out.” In the meantime, the court\nsigned an order allowing defense counsel “to have face to face interviews with\n[defendant] and to play on a tape recorder, tapes of recorded conversations and\ninterviews pertaining to” the case.\n       On January 3, 2002, defendant wrote a letter to the court stating that she\nhad “removed” Ward as her attorney and had not yet obtained a new attorney, and\nasking the court to grant her “temporary telephone access” so she could find\nanother lawyer. The court conducted a hearing on January 16, 2002. At the\nhearing, Attorney Ward stated his understanding that defendant “was considering\nto seek other counsel.” But he also advised her “that I consider it my obligation to\ncontinue working on the case until I’m relieved.” He said there were matters\n\n                                           24\n\fconcerning witnesses “that I would definitely keep working on until such time that\nI feel that I’m terminated on the case.” Defendant reiterated that she wanted to\nlook for a new attorney. The court expressed willingness to allow defendant to\nchange attorneys if she wished. But it was reluctant to lift the telephone\nrestrictions due to concerns she would use the telephone to dissuade witnesses. It\nnoted that she was already charged with using the telephone to attempt to dissuade\na witness.\n       A jail official stated at the hearing that it was not reasonably feasible to\npermit defendant to call a particular person while ensuring she did not call\nsomeone else. He said, “there’s no way for us to set it up where . . . she wouldn’t\nbe able to manipulate it and be able to call someone else or get on a three way\nconversation.” The court explored the possibility of alternate procedures to permit\ndefendant some telephone access. But ultimately, based on these representations,\nthe court denied defendant’s request to lift the telephone restrictions. The court\nobserved, “It really means that counsel has to visit his client much more frequently\nat the jail, which I know is a burden, but I also know the security problems.” The\ncourt also noted that Ward “must remain on the case until relieved by the court,\neven if your client says otherwise.” Attorney Ward agreed to continue to represent\ndefendant unless and until she obtained a new attorney.\n       At the end of the hearing, the court stated its intent to schedule another\nhearing for March 13, 2002, if defendant agreed to waive time in which to be tried.\nIt explained, “that gives you more time to make a decision about your attorney.”\nDefendant agreed to waive time. She expressed no objection to Ward’s continuing\nrepresentation under the circumstances. Additional hearings were held on March\n13, April 25, and June 17, 2002, during which Ward actively represented\ndefendant. The question of replacing Ward did not arise at these hearings.\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\f       On June 24, 2002 (i.e., 16 days after the videotaped meeting in jail between\ndefendant and Detective Mejia, posing as the fictitious middleman Antonio\nDavis), defendant sent to the court a long letter containing a wide range of\ncomplaints about her confinement.\n       On August 1, 2002, Attorney Ward moved to be relieved as attorney of\nrecord due to “defendant’s total lack of cooperation in the preparation for trial, and\nher totally uncalled-for misbehavior while in jail.” The court conducted a hearing\nthe same day.\n       The court explained to defendant that if it allowed a change of counsel, her\noptions would be to hire her own new attorney or, if she could not do that, it\nwould appoint an attorney to represent her. Defendant mentioned, and the court\nagreed, that a third alternative would be for her to represent herself. The court\nexplained to defendant the process involved in selecting qualified court-appointed\ncounsel. The parties also discussed possible difficulties in allowing defendant\naccess to a law library if she represented herself. The district attorney noted that\ndefendant had been “in administrative segregation initially because she telephoned\na witness and attempted to intimidate that witness and now the reason she’s there\nhas been reinforced by virtue of the fact that she solicited the murder of that same\nwitness.” The court stated its belief that defendant would have access to a law\nlibrary if she represented herself, but it noted other difficulties that would be\ninherent in defendant’s representing herself. It provided defendant with written\ninformation “that talks about the privileges that you do have representing yourself\nand the limitations on it.” The court continued the matter to let defendant consider\nher options. It ordered Ward to continue to represent her in the interim.\n       At the next hearing on August 13, 2002, defendant stated she wanted\nappointed counsel. Both the public defender and the alternative public defender\nannounced that conflicts prevented them from representing her. The court relieved\n\n                                          26\n\fWard as defendant’s attorney and said it would appoint an attorney who was\nqualified to try a death penalty case. After consulting with the assistant\nsupervising judge, it appointed to represent her the next attorney in line on the list\nof available attorneys. On August 16, 2002, the court noted that that attorney was\non vacation and instead appointed Michael Yamamoto to represent defendant.\n       On August 22, 2002, Attorney Yamamoto moved to withdraw as\ndefendant’s attorney, stating, “I am unable to establish an attorney-client\nrelationship with Ms. Rodriguez, based upon what communication has already\ntaken place.” He also stated, “Ms. Rodriguez has indicated that another panel\nattorney would be preferable to her and that this issue is with me, not appointed\ncounsel.” A hearing was held on August 28, 2002. The court stated to defendant\nthat “what I cannot let you do is continue to reject attorneys until you find one that\npleases you the most.” It noted that “you didn’t like the public defender that did\nyour prelim. You didn’t like your own attorney that you hired and now you’ve\ncreated the situation in which Mr. Yamamoto feels he cannot adequately represent\nyou.” It informed defendant that she could not continually change attorneys, and\nthat at some point she would “be stuck.” The court relieved Yamamoto as\nattorney of record and referred the matter to a bar panel to select a new attorney to\nrepresent defendant. David Houchin, defendant’s eventual attorney at trial, was\nappointed to represent her.\n       At a hearing on November 7, 2002, Houchin informed the court for the\nrecord that defendant had just given him a letter from her previous attorney, Ward,\npostmarked August 7, 2002, that, according to defendant, she had just received the\nday before. The letter was stamped that it had been opened in error on August 14,\n2002. Houchin described it as “a three-page single-spaced letter, which contains\nsome very interesting facts about this case. I know that we had problems down at\nTwin Towers [the jail facility where defendant was housed] with respect to people\n\n                                          27\n\fgetting information about this case or having information about this case, perhaps\nstatements made by my client. I just want to put that on the record that this thing\nhas been circulating.” On inquiry from the court, Houchin stated the letter “is a\ndiscussion from her prior counsel as to the case, as to how he anticipates that it\ncould or should proceed, and some steps that she should perhaps consider taking.”\nThe court asked whether Houchin wanted the letter made part of the record under\nseal. Houchin responded that he would “be the custodian of the document.”\n       The prosecutor assured the court and defense counsel that he had not seen\nthe letter. Houchin responded, “I think my concern is perhaps informants popping\nup.” The court noted, “There is nothing much we can do with it at this point.\nObviously, it stayed there far too long before it arrived with Ms. Rodriguez. Mr.\nWard was her retained counsel.” It instructed Houchin to “maintain the\nrecord . . . . If there is a problem, we’ll need to examine what’s in the record to\nsee if that could generate the problem that might come up.” The record contains\nno other reference to this letter.\n       In August 2003, about a month before trial began, Houchin moved the court\nto modify the order restricting defendant’s telephone privileges to permit her to\ncall him. A hearing was held on August 22, 2003. The district attorney expressed\nno objection to modifying defendant’s telephone restrictions as long as the order\npermitted defendant only to call Houchin and not anyone else. He believed it was\nnow possible for the jail to arrange this. The court agreed it was appropriate to\npermit defendant to speak with Houchin by telephone and not require him to visit\nher in jail every time he needed to speak with her. The court signed an order\npermitting defendant to telephone Houchin. It also issued an order directing the\nsheriff to permit defendant to meet face to face with Houchin and the defense\ninvestigator and that they “be provided the opportunity and facilities to play audio\nand video tapes” during the meetings.\n\n                                          28\n\f       The same day, the court signed an order directing the sheriff to conduct an\n“emotional state evaluation — medication status” on defendant. A fax sent to the\ncourt from Shirin Sharifa, Ph.D., on August 27, 2003, stated that defendant “had\nbeen receiving MHTX [apparently mental health treatment] from Twin Towers jail\nfor the past 2 yrs. She was last evaluated by this clinician on 8-27-03.”\n       A lengthy hearing concerning several matters was held on August 28, 2003.\nBased on conversations with jail personnel, the prosecutor expressed concern\nabout the court’s order permitting defendant to call her attorney from jail. He did\nnot want to state his concerns in open court “because if she doesn’t already know\nabout this, it would be telegraphing to her what is possible.” He stated that, based\non his conversations, “I believe [defendant] knows how to manipulate the . . .\nphone system to call someone other than Mr. Houchin.” Accordingly, the court\nheld an in camera hearing in the presence of the prosecutor and Houchin but not\ndefendant. The prosecutor explained his concern that defendant may have learned\nfrom other inmates how to use another inmate’s booking number to call someone\nother than Houchin. Believing that “it’s very important for a defendant, an inmate\nto be able to contact her attorney,” the court let stand the previous order permitting\ndefendant limited telephone access to her attorney subject to a jail deputy coming\nto court for further questioning.\n       Later during the August 28 hearing, in defendant’s presence, Houchin told\nthe court that defendant “said that she was told she’s seen by someone every three\nweeks, and that’s all they can do for her.” The court reviewed the response from\nDr. Sharifa dated the day before and expressed concern that it was inadequate.\nHouchin stated, “I have concerns after speaking with my client. I have seen\ncertainly a change in her demeanor, and an onset of that has been within the last\ntwo weeks. This is something certainly additional or different than what they\nbelieve they’ve been treating her for for the last two years.” Houchin asked to\n\n                                         29\n\fhave someone determine her emotional state, explaining, “I’m having a difficult\ntime even when I go down to see her to keep her focused on things. Her emotional\nstate is certainly not conducive to preparing for this trial.” The court agreed to\nissue an appropriate order that Houchin prepared. Houchin said he would prepare\nan order for the next day.\n       Another hearing was conducted on August 29, 2003. It began in\ndefendant’s absence, but in Houchin’s presence, as a continuation of the in camera\nhearing of the day before. The court spoke with a jail representative, then\ndefendant appeared for the rest of the hearing. After a further hearing in\ndefendant’s presence, the court ultimately ordered that she be permitted to contact\nHouchin by telephone on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays between 6:00 p.m.\nand 8:00 p.m. Houchin said, “That would be fine.” The court signed a written\norder to that effect. The court also confirmed with the jail representative that\ndefendant was entitled to face-to-face interviews in jail with Houchin and the\ninvestigator, with the ability to play tapes.\n       At defendant’s request, the court next conducted an in camera hearing, with\nthe prosecutor excluded, to address her medical concerns. Defendant complained\nthat the jail had placed her in “211 isolation, which is the discipline unit.” She\nbelieved there was no reason for her to be there. She expressed many complaints\nabout her confinement and said she was sick, often vomited, could not eat or sleep,\nand suffered from claustrophobia due to the fact her jail cell had no window. She\ncomplained that her doctor in jail could only see her every three weeks rather than\ngive her weekly therapy, which she believed she needed. The court noted that\n“there’s evidence that you’ve engaged in misconduct that’s been offered here, the\nevidence being that you’ve communicated with witnesses against you and you\nknew you shouldn’t and you tried to persuade them to change their testimony, and\nwith Ms. Hall that you tried to arrange to have the witnesses eliminated. So it’s\n\n                                           30\n\fnot as though you’re doing it, sitting there doing nothing. The discipline sounds\nlike it’s appropriate. The thing I want to find out too is about your medical\ncondition.”\n         After hearing further from defendant, the court asked what she thought was\nthe solution. Defendant said that she needed to be moved to another unit and, “in\norder to be able to help [her attorney] defend myself,” she needed more “mental\npsychiatric counseling.” The court said that “as far as discipline in the jail is\nconcerned, it does seem appropriate . . . given the evidence that I’ve seen here, that\nMs. Rodriguez not be treated as other inmates are, she’s not in the standard\npopulation.” It expressed concern that the cell had no window. But it said it could\nmake no ruling regarding her housing by hearing only one side of the story. It\nsaid, “the first step is for [defendant] to see the doctors and have a report to the\ncourt.” It again agreed to sign an order that Houchin prepared. Houchin said he\n“appreciate[d] the court’s help. I have noticed in the last several weeks’ time\nspent with my client is, she is tearful, emotional, and she can only discuss these\nissues that she brought up to the court here, and my time is not being used to its\nbest.”\n         After again listening to defendant’s concerns, the court said, “I won’t do\nanything based on only one side of the story.” It suggested a new hearing where\nboth sides could be represented. It told defendant, “Ultimately I can issue orders\nthat they have to follow based on your constitutional rights and the necessity to be\nable to prepare for this trial, but I . . . will not do anything just on hearing one side\nof the story. I’ve heard your side. If Mr. Houchin wants to pursue it and bring a\nhearing before the court, we’ll do that at whatever time is appropriate on\n[September 15 ] or otherwise.”\n         The same day, the court issued an order for a “psychiatric evaluation and\nreport back to the court, Dept. 101.” On September 3, 2003, defendant, through\n\n                                           31\n\fcounsel, filed a formal “motion for evidentiary hearing re: defendant’s\nconstitutional rights and appropriateness of present housing assignment.”\n       The court conducted the requested hearing on September 15, 2003, with\ncounty counsel representing the sheriff. The court stated that its “major concern is\nwith [defendant’s] ability to cooperate with counsel and prepare for trial. There\nare other concerns as well as to whether this is inappropriately restricting her at the\ncounty jail.” Psychologist Michael Maloney, the “program director for women’s\nmental health for L.A. County jails,” testified. He said that “defendant is seen by\nDr. Diana Delcarlo, who is a psychiatrist. She sees her every three weeks, talks to\nher and has prescribed Wellbutrin and buspirone, both mild antidepression, anti-\nanxiety drugs.” He said the number of visits defendant received was “more than a\ntypical inmate her capacity would receive.” She was not defined “as in need of\nmental health counseling.” The determination that an inmate needed mental health\ncounseling could be “made by any number of people,” but no one had done so\nregarding defendant.\n       Maloney said that Dr. Kevin Christy, a psychologist, had seen defendant in\nJuly. He “was of the mind that it would be good to talk to her once a week, and I\nsaid we don’t have the staff to do that.” Regarding whether Dr. Christy believed\ndefendant “should” be seen once a week, Maloney said, “The only word I’d\nquestion is ‘should.’ I mean it’s not like a psychological or psychiatric\nemergency. I mean he felt it would be helpful, nice for her to be able to talk to\nsomeone, and I would fully agree with that, but her condition doesn’t warrant it.”\nHe said that every inmate in her unit “would like to talk to somebody on a regular\nbasis. We get requests all the time.”\n       Deputy Nicholas Zabokrtsky testified that defendant was housed in module\n211, an “administration segregation” unit. The cells in that module had no\nwindows except on the door, and the door windows were generally closed due to a\n\n                                          32\n\fcourt order issued for security reasons. Module 231, another administrative\nsegregation unit, was less restrictive and had a window to the outside. At the time\nof the hearing, defendant received “day room privileges” for one hour a day,\nmeaning she could go to a room with a window onto the housing unit and shower\nand “just have time outside of her cell.”\n       After the hearing, the court declined to order defendant moved to module\n231, but it expressed concern about her being housed in a cell with no window.\nUltimately, after considerable further discussion among the parties and defendant\npersonally regarding defendant’s concerns and jail security considerations, the\ncourt ordered that the window on defendant’s jail cell be opened for two hours a\nday during her waking hours, that she receive increased clinician visits, and that\nshe be permitted to shower every other day.\n       On September 26, 2003, the court received from defendant a four-page\nhandwritten document labeled “special in parte motion for in camera hearing by\ndefendant.” Among other things, defendant said there was a “complete\nbreakdown of trust and conflicts of interest” with Houchin. After reviewing the\ndocument, the court treated it as a request for a “Marsden hearing” (People v.\nMarsden (1970) 2 Cal.3d 118) and for a postponement of trial. It conducted the\nhearing the same day in the prosecutor’s absence.\n       Defendant spoke at length at the in camera hearing. Partly she reiterated\nsome of her previous complaints about her confinement. But she also complained\nabout her attorney, Houchin. She said, “I believe he’s a good attorney,” but she\nexpressed concerns about the investigation. Her main concern was about\npresenting a mental defense. She especially wanted someone to present a mental\ndefense regarding the solicitation charge. Specifically, she wanted the defense to\nuse an expert named Dr. Castellano rather than Dr. Vicary (the expert who\nultimately testified on her behalf at the penalty phase). She wanted various people\n\n                                            33\n\fwho worked in the jail, including doctors, and some inmates, to be contacted as\npossible witnesses regarding the solicitation charge. She also expressed concerns\nabout some of her jailers, including Deputy Rachel Jimenez, who was listed as a\npossible witness in the case.\n       After hearing from defendant, the court asked Houchin to respond. He\nnoted that “diminished capacity is no longer a defense.” He stated that “with\nregards to her mental state, I’ve had the opportunity to have and review for some\ntime and with others a report, a very lengthy report prepared by a panel\npsychologist Dr. Richard Romanoff.” The court noted, and Houchin agreed, that\nDr. Romanoff is “one of the best.” Houchin said that “because of discussions that\nI’ve had with my client with respect to Dr. Romanoff and with Dr. Romanoff\nhimself and also with other counsel that have preceded me on this case, without\ngetting into the specifics, that’s why I need to make a change in the mental health\nexpert insofar as the penalty phase, and that has been done.” He said he believed\nthe new defense expert, Dr. Vicary, was “very competent” and would be prepared\nfor what they might need at a penalty phase. He knew that defendant wanted to\nuse Dr. Castellano. But he explained that after Dr. Castellano had “had\ndiscussions with other attorneys,” she declined to be an expert on defendant’s\nbehalf. He said, “I’m sure [Dr. Castellano] would have been very qualified. I\nknow that Dr. Vicary is very well qualified.”\n       Houchin said, “With respect to . . . the defense that she wishes that there be\nmore investigation of the solicitation, there are only certain things that others can\ndo for us on that mental state. I’m sure that Dr. Vicary, and I’ve talked to him\nabout also addressing that issue, that was not an issue when the initial report was\nprepared by Dr. Romanoff. This occurred . . . after he did his workup. Certainly\nDr. Vicary will rely in part on the report and the work and the tests that Dr.\nRomanoff did, and I have asked him also if he could take a look at the issues that\n\n                                          34\n\fmy client wishes very much to discuss, what, if any effect her treatment by the\ndeputies in 211 had on her committing what’s been alleged as a solicitation of\nmurder.”\n       When the court asked him to comment on defendant’s desire to have other\nwitnesses regarding the solicitation count, Houchin replied, “These are people who\nmy understanding, talking with my client, also she has provided a list of these\npeople for the investigator that’s been appointed on this case, go also to the issue\nof things that may have been said by Jimenez to others there, things that Jimenez\nhas done not only to my client but to other people who are there, and pretty much\nthe way I understand it a character impeachment perhaps of Deputy Jimenez on\nthe issue of what may have led to my client doing what is alleged in the\nsolicitation for murder count.”\n       The court asked whether Houchin believed there was a problem “with\nhaving [Deputy Jimenez] as a potential witness and also being in whatever control\nthere is of Ms. Rodriguez.” Houchin responded that Deputy Jimenez did not have\nmuch personal contact with defendant. He added, “And to be honest about it,\njudge, when I have people that are in the position to come in in a guilt phase or\ncertainly a penalty phase with regards to my client’s activity, my concern was,\nshould my client be transferred someplace else, the potential was I could double\nup the number of deputies who would be coming in here with not so kind things to\nsay of my client. I was thinking more in terms of damage control, I’ll be very\nhonest with the court. With respect to where my client was, talking with her,\nkeeping her settled, being able to keep the potential evidence against us that may\ncome in in the penalty phase at a minimum.”4\n\n4      Deputy Jimenez had testified in a hearing held before this in camera\nhearing, but she did not testify at trial.\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\f       The court asked whether Houchin was ready to try the case. He responded\nthat he was. He explained that “my approach to this case and my theory of\nrepresenting my client has differed with her opinions and her wishes and her\ndesires, and these are just hard decisions that I have to make, and I am going to\nmake them.”\n       After hearing from both defendant and Houchin, the court denied\ndefendant’s request for a new attorney and a postponement of trial in a detailed\noral ruling.\n       The jury selection portion of trial began on September 29, 2003, and the\npresentation of evidence began on October 15, 2003. On October 23, 2003, the\ncourt issued a medical order to the sheriff stating, “Medications prescribed have\nnot been dispensed due to [defendant] being in court. Please dispense.” The next\nday, the court issued another medical order stating that “defendant is ill,” and\nordering treatment for “swollen throat, cough, and high fever.”\n       The jury returned its penalty verdict on November 12, 2003. On November\n14, 2003, the sheriff provided a written report to the court. The report stated, “In\nresponse to your court orders dated October 23rd and October 24, 2003, Inmate\nAngelina Rodriguez was examined and treated on November 12, 2003 at Twin\nTowers Correctional Facility, by Manuel Natividad, M.D.” Under “remarks,” the\nreport stated: (1) “Patient has a current diagnosis of Cold Symptoms (resolved)”;\n(2) “Patient’s medications are up-to-date”; (3) “Patient’s prognosis is good”; (4)\n“Patient’s care and treatment are continuing”; and (5) “Patient is fit to continue\ntrial proceedings.”\n       Defendant handwrote a long letter to the court dated December 3, 2003,\nexpressing various concerns about Houchin, mail delivery, and other matters, and\nmaking various requests, including immediate delivery of mail addressed to her,\nappointment of an appellate attorney, daily delivery to her of the Los Angeles\n\n                                         36\n\fTimes, and restoration of telephone privileges. The court conducted a hearing on\nDecember 12, 2003.\n         The court believed it was not appropriate to restrict defendant’s mail\ndelivery. Houchin said he was “unaware of any problems with the mail,” but\ndefendant said she had not seen any mail in over two months. The court agreed\nshe had a right to receive her mail. It directed the bailiff to look into the matter to\ndetermine whether it might have to issue an order. It also agreed that, “given the\nrestrictions,” defendant should receive the Los Angeles Times, and it so ordered.\nIt declined to restore defendant’s telephone privileges, noting that “based on the\nevidence that I heard during the trial, I’d be very concerned still for witnesses.” It\nbelieved “their lives are still at risk.” Regarding defendant’s request for an\nappellate attorney, the court noted that “we obviously will have time to work on\nthat.”\n         On an unrelated point, the prosecutor said that he wished to place certain\ninformation on the record at a later court date for appellate purposes. Specifically,\nhe wanted to present evidence that the investigators had arranged the tape-\nrecorded meeting between Deputy Mejia, posing as the fictitious middleman, and\ndefendant because of concerns that defendant might have been soliciting other\ninmates to murder Gorham. He wanted to show that the action was “not intended\nto create consciousness of guilt evidence, it was intended to make sure we did\neverything that we could to protect Ms. Gorham and guarantee that if there was\nanybody on the outside who intended to follow through on this request, we did our\nvery best to investigate this case and prevent it from happening.” The court gave\npermission for the prosecutor to present the evidence. The prosecutor did so at a\nlater date.\n         At the same hearing, defendant stated that she wanted to read a “long\nstatement” to the court. The court said, and she agreed, that it “would be\n\n                                           37\n\fappropriate” to read the statement when the court considered the automatic motion\nto modify the judgment. Defendant also said she was “in leg chains and the black\nbox,” and complained about extra security in the jail. She said, “I’m not a threat\nwhatsoever in jail.” The court stated that defendant should not be restrained in\ncourt because “I agree she’s not a physical threat at least in court.” It scheduled\nanother hearing to consider the necessity of restraints in jail.\n          The new hearing was held on December 18, 2003. The court stated that the\nrestraint it had seen in court seemed “excessive without some explanation.”\nAccordingly, two witnesses, Psychologist Kevin Christy, and Deputy Zabokrtsky,\ntestified about jail security concerns. Christy said that around the time of the\njury’s death verdict, he had been called to examine defendant at her request. She\nhad just returned from court and was upset about Deputies Jimenez and\nZabokrtsky. “She requested that they . . . not be around her because she didn’t\nknow how she would respond to them.” She said “she was afraid she might do\nsomething to them.” Because of this statement, he was concerned about their\nsafety.\n          Deputy Zabokrtsky testified that when an inmate receives a death verdict “it\nis common practice for us to increase our security level in our handling of that\ninmate based on at that point that individual no longer has anything to lose.”\nRegarding defendant specifically, he stated several security concerns, including\nthe death verdict, her solicitation of murder while in custody, and the concern Dr.\nChristy had expressed. All of these factors caused the jailers to increase her\nrestraints in jail. The court permitted defendant personally to argue that the\nadditional restraints were unwarranted. She reiterated, “I’m not a threat to\nanybody.”\n          The court found the additional restraints in jail justified “primarily because\nof the death verdict and because of the solicitation for murder previously.” It\n\n                                            38\n\fadded, “I do understand that blowing off steam on the day the death verdict is\nsomething that could have been very temporary and not well intended, but the\nother two reasons are very strong reasons for additional security.” It “agree[d] that\nphysically alone at least you [defendant] are not a threat in the courtroom.”\nAccordingly, it ordered defendant not be restrained at the next court appearance.\nThe court also reiterated that defendant was to receive a copy of the Los Angeles\nTimes in her cell (apparently she had not been receiving it) and all of her mail.\n       The next court appearance was held on January 12, 2004, at which the court\ndenied defendant’s automatic motion to modify the death verdict and imposed the\nsentence of death. Before ruling on the motion to modify the judgment, the court\npermitted defendant to make a long statement. Among many other things, she\nreiterated many of her previous complaints about her incarceration.\n\n           2. Asserted Unlawful and Inhumane Conditions of Confinement\n       Defendant contends she “was subjected to unlawful and inhumane\nconditions of confinement” in violation of various constitutional rights.\n       “Some courts have recognized, in the context of civil rights actions brought\nby pretrial detainees, that certain conditions of confinement may so impair the\ndefendant’s ability to communicate with counsel or otherwise participate in the\ndefense that a due process violation or an infringement of the right to effective\nassistance of counsel results. [Citations.] On the other hand, conditions of\nconfinement that have not actually affected the defendant adversely are not\ngrounds for reversal of a conviction . . . .” (People v. Jenkins (2000) 22 Cal.4th\n900, 1002.) Here, nothing in the record suggests that improper conditions of\nconfinement affected defendant’s ability to communicate with counsel or\notherwise participate in the defense.\n\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\f       Defendant certainly complained a lot. But complaints alone do not\nestablish unconstitutional conditions. Contrary to her protestations at various\nhearings, defendant was an obvious and serious security risk. Evidence before the\ntrial court (and later presented at trial) showed that while in jail, she abused her\ntelephone privileges by attempting to dissuade a witness, a criminal offense.\n(§ 136.1, subd. (a)(2).) Defendant’s criminal behavior then escalated to soliciting\nthat same witness’s murder. Under the circumstances, jail personnel, and\nultimately the trial court, properly were concerned about the possibility of further\ncriminal behavior. The trial court listened to defendant’s many complaints, held\nhearings, and took appropriate remedial steps to ensure that she was able to defend\nherself. “The record in the present case does not indicate that the conditions of\ndefendant’s confinement so interfered with [her] ability to communicate with\ncounsel or assist in the defense as to constitute a violation of defendant’s rights to\ndue process or the effective assistance of counsel.” (People v. Jenkins, supra, 22\nCal.4th at pp. 1002-1003.) As in Jenkins, the trial “court was solicitous regarding\ndefendant’s complaints,” it held “hearings to attempt to resolve problems,” and it\nmade appropriate remedial orders. (Id. at p. 1003.)\n       We also “note that a trial court properly defers to a great extent to the\njudgment of jail authorities regarding the conditions of a pretrial detainee’s\nconfinement. [Citation.] The court generally defers to such authorities regarding\nrestraints on the defendant’s liberty if these constraints are reasonably related to a\nlegitimate government purpose — such as . . . to meet institutional security needs\nand the need for internal order and discipline [citation] — unless there is\nsubstantial evidence in the record to indicate that such conditions impose restraints\nthat are excessive relative to the legitimate governmental purpose. [Citation.] The\nrecord suggests strongly that the conditions imposed upon defendant related to\nlegitimate governmental purposes, and in any event [her] claim has little to do\n\n                                          40\n\fwith the validity of the judgment entered against [her] if [her] right to a fair trial\notherwise was observed.” (People v. Jenkins, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1006, fn. 22.)\nHere, the court did not always defer to jail authorities. It took active steps to\nprotect defendant’s ability to defend herself. We see no basis to reverse the\njudgment due to defendant’s conditions of confinement.\n\n           3. Asserted Limitations on and Interference with Defendant’s\n               Communications with Her Attorney\n       Defendant also contends “the trial court’s denial of telephone access and\nvisits from her defense counsel, and permitting jail interference with\ncorrespondence and legal materials deprived” her of various constitutional rights.\n       The court never denied defendant visits from her counsel. Indeed, it\nrepeatedly ordered jail authorities to permit her face-to-face visits with her\nattorney and, later, investigator, including the opportunity and facilities to play\naudio and videotapes. The court also never permitted jail interference with her\ncorrespondence and legal materials. Whenever defendant complained of such\nmatters, the court conducted hearings and took steps that, as far as the record\nshows, resolved any problems.\n       Jail authorities and the court did limit defendant’s telephone privileges, but\nproperly so given her criminal behavior in jail that abused those privileges. The\ncourt presided over several hearings held to determine how to give her as much\naccess to her attorney as possible consistent with institutional security needs.\nDuring some of the time before trial, her attorney had to visit her in jail rather than\nreceive telephone calls from her, which was no doubt inconvenient. Criminal\nbehavior often has inconvenient consequences. But the court was always\nsolicitous of defendant’s right to reasonable access to her attorney and took\nreasonable steps to ensure it. Indeed, a month before jury selection began, the\ncourt arranged a system whereby defendant could call her attorney three days a\n\n\n                                           41\n\fweek during certain hours. Defense counsel said that “would be fine.” This\nrecord presents no reason for this court to disagree with counsel’s assessment.\nDefendant received a full opportunity to defend herself.\n       Defendant also argues the trial court denied her “the right to consult with an\nappellate attorney,” when it declined to appoint an appellate attorney to represent\nher shortly after the penalty verdict. But the trial court had no obligation to\nappoint an appellate attorney to represent her, and certainly not before she was\neven sentenced. This court, not the trial court, appoints the appellate attorneys in\ncapital cases. (Cal. Supreme Ct., Internal Operating Practices & Proc., XV., A.,\n2.) We have done so in this case, and defendant is represented on appeal.\n\n           4. Asserted Failure to Discharge Defendant’s Retained Counsel\n       Defendant contends the “trial court committed reversible error when it\nfailed to discharge [her] retained attorney at her request.”\n       To summarize the relevant facts, in December 2001, defendant told the\ncourt she was “seeking replacement counsel.” She had not then obtained\nreplacement counsel and wanted to have her telephone restrictions lifted so she\ncould try to find a new attorney. After a hearing, the court refused to lift the\nrestrictions. In January 2002, defendant wrote a letter saying she had “removed”\nher retained counsel, Ward, as her attorney. But she had not yet obtained a new\nattorney. At a hearing on January 16, 2002, the court acknowledged that\ndefendant could change attorneys if she wished and discussed her options with\nher. But it also took steps to ensure that Ward would continue to represent her\nunless and until she obtained a new attorney. Defendant voiced no objection to\nWard’s continuing to represent her for the time being. In August 2002, Ward\nasked to be removed as defendant’s attorney, and defendant asked to receive a new\n\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\fcourt-appointed attorney. At that time, over a year before the trial began, the court\nappointed Houchin to represent her and removed Ward as her counsel of record.\n       In general, a criminal defendant has the right to discharge her retained\nattorney. (See People v. Ortiz (1990) 51 Cal.3d 975, 983.) But we see no error in\nthese circumstances. The court did discharge Ward as defendant’s attorney and, at\nher request, appointed a new attorney to represent her. It did not do so in January\n2002, when defendant first said she had “removed” him. At that point, defendant\nhad not yet decided how to replace him. Discharging Ward then would have left\nher unrepresented. But she never indicated she wanted to be left unrepresented. A\ntrial court is not obligated to discharge retained counsel the instant a defendant\nstates the intent to remove that attorney and even before the defendant decides on\na replacement.\n       Defendant can also show no prejudice. More than a year before trial began,\nat defendant’s request, the court appointed Houchin to represent her. He\ncontinued to represent her from that point on until, during, and after trial. The\nfailure to discharge Ward in January 2002, rather than in August 2002, when\ndefendant decided she wanted appointed counsel, merely meant that she did not go\nunrepresented in the interim, which could not have prejudiced her.\n\n           5. Denial of Defendant’s Request for a New Appointed Attorney\n       Before trial, defendant asked the court for a new attorney, claiming\nHouchin was providing ineffective assistance. The court presided over a hearing\nin the prosecutor’s absence and then denied the request. Defendant contends the\ncourt erred.\n       When a defendant seeks to obtain a new court-appointed counsel on the\nbasis of inadequate representation, the court must permit her to explain the basis of\nher contention and to relate specific instances of inadequate performance. The\n\n\n\n                                         43\n\fcourt must appoint a new attorney if the record clearly shows the current attorney\nis not providing adequate representation or that defendant and counsel have such\nan irreconcilable conflict that ineffective representation is likely to result. (People\nv. Jackson (2009) 45 Cal.4th 662, 682; see People v. Marsden, supra, 2 Cal.3d\n118.) If the court holds an adequate hearing, its ruling is reviewed for abuse of\ndiscretion. (People v. Panah (2005) 35 Cal.4th 395, 431.)\n       Here, the court provided defendant a hearing and the full opportunity to\nexpress her concerns. It then heard from counsel, which was appropriate. (People\nv. Panah, supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 432.) Counsel responded point by point to\ndefendant’s concerns. He was aware, for example, that defendant had wanted Dr.\nCastellano to act as her mental health expert, but he explained that she had\ndeclined to do so.5 He assured the court he was prepared for trial. To the extent\nthere may have been some disagreements between Houchin and defendant\nregarding trial tactics, that disagreement did not compel a change of attorneys. “A\ndefendant does not have the right to present a defense of his own choosing, but\n\n5      Defendant argues that Houchin’s “decision to use Vicary was disastrous.\nVicary was ill prepared. He did not verify the information provided him almost\nentirely by [defendant] and was impeached on that very shortcoming. Having\nbeen provided by Houchin with a prior doctor’s report, Vicary offered some of the\nmost damaging testimony against [defendant] — that she intentionally enlisted the\nassistance of her 9 year old daughter to kill her husband. Vicary did not testify to\nany aspect of [defendant’s] mental state which might negate the specific intent\nelement of the crimes with which she was charged.” The record does not support\nthese assertions. Dr. Vicary seemed fully prepared. No reason appears to assume\nhe did anything but the best he could have done under the circumstances. For\nexample, in light of the extraordinarily calculated nature of defendant’s killing of\nher husband (on her third attempt, in order to collect on a life insurance policy),\nthe record presents no basis to assume Dr. Vicary could have provided any\ncredible testimony to negate the mental state necessary for first degree murder.\nAdditionally, presenting expert mental health testimony inherently risks inviting\ndamaging cross-examination.\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\fmerely the right to an adequate and competent defense. [Citation.] Tactical\ndisagreements between the defendant and his attorney do not by themselves\nconstitute an ‘irreconcilable conflict.’ ‘When a defendant chooses to be\nrepresented by professional counsel, that counsel is “captain of the ship” and can\nmake all but a few fundamental decisions for the defendant.’ ” (People v. Welch\n(1999) 20 Cal.4th 701, 728-729.) We see no abuse of discretion in the court’s\ndenial of defendant’s motion for a new attorney.\n\n           6. Defendant’s Competence to Stand Trial\n       Defendant contends she was incompetent to stand trial, and that the trial\ncourt erroneously failed to conduct a meaningful hearing on her competence.\n       “Both the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution and state law require a trial judge to suspend proceedings and\nconduct a competency hearing whenever the court is presented with substantial\nevidence of incompetence, that is, evidence that raises a reasonable or bona fide\ndoubt concerning the defendant’s competence to stand trial.” (People v. Blair\n(2005) 36 Cal.4th 686, 711.) “A defendant can create reasonable doubt through\nsubstantial evidence of mental incompetence, or the trial court can raise the issue\non its own.” (People v. Ary (2011) 51 Cal.4th 510, 517.) A defendant is\nincompetent to stand trial if she is unable to consult with her attorney with a\nreasonable degree of rational understanding or lacks a rational and factual\nunderstanding of the proceedings against her. (Ibid.; see § 1367, subd. (a).)\n“[A]bsent a showing of ‘incompetence’ that is ‘substantial’ as a matter of law, the\ntrial judge’s decision not to order a competency hearing is entitled to great\ndeference, because the trial court is in the best position to observe the defendant\nduring trial.” (People v. Mai (2013) 57 Cal.4th 986, 1033.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         45\n\f       Here, not only did the court have the opportunity to observe defendant\nduring trial, it had the opportunity to observe her at many pretrial hearings at\nwhich she often spoke at great length. It did not err in failing to inquire into\ndefendant’s mental state more than it did. The record contains no substantial\nevidence that she was incompetent to stand trial, i.e., that she was unable to\nconsult with her attorney with a reasonable degree of understanding or lacked a\nrational and factual understanding of the proceedings. Defendant and, on one\noccasion, her attorney expressed concern that some of her conditions of\nconfinement were affecting her mental state and her ability to help prepare a\ndefense. She was receiving mental health treatment in jail, but she said she needed\nmore treatment. The court inquired into the medical concerns and ordered a\npsychiatric evaluation. It also ordered that defendant receive more frequent\nclinical visits. But the purpose of these orders was to determine whether\ndefendant’s concerns were valid and whether yet more mental health treatment\nwas necessary. No one suggested she was actually incompetent to stand trial.\n       Defendant’s many lengthy statements before the court, including during the\nMarsden hearing held a few days before trial, showed she was articulate,\nunderstood the charges against her, and was able to assist counsel. (See People v.\nLewis (2008) 43 Cal.4th 415, 525-526.) No reason appeared for the court to\nsuspend proceedings and conduct a competency hearing.\n\n           7. Defendant’s Absence from Proceedings\n       Defendant contends she was erroneously absent from court proceedings on\nthree occasions: (1) a portion of the hearing on August 28, 2003, regarding\ndefendant’s telephone restrictions; (2) the beginning of the hearing on August 29,\n2003, which was essentially a continuation of the in camera hearing on the\nprevious day; and (3) the beginning of the hearing on September 29, 2003, the first\n\n\n\n                                          46\n\fday of jury selection. Before defendant appeared on September 29, the court\nordered Gwendolyn Hall, who had been subpoenaed for that day, to appear at a\nlater date. Defendant was then brought into court and she was present thereafter.\nHer attorney was present on all three occasions.\n       “Broadly stated, a criminal defendant has a right to be personally present at\ncertain pretrial proceedings and at trial under various provisions of law . . . .”\n(People v. Cole (2004) 33 Cal.4th 1158, 1230.) However, “[a] defendant is not\nentitled to be personally present during proceedings that bear no reasonable,\nsubstantial relation to his opportunity to defend the charges against him, and the\nburden is on the defendant to demonstrate that his absence prejudiced his case or\ndenied him a fair and impartial trial.” (People v. Benavides (2005) 35 Cal.4th 69,\n89.)\n       The hearings held in defendant’s absence bore no substantial relation to her\nopportunity to defend against the charges. The portions of the hearings on August\n28 and 29, 2003, were conducted in defendant’s absence so the prosecutor could\nexplain to the court how inmates were able to use jail telephones to call someone\nthey were not supposed to call. The prosecutor and court were understandably\nreluctant to educate defendant on how she could manipulate the system, in case\nshe did not already know. In any event, defendant was represented by counsel at\nall times, and most of the hearings regarding restrictions on her telephone access\nwere conducted in her presence. She was present, for example, at the latter\nportion of the August 29, 2003, hearing when the court ordered that she be\npermitted to contact her attorney three days a week during specified hours. Her\nabsence during parts of those hearings did not affect her opportunity to defend\nagainst the charges. Her brief absence at the beginning of the September 29, 2002,\nhearing, when the court merely ordered a witness to appear at a later date,\n\n\n\n                                          47\n\fobviously also bore no relation to defendant’s opportunity to defend against the\ncharges.\n\n           8. Asserted Judicial Bias\n       Defendant contends Judge Pounders was biased against her. She never\nobjected on this basis, or moved to disqualify him for bias, at any time during the\nlengthy pretrial proceedings over which he presided or during or after trial.\nAccordingly, this claim is forfeited. Defendant may not go to trial before a judge\nand gamble on a favorable result, and then assert for the first time on appeal that\nthe judge was biased. (People v. Farley (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1053, 1110; People v.\nChatman (2006) 38 Cal.4th 344, 362-363; see People v. Rogers (1978) 21 Cal.3d\n542, 548 [“The contrary rule would . . . ‘permit the defendant to gamble on an\nacquittal at his trial secure in the knowledge that a conviction would be reversed\non appeal.’ ”].)\n       Moreover, the contention lacks merit. Judge Pounders was very responsive\nto defendant’s legitimate concerns and needs. He always patiently permitted her\nto speak when she wished. He took active steps to ensure she had adequate access\nto her attorney and to protect her other rights. After trial, he went so far as to\norder the Los Angeles Times to be delivered to her cell. Contrary to defendant’s\nargument, the fact the judge permitted the prosecution to place certain information\non the record after the trial did not show bias. He permitted both sides to place\nmatters on the record. The record contains no hint of judicial bias.\n\n       B. Guilt Trial Issues\n\n           1. Excusal for Cause of Two Prospective Jurors\n       Defendant contends the court erred in excusing for cause two prospective\njurors. The court may excuse prospective jurors for cause if their views on the\ndeath penalty would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties\n\n\n                                          48\n\fas jurors. (People v. Duenas (2012) 55 Cal.4th 1, 10.) The court may excuse\nprospective jurors for other reasons if their state of mind will prevent them from\nacting impartially and without prejudice to any party. (People v. Carasi (2008) 44\nCal.4th 1263, 1290.) The standard of review in both situations is the same.\n“When the prospective juror’s answers on voir dire are conflicting or equivocal,\nthe trial court’s findings as to the prospective juror’s state of mind are binding on\nappellate courts if supported by substantial evidence.” (People v. Duenas, supra,\nat p. 10.)\n       The first of these prospective jurors stated on her questionnaire that her\ngeneral feelings about the death penalty were “for and against” and her\nphilosophical opinion was “neutral.” She believed life in prison without the\npossibility of parole was a worse punishment than death. She was an employee of\nthe Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office (the office prosecuting the\ncase), but she said she could vote not guilty. During questioning by the court\nregarding the death penalty, she said she could adjust her thinking regarding which\npunishment was worse and vote for life if appropriate. She also indicated that in\ndeath penalty prosecutions she had “come across in my dealings with the office,”\nonly once had she agreed with it. She told defense counsel her mind would be\nopen to either punishment, and that she believed the death penalty was not used\nenough.\n       When the prosecutor asked her whether she could personally vote for death,\nshe said, “I don’t know.” She reiterated that she had seen death penalty cases in\nher experience as an employee of the district attorney’s office, and only once had\nshe agreed with the decision to seek the death penalty — in a case in which the\n“defendant was very violent and he had committed several murders and he had\nfinally been caught.” When asked again whether she could personally vote for\ndeath, she responded, “I’m not sure.” She said that was the best answer she could\n\n                                          49\n\fgive. She added that she would be more comfortable not sitting on a death penalty\ncase, explaining, “You holding somebody’s life in your hands, and I mean people\ndo wrong, but I’m not really really really for the death penalty. I understand it and\nI think there are some circumstances it should be death, but I don’t know if I\npersonally could say, yeah, this person deserves to die.”\n       The court excused this prospective juror for cause. It noted that her\nanswers to its questions had made her appear acceptable, but it believed that “her\nstatement finally that she was not sure that she could impose the death sentence I\nthink does indicate that it is . . . not a realistic, practical possibility that she would\ndo that, particularly given the circumstances here. Perhaps on a defendant who\nhas killed 25 people she might be able to do that, so I will allow the challenge for\ncause” as to that juror.\n       The record supports the court’s excusal of this juror. She assured defense\ncounsel that she could vote for life in an appropriate case, but she could not give a\ncomparable assurance that she could vote for death in an appropriate case. In this\nsituation, we must defer to the trial court’s judgment regarding this prospective\njuror’s state of mind.\n       The second of these prospective jurors answered “yes” on the jury\nquestionnaire to the question whether he had any religious or moral feelings that\nwould make it difficult or impossible to sit in judgment of another person. He\nexplained, “Most engrained in my mind is the dictum: ‘Judgment is mine!’\nVengeance is as hazy as judgment to me.” He said law enforcement had once\nbeen “non-chalant” in responding to a crime involving a friend or relative. He\nalso noted an unpleasant experience he had had with a peace officer, although he\nalso said that a peace officer had been “very helpful and courteous.” He said he\nwas moderately in favor of the death penalty.\n\n\n\n                                            50\n\f       During voir dire, when asked whether his concern about law enforcement\nwould cause a testifying officer to “have to prove something extra to be believed\nby you,” he responded, “My feelings ambivalent, but I would take it one at a\ntime.” He said he would not “hold this against the officer testifying.” Later he\nsaid, “And I would be very very . . . questioning on the officer’s veracity . . . .”\nBut he added, “I don’t make a general statement.” He told defense counsel he\nwould not automatically disregard a law enforcement officer’s testimony. But\nwhen the prosecutor asked whether he would have more questions about a police\nofficer’s credibility than other witnesses, he responded, “I think I would have,\nyeah.” Specifically, he would treat a deputy sheriff who testified “differently in\nterms of evaluating the credibility than [he] would a regular witness who wasn’t a\nlaw enforcement officer.”\n       When asked about the death penalty he said, “My attitude towards capital\npunishment is, if it is . . . a punishment, it is my feeling doesn’t seem to be a\ndeterrent to — it doesn’t seem to achieve the purpose really. My feelings as far as\nit’s — it’s still a tooth for a tooth kind of thing rather than to punish the accused.\nAnd I tend more to not favor capital punishment.” Later he said he was\n“moderately” in favor of the death penalty. He added that he could impose the\ndeath penalty. When asked about his “vengeance is mine” response on the\nquestionnaire, he said, “It’s more on the penalty portion of it, on the . . . capital\npunishment.” He said he could be fair to the prosecutor’s side, but he also said\nthat, although he could “be in judgment” regarding guilt, “the capital punishment\nis one that makes me uncomfortable.” When asked whether the lack of comfort\nwould affect his ability to be fair to the prosecutor, he responded, “I don’t think so\nbecause . . . mine is emotional side. If I divorce my emotions from or my . . . kind\nof belief that capital punishment is not a deterrent, if it is only on that phase, it’s\nnot — I . . . would not be affected by your . . . side. I would still be . . . fair to\n\n                                            51\n\fyour arguments.” He would “definitely make sure that my emotion will not enter\ninto it.”\n        The prosecutor challenged this juror for cause both because he would not\njudge police officers by the same standards as other witnesses and because of\nconcerns about his ability to decide penalty. He explained, “I believe that\nnotwithstanding his final answer, he’s given other answers which indicate that he’s\nincapable, I think, of deciding penalty fairly.” Defense counsel objected, arguing\nthe juror could be fair.\n        The court granted the challenge. It was concerned about the juror’s\nexplanation that the “vengeance is mine” answer on the questionnaire “didn’t\napply to the guilt phase, it applied to the penalty phase.” It noted that the answer\noccurred early in the questionnaire, long before there was any mention of the death\npenalty. “So when he answered, he did not know that the penalty was a possibility\nof death, so I don’t accept his answer as being that’s what he’s saying, that it deals\nonly with the penalty. He’s basically saying that’s going to affect — the charges\nhere are going to affect him, even deciding the guilt phase of the case. Anyway,\non both issues, I will accept the challenge for cause.”\n        The record supports the court’s determination that this juror’s state of mind\nwould prevent him from being entirely impartial. The juror’s explanation\nregarding his “vengeance is mine” answer was quite confused, and he essentially\nadmitted he would judge law enforcement witnesses by a different standard than\nother witnesses. Accordingly, as we must, we defer to the court’s ruling as to this\nprospective juror. We see no error.\n\n\n\n\n                                          52\n\f           2. Evidentiary Rulings\n\n                a. Admission of Demeanor Evidence\n       Defendant contends the court erred on several occasions in permitting\nwitnesses to testify regarding her demeanor. The court generally overruled her\nobjections that the testimony was speculative.\n       Officer Sharpe, who first responded to the call at defendant’s home the\nmorning Frank died, testified about her demeanor and contrasted it with the\ndemeanor of others who had lost a loved one that he had had contact with in the\npast. Frank’s sister, Rebecca Perkins, testified about defendant’s lack of emotion\nwhen she spoke with defendant the day Frank died. When Perkins later said that\ndefendant “wasn’t upset for losing a husband,” the court sustained defendant’s\nobjection on the ground it was speculative. Defendant’s other sister, Shirley\nCoers, testified that when she spoke with defendant shortly after Frank’s death,\n“she always seemed very calm”; she seemed “not upset, not crying, not sad.”\nMickey Marracino, the life insurance agent whom defendant contacted shortly\nafter Frank’s death, testified about her lack of emotion and said, “she didn’t stop to\ncompose herself the way other people have done when I’ve talked to them when\nthey’ve lost a loved one.” Detective Wilsey, the original investigator into this\ncase, testified about defendant’s lack of emotion. He explained, “Her first\nquestions were relating to the coroner’s department, the disposition of the body.\nShe had mentioned that she wanted to have the body cremated, and the questions\nwere centered around that, not . . . cause of death, which is normally what we hear\nor . . . what’s happening with the case, that kind of a thing.”\n\n\n\n\n                                          53\n\f       Defendant contends this demeanor testimony was “irrelevant, without\nfoundation, and based on speculation.” 6 However, she objected at trial only on\ngrounds that the testimony was speculative. Accordingly, only that objection is\ncognizable on appeal. (People v. Partida (2005) 37 Cal.4th 428, 433-434.) An\nobjection was particularly necessary regarding defendant’s lack-of-foundation\nclaim. An objection on that basis would have allowed the party offering the\nevidence to lay additional foundation as needed. (People v. Partida, supra, at p.\n434.) In any event, defendant does not explain what foundation was lacking and\nwe perceive no missing foundation. The witnesses spoke from personal\nknowledge.\n       To the extent, if any, that defendant’s relevance contention differs from the\ncontention that the testimony was speculative, that contention is not cognizable.\nMoreover, the testimony was relevant. It had a “tendency in reason to prove or\ndisprove any disputed fact that is of consequence to the determination of the\naction.” (Evid. Code, § 210.) It was relevant on the question of whether\ndefendant was a grieving widow or had just killed her husband to collect life\ninsurance proceeds, a question obviously of consequence in deciding whether\ndefendant was guilty of her husband’s murder.\n       Defendant’s argument that the testimony was speculative is cognizable. To\nsome extent that objection is inherently based on relevance. “[T]he prohibition\nagainst an examiner’s question that calls for an answer based on speculation and\n\n6      Defendant also contends the court erred in permitting Sergeant Holmes to\nprovide demeanor testimony at a pretrial hearing. This testimony was not\npresented at trial. Defendant asserts, without elaboration, that some of the\n“demeanor testimony contributed to erroneous pretrial rulings.” But defendant\ndoes not identify those pretrial rulings or explain how they were erroneous, how\nthe demeanor testimony contributed to the asserted error, or how the rulings\naffected the trial. Accordingly, we do not consider this point.\n\n\n\n                                         54\n\fconjecture is also founded on the concept of relevancy. Such testimony is\nirrelevant, because it does not have a tendency in reason to prove or disprove the\ndisputed issue on which the testimony is proffered.” (1 Jefferson’s Cal. Evidence\nBenchbook (Cont. Ed. Bar 4th ed. 2013) Competency, Examination, and\nCredibility of Witnesses, § 28.56, p. 534.) Accordingly, to the extent defendant’s\nrelevancy argument is included in her argument concerning speculation, that\nargument is cognizable. But we see no error. No blanket rule prohibiting\ndemeanor testimony exists, and the trial court here reasonably found the actual\ntestimony not speculative.\n       “[A]n examiner’s question asking a lay witness to testify to facts that the\nwitness has not personally observed, or to state an opinion not based on his or her\nown observations, calls for speculation and conjecture by the witness and is\nprohibited by” Evidence Code sections 702 and 800. (1 Jefferson’s Cal. Evidence\nBenchbook, supra, § 28.56, p. 534.) Here, the testimony the court permitted was\nbased on facts the witnesses had personally observed. The court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in finding the testimony not speculative. (People v. Taylor (1990) 52\nCal.3d 719, 739.)\n       Defendant cites People v. Sergill (1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 34, where the\nappellate court found the trial court had erred in permitting police officers to\ntestify that, in their opinion, a certain witness was credible. The demeanor\ntestimony of this case, based on the witnesses’ own perceptions, bears no\nresemblance to the testimony found inadmissible in Sergill.\n       The parties debate at length whether the testimony was admissible as either\nlay or expert opinion. However, defendant did not object that the testimony was\nimpermissible opinion, so any argument in this regard is not cognizable.\nMoreover, it does not appear the court admitted the evidence as opinion testimony.\nThe testimony was based on the witnesses’ own perceptions. Indeed, the court\n\n                                          55\n\fsustained defendant’s objection to Perkins’s statement that defendant “wasn’t\nupset for losing a husband,” which does appear to have been an opinion. Contrary\nto defendant’s assertion that the court’s rulings were inconsistent, the court\nconsistently permitted the witnesses to testify about what they had observed, but\nnot to express an opinion as to the meaning of those observations. Doing so came\nwithin its discretion.\n       Defendant also challenges the admissibility of Sergeant Holmes’s\ntestimony that “I knew that she was calling every day and every single\nconversation was regarding financial, getting money to make it, and she wanted\nthe coroner’s office to come back as soon as possible with a cause of death so that\nshe could be financially better off.” Defendant did not object to this testimony, so\nthe contention is not cognizable. Moreover, this was not demeanor testimony at\nall but was merely Sergeant Holmes’s summary of his many telephone\nconversations with defendant during the investigation. No basis appears for\ndefendant to have objected to this testimony.\n\n                b. Asserted Violation of Confrontation Rights\n       Defendant contends the court violated her right to confront witnesses under\nthe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n       Defendant first challenges the admission of statements Gwendolyn Hall\nmade to law enforcement agents regarding defendant’s efforts to solicit Gorham’s\nmurder. The prosecution called Hall as a witness, and she testified in front of the\njury. Although she provided some testimony, she also claimed not to have any\nmemory regarding the events she had told law enforcement agents about.\nDefendant then cross-examined her. The trial court found Hall’s “statements that\nshe does not recall are not truthful” and, over defendant’s objection, admitted\nevidence of her prior statements.\n\n\n\n                                         56\n\f       Admitting the prior statements did not violate defendant’s right to confront\nHall. Hall testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination. The United\nStates Supreme Court has made clear that admitting prior statements of a witness\nwho testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination does not violate a\ndefendant’s confrontation rights. (California v. Green (1970) 399 U.S. 149; see\nPeople v. Green (1971) 3 Cal.3d 981 [same case on remand].)\n       In support of her argument, defendant cites a series of high court decisions\nbeginning with Crawford v. Washington (2004) 541 U.S. 36 (Crawford). Those\ncases changed constitutional confrontation law in a significant respect. Crawford\nheld that the prosecution may not rely on “testimonial” out-of-court statements\nunless the witness testifies at trial or is unavailable to testify and the defendant had\na prior opportunity for cross-examination. (See, e.g., People v. Lopez (2012) 55\nCal.4th 569, 576-580.) But those cases made no change regarding use of prior\nstatements of a witness who actually testifies. Crawford itself “reiterate[d] that,\nwhen the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation\nClause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements.”\n(Crawford, supra, at pp. 59-60, fn. 9 [citing California v. Green, supra, 399 U.S.\n149 ]; see People v. Cowan (2010) 50 Cal.4th 401, 463 [“The Sixth Amendment’s\nconfrontation clause does not prohibit admitting into evidence ‘testimonial’\nhearsay statements against a defendant if the declarant appears for cross-\nexamination at trial.”].)\n       As a practical matter, Hall’s claim of total lack of recall limited defendant’s\nability to cross-examine her about her prior statements. But this circumstance\ndoes not implicate the confrontation clause. (United States v. Owens (1988) 484\nU.S. 554, 555-560; People v. Dement (2011) 53 Cal.4th 1, 23-24.) “The\nwitness . . . was not absent from the trial. She testified at length at trial and was\nsubjected to lengthy cross-examination. The jury had the opportunity to observe\n\n                                          57\n\fher demeanor, and the defense cross-examined her about bias. Even though she\nprofessed total inability to recall the crime or her statements to police, and this\nnarrowed the practical scope of cross-examination, her presence at trial as a\ntestifying witness gave the jury the opportunity to assess her demeanor and\nwhether any credibility should be given to her testimony or her prior statements.\nThis was all the constitutional right to confrontation required.” (People v. Perez\n(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 760, 766.) The same is true here.\n       It is not clear whether defendant also contends that admitting Hall’s prior\nstatements violated state law. But doing so did not violate state law. “A witness’s\nprior statement that is inconsistent with his or her testimony is admissible so long\nas the witness is given the opportunity to explain or deny the statement. (Evid.\nCode, §§ 770, 1235.)” (People v. Ledesma (2006) 39 Cal.4th 641, 710.)\nOrdinarily, a witness’s inability to remember an event is not inconsistent with that\nwitness’s prior statement describing the event. (Id. at p. 711.) When, however, “a\nwitness’s claim of lack of memory amounts to deliberate evasion, inconsistency is\nimplied. [Citation.] As long as there is a reasonable basis in the record for\nconcluding that the witness’s ‘I don’t remember’ statements are evasive and\nuntruthful, admission of his or her prior statements is proper.” (People v. Johnson\n(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1183, 1219-1220; see People v. Ledesma, supra, at pp. 711-712.)\nHere, the trial court expressly found Hall’s repeated “I don’t recall” claims to be\nuntruthful. The record provides a reasonable basis for that conclusion.\nAccordingly, admitting Hall’s prior statements did not violate state law.\n       In any event, the jury did not reach a verdict on the charge of soliciting\nmurder, the only charge to which Hall’s prior statements related. Accordingly,\nadmitting those statements did not prejudice defendant at the guilt phase.\n       Next, defendant contends the presentation of the technical evidence\nviolated her confrontation rights. Specifically, she challenges the testimony that\n\n                                          58\n\fthe victim’s body contained oleander and ethylene glycol, and Dr. Clark’s opinion\ntestimony. She did not object at trial. But to the extent defendant contends there\nwas a confrontation clause violation under Crawford, supra, 541 U.S. 36, and its\nprogeny, we have excused the failure to object in trials that, like this one, predated\nCrawford. (People v. Pearson (2013) 56 Cal.4th 393, 461-462.) Accordingly, we\nwill consider defendant’s contention on the merits.\n       The contention lacks merit. Indeed, it is not clear exactly what\nconfrontation defendant claims she was denied. Dr. Birgit Puschner, a\ntoxicologist, performed the tests that showed the victim’s body contained\noleander; she testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination. (Defendant\ndid not actually cross-examine her, but that does not matter. She had the\nopportunity to cross-examine her. (Crawford, supra, 541 U.S. at p. 59.)) Dan\nAnderson, also a toxicologist, and Dr. Chinwah, the pathologist who performed\nthe autopsy, both independently tested and determined that the victim’s body\ncontained ethylene glycol; both testified at trial and were subject to cross-\nexamination. And Dr. William Chao, the emergency room doctor who treated the\nvictim on September 7, 2000, testified and was subject to cross-examination.\nDefendant thus received full confrontation rights as to these witnesses. Dr. Clark,\nwho testified and was subject to cross-examination, based his opinions on the\nreports of those experts, but, because those experts also testified and were subject\nto cross-examination, defendant was able to confront all of the experts. A\ntestifying expert may base his or her opinion on hearsay statements, even if\ntestimonial, at least when those who made the hearsay statements also testify and\nare subject to cross-examination. Defendant received full confrontation rights as\nto those portions of the reports, if any, that are testimonial under Crawford, supra,\n541 U.S. 36, and its progeny.\n\n\n\n                                          59\n\f       One or possibly two exceptions exist. First, Anderson testified that blood\nsamples from the victim’s body had been sent to an independent laboratory, and\nthe laboratory returned a report stating that the samples contained ethylene glycol.\nWe need not determine whether this report was testimonial (see, e.g., People v.\nLopez, supra, 55 Cal.4th 569), because any error in permitting this testimony was\nharmless. Anderson also testified that after he received the report, he conducted\nhis own testing and determined himself that the victim’s body contained ethylene\nglycol. Moreover, Dr. Chinwah testified that he reexamined the body and also\ndetermined that the kidneys contained ethylene glycol. Because of these\nindependent opinions by testifying witnesses on a point defendant did not dispute,\nAnderson’s mention of the original report was harmless beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. (People v. Lopez, supra, at p. 585.)\n       Second, although it is difficult to discern on this record because of the\nabsence of an objection, it is possible that portions of the medical records from the\nvictim’s visit to the emergency room about which Dr. Chao (and possibly Dr.\nClark) testified were generated by someone other than Dr. Chao, such as nurses.\nBut one of Crawford’s progeny makes clear that “medical records created for\ntreatment purposes . . . would not be testimonial under our decision today.”\n(Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts (2009) 557 U.S. 305, 312, fn. 2.) The medical\nrecords from the victim’s emergency room visit were created for treatment\npurposes, not for some other purpose such as law enforcement. Defendant was not\nyet a suspect in a murder that had not yet occurred. Accordingly, the medical\nrecords were not testimonial.\n\n\n\n\n                                         60\n\f       C. Penalty Issues\n\n           1. Effect of Asserted Guilt Phase Errors on Penalty Determination\n       Defendant contends that the asserted guilt phase errors were prejudicial at\nthe penalty phase. However, the only possible guilt phase error that we have\nidentified is the presumed error in permitting the toxicologist, Anderson, to\nmention the results of the independent laboratory’s report finding ethylene glycol\nin the victim’s blood, and that was harmless because Anderson and Dr. Chinwah\nboth independently determined that the victim’s body contained ethylene glycol.\nThe presumed error was equally harmless to the penalty determination.\n\n           2. Issues Concerning the Evidence of Defendant’s Prior Murder\n       Defendant raises several issues concerning the evidence that she murdered\nher infant daughter.\n\n               a. Adequacy of the Hearing Regarding the Admissibility of the\n                   Evidence\n       Section 190.3 requires the prosecution to provide the defendant with notice\nof aggravating evidence it intends to introduce at the penalty phase. The\nprosecutor’s notice of aggravating evidence filed to comply with this section\nstated the intent to present evidence of, among other matters, defendant’s murder\nof her daughter, Alicia F. In response, defendant moved the court to conduct a\n“preliminary examination” regarding the admissibility of that evidence. The\nprosecutor filed an opposition that stated in detail the evidence that defendant\nmurdered her daughter and attached a copy of Dr. Knauss’s report.\n       The court held a hearing before trial. It stated it had read defendant’s\nmotion and the prosecutor’s response. Defense counsel asked the court to preside\nover a hearing at which Dr. Knauss testified. The court agreed to do so.\nAccordingly, Dr. Knauss testified outside the jury’s presence, giving testimony\nconsistent with his later testimony before the jury. After hearing Dr. Knauss’s\n\n\n                                         61\n\ftestimony and considering arguments from counsel, the court found the evidence\nthat defendant murdered her daughter was sufficient to go to the jury.\n       Defendant contends the hearing was inadequate. A trial court may\n“conduct a preliminary inquiry before the penalty phase to determine whether\nthere is substantial evidence to prove each element of the other criminal activity.”\n(People v. Phillips (1985) 41 Cal.3d 29, 72, fn. 25) “[T]his preliminary inquiry is\ndiscretionary and, if held, need not be an evidentiary hearing. If the court does\nelect, in its discretion, to conduct such an inquiry it may be based on an offer of\nproof.” (People v. Jones (2011) 51 Cal.4th 346, 380.) Here, the trial court did\nconduct a preliminary inquiry. It read the moving papers and the prosecutor’s\nsummary of the evidence, which was in effect an offer of proof, and heard\narguments from both sides regarding the strength of the evidence. Additionally,\nalthough it did not have to do so (see People v. Hart (1999) 20 Cal.4th 546, 649),\nit required Dr. Knauss to testify both at the preliminary inquiry and again at the\npenalty phase. This inquiry came well within its discretion.\n       Defendant contends the court applied the wrong legal standard in finding\nthe evidence sufficient. The record does not support the contention. “Contrary to\ndefendant’s urging, the prosecution did not bear the burden at the preliminary\ninquiry to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed a violent\ncrime. The court could accept ‘evidence that would allow a rational trier of fact to\nmake a determination beyond a reasonable doubt as to [such] criminal activity.’ ”\n(People v. Ochoa (1998) 19 Cal.4th 353, 449, quoting People v. Clair (1992) 2\nCal.4th 629, 676.) The prosecutor cited Ochoa, both in its written opposition and\nat the hearing. Nothing in the record suggests the court applied some different,\nlower standard.\n       Moreover, no abuse of discretion in admitting evidence of other crimes will\nbe found if, in fact, the evidence was legally sufficient. (People v. Whisenhunt\n\n                                         62\n\f(2008) 44 Cal.4th 174, 225.) As we next conclude, the evidence was sufficient to\nsubmit the matter to the jury.\n\n               b. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n       Defendant contends the evidence was insufficient for the jury to find\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that she murdered her daughter. Because the question\nconcerns the admissibility of evidence, it also comes within the trial court’s\ndiscretion. (People v. Jones, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 380; People v. Clair, supra, 2\nCal.4th at p. 676.) We see no abuse of discretion.\n       There was ample evidence that defendant murdered her daughter. About\ntwo months before Alicia died, defendant took out life insurance on the baby\nwithout telling her then husband, the baby’s father, and named only herself the\nprimary beneficiary. This circumstance alone strongly suggests she murdered her\ndaughter to collect the life insurance proceeds, just as she later murdered her\nhusband to collect on a life insurance policy that she insisted he take out. She was\nthe lone adult in the house when the baby choked to death and, rather than remain\nwith the baby until emergency help arrived, as the jury could reasonably find a\nmother would normally do, she left the baby inside and met the police outside her\nhouse. After her daughter died, she seemed more concerned about collecting the\npacifier parts and suing Gerber than about losing her baby. Thomas testified that\ndefendant had previously heard about Gerber’s recall of the pacifier on which the\nbaby later choked. Additionally, Dr. Knauss’s testimony strongly supported a\nfinding that the baby’s death could not have been an accident, especially when\ncombined with defendant’s deposition testimony that she continually checked the\npacifier by pulling on it. His opinion was especially credible given that defendant\nherself had retained him to provide an opinion. “The foregoing evidence was\nsufficient to allow a rational trier of fact to determine beyond a reasonable doubt\n\n\n\n                                         63\n\fthat defendant murdered” her daughter. (People v. Hart, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p.\n650.)\n\n                c. Evidentiary Claims\n        Defendant contends the court committed several evidentiary errors\nregarding the evidence that she murdered her daughter.\n        First, she contends the court erred in admitting evidence of her deposition\ntestimony, apparently on the ground that it was inadmissible hearsay. (See pt. I.\nB. 1. a., post.) However, defendant did not object on this ground so the contention\nis not cognizable on appeal. (People v. Partida, supra, 37 Cal.4th at pp. 433-434.)\n        Defendant contends her attorney was ineffective for not objecting on this\nground. However, an objection on hearsay grounds would have been specious.\nEvidence Code section 1220 makes a “statement” of a party an exception to the\ngeneral rule forbidding hearsay evidence when the statement is offered against that\nparty. Defendant argues that nothing in her deposition testimony could be\nconsidered an “admission.” The argument is irrelevant. Although Evidence Code\nsection 1220’s exception to the hearsay rule is sometimes referred to an exception\nfor admissions, the exception is not so limited. (People v. Horning (2004) 34\nCal.4th 871, 898, fn. 5.) Instead, the exception applies to all statements of the\nparty against whom they are offered. Here, defendant’s deposition testimony\nconsisted of statements, defendant made the statements, the statements were\noffered against her, and she was a party to this action. Thus, the statements came\nwithin an exception to the hearsay rule. (Id. at p. 898.) They were admissible\nagainst defendant.\n        Next, defendant contends that Dr. Knauss “was permitted to testify beyond\nthe scope of his expertise” both in his initial testimony at the preliminary inquiry\nand before the jury. She did not object on this ground. Indeed, for purposes of the\n\n\n\n                                         64\n\fpreliminary inquiry, defense counsel stipulated that Dr. Knauss “is a qualified\ncourt expert on the failure of viscous materials, including rubbers.” Accordingly,\nthis contention is not cognizable on appeal. (People v. Partida, supra, 37 Cal.4th\nat pp. 433-434.) Moreover, the trial court would have had discretion to admit the\nevidence had defendant objected.\n       Dr. Knauss was a professor at Caltech and had been since 1965. He\nreceived a Ph.D. in aeronautics from Caltech, but “the topic of [his] research has\nbeen ever since [his] graduate, student graduate days, failure and fracture of\npolymers, which includes rubbers.” Of his approximately 150-160 publications,\nabout 25-30 percent concerned the fracture of polymers. He had testified in court\n“as an expert on the failures of rubbers, how rubbers fracture and why they\nfracture” about 30 times.\n       “A person is qualified to testify as an expert if he has special knowledge,\nskill, experience, training, or education sufficient to qualify him as an expert on\nthe subject to which his testimony relates.” (Evid. Code, § 720, subd. (a).)\nDetermining whether a witness qualifies as an expert comes within a trial court’s\ndiscretion. (People v. Eubanks (2011) 53 Cal.4th 110, 140.) Given Dr. Knauss’s\nimpressive qualifications, the trial court certainly had discretion to permit him to\ntestify as an expert regarding the fracture of rubbers such as the rubber in the\npacifier involved in the death of defendant’s infant daughter. Defendant cites\nportions of his testimony, largely on cross-examination, in which, for example, he\ntestified that before he tested the pacifier parts, he had had little or no experience\nwith, specifically, baby pacifiers. But such matters merely go to the weight of Dr.\nKnauss’s testimony, not its admissibility. “Defendant was entitled to attack [the\nexpert’s] credibility regarding the claimed basis of [his] opinion, but questions\nregarding the validity or credibility of an expert’s knowledge go to the weight of\nsuch testimony, not its admissibility.” (People v. Eubanks, supra, at p. 143.) Dr.\n\n                                          65\n\fKnauss was an expert on why and how rubbers fracture, so he was entitled to\nexpress an opinion regarding whether the actions of a baby could have cause the\npacifier at issue to fracture. As in Eubanks, defendant was able to question the\nwitness’s conclusions and the foundation for his opinions through cross-\nexamination and additionally to present her own expert on the same matter. (Ibid.)\n       Defendant did object to some of Dr. Knauss’s testimony at the preliminary\ninquiry on the ground of lack of foundation, once successfully, other times\nunsuccessfully. To the extent defendant bases her argument on these objections,\nthe contention is cognizable. But we see no error here either. Over a lack-of-\nfoundation objection, the court permitted the witness to testify that he would not\nexpect a baby’s teeth to come into contact with the area where the separation\noccurred, given how close that place was to the shield, and that it was “not\nfeasible” for a 13-month-old infant with two teeth to have sucked the pacifier apart\nif it was otherwise intact. The witness explained this opinion in detail, basing it on\nhis experience and his close examination of the pacifier parts. The trial court had\ndiscretion to conclude this opinion was sufficiently founded to go to the jury.\n(People v. Eubanks, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 142.) “When expert opinion is offered,\nmuch must be left to the trial court’s discretion.” (People v. Carpenter (1997) 15\nCal.4th 312, 403.)\n       To the extent defendant argues Dr. Knauss’s testimony was not proper\nopinion because it was based in part on what could be considered common sense\nor common knowledge, such as his testimony that a baby’s teeth would not come\ninto contact with an area of the rubber within a few millimeters of the shield, that\ntoo presents no basis to exclude his testimony. Although an expert’s opinion\ntestimony is limited “to a subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience\nthat the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact” (Evid. Code, § 801,\nsubd. (a)), the jury does not have to be wholly ignorant of the opinion’s subject\n\n                                         66\n\fmatter for it to be admissible. (People v. Edwards (2013) 57 Cal.4th 658, 709;\nPeople v. Farnam (2002) 28 Cal.4th 107, 162-163.) “Here, we cannot say that\n[the expert’s] testimony would not have assisted the jury (Evid. Code, § 801, subd.\n(a)) or that ‘ “it would add nothing at all to the jury’s common fund of\ninformation.” ’ ” (People v. Farnam, supra, at p. 163.) Expert testimony\nregarding what does and does not cause rubber to fracture is sufficiently beyond\ncommon experience to be admissible even if parts of that testimony refer to\nmatters within common knowledge.\n       The court properly permitted both Dr. Knauss and Dr. Hamed to testify and\nlet the jury judge who was more credible.\n       Finally, defendant contends the court erred in not permitting Attorney\nNovak to provide certain expert opinion testimony. Novak testified outside the\njury’s presence that, given the large amount of the settlement ($710,000), he did\nnot believe Gerber settled defendant’s lawsuit merely for its nuisance value. He\ndid not believe the assessment of nuisance value included potential loss of\nreputation to the defendant. But he also testified that he had “never worked as a\ndefense lawyer, so I would speculate as to what they do.” He had “no\ninformation” regarding whether “Gerber had done any projections to see what\nkind of damage a public trial on this incident might cause to their ability to do\nbusiness in the baby industry, whether or not they prevailed in the lawsuit.” He\nhad “no idea what motivated” Gerber in deciding whether to pursue the lawsuit to\nits end.\n       In response to the prosecutor’s objection to this opinion testimony, the\ncourt expressed this concern: “If the suggestion is or at least with this witness’s\nopinion, Mr. Novak, that this was more than nuisance value, he does not, as I\nasked him to define it, take into that definition loss of reputation to Gerber Foods.\nThey may well feel that this was a nuisance case, that they could defeat it, but that\n\n                                         67\n\fin the process they would lose substantial income based on the loss and faith of\nother customers. So not only as to the pacifier but as to their other products, and\nhe does not know to what extent that calculation would enter into the total value\nthat Gerber agreed would be sufficient to make the case go away.” After hearing\nargument from both sides, the court sustained the prosecutor’s objection to the\nquestion “whether this witness believes that settlement was more than for nuisance\nvalue.” It made clear, however, that either side could argue to the jury whether\nthe large settlement was merely for nuisance value.\n       Defendant contends the court erred in not allowing Novak to express his\nopinion regarding nuisance value. This question, too, comes within the trial\ncourt’s discretion, reviewed for abuse of that discretion. (People v. McDowell\n(2012) 54 Cal.4th 395, 426.) We see no abuse of discretion. Attorney Novak\nadmitted he had never been a civil defense attorney and did not know what factors\nmotivated defendants to settle cases. He did not consider potential loss of\nreputation in his definition of “nuisance value,” but he had no information or\nexpertise to support his apparent assumption that corporate defendants and their\nattorneys do not do so. Obviously, $710,000 is a lot of money, and defendant\ncould argue to the jury that Gerber did not settle the case for that amount only for\nits nuisance value. But the trial court had discretion to conclude that Novak had\nno particular expertise that would assist the jury.\n       Moreover, whether Gerber settled the lawsuit for more than nuisance value\n(perhaps suggesting it believed the lawsuit had merit), while probably relevant,\nwas not particularly important. The prosecution’s penalty phase case against\ndefendant was very different from the case Gerber faced. When Gerber settled the\nlawsuit, defendant had not yet murdered her husband to collect on a life insurance\npolicy, a murder that made the earlier death of her insured daughter far more\nsuspicious. The record does not indicate whether Gerber was even aware that\n\n                                          68\n\fdefendant had insured the baby’s life. (The trial court sustained defendant’s\nobjection to the prosecutor’s asking Novak whether Novak was aware of the life\ninsurance policy when he represented defendant.) Gerber also was unaware of Dr.\nKnauss’s report. Accordingly, whether Gerber believed the lawsuit it faced was\nmeritorious had little relevance to the jury’s determination whether defendant\nmurdered her daughter. Any error would have been harmless.\n\n               d. Instructional claims\n       Defendant contends the court committed two errors in instructing the jury.\n       First, she argues that if her deposition testimony was only admissible to\nshow “consciousness of guilt,” the court erred in failing to so instruct the jury.\nHowever, as discussed above (pt. II. C. 2. c.), her deposition testimony was\nadmissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. Accordingly, it was not admitted\nfor a limited purpose such as consciousness of guilt, but for any relevant purpose.\n       Second, defendant contends the court failed to instruct properly regarding\nthe evidence that she murdered her daughter, apparently on the basis that it did not\ninstruct that a juror may consider that evidence only if the juror found beyond a\nreasonable doubt that she committed the murder. (See People v. Robertson (1982)\n33 Cal.3d 21, 53-54.) However, the court instructed the jury that “evidence has\nbeen introduced for the purpose of showing that the defendant has committed the\nfollowing criminal acts: Murder and solicitation of murder, which involved the\nexpress or implied use of force or violence. Before a juror may consider any\ncriminal act as an aggravating circumstance in this case, a juror must first be\nsatisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did in fact commit the\ncriminal act. A juror may not consider any evidence of any other criminal act as\nan aggravating circumstance.” Immediately thereafter, the court defined\n\n\n\n\n                                          69\n\freasonable doubt. Defendant does not explain how these instructions were\ninsufficient. We see no error.\n\n           3. Admission of Another Item of Other Crimes Evidence\n       The prosecution’s pretrial notice of aggravating evidence included\n“defendant’s post-arrest solicitation of the murder of and/or assault upon People’s\nwitnesses Erlinda Allen and Palmira Gorham.” Some of the taped conversations\nthat the prosecution offered into evidence contain references to Allen (who went\nby the name “Linda”) as well as Gorham. Defendant objected to the references to\nAllen. After reviewing the transcripts, the trial court overruled the objection. It\nfound the discussion about Allen was “part of the conversation regarding\nelimination of witnesses. Even though it’s not a charged offense, it does tend to\nsuggest that that’s what she intended to do to carry it out.”\n       Accordingly, the jury heard the following. Erlinda Allen was an inmate\nwhom investigators had interviewed regarding this case. She had once been\nhoused either with or next to defendant in county jail and later served time at a\nprison for women in Chowchilla. In a taped conversation with investigators, Hall\nsaid that defendant had told her she had received a letter from Chowchilla.\nDefendant “want[ed] some people to do somethin’ to Linda . . . in prison and stuff\nlike that.” Hall said that someone had told defendant that “when you have drug\ndebts in prison, if you don’t pay, they . . . go get somebody blood that’s HIV or\nAIDS positive and shoot you in the back with it. And that’s what she wants\nsomebody to do to Linda.” Hall had the impression that defendant expected that\nshe (Hall) would get some friends to do this. In a conversation between Hall and\ndefendant recorded on May 10, 2002, defendant said that at Chowchilla, “they\nhave their own system. They have their own accountability over there. You know\nwhat I mean?” Later in that conversation, defendant said she had “friends at\n\n\n\n                                          70\n\fChowchilla.” In later conversations between Hall and defendant, defendant\nreferred to getting “those two out of the way” (in context referring to Allen and\nGorham), said in reference to Allen that “you know she’s playing herself out.\nRight?” and said that Allen had “already buried herself.”\n        For two reasons, defendant contends the court erred in admitting the\nevidence. We see no abuse of discretion. (People v. Jones, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p.\n380.)\n        First, defendant argues that Allen did not actually testify at the trial. While\ncorrect, this circumstance makes no difference. Defendant had notice that the\nprosecution intended to rely on this evidence. Penalty phase evidence of other\ncrimes is not limited to crimes against witnesses who testify at the trial.\n        Second, defendant contends there was insufficient evidence she committed\na qualifying crime against Allen. Only “criminal activity by the defendant which\ninvolved the use or attempted use of force or violence or the express or implied\nthreat to use force or violence” is admissible. (§ 190.3, factor (b).) Evidence\nunder section 190.3, factor (b), is “limited to evidence of conduct that\ndemonstrates the commission of an actual crime, specifically, the violation of a\npenal statute.” (People v. Phillips, supra, 41 Cal.3d at p. 72.) Although the\nevidence regarding defendant’s intentions as to Allen was not as compelling as the\nevidence regarding Gorham, the trial court had discretion to conclude that, in\ncontext, a reasonable jury could conclude that defendant’s many comments about\nAllen to Hall constituted the solicitation of a crime of violence against Allen.\n(§ 653f; see People v. Wilson (2005) 36 Cal.4th 309, 328.)\n        Moreover, any error in this regard would have been harmless. The\nreferences to Allen pale in significance compared to the compelling evidence that\ndefendant first sought to dissuade Gorham from testifying and later solicited her\nmurder, and even that evidence was far less aggravating than the circumstances of\n\n                                           71\n\fFrank’s murder and the evidence of defendant’s earlier murder of her daughter.\nWe see no reasonable possibility the penalty verdict would have been different had\nthe court ordered all references to Allen redacted from the recorded conversations\nthe jury heard. (People v. McDowell, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 434.)\n\n           4. Asserted Violation of Confrontation Rights\n       Defendant contends her right to confront witnesses was violated on three\noccasions at the penalty phase.\n       First, defendant contends admission of Hall’s statements to law\nenforcement agents prejudiced her at the penalty phase. At defendant’s request,\nduring the penalty phase, Hall testified again, this time outside the jury’s presence.\nAgain she denied any memory of the conversations regarding this case. The court\nagain found untruthful her claim not to remember. It found no reason, and\ndefendant expressed none, to require her to testify again in front of the jury. Later,\nthe jury heard tape recordings of Hall’s conversations with investigators and\ndefendant, authenticated by law enforcement witnesses. As discussed in part\nII. B. 2. b., ante, because Hall testified, defendant’s right to confront her was not\nviolated. We see no need for the court to have required her to testify a second\ntime in front of the jury. Defendant had already confronted Hall at the guilt phase\nand again outside the jury’s presence during the penalty phase. She could have\nbut did not ask that Hall testify again in the jury’s presence.\n       Moreover, any error would have been harmless. Defendant’s recorded\nconversations with Hall and her videotaped meeting in jail with Detective Valdez,\nposing as the fictitious middleman Antonio Davis — evidence presented through\nwitnesses whom defendant confronted — provided far more vivid and convincing\nevidence of defendant’s solicitation of Gorham’s murder than Hall’s statements to\nthe investigators.\n\n\n\n                                          72\n\f       Second, defendant challenges a portion of the testimony regarding the\nautopsy performed on her daughter, Alicia. Dr. Wallace Carroll testified that he\nand his staff performed the autopsy. He had “viewed the body and returned for the\nview of the organs and so forth and reviewed all the dictation and so forth.” He\ntestified that Alicia had two teeth when she died, specifically, the two lower front\nteeth. On cross- and redirect examination, he clarified that Dr. Ducale, an\nassistant who performed the actual autopsy, had made the observation and\nrecorded the note in the autopsy report regarding the teeth. He did not himself\nobserve the teeth.\n       Defendant contends that the statements regarding Alicia’s teeth were\n“testimonial” under Crawford, supra, 541 U.S. 36, and, because she had no\nopportunity to cross-examine Dr. Ducale, her confrontation rights were violated.\nShe did not object on this basis at trial but, because the trial predated Crawford,\nshe may make this argument. (People v. Pearson, supra, 56 Cal.4th at pp. 461-\n462.) The contention, however, lacks merit.\n       Objective observations in an autopsy report, such as the number and\nlocation of the decedent’s teeth, that are not made with a primary purpose of\naiding a criminal investigation, are not testimonial under Crawford, supra, 541\nU.S. 36. (People v. Edwards, supra, 57 Cal.4th at pp. 704-706; People v. Dungo\n(2012) 55 Cal.4th 608, 619-621; see Dungo, at pp. 621-627 (conc. opn. of\nWerdegar, J.), 629-633 (conc. opn. of Chin, J.).) As we explained in Dungo,\nautopsy reports are used not only for criminal investigation and prosecution but\nalso for other purposes. “For example, the decedent’s relatives may use an\nautopsy report in determining whether to file an action for wrongful death.”\n(Dungo, at p. 621.) This example likely applies here. Defendant and her then\nhusband likely used the autopsy report in their wrongful death action against\nGerber. In any event, the autopsy report was not prepared with a primary purpose\n\n                                         73\n\frelated to criminal investigation. And certainly Dr. Ducale did not note the\nnumber and location of the teeth with the primary purpose to further a criminal\ninvestigation. “In summary,” to adapt our discussion in Dungo to this case, Dr.\nCarroll’s “description to the jury of objective facts about the condition of victim\n[Alicia’s] body, facts he derived from [Dr. Ducale’s] autopsy report . . . , did not\ngive defendant a right to confront and cross examine [Dr. Ducale].” (Ibid.)\n       Finally, defendant contends a portion of the prosecution’s cross-\nexamination of Dr. Vicary, the psychiatrist who testified on defendant’s behalf,\nviolated her right to confront her daughter, Autumn. This issue arose under the\nfollowing circumstances.\n       Outside the jury’s presence, the prosecutor alerted the court that\ndefendant’s attorney had asked him to contact Thomas, Autumn’s father and\ndefendant’s former husband, to make Autumn available to testify for the defense.\nThe prosecutor said that Thomas had “expressed to me his vehement objection that\nhis daughter be dragged through this in any way.” He told Thomas that he would\nrepresent “to the court and defense counsel that I would make Autumn available,”\nand that she probably would have to testify. Thomas agreed to bring her to court.\nThe prosecutor also said that if defendant did call Autumn as a witness, “I believe\nit opens the door to cross-examination of Autumn regarding her role in the death\nof Frank Rodriguez the night that he died. She gave us a statement the same day\nthat the defendant was arrested wherein she basically told us that there was a\nspecial bottle of Gatorade for Frank, that she was not allowed to have any, and that\nher mother asked her to help feed Frank the Gatorade, and she did in fact help feed\nFrank the Gatorade the last time he was alive.” The prosecutor believed this\nevidence would be relevant if Autumn testified on defendant’s behalf.\n       The prosecutor later clarified that Autumn had made three statements, all of\nwhich he had provided the defense in discovery. The first two were largely\n\n                                          74\n\fconsistent with each other and stated what he had represented. In the third, much\nmore recent, statement, “her story had changed significantly.” Because of this\nchange, and because of “concerns about her emotional state being involved as a\nwitness for the prosecution in a death penalty case involving her mother,” he had\ndecided not to call Autumn as his own witness. But he argued that, if defendant\ncalled her as a witness, he could cross-examine her about her earlier statements\nand, if necessary, admit them as prior inconsistent statements.\n       Defense counsel argued that defendant had a right to call Autumn as a\nwitness even over Thomas’s objection, and that if Autumn’s testimony were\nnarrow enough in scope, the prosecutor should not be allowed to cross-examine\nher regarding these statements. The court agreed defendant had the right to call\nAutumn as a witness. It also tentatively indicated that if defendant did call her as\na witness, the prosecutor could cross-examine her regarding her prior statement. It\nagreed, however, to hold a hearing on the question.\n       The next day, Thomas addressed the court and expressed concerns about\nAutumn’s testifying. While sympathetic with Thomas’s concerns, the court ruled\nthat defendant had the right to call her as a witness. The prosecutor stated that if\nher testimony were limited and not too emotional, he “would refrain, in the\ninterest of [Thomas’s] concerns and also concerns I have for Autumn, from going\ninto [her prior statements], although I really want to reserve my final decision until\nI see just where direct goes.”\n       Autumn then testified very briefly in front of the jury as a defense witness.\nShe said she “would like it for you [the jury] not to execute [defendant] and make\nit so I can see her.” The prosecutor did not cross-examine her.\n       Later, Dr. Vicary testified for defendant. On direct examination, he said he\nbased his expert opinion on various sources of information, including interviews\nwith defendant, her mother, her sister, and her cousin. Among the many\n\n                                          75\n\fdocuments he reviewed in forming his opinion was Dr. Romanoff’s “very\nthorough and very lengthy” psychological evaluation of defendant. When asked\nwhether certain factors would prevent defendant from being a loving mother, he\nresponded that he “found her to be the most emotional and the most animated\nwhen she was talking about her children. She said in all her life, none of her\nrelationships had ever worked, and that she had only two happy experiences, the\nbirth of her two little girls.” History that her relatives supplied indicated that\n“defendant was a very attentive, loving, supportive mother.”\n       On cross-examination, Dr. Vicary reiterated that he had relied on Dr.\nRomanoff’s evaluation, which was based partly on defendant’s own statements.\nThe prosecutor cross-examined Dr. Vicary extensively about this evaluation,\nincluding various lies that defendant had told Dr. Romanoff as reported in the\nevaluation. At one point, the prosecutor asked whether Dr. Romanoff had\nconfronted defendant with a police report that “indicated that her daughter had\nbeen interviewed and had told the police that her mother had fed her . . . step-\nfather Gatorade and that she had been told by her mother she couldn’t have any of\nthat Gatorade.” Dr. Vicary testified that Dr. Romanoff had so confronted\ndefendant. The explanation defendant gave Dr. Romanoff for not letting Autumn\nhave any Gatorade was “because money was so tight and we needed the Gatorade\nfor him.” Dr. Vicary agreed that this was another lie that defendant had told Dr.\nRomanoff.\n       Later, the prosecutor cross-examined Dr. Vicary regarding his opinion that\ndefendant was a loving mother. He asked whether Dr. Vicary was aware that\nAutumn had told investigators that the night Frank died, “her mother made him\ndrink a whole bottle of red Gatorade,” and that she (Autumn) “had helped her\nmother feed him the Gatorade.” Dr. Vicary answered that he was aware of that\nand said that defendant’s using her nine-year-old daughter as an unwitting\n\n                                          76\n\faccomplice in the murder was a “horrible, indefensible act.” However,\n“considering all the data,” this circumstance did not alter his opinion that\ndefendant was a loving and supportive mother.\n       Defendant contends that the prosecutor’s cross-examining Dr. Vicary\nregarding Autumn’s statements violated her right to confront Autumn. Again, she\ndid not object on this basis at trial, but she can argue that the testimony violated\nher rights under Crawford, supra, 541 U.S. 36.\n       If Autumn’s statements had been offered and used as substantive evidence\nfor their truth — that is, if the prosecution had used these statements as affirmative\nevidence to show aggravating circumstances of the crime — state law would\nclearly have been violated. The statements were hearsay and no exception to the\nhearsay rule appears. But the prosecutor did not offer or use the statements as\nsubstantive evidence but for a nonhearsay purpose that California law has long\npermitted.\n       Under state law, an expert such as a psychiatrist may rely on various\nsources of information, including hearsay, in forming an opinion, and a party may\nquestion that expert about that information to test the expert’s credibility. “A\nparty ‘may cross-examine an expert witness more extensively and searchingly than\na lay witness, and the prosecution was entitled to attempt to discredit the expert’s\nopinion. [Citation.] In cross-examining a psychiatric expert witness, the\nprosecutor’s good faith questions are proper even when they are, of necessity,\nbased on facts not in evidence.’ ” (People v. Wilson, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 358,\nquoting People v. Dennis (1998) 17 Cal.4th 468, 519.) This court explained the\nreasons for this rule long ago. “ ‘ “Once an expert offers his opinion, however, he\nexposes himself to the kind of inquiry which ordinarily would have no place in the\ncross-examination of a factual witness. The expert invites investigation into the\nextent of his knowledge, the reasons for his opinion including facts and other\n\n                                          77\n\fmatters upon which it is based [citation], and which he took into consideration;\nand he may be ‘subjected to the most rigid cross-examination’ concerning his\nqualifications, and his opinion and its sources [citation].” (Italics added.)’ ”\n(People v. Nye (1969) 71 Cal.2d 356, 374-375.)\n       The prosecutor used Autumn’s statements in cross-examining Dr. Vicary\nexactly and only as this rule permits. Dr. Vicary based his opinion on many\nhearsay sources, including interviews with defendant and Dr. Romanoff’s\nevaluation. Under state law, the prosecutor was entitled to explore with Dr.\nVicary occasions in which he had reason to believe defendant had lied, to attempt\nto discredit his reliance on defendant’s other statements, and to attempt to discredit\nDr. Vicary’s opinion that defendant was a loving mother by establishing that he\nmaintained that opinion despite his knowledge of Autumn’s statements.\n       Contrary to defendant’s contention, in arguing the case to the jury, the\nprosecutor cited Autumn’s statements only for this nonhearsay purpose. Indeed, at\ndefense request, the court conducted a hearing outside the jury’s presence\nregarding how the prosecutor could discuss Autumn’s statements in front of the\njury. The prosecutor agreed he could not use these statements as substantive\nevidence but only to challenge Dr. Vicary’s credibility. After this hearing, in\nargument to the jury, the prosecutor referred to the statements in discussing how\nmuch weight the jury should give defendant’s evidence in mitigation.\nSpecifically, he argued that Dr. Vicary’s opinion that defendant was a good\nmother should not be credited when he adhered to that opinion despite knowing of\nAutumn’s statements. He did not argue that Autumn’s statements constituted\nsubstantive evidence of aggravating circumstances of the crime.\n       The court did not give an instruction limiting the use the jury could make of\nthis cross-examination. Defendant did not request one, and the court has no duty\nto give a limiting instruction absent a request. (People v. Maury (2003) 30 Cal.4th\n\n                                          78\n\f342, 394.) As it was, the jury merely heard a few questions regarding Autumn’s\nstatements during a lengthy cross-examination of the defense expert and a brief,\nlimited mention in the prosecutor’s argument regarding that expert’s credibility.\nDefense counsel could reasonably not have wanted the court to give a limiting\ninstruction, which might have suggested to the jury that, logically if not legally,\nthe evidence was aggravating.\n       We need not decide whether and, if so, how Crawford, supra, 341 U.S. 36,\nand its progeny have affected the rule permitting cross-examination of experts for\nthis nonhearsay purpose. Under the unusual facts of this case, we see no denial of\ndefendant’s opportunity to cross-examine Autumn. Knowing of Autumn’s prior\nstatements (and presumably of the rule permitting wide-ranging cross-examination\nof expert witnesses), defendant called Autumn as her own witness. She had full\nopportunity to examine her on her statements, either at that time or later. That she\ndid not take advantage of this opportunity is understandable; if she had actually\nconfronted Autumn about the statements, the jury could have considered them for\ntheir truth and not merely as they bore on Dr. Vicary’s credibility, and the jury\nwould likely have credited them. From defendant’s perspective, no doubt, the less\nsaid of those statements, the better. But she did have the opportunity to examine\nAutumn in any way she may have wished.\n       In any event, any improper use of Autumn’s statements would have been\nharmless. We see no reasonable possibility the jury’s penalty decision turned on\nwhether it believed defendant gave Autumn some of the Gatorade to give to Frank.\nOr, to state the equivalent (People v. Gonzalez (2006) 38 Cal.4th 932, 961), any\nerror would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n\n\n                                          79\n\f           5. Argument and Instructions Regarding the Mitigating Effect of an\n               Emotional or Mental Disturbance\n       The trial court instructed the jury regarding the statutory factors it should\nconsider in its penalty determination, including factor (d) of section 190.3:\n“Whether or not the offense was committed while the defendant was under the\ninfluence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.” It also gave the expanded\ncatchall instruction under section 190.3, factor (k), that we recommended in\nPeople v. Easley (1983) 34 Cal.3d 858, 878, footnote 10. Specifically, it\ninstructed the jury to consider “any other circumstance which extenuates the\ngravity of the crime, even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime, and any\nsympathetic or other aspect of the defendant’s character or record that the\ndefendant offers as a basis for a sentence less than death, whether or not related to\nthe offense for which she is on trial.”\n       Defendant contends the court erred in referring to an “extreme” mental or\nemotional disturbance because the reference prevented the jury from considering a\nmental or emotional disturbance that was less than extreme. We have repeatedly\nrejected the contention because the catchall instruction permits the jury to consider\nany evidence the defendant offers in mitigation, including any lesser mental or\nemotional disturbance. (E.g., People v. Moore (2011) 51 Cal.4th 386, 416-417;\nsee Blystone v. Pennsylvania (1990) 494 U.S. 299, 308 [upholding a similar\nPennsylvania instruction against a similar attack for similar reasons]; Boyde v.\nCalifornia (1990) 494 U.S. 370, 381-386 [upholding a catchall instruction\narguably narrower than the one given here].)\n       Defendant argues that the prosecutor’s argument to the jury was misleading\nand made it reasonably likely the jury believed it could not consider in mitigation\nany mental or emotional disturbance that was less than extreme. We disagree.\nThe prosecutor argued that defendant had presented no evidence of extreme\n\n\n\n                                          80\n\fmental or emotional disturbance under section 190.3, factor (d). Indeed, he argued\nthere was no “evidence in this case of any mental disease or intoxication. Dr.\nVicary didn’t talk to you about any mental disease. He didn’t give any clinical\ndiagnosis she was pathological in some sense or psychotic or [had] no impulse\ncontrol. She has no such mental disease.” This was a fair comment on the\nevidence. “Nothing in the prosecutor’s argument or the court’s instructions . . .\nprecluded the jury from considering the evidence of defendant’s mental\nimpairments, whether under factor (d) (to the extent jurors disagreed with the\nprosecutor’s assessment of the impairments as less than extreme), section 190.3,\nfactor (h) (referring to ‘mental disease or defect’ as potentially impairing\ndefendant’s ability to appreciate the criminality of [her] conduct or conform it to\nthe law’s requirements) or the catchall factor (k).” (People v. Moore, supra, 51\nCal.4th at p. 416.) Indeed, the prosecutor specifically told the jury that under the\n“catchall provision,” it could “consider any other extenuating circumstance that\nyou find to be present in this case.”\n       “As defendant was neither prevented from introducing evidence of mental\nimpairment, nor precluded from arguing its relevance and force as mitigation, or\nfrom having it considered as such, we see no infringement on defendant’s rights\nunder the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution.” (People v. Moore, supra, 51 Cal.4th at pp. 416-417.)\n\n           6. Denial of the Automatic Motion to Modify the Verdict\n       Defendant contends the court erred in denying her automatic motion to\nmodify the jury’s verdict of death. “In ruling on defendant’s application for\nmodification of the verdict, the trial court must reweigh the evidence; consider the\naggravating and mitigating circumstances; and determine whether, in its\nindependent judgment, the weight of the evidence supports the jury’s verdict.\n\n\n\n                                          81\n\f[Citation.] On appeal, although the trial court’s ruling is subject to independent\nreview, we do not make a de novo determination of penalty.” (People v. Brady\n(2010) 50 Cal.4th 547, 588.)\n       Defendant’s written motion to modify the verdict contained a supplemental\nreport by Dr. Vicary stating, in part, Dr. Vicary’s belief that defendant was\ngenuinely remorseful for the crime. In arguing the motion, defense counsel\nreferred to the report, including its opinion regarding defendant’s remorse. The\ncourt interjected: “How do you square what the doctor has said, Dr. Vicary’s\n[supplemental] report . . . , where he says the defendant does have remorse for the\nmurder of her husband . . . ? There’s been no indication of remorse at all during\nthe trial, and in fact it’s hard to believe that there would be any remorse. He was\nonly married for a few months when she created the circumstances under which he\nreceived a $250,000 life insurance with her as a beneficiary, and two months after\nthat roughly attempts to kill him through the use of loosening the gas connection,\nwhich also endangered not only her husband but also the community around her\nhusband in the event that there had been an explosion, then attempting to poison\nhim with oleander poisoning, and on the failure of that a week later poisoning him\nfor a long period of time with antifreeze. And I have to say it is the coldest killing\nI’ve ever seen. Most of the murders, and most of the cases we have are murder\ncases in this court, over the past 20 years I’ve never seen a colder heart. She\nseemed to have no care for the agony that she put her husband through, and the\nsole goal being to make a profit in his death. So I don’t see how the doctor’s\nopinion squares with any of the evidence that I’ve seen throughout this trial.”\n       After the parties argued the matter, the court permitted defendant to address\nit personally, and she did so at length. Thereafter, the court denied the motion in a\ndetailed oral ruling that was also memorialized in a written order filed the same\nday.\n\n                                          82\n\f       Defendant contends the court erred in several regards. Because she failed\nto object on these — or any — grounds, and because the modification hearing\npostdated our decision in People v. Hill (1992) 3 Cal.4th 959, she has forfeited\nthese claims. (People v. Brady, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 588.) Moreover, the claims\nlack merit.\n       Defendant contends “the trial court failed to follow the legal requirements\nin denying the motion.” On the contrary, except possibly by considering Dr.\nVicary’s supplemental report, it followed the legal requirements precisely. It\nexpressly recognized its duty “to reweigh the evidence of aggravating and\nmitigating facts and to determine whether in the court’s independent judgment the\nweight of the evidence supports the jury verdict.” It “reviewed the testimony\npresented through an examination of the transcript as well as the court’s own\nextensive notes, has reassessed the credibility of witnesses and evaluated the\nprobative value and force and weight of the evidence and has reviewed the\nexhibits.” It found the prosecution witnesses credible and the proof of defendant’s\nguilt “overwhelming.” It also found, under its independent review, that “the jury’s\nimplicit finding that the circumstances in aggravation substantially outweigh the\ncircumstances in mitigation, warranting the penalty of death as to defendant\nAngelina Rodriguez, is overwhelmingly supported by the evidence.” It reviewed\nall of the statutory aggravating and mitigating factors, including the catchall factor\nprovided in section 190.3, factor (k). It concluded: “In reviewing all of the\nevidence available pursuant to section 190.3 of the Penal Code, and in carefully\nand separately weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors, this court finds\nthat the aggravating evidence as to defendant Angelina Rodriguez . . . did so\nsubstantially outweigh the mitigating evidence that it warrants the imposition of\ndeath instead of life without parole as determined by the jury.”\n\n\n\n                                          83\n\f        It is true, as defendant argues, that the court is supposed to consider only\nthe evidence before the jury. (People v. Brown (1993) 6 Cal.4th 322, 337.) But to\nthe extent, if any, the court considered, at defendant’s request, Dr. Vicary’s\nbelated opinion regarding remorse (to reject that opinion), any error could not\nhave prejudiced defendant. The court considered no other evidence not before the\njury.\n        Defendant contends the court “minimized the mitigating factors or ignored\nthem entirely while exaggerating the aggravating factors and giving them undue\nweight.” It did not do so. It viewed the factors differently than defendant would\nhave it do, but it did consider all the evidence and reached a reasonable\nconclusion. The court must consider all of the evidence, but it need not give any\nparticular weight or, indeed, any weight to any particular evidence offered in\nmitigation. (People v. Scott (1997) 15 Cal.4th 1188, 1222.)\n        It appears that, after engaging in some give and take with defense counsel\nand defendant, the court read a prewritten ruling denying the motion. Defendant\ncontends this shows the court prejudged its decision and failed to consider the\narguments at the hearing. “We disagree. The practice of formulating tentative\nrulings in advance of argument and reducing those tentative rulings to writing is\ncommonplace and unobjectionable. [Citing People v. Hayes (1990) 52 Cal.3d\n577, 644-645.] . . . ‘To do so does not mean that the court is unalterably bound by\nthe writing or that it will not amend or even discard the writing if counsel’s\narguments persuade the court that its tentative views were incorrect. Nothing in\nthe record indicates that the trial court failed to give due consideration to defense\ncounsel’s argument at the hearing.’ (Id. at p. 645.)” (People v. Medina (1995) 11\nCal.4th 694, 783.) The court apparently wanted to ensure that if it denied the\nmotion, it did so without inadvertently omitting any of the technical requirements.\n(See People v. Seaton (2001) 26 Cal.4th 598, 696.)\n\n                                          84\n\f       Defendant also contends the court’s comments when defense counsel cited\nDr. Vicary’s supplemental report showed it improperly considered her lack of\nremorse as an aggravating factor. However, those comments showed only that it\nrejected defendant’s claim of remorse as a mitigating factor, not that it considered\nlack of remorse in aggravation. Moreover, the court could properly have\nconsidered in aggravation the facts it cited. The court did not cite defendant’s\nmere failure to express remorse; it cited her actions showing overt remorselessness\nat or near the time of the crime, a proper aggravating circumstance. “Overt\nremorselessness is a statutory sentencing factor in that context, because factor (a)\nof section 190.3 allows the sentencer to evaluate all aggravating and mitigating\naspects of the capital crime itself. Moreover, there is nothing inherent in the issue\nof remorse which makes it mitigating only. The defendant’s overt indifference or\ncallousness toward his misdeed bears significantly on the moral decision whether\na greater punishment, rather than a lesser, should be imposed. [Citation.] [¶] On\nthe other hand, postcrime evidence of remorselessness does not fit within any\nstatutory sentencing factor, and thus should not be urged as aggravating.” (People\nv. Gonzalez (1990) 51 Cal.3d 1179, 1232; see People v. Cain (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1,\n77 [“From the evidence that defendant, still bloody from the killings, returned to\nhis friends and boasted of what he had just done, the jury could infer his attitude\nduring the crimes was one of callousness towards the victims.”].)\n       Here, the court cited defendant’s actions, rather than mere words. After\ndefendant tried to kill her husband by loosening the gas valves, she tried a second\ntime, giving him enough oleander to send him to the emergency room. Her\nhusband became very ill but did not die. Rather than feel remorse for what she put\nhim through, she tried a third time, this time giving him several times the amount\nof poison (both oleander and antifreeze) needed to kill him. These actions overtly\n\n\n\n                                         85\n\fshowed this was truly a remorseless murder or, as the court put it, among the\n“coldest” of killings. These were relevant aggravating circumstances of the crime.\n        The court properly denied the motion to modify the verdict.\n\n            7. Other Contentions\n        Defendant makes several other contentions, most of which we have\nrepeatedly rejected. We see no reason to reconsider our previous decisions.\n        Except regarding evidence of other crimes, jurors need not find aggravating\nfactors true beyond a reasonable doubt; no instruction on burden of proof is\nneeded; except for the verdict itself, the jury need not achieve unanimity; and the\njury need not make written findings. (People v. Rountree (2013) 56 Cal.4th 823,\n862.) “CALJIC No. 8.88’s use of the words ‘so substantial,’ its use of the word\n‘warrants’ instead of ‘appropriate,’ its failure to instruct the jury that a sentence of\nlife is mandatory if mitigation outweighs aggravation, and its failure to instruct the\njury on a ‘presumption of life’ does not render the instruction invalid.” (Id. at pp.\n862-863.) “Intercase proportionality review is not required.” (Id. at p. 862.)7\n“ ‘International law does not prohibit a sentence of death rendered in accordance\nwith state and federal constitutional and statutory requirements.’ ” (Rountree, at p.\n863.)\n\n\n7       We do provide intracase proportionality review. (People v. Rountree,\nsupra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 860.) Defendant does not specifically request such review,\nbut it would not aid her. She murdered her husband by poisoning him on her third\nattempt to collect on a life insurance policy she insisted he take out, then tried to\ndissuade a witness from testifying and later solicited that witness’s murder. The\njury could reasonably have found that several years earlier, defendant similarly\nmurdered her infant daughter to collect on another life insurance policy she had\ntaken out on that daughter. The sentence of death is not disproportionate to\ndefendant’s personal culpability. It does not shock the conscience. (People v.\nRountree, supra, at p. 862.)\n\n\n\n                                           86\n\f       Contrary to defendant’s argument, the cumulative effect of the asserted\nerrors does not require reversal of the death judgment. Defendant argues that we\nshould excuse any failure by defense counsel to object to any jury instruction. We\nhave found no instructional claim forfeited. She also argues that “this court should\nreview all errors on the merits, rather than invoking procedural bars, because death\nis the ultimate penalty.” However, procedural rules, such as the statutory\nrequirement that a party object to evidence at trial in order to challenge its\nadmissibility on appeal (Evid. Code, § 353), apply to capital cases as well as other\ncases. (People v. Richardson (2008) 43 Cal.4th 959, 984, fn. 11.)\n       Finally, “Defendant asks that we deem incorporated by reference any\nargument [she] has raised in [her] petition for habeas corpus but which, in\nreviewing that petition, we may decide should have been raised on appeal. We\ndecline to do so. The rules of court do not permit such incorporation. [Citation.]\nMoreover, ‘habeas corpus cannot serve as a substitute for an appeal, and, in the\nabsence of special circumstances constituting an excuse for failure to employ that\nremedy, the writ will not lie where the claimed errors could have been, but were\nnot, raised upon a timely appeal from a judgment of conviction.’ ” (People v.\nRichardson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 1038.)\n                                 III. CONCLUSION\n       We affirm the judgment.\n\n                                                                 CHIN, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\nCANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.J.\nKENNARD, J.\nBAXTER, J.\nWERDEGAR, J.\nCORRIGAN, J.\nLIU, J.\n\n\n                                          87\n\fSee next page for addresses and telephone numbers for counsel who argued in Supreme Court.\n\nName of Opinion People v.

Ct. No. BA213120\n____________________________________)\n\n\n        A jury convicted defendant Angelina Rodriguez of the first degree murder\nof her husband, Jose Francisco Rodriguez, under the special circumstances of\nmurder by administering poison and murder for financial gain, and of one count of\nattempting to dissuade a witness. (Pen. Code, §§ 136.1, subd. (a)(2), 187, 190.2,\nsubd. (a)(1), (19).)1 The jury was unable to reach a verdict on a charge of\nsoliciting murder, and the court declared a mistrial on that count. After a penalty\ntrial, at which the prosecution presented evidence that defendant had murdered her\ninfant daughter several years previously, the jury returned a verdict of death. The\ncourt denied the automatic motion to modify the verdict and imposed that\nsentence. This appeal is automatic. (§ 1239, subd. (b).) We affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise\nindicated.\n\f                                   I. THE FACTS\n\n       A. Guilt Phase\n\n           1. Overview\n       The evidence showed that in September 2000, on her second attempt,\ndefendant fatally poisoned her husband, Jose Francisco Rodriguez, by giving him\ndrinks containing oleander and antifreeze in order to collect on a life insurance\npolicy she had insisted the two take out a few months earlier. Previously, she had\ntried to kill him by loosening natural gas valves in their garage. From her jail cell\nwhile awaiting trial for the murder, she attempted to dissuade a witness from\ntestifying against her. Evidence was also presented that later she solicited that\nwitness’s murder.\n\n           2. The Events Leading to the Victim’s Death\n       Defendant met her future husband, known as “Frank,” in February 2000,\nwhile they were employed at Angel Gate Academy (Academy) in San Luis\nObispo.2 The Academy was a partnership program of the California National\nGuard and the Los Angeles Unified School District which hosted district students\nat a camp for a month. Defendant described the Academy to police investigators\nas a “four week boot type camp for troubled youth.”\n       Frank and defendant were married on April 8. Shortly after the wedding,\nFrank got a job teaching in the Los Angeles Unified School District, and they\nmoved to Montebello. Defendant’s then nine-year-old daughter by a previous\nmarriage, Autumn F. (Autumn), lived with them.\n\n\n\n2      Because defendant and the victim have the same last name, we will refer to\nthe victim as Frank to avoid confusion. Unless otherwise indicated, all dates are in\nthe year 2000.\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f       In July, defendant and Frank took out a $250,000 life insurance policy on\nFrank’s life from the Midland National Life Insurance Company. Defendant was\nnamed the primary beneficiary. Mickey Marracino, the agent who sold them the\npolicy, testified that defendant had written to him in response to a direct mailing\nadvertisement. He then called her to make an appointment to see them.\nMarracino met the couple at their home on July 15. Marracino heard Frank ask\ndefendant “why she felt that they needed the insurance” in light of the fact that\nthey were already covered at work and through the National Guard. Defendant\nexplained to Frank the benefits of life insurance and why she felt they needed it.\nFrank still hesitated, but then told Marracino to “write it up.” Frank took the\nnecessary physical examination on July 18, and the policy was approved on July\n26. Frank and defendant also discussed insuring defendant’s life for $50,000, but\nthat policy was never finalized.\n       Palmira Gorham, a friend of defendant’s during this time, testified that after\nthe marriage, defendant often visited her in Paso Robles without Frank and\nexpressed unhappiness with her marriage. Sometime around mid-June or mid-\nJuly, Gorham and defendant had a conversation at Gorham’s home in which\ndefendant “was telling me how unhappy she was with Frank.” Gorham said\njokingly, “Why don’t you divorce this one like you divorced all your other ones?”\nDefendant responded, “No, this one has got [a] life insurance policy,” and “[t]hat\nmight be worth my time to do that.” She said something like, “If I were to kill\nhim, at least I’d end up with a little bit of money.” Later, Gorham’s mother joined\nthe conversation, and the two told defendant a story about a woman who had tried\nto kill her husband by giving him “oleander tea.” Gorham did not take the\nconversation seriously.\n       A day or so after this conversation, Gorham and her boyfriend spoke with\ndefendant about a dog that had bitten Gorham’s son and Gorham’s frustration with\n\n                                          3\n\fthe police response. At one point, the boyfriend commented that “we could just\nsoak some hot dogs in antifreeze and throw it over the fence.” When defendant\nasked why, Gorham told her “that we had seen something on TV that antifreeze\nhas like kind of a sweet taste and it’s really colorful, so it’s like bright pink or\ngreen, . . . and that children and animals, they would drink it without thinking\ntwice.”\n       A couple of weeks later, when defendant was at her home in Montebello,\nGorham spoke with her on the telephone. Gorham heard a blender running in the\nbackground and asked what defendant was doing. Defendant responded that “she\nwas making Frank a special milkshake.” In the past, defendant had told Gorham\nthat Frank liked to have milkshakes when he was ill. So Gorham asked defendant\nif Frank was sick. She responded, “Not yet.”\n       Loran Moranes was Gorham’s nephew, although he was older than she. He\ngot out of jail on July 17 and began a relationship with defendant that became\nsexual on August 26. Defendant visited him regularly in Paso Robles, beginning\nwhile Frank was still alive. Moranes testified that about a week before Frank died,\ndefendant was with him in Paso Robles. She told Moranes that she had “left some\nkind of gas on in the garage” in Montebello so that Frank “would die.” She said\nthat “either there would be some kind of explosion in the house or he would go in\nthere and pass out.”\n       Because he did not want to get involved, Moranes did not tell investigators\nabout this conversation until July 2001, long after defendant’s arrest. When the\ninvestigators heard of this, they checked records from Southern California Gas\nCompany, the company that serviced defendant’s home. The records showed that\non September 3, the Sunday of Labor Day weekend, Frank had reported a gas leak\nat his and defendant’s Montebello home. Luis Aguilar, a company service\ntechnician, responded to the report and spoke with Frank. Aguilar found two gas\n\n                                            4\n\fleaks in the garage, one behind the clothes dryer and one on the water heater. The\nvalve fitting on the dryer was “very loose,” which would not have happened on its\nown.\n       On Tuesday, September 5, the day after Labor Day, Frank traveled by bus\nto Angel Gate Academy as chaperone for students from his school who were to\nparticipate in the program there. After dropping the students off at the Academy,\nFrank returned home the same day. He had been a late addition to the group of\nteachers who accompanied the students, and his name was not placed on the list of\nteachers who were coming that was given to employees at the Academy.\n       On Thursday, September 7, Frank, accompanied by defendant, went to the\nemergency room at Kaiser Hospital in Baldwin Park complaining of vomiting and\ndiarrhea. The treating physician diagnosed the cause as food poisoning.\nDefendant voiced no suspicion that Frank had been intentionally poisoned. The\ndoctor discharged Frank that afternoon. When he did so, he wrote on a standard\ninstruction sheet that Frank should drink a lot of fluids and, specifically, “drink\nGatorade as a re-hydration.” Defendant signed the instructions, indicating that she\nhad received them.\n\n           3. The Victim’s Death and Aftermath\n       At 3:19 a.m. on Saturday, September 9, Montebello Police Officer Stephen\nSharpe, responding to a call from defendant’s home at 837 Marconi Street, found\nFrank’s body lying facedown on the carpet in the bedroom. He observed blood on\nthe carpet that apparently came from the victim’s nose but could detect no\napparent cause of death. Defendant identified the man as her husband. Officer\nSharpe testified that defendant’s crying “seemed rehearsed or kind of forced”;\n“[a]lthough it was audible, the crying noise, there was a lack of tears, and as soon\nas I would talk to her, ask her a question, she would immediately kind of snap out\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fof it and answer the questions real quick, and in my experience . . . usually\nsomeone who just lost their husband, they’re very difficult to speak with and\ncommunicate to.”\n       The initial autopsy did not reveal the cause of death. The body contained\nno sign of trauma. Frank was 41 years old when he died and had been in generally\ngood health.\n       At 10:17 a.m., the morning Frank died, defendant called Marracino, the life\ninsurance agent, and left a message for him to call her back. When he returned her\ncall a short time later, she reported her husband’s death and inquired about getting\nthe $250,000 payment on the policy on Frank’s life. Marracino informed her that\nthe company would need an official death certificate showing the cause of death.\nHe also explained that when the death occurs during the first two years after the\npolicy was issued, the company will investigate the claim to determine if it is\nlegitimate. During the conversation, Marracino noticed that defendant spoke\nwithout emotion. “It was sort of matter of fact the way she was talking to me and\nexplaining everything. She didn’t cry, she didn’t hesitate in any way, she didn’t\nlose any train of thought . . . .”\n       Marracino reported Frank’s death to the insurance company the same day.\nHe had several other conversations with defendant over the next few weeks in\nwhich she repeatedly asked when she would get paid. He kept advising her the\ncompany needed a cause of death.\n       Rebecca Perkins, Frank’s sister, who lived in Florida, learned of Frank’s\ndeath from her mother, Janet Baker. Around noon the day of his death (9:00 a.m.\nCalifornia time), she telephoned defendant and asked what had happened.\nDefendant responded, “He drank too much.” Perkins was surprised because Frank\ndid not drink alcohol. Defendant went on to say that Frank had been sick on\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fWednesday and Thursday, and she took him to the hospital on Friday. She said\nFrank had died of a “stomach infection.”\n       A short time after this conversation, Perkins called defendant again. This\ntime, defendant told her that “the people at the Angel Gate Academy gave him\ncookies and Gatorade and that killed him.” She also said “that she thought it was\nthe people at Angel Gate this time who had killed him, and months ago in June\nthat it was the students at his middle school that had tried to poison him.”\nRegarding why someone at Angel Gate Academy would want to kill Frank,\ndefendant said “that she was terminated and she left on a bad note and therefore\nthey didn’t like Frank and so they wanted to kill him.” Perkins testified that\nduring both of these conversations, defendant “had no emotion.”\n       Frank’s other sister, Shirley Coers, spoke with defendant the day after his\ndeath. Defendant said she “wanted to cremate him and sprinkle his ashes on a\nbeach that she said was their favorite place to go.” Later defendant told her that\nFrank might have a military burial. In another conversation, defendant told Coers\nthat an officer at Angel Gate Academy had killed Frank when Frank had gone\nthere for a meeting. She said the officer “put some kind of poison in his cookies\nand Gatorade.” Coers asked defendant how someone could poison another person.\nDefendant said there are many ways; for example, one can make a tea with\noleander. On Tuesday, September 19, Coers drove with defendant and others in a\nlimousine to Frank’s funeral. On the way, defendant pointed at some bushes on\nthe side of the road and said, “That’s oleander.”\n       Elaine Nash, an employee with the Midland National Life Insurance\nCompany, spoke with defendant several times, beginning on September 28,\nregarding defendant’s efforts to collect the insurance money. Nash told defendant\nthe company needed a death certificate stating a cause of death, and it would take\nabout four to six weeks to process the claim after they received the certificate. She\n\n                                           7\n\falso explained that the company would conduct its own investigation because the\ndeath had occurred within two years of issuing the policy. Defendant told her the\nautopsy was being done but the toxicology had not been completed. Later,\ndefendant asked Nash to fax her the claim forms. Nash said she could not do so in\nthe case of a contested claim. Nash also declined defendant’s request to verify to a\nreal estate agent that the funds would be available so she could buy a house. The\ncompany never paid the insurance benefits.\n\n           4. The Investigation\n       Montebello Police Detective Gregory Wilsey was the original investigator\ninto Frank’s death. On September 11, the Monday after Frank died, he received a\ntelephone call from defendant asking about the coroner’s office and how it would\ndispose of the body. He told her that the coroner had not determined the cause of\ndeath, and any information they could receive regarding what Frank might have\ningested would help to narrow the possibilities. She told him that she believed\nsomeone at Angel Gate Academy in San Luis Obispo might have poisoned him.\nShe said that “earlier that year that they had . . . blown a whistle on somebody who\nhad committed — suspected of child abuse on one of the students or children up\nthere, and because of that some people got fired, some people got reassigned and\nshe felt that there was some animosity towards her husband over that.” She said\nFrank had gone to the Academy some days before his death to chaperone\ndisadvantaged youths who were going there. During this conversation, Detective\nWilsey was struck by defendant’s lack of emotion.\n       On September 14, the case was referred to the Los Angeles County\nSheriff’s Department and assigned to Detective Brian Steinwand and Sergeant Joe\nHolmes. Detective Steinwand testified that defendant had been a suspect in\nFrank’s death from the beginning, but they did not tell her that. They pretended to\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\fbelieve her story that someone at Angel Gate Academy had poisoned Frank in\norder to try to get her to talk and provide information. In fact, they never\nsuspected anyone at the Academy of poisoning Frank. Beginning on September\n14, the investigators had numerous conversations with defendant that they\nsurreptitiously tape-recorded. Relevant portions of several of the conversations\nwere played to the jury.\n       Defendant told the investigators she believed a man at Angel Gate\nAcademy named Charles “Chad” Holloway had poisoned Frank. She said that she\nand Frank had blown the whistle on Holloway for inappropriate behavior with\nsome of the students at the Academy. She said that on September 5, Frank had\ngone to the Academy as a chaperone. When he returned home, he told her that\nsomeone there had given him Gatorade and cookies. Defendant also talked about\nthe life insurance policy and said that the company would not pay the claim until it\nhad been advised of the cause of death. She asked if the investigators could help\nget the coroner’s office to do what was necessary to determine a cause of death so\nshe could receive the money.\n       On September 26, Janet Baker, Frank’s mother, informed Sergeant Holmes\nthat defendant had said something about oleander. This was the first mention of\noleander as a possible poison in the case. Detective Steinwand informed the\ncoroner’s office of the possibility of oleander poisoning. However, no test for\noleander was conducted at that time, apparently because very few laboratories can\nperform such a test. A large oleander bush, easily accessible to defendant, grew\nover the fence in the backyard of her Montebello home.\n       During this time, defendant frequently asked the investigators about efforts\nto determine a cause of death because she wanted to collect the insurance money.\nThe investigators explained that the coroner’s office had been unable to determine\nthe cause of death, and that they needed to know what to look for as a possible\n\n                                          9\n\fpoison. As a ruse, they stressed that it would be very useful to know what the\npoison might have been.\n       On October 19, before 9:00 a.m., while driving, Sergeant Holmes received\na call on his cell phone from defendant’s cell phone. Defendant told him she had\njust received a telephone call. (Telephone records later showed that, in fact,\ndefendant had not received any incoming telephone call on her cell phone that\nmorning, before she called Sergeant Holmes.) Sergeant Holmes told her he would\ncall her back. He did so when he returned to his office so he could record the\nconversation. Defendant told him that shortly after 8:00 a.m. that morning, she\nhad received a telephone call while she was driving from a man who refused to\ngive his name. She said the “caller ID” was blocked. The man told her he had\ntalked with Holloway. Holloway had told him, “they can’t pin me.” The man also\nsaid, “Ask them about antifreeze.” Defendant did not know how the man had\ngotten her cell phone number.\n       This was the investigators’ first information that antifreeze might have been\ninvolved. After this conversation, Sergeant Holmes asked the coroner’s office to\ncheck for antifreeze as a possible poison.\n       Dan Anderson, a toxicologist with the Los Angeles County coroner’s\noffice, testified that the results of the initial tests on Frank’s body had been\nnegative except for the presence of Vicodin. That created a problem, because\nwhen checking for the presence of drugs, one must look for something specific.\nThere is no general toxicology test for everything. If a test for the most common\ndrugs is negative, trying to determine what might be present is like “looking for a\nneedle in a haystack.” For example, one must look specifically for ethylene\nglycol, the main chemical component of automotive antifreeze, in order to find it.\n       After defendant mentioned antifreeze to the investigators, specimens from\nFrank’s body were examined for ethylene glycol. All samples showed the\n\n                                           10\n\fpresence of a fatal amount of that chemical. Later testing also showed the\npresence of oleander.\n       Dr. Richard Clark, a toxicologist with the poison center at the University of\nCalifornia, San Diego, testified that ethylene glycol is poisonous but tends to taste\nsweet and can easily be mixed with Gatorade. Oleander, commonly found along\nSouthern California freeways, is also poisonous. It can be served as a tea and\nmixed with another liquid to disguise its bitter taste.\n       After examining documents in the case, Dr. Clark opined that Frank had\ndied of ethylene glycol poisoning. Specimens from his body contained five and\nsix times as much of the chemical as is needed to kill. Frank would have had to\nreceive the fatal dose within 24 hours before his death and “most likely” within six\nto seven hours. After reviewing records from Frank’s September 7 visit to the\nhospital, Dr. Clark opined that Frank could not have had in his system at that time\nthe ethylene glycol that his body later contained. Frank’s symptoms at that visit\nwere consistent with oleander poisoning. Dr. Clark testified it is “hard to say”\nwhat role the oleander played in Frank’s death, although it could have “played a\npart.” Frank must have last ingested oleander within 24 hours before his death.\n       Dr. Ogbonna Chinwah, who had performed the original inconclusive\nautopsy, testified that he later reexamined the body and found evidence of\nethylene glycol in the kidneys. In his opinion, Frank died of ethylene glycol and\noleander poisoning.\n       On December 12, Detective Steinwand told defendant that he was going to\nquestion Holloway about the case. He did in fact speak with Holloway, but only\nto obtain his cooperation and not as a suspect. He arranged for Holloway to\ntelephone defendant with the investigators surreptitiously listening. The next day,\nDecember 13, Holloway called her. Acting pursuant to instructions, Holloway\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\fasked her why she had told the “police that I poisoned Frank with antifreeze.”\nDefendant replied that he needed to talk with the investigators.\n         About one minute after this conversation ended, Sergeant Holmes received\na “911 page” (meaning important) from defendant. He called her back. She told\nhim she had just received a call from Holloway in which he said, “Well, they’ll\nnever be able to — to catch me anyway,” and “You better watch you [sic] back.”\nIn fact, Holloway had said nothing like that to her. Recordings of both December\n13 conversations were played to the jury.\n         In December, the investigators informed defendant of the results of the\nantifreeze testing. In various conversations, defendant asked the status of the\ninvestigation regarding Holloway. As a ruse, the investigators told her that one\nweakness in their case against Holloway was the lack of evidence that Holloway\nhad known in advance that Frank would be coming to Angel Gate Academy on\nSeptember 5. Poisoning requires advance planning, they explained, and Holloway\ncould defend against a poisoning charge by claiming he had not known Frank\nwould be there that day. They stressed that it was important for them to obtain\nevidence that Holloway had received information in advance that Frank would be\nthere.\n         On January 19, 2001, Sergeant Holmes told defendant that oleander had\nbeen found in Frank’s body, and that the cause of death and death certificate\nwould be ready in a few weeks. Defendant asked if they had yet received any\nevidence that Holloway had known in advance that Frank was coming to Angel\nGate Academy on September 5. He told her they had not. She told him that when\nshe worked “at admin,” she always received a fax saying who was coming.\n         On February 5, 2001, Sergeant Holmes received an anonymous fax\naddressed to him at the homicide bureau. It contained no cover sheet and\nindicated it had been sent from Staples Store No. 702. On the first page was\n\n                                          12\n\fwritten, “Urgent. Detective Holmes, I mailed this to you. Why is Chad still free?\nThought maybe you did not get it. Here it is again.” The name “Chad” obviously\nreferred to Holloway. The next two pages appeared to be a printed document\nconcerning a faculty orientation at Angel Gate Academy. On the second of these\npages was the handwritten name “F. Rodriguez.”\n       Later, Sergeant Holmes received in the mail at work an envelope containing\na copy of the same document he had received by fax on February 5, 2001, and a\nnote stating, “I found this in second platoon’s locker, in Sergeant Holloway’s\npapers. I figured this is how he knew Sergeant Rodriguez was coming to SLO\n[San Luis Obispo]. I hope this helps fry the bastard.”\n       On February 6, 2001, the investigators drove to Paso Robles, where\ndefendant had moved after Frank’s death, intending to arrest her. While driving,\nthey received a page from her. Sergeant Holmes called her back. He told her\nabout the fax he had received and said it was important for them to know who had\nsent it. She said she knew nothing about it. She also asked whether they were\ngoing to arrest Holloway. She added that she would like to be present when they\ndid, “to see the expression on his face.”\n       After defendant’s arrest, the investigators searched her Paso Robles home\npursuant to a search warrant. They found in her purse a piece of paper containing\nnumbers and computations, apparently calculations regarding how she would\nspend the insurance money plus accumulated interest that she expected to receive,\nand a napkin on which was written the sheriff’s fax number, the number to which\nthe anonymous fax received by Sergeant Holmes had been sent.\n       The purse also contained a fax confirmation sheet from Staples Store No.\n702 and the original of the fax Sergeant Holmes had received on February 5, 2001.\nOn this original copy, however, the handwritten name “F. Rodriguez” was in red.\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\fA forensic document examiner testified that this name was written in original red\nink and was not a copy from some other document.\n       The Los Angeles school administrator who coordinated the Angel Gate\nAcademy program testified that normally the school district would not provide the\nAcademy with the names of teachers who merely accompanied the students to San\nLuis Obispo and returned the same day. She said the printed document in the fax\nSergeant Holmes had received concerned a session that started on September 5. It\ncontained the names of the teachers who would stay there but not of those who\njust rode the bus. The printed document would not normally contain a handwritten\nname like the one on the fax.\n\n           5. Defendant’s Arrest and Later Events\n       Detective Steinwand and Sergeant Holmes arrested defendant for Frank’s\nmurder on February 7, 2001.\n       Evidence, including a tape-recorded telephone call that defendant made to\nGorham on March 27, 2001, showed that, while in jail awaiting trial, defendant\ntried to dissuade Gorham from testifying against her. In the recorded\nconversation, defendant told Gorham that, based on what Gorham had told the\ninvestigators, she could be considered an accomplice in the case. She suggested\nthat Gorham might be arrested if she did not change her story. Gorham responded\nthat if she changed her story, “isn’t that just gonna make it look worse?”\nDefendant said that people “retract it all the time.” She said Gorham could say she\nhad “found me with Conrad” (Gorham’s boyfriend). She added, “That would be\nenough for you to snap.” She also said that “this is getting bigger than anybody\ncan imagine, and it doesn’t need to be. Do you see what I’m saying?” She\nreiterated that Gorham “knew what I was doing, and you didn’t stop me.” When\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fGorham noted that she had not been arrested, defendant said, “They’re still\ninvestigating,” and “They’re still asking a lot of people questions.”\n       Other evidence showed that in May 2002, while still in jail awaiting trial,\ndefendant tried to solicit fellow inmate Gwendolyn Hall to arrange Gorham’s\nmurder when Hall was released from jail. Defendant first offered to pay $20,000\nfor Gorham’s murder then increased the offer to $30,000.\n\n           6. Defense Evidence\n       Defendant cross-examined prosecution witnesses and, through stipulation,\npresented evidence regarding telephone calls between defendant’s home and\nGorham’s home during the Labor Day weekend of 2000. The apparent purpose of\nthe stipulations was to impeach parts of Loran Moranes’s testimony.\n\n       B. Penalty Phase\n\n           1. Prosecution Evidence\n       The prosecution presented evidence that defendant murdered her infant\ndaughter in 1993 and additional evidence that she solicited Gorham’s murder.\n\n               a. Death of Defendant’s Daughter\n       On September 18, 1993, defendant’s 13-month-old daughter Alicia F.\n(Autumn’s younger sister) choked to death on a pacifier manufactured by the\nGerber Products Company (Gerber) in her crib in the family’s home in Lompoc.\nDefendant’s husband at the time, Thomas F. (Thomas), Alicia’s father, was on a\nbusiness trip, and defendant was the only adult in the house when Alicia died.\n       Santa Barbara County Firefighter David Mandeville was the first to respond\nto an emergency call at defendant’s home just before noon that day. When he\narrived, defendant was waiting for him outside. Mandeville found this unusual\nbecause normally regarding calls “where a child or infant is choking, the parents\nare with the child.” Alicia was in her crib not responding. He found a piece of\n\n\n                                         15\n\fplastic in the baby’s throat and, with an effort, was able to “pop it out.” The\nplastic was the rubber nipple part of a pacifier. Mandeville unsuccessfully applied\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation to try to revive the baby. He turned the baby over\nto paramedics as soon as they arrived.\n       Deputy Sheriff Ralph Ginter responded shortly after Mandeville. He found\nthe plastic backing of the pacifier in the crib and the rubber nipple on the floor.\nHe accompanied defendant to the hospital. After defendant was told that her baby\nhad died, she asked to obtain the pacifier backing, saying “that she wanted to keep\nit, that the manufacturer or company that she purchased it from is going to pay,\nand she didn’t want this to happen to another child.” Deputy Ginter wrote in his\nreport at the time that defendant was “adamant” about wanting to obtain the\npacifier backing. He released it to her at the hospital.\n       Dr. Wallace Carroll, the pathologist who presided over the autopsy,\ntestified that Alicia died of “asphyxiation due to airway obstruction,” that is, she\nchoked to death. Alicia had two teeth — the two lower front teeth.\n       Two months before the baby died, defendant had insured the baby’s life for\n$50,000, and named herself as the primary beneficiary. Defendant did not name\nThomas as a beneficiary and did not tell him about the policy until after the baby\nhad died. On October 22, 1993, the insurance company paid the $50,000, plus\ninterest.\n       Thomas testified that in late 1992 or early 1993, while vacationing in\nMichigan, he and defendant were eating in a restaurant with their daughters.\nAnother customer noticed the pacifier in Alicia’s mouth and “said that she wanted\nto let us know that she was pretty sure that that pacifier was part of a recall.” In\nfact, in March 1993, Gerber had voluntarily recalled the pacifier on which Alicia\nchoked based on five consumer reports that it had separated into three pieces.\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\f       Shortly after Alicia died, Thomas and defendant consulted a local attorney\nabout suing Gerber. Ultimately, they retained Attorney Barry Novak to represent\nthem. Novak filed a lawsuit on their behalf against Gerber for Alicia’s wrongful\ndeath due to the failure of the company’s pacifier. He obtained the actual pacifier,\nwhich was in two pieces. Novak sent both pieces to Dr. Wolfgang Knauss, a\nprofessor at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), for examination.\nDissatisfied with Dr. Knauss’s report, he next sent the pieces to Dr. Gary Hamed,\na professor at The University of Akron, for a second opinion. The defendant in\nthe lawsuit, Gerber, never learned of Dr. Knauss’s opinion.\n       In March 1996, after defendant and Thomas had divorced, Gerber settled\nthe lawsuit by paying $710,000. Defendant received 60 percent and Thomas 40\npercent of what remained after deducting Novak’s fee and expenses. Defendant\nreceived more than Thomas because she had been present at Alicia’s death and\nsuffered emotional trauma.\n       When Detective Steinwand searched defendant’s home after her arrest, he\nfound a copy of Dr. Knauss’s report containing the results of his examination of\nthe pacifier. As a result of this discovery, Detective Steinwand investigated\nfurther into the circumstances of Alicia’s death.\n       Dr. Knauss testified as an expert regarding the “failure and fracture of\npolymers, which includes rubbers.” In 1994, Barry Novak asked him to examine\nthe two pieces. He did so and prepared a report containing his findings and\nopinion. At trial, Dr. Knauss described the two pieces he examined. “A pacifier is\ntypically made up of what one . . . calls the shield, which is the hard part that stays\nin front of the mouth. Then something some people refer to as the baglet or the\nnipple, which is in the baby’s mouth, and the nipple is characteristically out of a\nnatural clear looking rubber, and in this case the nipple part had broken off away\nfrom the hard part, the shield, close to the shield.” Specifically, the separated\n\n                                          17\n\fnipple had “broken off or torn off” from part of the nipple that remained attached\nto the shield. The distance from the shield to the point of the rupture, where the\nseparated nipple had torn away, was short, approximately two or three millimeters.\n       In Dr. Knauss’s opinion, the fracture he observed between the two pieces\ncould not have been caused either by a baby chewing through the pacifier or a\nbaby’s repeated sucking action. He based this opinion on the nature and pattern of\nthe tear, the amount of force necessary to cause it, and the fact the tear was near\nthe shield rather than on some part of the nipple a baby would actually touch.\nBased on his visual and microscopic examination of the pacifier, he believed that\n“some external trauma or tool was responsible for failing this nipple.” One\npossibility was “something rolling over this, some external agent that caused large\nforce in that region, that would be responsible for this kind of complex fracture\npattern.” He said, “it might happen when a chair or some hard object rolls over\nthe pacifier like this. That might be the cause.” A tool such as pliers could also\nhave caused the tear.\n       Dr. Knauss was aware that Dr. Hamed believed the nipple might have had\nan initial cut that a baby’s normal use could have exacerbated, causing the\nrubber’s complete separation. Dr. Knauss believed this was not possible due to\nthe large amount of force that would have been needed to cause the separation. In\nhis opinion, “the ultimate failure as it now appears and documented in these\nphotographs is not consistent with that scenario.”\n       The prosecution presented portions of defendant’s deposition testimony in\nthe lawsuit against Gerber. She testified that she had checked the pacifier when\nshe first received it to “ma[k]e sure there’s no cracks or evidence of wearing.”\nAbout once a week she tested the pacifier’s bulb by pulling on it.\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\f                b. Solicitation of Murder While in Jail\n       The prosecution played for the jury tapes of jail conversations between\ninmate Gwendolyn Hall and defendant on May 10 and 11, 2002, that were\nrecorded with Hall’s cooperation, in which defendant solicited Gorham’s murder.\n       In the May 10 conversation, defendant told Hall “they could do it one of\ntwo ways. They could do it robbery gone bad, or they can make it look like a\nboyfriend gone mad.” Defendant gave Hall the address of and directions to\nGorham’s home in Paso Robles. When Hall asked how she would be paid,\ndefendant responded that “this is one thing I’m trying to figure out, the best way\nto, you know to transport or transfer it because I don’t want it to look . . . all of a\nsudden 25 grand is out my account.” She said she was considering “taking a trip\nto Vegas” because “that would easily show why I would pull out that much —\nkind of money.” Defendant added that the “house is so old that if it blew up, from\na gas leak or something, it wouldn’t surprise anybody.” She also said that “for\nsomebody to go in and shoot them in the head while they’re sleeping would not\nbe . . . surprising.” A pillow could be used to “muffle[] the sound.” She said there\nis an alley behind the house they could use to get away. Hall and defendant\nagreed that when the job was finished Hall should send defendant a “little girl\ncard” signed “happy birfday, love, Cuz.” (The misspelling was intentional so the\nmessage would be clear.)\n       In the May 11 conversation, defendant asked Hall whether “these guys”\nwould be “bright enough” to figure out how to make it look like a suicide. She\ndiscussed other ways to kill Gorham, such as “doing an overdose,” using cyanide,\nor making a gunshot “look self-inflicted.” She suggested that Hall drive because\n“they need a brain.” “They’re going to have to have somebody to tell them go do\nthis.” She added, “It’s your investment. Put it that way. It’s your decision.”\nThey again discussed how Hall would be paid. Defendant also suggested they go\n\n\n                                           19\n\fto Gorham’s house in the morning and watch her leave to “take her kids to\nschool.” “This way when she comes back you know she’s by herself.”\n       Los Angeles Sheriff’s Detective Patrick Valdez, who was assigned to\ninvestigate this matter, had heard from Hall that defendant might also be soliciting\nothers to kill Gorham. Anxious to prevent Gorham’s murder, he decided to try to\nconvince defendant that the murder had been accomplished. On May 21, 2002, he\ninstructed Hall to tell defendant that she had found someone to “act as a\nmiddleman between the hit man and Hall.” He gave Hall the fictitious name of\n“Antonio Davis” as the middleman with a fictitious address. That same day,\ndefendant released $60 from her jail account to “Antonio Davis.”\n       At Detective Valdez’s direction, Detective Steinwand and another officer\ndrove to Paso Robles where, with Gorham’s cooperation, they took photographs of\nher apparently dead body with a fake gunshot wound in the head and fake blood.\nDetective Valdez also arranged to have Detective Jose Mejia, posing as Antonio\nDavis, the fictitious middleman, speak with defendant at the jail on June 8, 2002.\nThe approximately half-hour interview was videotaped and played to the jury.\n       In the jail conversation, defendant and Detective Mejia (posing as Antonio\nDavis) sat divided by a plexiglass window and spoke through a telephone. In\naddition to speaking with one another, they communicated by writing notes and\ndisplaying them through the window, something jail inmates often did because\nthey knew their conversations might be monitored. Defendant wrote separate\nnotes on a single sheet of paper that she folded so that only one note at a time\ncould be read.\n       Detective Mejia showed defendant two photographs of Gorham’s\napparently dead body. He then held up a note saying, “How do you want to take\ncare of it? These guys are asking about the money.” Defendant wrote a note back\nsaying, “I thought Gwen [obviously Gwendolyn Hall] stopped it.” Then she\n\n                                         20\n\fdisplayed a second note saying, “My star witness.” Later she wrote, “Best friend\nof 6 years.” Verbally defendant stated, “This is what I told her.” She then\ndisplayed a note saying, “When out as soon as insurance in —About 45 days I\ngive to Gwen.” Later, she verbally stated, “I think that’s about as long as it takes,”\nand displayed another note saying, “It’s up to how long insurance takes.”\nDefendant displayed another note saying, “I thought she was joking,” then showed\nagain the note saying, “My star witness.”\n       After the conversation, defendant was searched, and the piece of paper on\nwhich she had written the notes was seized. An address book containing Antonio\nDavis’s fictitious address was also found in her possession.\n\n           2. Defense Evidence\n       Defendant presented evidence of two kinds: (1) evidence intended to cast\ndoubt on whether she had murdered her daughter and (2) evidence in mitigation.\n       Dr. Gary Hamed testified as an expert on “fracture adhesion of rubbery\nmaterials, particularly a natural rubber.” In 1995 or 1996, he tested the two pieces\nof the pacifier in the wrongful death case at Attorney Novak’s request. In his\nopinion, the rubber would not have failed as it did if it had not already been\n“degraded in some way.” He believed that three of the baby’s forces could have\ncombined to cause the pacifier to fail completely: sucking, a clamping and\npulling, and the work of the teeth. Dr. Hamed disagreed with Dr. Knauss’s\ncontrary opinion.\n       Autumn, defendant’s daughter, testified, “I would like it for you [the jury]\nnot to execute [her mother] and make it so I can see her.”\n       Anita Rivera, defendant’s mother, and Gigiana Colaiacovo, her older sister,\ntestified about defendant’s unhappy life and family background. Colaiacovo\ntestified that her grandfather had sexually molested her. When she refused his\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\flater advances, it appeared he molested defendant instead. Colaiacovo said, “My\nsister is a good person.” Both witnesses asked the jury to spare defendant’s life so\nthey could continue to have a relationship with her.\n       A defense investigator testified about the defense’s failed efforts to\ninterview and obtain the cooperation of defendant’s father in New York.\n       Dr. William Vicary, a psychiatrist, testified about defendant’s mental state.\nTo prepare his evaluation, he interviewed several people, including defendant’s\nmother, sister, and cousin, and defendant herself. Defendant described to him\nsexual abuse she had suffered from various people, including her grandfather.\nBased on these interviews, Dr. Vicary believed defendant was a victim of sexual\nabuse, and that this abuse had had a major negative impact on her. He also\ntestified that he had found defendant “to be the most emotional and the most\nanimated when she was talking about her children. She said in all her life, none of\nher relationships had ever worked, and that she had only two happy experiences,\nthe birth of her two little girls.” History that her relatives supplied indicated that\n“defendant was a very attentive, loving, supportive mother.” In Dr. Vicary’s\nopinion, defendant “would be a model prisoner who would get along with the\nguards and the other prisoners in the institution.”\n                                   II. DISCUSSION\n\n       A. Pretrial Issues\n       Defendant raises several issues regarding primarily pretrial events.3\n\n\n\n\n3      As will be seen, even though these are primarily pretrial issues, some of the\nevents petitioner cites occurred during and after trial. For convenience, we will\nconsider all of the related facts and arguments together.\n\n\n\n                                           22\n\f           1. Factual Background\n       Defendant was arrested on February 7, 2001. On February 27, 2001, the\ncourt appointed the public defender to represent her. On April 17, 2001, the\nsuperior court issued orders terminating defendant’s telephone privileges in jail\nand ordering the sheriff’s department to monitor her visits. The order was based\non a declaration by Detective Steinwand providing information about defendant’s\nattempts to dissuade Gorham from testifying, including her tape-recorded call to\nGorham on March 27, 2001. On April 24, 2001, the court ordered the sheriff to\nallow defendant’s attorney to have face-to-face interviews with her and to play\ntapes of recorded conversations and interviews regarding the case. On April 26,\n2001, the court also ordered the sheriff to provide to defendant “a set of thermal\nunderwear which is to cover her upper and lower body, in order to help prevent\nfurther coughing and colds.”\n       On September 26, 2001, defendant retained Attorney M.R. Ward to\nrepresent her in place of the public defender.\n       Later defendant moved to lift the telephone restrictions. On December 14,\n2001, the eventual trial judge, the Honorable William R. Pounders (who was to\npreside over all further proceedings in the case), conducted a hearing on the\nmotion. Defendant said she was “seeking replacement counsel” and needed\ntelephone access. The prosecutor stated that, due to defendant’s “misuse of the\nphones in the past, she has been placed in a part of the Twin Towers jail facility\nwhere she has no access to telephones.” Defense counsel requested an order\npermitting defendant limited telephone access to her lawyer. The parties discussed\nwhether the sheriff’s department had the resources to permit defendant to call her\nlawyer while ensuring that she would not be able to use the telephone to speak\nwith others. While recognizing the need to prevent defendant from continuing to\ndissuade witnesses, the court stated, “I think the first choice though is, as you\n\n\n                                          23\n\f[defense counsel] said, to try to reestablish communication between defendant and\ncounsel.”\n       Defendant personally reiterated that she needed telephone privileges to find\na new attorney. The court responded, “It isn’t necessary right now, but again if\nyou think I’m going to be stupid enough to reestablish your ability to call\nwitnesses and threaten them, I’m not going to do that . . . . You do now have\ncounsel that — of your choice, and there are ways to arrange to have counsel\nrepresent you.” Defendant also complained about where she was being housed in\nthe jail. The court responded, “I’m going to let your attorney work out that, if\nthat’s a problem. I’m not in a position to tell the sheriff how to run the jail . . . .\nI’m not going to jump in here and at your word decide that I’m going to change\nyour housing and give you free access to the telephone.” The prosecutor offered\nto check with the sheriff’s department to see if it could permit defendant telephone\naccess to her attorney while ensuring she could not speak with others.\n       The court said it believed defendant had the right to call her attorney but\n“under whatever conditions we need to assure that there’s no third party switch.”\nThe court left it to the parties to “work that out.” In the meantime, the court\nsigned an order allowing defense counsel “to have face to face interviews with\n[defendant] and to play on a tape recorder, tapes of recorded conversations and\ninterviews pertaining to” the case.\n       On January 3, 2002, defendant wrote a letter to the court stating that she\nhad “removed” Ward as her attorney and had not yet obtained a new attorney, and\nasking the court to grant her “temporary telephone access” so she could find\nanother lawyer. The court conducted a hearing on January 16, 2002. At the\nhearing, Attorney Ward stated his understanding that defendant “was considering\nto seek other counsel.” But he also advised her “that I consider it my obligation to\ncontinue working on the case until I’m relieved.” He said there were matters\n\n                                           24\n\fconcerning witnesses “that I would definitely keep working on until such time that\nI feel that I’m terminated on the case.” Defendant reiterated that she wanted to\nlook for a new attorney. The court expressed willingness to allow defendant to\nchange attorneys if she wished. But it was reluctant to lift the telephone\nrestrictions due to concerns she would use the telephone to dissuade witnesses. It\nnoted that she was already charged with using the telephone to attempt to dissuade\na witness.\n       A jail official stated at the hearing that it was not reasonably feasible to\npermit defendant to call a particular person while ensuring she did not call\nsomeone else. He said, “there’s no way for us to set it up where . . . she wouldn’t\nbe able to manipulate it and be able to call someone else or get on a three way\nconversation.” The court explored the possibility of alternate procedures to permit\ndefendant some telephone access. But ultimately, based on these representations,\nthe court denied defendant’s request to lift the telephone restrictions. The court\nobserved, “It really means that counsel has to visit his client much more frequently\nat the jail, which I know is a burden, but I also know the security problems.” The\ncourt also noted that Ward “must remain on the case until relieved by the court,\neven if your client says otherwise.” Attorney Ward agreed to continue to represent\ndefendant unless and until she obtained a new attorney.\n       At the end of the hearing, the court stated its intent to schedule another\nhearing for March 13, 2002, if defendant agreed to waive time in which to be tried.\nIt explained, “that gives you more time to make a decision about your attorney.”\nDefendant agreed to waive time. She expressed no objection to Ward’s continuing\nrepresentation under the circumstances. Additional hearings were held on March\n13, April 25, and June 17, 2002, during which Ward actively represented\ndefendant. The question of replacing Ward did not arise at these hearings.\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\f       On June 24, 2002 (i.e., 16 days after the videotaped meeting in jail between\ndefendant and Detective Mejia, posing as the fictitious middleman Antonio\nDavis), defendant sent to the court a long letter containing a wide range of\ncomplaints about her confinement.\n       On August 1, 2002, Attorney Ward moved to be relieved as attorney of\nrecord due to “defendant’s total lack of cooperation in the preparation for trial, and\nher totally uncalled-for misbehavior while in jail.” The court conducted a hearing\nthe same day.\n       The court explained to defendant that if it allowed a change of counsel, her\noptions would be to hire her own new attorney or, if she could not do that, it\nwould appoint an attorney to represent her. Defendant mentioned, and the court\nagreed, that a third alternative would be for her to represent herself. The court\nexplained to defendant the process involved in selecting qualified court-appointed\ncounsel. The parties also discussed possible difficulties in allowing defendant\naccess to a law library if she represented herself. The district attorney noted that\ndefendant had been “in administrative segregation initially because she telephoned\na witness and attempted to intimidate that witness and now the reason she’s there\nhas been reinforced by virtue of the fact that she solicited the murder of that same\nwitness.” The court stated its belief that defendant would have access to a law\nlibrary if she represented herself, but it noted other difficulties that would be\ninherent in defendant’s representing herself. It provided defendant with written\ninformation “that talks about the privileges that you do have representing yourself\nand the limitations on it.” The court continued the matter to let defendant consider\nher options. It ordered Ward to continue to represent her in the interim.\n       At the next hearing on August 13, 2002, defendant stated she wanted\nappointed counsel. Both the public defender and the alternative public defender\nannounced that conflicts prevented them from representing her. The court relieved\n\n                                          26\n\fWard as defendant’s attorney and said it would appoint an attorney who was\nqualified to try a death penalty case. After consulting with the assistant\nsupervising judge, it appointed to represent her the next attorney in line on the list\nof available attorneys. On August 16, 2002, the court noted that that attorney was\non vacation and instead appointed Michael Yamamoto to represent defendant.\n       On August 22, 2002, Attorney Yamamoto moved to withdraw as\ndefendant’s attorney, stating, “I am unable to establish an attorney-client\nrelationship with Ms. Rodriguez, based upon what communication has already\ntaken place.” He also stated, “Ms. Rodriguez has indicated that another panel\nattorney would be preferable to her and that this issue is with me, not appointed\ncounsel.” A hearing was held on August 28, 2002. The court stated to defendant\nthat “what I cannot let you do is continue to reject attorneys until you find one that\npleases you the most.” It noted that “you didn’t like the public defender that did\nyour prelim. You didn’t like your own attorney that you hired and now you’ve\ncreated the situation in which Mr. Yamamoto feels he cannot adequately represent\nyou.” It informed defendant that she could not continually change attorneys, and\nthat at some point she would “be stuck.” The court relieved Yamamoto as\nattorney of record and referred the matter to a bar panel to select a new attorney to\nrepresent defendant. David Houchin, defendant’s eventual attorney at trial, was\nappointed to represent her.\n       At a hearing on November 7, 2002, Houchin informed the court for the\nrecord that defendant had just given him a letter from her previous attorney, Ward,\npostmarked August 7, 2002, that, according to defendant, she had just received the\nday before. The letter was stamped that it had been opened in error on August 14,\n2002. Houchin described it as “a three-page single-spaced letter, which contains\nsome very interesting facts about this case. I know that we had problems down at\nTwin Towers [the jail facility where defendant was housed] with respect to people\n\n                                          27\n\fgetting information about this case or having information about this case, perhaps\nstatements made by my client. I just want to put that on the record that this thing\nhas been circulating.” On inquiry from the court, Houchin stated the letter “is a\ndiscussion from her prior counsel as to the case, as to how he anticipates that it\ncould or should proceed, and some steps that she should perhaps consider taking.”\nThe court asked whether Houchin wanted the letter made part of the record under\nseal. Houchin responded that he would “be the custodian of the document.”\n       The prosecutor assured the court and defense counsel that he had not seen\nthe letter. Houchin responded, “I think my concern is perhaps informants popping\nup.” The court noted, “There is nothing much we can do with it at this point.\nObviously, it stayed there far too long before it arrived with Ms. Rodriguez. Mr.\nWard was her retained counsel.” It instructed Houchin to “maintain the\nrecord . . . . If there is a problem, we’ll need to examine what’s in the record to\nsee if that could generate the problem that might come up.” The record contains\nno other reference to this letter.\n       In August 2003, about a month before trial began, Houchin moved the court\nto modify the order restricting defendant’s telephone privileges to permit her to\ncall him. A hearing was held on August 22, 2003. The district attorney expressed\nno objection to modifying defendant’s telephone restrictions as long as the order\npermitted defendant only to call Houchin and not anyone else. He believed it was\nnow possible for the jail to arrange this. The court agreed it was appropriate to\npermit defendant to speak with Houchin by telephone and not require him to visit\nher in jail every time he needed to speak with her. The court signed an order\npermitting defendant to telephone Houchin. It also issued an order directing the\nsheriff to permit defendant to meet face to face with Houchin and the defense\ninvestigator and that they “be provided the opportunity and facilities to play audio\nand video tapes” during the meetings.\n\n                                          28\n\f       The same day, the court signed an order directing the sheriff to conduct an\n“emotional state evaluation — medication status” on defendant. A fax sent to the\ncourt from Shirin Sharifa, Ph.D., on August 27, 2003, stated that defendant “had\nbeen receiving MHTX [apparently mental health treatment] from Twin Towers jail\nfor the past 2 yrs. She was last evaluated by this clinician on 8-27-03.”\n       A lengthy hearing concerning several matters was held on August 28, 2003.\nBased on conversations with jail personnel, the prosecutor expressed concern\nabout the court’s order permitting defendant to call her attorney from jail. He did\nnot want to state his concerns in open court “because if she doesn’t already know\nabout this, it would be telegraphing to her what is possible.” He stated that, based\non his conversations, “I believe [defendant] knows how to manipulate the . . .\nphone system to call someone other than Mr. Houchin.” Accordingly, the court\nheld an in camera hearing in the presence of the prosecutor and Houchin but not\ndefendant. The prosecutor explained his concern that defendant may have learned\nfrom other inmates how to use another inmate’s booking number to call someone\nother than Houchin. Believing that “it’s very important for a defendant, an inmate\nto be able to contact her attorney,” the court let stand the previous order permitting\ndefendant limited telephone access to her attorney subject to a jail deputy coming\nto court for further questioning.\n       Later during the August 28 hearing, in defendant’s presence, Houchin told\nthe court that defendant “said that she was told she’s seen by someone every three\nweeks, and that’s all they can do for her.” The court reviewed the response from\nDr. Sharifa dated the day before and expressed concern that it was inadequate.\nHouchin stated, “I have concerns after speaking with my client. I have seen\ncertainly a change in her demeanor, and an onset of that has been within the last\ntwo weeks. This is something certainly additional or different than what they\nbelieve they’ve been treating her for for the last two years.” Houchin asked to\n\n                                         29\n\fhave someone determine her emotional state, explaining, “I’m having a difficult\ntime even when I go down to see her to keep her focused on things. Her emotional\nstate is certainly not conducive to preparing for this trial.” The court agreed to\nissue an appropriate order that Houchin prepared. Houchin said he would prepare\nan order for the next day.\n       Another hearing was conducted on August 29, 2003. It began in\ndefendant’s absence, but in Houchin’s presence, as a continuation of the in camera\nhearing of the day before. The court spoke with a jail representative, then\ndefendant appeared for the rest of the hearing. After a further hearing in\ndefendant’s presence, the court ultimately ordered that she be permitted to contact\nHouchin by telephone on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays between 6:00 p.m.\nand 8:00 p.m. Houchin said, “That would be fine.” The court signed a written\norder to that effect. The court also confirmed with the jail representative that\ndefendant was entitled to face-to-face interviews in jail with Houchin and the\ninvestigator, with the ability to play tapes.\n       At defendant’s request, the court next conducted an in camera hearing, with\nthe prosecutor excluded, to address her medical concerns. Defendant complained\nthat the jail had placed her in “211 isolation, which is the discipline unit.” She\nbelieved there was no reason for her to be there. She expressed many complaints\nabout her confinement and said she was sick, often vomited, could not eat or sleep,\nand suffered from claustrophobia due to the fact her jail cell had no window. She\ncomplained that her doctor in jail could only see her every three weeks rather than\ngive her weekly therapy, which she believed she needed. The court noted that\n“there’s evidence that you’ve engaged in misconduct that’s been offered here, the\nevidence being that you’ve communicated with witnesses against you and you\nknew you shouldn’t and you tried to persuade them to change their testimony, and\nwith Ms. Hall that you tried to arrange to have the witnesses eliminated. So it’s\n\n                                           30\n\fnot as though you’re doing it, sitting there doing nothing. The discipline sounds\nlike it’s appropriate. The thing I want to find out too is about your medical\ncondition.”\n         After hearing further from defendant, the court asked what she thought was\nthe solution. Defendant said that she needed to be moved to another unit and, “in\norder to be able to help [her attorney] defend myself,” she needed more “mental\npsychiatric counseling.” The court said that “as far as discipline in the jail is\nconcerned, it does seem appropriate . . . given the evidence that I’ve seen here, that\nMs. Rodriguez not be treated as other inmates are, she’s not in the standard\npopulation.” It expressed concern that the cell had no window. But it said it could\nmake no ruling regarding her housing by hearing only one side of the story. It\nsaid, “the first step is for [defendant] to see the doctors and have a report to the\ncourt.” It again agreed to sign an order that Houchin prepared. Houchin said he\n“appreciate[d] the court’s help. I have noticed in the last several weeks’ time\nspent with my client is, she is tearful, emotional, and she can only discuss these\nissues that she brought up to the court here, and my time is not being used to its\nbest.”\n         After again listening to defendant’s concerns, the court said, “I won’t do\nanything based on only one side of the story.” It suggested a new hearing where\nboth sides could be represented. It told defendant, “Ultimately I can issue orders\nthat they have to follow based on your constitutional rights and the necessity to be\nable to prepare for this trial, but I . . . will not do anything just on hearing one side\nof the story. I’ve heard your side. If Mr. Houchin wants to pursue it and bring a\nhearing before the court, we’ll do that at whatever time is appropriate on\n[September 15 ] or otherwise.”\n         The same day, the court issued an order for a “psychiatric evaluation and\nreport back to the court, Dept. 101.” On September 3, 2003, defendant, through\n\n                                           31\n\fcounsel, filed a formal “motion for evidentiary hearing re: defendant’s\nconstitutional rights and appropriateness of present housing assignment.”\n       The court conducted the requested hearing on September 15, 2003, with\ncounty counsel representing the sheriff. The court stated that its “major concern is\nwith [defendant’s] ability to cooperate with counsel and prepare for trial. There\nare other concerns as well as to whether this is inappropriately restricting her at the\ncounty jail.” Psychologist Michael Maloney, the “program director for women’s\nmental health for L.A. County jails,” testified. He said that “defendant is seen by\nDr. Diana Delcarlo, who is a psychiatrist. She sees her every three weeks, talks to\nher and has prescribed Wellbutrin and buspirone, both mild antidepression, anti-\nanxiety drugs.” He said the number of visits defendant received was “more than a\ntypical inmate her capacity would receive.” She was not defined “as in need of\nmental health counseling.” The determination that an inmate needed mental health\ncounseling could be “made by any number of people,” but no one had done so\nregarding defendant.\n       Maloney said that Dr. Kevin Christy, a psychologist, had seen defendant in\nJuly. He “was of the mind that it would be good to talk to her once a week, and I\nsaid we don’t have the staff to do that.” Regarding whether Dr. Christy believed\ndefendant “should” be seen once a week, Maloney said, “The only word I’d\nquestion is ‘should.’ I mean it’s not like a psychological or psychiatric\nemergency. I mean he felt it would be helpful, nice for her to be able to talk to\nsomeone, and I would fully agree with that, but her condition doesn’t warrant it.”\nHe said that every inmate in her unit “would like to talk to somebody on a regular\nbasis. We get requests all the time.”\n       Deputy Nicholas Zabokrtsky testified that defendant was housed in module\n211, an “administration segregation” unit. The cells in that module had no\nwindows except on the door, and the door windows were generally closed due to a\n\n                                          32\n\fcourt order issued for security reasons. Module 231, another administrative\nsegregation unit, was less restrictive and had a window to the outside. At the time\nof the hearing, defendant received “day room privileges” for one hour a day,\nmeaning she could go to a room with a window onto the housing unit and shower\nand “just have time outside of her cell.”\n       After the hearing, the court declined to order defendant moved to module\n231, but it expressed concern about her being housed in a cell with no window.\nUltimately, after considerable further discussion among the parties and defendant\npersonally regarding defendant’s concerns and jail security considerations, the\ncourt ordered that the window on defendant’s jail cell be opened for two hours a\nday during her waking hours, that she receive increased clinician visits, and that\nshe be permitted to shower every other day.\n       On September 26, 2003, the court received from defendant a four-page\nhandwritten document labeled “special in parte motion for in camera hearing by\ndefendant.” Among other things, defendant said there was a “complete\nbreakdown of trust and conflicts of interest” with Houchin. After reviewing the\ndocument, the court treated it as a request for a “Marsden hearing” (People v.\nMarsden (1970) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176122\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176122/people-v-marsden/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">) and for a postponement of trial. It conducted the\nhearing the same day in the prosecutor’s absence.\n       Defendant spoke at length at the in camera hearing. Partly she reiterated\nsome of her previous complaints about her confinement. But she also complained\nabout her attorney, Houchin. She said, “I believe he’s a good attorney,” but she\nexpressed concerns about the investigation. Her main concern was about\npresenting a mental defense. She especially wanted someone to present a mental\ndefense regarding the solicitation charge. Specifically, she wanted the defense to\nuse an expert named Dr. Castellano rather than Dr. Vicary (the expert who\nultimately testified on her behalf at the penalty phase). She wanted various people\n\n                                            33\n\fwho worked in the jail, including doctors, and some inmates, to be contacted as\npossible witnesses regarding the solicitation charge. She also expressed concerns\nabout some of her jailers, including Deputy Rachel Jimenez, who was listed as a\npossible witness in the case.\n       After hearing from defendant, the court asked Houchin to respond. He\nnoted that “diminished capacity is no longer a defense.” He stated that “with\nregards to her mental state, I’ve had the opportunity to have and review for some\ntime and with others a report, a very lengthy report prepared by a panel\npsychologist Dr. Richard Romanoff.” The court noted, and Houchin agreed, that\nDr. Romanoff is “one of the best.” Houchin said that “because of discussions that\nI’ve had with my client with respect to Dr. Romanoff and with Dr. Romanoff\nhimself and also with other counsel that have preceded me on this case, without\ngetting into the specifics, that’s why I need to make a change in the mental health\nexpert insofar as the penalty phase, and that has been done.” He said he believed\nthe new defense expert, Dr. Vicary, was “very competent” and would be prepared\nfor what they might need at a penalty phase. He knew that defendant wanted to\nuse Dr. Castellano. But he explained that after Dr. Castellano had “had\ndiscussions with other attorneys,” she declined to be an expert on defendant’s\nbehalf. He said, “I’m sure [Dr. Castellano] would have been very qualified. I\nknow that Dr. Vicary is very well qualified.”\n       Houchin said, “With respect to . . . the defense that she wishes that there be\nmore investigation of the solicitation, there are only certain things that others can\ndo for us on that mental state. I’m sure that Dr. Vicary, and I’ve talked to him\nabout also addressing that issue, that was not an issue when the initial report was\nprepared by Dr. Romanoff. This occurred . . . after he did his workup. Certainly\nDr. Vicary will rely in part on the report and the work and the tests that Dr.\nRomanoff did, and I have asked him also if he could take a look at the issues that\n\n                                          34\n\fmy client wishes very much to discuss, what, if any effect her treatment by the\ndeputies in 211 had on her committing what’s been alleged as a solicitation of\nmurder.”\n       When the court asked him to comment on defendant’s desire to have other\nwitnesses regarding the solicitation count, Houchin replied, “These are people who\nmy understanding, talking with my client, also she has provided a list of these\npeople for the investigator that’s been appointed on this case, go also to the issue\nof things that may have been said by Jimenez to others there, things that Jimenez\nhas done not only to my client but to other people who are there, and pretty much\nthe way I understand it a character impeachment perhaps of Deputy Jimenez on\nthe issue of what may have led to my client doing what is alleged in the\nsolicitation for murder count.”\n       The court asked whether Houchin believed there was a problem “with\nhaving [Deputy Jimenez] as a potential witness and also being in whatever control\nthere is of Ms. Rodriguez.” Houchin responded that Deputy Jimenez did not have\nmuch personal contact with defendant. He added, “And to be honest about it,\njudge, when I have people that are in the position to come in in a guilt phase or\ncertainly a penalty phase with regards to my client’s activity, my concern was,\nshould my client be transferred someplace else, the potential was I could double\nup the number of deputies who would be coming in here with not so kind things to\nsay of my client. I was thinking more in terms of damage control, I’ll be very\nhonest with the court. With respect to where my client was, talking with her,\nkeeping her settled, being able to keep the potential evidence against us that may\ncome in in the penalty phase at a minimum.”4\n\n4      Deputy Jimenez had testified in a hearing held before this in camera\nhearing, but she did not testify at trial.\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\f       The court asked whether Houchin was ready to try the case. He responded\nthat he was. He explained that “my approach to this case and my theory of\nrepresenting my client has differed with her opinions and her wishes and her\ndesires, and these are just hard decisions that I have to make, and I am going to\nmake them.”\n       After hearing from both defendant and Houchin, the court denied\ndefendant’s request for a new attorney and a postponement of trial in a detailed\noral ruling.\n       The jury selection portion of trial began on September 29, 2003, and the\npresentation of evidence began on October 15, 2003. On October 23, 2003, the\ncourt issued a medical order to the sheriff stating, “Medications prescribed have\nnot been dispensed due to [defendant] being in court. Please dispense.” The next\nday, the court issued another medical order stating that “defendant is ill,” and\nordering treatment for “swollen throat, cough, and high fever.”\n       The jury returned its penalty verdict on November 12, 2003. On November\n14, 2003, the sheriff provided a written report to the court. The report stated, “In\nresponse to your court orders dated October 23rd and October 24, 2003, Inmate\nAngelina Rodriguez was examined and treated on November 12, 2003 at Twin\nTowers Correctional Facility, by Manuel Natividad, M.D.” Under “remarks,” the\nreport stated: (1) “Patient has a current diagnosis of Cold Symptoms (resolved)”;\n(2) “Patient’s medications are up-to-date”; (3) “Patient’s prognosis is good”; (4)\n“Patient’s care and treatment are continuing”; and (5) “Patient is fit to continue\ntrial proceedings.”\n       Defendant handwrote a long letter to the court dated December 3, 2003,\nexpressing various concerns about Houchin, mail delivery, and other matters, and\nmaking various requests, including immediate delivery of mail addressed to her,\nappointment of an appellate attorney, daily delivery to her of the Los Angeles\n\n                                         36\n\fTimes, and restoration of telephone privileges. The court conducted a hearing on\nDecember 12, 2003.\n         The court believed it was not appropriate to restrict defendant’s mail\ndelivery. Houchin said he was “unaware of any problems with the mail,” but\ndefendant said she had not seen any mail in over two months. The court agreed\nshe had a right to receive her mail. It directed the bailiff to look into the matter to\ndetermine whether it might have to issue an order. It also agreed that, “given the\nrestrictions,” defendant should receive the Los Angeles Times, and it so ordered.\nIt declined to restore defendant’s telephone privileges, noting that “based on the\nevidence that I heard during the trial, I’d be very concerned still for witnesses.” It\nbelieved “their lives are still at risk.” Regarding defendant’s request for an\nappellate attorney, the court noted that “we obviously will have time to work on\nthat.”\n         On an unrelated point, the prosecutor said that he wished to place certain\ninformation on the record at a later court date for appellate purposes. Specifically,\nhe wanted to present evidence that the investigators had arranged the tape-\nrecorded meeting between Deputy Mejia, posing as the fictitious middleman, and\ndefendant because of concerns that defendant might have been soliciting other\ninmates to murder Gorham. He wanted to show that the action was “not intended\nto create consciousness of guilt evidence, it was intended to make sure we did\neverything that we could to protect Ms. Gorham and guarantee that if there was\nanybody on the outside who intended to follow through on this request, we did our\nvery best to investigate this case and prevent it from happening.” The court gave\npermission for the prosecutor to present the evidence. The prosecutor did so at a\nlater date.\n         At the same hearing, defendant stated that she wanted to read a “long\nstatement” to the court. The court said, and she agreed, that it “would be\n\n                                           37\n\fappropriate” to read the statement when the court considered the automatic motion\nto modify the judgment. Defendant also said she was “in leg chains and the black\nbox,” and complained about extra security in the jail. She said, “I’m not a threat\nwhatsoever in jail.” The court stated that defendant should not be restrained in\ncourt because “I agree she’s not a physical threat at least in court.” It scheduled\nanother hearing to consider the necessity of restraints in jail.\n          The new hearing was held on December 18, 2003. The court stated that the\nrestraint it had seen in court seemed “excessive without some explanation.”\nAccordingly, two witnesses, Psychologist Kevin Christy, and Deputy Zabokrtsky,\ntestified about jail security concerns. Christy said that around the time of the\njury’s death verdict, he had been called to examine defendant at her request. She\nhad just returned from court and was upset about Deputies Jimenez and\nZabokrtsky. “She requested that they . . . not be around her because she didn’t\nknow how she would respond to them.” She said “she was afraid she might do\nsomething to them.” Because of this statement, he was concerned about their\nsafety.\n          Deputy Zabokrtsky testified that when an inmate receives a death verdict “it\nis common practice for us to increase our security level in our handling of that\ninmate based on at that point that individual no longer has anything to lose.”\nRegarding defendant specifically, he stated several security concerns, including\nthe death verdict, her solicitation of murder while in custody, and the concern Dr.\nChristy had expressed. All of these factors caused the jailers to increase her\nrestraints in jail. The court permitted defendant personally to argue that the\nadditional restraints were unwarranted. She reiterated, “I’m not a threat to\nanybody.”\n          The court found the additional restraints in jail justified “primarily because\nof the death verdict and because of the solicitation for murder previously.” It\n\n                                            38\n\fadded, “I do understand that blowing off steam on the day the death verdict is\nsomething that could have been very temporary and not well intended, but the\nother two reasons are very strong reasons for additional security.” It “agree[d] that\nphysically alone at least you [defendant] are not a threat in the courtroom.”\nAccordingly, it ordered defendant not be restrained at the next court appearance.\nThe court also reiterated that defendant was to receive a copy of the Los Angeles\nTimes in her cell (apparently she had not been receiving it) and all of her mail.\n       The next court appearance was held on January 12, 2004, at which the court\ndenied defendant’s automatic motion to modify the death verdict and imposed the\nsentence of death. Before ruling on the motion to modify the judgment, the court\npermitted defendant to make a long statement. Among many other things, she\nreiterated many of her previous complaints about her incarceration.\n\n           2. Asserted Unlawful and Inhumane Conditions of Confinement\n       Defendant contends she “was subjected to unlawful and inhumane\nconditions of confinement” in violation of various constitutional rights.\n       “Some courts have recognized, in the context of civil rights actions brought\nby pretrial detainees, that certain conditions of confinement may so impair the\ndefendant’s ability to communicate with counsel or otherwise participate in the\ndefense that a due process violation or an infringement of the right to effective\nassistance of counsel results. [Citations.] On the other hand, conditions of\nconfinement that have not actually affected the defendant adversely are not\ngrounds for reversal of a conviction . . . .” (People v. Jenkins (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1195356\"><a href=\"/opinion/1195356/people-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1002.) Here, nothing in the record suggests that improper conditions of\nconfinement affected defendant’s ability to communicate with counsel or\notherwise participate in the defense.\n\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\f       Defendant certainly complained a lot. But complaints alone do not\nestablish unconstitutional conditions. Contrary to her protestations at various\nhearings, defendant was an obvious and serious security risk. Evidence before the\ntrial court (and later presented at trial) showed that while in jail, she abused her\ntelephone privileges by attempting to dissuade a witness, a criminal offense.\n(§ 136.1, subd. (a)(2).) Defendant’s criminal behavior then escalated to soliciting\nthat same witness’s murder. Under the circumstances, jail personnel, and\nultimately the trial court, properly were concerned about the possibility of further\ncriminal behavior. The trial court listened to defendant’s many complaints, held\nhearings, and took appropriate remedial steps to ensure that she was able to defend\nherself. “The record in the present case does not indicate that the conditions of\ndefendant’s confinement so interfered with [her] ability to communicate with\ncounsel or assist in the defense as to constitute a violation of defendant’s rights to\ndue process or the effective assistance of counsel.” (People v. Jenkins, supra, 22\nCal.4th at pp. 1002-1003.) As in Jenkins, the trial “court was solicitous regarding\ndefendant’s complaints,” it held “hearings to attempt to resolve problems,” and it\nmade appropriate remedial orders. (Id. at p. 1003.)\n       We also “note that a trial court properly defers to a great extent to the\njudgment of jail authorities regarding the conditions of a pretrial detainee’s\nconfinement. [Citation.] The court generally defers to such authorities regarding\nrestraints on the defendant’s liberty if these constraints are reasonably related to a\nlegitimate government purpose — such as . . . to meet institutional security needs\nand the need for internal order and discipline [citation] — unless there is\nsubstantial evidence in the record to indicate that such conditions impose restraints\nthat are excessive relative to the legitimate governmental purpose. [Citation.] The\nrecord suggests strongly that the conditions imposed upon defendant related to\nlegitimate governmental purposes, and in any event [her] claim has little to do\n\n                                          40\n\fwith the validity of the judgment entered against [her] if [her] right to a fair trial\notherwise was observed.” (People v. Jenkins, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1006, fn. 22.)\nHere, the court did not always defer to jail authorities. It took active steps to\nprotect defendant’s ability to defend herself. We see no basis to reverse the\njudgment due to defendant’s conditions of confinement.\n\n           3. Asserted Limitations on and Interference with Defendant’s\n               Communications with Her Attorney\n       Defendant also contends “the trial court’s denial of telephone access and\nvisits from her defense counsel, and permitting jail interference with\ncorrespondence and legal materials deprived” her of various constitutional rights.\n       The court never denied defendant visits from her counsel. Indeed, it\nrepeatedly ordered jail authorities to permit her face-to-face visits with her\nattorney and, later, investigator, including the opportunity and facilities to play\naudio and videotapes. The court also never permitted jail interference with her\ncorrespondence and legal materials. Whenever defendant complained of such\nmatters, the court conducted hearings and took steps that, as far as the record\nshows, resolved any problems.\n       Jail authorities and the court did limit defendant’s telephone privileges, but\nproperly so given her criminal behavior in jail that abused those privileges. The\ncourt presided over several hearings held to determine how to give her as much\naccess to her attorney as possible consistent with institutional security needs.\nDuring some of the time before trial, her attorney had to visit her in jail rather than\nreceive telephone calls from her, which was no doubt inconvenient. Criminal\nbehavior often has inconvenient consequences. But the court was always\nsolicitous of defendant’s right to reasonable access to her attorney and took\nreasonable steps to ensure it. Indeed, a month before jury selection began, the\ncourt arranged a system whereby defendant could call her attorney three days a\n\n\n                                           41\n\fweek during certain hours. Defense counsel said that “would be fine.” This\nrecord presents no reason for this court to disagree with counsel’s assessment.\nDefendant received a full opportunity to defend herself.\n       Defendant also argues the trial court denied her “the right to consult with an\nappellate attorney,” when it declined to appoint an appellate attorney to represent\nher shortly after the penalty verdict. But the trial court had no obligation to\nappoint an appellate attorney to represent her, and certainly not before she was\neven sentenced. This court, not the trial court, appoints the appellate attorneys in\ncapital cases. (Cal. Supreme Ct., Internal Operating Practices & Proc., XV., A.,\n2.) We have done so in this case, and defendant is represented on appeal.\n\n           4. Asserted Failure to Discharge Defendant’s Retained Counsel\n       Defendant contends the “trial court committed reversible error when it\nfailed to discharge [her] retained attorney at her request.”\n       To summarize the relevant facts, in December 2001, defendant told the\ncourt she was “seeking replacement counsel.” She had not then obtained\nreplacement counsel and wanted to have her telephone restrictions lifted so she\ncould try to find a new attorney. After a hearing, the court refused to lift the\nrestrictions. In January 2002, defendant wrote a letter saying she had “removed”\nher retained counsel, Ward, as her attorney. But she had not yet obtained a new\nattorney. At a hearing on January 16, 2002, the court acknowledged that\ndefendant could change attorneys if she wished and discussed her options with\nher. But it also took steps to ensure that Ward would continue to represent her\nunless and until she obtained a new attorney. Defendant voiced no objection to\nWard’s continuing to represent her for the time being. In August 2002, Ward\nasked to be removed as defendant’s attorney, and defendant asked to receive a new\n\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\fcourt-appointed attorney. At that time, over a year before the trial began, the court\nappointed Houchin to represent her and removed Ward as her counsel of record.\n       In general, a criminal defendant has the right to discharge her retained\nattorney. (See People v. Ortiz (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2612448\"><a href=\"/opinion/2612448/people-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 983.) But we see no error in\nthese circumstances. The court did discharge Ward as defendant’s attorney and, at\nher request, appointed a new attorney to represent her. It did not do so in January\n2002, when defendant first said she had “removed” him. At that point, defendant\nhad not yet decided how to replace him. Discharging Ward then would have left\nher unrepresented. But she never indicated she wanted to be left unrepresented. A\ntrial court is not obligated to discharge retained counsel the instant a defendant\nstates the intent to remove that attorney and even before the defendant decides on\na replacement.\n       Defendant can also show no prejudice. More than a year before trial began,\nat defendant’s request, the court appointed Houchin to represent her. He\ncontinued to represent her from that point on until, during, and after trial. The\nfailure to discharge Ward in January 2002, rather than in August 2002, when\ndefendant decided she wanted appointed counsel, merely meant that she did not go\nunrepresented in the interim, which could not have prejudiced her.\n\n           5. Denial of Defendant’s Request for a New Appointed Attorney\n       Before trial, defendant asked the court for a new attorney, claiming\nHouchin was providing ineffective assistance. The court presided over a hearing\nin the prosecutor’s absence and then denied the request. Defendant contends the\ncourt erred.\n       When a defendant seeks to obtain a new court-appointed counsel on the\nbasis of inadequate representation, the court must permit her to explain the basis of\nher contention and to relate specific instances of inadequate performance. The\n\n\n\n                                         43\n\fcourt must appoint a new attorney if the record clearly shows the current attorney\nis not providing adequate representation or that defendant and counsel have such\nan irreconcilable conflict that ineffective representation is likely to result. (People\nv. Jackson (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2601957\"><a href=\"/opinion/2601957/people-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 682; see People v.

If the court holds an adequate hearing, its ruling is reviewed for abuse of\ndiscretion. (People v. Panah (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2509294\"><a href=\"/opinion/2509294/people-v-panah/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">395</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 431.)\n       Here, the court provided defendant a hearing and the full opportunity to\nexpress her concerns. It then heard from counsel, which was appropriate. (People\nv. Panah, supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 432.) Counsel responded point by point to\ndefendant’s concerns. He was aware, for example, that defendant had wanted Dr.\nCastellano to act as her mental health expert, but he explained that she had\ndeclined to do so.5 He assured the court he was prepared for trial. To the extent\nthere may have been some disagreements between Houchin and defendant\nregarding trial tactics, that disagreement did not compel a change of attorneys. “A\ndefendant does not have the right to present a defense of his own choosing, but\n\n5      Defendant argues that Houchin’s “decision to use Vicary was disastrous.\nVicary was ill prepared. He did not verify the information provided him almost\nentirely by [defendant] and was impeached on that very shortcoming. Having\nbeen provided by Houchin with a prior doctor’s report, Vicary offered some of the\nmost damaging testimony against [defendant] — that she intentionally enlisted the\nassistance of her 9 year old daughter to kill her husband. Vicary did not testify to\nany aspect of [defendant’s] mental state which might negate the specific intent\nelement of the crimes with which she was charged.” The record does not support\nthese assertions. Dr. Vicary seemed fully prepared. No reason appears to assume\nhe did anything but the best he could have done under the circumstances. For\nexample, in light of the extraordinarily calculated nature of defendant’s killing of\nher husband (on her third attempt, in order to collect on a life insurance policy),\nthe record presents no basis to assume Dr. Vicary could have provided any\ncredible testimony to negate the mental state necessary for first degree murder.\nAdditionally, presenting expert mental health testimony inherently risks inviting\ndamaging cross-examination.\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\fmerely the right to an adequate and competent defense. [Citation.] Tactical\ndisagreements between the defendant and his attorney do not by themselves\nconstitute an ‘irreconcilable conflict.’ ‘When a defendant chooses to be\nrepresented by professional counsel, that counsel is “captain of the ship” and can\nmake all but a few fundamental decisions for the defendant.’ ” (People v. Welch\n(1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1277687\"><a href=\"/opinion/1277687/people-v-welch/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 728-729.) We see no abuse of discretion in the court’s\ndenial of defendant’s motion for a new attorney.\n\n           6. Defendant’s Competence to Stand Trial\n       Defendant contends she was incompetent to stand trial, and that the trial\ncourt erroneously failed to conduct a meaningful hearing on her competence.\n       “Both the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution and state law require a trial judge to suspend proceedings and\nconduct a competency hearing whenever the court is presented with substantial\nevidence of incompetence, that is, evidence that raises a reasonable or bona fide\ndoubt concerning the defendant’s competence to stand trial.” (People v. Blair\n(2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2576153\"><a href=\"/opinion/2576153/people-v-blair/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 711.) “A defendant can create reasonable doubt through\nsubstantial evidence of mental incompetence, or the trial court can raise the issue\non its own.” (People v. Ary (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2628566\"><a href=\"/opinion/2628566/people-v-ary/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 517.) A defendant is\nincompetent to stand trial if she is unable to consult with her attorney with a\nreasonable degree of rational understanding or lacks a rational and factual\nunderstanding of the proceedings against her. (Ibid.; see § 1367, subd. (a).)\n“[A]bsent a showing of ‘incompetence’ that is ‘substantial’ as a matter of law, the\ntrial judge’s decision not to order a competency hearing is entitled to great\ndeference, because the trial court is in the best position to observe the defendant\nduring trial.” (People v. Mai (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1033.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         45\n\f       Here, not only did the court have the opportunity to observe defendant\nduring trial, it had the opportunity to observe her at many pretrial hearings at\nwhich she often spoke at great length. It did not err in failing to inquire into\ndefendant’s mental state more than it did. The record contains no substantial\nevidence that she was incompetent to stand trial, i.e., that she was unable to\nconsult with her attorney with a reasonable degree of understanding or lacked a\nrational and factual understanding of the proceedings. Defendant and, on one\noccasion, her attorney expressed concern that some of her conditions of\nconfinement were affecting her mental state and her ability to help prepare a\ndefense. She was receiving mental health treatment in jail, but she said she needed\nmore treatment. The court inquired into the medical concerns and ordered a\npsychiatric evaluation. It also ordered that defendant receive more frequent\nclinical visits. But the purpose of these orders was to determine whether\ndefendant’s concerns were valid and whether yet more mental health treatment\nwas necessary. No one suggested she was actually incompetent to stand trial.\n       Defendant’s many lengthy statements before the court, including during the\nMarsden hearing held a few days before trial, showed she was articulate,\nunderstood the charges against her, and was able to assist counsel. (See People v.\nLewis (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 525-526.) No reason appeared for the court to\nsuspend proceedings and conduct a competency hearing.\n\n           7. Defendant’s Absence from Proceedings\n       Defendant contends she was erroneously absent from court proceedings on\nthree occasions: (1) a portion of the hearing on August 28, 2003, regarding\ndefendant’s telephone restrictions; (2) the beginning of the hearing on August 29,\n2003, which was essentially a continuation of the in camera hearing on the\nprevious day; and (3) the beginning of the hearing on September 29, 2003, the first\n\n\n\n                                          46\n\fday of jury selection. Before defendant appeared on September 29, the court\nordered Gwendolyn Hall, who had been subpoenaed for that day, to appear at a\nlater date. Defendant was then brought into court and she was present thereafter.\nHer attorney was present on all three occasions.\n       “Broadly stated, a criminal defendant has a right to be personally present at\ncertain pretrial proceedings and at trial under various provisions of law . . . .”\n(People v. Cole (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2590164\"><a href=\"/opinion/2590164/people-v-cole/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1158</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1230.) However, “[a] defendant is not\nentitled to be personally present during proceedings that bear no reasonable,\nsubstantial relation to his opportunity to defend the charges against him, and the\nburden is on the defendant to demonstrate that his absence prejudiced his case or\ndenied him a fair and impartial trial.” (People v. Benavides (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2581604\"><a href=\"/opinion/2581604/people-v-benavides/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n89.)\n       The hearings held in defendant’s absence bore no substantial relation to her\nopportunity to defend against the charges. The portions of the hearings on August\n28 and 29, 2003, were conducted in defendant’s absence so the prosecutor could\nexplain to the court how inmates were able to use jail telephones to call someone\nthey were not supposed to call. The prosecutor and court were understandably\nreluctant to educate defendant on how she could manipulate the system, in case\nshe did not already know. In any event, defendant was represented by counsel at\nall times, and most of the hearings regarding restrictions on her telephone access\nwere conducted in her presence. She was present, for example, at the latter\nportion of the August 29, 2003, hearing when the court ordered that she be\npermitted to contact her attorney three days a week during specified hours. Her\nabsence during parts of those hearings did not affect her opportunity to defend\nagainst the charges. Her brief absence at the beginning of the September 29, 2002,\nhearing, when the court merely ordered a witness to appear at a later date,\n\n\n\n                                          47\n\fobviously also bore no relation to defendant’s opportunity to defend against the\ncharges.\n\n           8. Asserted Judicial Bias\n       Defendant contends Judge Pounders was biased against her. She never\nobjected on this basis, or moved to disqualify him for bias, at any time during the\nlengthy pretrial proceedings over which he presided or during or after trial.\nAccordingly, this claim is forfeited. Defendant may not go to trial before a judge\nand gamble on a favorable result, and then assert for the first time on appeal that\nthe judge was biased. (People v. Farley (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1053</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1110; People v.\nChatman (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 362-363; see People v.

Judge Pounders was very responsive\nto defendant’s legitimate concerns and needs. He always patiently permitted her\nto speak when she wished. He took active steps to ensure she had adequate access\nto her attorney and to protect her other rights. After trial, he went so far as to\norder the Los Angeles Times to be delivered to her cell. Contrary to defendant’s\nargument, the fact the judge permitted the prosecution to place certain information\non the record after the trial did not show bias. He permitted both sides to place\nmatters on the record. The record contains no hint of judicial bias.\n\n       B. Guilt Trial Issues\n\n           1. Excusal for Cause of Two Prospective Jurors\n       Defendant contends the court erred in excusing for cause two prospective\njurors. The court may excuse prospective jurors for cause if their views on the\ndeath penalty would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties\n\n\n                                          48\n\fas jurors. (People v. Duenas (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10.) The court may excuse\nprospective jurors for other reasons if their state of mind will prevent them from\nacting impartially and without prejudice to any party. (People v. Carasi (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2640086\"><a href=\"/opinion/2640086/people-v-carasi/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1290.) The standard of review in both situations is the same.\n“When the prospective juror’s answers on voir dire are conflicting or equivocal,\nthe trial court’s findings as to the prospective juror’s state of mind are binding on\nappellate courts if supported by substantial evidence.” (People v. Duenas, supra,\nat p. 10.)\n       The first of these prospective jurors stated on her questionnaire that her\ngeneral feelings about the death penalty were “for and against” and her\nphilosophical opinion was “neutral.” She believed life in prison without the\npossibility of parole was a worse punishment than death. She was an employee of\nthe Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office (the office prosecuting the\ncase), but she said she could vote not guilty. During questioning by the court\nregarding the death penalty, she said she could adjust her thinking regarding which\npunishment was worse and vote for life if appropriate. She also indicated that in\ndeath penalty prosecutions she had “come across in my dealings with the office,”\nonly once had she agreed with it. She told defense counsel her mind would be\nopen to either punishment, and that she believed the death penalty was not used\nenough.\n       When the prosecutor asked her whether she could personally vote for death,\nshe said, “I don’t know.” She reiterated that she had seen death penalty cases in\nher experience as an employee of the district attorney’s office, and only once had\nshe agreed with the decision to seek the death penalty — in a case in which the\n“defendant was very violent and he had committed several murders and he had\nfinally been caught.” When asked again whether she could personally vote for\ndeath, she responded, “I’m not sure.” She said that was the best answer she could\n\n                                          49\n\fgive. She added that she would be more comfortable not sitting on a death penalty\ncase, explaining, “You holding somebody’s life in your hands, and I mean people\ndo wrong, but I’m not really really really for the death penalty. I understand it and\nI think there are some circumstances it should be death, but I don’t know if I\npersonally could say, yeah, this person deserves to die.”\n       The court excused this prospective juror for cause. It noted that her\nanswers to its questions had made her appear acceptable, but it believed that “her\nstatement finally that she was not sure that she could impose the death sentence I\nthink does indicate that it is . . . not a realistic, practical possibility that she would\ndo that, particularly given the circumstances here. Perhaps on a defendant who\nhas killed 25 people she might be able to do that, so I will allow the challenge for\ncause” as to that juror.\n       The record supports the court’s excusal of this juror. She assured defense\ncounsel that she could vote for life in an appropriate case, but she could not give a\ncomparable assurance that she could vote for death in an appropriate case. In this\nsituation, we must defer to the trial court’s judgment regarding this prospective\njuror’s state of mind.\n       The second of these prospective jurors answered “yes” on the jury\nquestionnaire to the question whether he had any religious or moral feelings that\nwould make it difficult or impossible to sit in judgment of another person. He\nexplained, “Most engrained in my mind is the dictum: ‘Judgment is mine!’\nVengeance is as hazy as judgment to me.” He said law enforcement had once\nbeen “non-chalant” in responding to a crime involving a friend or relative. He\nalso noted an unpleasant experience he had had with a peace officer, although he\nalso said that a peace officer had been “very helpful and courteous.” He said he\nwas moderately in favor of the death penalty.\n\n\n\n                                            50\n\f       During voir dire, when asked whether his concern about law enforcement\nwould cause a testifying officer to “have to prove something extra to be believed\nby you,” he responded, “My feelings ambivalent, but I would take it one at a\ntime.” He said he would not “hold this against the officer testifying.” Later he\nsaid, “And I would be very very . . . questioning on the officer’s veracity . . . .”\nBut he added, “I don’t make a general statement.” He told defense counsel he\nwould not automatically disregard a law enforcement officer’s testimony. But\nwhen the prosecutor asked whether he would have more questions about a police\nofficer’s credibility than other witnesses, he responded, “I think I would have,\nyeah.” Specifically, he would treat a deputy sheriff who testified “differently in\nterms of evaluating the credibility than [he] would a regular witness who wasn’t a\nlaw enforcement officer.”\n       When asked about the death penalty he said, “My attitude towards capital\npunishment is, if it is . . . a punishment, it is my feeling doesn’t seem to be a\ndeterrent to — it doesn’t seem to achieve the purpose really. My feelings as far as\nit’s — it’s still a tooth for a tooth kind of thing rather than to punish the accused.\nAnd I tend more to not favor capital punishment.” Later he said he was\n“moderately” in favor of the death penalty. He added that he could impose the\ndeath penalty. When asked about his “vengeance is mine” response on the\nquestionnaire, he said, “It’s more on the penalty portion of it, on the . . . capital\npunishment.” He said he could be fair to the prosecutor’s side, but he also said\nthat, although he could “be in judgment” regarding guilt, “the capital punishment\nis one that makes me uncomfortable.” When asked whether the lack of comfort\nwould affect his ability to be fair to the prosecutor, he responded, “I don’t think so\nbecause . . . mine is emotional side. If I divorce my emotions from or my . . . kind\nof belief that capital punishment is not a deterrent, if it is only on that phase, it’s\nnot — I . . . would not be affected by your . . . side. I would still be . . . fair to\n\n                                            51\n\fyour arguments.” He would “definitely make sure that my emotion will not enter\ninto it.”\n        The prosecutor challenged this juror for cause both because he would not\njudge police officers by the same standards as other witnesses and because of\nconcerns about his ability to decide penalty. He explained, “I believe that\nnotwithstanding his final answer, he’s given other answers which indicate that he’s\nincapable, I think, of deciding penalty fairly.” Defense counsel objected, arguing\nthe juror could be fair.\n        The court granted the challenge. It was concerned about the juror’s\nexplanation that the “vengeance is mine” answer on the questionnaire “didn’t\napply to the guilt phase, it applied to the penalty phase.” It noted that the answer\noccurred early in the questionnaire, long before there was any mention of the death\npenalty. “So when he answered, he did not know that the penalty was a possibility\nof death, so I don’t accept his answer as being that’s what he’s saying, that it deals\nonly with the penalty. He’s basically saying that’s going to affect — the charges\nhere are going to affect him, even deciding the guilt phase of the case. Anyway,\non both issues, I will accept the challenge for cause.”\n        The record supports the court’s determination that this juror’s state of mind\nwould prevent him from being entirely impartial. The juror’s explanation\nregarding his “vengeance is mine” answer was quite confused, and he essentially\nadmitted he would judge law enforcement witnesses by a different standard than\nother witnesses. Accordingly, as we must, we defer to the court’s ruling as to this\nprospective juror. We see no error.\n\n\n\n\n                                          52\n\f           2. Evidentiary Rulings\n\n                a. Admission of Demeanor Evidence\n       Defendant contends the court erred on several occasions in permitting\nwitnesses to testify regarding her demeanor. The court generally overruled her\nobjections that the testimony was speculative.\n       Officer Sharpe, who first responded to the call at defendant’s home the\nmorning Frank died, testified about her demeanor and contrasted it with the\ndemeanor of others who had lost a loved one that he had had contact with in the\npast. Frank’s sister, Rebecca Perkins, testified about defendant’s lack of emotion\nwhen she spoke with defendant the day Frank died. When Perkins later said that\ndefendant “wasn’t upset for losing a husband,” the court sustained defendant’s\nobjection on the ground it was speculative. Defendant’s other sister, Shirley\nCoers, testified that when she spoke with defendant shortly after Frank’s death,\n“she always seemed very calm”; she seemed “not upset, not crying, not sad.”\nMickey Marracino, the life insurance agent whom defendant contacted shortly\nafter Frank’s death, testified about her lack of emotion and said, “she didn’t stop to\ncompose herself the way other people have done when I’ve talked to them when\nthey’ve lost a loved one.” Detective Wilsey, the original investigator into this\ncase, testified about defendant’s lack of emotion. He explained, “Her first\nquestions were relating to the coroner’s department, the disposition of the body.\nShe had mentioned that she wanted to have the body cremated, and the questions\nwere centered around that, not . . . cause of death, which is normally what we hear\nor . . . what’s happening with the case, that kind of a thing.”\n\n\n\n\n                                          53\n\f       Defendant contends this demeanor testimony was “irrelevant, without\nfoundation, and based on speculation.” 6 However, she objected at trial only on\ngrounds that the testimony was speculative. Accordingly, only that objection is\ncognizable on appeal. (People v. Partida (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2576438\"><a href=\"/opinion/2576438/people-v-partida/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 433-434.) An\nobjection was particularly necessary regarding defendant’s lack-of-foundation\nclaim. An objection on that basis would have allowed the party offering the\nevidence to lay additional foundation as needed. (People v. Partida, supra, at p.\n434.) In any event, defendant does not explain what foundation was lacking and\nwe perceive no missing foundation. The witnesses spoke from personal\nknowledge.\n       To the extent, if any, that defendant’s relevance contention differs from the\ncontention that the testimony was speculative, that contention is not cognizable.\nMoreover, the testimony was relevant. It had a “tendency in reason to prove or\ndisprove any disputed fact that is of consequence to the determination of the\naction.” (Evid. Code, § 210.) It was relevant on the question of whether\ndefendant was a grieving widow or had just killed her husband to collect life\ninsurance proceeds, a question obviously of consequence in deciding whether\ndefendant was guilty of her husband’s murder.\n       Defendant’s argument that the testimony was speculative is cognizable. To\nsome extent that objection is inherently based on relevance. “[T]he prohibition\nagainst an examiner’s question that calls for an answer based on speculation and\n\n6      Defendant also contends the court erred in permitting Sergeant Holmes to\nprovide demeanor testimony at a pretrial hearing. This testimony was not\npresented at trial. Defendant asserts, without elaboration, that some of the\n“demeanor testimony contributed to erroneous pretrial rulings.” But defendant\ndoes not identify those pretrial rulings or explain how they were erroneous, how\nthe demeanor testimony contributed to the asserted error, or how the rulings\naffected the trial. Accordingly, we do not consider this point.\n\n\n\n                                         54\n\fconjecture is also founded on the concept of relevancy. Such testimony is\nirrelevant, because it does not have a tendency in reason to prove or disprove the\ndisputed issue on which the testimony is proffered.” (1 Jefferson’s Cal. Evidence\nBenchbook (Cont. Ed. Bar 4th ed. 2013) Competency, Examination, and\nCredibility of Witnesses, § 28.56, p. 534.) Accordingly, to the extent defendant’s\nrelevancy argument is included in her argument concerning speculation, that\nargument is cognizable. But we see no error. No blanket rule prohibiting\ndemeanor testimony exists, and the trial court here reasonably found the actual\ntestimony not speculative.\n       “[A]n examiner’s question asking a lay witness to testify to facts that the\nwitness has not personally observed, or to state an opinion not based on his or her\nown observations, calls for speculation and conjecture by the witness and is\nprohibited by” Evidence Code sections 702 and 800. (1 Jefferson’s Cal. Evidence\nBenchbook, supra, § 28.56, p. 534.) Here, the testimony the court permitted was\nbased on facts the witnesses had personally observed. The court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in finding the testimony not speculative. (People v. Taylor (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 739.)\n       Defendant cites People v. Sergill (1982) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2120546\"><a href=\"/opinion/2120546/people-v-sergill/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, where the\nappellate court found the trial court had erred in permitting police officers to\ntestify that, in their opinion, a certain witness was credible. The demeanor\ntestimony of this case, based on the witnesses’ own perceptions, bears no\nresemblance to the testimony found inadmissible in Sergill.\n       The parties debate at length whether the testimony was admissible as either\nlay or expert opinion. However, defendant did not object that the testimony was\nimpermissible opinion, so any argument in this regard is not cognizable.\nMoreover, it does not appear the court admitted the evidence as opinion testimony.\nThe testimony was based on the witnesses’ own perceptions. Indeed, the court\n\n                                          55\n\fsustained defendant’s objection to Perkins’s statement that defendant “wasn’t\nupset for losing a husband,” which does appear to have been an opinion. Contrary\nto defendant’s assertion that the court’s rulings were inconsistent, the court\nconsistently permitted the witnesses to testify about what they had observed, but\nnot to express an opinion as to the meaning of those observations. Doing so came\nwithin its discretion.\n       Defendant also challenges the admissibility of Sergeant Holmes’s\ntestimony that “I knew that she was calling every day and every single\nconversation was regarding financial, getting money to make it, and she wanted\nthe coroner’s office to come back as soon as possible with a cause of death so that\nshe could be financially better off.” Defendant did not object to this testimony, so\nthe contention is not cognizable. Moreover, this was not demeanor testimony at\nall but was merely Sergeant Holmes’s summary of his many telephone\nconversations with defendant during the investigation. No basis appears for\ndefendant to have objected to this testimony.\n\n                b. Asserted Violation of Confrontation Rights\n       Defendant contends the court violated her right to confront witnesses under\nthe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n       Defendant first challenges the admission of statements Gwendolyn Hall\nmade to law enforcement agents regarding defendant’s efforts to solicit Gorham’s\nmurder. The prosecution called Hall as a witness, and she testified in front of the\njury. Although she provided some testimony, she also claimed not to have any\nmemory regarding the events she had told law enforcement agents about.\nDefendant then cross-examined her. The trial court found Hall’s “statements that\nshe does not recall are not truthful” and, over defendant’s objection, admitted\nevidence of her prior statements.\n\n\n\n                                         56\n\f       Admitting the prior statements did not violate defendant’s right to confront\nHall. Hall testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination. The United\nStates Supreme Court has made clear that admitting prior statements of a witness\nwho testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination does not violate a\ndefendant’s confrontation rights. (California v. Green (1970) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; see\nPeople v.

Washington (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Crawford). Those\ncases changed constitutional confrontation law in a significant respect. Crawford\nheld that the prosecution may not rely on “testimonial” out-of-court statements\nunless the witness testifies at trial or is unavailable to testify and the defendant had\na prior opportunity for cross-examination. (See, e.g., People v. Lopez (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 576-580.) But those cases made no change regarding use of prior\nstatements of a witness who actually testifies. Crawford itself “reiterate[d] that,\nwhen the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation\nClause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements.”\n(Crawford, supra, at pp. 59-60, fn. 9 [citing California v. Green, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">149</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> ]; see People v. Cowan (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1801948\"><a href=\"/opinion/1801948/people-v-cowan/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 463 [“The Sixth Amendment’s\nconfrontation clause does not prohibit admitting into evidence ‘testimonial’\nhearsay statements against a defendant if the declarant appears for cross-\nexamination at trial.”].)\n       As a practical matter, Hall’s claim of total lack of recall limited defendant’s\nability to cross-examine her about her prior statements. But this circumstance\ndoes not implicate the confrontation clause. (United States v. Owens (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 555-560; People v. Dement (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844239\"><a href=\"/opinion/844239/people-v-dement/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23-24.) “The\nwitness . . . was not absent from the trial. She testified at length at trial and was\nsubjected to lengthy cross-examination. The jury had the opportunity to observe\n\n                                          57\n\fher demeanor, and the defense cross-examined her about bias. Even though she\nprofessed total inability to recall the crime or her statements to police, and this\nnarrowed the practical scope of cross-examination, her presence at trial as a\ntestifying witness gave the jury the opportunity to assess her demeanor and\nwhether any credibility should be given to her testimony or her prior statements.\nThis was all the constitutional right to confrontation required.” (People v. Perez\n(2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2268026\"><a href=\"/opinion/2268026/people-v-perez/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">760</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 766.) The same is true here.\n       It is not clear whether defendant also contends that admitting Hall’s prior\nstatements violated state law. But doing so did not violate state law. “A witness’s\nprior statement that is inconsistent with his or her testimony is admissible so long\nas the witness is given the opportunity to explain or deny the statement. (Evid.\nCode, §§ 770, 1235.)” (People v. Ledesma (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599941\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599941/people-v-ledesma/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 710.)\nOrdinarily, a witness’s inability to remember an event is not inconsistent with that\nwitness’s prior statement describing the event. (Id. at p. 711.) When, however, “a\nwitness’s claim of lack of memory amounts to deliberate evasion, inconsistency is\nimplied. [Citation.] As long as there is a reasonable basis in the record for\nconcluding that the witness’s ‘I don’t remember’ statements are evasive and\nuntruthful, admission of his or her prior statements is proper.” (People v. Johnson\n(1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1205096\"><a href=\"/opinion/1205096/people-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1183</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1219-1220; see People v. Ledesma, supra, at pp. 711-712.)\nHere, the trial court expressly found Hall’s repeated “I don’t recall” claims to be\nuntruthful. The record provides a reasonable basis for that conclusion.\nAccordingly, admitting Hall’s prior statements did not violate state law.\n       In any event, the jury did not reach a verdict on the charge of soliciting\nmurder, the only charge to which Hall’s prior statements related. Accordingly,\nadmitting those statements did not prejudice defendant at the guilt phase.\n       Next, defendant contends the presentation of the technical evidence\nviolated her confrontation rights. Specifically, she challenges the testimony that\n\n                                          58\n\fthe victim’s body contained oleander and ethylene glycol, and Dr. Clark’s opinion\ntestimony. She did not object at trial. But to the extent defendant contends there\nwas a confrontation clause violation under Crawford, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and its\nprogeny, we have excused the failure to object in trials that, like this one, predated\nCrawford. (People v. Pearson (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 461-462.) Accordingly, we\nwill consider defendant’s contention on the merits.\n       The contention lacks merit. Indeed, it is not clear exactly what\nconfrontation defendant claims she was denied. Dr. Birgit Puschner, a\ntoxicologist, performed the tests that showed the victim’s body contained\noleander; she testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination. (Defendant\ndid not actually cross-examine her, but that does not matter. She had the\nopportunity to cross-examine her. (Crawford, supra, 541 U.S. at p. 59.)) Dan\nAnderson, also a toxicologist, and Dr. Chinwah, the pathologist who performed\nthe autopsy, both independently tested and determined that the victim’s body\ncontained ethylene glycol; both testified at trial and were subject to cross-\nexamination. And Dr. William Chao, the emergency room doctor who treated the\nvictim on September 7, 2000, testified and was subject to cross-examination.\nDefendant thus received full confrontation rights as to these witnesses. Dr. Clark,\nwho testified and was subject to cross-examination, based his opinions on the\nreports of those experts, but, because those experts also testified and were subject\nto cross-examination, defendant was able to confront all of the experts. A\ntestifying expert may base his or her opinion on hearsay statements, even if\ntestimonial, at least when those who made the hearsay statements also testify and\nare subject to cross-examination. Defendant received full confrontation rights as\nto those portions of the reports, if any, that are testimonial under Crawford, supra,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and its progeny.\n\n\n\n                                          59\n\f       One or possibly two exceptions exist. First, Anderson testified that blood\nsamples from the victim’s body had been sent to an independent laboratory, and\nthe laboratory returned a report stating that the samples contained ethylene glycol.\nWe need not determine whether this report was testimonial (see, e.g., People v.\nLopez, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">), because any error in permitting this testimony was\nharmless. Anderson also testified that after he received the report, he conducted\nhis own testing and determined himself that the victim’s body contained ethylene\nglycol. Moreover, Dr. Chinwah testified that he reexamined the body and also\ndetermined that the kidneys contained ethylene glycol. Because of these\nindependent opinions by testifying witnesses on a point defendant did not dispute,\nAnderson’s mention of the original report was harmless beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. (People v. Lopez, supra, at p. 585.)\n       Second, although it is difficult to discern on this record because of the\nabsence of an objection, it is possible that portions of the medical records from the\nvictim’s visit to the emergency room about which Dr. Chao (and possibly Dr.\nClark) testified were generated by someone other than Dr. Chao, such as nurses.\nBut one of Crawford’s progeny makes clear that “medical records created for\ntreatment purposes . . . would not be testimonial under our decision today.”\n(Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145853\"><a href=\"/opinion/145853/melendez-diaz-v-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 312, fn. 2.) The medical\nrecords from the victim’s emergency room visit were created for treatment\npurposes, not for some other purpose such as law enforcement. Defendant was not\nyet a suspect in a murder that had not yet occurred. Accordingly, the medical\nrecords were not testimonial.\n\n\n\n\n                                         60\n\f       C. Penalty Issues\n\n           1. Effect of Asserted Guilt Phase Errors on Penalty Determination\n       Defendant contends that the asserted guilt phase errors were prejudicial at\nthe penalty phase. However, the only possible guilt phase error that we have\nidentified is the presumed error in permitting the toxicologist, Anderson, to\nmention the results of the independent laboratory’s report finding ethylene glycol\nin the victim’s blood, and that was harmless because Anderson and Dr. Chinwah\nboth independently determined that the victim’s body contained ethylene glycol.\nThe presumed error was equally harmless to the penalty determination.\n\n           2. Issues Concerning the Evidence of Defendant’s Prior Murder\n       Defendant raises several issues concerning the evidence that she murdered\nher infant daughter.\n\n               a. Adequacy of the Hearing Regarding the Admissibility of the\n                   Evidence\n       Section 190.3 requires the prosecution to provide the defendant with notice\nof aggravating evidence it intends to introduce at the penalty phase. The\nprosecutor’s notice of aggravating evidence filed to comply with this section\nstated the intent to present evidence of, among other matters, defendant’s murder\nof her daughter, Alicia F. In response, defendant moved the court to conduct a\n“preliminary examination” regarding the admissibility of that evidence. The\nprosecutor filed an opposition that stated in detail the evidence that defendant\nmurdered her daughter and attached a copy of Dr. Knauss’s report.\n       The court held a hearing before trial. It stated it had read defendant’s\nmotion and the prosecutor’s response. Defense counsel asked the court to preside\nover a hearing at which Dr. Knauss testified. The court agreed to do so.\nAccordingly, Dr. Knauss testified outside the jury’s presence, giving testimony\nconsistent with his later testimony before the jury. After hearing Dr. Knauss’s\n\n\n                                         61\n\ftestimony and considering arguments from counsel, the court found the evidence\nthat defendant murdered her daughter was sufficient to go to the jury.\n       Defendant contends the hearing was inadequate. A trial court may\n“conduct a preliminary inquiry before the penalty phase to determine whether\nthere is substantial evidence to prove each element of the other criminal activity.”\n(People v. Phillips (1985) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1354747\"><a href=\"/opinion/1354747/people-v-phillips/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 72, fn. 25) “[T]his preliminary inquiry is\ndiscretionary and, if held, need not be an evidentiary hearing. If the court does\nelect, in its discretion, to conduct such an inquiry it may be based on an offer of\nproof.” (People v. Jones (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 380.) Here, the trial court did\nconduct a preliminary inquiry. It read the moving papers and the prosecutor’s\nsummary of the evidence, which was in effect an offer of proof, and heard\narguments from both sides regarding the strength of the evidence. Additionally,\nalthough it did not have to do so (see People v. Hart (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1277356\"><a href=\"/opinion/1277356/people-v-hart/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 649),\nit required Dr. Knauss to testify both at the preliminary inquiry and again at the\npenalty phase. This inquiry came well within its discretion.\n       Defendant contends the court applied the wrong legal standard in finding\nthe evidence sufficient. The record does not support the contention. “Contrary to\ndefendant’s urging, the prosecution did not bear the burden at the preliminary\ninquiry to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed a violent\ncrime. The court could accept ‘evidence that would allow a rational trier of fact to\nmake a determination beyond a reasonable doubt as to [such] criminal activity.’ ”\n(People v. Ochoa (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 449, quoting People v. Clair (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1171441\"><a href=\"/opinion/1171441/people-v-clair/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 676.) The prosecutor cited Ochoa, both in its written opposition and\nat the hearing. Nothing in the record suggests the court applied some different,\nlower standard.\n       Moreover, no abuse of discretion in admitting evidence of other crimes will\nbe found if, in fact, the evidence was legally sufficient. (People v. Whisenhunt\n\n                                         62\n\f(2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2600609\"><a href=\"/opinion/2600609/people-v-whisenhunt/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 225.) As we next conclude, the evidence was sufficient to\nsubmit the matter to the jury.\n\n               b. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n       Defendant contends the evidence was insufficient for the jury to find\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that she murdered her daughter. Because the question\nconcerns the admissibility of evidence, it also comes within the trial court’s\ndiscretion. (People v. Jones, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 380; People v. Clair, supra, 2\nCal.4th at p. 676.) We see no abuse of discretion.\n       There was ample evidence that defendant murdered her daughter. About\ntwo months before Alicia died, defendant took out life insurance on the baby\nwithout telling her then husband, the baby’s father, and named only herself the\nprimary beneficiary. This circumstance alone strongly suggests she murdered her\ndaughter to collect the life insurance proceeds, just as she later murdered her\nhusband to collect on a life insurance policy that she insisted he take out. She was\nthe lone adult in the house when the baby choked to death and, rather than remain\nwith the baby until emergency help arrived, as the jury could reasonably find a\nmother would normally do, she left the baby inside and met the police outside her\nhouse. After her daughter died, she seemed more concerned about collecting the\npacifier parts and suing Gerber than about losing her baby. Thomas testified that\ndefendant had previously heard about Gerber’s recall of the pacifier on which the\nbaby later choked. Additionally, Dr. Knauss’s testimony strongly supported a\nfinding that the baby’s death could not have been an accident, especially when\ncombined with defendant’s deposition testimony that she continually checked the\npacifier by pulling on it. His opinion was especially credible given that defendant\nherself had retained him to provide an opinion. “The foregoing evidence was\nsufficient to allow a rational trier of fact to determine beyond a reasonable doubt\n\n\n\n                                         63\n\fthat defendant murdered” her daughter. (People v. Hart, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p.\n650.)\n\n                c. Evidentiary Claims\n        Defendant contends the court committed several evidentiary errors\nregarding the evidence that she murdered her daughter.\n        First, she contends the court erred in admitting evidence of her deposition\ntestimony, apparently on the ground that it was inadmissible hearsay. (See pt. I.\nB. 1. a., post.) However, defendant did not object on this ground so the contention\nis not cognizable on appeal. (People v. Partida, supra, 37 Cal.4th at pp. 433-434.)\n        Defendant contends her attorney was ineffective for not objecting on this\nground. However, an objection on hearsay grounds would have been specious.\nEvidence Code section 1220 makes a “statement” of a party an exception to the\ngeneral rule forbidding hearsay evidence when the statement is offered against that\nparty. Defendant argues that nothing in her deposition testimony could be\nconsidered an “admission.” The argument is irrelevant. Although Evidence Code\nsection 1220’s exception to the hearsay rule is sometimes referred to an exception\nfor admissions, the exception is not so limited. (People v. Horning (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2623194\"><a href=\"/opinion/2623194/people-v-horning/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">871</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 898, fn. 5.) Instead, the exception applies to all statements of the\nparty against whom they are offered. Here, defendant’s deposition testimony\nconsisted of statements, defendant made the statements, the statements were\noffered against her, and she was a party to this action. Thus, the statements came\nwithin an exception to the hearsay rule. (Id. at p. 898.) They were admissible\nagainst defendant.\n        Next, defendant contends that Dr. Knauss “was permitted to testify beyond\nthe scope of his expertise” both in his initial testimony at the preliminary inquiry\nand before the jury. She did not object on this ground. Indeed, for purposes of the\n\n\n\n                                         64\n\fpreliminary inquiry, defense counsel stipulated that Dr. Knauss “is a qualified\ncourt expert on the failure of viscous materials, including rubbers.” Accordingly,\nthis contention is not cognizable on appeal. (People v. Partida, supra, 37 Cal.4th\nat pp. 433-434.) Moreover, the trial court would have had discretion to admit the\nevidence had defendant objected.\n       Dr. Knauss was a professor at Caltech and had been since 1965. He\nreceived a Ph.D. in aeronautics from Caltech, but “the topic of [his] research has\nbeen ever since [his] graduate, student graduate days, failure and fracture of\npolymers, which includes rubbers.” Of his approximately 150-160 publications,\nabout 25-30 percent concerned the fracture of polymers. He had testified in court\n“as an expert on the failures of rubbers, how rubbers fracture and why they\nfracture” about 30 times.\n       “A person is qualified to testify as an expert if he has special knowledge,\nskill, experience, training, or education sufficient to qualify him as an expert on\nthe subject to which his testimony relates.” (Evid. Code, § 720, subd. (a).)\nDetermining whether a witness qualifies as an expert comes within a trial court’s\ndiscretion. (People v. Eubanks (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844239\"><a href=\"/opinion/844239/people-v-dement/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">10, 140.) Given Dr. Knauss’s\nimpressive qualifications, the trial court certainly had discretion to permit him to\ntestify as an expert regarding the fracture of rubbers such as the rubber in the\npacifier involved in the death of defendant’s infant daughter. Defendant cites\nportions of his testimony, largely on cross-examination, in which, for example, he\ntestified that before he tested the pacifier parts, he had had little or no experience\nwith, specifically, baby pacifiers. But such matters merely go to the weight of Dr.\nKnauss’s testimony, not its admissibility. “Defendant was entitled to attack [the\nexpert’s] credibility regarding the claimed basis of [his] opinion, but questions\nregarding the validity or credibility of an expert’s knowledge go to the weight of\nsuch testimony, not its admissibility.” (People v. Eubanks, supra, at p. 143.) Dr.\n\n                                          65\n\fKnauss was an expert on why and how rubbers fracture, so he was entitled to\nexpress an opinion regarding whether the actions of a baby could have cause the\npacifier at issue to fracture. As in Eubanks, defendant was able to question the\nwitness’s conclusions and the foundation for his opinions through cross-\nexamination and additionally to present her own expert on the same matter. (Ibid.)\n       Defendant did object to some of Dr. Knauss’s testimony at the preliminary\ninquiry on the ground of lack of foundation, once successfully, other times\nunsuccessfully. To the extent defendant bases her argument on these objections,\nthe contention is cognizable. But we see no error here either. Over a lack-of-\nfoundation objection, the court permitted the witness to testify that he would not\nexpect a baby’s teeth to come into contact with the area where the separation\noccurred, given how close that place was to the shield, and that it was “not\nfeasible” for a 13-month-old infant with two teeth to have sucked the pacifier apart\nif it was otherwise intact. The witness explained this opinion in detail, basing it on\nhis experience and his close examination of the pacifier parts. The trial court had\ndiscretion to conclude this opinion was sufficiently founded to go to the jury.\n(People v. Eubanks, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 142.) “When expert opinion is offered,\nmuch must be left to the trial court’s discretion.” (People v. Carpenter (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 403.)\n       To the extent defendant argues Dr. Knauss’s testimony was not proper\nopinion because it was based in part on what could be considered common sense\nor common knowledge, such as his testimony that a baby’s teeth would not come\ninto contact with an area of the rubber within a few millimeters of the shield, that\ntoo presents no basis to exclude his testimony. Although an expert’s opinion\ntestimony is limited “to a subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience\nthat the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact” (Evid. Code, § 801,\nsubd. (a)), the jury does not have to be wholly ignorant of the opinion’s subject\n\n                                         66\n\fmatter for it to be admissible. (People v. Edwards (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 709;\nPeople v. Farnam (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2521268\"><a href=\"/opinion/2521268/people-v-farnam/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 162-163.) “Here, we cannot say that\n[the expert’s] testimony would not have assisted the jury (Evid. Code, § 801, subd.\n(a)) or that ‘ “it would add nothing at all to the jury’s common fund of\ninformation.” ’ ” (People v. Farnam, supra, at p. 163.) Expert testimony\nregarding what does and does not cause rubber to fracture is sufficiently beyond\ncommon experience to be admissible even if parts of that testimony refer to\nmatters within common knowledge.\n       The court properly permitted both Dr. Knauss and Dr. Hamed to testify and\nlet the jury judge who was more credible.\n       Finally, defendant contends the court erred in not permitting Attorney\nNovak to provide certain expert opinion testimony. Novak testified outside the\njury’s presence that, given the large amount of the settlement ($710,000), he did\nnot believe Gerber settled defendant’s lawsuit merely for its nuisance value. He\ndid not believe the assessment of nuisance value included potential loss of\nreputation to the defendant. But he also testified that he had “never worked as a\ndefense lawyer, so I would speculate as to what they do.” He had “no\ninformation” regarding whether “Gerber had done any projections to see what\nkind of damage a public trial on this incident might cause to their ability to do\nbusiness in the baby industry, whether or not they prevailed in the lawsuit.” He\nhad “no idea what motivated” Gerber in deciding whether to pursue the lawsuit to\nits end.\n       In response to the prosecutor’s objection to this opinion testimony, the\ncourt expressed this concern: “If the suggestion is or at least with this witness’s\nopinion, Mr. Novak, that this was more than nuisance value, he does not, as I\nasked him to define it, take into that definition loss of reputation to Gerber Foods.\nThey may well feel that this was a nuisance case, that they could defeat it, but that\n\n                                         67\n\fin the process they would lose substantial income based on the loss and faith of\nother customers. So not only as to the pacifier but as to their other products, and\nhe does not know to what extent that calculation would enter into the total value\nthat Gerber agreed would be sufficient to make the case go away.” After hearing\nargument from both sides, the court sustained the prosecutor’s objection to the\nquestion “whether this witness believes that settlement was more than for nuisance\nvalue.” It made clear, however, that either side could argue to the jury whether\nthe large settlement was merely for nuisance value.\n       Defendant contends the court erred in not allowing Novak to express his\nopinion regarding nuisance value. This question, too, comes within the trial\ncourt’s discretion, reviewed for abuse of that discretion. (People v. McDowell\n(2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">395</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 426.) We see no abuse of discretion. Attorney Novak\nadmitted he had never been a civil defense attorney and did not know what factors\nmotivated defendants to settle cases. He did not consider potential loss of\nreputation in his definition of “nuisance value,” but he had no information or\nexpertise to support his apparent assumption that corporate defendants and their\nattorneys do not do so. Obviously, $710,000 is a lot of money, and defendant\ncould argue to the jury that Gerber did not settle the case for that amount only for\nits nuisance value. But the trial court had discretion to conclude that Novak had\nno particular expertise that would assist the jury.\n       Moreover, whether Gerber settled the lawsuit for more than nuisance value\n(perhaps suggesting it believed the lawsuit had merit), while probably relevant,\nwas not particularly important. The prosecution’s penalty phase case against\ndefendant was very different from the case Gerber faced. When Gerber settled the\nlawsuit, defendant had not yet murdered her husband to collect on a life insurance\npolicy, a murder that made the earlier death of her insured daughter far more\nsuspicious. The record does not indicate whether Gerber was even aware that\n\n                                          68\n\fdefendant had insured the baby’s life. (The trial court sustained defendant’s\nobjection to the prosecutor’s asking Novak whether Novak was aware of the life\ninsurance policy when he represented defendant.) Gerber also was unaware of Dr.\nKnauss’s report. Accordingly, whether Gerber believed the lawsuit it faced was\nmeritorious had little relevance to the jury’s determination whether defendant\nmurdered her daughter. Any error would have been harmless.\n\n               d. Instructional claims\n       Defendant contends the court committed two errors in instructing the jury.\n       First, she argues that if her deposition testimony was only admissible to\nshow “consciousness of guilt,” the court erred in failing to so instruct the jury.\nHowever, as discussed above (pt. II. C. 2. c.), her deposition testimony was\nadmissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. Accordingly, it was not admitted\nfor a limited purpose such as consciousness of guilt, but for any relevant purpose.\n       Second, defendant contends the court failed to instruct properly regarding\nthe evidence that she murdered her daughter, apparently on the basis that it did not\ninstruct that a juror may consider that evidence only if the juror found beyond a\nreasonable doubt that she committed the murder. (See People v. Robertson (1982)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1177807\"><a href=\"/opinion/1177807/people-v-robertson/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 53-54.) However, the court instructed the jury that “evidence has\nbeen introduced for the purpose of showing that the defendant has committed the\nfollowing criminal acts: Murder and solicitation of murder, which involved the\nexpress or implied use of force or violence. Before a juror may consider any\ncriminal act as an aggravating circumstance in this case, a juror must first be\nsatisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did in fact commit the\ncriminal act. A juror may not consider any evidence of any other criminal act as\nan aggravating circumstance.” Immediately thereafter, the court defined\n\n\n\n\n                                          69\n\freasonable doubt. Defendant does not explain how these instructions were\ninsufficient. We see no error.\n\n           3. Admission of Another Item of Other Crimes Evidence\n       The prosecution’s pretrial notice of aggravating evidence included\n“defendant’s post-arrest solicitation of the murder of and/or assault upon People’s\nwitnesses Erlinda Allen and Palmira Gorham.” Some of the taped conversations\nthat the prosecution offered into evidence contain references to Allen (who went\nby the name “Linda”) as well as Gorham. Defendant objected to the references to\nAllen. After reviewing the transcripts, the trial court overruled the objection. It\nfound the discussion about Allen was “part of the conversation regarding\nelimination of witnesses. Even though it’s not a charged offense, it does tend to\nsuggest that that’s what she intended to do to carry it out.”\n       Accordingly, the jury heard the following. Erlinda Allen was an inmate\nwhom investigators had interviewed regarding this case. She had once been\nhoused either with or next to defendant in county jail and later served time at a\nprison for women in Chowchilla. In a taped conversation with investigators, Hall\nsaid that defendant had told her she had received a letter from Chowchilla.\nDefendant “want[ed] some people to do somethin’ to Linda . . . in prison and stuff\nlike that.” Hall said that someone had told defendant that “when you have drug\ndebts in prison, if you don’t pay, they . . . go get somebody blood that’s HIV or\nAIDS positive and shoot you in the back with it. And that’s what she wants\nsomebody to do to Linda.” Hall had the impression that defendant expected that\nshe (Hall) would get some friends to do this. In a conversation between Hall and\ndefendant recorded on May 10, 2002, defendant said that at Chowchilla, “they\nhave their own system. They have their own accountability over there. You know\nwhat I mean?” Later in that conversation, defendant said she had “friends at\n\n\n\n                                          70\n\fChowchilla.” In later conversations between Hall and defendant, defendant\nreferred to getting “those two out of the way” (in context referring to Allen and\nGorham), said in reference to Allen that “you know she’s playing herself out.\nRight?” and said that Allen had “already buried herself.”\n        For two reasons, defendant contends the court erred in admitting the\nevidence. We see no abuse of discretion. (People v. Jones, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p.\n380.)\n        First, defendant argues that Allen did not actually testify at the trial. While\ncorrect, this circumstance makes no difference. Defendant had notice that the\nprosecution intended to rely on this evidence. Penalty phase evidence of other\ncrimes is not limited to crimes against witnesses who testify at the trial.\n        Second, defendant contends there was insufficient evidence she committed\na qualifying crime against Allen. Only “criminal activity by the defendant which\ninvolved the use or attempted use of force or violence or the express or implied\nthreat to use force or violence” is admissible. (§ 190.3, factor (b).) Evidence\nunder section 190.3, factor (b), is “limited to evidence of conduct that\ndemonstrates the commission of an actual crime, specifically, the violation of a\npenal statute.” (People v. Phillips, supra, 41 Cal.3d at p. 72.) Although the\nevidence regarding defendant’s intentions as to Allen was not as compelling as the\nevidence regarding Gorham, the trial court had discretion to conclude that, in\ncontext, a reasonable jury could conclude that defendant’s many comments about\nAllen to Hall constituted the solicitation of a crime of violence against Allen.\n(§ 653f; see People v. Wilson (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2590700\"><a href=\"/opinion/2590700/people-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 328.)\n        Moreover, any error in this regard would have been harmless. The\nreferences to Allen pale in significance compared to the compelling evidence that\ndefendant first sought to dissuade Gorham from testifying and later solicited her\nmurder, and even that evidence was far less aggravating than the circumstances of\n\n                                           71\n\fFrank’s murder and the evidence of defendant’s earlier murder of her daughter.\nWe see no reasonable possibility the penalty verdict would have been different had\nthe court ordered all references to Allen redacted from the recorded conversations\nthe jury heard. (People v. McDowell, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 434.)\n\n           4. Asserted Violation of Confrontation Rights\n       Defendant contends her right to confront witnesses was violated on three\noccasions at the penalty phase.\n       First, defendant contends admission of Hall’s statements to law\nenforcement agents prejudiced her at the penalty phase. At defendant’s request,\nduring the penalty phase, Hall testified again, this time outside the jury’s presence.\nAgain she denied any memory of the conversations regarding this case. The court\nagain found untruthful her claim not to remember. It found no reason, and\ndefendant expressed none, to require her to testify again in front of the jury. Later,\nthe jury heard tape recordings of Hall’s conversations with investigators and\ndefendant, authenticated by law enforcement witnesses. As discussed in part\nII. B. 2. b., ante, because Hall testified, defendant’s right to confront her was not\nviolated. We see no need for the court to have required her to testify a second\ntime in front of the jury. Defendant had already confronted Hall at the guilt phase\nand again outside the jury’s presence during the penalty phase. She could have\nbut did not ask that Hall testify again in the jury’s presence.\n       Moreover, any error would have been harmless. Defendant’s recorded\nconversations with Hall and her videotaped meeting in jail with Detective Valdez,\nposing as the fictitious middleman Antonio Davis — evidence presented through\nwitnesses whom defendant confronted — provided far more vivid and convincing\nevidence of defendant’s solicitation of Gorham’s murder than Hall’s statements to\nthe investigators.\n\n\n\n                                          72\n\f       Second, defendant challenges a portion of the testimony regarding the\nautopsy performed on her daughter, Alicia. Dr. Wallace Carroll testified that he\nand his staff performed the autopsy. He had “viewed the body and returned for the\nview of the organs and so forth and reviewed all the dictation and so forth.” He\ntestified that Alicia had two teeth when she died, specifically, the two lower front\nteeth. On cross- and redirect examination, he clarified that Dr. Ducale, an\nassistant who performed the actual autopsy, had made the observation and\nrecorded the note in the autopsy report regarding the teeth. He did not himself\nobserve the teeth.\n       Defendant contends that the statements regarding Alicia’s teeth were\n“testimonial” under Crawford, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and, because she had no\nopportunity to cross-examine Dr. Ducale, her confrontation rights were violated.\nShe did not object on this basis at trial but, because the trial predated Crawford,\nshe may make this argument. (People v. Pearson, supra, 56 Cal.4th at pp. 461-\n462.) The contention, however, lacks merit.\n       Objective observations in an autopsy report, such as the number and\nlocation of the decedent’s teeth, that are not made with a primary purpose of\naiding a criminal investigation, are not testimonial under Crawford, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. (People v. Edwards, supra, 57 Cal.4th at pp. 704-706; People v. Dungo\n(2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">608</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 619-621; see Dungo, at pp. 621-627 (conc. opn. of\nWerdegar, J.), 629-633 (conc. opn. of Chin, J.).) As we explained in Dungo,\nautopsy reports are used not only for criminal investigation and prosecution but\nalso for other purposes. “For example, the decedent’s relatives may use an\nautopsy report in determining whether to file an action for wrongful death.”\n(Dungo, at p. 621.) This example likely applies here. Defendant and her then\nhusband likely used the autopsy report in their wrongful death action against\nGerber. In any event, the autopsy report was not prepared with a primary purpose\n\n                                         73\n\frelated to criminal investigation. And certainly Dr. Ducale did not note the\nnumber and location of the teeth with the primary purpose to further a criminal\ninvestigation. “In summary,” to adapt our discussion in Dungo to this case, Dr.\nCarroll’s “description to the jury of objective facts about the condition of victim\n[Alicia’s] body, facts he derived from [Dr. Ducale’s] autopsy report . . . , did not\ngive defendant a right to confront and cross examine [Dr. Ducale].” (Ibid.)\n       Finally, defendant contends a portion of the prosecution’s cross-\nexamination of Dr. Vicary, the psychiatrist who testified on defendant’s behalf,\nviolated her right to confront her daughter, Autumn. This issue arose under the\nfollowing circumstances.\n       Outside the jury’s presence, the prosecutor alerted the court that\ndefendant’s attorney had asked him to contact Thomas, Autumn’s father and\ndefendant’s former husband, to make Autumn available to testify for the defense.\nThe prosecutor said that Thomas had “expressed to me his vehement objection that\nhis daughter be dragged through this in any way.” He told Thomas that he would\nrepresent “to the court and defense counsel that I would make Autumn available,”\nand that she probably would have to testify. Thomas agreed to bring her to court.\nThe prosecutor also said that if defendant did call Autumn as a witness, “I believe\nit opens the door to cross-examination of Autumn regarding her role in the death\nof Frank Rodriguez the night that he died. She gave us a statement the same day\nthat the defendant was arrested wherein she basically told us that there was a\nspecial bottle of Gatorade for Frank, that she was not allowed to have any, and that\nher mother asked her to help feed Frank the Gatorade, and she did in fact help feed\nFrank the Gatorade the last time he was alive.” The prosecutor believed this\nevidence would be relevant if Autumn testified on defendant’s behalf.\n       The prosecutor later clarified that Autumn had made three statements, all of\nwhich he had provided the defense in discovery. The first two were largely\n\n                                          74\n\fconsistent with each other and stated what he had represented. In the third, much\nmore recent, statement, “her story had changed significantly.” Because of this\nchange, and because of “concerns about her emotional state being involved as a\nwitness for the prosecution in a death penalty case involving her mother,” he had\ndecided not to call Autumn as his own witness. But he argued that, if defendant\ncalled her as a witness, he could cross-examine her about her earlier statements\nand, if necessary, admit them as prior inconsistent statements.\n       Defense counsel argued that defendant had a right to call Autumn as a\nwitness even over Thomas’s objection, and that if Autumn’s testimony were\nnarrow enough in scope, the prosecutor should not be allowed to cross-examine\nher regarding these statements. The court agreed defendant had the right to call\nAutumn as a witness. It also tentatively indicated that if defendant did call her as\na witness, the prosecutor could cross-examine her regarding her prior statement. It\nagreed, however, to hold a hearing on the question.\n       The next day, Thomas addressed the court and expressed concerns about\nAutumn’s testifying. While sympathetic with Thomas’s concerns, the court ruled\nthat defendant had the right to call her as a witness. The prosecutor stated that if\nher testimony were limited and not too emotional, he “would refrain, in the\ninterest of [Thomas’s] concerns and also concerns I have for Autumn, from going\ninto [her prior statements], although I really want to reserve my final decision until\nI see just where direct goes.”\n       Autumn then testified very briefly in front of the jury as a defense witness.\nShe said she “would like it for you [the jury] not to execute [defendant] and make\nit so I can see her.” The prosecutor did not cross-examine her.\n       Later, Dr. Vicary testified for defendant. On direct examination, he said he\nbased his expert opinion on various sources of information, including interviews\nwith defendant, her mother, her sister, and her cousin. Among the many\n\n                                          75\n\fdocuments he reviewed in forming his opinion was Dr. Romanoff’s “very\nthorough and very lengthy” psychological evaluation of defendant. When asked\nwhether certain factors would prevent defendant from being a loving mother, he\nresponded that he “found her to be the most emotional and the most animated\nwhen she was talking about her children. She said in all her life, none of her\nrelationships had ever worked, and that she had only two happy experiences, the\nbirth of her two little girls.” History that her relatives supplied indicated that\n“defendant was a very attentive, loving, supportive mother.”\n       On cross-examination, Dr. Vicary reiterated that he had relied on Dr.\nRomanoff’s evaluation, which was based partly on defendant’s own statements.\nThe prosecutor cross-examined Dr. Vicary extensively about this evaluation,\nincluding various lies that defendant had told Dr. Romanoff as reported in the\nevaluation. At one point, the prosecutor asked whether Dr. Romanoff had\nconfronted defendant with a police report that “indicated that her daughter had\nbeen interviewed and had told the police that her mother had fed her . . . step-\nfather Gatorade and that she had been told by her mother she couldn’t have any of\nthat Gatorade.” Dr. Vicary testified that Dr. Romanoff had so confronted\ndefendant. The explanation defendant gave Dr. Romanoff for not letting Autumn\nhave any Gatorade was “because money was so tight and we needed the Gatorade\nfor him.” Dr. Vicary agreed that this was another lie that defendant had told Dr.\nRomanoff.\n       Later, the prosecutor cross-examined Dr. Vicary regarding his opinion that\ndefendant was a loving mother. He asked whether Dr. Vicary was aware that\nAutumn had told investigators that the night Frank died, “her mother made him\ndrink a whole bottle of red Gatorade,” and that she (Autumn) “had helped her\nmother feed him the Gatorade.” Dr. Vicary answered that he was aware of that\nand said that defendant’s using her nine-year-old daughter as an unwitting\n\n                                          76\n\faccomplice in the murder was a “horrible, indefensible act.” However,\n“considering all the data,” this circumstance did not alter his opinion that\ndefendant was a loving and supportive mother.\n       Defendant contends that the prosecutor’s cross-examining Dr. Vicary\nregarding Autumn’s statements violated her right to confront Autumn. Again, she\ndid not object on this basis at trial, but she can argue that the testimony violated\nher rights under Crawford, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n       If Autumn’s statements had been offered and used as substantive evidence\nfor their truth — that is, if the prosecution had used these statements as affirmative\nevidence to show aggravating circumstances of the crime — state law would\nclearly have been violated. The statements were hearsay and no exception to the\nhearsay rule appears. But the prosecutor did not offer or use the statements as\nsubstantive evidence but for a nonhearsay purpose that California law has long\npermitted.\n       Under state law, an expert such as a psychiatrist may rely on various\nsources of information, including hearsay, in forming an opinion, and a party may\nquestion that expert about that information to test the expert’s credibility. “A\nparty ‘may cross-examine an expert witness more extensively and searchingly than\na lay witness, and the prosecution was entitled to attempt to discredit the expert’s\nopinion. [Citation.] In cross-examining a psychiatric expert witness, the\nprosecutor’s good faith questions are proper even when they are, of necessity,\nbased on facts not in evidence.’ ” (People v. Wilson, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 358,\nquoting People v. Dennis (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1111213\"><a href=\"/opinion/1111213/people-v-dennis/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 519.) This court explained the\nreasons for this rule long ago. “ ‘ “Once an expert offers his opinion, however, he\nexposes himself to the kind of inquiry which ordinarily would have no place in the\ncross-examination of a factual witness. The expert invites investigation into the\nextent of his knowledge, the reasons for his opinion including facts and other\n\n                                          77\n\fmatters upon which it is based [citation], and which he took into consideration;\nand he may be ‘subjected to the most rigid cross-examination’ concerning his\nqualifications, and his opinion and its sources [citation].” (Italics added.)’ ”\n(People v. Nye (1969) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2619604\"><a href=\"/opinion/2619604/people-v-nye/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 374-375.)\n       The prosecutor used Autumn’s statements in cross-examining Dr. Vicary\nexactly and only as this rule permits. Dr. Vicary based his opinion on many\nhearsay sources, including interviews with defendant and Dr. Romanoff’s\nevaluation. Under state law, the prosecutor was entitled to explore with Dr.\nVicary occasions in which he had reason to believe defendant had lied, to attempt\nto discredit his reliance on defendant’s other statements, and to attempt to discredit\nDr. Vicary’s opinion that defendant was a loving mother by establishing that he\nmaintained that opinion despite his knowledge of Autumn’s statements.\n       Contrary to defendant’s contention, in arguing the case to the jury, the\nprosecutor cited Autumn’s statements only for this nonhearsay purpose. Indeed, at\ndefense request, the court conducted a hearing outside the jury’s presence\nregarding how the prosecutor could discuss Autumn’s statements in front of the\njury. The prosecutor agreed he could not use these statements as substantive\nevidence but only to challenge Dr. Vicary’s credibility. After this hearing, in\nargument to the jury, the prosecutor referred to the statements in discussing how\nmuch weight the jury should give defendant’s evidence in mitigation.\nSpecifically, he argued that Dr. Vicary’s opinion that defendant was a good\nmother should not be credited when he adhered to that opinion despite knowing of\nAutumn’s statements. He did not argue that Autumn’s statements constituted\nsubstantive evidence of aggravating circumstances of the crime.\n       The court did not give an instruction limiting the use the jury could make of\nthis cross-examination. Defendant did not request one, and the court has no duty\nto give a limiting instruction absent a request. (People v. Maury (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n\n                                          <span class=\"page\">78</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\f342, 394.) As it was, the jury merely heard a few questions regarding Autumn’s\nstatements during a lengthy cross-examination of the defense expert and a brief,\nlimited mention in the prosecutor’s argument regarding that expert’s credibility.\nDefense counsel could reasonably not have wanted the court to give a limiting\ninstruction, which might have suggested to the jury that, logically if not legally,\nthe evidence was aggravating.\n       We need not decide whether and, if so, how Crawford, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nand its progeny have affected the rule permitting cross-examination of experts for\nthis nonhearsay purpose. Under the unusual facts of this case, we see no denial of\ndefendant’s opportunity to cross-examine Autumn. Knowing of Autumn’s prior\nstatements (and presumably of the rule permitting wide-ranging cross-examination\nof expert witnesses), defendant called Autumn as her own witness. She had full\nopportunity to examine her on her statements, either at that time or later. That she\ndid not take advantage of this opportunity is understandable; if she had actually\nconfronted Autumn about the statements, the jury could have considered them for\ntheir truth and not merely as they bore on Dr. Vicary’s credibility, and the jury\nwould likely have credited them. From defendant’s perspective, no doubt, the less\nsaid of those statements, the better. But she did have the opportunity to examine\nAutumn in any way she may have wished.\n       In any event, any improper use of Autumn’s statements would have been\nharmless. We see no reasonable possibility the jury’s penalty decision turned on\nwhether it believed defendant gave Autumn some of the Gatorade to give to Frank.\nOr, to state the equivalent (People v. Gonzalez (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639585\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639585/people-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 961), any\nerror would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n\n\n                                          79\n\f           5. Argument and Instructions Regarding the Mitigating Effect of an\n               Emotional or Mental Disturbance\n       The trial court instructed the jury regarding the statutory factors it should\nconsider in its penalty determination, including factor (d) of section 190.3:\n“Whether or not the offense was committed while the defendant was under the\ninfluence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.” It also gave the expanded\ncatchall instruction under section 190.3, factor (k), that we recommended in\nPeople v. Easley (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2605280\"><a href=\"/opinion/2605280/people-v-easley/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 878, footnote 10. Specifically, it\ninstructed the jury to consider “any other circumstance which extenuates the\ngravity of the crime, even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime, and any\nsympathetic or other aspect of the defendant’s character or record that the\ndefendant offers as a basis for a sentence less than death, whether or not related to\nthe offense for which she is on trial.”\n       Defendant contends the court erred in referring to an “extreme” mental or\nemotional disturbance because the reference prevented the jury from considering a\nmental or emotional disturbance that was less than extreme. We have repeatedly\nrejected the contention because the catchall instruction permits the jury to consider\nany evidence the defendant offers in mitigation, including any lesser mental or\nemotional disturbance. (E.g., People v. Moore (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 416-417;\nsee Blystone v.

We disagree.\nThe prosecutor argued that defendant had presented no evidence of extreme\n\n\n\n                                          80\n\fmental or emotional disturbance under section 190.3, factor (d). Indeed, he argued\nthere was no “evidence in this case of any mental disease or intoxication. Dr.\nVicary didn’t talk to you about any mental disease. He didn’t give any clinical\ndiagnosis she was pathological in some sense or psychotic or [had] no impulse\ncontrol. She has no such mental disease.” This was a fair comment on the\nevidence. “Nothing in the prosecutor’s argument or the court’s instructions . . .\nprecluded the jury from considering the evidence of defendant’s mental\nimpairments, whether under factor (d) (to the extent jurors disagreed with the\nprosecutor’s assessment of the impairments as less than extreme), section 190.3,\nfactor (h) (referring to ‘mental disease or defect’ as potentially impairing\ndefendant’s ability to appreciate the criminality of [her] conduct or conform it to\nthe law’s requirements) or the catchall factor (k).” (People v. Moore, supra, 51\nCal.4th at p. 416.) Indeed, the prosecutor specifically told the jury that under the\n“catchall provision,” it could “consider any other extenuating circumstance that\nyou find to be present in this case.”\n       “As defendant was neither prevented from introducing evidence of mental\nimpairment, nor precluded from arguing its relevance and force as mitigation, or\nfrom having it considered as such, we see no infringement on defendant’s rights\nunder the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution.” (People v. Moore, supra, 51 Cal.4th at pp. 416-417.)\n\n           6. Denial of the Automatic Motion to Modify the Verdict\n       Defendant contends the court erred in denying her automatic motion to\nmodify the jury’s verdict of death. “In ruling on defendant’s application for\nmodification of the verdict, the trial court must reweigh the evidence; consider the\naggravating and mitigating circumstances; and determine whether, in its\nindependent judgment, the weight of the evidence supports the jury’s verdict.\n\n\n\n                                          81\n\f[Citation.] On appeal, although the trial court’s ruling is subject to independent\nreview, we do not make a de novo determination of penalty.” (People v. Brady\n(2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2387577\"><a href=\"/opinion/2387577/people-v-brady/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 588.)\n       Defendant’s written motion to modify the verdict contained a supplemental\nreport by Dr. Vicary stating, in part, Dr. Vicary’s belief that defendant was\ngenuinely remorseful for the crime. In arguing the motion, defense counsel\nreferred to the report, including its opinion regarding defendant’s remorse. The\ncourt interjected: “How do you square what the doctor has said, Dr. Vicary’s\n[supplemental] report . . . , where he says the defendant does have remorse for the\nmurder of her husband . . . ? There’s been no indication of remorse at all during\nthe trial, and in fact it’s hard to believe that there would be any remorse. He was\nonly married for a few months when she created the circumstances under which he\nreceived a $250,000 life insurance with her as a beneficiary, and two months after\nthat roughly attempts to kill him through the use of loosening the gas connection,\nwhich also endangered not only her husband but also the community around her\nhusband in the event that there had been an explosion, then attempting to poison\nhim with oleander poisoning, and on the failure of that a week later poisoning him\nfor a long period of time with antifreeze. And I have to say it is the coldest killing\nI’ve ever seen. Most of the murders, and most of the cases we have are murder\ncases in this court, over the past 20 years I’ve never seen a colder heart. She\nseemed to have no care for the agony that she put her husband through, and the\nsole goal being to make a profit in his death. So I don’t see how the doctor’s\nopinion squares with any of the evidence that I’ve seen throughout this trial.”\n       After the parties argued the matter, the court permitted defendant to address\nit personally, and she did so at length. Thereafter, the court denied the motion in a\ndetailed oral ruling that was also memorialized in a written order filed the same\nday.\n\n                                          82\n\f       Defendant contends the court erred in several regards. Because she failed\nto object on these — or any — grounds, and because the modification hearing\npostdated our decision in People v. Hill (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1190445\"><a href=\"/opinion/1190445/people-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">959</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, she has forfeited\nthese claims. (People v. Brady, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 588.) Moreover, the claims\nlack merit.\n       Defendant contends “the trial court failed to follow the legal requirements\nin denying the motion.” On the contrary, except possibly by considering Dr.\nVicary’s supplemental report, it followed the legal requirements precisely. It\nexpressly recognized its duty “to reweigh the evidence of aggravating and\nmitigating facts and to determine whether in the court’s independent judgment the\nweight of the evidence supports the jury verdict.” It “reviewed the testimony\npresented through an examination of the transcript as well as the court’s own\nextensive notes, has reassessed the credibility of witnesses and evaluated the\nprobative value and force and weight of the evidence and has reviewed the\nexhibits.” It found the prosecution witnesses credible and the proof of defendant’s\nguilt “overwhelming.” It also found, under its independent review, that “the jury’s\nimplicit finding that the circumstances in aggravation substantially outweigh the\ncircumstances in mitigation, warranting the penalty of death as to defendant\nAngelina Rodriguez, is overwhelmingly supported by the evidence.” It reviewed\nall of the statutory aggravating and mitigating factors, including the catchall factor\nprovided in section 190.3, factor (k). It concluded: “In reviewing all of the\nevidence available pursuant to section 190.3 of the Penal Code, and in carefully\nand separately weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors, this court finds\nthat the aggravating evidence as to defendant Angelina Rodriguez . . . did so\nsubstantially outweigh the mitigating evidence that it warrants the imposition of\ndeath instead of life without parole as determined by the jury.”\n\n\n\n                                          83\n\f        It is true, as defendant argues, that the court is supposed to consider only\nthe evidence before the jury. (People v. Brown (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1122475\"><a href=\"/opinion/1122475/people-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 337.) But to\nthe extent, if any, the court considered, at defendant’s request, Dr. Vicary’s\nbelated opinion regarding remorse (to reject that opinion), any error could not\nhave prejudiced defendant. The court considered no other evidence not before the\njury.\n        Defendant contends the court “minimized the mitigating factors or ignored\nthem entirely while exaggerating the aggravating factors and giving them undue\nweight.” It did not do so. It viewed the factors differently than defendant would\nhave it do, but it did consider all the evidence and reached a reasonable\nconclusion. The court must consider all of the evidence, but it need not give any\nparticular weight or, indeed, any weight to any particular evidence offered in\nmitigation. (People v. Scott (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1239182\"><a href=\"/opinion/1239182/people-v-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1222.)\n        It appears that, after engaging in some give and take with defense counsel\nand defendant, the court read a prewritten ruling denying the motion. Defendant\ncontends this shows the court prejudged its decision and failed to consider the\narguments at the hearing. “We disagree. The practice of formulating tentative\nrulings in advance of argument and reducing those tentative rulings to writing is\ncommonplace and unobjectionable. [Citing People v. Hayes (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1351504\"><a href=\"/opinion/1351504/people-v-hayes/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">577</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 644-645.] . . . ‘To do so does not mean that the court is unalterably bound by\nthe writing or that it will not amend or even discard the writing if counsel’s\narguments persuade the court that its tentative views were incorrect. Nothing in\nthe record indicates that the trial court failed to give due consideration to defense\ncounsel’s argument at the hearing.’ (Id. at p. 645.)” (People v.

The court apparently wanted to ensure that if it denied the\nmotion, it did so without inadvertently omitting any of the technical requirements.\n(See People v. Seaton (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2524966\"><a href=\"/opinion/2524966/people-v-seaton/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 696.)\n\n                                          84\n\f       Defendant also contends the court’s comments when defense counsel cited\nDr. Vicary’s supplemental report showed it improperly considered her lack of\nremorse as an aggravating factor. However, those comments showed only that it\nrejected defendant’s claim of remorse as a mitigating factor, not that it considered\nlack of remorse in aggravation. Moreover, the court could properly have\nconsidered in aggravation the facts it cited. The court did not cite defendant’s\nmere failure to express remorse; it cited her actions showing overt remorselessness\nat or near the time of the crime, a proper aggravating circumstance. “Overt\nremorselessness is a statutory sentencing factor in that context, because factor (a)\nof section 190.3 allows the sentencer to evaluate all aggravating and mitigating\naspects of the capital crime itself. Moreover, there is nothing inherent in the issue\nof remorse which makes it mitigating only. The defendant’s overt indifference or\ncallousness toward his misdeed bears significantly on the moral decision whether\na greater punishment, rather than a lesser, should be imposed. [Citation.] [¶] On\nthe other hand, postcrime evidence of remorselessness does not fit within any\nstatutory sentencing factor, and thus should not be urged as aggravating.” (People\nv.

After\ndefendant tried to kill her husband by loosening the gas valves, she tried a second\ntime, giving him enough oleander to send him to the emergency room. Her\nhusband became very ill but did not die. Rather than feel remorse for what she put\nhim through, she tried a third time, this time giving him several times the amount\nof poison (both oleander and antifreeze) needed to kill him. These actions overtly\n\n\n\n                                         85\n\fshowed this was truly a remorseless murder or, as the court put it, among the\n“coldest” of killings. These were relevant aggravating circumstances of the crime.\n        The court properly denied the motion to modify the verdict.\n\n            7. Other Contentions\n        Defendant makes several other contentions, most of which we have\nrepeatedly rejected. We see no reason to reconsider our previous decisions.\n        Except regarding evidence of other crimes, jurors need not find aggravating\nfactors true beyond a reasonable doubt; no instruction on burden of proof is\nneeded; except for the verdict itself, the jury need not achieve unanimity; and the\njury need not make written findings. (People v. Rountree (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n862.) “CALJIC No. 8.88’s use of the words ‘so substantial,’ its use of the word\n‘warrants’ instead of ‘appropriate,’ its failure to instruct the jury that a sentence of\nlife is mandatory if mitigation outweighs aggravation, and its failure to instruct the\njury on a ‘presumption of life’ does not render the instruction invalid.” (Id. at pp.\n862-863.) “Intercase proportionality review is not required.” (Id. at p. 862.)7\n“ ‘International law does not prohibit a sentence of death rendered in accordance\nwith state and federal constitutional and statutory requirements.’ ” (Rountree, at p.\n863.)\n\n\n7       We do provide intracase proportionality review. (People v. Rountree,\nsupra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 860.) Defendant does not specifically request such review,\nbut it would not aid her. She murdered her husband by poisoning him on her third\nattempt to collect on a life insurance policy she insisted he take out, then tried to\ndissuade a witness from testifying and later solicited that witness’s murder. The\njury could reasonably have found that several years earlier, defendant similarly\nmurdered her infant daughter to collect on another life insurance policy she had\ntaken out on that daughter. The sentence of death is not disproportionate to\ndefendant’s personal culpability. It does not shock the conscience. (People v.\nRountree, supra, at p. 862.)\n\n\n\n                                           86\n\f       Contrary to defendant’s argument, the cumulative effect of the asserted\nerrors does not require reversal of the death judgment. Defendant argues that we\nshould excuse any failure by defense counsel to object to any jury instruction. We\nhave found no instructional claim forfeited. She also argues that “this court should\nreview all errors on the merits, rather than invoking procedural bars, because death\nis the ultimate penalty.” However, procedural rules, such as the statutory\nrequirement that a party object to evidence at trial in order to challenge its\nadmissibility on appeal (Evid. Code, § 353), apply to capital cases as well as other\ncases. (People v.

We\ndecline to do so. The rules of court do not permit such incorporation.
