Howell\nCOMMODITY FUTURES TRADING\nCOMMISSION,\n\n                      Defendant.\n\n                                   MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       This is a challenge to a regulation, 17 C.F.R. § 39.13(g)(2)(ii), promulgated by the United\n\nStates Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC” or the “Commission”), which sets\n\nminimum liquidation times for swaps and futures contracts.         The plaintiff Bloomberg L.P.\n\n(“Bloomberg”) claims, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 500,\n\net seq., that the Commission’s regulation is both procedurally and substantively defective and\n\nmust be set aside. Further, the plaintiff has applied for a preliminary injunction against the\n\nchallenged regulation, claiming that a forthcoming phase of a related rule’s implementation will\n\ncause the plaintiff imminent and irreparable harm if the minimum liquidation times are not\n\nenjoined. In this regard, Bloomberg alleges that, unless immediately enjoined, the Commission’s\n\nregulation prescribing minimum liquidation times, when combined with other regulatory and\n\nmarket forces, will encourage the plaintiff’s subscribers to migrate permanently to competitors’\n\ntrading venues. The plaintiff, however, lacks standing to challenge the Commission’s regulation\n\nand has not made a showing of imminent and irreparable harm sufficient to warrant the\n\nextraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction. Therefore, as discussed below, the Court denies\n\n\n\n\n                                                1\n\fthe plaintiff’s application for preliminary injunctive relief and dismisses this case for lack of\n\nstanding.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n       Since this is an administrative law case, it is appropriate first to discuss generally the\n\neconomic and regulatory framework of the challenged rule. Next, the Court will discuss the\n\nfactual and procedural background of the particular rule being challenged.\n\n       A.      Economic and Regulatory Framework\n\n       This case is about how the CFTC regulates the trading of derivatives. “Derivatives are\n\nfinancial contracts whose prices are determined by, or ‘derived’ from, the value of some\n\nunderlying asset, rate, index, or event.” Nat’l Comm’n on the Causes of the Fin. & Econ. Crisis:\n\nThe Financial Crisis Inquiry Report: Final Report 45–46 (2011). These instruments are not used\n\nto form capital or invest; rather, they are used for “hedging business risk or for speculating on\n\nchanges in prices, interest rates, and the like.” Id. at 46. Although derivatives can come in many\n\nforms, there are two categories of derivatives implicated in this lawsuit: “swaps” and “futures.”\n\n               1.      How Swaps and Futures Contracts Are Traded\n\n       “A ‘swap’ is a contract that typically involves an exchange of one or more payments\n\nbased on the underlying value of a notional amount of one or more commodities, or other\n\nfinancial or economic interest,” and it “transfers between the parties the risk of future change in\n\nthat value without also transferring an ownership interest in the underlying asset or liability.”\n\nMem. in Supp. Pl.’s Appl. for Prelim. Inj. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) at 3–4, ECF No. 13 (citing 7 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1a(47)). In essence, the two parties to a swap agreement trade (or “swap”) the cash flows\n\nstemming from the assets or liabilities underlying the agreement. For example, a fixed-to-\n\nfloating interest rate swap is an agreement whereby one party agrees to pay the cash flows\n\nassociated with a fixed interest rate, while the other party agrees to pay the cash flows associated\n                                                 2\n\fwith a referenced floating interest rate (e.g., LIBOR). See, e.g., Financial Crisis Inquiry Report\n\nat 46. A “futures contract” or simply a “future,” by contrast, is “[a]n agreement to buy or sell a\n\nstandardized asset (such as a commodity, stock, or foreign currency) at a fixed price at a future\n\ntime.” BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 746 (9th ed. 2009).\n\n         Futures contracts or their functional equivalents have been traded for millennia. See, e.g.,\n\nMichael P. Jamroz, The Net Capital Rule, 47 BUS. LAW. 863, 890 n.186 (1992) (“The ultimate\n\norigins of the futures markets can be traced to 2000 B.C., where . . . ‘merchants of what is now\n\nBahrein Island took goods on consignment for barter in India.’” (quoting JERRY W. MARKHAM,\n\nTHE HISTORY OF COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING AND ITS REGULATION 3 (1987)). In the United\n\nStates, the first organized futures exchange was the Chicago Board of Trade, which officially\n\nbegan trading futures contracts in the 1860s. See MARKHAM, HISTORY OF COMMODITY FUTURES\n\nTRADING at 4. Indeed, “[b]y 1868, futures contracts had become standardized on the Chicago\n\nBoard of Trade.” Id. at 5. For several decades, futures exchanges operated without any federal\n\nregulatory oversight until 1922 when Congress enacted the Grain Futures Act, Pub. L. No. 67-\n\n331, 42 Stat. 998, which for the first time 1 required grain futures exchanges to be registered as\n\n“contract markets” and also required them to keep detailed records of trading information. See\n\n42 Stat. at 1000 (providing for designation of “contract markets” by Secretary of Agriculture,\n\nand requiring contract markets to keep records of the terms of futures transactions).\n\n         In 1936, Congress replaced the Grain Futures Act with the Commodity Exchange Act\n\n(“CEA”), Pub. L. No. 74-675, 49 Stat. 1491, which broadened federal regulation of futures,\n\n\n\n1\n  The Grain Futures Act was preceded by the Futures Trading Act of 1921, but that statute was declared\nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court shortly after it was enacted. See Hill v. Wallace, 259 U.S. 44, 68–70 (1922).\nOther than the fact that the Grain Futures Act was explicitly premised on Congress’s authority to regulate interstate\ncommerce, as opposed to its taxing power, the statute was “substantially identical to the [Futures Trading Act] that\nwas held unconstitutional.” MARKHAM, HISTORY OF COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING at 13.\n\n                                                         3\n\festablished the Commodity Exchange Commission, 2 and granted that agency the power to\n\nregulate futures traders directly (as opposed to only regulating contract markets). See 49 Stat. at\n\n1492. The CEA also, inter alia, (1) limited speculative positions that could be taken in futures\n\nmarkets, see id. § 5, and (2) established registration requirements for futures brokerage firms\n\nknown as “futures commission merchants,” id. The Commodity Exchange Commission also\n\n“informally urged the exchanges to adopt minimum margin requirements,” even though the\n\nstatute itself contained no authority to require the adoption of minimum margin rules. See\n\nMARKHAM, HISTORY OF COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING at 30. “Several exchanges agreed . . .\n\nand adopted minimum margin rules.” Id.\n\n        In 1974, federal regulation of futures was expanded even further with the enactment of\n\nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act, Pub. L. No. 93-463, 88 Stat. 1389. That\n\nstatute, which forms the basis of the current futures regulatory scheme, created the CFTC as an\n\nindependent federal agency, authorized to seek injunctive relief, to alter the rules of a contract\n\nmarket, and to prescribe trading limits. See Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v.\n\nCurran, 456 U.S. 353, 365–66 (1982); see also CFTC Act § 101, 88 Stat. at 1389 (establishing\n\nthe CFTC “as an independent agency of the United States Government”).\n\n        Since the amendments to the CEA passed in the Futures Trading Act of 1982, the CEA\n\nhas required futures to be traded on centralized exchanges known as “designated contract\n\nmarkets” (“DCMs”), see 7 U.S.C. § 6(a); see also Futures Trading Act of 1982, Pub. L. No. 97-\n\n444, § 204, 96 Stat. 2294, 2299, which are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements that\n\nensure transparency and prudent risk management. For example, a DCM is required to “make\n\npublic daily information on settlement prices, volume, open interest, and opening and closing\n\n2\n  The Commodity Exchange Commission consisted of the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, and\nthe Attorney General. See 49 Stat. at 1492. It was later renamed the Commodity Exchange Authority. See\nMARKHAM, HISTORY OF COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING at 27.\n\n                                                     4\n\franges for actively traded contracts on the contract market.” 7 U.S.C. § 7(d)(8). Specifically,\n\nDCMs are required to make information on prices, trading volume, and other trading information\n\n“readily available to the news media and the general public without charge, in a format that\n\nreadily enables the consideration of such data, no later than the business day following the day to\n\nwhich the information pertains.” 17 C.F.R. §§ 16.01(e), 38.451. Additionally, every transaction\n\nexecuted on a DCM must be “cleared” through an entity called a “derivatives clearing\n\norganization” (“DCO”).          See 17 C.F.R. § 38.601(a); see also Part I.A.2 infra (discussing\n\noperation and regulation of DCOs). 3\n\n        By contrast to the ancient roots of futures contracts, swaps are a much newer\n\nphenomenon. Although “there is some debate regarding the timing of the first modern swap\n\nagreement, scholars generally agree that the execution of a swap agreement between the World\n\nBank and IBM [in 1981] was one of the earliest and most significant transactions in the\n\ndevelopment of the swap market.” Kristin N. Johnson, Things Fall Apart: Regulating the Credit\n\nDefault Swap Commons, 82 U. COLO. L. REV. 167, 193 n.141 (2011); see also Charles R.P.\n\nPouncy, Contemporary Financial Innovation: Orthodoxy and Alternatives, 51 SMU L. REV. 505,\n\n529–30 & n.153 (1998) (tracing roots of the swaps market and discussing the 1981 IBM/World\n\nBank currency swap transaction). Unlike futures, swaps were (before 2010) traded almost\n\nentirely in unregulated “over the counter” (“OTC”) markets, where large financial institutions\n\nacted as derivatives dealers. 4 See Financial Crisis Inquiry Report at 46. In OTC markets,\n\n\n3\n  Although central clearing of futures was not required by federal law until recently, modern clearinghouses for\nfutures have existed since the latter part of the 19th century. See Craig Pirrong, The Clearinghouse Cure,\nREGULATION, Winter 2008–09, at 45 (“The Minneapolis Grain Exchange established the first modern clearinghouse\nfor futures in 1891, and other futures exchanges in the United States adopted clearing in the years between 1891 and\n1925.”).\n4\n  In 2000, Congress enacted the Commodity Futures Modernization Act (“CFMA”), Pub. L. No. 106-554, 114 Stat.\n2763, which “effectively shielded OTC derivatives from virtually all regulation or oversight.” Financial Crisis\nInquiry Report at 48.\n\n                                                         5\n\ftransactions are not required to be cleared, dealers are not required to register with the\n\ngovernment, and trading information is not required to be made public. See id.\n\n         Without regulatory oversight, “OTC derivatives rapidly spiraled out of control and out of\n\nsight, growing to $673 trillion in notional amount.”                    Id. at xxiv.      OTC derivatives then\n\n“contributed significantly” to the global financial crisis in 2008, see id., and Congress responded\n\nby enacting the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank),\n\nPub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010). Dodd-Frank, among other things, (1) placed swaps\n\nwithin the jurisdiction of the CFTC, see Dodd-Frank, § 722(a), 124 Stat. at 1672, (2) required the\n\nCFTC to determine which swaps must be cleared, see id.§ 723(a)(3), 124 Stat. at 1676–77, and\n\n(3) mandated that all cleared swaps be traded like futures—on centralized, regulated exchanges,\n\nsee id., 124 Stat. at 1681; see also S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 34 (2010) (“Trading more derivatives\n\non regulated exchanges should be encouraged because it will result in more price transparency,\n\nefficiency in execution, and liquidity.”). 5 In particular, Dodd-Frank generally requires that all\n\ncleared swaps be traded on either a DCM or a new entity called a “swap execution facility”\n\n(“SEF”).     See 124 Stat. at 1681 (codified at 7 U.S.C. § 2(h)(8)). Since the CFTC’s rules\n\n\n\n\n5\n  The plaintiff contends that the challenged rule is contrary to the purposes of Dodd-Frank because it will put swap\nexecution facilities (“SEFs”) at a competitive disadvantage to DCMs. See, e.g., Pl.’s Mem. at 2 (“Dodd-Frank\nintroduced and sought to foster [SEFs] for the trading of swaps.”); id. at 16 (arguing that challenged rule will “deter\nthe development of the SEFs that Congress sought to encourage through the Dodd-Frank Act”); id. at 21 (arguing\nthat Congress “encouraged” SEFs); id. at 33 (arguing the challenged rule “will have serious adverse effects . . . on\nthe design and purpose of the Dodd-Frank Act”). The plaintiff essentially contends that Dodd-Frank was pro-SEF,\nrather than pro-transparency and pro-risk management, but the statute and its legislative history do not necessarily\nsupport that conclusion. First and foremost, Dodd-Frank explicitly requires cleared swaps to be traded on either a\nDCM or an SEF. See 7 U.S.C. § 2(h)(8). If SEFs were the favorite child, Congress could have designated SEFs the\nexclusive trading venues for swaps, much like DCMs are the exclusive trading venue for futures—but Congress did\nnot do so. Furthermore, the legislative history indicates that Congress was concerned with promoting the\ntransparency and risk management benefits that a regulated, centralized exchange would bring to the swap market—\nnot with promoting the exchange itself. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 33–34 (noting concern with lack of\nmargin requirements, central clearing, price discovery, and transparency in OTC derivatives markets). In short,\nthere is no conclusive legislative evidence that Congress preferred swaps to be traded on SEFs rather than DCMs,\nsince DCMs are also highly regulated, centrally cleared, and transparent marketplaces.\n\n                                                          6\n\fregarding mandatory clearing and SEFs are still being phased in, however, large swaths of swaps\n\ncontinue to be traded OTC. 6\n\n                 2.       Derivatives Clearing Organizations\n\n        DCOs are “clearinghouses or similar entities that enable the parties to a derivatives\n\ntransaction to substitute the credit of the DCO for the credit of the parties to the swap.” Pl.’s\n\nMem. at 7 (citing 7 U.S.C. § 2(h)(2)). A transaction is “cleared” when a member of a DCO uses\n\na novation to interpose itself between the two original counterparties to the derivatives contract,\n\nthereby assuming the credit risk of both counterparties. See, e.g., Adam J. Levitin, Response:\n\nThe Tenuous Case for Derivatives Clearinghouses, 101 GEO. L.J. 445, 451 (2013). “[E]ach\n\nDCM is connected to a single DCO . . . , which clears all futures contracts executed on that\n\nDCM.” Decl. of Dr. Sharon Brown-Hruska (“Brown-Hruska Decl.”) ¶ 17 (May 2, 2013), ECF\n\nNo. 13-4.\n\n        DCO members are generally large financial institutions who “invest capital that the\n\nclearinghouse can use to cover default losses,” and in this way a DCO is “analogous to a mutual\n\ninsurance company.” Pirrong, The Clearinghouse Cure at 46. Unlike a mutual insurance\n\ncompany, however, which charges premiums to the customers it insures, DCOs require their\n\nmembers to post a “margin” or a “performance bond,” which acts as collateral against the\n\npossibility of default. See id.; see also Def.’s Mem. in Opp’n to Pl.’ Appl. for Prelim. Inj.\n\n(“Def.’s Opp’n”) at 3, ECF No. 21. When a trade is first cleared, the DCO collects an initial\n\nmargin payment based on the amount of default risk assumed by the DCO, and then periodically\n\n(usually twice per day), the DCO will “mark positions to market” to ensure that “collateral\n\n\n6\n On June 4, 2013, the Commission published the final SEF rules in the Federal Register. See Core Principles and\nOther Requirements for Swap Execution Facilities, 78 Fed. Reg. 33,476 (June 4, 2013) (codified at 17 C.F.R. pt.\n37). Those SEF rules, however, do not go into effect until August 5, 2013, and prospective SEFs will not generally\nbe required to comply with the new rules until October 2, 2013. Id. at 33,476.\n\n                                                        7\n\freflects current market conditions.” See Pirrong, The Clearinghouse Cure at 46. For example, if\n\nthe price of a commodity goes down during the trading day, the buyer of a futures contract would\n\nbe required to post additional margin “to offset the risk that a buyer might walk away from a\n\nfutures contract in which the agreed-upon price now seems too high.” Id.\n\n        DCOs reference a number of inputs to calculate how much margin they will require for a\n\nparticular trade. In particular, “DCOs calculate the required margin according to a ‘value-at-\n\nrisk’ formula.” Def.’s Opp’n at 3. Value-at-risk (“VaR”) is a formula that uses historical market\n\ndata to predict what portion of a financial portfolio is statistically likely to be at risk of being lost\n\nin the market at any given point in time. See, e.g., The Risks of Financial Modeling: VaR and the\n\nEconomic Meltdown: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Investigations & Oversight of the H.\n\nComm. on Sci. & Tech., 111th Cong. 87 (2009) (statement of Gregg E. Berman, Head of Risk\n\nBusiness, RiskMetrics Group) (explaining how VaR is calculated).                In addition to market\n\nvolatility and other considerations, see id., one “standard input” to the VaR formula “is the\n\namount of time the DCO estimates it will take to liquidate the product or portfolio following a\n\ndefault,” Def.’s Opp’n at 3 & n.1. This is known as the “liquidation time” for a particular\n\nproduct or portfolio. See, e.g., Pl.’s Mem. at 8–9 (“Liquidation time is the estimated amount of\n\ntime it would take a DCO to ‘liquidate’ a position held by a clearing member on behalf of its\n\ncustomer, in the case of default.”). All else being equal, a higher liquidation time typically\n\nresults in a higher initial margin requirement. See id. at 9; see also Def.’s Opp’n at 3 n.1\n\n(providing typical VaR formula).\n\n        One portion of Dodd-Frank put in place eighteen “core principles,” with which DCOs are\n\nrequired to comply. See Dodd Frank, § 725(c), 124 Stat. at 1687–92 (codified at 7 U.S.C. § 7a-\n\n1(c)(2)). One of those principles—Core Principle D—addresses risk management and states\n\n\n\n                                                   8\n\fgenerally that each DCO “shall ensure that the [DCO] possesses the ability to manage the risks\n\nassociated with discharging the responsibilities of the [DCO] through the use of appropriate tools\n\nand procedures.”    7 U.S.C. § 7a-1(c)(2)(D)(i).    Of particular relevance to this case, Core\n\nPrinciple D states that “[t]he margin required from each member and participant of a [DCO]\n\nshall be sufficient to cover potential exposures in normal market conditions.”          Id. § 7a-\n\n1(c)(2)(D)(iv). Further, Core Principle D requires that “[e]ach model and parameter used in\n\nsetting margin requirements under clause (iv) shall be (I) risk-based; and (II) reviewed on a\n\nregular basis.” Id. § 7a-1(c)(2)(D)(v).\n\n       B.      Factual and Procedural Background\n\n               1.      The Proposed Rule\n\n       Pursuant to Dodd-Frank’s DCO Core Principles (including Core Principle D) and the\n\nrulemaking authority delegated by Congress in the CEA, see 7 U.S.C. § 12a(5), the Commission\n\npublished a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) on January 20, 2011.                 See Risk\n\nManagement Requirements for Derivatives Clearing Organizations, 76 Fed Reg. 3698 (proposed\n\nJan. 20, 2011). That NPRM proposed the promulgation of several rules implementing Core\n\nPrinciples C (Participant and Product Eligibility), D (Risk Management), E (Settlement\n\nProcedures), F (Treatment of Funds), G (Default Rules and Procedures), and I (System\n\nSafeguards). See id. at 3698. Of particular relevance to this case, the January 20, 2011 NPRM\n\nproposed a regulation that\n\n       would require a DCO to use margin models that generate initial margin\n       requirements sufficient to cover the DCO’s potential future exposures to clearing\n       members based on price movements in the interval between the last collection of\n       variation margin and the time within which the DCO estimates that it would be\n       able to liquidate a defaulting clearing member’s position (liquidation time).\n\nId. at 3704 (footnote omitted). The NPRM also proposed requiring DCOs to use liquidation\n\ntimes for this margin model that were: (1) “a minimum of five business days for cleared swaps\n\n                                                9\n\fthat are not executed on a DCM,” and (2) “a minimum of one business day for all other products\n\nthat it clears.” Id. The NPRM also proposed that a DCO “would be required to use longer\n\nliquidation times, if appropriate, based on the unique characteristics of particular products or\n\nportfolios.” Id.; see also id. at 3720–21 (proposing language of 17 C.F.R. § 39.13(g)(2)(ii)).\n\n       The Commission justified its proposed minimum liquidation times primarily by reference\n\nto current industry standards for DCOs. In this regard, the NPRM explained that “[a] minimum\n\nof one business day is the current standard that DCOs generally apply to futures and options on\n\nfutures contracts.”   Id. at 3704.   It further explained that “[s]everal clearing organizations\n\ncurrently use a five-day liquidation time in determining margin requirements for certain cleared\n\nswaps,” and thus “[t]he Commission believes that a minimum of five business days is\n\nappropriate for cleared swaps that are not executed on a DCM in that such a time period may be\n\nnecessary to close out swap positions in a cost-effective manner.” Id. Cognizant that it could\n\nbenefit from public comment, however, the Commission also stated that it would “invite[]\n\ncomment regarding whether the minimum liquidation times specified in proposed\n\n§ 39.13(g)(2)(ii) are appropriate, or whether there are minimum liquidation times that are more\n\nappropriate.” Id.\n\n               2.     Public Comments on the Proposed Rule\n\n       At a broader level, the CFTC proposed rules implementing Dodd-Frank’s DCO Core\n\nPrinciples through at least five separate NPRMs, including the January 20, 2011 NPRM\n\ndiscussed above. See 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,335. The Commission had an initial comment period of\n\nsixty days for each NPRM, followed by a thirty-day reopened comment period, which was\n\nfollowed yet again by a late comment period lasting until August 25, 2011. See id. Therefore,\n\npublic comment regarding the January 20, 2011 NPRM lasted for approximately eight months.\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\fDuring that time, the Commission received approximately 119 comment letters directed at the\n\nproposed rules regarding DCO Core Principles. See id. 7\n\n        Numerous commenters remarked specifically on the Commission’s proposed minimum\n\nliquidation times, though even the limited sample of comments submitted to the Court reveal a\n\ndiversity of opinions on the appropriate policy for setting liquidation times. 8 Many of these\n\ncomments took issue with the venue-based approach used in the NPRM.                               For example,\n\nLCH.Clearnet Group Limited—a large derivatives clearinghouse—suggested that “the rules\n\nshould not prescribe differential margining treatment for Swaps with equivalent economic and\n\nrisk profiles based on whether these are executed on a [DCM] or elsewhere.” See Decl. of Mary\n\nT. Connelly (“Connelly Decl.”) Ex. A (“LCH Comment Letter”) at 11, ECF No. 21-2. Similarly,\n\nBlackRock, an asset management firm that represents several derivatives traders, “encourage[d]\n\nthe CFTC not to treat swaps executed on [SEFs] differently from those executed on [DCMs], for\n\npurposes of a DCO’s margin calculation.” Connelly Decl. Ex. B (“BlackRock Comment Letter”)\n\nat 2, ECF No. 21-2; see also Connelly Decl. Ex. H (“Nodal Exchange Comment Letter”) at 2,\n\nECF No. 21-2 (“Nodal Exchange is concerned that the Commission is prescribing initial margin\n\nmethodology requirements based solely on the swap’s execution venue rather than the swap’s\n\ninherent risk characteristics.”).\n\n        In this same vein, numerous commenters raised concerns that the proposed venue-based\n\nrule would have anticompetitive effects in the swap trading platform marketplace. For example,\n\nBlackRock stated that the rule “would raise the cost of executing swaps on SEFs, undermine the\n\n7\n The Commission’s website indicates that it received 116 comment letters responding specifically to the January 20,\n2011 NPRM. See CFTC, Comments for Proposed Rule 76 Fed. Reg. 3698,\nhttp://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/CommentList.aspx?id=957 (last visited June 7, 2013) (listing 116\ncomments).\n8\n At this early stage, the Court does not have the benefit of consulting a comprehensive Administrative Record.\nTherefore, the Court’s summary of the materials considered by the Commission is limited to the evidence that the\nparties have submitted in connection with the plaintiff’s Application for a Preliminary Injunction.\n\n                                                        11\n\fcompetitiveness of SEFs, and restrict artificially the ability of market participants, including\n\nasset managers, to select the best means of execution for their swap transactions.” BlackRock\n\nComment Letter at 3. GFI Group Inc., which is a derivatives broker, was concerned that the\n\nvenue-based approach “would inadvertently place [SEFs] that list cleared swaps for trading at a\n\ndisadvantage relative to [DCMs] that list the same swaps,” which GFI believed was “inconsistent\n\nwith” the CEA’s open-access provisions that “require a DCO to adopt rules providing that all\n\nswaps with the same terms and conditions submitted to the DCO for clearing are economically\n\nequivalent within the DCO.” Connelly Decl. Ex. D (“GFI Comment Letter”) at 1–2, ECF No.\n\n21-2; see also id. at 3 (“[T]he Proposed Rule would effectively place a ‘tax’ on market\n\nparticipants that desire to trade swaps on a SEF and would thus put SEFs at a competitive\n\ndisadvantage that is neither necessary nor appropriate under the [CEA].”).        MarketAxess\n\nCorporation, another dealer-broker, raised similar concerns.       See Connelly Decl. Ex. E\n\n(“MarketAxess Comment Letter”) at 2, ECF No. 21-2 (noting that venue-based approach “would\n\nplace SEFs at a significant competitive disadvantage relative to DCMs and would frustrate\n\ncongressional intent”).\n\n       By contrast, at least one commenter cautioned that competition between DCOs with\n\nregard to margin requirements could prove ruinous. Alice Corporation Pty Ltd, an Australian\n\nfinancial markets research and development company, commented that the Commission should\n\n“[a]void a ‘race to the bottom’ between DCOs.” See Connelly Decl. Ex. I (“Alice Comment\n\nLetter”) at 8, ECF No. 21-2. In particular Alice noted that “[c]ompetition between DCOs has\n\nsystemic risk consequences and careful oversight will be required to ensure competition on\n\nmargin and clearing fees does not increase risk.” Id. Alice went on to remark that “[t]here is\n\ngreat pressure from market participants for offset across different products,” and therefore\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f“[o]ffsets across products with different maturities and risk profiles should be avoided where\n\npossible.” Id.\n\n       As an alternative to a venue-based approach, several commenters advocated for a\n\nprinciples-based approach that would permit each DCO to set liquidation times in its discretion.\n\nSee, e.g., LCH Comment Letter at 11 (suggesting that liquidation times should “be an objective\n\nfunction of the DCO’s measurement of observed market volumes in given products and set at a\n\nperiod that would be sufficient to enable the DCO to adequately hedge or close-out a defaulting\n\nmember’s risk”). In this regard, some commenters suggested adopting the clearing standards set\n\nforth by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and Technical Committee of the\n\nInternational Organization of Securities Commissions (“CPSS-IOSCO”). See Connelly Decl.\n\nEx. C (“Citadel Comment Letter”) at 4, ECF No. 21-2; Connelly Decl. Ex. F (“MFA Comment\n\nLetter”) at 5, ECF No. 21-2. Others suggested simply setting a one-day minimum liquidation\n\ntime for all swaps and futures contracts regardless of trading venue. See GFI Comment Letter at\n\n2; Nodal Exchange Comment Letter at 3.\n\n       By contrast, other comments noted that setting higher liquidation times for certain swaps\n\nthan for other swaps and all futures would be appropriate. For example, LCH commented that\n\n“the current disparity between Swaps and futures contracts requires different risk management\n\ntechniques and clearing processes.” See LCH Comment Letter at 1. Although LCH “expect[ed]\n\ncontract convergence as Swaps become more futures-like,” it commented that “it would be\n\ninappropriate at this stage to impose futures clearing criteria on long-dated, idiosyncratic and less\n\nliquid instruments.” Id. Indeed, LCH explicitly stated that “the proposed time interval of one\n\nbusiness day in [§ 39.13(g)(2)(ii)] is too short” for several reasons, including because “it can, and\n\noften will, be impossible for the DCO to close out the defaulting member’s position within a\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fone-day liquidation period,” which “is particularly important for DCOs clearing less liquid\n\nSwaps.”     Id. at 11.      Nodal Exchange similarly remarked that, although the Commission’s\n\napparent view “that all swaps are inherently customized and lack the standard terms and\n\nconditions of futures contracts, necessitating a longer liquidation time” was not categorically\n\ntrue, it “may be true for many financial swaps.” Nodal Exchange Comment Letter at 2. 9\n\n                 3.       The Final Rule\n\n         After considering this diverse array of public comments, the Commission published its\n\nfinal rule regarding minimum liquidation times (and several other topics) in the Federal Register\n\non November 8, 2011. See Derivatives Clearing Organization General Provisions and Core\n\nPrinciples (“Final Rule”), 76 Fed. Reg. 69,334 (Nov. 8, 2011) (codified at 17 C.F.R. pt. 39).\n\nThis Final Rule, a portion of which is the subject of the instant legal challenge, requires, in\n\npertinent part, that a DCO must use (A) “[a] minimum liquidation time that is one day for futures\n\nand options,” (B) “[a] minimum liquidation time that is one day for swaps on agricultural\n\n\n9\n  Although it took place after the rulemaking challenged in this case and would not be included in the administrative\nrecord for the rule, these same concerns about risk management were echoed at a recent roundtable discussion\norganized by the CFTC, which was submitted by the plaintiff in this case. At that discussion, at least two panelists\ndiscussed their belief that there are fundamental differences in the risk profiles of swaps and futures. For example,\nKim Taylor, who is the president of the DCO affiliated with the CME exchange, pointed out several factors her\nDCO considers in setting liquidation times—such as concentration, accessibility, transparency and continuity of\nliquidity; and default management procedures—and why swaps differ from futures on some of those metrics. See\nTr. of Roundtable at 147:18–150:21 (Jan. 31, 2013), ECF No. 13-5. With particular regard to default management,\nMs. Taylor pointed out that, when a future defaults, the DCO “ha[s] a number of choices generally on how we can\nliquidate,” while with swaps they “really only have a single choice which is to run an auction.” Id. at 150:4–16.\nInterestingly, Ms. Taylor said that, as a result of these differences, “you can effectively be margining [swaps and\nfutures] the same way and come up with different coverage targets [i.e., liquidation times] that would be necessary.”\nId. at 151:3–5. Additionally, Don Wilson, who is the founder and CEO of the DRW Trading Group, which is an\norganization that trades in derivatives on a regular basis, said that “there are important differences between swaps\nand futures” and “swaps incur greater risk to the clearinghouse than economically equivalent and equally liquid\nfutures contracts.” Id. at 138:3–13. Also touching upon default management procedures, Mr. Wilson pointed out\nthe risk differences between the gross omnibus model used for futures and the “legal segregation with operational\ncommingling” (“LSOC”) model that is used for swaps, in the event of a default. See id. at 138:13–140:17. He\nexplained that, under LSOC, there is a higher risk to the DCO from a defaulted swap because there are fewer\nsources of collateral to cover the default before the DCO’s capital reserves need to be tapped to cover the loss. See\nid. at 66:5–18. Under the omnibus model used in futures, by contrast, a DCM will draw on its non-defaulting\ncustomers’ initial margins before the DCO must draw on its capital reserves. He concluded from this that “it’s\nentirely reasonable and it would actually be shocking to me if clearinghouses didn’t charge higher margins for\ncleared swaps than for futures.” Id. at 66:21–67:2 (emphasis added).\n\n                                                        14\n\fcommodities, energy commodities, and metals,” (C) “[a] minimum liquidation time that is five\n\ndays for all other swaps,” or (D) “[s]uch longer liquidation time as is appropriate based on the\n\nspecific characteristics of a particular product or portfolio.” Id. at 69,438 (codified at 17 C.F.R.\n\n§ 39.13(g)(2)(ii)).   The Final Rule further provided that “the Commission, by order, may\n\nestablish shorter or longer liquidation times for particular products or portfolios.” Id.\n\n                       a)      Explaining the Final Rule\n\n       The Commission discussed this minimum-liquidation-time rule by first reviewing the\n\ncomments that it received. The Commission recognized that “[n]umerous commenters objected\n\nto the proposed difference in requirements that would subject swaps that were either executed\n\nbilaterally or executed on a SEF to a minimum five-day liquidation time, while permitting\n\nequivalent swaps that were executed on a DCM to be subject to a minimum one-day liquidation\n\ntime.” Id. at 69,366. After making this observation, the Commission summarized fourteen\n\ndifferent points raised by commenters about the potential negative effects of the venue-based\n\napproach. See id. at 69,366–67. Three of these fourteen points were that the venue-based\n\napproach would (1) “put SEFs at a competitive disadvantage to DCMs,” (2) “undermine the goal\n\nof the Dodd-Frank Act to promote trading of swaps on SEFs,” and (3) “potentially create\n\ndetrimental arbitrage between standardized swaps traded on a SEF and futures contracts with the\n\nsame terms and conditions traded on a DCM.” Id. at 69,366 (citing comment letters from GFI,\n\nMarketAxess, BlackRock, Tradeweb, FXall, and Nodal Exchange).\n\n       The Commission also observed that it received varying perspectives about the\n\nappropriate minimum liquidation times for swaps and futures. In this regard, the Commission\n\nstated that “[c]ommenters variously contended that a liquidation time of five business days may\n\nbe excessive for some swaps, a one-day liquidation period is too short, a one-day liquidation\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fperiod is appropriate for swaps executed on a DCM or a SEF, and a two-day liquidation period is\n\nappropriate for cleared swaps.” Id. at 69,367 (citations omitted). The Commission also noted\n\nthat two commenters “recommended that if the Commission were to mandate minimum\n\nliquidation times in the final rules, it should allow DCOs to apply for exemptions for specific\n\ngroups of swaps if market conditions prove that such minimum liquidation times are excessive.”\n\nId. (citing comments submitted by MFA and Citadel).\n\n       Following this summary of the multifarious commentary, the Commission concluded that\n\nit was “persuaded by the views expressed by numerous commenters that requiring different\n\nminimum liquidation times for cleared swaps that are executed on a DCM and equivalent cleared\n\nswaps that are executed on a SEF could have negative consequences.” Id. As a result, the\n\nCommission determined that a venue-based approach was inappropriate, and that “the same\n\nminimum liquidation time should be used with respect to cleared swaps that are executed\n\nbilaterally.” Id. Furthermore, the Commission “acknowledge[d] the concerns expressed by\n\ncommenters that a five-day liquidation period may be excessive for some swaps.” Id. In this\n\nregard, the Commission cited the fact that certain DCOs “have successfully cleared swaps based\n\non physical commodities using a one-day liquidation time,” while “several DCOs currently use a\n\nfive-day liquidation time in determining margin requirements for certain swaps based on\n\nfinancial instruments.”     Id.   According to the Commission, “[t]hese differences reflect\n\ndifferences in the risk characteristics of the products.” Id.\n\n       After “[w]eighing the advantages and drawbacks of the alternatives,” the Commission\n\nconcluded that “a bright-line requirement, with a provision for making exceptions, will best\n\nserve the public interest.” Id. In this regard, the Commission stated that “a DCO will still have\n\nconsiderable latitude in setting risk-based margin levels,” while at the same time, “establishing a\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fminimum liquidation time will provide legal certainty for an evolving marketplace, will offer a\n\npractical means for assuring that the thousands of different swaps that are going to be cleared . . .\n\nwill have prudent minimum margin requirements, and will prevent a potential ‘race to the\n\nbottom’ by competing DCOs.” Id. The Commission stated that the elimination of the venue-\n\nbased approach “addresses the competitive concerns raised by numerous commenters and\n\nrecognizes that once a swap is cleared, its risk profile is not affected by the method by which it\n\nwas executed.” Id. Furthermore, the Commission observed once again that the five-day/one-day\n\ndistinction between swaps based on physical commodities (i.e., agricultural commodities,\n\nenergy, and metals) and all other swaps was “based on the differing risk characteristics of these\n\nproduct groups and is consistent with existing requirements that reflect the risk assessments\n\nDCOs have made over the course of their experience clearing these types of swaps.” Id. The\n\nCommission specifically noted the existence of five-day liquidation times used by several DCOs\n\n(including LCH, CME, and ICE Clear Credit) for credit-default swaps and interest rate swaps,\n\nwhich, in the Commission’s view were “based on [the DCOs’] assessment of the higher risk\n\nassociated with these products.” Id. at 69,367–68. That higher risk assessment, in turn, was\n\nbased on several “[c]ontributing factors,” including (1) “a concentration of positions among\n\nclearing members,” (2) “the number and variety of products listed,” (3) “the complexity of the\n\nportfolios,” (4) “the long-dated expiration time for many swaps,” and (5) “the challenges of the\n\nliquidation process in the event of a default.” Id. at 69,368.\n\n       Finally, the Commission observed that “to provide further flexibility,” it was including an\n\nadministrative opt-out provision from the minimum liquidation times because “[a]s markets\n\nevolve, it may become appropriate to ease the requirement for certain swaps subject to the five-\n\nday minimum.” Id. Likewise, the Commission recognized that “analysis may reveal that for\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fother products or portfolios the five-day or one-day minimum is insufficient.” Id. In this regard,\n\nthe Commission specifically explained that “in light of the novelty, complexity, and potential\n\nmagnitude of the risk posed by financial swaps, prudential considerations dictate that this type of\n\n[upward] fine-tuning should be used in appropriate circumstances.” Id.\n\n                      b)      Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\n       In a later portion of the Final Rule, the Commission presented its considerations of the\n\ncosts and benefits associated with the minimum-liquidation-time regulation, as required by the\n\nCEA. See 7 U.S.C. § 19(a). Specifically, the CEA requires the Commission to consider five\n\nareas of market and public concern in its cost-benefit analysis, which include (1) protection of\n\nmarket participants and the public; (2) efficiency, competitiveness, and financial integrity of\n\nfutures markets; (3) price discovery; (4) sound risk management principles; and (5) other public\n\ninterest considerations. See id. The Commission discussed each area in turn.\n\n       Beginning with protection of market participants and the public, the Commission noted\n\nthat, on the cost-side “using only one criterion—i.e., the characteristic of the commodity\n\nunderlying a swap—to determine liquidation time could result in less-than-optimal margin\n\ncalculations.” Final Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,418. In this vein, the Commission elaborated that\n\n“[f]or some products, a five-day minimum may prove to be excessive and tie up more funds than\n\nare strictly necessary for risk management purposes,” and “[f]or other products, a one-day or\n\neven a five-day period may be insufficient.” Id. Despite acknowledging these potential costs,\n\nthe Commission “believe[d] that it [was] not feasible to estimate or quantify these costs\n\nreliably.” Id. The reason for this imprecision, the Commission explained, is that “margin\n\nrequirements for a particular instrument depend on a variety of characteristics of the instrument\n\nand the markets in which it is traded, including the risk characteristics of the instrument, its\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\fhistorical price volatility, and liquidity in the relevant market.” Id. Indeed, the Commission\n\nstated that “[d]etermining the risk characteristics, price volatility, and market liquidity of even a\n\nsample [of financial swaps] for purposes of determining a liquidation time specifically for such\n\nan instrument would be a formidable task for the Commission to undertake and any results\n\nwould be subject to a range of uncertainty.” Id. 10 Due to “the absence of a reasonably feasible\n\nand reliable methodology . . . for the Commission to use in calculating the appropriate margin\n\nrequirements for swaps with either five-day or one-day liquidation times,” it was the\n\nCommission’s belief “that possible future circumstances surrounding margin levels are too\n\nspeculative and uncertain to be able to quantify or estimate the resulting costs to DCOs, clearing\n\nmembers, or the public from the rule with any precision or degree of magnitude.” Id. at 69,418–\n\n19.\n\n        As to the benefits of the Final Rule with regard to protection of market participants and\n\nthe public, the Commission stated that the five-day and one-day minimum liquidation times were\n\n“consistent with existing requirements” and “reflect the risk assessments DCOs have made.” Id.\n\nat 69,419. In the Commission’s opinion, the DCOs’ determination that “these are the appropriate\n\nstandards for these instruments” was “a reasonable and prudent judgment.” Id. At the same\n\ntime, however, the Commission stated that “[a] minimum standard is designed to prevent DCOs\n\nfrom competing by offering lower margin requirements than other DCOs and, as a result, taking\n\non more risk than is prudent.” Id. Related to this concern about a “race to the bottom,” see id. at\n\n69,367, the Commission was also “concerned that a DCO may misjudge the appropriate\n\nliquidation time frame because of limited experience with clearing and managing the risks of\n\n\n\n\n10\n Relatedly, the Commission observed that “[r]eliable data is not readily available for many swaps that prior to the\nDodd-Frank Act were executed on unregulated markets.” Final Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,418.\n\n                                                        19\n\ffinancial swaps” in particular. Id. at 69,419. In sum, prescribing minimum liquidation times was\n\nintended to “prevent DCOs from taking on too much risk.” Id.\n\n        In considering efficiency, competitiveness, and financial integrity, the Commission first\n\nnoted that the costs-side considerations were “similar” to the cost considerations related to\n\nprotection of market participants and the public. Id. On the benefits side, the Commission stated\n\nthat a minimum-liquidation-time rule would “promote efficiency, competitiveness and financial\n\nintegrity” for several reasons. Id. Principally, the Commission repeated its belief that, by setting\n\na floor for liquidation times, “a DCO will still have considerable latitude in setting risk-based\n\nmargin levels,” while at the same time there would be “legal certainty for an evolving\n\nmarketplace.” Id. The Commission also found that minimum liquidation times would “offer a\n\npractical means for assuring that the thousands of different swaps that are going to be cleared\n\nsubject to the Commission’s oversight will have prudent minimum margin requirements.” Id. In\n\nthis regard, the Commission repeated that minimum liquidation times would “help prevent a\n\npotential ‘race to the bottom’ by competing DCOs” and would channel competition among\n\nDCOs “to other areas such as level of service.” Id. Finally, the Commission acknowledged the\n\n“significant, adverse effect” that would accompany the default of either a DCO clearing member\n\nor, “[i]n a worst case scenario,” a DCO itself, “which could have serious and widespread\n\nconsequences for the U.S. financial markets.” Id. Minimum liquidation times were, according\n\nto the Commission, intended to avoid such a calamitous market event, which the Commission\n\nviewed as a significant, albeit unquantifiable, benefit. Id. 11\n\n\n\n\n11\n   As to the other statutory cost-benefit considerations, the Commission stated that it “[did] not believe that this\n[minimum-liquidation-time] rule will have a material effect on price discovery,” and “[b]ecause the rule simply\nestablishes minimums, it will not hinder the exercise of sound risk management,” but rather would “foster sound risk\nmanagement practices.” Final Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,419.\n\n                                                        20\n\f                       c)        Dissenting Views\n\n       Two Commissioners—Jill Sommers and Scott O’Malia—appended statements to the\n\nFinal Rule that were critical of certain aspects of the Commission’s rulemaking. Commissioner\n\nSommers opined that “the rules are needlessly prescriptive, internally inconsistent, and depart\n\nfrom the Commission’s time-tested principles-based oversight regime.” Final Rule, 76 Fed. Reg.\n\nat 69,473. On that same token, Commissioner Sommers believed that the Commission had\n\nprovided “little to no explanation of the costs and benefits of doing so, or even a rationale other\n\nthan an overarching belief that prescriptive rules will increase legal certainty and prevent a race\n\nto the bottom by competing clearinghouses.” Id. With particular regard to the Commission’s\n\nminimum-liquidation-time rule, Commissioner Sommers declared that it “defie[d] common\n\nsense.” Id. at 69,474. Commissioner Sommers took issue with the fact that, in her view, “[t]he\n\nCommission gives no reason for its belief that there may be a race to the bottom if we do not\n\nestablish this less than ideal methodology,” and the Commission also did not “acknowledge the\n\nexistence of other safeguards in the rules that give us strong tools for policing a potential race to\n\nthe bottom.” Id. Disagreeing with the Commission’s interpretation of its statutory mandate,\n\nCommissioner Sommers did not believe “that Congress intended for the Commission to strip\n\nDCOs of the flexibility to determine the manner in which they comply with core principles”\n\nbecause “there is no reason to believe that [DCOs] will not continue to use their expert judgment\n\nin a responsible fashion.” Id.\n\n       Commissioner O’Malia also submitted extensive comments on the Final Rule, which\n\ntook issue with the Commission’s reasoning and approach.            Like Commissioner Sommers,\n\nCommissioner O’Malia felt that “this rulemaking abandons the principle-based regulatory\n\nregime which permitted DCOs to perform so admirably in the 2008 financial crisis.” Id. Writing\n\n\n\n                                                    21\n\fin general terms, Commissioner O’Malia also predicted that “[c]ertain provisions” might\n\n“discourage market participants from executing transactions subject to mandatory clearing, even\n\nif they need such transactions to prudently hedge risks, or from clearing on a voluntary basis”\n\nbecause such provisions “may impose substantial costs without corresponding benefits.” Id.\n\n         In addition to these general comments, Commissioner O’Malia leveled several criticisms\n\nagainst the minimum-liquidation-time rule specifically. First, he wrote that “the rulemaking\n\ncreates the impression that these requirements are arbitrary” because, although the Commission\n\n“characterizes these requirements as ‘prudent,’ it sets forth no justification for this\n\ncharacterization.”       Id. at 69,476–77.          Specifically, Commissioner O’Malia criticized the\n\nCommission for telling DCOs to consider five factors in establishing minimum liquidation times,\n\nwhen “[t]he final rulemaking presents no evidence that the Commission considered any of the\n\nfive factors in determining minimum liquidation times.” Id. at 69,477. 12 In Commissioner\n\nO’Malia’s view, this amounted to the Commission “holding DCOs to a higher standard than it\n\nholds itself.” Id.\n\n         Commissioner O’Malia went on to explain why he felt the Commission’s administrative\n\nopt-out provision would be insufficient. He wrote that “requiring market participants, during the\n\npendency of such a petition, to pay margin calculated using a five-day minimum liquidation time\n\nwould likely cause a substantial number of market participants to withdraw from the market,\n\nthereby chilling activity—perhaps irrevocably—in the contract.” Id. Commissioner O’Malia\n\nfurther worried that the costs to a DCM of preparing and filing such a petition, “when coupled\n\n\n\n\n12\n   These five factors included: (1) average daily trading volume; (2) average daily open interest in a product;\n(3) concentration of open interest; (4) availability of a predictable basis relationship with a highly liquid product;\nand (5) availability of multiple market participants in related markets to take on positions in the market in question.\nSee Final Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,368.\n\n                                                         22\n\fwith the possibility that the Commission may deny such a petition, would likely deter a DCM\n\nfrom seeking to compete with an incumbent futures contract.” Id. 13\n\n        Notably, Commissioner O’Malia devoted a portion of his comments to discussing why\n\nthe minimum liquidation times were likely “to disrupt already established futures markets,” i.e.,\n\nDCMs. See id. He cited a proposed rule implementing DCM core principles, which would\n\n“prohibit a DCM from listing any contract for trading unless an average of 85 percent or greater\n\nof the total volume of such contract is traded on the centralized market, as calculated over a\n\ntwelve (12) month period.” Id. (citing 75 Fed. Reg. 80,616). 14 Commissioner O’Malia said that\n\nthis 85% requirement, juxtaposed with the minimum-liquidation-time rule, would mean that if a\n\nde-listed futures contract were converted to a swap, it would be required to comply with the five-\n\nday minimum liquidation time even though “nothing substantive about the contract[] change[s]\n\nother than [its] characterization.”          Id. 15   Such an effect, he said, would “ha[ve] severe\n\nimplications for competition” because “market participants generally execute new futures\n\ncontracts outside the DCM centralized market until the contracts attract sufficient liquidity,”\n\nwhich “may take years.” Id.\n\n\n\n13\n  On this point, Commissioner O’Malia predicted that “the Commission may take a long time to consider any DCO\npetition,” citing the fact that “the Commission took approximately two years to approve a petition to reduce the\nminimum liquidation time for certain contracts on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange from two days to one day.” Final\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,477. Because of this, Commissioner O’Malia suspected that “this power to petition the\nCommission for relief may be of little value to offset the likely stifling of competition.” Id.\n14\n  Neither this 85% threshold nor any of the other minimum centralized market trading requirements proposed for\nDCMs were adopted in the Commission’s final rule regarding DCM core principles. Instead, in that final rule the\nCommission stated that “additional time is appropriate before finalizing the proposed rules for Core Principle 9.”\nSee 77 Fed. Reg. at 36,643. Specifically, the Commission “plan[ned] and expect[ed] to take up the proposed rules\nunder [DCM] Core Principle 9 when it considers the final SEF rulemaking.” Id. The final SEF rulemaking, which\nwas published on June 4, 2013, contains no discussion of DCM Core Principle 9 or the 85% trading threshold, and\nno final rule regarding minimum centralized market trading requirements appears to have been published in the\nFederal Register.\n15\n   Commissioner O’Malia cited “information that [he had] received from one DCM,” indicating that the 85%\nthreshold rule “would force conversion of 628 futures and options contracts to swap contracts.” Final Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 69, 477.\n\n                                                        23\n\f        Next, Commissioner O’Malia questioned the Commission’s fears regarding a “race to the\n\nbottom” among DCOs. First, “[a]s a conceptual matter,” Commissioner O’Malia concluded that,\n\nsince the Commission “has not demonstrated that the minimum liquidation times that it has\n\ndecided to mandate are ‘prudent,’ it cannot demonstrate that the one-day or five-day period\n\nwould prevent a ‘race to the bottom.’” Id. at 69,478. Second, “[a]s an empirical matter,”\n\nCommissioner O’Malia pointed out that “the Commission must have decided that DCOs\n\ncurrently competing to clear interest rate swaps and credit default swaps have not entered into a\n\n‘race to the bottom,’ because the final rulemaking codifies the existing five-day minimum\n\nliquidation time that such competing DCOs voluntarily adopted.” Id. Finally, Commissioner\n\nO’Malia, like Commissioner Sommers, pointed to “more effective tools” that the Commission\n\nhas to prevent any potential “race to the bottom.” Id. 16\n\n        Finally, Commissioner O’Malia critiqued the Commission’s cost-benefit analysis,\n\ndeclaring “[w]e [c]an [d]o [b]etter.” Id. He made clear that his “primary concern” regarding the\n\nCommission’s cost-benefit analysis was “its failure to attempt meaningful quantification.” Id. at\n\n69,479. While acknowledging that meaningful quantification may sometimes be difficult or\n\nimpossible, Commissioner O’Malia stated that “[i]f the Commission truly cannot quantify the\n\ncosts in those instances, then that fact alone should cause the Commission to proceed with\n\ncaution if it is going to abandon the existing principles-based regime.” Id. One example\n\nCommissioner O’Malia found “puzzling, given the capabilities of the Risk Surveillance Group\n\n(‘RSG’) and the DCO Review Group (‘DRG’)” was the Commission’s professed inability to\n\n\n\n16\n   According to Commissioner O’Malia, these tools include (1) the requirement that DCOs determine the adequacy\nof their initial margin requirements on a daily basis; (2) the requirement that DCOs conduct back testing of their\ninitial margin requirements on a daily or monthly basis; (3) the requirement that DCOs stress test their default\nresources at least once a month and report the results of such stress testing to the Commission; and (4) the\nCommission’s ability to independently back test and stress test DCO initial margin requirements. See Final Rule, 76\nFed. Reg. at 69,478.\n\n                                                        24\n\fquantify the costs of the minimum-liquidation-time rule due to a lack of reliable data. Id.\n\nCommissioner O’Malia recognized that “certain swaps” may not have sufficient data to create\n\nreliable quantitative cost estimates, but he stressed that such estimates would be possible for\n\n“futures contracts currently listed on a DCM that will be converted to swap contracts under the\n\npending DCM proposal.” Id. In the end, Commissioner O’Malia believed that “any attempt,\n\neven an imperfect one, undertaken by the Commission to understand the cost of our rulemakings\n\nor to justify our policy decisions is better than no attempt at all.” Id.\n\n               4.      The Mandatory Clearing Rule and the Plaintiff’s Efforts to Obtain\n                       Administrative Relief\n\n       The Commission’s Final Rule regarding minimum liquidation times went into effect on\n\nJanuary 9, 2012. See Final Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,334. On August 7, 2012, the Commission\n\npublished a NPRM for another rule, which would also affect the trading of swaps. That NPRM\n\nproposed, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 2(h), that certain categories of swaps would be required to be\n\ncleared by a DCO. See Clearing Requirement Determination Under Section 2(h) of the CEA, 77\n\nFed. Reg. 47,170 (proposed Aug. 7, 2012). The mandatory clearing NPRM proposed requiring\n\nclearing for four specified classes of interest-rate swaps and two specified classes of credit-\n\ndefault swaps. See id. at 47,220–21. Related to this mandatory clearing rule, the Commission\n\nhad promulgated a final rule on July 30, 2012, which laid out a compliance schedule for any\n\nmandatory clearing rules passed pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 2(h). See Swap Transaction Compliance\n\nand Implementation Schedule: Clearing Requirement Under Section 2(h) of the CEA, 77 Fed.\n\nReg. 44,441 (July 30, 2012) (codified at 17 C.F.R. pt. 50). That schedule was “based on the type\n\nof market participants entering into a swap subject to the Clearing Requirement,” and in\n\nparticular it divided market participants into three categories, which correlated to how soon they\n\nwould need to comply with any clearing rules: Category 1 Entities, Category 2 Entities, and all\n\n\n                                                  25\n\fother market participants. See id. at 44,442. Category 1 Entities would have to comply with\n\nclearing requirements within 90 days, Category 2 entities would have to comply with clearing\n\nrequirements within 180 days, and all other market participants would have to comply with\n\nclearing requirements within 270 days. See id.; see also17 C.F.R. § 50.25 (codifying compliance\n\nschedule).\n\n       On December 13, 2012, the Commission published a final rule regarding the categories\n\nof swaps that would be required to be cleared pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 2(h).        See Clearing\n\nRequirement Determination Under Section 2(h) of the CEA, 77 Fed. Reg. 74,284 (Dec. 13,\n\n2012) (codified at 17 C.F.R. pts. 39 and 50).        That final rule specified exactly the same\n\ncategories of swaps that the NPRM had specified, see id. at 74,336–37, and it stated, in\n\naccordance with the compliance schedule passed in July 2012, that “the compliance schedule for\n\nthis first clearing requirement will commence on March 11, 2013” for Category 1 Entities, id. at\n\n74,289. Similarly in line with the July 2012 compliance schedule, the December 13, 2012\n\nmandatory clearing rule stated that “Category 2 Entities must comply with the clearing\n\nrequirement by June 10, 2013.” Id. at 74,289 n.52.\n\n       A month and a half after this clearing requirement was published—and over fourteen\n\nmonths after the minimum-liquidation-time rule was published—the plaintiff sent a letter to the\n\nCommission, which raised “a serious concern . . . with the [Final Rule], and more specifically,\n\nwith regulation 39.13(g)(ii) [sic] which sets out the minimum liquidation time for financial\n\nfutures and financial swaps.” See Def.’s Mot. for Extension of Time Ex. 1 (“January Bloomberg\n\nLetter”) at 1, ECF No. 16-1. The plaintiff was interested in the Final Rule because it “operates\n\nthe BLOOMBERG PROFESSIONAL® service, a leading privately held electronic service that,\n\namong other things, facilitates the trading and processing of swaps [OTC].” Compl. ¶ 10, ECF\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\fNo. 1. 17 Bloomberg generates revenue from its swap trading platform by charging a monthly fee\n\nto those who subscribe to its BLOOMBERG PROFESSIONAL® service (also known as\n\n“Bloomberg terminals”), and thus Bloomberg does not generate revenue on a per-trade basis.\n\nSee Decl. of Benjamin P. Macdonald (“Macdonald Decl.”) ¶ 6, ECF No. 13-3. In addition,\n\nBloomberg “intends to operate a SEF in order to facilitate trading in the swaps market” and, to\n\nthat end, “has already created a subsidiary that will operate the SEF, has drafted a rulebook for\n\nthat SEF . . ., and has taken substantial steps toward creating the technological infrastructure for\n\noperating the SEF.” Compl. ¶ 11.\n\n        In its January 30, 2013 letter to the Commission, Bloomberg raised a number of\n\nobjections to the minimum-liquidation-time rule, most of which focused on the so-called\n\n“futurization of swaps.” See January Bloomberg Letter at 1. Futurization, according to the\n\nplaintiff, refers to “a phenomenon by which futures products are designed to mimic the essential\n\ncharacteristics of a swap.” Pl.’s Mem. at 1. More specifically, a swap can be “futurized” by\n\n“preassembling strips of futures contracts with aggregate cash flows that resemble swaps with\n\nthe same size, tenor, and reset characteristics.” Id. at 5 (citing Brown-Hruska Decl. ¶ 16). The\n\nresulting financial product is often referred to as a “swap future.” See id. Bloomberg contended\n\nin its January 30, 2013 letter that the Commission’s minimum-liquidation-time rule “on its face\n\nwill be the strongest driver of the forced ‘futurization’ of economically equivalent financial\n\nswaps.” January Bloomberg Letter at 2.\n\n        A major premise of this concern was that so-called “swap futures” have “the same risk\n\ncharacteristics as a swap,” id. at 1, and thus, by the plaintiff’s logic “[e]ither the swap executed\n\non a SEF or futures exchange is being ‘over-margined’ by a factor of five, or the futures contract\n\n17\n   Bloomberg’s “core business,” however, is “the delivery of analytics and data on approximately five million\nfinancial instruments, as well as news on every publicly traded company through the BLOOMBERG\nPROFESSIONAL ® service, television, radio, websites, mobile applications, and magazines.” Compl. ¶ 10.\n\n                                                     27\n\fexecuted on a futures exchange is being ‘under-margined’ by a factor of five,” id. at 3. The\n\nplaintiff was concerned that this scenario “could lead to clearinghouses absorbing more risk than\n\nthey otherwise would have if they were permitted to margin cleared financial products that are\n\neconomically equivalent using an appropriate risk-based metric regardless of the formal label\n\ngiven to the product.”    Id.   Bloomberg closed its letter by writing that “[f]ortunately, the\n\nCommission recognized that these markets are novel and complex, and consequently, reserved\n\nthe right, by order, to ‘establish shorter or longer liquidation times for particular products or\n\nportfolios.’” Id. Since Bloomberg believed “futurization” generally was “exactly the type of\n\nsituation the Commission had in mind when it approved this language,” Bloomberg “formally\n\nrequest[ed] that the Commission adopt an order that requires DCOs to impose the same margin\n\nrequirements for financial swaps as they impose on financial futures that are economically\n\nequivalent and have a comparable risk profile.” Id.\n\n       On March 11, 2013, Bloomberg sent a second letter to the Commission—this time\n\nthrough counsel—which laid out its objections to the minimum-liquidation-time rule in more\n\ndetail and stated for the first time that the Final Rule “threatens significant adverse effects for\n\nBloomberg” that would be “irreversible.” See Def.’s Mot. for Extension of Time Ex. 2 (“March\n\n11 Bloomberg Letter”) at 1, 11, ECF No. 16-2. In its March 11, 2013 letter Bloomberg also\n\nsought more far-reaching relief from the Commission, requesting “that the Commission promptly\n\ntake all steps necessary to stay the five-day minimum liquidation period for financial swaps, so\n\nthat the same one-day minimum period applies to all cleared swaps and futures.” Id. at 11. Two\n\ndays later, on March 13, 2013, Ananda Radhakrishnan, the Commission’s Director of the\n\nDivision of Clearing and Risk, responded by letter to Bloomberg. See Def.’s Mot. for Extension\n\nof Time Ex. 3 (“March CFTC Letter”), ECF No. 16-3. In that letter, Mr. Radhakrishnan stated\n\n\n\n                                                28\n\fthat Bloomberg’s January and March 2013 letters “have been referred to the Division of Clearing\n\nand Risk for consideration.” Id. at 1. After explaining the Commission’s rationale for adopting\n\nthe minimum-liquidation-time rule, Mr. Radhakrishnan concluded that Bloomberg’s requests\n\n“will be given prompt and careful consideration,” though “[t]o assist the Commission staff in\n\nconsidering them,” Mr. Radhakrishnan requested that Bloomberg “provide any data, studies, or\n\nother supporting information” by March 29, 2013. Id. at 3.\n\n       In response to the Commission’s request, Bloomberg sent a third letter, through counsel,\n\nto the Commission on March 29, 2013, which attached “two sets of data for each trading day in\n\nFebruary 2013.” See Def.’s Mot. for Extension of Time Ex. 4 (“March 29 Bloomberg Letter”) at\n\n1, ECF No. 16-4. Those data sets were “transaction-by-transaction” lists of (1) index credit-\n\ndefault swap transactions; and (2) interest-rate swap transactions, in which “at least one party to\n\nthe swap [was] a registered swap dealer or major swap participant.” Id. This data, Bloomberg\n\ncontended, “illustrate[] that there is deep and consistent liquidity in markets for some index\n\ncredit default swaps and interest-rate swaps.” Id. From this conclusion, Bloomberg argued that\n\n“such swaps could easily be liquidated in less than five days, indeed, often in less than a single\n\nday.” Id. at 1–2. Bloomberg also focused on three specific financial swaps, which it believed\n\ndemonstrated enough liquidity to warrant a minimum liquidation time of less than five days. Id.\n\nat 2. Bloomberg concluded by stating that, since it had not received a response to its March 11,\n\n2013 letter by March 19, 2013, as requested, it had “proceeded with preparing a federal court\n\ncomplaint, which [it] expect[ed] to file shortly.” Id.\n\n       Bloomberg filed its Complaint in the instant action eighteen days later on April 16, 2013,\n\nwhich the Court will discuss in more detail below. After filing its Complaint, the plaintiff\n\npursued the final step in its quest for administrative relief, which was to file with the\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\fCommission, on April 24, 2013, a formal motion to stay the portion of the Final Rule\n\nestablishing minimum liquidation times.           See Def.’s Mot. for Extension of Time Ex. 5\n\n(“Bloomberg Mot. to Stay”), ECF No. 16-5; see also id. at 2 (“Bloomberg hereby renews and\n\nformalizes its prior request that the Commission stay Rule 39.13(g)(2)(ii), pending the resolution\n\nof Bloomberg’s newly-filed challenge against that Rule . . . .”). In its formal motion to stay,\n\nBloomberg requested a response “by no later than 5:00 PM, April 29, 2013, so that it promptly\n\nmay seek such judicial relief as is necessary.” Id. (emphasis omitted). 18\n\n        The day after Bloomberg filed its formal motion to stay the minimum-liquidation-time\n\nrule, on April 25, 2013, the Commission sent a letter responding to the data submitted by\n\nBloomberg in its March 29 letter. See Def.’s Mot. for Extension of Time Ex. 6 (“April CFTC\n\nLetter”), ECF No. 16-6. In that letter, Mr. Radhakrishnan stated that the Division of Clearing\n\nand Risk had “identified a number of questions which require further data and analysis” before\n\nthe Commission could come to a conclusion regarding Bloomberg’s request to stay the five-day\n\nminimum liquidation rule. See id. at 1. In particular, Mr. Radhakrishnan asked for clarification\n\nabout whether Bloomberg was still seeking a waiver of the five-day minimum for “all cleared\n\nswaps and futures,” as stated in the March 11, 2013 letter, or whether that request was now\n\nlimited to the three specific types of swaps discussed in Bloomberg’s March 29, 2013 letter. See\n\nid. Also, after asking several questions about liquidity, default management, and complexity and\n\nconcentration of positions, Mr. Radhakrishnan noted that “no DCO has requested that the\n\nCommission issue an order reducing [the five-day] requirement for any product.” Id. at 3. As a\n\nresult, Mr. Radhakrishnan asked that Bloomberg “[p]lease identify any DCO that you believe\n\nwould accept your client’s products for clearing on the basis of margin calculated using less than\n\n\n18\n On May 17, 2013, the Commission issued an order denying Bloomberg’s motion to stay. See Notice of Agency\nAction, ECF No. 22.\n\n                                                    30\n\fa five-day liquidation period and state the basis for your belief.” Id. The Court is not aware of\n\nany response by Bloomberg to this query.\n\n               5.      The Plaintiff’s Lawsuit\n\n       As referenced above, the plaintiff filed its Complaint in this action on April 16, 2013.\n\nThe plaintiff’s Complaint contains four counts, one under the CEA and the APA, two under only\n\nthe APA, and one separate count for injunctive relief. See Compl.¶¶ 66–89. In its first count, the\n\nplaintiff alleges that, in promulgating the Final Rule, the Commission only provided “superficial\n\ndiscussion of the Rule’s costs and benefits,” in violation of 7 U.S.C. § 19(a)(2). See id. ¶¶ 67–\n\n68. In its second and third counts, the plaintiff alleges that the Commission violated the APA by\n\nfailing to give “fair notice of various aspects of Rule 39.13(g)(2)(ii),” id. ¶ 74, and by\n\npromulgating a minimum-liquidation-time rule that “was arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not\n\nin accordance with law,” id. ¶ 83. Finally, the plaintiff alleged in its fourth count that it would\n\n“be irreparably injured by the further implementation of Rule 39.13(g)(2)(ii),” and therefore it\n\nalleged that it was “entitled to injunctive relief under 5 U.S.C. § 702.” Id. ¶¶ 85, 89.\n\n       On May 2, 2013, the plaintiff filed an application for a preliminary injunction that would\n\n“stay[] 17 C.F.R. § 39.13(g)(2)(ii) . . . to the extent that the Rule provides minimum liquidation\n\ntimes that are longer for financial swaps than for futures contracts.” See Pl.’s Appl. for Prelim.\n\nInj. at 1, ECF No. 13. The plaintiff further requested “expedited briefing and consideration” of\n\nits application because it would “incur significant, irreversible injury if a preliminary injunction\n\nis not entered before the commencement of the CFTC’s ‘Phase 2’ clearing mandate on June 10,\n\n2013.” Id. (emphasis omitted). That application became ripe on May 21, 2013, and the Court\n\nheld oral argument regarding the application on May 31, 2013. Currently pending before the\n\nCourt is the plaintiff’s Application for a Preliminary Injunction, and for the reasons discussed\n\nbelow the Court concludes that (1) the plaintiff lacks standing to assert its claims; and, relatedly\n                                                 31\n\f(2) the plaintiff has not demonstrated that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm absent\n\npreliminary injunctive relief.\n\nII.    LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       A.      Subject-Matter Jurisdiction\n\n       A federal court has “an affirmative obligation to consider whether the constitutional and\n\nstatutory authority exist” for it to hear a case. James Madison Ltd. v. Ludwig, 82 F.3d 1085,\n\n1092 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). When a purported lack of jurisdiction\n\nstems from a lack of standing, however, the court “must assume that [the plaintiff] states a valid\n\nlegal claim.” Info. Handling Servs., Inc. v. Def. Automated Printing Servs., 338 F.3d 1024, 1029\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2003). The proponent of jurisdiction bears the burden of proving that jurisdiction\n\nexists. Khadr v. United States, 529 F.3d 1112, 1115 (D.C. Cir. 2008). While “the district court\n\nmay consider materials outside the pleadings,” it must “still accept all of the factual allegations\n\nin the complaint as true.” Jerome Stevens Pharm., Inc. v. FDA, 402 F.3d 1249, 1253 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2005) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). “If the court determines at any time that\n\nit lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.” FED. R. CIV. P. 12(h)(3).\n\n       B.      Preliminary Injunctive Relief\n\n       “The purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of\n\nthe parties until a trial on the merits can be held.” Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395\n\n(1981). It is “an extraordinary and drastic remedy” and “should not be granted unless the\n\nmovant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.” Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S.\n\n968, 972 (1997) (emphasis and internal quotation mark omitted). Plaintiffs seeking a\n\npreliminary injunction must establish that (1) they are likely to succeed on the merits of their\n\nclaims; (2) they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the\n\n\n\n                                                 32\n\fbalance of equities tips in their favor; and (4) an injunction is in the public interest. Winter v.\n\nNatural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); accord Gordon v. Holder, 632 F.3d 722,\n\n724 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\n       Historically, these four factors have been evaluated on a “sliding scale” in this Circuit,\n\nsuch that “[i]f the movant makes an unusually strong showing on one of the factors, then it does\n\nnot necessarily have to make as strong a showing on another factor.” Davis v. Pension Benefit\n\nGuar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1291–92 (D.C. Cir. 2009). Recently, however, the continued\n\nviability of that approach has been called into some doubt, as the Supreme Court and the D.C.\n\nCircuit have strongly suggested, without holding, that a likelihood of success on the merits is an\n\nindependent, free-standing requirement for a preliminary injunction. See Munaf v. Geren, 553\n\nU.S. 674, 690 (2008) (“[A] party seeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate, among\n\nother things, a likelihood of success on the merits.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Sherley\n\nv. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 393 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“[W]e read Winter at least to suggest if not to\n\nhold that a likelihood of success is an independent, free-standing requirement for a preliminary\n\ninjunction.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Davis, 571 F.3d at 1296 (Kavanaugh,\n\nJ., concurring) (“Munaf made clear that a likelihood of success is an independent, free-standing\n\nrequirement for a preliminary injunction.”).\n\nIII.   DISCUSSION\n\n       The Court will begin by discussing the plaintiff’s standing to sue, since that is “a\n\nthreshold, jurisdictional concept.” See Deutsche Bank Nat’l Trust Co. v. FDIC, No. 12-5170,\n\n2013 WL 2157865, at *4 n.4 (D.C. Cir. May 21, 2013). Additionally, because standing in this\n\ncase is intimately intertwined with the question of irreparable harm in the context of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  33\n\fapplication for a preliminary injunction, the Court will also briefly discuss the plaintiff’s ability\n\nto establish a likelihood of irreparable harm.\n\n       A.      Standing\n\n       Article III of the United States Constitution limits the federal judicial power to the\n\nresolution of “Cases” and “Controversies.” U.S. CONST. art. III, § 2. “In limiting the judicial\n\npower to ‘Cases’ and ‘Controversies,’ Article III of the Constitution restricts it to the traditional\n\nrole of Anglo-American courts, which is to redress or prevent actual or imminently threatened\n\ninjury to persons caused by private or official violation of law.” Summers v. Earth Island Inst.,\n\n555 U.S. 488, 492 (2009). In other words, “[t]he case-or controversy doctrines state fundamental\n\nlimits on federal judicial power in our system of government.” Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737,\n\n750 (1984). “The Art[icle] III doctrine that requires a litigant to have ‘standing’ to invoke the\n\npower of a federal court is perhaps the most important of these doctrines.” Id.\n\n       As the Supreme Court has explained, “the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing\n\ncontains three elements.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). First, the\n\nplaintiff must have suffered an “injury in fact,” i.e., “an invasion of a legally protected interest\n\nwhich is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or\n\nhypothetical.” Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Second, there must be “a\n\ncausal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of,” i.e., the injury alleged\n\nmust be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant. Id. Finally, it must be likely\n\nthat the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Id. at 561. Moreover, when a plaintiff\n\nseeks prospective declaratory or injunctive relief, allegations of past harms are insufficient. See,\n\ne.g., Dearth v. Holder, 641 F.3d 499, 501 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Rather, when declaratory or\n\ninjunctive relief is sought, a plaintiff “must show he is suffering an ongoing injury or faces an\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fimmediate threat of [future] injury.” Id. (citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105\n\n(1983)).\n\n        The Court finds that Bloomberg does not satisfy any of the three elements of Article III\n\nstanding in this action, and thus the Court will address each element in turn. Before delving into\n\nthe specific elements, however, there are two overarching principles that apply to the standing\n\ninquiry in this case. First, this case involves purported “standing to challenge a [regulation]\n\nwhere the direct cause of injury is the independent action of . . . third part[ies].”                       Renal\n\nPhysicians Ass’n v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 489 F.3d 1267, 1269 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2007). As will be discussed below, however, “courts [only] occasionally find the elements of\n\nstanding to be satisfied in cases challenging government action on the basis of third-party\n\nconduct.” Nat’l Wrestling Coaches Ass’n v. Dep’t of Educ., 366 F.3d 930, 940 (D.C. Cir. 2004).\n\n        Second, and relatedly, the regulation challenged by the plaintiff does not regulate the\n\nplaintiff directly; rather, it regulates DCOs. As the Supreme Court has made clear, “[w]hen . . . a\n\nplaintiff’s asserted injury arises from the government’s allegedly unlawful regulation (or lack of\n\nregulation) of someone else, much more is needed.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562 (emphasis in\n\noriginal). In that circumstance, “it becomes the burden of the plaintiff to adduce facts showing\n\nthat . . . choices [of the independent actors] have been or will be made in such a manner as to\n\nproduce causation and permit redressability of injury.” Id.; see also id. (“[W]hen the plaintiff is\n\nnot himself the object of the government action or inaction he challenges, standing is not\n\nprecluded, but it is ordinarily ‘substantially more difficult’ to establish.” (quoting Allen, 468 U.S.\n\nat 758)); see also Renal Physicians, 489 F.3d at 1273 (noting “the heightened showing required\n\nof a plaintiff alleging injury from the government’s regulation of a third party”). 19\n\n\n19\n  In its reply brief, Bloomberg confidently asserts that it “is an object of the government action because the Rule\nregulates market activity that occurs on Bloomberg’s systems: that is, swap trading platforms on which swaps are\n\n                                                        35\n\f         There are “two categories of cases where standing exists to challenge government action\n\nthough the direct cause of injury is the action of a third party.” Renal Physicians, 489 F.3d at\n\n1275. “First, a federal court may find that a party has standing to challenge government action\n\nthat permits or authorizes third-party conduct that would otherwise be illegal in the absence of\n\nthe Government’s action.” National Wrestling Coaches, 366 F.3d at 940. Second, standing has\n\nbeen found “where the record present[s] substantial evidence of a causal relationship between the\n\ngovernment policy and the third-party conduct, leaving little doubt as to causation and likelihood\n\nof redress.” Id. at 941.\n\n                  1.       Injury in Fact\n\n         With the context of the plaintiff’s standing framed thusly, the Court will begin by\n\ndiscussing whether the plaintiff has established an injury-in-fact. As discussed above, to satisfy\n\nthe requirements of Article III, a plaintiff’s injury must be both “concrete and particularized” and\n\n“actual or imminent,” and may not be “conjectural or hypothetical.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). “While the burden of production to establish standing is\n\nmore relaxed at the pleading stage than at summary judgment, a plaintiff must nonetheless allege\n\n‘general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s conduct’ (notwithstanding\n\n‘the court presumes that general allegations embrace the specific facts that are necessary to\n\nsupport the claim’).” Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. EPA, 667 F.3d 6, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2011)\n\n\n\ntraded.” See Reply Mem. in Supp. Pl.’s Appl. for Prelim. Inj. (“Pl.’s Reply”) at 20 n.9, ECF No. 23 (emphasis in\noriginal). This argument simply does not wash. The imposition of minimum liquidation times regulates the process\nof clearing a derivative, not the process of trading (or “executing”) a derivative—two separate market activities that,\nthough related, are performed by separate regulated entities (DCMs/SEFs and DCOs, respectively). In fact, the\nplaintiff touts the fact that “[s]wap counterparties that execute their trades on SEFs will be able to choose the DCO\nat which they clear.” Pl.’s Mem. at 8 (emphasis added); accord Brown-Hruska Decl. ¶ 18 (noting that “swaps\ntrading platforms, including SEFs, will likely connect to multiple DCOs, which will clear swaps at the DCO that has\nbeen requested by the swap counterparties,” while “[s]wap futures, on the other hand, can only be executed on a\nDCM and cleared through its affiliated DCO”). Thus, Bloomberg is no more the object of the Commission’s\nminimum-liquidation-time rule than an automobile dealer is the object of a law imposing minimum car insurance\nrequirements on automobile owners.\n\n                                                         36\n\f(quoting Sierra Club v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 898–99 (D.C. Cir. 2002)); see also Lujan, 504 U.S.\n\nat 561 (“[E]ach element [of standing] must be supported . . . with the manner and degree of\n\nevidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”).          The plaintiff’s burden of\n\nestablishing injury in this case is, as discussed above, “heightened” because Bloomberg is\n\n“alleging injury from the government’s regulation of a third party.” Renal Physicians, 489 F.3d\n\nat 1273.\n\n       Bloomberg contends that “[i]t will lose millions of dollars in business as a direct result of\n\nthe Rule’s discriminatory treatment of financial swaps and financial futures,” and this “[l]oss of\n\npotential revenue satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement.” Reply Mem. in Supp. Pl.’s Appl. for\n\nPrelim. Inj. (“Pl.’s Reply”) at 20, ECF No. 23 (citing Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Norton, 322 F.3d\n\n728, 733 (D.C. Cir. 2003)). The plaintiff is certainly correct that a loss of revenue, particularly\n\none amounting to “millions of dollars” could satisfy Article III’s requirement of injury-in-fact.\n\nDespite Bloomberg’s matter-of-fact statement that “[i]t will lose” money, see id. (emphasis\n\nadded), the plaintiff has failed to establish that such a loss is “actual or imminent,” as opposed to\n\n“conjectural or hypothetical.” See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (internal quotation marks omitted). To\n\nbetter understand why the plaintiff’s purported future injury is “hopelessly conjectural,”\n\nDeutsche Bank, 2013 WL 2157865, at *4, a closer examination of the plaintiff’s theory of\n\nstanding is necessary.\n\n       First, to be clear, the plaintiff does not allege that it has yet suffered any injury as a result\n\nof the Final Rule. Rather, the plaintiff fears that, because swaps cannot be cleared with lower\n\nthan a five-day liquidation time, but swap futures can be cleared with as low as a one-day\n\nliquidation time, once “Phase 2” clearing begins on June 10, 2013, DCOs will set lower\n\nliquidation times for swap futures, traded on competitor DCMs, than for the swaps traded on\n\n\n\n                                                  37\n\fBloomberg’s trading platform. See Pl.’s Mem. at 18; Pl.’s Reply at 20–21; Compl. ¶ 61 (alleging\n\nthat the Rule “will result in more favorable margin treatment for the ‘swap futures’ contract than\n\nfor the functionally comparable financial swap that has not been ‘futurized’ and remains subject\n\nto a five-day liquidation time”). The plaintiff does not allege, however, that any DCO has set\n\nliquidation times for any swap futures contract lower than the liquidation times set for any\n\nfinancial swap, despite the fact that “Phase 1” mandatory swap clearing has been underway for\n\nnearly three months. See supra Part I.B.4 (explaining phasing-in of mandatory swap clearing\n\nrequirements). The plaintiff attempts to tie its injury to “Phase 2” swap clearing—set to begin on\n\nJune 10, 2013—because, when that phase of mandatory clearing begins “a large number of\n\nmarket participants who generally have not been clearing their swaps” and thus “are\n\nparticular[ly] sensitive to margin obligations” will be required to “clear[] many commonly-\n\ntraded interest rate swaps and credit default swaps.” Pl.’s Mem. at 18.\n\n       To summarize, the plaintiff’s chain of injury goes as follows: (1) at least some DCOs will\n\nset lower liquidation times for financial swap futures than for financial swaps; (2) this lower\n\nliquidation time will result in lower margin requirements for financial swap futures than for\n\nfinancial swaps; (3) margin-sensitive “Category 2” entities will trade financial swap futures on\n\nDCMs rather than trading financial swaps on Bloomberg’s trading platform; and, thus (4) at least\n\nsome Category 2 Entities will stop subscribing to Bloomberg’s trading platform, causing\n\nBloomberg to lose revenue. The actualization of this chain of events, however, depends on\n\nseveral assumptions about the behavior of third parties who are not before the Court. Most\n\nfundamentally, Bloomberg’s injury rises or falls with the behavior of third-party DCOs, who are\n\nthe entities actually regulated by the minimum-liquidation-time rule and are the ones who\n\nactually decide what liquidation times to set and how much margin to collect. Yet, inexplicably,\n\n\n\n                                               38\n\fBloomberg has not put forth a single factual allegation that any DCO has set or intends to set\n\nliquidation times for financial swap futures at a level lower than that set for financial swaps.\n\nInstead, Bloomberg (and its expert declarant) simply assume the worst-case scenario—DCOs\n\nwill set liquidation times for financial swap futures at the minimum of one day, and will set\n\nliquidation times for financial swaps at the minimum of five days—without grounding their\n\nassumption in the actual behavior of DCOs. See, e.g., Pl.’s Mem. at 18 (stating that “the 5-day\n\nliquidation period for a swap under the Rule would generate approximately 2.23 times the\n\nmargin held against futures subject to a 1-day period” (internal quotation marks omitted));\n\nBrown-Hruska Decl. ¶ 6 (“Because of the different minimum liquidation times created by the\n\nRule for margin calculation, the cost to market participants of holding futures positions will be\n\nlower than the cost of holding economically equivalent cleared swap positions.”); id. ¶ 38 (“[A]\n\nshorter margin liquidation period for interest rate swap futures would enable a 50% reduction in\n\nmargin compared to margin for cleared interest rate swaps.”).\n\n       Indeed, this Court is essentially picking up where the Commission left off in its April 25,\n\n2013 letter to Bloomberg, in which it asked the plaintiff to “[p]lease identify any DCO that you\n\nbelieve would accept your client’s products for clearing on the basis of margin calculated using\n\nless than a five-day liquidation period.” See April CFTC Letter at 3. The Court asked the\n\nplaintiff’s counsel essentially this exact same question at oral argument, to which he responded:\n\n“[T]here is no more powerful evidence that you can have than the [Commission]’s own\n\ninsistence that it would happen.” See Tr. of Prelim. Inj. Hr’g at 10:9–11 (May 31, 2013).\n\nBloomberg took this same position in its reply brief, contending that “[t]he entire premise of the\n\nRule’s 5-day mandatory minimum liquidation time for financial swaps is that, absent that\n\nrequirement, DCOs would ‘race’ to set liquidation times less than 5 days.” Pl.’s Reply at 21\n\n\n\n                                               39\n\f(emphasis omitted).        When pressed at oral argument on this point, however, Bloomberg’s\n\ncounsel conceded that “[w]e don’t have evidence on that point specifically,” i.e., whether DCOs\n\nare setting or intend to set liquidation times below five days for financial swap futures. See Tr.\n\nof Prelim. Inj. Hr’g at 11:24–25. Plaintiff’s counsel further conceded that, “if [liquidation times\n\nfor financial swap futures] would remain up at five [days], that certainly does go to the question\n\nwhether we have injury.” Id. at 12:5–7. 20 Despite these concessions, plaintiff’s counsel once\n\nagain pivoted back to the Commission’s rulemaking to argue that “it would be a little remarkable\n\nif the two parties were before the Court here expending the time and effort they have—are both\n\ndoing so with the belief that, in fact, there are no DCOs out there that will be below five [days\n\nfor financial swap futures].” Id. at 12:7–12.\n\n         To advance this argument, the plaintiff pointed, both in its brief and at oral argument, to\n\nthe D.C. Circuit’s decision in Stilwell v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 569 F.3d 514 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2009). See Pl.’s Reply at 21–22; Tr. of Prelim. Inj. Hr’g at 20:23–21:1, 76:17–21. That case\n\ninvolved a challenge to a regulation promulgated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (“OTS”),\n\nwhich permitted entities called “mutual holding companies” or “MHCs” to adopt a charter\n\nprovision for their subsidiaries that would “prohibit any person or entity from acquiring, or\n\noffering to acquire, more than 10% of the MHC subsidiary’s total minority stock within five\n\nyears after the minority stock issuance.” Stilwell, 569 F.3d at 516–17 (emphasis omitted). The\n20\n   It is telling that plaintiff’s counsel used the phrase “remain up at five [days].” Tr. of Prelim. Inj. Hr’g at 12:6\n(emphasis added). This made explicit what had previously been implicit: There are currently no DCOs that set\nliquidation times for financial swap futures below five days. Plaintiff’s counsel later asserted that “I believe it’s\nundisputed that there are lower margin requirements for swap futures currently.” Id. at 12:24–13:1. Plaintiff’s\ncounsel immediately clarified, however, that this assertion is based not on the margin requirements set by DCOs, but\nby marketing materials disseminated by DCMs, in which DCMs advertise lower margin requirements for financial\nswap futures than for financial swaps. See id. at 13:1–4 (referring to “advertising” from certain DCMs “saying, we\noffer lower margin, fifty percent lower”). These same marketing materials were cited in the plaintiff’s briefing. See\nPl.’s Mem. at 18–19. These materials are, however, merely wishful thinking and puffery on the part of DCMs\nhoping to lure customers away from competitor swap trading platforms, and they do not establish any injury-in-fact\non the part of Bloomberg because Bloomberg has not alleged that these marketing materials have resulted in (or will\nimminently result in): (1) margin requirements for financial swap futures that are actually lower than five days, let\nalone (2) customers leaving Bloomberg’s trading platform to trade on DCMs.\n\n                                                         40\n\fpurpose of this rule was to prevent activist minority shareholders in MHC subsidiaries from\n\nusing their leverage to “tak[e] advantage of voting rules that require a majority of the minority\n\nshareholders to approve management stock benefit plans.” See id. at 516.\n\n       The Court of Appeals concluded that an injury to the plaintiff—a prolific minority\n\nshareholder in MHC subsidiaries—was “substantially probable” because “[t]here [was] plainly a\n\nhigh—indeed, a near-certain—probability that at least some MHC subsidiaries selling minority\n\nstock to the public will adopt the optional provision limiting the size of any individual’s minority\n\nstake.” Id. at 518. The court’s conclusion in this regard was supported by two premises. First,\n\n“OTS proposed and ultimately adopted this new approach for this precise reason: to help solve\n\nthe perceived problems posed by activists like [the plaintiff] investing in MHC subsidiaries.” Id.\n\nSecond, and most importantly for purposes of the instant case, “[c]omments on the rule—\n\nincluding from representatives of the prominent bankers’ trade associations—supported the rule\n\non the same grounds.” Id. (citing three comment letters from bankers’ trade associations). The\n\ncourt even cited to an amicus curiae brief by the American Bankers Association, which noted\n\nthat “‘the outcome of this case will have a very real impact upon the ability of mutual\n\nassociations to defend themselves.’” Id.\n\n       Stilwell is both factually and legally distinguishable from the instant case with respect to\n\nstanding. Factually, the Stilwell court had before it numerous statements from the relevant third-\n\nparty market participants (mutual associations) stating essentially that they were likely to adopt\n\nthe optional charter provision “to defend themselves.” Id. (internal quotation mark omitted).\n\nLegally, the OTS had promulgated the optional charter provision “to help solve the perceived\n\nproblems posed by activists . . . investing in MHC subsidiaries.” Id. In fact, the Court of\n\nAppeals quoted with approval from the plaintiff’s brief to say that “‘it is more than a little ironic\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\fthat OTS would suggest Petitioners lack standing and then, later in the same brief, label\n\nPetitioner Stilwell as a prime example of one of the activist MHC shareholders who supposedly\n\nhave created the very problem the Rule was intended to address.’” Id.\n\n       The same cannot be said about the instant case. First, in this case, the “problem” being\n\naddressed by the five-day and one-day minimum liquidation times—a ruinous “race to the\n\nbottom” among DCOs—is, by all accounts, not currently taking place. A cursory glance at the\n\nrulemakings in the two cases demonstrates why this fact is important. In Stilwell, the OTS had\n\nstated in its NPRM that “OTS has recently become aware of several situations in which minority\n\nstockholders have acquired positions in the minority stock of Subsidiary Companies, and have\n\ntaken actions that appear intended to influence management to engage in stock repurchases or in\n\na sale of the institution.”    See Optional Charter Provisions in Mutual Holding Company\n\nStructures, 72 Fed. Reg. 35,205, 35,206 (proposed June 27, 2007) (emphasis added). In other\n\nwords, the “problem” addressed by the agency in Stilwell was already occurring. By contrast, in\n\nthe instant case, the Commission stated that in the Final Rule it was promulgating minimum\n\nliquidation times as a prophylactic measure to “prevent a potential ‘race to the bottom’ by\n\ncompeting DCOs.” See Final Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,367 (emphasis added). Second, the OTS\n\nregulation in Stilwell was intended to encourage MHC subsidiaries to take a certain action: adopt\n\nthe minority stakeholder provision. See Stilwell, 569 F.3d at 518. By contrast, in this case the\n\nCommission adopted minimum liquidation times to prevent third-parties from taking certain\n\nactions: setting minimum liquidation times too low. In other words, the minimum liquidation\n\ntimes in the instant case were not designed to encourage DCOs to adopt the bare minimum\n\nliquidation time for all transactions, as the plaintiff repeatedly assumes. In this way, the plaintiff\n\nmisreads the import of Stilwell’s reasoning: The plaintiff in Stilwell had standing because it was\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n\f“near-certain” that regulated third-parties would implement the solution provided by the agency,\n\nwhich would, in turn, cause the plaintiff harm. See id. That reasoning is inapposite in the instant\n\ncase because the third-party actions that would potentially harm the plaintiff—DCOs setting\n\ndifferential liquidation times for financial swap futures and financial swaps—is neither mandated\n\nnor encouraged by the Commission’s rule. 21\n\n         Due to the absence of any factual allegation that DCOs are setting or are imminently\n\nlikely to set liquidation times for financial swap futures at a level lower than that for financial\n\nswaps, the plaintiff cannot establish a “‘substantial probability’ of injury as a result of the rule.”\n\nStilwell, 569 F.3d at 518 (quoting St. John’s United Church of Christ v. FAA, 520 F.3d 460, 462\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2008)).        Indeed, without the substantial probability of DCOs setting differential\n\nliquidation times for financial swaps and financial swap futures, the rest of the plaintiff’s theory\n\nof injury becomes utterly unsupportable. As the D.C. Circuit has clearly stated, “[s]peculative\n\nand unsupported assumptions regarding the future actions of third-party market participants are\n\ninsufficient to establish Article III standing.” Crete Carrier Corp. v. EPA, 363 F.3d 490, 494\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2004); accord Branton v. FCC, 993 F.2d 906, 912 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (“A court is\n\nrightly reluctant to enter a judgment which may have no real consequence, depending upon the\n\nputative cost-benefit analysis of third parties over whom it has no jurisdiction and about whom it\n\nhas almost no information.”).           Therefore, this Court cannot conclude that the plaintiff has\n\nestablished a cognizable injury-in-fact under Article III.\n\n\n\n\n21\n   Indeed, even assuming the plaintiff is correct in its crucial premise that “financial swaps and futures often have\nindistinguishable economic characteristics and risk profiles,” Pl.’s Mem. at 1, it is telling that (1) no DCO has\nrequested the ability to clear financial swaps with lower than a five-day liquidation time, see Decl. of John Lawton\n¶ 34, ECF No. 21-1; and (2) there is no allegation that any DCO has cleared any financial swap future with less than\na five-day liquidation time.\n\n                                                         43\n\f               2.      Causation and Redressability\n\n       Even assuming that the plaintiff could establish an injury-in-fact, however, the plaintiff’s\n\ntheory of causation and redressability is also speculative and is thus also fundamentally\n\ninsufficient to establish standing. Once again, the plaintiff’s contentions in this regard are\n\nremarkably perfunctory and devoid of factual support. All that the plaintiff says in its reply brief\n\nabout causation and redressability is (1) “[t]he Rule’s discriminatory treatment of financial swaps\n\nand futures will cause market participants to shift their business to DCMs, thus causing\n\nPlaintiff’s injury,” and (2) “[t]his injury would be redressed by an order vacating the Rule’s\n\ndiscriminatory regime, which would close the regulatory arbitrage loophole that is the source of\n\nthe Plaintiff’s injury-in-fact.” Pl.’s Reply at 21 (emphasis omitted). The plaintiff makes these\n\nconclusory statements as if they are self-evident, but in doing so the plaintiff is counting its\n\nproverbial chickens before they are hatched.\n\n       At the outset, the plaintiff’s formulation of causation and redressability ignores the role of\n\nDCOs entirely. The plaintiff simply says that the minimum-liquidation-time rule, on its own,\n\n“will cause market participants to shift their business to DCMs,” id. (emphasis omitted), but that\n\nreasoning leaves out the critical intermediary behavior of DCOs who, it is worth once again\n\nnoting, are the entities who actually set the liquidation times for derivatives. The plaintiff has\n\nnot presented any factual allegation or even any theory of economics that would support the\n\nnotion that market participants (i.e., derivatives traders or their clients) would “shift their\n\nbusiness to DCMs” based solely on the existence of minimum liquidation times, as opposed to\n\nactual liquidation times set by DCOs. The plaintiff does not appear to contest the central role of\n\nDCOs; instead, Bloomberg simply chooses to ignore that role for purposes of standing.\n\n       The plaintiff also fails to address a long line of precedent from this Circuit and from the\n\nSupreme Court, which requires a plaintiff in Bloomberg’s position to allege facts that, if true,\n                                                44\n\fwould provide “‘formidable evidence’ of causation” or at least “substantial evidence of a causal\n\nrelationship between the government policy and the third-party conduct, leaving little doubt as to\n\ncausation and the likelihood of redress.” See National Wrestling Coaches, 366 F.3d at 941–42\n\n(emphasis omitted). On this point, the D.C. Circuit’s decision in National Wrestling Coaches is\n\ninstructive. There, plaintiffs challenged an interpretive rule promulgated by the Department of\n\nEducation, which laid out three ways in which the Department would assess whether educational\n\ninstitutions had complied with Department regulations that required such institutions to select\n\nsports and levels of competition to “effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of\n\nmembers of both sexes.’” See id. at 934–35 (quoting 45 C.F.R. § 86.41(c)(1) and 34 C.F.R.\n\n§ 106.41(c)(1)). That regulation had been promulgated pursuant to Title IX of the Education\n\nAmendments of 1972, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded\n\neducational programs and activities.        See id. at 934.      The plaintiffs were “membership\n\norganizations representing the interests of collegiate men’s wrestling coaches, athletes, and\n\nalumni,” and their asserted injuries arose “from decisions by educational institutions to eliminate\n\nor reduce the size of men’s wrestling programs to comply with the Department’s interpretive\n\nrules implementing Title IX.” Id. at 935. Thus, in National Wrestling Coaches, like in the\n\ninstant case, “the necessary elements of causation and redressability . . . hinge[d] on the\n\nindependent choices of . . . regulated third part[ies].” Id. at 938.\n\n       The D.C. Circuit found causation and redressability lacking in National Wrestling\n\nCoaches because “nothing but speculation suggests that schools would act any differently than\n\nthey do with the [challenged interpretive rule] in place” since “[s]chools would remain free to\n\neliminate or cap men’s wrestling teams and may in some circumstances feel compelled to do so\n\nto comply with the statute and the [previous Department] Regulations.” Id. at 940. Further, the\n\n\n\n                                                  45\n\fcourt found that “other reasons unrelated to the challenged legal requirements [e.g., moral\n\nconsiderations, budget constraints] may continue to motivate schools to take such actions.” Id.\n\nFrom this analysis, and a comprehensive review of the case law, the National Wrestling Coaches\n\ncourt concluded that “it is purely speculative whether a decision in appellants’ favor would alter\n\nthe process by which schools determine whether to field certain sports teams.” Id. at 944.\n\n        Similarly here, absent the minimum liquidation times, DCOs would “remain free” to set\n\nliquidation times for financial swaps at or above five days “and may in some circumstances feel\n\ncompelled to do so to comply with the statute and the [Commission’s other regulations].” Id. at\n\n940. Recall that DCOs, even absent the minimum-liquidation-time rule, would be obligated by\n\nlaw to set margin requirements that are “sufficient to cover potential exposures in normal market\n\nconditions.” 7 U.S.C. § 7a-1(c)(2)(D)(iv). Also similarly to National Wrestling Coaches, it is\n\nclear that “other reasons unrelated to the challenged [minimum liquidation times] may continue\n\nto motivate [DCOs] to take such actions.” See National Wrestling Coaches, 366 F.3d at 940.\n\nNamely, DCOs have significant skin in the game when it comes to setting margin requirements\n\nbecause they carry all counterparty risk when they clear derivatives. Given the fact that DCOs\n\nhave consistently elected, both before and after the promulgation of the Commission’s minimum\n\nliquidation times, to set liquidation times for financial swaps at or above five days, see, e.g.,\n\nFinal Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,367, 69,419, 22 it would be nothing more than speculation to\n\nconclude that this behavior would change absent the rule.\n\n\n\n22\n  This observation is further supported by the CFTC roundtable discussion that included numerous statements from\nDCOs about the appropriate margining of financial swaps. See, e.g., Tr. of Roundtable at 147:11–15 (statement of\nDCO president that “before there even were regulations that were propagated about any kind of margin coverage\nperiod minimum, we had already determined that the margin coverage period we were going to target for the credit\ndefault swaps and the interest rate swaps was five days”); id. at 176:12–13 (statement of DCO president that “[w]e\nhave been doing five days for swaps since 1999”). Therefore, it is perhaps no wonder that the plaintiff has not been\nable to allege that any DCO would set liquidation times for financial swaps below five days absent the challenged\nrule.\n\n                                                        46\n\f       The plaintiff’s only response to this is that the Commission has predicted a “race to the\n\nbottom” among DCOs, and this prediction is sufficient to conclude that DCOs’ behavior will\n\nchange if the minimum liquidation times were set aside. See, e.g., Pl.’s Reply at 10, 21–22. This\n\npoint, which pervades the plaintiff’s standing arguments, disregards the important and\n\nmeaningful difference between (1) the predictive judgments of an agency made to support a\n\nprophylactic regulation; and (2) the showing of a likelihood of redressability that is required by\n\nArticle III to establish standing. With regard to the latter, “[a]bstract theory and conjecture are\n\nnot enough to support standing.” National Wrestling Coaches, 366 F.3d at 944.              Instead,\n\nstanding requires a plaintiff to support its theory of injury, causation, and redressability with\n\nfacts (even if they are merely factual allegations). See, e.g., Sierra Club, 292 F.3d at 898. By\n\ncontrast, “[a]n agency’s predictive judgments about areas that are within the agency’s field of\n\ndiscretion and expertise are entitled to particularly deferential review, as long as they are\n\nreasonable, and need not rest on pure factual determinations.” EarthLink, Inc. v. FCC, 462 F.3d\n\n1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the Commission\n\nitself recognized in the Final Rule that “possible future circumstances surrounding margin levels\n\nare too speculative and uncertain to be able to quantify or estimate the resulting costs . . . from\n\nthe rule with any precision or degree of magnitude.” Final Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,419. Thus,\n\nthe plaintiff’s heavy reliance on the Commission’s predictions to establish Bloomberg’s standing\n\nis fundamentally misplaced because those predictions are not held to the same standard as the\n\nfactual basis for a plaintiff’s standing to sue. It would not be “implausible to hypothesize” or\n\n“beyond the pale to assume” that DCOs might set liquidation times below five days for certain\n\nfinancial swap futures at some point, but hypotheses and assumptions are insufficient to establish\n\n\n\n\n                                                47\n\fstanding, see National Wrestling Coaches, 366 F.3d at 943–44, even if they are sufficient to\n\nsupport an agency’s predictive judgments.\n\n       Moreover, it is worth noting that the reasoning at the heart of National Wrestling\n\nCoaches is not unique and has been applied in numerous other cases from this Circuit and in the\n\nSupreme Court to conclude that a plaintiff lacks standing. See, e.g., Allen, 468 U.S. at 758;\n\nSimon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 40–46 (1976); Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490,\n\n507 (1975); Renal Physicians, 489 F.3d at 1276–78; Crete Carrier, 363 F.3d at 493–94; Fla.\n\nAudubon Soc’y v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 669–71 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc); Freedom\n\nRepublicans, Inc. v. FEC, 13 F.3d 412, 416–19 (D.C. Cir. 1994); see also Grocery Mfrs. Ass’n v.\n\nEPA, 693 F.3d 169, 176 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (finding alleged injury “speculative at best” where it\n\n“depend[ed] upon the acts of third parties not before the court”); C-SPAN v. FCC, 545 F.3d\n\n1051, 1054–57 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (concluding that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge\n\nregulation imposed on third-party market participants where causation and redressability were\n\n“speculative”). The exceptions to this line of cases further illuminate the insufficiency of the\n\nplaintiff’s showing regarding standing.\n\n       In two cases from this Circuit—Tozzi v. U.S. Department of Health & Human Services,\n\n271 F.3d 301 (D.C. Cir. 2001) and Block v. Meese, 793 F.2d 1303 (D.C. Cir. 1986)—the Court\n\nof Appeals found causation and redressability despite the fact that the challenged agency action\n\nregulated third parties not before the court. As the Circuit recognized in National Wrestling\n\nCoaches, however, both of those cases contained “records [that] presented substantial evidence\n\nof a causal relationship between the government policy and the third-party conduct, leaving little\n\ndoubt as to causation and the likelihood of redress.” National Wrestling Coaches, 366 F.3d at\n\n941. For example, in Tozzi, the plaintiffs—manufacturers of PVC plastic that contained a\n\n\n\n                                               48\n\fchemical called dioxin—challenged a decision by HHS to add dioxin to the category of “known”\n\ncarcinogens. See id. (discussing Tozzi). The court found standing based on the introduction of\n\n“affidavits and other record evidence demonstrating that municipalities and health care\n\norganizations opted to phase out their use of PVC plastic as a direct result of the Secretary’s\n\ndecision.” Id. (citing Tozzi, 271 F.3d at 308–09). Similarly, Block involved a challenge by a\n\ngroup of film distributors to a decision of the Department of Justice to classify certain films as\n\n“political propaganda.” See Block, 793 F.2d at 1306–07. The court concluded that the plaintiffs\n\nhad established causation and redressability based on “the recitation of instances in which\n\npotential customers declined to take the film because of the classification,” as well as “the\n\naffidavits of potential customers” stating that they would have purchased the films, but for the\n\ngovernment’s classification. Id. at 1308. It is precisely this sort of evidence about the conduct of\n\nrelevant third parties—whether presented through factual allegations or through sworn\n\ndeclarations—that is noticeably absent from this case.\n\n                                                       ***\n\n         As the foregoing discussion makes clear, the plaintiff has failed to establish any of the\n\nthree elements of the “irreducible constitutional minimum” for Article III standing. See Lujan,\n\n504 U.S. at 560. Therefore, the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over this dispute. 23\n\n\n\n23\n  The Commission also argues that the plaintiff lacks prudential standing. See Def.’s Opp’n at 18–20. There is a\ndebate within this Circuit about whether prudential standing is a jurisdictional issue. Compare Ass’n of Battery\nRecyclers, Inc. v. EPA, Nos. 12-1129, 12-1130, 12-1134, and 12-1135, 2013 WL 2302713, at *6 (D.C. Cir. May 28,\n2013) (Silberman, J., concurring) (“[W]e treat prudential standing as a jurisdictional limit that cannot be waived.”),\nwith Grocery Mfrs. Ass’n, 693 F.3d at 182 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (“[P]rudential standing is not jurisdictional,\nmeaning that it can be forfeited and need not be considered by the court if the defendant or respondent does not\nassert it.”). Whether or not prudential standing is jurisdictional, however, need not be addressed here because the\nCourt dismisses this case on the basis of Article III standing. Nevertheless, one argument raised by the plaintiff\nabout the standard that applies to the prudential standing inquiry prompts this Court to address briefly the\nappropriate standard when the question is whether the plaintiff is “arguably within the zone of interests to be\nprotected or regulated by the statute that he says was violated.” Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi\nIndians v. Patchak, 132 S. Ct. 2199, 2210 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                                         49\n\f         B.       Irreparable Harm\n\n         Although the plaintiff’s lack of standing requires the Court to dismiss this case without\n\nreaching the merits, see, e.g., Dominguez v. UAL Corp., 666 F.3d 1359, 1362 (D.C. Cir. 2012)\n\n(“[E]very federal court has a special obligation to satisfy itself of its own jurisdiction before\n\naddressing the merits of any dispute.”), the Court will briefly touch upon the issue of irreparable\n\nharm, since this case comes before the Court in the context of an application for preliminary\n\ninjunction. 24 Even assuming that the plaintiff could nudge its theory of standing from the realm\n\nof speculation to the arena of the substantially probable, the plaintiff still would not be able to\n\nThis “zone of interests” requirement is “a gloss on the meaning of [5 U.S.C.] § 702,” Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n,\n479 U.S. 388, 395 (1987), which limits the universe of persons permitted to sue under the APA to those “adversely\naffected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,” 5 U.S.C. § 702. “The essential\ninquiry” of the zone-of-interests test “is whether Congress ‘intended for a particular class of plaintiffs to be relied\nupon to challenge agency disregard of the law.’” Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399 (quoting Block v. Cmty. Nutrition Inst.,\n467 U.S. 340, 347 (1984)). The plaintiff states in its reply brief that the APA itself may serve as the reference point\nfor the zone of interests inquiry. See Pl.’s Reply at 23 (“It is thus the APA and the CEA that are the ‘particular\nprovision of law’ at issue.” (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 175–76 (1997)). The Court disagrees. The\nzone of interests test inquires “whether a plaintiff (or petitioner) in an APA cause of action is within the ‘zone of\ninterests’ of the relevant substantive statute.” See Ass’n of Battery Recyclers, 2013 WL 2302713, at *6 (Silberman,\nJ., concurring) (emphasis added). Indeed, as discussed above, the Supreme Court has observed that the “zone of\ninterests” requirement is “a gloss on the meaning of [5 U.S.C.] § 702,” Clarke, 479 U.S. at 395, and that statute\nplainly limits standing under the APA to persons “adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the\nmeaning of a relevant statute,” 5 U.S.C. § 702 (emphasis added). As one panel of the Sixth Circuit observed, “[i]t\nwould . . . make little sense to look to the statutory purposes underlying § 706 to determine prudential standing in\nevery judicial review case” because “[i]t is only possible to ascertain that action is arbitrary or capricious by looking\nat other substantive bases of law.” Dismas Charities, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 401 F.3d 666, 675 n.5 (6th Cir.\n2005); see also id. (“While § 706 may be the lens for judicial review, it is upon [the substantive statute] that plaintiff\nultimately relies as a basis for relief.”).\n24\n  Although any economic harm to Bloomberg may be “irreparable” in the sense that it would not be recoverable,\nsee, e.g., Philip Morris USA Inc. v. Scott, 131 S. Ct. 1, 4 (2010) (Scalia, J., in chambers) (“If expenditures cannot be\nrecouped, the resulting loss may be irreparable.”), the plaintiff also posits a theory of irreparable harm based on a\n“network effect” among swap trading platforms, see, e.g., Pl.’s Mem. at 20–21, 39–41. A “network effect” is\npresent when the value of a product depends on the number of people who use it. This phenomenon is often present\nfor product “platforms” that are used to consume other products (e.g., computer operating systems, media standards,\nsocial networking websites). When a product must be consumed through a platform, the platform becomes more\nvaluable to consumers as more people use it. Once a platform develops a “critical mass” of participants in the\nmarket, a “tipping point” occurs, whereby that platform becomes entrenched as the “dominant” platform, and users\nof that platform become “locked in” to that platform, to the exclusion of other platforms. See Pl.’s Mem. at 21, 41–\n42. Although the plaintiff’s network effects theory need not be addressed in detail because the Court does not reach\nthe merits of the plaintiff’s Application for a Preliminary Injunction, this network effects theory appears dubious\nbecause, even assuming “futurization” occurs, that phenomenon would, ceteris paribus, only encourage the\ndeparture of customers who trade standardized, “plain vanilla” swaps, but would not similarly encourage the\ndeparture of those who trade customized, bespoke instruments. Due to this fact, and Bloomberg’s estimates\nregarding the number of subscribers it would lose due to futurization, it appears unlikely that futurization would\ncause a “tipping point” beyond which Bloomberg’s trading platform would become permanently damaged.\n\n                                                           50\n\fcome close to satisfying the “high standard for irreparable injury” within the preliminary\n\ninjunction inquiry. Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2006). Such injury “must be both certain and great” and the moving party must show “the\n\ninjury complained of is of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable\n\nrelief.” Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam) (emphasis and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n         Even granting the plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences, the plaintiff has still\n\nfailed to present any potential injury to its business that is simultaneously “certain,” “great,” and\n\n“imminen[t].” See id. The plaintiff’s theorized injury falls especially short with regard to\n\ncertainty and imminence. As discussed above, the presence of the plaintiff’s injury is based\n\nentirely on a series of worst-case scenario assumptions that are anything but certain to occur.25\n\nFurthermore, although the plaintiff ties the imminence of its harm to the June 10, 2013\n\ncompliance date for mandatory swap clearing of Category 2 entities, this date appears to the\n\nCourt to be nothing more than a red herring. The plaintiff has not explained why this date has\n\nany significance to DCOs in setting margin levels. As the Court has repeatedly stressed, DCOs\n\nare the only actors who could set into motion the series of market events that would result in the\n\ninjury that Bloomberg fears. Yet the plaintiff has failed to explain why DCOs would suddenly\n\n\n25\n   The plaintiff’s primary piece of evidence accompanying its Application for Preliminary Injunction to support the\nmagnitude and certainty of its harm was a declaration authored by Benjamin P. Macdonald, who is Bloomberg’s\nHead of Core Product. See Macdonald Decl. ¶ 1. Although the Court will not divulge any of the particular numbers\nincluded in that declaration because they are sealed and highly confidential, the Court does observe that the\nestimates Mr. Macdonald provided in his declaration were based on speculative assumptions and contained several\nunexplained leaps from generalized characterizations about market trends to specific figures about lost revenues, as\nwell as mathematical errors. Following discussion at oral argument about the deficiencies in this declaration, the\nCourt permitted Bloomberg to supplement its evidence. Mr. Macdonald filed a supplementary declaration in which\nhe candidly admitted that all of his original calculations were backwards, stating: “The calculation [of users lost as a\nresult of the rule] in my initial declaration . . . mistakenly reported the users . . . that Bloomberg is expected to retain\nin spite of the Rule, rather than those it expected to lose as a direct result of the Rule.” See Supp. Decl. of Benjamin\nP. Macdonald ¶ 5, ECF No. 30-1 (emphasis in original). Such a glaring error, in combination with the speculative\nassumptions on which his conclusions were based, undermines the persuasiveness of Mr. Macdonald’s\nmethodology.\n\n                                                            51\n\fchange their margining practices with respect to financial swap futures and financial swaps\n\nsimply because a broader universe of entities will be required to clear their swaps. This sleight\n\nof hand by the plaintiff, like its arguments regarding standing, does not change the reality that,\n\nonce the plaintiff’s hyperbolic rhetoric is swept away, no facts are left to sustain the relief it\n\nseeks.\n\nIV.      CONCLUSION\n\n         As discussed above, the Court concludes that the plaintiff lacks standing to assert its\n\nclaims. As a result, the Court must dismiss this case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n         An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n         Date: June 7, 2013\n\n                                                       /s/ Beryl A.

The plaintiff Bloomberg L.P.\n\n(“Bloomberg”) claims, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 500,\n\net seq., that the Commission’s regulation is both procedurally and substantively defective and\n\nmust be set aside. Further, the plaintiff has applied for a preliminary injunction against the\n\nchallenged regulation, claiming that a forthcoming phase of a related rule’s implementation will\n\ncause the plaintiff imminent and irreparable harm if the minimum liquidation times are not\n\nenjoined. In this regard, Bloomberg alleges that, unless immediately enjoined, the Commission’s\n\nregulation prescribing minimum liquidation times, when combined with other regulatory and\n\nmarket forces, will encourage the plaintiff’s subscribers to migrate permanently to competitors’\n\ntrading venues. The plaintiff, however, lacks standing to challenge the Commission’s regulation\n\nand has not made a showing of imminent and irreparable harm sufficient to warrant the\n\nextraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction. Therefore, as discussed below, the Court denies\n\n\n\n\n                                                1\n\fthe plaintiff’s application for preliminary injunctive relief and dismisses this case for lack of\n\nstanding.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n       Since this is an administrative law case, it is appropriate first to discuss generally the\n\neconomic and regulatory framework of the challenged rule. Next, the Court will discuss the\n\nfactual and procedural background of the particular rule being challenged.\n\n       A.      Economic and Regulatory Framework\n\n       This case is about how the CFTC regulates the trading of derivatives. “Derivatives are\n\nfinancial contracts whose prices are determined by, or ‘derived’ from, the value of some\n\nunderlying asset, rate, index, or event.” Nat’l Comm’n on the Causes of the Fin. & Econ. Crisis:\n\nThe Financial Crisis Inquiry Report: Final Report 45–46 (2011). These instruments are not used\n\nto form capital or invest; rather, they are used for “hedging business risk or for speculating on\n\nchanges in prices, interest rates, and the like.” Id. at 46. Although derivatives can come in many\n\nforms, there are two categories of derivatives implicated in this lawsuit: “swaps” and “futures.”\n\n               1.      How Swaps and Futures Contracts Are Traded\n\n       “A ‘swap’ is a contract that typically involves an exchange of one or more payments\n\nbased on the underlying value of a notional amount of one or more commodities, or other\n\nfinancial or economic interest,” and it “transfers between the parties the risk of future change in\n\nthat value without also transferring an ownership interest in the underlying asset or liability.”\n\nMem. in Supp. Pl.’s Appl. for Prelim. Inj. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) at 3–4, ECF No. 13 (citing 7 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1a(47)). In essence, the two parties to a swap agreement trade (or “swap”) the cash flows\n\nstemming from the assets or liabilities underlying the agreement. For example, a fixed-to-\n\nfloating interest rate swap is an agreement whereby one party agrees to pay the cash flows\n\nassociated with a fixed interest rate, while the other party agrees to pay the cash flows associated\n                                                 2\n\fwith a referenced floating interest rate (e.g., LIBOR). See, e.g., Financial Crisis Inquiry Report\n\nat 46. A “futures contract” or simply a “future,” by contrast, is “[a]n agreement to buy or sell a\n\nstandardized asset (such as a commodity, stock, or foreign currency) at a fixed price at a future\n\ntime.” BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 746 (9th ed. 2009).\n\n         Futures contracts or their functional equivalents have been traded for millennia. See, e.g.,\n\nMichael P. Jamroz, The Net Capital Rule, 47 BUS. LAW. 863, 890 n.186 (1992) (“The ultimate\n\norigins of the futures markets can be traced to 2000 B.C., where . . . ‘merchants of what is now\n\nBahrein Island took goods on consignment for barter in India.’” (quoting JERRY W. MARKHAM,\n\nTHE HISTORY OF COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING AND ITS REGULATION 3 (1987)). In the United\n\nStates, the first organized futures exchange was the Chicago Board of Trade, which officially\n\nbegan trading futures contracts in the 1860s. See MARKHAM, HISTORY OF COMMODITY FUTURES\n\nTRADING at 4. Indeed, “[b]y 1868, futures contracts had become standardized on the Chicago\n\nBoard of Trade.” Id. at 5. For several decades, futures exchanges operated without any federal\n\nregulatory oversight until 1922 when Congress enacted the Grain Futures Act, Pub. L. No. 67-\n\n331, 42 Stat. 998, which for the first time 1 required grain futures exchanges to be registered as\n\n“contract markets” and also required them to keep detailed records of trading information. See\n\n42 Stat. at 1000 (providing for designation of “contract markets” by Secretary of Agriculture,\n\nand requiring contract markets to keep records of the terms of futures transactions).\n\n         In 1936, Congress replaced the Grain Futures Act with the Commodity Exchange Act\n\n(“CEA”), Pub. L. No. 74-675, 49 Stat. 1491, which broadened federal regulation of futures,\n\n\n\n1\n  The Grain Futures Act was preceded by the Futures Trading Act of 1921, but that statute was declared\nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court shortly after it was enacted. See Hill v. Wallace, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99988\"><a href=\"/opinion/99988/hill-v-wallace/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68–70 (1922).\nOther than the fact that the Grain Futures Act was explicitly premised on Congress’s authority to regulate interstate\ncommerce, as opposed to its taxing power, the statute was “substantially identical to the [Futures Trading Act] that\nwas held unconstitutional.” MARKHAM, HISTORY OF COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING at 13.\n\n                                                         3\n\festablished the Commodity Exchange Commission, 2 and granted that agency the power to\n\nregulate futures traders directly (as opposed to only regulating contract markets). See 49 Stat. at\n\n1492. The CEA also, inter alia, (1) limited speculative positions that could be taken in futures\n\nmarkets, see id. § 5, and (2) established registration requirements for futures brokerage firms\n\nknown as “futures commission merchants,” id. The Commodity Exchange Commission also\n\n“informally urged the exchanges to adopt minimum margin requirements,” even though the\n\nstatute itself contained no authority to require the adoption of minimum margin rules. See\n\nMARKHAM, HISTORY OF COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING at 30. “Several exchanges agreed . . .\n\nand adopted minimum margin rules.” Id.\n\n        In 1974, federal regulation of futures was expanded even further with the enactment of\n\nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act, Pub. L. No. 93-463, 88 Stat. 1389. That\n\nstatute, which forms the basis of the current futures regulatory scheme, created the CFTC as an\n\nindependent federal agency, authorized to seek injunctive relief, to alter the rules of a contract\n\nmarket, and to prescribe trading limits. See Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v.\n\nCurran, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110701\"><a href=\"/opinion/110701/merrill-lynch-pierce-fenner-smith-inc-v-curran/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 365–66 (1982); see also CFTC Act § 101, 88 Stat. at 1389 (establishing\n\nthe CFTC “as an independent agency of the United States Government”).\n\n        Since the amendments to the CEA passed in the Futures Trading Act of 1982, the CEA\n\nhas required futures to be traded on centralized exchanges known as “designated contract\n\nmarkets” (“DCMs”), see 7 U.S.C. § 6(a); see also Futures Trading Act of 1982, Pub. L. No. 97-\n\n444, § 204, 96 Stat. 2294, 2299, which are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements that\n\nensure transparency and prudent risk management. For example, a DCM is required to “make\n\npublic daily information on settlement prices, volume, open interest, and opening and closing\n\n2\n  The Commodity Exchange Commission consisted of the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, and\nthe Attorney General. See 49 Stat. at 1492. It was later renamed the Commodity Exchange Authority. See\nMARKHAM, HISTORY OF COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING at 27.\n\n                                                     4\n\franges for actively traded contracts on the contract market.” 7 U.S.C. § 7(d)(8). Specifically,\n\nDCMs are required to make information on prices, trading volume, and other trading information\n\n“readily available to the news media and the general public without charge, in a format that\n\nreadily enables the consideration of such data, no later than the business day following the day to\n\nwhich the information pertains.” 17 C.F.R. §§ 16.01(e), 38.451. Additionally, every transaction\n\nexecuted on a DCM must be “cleared” through an entity called a “derivatives clearing\n\norganization” (“DCO”).          See 17 C.F.R. § 38.601(a); see also Part I.A.2 infra (discussing\n\noperation and regulation of DCOs). 3\n\n        By contrast to the ancient roots of futures contracts, swaps are a much newer\n\nphenomenon. Although “there is some debate regarding the timing of the first modern swap\n\nagreement, scholars generally agree that the execution of a swap agreement between the World\n\nBank and IBM [in 1981] was one of the earliest and most significant transactions in the\n\ndevelopment of the swap market.” Kristin N. Johnson, Things Fall Apart: Regulating the Credit\n\nDefault Swap Commons, 82 U. COLO. L. REV. 167, 193 n.141 (2011); see also Charles R.P.\n\nPouncy, Contemporary Financial Innovation: Orthodoxy and Alternatives, 51 SMU L. REV. 505,\n\n529–30 & n.153 (1998) (tracing roots of the swaps market and discussing the 1981 IBM/World\n\nBank currency swap transaction). Unlike futures, swaps were (before 2010) traded almost\n\nentirely in unregulated “over the counter” (“OTC”) markets, where large financial institutions\n\nacted as derivatives dealers. 4 See Financial Crisis Inquiry Report at 46. In OTC markets,\n\n\n3\n  Although central clearing of futures was not required by federal law until recently, modern clearinghouses for\nfutures have existed since the latter part of the 19th century. See Craig Pirrong, The Clearinghouse Cure,\nREGULATION, Winter 2008–09, at 45 (“The Minneapolis Grain Exchange established the first modern clearinghouse\nfor futures in 1891, and other futures exchanges in the United States adopted clearing in the years between 1891 and\n1925.”).\n4\n  In 2000, Congress enacted the Commodity Futures Modernization Act (“CFMA”), Pub. L. No. 106-554, 114 Stat.\n2763, which “effectively shielded OTC derivatives from virtually all regulation or oversight.” Financial Crisis\nInquiry Report at 48.\n\n                                                         5\n\ftransactions are not required to be cleared, dealers are not required to register with the\n\ngovernment, and trading information is not required to be made public. See id.\n\n         Without regulatory oversight, “OTC derivatives rapidly spiraled out of control and out of\n\nsight, growing to $673 trillion in notional amount.”                    Id. at xxiv.      OTC derivatives then\n\n“contributed significantly” to the global financial crisis in 2008, see id., and Congress responded\n\nby enacting the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank),\n\nPub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010). Dodd-Frank, among other things, (1) placed swaps\n\nwithin the jurisdiction of the CFTC, see Dodd-Frank, § 722(a), 124 Stat. at 1672, (2) required the\n\nCFTC to determine which swaps must be cleared, see id.§ 723(a)(3), 124 Stat. at 1676–77, and\n\n(3) mandated that all cleared swaps be traded like futures—on centralized, regulated exchanges,\n\nsee id., 124 Stat. at 1681; see also S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 34 (2010) (“Trading more derivatives\n\non regulated exchanges should be encouraged because it will result in more price transparency,\n\nefficiency in execution, and liquidity.”). 5 In particular, Dodd-Frank generally requires that all\n\ncleared swaps be traded on either a DCM or a new entity called a “swap execution facility”\n\n(“SEF”).     See 124 Stat. at 1681 (codified at 7 U.S.C. § 2(h)(8)). Since the CFTC’s rules\n\n\n\n\n5\n  The plaintiff contends that the challenged rule is contrary to the purposes of Dodd-Frank because it will put swap\nexecution facilities (“SEFs”) at a competitive disadvantage to DCMs. See, e.g., Pl.’s Mem. at 2 (“Dodd-Frank\nintroduced and sought to foster [SEFs] for the trading of swaps.”); id. at 16 (arguing that challenged rule will “deter\nthe development of the SEFs that Congress sought to encourage through the Dodd-Frank Act”); id. at 21 (arguing\nthat Congress “encouraged” SEFs); id. at 33 (arguing the challenged rule “will have serious adverse effects . . . on\nthe design and purpose of the Dodd-Frank Act”). The plaintiff essentially contends that Dodd-Frank was pro-SEF,\nrather than pro-transparency and pro-risk management, but the statute and its legislative history do not necessarily\nsupport that conclusion. First and foremost, Dodd-Frank explicitly requires cleared swaps to be traded on either a\nDCM or an SEF. See 7 U.S.C. § 2(h)(8). If SEFs were the favorite child, Congress could have designated SEFs the\nexclusive trading venues for swaps, much like DCMs are the exclusive trading venue for futures—but Congress did\nnot do so. Furthermore, the legislative history indicates that Congress was concerned with promoting the\ntransparency and risk management benefits that a regulated, centralized exchange would bring to the swap market—\nnot with promoting the exchange itself. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 33–34 (noting concern with lack of\nmargin requirements, central clearing, price discovery, and transparency in OTC derivatives markets). In short,\nthere is no conclusive legislative evidence that Congress preferred swaps to be traded on SEFs rather than DCMs,\nsince DCMs are also highly regulated, centrally cleared, and transparent marketplaces.\n\n                                                          6\n\fregarding mandatory clearing and SEFs are still being phased in, however, large swaths of swaps\n\ncontinue to be traded OTC. 6\n\n                 2.       Derivatives Clearing Organizations\n\n        DCOs are “clearinghouses or similar entities that enable the parties to a derivatives\n\ntransaction to substitute the credit of the DCO for the credit of the parties to the swap.” Pl.’s\n\nMem. at 7 (citing 7 U.S.C. § 2(h)(2)). A transaction is “cleared” when a member of a DCO uses\n\na novation to interpose itself between the two original counterparties to the derivatives contract,\n\nthereby assuming the credit risk of both counterparties. See, e.g., Adam J. Levitin, Response:\n\nThe Tenuous Case for Derivatives Clearinghouses, 101 GEO. L.J. 445, 451 (2013). “[E]ach\n\nDCM is connected to a single DCO . . . , which clears all futures contracts executed on that\n\nDCM.” Decl. of Dr. Sharon Brown-Hruska (“Brown-Hruska Decl.”) ¶ 17 (May 2, 2013), ECF\n\nNo. 13-4.\n\n        DCO members are generally large financial institutions who “invest capital that the\n\nclearinghouse can use to cover default losses,” and in this way a DCO is “analogous to a mutual\n\ninsurance company.” Pirrong, The Clearinghouse Cure at 46. Unlike a mutual insurance\n\ncompany, however, which charges premiums to the customers it insures, DCOs require their\n\nmembers to post a “margin” or a “performance bond,” which acts as collateral against the\n\npossibility of default. See id.; see also Def.’s Mem. in Opp’n to Pl.’ Appl. for Prelim. Inj.\n\n(“Def.’s Opp’n”) at 3, ECF No. 21. When a trade is first cleared, the DCO collects an initial\n\nmargin payment based on the amount of default risk assumed by the DCO, and then periodically\n\n(usually twice per day), the DCO will “mark positions to market” to ensure that “collateral\n\n\n6\n On June 4, 2013, the Commission published the final SEF rules in the Federal Register. See Core Principles and\nOther Requirements for Swap Execution Facilities, 78 Fed. Reg. 33,476 (June 4, 2013) (codified at 17 C.F.R. pt.\n37). Those SEF rules, however, do not go into effect until August 5, 2013, and prospective SEFs will not generally\nbe required to comply with the new rules until October 2, 2013. Id. at 33,476.\n\n                                                        7\n\freflects current market conditions.” See Pirrong, The Clearinghouse Cure at 46. For example, if\n\nthe price of a commodity goes down during the trading day, the buyer of a futures contract would\n\nbe required to post additional margin “to offset the risk that a buyer might walk away from a\n\nfutures contract in which the agreed-upon price now seems too high.” Id.\n\n        DCOs reference a number of inputs to calculate how much margin they will require for a\n\nparticular trade. In particular, “DCOs calculate the required margin according to a ‘value-at-\n\nrisk’ formula.” Def.’s Opp’n at 3. Value-at-risk (“VaR”) is a formula that uses historical market\n\ndata to predict what portion of a financial portfolio is statistically likely to be at risk of being lost\n\nin the market at any given point in time. See, e.g., The Risks of Financial Modeling: VaR and the\n\nEconomic Meltdown: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Investigations & Oversight of the H.\n\nComm. on Sci. & Tech., 111th Cong. 87 (2009) (statement of Gregg E. Berman, Head of Risk\n\nBusiness, RiskMetrics Group) (explaining how VaR is calculated).                In addition to market\n\nvolatility and other considerations, see id., one “standard input” to the VaR formula “is the\n\namount of time the DCO estimates it will take to liquidate the product or portfolio following a\n\ndefault,” Def.’s Opp’n at 3 & n.1. This is known as the “liquidation time” for a particular\n\nproduct or portfolio. See, e.g., Pl.’s Mem. at 8–9 (“Liquidation time is the estimated amount of\n\ntime it would take a DCO to ‘liquidate’ a position held by a clearing member on behalf of its\n\ncustomer, in the case of default.”). All else being equal, a higher liquidation time typically\n\nresults in a higher initial margin requirement. See id. at 9; see also Def.’s Opp’n at 3 n.1\n\n(providing typical VaR formula).\n\n        One portion of Dodd-Frank put in place eighteen “core principles,” with which DCOs are\n\nrequired to comply. See Dodd Frank, § 725(c), 124 Stat. at 1687–92 (codified at 7 U.S.C. § 7a-\n\n1(c)(2)). One of those principles—Core Principle D—addresses risk management and states\n\n\n\n                                                   8\n\fgenerally that each DCO “shall ensure that the [DCO] possesses the ability to manage the risks\n\nassociated with discharging the responsibilities of the [DCO] through the use of appropriate tools\n\nand procedures.”    7 U.S.C. § 7a-1(c)(2)(D)(i).    Of particular relevance to this case, Core\n\nPrinciple D states that “[t]he margin required from each member and participant of a [DCO]\n\nshall be sufficient to cover potential exposures in normal market conditions.”          Id. § 7a-\n\n1(c)(2)(D)(iv). Further, Core Principle D requires that “[e]ach model and parameter used in\n\nsetting margin requirements under clause (iv) shall be (I) risk-based; and (II) reviewed on a\n\nregular basis.” Id. § 7a-1(c)(2)(D)(v).\n\n       B.      Factual and Procedural Background\n\n               1.      The Proposed Rule\n\n       Pursuant to Dodd-Frank’s DCO Core Principles (including Core Principle D) and the\n\nrulemaking authority delegated by Congress in the CEA, see 7 U.S.C. § 12a(5), the Commission\n\npublished a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) on January 20, 2011.                 See Risk\n\nManagement Requirements for Derivatives Clearing Organizations, 76 Fed Reg. 3698 (proposed\n\nJan. 20, 2011). That NPRM proposed the promulgation of several rules implementing Core\n\nPrinciples C (Participant and Product Eligibility), D (Risk Management), E (Settlement\n\nProcedures), F (Treatment of Funds), G (Default Rules and Procedures), and I (System\n\nSafeguards). See id. at 3698. Of particular relevance to this case, the January 20, 2011 NPRM\n\nproposed a regulation that\n\n       would require a DCO to use margin models that generate initial margin\n       requirements sufficient to cover the DCO’s potential future exposures to clearing\n       members based on price movements in the interval between the last collection of\n       variation margin and the time within which the DCO estimates that it would be\n       able to liquidate a defaulting clearing member’s position (liquidation time).\n\nId. at 3704 (footnote omitted). The NPRM also proposed requiring DCOs to use liquidation\n\ntimes for this margin model that were: (1) “a minimum of five business days for cleared swaps\n\n                                                9\n\fthat are not executed on a DCM,” and (2) “a minimum of one business day for all other products\n\nthat it clears.” Id. The NPRM also proposed that a DCO “would be required to use longer\n\nliquidation times, if appropriate, based on the unique characteristics of particular products or\n\nportfolios.” Id.; see also id. at 3720–21 (proposing language of 17 C.F.R. § 39.13(g)(2)(ii)).\n\n       The Commission justified its proposed minimum liquidation times primarily by reference\n\nto current industry standards for DCOs. In this regard, the NPRM explained that “[a] minimum\n\nof one business day is the current standard that DCOs generally apply to futures and options on\n\nfutures contracts.”   Id. at 3704.   It further explained that “[s]everal clearing organizations\n\ncurrently use a five-day liquidation time in determining margin requirements for certain cleared\n\nswaps,” and thus “[t]he Commission believes that a minimum of five business days is\n\nappropriate for cleared swaps that are not executed on a DCM in that such a time period may be\n\nnecessary to close out swap positions in a cost-effective manner.” Id. Cognizant that it could\n\nbenefit from public comment, however, the Commission also stated that it would “invite[]\n\ncomment regarding whether the minimum liquidation times specified in proposed\n\n§ 39.13(g)(2)(ii) are appropriate, or whether there are minimum liquidation times that are more\n\nappropriate.” Id.\n\n               2.     Public Comments on the Proposed Rule\n\n       At a broader level, the CFTC proposed rules implementing Dodd-Frank’s DCO Core\n\nPrinciples through at least five separate NPRMs, including the January 20, 2011 NPRM\n\ndiscussed above. See 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,335. The Commission had an initial comment period of\n\nsixty days for each NPRM, followed by a thirty-day reopened comment period, which was\n\nfollowed yet again by a late comment period lasting until August 25, 2011. See id. Therefore,\n\npublic comment regarding the January 20, 2011 NPRM lasted for approximately eight months.\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\fDuring that time, the Commission received approximately 119 comment letters directed at the\n\nproposed rules regarding DCO Core Principles. See id. 7\n\n        Numerous commenters remarked specifically on the Commission’s proposed minimum\n\nliquidation times, though even the limited sample of comments submitted to the Court reveal a\n\ndiversity of opinions on the appropriate policy for setting liquidation times. 8 Many of these\n\ncomments took issue with the venue-based approach used in the NPRM.                               For example,\n\nLCH.Clearnet Group Limited—a large derivatives clearinghouse—suggested that “the rules\n\nshould not prescribe differential margining treatment for Swaps with equivalent economic and\n\nrisk profiles based on whether these are executed on a [DCM] or elsewhere.” See Decl. of Mary\n\nT. Connelly (“Connelly Decl.”) Ex. A (“LCH Comment Letter”) at 11, ECF No. 21-2. Similarly,\n\nBlackRock, an asset management firm that represents several derivatives traders, “encourage[d]\n\nthe CFTC not to treat swaps executed on [SEFs] differently from those executed on [DCMs], for\n\npurposes of a DCO’s margin calculation.” Connelly Decl. Ex. B (“BlackRock Comment Letter”)\n\nat 2, ECF No. 21-2; see also Connelly Decl. Ex. H (“Nodal Exchange Comment Letter”) at 2,\n\nECF No. 21-2 (“Nodal Exchange is concerned that the Commission is prescribing initial margin\n\nmethodology requirements based solely on the swap’s execution venue rather than the swap’s\n\ninherent risk characteristics.”).\n\n        In this same vein, numerous commenters raised concerns that the proposed venue-based\n\nrule would have anticompetitive effects in the swap trading platform marketplace. For example,\n\nBlackRock stated that the rule “would raise the cost of executing swaps on SEFs, undermine the\n\n7\n The Commission’s website indicates that it received 116 comment letters responding specifically to the January 20,\n2011 NPRM. See CFTC, Comments for Proposed Rule 76 Fed. Reg. 3698,\nhttp://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/CommentList.aspx?id=957 (last visited June 7, 2013) (listing 116\ncomments).\n8\n At this early stage, the Court does not have the benefit of consulting a comprehensive Administrative Record.\nTherefore, the Court’s summary of the materials considered by the Commission is limited to the evidence that the\nparties have submitted in connection with the plaintiff’s Application for a Preliminary Injunction.\n\n                                                        11\n\fcompetitiveness of SEFs, and restrict artificially the ability of market participants, including\n\nasset managers, to select the best means of execution for their swap transactions.” BlackRock\n\nComment Letter at 3. GFI Group Inc., which is a derivatives broker, was concerned that the\n\nvenue-based approach “would inadvertently place [SEFs] that list cleared swaps for trading at a\n\ndisadvantage relative to [DCMs] that list the same swaps,” which GFI believed was “inconsistent\n\nwith” the CEA’s open-access provisions that “require a DCO to adopt rules providing that all\n\nswaps with the same terms and conditions submitted to the DCO for clearing are economically\n\nequivalent within the DCO.” Connelly Decl. Ex. D (“GFI Comment Letter”) at 1–2, ECF No.\n\n21-2; see also id. at 3 (“[T]he Proposed Rule would effectively place a ‘tax’ on market\n\nparticipants that desire to trade swaps on a SEF and would thus put SEFs at a competitive\n\ndisadvantage that is neither necessary nor appropriate under the [CEA].”).        MarketAxess\n\nCorporation, another dealer-broker, raised similar concerns.       See Connelly Decl. Ex. E\n\n(“MarketAxess Comment Letter”) at 2, ECF No. 21-2 (noting that venue-based approach “would\n\nplace SEFs at a significant competitive disadvantage relative to DCMs and would frustrate\n\ncongressional intent”).\n\n       By contrast, at least one commenter cautioned that competition between DCOs with\n\nregard to margin requirements could prove ruinous. Alice Corporation Pty Ltd, an Australian\n\nfinancial markets research and development company, commented that the Commission should\n\n“[a]void a ‘race to the bottom’ between DCOs.” See Connelly Decl. Ex. I (“Alice Comment\n\nLetter”) at 8, ECF No. 21-2. In particular Alice noted that “[c]ompetition between DCOs has\n\nsystemic risk consequences and careful oversight will be required to ensure competition on\n\nmargin and clearing fees does not increase risk.” Id. Alice went on to remark that “[t]here is\n\ngreat pressure from market participants for offset across different products,” and therefore\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f“[o]ffsets across products with different maturities and risk profiles should be avoided where\n\npossible.” Id.\n\n       As an alternative to a venue-based approach, several commenters advocated for a\n\nprinciples-based approach that would permit each DCO to set liquidation times in its discretion.\n\nSee, e.g., LCH Comment Letter at 11 (suggesting that liquidation times should “be an objective\n\nfunction of the DCO’s measurement of observed market volumes in given products and set at a\n\nperiod that would be sufficient to enable the DCO to adequately hedge or close-out a defaulting\n\nmember’s risk”). In this regard, some commenters suggested adopting the clearing standards set\n\nforth by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and Technical Committee of the\n\nInternational Organization of Securities Commissions (“CPSS-IOSCO”). See Connelly Decl.\n\nEx. C (“Citadel Comment Letter”) at 4, ECF No. 21-2; Connelly Decl. Ex. F (“MFA Comment\n\nLetter”) at 5, ECF No. 21-2. Others suggested simply setting a one-day minimum liquidation\n\ntime for all swaps and futures contracts regardless of trading venue. See GFI Comment Letter at\n\n2; Nodal Exchange Comment Letter at 3.\n\n       By contrast, other comments noted that setting higher liquidation times for certain swaps\n\nthan for other swaps and all futures would be appropriate. For example, LCH commented that\n\n“the current disparity between Swaps and futures contracts requires different risk management\n\ntechniques and clearing processes.” See LCH Comment Letter at 1. Although LCH “expect[ed]\n\ncontract convergence as Swaps become more futures-like,” it commented that “it would be\n\ninappropriate at this stage to impose futures clearing criteria on long-dated, idiosyncratic and less\n\nliquid instruments.” Id. Indeed, LCH explicitly stated that “the proposed time interval of one\n\nbusiness day in [§ 39.13(g)(2)(ii)] is too short” for several reasons, including because “it can, and\n\noften will, be impossible for the DCO to close out the defaulting member’s position within a\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fone-day liquidation period,” which “is particularly important for DCOs clearing less liquid\n\nSwaps.”     Id. at 11.      Nodal Exchange similarly remarked that, although the Commission’s\n\napparent view “that all swaps are inherently customized and lack the standard terms and\n\nconditions of futures contracts, necessitating a longer liquidation time” was not categorically\n\ntrue, it “may be true for many financial swaps.” Nodal Exchange Comment Letter at 2. 9\n\n                 3.       The Final Rule\n\n         After considering this diverse array of public comments, the Commission published its\n\nfinal rule regarding minimum liquidation times (and several other topics) in the Federal Register\n\non November 8, 2011. See Derivatives Clearing Organization General Provisions and Core\n\nPrinciples (“Final Rule”), 76 Fed. Reg. 69,334 (Nov. 8, 2011) (codified at 17 C.F.R. pt. 39).\n\nThis Final Rule, a portion of which is the subject of the instant legal challenge, requires, in\n\npertinent part, that a DCO must use (A) “[a] minimum liquidation time that is one day for futures\n\nand options,” (B) “[a] minimum liquidation time that is one day for swaps on agricultural\n\n\n9\n  Although it took place after the rulemaking challenged in this case and would not be included in the administrative\nrecord for the rule, these same concerns about risk management were echoed at a recent roundtable discussion\norganized by the CFTC, which was submitted by the plaintiff in this case. At that discussion, at least two panelists\ndiscussed their belief that there are fundamental differences in the risk profiles of swaps and futures. For example,\nKim Taylor, who is the president of the DCO affiliated with the CME exchange, pointed out several factors her\nDCO considers in setting liquidation times—such as concentration, accessibility, transparency and continuity of\nliquidity; and default management procedures—and why swaps differ from futures on some of those metrics. See\nTr. of Roundtable at 147:18–150:21 (Jan. 31, 2013), ECF No. 13-5. With particular regard to default management,\nMs. Taylor pointed out that, when a future defaults, the DCO “ha[s] a number of choices generally on how we can\nliquidate,” while with swaps they “really only have a single choice which is to run an auction.” Id. at 150:4–16.\nInterestingly, Ms. Taylor said that, as a result of these differences, “you can effectively be margining [swaps and\nfutures] the same way and come up with different coverage targets [i.e., liquidation times] that would be necessary.”\nId. at 151:3–5. Additionally, Don Wilson, who is the founder and CEO of the DRW Trading Group, which is an\norganization that trades in derivatives on a regular basis, said that “there are important differences between swaps\nand futures” and “swaps incur greater risk to the clearinghouse than economically equivalent and equally liquid\nfutures contracts.” Id. at 138:3–13. Also touching upon default management procedures, Mr. Wilson pointed out\nthe risk differences between the gross omnibus model used for futures and the “legal segregation with operational\ncommingling” (“LSOC”) model that is used for swaps, in the event of a default. See id. at 138:13–140:17. He\nexplained that, under LSOC, there is a higher risk to the DCO from a defaulted swap because there are fewer\nsources of collateral to cover the default before the DCO’s capital reserves need to be tapped to cover the loss. See\nid. at 66:5–18. Under the omnibus model used in futures, by contrast, a DCM will draw on its non-defaulting\ncustomers’ initial margins before the DCO must draw on its capital reserves. He concluded from this that “it’s\nentirely reasonable and it would actually be shocking to me if clearinghouses didn’t charge higher margins for\ncleared swaps than for futures.” Id. at 66:21–67:2 (emphasis added).\n\n                                                        14\n\fcommodities, energy commodities, and metals,” (C) “[a] minimum liquidation time that is five\n\ndays for all other swaps,” or (D) “[s]uch longer liquidation time as is appropriate based on the\n\nspecific characteristics of a particular product or portfolio.” Id. at 69,438 (codified at 17 C.F.R.\n\n§ 39.13(g)(2)(ii)).   The Final Rule further provided that “the Commission, by order, may\n\nestablish shorter or longer liquidation times for particular products or portfolios.” Id.\n\n                       a)      Explaining the Final Rule\n\n       The Commission discussed this minimum-liquidation-time rule by first reviewing the\n\ncomments that it received. The Commission recognized that “[n]umerous commenters objected\n\nto the proposed difference in requirements that would subject swaps that were either executed\n\nbilaterally or executed on a SEF to a minimum five-day liquidation time, while permitting\n\nequivalent swaps that were executed on a DCM to be subject to a minimum one-day liquidation\n\ntime.” Id. at 69,366. After making this observation, the Commission summarized fourteen\n\ndifferent points raised by commenters about the potential negative effects of the venue-based\n\napproach. See id. at 69,366–67. Three of these fourteen points were that the venue-based\n\napproach would (1) “put SEFs at a competitive disadvantage to DCMs,” (2) “undermine the goal\n\nof the Dodd-Frank Act to promote trading of swaps on SEFs,” and (3) “potentially create\n\ndetrimental arbitrage between standardized swaps traded on a SEF and futures contracts with the\n\nsame terms and conditions traded on a DCM.” Id. at 69,366 (citing comment letters from GFI,\n\nMarketAxess, BlackRock, Tradeweb, FXall, and Nodal Exchange).\n\n       The Commission also observed that it received varying perspectives about the\n\nappropriate minimum liquidation times for swaps and futures. In this regard, the Commission\n\nstated that “[c]ommenters variously contended that a liquidation time of five business days may\n\nbe excessive for some swaps, a one-day liquidation period is too short, a one-day liquidation\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fperiod is appropriate for swaps executed on a DCM or a SEF, and a two-day liquidation period is\n\nappropriate for cleared swaps.” Id. at 69,367 (citations omitted). The Commission also noted\n\nthat two commenters “recommended that if the Commission were to mandate minimum\n\nliquidation times in the final rules, it should allow DCOs to apply for exemptions for specific\n\ngroups of swaps if market conditions prove that such minimum liquidation times are excessive.”\n\nId. (citing comments submitted by MFA and Citadel).\n\n       Following this summary of the multifarious commentary, the Commission concluded that\n\nit was “persuaded by the views expressed by numerous commenters that requiring different\n\nminimum liquidation times for cleared swaps that are executed on a DCM and equivalent cleared\n\nswaps that are executed on a SEF could have negative consequences.” Id. As a result, the\n\nCommission determined that a venue-based approach was inappropriate, and that “the same\n\nminimum liquidation time should be used with respect to cleared swaps that are executed\n\nbilaterally.” Id. Furthermore, the Commission “acknowledge[d] the concerns expressed by\n\ncommenters that a five-day liquidation period may be excessive for some swaps.” Id. In this\n\nregard, the Commission cited the fact that certain DCOs “have successfully cleared swaps based\n\non physical commodities using a one-day liquidation time,” while “several DCOs currently use a\n\nfive-day liquidation time in determining margin requirements for certain swaps based on\n\nfinancial instruments.”     Id.   According to the Commission, “[t]hese differences reflect\n\ndifferences in the risk characteristics of the products.” Id.\n\n       After “[w]eighing the advantages and drawbacks of the alternatives,” the Commission\n\nconcluded that “a bright-line requirement, with a provision for making exceptions, will best\n\nserve the public interest.” Id. In this regard, the Commission stated that “a DCO will still have\n\nconsiderable latitude in setting risk-based margin levels,” while at the same time, “establishing a\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fminimum liquidation time will provide legal certainty for an evolving marketplace, will offer a\n\npractical means for assuring that the thousands of different swaps that are going to be cleared . . .\n\nwill have prudent minimum margin requirements, and will prevent a potential ‘race to the\n\nbottom’ by competing DCOs.” Id. The Commission stated that the elimination of the venue-\n\nbased approach “addresses the competitive concerns raised by numerous commenters and\n\nrecognizes that once a swap is cleared, its risk profile is not affected by the method by which it\n\nwas executed.” Id. Furthermore, the Commission observed once again that the five-day/one-day\n\ndistinction between swaps based on physical commodities (i.e., agricultural commodities,\n\nenergy, and metals) and all other swaps was “based on the differing risk characteristics of these\n\nproduct groups and is consistent with existing requirements that reflect the risk assessments\n\nDCOs have made over the course of their experience clearing these types of swaps.” Id. The\n\nCommission specifically noted the existence of five-day liquidation times used by several DCOs\n\n(including LCH, CME, and ICE Clear Credit) for credit-default swaps and interest rate swaps,\n\nwhich, in the Commission’s view were “based on [the DCOs’] assessment of the higher risk\n\nassociated with these products.” Id. at 69,367–68. That higher risk assessment, in turn, was\n\nbased on several “[c]ontributing factors,” including (1) “a concentration of positions among\n\nclearing members,” (2) “the number and variety of products listed,” (3) “the complexity of the\n\nportfolios,” (4) “the long-dated expiration time for many swaps,” and (5) “the challenges of the\n\nliquidation process in the event of a default.” Id. at 69,368.\n\n       Finally, the Commission observed that “to provide further flexibility,” it was including an\n\nadministrative opt-out provision from the minimum liquidation times because “[a]s markets\n\nevolve, it may become appropriate to ease the requirement for certain swaps subject to the five-\n\nday minimum.” Id. Likewise, the Commission recognized that “analysis may reveal that for\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fother products or portfolios the five-day or one-day minimum is insufficient.” Id. In this regard,\n\nthe Commission specifically explained that “in light of the novelty, complexity, and potential\n\nmagnitude of the risk posed by financial swaps, prudential considerations dictate that this type of\n\n[upward] fine-tuning should be used in appropriate circumstances.” Id.\n\n                      b)      Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\n       In a later portion of the Final Rule, the Commission presented its considerations of the\n\ncosts and benefits associated with the minimum-liquidation-time regulation, as required by the\n\nCEA. See 7 U.S.C. § 19(a). Specifically, the CEA requires the Commission to consider five\n\nareas of market and public concern in its cost-benefit analysis, which include (1) protection of\n\nmarket participants and the public; (2) efficiency, competitiveness, and financial integrity of\n\nfutures markets; (3) price discovery; (4) sound risk management principles; and (5) other public\n\ninterest considerations. See id. The Commission discussed each area in turn.\n\n       Beginning with protection of market participants and the public, the Commission noted\n\nthat, on the cost-side “using only one criterion—i.e., the characteristic of the commodity\n\nunderlying a swap—to determine liquidation time could result in less-than-optimal margin\n\ncalculations.” Final Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,418. In this vein, the Commission elaborated that\n\n“[f]or some products, a five-day minimum may prove to be excessive and tie up more funds than\n\nare strictly necessary for risk management purposes,” and “[f]or other products, a one-day or\n\neven a five-day period may be insufficient.” Id. Despite acknowledging these potential costs,\n\nthe Commission “believe[d] that it [was] not feasible to estimate or quantify these costs\n\nreliably.” Id. The reason for this imprecision, the Commission explained, is that “margin\n\nrequirements for a particular instrument depend on a variety of characteristics of the instrument\n\nand the markets in which it is traded, including the risk characteristics of the instrument, its\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\fhistorical price volatility, and liquidity in the relevant market.” Id. Indeed, the Commission\n\nstated that “[d]etermining the risk characteristics, price volatility, and market liquidity of even a\n\nsample [of financial swaps] for purposes of determining a liquidation time specifically for such\n\nan instrument would be a formidable task for the Commission to undertake and any results\n\nwould be subject to a range of uncertainty.” Id. 10 Due to “the absence of a reasonably feasible\n\nand reliable methodology . . . for the Commission to use in calculating the appropriate margin\n\nrequirements for swaps with either five-day or one-day liquidation times,” it was the\n\nCommission’s belief “that possible future circumstances surrounding margin levels are too\n\nspeculative and uncertain to be able to quantify or estimate the resulting costs to DCOs, clearing\n\nmembers, or the public from the rule with any precision or degree of magnitude.” Id. at 69,418–\n\n19.\n\n        As to the benefits of the Final Rule with regard to protection of market participants and\n\nthe public, the Commission stated that the five-day and one-day minimum liquidation times were\n\n“consistent with existing requirements” and “reflect the risk assessments DCOs have made.” Id.\n\nat 69,419. In the Commission’s opinion, the DCOs’ determination that “these are the appropriate\n\nstandards for these instruments” was “a reasonable and prudent judgment.” Id. At the same\n\ntime, however, the Commission stated that “[a] minimum standard is designed to prevent DCOs\n\nfrom competing by offering lower margin requirements than other DCOs and, as a result, taking\n\non more risk than is prudent.” Id. Related to this concern about a “race to the bottom,” see id. at\n\n69,367, the Commission was also “concerned that a DCO may misjudge the appropriate\n\nliquidation time frame because of limited experience with clearing and managing the risks of\n\n\n\n\n10\n Relatedly, the Commission observed that “[r]eliable data is not readily available for many swaps that prior to the\nDodd-Frank Act were executed on unregulated markets.” Final Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,418.\n\n                                                        19\n\ffinancial swaps” in particular. Id. at 69,419. In sum, prescribing minimum liquidation times was\n\nintended to “prevent DCOs from taking on too much risk.” Id.\n\n        In considering efficiency, competitiveness, and financial integrity, the Commission first\n\nnoted that the costs-side considerations were “similar” to the cost considerations related to\n\nprotection of market participants and the public. Id. On the benefits side, the Commission stated\n\nthat a minimum-liquidation-time rule would “promote efficiency, competitiveness and financial\n\nintegrity” for several reasons. Id. Principally, the Commission repeated its belief that, by setting\n\na floor for liquidation times, “a DCO will still have considerable latitude in setting risk-based\n\nmargin levels,” while at the same time there would be “legal certainty for an evolving\n\nmarketplace.” Id. The Commission also found that minimum liquidation times would “offer a\n\npractical means for assuring that the thousands of different swaps that are going to be cleared\n\nsubject to the Commission’s oversight will have prudent minimum margin requirements.” Id. In\n\nthis regard, the Commission repeated that minimum liquidation times would “help prevent a\n\npotential ‘race to the bottom’ by competing DCOs” and would channel competition among\n\nDCOs “to other areas such as level of service.” Id. Finally, the Commission acknowledged the\n\n“significant, adverse effect” that would accompany the default of either a DCO clearing member\n\nor, “[i]n a worst case scenario,” a DCO itself, “which could have serious and widespread\n\nconsequences for the U.S. financial markets.” Id. Minimum liquidation times were, according\n\nto the Commission, intended to avoid such a calamitous market event, which the Commission\n\nviewed as a significant, albeit unquantifiable, benefit. Id. 11\n\n\n\n\n11\n   As to the other statutory cost-benefit considerations, the Commission stated that it “[did] not believe that this\n[minimum-liquidation-time] rule will have a material effect on price discovery,” and “[b]ecause the rule simply\nestablishes minimums, it will not hinder the exercise of sound risk management,” but rather would “foster sound risk\nmanagement practices.” Final Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,419.\n\n                                                        20\n\f                       c)        Dissenting Views\n\n       Two Commissioners—Jill Sommers and Scott O’Malia—appended statements to the\n\nFinal Rule that were critical of certain aspects of the Commission’s rulemaking. Commissioner\n\nSommers opined that “the rules are needlessly prescriptive, internally inconsistent, and depart\n\nfrom the Commission’s time-tested principles-based oversight regime.” Final Rule, 76 Fed. Reg.\n\nat 69,473. On that same token, Commissioner Sommers believed that the Commission had\n\nprovided “little to no explanation of the costs and benefits of doing so, or even a rationale other\n\nthan an overarching belief that prescriptive rules will increase legal certainty and prevent a race\n\nto the bottom by competing clearinghouses.” Id. With particular regard to the Commission’s\n\nminimum-liquidation-time rule, Commissioner Sommers declared that it “defie[d] common\n\nsense.” Id. at 69,474. Commissioner Sommers took issue with the fact that, in her view, “[t]he\n\nCommission gives no reason for its belief that there may be a race to the bottom if we do not\n\nestablish this less than ideal methodology,” and the Commission also did not “acknowledge the\n\nexistence of other safeguards in the rules that give us strong tools for policing a potential race to\n\nthe bottom.” Id. Disagreeing with the Commission’s interpretation of its statutory mandate,\n\nCommissioner Sommers did not believe “that Congress intended for the Commission to strip\n\nDCOs of the flexibility to determine the manner in which they comply with core principles”\n\nbecause “there is no reason to believe that [DCOs] will not continue to use their expert judgment\n\nin a responsible fashion.” Id.\n\n       Commissioner O’Malia also submitted extensive comments on the Final Rule, which\n\ntook issue with the Commission’s reasoning and approach.            Like Commissioner Sommers,\n\nCommissioner O’Malia felt that “this rulemaking abandons the principle-based regulatory\n\nregime which permitted DCOs to perform so admirably in the 2008 financial crisis.” Id. Writing\n\n\n\n                                                    21\n\fin general terms, Commissioner O’Malia also predicted that “[c]ertain provisions” might\n\n“discourage market participants from executing transactions subject to mandatory clearing, even\n\nif they need such transactions to prudently hedge risks, or from clearing on a voluntary basis”\n\nbecause such provisions “may impose substantial costs without corresponding benefits.” Id.\n\n         In addition to these general comments, Commissioner O’Malia leveled several criticisms\n\nagainst the minimum-liquidation-time rule specifically. First, he wrote that “the rulemaking\n\ncreates the impression that these requirements are arbitrary” because, although the Commission\n\n“characterizes these requirements as ‘prudent,’ it sets forth no justification for this\n\ncharacterization.”       Id. at 69,476–77.          Specifically, Commissioner O’Malia criticized the\n\nCommission for telling DCOs to consider five factors in establishing minimum liquidation times,\n\nwhen “[t]he final rulemaking presents no evidence that the Commission considered any of the\n\nfive factors in determining minimum liquidation times.” Id. at 69,477. 12 In Commissioner\n\nO’Malia’s view, this amounted to the Commission “holding DCOs to a higher standard than it\n\nholds itself.” Id.\n\n         Commissioner O’Malia went on to explain why he felt the Commission’s administrative\n\nopt-out provision would be insufficient. He wrote that “requiring market participants, during the\n\npendency of such a petition, to pay margin calculated using a five-day minimum liquidation time\n\nwould likely cause a substantial number of market participants to withdraw from the market,\n\nthereby chilling activity—perhaps irrevocably—in the contract.” Id. Commissioner O’Malia\n\nfurther worried that the costs to a DCM of preparing and filing such a petition, “when coupled\n\n\n\n\n12\n   These five factors included: (1) average daily trading volume; (2) average daily open interest in a product;\n(3) concentration of open interest; (4) availability of a predictable basis relationship with a highly liquid product;\nand (5) availability of multiple market participants in related markets to take on positions in the market in question.\nSee Final Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,368.\n\n                                                         22\n\fwith the possibility that the Commission may deny such a petition, would likely deter a DCM\n\nfrom seeking to compete with an incumbent futures contract.” Id. 13\n\n        Notably, Commissioner O’Malia devoted a portion of his comments to discussing why\n\nthe minimum liquidation times were likely “to disrupt already established futures markets,” i.e.,\n\nDCMs. See id. He cited a proposed rule implementing DCM core principles, which would\n\n“prohibit a DCM from listing any contract for trading unless an average of 85 percent or greater\n\nof the total volume of such contract is traded on the centralized market, as calculated over a\n\ntwelve (12) month period.” Id. (citing 75 Fed. Reg. 80,616). 14 Commissioner O’Malia said that\n\nthis 85% requirement, juxtaposed with the minimum-liquidation-time rule, would mean that if a\n\nde-listed futures contract were converted to a swap, it would be required to comply with the five-\n\nday minimum liquidation time even though “nothing substantive about the contract[] change[s]\n\nother than [its] characterization.”          Id. 15   Such an effect, he said, would “ha[ve] severe\n\nimplications for competition” because “market participants generally execute new futures\n\ncontracts outside the DCM centralized market until the contracts attract sufficient liquidity,”\n\nwhich “may take years.” Id.\n\n\n\n13\n  On this point, Commissioner O’Malia predicted that “the Commission may take a long time to consider any DCO\npetition,” citing the fact that “the Commission took approximately two years to approve a petition to reduce the\nminimum liquidation time for certain contracts on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange from two days to one day.” Final\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,477. Because of this, Commissioner O’Malia suspected that “this power to petition the\nCommission for relief may be of little value to offset the likely stifling of competition.” Id.\n14\n  Neither this 85% threshold nor any of the other minimum centralized market trading requirements proposed for\nDCMs were adopted in the Commission’s final rule regarding DCM core principles. Instead, in that final rule the\nCommission stated that “additional time is appropriate before finalizing the proposed rules for Core Principle 9.”\nSee 77 Fed. Reg. at 36,643. Specifically, the Commission “plan[ned] and expect[ed] to take up the proposed rules\nunder [DCM] Core Principle 9 when it considers the final SEF rulemaking.” Id. The final SEF rulemaking, which\nwas published on June 4, 2013, contains no discussion of DCM Core Principle 9 or the 85% trading threshold, and\nno final rule regarding minimum centralized market trading requirements appears to have been published in the\nFederal Register.\n15\n   Commissioner O’Malia cited “information that [he had] received from one DCM,” indicating that the 85%\nthreshold rule “would force conversion of 628 futures and options contracts to swap contracts.” Final Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 69, 477.\n\n                                                        23\n\f        Next, Commissioner O’Malia questioned the Commission’s fears regarding a “race to the\n\nbottom” among DCOs. First, “[a]s a conceptual matter,” Commissioner O’Malia concluded that,\n\nsince the Commission “has not demonstrated that the minimum liquidation times that it has\n\ndecided to mandate are ‘prudent,’ it cannot demonstrate that the one-day or five-day period\n\nwould prevent a ‘race to the bottom.’” Id. at 69,478. Second, “[a]s an empirical matter,”\n\nCommissioner O’Malia pointed out that “the Commission must have decided that DCOs\n\ncurrently competing to clear interest rate swaps and credit default swaps have not entered into a\n\n‘race to the bottom,’ because the final rulemaking codifies the existing five-day minimum\n\nliquidation time that such competing DCOs voluntarily adopted.” Id. Finally, Commissioner\n\nO’Malia, like Commissioner Sommers, pointed to “more effective tools” that the Commission\n\nhas to prevent any potential “race to the bottom.” Id. 16\n\n        Finally, Commissioner O’Malia critiqued the Commission’s cost-benefit analysis,\n\ndeclaring “[w]e [c]an [d]o [b]etter.” Id. He made clear that his “primary concern” regarding the\n\nCommission’s cost-benefit analysis was “its failure to attempt meaningful quantification.” Id. at\n\n69,479. While acknowledging that meaningful quantification may sometimes be difficult or\n\nimpossible, Commissioner O’Malia stated that “[i]f the Commission truly cannot quantify the\n\ncosts in those instances, then that fact alone should cause the Commission to proceed with\n\ncaution if it is going to abandon the existing principles-based regime.” Id. One example\n\nCommissioner O’Malia found “puzzling, given the capabilities of the Risk Surveillance Group\n\n(‘RSG’) and the DCO Review Group (‘DRG’)” was the Commission’s professed inability to\n\n\n\n16\n   According to Commissioner O’Malia, these tools include (1) the requirement that DCOs determine the adequacy\nof their initial margin requirements on a daily basis; (2) the requirement that DCOs conduct back testing of their\ninitial margin requirements on a daily or monthly basis; (3) the requirement that DCOs stress test their default\nresources at least once a month and report the results of such stress testing to the Commission; and (4) the\nCommission’s ability to independently back test and stress test DCO initial margin requirements. See Final Rule, 76\nFed. Reg. at 69,478.\n\n                                                        24\n\fquantify the costs of the minimum-liquidation-time rule due to a lack of reliable data. Id.\n\nCommissioner O’Malia recognized that “certain swaps” may not have sufficient data to create\n\nreliable quantitative cost estimates, but he stressed that such estimates would be possible for\n\n“futures contracts currently listed on a DCM that will be converted to swap contracts under the\n\npending DCM proposal.” Id. In the end, Commissioner O’Malia believed that “any attempt,\n\neven an imperfect one, undertaken by the Commission to understand the cost of our rulemakings\n\nor to justify our policy decisions is better than no attempt at all.” Id.\n\n               4.      The Mandatory Clearing Rule and the Plaintiff’s Efforts to Obtain\n                       Administrative Relief\n\n       The Commission’s Final Rule regarding minimum liquidation times went into effect on\n\nJanuary 9, 2012. See Final Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,334. On August 7, 2012, the Commission\n\npublished a NPRM for another rule, which would also affect the trading of swaps. That NPRM\n\nproposed, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 2(h), that certain categories of swaps would be required to be\n\ncleared by a DCO. See Clearing Requirement Determination Under Section 2(h) of the CEA, 77\n\nFed. Reg. 47,170 (proposed Aug. 7, 2012). The mandatory clearing NPRM proposed requiring\n\nclearing for four specified classes of interest-rate swaps and two specified classes of credit-\n\ndefault swaps. See id. at 47,220–21. Related to this mandatory clearing rule, the Commission\n\nhad promulgated a final rule on July 30, 2012, which laid out a compliance schedule for any\n\nmandatory clearing rules passed pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 2(h). See Swap Transaction Compliance\n\nand Implementation Schedule: Clearing Requirement Under Section 2(h) of the CEA, 77 Fed.\n\nReg. 44,441 (July 30, 2012) (codified at 17 C.F.R. pt. 50). That schedule was “based on the type\n\nof market participants entering into a swap subject to the Clearing Requirement,” and in\n\nparticular it divided market participants into three categories, which correlated to how soon they\n\nwould need to comply with any clearing rules: Category 1 Entities, Category 2 Entities, and all\n\n\n                                                  25\n\fother market participants. See id. at 44,442. Category 1 Entities would have to comply with\n\nclearing requirements within 90 days, Category 2 entities would have to comply with clearing\n\nrequirements within 180 days, and all other market participants would have to comply with\n\nclearing requirements within 270 days. See id.; see also17 C.F.R. § 50.25 (codifying compliance\n\nschedule).\n\n       On December 13, 2012, the Commission published a final rule regarding the categories\n\nof swaps that would be required to be cleared pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 2(h).        See Clearing\n\nRequirement Determination Under Section 2(h) of the CEA, 77 Fed. Reg. 74,284 (Dec. 13,\n\n2012) (codified at 17 C.F.R. pts. 39 and 50).        That final rule specified exactly the same\n\ncategories of swaps that the NPRM had specified, see id. at 74,336–37, and it stated, in\n\naccordance with the compliance schedule passed in July 2012, that “the compliance schedule for\n\nthis first clearing requirement will commence on March 11, 2013” for Category 1 Entities, id. at\n\n74,289. Similarly in line with the July 2012 compliance schedule, the December 13, 2012\n\nmandatory clearing rule stated that “Category 2 Entities must comply with the clearing\n\nrequirement by June 10, 2013.” Id. at 74,289 n.52.\n\n       A month and a half after this clearing requirement was published—and over fourteen\n\nmonths after the minimum-liquidation-time rule was published—the plaintiff sent a letter to the\n\nCommission, which raised “a serious concern . . . with the [Final Rule], and more specifically,\n\nwith regulation 39.13(g)(ii) [sic] which sets out the minimum liquidation time for financial\n\nfutures and financial swaps.” See Def.’s Mot. for Extension of Time Ex. 1 (“January Bloomberg\n\nLetter”) at 1, ECF No. 16-1. The plaintiff was interested in the Final Rule because it “operates\n\nthe BLOOMBERG PROFESSIONAL® service, a leading privately held electronic service that,\n\namong other things, facilitates the trading and processing of swaps [OTC].” Compl. ¶ 10, ECF\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\fNo. 1. 17 Bloomberg generates revenue from its swap trading platform by charging a monthly fee\n\nto those who subscribe to its BLOOMBERG PROFESSIONAL® service (also known as\n\n“Bloomberg terminals”), and thus Bloomberg does not generate revenue on a per-trade basis.\n\nSee Decl. of Benjamin P. Macdonald (“Macdonald Decl.”) ¶ 6, ECF No. 13-3. In addition,\n\nBloomberg “intends to operate a SEF in order to facilitate trading in the swaps market” and, to\n\nthat end, “has already created a subsidiary that will operate the SEF, has drafted a rulebook for\n\nthat SEF . . ., and has taken substantial steps toward creating the technological infrastructure for\n\noperating the SEF.” Compl. ¶ 11.\n\n        In its January 30, 2013 letter to the Commission, Bloomberg raised a number of\n\nobjections to the minimum-liquidation-time rule, most of which focused on the so-called\n\n“futurization of swaps.” See January Bloomberg Letter at 1. Futurization, according to the\n\nplaintiff, refers to “a phenomenon by which futures products are designed to mimic the essential\n\ncharacteristics of a swap.” Pl.’s Mem. at 1. More specifically, a swap can be “futurized” by\n\n“preassembling strips of futures contracts with aggregate cash flows that resemble swaps with\n\nthe same size, tenor, and reset characteristics.” Id. at 5 (citing Brown-Hruska Decl. ¶ 16). The\n\nresulting financial product is often referred to as a “swap future.” See id. Bloomberg contended\n\nin its January 30, 2013 letter that the Commission’s minimum-liquidation-time rule “on its face\n\nwill be the strongest driver of the forced ‘futurization’ of economically equivalent financial\n\nswaps.” January Bloomberg Letter at 2.\n\n        A major premise of this concern was that so-called “swap futures” have “the same risk\n\ncharacteristics as a swap,” id. at 1, and thus, by the plaintiff’s logic “[e]ither the swap executed\n\non a SEF or futures exchange is being ‘over-margined’ by a factor of five, or the futures contract\n\n17\n   Bloomberg’s “core business,” however, is “the delivery of analytics and data on approximately five million\nfinancial instruments, as well as news on every publicly traded company through the BLOOMBERG\nPROFESSIONAL ® service, television, radio, websites, mobile applications, and magazines.” Compl. ¶ 10.\n\n                                                     27\n\fexecuted on a futures exchange is being ‘under-margined’ by a factor of five,” id. at 3. The\n\nplaintiff was concerned that this scenario “could lead to clearinghouses absorbing more risk than\n\nthey otherwise would have if they were permitted to margin cleared financial products that are\n\neconomically equivalent using an appropriate risk-based metric regardless of the formal label\n\ngiven to the product.”    Id.   Bloomberg closed its letter by writing that “[f]ortunately, the\n\nCommission recognized that these markets are novel and complex, and consequently, reserved\n\nthe right, by order, to ‘establish shorter or longer liquidation times for particular products or\n\nportfolios.’” Id. Since Bloomberg believed “futurization” generally was “exactly the type of\n\nsituation the Commission had in mind when it approved this language,” Bloomberg “formally\n\nrequest[ed] that the Commission adopt an order that requires DCOs to impose the same margin\n\nrequirements for financial swaps as they impose on financial futures that are economically\n\nequivalent and have a comparable risk profile.” Id.\n\n       On March 11, 2013, Bloomberg sent a second letter to the Commission—this time\n\nthrough counsel—which laid out its objections to the minimum-liquidation-time rule in more\n\ndetail and stated for the first time that the Final Rule “threatens significant adverse effects for\n\nBloomberg” that would be “irreversible.” See Def.’s Mot. for Extension of Time Ex. 2 (“March\n\n11 Bloomberg Letter”) at 1, 11, ECF No. 16-2. In its March 11, 2013 letter Bloomberg also\n\nsought more far-reaching relief from the Commission, requesting “that the Commission promptly\n\ntake all steps necessary to stay the five-day minimum liquidation period for financial swaps, so\n\nthat the same one-day minimum period applies to all cleared swaps and futures.” Id. at 11. Two\n\ndays later, on March 13, 2013, Ananda Radhakrishnan, the Commission’s Director of the\n\nDivision of Clearing and Risk, responded by letter to Bloomberg. See Def.’s Mot. for Extension\n\nof Time Ex. 3 (“March CFTC Letter”), ECF No. 16-3. In that letter, Mr. Radhakrishnan stated\n\n\n\n                                                28\n\fthat Bloomberg’s January and March 2013 letters “have been referred to the Division of Clearing\n\nand Risk for consideration.” Id. at 1. After explaining the Commission’s rationale for adopting\n\nthe minimum-liquidation-time rule, Mr. Radhakrishnan concluded that Bloomberg’s requests\n\n“will be given prompt and careful consideration,” though “[t]o assist the Commission staff in\n\nconsidering them,” Mr. Radhakrishnan requested that Bloomberg “provide any data, studies, or\n\nother supporting information” by March 29, 2013. Id. at 3.\n\n       In response to the Commission’s request, Bloomberg sent a third letter, through counsel,\n\nto the Commission on March 29, 2013, which attached “two sets of data for each trading day in\n\nFebruary 2013.” See Def.’s Mot. for Extension of Time Ex. 4 (“March 29 Bloomberg Letter”) at\n\n1, ECF No. 16-4. Those data sets were “transaction-by-transaction” lists of (1) index credit-\n\ndefault swap transactions; and (2) interest-rate swap transactions, in which “at least one party to\n\nthe swap [was] a registered swap dealer or major swap participant.” Id. This data, Bloomberg\n\ncontended, “illustrate[] that there is deep and consistent liquidity in markets for some index\n\ncredit default swaps and interest-rate swaps.” Id. From this conclusion, Bloomberg argued that\n\n“such swaps could easily be liquidated in less than five days, indeed, often in less than a single\n\nday.” Id. at 1–2. Bloomberg also focused on three specific financial swaps, which it believed\n\ndemonstrated enough liquidity to warrant a minimum liquidation time of less than five days. Id.\n\nat 2. Bloomberg concluded by stating that, since it had not received a response to its March 11,\n\n2013 letter by March 19, 2013, as requested, it had “proceeded with preparing a federal court\n\ncomplaint, which [it] expect[ed] to file shortly.” Id.\n\n       Bloomberg filed its Complaint in the instant action eighteen days later on April 16, 2013,\n\nwhich the Court will discuss in more detail below. After filing its Complaint, the plaintiff\n\npursued the final step in its quest for administrative relief, which was to file with the\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\fCommission, on April 24, 2013, a formal motion to stay the portion of the Final Rule\n\nestablishing minimum liquidation times.           See Def.’s Mot. for Extension of Time Ex. 5\n\n(“Bloomberg Mot. to Stay”), ECF No. 16-5; see also id. at 2 (“Bloomberg hereby renews and\n\nformalizes its prior request that the Commission stay Rule 39.13(g)(2)(ii), pending the resolution\n\nof Bloomberg’s newly-filed challenge against that Rule . . . .”). In its formal motion to stay,\n\nBloomberg requested a response “by no later than 5:00 PM, April 29, 2013, so that it promptly\n\nmay seek such judicial relief as is necessary.” Id. (emphasis omitted). 18\n\n        The day after Bloomberg filed its formal motion to stay the minimum-liquidation-time\n\nrule, on April 25, 2013, the Commission sent a letter responding to the data submitted by\n\nBloomberg in its March 29 letter. See Def.’s Mot. for Extension of Time Ex. 6 (“April CFTC\n\nLetter”), ECF No. 16-6. In that letter, Mr. Radhakrishnan stated that the Division of Clearing\n\nand Risk had “identified a number of questions which require further data and analysis” before\n\nthe Commission could come to a conclusion regarding Bloomberg’s request to stay the five-day\n\nminimum liquidation rule. See id. at 1. In particular, Mr. Radhakrishnan asked for clarification\n\nabout whether Bloomberg was still seeking a waiver of the five-day minimum for “all cleared\n\nswaps and futures,” as stated in the March 11, 2013 letter, or whether that request was now\n\nlimited to the three specific types of swaps discussed in Bloomberg’s March 29, 2013 letter. See\n\nid. Also, after asking several questions about liquidity, default management, and complexity and\n\nconcentration of positions, Mr. Radhakrishnan noted that “no DCO has requested that the\n\nCommission issue an order reducing [the five-day] requirement for any product.” Id. at 3. As a\n\nresult, Mr. Radhakrishnan asked that Bloomberg “[p]lease identify any DCO that you believe\n\nwould accept your client’s products for clearing on the basis of margin calculated using less than\n\n\n18\n On May 17, 2013, the Commission issued an order denying Bloomberg’s motion to stay. See Notice of Agency\nAction, ECF No. 22.\n\n                                                    30\n\fa five-day liquidation period and state the basis for your belief.” Id. The Court is not aware of\n\nany response by Bloomberg to this query.\n\n               5.      The Plaintiff’s Lawsuit\n\n       As referenced above, the plaintiff filed its Complaint in this action on April 16, 2013.\n\nThe plaintiff’s Complaint contains four counts, one under the CEA and the APA, two under only\n\nthe APA, and one separate count for injunctive relief. See Compl.¶¶ 66–89. In its first count, the\n\nplaintiff alleges that, in promulgating the Final Rule, the Commission only provided “superficial\n\ndiscussion of the Rule’s costs and benefits,” in violation of 7 U.S.C. § 19(a)(2). See id. ¶¶ 67–\n\n68. In its second and third counts, the plaintiff alleges that the Commission violated the APA by\n\nfailing to give “fair notice of various aspects of Rule 39.13(g)(2)(ii),” id. ¶ 74, and by\n\npromulgating a minimum-liquidation-time rule that “was arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not\n\nin accordance with law,” id. ¶ 83. Finally, the plaintiff alleged in its fourth count that it would\n\n“be irreparably injured by the further implementation of Rule 39.13(g)(2)(ii),” and therefore it\n\nalleged that it was “entitled to injunctive relief under 5 U.S.C. § 702.” Id. ¶¶ 85, 89.\n\n       On May 2, 2013, the plaintiff filed an application for a preliminary injunction that would\n\n“stay[] 17 C.F.R. § 39.13(g)(2)(ii) . . . to the extent that the Rule provides minimum liquidation\n\ntimes that are longer for financial swaps than for futures contracts.” See Pl.’s Appl. for Prelim.\n\nInj. at 1, ECF No. 13. The plaintiff further requested “expedited briefing and consideration” of\n\nits application because it would “incur significant, irreversible injury if a preliminary injunction\n\nis not entered before the commencement of the CFTC’s ‘Phase 2’ clearing mandate on June 10,\n\n2013.” Id. (emphasis omitted). That application became ripe on May 21, 2013, and the Court\n\nheld oral argument regarding the application on May 31, 2013. Currently pending before the\n\nCourt is the plaintiff’s Application for a Preliminary Injunction, and for the reasons discussed\n\nbelow the Court concludes that (1) the plaintiff lacks standing to assert its claims; and, relatedly\n                                                 31\n\f(2) the plaintiff has not demonstrated that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm absent\n\npreliminary injunctive relief.\n\nII.

First, the\n\nplaintiff must have suffered an “injury in fact,” i.e., “an invasion of a legally protected interest\n\nwhich is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or\n\nhypothetical.” Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Second, there must be “a\n\ncausal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of,” i.e., the injury alleged\n\nmust be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant. Id. Finally, it must be likely\n\nthat the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Id. at 561. Moreover, when a plaintiff\n\nseeks prospective declaratory or injunctive relief, allegations of past harms are insufficient. See,\n\ne.g., Dearth v.

Before delving into\n\nthe specific elements, however, there are two overarching principles that apply to the standing\n\ninquiry in this case. First, this case involves purported “standing to challenge a [regulation]\n\nwhere the direct cause of injury is the independent action of . . . third part[ies].”                       Renal\n\nPhysicians Ass’n v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186957\"><a href=\"/opinion/186957/renal-physn-assn-v-hhs/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1269 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2007). As will be discussed below, however, “courts [only] occasionally find the elements of\n\nstanding to be satisfied in cases challenging government action on the basis of third-party\n\nconduct.” Nat’l Wrestling Coaches Ass’n v. Dep’t of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">930</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 940 (D.C. Cir. 2004).\n\n        Second, and relatedly, the regulation challenged by the plaintiff does not regulate the\n\nplaintiff directly; rather, it regulates DCOs. As the Supreme Court has made clear, “[w]hen . . . a\n\nplaintiff’s asserted injury arises from the government’s allegedly unlawful regulation (or lack of\n\nregulation) of someone else, much more is needed.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562 (emphasis in\n\noriginal). In that circumstance, “it becomes the burden of the plaintiff to adduce facts showing\n\nthat . . . choices [of the independent actors] have been or will be made in such a manner as to\n\nproduce causation and permit redressability of injury.” Id.; see also id. (“[W]hen the plaintiff is\n\nnot himself the object of the government action or inaction he challenges, standing is not\n\nprecluded, but it is ordinarily ‘substantially more difficult’ to establish.” (quoting Allen, 468 U.S.\n\nat 758)); see also Renal Physicians, 489 F.3d at 1273 (noting “the heightened showing required\n\nof a plaintiff alleging injury from the government’s regulation of a third party”). 19\n\n\n19\n  In its reply brief, Bloomberg confidently asserts that it “is an object of the government action because the Rule\nregulates market activity that occurs on Bloomberg’s systems: that is, swap trading platforms on which swaps are\n\n                                                        35\n\f         There are “two categories of cases where standing exists to challenge government action\n\nthough the direct cause of injury is the action of a third party.” Renal Physicians, 489 F.3d at\n\n1275. “First, a federal court may find that a party has standing to challenge government action\n\nthat permits or authorizes third-party conduct that would otherwise be illegal in the absence of\n\nthe Government’s action.” National Wrestling Coaches, 366 F.3d at 940. Second, standing has\n\nbeen found “where the record present[s] substantial evidence of a causal relationship between the\n\ngovernment policy and the third-party conduct, leaving little doubt as to causation and likelihood\n\nof redress.” Id. at 941.\n\n                  1.       Injury in Fact\n\n         With the context of the plaintiff’s standing framed thusly, the Court will begin by\n\ndiscussing whether the plaintiff has established an injury-in-fact. As discussed above, to satisfy\n\nthe requirements of Article III, a plaintiff’s injury must be both “concrete and particularized” and\n\n“actual or imminent,” and may not be “conjectural or hypothetical.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). “While the burden of production to establish standing is\n\nmore relaxed at the pleading stage than at summary judgment, a plaintiff must nonetheless allege\n\n‘general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s conduct’ (notwithstanding\n\n‘the court presumes that general allegations embrace the specific facts that are necessary to\n\nsupport the claim’).” Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"618639\"><a href=\"/opinion/618639/national-assn-of-home-builders-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2011)\n\n\n\ntraded.” See Reply Mem. in Supp. Pl.’s Appl. for Prelim. Inj. (“Pl.’s Reply”) at 20 n.9, ECF No. 23 (emphasis in\noriginal). This argument simply does not wash. The imposition of minimum liquidation times regulates the process\nof clearing a derivative, not the process of trading (or “executing”) a derivative—two separate market activities that,\nthough related, are performed by separate regulated entities (DCMs/SEFs and DCOs, respectively). In fact, the\nplaintiff touts the fact that “[s]wap counterparties that execute their trades on SEFs will be able to choose the DCO\nat which they clear.” Pl.’s Mem. at 8 (emphasis added); accord Brown-Hruska Decl. ¶ 18 (noting that “swaps\ntrading platforms, including SEFs, will likely connect to multiple DCOs, which will clear swaps at the DCO that has\nbeen requested by the swap counterparties,” while “[s]wap futures, on the other hand, can only be executed on a\nDCM and cleared through its affiliated DCO”). Thus, Bloomberg is no more the object of the Commission’s\nminimum-liquidation-time rule than an automobile dealer is the object of a law imposing minimum car insurance\nrequirements on automobile owners.\n\n                                                         36\n\f(quoting Sierra Club v.

The plaintiff’s burden of\n\nestablishing injury in this case is, as discussed above, “heightened” because Bloomberg is\n\n“alleging injury from the government’s regulation of a third party.” Renal Physicians, 489 F.3d\n\nat 1273.\n\n       Bloomberg contends that “[i]t will lose millions of dollars in business as a direct result of\n\nthe Rule’s discriminatory treatment of financial swaps and financial futures,” and this “[l]oss of\n\npotential revenue satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement.” Reply Mem. in Supp. Pl.’s Appl. for\n\nPrelim. Inj. (“Pl.’s Reply”) at 20, ECF No. 23 (citing Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Norton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185891\"><a href=\"/opinion/185891/fund-animals-v-norton-gale/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">728</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 733 (D.C. Cir. 2003)). The plaintiff is certainly correct that a loss of revenue, particularly\n\none amounting to “millions of dollars” could satisfy Article III’s requirement of injury-in-fact.\n\nDespite Bloomberg’s matter-of-fact statement that “[i]t will lose” money, see id. (emphasis\n\nadded), the plaintiff has failed to establish that such a loss is “actual or imminent,” as opposed to\n\n“conjectural or hypothetical.” See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (internal quotation marks omitted). To\n\nbetter understand why the plaintiff’s purported future injury is “hopelessly conjectural,”\n\nDeutsche Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2157865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4, a closer examination of the plaintiff’s theory of\n\nstanding is necessary.\n\n       First, to be clear, the plaintiff does not allege that it has yet suffered any injury as a result\n\nof the Final Rule. Rather, the plaintiff fears that, because swaps cannot be cleared with lower\n\nthan a five-day liquidation time, but swap futures can be cleared with as low as a one-day\n\nliquidation time, once “Phase 2” clearing begins on June 10, 2013, DCOs will set lower\n\nliquidation times for swap futures, traded on competitor DCMs, than for the swaps traded on\n\n\n\n                                                  37\n\fBloomberg’s trading platform. See Pl.’s Mem. at 18; Pl.’s Reply at 20–21; Compl. ¶ 61 (alleging\n\nthat the Rule “will result in more favorable margin treatment for the ‘swap futures’ contract than\n\nfor the functionally comparable financial swap that has not been ‘futurized’ and remains subject\n\nto a five-day liquidation time”). The plaintiff does not allege, however, that any DCO has set\n\nliquidation times for any swap futures contract lower than the liquidation times set for any\n\nfinancial swap, despite the fact that “Phase 1” mandatory swap clearing has been underway for\n\nnearly three months. See supra Part I.B.4 (explaining phasing-in of mandatory swap clearing\n\nrequirements). The plaintiff attempts to tie its injury to “Phase 2” swap clearing—set to begin on\n\nJune 10, 2013—because, when that phase of mandatory clearing begins “a large number of\n\nmarket participants who generally have not been clearing their swaps” and thus “are\n\nparticular[ly] sensitive to margin obligations” will be required to “clear[] many commonly-\n\ntraded interest rate swaps and credit default swaps.” Pl.’s Mem. at 18.\n\n       To summarize, the plaintiff’s chain of injury goes as follows: (1) at least some DCOs will\n\nset lower liquidation times for financial swap futures than for financial swaps; (2) this lower\n\nliquidation time will result in lower margin requirements for financial swap futures than for\n\nfinancial swaps; (3) margin-sensitive “Category 2” entities will trade financial swap futures on\n\nDCMs rather than trading financial swaps on Bloomberg’s trading platform; and, thus (4) at least\n\nsome Category 2 Entities will stop subscribing to Bloomberg’s trading platform, causing\n\nBloomberg to lose revenue. The actualization of this chain of events, however, depends on\n\nseveral assumptions about the behavior of third parties who are not before the Court. Most\n\nfundamentally, Bloomberg’s injury rises or falls with the behavior of third-party DCOs, who are\n\nthe entities actually regulated by the minimum-liquidation-time rule and are the ones who\n\nactually decide what liquidation times to set and how much margin to collect. Yet, inexplicably,\n\n\n\n                                               38\n\fBloomberg has not put forth a single factual allegation that any DCO has set or intends to set\n\nliquidation times for financial swap futures at a level lower than that set for financial swaps.\n\nInstead, Bloomberg (and its expert declarant) simply assume the worst-case scenario—DCOs\n\nwill set liquidation times for financial swap futures at the minimum of one day, and will set\n\nliquidation times for financial swaps at the minimum of five days—without grounding their\n\nassumption in the actual behavior of DCOs. See, e.g., Pl.’s Mem. at 18 (stating that “the 5-day\n\nliquidation period for a swap under the Rule would generate approximately 2.23 times the\n\nmargin held against futures subject to a 1-day period” (internal quotation marks omitted));\n\nBrown-Hruska Decl. ¶ 6 (“Because of the different minimum liquidation times created by the\n\nRule for margin calculation, the cost to market participants of holding futures positions will be\n\nlower than the cost of holding economically equivalent cleared swap positions.”); id. ¶ 38 (“[A]\n\nshorter margin liquidation period for interest rate swap futures would enable a 50% reduction in\n\nmargin compared to margin for cleared interest rate swaps.”).\n\n       Indeed, this Court is essentially picking up where the Commission left off in its April 25,\n\n2013 letter to Bloomberg, in which it asked the plaintiff to “[p]lease identify any DCO that you\n\nbelieve would accept your client’s products for clearing on the basis of margin calculated using\n\nless than a five-day liquidation period.” See April CFTC Letter at 3. The Court asked the\n\nplaintiff’s counsel essentially this exact same question at oral argument, to which he responded:\n\n“[T]here is no more powerful evidence that you can have than the [Commission]’s own\n\ninsistence that it would happen.” See Tr. of Prelim. Inj. Hr’g at 10:9–11 (May 31, 2013).\n\nBloomberg took this same position in its reply brief, contending that “[t]he entire premise of the\n\nRule’s 5-day mandatory minimum liquidation time for financial swaps is that, absent that\n\nrequirement, DCOs would ‘race’ to set liquidation times less than 5 days.” Pl.’s Reply at 21\n\n\n\n                                               39\n\f(emphasis omitted).        When pressed at oral argument on this point, however, Bloomberg’s\n\ncounsel conceded that “[w]e don’t have evidence on that point specifically,” i.e., whether DCOs\n\nare setting or intend to set liquidation times below five days for financial swap futures. See Tr.\n\nof Prelim. Inj. Hr’g at 11:24–25. Plaintiff’s counsel further conceded that, “if [liquidation times\n\nfor financial swap futures] would remain up at five [days], that certainly does go to the question\n\nwhether we have injury.” Id. at 12:5–7. 20 Despite these concessions, plaintiff’s counsel once\n\nagain pivoted back to the Commission’s rulemaking to argue that “it would be a little remarkable\n\nif the two parties were before the Court here expending the time and effort they have—are both\n\ndoing so with the belief that, in fact, there are no DCOs out there that will be below five [days\n\nfor financial swap futures].” Id. at 12:7–12.\n\n         To advance this argument, the plaintiff pointed, both in its brief and at oral argument, to\n\nthe D.C. Circuit’s decision in Stilwell v. Office of Thrift Supervision, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187439\"><a href=\"/opinion/187439/stilwell-v-office-of-thrift-supervision/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir.\n\n2009). See Pl.’s Reply at 21–22; Tr. of Prelim. Inj. Hr’g at 20:23–21:1, 76:17–21. That case\n\ninvolved a challenge to a regulation promulgated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (“OTS”),\n\nwhich permitted entities called “mutual holding companies” or “MHCs” to adopt a charter\n\nprovision for their subsidiaries that would “prohibit any person or entity from acquiring, or\n\noffering to acquire, more than 10% of the MHC subsidiary’s total minority stock within five\n\nyears after the minority stock issuance.” Stilwell, 569 F.3d at 516–17 (emphasis omitted). The\n20\n   It is telling that plaintiff’s counsel used the phrase “remain up at five [days].” Tr. of Prelim. Inj. Hr’g at 12:6\n(emphasis added). This made explicit what had previously been implicit: There are currently no DCOs that set\nliquidation times for financial swap futures below five days. Plaintiff’s counsel later asserted that “I believe it’s\nundisputed that there are lower margin requirements for swap futures currently.” Id. at 12:24–13:1. Plaintiff’s\ncounsel immediately clarified, however, that this assertion is based not on the margin requirements set by DCOs, but\nby marketing materials disseminated by DCMs, in which DCMs advertise lower margin requirements for financial\nswap futures than for financial swaps. See id. at 13:1–4 (referring to “advertising” from certain DCMs “saying, we\noffer lower margin, fifty percent lower”). These same marketing materials were cited in the plaintiff’s briefing. See\nPl.’s Mem. at 18–19. These materials are, however, merely wishful thinking and puffery on the part of DCMs\nhoping to lure customers away from competitor swap trading platforms, and they do not establish any injury-in-fact\non the part of Bloomberg because Bloomberg has not alleged that these marketing materials have resulted in (or will\nimminently result in): (1) margin requirements for financial swap futures that are actually lower than five days, let\nalone (2) customers leaving Bloomberg’s trading platform to trade on DCMs.\n\n                                                         40\n\fpurpose of this rule was to prevent activist minority shareholders in MHC subsidiaries from\n\nusing their leverage to “tak[e] advantage of voting rules that require a majority of the minority\n\nshareholders to approve management stock benefit plans.” See id. at 516.\n\n       The Court of Appeals concluded that an injury to the plaintiff—a prolific minority\n\nshareholder in MHC subsidiaries—was “substantially probable” because “[t]here [was] plainly a\n\nhigh—indeed, a near-certain—probability that at least some MHC subsidiaries selling minority\n\nstock to the public will adopt the optional provision limiting the size of any individual’s minority\n\nstake.” Id. at 518. The court’s conclusion in this regard was supported by two premises. First,\n\n“OTS proposed and ultimately adopted this new approach for this precise reason: to help solve\n\nthe perceived problems posed by activists like [the plaintiff] investing in MHC subsidiaries.” Id.\n\nSecond, and most importantly for purposes of the instant case, “[c]omments on the rule—\n\nincluding from representatives of the prominent bankers’ trade associations—supported the rule\n\non the same grounds.” Id. (citing three comment letters from bankers’ trade associations). The\n\ncourt even cited to an amicus curiae brief by the American Bankers Association, which noted\n\nthat “‘the outcome of this case will have a very real impact upon the ability of mutual\n\nassociations to defend themselves.’” Id.\n\n       Stilwell is both factually and legally distinguishable from the instant case with respect to\n\nstanding. Factually, the Stilwell court had before it numerous statements from the relevant third-\n\nparty market participants (mutual associations) stating essentially that they were likely to adopt\n\nthe optional charter provision “to defend themselves.” Id. (internal quotation mark omitted).\n\nLegally, the OTS had promulgated the optional charter provision “to help solve the perceived\n\nproblems posed by activists . . . investing in MHC subsidiaries.” Id. In fact, the Court of\n\nAppeals quoted with approval from the plaintiff’s brief to say that “‘it is more than a little ironic\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\fthat OTS would suggest Petitioners lack standing and then, later in the same brief, label\n\nPetitioner Stilwell as a prime example of one of the activist MHC shareholders who supposedly\n\nhave created the very problem the Rule was intended to address.’” Id.\n\n       The same cannot be said about the instant case. First, in this case, the “problem” being\n\naddressed by the five-day and one-day minimum liquidation times—a ruinous “race to the\n\nbottom” among DCOs—is, by all accounts, not currently taking place. A cursory glance at the\n\nrulemakings in the two cases demonstrates why this fact is important. In Stilwell, the OTS had\n\nstated in its NPRM that “OTS has recently become aware of several situations in which minority\n\nstockholders have acquired positions in the minority stock of Subsidiary Companies, and have\n\ntaken actions that appear intended to influence management to engage in stock repurchases or in\n\na sale of the institution.”    See Optional Charter Provisions in Mutual Holding Company\n\nStructures, 72 Fed. Reg. 35,205, 35,206 (proposed June 27, 2007) (emphasis added). In other\n\nwords, the “problem” addressed by the agency in Stilwell was already occurring. By contrast, in\n\nthe instant case, the Commission stated that in the Final Rule it was promulgating minimum\n\nliquidation times as a prophylactic measure to “prevent a potential ‘race to the bottom’ by\n\ncompeting DCOs.” See Final Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,367 (emphasis added). Second, the OTS\n\nregulation in Stilwell was intended to encourage MHC subsidiaries to take a certain action: adopt\n\nthe minority stakeholder provision. See Stilwell, 569 F.3d at 518. By contrast, in this case the\n\nCommission adopted minimum liquidation times to prevent third-parties from taking certain\n\nactions: setting minimum liquidation times too low. In other words, the minimum liquidation\n\ntimes in the instant case were not designed to encourage DCOs to adopt the bare minimum\n\nliquidation time for all transactions, as the plaintiff repeatedly assumes. In this way, the plaintiff\n\nmisreads the import of Stilwell’s reasoning: The plaintiff in Stilwell had standing because it was\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n\f“near-certain” that regulated third-parties would implement the solution provided by the agency,\n\nwhich would, in turn, cause the plaintiff harm. See id. That reasoning is inapposite in the instant\n\ncase because the third-party actions that would potentially harm the plaintiff—DCOs setting\n\ndifferential liquidation times for financial swap futures and financial swaps—is neither mandated\n\nnor encouraged by the Commission’s rule. 21\n\n         Due to the absence of any factual allegation that DCOs are setting or are imminently\n\nlikely to set liquidation times for financial swap futures at a level lower than that for financial\n\nswaps, the plaintiff cannot establish a “‘substantial probability’ of injury as a result of the rule.”\n\nStilwell, 569 F.3d at 518 (quoting St. John’s United Church of Christ v. FAA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187115\"><a href=\"/opinion/187115/st-johns-united-church-of-christ-v-faa/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 462\n\n(D.C.

Indeed, without the substantial probability of DCOs setting differential\n\nliquidation times for financial swaps and financial swap futures, the rest of the plaintiff’s theory\n\nof injury becomes utterly unsupportable.

Cir. 1993) (“A court is\n\nrightly reluctant to enter a judgment which may have no real consequence, depending upon the\n\nputative cost-benefit analysis of third parties over whom it has no jurisdiction and about whom it\n\nhas almost no information.”).           Therefore, this Court cannot conclude that the plaintiff has\n\nestablished a cognizable injury-in-fact under Article III.\n\n\n\n\n21\n   Indeed, even assuming the plaintiff is correct in its crucial premise that “financial swaps and futures often have\nindistinguishable economic characteristics and risk profiles,” Pl.’s Mem. at 1, it is telling that (1) no DCO has\nrequested the ability to clear financial swaps with lower than a five-day liquidation time, see Decl. of John Lawton\n¶ 34, ECF No. 21-1; and (2) there is no allegation that any DCO has cleared any financial swap future with less than\na five-day liquidation time.\n\n                                                         43\n\f               2.      Causation and Redressability\n\n       Even assuming that the plaintiff could establish an injury-in-fact, however, the plaintiff’s\n\ntheory of causation and redressability is also speculative and is thus also fundamentally\n\ninsufficient to establish standing. Once again, the plaintiff’s contentions in this regard are\n\nremarkably perfunctory and devoid of factual support. All that the plaintiff says in its reply brief\n\nabout causation and redressability is (1) “[t]he Rule’s discriminatory treatment of financial swaps\n\nand futures will cause market participants to shift their business to DCMs, thus causing\n\nPlaintiff’s injury,” and (2) “[t]his injury would be redressed by an order vacating the Rule’s\n\ndiscriminatory regime, which would close the regulatory arbitrage loophole that is the source of\n\nthe Plaintiff’s injury-in-fact.” Pl.’s Reply at 21 (emphasis omitted). The plaintiff makes these\n\nconclusory statements as if they are self-evident, but in doing so the plaintiff is counting its\n\nproverbial chickens before they are hatched.\n\n       At the outset, the plaintiff’s formulation of causation and redressability ignores the role of\n\nDCOs entirely. The plaintiff simply says that the minimum-liquidation-time rule, on its own,\n\n“will cause market participants to shift their business to DCMs,” id. (emphasis omitted), but that\n\nreasoning leaves out the critical intermediary behavior of DCOs who, it is worth once again\n\nnoting, are the entities who actually set the liquidation times for derivatives. The plaintiff has\n\nnot presented any factual allegation or even any theory of economics that would support the\n\nnotion that market participants (i.e., derivatives traders or their clients) would “shift their\n\nbusiness to DCMs” based solely on the existence of minimum liquidation times, as opposed to\n\nactual liquidation times set by DCOs. The plaintiff does not appear to contest the central role of\n\nDCOs; instead, Bloomberg simply chooses to ignore that role for purposes of standing.\n\n       The plaintiff also fails to address a long line of precedent from this Circuit and from the\n\nSupreme Court, which requires a plaintiff in Bloomberg’s position to allege facts that, if true,\n                                                44\n\fwould provide “‘formidable evidence’ of causation” or at least “substantial evidence of a causal\n\nrelationship between the government policy and the third-party conduct, leaving little doubt as to\n\ncausation and the likelihood of redress.” See National Wrestling Coaches, 366 F.3d at 941–42\n\n(emphasis omitted). On this point, the D.C. Circuit’s decision in National Wrestling Coaches is\n\ninstructive. There, plaintiffs challenged an interpretive rule promulgated by the Department of\n\nEducation, which laid out three ways in which the Department would assess whether educational\n\ninstitutions had complied with Department regulations that required such institutions to select\n\nsports and levels of competition to “effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of\n\nmembers of both sexes.’” See id. at 934–35 (quoting 45 C.F.R. § 86.41(c)(1) and 34 C.F.R.\n\n§ 106.41(c)(1)). That regulation had been promulgated pursuant to Title IX of the Education\n\nAmendments of 1972, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded\n\neducational programs and activities.        See id. at 934.      The plaintiffs were “membership\n\norganizations representing the interests of collegiate men’s wrestling coaches, athletes, and\n\nalumni,” and their asserted injuries arose “from decisions by educational institutions to eliminate\n\nor reduce the size of men’s wrestling programs to comply with the Department’s interpretive\n\nrules implementing Title IX.” Id. at 935. Thus, in National Wrestling Coaches, like in the\n\ninstant case, “the necessary elements of causation and redressability . . . hinge[d] on the\n\nindependent choices of . . . regulated third part[ies].” Id. at 938.\n\n       The D.C. Circuit found causation and redressability lacking in National Wrestling\n\nCoaches because “nothing but speculation suggests that schools would act any differently than\n\nthey do with the [challenged interpretive rule] in place” since “[s]chools would remain free to\n\neliminate or cap men’s wrestling teams and may in some circumstances feel compelled to do so\n\nto comply with the statute and the [previous Department] Regulations.” Id. at 940. Further, the\n\n\n\n                                                  45\n\fcourt found that “other reasons unrelated to the challenged legal requirements [e.g., moral\n\nconsiderations, budget constraints] may continue to motivate schools to take such actions.” Id.\n\nFrom this analysis, and a comprehensive review of the case law, the National Wrestling Coaches\n\ncourt concluded that “it is purely speculative whether a decision in appellants’ favor would alter\n\nthe process by which schools determine whether to field certain sports teams.” Id. at 944.\n\n        Similarly here, absent the minimum liquidation times, DCOs would “remain free” to set\n\nliquidation times for financial swaps at or above five days “and may in some circumstances feel\n\ncompelled to do so to comply with the statute and the [Commission’s other regulations].” Id. at\n\n940. Recall that DCOs, even absent the minimum-liquidation-time rule, would be obligated by\n\nlaw to set margin requirements that are “sufficient to cover potential exposures in normal market\n\nconditions.” 7 U.S.C. § 7a-1(c)(2)(D)(iv). Also similarly to National Wrestling Coaches, it is\n\nclear that “other reasons unrelated to the challenged [minimum liquidation times] may continue\n\nto motivate [DCOs] to take such actions.” See National Wrestling Coaches, 366 F.3d at 940.\n\nNamely, DCOs have significant skin in the game when it comes to setting margin requirements\n\nbecause they carry all counterparty risk when they clear derivatives. Given the fact that DCOs\n\nhave consistently elected, both before and after the promulgation of the Commission’s minimum\n\nliquidation times, to set liquidation times for financial swaps at or above five days, see, e.g.,\n\nFinal Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,367, 69,419, 22 it would be nothing more than speculation to\n\nconclude that this behavior would change absent the rule.\n\n\n\n22\n  This observation is further supported by the CFTC roundtable discussion that included numerous statements from\nDCOs about the appropriate margining of financial swaps. See, e.g., Tr. of Roundtable at 147:11–15 (statement of\nDCO president that “before there even were regulations that were propagated about any kind of margin coverage\nperiod minimum, we had already determined that the margin coverage period we were going to target for the credit\ndefault swaps and the interest rate swaps was five days”); id. at 176:12–13 (statement of DCO president that “[w]e\nhave been doing five days for swaps since 1999”). Therefore, it is perhaps no wonder that the plaintiff has not been\nable to allege that any DCO would set liquidation times for financial swaps below five days absent the challenged\nrule.\n\n                                                        46\n\f       The plaintiff’s only response to this is that the Commission has predicted a “race to the\n\nbottom” among DCOs, and this prediction is sufficient to conclude that DCOs’ behavior will\n\nchange if the minimum liquidation times were set aside. See, e.g., Pl.’s Reply at 10, 21–22. This\n\npoint, which pervades the plaintiff’s standing arguments, disregards the important and\n\nmeaningful difference between (1) the predictive judgments of an agency made to support a\n\nprophylactic regulation; and (2) the showing of a likelihood of redressability that is required by\n\nArticle III to establish standing. With regard to the latter, “[a]bstract theory and conjecture are\n\nnot enough to support standing.” National Wrestling Coaches, 366 F.3d at 944.              Instead,\n\nstanding requires a plaintiff to support its theory of injury, causation, and redressability with\n\nfacts (even if they are merely factual allegations). See, e.g., Sierra Club, 292 F.3d at 898. By\n\ncontrast, “[a]n agency’s predictive judgments about areas that are within the agency’s field of\n\ndiscretion and expertise are entitled to particularly deferential review, as long as they are\n\nreasonable, and need not rest on pure factual determinations.” EarthLink, Inc. v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186758\"><a href=\"/opinion/186758/earthlink-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the Commission\n\nitself recognized in the Final Rule that “possible future circumstances surrounding margin levels\n\nare too speculative and uncertain to be able to quantify or estimate the resulting costs . . . from\n\nthe rule with any precision or degree of magnitude.” Final Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 69,419. Thus,\n\nthe plaintiff’s heavy reliance on the Commission’s predictions to establish Bloomberg’s standing\n\nis fundamentally misplaced because those predictions are not held to the same standard as the\n\nfactual basis for a plaintiff’s standing to sue. It would not be “implausible to hypothesize” or\n\n“beyond the pale to assume” that DCOs might set liquidation times below five days for certain\n\nfinancial swap futures at some point, but hypotheses and assumptions are insufficient to establish\n\n\n\n\n                                                47\n\fstanding, see National Wrestling Coaches, 366 F.3d at 943–44, even if they are sufficient to\n\nsupport an agency’s predictive judgments.\n\n       Moreover, it is worth noting that the reasoning at the heart of National Wrestling\n\nCoaches is not unique and has been applied in numerous other cases from this Circuit and in the\n\nSupreme Court to conclude that a plaintiff lacks standing.

U.S. Department of Health & Human Services,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185520\"><a href=\"/opinion/185520/tozzi-v-hhs/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.

Cir. 1986)—the Court\n\nof Appeals found causation and redressability despite the fact that the challenged agency action\n\nregulated third parties not before the court. As the Circuit recognized in National Wrestling\n\nCoaches, however, both of those cases contained “records [that] presented substantial evidence\n\nof a causal relationship between the government policy and the third-party conduct, leaving little\n\ndoubt as to causation and the likelihood of redress.” National Wrestling Coaches, 366 F.3d at\n\n941. For example, in Tozzi, the plaintiffs—manufacturers of PVC plastic that contained a\n\n\n\n                                               48\n\fchemical called dioxin—challenged a decision by HHS to add dioxin to the category of “known”\n\ncarcinogens. See id. (discussing Tozzi). The court found standing based on the introduction of\n\n“affidavits and other record evidence demonstrating that municipalities and health care\n\norganizations opted to phase out their use of PVC plastic as a direct result of the Secretary’s\n\ndecision.” Id. (citing Tozzi, 271 F.3d at 308–09). Similarly, Block involved a challenge by a\n\ngroup of film distributors to a decision of the Department of Justice to classify certain films as\n\n“political propaganda.” See Block, 793 F.2d at 1306–07. The court concluded that the plaintiffs\n\nhad established causation and redressability based on “the recitation of instances in which\n\npotential customers declined to take the film because of the classification,” as well as “the\n\naffidavits of potential customers” stating that they would have purchased the films, but for the\n\ngovernment’s classification. Id. at 1308. It is precisely this sort of evidence about the conduct of\n\nrelevant third parties—whether presented through factual allegations or through sworn\n\ndeclarations—that is noticeably absent from this case.\n\n                                                       ***\n\n         As the foregoing discussion makes clear, the plaintiff has failed to establish any of the\n\nthree elements of the “irreducible constitutional minimum” for Article III standing. See Lujan,\n\n504 U.S. at 560. Therefore, the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over this dispute. 23\n\n\n\n23\n  The Commission also argues that the plaintiff lacks prudential standing. See Def.’s Opp’n at 18–20. There is a\ndebate within this Circuit about whether prudential standing is a jurisdictional issue. Compare Ass’n of Battery\nRecyclers, Inc. v. EPA, Nos. 12-1129, 12-1130, 12-1134, and 12-1135, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2302713</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6 (D.C.

Ass’n, 693 F.3d at 182 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (“[P]rudential standing is not jurisdictional,\nmeaning that it can be forfeited and need not be considered by the court if the defendant or respondent does not\nassert it.”). Whether or not prudential standing is jurisdictional, however, need not be addressed here because the\nCourt dismisses this case on the basis of Article III standing. Nevertheless, one argument raised by the plaintiff\nabout the standard that applies to the prudential standing inquiry prompts this Court to address briefly the\nappropriate standard when the question is whether the plaintiff is “arguably within the zone of interests to be\nprotected or regulated by the statute that he says was violated.” Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi\nIndians v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (2010) (Scalia, J., in chambers) (“If expenditures cannot be\nrecouped, the resulting loss may be irreparable.”), the plaintiff also posits a theory of irreparable harm based on a\n“network effect” among swap trading platforms, see, e.g., Pl.’s Mem. at 20–21, 39–41. A “network effect” is\npresent when the value of a product depends on the number of people who use it. This phenomenon is often present\nfor product “platforms” that are used to consume other products (e.g., computer operating systems, media standards,\nsocial networking websites). When a product must be consumed through a platform, the platform becomes more\nvaluable to consumers as more people use it. Once a platform develops a “critical mass” of participants in the\nmarket, a “tipping point” occurs, whereby that platform becomes entrenched as the “dominant” platform, and users\nof that platform become “locked in” to that platform, to the exclusion of other platforms. See Pl.’s Mem. at 21, 41–\n42. Although the plaintiff’s network effects theory need not be addressed in detail because the Court does not reach\nthe merits of the plaintiff’s Application for a Preliminary Injunction, this network effects theory appears dubious\nbecause, even assuming “futurization” occurs, that phenomenon would, ceteris paribus, only encourage the\ndeparture of customers who trade standardized, “plain vanilla” swaps, but would not similarly encourage the\ndeparture of those who trade customized, bespoke instruments. Due to this fact, and Bloomberg’s estimates\nregarding the number of subscribers it would lose due to futurization, it appears unlikely that futurization would\ncause a “tipping point” beyond which Bloomberg’s trading platform would become permanently damaged.\n\n                                                           50\n\fcome close to satisfying the “high standard for irreparable injury” within the preliminary\n\ninjunction inquiry.

As discussed above, the presence of the plaintiff’s injury is based\n\nentirely on a series of worst-case scenario assumptions that are anything but certain to occur.25\n\nFurthermore, although the plaintiff ties the imminence of its harm to the June 10, 2013\n\ncompliance date for mandatory swap clearing of Category 2 entities, this date appears to the\n\nCourt to be nothing more than a red herring. The plaintiff has not explained why this date has\n\nany significance to DCOs in setting margin levels. As the Court has repeatedly stressed, DCOs\n\nare the only actors who could set into motion the series of market events that would result in the\n\ninjury that Bloomberg fears. Yet the plaintiff has failed to explain why DCOs would suddenly\n\n\n25\n   The plaintiff’s primary piece of evidence accompanying its Application for Preliminary Injunction to support the\nmagnitude and certainty of its harm was a declaration authored by Benjamin P. Macdonald, who is Bloomberg’s\nHead of Core Product. See Macdonald Decl. ¶ 1. Although the Court will not divulge any of the particular numbers\nincluded in that declaration because they are sealed and highly confidential, the Court does observe that the\nestimates Mr. Macdonald provided in his declaration were based on speculative assumptions and contained several\nunexplained leaps from generalized characterizations about market trends to specific figures about lost revenues, as\nwell as mathematical errors. Following discussion at oral argument about the deficiencies in this declaration, the\nCourt permitted Bloomberg to supplement its evidence. Mr. Macdonald filed a supplementary declaration in which\nhe candidly admitted that all of his original calculations were backwards, stating: “The calculation [of users lost as a\nresult of the rule] in my initial declaration . . . mistakenly reported the users . . . that Bloomberg is expected to retain\nin spite of the Rule, rather than those it expected to lose as a direct result of the Rule.” See Supp. Decl. of Benjamin\nP. Macdonald ¶ 5, ECF No. 30-1 (emphasis in original). Such a glaring error, in combination with the speculative\nassumptions on which his conclusions were based, undermines the persuasiveness of Mr. Macdonald’s\nmethodology.\n\n                                                            51\n\fchange their margining practices with respect to financial swap futures and financial swaps\n\nsimply because a broader universe of entities will be required to clear their swaps. This sleight\n\nof hand by the plaintiff, like its arguments regarding standing, does not change the reality that,\n\nonce the plaintiff’s hyperbolic rhetoric is swept away, no facts are left to sustain the relief it\n\nseeks.\n\nIV.      CONCLUSION\n\n         As discussed above, the Court concludes that the plaintiff lacks standing to assert its\n\nclaims. As a result, the Court must dismiss this case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n         An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n         Date: June 7, 2013\n\n                                                       /s/ Beryl A. Howell\n                                                      BERYL A. HOWELL\n                                                      United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                                 52\n\f</pre>",
