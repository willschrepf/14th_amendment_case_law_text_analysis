In 1992,  he filed  a  pro se  civil rights\r                                                     ___ __\r<br>\r<br>            action  against various  Department of  Corrections personnel\r<br>\r<br>            and others,  seeking damages  and injunctive relief  under 42\r<br>\r<br>            U.S.C.     1983.    Among  other   things,  he  alleged  that\r<br>\r<br>            defendants had  violated his rights by  using excessive force\r<br>\r<br>            against him, seizing his legal materials, denying him medical\r<br>\r<br>            care, and threatening to confine him in a disciplinary  unit.\r<br>\r<br>            At  the  time  he filed  his  complaint,  DuPont  was in  the\r<br>\r<br>            Departmental Segregation Unit (DSU),  but he was later placed\r<br>\r<br>            in  the  Departmental  Disciplinary  Unit  (DDU),   where  he\r<br>\r<br>            remains.  \r<br>\r<br>                      In  this  appeal,  DuPont challenges  the  district\r<br>\r<br>            court's  denial of  his  request for  an injunction  ordering\r<br>\r<br>            compliance  with certain stipulations,  agreements, or orders\r<br>\r<br>            in  the following cases:   Cepulonis v.

For  the reasons outlined  below, we  find\r<br>\r<br>            that the  district  court  did  not overstep  its  bounds  in\r<br>\r<br>            denying the requested relief.\r<br>\r<br>                      Consent Decree  Violations.  In  part, DuPont seeks\r                      __________________________\r<br>\r<br>            orders enforcing federal or  state court consent decrees, but\r<br>\r<br>            such relief is unavailable  in an individual action  under 42\r<br>\r<br>            U.S.C.    1983.

DuPont also asserts  various\r                      ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            state law violations, e.g., that defendants have not properly\r<br>\r<br>            promulgated certain  DDU rules, did not  medically screen him\r<br>\r<br>            before  placing him in the DDU, and have not provided certain\r<br>\r<br>            law library  access, all  in violation  of state  statutes or\r<br>\r<br>            regulations.  But he does not explain how  defendants thereby\r<br>\r<br>            violated  federal law, and this court does not have the power\r<br>\r<br>            to  direct state  officials to  comply with  state law.   See\r                                                                      ___\r<br>\r<br>            Quintero de  Quintero v.

DuPont  complains that  defendants\r                      _____________\r<br>\r<br>            violated his right to court access by restricting his ability\r<br>\r<br>            to  conduct legal  research3 and  by seizing  legal materials\r                                       3\r<br>\r<br>            from his cell.  DuPont has clearly been able to challenge his\r<br>\r<br>            criminal conviction  and sentence  by filing a  direct appeal\r<br>\r<br>            and post-conviction motions in state court and  by filing two\r<br>\r<br>            habeas petitions (and appeals  from the dismissal thereof) in\r<br>\r<br>            federal  court.  He has also been  able to file and prosecute\r<br>\r<br>            this action  challenging the  conditions of  his confinement.\r<br>\r<br>            Nothing in the  record indicates that DuPont's  access to the\r<br>\r<br>            courts has not been adequate or meaningful.

See Lewis\r                                                                ___ _____\r<br>\r<br>            v. Casey, 116 S.

DuPont asserts that  defendants\r                      _________________\r<br>\r<br>            have violated his due process liberty interest in law library\r<br>\r<br>            access and in not being confined in  the DDU by their failure\r<br>\r<br>            to  comply with obligations imposed in the cases cited in the\r<br>\r<br>            beginning  of  this opinion.    Contrary  to DuPont's  claim,\r<br>\r<br>            however,  the  Alston  case  did not  require  defendants  to\r                           ______\r<br>\r<br>            prepare and  evaluate a  health status report  before placing\r<br>\r<br>            him in  the DDU, which is located at Cedar Junction as is the\r<br>\r<br>            DSU  where he  was previously  housed.   Alston requires  the\r                                                     ______\r<br>\r<br>            preparation and  review of health status  reports only before\r<br>\r<br>            an   inmate  is   transferred   to   an  entirely   different\r<br>\r<br>            institution.

It\r<br>\r<br>            requires that all inmates have  supervised access to the  law\r<br>\r<br>            library  unless  \"special  circumstances\" dictate  otherwise.\r<br>\r<br>            Such circumstances may well encompass DuPont's confinement in\r<br>\r<br>            the DDU.  \r<br>\r<br>                      DuPont v.

Finally, while the  DDU may have effectively replaced\r<br>\r<br>            the DSU at Cedar Junction, Commissioner Dubois testified in a\r<br>\r<br>            deposition in a different case (which is in the record before\r<br>\r<br>            us) that he did not establish the DDU in order to evade legal\r<br>\r<br>            obligations applicable to the DSU.  \r<br>\r<br>                      In  his  objections  to  the  magistrate's  report,\r<br>\r<br>            DuPont raised an argument  based on Sandin v.

DuPont   asserts  that\r<br>\r<br>            confinement  in  the  DDU  is  an  atypical  and  significant\r<br>\r<br>            deprivation, giving him a  due process liberty interest under\r<br>\r<br>            Sandin,  which defendants violated  when they put  him in the\r            ______\r<br>\r<br>            DDU.

DuPont\r<br>\r<br>            was placed in a strip cell due to  intransigence sufficiently\r<br>\r<br>            serious  to require the use  of chemical agents.

DuPont  was\r<br>\r<br>            given  his mail and permitted to  write letters after leaving\r<br>\r<br>            the strip cell.  His confinement was also relatively short in\r<br>\r<br>            duration, lasting  11  days or  less.   The  restriction  was\r<br>\r<br>            content  neutral,  applying  to  all  incoming  and  outgoing\r<br>\r<br>            correspondence.

DuPont has clearly been able to challenge his\r<br>\r<br>            criminal conviction  and sentence  by filing a  direct appeal\r<br>\r<br>            and post-conviction motions in state court and  by filing two\r<br>\r<br>            habeas petitions (and appeals  from the dismissal thereof) in\r<br>\r<br>            federal  court.

DuPont asserts that  defendants\r                      _________________\r<br>\r<br>            have violated his due process liberty interest in law library\r<br>\r<br>            access and in not being confined in  the DDU by their failure\r<br>\r<br>            to  comply with obligations imposed in the cases cited in the\r<br>\r<br>            beginning  of  this opinion.    Contrary  to DuPont's  claim,\r<br>\r<br>            however,  the  Alston  case  did not  require  defendants  to\r                           ______\r<br>\r<br>            prepare and  evaluate a  health status report  before placing\r<br>\r<br>            him in  the DDU, which is located at Cedar Junction as is the\r<br>\r<br>            DSU  where he  was previously  housed.   Alston requires  the\r                                                     ______\r<br>\r<br>            preparation and  review of health status  reports only before\r<br>\r<br>            an   inmate  is   transferred   to   an  entirely   different\r<br>\r<br>            institution.   Likewise, Stone does not  clearly grant DuPont\r                                     _____\r<br>\r<br>            the  right  to physically  use the  prison  law library.   It\r<br>\r<br>            requires that all inmates have  supervised access to the  law\r<br>\r<br>            library  unless  \"special  circumstances\" dictate  otherwise.\r<br>\r<br>            Such circumstances may well encompass DuPont's confinement in\r<br>\r<br>            the DDU.  \r<br>\r<br>                      DuPont v.

Finally, while the  DDU may have effectively replaced\r<br>\r<br>            the DSU at Cedar Junction, Commissioner Dubois testified in a\r<br>\r<br>            deposition in a different case (which is in the record before\r<br>\r<br>            us) that he did not establish the DDU in order to evade legal\r<br>\r<br>            obligations applicable to the DSU.  \r<br>\r<br>                      In  his  objections  to  the  magistrate's  report,\r<br>\r<br>            DuPont raised an argument  based on Sandin v.

DuPont   asserts  that\r<br>\r<br>            confinement  in  the  DDU  is  an  atypical  and  significant\r<br>\r<br>            deprivation, giving him a  due process liberty interest under\r<br>\r<br>            Sandin,  which defendants violated  when they put  him in the\r            ______\r<br>\r<br>            DDU.    The  present   record  does  not  contain  sufficient\r<br>\r<br>            information to permit  evaluation of this  claim.4  For  that\r                                                             4\r<br>\r<br>            reason, a remand to consider the Sandin claim makes no sense.\r                                             ______\r<br>\r<br>            Accordingly,  we affirm the denials below on the basis of the\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>               4We  note, too, that DuPont  has asked us  to send certain\r               4\r<br>            materials on file  in this  court which are  relevant to  his\r<br>            Sandin claim to the district court, a request which we hereby\r            ______\r<br>            grant.

Moreover, the\r<br>\r<br>            withdrawal  of mail  privileges  was temporary.   DuPont  was\r<br>\r<br>            given  his mail and permitted to  write letters after leaving\r<br>\r<br>            the strip cell.

The record indicates\r<br>\r<br>            that chemical agents and/or forced move teams  have been used\r<br>\r<br>            against DuPont some 14 times in that time period after he has\r<br>\r<br>            refused to obey orders or rules.  He may be  able to convince\r<br>\r<br>            a  jury that excessive force was used against him on February\r<br>\r<br>            14,  1994, as he asserts,  but that injury  could be remedied\r<br>\r<br>            through a damages award.

On practically  all  other\r<br>\r<br>            occasions when chemical agents  were used against him, DuPont\r<br>\r<br>            reported no injuries and medical personnel observed none.  On\r<br>\r<br>            a few occasions, he  reported old or minor injuries.   Prison\r<br>\r<br>            officials  sought medical authorization before using chemical\r<br>\r<br>            agents  on DuPont  and his  eyes and  face were  washed after\r<br>\r<br>            their use.

Even\r<br>\r<br>            assuming that  the conditions he describes  were sufficiently\r<br>\r<br>            serious deprivations to establish a constitutional violation,\r<br>\r<br>            DuPont  has  not  shown  facts  to  indicate that  any  named\r<br>\r<br>            defendant knew  of and disregarded  an excessive risk  to his\r<br>\r<br>            safety.  Thus,  he has  not shown  the requisite  \"deliberate\r<br>\r<br>            indifference\"  to warrant  any relief,  at  this time,  on an\r<br>\r<br>            Eighth  Amendment claim.
