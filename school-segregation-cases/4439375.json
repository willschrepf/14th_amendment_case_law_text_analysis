Issue One: To establish a prima facie case of selective\n         prosecution in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth\n         Amendments, and to obtain a hearing under the “presumption of\n         prosecutorial vindictiveness” method, a defendant must provide\n         “some evidence” that shows: (1) the government singled out the\n         defendant for prosecution and has not proceeded against others\n         similarly situated based on the type of conduct for which the\n         defendant is charged; and (2) the government’s discriminatory\n         selection is invidious. Once the defendant makes this showing,\n         the burden shifts to the State to justify the discriminatory\n         treatment.\n          Appellee asks this Court to clarify what constitutes “some\n          evidence” and hold that so long as a defendant attaches a proffer\n          of evidence to a motion to dismiss due to prosecutorial\n          misconduct, the trial court in its discretion determines to present\n          a colorable claim of a constitutional violation, the defendant has\n          attached “some evidence,” and the trial court should have the\n          discretion to conduct a hearing on the motion to dismiss.\n          Appellee also asks this Court to find that Appellee not only\n          attached “some evidence” showing a constitutional violation, but\n          in fact attached “exceptionally clear evidence.”\n          Finally, Appellee asks this Court to find that the Court of Appeals\n          erred when it: (1) sustained the State’s second issue and\n          concluded that Appellee “did not make the proper showing\n          sufficient to establish a prima facie case...” of the fact that the\n          former elected district attorney of Dallas County engaged in\n          prosecutorial misconduct by allowing himself to be corruptly\n          influenced by a political ally in return for indicting Appellee; (2)\n          found that the trial court erred in conducting a hearing on\n          Appellee’s motion to dismiss based upon prosecutorial\n          misconduct; (3) vacated the trial court’s Order Granting Motion\n          to Dismiss; and (4) remanded the case to the trial court to\n          reinstate the indictments against Appellee. ...................................................42 \n\n\n                                                               5\n\fi.      Introduction – so long as the prosecution is not for an\n        improper purpose, prosecutors have the discretion to\n        prosecute ..............................................................................................42 \nii.     To raise a “presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness,”\n        a defendant must present evidence of circumstances that\n        pose a “realistic likelihood” of misconduct. When the\n        defendant does so, the defendant makes a prima facie case.\n        The burden then shifts to the State to rebut this\n        presumption or face dismissal of the charges .....................................49 \niii.    The majority opinion’s characterization of the evidence\n        attached to the Motion to Dismiss is inaccurate. Nearly all\n        of the evidence proffered by Appellee and attached to the\n        Motion to Dismiss: (1) would be admissible in a hearing\n        without further authentication; and (2) constitutes\n        “exceptionally clear” evidence that the decision to\n        prosecute was for an improper purpose, exceeding the\n        standard that the trial court must, in its discretion, find\n        “some evidence” of a colorable claim of a constitutional\n        violation ...............................................................................................51 \niv.     “Some evidence” means that a defendant must attach to\n        the motion to dismiss evidence that establishes that the\n        defendant has a colorable claim of a constitutional\n        violation. This allows the trial court to exercise its\n        discretion in ordering the hearing. Once a hearing is held,\n        the defendant must show by “exceptionally clear\n        evidence” that the prosecution was initiated for an\n        improper reason. ..................................................................................58 \nv.      No appellate court in Texas has ever ruled that a trial court\n        erred in conducting a hearing on a defendant’s motion to\n        dismiss charges on the basis they violated his\n        constitutional rights. ............................................................................67 \nvi.     Texas public policy benefits if trial courts are allowed\n        discretion to determine whether a defendant has made the\n        threshold showing of a colorable claim that the defendant\n        is entitled to a hearing .........................................................................68 \nvii.    Most other courts have adopted standards substantially\n        similar to the standard that Appellee argues this Court\n        should adopt: that so long as a defendant attaches a proffer\n                                                   6\n\f                 of evidence to a motion to dismiss due to prosecutorial\n                 misconduct that the trial court in its discretion determines\n                 to present a colorable claim of a constitutional violation,\n                 the defendant has attached “some evidence,” and the trial\n                 court should have the discretion to conduct a hearing on\n                 the motion to dismiss...........................................................................71 \n        viii.  This Court should affirm the trial court’s order dismissing\n               the indictments because the evidence obtained during the\n               March 7, 2013 hearing overwhelmingly proved that: (1)\n               Watkins singled out Appellee for prosecution and has not\n               proceeded against others similarly situated based on the\n               type of conduct for which Appellee was charged; and (2)\n               Watkins’s discriminatory selection was invidious and\n               resulted from allowing himself to be improperly\n               influenced by Blue...............................................................................76 \n        ix.      Conclusion ...........................................................................................76 \nXI.     Conclusion and Prayer ...................................................................................78 \nXII.  Certificate of Service .....................................................................................80 \nXIII.  Certificate of Compliance with Tex.

Appendix Index\n\nAppendix 1: State v. Hill, 05-13-00421-CR-180, 05-13-00423-CR-180, 05-13-\n00424-CR-180, and 05-13-00425-CR-180, 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835 (Tex.\nApp. Dallas, December 29, 2014) (Bridges, J. dissenting) (unpublished opinion)\n\n\n\n\n                                     11\n\fTo The Honorable Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals:\n\n      Appellee Albert G. Hill, III respectfully submits this opening brief:\n\n\nV. Statement of the Case and Procedural History\n\n      Appellee asks that this Court review the judgment and opinion of the Fifth\n\nCourt of Appeals in State v. Hill, 05-13-00421-CR-180, 05-13-00423-CR-180, 05-\n\n13-00424-CR-180, and 05-13-00425-CR-180, 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835 (Tex.\n\nApp. Dallas, December 29, 2014) (Bridges, J. dissenting) (unpublished opinion).\n\n(See Appendix 1). The issues presented in this case appear to be of first impression\n\nin Texas. Appellee found no other case in which a defendant proffered “some\n\nevidence” – much less “exceptionally clear evidence” as proffered in this case –\n\nshowing that in exchange for indicting the defendant, a prosecutor was improperly\n\ninfluenced by a person to the extent that the defendant’s constitutional rights were\n\nviolated.   Here, this person, who was at the time of indictment involved in civil\n\nlitigation with the defendant, improperly influenced the prosecutor. When that\n\nperson and the prosecutor refused to answer any questions at a hearing that the trial\n\ncourt had the discretion to order, the trial court made an adverse inference, and\n\ndismissed the indictments due to prosecutorial misconduct. But, the Court of\n\nAppeals reversed the trial judge’s ruling on the basis that the defendant did not\n\nproffer enough evidence to even warrant a hearing.\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f       The procedural history is as follows: on March 31, 2011, four indictments\n\nwere returned against Appellee, alleging violations of Texas Penal Code § 32.32,\n\nFalse Statement to Obtain Credit: that on or about May 14, 2009, with the intent of\n\nobtaining a loan of money, the aggregate value of which was $200,000.00 or more,\n\nAppellee made certain materially false and misleading written statements to\n\nOmniAmerican Bank by: (1) claiming that he and his wife, Erin Hill, “were only\n\nowners of real property located at 4433 Bordeaux, Highland Park, Dallas County,\n\nTexas...” (F11-00180/05-13-00421-CR) (CR-180, 6, 427);1 (2) claiming that his\n\ngross monthly income was $54,341.00 (F11-00182/05-13-00423-CR) (CR-180,\n\n428); (3) executing certain documents “by deception” by creating and executing the\n\ndocuments and by creating and confirming by words and conduct false impressions\n\nof facts that were “likely to affect the judgment of OmniAmerican...” that Appellee\n\ndid not believe to be true (F11-00183/05-13-00423-CR) (CR-180, 429); and (4) that\n\nhis Inwood National Bank account contained $102,174.00 (F11-00191/05-13-\n\n00424-CR) (CR-180, 430). See Tex. Pen. Code § 32.32 (2009).\n\n       After conducting his own investigation, Appellee uncovered compelling\n\ncircumstantial evidence that Lisa Blue, a Democratic Party operative and attorney –\n\n\n1\n The Clerk’s Record (three unsealed and two sealed volumes, three supplemental volumes, and a\nsupplemental sealed volume) is cited as “CR” followed by the last three digits of the cause number\nfor the three volumes (or “-Supp-Aug02”), followed by the page number. The Reporter’s Record\n(five volumes) is cited as “RR” following by the volume number and page number, or the exhibit\nnumber of the exhibits volume (RR5) followed by the “PDF” page number of RR5.\n\n\n                                               13\n\fwho at the time was involved in civil litigation against Appellee over a fee dispute –\n\ncorruptly influenced then-Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins\n\n(“Watkins”),2 who in turn authorized obtaining the four indictments against\n\nAppellee. Appellee filed a Motion to Quash and Dismiss the Indictment Due to\n\nProsecutorial Misconduct (“Motion to Dismiss”). (CR-180, 31-488). The Motion to\n\nDismiss alleged that Appellee’s constitutional rights to due process and equal\n\nprotection were violated due to Blue’s corruptly influencing Watkins, and as a result,\n\nAppellee was: (1) selectively prosecuted; (2) vindictively prosecuted; and\n\n(3) deprived of his right to a disinterested prosecutor. (CR-180, 32-67). At the time\n\nthat the indictments were returned against Appellee, Blue and Appellee were\n\nembroiled in a fee dispute litigation before the United States District Court, Northern\n\nDistrict of Texas, in which Blue was seeking over $50 million. (RR2, 20-21; CR-\n\n180, 32-34).\n\n       Based on the evidenced proffered by Appellee that was attached to the Motion\n\nto Dismiss, on February 14, 2013, the trial court found that Appellee was entitled to\n\na hearing. (RR2, 28). The trial court required Appellee to first question Blue. (RR2,\n\n28-30).    After Blue invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\n\n\n\n\n2\n On November 4, 2014, Watkins was the only democrat to lose a county-wide election in Dallas\nCounty. See Susan Hawk ousts Craig Watkins in heated race for Dallas County DA,\nhttp://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/local-politics/20141105-susan-hawk-ousts-craig-\nwatkins-in-heated-race-for-dallas-county-da.ece, last accessed on July 17, 2015.\n                                             14\n\fincrimination, which prevented Appellee from obtaining the information by other\n\nmeans, Appellee was permitted to call Watkins as a witness. (RR2, 47-49). The\n\ntrial court ordered an evidentiary hearing on the limited question of Blue’s influence\n\non Watkins’s decision to pursue indictments against Appellee, so that the scope of\n\nAppellee’s questioning of Watkins would be limited to Watkins’s conversations with\n\nBlue. (RR2, 27-28, 47-49). The questioning of Watkins did not take place during\n\nthe February 14, 2013 hearing because Watkins claimed through counsel that\n\nalthough he was in the courthouse, he suddenly became “ill” and thus could not\n\ntestify. (RR2, 54-64).\n\n       Arguing that Appellee was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing, the State\n\nsought mandamus relief and a stay of the hearing from the Fifth Court of Appeals of\n\nDallas and from this Court.3 The State’s petitions for writs of mandamus were\n\ndenied. On March 7, 2013, the evidentiary hearing was held. (RR3).\n\n       During the evidentiary hearing on March 7, 2013, the State admitted that the\n\nhome-equity loan (which was the subject of the indictments) was never in arrears,\n\nhad been fully repaid before the commencement of any criminal investigation, and\n\nthat the indictments against Appellee are “unprecedented.” (RR4, 49, 126, 129,\n\n\n\n\n3\n Appellee asks this Court to take judicial notice of the fact that on March 1, 2013, the State filed\nfor mandamus relief in the Fifth Court of Appeals in Cause Numbers 05-13-00298-CV, 05-13-\n00299-CV, 05-13-00300-CV, 05-13-00301-CV, and 05-13-00302-CV; and again on March 6,\n2013 in this Court in Cause Number WR-79,189-01.\n                                                15\n\f155). Watkins made a blanket assertion of privilege and work product protection,\n\nand refused to answer any questions. (RR4, 15-17). The trial court overruled\n\nWatkins’s objections, and further found that the State had waived privilege with\n\nrespect to the issues before the court. (RR4, 16-17).\n\n      After Watkins refused to testify, Appellee examined several assistant district\n\nattorneys. (RR4, 34-189). After this testimony, the trial court gave Watkins another\n\nopportunity to testify, and he again refused. (RR4, 195).\n\n      The trial court found that Watkins’s refusal to testify denied Appellee “his\n\nright to have a meaningful hearing” on his Motion to Dismiss. (RR4, 219). The trial\n\ncourt also found that the State failed to rebut Appellee’s prima facie showing of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct. (RR4, 219).\n\n      On March 7, 2013, the 204th District Court dismissed with prejudice (“Order\n\nGranting Motion to Dismiss”) the four indictments against Appellee under cause\n\nnumbers F11-00180, F11-00182, F11-00183, and F11-00191. (RR4, 219; CR-180,\n\n1100; CR-182, 978; CR-183, 977; CR-191, 894).\n\n      The State appealed the Order Granting Motion to Dismiss to the Court of\n\nAppeals. The State raised four issues. The second issue raised by the State was\n\n“Whether the trial court abused its discretion by granting Appellee an evidentiary\n\nhearing—and then dismissing the indictments—where the facts he alleged failed to\n\nestablish any constitutional violation.” See Hill, 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835.\n\n\n                                         16\n\f         On December 29, 2014, the Court of Appeals: (1) sustained the State’s second\n\nissue and concluded that Appellee “did not make the proper showing sufficient to\n\nestablish a prima facie case...” of the fact that the former elected district attorney of\n\nDallas County engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by allowing himself to be\n\ncorruptly influenced by a political ally in return for indicting Appellee; (2) found\n\nthat the trial court erred in conducting a hearing on Appellee’s motion to dismiss\n\nbased upon prosecutorial misconduct; (3) vacated the trial court’s March 7, 2013\n\norder granting Appellee’s motion to dismiss; and (4) remanded the case to the trial\n\ncourt to reinstate the indictments against Appellee. Hill, id. at *36-38.\n\n         On February 23, 2015, Appellee filed a petition for discretionary review,\n\nwhich was granted on June 10, 2015. Appellee now presents the following Opening\n\nBrief.\n\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fVI. Statement Regarding Oral Argument\n\n      Oral argument has been allowed, and Appellee requests oral argument. See\n\nTex. Rule App. Proc. 68.4(c) (2015). As explained in the petition for discretionary\n\nreview, and provided in greater detail below, the issues presented in this petition\n\nmay be issues of first impression. As a result, Appellee believes that this Court’s\n\ndecisional process will be significantly aided by oral argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fVII. Issues Presented\n\nIssue One: To establish a prima facie case of selective prosecution in violation of\nthe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and to obtain a hearing under the\n“presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness” method, a defendant must provide\n“some evidence” that shows: (1) the government singled out the defendant for\nprosecution and has not proceeded against others similarly situated based on the type\nof conduct for which the defendant is charged; and (2) the government’s\ndiscriminatory selection is invidious. Once the defendant makes this showing, the\nburden shifts to the State to justify the discriminatory treatment.\n\nAppellee asks this Court to clarify what constitutes “some evidence” and hold that\nso long as a defendant attaches a proffer of evidence to a motion to dismiss due to\nprosecutorial misconduct, the trial court in its discretion determines to present a\ncolorable claim of a constitutional violation, the defendant has attached “some\nevidence,” and the trial court should have the discretion to conduct a hearing on the\nmotion to dismiss. Appellee also asks this Court to find that Appellee not only\nattached “some evidence” showing a constitutional violation, but in fact attached\n“exceptionally clear evidence.”\n\nFinally, Appellee asks this Court to find that the Court of Appeals erred when it: (1)\nsustained the State’s second issue and concluded that Appellee “did not make the\nproper showing sufficient to establish a prima facie case...” of the fact that the former\nelected district attorney of Dallas County engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by\nallowing himself to be corruptly influenced by a political ally in return for indicting\nAppellee; (2) found that the trial court erred in conducting a hearing on Appellee’s\nmotion to dismiss based upon prosecutorial misconduct; (3) vacated the trial court’s\nOrder Granting Motion to Dismiss; and (4) remanded the case to the trial court to\nreinstate the indictments against Appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\fVIII. Facts\n\n      1.    Watkins’s “investigation” of Appellee\n      On February 18, 2010, in a civil case in which Appellee and his father (Hill\n\nJr.) were opposing parties, a United States district judge signed an order finding that\n\nHill Jr.: (1) submitted summary judgment materials in bad faith and with the intent\n\nof committing fraud on the Court, and (2) lied under oath. (RR5, DX-1, 100). The\n\nfederal judge also found that Hill Jr.’s attorney had “far exceeded the bounds of\n\nadvocacy, permissible or otherwise.” (RR5, DF-PT-3, 100).\n\n      Days later, on February 22, 2010, alleging that Appellee had committed\n\nmortgage fraud in connection with a home equity loan he had obtained from\n\nOmniAmerican, Hill Jr.’s attorney submitted a written complaint to Donna\n\nStrittmatter, head of the Specialized Crime Division of the Dallas County District\n\nAttorney’s Office. (RR4, 75-76; RR5, SX-1, 8-66). Hill Jr. alleged that Appellee\n\nmisrepresented his ownership interest in his primary residence that was used as\n\ncollateral for the loan because at the time, the residence had been 80% owned by a\n\ntrust of which both Appellee and Hill Jr. are beneficiaries. (RR4, 87-88; RR5, SX-\n\n1, 8).     Strittmatter and assistant district attorney Stephanie Martin obtained\n\npermission to conduct an investigation of this allegation from First Assistant District\n\nAttorney Terri Moore. (RR4, 44-45).\n\n      Blue claims that in May 2010, while she was representing Appellee, in\n\nresponse to a story in D Magazine suggesting that the District Attorney’s Office was\n                                          20\n\finvestigating Appellee and his wife concerning the loan from OmniAmerican, Blue\n\nmet with Moore. (RR4, 46-47; CR-180, 854-855; CR-182, 178; CR-183, 178; CR-\n\n191, 177). In an effort to persuade the District Attorney’s Office to abandon its\n\ninvestigation of Appellee, Blue presented Moore with a copy of the federal court\n\norder that found that Hill Jr. committed perjury. (RR4, 46-47; RR5, DX-1, 97-103.\n\nMoore did not confirm or deny whether the office was investigating Appellee. (RR4,\n\n47:11–13).     However, after meeting with Blue, Moore provided Martin and\n\nStrittmatter a copy of the federal court order and told them that Hill Jr. could not be\n\nused as a witness in the State’s case. (RR4, 48).\n\n      2.     Fee dispute between Blue and Appellee\n      On July 7, 2010, after: (1) Appellee rejected a $30 million fee for Blue and\n\ntwo other attorneys associated with her (Aldous and Malouf), and (2) United States\n\nMagistrate Judge Paul Stickney rejected the fee recommendation, Blue filed a\n\nmotion to withdraw from representing Appellee in the federal civil case, and became\n\nAppellee’s adversary in a civil fee dispute. (CR-180, 678-682; CR-182, 586-587;\n\nCR-183, 585-586).\n\n      Shortly after the global settlement agreement and final judgment were entered\n\nin the federal civil proceeding between Appellee and Hill Jr., on December 7, 2010,\n\nBlue and her associated attorneys filed a complaint in federal court against Appellee\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fand his wife, seeking to recover over $50 million on the settlement. (RR5, DX-1,\n\n117-123, 139, 408).\n\n     3.   Trustee for Hill Jr.’s trust contacts Martin\n     On September 8, 2010, about seven months after Hill Jr.’s attorney submitted\n\nthe complaint to the District Attorney’s Office, the trustee for the Hill Jr. trust,\n\ncontacted Martin by phone and in writing, urging Martin to pursue indictments\n\nagainst Appellee and his wife. (RR4, 145-147). Martin’s handwritten notes reflect\n\nthat she told Mr. Pickett that OmniAmerican “...really isn’t interested in\n\nprosecuting,” and that she “didn’t see how [she] could prove his criminal case,”\n\nespecially since the “victim” (OmniAmerican) suffered no harm and did not want to\n\nprosecute. (RR4, 183-185, 201; RR5, DX-8; 1084). After her discussion with\n\nPickett, Moore directed Martin to move forward with the investigation. (RR4, 186-\n\n187, 191; RR5, DX-8, 1084).\n\n     4.   Communications between Blue and Watkins during the lead-up to\n          the indictments\n     On January 7, 2011, about one month after filing the $50-million-plus fee\n\ndispute suit against Appellee, Blue met with Watkins. (RR5, DX-4, 1075-1076).\n\n     On or about January 12, 2011, Martin conducted a “pitch session” regarding\n\nthe investigation against Appellee and his wife, to determine whether the State\n\nshould seek indictments against Appellee and his wife. (RR4, 35-36, 120-125, 166).\n\nWatkins, Moore, and Strittmatter all attended the pitch session, during which\n\n                                        22\n\fWatkins asked a number of questions, gave his opinion regarding the real estate title\n\nissues at the center of the allegations against Appellee and his wife, and even\n\nsuggested additional charges Martin should consider bringing against Appellee and\n\nhis wife. (RR4, 163:3–7, 163:15–165:19).\n\n     A few days later, on January 15, 2011, Blue again met with Watkins. (RR5,\n\nDX-4, 1025).\n\n     Two days later, on January 17, 2011, Blue and associated attorneys entered\n\ninto a written agreement with Appellee and his wife to litigate the fee dispute in\n\nfederal court in early April 2011. (RR5, DX-1, 141-144).\n\n     On January 20, 2011, three days later, Blue met Watkins for dinner, which was\n\npaid for by Blue. (RR5, DX-3; DX-4, 1019, 1077-1078).\n\n     The next morning, on January 21, 2011, Blue called Watkins at 10:51 a.m.\n\n(RR5, DX-1, 386, 426). Watkins returned Blue’s call at 10:54 a.m., which was\n\nanswered by Blue in the presence of associated attorney Malouf. (RR5, DX-1, 395-\n\n397, 426). Under oath, Blue admitted that during this call, Watkins raised the topic\n\nof indicting Appellee and his wife, saying “there could be an indictment or are you\n\nstill interested in the indictments,” and Blue claims to have told Watkins that she\n\ncould not talk to him about Appellee and his wife. (RR5, DX-1, 171-174). However,\n\nBlue’s telephone records show she called Watkins back at 11:13 a.m. on the same\n\nday, and they had another conversation lasting six minutes. (RR5, 426).\n\n\n                                         23\n\f     Blue called Watkins several more times between March 3 and 10, 2011. (RR5,\n\nDX-1, 361-364, 426). Blue also met with Watkins on March 3, 2011 to take\n\npublicity photos in connection with a $100,000 donation Blue made to SMU Law\n\nSchool in 2010 in Watkins’s honor. (RR5, DX-3, DX-4, 995, 1025).\n\n     Despite the fact that Watkins was not running for office, and in fact in\n\nNovember 2010 had been reelected and would not face another election until 2014,\n\non March 9, 2011, Blue held a campaign fundraiser for Watkins at her home. (RR5,\n\nDX-4, 1031-1047, 1079-1080). Blue’s invitations encouraged the invitees to donate\n\nto Watkins because it was going to be a “tight race.” (RR5, DX-4, 1031-1047, 1079-\n\n1080). Blue personally contributed $5,000 to Watkins, and raised thousands of\n\ndollars from other donors. (RR5, DX-2, 872-890).\n\n     On March 22 and 24, 2011, Blue contacted Watkins while attending\n\ndepositions, including her own, in connection with the fee dispute with Appellee.\n\n(RR5, DX-1, 279-280, 301-302, DX-4, 157, 368-369, 377, 390-391, 426, 1025).\n\n     Without question, Watkins had the ultimate authority to determine whether\n\nAppellee and his wife would be indicted. (RR4, 43:10–14, 191:13–18). Watkins\n\nwas the final decision-maker, and the indictments would not have been presented to\n\nthe grand jury without his approval. (RR4, 166, 191).\n\n     Watkins approved the presentation of the case against Appellee and his wife\n\nto the grand jury. (RR4, 163, 166). As a result, on March 29, 2011, about two weeks\n\n\n                                        24\n\fbefore the fee trial between Appellee and Blue was set to begin, Martin presented\n\nthe case against Appellee and his wife to the grand jury. (RR4, 167; RR5, SX-4, 85-\n\n88). That same night, Watkins sought to meet Blue for drinks. (RR5, DX-3, DX-4,\n\n1012, 1025-1026). The following night, Watkins and Blue met for dinner at an\n\nupscale restaurant in Dallas. (RR5, DX-3, DX-4, 1012, 1025-1026, 1081-1082).\n\n     Blue admitted in her deposition in the fee dispute litigation with Appellee that\n\nWatkins called her and raised the subject of the indictments of Appellee and his wife\n\nat least one time after the January 21, 2011 phone call. (RR5, DX-1, 175-176). Blue\n\nplaced numerous calls to numbers associated with Watkins, in addition to the call on\n\nJanuary 21, 2011. Blue’s phone records also indicate that she received one telephone\n\ncall from Watkins’s cell phone, on the evening of March 30, 2011 – the same night\n\nshe had dinner with Watkins at the Dallas restaurant, and one day after the cases\n\nwere presented to the grand jury. (RR5, DX-1, 344, 371-372, 386, 426-427)\n\n     In pleadings, the State claims that Watkins may have discussed the impending\n\nindictments with Blue for the purposes of furthering the investigation. (CR-180,\n\n625-626; RR2, 52-53). Although the State also took the position that Watkins had\n\nno role in the investigation (RR3, 24; RR4, 214), Watkins continued to discuss\n\nindictments with Blue after the charges had been presented to the grand jury. (RR5,\n\nDX-1, 175-176).\n\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\f     5.   On March 31, 2011, two weeks before beginning of the fee dispute\n          trial between Appellee and Blue, the indictments are returned\n          against Appellee\n     About two weeks before the scheduled start of the fee dispute trial between\n\nAppellee and Blue, the indictments against Appellee and his wife were returned on\n\nMarch 31, 2011, and made public on April 4, 2011. (RR5, DX-1, 141, 146-147; CR-\n\n180, 162; CR-182, 158; CR-183, 158; CR-191, 157).\n\n     6.   On April 11, 2011, Blue makes another “contribution” to Watkins\n     Nine days after the indictments against Appellee were returned, and four days\n\nafter the indictments were made public, on April 8, 2011, Blue contacted Watkins’s\n\nwife and Watkins’s assistant for the purpose of delivering an additional $1,000\n\n“contribution” to Watkins. (RR5, DX-4, 1026). This “contribution” occurred five\n\nmonths after Watkins had been reelected district attorney. Blue had no further\n\ntelephone communications with Watkins until the evening of April 27, 2011, when\n\nBlue called Watkins shortly after she testified at trial in the fee dispute against\n\nAppellee. (RR5, DX-1, 427).\n\n     7.   Fee dispute trial between Appellee and Blue\n     After Appellee was indicted, he moved to stay his fee dispute trial against Blue\n\nand her associated attorneys until the criminal charges were resolved. (RR5, DX-1,\n\n406-411). Blue objected to the stay, and the district court granted a two-day\n\ncontinuance. (RR5, DX-1, 410). The district court trial on Blue’s claims against\n\nAppellee took place between April 20, 2011 and April 28, 2011. Due to the criminal\n\n                                        26\n\fcharges, Appellee and his wife exercised their Fifth Amendment privilege and did\n\nnot testify during the fee-dispute trial. (RR5, DX-1, 415-416, 421). On December\n\n31, 2011, the federal district court awarded Blue and her associated attorneys\n\n$21,942,961.00 in attorney’s fees, of which Blue was entitled to one-third, or\n\napproximately $7.3 million. (RR5, DX-1, 106, 128).\n\n     8.    Appellee files the Motion to Dismiss and proffers 45 exhibits and 416\n           pages of evidence in support of the motion.\n     On November 16, 2012, Appellee filed the Motion to Dismiss, asserting his\n\nconstitutional rights to Due Process and Equal Protection were violated because, due\n\nto Blue’s bribing and influence of Watkins, Appellee was: (1) selectively prosecuted;\n\n(2) vindictively prosecuted; and (3) deprived of his right to a disinterested\n\nprosecutor. (CR-180, 31-488). Attached to the Motion to Dismiss and proffered to\n\nthe court were 45 exhibits and 416 pages of evidence. (CR-180, 72-488). The\n\nproffered evidence includes the following (CR-180, 36-488):\n\n    The case against Appellee was referred to the District Attorney’s Office by\n     the attorney for Hill Jr., who is an adverse party to Appellee in a federal\n     lawsuit.\n\n    On February 18, 2010, a judge in the United States District Court, Northern\n     District of Texas, entered an order finding that Hill Jr.: (1) submitted summary\n     judgment materials in bad faith and with the intent of committing fraud on the\n     Court, and (2) lied under oath. The district court also found that Hill Jr.’s\n     attorney had “far exceeded the bounds of advocacy, permissible or\n     otherwise.”\n\n\n\n\n                                         27\n\f Four days later, on February 22, 2010, Hill Jr.’s father submitted a letter to\n  the district attorney’s office in which he accused Appellee and his wife of\n  mortgage fraud.\n\n A few months later, Tillotson, the partner of Hill Jr.’s attorney, donated nearly\n  $50,000 to Watkins’s reelection campaign. Neither Tillotson nor other\n  members of his firm previously contributed to Watkins’s campaigns, but the\n  contributions immediately made Tillotson one of Watkins’s largest individual\n  contributors.\n\n The mortgage fraud allegations were dubious at best because the home equity\n  loan obtained by Appellee was never in default, was repaid in full just a few\n  months after it was obtained, long before Watkins considered criminal charges\n  against Appellee and was fully secured at all times by Appellee’s undisputed\n  equity in the subject home.\n\n OmniAmerican did not suffer any loss, was never at risk of suffering any loss,\n  and never complained to authorities that Appellee did anything wrong or\n  committed any crime.\n\n The District Attorney’s Office did not interview witnesses such as the loan\n  officer or the mortgage broker, before indicting Appellee.\n\n Despite the District Attorney’s Office’s policy that defense attorneys would\n  be provided notice of grand jury proceedings and an opportunity to present\n  their case to the grand jury, no such notice was given to Appellee or his\n  attorneys. In fact, First Assistant Moore, who was a witness during the motion\n  to dismiss hearing, told Texas Lawyer that it was “all about fairness... This is\n  not a railroad we are running...this is a justice system.”\n\n Beginning in November 2009, Appellee was represented for about six months\n  in the federal litigation by a group of attorneys that included Blue. Blue\n  bragged to Appellee about her relationship with Watkins, and specifically told\n  Appellee about her personal friendship with Watkins, generous campaign\n  contributions Blue gave to Watkins, and pro bono representation of Watkins\n  as his personal lawyer.\n\n\n\n\n                                      28\n\f While representing Appellee, Blue even discussed ways she might use her\n  influence with Watkins to intimidate opposing counsel in the federal\n  litigation.\n\n Shortly after the federal litigation settled in May 2010, Blue and the two\n  attorneys with whom she represented Appellee demanded $50 million in\n  attorney’s fees for six months of work. When Appellee refused, Blue and the\n  other attorneys withdrew from representing him and filed suit against\n  Appellee for their fees.\n\n Two weeks before this fee dispute trial was set to begin in federal court on\n  April 18, 2011, Appellee learned that he had been indicted. As a result of the\n  indictments, Appellee was advised to not take the stand during the fee dispute\n  trial.\n\n The federal court entered a judgment against Appellee and his wife for more\n  than $34 million, which was later reduced to $21.9 million, with Blue\n  personally standing to receive one-third of the judgment, or about $7.3\n  million.\n\n Appellee then obtained discovery from Blue regarding her communications\n  with the District Attorney’s Office. During a deposition, Blue admitted that\n  Watkins had called her before the indictments were returned to attempt to\n  discuss potential charges against Appellee. Blue stated that Watkins told her\n  that “there could be an indictment or are you still interested in the\n  indictments,” or words to that effect.\n\n Through the discovery, it was revealed that a dramatic spike in\n  communications between Blue and Watkins occurred in the days and weeks\n  before the indictments were obtained. These communications included calls\n  between Blue and both Watkins’s office and cellphone numbers.\n\n On March 30, 2011, the day before indictments against Appellee were\n  presented to the grand jury, Blue and Watkins communicated seven times via\n  Watkins’s cellphone number.\n\n Campaign finance records reflect that on March 9, 2011, which was about\n  three weeks before the indictments were presented, the Watkins campaign\n  accepted a $5,000 donation from Blue. This was despite the fact that\n\n                                     29\n\f   Watkins’s “reelection campaign” had ended months earlier (Watkins had been\n   reelected in November 2010).\n\n Around the same time, Blue solicited others who donated thousands more to\n  Watkins.\n\n About 18 months after Appellee was indicted, on October 12, 2012,\n  Appellee’s counsel met with assistant district attorney Deborah Smith, who\n  took over the cases against Appellee long after the indictment. Smith\n  described a “re-evaluation” of the cases, and said that she had already\n  determined that she would recommend dismissing certain charges against\n  both Appellee and his wife (who was also indicted). Smith also told\n  Appellee’s counsel that she was conducting “due diligence” interviews of\n  witnesses regarding the remaining charges, and would eventually make a\n  recommendation regarding those charges as well.\n\n Smith expressed significant concerns about the cases against Appellee and his\n  wife, made clear that she (Smith) had no role in obtaining the indictments,\n  further stated that the interviews of witnesses she was conducting should have\n  been conducted much earlier, and also stated that she would refuse to try the\n  case if her office decided to go forward on any of the charges. Smith conveyed\n  several reasons why the charges against Appellee were without merit. Smith\n  requested that certain information be put in a written submission for her to use\n  in connection with her recommendations.\n\n Smith “apologized” on behalf of the District Attorney’s Office.\n\n On October 19, 2012, Appellee’s counsel emailed the written submission to\n  Smith.\n\n Shortly after the meeting with Smith, the District Attorney’s Office filed a\n  motion to dismiss all charges against Appellee’s wife.\n\n On October 22, 2012, in response to the email from Appellee’s counsel, Smith\n  stated that even though she was in the middle of a “reevaluation” of the cases\n  against Appellee and his wife, which had already caused Smith to recommend\n  and obtain dismissals against Appellee’s wife, Smith had been removed from\n  the Hill case effective the previous Friday and was reassigned to a different\n  department.\n\n                                      30\n\f        After considering Appellee’s Motion to Dismiss and the proffered evidence,\n\nwhich included sworn deposition testimony from Blue and Malouf, telephone\n\nrecords and emails produced by Blue, Watkins’s campaign finance records, and\n\nother materials, the trial court set a hearing date of February 18, 2013 on the motion\n\n(the first hearing ultimately took place on February 14, 2013). (CR-180, 501-502;\n\nCR-182, 496; CR-183, 495; CR-191, 496).\n\n        9.   The lead-up to the hearing held on February 14, 2013\n        On January 22, 2013, Appellee served subpoenas on Watkins and other\n\nmembers of the District Attorney’s Office, seeking to compel testimony and the\n\nproduction of documents in connection with the evidentiary hearing. (CR-180, 540-\n\n546, 567-573). The subpoenas requested additional evidence of communications\n\nbetween Watkins and Blue relating to Appellee and his wife. (CR-180, 545-46, 571-\n\n573).\n\n        In response to the subpoenas, the State filed a series of motions to quash and\n\nmoved for a protective order, arguing that the State had a privilege under the work\n\nproduct doctrine not to provide any of the information sought by Appellee’s\n\nsubpoenas. (CR-180, 523-573).\n\n        On February 12, 2013, Blue voluntarily filed an affidavit in which she testified\n\nabout certain communications with Watkins concerning the indictments. (CR-180,\n\n853-856).\n\n                                           31\n\f     10. Hearing on February 14, 2013 – trial court rules that Appellee made\n         a prima facie showing on each of his claims and was entitled to an\n         evidentiary hearing concerning whether Watkins was influenced by\n         Blue with respect to the decision to approve the indictments of\n         Appellee and his wife\n     On February 14, 2013, the trial court ruled that in the Motion to Dismiss and\n\nthe evidence proffered with the motion, Appellee made a prima facie showing on\n\neach of his claims and was entitled to an evidentiary hearing concerning whether\n\nWatkins was influenced by Blue with respect to the decision to approve the\n\nindictments of Appellee and his wife. (RR2, 27-28). The trial court found that\n\nAppellee was entitled to examine both Blue and Watkins about their discussions\n\nwith each other concerning the indictments. (RR2, 28-29, 41).\n\n     Then, counsel for Blue informed the trial court that Blue was being criminally\n\ninvestigated on the issues raised in the Motion to Dismiss. (RR2, 6). Appellee was\n\ndirected by the trial court to call Blue to the witness stand. (RR2, 29-30). Although\n\nBlue submitted the affidavit just two days earlier that addressed the topics on which\n\nshe was to be examined (CR-180, 853-856), Blue refused to testify after invoking\n\nthe Fifth Amendment. (CR-180, 852-856; RR2, 46-48). In response to the single\n\nsubstantive question of: “[D]id you discuss potential indictments against Albert and\n\n[Erin] Hill with [Watkins] in March of 2011?”, Blue invoked her privilege. (RR2,\n\n48). Blue also refused to answer any other questions. (RR2, 48).\n\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\f      Appellee called Watkins to the stand. (RR2, 49). Through an assistant district\n\nattorney, the State announced that Watkins would not testify about his conversations\n\nwith Blue because such conversations were supposedly “work product.” (RR2, 51-\n\n54, 56-58). On behalf of Watkins, the State also claimed law enforcement and\n\nexecutive privileges. (CR-180, 554-558; RR2, 66). The trial court overruled these\n\nobjections.\n\n      Then the State claimed that although Watkins was in the building and in his\n\noffice, he was too ill to testify. (RR2, 66-67). In reliance on this representation, the\n\ntrial court granted the State a continuance, and rescheduled the hearing for March 7,\n\n2013. (RR2, 71-72).\n\n      11. Between March 1 and 6, 2013, the State files for mandamus in the\n          Court of Appeals and this Court, all of which are denied\n      On March 1, 2013, the State filed a Petition For Writ of Mandamus And\n\nMotion For Temporary Relief, asking the Court of Appeals to enjoin the trial court’s\n\nscheduled hearing on the following grounds: (1) Watkins’s testimony was\n\nprivileged; and (2) Appellee was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. (CR-180,\n\n1163-1202; CR-182, 1042-1081; CR-183, 1041-1080; CR-191, 789-839).\n\n      On March 6, 2013, the day before the hearing was to take place, the Fifth\n\nDistrict Court of Appeals denied the State’s petition. (CR-191, 841).\n\n      On the same day, the State filed a Petition for Writ of Prohibition and Petition\n\nfor Writ of Mandamus and Motion for Temporary Stay in Proceedings to this Court.\n\n                                          33\n\f(CR-180, 1215-1259; CR-191, 843-874, 876).           This Court denied the State’s\n\npetition.\n\n        On the morning of the hearing, March 7, 2013, the State made a third attempt\n\nto stop the hearing, which also was rejected by this Court. (CR-191, 878-883, 885;\n\nRR4, 25-26).\n\n        12. Hearing on March 7, 2013 – trial court draws an adverse inference\n            and dismisses the indictments against Appellee\n        At the beginning of the hearing on March 7, 2013, Blue’s counsel represented\n\nto the trial court that based upon Blue’s Fifth Amendment rights, Blue would once\n\nagain refuse to testify in response to substantive questions. Blue was excused. (RR4,\n\n7-8).\n\n        Appellee then called Watkins to testify. Watkins first was asked the following\n\nquestion: “Mr. Watkins, before the indictments of Appellee and his wife were\n\nhanded down, you had at least one or more phone calls with Lisa Blue concerning\n\n(Appellee and his wife), correct?” Watkins answered: “Based on the advice of my\n\ncounsel and of the advice of my staff with the District Attorney’s Office, I am\n\nrefusing to answer any questions that you may pose be—because of my right as an\n\nattorney to have the privilege and to protect my work product.” (RR4, 15).\n\n        Then Watkins was asked: “You said to Blue, words to the effect of, ‘There\n\ncould be an indictment of Appellee, or both the Hills. Are you still interested in the\n\n\n\n                                           34\n\findictments?’ Correct, sir?” (RR4, 15). In response to this question, Watkins again\n\nclaimed attorney and work-product privileges. (RR4, 15).\n\n     The trial court overruled Watkins’s objections and directed him to answer\n\nthese questions. (RR4, 15). Watkins refused. (RR4, 15)\n\n     Appellee called to the witness stand Strittmatter and Martin, both of whom\n\nwere then employed by the District Attorney’s Office, and also Moore, who at the\n\ntime of the hearing was the former First Assistant. Strittmatter, Martin, and Moore\n\nhad already submitted sworn statements discussing the State’s investigation of\n\nAppellee and his wife, and the decision to present the cases to the grand jury for\n\nindictment. (CR-180, 773-778; CR-182, 682-686; CR-183, 681-685; CR-191, 782-\n\n785; RR4, 12-13, 40).\n\n     It was revealed that the State’s “investigation” of Appellee and his wife relied\n\nextensively on materials submitted by Hill Jr., who the State knew to have recently\n\ncommitted perjury. (RR4, 103, 141-142). The State never issued grand jury\n\nsubpoenas to Hill Jr. or to his trust. (RR4, 103, 141-142). In fact, before seeking\n\nindictments against Appellee and his wife, although Martin had spoken to Hill Jr.,\n\nhis attorney, and someone in the general counsel’s office at OmniAmerican, the State\n\nnever conducted interviews with the loan officer at OmniAmerican, the mortgage\n\nbroker who presented the application to OmniAmerican, the title company who\n\n\n\n\n                                        35\n\fconducted the title search on the property at issue, Appellee, his wife, or counsel for\n\nAppellee and his wife. (RR4, 94:5–96:4, 141:3–17, 156:16–57:6).\n\n      On October 12, 2012, counsel for Appellee met with assistant district attorney\n\nDeborah Smith, to whom the case had then-been reassigned. (RR4, 216-218; CR-\n\n180-Supp-Aug02, 92). During this meeting, Smith apologized for how the State\n\nhandled the cases against Appellee and his wife, indicated that she was conducting\n\n“due diligence” interviews of witnesses, and stated that she would recommend\n\ndismissing certain or all of the charges against both Appellee and his wife. Id. Later\n\nthat same day, the District Attorney’s Office moved to dismiss all charges against\n\nErin Hill (Appellee’s wife) “in the interest of justice.” Id.\n\n      Smith was soon removed from the case and reassigned to the animal cruelty\n\nunit. Id. The indictments against Appellee were reassigned to Strittmatter. (CR-\n\n180, 487; CR-182, 483; CR-183, 483; CR-191, 482).\n\n      The State also admitted that the charges against Appellee are “unprecedented.”\n\n(RR4, 49-50, 126-129, 155).        This stems from the fact that underlying these\n\nindictments, the loan was funded, was paid as expected, was repaid in full, and there\n\nwas no complaint from OmniAmerican. Id. And, Appellee’s undisputed 20 percent\n\nownership interest in the property was sufficient to fully secure the entire of loan,\n\nso not only was there no loss, there was never any risk of loss. (RR4, 88-89).\n\n\n\n\n                                           36\n\f     Further, despite the fact that Martin’s handwritten notes reflect that she told\n\nPickett that OmniAmerican “...really isn’t interested in prosecuting,” and that she\n\n“didn’t see how [she] could prove his criminal case,” especially since the “victim”\n\n(OmniAmerican) suffered no harm and did not want to prosecute, (RR4, 183-185,\n\n201; RR5, DX-8; 1084), Martin testified that she had always believed that the case\n\nagainst Appellee was “strong” and certain to be indicted from the moment it was\n\nfirst reported to the office by Hill Jr.’s attorney. (RR4, 149-150, 171). By adding\n\nundated additional language that contradicted what she had written over two years\n\nearlier, Martin also admitted during the hearing that she augmented her September\n\n2010 notes in a manner that was calculated to make them appear more favorable to\n\nthe State. (RR4, 188-189).\n\n     Finally, although Moore testified that a defense attorney’s request to address\n\nthe grand jury is routinely accommodated by a prosecutor before seeking\n\nindictments, and in this case, Blue in substance made such a request on behalf of\n\nAppellee when she met with Moore in May 2010, neither Appellee nor his new\n\ncounsel were ever informed that criminal charges were being contemplated. (RR4,\n\n53-56).\n\n     During the hearing, the State did not object to Appellee calling Strittmatter,\n\nMartin, and Moore; in fact, the State previously invited Appellee to question Martin,\n\noffering that Martin could “respond[ ] to the inquiries regarding the progression of\n\n\n                                         37\n\fthe—of the—investigation” and could fully “respond to [Appellee’s] allegations.”\n\n(RR3, 15-16). The State invoked no work-product objections to any questions\n\nduring the course of the testimony of Strittmatter, Martin, and Moore. Nor did the\n\nState attempt to limit the scope of the testimony of Strittmatter, Martin, and Moore\n\nduring the hearing.      Strittmatter, Martin, and Moore were allowed to testify\n\nextensively regarding the State’s investigation of Appellee and his wife, the “pitch\n\nsession,” Watkins’s involvement in the “pitch session,” and internal deliberations\n\nregarding the State’s decision to indict Appellee and his wife. The State elicited\n\ntestimony concerning the events at issue and introduced into evidence internal work\n\nproduct, including a PowerPoint presentation that was used by Martin at the “pitch\n\nsession.” (RR5, SX-2, 68-76).\n\n     The State also stipulated to the authenticity and admissibility of nearly all of\n\nthe evidence attached to Appellee’s Motion, including the sworn deposition\n\ntestimony, Blue’s phone records and emails, and Watkins’s campaign finance\n\nreports. (RR4, 29-31).\n\n     13. The trial court’s findings and dismissal of the indictments against\n         Appellee\n     The trial court did not put “much credibility” in Moore’s testimony due to\n\nMoore’s relationship with Blue and Watkins. (RR4, 191). And, the trial court did\n\nnot find Martin’s testimony credible. It further found that the testimony of the Moore\n\nand Martin was not sufficient to answer the question of whether Watkins’s decision\n\n                                         38\n\fto approve the indictments of Appellee and his wife was improperly influenced by\n\nhis relationship with Blue. (RR4, 188-191, 216).\n\n        Before the conclusion of the March 7, 2013 hearing, the trial court gave\n\nWatkins another opportunity to testify, and he again refused to do so. (RR4, 191-\n\n195).\n\n        The trial court concluded that an adverse inference was appropriate as to Blue\n\nbased on her invocation of the Fifth Amendment and refusal to answer questions\n\nabout her conversations with Watkins. (RR4, 196).\n\n        The trial court dismissed the indictments against Appellee, concluding that he\n\nhad been denied the right to a meaningful hearing regarding the alleged\n\nconstitutional violation due to Watkins’s refusal to testify, Blue’s invocation of her\n\nFifth Amendment privilege, and that the State had failed to rebut Appellee’s prima\n\nfacie showing of prosecutorial misconduct. (RR4, 219).\n\n        The trial court issued an order dated March 7, 2013 dismissing the cases\n\nagainst Appellee. (CR-180, 1100; CR-182, 978; CR-183, 977; CR-191, 894). On\n\nAugust 2, 2013, the trial court issued detailed findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw. (CR-180-Supp-Aug02, 78-116).\n\n\n\n\n                                           39\n\fIX. Summary of the Arguments\n\n      Appellee will argue that to establish a prima facie case of selective\n\nprosecution in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and to obtain a\n\nhearing under the “presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness” method, a\n\ndefendant must provide “some evidence” that shows: (1) the government singled out\n\nthe defendant for prosecution and has not proceeded against others similarly situated\n\nbased on the type of conduct for which the defendant is charged; and (2) the\n\ngovernment’s discriminatory selection is invidious. Once the defendant makes this\n\nshowing, the burden shifts to the State to justify the discriminatory treatment.\n\n      Appellee will ask this Court to clarify what constitutes “some evidence” and\n\nhold that so long as a defendant attaches a proffer of evidence to a motion to dismiss\n\ndue to prosecutorial misconduct, the trial court in its discretion determines to present\n\na colorable claim of a constitutional violation, the defendant has attached “some\n\nevidence,” and the trial court should have the discretion to conduct a hearing on the\n\nmotion to dismiss.\n\n      Appellee will also ask this Court to find that Appellee not only attached “some\n\nevidence” showing a constitutional violation, but in fact attached “exceptionally\n\nclear evidence.”\n\n      Finally, Appellee will ask this Court to find that the Court of Appeals erred\n\nwhen it: (1) sustained the State’s second issue and concluded that Appellee “did not\n\n\n                                          40\n\fmake the proper showing sufficient to establish a prima facie case...” of the fact that\n\nthe former elected district attorney of Dallas County engaged in prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct by allowing himself to be corruptly influenced by a political ally in\n\nreturn for indicting Appellee; (2) found that the trial court erred in conducting a\n\nhearing on Appellee’s motion to dismiss based upon prosecutorial misconduct; (3)\n\nvacated the trial court’s Order Granting Motion to Dismiss; and (4) remanded the\n\ncase to the trial court to reinstate the indictments against Appellee.\n\n      As a result, Appellee will ask this Court to reverse the judgment and opinion\n\nof the Court of Appeals, find that Appellee provided “some evidence” constituting\n\na colorable claim that allowed the trial court to exercise its discretion to order a\n\nhearing, and affirm the trial court’s Order Granting Motion to Dismiss.\n\n\n\n\n                                          41\n\fX. Argument\n\n   1. Issue One: To establish a prima facie case of selective prosecution in\n      violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and to obtain a\n      hearing under the “presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness” method,\n      a defendant must provide “some evidence” that shows: (1) the\n      government singled out the defendant for prosecution and has not\n      proceeded against others similarly situated based on the type of conduct\n      for which the defendant is charged; and (2) the government’s\n      discriminatory selection is invidious. Once the defendant makes this\n      showing, the burden shifts to the State to justify the discriminatory\n      treatment.\n      Appellee asks this Court to clarify what constitutes “some evidence” and\n      hold that so long as a defendant attaches a proffer of evidence to a motion\n      to dismiss due to prosecutorial misconduct, the trial court in its discretion\n      determines to present a colorable claim of a constitutional violation, the\n      defendant has attached “some evidence,” and the trial court should have\n      the discretion to conduct a hearing on the motion to dismiss. Appellee\n      also asks this Court to find that Appellee not only attached “some\n      evidence” showing a constitutional violation, but in fact attached\n      “exceptionally clear evidence.”\n      Finally, Appellee asks this Court to find that the Court of Appeals erred\n      when it: (1) sustained the State’s second issue and concluded that\n      Appellee “did not make the proper showing sufficient to establish a prima\n      facie case...” of the fact that the former elected district attorney of Dallas\n      County engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by allowing himself to be\n      corruptly influenced by a political ally in return for indicting Appellee;\n      (2) found that the trial court erred in conducting a hearing on Appellee’s\n      motion to dismiss based upon prosecutorial misconduct; (3) vacated the\n      trial court’s Order Granting Motion to Dismiss; and (4) remanded the case\n      to the trial court to reinstate the indictments against Appellee.\n\n         i. Introduction – so long as the prosecution is not for an improper\n            purpose, prosecutors have the discretion to prosecute\n      In the American criminal justice system, “so long as the prosecutor has\n\nprobable cause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by statute,\n\nthe decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\n                                        42\n\fgrand jury, generally rests entirely in his discretion.” Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434\n\nU.S. 357, 364 (1978); see U.S. Const. Art. II, § 3; 28 U.S.C. § 547 (2015) (“Except\n\nas otherwise provided by law,” U.S. Attorneys... “shall prosecute for all offenses\n\nagainst the United States.”); Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 2.01 (2015) (district\n\nattorneys “shall represent the State in all criminal cases in the district courts...[I]t\n\nshall be the primary duty of all prosecuting attorneys, including any special\n\nprosecutors, not to convict, but to see that justice is done. They shall not suppress\n\nfacts or secrete witnesses capable of establishing the innocence of the accused.”).\n\n       Further, there is a rebuttal presumption that a criminal prosecution is brought\n\nin good faith. Gawlik v. State, 608 S.W.2d 671, 673 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980); United\n\nStates v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U.S. 1, 14-15 (1926) (The “presumption of\n\nregularity” supports prosecutorial decisions, and “in the absence of clear evidence\n\nto the contrary, courts presume that (prosecutors) have properly discharged their\n\nofficial duties.”).\n\n       But, if a prosecution is brought for an improper purpose, such as a quid pro\n\nquo to a political ally who “improperly influences” the prosecutor in any manner –\n\nincluding but not limited to bribing the prosecutor through “campaign contributions”\n\nwhen there is no “campaign” – due process and equal protection of the law are\n\nviolated, and a court has the right, and the duty, to protect defendants from\n\nprosecutorial decisions that are based on unconstitutional motives or executed in bad\n\n\n                                          43\n\ffaith. Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 832 (1985) (A selective-prosecution claim\n\nasks a trial court to exercise judicial power over a “special province” of the executive\n\nbranch).\n\n      And, prosecutors are public officials who must serve the public’s interest –\n\nnot their own. Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935). As the Supreme\n\nCourt observed in Berger, a prosecutor is:\n\n      “...the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a\n      sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as\n      its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a\n      criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall\n      be done... [H]e may prosecute with earnestness and vigor...[B]ut, while\n      he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as\n      much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce\n      a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring\n      about a just one.”\n\n      The Supreme Court has also made it clear that a prosecutor cannot hide behind\n\nthe cloak of “prosecutorial discretion” as Watkins attempted to do and avoid judicial\n\nscrutiny if the prosecutor’s decision to prosecute was motivated by\n\nimproper reasons. See Dunlop v. Bachowski, 421 U.S. 560, 567 n.7, 568-574 (1975)\n\n(On issue of judicial review of an enforcement decision of an administrative agency\n\nof the executive branch, the Court rejected the agency’s contention that its decisions\n\nare unreviewable exercises of prosecutorial discretion) and Oyler v. Boles, 368 U.S.\n\n448, 456 (1962) (Holding that “some selectivity” in enforcing criminal laws does\n\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\fnot violate the equal protection clause, but a defendant may show that the decision\n\nto prosecute was based upon an improper purpose).\n\n      The concept of the prohibition against selective and vindictive prosecution\n\ndates back nearly 130 years, when in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 373-374\n\n(1886), the Supreme Court of the United States held that the selective prosecution of\n\nChinese laundry owners violated equal protection because similarly situated non-\n\nChinese laundry owners were not arrested or prosecuted. In Yick Wo, although the\n\nChinese laundry owners complied with regulations pertaining to laundries, San\n\nFrancisco passed an ordinance that prohibited the operation of a laundry in a wooden\n\nbuilding without a permit. Id. at 358-361. At the time, nearly all of the existing 320\n\nlaundries operated in wooden buildings. Id. Out of about 200 applications filed by\n\nChinese owners for the permit, only one was granted, while the city granted 79 out\n\nof the 80 applications filed by non-Chinese owners. Id. Although 240 of the\n\nlaundries were Chinese-owned and 80 were owned by non-Chinese, the prosecutor\n\ncharged over 150 Chinese laundry owners for violating the regulations, but did not\n\ncharge or prosecute a single non-Chinese laundry owner because all but one were\n\ngranted permits. Id. at 360-364.\n\n      Yick Wo specifically addressed issues of racial discrimination in selective\n\nprosecution cases. Yick Wo was handed down before the dubious opinion in Plessy\n\nv. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), which upheld the constitutionality of state laws\n\n\n                                         45\n\frequiring racial segregation in public facilities under the “separate-but-equal”\n\ndoctrine. Plessy was not repudiated by the Court until its decision in Brown v. Board\n\nof Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). But the fundamental holding in Yick Wo is clear:\n\nregardless of whether a law appears to be valid on its face, if it is prosecuted in an\n\nimproper manner, a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment occurs. As Justice Matthews wrote,\n\n      “Though the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in appearance,\n      yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye\n      and an unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal\n      discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to\n      their rights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of\n      the Constitution.”\n\nId. at 373-374. In the case before this Court, the circumstances in Yick Wo are in\n\nprinciple replayed: Texas Penal Code § 32.32, False Statement to Obtain Credit,\n\ncertainly appears to be “fair on its face and impartial in appearance.” When it was\n\n“applied and administered” (used to prosecute Appellee), however, by a “public\n\nauthority” (Watkins) who does so “with an evil eye and an unequal hand” (because\n\nhe was improperly influenced by Blue), “so as practically to make unjust and illegal\n\ndiscriminations between persons in similar circumstances,” [the State admitted that\n\nthe home-equity loan was never in arrears, had been fully repaid before the\n\ncommencement of any criminal investigation, and thus the indictments against\n\nAppellee are “unprecedented” (RR4, 49, 126, 129, 155)]..., “the denial of equal\n\n\n\n                                          46\n\fjustice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution” (Appellee was selectively\n\nprosecuted by Watkins for an improper and illegal purpose).\n\n      Stated under present-day laws and standards, under the Equal Protection and\n\nDue Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, to establish a prima\n\nfacie case of selective prosecution and to obtain a hearing under the “presumption\n\nof prosecutorial vindictiveness” method, a defendant must provide “some evidence”\n\nthat shows: (1) the government singled out the defendant for prosecution and has not\n\nproceeded against others similarly situated based on the type of conduct for\n\nwhich the defendant is charged; and (2) the government’s discriminatory selection\n\nis invidious. Once the defendant makes this showing, the burden shifts to the State\n\nto justify the discriminatory treatment.\n\n      Appellant will show that “some evidence” means evidence that constitutes a\n\ncolorable claim of a constitutional violation that may prove the elements of a\n\npresumed selective prosecution claim, and not evidence that proves the\n\nconstitutional violation: (1) beyond a reasonable doubt, (2) by clear and convincing\n\nevidence, or (3) by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n      As a result, Appellee asks this Court to clarify what constitutes “some\n\nevidence.” Appellee also asks this Court to find that so long as a defendant attaches\n\na proffer of evidence to a motion to dismiss due to prosecutorial misconduct that the\n\ntrial court in its discretion determines to present a colorable claim of a constitutional\n\n\n                                           47\n\fviolation, the defendant has attached “some evidence,” and a trial court has the\n\ndiscretion to conduct a hearing on the motion to dismiss.\n\n      Appellee met the burden set forth by the Supreme Court because he proffered\n\nwith the Motion to Dismiss not just “some evidence,” but rather “exceptionally clear\n\nevidence” proving that Watkins: (1) singled Appellee out for prosecution and did\n\nnot proceed against others similarly situated based on the type of conduct for\n\nwhich Appellee was charged; and (2) acted in an invidious manner. Green v. State,\n\n934 S.W.2d 92, 103 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996); Matney v. State, 99 S.W.3d 626, 628\n\n(Tex. App. Houston [1st Dist.] 2002); Gawlik v. State, 608 S.W.2d 671, 673 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1980); U.S. Const. Amend. V; U.S. Const. Amend. XIV. Therefore,\n\nAppellee was entitled to an evidentiary hearing.\n\n      Yet, in a 2-1 decision, the Court of Appeals ruled that Appellee should have\n\nnever received a hearing in the first place. If the evidence Appellee attached to his\n\nMotion to Dismiss as a proffer does not constitute “some evidence” that establishes\n\na prima facie case of selective prosecution, then absent an admission by a prosecutor\n\nthat he or she: (1) singled a defendant out for prosecution and did not proceed against\n\nothers similarly situated based on the type of conduct for which the defendant was\n\ncharged; and (2) acted in an invidious manner, there is no circumstance that could\n\nallow a defendant to obtain a hearing on a selective prosecution claim based upon a\n\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\fclaim of “presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness” that the State must rebut or\n\nface dismissal of the charges (such as was alleged in Appellee’s case).\n\n\n         ii. To raise a “presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness,” a\n             defendant must present evidence of circumstances that pose a\n             “realistic likelihood” of misconduct. When the defendant does so,\n             the defendant makes a prima facie case. The burden then shifts to\n             the State to rebut this presumption or face dismissal of the charges\n\n      A constitutional claim of prosecutorial vindictiveness or selective prosecution\n\nmay be established in two ways: (1) by presenting evidence of circumstances that\n\npose a “realistic likelihood” of misconduct that is sufficient to raise a “presumption\n\nof prosecutorial vindictiveness,” which the State must rebut or face dismissal of the\n\ncharges (as alleged in Appellee’s case); or (2) by presenting proof of “actual\n\nvindictiveness,” which means providing direct evidence that the prosecutor’s\n\ncharging decision is an unjustifiable penalty resulting solely from the defendant’s\n\nexercise of a protected legal right. See Neal v. State, 150 S.W.3d 169, 173 (Tex.\n\nCode Crim. App. 2004) (explanation of both methods of establishing prosecutorial\n\nvindictiveness or selective prosecution) and United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368,\n\n380-381 (1982) (explanation of actual vindictiveness).\n\n      Next, a selective-prosecution claim “is not a defense on the merits to the\n\ncriminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought\n\nthe charge for reasons forbidden by the Constitution.” United States v. Armstrong,\n\n517 U.S. 456, 463 (1996). In Armstrong, the Supreme Court noted that its precedent\n\n                                         49\n\fshows that the standard to prove a claim of selective prosecution is a “demanding”\n\nstandard, and that there is a “background presumption” that what a defendant must\n\nshow in the first instance to obtain discovery (through a hearing) “should itself be a\n\nsignificant barrier to the litigation of insubstantial claims.” Id., citing United\n\nStates v. Mezzanatto, 513 U.S. 196, 203 (1995) (explanation of “background\n\npresumption” as it relates to the voluntary waiver of legal rights). But it should not\n\nprevent a defendant’s legitimate claims when they are supported by “some\n\nevidence.”\n\n      In the Motion to Dismiss and the proffer of evidence attached to the motion,\n\nAppellee clearly showed that Watkins: (1) singled Appellee out for prosecution and\n\nhas not proceeded against others similarly situated based on allegations of mortgage\n\nfraud; and (2) clearly acted in an invidious manner, as he pursued the indictments\n\nagainst Appellee because Watkins allowed himself to be corruptly influenced by\n\nBlue. Therefore, Appellee made a prima facie case of violations of the Fifth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments under the “presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness”\n\nmethod. Appellee was therefore entitled to a hearing because he made a colorable\n\nclaim of a constitutional violation.\n\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\f          iii. The majority opinion’s characterization of the evidence attached to\n               the Motion to Dismiss is inaccurate. Nearly all of the evidence\n               proffered by Appellee and attached to the Motion to Dismiss: (1)\n               would be admissible in a hearing without further authentication;\n               and (2) constitutes “exceptionally clear” evidence that the decision\n               to prosecute was for an improper purpose, exceeding the standard\n               that the trial court must, in its discretion, find “some evidence” of\n               a colorable claim of a constitutional violation\n      In the dissenting opinion, Justice Bridges does an excellent job of presenting\n\nthe facts and describing the proceedings that took place in the trial court. See Hill,\n\nid. at 40-51 (Bridges, J. dissenting). Justice Bridges writes that, to establish a prima\n\nfacie case of selective prosecution, a defendant must provide “exceptionally clear”\n\nevidence that the decision to prosecute was for an improper reason. Id. at 53, citing\n\nGarcia v. State, 172 S.W.3d 270, 274 (Tex. App. El Paso, 2005) [A defendant\n\nclaiming selective prosecution must come forth with “exceptionally clear evidence”\n\nthat the prosecution was initiated for an improper reason, citing Nelloms v. State, 63\n\nS.W.3d 887, 893 (Tex. App. Fort Worth 2001, pet. ref.)].\n\n      But Appellee argues that, although the standard that Justice Bridges believes\n\nshould apply before a defendant is entitled to a hearing (“exceptionally clear”\n\nevidence) accurately describes the evidence proffered in the Motion to Dismiss,\n\nAppellee believes that the standard that this Court should adopt, which is “some\n\nevidence” that the trial court in its discretion determines to be a colorable claim of a\n\nconstitutional violation.\n\n\n\n                                          51\n\f      First, the majority opinion below characterizes the evidence attached to the\n\nMotion to Dismiss as “...forty-four exhibits...most of which were unauthenticated or\n\nnot otherwise identified by affidavit testimony.” Hill, id. at *8-9. As explained by\n\nthe majority, the exhibits include: (1) Hill Jr.’s February 2010 complaint to the\n\nDallas District Attorney’s office, (2) pleadings from other proceedings, excerpts\n\nfrom Watkins’s campaign finance reports, (3) email exchanges among attorneys\n\ncounsel in the litigation between Blue and Appellee, (4) Blue’s telephone records,\n\n(5) a log of text messages between Blue, Watkins, and his assistant, (6)\n\nannouncements about the SMU scholarship funded by Blue and about Watkins’s\n\nhiring of Blue to help in unrelated litigation, (7) a printout of a 2007 Texas\n\nLawyer article about the district attorney’s office’s grand jury policy, (8) Smith’s\n\nemail about her reassignment, (9) excerpts from transcripts in the litigation between\n\nBlue and Appellee, (10) deposition testimony from Blue in the litigation between\n\nBlue and Appellee in which Blue testified to receiving two phone calls from Watkins\n\nabout the indictments of the Appellee and his wife, and (11) deposition testimony\n\nfrom Blue’s co-counsel in the litigation between Blue and Appellee, Malouf, who\n\ntestified to overhearing one of those conversations. Hill, id. at *8-9; see CR-180,\n\n68-488.\n\n      The majority characterizes this evidence as insufficient and not\n\n“exceptionally clear evidence” or even “some evidence” that shows: (1) Watkins\n\n\n                                         52\n\fsingled out Appellee for prosecution and has not proceeded against others similarly\n\nsituated based on the type of conduct for which Appellee is charged; and\n\n(2) Watkins’s discriminatory selection is invidious. As a result, the majority believes\n\nthat Appellee did not make a prima facie case of prosecutorial misconduct, so\n\nAppellee was not even entitled to a hearing at the discretion of the trial court.\n\n      The majority’s characterization of the evidence proffered with the Motion to\n\nDismiss is inaccurate because nearly all of the evidence proffered is admissible\n\nwithout further authentication as follows:\n\n    Sworn testimony or former testimony under Tex. Rule Evid. 804(b)(1) (2013)\n     (Transcripts or deposition testimony in the Blue-versus-Appellee litigation,\n     which included phone records that were authenticated during the depositions,\n     see CR-180, 193-408);\n\n    Public records exception to the hearsay rule under Tex. Rule Evid. 803(8)\n     (2013) (excerpts from Watkins’s campaign finance reports; and the February\n     2010 complaint sent to the Dallas District Attorney’s office by Hill Jr.’s\n     attorney, as a governmental record is “anything belonging to, received by, or\n     kept by government for information,” see Tex. Pen. Code § 37.01(2)(A)\n     (2015) and Fox v. State, 418 S.W.3d 365, 371 (Tex. App. Texarkana 2012) (a\n     document received by the government is a “government record”); see also\n     Tex. Loc. Gov. Code § 201.003(8) (2013) (A “local government record” is\n     any document regardless of physical form or characteristic and regardless of\n     whether public access to it is open or restricted under the laws of the state,\n     created or received by a local government or any of its officers or employees\n     in the transaction of public business);\n\n    Admissions by the State under Tex. Rule Evid. 801(3) (2013) or statements\n     against interest under Tex. Rule Evid. 804(b)(3) (2013) (Announcements\n     about the SMU scholarship funded by Blue and about Watkins’s hiring of\n     Blue to help in unrelated litigation, printout of a 2007 Texas Lawyer article\n     about the office’s grand jury policy, Smith’s email about her reassignment,\n\n                                          53\n\f      and log of text messages between Blue and Watkins and his assistant, email\n      exchanges among attorneys in the litigation between Blue and Appellee);\n\nTherefore, most of the evidence proffered by Appellee and attached to the Motion to\n\nDismiss would have been admissible during a hearing without further authentication.\n\nThe evidence was more than sufficient to make a prima facie case of prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct, and the trial court was well within its discretion to order a hearing.\n\n      But even if the evidence proffered with the Motion to Dismiss was not\n\nadmissible without further authentication, Appellee argues that in order for a trial\n\ncourt to have the discretion to order a hearing, defendant is not required to\n\nauthenticate proffered evidence as though the defendant is filing a motion for\n\nsummary judgment under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a, especially when the\n\nproffered evidence is affidavits, declarations, self-authenticating documents,\n\ndeposition transcripts, and public or governmental documents.\n\n      Rather, this Court should adopt a standard that a “proffer of evidence” means\n\n“some evidence” that establishes a “colorable claim” of selective prosecution that a\n\ndefendant tenders to the trial court in good faith, and then leave it up to the trial court\n\nto exercise its discretion in allowing a hearing on a motion to dismiss for\n\nprosecutorial misconduct. Proffered evidence generally is evidence that is offered\n\nto a court so that the court can make a ruling on its admissibility. Black’s Law\n\nDictionary, 579 (7th ed. 1999). In Texas, when a party proffers evidence, a trial\n\ncourt’s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is reviewed under an abuse of\n                                            54\n\fdiscretion standard. Moses v. State, 105 S.W.3d 622, 627 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003).\n\nIf the ruling is within the zone of reasonable disagreement, an appellate court will\n\nnot disturb it. Id. When a trial court decides to admit the evidence, finding that the\n\nprobative value of the evidence is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,\n\nthis decision is given deference. Id. Thus, a reviewing court does not simply\n\nsubstitute its own decision for that of the trial court. Id.\n\n      A “proffer of evidence” in the context of a selective prosecution claim that\n\nallows a trial court in its discretion to order a hearing on the claim should be no\n\ndifferent than the procedure to obtain a hearing under Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S.\n\n154 (1978), where a defendant contests the truthfulness of an affidavit supporting a\n\nsearch warrant. There are two significant similarities between claims of selective\n\nprosecution and those made under Franks. First, just like there is a “presumption of\n\nregularity” that courts presume prosecutors have “properly discharged their official\n\nduties,” which means that it is presumed that prosecutors do not pursue indictments\n\nin exchange for allowing themselves to be corruptly influenced (as Watkins did), see\n\nArmstrong, 517 U.S. at 464, there is also a presumption of truthfulness or validity to\n\nan affidavit supporting a search warrant. Franks, 438 U.S. at 171; see also Cates v.\n\nState, 120 S.W.3d 352, 355 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (An affidavit supporting a search\n\nwarrant begins with a presumption of validity, so a defendant has the burden of\n\n\n\n\n                                            55\n\fmaking a preliminary showing of deliberate falsehoods in that affidavit before he is\n\nentitled to a Franks hearing).\n\n      Second, when a defendant seeks a Franks hearing, the defendant must proffer\n\nto the trial court an allegation: (1) of deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for\n\nthe truth, accompanied by an offer of proof [Hinojosa v. State, 4 S.W.3d 240, 247\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1999)]; (2) that points specifically to portions of the affidavit\n\nclaimed to be false, accompanied by a statement of supporting reasons [Cates, 120\n\nS.W.3d at 357] (The defendant made a sufficient preliminary showing to be entitled\n\nto an evidentiary hearing by specifying six specific portions of warrant affidavit that\n\ndefendant claimed he knew to be false); and (3) that shows that the false matter was\n\nnecessary to support a finding of probable cause. See Harris v. State, 227 S.W.3d\n\n83, 85 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). If these three conditions are met, and the contents\n\nof the affidavit that are not challenged are insufficient to support a finding of\n\nprobable cause, the defendant is entitled to a hearing on the issue of the truthfulness\n\nof the affidavit. Harris, 227 S.W.3d at 85.\n\n      In order to obtain a Franks hearing, a defendant need not include a sworn\n\naffidavit to make the preliminary showing. Ramsey v. State, 579 S.W.2d 920, 923\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1979); Cates, 120 S.W.3d at 359 (same). In Ramsey, this Court\n\nnoted that in Franks, no affidavit or other written material was offered, but only a\n\nstatement by the defense attorney as to what would be shown if he were allowed to\n\n\n                                          56\n\fcall witnesses on the issue. Ramsey, 579 S.W.2d at 923 (emphasis added). Such a\n\npreliminary showing was sufficient to justify a hearing. Id.\n\n      Thus, if merely alleging a deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the\n\ntruth, accompanied by an offer of proof, enables a defendant to a Franks hearing in\n\norder to prove a constitutional violation, a trial court should be within its discretion\n\nto order a hearing on a claim of prosecutorial misconduct to determine whether the\n\ndefendant was selectively prosecuted if the defendant attaches “some evidence” as\n\na proffer to the motion to dismiss that the trial court in its discretion determines to\n\npresent a colorable claim of a constitutional violation.         There should be no\n\nrequirement that affidavits or sworn statements be attached to a motion to dismiss\n\n(as the majority of the Court of Appeals implies).\n\n      Thus, in their ruling, the majority justices carved out an unprecedented rule in\n\nwhich, absent an admission by a prosecutor that he or she: (1) singled a defendant\n\nout for prosecution and did not proceed against others similarly situated based on\n\nthe type of conduct for which the defendant was charged; and (2) acted in an\n\ninvidious manner, there is no circumstance that would allow a trial court the\n\ndiscretion to grant a hearing on a motion alleging a selective prosecution claim under\n\nthe “presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness” method. The majority’s opinion\n\nthus eliminates a defendant’s ability to present evidence of circumstances that pose\n\na “realistic likelihood” of misconduct that is sufficient to raise a “presumption of\n\n\n                                          57\n\fprosecutorial vindictiveness,” which the State must rebut or face dismissal of the\n\ncharges (as alleged in Appellee’s case), and leaves a defendant who may be\n\nvictimized as Appellee was by Watkins only the ability to prove “actual\n\nvindictiveness,” which means providing direct evidence that the prosecutor’s\n\ncharging decision is an unjustifiable penalty resulting solely from the defendant’s\n\nexercise of a protected legal right. See Neal, 150 S.W.3d at 173 and Goodwin, 457\n\nU.S. at 380-381. This should not stand not only for public policy reasons, but as\n\nAppellee will explain below, such a standard is nearly impossible to meet because\n\nevidence of prosecutorial misconduct is often solely in the prosecutor’s possession.\n\n\n          iv. “Some evidence” means that a defendant must attach to the motion\n              to dismiss evidence that establishes that the defendant has a\n              colorable claim of a constitutional violation. This allows the trial\n              court to exercise its discretion in ordering the hearing. Once a\n              hearing is held, the defendant must show by “exceptionally clear\n              evidence” that the prosecution was initiated for an improper\n              reason.\n      Even if this Court takes the position that the proffer of evidence with a motion\n\nto dismiss may be similar to a proffer under Franks, there still remains the issue of\n\nwhat constitutes “some evidence.” The Supreme Court in Armstrong provides some\n\nguidance, but falls short of clearly defining “some evidence.” To understand the\n\nbasis of Armstrong, Appellee begins with a brief analysis of the proceedings in the\n\ncourt of appeals. The court of appeals held that a trial court is within its discretion\n\nto allow a hearing for discovery if a defendant presents evidence providing a\n\n                                          58\n\fcolorable basis of selective prosecution. United States v. Armstrong, 48 F.3d 1508,\n\n1512 (9th Cir. 1995).     Here, the defendant and several others were indicted for\n\ndistribution of the cocaine-based drug known as “crack.” Id. at 1510-1511. The\n\ndefendants were all black. Id. They filed a motion to dismiss the indictments for\n\nselective prosecution, alleging that due to their race, the prosecutor filed federal\n\ncharges rather than state charges. Id. In support, the defendants presented a study\n\nthat shows that in all 24 cases handled by a local public defender’s office that\n\ninvolved violations of the indicted offense, the defendants were black. Id. The\n\ngovernment provided no explanation or rebuttal evidence. Id. at 1511. The trial\n\ncourt granted the defendants’ motion for discovery. Id.\n\n      Rather than comply with the discovery order, the government filed a motion\n\nfor reconsideration and presented a list of all defendants charged with the subject\n\noffense over a three-year period but without any racial breakdown, and declarations\n\nby three law enforcement officers and two Assistant United States Attorneys that\n\nprovided four explanations for the study's implication that the overwhelming bulk of\n\nfederal prosecutions for cocaine-base offenses targeted black defendants. Id. The\n\ndeclarations: (1) asserted that socio-economic factors led certain ethnic and racial\n\ngroups to be particularly involved with the distribution of crack and that blacks were\n\nparticularly involved in the crack trade; (2) asserted that during the three-year period,\n\na total of eleven defendants who are not black but were members of racial or ethnic\n\n\n                                           59\n\fminority groups were prosecuted for crack; (3) asserted that many blacks had been\n\ntried in state court for cocaine-base offenses; (4) contained a description of some of\n\nthe general factors on which federal prosecutors based their charging decisions for\n\ncrack-related offenses; and (5) asserted other unidentified “race-neutral” criteria. Id.\n\n      In response, the defendants submitted an article and two affidavits from\n\ndefense attorneys that showed that: (1) an equal number of white people and\n\nminorities use and deal crack; (2) many nonblacks are prosecuted in state court for\n\ncrack offenses; and (3) the federal penalty for crack offenses is higher than the\n\npenalty for powder cocaine offenses, and that most federal prosecutions for crack\n\noffenses involve black defendants. Id. at 1511-1512. The trial court denied the\n\ngovernment's motion for reconsideration, and after the government failed to comply\n\nwith the discovery order, the trial court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss\n\nthe indictments. Id. at 1512.\n\n      The court of appeals held that the “colorable” basis standard is the proper one\n\nfor deciding whether a trial court has the discretion to allow a hearing for the\n\npurposes of discovery on a motion to dismiss because: (1) if a defendant could\n\nestablish a prima facie case, the defendant would not need discovery in the first\n\nplace; (2) the “colorable” basis standard is consistent with the approach adopted by\n\nthe majority of the other circuits courts (more on this below); (3) the “colorable”\n\nbasis standard ensures that the government will not be called to answer for charging\n\n\n                                          60\n\fdecisions as a result of frivolous and unwarranted allegations; and (4) the “colorable”\n\nbasis standard ensures that defendants will not face unjustified hurdles at the\n\ndiscovery stage that will preclude them from demonstrating the existence of actual\n\ndiscrimination in the selection of defendants for criminal prosecution. Id. at 1515.\n\nThus, to be entitled to a hearing at the trial court’s discretion, under the “colorable”\n\nbasis standard, a defendant must present “some evidence” tending to show disparate\n\ntreatment and discriminatory intent that entails a non-frivolous showing based on\n\nmore than conclusory allegations. Id. at 1512. The government then has the\n\nopportunity to rebut the defendant's showing. Finally, the trial court evaluates the\n\nevidence and determines whether a colorable basis of selective prosecution still\n\nexists. Id. By applying these standards, the court of appeals in Armstrong held that\n\nthe defendants made a colorable showing of selective prosecution. Id. at 1514-1515.\n\n      Thus, “some evidence” means evidence that demonstrates the defendant can\n\nmake a colorable claim showing the existence of the discriminatory effect element,\n\nwhich would allow a trial court in its discretion to order a hearing. Armstrong, 517\n\nU.S. at 469; Garcia v. State, 172 S.W.3d 270, 274 (Tex. App. El Paso 2005).\n\nAlthough on certiorari the Supreme Court did not clearly define what constitutes\n\n“some evidence,” and criticized the ruling of the court of appeals that held that a\n\ndefendant may establish a colorable basis for discriminatory effect without evidence\n\nthat the Government has failed to prosecute others who are similarly situated to the\n\n\n                                          61\n\fdefendant, the Court did not disturb the language “colorable basis for discriminatory\n\neffect.”\n\n      It is clear that the Supreme Court’s definition of “some evidence” means\n\nevidence that provides a colorable basis to show that the defendant can prove the\n\ntwo elements of a selective prosecution claim, which are: (1) the government singled\n\nout the defendant for prosecution and has not proceeded against others similarly\n\nsituated based on the type of conduct for which the defendant is charged; and (2) the\n\ngovernment’s discriminatory selection is invidious and not for a proper purpose.\n\n      The “some evidence” requirement does not mean that for a trial court to be\n\nwithin its discretion to order a hearing, a defendant must prove the selective\n\nprosecution claim beyond a reasonable doubt, by clear and convincing evidence, or\n\neven by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n       “Some evidence” means that a defendant must attach to the motion to dismiss\n\nevidence that establishes that the defendant has a colorable claim of a constitutional\n\nviolation. This allows the trial court to exercise its discretion in ordering the hearing.\n\nOnce a hearing is held, the defendant must show by “exceptionally clear evidence”\n\nthat the prosecution was initiated for an improper reason. See Garcia, 172 S.W.3d\n\nat 274; County v. State, 812 S.W.2d 303, 308 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989) (same); Gregg\n\nv. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 199 (1976); and McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 297\n\n\n\n\n                                           62\n\f(1987) (Exceptionally clear evidence required before a court may hold that\n\nprosecutorial discretion has been abused).\n\n      Because there is no definition of “colorable claim” or “exceptionally clear\n\nevidence” in the Texas Penal Code or Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, Appellee\n\npoints this Court to the plain meanings of these phrases. See Daniels v. State, 754\n\nS.W.2d 214, 219 (Tex. Crim. App. 1988) (Terms that are not defined by statute are\n\ngiven their plain meaning unless a statute clearly shows that they were used in some\n\nother sense.); see also Ely v. State, 582 S.W.2d 416, 419 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1979) (same).\n\n      A “colorable claim” is one that is “plausible, credible, or conceivable.”\n\nConcise Oxford American Thesaurus, 149 (2006). Or, it is a claim that is “legitimate\n\nand that may reasonably be asserted, given the facts presented and the current law.”\n\nBlack’s Law Dictionary, 240 (7th ed. 1999). “Exceptionally clear evidence” is\n\nevidence that is “unusually obvious, plain, evident, and intelligible.” Concise\n\nOxford American Thesaurus, 138, 292 (2006).\n\n      Appellee made a “colorable claim” of a constitutional violation. The Motion\n\nto Dismiss and its attachments detail how Blue, who at the time was engaged in a\n\nfee dispute with Appellee, corruptly influenced Watkins, a close friend and fellow\n\nDemocratic party operative, to authorize indictments against Appellee in exchange\n\nfor a promise of and actual receipt of “campaign” contributions for a nonexistent\n\n\n                                        63\n\f“campaign.” The State admitted that the indictments were “unprecedented.” (RR4,\n\n49, 126, 129, 155; CR-180, 31-488). And, the indictments clearly benefitted Blue,\n\nas Appellee was forced to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege and did not testify\n\non his own behalf during the fee dispute trial because of the pending criminal\n\nindictments.\n\n      And, Appellee not only proffered “some evidence” with the Motion to Dismiss\n\nthat would establish a “colorable claim,” enabling the trial court to exercise its\n\ndiscretion and order a hearing under the proposed standard. Appellee in fact\n\nproffered “exceptionally clear evidence.” On its face, the proffered evidence makes\n\nit “obvious, plain, and evident” that Watkins pursued the indictments in exchange\n\nfor allowing himself to be corruptly influenced by Blue. The evidence includes the\n\nfollowing (See CR-180, 36-52):\n\n    The case against Appellee was referred to the District Attorney’s Office by\n     the attorney for Hill Jr., who is an adverse party to Appellee in a federal\n     lawsuit.\n\n    On February 18, 2010, the judge in the federal lawsuit entered an order finding\n     that Hill Jr.: (1) submitted summary judgment materials in bad faith and with\n     the intent of committing fraud on the Court, and (2) lied under oath. The\n     district court also found that Hill Jr.’s attorney had “far exceeded the bounds\n     of advocacy, permissible or otherwise.”\n\n    Four days later, Hill Jr.’s father submitted a letter to the district attorney’s\n     office in which he accused Appellee and his wife of mortgage fraud.\n\n    A few months later, the law firm partner of Hill Jr.’s attorney donated nearly\n     $50,000 to the reelection campaign of Watkins even though no member of\n     that firm had previously contributed to Watkins’s campaigns. The\n                                         64\n\f   contributions immediately made the partner one of Watkins’s largest\n   individual contributors.\n\n The mortgage fraud allegations were dubious at best. The home equity loan\n  obtained by Appellee was never in default, was repaid in full just a few months\n  after it was obtained (long before Watkins considered criminal charges against\n  Appellee), and was fully secured at all times by Appellee’s undisputed equity\n  in the subject home.\n\n OmniAmerican did not suffer any loss, was never at risk of suffering any loss,\n  and never complained to authorities that Appellee did anything wrong or\n  committed any crime.\n\n Prior to indicting Appellee, the District Attorney’s Office did not interview\n  key witnesses such as the loan officer or the mortgage broker.\n\n Despite the policy of the District Attorney’s Office that defense attorneys\n  would be provided notice of grand jury proceedings and have an opportunity\n  to present their case to the grand jury, no such notice was given to Appellee\n  or his attorneys. This is in the face of the fact that Moore, who was a witness\n  during the motion to dismiss hearing, told Texas Lawyer that it was “all about\n  fairness... This is not a railroad we are running...this is a justice system.”\n\n Beginning in November 2009, Appellee was represented for about six months\n  in the federal litigation by a group of attorneys that included Blue. Blue\n  bragged to Appellee about her relationship with Watkins, and specifically told\n  Appellee about her personal friendship with Watkins, generous campaign\n  contributions she gave to Watkins, and pro bono representation of Watkins as\n  his personal lawyer.\n\n While representing Appellee, Blue even discussed ways she might use her\n  influence with Watkins to intimidate opposing counsel in the federal\n  litigation.\n\n Shortly after the federal litigation settled in May 2010, Blue and the two\n  attorneys with whom she represented Appellee demanded $50 million in\n  attorney’s fees for six months’ work. When Appellee refused, Blue and the\n  other attorneys withdrew from representing him and filed suit against\n  Appellee.\n\n                                     65\n\f Two weeks before this fee dispute trial was set to begin in federal court on\n  April 18, 2011, Appellee learned that he had been indicted. As a result of the\n  indictments, Appellee was advised to not take the stand during the fee dispute\n  trial.\n\n The federal court entered a judgment against Appellee and his wife for more\n  than $34 million, which was later reduced to $21.9 million, with Blue\n  personally standing to receive one-third of the judgment, or about\n  $7.3 million.\n\n Appellee then obtained discovery from Blue regarding her communications\n  with the District Attorney’s Office. During a deposition, Blue admitted that\n  Watkins had called her before the indictments were returned to discuss\n  potential charges against Appellee. Blue stated that Watkins told her that\n  “there could be an indictment or are you still interested in the indictments,” or\n  words to that effect.\n\n Through that discovery, a dramatic spike in communications between Blue\n  and Watkins was revealed, which occurred in the weeks and days before the\n  indictments were obtained. These communications included calls between\n  Blue and both Watkins’s office and cellphone numbers.\n\n Campaign finance records reflect that, on March 9, 2011, which was about\n  three weeks before the indictments were presented, the Watkins campaign\n  accepted a $5,000 donation from Blue. This was despite the fact that\n  Watkins’s “reelection campaign” had ended months earlier (Watkins had been\n  reelected in November 2010).\n\n Blue solicited others who donated thousands more to Watkins around the\n  same time.\n\n On March 30, 2011, the day before indictments against Appellee were\n  presented to the grand jury, Blue and Watkins communicated seven times via\n  Watkins’s cellphone number.\n\n About 18 months after Appellee was indicted, on October 12, 2012,\n  Appellee’s counsel met with assistant district attorney Deborah Smith, who\n  took over the cases against Appellee long after the indictment. Smith\n\n                                      66\n\f      described a “reevaluation” of the cases, and said that she had already\n      determined that she would recommend dismissing certain charges against\n      both Appellee and his wife (who had also been indicted). Smith also told\n      Appellee’s counsel that she was conducting “due diligence” interviews of\n      witnesses regarding the remaining charges, and would eventually make a\n      recommendation regarding those charges as well.\n\n    Smith expressed significant concerns about the cases against Appellee and his\n     wife, made clear that she (Smith) had no role in obtaining the indictments,\n     further stated that the interviews of witnesses she was conducting should have\n     been conducted much earlier. Smith also stated that she would refuse to try\n     the case if her office decided to go forward on any of the charges. Smith\n     conveyed several reasons why the charges against Appellee were without\n     merit. Smith requested that certain information be put in a written submission\n     for her to use in connection with her recommendations.\n\n    Smith “apologized” on behalf of the District Attorney’s Office.\n\n    On October 19, 2012, Appellee’s counsel emailed the written submission to\n     Smith.\n\n    Shortly after the meeting with Smith, the District Attorney’s Office filed a\n     motion to dismiss all charges against Appellee’s wife.\n\n    On October 22, 2012, in response to the email from Appellee’s counsel, Smith\n     stated that even though she was in the middle of a “reevaluation” of the cases\n     against Appellee and his wife (which had already caused Smith to recommend\n     and obtain dismissals against Appellee’s wife), Smith had been removed from\n     the Hill case effective the previous Friday and was reassigned to the animal\n     cruelty unit.\n\n          v. No appellate court in Texas has ever ruled that a trial court erred\n             in conducting a hearing on a defendant’s motion to dismiss charges\n             on the basis they violated his constitutional rights.\n      The dissent is correct in concluding that no appellate court in Texas has ever\n\nruled that a trial court erred in conducting a hearing on a defendant’s motion to\n\ndismiss charges on the basis they violated his constitutional rights. Hill, id. at 38-39;\n\n                                           67\n\fciting State v. Dinur, 383 S.W.3d 695, 698-699 (Tex. App. Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2012, no pet.)

Even when the proffer of evidence was\n\nvery weak and did not establish a colorable claim of a violation, the reviewing court\n\ndid not find that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the hearing in the\n\nfirst instance. See Garcia, id. at 272-274 (In an interference-with-child-custody\n\ncase, the court of appeals rejected a claim of selective prosecution where the entirety\n\nof the proffered and presented evidence was an allegation that another person who\n\nfled to Mexico with a child was not prosecuted).\n\n\n          vi. Texas public policy benefits if trial courts are allowed discretion to\n              determine whether a defendant has made the threshold showing of\n              a colorable claim that the defendant is entitled to a hearing\n      In Texas, persons accused of crimes obtain formal discovery through:\n\n(1) Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 39.14; and (2) motions filed under\n\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and its progeny. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc.\n\nArt. 39.14 (2015). Article 39.14 requires disclosure of offense reports and written\n\nor recorded statements of the defendant or witnesses. Tex. Code Crim. Proc.\n\n39.14(a) (2015). The State, however, need not release its work product, including\n\nthose of the prosecutors or its investigators. Id.\n\n\n\n                                           68\n\f      Under Brady and its progeny, the State must disclose material evidence that\n\nis favorable to the defendant. Failure to do so results in a violation if: (1) regardless\n\nof the prosecutor’s good faith or bad faith, the State failed to disclose evidence; (2)\n\nthe evidence is exculpatory; and (3) the evidence is material to the defense, meaning\n\nthat there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the\n\noutcome of the trial would have been different (i.e., the defense was\n\nprejudiced). Strickler v. Green, 527 U.S. 263, 281-282 (1999); Harm v. State, 183\n\nS.W.3d 403, 406-407 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006) (same); Brady, id. at 87; Moore v.\n\nIllinois, 408 U.S. 786, 794-795 (1972) (same). As the Supreme Court explained in\n\nBrady, disclosure of exculpatory evidence is necessary to: (1) (avoid) “an unfair trial\n\nto the accused”; and (2) “[S]ociety wins not only when the guilty are convicted but\n\nwhen criminal trials are fair; our system of the administration of justice suffers when\n\nany accused is treated unfairly.” Id. at 87.\n\n      However, evidence of selective prosecution is nearly impossible for a\n\ndefendant to obtain through Article 39.14 or Brady because the evidence more than\n\nlikely is in the hands of the prosecutor who is committing the misfeasance. See\n\nWayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 624 (1985) (Marshall, J., dissenting).          As\n\nJustice Marshall noted, “[The] need to develop all relevant facts in the adversary\n\nsystem is both fundamental and comprehensive. The ends of criminal justice would\n\nbe defeated if judgments were to be founded on a partial or speculative presentation\n\n\n                                           69\n\fof the facts.” Id. Justice Marshall also recognized that “...most of the relevant proof\n\nin selective prosecution cases will normally be in the Government's hands.”\n\n      And, because of the seriousness of allegations of selective prosecution,\n\nespecially given that a prosecutor behaving as Watkins did is an affront to the justice\n\nsystem, procedural rules such as limitations of discovery in criminal case should\n\nnever deprive a defendant of the evidence he needs to substantiate a claim of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct. Unfortunately, it is highly unlikely that a prosecutor\n\nwould ever voluntarily disclose evidence of selective prosecution that violates the\n\nConstitution. In fact, if a prosecutor actually made such a disclosure, this would be\n\nproof of “actual vindictiveness,” which is direct evidence of misconduct under\n\nGoodwin, 457 U.S. at 380-381. In such a situation, there would be no need for a trial\n\njudge to exercise her discretion to order an evidentiary hearing.\n\n       It is axiomatic that prosecuting a person because a political ally provided or\n\noffered a bribe undermines the integrity of the criminal justice system. Thus,\n\ndepriving a defendant of discovery and a hearing on a claim of prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct such as the one before this Court is as unjust as depriving a defendant of\n\nBrady evidence.\n\n      Because trial judges are gatekeepers of evidence, allowing them the discretion\n\nto conduct a hearing when a defendant makes a colorable claim of prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct will eliminate this potential for grave injustice. Such a holding issued\n\n\n                                          70\n\fby this Court will not only promote fairness in the criminal justice system, but it is\n\ngood public policy in Texas.\n\n\n         vii.      Most other courts have adopted standards substantially\n             similar to the standard that Appellee argues this Court should\n             adopt: that so long as a defendant attaches a proffer of evidence to\n             a motion to dismiss due to prosecutorial misconduct that the trial\n             court in its discretion determines to present a colorable claim of a\n             constitutional violation, the defendant has attached “some\n             evidence,” and the trial court should have the discretion to conduct\n             a hearing on the motion to dismiss.\n\n      First Circuit: In United States v. Penagaricano-Soler, 911 F.2d 833 (1st Cir.\n\n1990), the court of appeals affirmed the district court’s decision to not conduct a\n\nhearing because the district court concluded that there was no “colorable basis” for\n\nthe selective prosecution claim, and thus the district court refused to order further\n\ndiscovery, and denied the motion to dismiss. Id. at 835-837 (emphasis added). In\n\nso affirming, the court of appeals held that a selective prosecution claim merits an\n\nevidentiary hearing if it alleges sufficient “facts (1) tending to show that [the\n\ndefendant] has been selectively prosecuted, and (2) raising a reasonable doubt about\n\nthe propriety of the prosecution’s purpose, unless the government can present\n\n‘countervailing reasons.’” Id. at 838.\n\n      Second Circuit: In United States v. Fares, 978 F.2d 52 (2d Cir. 1992), the\n\ncourt of appeals held that to warrant discovery with respect to a claim of selective\n\nprosecution, a defendant must present at least “some evidence tending to show the\n\n\n                                         71\n\fexistence of the essential elements of the defense and that the documents in the\n\ngovernment’s possession would indeed be probative of these elements.” Id. at 58\n\n(emphasis added). Mere assertions and generalized proffers on information and\n\nbelief are insufficient. Id. (emphasis added). As an example, the court of appeals\n\ncites United States v. Berrios, 501 F.2d 1207, 1211 (2d Cir. 1974), in which the court\n\nof appeals held that a proffer of evidence stating that defendant and his attorney\n\n“believed” that “there were hundreds” of unprosecuted persons situated similarly to\n\ndefendant was insufficient for lack of identification of any unprosecuted violators or\n\naffiliated organizations. Id. at 58. Thus, absent a showing of “some evidence”\n\ntending to demonstrate the existence of prosecutorial misconduct, a district court is\n\nwell within its discretion to deny a motion for discovery and a hearing on a claim of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct. Id.\n\n      Third Circuit: In United States v. Torquato, 602 F.2d 564 (3d Cir.\n\n1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 941 (1979), the court of appeals held that in order to\n\nobtain a hearing on a claim of prosecutorial misconduct, the defendant must make a\n\nthreshold showing of discriminatory prosecution before an evidentiary hearing will\n\nbe allowed. This threshold showing requires the defendant to prove a “colorable\n\nentitlement” to the claim of selective prosecution. Id. at 570 (emphasis added). The\n\ncourt further explained that a “colorable entitlement” requires the defendant to\n\nprovide “some credible evidence...indicating that the government intentionally and\n\n\n                                         72\n\fpurposefully discriminated against the defendant by failing to prosecute other\n\nsimilarly situated persons.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n      Fourth Circuit: In United States v. Greenwood, 796 F.2d 49 (4th Cir. 1986),\n\nthe court of appeals held that in order to obtain a hearing on a claim of prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct, a defendant must make a “nonfrivolous showing” of both elements of\n\nthe claim. Id. at 52 (emphasis added). A “nonfrivolous showing” is described as\n\nallegations that “...raise at least a legitimate issue of improper governmental\n\nconduct.” Id. Further, in determining whether a legitimate issue has been raised, the\n\ndistrict court may consider the government’s explanation for its conduct. Id. Finally,\n\nupon a “nonfrivolous showing” by the defendant, a trial court is within its discretion\n\nto grant the hearing.\n\n      Sixth Circuit: In United States v. Peete, 919 F.2d 1168 (6th Cir. 1990), the\n\ncourt of appeals affirmed its holding in United States v. Schmucker, 815 F.2d 413,\n\n418 (6th Cir. 1987), in which it held that “ [a] defendant may...be entitled to\n\ndiscovery on the issue of selective prosecution if he introduces some evidence\n\ntending to show the existence of the essential elements of the defense.” Id. at 1177\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n      Seventh Circuit: In United States v. Goulding, 26 F.3d 656 (7th Cir.\n\n1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1061 (1994), the court of appeals held that, to obtain\n\ndiscovery on an allegation of prosecutorial misconduct, a defendant must show there\n\n\n                                          73\n\fis a “colorable basis” for the claim (emphasis added). Id. at 662; see also United\n\nStates v. Heidecke, 900 F.2d 1155, 1159 (7th Cir. 1990) (same).\n\n      Ninth Circuit: In United States v. Armstrong, 48 F.3d 1508, 1512 (9th Cir.\n\n1995), the court of appeals held that a trial court is within its discretion to allow a\n\nhearing for discovery if a defendant presents evidence providing a colorable basis of\n\nselective prosecution. See above.\n\n      Tenth Circuit: In United States v. P.H.E., Inc., 965 F.2d 848 (10th Cir. 1992),\n\nthe court of appeals ruled that in order to obtain a hearing on a claim of prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct, the defendant must show some evidence tending to show the elements.\n\nId. at 860. The court further held, “There is no vindictiveness as long as the\n\nprosecutor’s decision is based upon the normal factors ordinarily considered in\n\ndetermining what course to pursue, rather than upon genuine animus against the\n\ndefendant for an improper reason or in retaliation for exercise of legal or\n\nconstitutional rights.” Id. The court further explained that the scope of a reviewing\n\ncourt’s inquiry must be “whether, as a practical matter, there is a realistic or\n\nreasonable likelihood of prosecutorial conduct that would not have occurred but for\n\nhostility or punitive animus towards the defendant because he exercised his specific\n\nlegal right.” Id.\n\n      Eleventh Circuit: In Jones v. White, 992 F.2d 1548 (11th Cir. 1993), cert.\n\ndenied, 481 U.S. 1055 (1993), the court of appeals held that a defendant may obtain\n\n\n                                          74\n\fan evidentiary hearing on the issue of selective prosecution or other prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct if the defendant “presents facts sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt\n\nabout the prosecutor’s motive.” Id. at 1572.\n\n      D.C. Circuit: In Attorney General of United States v. Irish People, Inc., 684\n\nF.2d 928 (D.C. Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1172 (1983), the court of appeals\n\nheld that a district court in its discretion may require a defendant to make a\n\n“colorable claim” of prosecutorial misconduct before subjecting the government to\n\ndiscovery on the issue. Id. at 947 (emphasis added).\n\n      Appellee notes for this Court that the Eighth Circuit in United States v.\n\nParham, 16 F.3d 844, 846 (8th Cir. 1993) and the Fifth Circuit in United States v.\n\nJohnson, 577 F.2d 1304, 1309 (5th Cir. 1978) held that to obtain a discovery hearing\n\non a claim of prosecutorial misconduct, a defendant must first make a prima facie\n\nshowing that the government acted inappropriately. Although Appellee disagrees\n\nwith the standard set forth by the Fifth and Eight Circuits, Appellee notes that the\n\nanalysis for his case does not change, as Appellee not only attached “some evidence”\n\nshowing a constitutional violation, but in fact attached “exceptionally clear\n\nevidence” that constitutes a prima facie case of prosecutorial misconduct. Still,\n\nAppellee asks this Court to not adopt this standard for Texas.\n\n\n\n\n                                         75\n\f         viii.     This Court should affirm the trial court’s order dismissing\n             the indictments because the evidence obtained during the March 7,\n             2013 hearing overwhelmingly proved that: (1) Watkins singled out\n             Appellee for prosecution and has not proceeded against others\n             similarly situated based on the type of conduct for which Appellee\n             was charged; and (2) Watkins’s discriminatory selection was\n             invidious and resulted from allowing himself to be improperly\n             influenced by Blue.\n      The evidence obtained during the March 7, 2013 hearing is set forth in great\n\ndetail over the span of 20 pages in section VIII above. Appellee will not recount\n\nthose facts here. However, this Court will find that the evidence obtained so\n\noverwhelmingly proved that: (1) Watkins singled out Appellee for prosecution and\n\nhas not proceeded against others similarly situated based on the type of conduct for\n\nwhich Appellee was charged; and (2) Watkins’s discriminatory selection was\n\ninvidious and resulted from allowing himself to be improperly influenced by Blue,\n\nthat this Court should affirm the trial court’s order dismissing the indictments.\n\n\n         ix. Conclusion\n\n      To establish a prima facie case of selective prosecution in violation of the\n\nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and to obtain a hearing under the “presumption\n\nof prosecutorial vindictiveness” method, a defendant must provide “some evidence”\n\nthat shows: (1) the government singled out the defendant for prosecution and has not\n\nproceeded against others similarly situated based on the type of conduct for\n\nwhich the defendant is charged; and (2) the government’s discriminatory selection\n\n\n                                          76\n\fis invidious. Once the defendant makes this showing, the burden shifts to the State\n\nto justify the discriminatory treatment.\n\n      Appellee has shown why this Court should clarify what constitutes “some\n\nevidence” and hold that so long as a defendant attaches a proffer of evidence to a\n\nmotion to dismiss due to prosecutorial misconduct, the trial court in its discretion\n\ndetermines to present a colorable claim of a constitutional violation, the defendant\n\nhas attached “some evidence,” and the trial court should have the discretion to\n\nconduct a hearing on the motion to dismiss. Appellee has also shown why this Court\n\nshould find that Appellee not only attached “some evidence” showing a\n\nconstitutional violation, but in fact attached “exceptionally clear evidence.”\n\n      Appellee has also shown this Court that the Court of Appeals erred when it:\n\n(1) sustained the State’s second issue and concluded that Appellee “did not make the\n\nproper showing sufficient to establish a prima facie case...” of the fact that the former\n\nelected district attorney of Dallas County engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by\n\nallowing himself to be corruptly influenced by a political ally in return for indicting\n\nAppellee; (2) found that the trial court erred in conducting a hearing on Appellee’s\n\nmotion to dismiss based upon prosecutorial misconduct; (3) vacated the trial court’s\n\nOrder Granting Motion to Dismiss; and (4) remanded the case to the trial court to\n\nreinstate the indictments against Appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                                           77\n\f      As a result, (1) the decision of the Court of Appeals conflicts with another\n\ncourt of appeals’ decision on the same issue; (2) the Court of Appeals has decided\n\nan important question of state or federal law that has not been, but should be, settled\n\nby the Court of Criminal Appeals; (3) the Court of Appeals has decided an important\n\nquestion of state or federal law in a way that conflicts with the applicable decisions\n\nof the Court of Criminal Appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States; (4) the\n\nCourt of Appeals misconstrued a rule; and (5) the justices of the Court of Appeals\n\nhave disagreed on a material question of law necessary to the court’s decision. See\n\nTex. Rule App. Proc. 66.3 (2015).\n\n\nXI. Conclusion and Prayer\n\n      For the reasons stated in this Brief, Appellee respectfully prays that this Court\n\nreverse the judgment and opinion of the Court of Appeals, find that Appellee\n\nprovided “some evidence” constituting a colorable claim that allowed the trial court\n\nto exercise its discretion to order a hearing, and affirm the trial court’s Order\n\nGranting Motion to Dismiss.\n\n                                        Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n                                          78\n\fGeorge R.

A judge’s decision to hold an evidentiary hearing is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Tex.\nCode Crim. Proc.

And while a trial judge may dismiss an indictment where\nconstitutional protections are not observed, the dismissal of an indictment is a drastic measure only to\nbe used in the most extraordinary circumstances. A trial judge’s limited authority to dismiss an\nindictment stems in part from the fact that the decision of whether to prosecute is a core executive\nconstitutional function. Because this power is within the province of the State, the State enjoys\nconsiderable discretion in deciding whether or not to prosecute and what charge to file or bring to the\ngrand jury. That means courts presume the State exercised its prosecutorial responsibilities in good\nfaith and in compliance with the Constitution. The burden on the defendant to show that a particular\nprosecutorial decision was predicated on constitutionally impermissible grounds is high, requiring him\nto prove his claim with clear evidence.\n\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Commencement of Criminal Proceedings > Counsel > Prosecutors\n  Evidence > ... > Presumptions > Particular Presumptions > Regularity\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Burdens of Proof\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Commencement of Criminal Proceedings > Counsel > Prosecutors\n  Evidence > ... > Presumptions > Particular Presumptions > Regularity\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Burdens of Proof\n\n                                                Page 2 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *1\n\n\n\nHN3 The significance of the presumption courts afford prosecutors carries over to a defendant’s\nrequest for an evidentiary hearing or discovery. That is, in light of the presumption of prosecutorial\nregularity, a defendant who claims his constitutional rights were violated by some form of\nprosecutorial misconduct must make out a prima facie case of his claims before he is entitled to an\nevidentiary hearing or discovery. To do this, a defendant must present facts sufficient to create a\nreasonable doubt about the constitutionality of his prosecution. The facts required to cast doubt about\nthe constitutionality of the prosecution and to rebut the presumption the State acted in good faith such\nthat a person is entitled to an evidentiary hearing (or even discovery) must be more than allegations.\nRather, a defendant’s factual allegations must be accompanied by evidence that tends to establish his\nconstitutional claims. Indeed, the standard for obtaining discovery on claims like selective or\nvindictive prosecution requires some evidence tending to show the existence of the essential elements\nof the claimed violations. This standard is rigorous and complements the rigorous standard for proving\nconstitutional violations in the decision to prosecute.\n\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Tests for Prosecutorial Misconduct\n  Constitutional Law > ... > Fundamental Rights > Procedural Due Process > Scope of Protection\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Tests for Prosecutorial Misconduct\n  Constitutional Law > ... > Fundamental Rights > Procedural Due Process > Scope of Protection\n\nHN4 The absence of an impartial and disinterested prosecutor can violate a defendant’s due process\nrights. Partiality in this context is like a conflict of interest in the sense that the prosecutor has a\npersonal interest or stake in the outcome of the criminal prosecution. It also refers to any interest that\nconflicts with the prosecutor’s duty to seek justice. Thus, the due process rights of a defendant are\nviolated when a prosecuting attorney who has a conflict of interest relevant to the defendant’s case\nprosecutes the defendant. The mere potential or perceived conflict of interest is not sufficient to\nestablish a due process violation. Similarly, mere allegations of wrongdoing do not suffice.\n\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Selective & Vindictive Prosecution\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Burdens of Proof\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Selective & Vindictive Prosecution\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Burdens of Proof\n\nHN5 ″Prosecutorial vindictiveness″ refers to a situation in which the State acts against a defendant by\nbringing criminal charges in retaliation for the defendant’s exercise of his legal rights. A prosecutorial\naction is vindictive if it is designed to penalize a defendant for invoking legally protected rights. A\ndefendant may demonstrate prosecutorial vindictiveness by showing actual vindictiveness, which\nrequires him to present objective evidence of the violation. Or, in certain circumstances, the defendant\nmay rely on a presumption of vindictiveness, which requires him to present facts showing the realistic\nlikelihood of vindictiveness, forcing the State to present objective evidence justifying the prosecutorial\naction. There is no presumption of vindictiveness if in the context of the entire proceedings any\nobjective event or combination of events in those proceedings should indicate to a reasonable minded\ndefendant that the prosecutor’s decision was motivated by some purpose other than a vindictive desire\nto deter or punish. Even if the defendant establishes a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness, the State\nstill has an opportunity to proffer legitimate, objective reasons for its conduct.\n\n                                                Page 3 of 29\n\f                                     2014 Tex.

A selective-prosecution claim draws on ordinary equal protection standards and\nrequires a defendant to prove the existence of purposeful discrimination. To make out a prima facie\ncase, the defendant must first show that he has been singled out for prosecution while others similarly\nsituated and committing the same acts have not been prosecuted. He must also show that the State’s\ndiscriminatory selection of him for prosecution was invidious or in bad faith.\n\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Burdens of Proof\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Selective & Vindictive Prosecution\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Burdens of Proof\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Selective & Vindictive Prosecution\n\nHN8 There is an evidentiary threshold that must be met by the defendant before he is entitled to an\nevidentiary hearing on his claims that he was prosecuted in violation of his constitutional rights. That\nburden requires a defendant to do more than make unsupported allegations or speculative inferences\nabout an improper motive. Stated another way, before a defendant gets to make inquiries into the\nState’s decision to prosecute, the defendant must support his allegations with evidence that tends to\nestablish his constitutional claims. A defendant may demonstrate prosecutorial vindictiveness by\nshowing actual vindictiveness, which requires him to present objective evidence of the violation. Or,\nin certain circumstances, the defendant may rely on a presumption of vindictiveness, which requires\nhim to present facts showing the realistic likelihood of vindictiveness, forcing the State to present\nobjective evidence justifying the prosecutorial action. There is no presumption of vindictiveness if in\nthe context of the entire proceedings any objective event or combination of events in those proceedings\nshould indicate to a reasonable minded defendant that the prosecutor’s decision was motivated by\nsome purpose other than a vindictive desire to deter or punish.\n\nCounsel: for appellants: Michael R.

Bridges, J.,\ndissenting.\n\nOpinion by: ADA BROWN\n\nOpinion\n\nOpinion by Justice Brown\n\nOn March 31, 2011, a Dallas grand jury returned multiple indictments against Albert G. Hill III and\nhis wife for the offenses of making a false statement to obtain property or credit and securing execution\nof a document by deception.1 The charges allegedly arose out of the Hills’ procurement of a $500,000\nhome-equity loan in 2009. The State later dismissed the charges against Hill’s wife and continued to\nprosecute the cases against Hill. In a motion filed shortly after the dismissal of his wife’s charges, Hill\nsought to quash and dismiss the indictments against him, alleging he was the victim of various forms\nof prosecutorial misconduct in violation of his constitutional rights. Alternatively, he asked for an\nevidentiary hearing and discovery to develop the issues presented in his motion. Over the State’s\nobjections, the trial judge determined that Hill met his initial burden of proof related to his\nconstitutional [*2] claims and therefore was entitled to a hearing ″to try to prove″ his allegations. After\nthe judge held a hearing, the judge signed an order dismissing the indictment in each case with\nprejudice.\n\nThe State appeals that order. In its first two issues, the State challenges the propriety of the evidentiary\nhearing, arguing that Hill was not entitled to such a hearing because he failed to provide evidence to\nestablish a constitutional violation. In its third and fourth issues, the State challenges the trial judge’s\n(1) dismissal of the indictments based on the Dallas County District Attorney’s refusal to testify at the\nhearing and (2) decision to dismiss the indictments with prejudice.\n\nWe agree with the State that the trial judge erred in conducting an evidentiary hearing on Hill’s motion\nto quash and dismiss the indictments because Hill did not make the necessary showing related to his\nconstitutional claims. Accordingly, we vacate the trial judge’s order dismissing the indictments in these\ncases and remand the cases to the trial court with instructions to reinstate the indictments against Hill.\n\nI.\n\nA. Hill’s Allegations of Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\nHill [*3] sought pretrial dismissal of the indictments based on alleged violations of his constitutional\nrights to due process and equal protection. He first alleged that his due process rights were violated\nbecause the Dallas County District Attorney, Craig Watkins, was not disinterested in the prosecution\nof him but rather was operating under the influence of Hill’s father, who was adverse to Hill in\ncontested litigation involving a multi-billion dollar family trust, and Lisa Baron Blue, a close friend\nand political patron of Watkins. Hill argued Watkins’s decision to present the cases to the grand jury\nwas influenced by the payment of political contributions. Hill also alleged that a due process violation\n1\n     See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. §§ 32.32(b), 32.46(a) (West 2011).\n\n                                                            Page 5 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *3\n\n\n\noccurred because Watkins’s decision to prosecute him was vindictive, asserting that the State brought\nthe charges in retaliation for Hill having exercised his right to petition the civil courts. His third\nallegation was that he was selectively prosecuted in violation of his equal protection rights.\nHill based his allegations of prosecutorial misconduct on a series of ″facts″ that he presented in his\nmotion. Hill stated that it was his father’s lawyer, Michael Lynn, who filed the complaint [*4] with the\nDA’s office accusing Hill and his wife of mortgage fraud. The complaint was submitted to the DA’s\noffice in February 2010, while the trust litigation was still pending and days after Hill’s father received\nan adverse ruling in that case. The next month, Watkins received a series of campaign donations from\nJeffrey Tillotson, a law partner at Lynn’s firm. Hill asserted that neither Tillotson nor anyone at that\nfirm had previously donated to Watkins’s campaigns. The donations totaled $48,500, with the last\ndonation made five months before the Hills were indicted.\nHill also asserted that the mortgage-fraud allegations were ″highly unusual″ because the home-equity\nloan was not in default and was repaid in full shortly after the loan was obtained. According to Hill,\nthe lender did not suffer a loss and had not complained about any wrongdoing. In addition, Hill claimed\nthe DA’s office did not conduct a standard investigation because it failed to interview certain\nwitnesses. Nor did the DA’s office notify him that indictments were being considered despite Hill’s\nclaim that the DA’s office had a policy of providing notice and giving the accused’s lawyers an\nopportunity to address the [*5] grand jury before charges are presented.\nHill further complained that the timing of the indictments was suspect. In particular, Hill claimed the\nindictments were returned two weeks before the Hills were to begin trial in a fee dispute with the\nlawyers that represented them in the trust litigation, one of whom was Blue. Hill explained that after\nthe trust litigation settled, the Hills contested the amount of attorneys’ fees sought by Blue and the\nother lawyers. The lawyers filed suit, maintaining the Hills owed over $50 million in attorneys’ fees.\nHill stated that because of the pending indictments, the Hills asserted their Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst self-incrimination and did not testify in the fee-dispute litigation.\nHill emphasized that Blue exchanged numerous phone calls and text messages with Watkins and his\nassistant in the weeks before the indictments were returned. Hill also pointed out that Blue donated\nmoney to Watkins’s campaign and held a social event at her home to raise money for the campaign\nduring that same time frame. Hill alleged that the pattern of phone calls and text messages between\nBlue and Watkins revealed a ″dramatic spike″ in communications in the weeks before the indictments\n [*6] were returned and that the ″heated exchange of calls″ between Blue and Watkins ended after the\nindictments were announced. Further, in a deposition conducted after the conclusion of the fee-dispute\ntrial, Hill claimed that Blue admitted that two of those phone calls from Watkins were about the\nindictments before the indictments were returned. Hill also claimed that during Blue’s representation\nof the Hills in the trust litigation, Blue ″bragged″ to him about her relationship with Watkins. Hill\nstressed that this was not ″idle bragging″ and that Blue has a ″very close personal, professional and\npolitical relationship″ with Watkins as represented by Blue’s status as one of Watkins’s largest\nindividual donors, Blue’s pro bono representation of Watkins in connection with an unrelated lawsuit,\nBlue’s $100,000 donation to SMU law school to create a scholarship in Watkins’s name, and the fact\nthat Watkins hired Blue and another attorney to represent Dallas County in a contingent-fee suit.\nHill finally claimed that the DA’s office ″apologized″ to the Hills on behalf of the DA’s office, and\nhe proclaimed that with the dismissal of the charges against his wife, the office ″effectively\n                                                 Page 6 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *6\n\n\n\nacknowledge[ed] the wrongfulness [*7] of those charges.″ According to Hill, the Hills’ defense\ncounsel met with Assistant District Attorney Deborah Smith in October 2012. Hill maintained that\nduring that meeting, Smith ″expressed significant concerns″ about the charges and ″stated that she\nwould refuse to try the case if the DA’s Office decided to go forward on any of the charges.″ Hill also\nmaintained that Smith said that based on her re-evaluation of the cases, she decided to recommend\ndismissing certain charges against the Hills and was conducting due-diligence interviews related to the\nremaining charges. Shortly after the meeting, Smith communicated that she was reassigned to another\ndivision. Hill called this ″remarkable news″ given that Smith was in the middle of her re-evaluation\nof the charges against the Hills.\nHill argued the circumstances presented by these ″facts″ constitute ″clear and appalling″ violations of\nhis constitutional rights and establish that the DA’s office served as a ″stalking horse″ for the interests\nof (1) Hill’s father, who Hill maintained reported the allegations of mortgage fraud in retaliation for\nhis ″exercise of his constitutional rights in the trust litigation″; (2) Lynn, who submitted [*8] the\nmortgage-fraud allegations to the DA’s office and whose law partner donated $48,500 to Watkins’s\ncampaign; and (3) Blue, Watkins’s friend and generous campaign contributor, who was seeking\nmillions of dollars in attorneys’ fees from the Hills at the time the indictments were returned. Hill\nmaintained that the charges ″had the desired effect″ by impairing the Hills’ ability ″to exercise their\nconstitutional rights to defend themselves″ in the fee-dispute litigation involving Blue.\n\nB. Hill’s Proffer of Evidence in Support of His Motion\nAs support, Hill attached forty-four exhibits to his motion, most of which were unauthenticated or not\notherwise identified by affidavit testimony. Those exhibits included what appeared to be a page from\nLynn’s February 2010 complaint, various pleadings, excerpts from Watkins’s campaign finance\nreports, e-mail exchanges among counsel in the trust litigation, Blue’s telephone records, a log of text\nmessages between Blue and Watkins and his assistant, announcements about the SMU scholarship\nfunded by Blue and about Watkins’s hiring of Blue to help in unrelated litigation, a printout of a 2007\nTexas Lawyer article about the office’s grand jury policy, and [*9] Smith’s e-mail about her\nreassignment. Hill also attached what appeared to be excerpts from (1) transcripts in the fee-dispute\nlitigation related to the Hills’ request for a continuance and their assertion of their Fifth Amendment\nprivilege and (2) deposition testimony from (a) Blue in the fee-dispute litigation in which she testified\nto receiving two phone calls from Watkins about the indictments of the Hills and (b) Blue’s co-counsel\nin the trust litigation, Stephen Malouf, who testified to overhearing one of those conversations.\n\nC. The State’s Response to Hill’s Motion\nThe State filed a brief opposing the motion to quash and dismiss the indictments. The State argued the\ntrial judge lacked the authority to grant Hill’s motion because Hill failed to prove any constitutional\nviolation. The State also emphasized that Hill’s prosecution was not ″the product of a favored and\ndiscontented campaign donor’s audience with the District Attorney.″ Rather, the State asserted that the\ninvestigation into the offense began with the letter from Lynn, was investigated by an experienced\nprosecutor, and the decision to pursue charges against Hill was not unusual or exceptional given that\nthe Specialized Crime Division [*10] of the DA’s office regularly prosecutes cases like Hill’s.\nThe State supported its opposition with various exhibits, including the affidavits of Assistant District\nAttorneys Donna Strittmatter and Stephanie Martin. Strittmatter testified that as the assigned\n\n                                                 Page 7 of 29\n\f                                                 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *10\n\n\n\nprosecutor within the Specialized Crime Division, she received Lynn’s February 2010 complaint and\nsupporting documents, alleging numerous fraudulent acts committed by Hill in connection with a loan\ntransaction. Strittmatter assigned the case to Martin to conduct an investigation. Martin testified that\nshe personally investigated the allegations against Hill and her investigation included receiving large\nvolumes of documents from the bank and title company. Martin also obtained deposition testimony of\nHill and others, and she spoke to legal counsel from the bank. Strittmatter confirmed that Martin\ninvestigated the case for several months and provided updates to her as Martin reviewed the evidence.\n\nMartin also testified that the Specialized Crime Division within the DA’s office regularly prosecutes\ncrimes similar to those alleged to have been committed by Hill. She explained that many of the\nindictments the division obtains for the [*11] same crime involve property or credit valued at $200,000\nor more. She said she personally prosecuted four mortgage-fraud cases involving circumstances where\nno loss was suffered.\n\nBoth Strittmatter and Martin testified that they did not have a practice of notifying a suspect that he\nis the target of a criminal investigation. Martin also stated that it was not her practice to provide a\nsuspect with an opportunity to be heard by the grand jury before indictment. Both also testified that\nthey were unaware of the fee-dispute litigation between Blue and the Hills.\n\nD. The Trial Judge Sets the Motion to Dismiss for a Hearing\n\nIn advance of the hearing on his motion, Hill served subpoenas on various individuals from the DA’s\noffice, including Watkins, Moore, Martin, and Strittmatter. He also served subpoenas on Blue, Malouf,\nand Charla Aldous, who was Blue’s other co-counsel representing the Hills in the trust litigation. The\nState responded with motions to quash the subpoenas, raising procedural objections and arguing,\namong other things, that Hill was not entitled to seek information from the individuals because Hill’s\nmotion to quash and dismiss the indictments was invalid. The State argued [*12] that Hill’s motion did\nnot allege (1) that Watkins placed Hill in an arbitrary classification in determining whether to indict\nhim, (2) any cognizable retaliation by Watkins, or (3) any alleged exercise of Hill’s legal rights. The\nState also stressed that Hill did not ″even allege a lack of objective basis to indict.″ The State\nmaintained that because these infirmities were fatal to Hill’s motion to quash and dismiss the\nindictments, the State could not be burdened to comply with Hill’s subpoenas.\n\nE. The Trial Judge Grants Hill an Evidentiary Hearing\n\nThe trial judge heard argument on Hill’s motion on February 14, 2013. Although the judge stated that\nshe did not ″understand how [Hill was] gonna get there″ based on the type of evidence Hill explained\nwould be ″elicit[ed]″ and would ″come out″ in the examinations of Watkins and Blue, she granted Hill\nthe ″right to have a hearing to try to prove to the Court that this case was handled differently from any\nother case″ that would come before the DA. The judge also determined that Hill presented prima facie\nevidence of his claims and that he had a ″right to make inquiries″ to ″make [his] case.″2\n2\n    At the time she made this determination, the judge had Hill’s [*13] motion plus the attachments to his motion, the State’s opposition\nto Hill’s motion, which included various attachments and the affidavits of Strittmatter and Martin, and Hill’s brief in reply. The judge\nalso had the various motions to quash the subpoenas served by Hill, Hill’s opposition to those motions, and an affidavit, dated February\n12, 2013, filed by Blue in support of her motion for protective order regarding the subpoena to appear at the hearing.\n\n                                                               Page 8 of 29\n\f                                                2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *13\n\n\n\nThe State asked the judge for time to appeal the ruling, arguing that Hill was not entitled to a hearing\nat this point because he failed to establish a prima facie case for his constitutional claims. The State\nfurther objected to the hearing on the basis that Hill was trying to develop evidence that he did not\nhave. The judge overruled the State’s objections. The State also sought mandamus relief from this\nCourt and a stay of the hearing from the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. In its mandamus petition,\nthe State complained, among other things, about the judge’s finding that Hill established a prima facie\ncase.\nThe trial judge conducted an evidentiary hearing related to Hill’s motion to quash and dismiss the\nindictments while the State’s [*14] requests for relief were pending. On March 7, 2013, the judge\nsigned the order dismissing the indictments with prejudice on the basis that Hill had been denied ″his\nright to a full and fair hearing on his motion″ due to Watkins’s refusal to testify at the hearing. We\nultimately dismissed the State’s petition for writ of mandamus as moot on April 2, 2013.3\n\nII.\n\nThe State’s first two issues relate to the trial judge’s decision to hold an evidentiary hearing. HN1\nWhile we ordinarily defer to a trial judge’s decision to hold an evidentiary hearing,4 that deference is\ntempered by the legal principles and standards governing evidentiary hearings as outlined below. See,\ne.g., United States v. Webster, 162 F.3d 308, 334 (5th Cir. 1998) (defendant ″not automatically entitled\nto an evidentiary hearing to make the required showing″).\n\nHN2 Generally, a trial judge has only limited authority to dismiss a case without the State’s consent,\nsuch as to remedy a constitutional [*15] violation. State v. Mungia, 119 S.W.3d 814, 816-17 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2003). And while a trial judge may dismiss an indictment where constitutional protections are not\nobserved, ″the dismissal of an indictment is ’a drastic measure only to be used in the most\nextraordinary circumstances.’″ Id. at 817 (quoting State v. Frye, 897 S.W.2d 324, 330 (Tex. Crim. App.\n1995)).\nA trial judge’s limited authority to dismiss an indictment stems in part from the fact that the decision\nof whether to prosecute is a core executive constitutional function. United States v. Armstrong, 517\nU.S. 456, 464-65, 116 S. Ct. 1480, 134 L. Ed. 2d 687 (1996). Because this power is within the province\nof the State, the State enjoys considerable discretion in deciding whether or not to prosecute and what\ncharge to file or bring to the grand jury. Id. at 464 (″In the ordinary case, ’so long as the prosecutor\nhas probable cause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by statute, the decision\nwhether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a grand jury, generally rests entirely\nin his discretion.’″) (quoting Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 364, 98 S. Ct. 663, 54 L. Ed. 2d\n604 (1978)); see also Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607, 105 S. Ct. 1524, 84 L. Ed. 2d 547\n(1985) (recognizing that ″the decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review″); Neal\nv. State, 150 S.W.3d 169, 173 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). As a result of that discretion, our consideration\nof Hill’s claims begins with a ″presumption of regularity.″ Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464 (courts presume\nprosecutors have ″properly discharged their official duties″). That [*16] means we presume the State\n3\n  See In re Watkins, Nos. 05-13-00298-CV, 05-13-00299-CV, 05-13-00300-CV, 05-13-00301-CV, 05-13-00302-CV, 2013 Tex.

The burden on the defendant to show that a particular prosecutorial\ndecision was predicated on constitutionally impermissible grounds is high, requiring him to prove his\nclaim with ″clear evidence.″ Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 465; Webster, 162 F.3d at 334; see also Garcia\nv. State, 172 S.W.3d 270, 274 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2005, no pet.) (stating that an appellant ″claiming\nselective prosecution must come forth with ’exceptionally clear evidence’ that the prosecution was\ninitiated for an improper reason″).\n\nHN3 The significance of the presumption courts afford prosecutors carries over to a defendant’s\nrequest for an evidentiary hearing or discovery. See Webster, 162 F.3d at 334 (″A defendant is not\nautomatically entitled to an evidentiary hearing to make the required showing.″); see also Armstrong,\n517 U.S. at 464 (noting that because prosecutors are afforded a ″background presumption,″ the\nnecessary showing ″to obtain discovery should itself be a significant barrier to the litigation of\ninsubstantial claims″). That is, in light of the presumption of prosecutorial regularity, a defendant who\nclaims his constitutional rights were violated by some form of prosecutorial misconduct must make out\na prima facie case of his claims before he [*17] is entitled to an evidentiary hearing or discovery. See\nIn re United States, 397 F.3d 274, 284 (5th Cir. 2005); Webster, 162 F.3d at 334. To do this, a defendant\nmust ″present facts ’sufficient to create a reasonable doubt about the constitutionality of [his]\nprosecution’ . . . .″ Webster, 162 F.3d at 334 (quoting United States v. Jennings, 724 F.2d 436, 445-46\n(5th Cir. 1984)). The ″facts″ required to cast doubt about the constitutionality of the prosecution and\nto rebut the presumption the State acted in good faith such that a person is entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing (or even discovery) must be more than allegations. See Jennings, 724 F.2d at 445-46 (motion\ncontaining broad, generalized allegations did not offer facts to the court to warrant evidentiary\nhearing); see also Wade v. United States, 504 U.S. 181, 186, 112 S. Ct. 1840, 118 L. Ed. 2d 524 (1992)\n(stating that ″generalized allegations of improper motive″ are not enough to entitle a defendant to a\nremedy, discovery, or evidentiary hearing); United States v. Sanchez, 517 F.3d 651, 671 (2d Cir. 2008)\n(″Generalized allegations of improper motive do not disturb the presumption of regularity.″). Rather,\na defendant’s factual allegations must be accompanied by evidence that tends to establish his\nconstitutional claims. See Jennings, 724 F.2d at 445-46 (after reviewing affidavit and statement offered\nin support of motion to quash, court unable to conclude Jennings presented facts sufficient to create\nreasonable doubt about the selectivity of his prosecution). Indeed, the standard for [*18] obtaining\ndiscovery on claims like selective or vindictive prosecution requires ″some evidence tending to show\nthe existence of the essential elements″ of the claimed violations. Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 468; see also\nIn re United States, 397 F.3d at 284 (prima facie case ″requires the criminal defendant to bring forward\nsome evidence″) (emphasis added). This standard is ″rigorous″ and complements the ″rigorous\nstandard″ for proving constitutional violations in the decision to prosecute. Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 468.\n\nIII.\nIn its first issue, the State complains about the documents Hill proffered with his motion. The State\nargues that Hill needed to present evidence to support his claims before he was entitled to an\nevidentiary hearing and, because Hill ″simply made unsworn allegations″ in his motion and ″attached\na stack of unauthenticated documents″ as exhibits, he basically provided no evidence to support his\nclaims. The State explains that, under Armstrong, the judge had to presume that Watkins acted in good\nfaith until Hill presented clear evidence to the contrary and the presentation of such evidence was a\ncondition that must be met before Hill was entitled to an evidentiary hearing. The State points out that\n\n                                               Page 10 of 29\n\f                                                 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *18\n\n\n\neven the trial judge advised Hill that the ″unauthenticated, [*19] un-introduced documents attached to\nhis motion″ were not evidence.5 Hill responds that the State did not preserve its complaint that Hill’s\nattachments to his motion suffered from authentication or hearsay problems because the State did not\nobject on those bases in the trial court. Hill also asserts the State stipulated to the authenticity and\nadmissibility of the evidence attached to the motion at the March 7 evidentiary hearing.\n\nWhile we are troubled by the unsworn allegations in and authenticity of the documents attached to\nHill’s motion,6 we need not resolve whether the State preserved its complaint about these documents7\nbecause regardless of the contentions the State raised in its first issue, we conclude Hill did not meet\nthe standard required to warrant an evidentiary hearing even when we consider the documents attached\nto Hill’s motion. Before Hill is entitled to an evidentiary hearing, he must make a prima facie showing\nfor his alleged constitutional claims with evidence capable of dispelling [*20] the presumption that the\nprosecution of him was in good faith and in compliance with the Constitution. See Armstrong, 517 U.S.\nat 465; In re United States, 397 F.3d at 284. Hill’s failure to do so means the trial judge erred in\ngranting Hill an evidentiary hearing, which resulted in the dismissal of the indictments. This is the\nState’s second issue.\n\nIV.\n\nThis case came to us with a large record. But in deciding the issue of whether Hill was entitled to an\nevidentiary hearing to try to prove his allegations, there is no need to look beyond what the trial judge\nhad in her hands at the time she decided that Hill met his initial burden of proof related to his\nconstitutional claims. In particular, we consider Hill’s motion and the attached exhibits to determine\nwhether he made a prima facie case for each of [*21] his claims such that he was entitled to an\nevidentiary hearing.\n\nIn his motion to quash and dismiss the indictments, Hill claimed he was deprived of his right to a\ndisinterested prosecutor and that he had been vindictively and selectively prosecuted. As proof of the\nalleged constitutional violations, Hill emphasized the following in his motion: (1) political contributions\nfrom a lawyer associated with Hill’s father in the months after the February 2010 complaint and five\nmonths before the indictments were returned and a donation by Blue less than a month before the\nindictments were returned; (2) that Blue hosted a fundraiser for Watkins in the month before the\nindictments were returned; (3) the ″unusual″ nature of the charges against him; (4) the lack of notice\nto him that indictments were being considered; (5) the suspect timing of the indictments in that they\nwere returned just before the fee-dispute trial involving Blue, which Hill claimed prevented him and\nhis wife from testifying in that trial; (6) the ″heated exchange″ of communications with Watkins and\nhis office in the weeks leading up to the Hills’ indictments and ending after the indictments were\nreturned; (7) Blue’s discussion [*22] about indictments with Watkins in the time before they were\n5\n    The judge’s statement was made at a hearing conducted on March 4, 2013. Specifically, the judge alerted Hill’s defense counsel that\nthe ″exhibits on [Hill’s] motions [were] not evidence.″\n6\n    In our view, the evidence accompanying a motion alleging prosecutorial misconduct must be competent evidence; the evidence must\nbe properly authenticated and in an otherwise admissible format. Affidavits or sworn or other reliable witness statements are appropriate\nto establish a fact.\n7\n    The State argues it had no reason to object before the commencement of the hearing because Hill had not yet offered the documents\nattached to his motion as evidence.\n\n                                                              Page 11 of 29\n\f                                                 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *22\n\n\n\nreturned; (8) Blue’s comment made in her deposition that she would have no reason to discuss\nindictments with Watkins after they were returned; (9) Blue’s close relationship with Watkins; (10)\ndefense counsel’s meeting with Smith about the charges; and (11) the fact that charges against Hill’s\nwife were dismissed. Hill contends on appeal that these facts cast doubt on the constitutionality of the\nprosecution and not only entitle him to an evidentiary hearing but also establish a prima facie showing\nof prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nA. Hill’s Allegation He Was Deprived of the Right to a Disinterested Prosecutor\n\nHill first alleged in his motion that the indictments should be dismissed because he was deprived of\nthe right to a disinterested prosecutor. HN4 The absence of an impartial and disinterested prosecutor\ncan violate a defendant’s due process rights. In re Guerra, 235 S.W.3d 392, 429 (Tex. App.—Corpus\nChristi 2007, orig. proceeding). ″Partiality″ in this context is like ″a conflict of interest in the sense that\nthe prosecutor has a personal interest or stake in the outcome of the criminal prosecution.″ Id. at 430.\nIt also refers to any interest that conflicts with the prosecutor’s duty to seek justice. Id. Thus, the due\n [*23] process rights of a defendant are violated ″when a prosecuting attorney who has a conflict of\ninterest relevant to the defendant’s case prosecutes the defendant.″ Id. at 429. The ″mere potential or\nperceived conflict of interest″ is not sufficient to establish a due process violation. Id. at 430. Similarly,\nmere allegations of wrongdoing do not suffice. Id.\n\nHill alleged in his motion that the influence exercised upon Watkins by Hill’s father, Lynn, and Blue\ndeprived him of due process. He explained that Watkins had ″a financial stake in the prosecution of\nthe Hills″ because indicting them benefited Blue (who was involved in a dispute with the Hills over\nattorneys’ fees) and Tillotson (who also was a major campaign contributor), ″which in turn benefited″\nWatkins. Hill claimed Blue’s influence and involvement with the indictment process were demonstrated\nby Blue’s two telephone conversations with Watkins before the indictments were returned and the\npattern of phone calls and text messages exchanged between Blue and Watkins (and others in the DA’s\noffice) in the weeks before the indictments were returned.\n\nWe disagree with Hill’s assertion that his motion and attachments demonstrate that Watkins’s decision\n [*24] to prosecute Hill was influenced by any wrongdoing. The documents submitted with Hill’s\nmotion show that Blue represented Watkins on a pro bono matter and that she is friends with him and\nothers in the DA’s office. She testified in her deposition that she received a phone call from Watkins\n″shortly before the indictments came down.″ Her recollection of the phone call was that Watkins said\n″one or two sentences about the indictments,″ something like, ″there could be an indictment or are you\nstill interested in the indictments.″ She testified that she responded by telling Watkins that she did not\nrepresent the Hills and ″it would be inappropriate for [her] to talk about it.″ Blue added that she later\nreceived another phone call from Watkins during which Watkins ″mentioned the Hills.″ Blue reminded\nWatkins that she no longer represented the Hills so there was nothing she could talk about.8 Her\nrecollection of her response to Watkins about the indictments was affirmed by Malouf, who testified\n8\n    In the February 12, 2013 affidavit [*25] Blue filed in support of her motion for protective order regarding the subpoena to appear\nat the hearing, Blue testified that after she no longer represented the Hills, she received two phone calls from Watkins wherein ″at the\nvery beginning of the conversations, District Attorney Watkins used the word ’Hill’ or ″Hills″ (and in one of the conversations I recall\nhe also used the word ’indictment’ or ’indict’).″ She testified that ″[o]n both occasions, [she] immediately stopped the conversation and\ntold Mr. Watkins that [she] no longer represented [Hill or his wife] and could not talk to Mr. Watkins about the Hills.″\n\n                                                              Page 12 of 29\n\f                                                 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *25\n\n\n\nin his deposition that he overheard Blue tell Watkins that she no longer represented the Hills, so she\ncould not talk to him about the investigation of the Hills.\n\nHill maintained that Blue’s testimony about the two phone calls was not credible and reflected\nimproper communications between Watkins and his friend and political contributor. He further claimed\nthere could be ″no benign explanation″ for Watkins to call Blue about the indictments or the Hills\nduring a time when Blue was involved in a fee dispute with them. But before testifying about the phone\ncalls, Blue also described a meeting she had with Assistant District Attorney Terri Moore when she still\nrepresented the Hills. Blue said she discussed the potential for charges against [*26] the Hills with\nMoore and explained that she told Moore that this ″was a family fight.″9 Hill’s motion does not\nmention this meeting.\n\nOther than the two phones calls testified to by Blue, Hill presented nothing to show the substance of\nthe text messages or other phone calls exchanged between Blue and Watkins in the time leading up to\nthe indictments. Hill’s arguments about their content amount to speculation. Absent evidence regarding\nthe substances of the communications, Hill’s characterization about the timing of the text messages and\nphone calls does not necessarily suggest the communications were related to the indictments [*27] as\nopposed to other legitimate purposes. Again, Hill emphasized throughout his motion that Blue had a\npersonal and professional relationship with Watkins for many years. It is possible their communications\nencompassed a multitude of topics. Because of that relationship, contact with Watkins cannot be\nconsidered unusual.10\n\nSimilarly, other than Hill’s speculation that the timing of Blue’s campaign donations and fundraiser\nwere suspect, Hill did not present any evidence that Blue’s status as a political patron related to the\nindictments. As Hill pointed out in his motion, Blue had been a contributor and supporter of Watkins\nsince 2007, well before her fee dispute with Hill. Hill also emphasized that Watkins announced his\nre-election campaign in Blue’s house in November 2009. But this merely supports the fact that Blue\nhad a long-term relationship with Watkins, not that Blue’s political contributions related [*28] to the\nindictments. In fact, Blue’s representation of the Hills in the trust litigation did not begin until\nNovember 2009. Further, Hill’s accusation that Tillotson’s campaign contributions in 2010 influenced\nWatkins’s decision to prosecute Hill is not supported by any evidence.\n\nB. Hill’s Allegation He Was Vindictively Prosecuted\n\nHill also sought dismissal of the indictments on the ground that the prosecution was initiated in\nretaliation for having exercised his right to petition the civil court in two cases: the trust litigation and\nthe fee-dispute trial. HN5 ″Prosecutorial vindictiveness″ refers to a situation in which the State acts\nagainst a defendant by bringing criminal charges ″in retaliation for the defendant’s exercise of his legal\n9\n   Blue testified to her meeting with Moore in her February 12 affidavit. Specifically, Blue testified that in the meeting with Moore, she\nrecommended that the Hills not be indicted. She described Moore as ″non-committal″ and testified that Moore provided no response to\nthe recommendation. Blue also testified that she first learned the DA’s office was investigating the Hills by reading a May 2010 D\nMagazine article. She said she later learned about the formal complaint sent by Lynn in February 2010 and clarified that she did not\nparticipate in preparing that complaint.\n10\n    Hill also claimed that the communications ceased ″almost completely in the days and weeks″ after the indictments were publicly\nannounced. But the phone records attached to Hill’s motion end on April 30, 2011. Hill does not provide any records after that date to\nsupport this allegation.\n\n                                                              Page 13 of 29\n\f                                                  2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *28\n\n\n\nrights.″ Neal, 150 S.W.3d at 173. A prosecutorial action is vindictive if it is designed to ″penalize a\ndefendant for invoking legally protected rights.″ United States v. Meyer, 810 F.2d 1242, 1245, 258 U.S.\nApp. D.C. 263 (D.C. Cir. 1987).\n\nA defendant may demonstrate prosecutorial vindictiveness by showing actual vindictiveness, which\nrequires him to present objective evidence of the violation. United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368,\n380-81, 102 S. Ct. 2485, 73 L. Ed. 2d 74 & n.19 (1982); Neal, 150 S.W.3d at 173; see also United\nStates v. Saltzman, 537 F.3d 353, 359 (5th Cir. 2008). Or, in certain circumstances, the defendant may\nrely on a presumption of vindictiveness, which requires him to present facts showing the realistic\nlikelihood [*29] of vindictiveness, forcing the State to present objective evidence justifying the\nprosecutorial action. Meyer, 810 F.2d at 1245; see also Neal, 150 S.W.3d at 173; United States v.\nCooper, 461 F.3d 850, 856 (7th Cir. 2006) (To create doubt regarding prosecutorial motivations before\ntrial, the defendant ″must affirmatively show through objective evidence that the prosecutorial conduct\nat issue was motivated by some form of prosecutorial animus, such as a personal stake in the outcome\nof the case or an attempt to seek self-vindication.″).11\n\nIn his motion, Hill argued that for a claim for vindictive prosecution, he was required to show that (1)\n″the prosecutor harbored genuine animus toward the defendant, or was prevailed upon to bring the\ncharges by another with animus such that the prosecutor could be considered a ’stalking horse’″ and\n(2) ″he would not have been prosecuted except for the animus.″ United States v. Koh, 199 F.3d 632,\n640 (2d Cir. 1999). Hill alleged that the decision to prosecute him was prompted by his father’s anger\nafter receiving an adverse ruling in the trust litigation and by the animus of Blue in the fee-dispute\nlitigation. He also maintained that the\n\n     timing, circumstances, and unusual if not unprecedented nature of the Hill indictments make\n     abundantly clear that the real motivation of these indictments was to benefit [Watkins’s]\n     prolific campaign contributor [his father’s lawyer’s law partner], and to assist [Watkins’s]\n     friend and benefactor, [Blue] by impairing the Hills’ ability to contest [Blue’s] enormous fee\n     claims.\n\nHe claimed such animus was demonstrated by the improprieties inherent in the indictments [*31] (such\nas his denial of any pre-indictment notice or opportunity to be heard by the grand jury), the\n″unprecedented nature″ of the charges, and Hill’s belief that the DA’s office did not conduct a thorough\ninvestigation before indicting him.\n\nThat the decision to prosecute was prompted by his father’s anger is not supported by any evidence\nin the record. Hill’s argument speculates as to the motivations of his father’s attorney in sending the\nDA’s office the February 2010 complaint and of the timing of the law partner’s donations to Watkins’s\n11\n     The parties dispute whether the presumption of vindictiveness applies at this stage in the case; they argue there is a distinction drawn\nbetween pretrial and post-trial prosecutorial vindictiveness. We will assume without deciding that it does because Hill did not provide\nany direct proof of vindictiveness or sufficient circumstantial proof to warrant a presumption of vindictiveness. ″There is no presumption\nof vindictiveness if in the context of the entire proceedings ’any objective event or combination of events in those proceedings should\nindicate to a reasonable minded defendant that the prosecutor’s decision . . . was motivated by some purpose other than a vindictive desire\nto deter or punish . . . .’″ Saltzman, 537 F.3d at 360 (quoting United States v. Wells, 262 F.3d 455, 466-67 (5th Cir. 2001)). Again, even\nif the defendant establishes [*30] a ″realistic likelihood of vindictiveness,″ the State ″still has an opportunity to proffer legitimate,\nobjective reasons for its conduct.″ Id. (citing Goodwin, 457 U.S. at 374).\n\n                                                                Page 14 of 29\n\f                                                 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *31\n\n\n\ncampaign, but this speculation is not evidence of genuine animus. See, e.g., United States v. Bucci, 582\nF.3d 108, 114 (1st Cir. 2009) (noting that HN6 ″evidence of suspicious timing alone does not indicate\nprosecutorial animus″) (quoting Cooper, 461 F.3d at 856). Nor does it support an allegation that he\n″would not have been prosecuted except for the animus.″ Koh, 199 F.3d at 640.\nIn addition, Hill proffered no actual evidence related to improprieties inherent in the indictments, his\nclaim about the ″unusual″ or ″unprecedented″ nature of the charges, or his belief that the indictments\nwere not thoroughly investigated. Hill’s only attempt at proving he was denied notice of the possible\ncharges and access to the grand jury was by attaching an unauthenticated [*32] 2007 article that\ndescribed the DA’s office having such a policy. Hill did not present any evidence that such notice and\naccess was actually the policy of the DA’s office or its specialized crime division at the time or that\nnotice or that grand jury access had been provided to other defendants but denied as to him. Martin,\na specialized crime prosecutor, stated in her affidavit that her regular practice did not include providing\nnotice to an accused of a contemplated charge. Further, the record showed that the Hills knew about\nthe potential for indictments. In May 2010, while Blue still represented the Hills in the trust litigation,\nD Magazine published an article questioning whether the DA’s office would go after the Hills for\nmortgage fraud.12 Blue testified in her deposition that after she learned about the potential\ninvestigation, she met with Moore and recommended that the Hills not be indicted.\n\nAlthough Hill alleged that Smith communicated her ″concerns″ about the [*33] charges during a\nconversation with his counsel, he provided no evidence to show that any statements were actually\nmade by Smith. Moreover, other evidence in the record shows that the DA’s office did, in fact,\ninvestigate the allegations. For example, in seeking a continuance in the fee-dispute litigation after the\nindictments were returned, counsel for the Hills stated that the DA’s office was producing ″thousands\nof pages″ of criminal discovery that needed review before the Hills could assess their position in the\nfee-dispute trial. In her affidavit filed with the State’s response to Hill’s motion, Martin also attested\nto the scope of her investigation, which spanned several months and included receiving documents\nfrom various sources and talking to the bank’s legal counsel.\nFinally, Hill claimed that the DA’s office was motivated to bring charges to impair the Hills’ ability\nto contest Blue’s fee claims in the fee-dispute litigation as a way to curry favor with a political\ncontributor. Yet the record shows that the federal judge in the fee-dispute litigation would not have\nbeen asked to draw a negative inference to the extent that the Hills were forced to invoke their Fifth\nAmendment privilege. [*34] The federal judge also recognized that because extensive discovery\nincluding depositions had already occurred before the indictments were returned, the ″horse [was]\nalready out of the barn.″\nIn short, other than Hill’s belief that the DA’s office served as a ″stalking horse″ for others, Hill\npresented no evidence to support his conclusion and could only speculate as to the nature of the\nmortgage-fraud charges and how the charges were investigated within the DA’s office. Hill’s\nspeculation is not evidence of vindictive prosecution. Cf. Bucci, 582 F.3d at 114 (″To obtain discovery,\n[the defendant] must do more than simply ’identify a potential motive for prosecutorial animus’″; ″[h]e\nmust connect any vindictive animus to those making the challenged charging decisions in his case.″)\n(quoting United States v. Sanders, 211 F.3d 711, 718 (2d Cir. 2000)).\n12\n     In the February 14, 2013 hearing, counsel for the Hills told the trial judge that Hill had been aware that a case had been presented\nto the DA’s office but that Hill was unaware that the case was being taken seriously.\n\n                                                              Page 15 of 29\n\f                                     2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *34\n\n\n\nC. Hill’s Allegation He Was Selectively Prosecuted\nHill’s third allegation was that the indictments should be dismissed because he was denied equal\nprotection under the law when he was prosecuted under circumstances that do not normally lead to\ncriminal prosecution and when he was denied the benefit of pre-indictment notice.\n\nHN7 A selective prosecution claim is an assertion that the State brought charges ″for reasons forbidden\nby [*35] the Constitution.″ Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463-64. A selective-prosecution claim draws on\n″ordinary equal protection standards″ and requires a defendant to prove the existence of purposeful\ndiscrimination. Id. at 465; see also Matney v. State, 99 S.W.3d 626, 628 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n2002, no pet.). To make out a prima facie case, the defendant must first show that he has been singled\nout for prosecution while others similarly situated and committing the same acts have not been\nprosecuted. Matney, 99 S.W.3d at 628. He must also show that the State’s discriminatory selection of\nhim for prosecution was invidious or in bad faith. Id.; see also Gawlik v. State, 608 S.W.2d 671, 673\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1980).\nHill’s allegations fail to present a prima facie case that he was selectively prosecuted. He did not\npresent any evidence that he was singled out for prosecution under circumstances that do not normally\nlead to prosecution. Nor did he offer any evidence that he was treated differently because he was\ndenied pre-indictment notice of the contemplated charges and the opportunity for his lawyer to present\nhis views to the grand jury in contravention of what Hill claimed is the DA’s office’s ″longstanding\npractice.″ His allegations about the DA’s office’s motivations for prosecuting him amount to\nspeculation with no credible evidence to support his theories.\n\nV.\n\nHN8 There is an evidentiary [*36] threshold that must be met by the defendant before he is entitled\nto an evidentiary hearing on his claims that he was prosecuted in violation of his constitutional rights.\nSee In re United States, 397 F.3d at 284. That burden requires a defendant to do more than make\nunsupported allegations or speculative inferences about an improper motive. See Jennings, 724 F.2d at\n445-46. Stated another way, before a defendant gets to make inquiries into the State’s decision to\nprosecute, the defendant must support his allegations with evidence that tends to establish his\nconstitutional claims. See id.; see also Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 468. The record before us shows that\nthe trial judge granted Hill an evidentiary hearing so that Hill could ″try to prove″ that he was\nprosecuted in violation of his constitutional rights. By conducting this evidentiary hearing before Hill\nmet the evidentiary threshold, the judge turned the standard around and put the burden on the State to\nshow why Watkins was not operating under a conflict of interest and how the prosecution of Hill was\nnot vindictive or selective.\nWe conclude Hill did not make the proper showing sufficient to establish a prima face case of his\nalleged constitutional violations. Because Hill did not meet his burden, we also conclude the [*37] trial\njudge erred in conducting a hearing on Hill’s motion to dismiss. Consequently, the charges against Hill\nshould not have been dismissed. We resolve the State’s second issue in its favor. Based on our\nresolution of the State’s second issue, we need not address the State’s remaining issues. TEX. R.

[*39] See,\ne.g., State v. Dinur, 383 S.W.3d 695, 698-99 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, no pet.) (trial court\nconducted hearing on appellant’s motion to dismiss charges against him on the basis of, among other\nthings, selective prosecution); Rodriguez v. State, 283 S.W.3d 465, 471-72 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n2009, pet. dism’d) (trial court conducted hearing on appellant’s claim, similar to claim of selective\nprosecution, that trial court denied him equal protection, due process, equity, and fairness when it\ndismissed a virtually identical bond forfeiture case against another defendant and his surety but did not\ndo the same for appellant); Galvan v. State, 988 S.W.2d 291, 293 (Tex.

See Neal v. State, 150 S.W.3d 169, 176 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). The trial court’s\ndecision to conduct an evidentiary hearing and dismiss the indictments with prejudice is reviewed for\nan abuse of discretion. See State v. Terrazas, 970 S.W.2d 157, 159 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1998), aff’d,\n4 S.W.3d 720 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).\nHill’s motion to quash and dismiss the indictments was based on the following facts: Hill and his father\nwere involved in ″a hotly-contested federal lawsuit involving multi-billion dollar trusts.″ In February\n2010, the federal judge presiding over the case entered an order finding that Hill’s father had testified\nfalsely and submitted evidence in bad faith. Four days later, Hill’s father, through his lawyer, submitted\nto the Dallas County District Attorney’s Office a letter accusing Hill and his wife of mortgage fraud.\nIn the months that followed, a law partner donated a total of $48,500 in three contributions to the\nre-election campaign of Dallas District Attorney Craig Watkins. No member of this firm [*41] had\npreviously donated to Watkins’s campaign.\nIn May 2010, Lisa Blue saw a magazine article raising the question of whether the district attorney’s\noffice would ″go after″ Hill ″for shenanigans related to the house in which they live.″ The article\ndescribed the circumstances surrounding the same $500,000 loan that had been reported to the district\nattorney. After Blue learned the investigation of Hill’s alleged criminal conduct had been leaked to the\npress, she had a meeting with Terri Moore, First Assistant District Attorney at the time. Blue\nrecommended that Hill not be indicted. Watkins was not present at the meeting.\n\n                                                Page 18 of 29\n\f                                                2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *41\n\n\n\nAlso in May 2010, the federal trust litigation settled. Following the settlement, Blue and her colleagues\nhad a conflict with Hill over payment of more than $50 million in attorneys’ fees attributed to Blue’s\nsix-month representation of Hill. Because of the indictments, Hill felt he could not testify and invoked\nhis Fifth Amendment rights in the federal proceeding.\n\nOn January 20, 2011, Blue and Watkins met for dinner. Also in January 2011, while Blue was with\nSteve Malouf, Watkins called Blue and said, ″There could be an indictment1 or are you still interested\nin the indictments or . [*42] . . .″ On another occasion, the date of which Blue could not remember,\nWatkins called Blue and again ″mentioned the Hills.″ Blue said, ″Craig, remember, I don’t represent\nthe Hills, so I can’t -- there’s nothing that I could talk about.″ Another lawyer was with Blue when she\nreceived this second call.\n\nBlue and Watkins exchanged numerous phone calls in March 2011. On March 3, 2011, Blue met with\nWatkins to take publicity photos in connection with a $100,000 donation Blue made in his honor to\nSMU law school in 2010. On March 9, 2011, Blue had a fundraiser for Watkins at her house and\ncontributed $5000 to Watkins. On March 22, 2011, Blue was deposed in connection with her fee\ndispute with Hill. On March 30, 2011, Blue and Watkins again met for dinner. On March 31, 2011, the\nHills were indicted on charges of mortgage fraud. The indictments were made public two weeks before\nthe $50 million fee dispute trial.\n\nOn October 12, 2012, approximately eighteen months after the Hills were indicted, the Hills’ defense\ncounsel met with Assistant District Attorney Deborah Smith who described a ″reevaluation″ [*43] of\ncertain cases and said she had already decided to recommend dismissing certain charges against both\nHill and his wife. Smith ″expressed significant concerns about the cases against the Hills, made clear\nthat she had no role in obtaining the indictments, [and] said that the interviews of witnesses she was\nconducting should have been conducted much earlier.″ Shortly after the meeting, the DA moved to\ndismiss all charges against Hill’s wife ″in the interest of justice.″ On October 22, 2012, in response to\na follow-up email from Hill’s counsel, Smith wrote that she had been reassigned to prosecute animal\ncruelty cases.\n\nOn February 14, 2013, the trial judge conducted a hearing on Hill’s motion to dismiss. The trial judge\nstated she did not take her authority to dismiss a case filed by the prosecutor lightly and emphasized\nthe limited nature of that authority. The trial judge, over the State’s objection, called Blue as a witness.\nBlue took the stand and invoked her Fifth Amendment right on all questions.\n\nHill’s attorney called Watkins to the stand. Counsel for the State objected on the basis of lawyer/client\nprivilege. Specifically, counsel argued the State of Texas was represented by the district attorney, [*44]\nand the State therefore had a right to assert the privilege to prevent its lawyers from disclosing ″any\nother fact which came to their knowledge by virtue of their representation of the State.″ Counsel for\nthe State argued conversations between Blue and Watkins were work product because they would\n″reveal [Watkins’s] mental impression.″ The trial judge instructed the State to ″bring Mr. Watkins\ndown.″\n\nAn assistant district attorney entered the courtroom and stated she had spoken to Watkins, Watkins was\nin the office, but Watkins was not going to make himself available. The trial judge asked if Watkins\n1\n    In 2014, the Dallas County District Attorney’s website said 100,000 cases are processed per year.\n\n                                                             Page 19 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *44\n\n\n\nwas informed that the questions were going to be limited to his discussions with Blue. The assistant\ndistrict attorney stated she was not aware of that and further stated she knew ″[Watkins] to be ill,″ and\nhe was not ″in a condition to be able to testify in this matter.″ Following further discussion as to the\nextent of Watkins’s illness and the fact that Watkins was under subpoena to testify, the trial judge\ngranted a continuance.\n\nOn March 7, 2013, the trial judge conducted a hearing at which Blue’s counsel stated Blue’s position\nthat ″she would assert her Fifth Amendment privilege today just as she [*45] had before.″ Hill called\nWatkins as a witness and, after a private consultation with counsel, Watkins took the stand and refused\nto answer any questions ″because of [his] right as an attorney to have the privilege and to protect [his]\nwork product.″ Following a discussion of whether any privilege had been waived by providing\naffidavits of the people who worked for Watkins, the trial judge ordered Watkins to answer the\nquestions. Watkins refused, and the trial judge held him in contempt.\n\nHill was prepared to call witnesses to testify regarding the authenticity of the exhibits attached to his\nmotion to dismiss and certain other documents. Although it is not clear which exhibits were at issue,\ncounsel for the State agreed he was stipulating to the authenticity of the exhibits.\n\nTerri Moore, a former Dallas assistant district attorney, testified Donna Strittmatter and Stephanie\nMartin, two other assistant district attorneys, came to Moore and asked for permission to use the\nresources of the office to investigate Hill. Moore inquired whether Hill’s father had made the\nallegations against him, and Strittmatter and Martin told Moore ″there was a lawsuit between the father\nand the son.″ Moore [*46] said, ″I’m sure dad is trying to get some kind of strategic advantage over\nhis son in the lawsuit, so be very, very skeptical of whatever he may have told you.″ Moore added, ″Be\ncareful, because [Hill’s father] is just using the office . . . .″\n\nStrittmatter testified she attended the pitch session at which Watkins was present. Watkins did not say\nanything about conversations with Blue regarding the Hills. Strittmatter testified Watkins’s only\ninvolvement in preparing the case for the grand jury was that he was present at the pitch session. The\npitch session was in January 2011, and the case was presented to the grand jury approximately two and\na half months later.\n\nStrittmatter testified Moore told her ″to be suspicious of the complaint″ she received from Hill’s father.\nStrittmatter later learned the trust ″offered the bargain over a nonprosecution affidavit in this case″ so\nthat Hill would drop his claim for the assets of the trust. In investigating the case, Strittmatter\ndiscovered the ″title agency missed something on the abstract of the property.″ When asked if she was\naware whether the Dallas County District Attorney’s Office had ″indicted a mortgage fraud case where\nthe loan was [*47] fully collateralized, paid as expected, and repaid in full and there was no complaint\nfrom the bank, but it was indicted anyway,″ Strittmatter answered she ″was not aware because [she\nhad] not been the mortgage fraud prosecutor.″ When asked the same question again, Strittmatter\nanswered, ″I don’t know, but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t happened.″ When the trial judge asked if there\nwas a way to identify similar cases via computer, Strittmatter answered, ″We have a computer, but it\nwouldn’t say that much detail, Your Honor. It’d really be the — the prosecutors’ individual memory.″\n\nMartin testified that, on February 22, 2010, Strittmatter called her into a meeting with Lynn and gave\nher a copy of a complaint alleging Hill had stolen from the trust ″because eighty percent of the house\n\n                                                Page 20 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *47\n\n\n\nwas put into a mortgage.″ Martin denied having ″concerns about a case in which the bank was not the\none that complained about the alleged fraud.″ Martin testified Moore told her to be suspicious of Hill’s\nfather. Martin testified that, from the moment she got the complaint and reviewed the exhibits, she\nthought she had a good case and immediately started requesting original documents.\n\nMartin invited Watkins [*48] to the pitch session because the case against Hill ″would get some media\nattention, possibly national media attention.″ Martin testified that, if Watkins had told her ″this is too\nmuch of a hot potato; let’s just let it go,″ she would not have put the case before the grand jury.\n\nOn redirect examination, Hill’s counsel showed Martin notes Martin identified as ″two different days\nwhere I wrote notes about having talked to David Pickett.″ The first date was September 8, 2010, and\nnoted the following:\n\n   David Pickett calls all the time. Investigation is slowly going, and I told him that. Today he\n   wanted a definite timeline. I told him I can’t give you a timeline. I’ve got things to do on the\n   case and haven’t done them because I’m getting ready for trial. He said Trust is actual victim\n   after I told him bank really isn’t interested in prosecuting. Told him that in research I’d done,\n   didn’t see how I could prove his criminal case at this time. He said he sent -- gave all that stuff\n   to me. I said I’d go back and look, but getting ready for trial. He then sends e-mail. I showed\n   it to Chief D. Strittmatter, and then she said to show to First Assistant Terri Moore so she would\n   have all info, if needed. [*49] Took to Terri Moore, and she said, okay, in a few weeks call him\n   to discuss the matter.\n\nUpon further questioning, Martin testified the bank’s general counsel said ″we wouldn’t have filed a\ncomplaint because we -- the loan got repaid, but she would do whatever [Martin] wanted her to do as\nfar as prosecuting the case because, by law, she has to.″ The trial judge, reading from Martin’s notes,\nstated ″and then it goes on to say, I’ve talked to David Pickett multiple times since then. He was okay\nwith not indicting for the Trust as a victim because the bank is actual -- who was defrauded under the\nfraud statutes and going forward with indictments.″ In response to questioning, Martin testified the part\nof her note the trial judge read was ″probably″ added after Hill filed his motion to dismiss for\nprosecutorial misconduct.\n\nThus, as the trial judge summarized the situation, the pitch session was held only because the case\nagainst Hill was a potentially high publicity case; Martin invited Watkins to the pitch session and\nwould not have gone forward with the case against Hill without Watkins’s approval; the only person\nwho could know Watkins’s motivations was Watkins and, maybe, Blue; and neither [*50] Watkins nor\nBlue were testifying. The trial judge gave Watkins another opportunity to come down and testify and\ntook a brief recess. When the hearing recommenced, counsel for the State told the trial judge Watkins\nwould not testify.\n\nFollowing the presentation of evidence, the trial judge made an oral finding that, ″because of the failure\nof Mr. Watkins to testify in this hearing, the Defendant has been denied his right to have a meaningful\nhearing on his Motion to Dismiss.″ The trial judge then dismissed the cases. This appeal followed.\n\nIn its first two points of error, the State argues the trial court abused its discretion by granting Hill an\nevidentiary hearing and dismissing the indictments against him because (1) Hill tendered no evidence\n\n                                                 Page 21 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *50\n\n\n\nto support his request and (2) the facts Hill alleged failed to establish a constitutional violation.\nSpecifically, the State challenges the trial judge’s decision to hold an evidentiary hearing on Hill’s\nclaims of prosecutorial misconduct in its first two issues. The State first complains about Hill’s proffer\nof evidence in support of his motion. The State argues that Hill needed to present evidence to support\nhis claims before he was entitled [*51] to an evidentiary hearing and, because Hill ″simply made\nunsworn allegations″ in his motion and ″attached a stack of unauthenticated documents″ as exhibits,\nhe basically provided no evidence to support his central allegations. The State asserts that, under\nUnited States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 116 S. Ct. 1480, 134 L. Ed. 2d 687 (1996), the judge had\nto presume Watkins acted in good faith until Hill presented clear evidence to the contrary, and the\npresentation of such evidence was a condition that must be met before receiving an evidentiary\nhearing. The State contends that, because Hill tendered no evidence (other than some trial transcripts\nand deposition testimony, both of which the State argues are not clear evidence sufficient to dispel the\npresumption the prosecutor acted with a proper motive), the trial judge erred in conducting the\nevidentiary hearing. In response, Hill states the facts cast doubt on the constitutionality of the\nprosecution and not only entitle him to an evidentiary hearing but also establish a prima facie showing\nof prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nThe trial court’s decision to conduct an evidentiary hearing and dismiss the indictments with prejudice\nis reviewed for an abuse of discretion. See Terrazas, 970 S.W.2d at 159. The test for whether the trial\ncourt abused its [*52] discretion is whether the action was arbitrary or unreasonable. State v. Mechler,\n153 S.W.3d 435, 439 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). The trial court does not abuse its discretion unless its\ndetermination lies outside the zone of reasonable disagreement. Martinez v. State, 327 S.W.3d 727, 736\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n\nSelective prosecution and vindictive prosecution are not defenses on the merits to the criminal charge\nbut independent assertions that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons the Constitution\nprohibits. See Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463; Ex Parte Quintana, 346 S.W.3d 681, 685 (Tex. App.—El\nPaso 2009, pet. ref’d). Generally, prosecutors have broad discretion in enforcing criminal laws. See\nNeal, 150 S.W.3d at 173. But selective prosecution does limit a prosecutor’s otherwise broad discretion\nin determining what crimes to prosecute and how. Quintana, 346 S.W.3d at 685; see Roise v. State, 7\nS.W.3d 225, 242-43 (Tex. App.—Austin 1999, pet. ref’d).\n\nA defendant who believes he is subjected to selective prosecution bears the burden of proving\npurposeful discrimination. See Green v. State, 934 S.W.2d 92, 103 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996). This burden\nfalls on the defendant because the presumption is that a prosecution for a violation of a criminal law\nis taken upon in ″good faith and in nondiscriminatory fashion″ to bring violators to justice. See Gawlik\nv. State, 608 S.W.2d 671, 673 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980); Garcia v. State, 172 S.W.3d 270, 273 (Tex.\nApp.—El Paso 2005, no pet.). To establish a prima facie case, the defendant must show that: (1) the\ngovernment has singled him out for prosecution even though the government has not proceeded against\nothers similarly situated based on the type of conduct for which [*53] he is charged; and (2) the\ngovernment’s discriminatory selection is invidious, which means that the selection is based on\nimpermissible considerations such as race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of\nconstitutional rights or based on some arbitrary classification. Quintana, 346 S.W.3d at 685; Garcia,\n172 S.W.3d at 273-74. The defendant must provide ″exceptionally clear″ evidence that the decision to\nprosecute was for an improper reason to establish a prima facie case of selective prosecution. See\n\n                                                Page 22 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *53\n\n\n\nGarcia, 172 S.W.3d at 274. Once the defendant makes a clear showing of an Equal Protection violation,\nthe burden shifts to the State to justify the discriminatory treatment. See Johnson v. California, 543\nU.S. 499, 505, 125 S. Ct. 1141, 160 L. Ed. 2d 949 (2005); Quintana, 346 S.W.3d at 685. However, the\nEqual Protection clauses of the United States and Texas Constitutions only require a rational basis for\nthe distinction unless it discriminates against a suspect class or impinges on a fundamental right. See\nFlores v. State, 904 S.W.2d 129, 130 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995).\n\nA constitutional claim of prosecutorial vindictiveness may be established in either of two distinct ways:\n(1) proof of circumstances that pose a ″realistic likelihood″ of such misconduct sufficient to raise a\n″presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness,″ which the State must rebut or face dismissal of the\ncharges; or (2) proof of ″actual vindictiveness″ — that is, direct evidence [*54] that the prosecutor’s\ncharging decision is an unjustifiable penalty resulting solely from the defendant’s exercise of a\nprotected legal right. Neal, 150 S.W.3d at 173. Under the first prong, if the State pursues increased\ncharges or an enhanced sentence after a defendant is convicted, exercises his legal right to appeal, and\nobtains a new trial, the Supreme Court has found a presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness. Id.\n(citing Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21, 94 S. Ct. 2098, 40 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1974)). In the very few\nsituations in which this presumption does apply, it can be overcome by objective evidence in the record\njustifying the prosecutor’s action. Id. at 173-74.\n\nUnder the second prong, when the presumption does not apply, the defendant may still obtain relief if\nhe can show actual vindictiveness. Id. at 174. To establish that claim, a defendant must prove, with\nobjective evidence, that the prosecutor’s charging decision was a ″direct and unjustifiable penalty″ that\nresulted ″solely from the defendant’s exercise of a protected legal right.″ Id. Under this prong, the\ndefendant shoulders the burden of both production and persuasion, unaided by any legal presumption.\nId. Once again, the trial judge decides the ultimate factual issue based upon the evidence and credibility\ndeterminations. [*55] Id. at 174-75. Under either prong, ″[i]f the defendant is unable to prove actual\nvindictiveness or a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness, a trial court need not reach the issue of\ngovernment justification.″ Id. at 175. That is, the State may stand mute unless and until the defendant\ncarries his burden of proof under either prong. Id.\n\nA trial judge’s limited authority to dismiss an indictment stems in part from the fact that the decision\nof whether to prosecute is a core executive constitutional function. Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464-65. And\nbecause this power is within the province of the State, the State enjoys considerable discretion in\ndeciding whether or not to prosecute and what charge to file or bring to the grand jury. Wayte v. United\nStates, 470 U.S. 598, 607, 105 S. Ct. 1524, 84 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1985); Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S.\n357, 364, 98 S. Ct. 663, 54 L. Ed. 2d 604 (1978); see also Neal, 150 S.W.3d at 173. As a result of that\ndiscretion, our consideration of Hill’s claims begins with a ″presumption of regularity.″ That means we\npresume the State made its decision to prosecute Hill in good faith and in compliance with the\nConstitution. Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 465-66; Neal, 150 S.W.3d at 173.\n\nBecause courts are hesitant to interfere with the State’s exercise of its discretion to prosecute, a\ndefendant challenging the State’s decision to prosecute him must make out a prima facie showing that\nhe has been prosecuted in violation of his constitutional rights. [*56] United States v. Webster, 162 F.3d\n308, 333-34 (5th Cir. 1999). To do this, he must ″dispel the presumption of good faith″ and\nconstitutional compliance by presenting ″’clear evidence to the contrary.’″ Id. at 334 (quoting\n                                                Page 23 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *56\n\n\n\nArmstrong, 517 U.S. at 465); see also Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464 (because prosecutors are afforded\na ″background presumption,″ the necessary showing ″to obtain discovery should itself be a significant\nbarrier to the litigation of insubstantial claims″); Garcia, 172 S.W.3d at 274 (appellant ″claiming\nselective prosecution must come forth with ’exceptionally clear evidence’ that the prosecution was\ninitiated for an improper reason.″).\n\nImportantly, a defendant who claims his constitutional rights were violated by some form of\nprosecutorial misconduct ″is not automatically entitled to an evidentiary hearing to make the required\nshowing.″ Webster, 162 F.3d at 334. Rather, he must ″present facts ’sufficient to create a reasonable\ndoubt about the constitutionality of [his] prosecution’ . . . .″ Id. (quoting United States v. Jennings, 724\nF.2d 436, 445-46 (5th Cir. 1986)); see also United States v. Cervantes, 132 F.3d 1106, 1111 n.4 (5th\nCir. 1981) (explaining that defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing related to constitutionality\nof his prosecution ″only if the existing record proves the likely merit of [his] specific allegations″). The\n″facts″ required to cast doubt about the constitutionality of the prosecution and rebut the presumption\nthe State acted in [*57] good faith such that a person is entitled to an evidentiary hearing (or even\ndiscovery) must be more than allegations. See Jennings, 724 F.2d at 445-46 (motion containing broad,\ngeneralized allegations did not offer facts to the court to warrant evidentiary hearing); see also Wade\nv. United States, 504 U.S. 181, 186, 112 S. Ct. 1840, 118 L. Ed. 2d 524 (1992) (stating that ″generalized\nallegations of improper motive″ are not enough to entitle a defendant to a remedy, discovery, or\nevidentiary hearing); United States v. Sanchez, 517 F.3d 651, 671 (2d Cir. 2008) (″Generalized\nallegations of improper motive do not disturb the presumption of regularity.″).\n\nA defendant also is not automatically entitled to discovery to obtain information about the\nprosecutorial motive; the requisite threshold to obtain discovery on such claims requires the person to\nproduce ″some evidence tending to show the existence of the essential elements″ of the claimed\nviolations. Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 468. The standard for obtaining discovery in aid of such claims is\n″rigorous″ and complements the ″rigorous standard″ for proving constitutional violations in the\ndecision to prosecute. Id.\n\nI agree with the State’s contention that a criminal defendant is not entitled to probe prosecutorial\nmotive absent clear evidence establishing a prima facie case of a constitutional violation. See In re\nUnited States, 397 F.3d 274, 284 (5th Cir. 2005). I also agree that the [*58] governing legal principles\noutlined above contemplate an initial evidentiary tender by Hill to displace the presumption the\nprosecutor acted in good faith. See Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 465; Webster, 162 F.3d at 334. I disagree,\nhowever, with the State’s first argument that Hill provided ″no evidence″ with his motion in support\nof his claims.\n\nHill alleged in his motion that the influence exercised upon Watkins by Hill’s father, his father’s\nlawyer, and Blue deprived him of due process. He explained that Watkins had ″a financial stake in the\nprosecution of the Hills″ because indicting them benefited Blue (who was involved in a dispute with\nthe Hills over attorneys’ fees) and counsel for his father (who also was a major campaign contributor)\n″which in turn benefited″ Watkins. Hill claimed Blue’s influence and involvement with the indictment\nprocess were demonstrated by Blue’s admission that Watkins contacted her two times before the\nindictments were returned and the pattern of phone calls and text messages exchanged between Blue\nand Watkins (and others in the DA’s office) in the weeks before the indictments were returned.\n\n                                                 Page 24 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *58\n\n\n\nIn his motion, Hill argued that, to prevail on his vindictive prosecution claim, he was required to show\nthat (1) ″the [*59] prosecutor harbored genuine animus toward the defendant, or was prevailed upon\nto bring the charges by another with animus such that the prosecutor could be considered a ’stalking\nhorse’″ and (2) ″he would not have been prosecuted except for the animus.″ United States v. Koh, 199\nF.3d 632, 640 (2d Cir. 1999). Hill alleged that the decision to prosecute him was prompted by the anger\nof his father after receiving an adverse ruling in the trust litigation and the animus of Blue in the\nfee-dispute litigation. He also maintained that the\n\n   timing, circumstances, and unusual if not unprecedented nature of the Hill indictments make\n   abundantly clear that the real motivation of these indictments was to benefit [Watkins’s]\n   prolific campaign contributor [his father’s lawyer’s law partner], and to assist [Watkins’s]\n   friend and benefactor, [Blue] by impairing the Hills’ ability to contest [Blue’s] enormous fee\n   claims.\n\nHe claimed such animus was demonstrated by the improprieties inherent in the indictments (such as\nhis denial of any pre-indictment notice or opportunity to be heard by the Grand Jury), the\n″unprecedented nature″ of the charges, and Hill’s understanding that the DA’s office did not conduct\na thorough investigation before indicting him. Hill’s [*60] third allegation was that the indictments\nshould be dismissed because he was denied equal protection under the law when he was prosecuted\nunder circumstances that do not normally lead to criminal prosecution and when he was denied the\nbenefit of pre-indictment notice.\n\nThe State concedes Blue’s deposition testimony that Watkins called her two times regarding the Hill\nindictments was evidence. Attached to Hill’s motion to dismiss were exhibits including a complaint\nfrom Hill’s father’s attorney that the Hills committed mortgage fraud; excerpts from Watkins’s\ncampaign finance reports; emails between Blue, Hill, Malouf, and Charla Aldous; excerpts from Blue’s\ndeposition; and the indictments against the Hills. The record reflects that the State did not object to the\nnumerous exhibits attached to Hill’s motion to dismiss. Instead, the State filed a response to the merits\nof Hill’s assertions contained in Hill’s motion, appeared at the hearing on Hill’s motion, and ended up\nstipulating to the authenticity of the exhibits. Further, Blue took the Fifth and refused to testify\nconcerning her conversations with Watkins, which creates an adverse inference against the State. An\nadverse inference [*61] may not be drawn from a defendant’s proper invocation of a privilege because\nin a criminal case ″the stakes are higher and the State’s sole interest is to convict.″ Baxter v.\nPalmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318-19, 96 S. Ct. 1551, 47 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1976). However, the danger of\nunfair prejudice is not the same when it is the defense rather than the State that seeks to draw an\ninference from a witness’s invocation of privilege. I would reject the State’s argument, made for the\nfirst time on appeal, that the exhibits were ″no evidence,″ see TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a), and overrule the\nState’s first issue.\n\nIn its second issue, the State argues Hill failed to make a prima facie case of a constitutional violation.\nAt the hearing on Hill’s motion to dismiss, the State made this same argument. However, the State\nraised this issue after the hearing had begun and after the trial judge determined Hill had already\nestablished a prima facie case. A review of the record shows the first thing the trial judge did at the\nFebruary 14 hearing was address the court’s power to dismiss the indictments against Hill. No new\nevidence was presented at the February 14 hearing. In response to the State’s argument that Hill\n                                                Page 25 of 29\n\f                                       2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *61\n\n\n\n″want[ed] information″ and ″that’s just discovery under 39.14,″ the trial judge questioned how [*62]\nHill could ″just want information″ when ″[Hill had] already provided, in the opinion of this Court,\nsufficient information.″ Later in the hearing, the trial judge specifically stated that ″civil lawyers in a\ncouple weeks ahead of time [of the indictments] making huge contributions to the District Attorney,\nand you have admissions by Ms. Blue that she discussed the indictments with Mr. Watkins″ established\na prima facie case to support the motion to dismiss. Another time, the trial judge stated, ″This is a\nhearing on a motion to dismiss or a motion to quash,″ and Hill ″presented sufficient evidence to the\nCourt in the form of their motion to dismiss and the response . . . to the State’s objections that I believe\nrise to the level of a prima facie showing.″\n\nThus, the record shows the trial judge made a determination that Hill established a prima facie case\nbefore the hearing on February 14. The trial judge began the hearing by questioning the court’s\nauthority to dismiss the indictments against Hill, not by addressing the issue of whether Hill made a\nprima facie showing of a constitutional violation. The trial judge’s references to a ″hearing″ to follow\nreferred to a hearing on specific [*63] issues the trial judge identified, not the issue of a prima facie\ncase. Notably, the February 14 hearing was continued due to Watkins’s refusal to appear, necessitating\nfurther ″hearings″ on the dismissal issue.\n\nThe gist of the allegations presented in Hill’s motion is that there was an untoward interest in indicting\nhim. He specifically claimed he was deprived of his right to a disinterested prosecutor and that he had\nbeen vindictively and selectively prosecuted. As proof of the alleged constitutional violations, Hill\nemphasized in his motion the following: (1) Watkins’s campaign records showing political contributions\nfrom a lawyer associated with his father in the months after the February 2010 complaint and five\nmonths before the indictments were returned and a donation by Blue less than a month before the\nindictments; (2) information showing that Blue hosted a fundraiser for Watkins in the month before the\nindictments; (3) the ″unusual″ nature of the charges against him; (4) the lack of notice to him that\nindictments were being considered; (5) the suspect timing of the indictments in that they were returned\njust before the fee-dispute trial involving Blue, which Hill claimed prevented [*64] him and his wife\nfrom testifying in that trial; (6) Blue’s telephone records and text message logs, which Hill claimed\nshow a ″heated exchange″ of communications with Watkins and his office in the weeks leading up to\nthe indictments and ending after the indictments were returned; (7) Blue’s admission during her\ndepositions that she discussed indictments with Watkins in the time before they were returned; (8)\nBlue’s comment made in her deposition that she would have no reason to discuss indictments with\nWatkins after they were returned; (9) Blue’s close relationship with Watkins; (10) defense counsel’s\nmeeting with Smith about the charges; and (11) the fact that the charges against Hill’s wife were\ndismissed. In addition, the trial judge heard from the district attorney’s office that they did not initially\nthink this was a good case, and the trial judge noted Martin was impeached with her own notes.\n\nI would conclude the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in determining these facts establish a\nprima facie case of a selective prosecution, vindictive prosecution, and absence of an impartial and\ndisinterested prosecutor. See Terrazas, 970 S.W.2d at 159. The evidence presented by Hill amounted\nto ″more than allegations.″ [*65] See Jennings, 724 F.2d at 445-46. By conducting a hearing after Hill\nmade a prima facie case of a constitutional violation, the trial judge correctly shifted the inquiry to\nwhether the State could produce evidence showing why the prosecution of Hill was not vindictive or\nselective or undertaken by an impartial and disinterested prosecutor. See Neal, 150 S.W.3d at 173.\n\n                                                 Page 26 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *65\n\n\n\nFollowing the State’s failure to present evidence from Watkins or Blue to rebut Hill’s prima facie case,\nthe trial judge did not abuse her discretion in dismissing the indictments against Hill. Id. at 173-75. I\nwould overrule the State’s second issue.\n\nIn its third issue, the State argues the trial judge abused her discretion by compelling Watkins to testify\nand then dismissing the indictments based on his refusal to testify. Specifically, the State argues Hill\nwas attempting to ″invade protected work product″ by seeking to discover the basis for Watkins’s\ndecision to seek indictments against Hill.\n\nIn its response to Hill’s motion to dismiss, the State asserted Hill’s argument assumed the district\nattorney was not free to discuss these crimes or his investigation with others or, more particularly, Blue.\nThe State argued Hill’s assumption is false and argued that, even if the district [*66] attorney spoke\nto Blue about Hill’s cases every single time the two communicated, there was nothing improper about\nit. As the county’s prosecuting authority, the district attorney is obligated to investigate allegations of\ncriminal activity and, according to the State, any source that could inform his decision about whether\nto prosecute and what to prosecute an individual for is fair game. The State argued it would be\nreasonable for the district attorney to conclude that Blue’s prior relationship with Hill, which was both\npersonal and professional, made her a potential source of reliable information.\n\nAgain, nowhere in its response did the State challenge the authenticity or veracity of any of the exhibits\nattached to Hill’s motion to dismiss or argue that Hill’s motion failed to make out a prima facie\nshowing that he had been prosecuted in violation of his constitutional rights. Further, the record shows\nthe State subsequently stipulated to the authenticity of the exhibits at a later hearing.\n\nWork product comprises:\n\n   (1) material prepared or mental impressions developed in anticipation of litigation or for trial\n   by or for a party or a party’s representatives, including the party’s attorneys, [*67] consultants,\n   sureties, indemnitors, insurers, employees, or agents; or\n   (2) a communication made in anticipation of litigation or for trial between a party and the\n   party’s representatives or among a party’s representatives, including the party’s attorneys,\n   consultants, sureties, indemnitors, insurers, employees, or agents.\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 192.5. The work product of an attorney or an attorney’s representative that contains the\nattorney’s or the attorney’s representative’s mental impressions, opinions, conclusions, or legal\ntheories is not discoverable. Id. ″The primary purpose of the work product rule is to shelter the mental\nprocesses, conclusions, and legal theories of the attorney, providing a privileged area within which the\nlawyer can analyze and prepare his or her case.″ Owens Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Caldwell, 818\nS.W.2d 749, 750 (Tex. 1991).\n\nOur evidence rules provide, however, that a privilege can be waived:\n\n   A person upon whom these rules confer a privilege against disclosure waives the privilege if:\n   (1) the person or a predecessor of the person while holder of the privilege voluntarily discloses\n   or consents to disclosure of any significant part of the privileged matter unless such disclosure\n   itself is privileged.\n\n                                                Page 27 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *67\n\n\n\nTEX. R. EVID. 511(1); Jones v. State, 181 S.W.3d 875, 878 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2006, pet. ref’d). The State\nin this case did [*68] not raise any privilege or work product objections during the testimony of Moore,\nStrittmatter, or Martin. Through their collective testimony, the State allowed extensive evidence\nconcerning the decision-making process before and during the events leading up to Hill’s indictments.\nThus, any claim of privilege related to that process was waived. See TEX. R. EVID. 511(1); Jones, 181\nS.W.3d at 878.\n\nRule 1.05 of the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure is pertinent to the issue of whether Watkins\nlegitimately could solicit information from Blue concerning whether to indict Hill. Rule 1.05 provides:\n\n   [A] lawyer shall not knowingly . . . (2) [u]se confidential information of a client to the\n   disadvantage of the client unless the client consents after consultation [or] (3) [u]se confidential\n   information of a former client to the disadvantage of the former client after the representation\n   is concluded unless the former client consents after consultation or the confidential information\n   has become generally known.\n\nTEX. DISCIPLINARY R. PROF’L CONDUCT 1.05(b), reprinted in TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN., tit. 2, subtit. G app. A\n(West 2005) (TEX. STATE BAR R. art. X, § 9).\nOne of the primary purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is to preserve the integrity of\nthe attorney-client relationship once it has been established. State v. Frye, 897 S.W.2d 324, 327 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1995) (citing Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U.S. 285, 108 S. Ct. 2389, 101 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1988)).\nBoth the court of [*69] criminal appeals and the United States Supreme Court have declared once an\naccused has a lawyer, ″a distinct set of constitutional safeguards aimed at preserving the sanctity of the\nattorney-client relationship takes effect.″ Id.\nHere, Watkins’s communication with Blue concerning Hill could have been a purely innocent inquiry\ninto whether Blue, his personal friend, was simply ″interested″ in what was going on with Hill, in\nwhich case the inquiry would have had nothing to do with ″a communication made in anticipation of\nlitigation or for trial″ and would not have constituted work product. The communication could have\nbeen an inquiry of Blue as a ″potential source of reliable information″ against Hill, in which case the\ncommunication would have violated rule 1.05. Or the communication could have been an inquiry into\nwhether Blue, who had formerly urged the district attorney’s office not to indict Hill while she\nrepresented Hill, was ″still interested″ in preventing the indictments now that she was seeking in excess\nof $50 million in attorney’s fees from Hill. In that case, the characterization of Watkins’s\ncommunication as ″a communication made in anticipation of litigation or for trial″ cannot [*70] stand;\nthe purpose of the communication in that case would be to violate Hill’s constitutional rights under the\nguise of legitimate ″prosecution.″ None of these possibilities support the State’s theory that Watkins’s\ncommunication with Blue concerning the Hill indictments fit within the definition of work product. I\nwould overrule the State’s third issue.\nIn its fourth issue, the State argues the trial judge abused her discretion by dismissing the indictments\nwith prejudice. The State argues dismissal without prejudice would have cured the claimed\nconstitutional violations.\nDismissal with prejudice may be warranted when a defendant suffers demonstrable prejudice, or a\nsubstantial threat thereof, and where the trial court is unable to ″identify and neutralize the taint″ by\n\n                                                Page 28 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *70\n\n\n\nother means. Frye, 897 S.W.2d at 330. Here, the evidence supported the trial judge’s determination that\nHill established a prima facie case his constitutional rights were violated, and the State presented no\nevidence enabling the trial judge to ″identify and neutralize the taint.″ See id. It was for the trial judge\nto decide the ultimate factual issue based upon the evidence and credibility determinations. Neal, 150\nS.W.3d at 174-75. I would conclude the trial judge [*71] did not abuse her discretion in dismissing the\nindictments with prejudice. I would overrule the State’s fourth issue.\n\nI would affirm the trial judge’s order dismissing the indictments in these cases.\n\nDAVID L.

Issue One: To establish a prima facie case of selective\n         prosecution in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth\n         Amendments, and to obtain a hearing under the “presumption of\n         prosecutorial vindictiveness” method, a defendant must provide\n         “some evidence” that shows: (1) the government singled out the\n         defendant for prosecution and has not proceeded against others\n         similarly situated based on the type of conduct for which the\n         defendant is charged; and (2) the government’s discriminatory\n         selection is invidious. Once the defendant makes this showing,\n         the burden shifts to the State to justify the discriminatory\n         treatment.\n          Appellee asks this Court to clarify what constitutes “some\n          evidence” and hold that so long as a defendant attaches a proffer\n          of evidence to a motion to dismiss due to prosecutorial\n          misconduct, the trial court in its discretion determines to present\n          a colorable claim of a constitutional violation, the defendant has\n          attached “some evidence,” and the trial court should have the\n          discretion to conduct a hearing on the motion to dismiss.\n          Appellee also asks this Court to find that Appellee not only\n          attached “some evidence” showing a constitutional violation, but\n          in fact attached “exceptionally clear evidence.”\n          Finally, Appellee asks this Court to find that the Court of Appeals\n          erred when it: (1) sustained the State’s second issue and\n          concluded that Appellee “did not make the proper showing\n          sufficient to establish a prima facie case...” of the fact that the\n          former elected district attorney of Dallas County engaged in\n          prosecutorial misconduct by allowing himself to be corruptly\n          influenced by a political ally in return for indicting Appellee; (2)\n          found that the trial court erred in conducting a hearing on\n          Appellee’s motion to dismiss based upon prosecutorial\n          misconduct; (3) vacated the trial court’s Order Granting Motion\n          to Dismiss; and (4) remanded the case to the trial court to\n          reinstate the indictments against Appellee. ...................................................42 \n\n\n                                                               5\n\fi.      Introduction – so long as the prosecution is not for an\n        improper purpose, prosecutors have the discretion to\n        prosecute ..............................................................................................42 \nii.     To raise a “presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness,”\n        a defendant must present evidence of circumstances that\n        pose a “realistic likelihood” of misconduct. When the\n        defendant does so, the defendant makes a prima facie case.\n        The burden then shifts to the State to rebut this\n        presumption or face dismissal of the charges .....................................49 \niii.    The majority opinion’s characterization of the evidence\n        attached to the Motion to Dismiss is inaccurate. Nearly all\n        of the evidence proffered by Appellee and attached to the\n        Motion to Dismiss: (1) would be admissible in a hearing\n        without further authentication; and (2) constitutes\n        “exceptionally clear” evidence that the decision to\n        prosecute was for an improper purpose, exceeding the\n        standard that the trial court must, in its discretion, find\n        “some evidence” of a colorable claim of a constitutional\n        violation ...............................................................................................51 \niv.     “Some evidence” means that a defendant must attach to\n        the motion to dismiss evidence that establishes that the\n        defendant has a colorable claim of a constitutional\n        violation. This allows the trial court to exercise its\n        discretion in ordering the hearing. Once a hearing is held,\n        the defendant must show by “exceptionally clear\n        evidence” that the prosecution was initiated for an\n        improper reason. ..................................................................................58 \nv.      No appellate court in Texas has ever ruled that a trial court\n        erred in conducting a hearing on a defendant’s motion to\n        dismiss charges on the basis they violated his\n        constitutional rights. ............................................................................67 \nvi.     Texas public policy benefits if trial courts are allowed\n        discretion to determine whether a defendant has made the\n        threshold showing of a colorable claim that the defendant\n        is entitled to a hearing .........................................................................68 \nvii.    Most other courts have adopted standards substantially\n        similar to the standard that Appellee argues this Court\n        should adopt: that so long as a defendant attaches a proffer\n                                                   6\n\f                 of evidence to a motion to dismiss due to prosecutorial\n                 misconduct that the trial court in its discretion determines\n                 to present a colorable claim of a constitutional violation,\n                 the defendant has attached “some evidence,” and the trial\n                 court should have the discretion to conduct a hearing on\n                 the motion to dismiss...........................................................................71 \n        viii.  This Court should affirm the trial court’s order dismissing\n               the indictments because the evidence obtained during the\n               March 7, 2013 hearing overwhelmingly proved that: (1)\n               Watkins singled out Appellee for prosecution and has not\n               proceeded against others similarly situated based on the\n               type of conduct for which Appellee was charged; and (2)\n               Watkins’s discriminatory selection was invidious and\n               resulted from allowing himself to be improperly\n               influenced by Blue...............................................................................76 \n        ix.      Conclusion ...........................................................................................76 \nXI.     Conclusion and Prayer ...................................................................................78 \nXII.  Certificate of Service .....................................................................................80 \nXIII.  Certificate of Compliance with Tex.

Appendix Index\n\nAppendix 1: State v. Hill, 05-13-00421-CR-180, 05-13-00423-CR-180, 05-13-\n00424-CR-180, and 05-13-00425-CR-180, 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835 (Tex.\nApp. Dallas, December 29, 2014) (Bridges, J. dissenting) (unpublished opinion)\n\n\n\n\n                                     11\n\fTo The Honorable Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals:\n\n      Appellee Albert G. Hill, III respectfully submits this opening brief:\n\n\nV. Statement of the Case and Procedural History\n\n      Appellee asks that this Court review the judgment and opinion of the Fifth\n\nCourt of Appeals in State v. Hill, 05-13-00421-CR-180, 05-13-00423-CR-180, 05-\n\n13-00424-CR-180, and 05-13-00425-CR-180, 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835 (Tex.\n\nApp. Dallas, December 29, 2014) (Bridges, J. dissenting) (unpublished opinion).\n\n(See Appendix 1). The issues presented in this case appear to be of first impression\n\nin Texas. Appellee found no other case in which a defendant proffered “some\n\nevidence” – much less “exceptionally clear evidence” as proffered in this case –\n\nshowing that in exchange for indicting the defendant, a prosecutor was improperly\n\ninfluenced by a person to the extent that the defendant’s constitutional rights were\n\nviolated.   Here, this person, who was at the time of indictment involved in civil\n\nlitigation with the defendant, improperly influenced the prosecutor. When that\n\nperson and the prosecutor refused to answer any questions at a hearing that the trial\n\ncourt had the discretion to order, the trial court made an adverse inference, and\n\ndismissed the indictments due to prosecutorial misconduct. But, the Court of\n\nAppeals reversed the trial judge’s ruling on the basis that the defendant did not\n\nproffer enough evidence to even warrant a hearing.\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f       The procedural history is as follows: on March 31, 2011, four indictments\n\nwere returned against Appellee, alleging violations of Texas Penal Code § 32.32,\n\nFalse Statement to Obtain Credit: that on or about May 14, 2009, with the intent of\n\nobtaining a loan of money, the aggregate value of which was $200,000.00 or more,\n\nAppellee made certain materially false and misleading written statements to\n\nOmniAmerican Bank by: (1) claiming that he and his wife, Erin Hill, “were only\n\nowners of real property located at 4433 Bordeaux, Highland Park, Dallas County,\n\nTexas...” (F11-00180/05-13-00421-CR) (CR-180, 6, 427);1 (2) claiming that his\n\ngross monthly income was $54,341.00 (F11-00182/05-13-00423-CR) (CR-180,\n\n428); (3) executing certain documents “by deception” by creating and executing the\n\ndocuments and by creating and confirming by words and conduct false impressions\n\nof facts that were “likely to affect the judgment of OmniAmerican...” that Appellee\n\ndid not believe to be true (F11-00183/05-13-00423-CR) (CR-180, 429); and (4) that\n\nhis Inwood National Bank account contained $102,174.00 (F11-00191/05-13-\n\n00424-CR) (CR-180, 430). See Tex. Pen. Code § 32.32 (2009).\n\n       After conducting his own investigation, Appellee uncovered compelling\n\ncircumstantial evidence that Lisa Blue, a Democratic Party operative and attorney –\n\n\n1\n The Clerk’s Record (three unsealed and two sealed volumes, three supplemental volumes, and a\nsupplemental sealed volume) is cited as “CR” followed by the last three digits of the cause number\nfor the three volumes (or “-Supp-Aug02”), followed by the page number. The Reporter’s Record\n(five volumes) is cited as “RR” following by the volume number and page number, or the exhibit\nnumber of the exhibits volume (RR5) followed by the “PDF” page number of RR5.\n\n\n                                               13\n\fwho at the time was involved in civil litigation against Appellee over a fee dispute –\n\ncorruptly influenced then-Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins\n\n(“Watkins”),2 who in turn authorized obtaining the four indictments against\n\nAppellee. Appellee filed a Motion to Quash and Dismiss the Indictment Due to\n\nProsecutorial Misconduct (“Motion to Dismiss”). (CR-180, 31-488). The Motion to\n\nDismiss alleged that Appellee’s constitutional rights to due process and equal\n\nprotection were violated due to Blue’s corruptly influencing Watkins, and as a result,\n\nAppellee was: (1) selectively prosecuted; (2) vindictively prosecuted; and\n\n(3) deprived of his right to a disinterested prosecutor. (CR-180, 32-67). At the time\n\nthat the indictments were returned against Appellee, Blue and Appellee were\n\nembroiled in a fee dispute litigation before the United States District Court, Northern\n\nDistrict of Texas, in which Blue was seeking over $50 million. (RR2, 20-21; CR-\n\n180, 32-34).\n\n       Based on the evidenced proffered by Appellee that was attached to the Motion\n\nto Dismiss, on February 14, 2013, the trial court found that Appellee was entitled to\n\na hearing. (RR2, 28). The trial court required Appellee to first question Blue. (RR2,\n\n28-30).    After Blue invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\n\n\n\n\n2\n On November 4, 2014, Watkins was the only democrat to lose a county-wide election in Dallas\nCounty. See Susan Hawk ousts Craig Watkins in heated race for Dallas County DA,\nhttp://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/local-politics/20141105-susan-hawk-ousts-craig-\nwatkins-in-heated-race-for-dallas-county-da.ece, last accessed on July 17, 2015.\n                                             14\n\fincrimination, which prevented Appellee from obtaining the information by other\n\nmeans, Appellee was permitted to call Watkins as a witness. (RR2, 47-49). The\n\ntrial court ordered an evidentiary hearing on the limited question of Blue’s influence\n\non Watkins’s decision to pursue indictments against Appellee, so that the scope of\n\nAppellee’s questioning of Watkins would be limited to Watkins’s conversations with\n\nBlue. (RR2, 27-28, 47-49). The questioning of Watkins did not take place during\n\nthe February 14, 2013 hearing because Watkins claimed through counsel that\n\nalthough he was in the courthouse, he suddenly became “ill” and thus could not\n\ntestify. (RR2, 54-64).\n\n       Arguing that Appellee was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing, the State\n\nsought mandamus relief and a stay of the hearing from the Fifth Court of Appeals of\n\nDallas and from this Court.3 The State’s petitions for writs of mandamus were\n\ndenied. On March 7, 2013, the evidentiary hearing was held. (RR3).\n\n       During the evidentiary hearing on March 7, 2013, the State admitted that the\n\nhome-equity loan (which was the subject of the indictments) was never in arrears,\n\nhad been fully repaid before the commencement of any criminal investigation, and\n\nthat the indictments against Appellee are “unprecedented.” (RR4, 49, 126, 129,\n\n\n\n\n3\n Appellee asks this Court to take judicial notice of the fact that on March 1, 2013, the State filed\nfor mandamus relief in the Fifth Court of Appeals in Cause Numbers 05-13-00298-CV, 05-13-\n00299-CV, 05-13-00300-CV, 05-13-00301-CV, and 05-13-00302-CV; and again on March 6,\n2013 in this Court in Cause Number WR-79,189-01.\n                                                15\n\f155). Watkins made a blanket assertion of privilege and work product protection,\n\nand refused to answer any questions. (RR4, 15-17). The trial court overruled\n\nWatkins’s objections, and further found that the State had waived privilege with\n\nrespect to the issues before the court. (RR4, 16-17).\n\n      After Watkins refused to testify, Appellee examined several assistant district\n\nattorneys. (RR4, 34-189). After this testimony, the trial court gave Watkins another\n\nopportunity to testify, and he again refused. (RR4, 195).\n\n      The trial court found that Watkins’s refusal to testify denied Appellee “his\n\nright to have a meaningful hearing” on his Motion to Dismiss. (RR4, 219). The trial\n\ncourt also found that the State failed to rebut Appellee’s prima facie showing of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct. (RR4, 219).\n\n      On March 7, 2013, the 204th District Court dismissed with prejudice (“Order\n\nGranting Motion to Dismiss”) the four indictments against Appellee under cause\n\nnumbers F11-00180, F11-00182, F11-00183, and F11-00191. (RR4, 219; CR-180,\n\n1100; CR-182, 978; CR-183, 977; CR-191, 894).\n\n      The State appealed the Order Granting Motion to Dismiss to the Court of\n\nAppeals. The State raised four issues. The second issue raised by the State was\n\n“Whether the trial court abused its discretion by granting Appellee an evidentiary\n\nhearing—and then dismissing the indictments—where the facts he alleged failed to\n\nestablish any constitutional violation.” See Hill, 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835.\n\n\n                                         16\n\f         On December 29, 2014, the Court of Appeals: (1) sustained the State’s second\n\nissue and concluded that Appellee “did not make the proper showing sufficient to\n\nestablish a prima facie case...” of the fact that the former elected district attorney of\n\nDallas County engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by allowing himself to be\n\ncorruptly influenced by a political ally in return for indicting Appellee; (2) found\n\nthat the trial court erred in conducting a hearing on Appellee’s motion to dismiss\n\nbased upon prosecutorial misconduct; (3) vacated the trial court’s March 7, 2013\n\norder granting Appellee’s motion to dismiss; and (4) remanded the case to the trial\n\ncourt to reinstate the indictments against Appellee. Hill, id. at *36-38.\n\n         On February 23, 2015, Appellee filed a petition for discretionary review,\n\nwhich was granted on June 10, 2015. Appellee now presents the following Opening\n\nBrief.\n\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fVI. Statement Regarding Oral Argument\n\n      Oral argument has been allowed, and Appellee requests oral argument. See\n\nTex. Rule App. Proc. 68.4(c) (2015). As explained in the petition for discretionary\n\nreview, and provided in greater detail below, the issues presented in this petition\n\nmay be issues of first impression. As a result, Appellee believes that this Court’s\n\ndecisional process will be significantly aided by oral argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fVII. Issues Presented\n\nIssue One: To establish a prima facie case of selective prosecution in violation of\nthe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and to obtain a hearing under the\n“presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness” method, a defendant must provide\n“some evidence” that shows: (1) the government singled out the defendant for\nprosecution and has not proceeded against others similarly situated based on the type\nof conduct for which the defendant is charged; and (2) the government’s\ndiscriminatory selection is invidious. Once the defendant makes this showing, the\nburden shifts to the State to justify the discriminatory treatment.\n\nAppellee asks this Court to clarify what constitutes “some evidence” and hold that\nso long as a defendant attaches a proffer of evidence to a motion to dismiss due to\nprosecutorial misconduct, the trial court in its discretion determines to present a\ncolorable claim of a constitutional violation, the defendant has attached “some\nevidence,” and the trial court should have the discretion to conduct a hearing on the\nmotion to dismiss. Appellee also asks this Court to find that Appellee not only\nattached “some evidence” showing a constitutional violation, but in fact attached\n“exceptionally clear evidence.”\n\nFinally, Appellee asks this Court to find that the Court of Appeals erred when it: (1)\nsustained the State’s second issue and concluded that Appellee “did not make the\nproper showing sufficient to establish a prima facie case...” of the fact that the former\nelected district attorney of Dallas County engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by\nallowing himself to be corruptly influenced by a political ally in return for indicting\nAppellee; (2) found that the trial court erred in conducting a hearing on Appellee’s\nmotion to dismiss based upon prosecutorial misconduct; (3) vacated the trial court’s\nOrder Granting Motion to Dismiss; and (4) remanded the case to the trial court to\nreinstate the indictments against Appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\fVIII. Facts\n\n      1.    Watkins’s “investigation” of Appellee\n      On February 18, 2010, in a civil case in which Appellee and his father (Hill\n\nJr.) were opposing parties, a United States district judge signed an order finding that\n\nHill Jr.: (1) submitted summary judgment materials in bad faith and with the intent\n\nof committing fraud on the Court, and (2) lied under oath. (RR5, DX-1, 100). The\n\nfederal judge also found that Hill Jr.’s attorney had “far exceeded the bounds of\n\nadvocacy, permissible or otherwise.” (RR5, DF-PT-3, 100).\n\n      Days later, on February 22, 2010, alleging that Appellee had committed\n\nmortgage fraud in connection with a home equity loan he had obtained from\n\nOmniAmerican, Hill Jr.’s attorney submitted a written complaint to Donna\n\nStrittmatter, head of the Specialized Crime Division of the Dallas County District\n\nAttorney’s Office. (RR4, 75-76; RR5, SX-1, 8-66). Hill Jr. alleged that Appellee\n\nmisrepresented his ownership interest in his primary residence that was used as\n\ncollateral for the loan because at the time, the residence had been 80% owned by a\n\ntrust of which both Appellee and Hill Jr. are beneficiaries. (RR4, 87-88; RR5, SX-\n\n1, 8).     Strittmatter and assistant district attorney Stephanie Martin obtained\n\npermission to conduct an investigation of this allegation from First Assistant District\n\nAttorney Terri Moore. (RR4, 44-45).\n\n      Blue claims that in May 2010, while she was representing Appellee, in\n\nresponse to a story in D Magazine suggesting that the District Attorney’s Office was\n                                          20\n\finvestigating Appellee and his wife concerning the loan from OmniAmerican, Blue\n\nmet with Moore. (RR4, 46-47; CR-180, 854-855; CR-182, 178; CR-183, 178; CR-\n\n191, 177). In an effort to persuade the District Attorney’s Office to abandon its\n\ninvestigation of Appellee, Blue presented Moore with a copy of the federal court\n\norder that found that Hill Jr. committed perjury. (RR4, 46-47; RR5, DX-1, 97-103.\n\nMoore did not confirm or deny whether the office was investigating Appellee. (RR4,\n\n47:11–13).     However, after meeting with Blue, Moore provided Martin and\n\nStrittmatter a copy of the federal court order and told them that Hill Jr. could not be\n\nused as a witness in the State’s case. (RR4, 48).\n\n      2.     Fee dispute between Blue and Appellee\n      On July 7, 2010, after: (1) Appellee rejected a $30 million fee for Blue and\n\ntwo other attorneys associated with her (Aldous and Malouf), and (2) United States\n\nMagistrate Judge Paul Stickney rejected the fee recommendation, Blue filed a\n\nmotion to withdraw from representing Appellee in the federal civil case, and became\n\nAppellee’s adversary in a civil fee dispute. (CR-180, 678-682; CR-182, 586-587;\n\nCR-183, 585-586).\n\n      Shortly after the global settlement agreement and final judgment were entered\n\nin the federal civil proceeding between Appellee and Hill Jr., on December 7, 2010,\n\nBlue and her associated attorneys filed a complaint in federal court against Appellee\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fand his wife, seeking to recover over $50 million on the settlement. (RR5, DX-1,\n\n117-123, 139, 408).\n\n     3.   Trustee for Hill Jr.’s trust contacts Martin\n     On September 8, 2010, about seven months after Hill Jr.’s attorney submitted\n\nthe complaint to the District Attorney’s Office, the trustee for the Hill Jr. trust,\n\ncontacted Martin by phone and in writing, urging Martin to pursue indictments\n\nagainst Appellee and his wife. (RR4, 145-147). Martin’s handwritten notes reflect\n\nthat she told Mr. Pickett that OmniAmerican “...really isn’t interested in\n\nprosecuting,” and that she “didn’t see how [she] could prove his criminal case,”\n\nespecially since the “victim” (OmniAmerican) suffered no harm and did not want to\n\nprosecute. (RR4, 183-185, 201; RR5, DX-8; 1084). After her discussion with\n\nPickett, Moore directed Martin to move forward with the investigation. (RR4, 186-\n\n187, 191; RR5, DX-8, 1084).\n\n     4.   Communications between Blue and Watkins during the lead-up to\n          the indictments\n     On January 7, 2011, about one month after filing the $50-million-plus fee\n\ndispute suit against Appellee, Blue met with Watkins. (RR5, DX-4, 1075-1076).\n\n     On or about January 12, 2011, Martin conducted a “pitch session” regarding\n\nthe investigation against Appellee and his wife, to determine whether the State\n\nshould seek indictments against Appellee and his wife. (RR4, 35-36, 120-125, 166).\n\nWatkins, Moore, and Strittmatter all attended the pitch session, during which\n\n                                        22\n\fWatkins asked a number of questions, gave his opinion regarding the real estate title\n\nissues at the center of the allegations against Appellee and his wife, and even\n\nsuggested additional charges Martin should consider bringing against Appellee and\n\nhis wife. (RR4, 163:3–7, 163:15–165:19).\n\n     A few days later, on January 15, 2011, Blue again met with Watkins. (RR5,\n\nDX-4, 1025).\n\n     Two days later, on January 17, 2011, Blue and associated attorneys entered\n\ninto a written agreement with Appellee and his wife to litigate the fee dispute in\n\nfederal court in early April 2011. (RR5, DX-1, 141-144).\n\n     On January 20, 2011, three days later, Blue met Watkins for dinner, which was\n\npaid for by Blue. (RR5, DX-3; DX-4, 1019, 1077-1078).\n\n     The next morning, on January 21, 2011, Blue called Watkins at 10:51 a.m.\n\n(RR5, DX-1, 386, 426). Watkins returned Blue’s call at 10:54 a.m., which was\n\nanswered by Blue in the presence of associated attorney Malouf. (RR5, DX-1, 395-\n\n397, 426). Under oath, Blue admitted that during this call, Watkins raised the topic\n\nof indicting Appellee and his wife, saying “there could be an indictment or are you\n\nstill interested in the indictments,” and Blue claims to have told Watkins that she\n\ncould not talk to him about Appellee and his wife. (RR5, DX-1, 171-174). However,\n\nBlue’s telephone records show she called Watkins back at 11:13 a.m. on the same\n\nday, and they had another conversation lasting six minutes. (RR5, 426).\n\n\n                                         23\n\f     Blue called Watkins several more times between March 3 and 10, 2011. (RR5,\n\nDX-1, 361-364, 426). Blue also met with Watkins on March 3, 2011 to take\n\npublicity photos in connection with a $100,000 donation Blue made to SMU Law\n\nSchool in 2010 in Watkins’s honor. (RR5, DX-3, DX-4, 995, 1025).\n\n     Despite the fact that Watkins was not running for office, and in fact in\n\nNovember 2010 had been reelected and would not face another election until 2014,\n\non March 9, 2011, Blue held a campaign fundraiser for Watkins at her home. (RR5,\n\nDX-4, 1031-1047, 1079-1080). Blue’s invitations encouraged the invitees to donate\n\nto Watkins because it was going to be a “tight race.” (RR5, DX-4, 1031-1047, 1079-\n\n1080). Blue personally contributed $5,000 to Watkins, and raised thousands of\n\ndollars from other donors. (RR5, DX-2, 872-890).\n\n     On March 22 and 24, 2011, Blue contacted Watkins while attending\n\ndepositions, including her own, in connection with the fee dispute with Appellee.\n\n(RR5, DX-1, 279-280, 301-302, DX-4, 157, 368-369, 377, 390-391, 426, 1025).\n\n     Without question, Watkins had the ultimate authority to determine whether\n\nAppellee and his wife would be indicted. (RR4, 43:10–14, 191:13–18). Watkins\n\nwas the final decision-maker, and the indictments would not have been presented to\n\nthe grand jury without his approval. (RR4, 166, 191).\n\n     Watkins approved the presentation of the case against Appellee and his wife\n\nto the grand jury. (RR4, 163, 166). As a result, on March 29, 2011, about two weeks\n\n\n                                        24\n\fbefore the fee trial between Appellee and Blue was set to begin, Martin presented\n\nthe case against Appellee and his wife to the grand jury. (RR4, 167; RR5, SX-4, 85-\n\n88). That same night, Watkins sought to meet Blue for drinks. (RR5, DX-3, DX-4,\n\n1012, 1025-1026). The following night, Watkins and Blue met for dinner at an\n\nupscale restaurant in Dallas. (RR5, DX-3, DX-4, 1012, 1025-1026, 1081-1082).\n\n     Blue admitted in her deposition in the fee dispute litigation with Appellee that\n\nWatkins called her and raised the subject of the indictments of Appellee and his wife\n\nat least one time after the January 21, 2011 phone call. (RR5, DX-1, 175-176). Blue\n\nplaced numerous calls to numbers associated with Watkins, in addition to the call on\n\nJanuary 21, 2011. Blue’s phone records also indicate that she received one telephone\n\ncall from Watkins’s cell phone, on the evening of March 30, 2011 – the same night\n\nshe had dinner with Watkins at the Dallas restaurant, and one day after the cases\n\nwere presented to the grand jury. (RR5, DX-1, 344, 371-372, 386, 426-427)\n\n     In pleadings, the State claims that Watkins may have discussed the impending\n\nindictments with Blue for the purposes of furthering the investigation. (CR-180,\n\n625-626; RR2, 52-53). Although the State also took the position that Watkins had\n\nno role in the investigation (RR3, 24; RR4, 214), Watkins continued to discuss\n\nindictments with Blue after the charges had been presented to the grand jury. (RR5,\n\nDX-1, 175-176).\n\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\f     5.   On March 31, 2011, two weeks before beginning of the fee dispute\n          trial between Appellee and Blue, the indictments are returned\n          against Appellee\n     About two weeks before the scheduled start of the fee dispute trial between\n\nAppellee and Blue, the indictments against Appellee and his wife were returned on\n\nMarch 31, 2011, and made public on April 4, 2011. (RR5, DX-1, 141, 146-147; CR-\n\n180, 162; CR-182, 158; CR-183, 158; CR-191, 157).\n\n     6.   On April 11, 2011, Blue makes another “contribution” to Watkins\n     Nine days after the indictments against Appellee were returned, and four days\n\nafter the indictments were made public, on April 8, 2011, Blue contacted Watkins’s\n\nwife and Watkins’s assistant for the purpose of delivering an additional $1,000\n\n“contribution” to Watkins. (RR5, DX-4, 1026). This “contribution” occurred five\n\nmonths after Watkins had been reelected district attorney. Blue had no further\n\ntelephone communications with Watkins until the evening of April 27, 2011, when\n\nBlue called Watkins shortly after she testified at trial in the fee dispute against\n\nAppellee. (RR5, DX-1, 427).\n\n     7.   Fee dispute trial between Appellee and Blue\n     After Appellee was indicted, he moved to stay his fee dispute trial against Blue\n\nand her associated attorneys until the criminal charges were resolved. (RR5, DX-1,\n\n406-411). Blue objected to the stay, and the district court granted a two-day\n\ncontinuance. (RR5, DX-1, 410). The district court trial on Blue’s claims against\n\nAppellee took place between April 20, 2011 and April 28, 2011. Due to the criminal\n\n                                        26\n\fcharges, Appellee and his wife exercised their Fifth Amendment privilege and did\n\nnot testify during the fee-dispute trial. (RR5, DX-1, 415-416, 421). On December\n\n31, 2011, the federal district court awarded Blue and her associated attorneys\n\n$21,942,961.00 in attorney’s fees, of which Blue was entitled to one-third, or\n\napproximately $7.3 million. (RR5, DX-1, 106, 128).\n\n     8.    Appellee files the Motion to Dismiss and proffers 45 exhibits and 416\n           pages of evidence in support of the motion.\n     On November 16, 2012, Appellee filed the Motion to Dismiss, asserting his\n\nconstitutional rights to Due Process and Equal Protection were violated because, due\n\nto Blue’s bribing and influence of Watkins, Appellee was: (1) selectively prosecuted;\n\n(2) vindictively prosecuted; and (3) deprived of his right to a disinterested\n\nprosecutor. (CR-180, 31-488). Attached to the Motion to Dismiss and proffered to\n\nthe court were 45 exhibits and 416 pages of evidence. (CR-180, 72-488). The\n\nproffered evidence includes the following (CR-180, 36-488):\n\n    The case against Appellee was referred to the District Attorney’s Office by\n     the attorney for Hill Jr., who is an adverse party to Appellee in a federal\n     lawsuit.\n\n    On February 18, 2010, a judge in the United States District Court, Northern\n     District of Texas, entered an order finding that Hill Jr.: (1) submitted summary\n     judgment materials in bad faith and with the intent of committing fraud on the\n     Court, and (2) lied under oath. The district court also found that Hill Jr.’s\n     attorney had “far exceeded the bounds of advocacy, permissible or\n     otherwise.”\n\n\n\n\n                                         27\n\f Four days later, on February 22, 2010, Hill Jr.’s father submitted a letter to\n  the district attorney’s office in which he accused Appellee and his wife of\n  mortgage fraud.\n\n A few months later, Tillotson, the partner of Hill Jr.’s attorney, donated nearly\n  $50,000 to Watkins’s reelection campaign. Neither Tillotson nor other\n  members of his firm previously contributed to Watkins’s campaigns, but the\n  contributions immediately made Tillotson one of Watkins’s largest individual\n  contributors.\n\n The mortgage fraud allegations were dubious at best because the home equity\n  loan obtained by Appellee was never in default, was repaid in full just a few\n  months after it was obtained, long before Watkins considered criminal charges\n  against Appellee and was fully secured at all times by Appellee’s undisputed\n  equity in the subject home.\n\n OmniAmerican did not suffer any loss, was never at risk of suffering any loss,\n  and never complained to authorities that Appellee did anything wrong or\n  committed any crime.\n\n The District Attorney’s Office did not interview witnesses such as the loan\n  officer or the mortgage broker, before indicting Appellee.\n\n Despite the District Attorney’s Office’s policy that defense attorneys would\n  be provided notice of grand jury proceedings and an opportunity to present\n  their case to the grand jury, no such notice was given to Appellee or his\n  attorneys. In fact, First Assistant Moore, who was a witness during the motion\n  to dismiss hearing, told Texas Lawyer that it was “all about fairness... This is\n  not a railroad we are running...this is a justice system.”\n\n Beginning in November 2009, Appellee was represented for about six months\n  in the federal litigation by a group of attorneys that included Blue. Blue\n  bragged to Appellee about her relationship with Watkins, and specifically told\n  Appellee about her personal friendship with Watkins, generous campaign\n  contributions Blue gave to Watkins, and pro bono representation of Watkins\n  as his personal lawyer.\n\n\n\n\n                                      28\n\f While representing Appellee, Blue even discussed ways she might use her\n  influence with Watkins to intimidate opposing counsel in the federal\n  litigation.\n\n Shortly after the federal litigation settled in May 2010, Blue and the two\n  attorneys with whom she represented Appellee demanded $50 million in\n  attorney’s fees for six months of work. When Appellee refused, Blue and the\n  other attorneys withdrew from representing him and filed suit against\n  Appellee for their fees.\n\n Two weeks before this fee dispute trial was set to begin in federal court on\n  April 18, 2011, Appellee learned that he had been indicted. As a result of the\n  indictments, Appellee was advised to not take the stand during the fee dispute\n  trial.\n\n The federal court entered a judgment against Appellee and his wife for more\n  than $34 million, which was later reduced to $21.9 million, with Blue\n  personally standing to receive one-third of the judgment, or about $7.3\n  million.\n\n Appellee then obtained discovery from Blue regarding her communications\n  with the District Attorney’s Office. During a deposition, Blue admitted that\n  Watkins had called her before the indictments were returned to attempt to\n  discuss potential charges against Appellee. Blue stated that Watkins told her\n  that “there could be an indictment or are you still interested in the\n  indictments,” or words to that effect.\n\n Through the discovery, it was revealed that a dramatic spike in\n  communications between Blue and Watkins occurred in the days and weeks\n  before the indictments were obtained. These communications included calls\n  between Blue and both Watkins’s office and cellphone numbers.\n\n On March 30, 2011, the day before indictments against Appellee were\n  presented to the grand jury, Blue and Watkins communicated seven times via\n  Watkins’s cellphone number.\n\n Campaign finance records reflect that on March 9, 2011, which was about\n  three weeks before the indictments were presented, the Watkins campaign\n  accepted a $5,000 donation from Blue. This was despite the fact that\n\n                                     29\n\f   Watkins’s “reelection campaign” had ended months earlier (Watkins had been\n   reelected in November 2010).\n\n Around the same time, Blue solicited others who donated thousands more to\n  Watkins.\n\n About 18 months after Appellee was indicted, on October 12, 2012,\n  Appellee’s counsel met with assistant district attorney Deborah Smith, who\n  took over the cases against Appellee long after the indictment. Smith\n  described a “re-evaluation” of the cases, and said that she had already\n  determined that she would recommend dismissing certain charges against\n  both Appellee and his wife (who was also indicted). Smith also told\n  Appellee’s counsel that she was conducting “due diligence” interviews of\n  witnesses regarding the remaining charges, and would eventually make a\n  recommendation regarding those charges as well.\n\n Smith expressed significant concerns about the cases against Appellee and his\n  wife, made clear that she (Smith) had no role in obtaining the indictments,\n  further stated that the interviews of witnesses she was conducting should have\n  been conducted much earlier, and also stated that she would refuse to try the\n  case if her office decided to go forward on any of the charges. Smith conveyed\n  several reasons why the charges against Appellee were without merit. Smith\n  requested that certain information be put in a written submission for her to use\n  in connection with her recommendations.\n\n Smith “apologized” on behalf of the District Attorney’s Office.\n\n On October 19, 2012, Appellee’s counsel emailed the written submission to\n  Smith.\n\n Shortly after the meeting with Smith, the District Attorney’s Office filed a\n  motion to dismiss all charges against Appellee’s wife.\n\n On October 22, 2012, in response to the email from Appellee’s counsel, Smith\n  stated that even though she was in the middle of a “reevaluation” of the cases\n  against Appellee and his wife, which had already caused Smith to recommend\n  and obtain dismissals against Appellee’s wife, Smith had been removed from\n  the Hill case effective the previous Friday and was reassigned to a different\n  department.\n\n                                      30\n\f        After considering Appellee’s Motion to Dismiss and the proffered evidence,\n\nwhich included sworn deposition testimony from Blue and Malouf, telephone\n\nrecords and emails produced by Blue, Watkins’s campaign finance records, and\n\nother materials, the trial court set a hearing date of February 18, 2013 on the motion\n\n(the first hearing ultimately took place on February 14, 2013). (CR-180, 501-502;\n\nCR-182, 496; CR-183, 495; CR-191, 496).\n\n        9.   The lead-up to the hearing held on February 14, 2013\n        On January 22, 2013, Appellee served subpoenas on Watkins and other\n\nmembers of the District Attorney’s Office, seeking to compel testimony and the\n\nproduction of documents in connection with the evidentiary hearing. (CR-180, 540-\n\n546, 567-573). The subpoenas requested additional evidence of communications\n\nbetween Watkins and Blue relating to Appellee and his wife. (CR-180, 545-46, 571-\n\n573).\n\n        In response to the subpoenas, the State filed a series of motions to quash and\n\nmoved for a protective order, arguing that the State had a privilege under the work\n\nproduct doctrine not to provide any of the information sought by Appellee’s\n\nsubpoenas. (CR-180, 523-573).\n\n        On February 12, 2013, Blue voluntarily filed an affidavit in which she testified\n\nabout certain communications with Watkins concerning the indictments. (CR-180,\n\n853-856).\n\n                                           31\n\f     10. Hearing on February 14, 2013 – trial court rules that Appellee made\n         a prima facie showing on each of his claims and was entitled to an\n         evidentiary hearing concerning whether Watkins was influenced by\n         Blue with respect to the decision to approve the indictments of\n         Appellee and his wife\n     On February 14, 2013, the trial court ruled that in the Motion to Dismiss and\n\nthe evidence proffered with the motion, Appellee made a prima facie showing on\n\neach of his claims and was entitled to an evidentiary hearing concerning whether\n\nWatkins was influenced by Blue with respect to the decision to approve the\n\nindictments of Appellee and his wife. (RR2, 27-28). The trial court found that\n\nAppellee was entitled to examine both Blue and Watkins about their discussions\n\nwith each other concerning the indictments. (RR2, 28-29, 41).\n\n     Then, counsel for Blue informed the trial court that Blue was being criminally\n\ninvestigated on the issues raised in the Motion to Dismiss. (RR2, 6). Appellee was\n\ndirected by the trial court to call Blue to the witness stand. (RR2, 29-30). Although\n\nBlue submitted the affidavit just two days earlier that addressed the topics on which\n\nshe was to be examined (CR-180, 853-856), Blue refused to testify after invoking\n\nthe Fifth Amendment. (CR-180, 852-856; RR2, 46-48). In response to the single\n\nsubstantive question of: “[D]id you discuss potential indictments against Albert and\n\n[Erin] Hill with [Watkins] in March of 2011?”, Blue invoked her privilege. (RR2,\n\n48). Blue also refused to answer any other questions. (RR2, 48).\n\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\f      Appellee called Watkins to the stand. (RR2, 49). Through an assistant district\n\nattorney, the State announced that Watkins would not testify about his conversations\n\nwith Blue because such conversations were supposedly “work product.” (RR2, 51-\n\n54, 56-58). On behalf of Watkins, the State also claimed law enforcement and\n\nexecutive privileges. (CR-180, 554-558; RR2, 66). The trial court overruled these\n\nobjections.\n\n      Then the State claimed that although Watkins was in the building and in his\n\noffice, he was too ill to testify. (RR2, 66-67). In reliance on this representation, the\n\ntrial court granted the State a continuance, and rescheduled the hearing for March 7,\n\n2013. (RR2, 71-72).\n\n      11. Between March 1 and 6, 2013, the State files for mandamus in the\n          Court of Appeals and this Court, all of which are denied\n      On March 1, 2013, the State filed a Petition For Writ of Mandamus And\n\nMotion For Temporary Relief, asking the Court of Appeals to enjoin the trial court’s\n\nscheduled hearing on the following grounds: (1) Watkins’s testimony was\n\nprivileged; and (2) Appellee was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. (CR-180,\n\n1163-1202; CR-182, 1042-1081; CR-183, 1041-1080; CR-191, 789-839).\n\n      On March 6, 2013, the day before the hearing was to take place, the Fifth\n\nDistrict Court of Appeals denied the State’s petition. (CR-191, 841).\n\n      On the same day, the State filed a Petition for Writ of Prohibition and Petition\n\nfor Writ of Mandamus and Motion for Temporary Stay in Proceedings to this Court.\n\n                                          33\n\f(CR-180, 1215-1259; CR-191, 843-874, 876).           This Court denied the State’s\n\npetition.\n\n        On the morning of the hearing, March 7, 2013, the State made a third attempt\n\nto stop the hearing, which also was rejected by this Court. (CR-191, 878-883, 885;\n\nRR4, 25-26).\n\n        12. Hearing on March 7, 2013 – trial court draws an adverse inference\n            and dismisses the indictments against Appellee\n        At the beginning of the hearing on March 7, 2013, Blue’s counsel represented\n\nto the trial court that based upon Blue’s Fifth Amendment rights, Blue would once\n\nagain refuse to testify in response to substantive questions. Blue was excused. (RR4,\n\n7-8).\n\n        Appellee then called Watkins to testify. Watkins first was asked the following\n\nquestion: “Mr. Watkins, before the indictments of Appellee and his wife were\n\nhanded down, you had at least one or more phone calls with Lisa Blue concerning\n\n(Appellee and his wife), correct?” Watkins answered: “Based on the advice of my\n\ncounsel and of the advice of my staff with the District Attorney’s Office, I am\n\nrefusing to answer any questions that you may pose be—because of my right as an\n\nattorney to have the privilege and to protect my work product.” (RR4, 15).\n\n        Then Watkins was asked: “You said to Blue, words to the effect of, ‘There\n\ncould be an indictment of Appellee, or both the Hills. Are you still interested in the\n\n\n\n                                           34\n\findictments?’ Correct, sir?” (RR4, 15). In response to this question, Watkins again\n\nclaimed attorney and work-product privileges. (RR4, 15).\n\n     The trial court overruled Watkins’s objections and directed him to answer\n\nthese questions. (RR4, 15). Watkins refused. (RR4, 15)\n\n     Appellee called to the witness stand Strittmatter and Martin, both of whom\n\nwere then employed by the District Attorney’s Office, and also Moore, who at the\n\ntime of the hearing was the former First Assistant. Strittmatter, Martin, and Moore\n\nhad already submitted sworn statements discussing the State’s investigation of\n\nAppellee and his wife, and the decision to present the cases to the grand jury for\n\nindictment. (CR-180, 773-778; CR-182, 682-686; CR-183, 681-685; CR-191, 782-\n\n785; RR4, 12-13, 40).\n\n     It was revealed that the State’s “investigation” of Appellee and his wife relied\n\nextensively on materials submitted by Hill Jr., who the State knew to have recently\n\ncommitted perjury. (RR4, 103, 141-142). The State never issued grand jury\n\nsubpoenas to Hill Jr. or to his trust. (RR4, 103, 141-142). In fact, before seeking\n\nindictments against Appellee and his wife, although Martin had spoken to Hill Jr.,\n\nhis attorney, and someone in the general counsel’s office at OmniAmerican, the State\n\nnever conducted interviews with the loan officer at OmniAmerican, the mortgage\n\nbroker who presented the application to OmniAmerican, the title company who\n\n\n\n\n                                        35\n\fconducted the title search on the property at issue, Appellee, his wife, or counsel for\n\nAppellee and his wife. (RR4, 94:5–96:4, 141:3–17, 156:16–57:6).\n\n      On October 12, 2012, counsel for Appellee met with assistant district attorney\n\nDeborah Smith, to whom the case had then-been reassigned. (RR4, 216-218; CR-\n\n180-Supp-Aug02, 92). During this meeting, Smith apologized for how the State\n\nhandled the cases against Appellee and his wife, indicated that she was conducting\n\n“due diligence” interviews of witnesses, and stated that she would recommend\n\ndismissing certain or all of the charges against both Appellee and his wife. Id. Later\n\nthat same day, the District Attorney’s Office moved to dismiss all charges against\n\nErin Hill (Appellee’s wife) “in the interest of justice.” Id.\n\n      Smith was soon removed from the case and reassigned to the animal cruelty\n\nunit. Id. The indictments against Appellee were reassigned to Strittmatter. (CR-\n\n180, 487; CR-182, 483; CR-183, 483; CR-191, 482).\n\n      The State also admitted that the charges against Appellee are “unprecedented.”\n\n(RR4, 49-50, 126-129, 155).        This stems from the fact that underlying these\n\nindictments, the loan was funded, was paid as expected, was repaid in full, and there\n\nwas no complaint from OmniAmerican. Id. And, Appellee’s undisputed 20 percent\n\nownership interest in the property was sufficient to fully secure the entire of loan,\n\nso not only was there no loss, there was never any risk of loss. (RR4, 88-89).\n\n\n\n\n                                           36\n\f     Further, despite the fact that Martin’s handwritten notes reflect that she told\n\nPickett that OmniAmerican “...really isn’t interested in prosecuting,” and that she\n\n“didn’t see how [she] could prove his criminal case,” especially since the “victim”\n\n(OmniAmerican) suffered no harm and did not want to prosecute, (RR4, 183-185,\n\n201; RR5, DX-8; 1084), Martin testified that she had always believed that the case\n\nagainst Appellee was “strong” and certain to be indicted from the moment it was\n\nfirst reported to the office by Hill Jr.’s attorney. (RR4, 149-150, 171). By adding\n\nundated additional language that contradicted what she had written over two years\n\nearlier, Martin also admitted during the hearing that she augmented her September\n\n2010 notes in a manner that was calculated to make them appear more favorable to\n\nthe State. (RR4, 188-189).\n\n     Finally, although Moore testified that a defense attorney’s request to address\n\nthe grand jury is routinely accommodated by a prosecutor before seeking\n\nindictments, and in this case, Blue in substance made such a request on behalf of\n\nAppellee when she met with Moore in May 2010, neither Appellee nor his new\n\ncounsel were ever informed that criminal charges were being contemplated. (RR4,\n\n53-56).\n\n     During the hearing, the State did not object to Appellee calling Strittmatter,\n\nMartin, and Moore; in fact, the State previously invited Appellee to question Martin,\n\noffering that Martin could “respond[ ] to the inquiries regarding the progression of\n\n\n                                         37\n\fthe—of the—investigation” and could fully “respond to [Appellee’s] allegations.”\n\n(RR3, 15-16). The State invoked no work-product objections to any questions\n\nduring the course of the testimony of Strittmatter, Martin, and Moore. Nor did the\n\nState attempt to limit the scope of the testimony of Strittmatter, Martin, and Moore\n\nduring the hearing.      Strittmatter, Martin, and Moore were allowed to testify\n\nextensively regarding the State’s investigation of Appellee and his wife, the “pitch\n\nsession,” Watkins’s involvement in the “pitch session,” and internal deliberations\n\nregarding the State’s decision to indict Appellee and his wife. The State elicited\n\ntestimony concerning the events at issue and introduced into evidence internal work\n\nproduct, including a PowerPoint presentation that was used by Martin at the “pitch\n\nsession.” (RR5, SX-2, 68-76).\n\n     The State also stipulated to the authenticity and admissibility of nearly all of\n\nthe evidence attached to Appellee’s Motion, including the sworn deposition\n\ntestimony, Blue’s phone records and emails, and Watkins’s campaign finance\n\nreports. (RR4, 29-31).\n\n     13. The trial court’s findings and dismissal of the indictments against\n         Appellee\n     The trial court did not put “much credibility” in Moore’s testimony due to\n\nMoore’s relationship with Blue and Watkins. (RR4, 191). And, the trial court did\n\nnot find Martin’s testimony credible. It further found that the testimony of the Moore\n\nand Martin was not sufficient to answer the question of whether Watkins’s decision\n\n                                         38\n\fto approve the indictments of Appellee and his wife was improperly influenced by\n\nhis relationship with Blue. (RR4, 188-191, 216).\n\n        Before the conclusion of the March 7, 2013 hearing, the trial court gave\n\nWatkins another opportunity to testify, and he again refused to do so. (RR4, 191-\n\n195).\n\n        The trial court concluded that an adverse inference was appropriate as to Blue\n\nbased on her invocation of the Fifth Amendment and refusal to answer questions\n\nabout her conversations with Watkins. (RR4, 196).\n\n        The trial court dismissed the indictments against Appellee, concluding that he\n\nhad been denied the right to a meaningful hearing regarding the alleged\n\nconstitutional violation due to Watkins’s refusal to testify, Blue’s invocation of her\n\nFifth Amendment privilege, and that the State had failed to rebut Appellee’s prima\n\nfacie showing of prosecutorial misconduct. (RR4, 219).\n\n        The trial court issued an order dated March 7, 2013 dismissing the cases\n\nagainst Appellee. (CR-180, 1100; CR-182, 978; CR-183, 977; CR-191, 894). On\n\nAugust 2, 2013, the trial court issued detailed findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw. (CR-180-Supp-Aug02, 78-116).\n\n\n\n\n                                           39\n\fIX. Summary of the Arguments\n\n      Appellee will argue that to establish a prima facie case of selective\n\nprosecution in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and to obtain a\n\nhearing under the “presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness” method, a\n\ndefendant must provide “some evidence” that shows: (1) the government singled out\n\nthe defendant for prosecution and has not proceeded against others similarly situated\n\nbased on the type of conduct for which the defendant is charged; and (2) the\n\ngovernment’s discriminatory selection is invidious. Once the defendant makes this\n\nshowing, the burden shifts to the State to justify the discriminatory treatment.\n\n      Appellee will ask this Court to clarify what constitutes “some evidence” and\n\nhold that so long as a defendant attaches a proffer of evidence to a motion to dismiss\n\ndue to prosecutorial misconduct, the trial court in its discretion determines to present\n\na colorable claim of a constitutional violation, the defendant has attached “some\n\nevidence,” and the trial court should have the discretion to conduct a hearing on the\n\nmotion to dismiss.\n\n      Appellee will also ask this Court to find that Appellee not only attached “some\n\nevidence” showing a constitutional violation, but in fact attached “exceptionally\n\nclear evidence.”\n\n      Finally, Appellee will ask this Court to find that the Court of Appeals erred\n\nwhen it: (1) sustained the State’s second issue and concluded that Appellee “did not\n\n\n                                          40\n\fmake the proper showing sufficient to establish a prima facie case...” of the fact that\n\nthe former elected district attorney of Dallas County engaged in prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct by allowing himself to be corruptly influenced by a political ally in\n\nreturn for indicting Appellee; (2) found that the trial court erred in conducting a\n\nhearing on Appellee’s motion to dismiss based upon prosecutorial misconduct; (3)\n\nvacated the trial court’s Order Granting Motion to Dismiss; and (4) remanded the\n\ncase to the trial court to reinstate the indictments against Appellee.\n\n      As a result, Appellee will ask this Court to reverse the judgment and opinion\n\nof the Court of Appeals, find that Appellee provided “some evidence” constituting\n\na colorable claim that allowed the trial court to exercise its discretion to order a\n\nhearing, and affirm the trial court’s Order Granting Motion to Dismiss.\n\n\n\n\n                                          41\n\fX. Argument\n\n   1. Issue One: To establish a prima facie case of selective prosecution in\n      violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and to obtain a\n      hearing under the “presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness” method,\n      a defendant must provide “some evidence” that shows: (1) the\n      government singled out the defendant for prosecution and has not\n      proceeded against others similarly situated based on the type of conduct\n      for which the defendant is charged; and (2) the government’s\n      discriminatory selection is invidious. Once the defendant makes this\n      showing, the burden shifts to the State to justify the discriminatory\n      treatment.\n      Appellee asks this Court to clarify what constitutes “some evidence” and\n      hold that so long as a defendant attaches a proffer of evidence to a motion\n      to dismiss due to prosecutorial misconduct, the trial court in its discretion\n      determines to present a colorable claim of a constitutional violation, the\n      defendant has attached “some evidence,” and the trial court should have\n      the discretion to conduct a hearing on the motion to dismiss. Appellee\n      also asks this Court to find that Appellee not only attached “some\n      evidence” showing a constitutional violation, but in fact attached\n      “exceptionally clear evidence.”\n      Finally, Appellee asks this Court to find that the Court of Appeals erred\n      when it: (1) sustained the State’s second issue and concluded that\n      Appellee “did not make the proper showing sufficient to establish a prima\n      facie case...” of the fact that the former elected district attorney of Dallas\n      County engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by allowing himself to be\n      corruptly influenced by a political ally in return for indicting Appellee;\n      (2) found that the trial court erred in conducting a hearing on Appellee’s\n      motion to dismiss based upon prosecutorial misconduct; (3) vacated the\n      trial court’s Order Granting Motion to Dismiss; and (4) remanded the case\n      to the trial court to reinstate the indictments against Appellee.\n\n         i. Introduction – so long as the prosecution is not for an improper\n            purpose, prosecutors have the discretion to prosecute\n      In the American criminal justice system, “so long as the prosecutor has\n\nprobable cause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by statute,\n\nthe decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\n                                        42\n\fgrand jury, generally rests entirely in his discretion.” Bordenkircher v.

As the Supreme\n\nCourt observed in Berger, a prosecutor is:\n\n      “...the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a\n      sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as\n      its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a\n      criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall\n      be done... [H]e may prosecute with earnestness and vigor...[B]ut, while\n      he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as\n      much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce\n      a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring\n      about a just one.”\n\n      The Supreme Court has also made it clear that a prosecutor cannot hide behind\n\nthe cloak of “prosecutorial discretion” as Watkins attempted to do and avoid judicial\n\nscrutiny if the prosecutor’s decision to prosecute was motivated by\n\nimproper reasons.

Hopkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 373-374\n\n(1886), the Supreme Court of the United States held that the selective prosecution of\n\nChinese laundry owners violated equal protection because similarly situated non-\n\nChinese laundry owners were not arrested or prosecuted. In Yick Wo, although the\n\nChinese laundry owners complied with regulations pertaining to laundries, San\n\nFrancisco passed an ordinance that prohibited the operation of a laundry in a wooden\n\nbuilding without a permit. Id. at 358-361. At the time, nearly all of the existing 320\n\nlaundries operated in wooden buildings. Id. Out of about 200 applications filed by\n\nChinese owners for the permit, only one was granted, while the city granted 79 out\n\nof the 80 applications filed by non-Chinese owners. Id. Although 240 of the\n\nlaundries were Chinese-owned and 80 were owned by non-Chinese, the prosecutor\n\ncharged over 150 Chinese laundry owners for violating the regulations, but did not\n\ncharge or prosecute a single non-Chinese laundry owner because all but one were\n\ngranted permits. Id. at 360-364.\n\n      Yick Wo specifically addressed issues of racial discrimination in selective\n\nprosecution cases. Yick Wo was handed down before the dubious opinion in Plessy\n\nv. Ferguson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94508\"><a href=\"/opinion/94508/plessy-v-ferguson/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1896), which upheld the constitutionality of state laws\n\n\n                                         45\n\frequiring racial segregation in public facilities under the “separate-but-equal”\n\ndoctrine. Plessy was not repudiated by the Court until its decision in Brown v. Board\n\nof Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1954). But the fundamental holding in Yick Wo is clear:\n\nregardless of whether a law appears to be valid on its face, if it is prosecuted in an\n\nimproper manner, a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment occurs. As Justice Matthews wrote,\n\n      “Though the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in appearance,\n      yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye\n      and an unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal\n      discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to\n      their rights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of\n      the Constitution.”\n\nId. at 373-374. In the case before this Court, the circumstances in Yick Wo are in\n\nprinciple replayed: Texas Penal Code § 32.32, False Statement to Obtain Credit,\n\ncertainly appears to be “fair on its face and impartial in appearance.” When it was\n\n“applied and administered” (used to prosecute Appellee), however, by a “public\n\nauthority” (Watkins) who does so “with an evil eye and an unequal hand” (because\n\nhe was improperly influenced by Blue), “so as practically to make unjust and illegal\n\ndiscriminations between persons in similar circumstances,” [the State admitted that\n\nthe home-equity loan was never in arrears, had been fully repaid before the\n\ncommencement of any criminal investigation, and thus the indictments against\n\nAppellee are “unprecedented” (RR4, 49, 126, 129, 155)]..., “the denial of equal\n\n\n\n                                          46\n\fjustice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution” (Appellee was selectively\n\nprosecuted by Watkins for an improper and illegal purpose).\n\n      Stated under present-day laws and standards, under the Equal Protection and\n\nDue Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, to establish a prima\n\nfacie case of selective prosecution and to obtain a hearing under the “presumption\n\nof prosecutorial vindictiveness” method, a defendant must provide “some evidence”\n\nthat shows: (1) the government singled out the defendant for prosecution and has not\n\nproceeded against others similarly situated based on the type of conduct for\n\nwhich the defendant is charged; and (2) the government’s discriminatory selection\n\nis invidious. Once the defendant makes this showing, the burden shifts to the State\n\nto justify the discriminatory treatment.\n\n      Appellant will show that “some evidence” means evidence that constitutes a\n\ncolorable claim of a constitutional violation that may prove the elements of a\n\npresumed selective prosecution claim, and not evidence that proves the\n\nconstitutional violation: (1) beyond a reasonable doubt, (2) by clear and convincing\n\nevidence, or (3) by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n      As a result, Appellee asks this Court to clarify what constitutes “some\n\nevidence.” Appellee also asks this Court to find that so long as a defendant attaches\n\na proffer of evidence to a motion to dismiss due to prosecutorial misconduct that the\n\ntrial court in its discretion determines to present a colorable claim of a constitutional\n\n\n                                           47\n\fviolation, the defendant has attached “some evidence,” and a trial court has the\n\ndiscretion to conduct a hearing on the motion to dismiss.\n\n      Appellee met the burden set forth by the Supreme Court because he proffered\n\nwith the Motion to Dismiss not just “some evidence,” but rather “exceptionally clear\n\nevidence” proving that Watkins: (1) singled Appellee out for prosecution and did\n\nnot proceed against others similarly situated based on the type of conduct for\n\nwhich Appellee was charged; and (2) acted in an invidious manner.

Therefore,\n\nAppellee was entitled to an evidentiary hearing.\n\n      Yet, in a 2-1 decision, the Court of Appeals ruled that Appellee should have\n\nnever received a hearing in the first place. If the evidence Appellee attached to his\n\nMotion to Dismiss as a proffer does not constitute “some evidence” that establishes\n\na prima facie case of selective prosecution, then absent an admission by a prosecutor\n\nthat he or she: (1) singled a defendant out for prosecution and did not proceed against\n\nothers similarly situated based on the type of conduct for which the defendant was\n\ncharged; and (2) acted in an invidious manner, there is no circumstance that could\n\nallow a defendant to obtain a hearing on a selective prosecution claim based upon a\n\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\fclaim of “presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness” that the State must rebut or\n\nface dismissal of the charges (such as was alleged in Appellee’s case).\n\n\n         ii.

The burden then shifts to\n             the State to rebut this presumption or face dismissal of the charges\n\n      A constitutional claim of prosecutorial vindictiveness or selective prosecution\n\nmay be established in two ways: (1) by presenting evidence of circumstances that\n\npose a “realistic likelihood” of misconduct that is sufficient to raise a “presumption\n\nof prosecutorial vindictiveness,” which the State must rebut or face dismissal of the\n\ncharges (as alleged in Appellee’s case); or (2) by presenting proof of “actual\n\nvindictiveness,” which means providing direct evidence that the prosecutor’s\n\ncharging decision is an unjustifiable penalty resulting solely from the defendant’s\n\nexercise of a protected legal right.

As explained by\n\nthe majority, the exhibits include: (1) Hill Jr.’s February 2010 complaint to the\n\nDallas District Attorney’s office, (2) pleadings from other proceedings, excerpts\n\nfrom Watkins’s campaign finance reports, (3) email exchanges among attorneys\n\ncounsel in the litigation between Blue and Appellee, (4) Blue’s telephone records,\n\n(5) a log of text messages between Blue, Watkins, and his assistant, (6)\n\nannouncements about the SMU scholarship funded by Blue and about Watkins’s\n\nhiring of Blue to help in unrelated litigation, (7) a printout of a 2007 Texas\n\nLawyer article about the district attorney’s office’s grand jury policy, (8) Smith’s\n\nemail about her reassignment, (9) excerpts from transcripts in the litigation between\n\nBlue and Appellee, (10) deposition testimony from Blue in the litigation between\n\nBlue and Appellee in which Blue testified to receiving two phone calls from Watkins\n\nabout the indictments of the Appellee and his wife, and (11) deposition testimony\n\nfrom Blue’s co-counsel in the litigation between Blue and Appellee, Malouf, who\n\ntestified to overhearing one of those conversations. Hill, id. at *8-9; see CR-180,\n\n68-488.\n\n      The majority characterizes this evidence as insufficient and not\n\n“exceptionally clear evidence” or even “some evidence” that shows: (1) Watkins\n\n\n                                         52\n\fsingled out Appellee for prosecution and has not proceeded against others similarly\n\nsituated based on the type of conduct for which Appellee is charged; and\n\n(2) Watkins’s discriminatory selection is invidious.

Proffered evidence generally is evidence that is offered\n\nto a court so that the court can make a ruling on its admissibility. Black’s Law\n\nDictionary, 579 (7th ed. 1999). In Texas, when a party proffers evidence, a trial\n\ncourt’s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is reviewed under an abuse of\n                                            54\n\fdiscretion standard.

Thus, a reviewing court does not simply\n\nsubstitute its own decision for that of the trial court. Id.\n\n      A “proffer of evidence” in the context of a selective prosecution claim that\n\nallows a trial court in its discretion to order a hearing on the claim should be no\n\ndifferent than the procedure to obtain a hearing under Franks v. Delaware, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978), where a defendant contests the truthfulness of an affidavit supporting a\n\nsearch warrant. There are two significant similarities between claims of selective\n\nprosecution and those made under Franks. First, just like there is a “presumption of\n\nregularity” that courts presume prosecutors have “properly discharged their official\n\nduties,” which means that it is presumed that prosecutors do not pursue indictments\n\nin exchange for allowing themselves to be corruptly influenced (as Watkins did), see\n\nArmstrong, 517 U.S. at 464, there is also a presumption of truthfulness or validity to\n\nan affidavit supporting a search warrant. Franks, 438 U.S. at 171; see also Cates v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1587449\"><a href=\"/opinion/1587449/cates-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 355 (Tex.

State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2278381\"><a href=\"/opinion/2278381/hinojosa-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247\n\n(Tex.

See Harris v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1753780\"><a href=\"/opinion/1753780/harris-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 85 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). If these three conditions are met, and the contents\n\nof the affidavit that are not challenged are insufficient to support a finding of\n\nprobable cause, the defendant is entitled to a hearing on the issue of the truthfulness\n\nof the affidavit. Harris, 227 S.W.3d at 85.\n\n      In order to obtain a Franks hearing, a defendant need not include a sworn\n\naffidavit to make the preliminary showing. Ramsey v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1567406\"><a href=\"/opinion/1567406/ramsey-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 923\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1979); Cates, 120 S.W.3d at 359 (same). In Ramsey, this Court\n\nnoted that in Franks, no affidavit or other written material was offered, but only a\n\nstatement by the defense attorney as to what would be shown if he were allowed to\n\n\n                                          56\n\fcall witnesses on the issue. Ramsey, 579 S.W.2d at 923 (emphasis added). Such a\n\npreliminary showing was sufficient to justify a hearing. Id.\n\n      Thus, if merely alleging a deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the\n\ntruth, accompanied by an offer of proof, enables a defendant to a Franks hearing in\n\norder to prove a constitutional violation, a trial court should be within its discretion\n\nto order a hearing on a claim of prosecutorial misconduct to determine whether the\n\ndefendant was selectively prosecuted if the defendant attaches “some evidence” as\n\na proffer to the motion to dismiss that the trial court in its discretion determines to\n\npresent a colorable claim of a constitutional violation.         There should be no\n\nrequirement that affidavits or sworn statements be attached to a motion to dismiss\n\n(as the majority of the Court of Appeals implies).\n\n      Thus, in their ruling, the majority justices carved out an unprecedented rule in\n\nwhich, absent an admission by a prosecutor that he or she: (1) singled a defendant\n\nout for prosecution and did not proceed against others similarly situated based on\n\nthe type of conduct for which the defendant was charged; and (2) acted in an\n\ninvidious manner, there is no circumstance that would allow a trial court the\n\ndiscretion to grant a hearing on a motion alleging a selective prosecution claim under\n\nthe “presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness” method. The majority’s opinion\n\nthus eliminates a defendant’s ability to present evidence of circumstances that pose\n\na “realistic likelihood” of misconduct that is sufficient to raise a “presumption of\n\n\n                                          57\n\fprosecutorial vindictiveness,” which the State must rebut or face dismissal of the\n\ncharges (as alleged in Appellee’s case), and leaves a defendant who may be\n\nvictimized as Appellee was by Watkins only the ability to prove “actual\n\nvindictiveness,” which means providing direct evidence that the prosecutor’s\n\ncharging decision is an unjustifiable penalty resulting solely from the defendant’s\n\nexercise of a protected legal right. See Neal, 150 S.W.3d at 173 and Goodwin, 457\n\nU.S. at 380-381. This should not stand not only for public policy reasons, but as\n\nAppellee will explain below, such a standard is nearly impossible to meet because\n\nevidence of prosecutorial misconduct is often solely in the prosecutor’s possession.\n\n\n          iv. “Some evidence” means that a defendant must attach to the motion\n              to dismiss evidence that establishes that the defendant has a\n              colorable claim of a constitutional violation. This allows the trial\n              court to exercise its discretion in ordering the hearing. Once a\n              hearing is held, the defendant must show by “exceptionally clear\n              evidence” that the prosecution was initiated for an improper\n              reason.\n      Even if this Court takes the position that the proffer of evidence with a motion\n\nto dismiss may be similar to a proffer under Franks, there still remains the issue of\n\nwhat constitutes “some evidence.” The Supreme Court in Armstrong provides some\n\nguidance, but falls short of clearly defining “some evidence.” To understand the\n\nbasis of Armstrong, Appellee begins with a brief analysis of the proceedings in the\n\ncourt of appeals. The court of appeals held that a trial court is within its discretion\n\nto allow a hearing for discovery if a defendant presents evidence providing a\n\n                                          58\n\fcolorable basis of selective prosecution.

Here, the defendant and several others were indicted for\n\ndistribution of the cocaine-based drug known as “crack.” Id. at 1510-1511. The\n\ndefendants were all black. Id. They filed a motion to dismiss the indictments for\n\nselective prosecution, alleging that due to their race, the prosecutor filed federal\n\ncharges rather than state charges. Id. In support, the defendants presented a study\n\nthat shows that in all 24 cases handled by a local public defender’s office that\n\ninvolved violations of the indicted offense, the defendants were black. Id. The\n\ngovernment provided no explanation or rebuttal evidence. Id. at 1511. The trial\n\ncourt granted the defendants’ motion for discovery. Id.\n\n      Rather than comply with the discovery order, the government filed a motion\n\nfor reconsideration and presented a list of all defendants charged with the subject\n\noffense over a three-year period but without any racial breakdown, and declarations\n\nby three law enforcement officers and two Assistant United States Attorneys that\n\nprovided four explanations for the study's implication that the overwhelming bulk of\n\nfederal prosecutions for cocaine-base offenses targeted black defendants. Id. The\n\ndeclarations: (1) asserted that socio-economic factors led certain ethnic and racial\n\ngroups to be particularly involved with the distribution of crack and that blacks were\n\nparticularly involved in the crack trade; (2) asserted that during the three-year period,\n\na total of eleven defendants who are not black but were members of racial or ethnic\n\n\n                                           59\n\fminority groups were prosecuted for crack; (3) asserted that many blacks had been\n\ntried in state court for cocaine-base offenses; (4) contained a description of some of\n\nthe general factors on which federal prosecutors based their charging decisions for\n\ncrack-related offenses; and (5) asserted other unidentified “race-neutral” criteria. Id.\n\n      In response, the defendants submitted an article and two affidavits from\n\ndefense attorneys that showed that: (1) an equal number of white people and\n\nminorities use and deal crack; (2) many nonblacks are prosecuted in state court for\n\ncrack offenses; and (3) the federal penalty for crack offenses is higher than the\n\npenalty for powder cocaine offenses, and that most federal prosecutions for crack\n\noffenses involve black defendants. Id. at 1511-1512. The trial court denied the\n\ngovernment's motion for reconsideration, and after the government failed to comply\n\nwith the discovery order, the trial court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss\n\nthe indictments. Id. at 1512.\n\n      The court of appeals held that the “colorable” basis standard is the proper one\n\nfor deciding whether a trial court has the discretion to allow a hearing for the\n\npurposes of discovery on a motion to dismiss because: (1) if a defendant could\n\nestablish a prima facie case, the defendant would not need discovery in the first\n\nplace; (2) the “colorable” basis standard is consistent with the approach adopted by\n\nthe majority of the other circuits courts (more on this below); (3) the “colorable”\n\nbasis standard ensures that the government will not be called to answer for charging\n\n\n                                          60\n\fdecisions as a result of frivolous and unwarranted allegations; and (4) the “colorable”\n\nbasis standard ensures that defendants will not face unjustified hurdles at the\n\ndiscovery stage that will preclude them from demonstrating the existence of actual\n\ndiscrimination in the selection of defendants for criminal prosecution. Id. at 1515.\n\nThus, to be entitled to a hearing at the trial court’s discretion, under the “colorable”\n\nbasis standard, a defendant must present “some evidence” tending to show disparate\n\ntreatment and discriminatory intent that entails a non-frivolous showing based on\n\nmore than conclusory allegations. Id. at 1512. The government then has the\n\nopportunity to rebut the defendant's showing. Finally, the trial court evaluates the\n\nevidence and determines whether a colorable basis of selective prosecution still\n\nexists. Id. By applying these standards, the court of appeals in Armstrong held that\n\nthe defendants made a colorable showing of selective prosecution. Id. at 1514-1515.\n\n      Thus, “some evidence” means evidence that demonstrates the defendant can\n\nmake a colorable claim showing the existence of the discriminatory effect element,\n\nwhich would allow a trial court in its discretion to order a hearing.

App. El Paso 2005).\n\nAlthough on certiorari the Supreme Court did not clearly define what constitutes\n\n“some evidence,” and criticized the ruling of the court of appeals that held that a\n\ndefendant may establish a colorable basis for discriminatory effect without evidence\n\nthat the Government has failed to prosecute others who are similarly situated to the\n\n\n                                          61\n\fdefendant, the Court did not disturb the language “colorable basis for discriminatory\n\neffect.”\n\n      It is clear that the Supreme Court’s definition of “some evidence” means\n\nevidence that provides a colorable basis to show that the defendant can prove the\n\ntwo elements of a selective prosecution claim, which are: (1) the government singled\n\nout the defendant for prosecution and has not proceeded against others similarly\n\nsituated based on the type of conduct for which the defendant is charged; and (2) the\n\ngovernment’s discriminatory selection is invidious and not for a proper purpose.\n\n      The “some evidence” requirement does not mean that for a trial court to be\n\nwithin its discretion to order a hearing, a defendant must prove the selective\n\nprosecution claim beyond a reasonable doubt, by clear and convincing evidence, or\n\neven by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n       “Some evidence” means that a defendant must attach to the motion to dismiss\n\nevidence that establishes that the defendant has a colorable claim of a constitutional\n\nviolation. This allows the trial court to exercise its discretion in ordering the hearing.\n\nOnce a hearing is held, the defendant must show by “exceptionally clear evidence”\n\nthat the prosecution was initiated for an improper reason.

Crim. App.\n\n1979) (same).\n\n      A “colorable claim” is one that is “plausible, credible, or conceivable.”\n\nConcise Oxford American Thesaurus, 149 (2006). Or, it is a claim that is “legitimate\n\nand that may reasonably be asserted, given the facts presented and the current law.”\n\nBlack’s Law Dictionary, 240 (7th ed. 1999). “Exceptionally clear evidence” is\n\nevidence that is “unusually obvious, plain, evident, and intelligible.” Concise\n\nOxford American Thesaurus, 138, 292 (2006).\n\n      Appellee made a “colorable claim” of a constitutional violation. The Motion\n\nto Dismiss and its attachments detail how Blue, who at the time was engaged in a\n\nfee dispute with Appellee, corruptly influenced Watkins, a close friend and fellow\n\nDemocratic party operative, to authorize indictments against Appellee in exchange\n\nfor a promise of and actual receipt of “campaign” contributions for a nonexistent\n\n\n                                        63\n\f“campaign.” The State admitted that the indictments were “unprecedented.” (RR4,\n\n49, 126, 129, 155; CR-180, 31-488). And, the indictments clearly benefitted Blue,\n\nas Appellee was forced to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege and did not testify\n\non his own behalf during the fee dispute trial because of the pending criminal\n\nindictments.\n\n      And, Appellee not only proffered “some evidence” with the Motion to Dismiss\n\nthat would establish a “colorable claim,” enabling the trial court to exercise its\n\ndiscretion and order a hearing under the proposed standard. Appellee in fact\n\nproffered “exceptionally clear evidence.” On its face, the proffered evidence makes\n\nit “obvious, plain, and evident” that Watkins pursued the indictments in exchange\n\nfor allowing himself to be corruptly influenced by Blue. The evidence includes the\n\nfollowing (See CR-180, 36-52):\n\n    The case against Appellee was referred to the District Attorney’s Office by\n     the attorney for Hill Jr., who is an adverse party to Appellee in a federal\n     lawsuit.\n\n    On February 18, 2010, the judge in the federal lawsuit entered an order finding\n     that Hill Jr.: (1) submitted summary judgment materials in bad faith and with\n     the intent of committing fraud on the Court, and (2) lied under oath. The\n     district court also found that Hill Jr.’s attorney had “far exceeded the bounds\n     of advocacy, permissible or otherwise.”\n\n    Four days later, Hill Jr.’s father submitted a letter to the district attorney’s\n     office in which he accused Appellee and his wife of mortgage fraud.\n\n    A few months later, the law firm partner of Hill Jr.’s attorney donated nearly\n     $50,000 to the reelection campaign of Watkins even though no member of\n     that firm had previously contributed to Watkins’s campaigns. The\n                                         64\n\f   contributions immediately made the partner one of Watkins’s largest\n   individual contributors.\n\n The mortgage fraud allegations were dubious at best. The home equity loan\n  obtained by Appellee was never in default, was repaid in full just a few months\n  after it was obtained (long before Watkins considered criminal charges against\n  Appellee), and was fully secured at all times by Appellee’s undisputed equity\n  in the subject home.\n\n OmniAmerican did not suffer any loss, was never at risk of suffering any loss,\n  and never complained to authorities that Appellee did anything wrong or\n  committed any crime.\n\n Prior to indicting Appellee, the District Attorney’s Office did not interview\n  key witnesses such as the loan officer or the mortgage broker.\n\n Despite the policy of the District Attorney’s Office that defense attorneys\n  would be provided notice of grand jury proceedings and have an opportunity\n  to present their case to the grand jury, no such notice was given to Appellee\n  or his attorneys. This is in the face of the fact that Moore, who was a witness\n  during the motion to dismiss hearing, told Texas Lawyer that it was “all about\n  fairness... This is not a railroad we are running...this is a justice system.”\n\n Beginning in November 2009, Appellee was represented for about six months\n  in the federal litigation by a group of attorneys that included Blue. Blue\n  bragged to Appellee about her relationship with Watkins, and specifically told\n  Appellee about her personal friendship with Watkins, generous campaign\n  contributions she gave to Watkins, and pro bono representation of Watkins as\n  his personal lawyer.\n\n While representing Appellee, Blue even discussed ways she might use her\n  influence with Watkins to intimidate opposing counsel in the federal\n  litigation.\n\n Shortly after the federal litigation settled in May 2010, Blue and the two\n  attorneys with whom she represented Appellee demanded $50 million in\n  attorney’s fees for six months’ work. When Appellee refused, Blue and the\n  other attorneys withdrew from representing him and filed suit against\n  Appellee.\n\n                                     65\n\f Two weeks before this fee dispute trial was set to begin in federal court on\n  April 18, 2011, Appellee learned that he had been indicted. As a result of the\n  indictments, Appellee was advised to not take the stand during the fee dispute\n  trial.\n\n The federal court entered a judgment against Appellee and his wife for more\n  than $34 million, which was later reduced to $21.9 million, with Blue\n  personally standing to receive one-third of the judgment, or about\n  $7.3 million.\n\n Appellee then obtained discovery from Blue regarding her communications\n  with the District Attorney’s Office. During a deposition, Blue admitted that\n  Watkins had called her before the indictments were returned to discuss\n  potential charges against Appellee. Blue stated that Watkins told her that\n  “there could be an indictment or are you still interested in the indictments,” or\n  words to that effect.\n\n Through that discovery, a dramatic spike in communications between Blue\n  and Watkins was revealed, which occurred in the weeks and days before the\n  indictments were obtained. These communications included calls between\n  Blue and both Watkins’s office and cellphone numbers.\n\n Campaign finance records reflect that, on March 9, 2011, which was about\n  three weeks before the indictments were presented, the Watkins campaign\n  accepted a $5,000 donation from Blue. This was despite the fact that\n  Watkins’s “reelection campaign” had ended months earlier (Watkins had been\n  reelected in November 2010).\n\n Blue solicited others who donated thousands more to Watkins around the\n  same time.\n\n On March 30, 2011, the day before indictments against Appellee were\n  presented to the grand jury, Blue and Watkins communicated seven times via\n  Watkins’s cellphone number.\n\n About 18 months after Appellee was indicted, on October 12, 2012,\n  Appellee’s counsel met with assistant district attorney Deborah Smith, who\n  took over the cases against Appellee long after the indictment. Smith\n\n                                      66\n\f      described a “reevaluation” of the cases, and said that she had already\n      determined that she would recommend dismissing certain charges against\n      both Appellee and his wife (who had also been indicted). Smith also told\n      Appellee’s counsel that she was conducting “due diligence” interviews of\n      witnesses regarding the remaining charges, and would eventually make a\n      recommendation regarding those charges as well.\n\n    Smith expressed significant concerns about the cases against Appellee and his\n     wife, made clear that she (Smith) had no role in obtaining the indictments,\n     further stated that the interviews of witnesses she was conducting should have\n     been conducted much earlier. Smith also stated that she would refuse to try\n     the case if her office decided to go forward on any of the charges. Smith\n     conveyed several reasons why the charges against Appellee were without\n     merit. Smith requested that certain information be put in a written submission\n     for her to use in connection with her recommendations.\n\n    Smith “apologized” on behalf of the District Attorney’s Office.\n\n    On October 19, 2012, Appellee’s counsel emailed the written submission to\n     Smith.\n\n    Shortly after the meeting with Smith, the District Attorney’s Office filed a\n     motion to dismiss all charges against Appellee’s wife.\n\n    On October 22, 2012, in response to the email from Appellee’s counsel, Smith\n     stated that even though she was in the middle of a “reevaluation” of the cases\n     against Appellee and his wife (which had already caused Smith to recommend\n     and obtain dismissals against Appellee’s wife), Smith had been removed from\n     the Hill case effective the previous Friday and was reassigned to the animal\n     cruelty unit.\n\n          v. No appellate court in Texas has ever ruled that a trial court erred\n             in conducting a hearing on a defendant’s motion to dismiss charges\n             on the basis they violated his constitutional rights.\n      The dissent is correct in concluding that no appellate court in Texas has ever\n\nruled that a trial court erred in conducting a hearing on a defendant’s motion to\n\ndismiss charges on the basis they violated his constitutional rights.

As the Supreme Court explained in\n\nBrady, disclosure of exculpatory evidence is necessary to: (1) (avoid) “an unfair trial\n\nto the accused”; and (2) “[S]ociety wins not only when the guilty are convicted but\n\nwhen criminal trials are fair; our system of the administration of justice suffers when\n\nany accused is treated unfairly.” Id. at 87.\n\n      However, evidence of selective prosecution is nearly impossible for a\n\ndefendant to obtain through Article 39.14 or Brady because the evidence more than\n\nlikely is in the hands of the prosecutor who is committing the misfeasance. See\n\nWayte v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111375\"><a href=\"/opinion/111375/wayte-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 624 (1985) (Marshall, J., dissenting).          As\n\nJustice Marshall noted, “[The] need to develop all relevant facts in the adversary\n\nsystem is both fundamental and comprehensive. The ends of criminal justice would\n\nbe defeated if judgments were to be founded on a partial or speculative presentation\n\n\n                                           69\n\fof the facts.” Id. Justice Marshall also recognized that “...most of the relevant proof\n\nin selective prosecution cases will normally be in the Government's hands.”\n\n      And, because of the seriousness of allegations of selective prosecution,\n\nespecially given that a prosecutor behaving as Watkins did is an affront to the justice\n\nsystem, procedural rules such as limitations of discovery in criminal case should\n\nnever deprive a defendant of the evidence he needs to substantiate a claim of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct. Unfortunately, it is highly unlikely that a prosecutor\n\nwould ever voluntarily disclose evidence of selective prosecution that violates the\n\nConstitution. In fact, if a prosecutor actually made such a disclosure, this would be\n\nproof of “actual vindictiveness,” which is direct evidence of misconduct under\n\nGoodwin, 457 U.S. at 380-381. In such a situation, there would be no need for a trial\n\njudge to exercise her discretion to order an evidentiary hearing.\n\n       It is axiomatic that prosecuting a person because a political ally provided or\n\noffered a bribe undermines the integrity of the criminal justice system. Thus,\n\ndepriving a defendant of discovery and a hearing on a claim of prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct such as the one before this Court is as unjust as depriving a defendant of\n\nBrady evidence.\n\n      Because trial judges are gatekeepers of evidence, allowing them the discretion\n\nto conduct a hearing when a defendant makes a colorable claim of prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct will eliminate this potential for grave injustice. Such a holding issued\n\n\n                                          70\n\fby this Court will not only promote fairness in the criminal justice system, but it is\n\ngood public policy in Texas.\n\n\n         vii.      Most other courts have adopted standards substantially\n             similar to the standard that Appellee argues this Court should\n             adopt: that so long as a defendant attaches a proffer of evidence to\n             a motion to dismiss due to prosecutorial misconduct that the trial\n             court in its discretion determines to present a colorable claim of a\n             constitutional violation, the defendant has attached “some\n             evidence,” and the trial court should have the discretion to conduct\n             a hearing on the motion to dismiss.\n\n      First Circuit: In United States v.

Id. at 835-837 (emphasis added). In\n\nso affirming, the court of appeals held that a selective prosecution claim merits an\n\nevidentiary hearing if it alleges sufficient “facts (1) tending to show that [the\n\ndefendant] has been selectively prosecuted, and (2) raising a reasonable doubt about\n\nthe propriety of the prosecution’s purpose, unless the government can present\n\n‘countervailing reasons.’” Id. at 838.\n\n      Second Circuit: In United States v.

Mere assertions and generalized proffers on information and\n\nbelief are insufficient. Id. (emphasis added). As an example, the court of appeals\n\ncites United States v. Berrios, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"321152\"><a href=\"/opinion/321152/united-states-v-pablo-berrios/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1207</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1211 (2d Cir. 1974), in which the court\n\nof appeals held that a proffer of evidence stating that defendant and his attorney\n\n“believed” that “there were hundreds” of unprosecuted persons situated similarly to\n\ndefendant was insufficient for lack of identification of any unprosecuted violators or\n\naffiliated organizations. Id. at 58. Thus, absent a showing of “some evidence”\n\ntending to demonstrate the existence of prosecutorial misconduct, a district court is\n\nwell within its discretion to deny a motion for discovery and a hearing on a claim of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct.

This threshold showing requires the defendant to prove a “colorable\n\nentitlement” to the claim of selective prosecution. Id. at 570 (emphasis added). The\n\ncourt further explained that a “colorable entitlement” requires the defendant to\n\nprovide “some credible evidence...indicating that the government intentionally and\n\n\n                                         72\n\fpurposefully discriminated against the defendant by failing to prosecute other\n\nsimilarly situated persons.” Id.

Although Appellee disagrees\n\nwith the standard set forth by the Fifth and Eight Circuits, Appellee notes that the\n\nanalysis for his case does not change, as Appellee not only attached “some evidence”\n\nshowing a constitutional violation, but in fact attached “exceptionally clear\n\nevidence” that constitutes a prima facie case of prosecutorial misconduct. Still,\n\nAppellee asks this Court to not adopt this standard for Texas.\n\n\n\n\n                                         75\n\f         viii.     This Court should affirm the trial court’s order dismissing\n             the indictments because the evidence obtained during the March 7,\n             2013 hearing overwhelmingly proved that: (1) Watkins singled out\n             Appellee for prosecution and has not proceeded against others\n             similarly situated based on the type of conduct for which Appellee\n             was charged; and (2) Watkins’s discriminatory selection was\n             invidious and resulted from allowing himself to be improperly\n             influenced by Blue.\n      The evidence obtained during the March 7, 2013 hearing is set forth in great\n\ndetail over the span of 20 pages in section VIII above. Appellee will not recount\n\nthose facts here. However, this Court will find that the evidence obtained so\n\noverwhelmingly proved that: (1) Watkins singled out Appellee for prosecution and\n\nhas not proceeded against others similarly situated based on the type of conduct for\n\nwhich Appellee was charged; and (2) Watkins’s discriminatory selection was\n\ninvidious and resulted from allowing himself to be improperly influenced by Blue,\n\nthat this Court should affirm the trial court’s order dismissing the indictments.\n\n\n         ix. Conclusion\n\n      To establish a prima facie case of selective prosecution in violation of the\n\nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and to obtain a hearing under the “presumption\n\nof prosecutorial vindictiveness” method, a defendant must provide “some evidence”\n\nthat shows: (1) the government singled out the defendant for prosecution and has not\n\nproceeded against others similarly situated based on the type of conduct for\n\nwhich the defendant is charged; and (2) the government’s discriminatory selection\n\n\n                                          76\n\fis invidious. Once the defendant makes this showing, the burden shifts to the State\n\nto justify the discriminatory treatment.\n\n      Appellee has shown why this Court should clarify what constitutes “some\n\nevidence” and hold that so long as a defendant attaches a proffer of evidence to a\n\nmotion to dismiss due to prosecutorial misconduct, the trial court in its discretion\n\ndetermines to present a colorable claim of a constitutional violation, the defendant\n\nhas attached “some evidence,” and the trial court should have the discretion to\n\nconduct a hearing on the motion to dismiss. Appellee has also shown why this Court\n\nshould find that Appellee not only attached “some evidence” showing a\n\nconstitutional violation, but in fact attached “exceptionally clear evidence.”\n\n      Appellee has also shown this Court that the Court of Appeals erred when it:\n\n(1) sustained the State’s second issue and concluded that Appellee “did not make the\n\nproper showing sufficient to establish a prima facie case...” of the fact that the former\n\nelected district attorney of Dallas County engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by\n\nallowing himself to be corruptly influenced by a political ally in return for indicting\n\nAppellee; (2) found that the trial court erred in conducting a hearing on Appellee’s\n\nmotion to dismiss based upon prosecutorial misconduct; (3) vacated the trial court’s\n\nOrder Granting Motion to Dismiss; and (4) remanded the case to the trial court to\n\nreinstate the indictments against Appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                                           77\n\f      As a result, (1) the decision of the Court of Appeals conflicts with another\n\ncourt of appeals’ decision on the same issue; (2) the Court of Appeals has decided\n\nan important question of state or federal law that has not been, but should be, settled\n\nby the Court of Criminal Appeals; (3) the Court of Appeals has decided an important\n\nquestion of state or federal law in a way that conflicts with the applicable decisions\n\nof the Court of Criminal Appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States; (4) the\n\nCourt of Appeals misconstrued a rule; and (5) the justices of the Court of Appeals\n\nhave disagreed on a material question of law necessary to the court’s decision. See\n\nTex. Rule App. Proc. 66.3 (2015).\n\n\nXI. Conclusion and Prayer\n\n      For the reasons stated in this Brief, Appellee respectfully prays that this Court\n\nreverse the judgment and opinion of the Court of Appeals, find that Appellee\n\nprovided “some evidence” constituting a colorable claim that allowed the trial court\n\nto exercise its discretion to order a hearing, and affirm the trial court’s Order\n\nGranting Motion to Dismiss.\n\n                                        Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n                                          78\n\fGeorge R.

And while a trial judge may dismiss an indictment where\nconstitutional protections are not observed, the dismissal of an indictment is a drastic measure only to\nbe used in the most extraordinary circumstances. A trial judge’s limited authority to dismiss an\nindictment stems in part from the fact that the decision of whether to prosecute is a core executive\nconstitutional function. Because this power is within the province of the State, the State enjoys\nconsiderable discretion in deciding whether or not to prosecute and what charge to file or bring to the\ngrand jury. That means courts presume the State exercised its prosecutorial responsibilities in good\nfaith and in compliance with the Constitution. The burden on the defendant to show that a particular\nprosecutorial decision was predicated on constitutionally impermissible grounds is high, requiring him\nto prove his claim with clear evidence.\n\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Commencement of Criminal Proceedings > Counsel > Prosecutors\n  Evidence > ... > Presumptions > Particular Presumptions > Regularity\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Burdens of Proof\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Commencement of Criminal Proceedings > Counsel > Prosecutors\n  Evidence > ... > Presumptions > Particular Presumptions > Regularity\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Burdens of Proof\n\n                                                Page 2 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *1\n\n\n\nHN3 The significance of the presumption courts afford prosecutors carries over to a defendant’s\nrequest for an evidentiary hearing or discovery. That is, in light of the presumption of prosecutorial\nregularity, a defendant who claims his constitutional rights were violated by some form of\nprosecutorial misconduct must make out a prima facie case of his claims before he is entitled to an\nevidentiary hearing or discovery. To do this, a defendant must present facts sufficient to create a\nreasonable doubt about the constitutionality of his prosecution. The facts required to cast doubt about\nthe constitutionality of the prosecution and to rebut the presumption the State acted in good faith such\nthat a person is entitled to an evidentiary hearing (or even discovery) must be more than allegations.\nRather, a defendant’s factual allegations must be accompanied by evidence that tends to establish his\nconstitutional claims. Indeed, the standard for obtaining discovery on claims like selective or\nvindictive prosecution requires some evidence tending to show the existence of the essential elements\nof the claimed violations. This standard is rigorous and complements the rigorous standard for proving\nconstitutional violations in the decision to prosecute.\n\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Tests for Prosecutorial Misconduct\n  Constitutional Law > ... > Fundamental Rights > Procedural Due Process > Scope of Protection\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Tests for Prosecutorial Misconduct\n  Constitutional Law > ... > Fundamental Rights > Procedural Due Process > Scope of Protection\n\nHN4 The absence of an impartial and disinterested prosecutor can violate a defendant’s due process\nrights. Partiality in this context is like a conflict of interest in the sense that the prosecutor has a\npersonal interest or stake in the outcome of the criminal prosecution. It also refers to any interest that\nconflicts with the prosecutor’s duty to seek justice. Thus, the due process rights of a defendant are\nviolated when a prosecuting attorney who has a conflict of interest relevant to the defendant’s case\nprosecutes the defendant. The mere potential or perceived conflict of interest is not sufficient to\nestablish a due process violation. Similarly, mere allegations of wrongdoing do not suffice.\n\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Selective & Vindictive Prosecution\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Burdens of Proof\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Selective & Vindictive Prosecution\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Burdens of Proof\n\nHN5 ″Prosecutorial vindictiveness″ refers to a situation in which the State acts against a defendant by\nbringing criminal charges in retaliation for the defendant’s exercise of his legal rights. A prosecutorial\naction is vindictive if it is designed to penalize a defendant for invoking legally protected rights. A\ndefendant may demonstrate prosecutorial vindictiveness by showing actual vindictiveness, which\nrequires him to present objective evidence of the violation. Or, in certain circumstances, the defendant\nmay rely on a presumption of vindictiveness, which requires him to present facts showing the realistic\nlikelihood of vindictiveness, forcing the State to present objective evidence justifying the prosecutorial\naction. There is no presumption of vindictiveness if in the context of the entire proceedings any\nobjective event or combination of events in those proceedings should indicate to a reasonable minded\ndefendant that the prosecutor’s decision was motivated by some purpose other than a vindictive desire\nto deter or punish. Even if the defendant establishes a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness, the State\nstill has an opportunity to proffer legitimate, objective reasons for its conduct.\n\n                                                Page 3 of 29\n\f                                     2014 Tex.

A selective-prosecution claim draws on ordinary equal protection standards and\nrequires a defendant to prove the existence of purposeful discrimination. To make out a prima facie\ncase, the defendant must first show that he has been singled out for prosecution while others similarly\nsituated and committing the same acts have not been prosecuted. He must also show that the State’s\ndiscriminatory selection of him for prosecution was invidious or in bad faith.\n\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Burdens of Proof\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Selective & Vindictive Prosecution\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Burdens of Proof\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Appeals > Prosecutorial Misconduct > Selective & Vindictive Prosecution\n\nHN8 There is an evidentiary threshold that must be met by the defendant before he is entitled to an\nevidentiary hearing on his claims that he was prosecuted in violation of his constitutional rights. That\nburden requires a defendant to do more than make unsupported allegations or speculative inferences\nabout an improper motive. Stated another way, before a defendant gets to make inquiries into the\nState’s decision to prosecute, the defendant must support his allegations with evidence that tends to\nestablish his constitutional claims. A defendant may demonstrate prosecutorial vindictiveness by\nshowing actual vindictiveness, which requires him to present objective evidence of the violation. Or,\nin certain circumstances, the defendant may rely on a presumption of vindictiveness, which requires\nhim to present facts showing the realistic likelihood of vindictiveness, forcing the State to present\nobjective evidence justifying the prosecutorial action. There is no presumption of vindictiveness if in\nthe context of the entire proceedings any objective event or combination of events in those proceedings\nshould indicate to a reasonable minded defendant that the prosecutor’s decision was motivated by\nsome purpose other than a vindictive desire to deter or punish.\n\nCounsel: for appellants: Michael R.

Bridges, J.,\ndissenting.\n\nOpinion by: ADA BROWN\n\nOpinion\n\nOpinion by Justice Brown\n\nOn March 31, 2011, a Dallas grand jury returned multiple indictments against Albert G. Hill III and\nhis wife for the offenses of making a false statement to obtain property or credit and securing execution\nof a document by deception.1 The charges allegedly arose out of the Hills’ procurement of a $500,000\nhome-equity loan in 2009. The State later dismissed the charges against Hill’s wife and continued to\nprosecute the cases against Hill. In a motion filed shortly after the dismissal of his wife’s charges, Hill\nsought to quash and dismiss the indictments against him, alleging he was the victim of various forms\nof prosecutorial misconduct in violation of his constitutional rights. Alternatively, he asked for an\nevidentiary hearing and discovery to develop the issues presented in his motion. Over the State’s\nobjections, the trial judge determined that Hill met his initial burden of proof related to his\nconstitutional [*2] claims and therefore was entitled to a hearing ″to try to prove″ his allegations. After\nthe judge held a hearing, the judge signed an order dismissing the indictment in each case with\nprejudice.\n\nThe State appeals that order. In its first two issues, the State challenges the propriety of the evidentiary\nhearing, arguing that Hill was not entitled to such a hearing because he failed to provide evidence to\nestablish a constitutional violation. In its third and fourth issues, the State challenges the trial judge’s\n(1) dismissal of the indictments based on the Dallas County District Attorney’s refusal to testify at the\nhearing and (2) decision to dismiss the indictments with prejudice.\n\nWe agree with the State that the trial judge erred in conducting an evidentiary hearing on Hill’s motion\nto quash and dismiss the indictments because Hill did not make the necessary showing related to his\nconstitutional claims. Accordingly, we vacate the trial judge’s order dismissing the indictments in these\ncases and remand the cases to the trial court with instructions to reinstate the indictments against Hill.\n\nI.\n\nA. Hill’s Allegations of Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\nHill [*3] sought pretrial dismissal of the indictments based on alleged violations of his constitutional\nrights to due process and equal protection. He first alleged that his due process rights were violated\nbecause the Dallas County District Attorney, Craig Watkins, was not disinterested in the prosecution\nof him but rather was operating under the influence of Hill’s father, who was adverse to Hill in\ncontested litigation involving a multi-billion dollar family trust, and Lisa Baron Blue, a close friend\nand political patron of Watkins. Hill argued Watkins’s decision to present the cases to the grand jury\nwas influenced by the payment of political contributions. Hill also alleged that a due process violation\n1\n     See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. §§ 32.32(b), 32.46(a) (West 2011).\n\n                                                            Page 5 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *3\n\n\n\noccurred because Watkins’s decision to prosecute him was vindictive, asserting that the State brought\nthe charges in retaliation for Hill having exercised his right to petition the civil courts. His third\nallegation was that he was selectively prosecuted in violation of his equal protection rights.\nHill based his allegations of prosecutorial misconduct on a series of ″facts″ that he presented in his\nmotion. Hill stated that it was his father’s lawyer, Michael Lynn, who filed the complaint [*4] with the\nDA’s office accusing Hill and his wife of mortgage fraud. The complaint was submitted to the DA’s\noffice in February 2010, while the trust litigation was still pending and days after Hill’s father received\nan adverse ruling in that case. The next month, Watkins received a series of campaign donations from\nJeffrey Tillotson, a law partner at Lynn’s firm. Hill asserted that neither Tillotson nor anyone at that\nfirm had previously donated to Watkins’s campaigns. The donations totaled $48,500, with the last\ndonation made five months before the Hills were indicted.\nHill also asserted that the mortgage-fraud allegations were ″highly unusual″ because the home-equity\nloan was not in default and was repaid in full shortly after the loan was obtained. According to Hill,\nthe lender did not suffer a loss and had not complained about any wrongdoing. In addition, Hill claimed\nthe DA’s office did not conduct a standard investigation because it failed to interview certain\nwitnesses. Nor did the DA’s office notify him that indictments were being considered despite Hill’s\nclaim that the DA’s office had a policy of providing notice and giving the accused’s lawyers an\nopportunity to address the [*5] grand jury before charges are presented.\nHill further complained that the timing of the indictments was suspect. In particular, Hill claimed the\nindictments were returned two weeks before the Hills were to begin trial in a fee dispute with the\nlawyers that represented them in the trust litigation, one of whom was Blue. Hill explained that after\nthe trust litigation settled, the Hills contested the amount of attorneys’ fees sought by Blue and the\nother lawyers. The lawyers filed suit, maintaining the Hills owed over $50 million in attorneys’ fees.\nHill stated that because of the pending indictments, the Hills asserted their Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst self-incrimination and did not testify in the fee-dispute litigation.\nHill emphasized that Blue exchanged numerous phone calls and text messages with Watkins and his\nassistant in the weeks before the indictments were returned. Hill also pointed out that Blue donated\nmoney to Watkins’s campaign and held a social event at her home to raise money for the campaign\nduring that same time frame. Hill alleged that the pattern of phone calls and text messages between\nBlue and Watkins revealed a ″dramatic spike″ in communications in the weeks before the indictments\n [*6] were returned and that the ″heated exchange of calls″ between Blue and Watkins ended after the\nindictments were announced. Further, in a deposition conducted after the conclusion of the fee-dispute\ntrial, Hill claimed that Blue admitted that two of those phone calls from Watkins were about the\nindictments before the indictments were returned. Hill also claimed that during Blue’s representation\nof the Hills in the trust litigation, Blue ″bragged″ to him about her relationship with Watkins. Hill\nstressed that this was not ″idle bragging″ and that Blue has a ″very close personal, professional and\npolitical relationship″ with Watkins as represented by Blue’s status as one of Watkins’s largest\nindividual donors, Blue’s pro bono representation of Watkins in connection with an unrelated lawsuit,\nBlue’s $100,000 donation to SMU law school to create a scholarship in Watkins’s name, and the fact\nthat Watkins hired Blue and another attorney to represent Dallas County in a contingent-fee suit.\nHill finally claimed that the DA’s office ″apologized″ to the Hills on behalf of the DA’s office, and\nhe proclaimed that with the dismissal of the charges against his wife, the office ″effectively\n                                                 Page 6 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *6\n\n\n\nacknowledge[ed] the wrongfulness [*7] of those charges.″ According to Hill, the Hills’ defense\ncounsel met with Assistant District Attorney Deborah Smith in October 2012. Hill maintained that\nduring that meeting, Smith ″expressed significant concerns″ about the charges and ″stated that she\nwould refuse to try the case if the DA’s Office decided to go forward on any of the charges.″ Hill also\nmaintained that Smith said that based on her re-evaluation of the cases, she decided to recommend\ndismissing certain charges against the Hills and was conducting due-diligence interviews related to the\nremaining charges. Shortly after the meeting, Smith communicated that she was reassigned to another\ndivision. Hill called this ″remarkable news″ given that Smith was in the middle of her re-evaluation\nof the charges against the Hills.\nHill argued the circumstances presented by these ″facts″ constitute ″clear and appalling″ violations of\nhis constitutional rights and establish that the DA’s office served as a ″stalking horse″ for the interests\nof (1) Hill’s father, who Hill maintained reported the allegations of mortgage fraud in retaliation for\nhis ″exercise of his constitutional rights in the trust litigation″; (2) Lynn, who submitted [*8] the\nmortgage-fraud allegations to the DA’s office and whose law partner donated $48,500 to Watkins’s\ncampaign; and (3) Blue, Watkins’s friend and generous campaign contributor, who was seeking\nmillions of dollars in attorneys’ fees from the Hills at the time the indictments were returned. Hill\nmaintained that the charges ″had the desired effect″ by impairing the Hills’ ability ″to exercise their\nconstitutional rights to defend themselves″ in the fee-dispute litigation involving Blue.\n\nB. Hill’s Proffer of Evidence in Support of His Motion\nAs support, Hill attached forty-four exhibits to his motion, most of which were unauthenticated or not\notherwise identified by affidavit testimony. Those exhibits included what appeared to be a page from\nLynn’s February 2010 complaint, various pleadings, excerpts from Watkins’s campaign finance\nreports, e-mail exchanges among counsel in the trust litigation, Blue’s telephone records, a log of text\nmessages between Blue and Watkins and his assistant, announcements about the SMU scholarship\nfunded by Blue and about Watkins’s hiring of Blue to help in unrelated litigation, a printout of a 2007\nTexas Lawyer article about the office’s grand jury policy, and [*9] Smith’s e-mail about her\nreassignment. Hill also attached what appeared to be excerpts from (1) transcripts in the fee-dispute\nlitigation related to the Hills’ request for a continuance and their assertion of their Fifth Amendment\nprivilege and (2) deposition testimony from (a) Blue in the fee-dispute litigation in which she testified\nto receiving two phone calls from Watkins about the indictments of the Hills and (b) Blue’s co-counsel\nin the trust litigation, Stephen Malouf, who testified to overhearing one of those conversations.\n\nC. The State’s Response to Hill’s Motion\nThe State filed a brief opposing the motion to quash and dismiss the indictments. The State argued the\ntrial judge lacked the authority to grant Hill’s motion because Hill failed to prove any constitutional\nviolation. The State also emphasized that Hill’s prosecution was not ″the product of a favored and\ndiscontented campaign donor’s audience with the District Attorney.″ Rather, the State asserted that the\ninvestigation into the offense began with the letter from Lynn, was investigated by an experienced\nprosecutor, and the decision to pursue charges against Hill was not unusual or exceptional given that\nthe Specialized Crime Division [*10] of the DA’s office regularly prosecutes cases like Hill’s.\nThe State supported its opposition with various exhibits, including the affidavits of Assistant District\nAttorneys Donna Strittmatter and Stephanie Martin. Strittmatter testified that as the assigned\n\n                                                 Page 7 of 29\n\f                                                 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *10\n\n\n\nprosecutor within the Specialized Crime Division, she received Lynn’s February 2010 complaint and\nsupporting documents, alleging numerous fraudulent acts committed by Hill in connection with a loan\ntransaction. Strittmatter assigned the case to Martin to conduct an investigation. Martin testified that\nshe personally investigated the allegations against Hill and her investigation included receiving large\nvolumes of documents from the bank and title company. Martin also obtained deposition testimony of\nHill and others, and she spoke to legal counsel from the bank. Strittmatter confirmed that Martin\ninvestigated the case for several months and provided updates to her as Martin reviewed the evidence.\n\nMartin also testified that the Specialized Crime Division within the DA’s office regularly prosecutes\ncrimes similar to those alleged to have been committed by Hill. She explained that many of the\nindictments the division obtains for the [*11] same crime involve property or credit valued at $200,000\nor more. She said she personally prosecuted four mortgage-fraud cases involving circumstances where\nno loss was suffered.\n\nBoth Strittmatter and Martin testified that they did not have a practice of notifying a suspect that he\nis the target of a criminal investigation. Martin also stated that it was not her practice to provide a\nsuspect with an opportunity to be heard by the grand jury before indictment. Both also testified that\nthey were unaware of the fee-dispute litigation between Blue and the Hills.\n\nD. The Trial Judge Sets the Motion to Dismiss for a Hearing\n\nIn advance of the hearing on his motion, Hill served subpoenas on various individuals from the DA’s\noffice, including Watkins, Moore, Martin, and Strittmatter. He also served subpoenas on Blue, Malouf,\nand Charla Aldous, who was Blue’s other co-counsel representing the Hills in the trust litigation. The\nState responded with motions to quash the subpoenas, raising procedural objections and arguing,\namong other things, that Hill was not entitled to seek information from the individuals because Hill’s\nmotion to quash and dismiss the indictments was invalid. The State argued [*12] that Hill’s motion did\nnot allege (1) that Watkins placed Hill in an arbitrary classification in determining whether to indict\nhim, (2) any cognizable retaliation by Watkins, or (3) any alleged exercise of Hill’s legal rights. The\nState also stressed that Hill did not ″even allege a lack of objective basis to indict.″ The State\nmaintained that because these infirmities were fatal to Hill’s motion to quash and dismiss the\nindictments, the State could not be burdened to comply with Hill’s subpoenas.\n\nE. The Trial Judge Grants Hill an Evidentiary Hearing\n\nThe trial judge heard argument on Hill’s motion on February 14, 2013. Although the judge stated that\nshe did not ″understand how [Hill was] gonna get there″ based on the type of evidence Hill explained\nwould be ″elicit[ed]″ and would ″come out″ in the examinations of Watkins and Blue, she granted Hill\nthe ″right to have a hearing to try to prove to the Court that this case was handled differently from any\nother case″ that would come before the DA. The judge also determined that Hill presented prima facie\nevidence of his claims and that he had a ″right to make inquiries″ to ″make [his] case.″2\n2\n    At the time she made this determination, the judge had Hill’s [*13] motion plus the attachments to his motion, the State’s opposition\nto Hill’s motion, which included various attachments and the affidavits of Strittmatter and Martin, and Hill’s brief in reply. The judge\nalso had the various motions to quash the subpoenas served by Hill, Hill’s opposition to those motions, and an affidavit, dated February\n12, 2013, filed by Blue in support of her motion for protective order regarding the subpoena to appear at the hearing.\n\n                                                               Page 8 of 29\n\f                                                2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *13\n\n\n\nThe State asked the judge for time to appeal the ruling, arguing that Hill was not entitled to a hearing\nat this point because he failed to establish a prima facie case for his constitutional claims. The State\nfurther objected to the hearing on the basis that Hill was trying to develop evidence that he did not\nhave. The judge overruled the State’s objections. The State also sought mandamus relief from this\nCourt and a stay of the hearing from the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. In its mandamus petition,\nthe State complained, among other things, about the judge’s finding that Hill established a prima facie\ncase.\nThe trial judge conducted an evidentiary hearing related to Hill’s motion to quash and dismiss the\nindictments while the State’s [*14] requests for relief were pending. On March 7, 2013, the judge\nsigned the order dismissing the indictments with prejudice on the basis that Hill had been denied ″his\nright to a full and fair hearing on his motion″ due to Watkins’s refusal to testify at the hearing. We\nultimately dismissed the State’s petition for writ of mandamus as moot on April 2, 2013.3\n\nII.\n\nThe State’s first two issues relate to the trial judge’s decision to hold an evidentiary hearing. HN1\nWhile we ordinarily defer to a trial judge’s decision to hold an evidentiary hearing,4 that deference is\ntempered by the legal principles and standards governing evidentiary hearings as outlined below. See,\ne.g., United States v. Webster, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 334 (5th Cir. 1998) (defendant ″not automatically entitled\nto an evidentiary hearing to make the required showing″).\n\nHN2 Generally, a trial judge has only limited authority to dismiss a case without the State’s consent,\nsuch as to remedy a constitutional [*15] violation. State v. Mungia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2170980\"><a href=\"/opinion/2170980/state-v-mungia/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">814</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 816-17 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2003). And while a trial judge may dismiss an indictment where constitutional protections are not\nobserved, ″the dismissal of an indictment is ’a drastic measure only to be used in the most\nextraordinary circumstances.’″ Id. at 817 (quoting State v. Frye, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2435451\"><a href=\"/opinion/2435451/state-v-frye/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 330 (Tex. Crim. App.\n1995)).\nA trial judge’s limited authority to dismiss an indictment stems in part from the fact that the decision\nof whether to prosecute is a core executive constitutional function. United States v. Armstrong, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118022\"><a href=\"/opinion/118022/united-states-v-armstrong/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 464-65, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118022\"><a href=\"/opinion/118022/united-states-v-armstrong/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because this power is within the province\nof the State, the State enjoys considerable discretion in deciding whether or not to prosecute and what\ncharge to file or bring to the grand jury.

Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 468; see also\nIn re United States, 397 F.3d at 284 (prima facie case ″requires the criminal defendant to bring forward\nsome evidence″) (emphasis added). This standard is ″rigorous″ and complements the ″rigorous\nstandard″ for proving constitutional violations in the decision to prosecute. Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 468.\n\nIII.\nIn its first issue, the State complains about the documents Hill proffered with his motion. The State\nargues that Hill needed to present evidence to support his claims before he was entitled to an\nevidentiary hearing and, because Hill ″simply made unsworn allegations″ in his motion and ″attached\na stack of unauthenticated documents″ as exhibits, he basically provided no evidence to support his\nclaims. The State explains that, under Armstrong, the judge had to presume that Watkins acted in good\nfaith until Hill presented clear evidence to the contrary and the presentation of such evidence was a\ncondition that must be met before Hill was entitled to an evidentiary hearing. The State points out that\n\n                                               Page 10 of 29\n\f                                                 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *18\n\n\n\neven the trial judge advised Hill that the ″unauthenticated, [*19] un-introduced documents attached to\nhis motion″ were not evidence.5 Hill responds that the State did not preserve its complaint that Hill’s\nattachments to his motion suffered from authentication or hearsay problems because the State did not\nobject on those bases in the trial court. Hill also asserts the State stipulated to the authenticity and\nadmissibility of the evidence attached to the motion at the March 7 evidentiary hearing.\n\nWhile we are troubled by the unsworn allegations in and authenticity of the documents attached to\nHill’s motion,6 we need not resolve whether the State preserved its complaint about these documents7\nbecause regardless of the contentions the State raised in its first issue, we conclude Hill did not meet\nthe standard required to warrant an evidentiary hearing even when we consider the documents attached\nto Hill’s motion. Before Hill is entitled to an evidentiary hearing, he must make a prima facie showing\nfor his alleged constitutional claims with evidence capable of dispelling [*20] the presumption that the\nprosecution of him was in good faith and in compliance with the Constitution. See Armstrong, 517 U.S.\nat 465; In re United States, 397 F.3d at 284. Hill’s failure to do so means the trial judge erred in\ngranting Hill an evidentiary hearing, which resulted in the dismissal of the indictments. This is the\nState’s second issue.\n\nIV.\n\nThis case came to us with a large record. But in deciding the issue of whether Hill was entitled to an\nevidentiary hearing to try to prove his allegations, there is no need to look beyond what the trial judge\nhad in her hands at the time she decided that Hill met his initial burden of proof related to his\nconstitutional claims. In particular, we consider Hill’s motion and the attached exhibits to determine\nwhether he made a prima facie case for each of [*21] his claims such that he was entitled to an\nevidentiary hearing.\n\nIn his motion to quash and dismiss the indictments, Hill claimed he was deprived of his right to a\ndisinterested prosecutor and that he had been vindictively and selectively prosecuted. As proof of the\nalleged constitutional violations, Hill emphasized the following in his motion: (1) political contributions\nfrom a lawyer associated with Hill’s father in the months after the February 2010 complaint and five\nmonths before the indictments were returned and a donation by Blue less than a month before the\nindictments were returned; (2) that Blue hosted a fundraiser for Watkins in the month before the\nindictments were returned; (3) the ″unusual″ nature of the charges against him; (4) the lack of notice\nto him that indictments were being considered; (5) the suspect timing of the indictments in that they\nwere returned just before the fee-dispute trial involving Blue, which Hill claimed prevented him and\nhis wife from testifying in that trial; (6) the ″heated exchange″ of communications with Watkins and\nhis office in the weeks leading up to the Hills’ indictments and ending after the indictments were\nreturned; (7) Blue’s discussion [*22] about indictments with Watkins in the time before they were\n5\n    The judge’s statement was made at a hearing conducted on March 4, 2013. Specifically, the judge alerted Hill’s defense counsel that\nthe ″exhibits on [Hill’s] motions [were] not evidence.″\n6\n    In our view, the evidence accompanying a motion alleging prosecutorial misconduct must be competent evidence; the evidence must\nbe properly authenticated and in an otherwise admissible format. Affidavits or sworn or other reliable witness statements are appropriate\nto establish a fact.\n7\n    The State argues it had no reason to object before the commencement of the hearing because Hill had not yet offered the documents\nattached to his motion as evidence.\n\n                                                              Page 11 of 29\n\f                                                 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *22\n\n\n\nreturned; (8) Blue’s comment made in her deposition that she would have no reason to discuss\nindictments with Watkins after they were returned; (9) Blue’s close relationship with Watkins; (10)\ndefense counsel’s meeting with Smith about the charges; and (11) the fact that charges against Hill’s\nwife were dismissed. Hill contends on appeal that these facts cast doubt on the constitutionality of the\nprosecution and not only entitle him to an evidentiary hearing but also establish a prima facie showing\nof prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nA. Hill’s Allegation He Was Deprived of the Right to a Disinterested Prosecutor\n\nHill first alleged in his motion that the indictments should be dismissed because he was deprived of\nthe right to a disinterested prosecutor. HN4 The absence of an impartial and disinterested prosecutor\ncan violate a defendant’s due process rights. In re Guerra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1441377\"><a href=\"/opinion/1441377/in-re-guerra/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 429 (Tex. App.—Corpus\nChristi 2007, orig. proceeding). ″Partiality″ in this context is like ″a conflict of interest in the sense that\nthe prosecutor has a personal interest or stake in the outcome of the criminal prosecution.″ Id. at 430.\nIt also refers to any interest that conflicts with the prosecutor’s duty to seek justice. Id. Thus, the due\n [*23] process rights of a defendant are violated ″when a prosecuting attorney who has a conflict of\ninterest relevant to the defendant’s case prosecutes the defendant.″ Id. at 429. The ″mere potential or\nperceived conflict of interest″ is not sufficient to establish a due process violation. Id. at 430. Similarly,\nmere allegations of wrongdoing do not suffice. Id.\n\nHill alleged in his motion that the influence exercised upon Watkins by Hill’s father, Lynn, and Blue\ndeprived him of due process. He explained that Watkins had ″a financial stake in the prosecution of\nthe Hills″ because indicting them benefited Blue (who was involved in a dispute with the Hills over\nattorneys’ fees) and Tillotson (who also was a major campaign contributor), ″which in turn benefited″\nWatkins. Hill claimed Blue’s influence and involvement with the indictment process were demonstrated\nby Blue’s two telephone conversations with Watkins before the indictments were returned and the\npattern of phone calls and text messages exchanged between Blue and Watkins (and others in the DA’s\noffice) in the weeks before the indictments were returned.\n\nWe disagree with Hill’s assertion that his motion and attachments demonstrate that Watkins’s decision\n [*24] to prosecute Hill was influenced by any wrongdoing. The documents submitted with Hill’s\nmotion show that Blue represented Watkins on a pro bono matter and that she is friends with him and\nothers in the DA’s office. She testified in her deposition that she received a phone call from Watkins\n″shortly before the indictments came down.″ Her recollection of the phone call was that Watkins said\n″one or two sentences about the indictments,″ something like, ″there could be an indictment or are you\nstill interested in the indictments.″ She testified that she responded by telling Watkins that she did not\nrepresent the Hills and ″it would be inappropriate for [her] to talk about it.″ Blue added that she later\nreceived another phone call from Watkins during which Watkins ″mentioned the Hills.″ Blue reminded\nWatkins that she no longer represented the Hills so there was nothing she could talk about.8 Her\nrecollection of her response to Watkins about the indictments was affirmed by Malouf, who testified\n8\n    In the February 12, 2013 affidavit [*25] Blue filed in support of her motion for protective order regarding the subpoena to appear\nat the hearing, Blue testified that after she no longer represented the Hills, she received two phone calls from Watkins wherein ″at the\nvery beginning of the conversations, District Attorney Watkins used the word ’Hill’ or ″Hills″ (and in one of the conversations I recall\nhe also used the word ’indictment’ or ’indict’).″ She testified that ″[o]n both occasions, [she] immediately stopped the conversation and\ntold Mr. Watkins that [she] no longer represented [Hill or his wife] and could not talk to Mr. Watkins about the Hills.″\n\n                                                              Page 12 of 29\n\f                                                 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *25\n\n\n\nin his deposition that he overheard Blue tell Watkins that she no longer represented the Hills, so she\ncould not talk to him about the investigation of the Hills.\n\nHill maintained that Blue’s testimony about the two phone calls was not credible and reflected\nimproper communications between Watkins and his friend and political contributor. He further claimed\nthere could be ″no benign explanation″ for Watkins to call Blue about the indictments or the Hills\nduring a time when Blue was involved in a fee dispute with them. But before testifying about the phone\ncalls, Blue also described a meeting she had with Assistant District Attorney Terri Moore when she still\nrepresented the Hills. Blue said she discussed the potential for charges against [*26] the Hills with\nMoore and explained that she told Moore that this ″was a family fight.″9 Hill’s motion does not\nmention this meeting.\n\nOther than the two phones calls testified to by Blue, Hill presented nothing to show the substance of\nthe text messages or other phone calls exchanged between Blue and Watkins in the time leading up to\nthe indictments. Hill’s arguments about their content amount to speculation. Absent evidence regarding\nthe substances of the communications, Hill’s characterization about the timing of the text messages and\nphone calls does not necessarily suggest the communications were related to the indictments [*27] as\nopposed to other legitimate purposes. Again, Hill emphasized throughout his motion that Blue had a\npersonal and professional relationship with Watkins for many years. It is possible their communications\nencompassed a multitude of topics. Because of that relationship, contact with Watkins cannot be\nconsidered unusual.10\n\nSimilarly, other than Hill’s speculation that the timing of Blue’s campaign donations and fundraiser\nwere suspect, Hill did not present any evidence that Blue’s status as a political patron related to the\nindictments. As Hill pointed out in his motion, Blue had been a contributor and supporter of Watkins\nsince 2007, well before her fee dispute with Hill. Hill also emphasized that Watkins announced his\nre-election campaign in Blue’s house in November 2009. But this merely supports the fact that Blue\nhad a long-term relationship with Watkins, not that Blue’s political contributions related [*28] to the\nindictments. In fact, Blue’s representation of the Hills in the trust litigation did not begin until\nNovember 2009. Further, Hill’s accusation that Tillotson’s campaign contributions in 2010 influenced\nWatkins’s decision to prosecute Hill is not supported by any evidence.\n\nB. Hill’s Allegation He Was Vindictively Prosecuted\n\nHill also sought dismissal of the indictments on the ground that the prosecution was initiated in\nretaliation for having exercised his right to petition the civil court in two cases: the trust litigation and\nthe fee-dispute trial. HN5 ″Prosecutorial vindictiveness″ refers to a situation in which the State acts\nagainst a defendant by bringing criminal charges ″in retaliation for the defendant’s exercise of his legal\n9\n   Blue testified to her meeting with Moore in her February 12 affidavit. Specifically, Blue testified that in the meeting with Moore, she\nrecommended that the Hills not be indicted. She described Moore as ″non-committal″ and testified that Moore provided no response to\nthe recommendation. Blue also testified that she first learned the DA’s office was investigating the Hills by reading a May 2010 D\nMagazine article. She said she later learned about the formal complaint sent by Lynn in February 2010 and clarified that she did not\nparticipate in preparing that complaint.\n10\n    Hill also claimed that the communications ceased ″almost completely in the days and weeks″ after the indictments were publicly\nannounced. But the phone records attached to Hill’s motion end on April 30, 2011. Hill does not provide any records after that date to\nsupport this allegation.\n\n                                                              Page 13 of 29\n\f                                                  2014 Tex.

Hill alleged that the decision to prosecute him was prompted by his father’s anger\nafter receiving an adverse ruling in the trust litigation and by the animus of Blue in the fee-dispute\nlitigation. He also maintained that the\n\n     timing, circumstances, and unusual if not unprecedented nature of the Hill indictments make\n     abundantly clear that the real motivation of these indictments was to benefit [Watkins’s]\n     prolific campaign contributor [his father’s lawyer’s law partner], and to assist [Watkins’s]\n     friend and benefactor, [Blue] by impairing the Hills’ ability to contest [Blue’s] enormous fee\n     claims.\n\nHe claimed such animus was demonstrated by the improprieties inherent in the indictments [*31] (such\nas his denial of any pre-indictment notice or opportunity to be heard by the grand jury), the\n″unprecedented nature″ of the charges, and Hill’s belief that the DA’s office did not conduct a thorough\ninvestigation before indicting him.\n\nThat the decision to prosecute was prompted by his father’s anger is not supported by any evidence\nin the record.

Nor does it support an allegation that he\n″would not have been prosecuted except for the animus.″ Koh, 199 F.3d at 640.\nIn addition, Hill proffered no actual evidence related to improprieties inherent in the indictments, his\nclaim about the ″unusual″ or ″unprecedented″ nature of the charges, or his belief that the indictments\nwere not thoroughly investigated. Hill’s only attempt at proving he was denied notice of the possible\ncharges and access to the grand jury was by attaching an unauthenticated [*32] 2007 article that\ndescribed the DA’s office having such a policy. Hill did not present any evidence that such notice and\naccess was actually the policy of the DA’s office or its specialized crime division at the time or that\nnotice or that grand jury access had been provided to other defendants but denied as to him. Martin,\na specialized crime prosecutor, stated in her affidavit that her regular practice did not include providing\nnotice to an accused of a contemplated charge. Further, the record showed that the Hills knew about\nthe potential for indictments. In May 2010, while Blue still represented the Hills in the trust litigation,\nD Magazine published an article questioning whether the DA’s office would go after the Hills for\nmortgage fraud.12 Blue testified in her deposition that after she learned about the potential\ninvestigation, she met with Moore and recommended that the Hills not be indicted.\n\nAlthough Hill alleged that Smith communicated her ″concerns″ about the [*33] charges during a\nconversation with his counsel, he provided no evidence to show that any statements were actually\nmade by Smith. Moreover, other evidence in the record shows that the DA’s office did, in fact,\ninvestigate the allegations. For example, in seeking a continuance in the fee-dispute litigation after the\nindictments were returned, counsel for the Hills stated that the DA’s office was producing ″thousands\nof pages″ of criminal discovery that needed review before the Hills could assess their position in the\nfee-dispute trial. In her affidavit filed with the State’s response to Hill’s motion, Martin also attested\nto the scope of her investigation, which spanned several months and included receiving documents\nfrom various sources and talking to the bank’s legal counsel.\nFinally, Hill claimed that the DA’s office was motivated to bring charges to impair the Hills’ ability\nto contest Blue’s fee claims in the fee-dispute litigation as a way to curry favor with a political\ncontributor. Yet the record shows that the federal judge in the fee-dispute litigation would not have\nbeen asked to draw a negative inference to the extent that the Hills were forced to invoke their Fifth\nAmendment privilege. [*34] The federal judge also recognized that because extensive discovery\nincluding depositions had already occurred before the indictments were returned, the ″horse [was]\nalready out of the barn.″\nIn short, other than Hill’s belief that the DA’s office served as a ″stalking horse″ for others, Hill\npresented no evidence to support his conclusion and could only speculate as to the nature of the\nmortgage-fraud charges and how the charges were investigated within the DA’s office. Hill’s\nspeculation is not evidence of vindictive prosecution. Cf. Bucci, 582 F.3d at 114 (″To obtain discovery,\n[the defendant] must do more than simply ’identify a potential motive for prosecutorial animus’″; ″[h]e\nmust connect any vindictive animus to those making the challenged charging decisions in his case.″)\n(quoting United States v.

Hill’s Allegation He Was Selectively Prosecuted\nHill’s third allegation was that the indictments should be dismissed because he was denied equal\nprotection under the law when he was prosecuted under circumstances that do not normally lead to\ncriminal prosecution and when he was denied the benefit of pre-indictment notice.\n\nHN7 A selective prosecution claim is an assertion that the State brought charges ″for reasons forbidden\nby [*35] the Constitution.″ Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463-64. A selective-prosecution claim draws on\n″ordinary equal protection standards″ and requires a defendant to prove the existence of purposeful\ndiscrimination. Id. at 465; see also Matney v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 628 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n2002, no pet.). To make out a prima facie case, the defendant must first show that he has been singled\nout for prosecution while others similarly situated and committing the same acts have not been\nprosecuted. Matney, 99 S.W.3d at 628. He must also show that the State’s discriminatory selection of\nhim for prosecution was invidious or in bad faith. Id.; see also Gawlik v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2432749\"><a href=\"/opinion/2432749/gawlik-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 673\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1980).\nHill’s allegations fail to present a prima facie case that he was selectively prosecuted. He did not\npresent any evidence that he was singled out for prosecution under circumstances that do not normally\nlead to prosecution. Nor did he offer any evidence that he was treated differently because he was\ndenied pre-indictment notice of the contemplated charges and the opportunity for his lawyer to present\nhis views to the grand jury in contravention of what Hill claimed is the DA’s office’s ″longstanding\npractice.″ His allegations about the DA’s office’s motivations for prosecuting him amount to\nspeculation with no credible evidence to support his theories.\n\nV.\n\nHN8 There is an evidentiary [*36] threshold that must be met by the defendant before he is entitled\nto an evidentiary hearing on his claims that he was prosecuted in violation of his constitutional rights.\nSee In re United States, 397 F.3d at 284. That burden requires a defendant to do more than make\nunsupported allegations or speculative inferences about an improper motive. See Jennings, 724 F.2d at\n445-46. Stated another way, before a defendant gets to make inquiries into the State’s decision to\nprosecute, the defendant must support his allegations with evidence that tends to establish his\nconstitutional claims. See id.; see also Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 468. The record before us shows that\nthe trial judge granted Hill an evidentiary hearing so that Hill could ″try to prove″ that he was\nprosecuted in violation of his constitutional rights. By conducting this evidentiary hearing before Hill\nmet the evidentiary threshold, the judge turned the standard around and put the burden on the State to\nshow why Watkins was not operating under a conflict of interest and how the prosecution of Hill was\nnot vindictive or selective.\nWe conclude Hill did not make the proper showing sufficient to establish a prima face case of his\nalleged constitutional violations. Because Hill did not meet his burden, we also conclude the [*37] trial\njudge erred in conducting a hearing on Hill’s motion to dismiss. Consequently, the charges against Hill\nshould not have been dismissed. We resolve the State’s second issue in its favor. Based on our\nresolution of the State’s second issue, we need not address the State’s remaining issues. TEX. R.

Crim. App. 1999).\nHill’s motion to quash and dismiss the indictments was based on the following facts: Hill and his father\nwere involved in ″a hotly-contested federal lawsuit involving multi-billion dollar trusts.″ In February\n2010, the federal judge presiding over the case entered an order finding that Hill’s father had testified\nfalsely and submitted evidence in bad faith. Four days later, Hill’s father, through his lawyer, submitted\nto the Dallas County District Attorney’s Office a letter accusing Hill and his wife of mortgage fraud.\nIn the months that followed, a law partner donated a total of $48,500 in three contributions to the\nre-election campaign of Dallas District Attorney Craig Watkins. No member of this firm [*41] had\npreviously donated to Watkins’s campaign.\nIn May 2010, Lisa Blue saw a magazine article raising the question of whether the district attorney’s\noffice would ″go after″ Hill ″for shenanigans related to the house in which they live.″ The article\ndescribed the circumstances surrounding the same $500,000 loan that had been reported to the district\nattorney. After Blue learned the investigation of Hill’s alleged criminal conduct had been leaked to the\npress, she had a meeting with Terri Moore, First Assistant District Attorney at the time. Blue\nrecommended that Hill not be indicted. Watkins was not present at the meeting.\n\n                                                Page 18 of 29\n\f                                                2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *41\n\n\n\nAlso in May 2010, the federal trust litigation settled. Following the settlement, Blue and her colleagues\nhad a conflict with Hill over payment of more than $50 million in attorneys’ fees attributed to Blue’s\nsix-month representation of Hill. Because of the indictments, Hill felt he could not testify and invoked\nhis Fifth Amendment rights in the federal proceeding.\n\nOn January 20, 2011, Blue and Watkins met for dinner. Also in January 2011, while Blue was with\nSteve Malouf, Watkins called Blue and said, ″There could be an indictment1 or are you still interested\nin the indictments or . [*42] . . .″ On another occasion, the date of which Blue could not remember,\nWatkins called Blue and again ″mentioned the Hills.″ Blue said, ″Craig, remember, I don’t represent\nthe Hills, so I can’t -- there’s nothing that I could talk about.″ Another lawyer was with Blue when she\nreceived this second call.\n\nBlue and Watkins exchanged numerous phone calls in March 2011. On March 3, 2011, Blue met with\nWatkins to take publicity photos in connection with a $100,000 donation Blue made in his honor to\nSMU law school in 2010. On March 9, 2011, Blue had a fundraiser for Watkins at her house and\ncontributed $5000 to Watkins. On March 22, 2011, Blue was deposed in connection with her fee\ndispute with Hill. On March 30, 2011, Blue and Watkins again met for dinner. On March 31, 2011, the\nHills were indicted on charges of mortgage fraud. The indictments were made public two weeks before\nthe $50 million fee dispute trial.\n\nOn October 12, 2012, approximately eighteen months after the Hills were indicted, the Hills’ defense\ncounsel met with Assistant District Attorney Deborah Smith who described a ″reevaluation″ [*43] of\ncertain cases and said she had already decided to recommend dismissing certain charges against both\nHill and his wife. Smith ″expressed significant concerns about the cases against the Hills, made clear\nthat she had no role in obtaining the indictments, [and] said that the interviews of witnesses she was\nconducting should have been conducted much earlier.″ Shortly after the meeting, the DA moved to\ndismiss all charges against Hill’s wife ″in the interest of justice.″ On October 22, 2012, in response to\na follow-up email from Hill’s counsel, Smith wrote that she had been reassigned to prosecute animal\ncruelty cases.\n\nOn February 14, 2013, the trial judge conducted a hearing on Hill’s motion to dismiss. The trial judge\nstated she did not take her authority to dismiss a case filed by the prosecutor lightly and emphasized\nthe limited nature of that authority. The trial judge, over the State’s objection, called Blue as a witness.\nBlue took the stand and invoked her Fifth Amendment right on all questions.\n\nHill’s attorney called Watkins to the stand. Counsel for the State objected on the basis of lawyer/client\nprivilege. Specifically, counsel argued the State of Texas was represented by the district attorney, [*44]\nand the State therefore had a right to assert the privilege to prevent its lawyers from disclosing ″any\nother fact which came to their knowledge by virtue of their representation of the State.″ Counsel for\nthe State argued conversations between Blue and Watkins were work product because they would\n″reveal [Watkins’s] mental impression.″ The trial judge instructed the State to ″bring Mr. Watkins\ndown.″\n\nAn assistant district attorney entered the courtroom and stated she had spoken to Watkins, Watkins was\nin the office, but Watkins was not going to make himself available. The trial judge asked if Watkins\n1\n    In 2014, the Dallas County District Attorney’s website said 100,000 cases are processed per year.\n\n                                                             Page 19 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *44\n\n\n\nwas informed that the questions were going to be limited to his discussions with Blue. The assistant\ndistrict attorney stated she was not aware of that and further stated she knew ″[Watkins] to be ill,″ and\nhe was not ″in a condition to be able to testify in this matter.″ Following further discussion as to the\nextent of Watkins’s illness and the fact that Watkins was under subpoena to testify, the trial judge\ngranted a continuance.\n\nOn March 7, 2013, the trial judge conducted a hearing at which Blue’s counsel stated Blue’s position\nthat ″she would assert her Fifth Amendment privilege today just as she [*45] had before.″ Hill called\nWatkins as a witness and, after a private consultation with counsel, Watkins took the stand and refused\nto answer any questions ″because of [his] right as an attorney to have the privilege and to protect [his]\nwork product.″ Following a discussion of whether any privilege had been waived by providing\naffidavits of the people who worked for Watkins, the trial judge ordered Watkins to answer the\nquestions. Watkins refused, and the trial judge held him in contempt.\n\nHill was prepared to call witnesses to testify regarding the authenticity of the exhibits attached to his\nmotion to dismiss and certain other documents. Although it is not clear which exhibits were at issue,\ncounsel for the State agreed he was stipulating to the authenticity of the exhibits.\n\nTerri Moore, a former Dallas assistant district attorney, testified Donna Strittmatter and Stephanie\nMartin, two other assistant district attorneys, came to Moore and asked for permission to use the\nresources of the office to investigate Hill. Moore inquired whether Hill’s father had made the\nallegations against him, and Strittmatter and Martin told Moore ″there was a lawsuit between the father\nand the son.″ Moore [*46] said, ″I’m sure dad is trying to get some kind of strategic advantage over\nhis son in the lawsuit, so be very, very skeptical of whatever he may have told you.″ Moore added, ″Be\ncareful, because [Hill’s father] is just using the office . . . .″\n\nStrittmatter testified she attended the pitch session at which Watkins was present. Watkins did not say\nanything about conversations with Blue regarding the Hills. Strittmatter testified Watkins’s only\ninvolvement in preparing the case for the grand jury was that he was present at the pitch session. The\npitch session was in January 2011, and the case was presented to the grand jury approximately two and\na half months later.\n\nStrittmatter testified Moore told her ″to be suspicious of the complaint″ she received from Hill’s father.\nStrittmatter later learned the trust ″offered the bargain over a nonprosecution affidavit in this case″ so\nthat Hill would drop his claim for the assets of the trust. In investigating the case, Strittmatter\ndiscovered the ″title agency missed something on the abstract of the property.″ When asked if she was\naware whether the Dallas County District Attorney’s Office had ″indicted a mortgage fraud case where\nthe loan was [*47] fully collateralized, paid as expected, and repaid in full and there was no complaint\nfrom the bank, but it was indicted anyway,″ Strittmatter answered she ″was not aware because [she\nhad] not been the mortgage fraud prosecutor.″ When asked the same question again, Strittmatter\nanswered, ″I don’t know, but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t happened.″ When the trial judge asked if there\nwas a way to identify similar cases via computer, Strittmatter answered, ″We have a computer, but it\nwouldn’t say that much detail, Your Honor. It’d really be the — the prosecutors’ individual memory.″\n\nMartin testified that, on February 22, 2010, Strittmatter called her into a meeting with Lynn and gave\nher a copy of a complaint alleging Hill had stolen from the trust ″because eighty percent of the house\n\n                                                Page 20 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *47\n\n\n\nwas put into a mortgage.″ Martin denied having ″concerns about a case in which the bank was not the\none that complained about the alleged fraud.″ Martin testified Moore told her to be suspicious of Hill’s\nfather. Martin testified that, from the moment she got the complaint and reviewed the exhibits, she\nthought she had a good case and immediately started requesting original documents.\n\nMartin invited Watkins [*48] to the pitch session because the case against Hill ″would get some media\nattention, possibly national media attention.″ Martin testified that, if Watkins had told her ″this is too\nmuch of a hot potato; let’s just let it go,″ she would not have put the case before the grand jury.\n\nOn redirect examination, Hill’s counsel showed Martin notes Martin identified as ″two different days\nwhere I wrote notes about having talked to David Pickett.″ The first date was September 8, 2010, and\nnoted the following:\n\n   David Pickett calls all the time. Investigation is slowly going, and I told him that. Today he\n   wanted a definite timeline. I told him I can’t give you a timeline. I’ve got things to do on the\n   case and haven’t done them because I’m getting ready for trial. He said Trust is actual victim\n   after I told him bank really isn’t interested in prosecuting. Told him that in research I’d done,\n   didn’t see how I could prove his criminal case at this time. He said he sent -- gave all that stuff\n   to me. I said I’d go back and look, but getting ready for trial. He then sends e-mail. I showed\n   it to Chief D. Strittmatter, and then she said to show to First Assistant Terri Moore so she would\n   have all info, if needed. [*49] Took to Terri Moore, and she said, okay, in a few weeks call him\n   to discuss the matter.\n\nUpon further questioning, Martin testified the bank’s general counsel said ″we wouldn’t have filed a\ncomplaint because we -- the loan got repaid, but she would do whatever [Martin] wanted her to do as\nfar as prosecuting the case because, by law, she has to.″ The trial judge, reading from Martin’s notes,\nstated ″and then it goes on to say, I’ve talked to David Pickett multiple times since then. He was okay\nwith not indicting for the Trust as a victim because the bank is actual -- who was defrauded under the\nfraud statutes and going forward with indictments.″ In response to questioning, Martin testified the part\nof her note the trial judge read was ″probably″ added after Hill filed his motion to dismiss for\nprosecutorial misconduct.\n\nThus, as the trial judge summarized the situation, the pitch session was held only because the case\nagainst Hill was a potentially high publicity case; Martin invited Watkins to the pitch session and\nwould not have gone forward with the case against Hill without Watkins’s approval; the only person\nwho could know Watkins’s motivations was Watkins and, maybe, Blue; and neither [*50] Watkins nor\nBlue were testifying. The trial judge gave Watkins another opportunity to come down and testify and\ntook a brief recess. When the hearing recommenced, counsel for the State told the trial judge Watkins\nwould not testify.\n\nFollowing the presentation of evidence, the trial judge made an oral finding that, ″because of the failure\nof Mr. Watkins to testify in this hearing, the Defendant has been denied his right to have a meaningful\nhearing on his Motion to Dismiss.″ The trial judge then dismissed the cases. This appeal followed.\n\nIn its first two points of error, the State argues the trial court abused its discretion by granting Hill an\nevidentiary hearing and dismissing the indictments against him because (1) Hill tendered no evidence\n\n                                                 Page 21 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *50\n\n\n\nto support his request and (2) the facts Hill alleged failed to establish a constitutional violation.\nSpecifically, the State challenges the trial judge’s decision to hold an evidentiary hearing on Hill’s\nclaims of prosecutorial misconduct in its first two issues. The State first complains about Hill’s proffer\nof evidence in support of his motion. The State argues that Hill needed to present evidence to support\nhis claims before he was entitled [*51] to an evidentiary hearing and, because Hill ″simply made\nunsworn allegations″ in his motion and ″attached a stack of unauthenticated documents″ as exhibits,\nhe basically provided no evidence to support his central allegations. The State asserts that, under\nUnited States v. Armstrong, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118022\"><a href=\"/opinion/118022/united-states-v-armstrong/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118022\"><a href=\"/opinion/118022/united-states-v-armstrong/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The State contends that, because Hill tendered no evidence (other than some trial transcripts\nand deposition testimony, both of which the State argues are not clear evidence sufficient to dispel the\npresumption the prosecutor acted with a proper motive), the trial judge erred in conducting the\nevidentiary hearing. In response, Hill states the facts cast doubt on the constitutionality of the\nprosecution and not only entitle him to an evidentiary hearing but also establish a prima facie showing\nof prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nThe trial court’s decision to conduct an evidentiary hearing and dismiss the indictments with prejudice\nis reviewed for an abuse of discretion. See Terrazas, 970 S.W.2d at 159. The test for whether the trial\ncourt abused its [*52] discretion is whether the action was arbitrary or unreasonable. State v.

Crim. App. 2010).\n\nSelective prosecution and vindictive prosecution are not defenses on the merits to the criminal charge\nbut independent assertions that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons the Constitution\nprohibits. See Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463; Ex Parte Quintana, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2546516\"><a href=\"/opinion/2546516/ex-parte-quintana/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 685 (Tex. App.—El\nPaso 2009, pet. ref’d). Generally, prosecutors have broad discretion in enforcing criminal laws. See\nNeal, 150 S.W.3d at 173. But selective prosecution does limit a prosecutor’s otherwise broad discretion\nin determining what crimes to prosecute and how. Quintana, 346 S.W.3d at 685; see Roise v.

This burden\nfalls on the defendant because the presumption is that a prosecution for a violation of a criminal law\nis taken upon in ″good faith and in nondiscriminatory fashion″ to bring violators to justice. See Gawlik\nv.

To establish a prima facie case, the defendant must show that: (1) the\ngovernment has singled him out for prosecution even though the government has not proceeded against\nothers similarly situated based on the type of conduct for which [*53] he is charged; and (2) the\ngovernment’s discriminatory selection is invidious, which means that the selection is based on\nimpermissible considerations such as race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of\nconstitutional rights or based on some arbitrary classification. Quintana, 346 S.W.3d at 685; Garcia,\n172 S.W.3d at 273-74. The defendant must provide ″exceptionally clear″ evidence that the decision to\nprosecute was for an improper reason to establish a prima facie case of selective prosecution.

I disagree,\nhowever, with the State’s first argument that Hill provided ″no evidence″ with his motion in support\nof his claims.\n\nHill alleged in his motion that the influence exercised upon Watkins by Hill’s father, his father’s\nlawyer, and Blue deprived him of due process. He explained that Watkins had ″a financial stake in the\nprosecution of the Hills″ because indicting them benefited Blue (who was involved in a dispute with\nthe Hills over attorneys’ fees) and counsel for his father (who also was a major campaign contributor)\n″which in turn benefited″ Watkins. Hill claimed Blue’s influence and involvement with the indictment\nprocess were demonstrated by Blue’s admission that Watkins contacted her two times before the\nindictments were returned and the pattern of phone calls and text messages exchanged between Blue\nand Watkins (and others in the DA’s office) in the weeks before the indictments were returned.\n\n                                                 Page 24 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *58\n\n\n\nIn his motion, Hill argued that, to prevail on his vindictive prosecution claim, he was required to show\nthat (1) ″the [*59] prosecutor harbored genuine animus toward the defendant, or was prevailed upon\nto bring the charges by another with animus such that the prosecutor could be considered a ’stalking\nhorse’″ and (2) ″he would not have been prosecuted except for the animus.″ United States v. Koh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767139\"><a href=\"/opinion/767139/united-states-v-myung-s-koh/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 640 (2d Cir. 1999). Hill alleged that the decision to prosecute him was prompted by the anger\nof his father after receiving an adverse ruling in the trust litigation and the animus of Blue in the\nfee-dispute litigation. He also maintained that the\n\n   timing, circumstances, and unusual if not unprecedented nature of the Hill indictments make\n   abundantly clear that the real motivation of these indictments was to benefit [Watkins’s]\n   prolific campaign contributor [his father’s lawyer’s law partner], and to assist [Watkins’s]\n   friend and benefactor, [Blue] by impairing the Hills’ ability to contest [Blue’s] enormous fee\n   claims.\n\nHe claimed such animus was demonstrated by the improprieties inherent in the indictments (such as\nhis denial of any pre-indictment notice or opportunity to be heard by the Grand Jury), the\n″unprecedented nature″ of the charges, and Hill’s understanding that the DA’s office did not conduct\na thorough investigation before indicting him. Hill’s [*60] third allegation was that the indictments\nshould be dismissed because he was denied equal protection under the law when he was prosecuted\nunder circumstances that do not normally lead to criminal prosecution and when he was denied the\nbenefit of pre-indictment notice.\n\nThe State concedes Blue’s deposition testimony that Watkins called her two times regarding the Hill\nindictments was evidence. Attached to Hill’s motion to dismiss were exhibits including a complaint\nfrom Hill’s father’s attorney that the Hills committed mortgage fraud; excerpts from Watkins’s\ncampaign finance reports; emails between Blue, Hill, Malouf, and Charla Aldous; excerpts from Blue’s\ndeposition; and the indictments against the Hills. The record reflects that the State did not object to the\nnumerous exhibits attached to Hill’s motion to dismiss. Instead, the State filed a response to the merits\nof Hill’s assertions contained in Hill’s motion, appeared at the hearing on Hill’s motion, and ended up\nstipulating to the authenticity of the exhibits. Further, Blue took the Fifth and refused to testify\nconcerning her conversations with Watkins, which creates an adverse inference against the State. An\nadverse inference [*61] may not be drawn from a defendant’s proper invocation of a privilege because\nin a criminal case ″the stakes are higher and the State’s sole interest is to convict.″ Baxter v.\nPalmigiano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109429\"><a href=\"/opinion/109429/baxter-v-palmigiano/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 318-19, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109429\"><a href=\"/opinion/109429/baxter-v-palmigiano/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976). However, the danger of\nunfair prejudice is not the same when it is the defense rather than the State that seeks to draw an\ninference from a witness’s invocation of privilege. I would reject the State’s argument, made for the\nfirst time on appeal, that the exhibits were ″no evidence,″ see TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a), and overrule the\nState’s first issue.\n\nIn its second issue, the State argues Hill failed to make a prima facie case of a constitutional violation.\nAt the hearing on Hill’s motion to dismiss, the State made this same argument. However, the State\nraised this issue after the hearing had begun and after the trial judge determined Hill had already\nestablished a prima facie case. A review of the record shows the first thing the trial judge did at the\nFebruary 14 hearing was address the court’s power to dismiss the indictments against Hill. No new\nevidence was presented at the February 14 hearing. In response to the State’s argument that Hill\n                                                Page 25 of 29\n\f                                       2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *61\n\n\n\n″want[ed] information″ and ″that’s just discovery under 39.14,″ the trial judge questioned how [*62]\nHill could ″just want information″ when ″[Hill had] already provided, in the opinion of this Court,\nsufficient information.″ Later in the hearing, the trial judge specifically stated that ″civil lawyers in a\ncouple weeks ahead of time [of the indictments] making huge contributions to the District Attorney,\nand you have admissions by Ms. Blue that she discussed the indictments with Mr. Watkins″ established\na prima facie case to support the motion to dismiss. Another time, the trial judge stated, ″This is a\nhearing on a motion to dismiss or a motion to quash,″ and Hill ″presented sufficient evidence to the\nCourt in the form of their motion to dismiss and the response . . . to the State’s objections that I believe\nrise to the level of a prima facie showing.″\n\nThus, the record shows the trial judge made a determination that Hill established a prima facie case\nbefore the hearing on February 14. The trial judge began the hearing by questioning the court’s\nauthority to dismiss the indictments against Hill, not by addressing the issue of whether Hill made a\nprima facie showing of a constitutional violation. The trial judge’s references to a ″hearing″ to follow\nreferred to a hearing on specific [*63] issues the trial judge identified, not the issue of a prima facie\ncase. Notably, the February 14 hearing was continued due to Watkins’s refusal to appear, necessitating\nfurther ″hearings″ on the dismissal issue.\n\nThe gist of the allegations presented in Hill’s motion is that there was an untoward interest in indicting\nhim. He specifically claimed he was deprived of his right to a disinterested prosecutor and that he had\nbeen vindictively and selectively prosecuted. As proof of the alleged constitutional violations, Hill\nemphasized in his motion the following: (1) Watkins’s campaign records showing political contributions\nfrom a lawyer associated with his father in the months after the February 2010 complaint and five\nmonths before the indictments were returned and a donation by Blue less than a month before the\nindictments; (2) information showing that Blue hosted a fundraiser for Watkins in the month before the\nindictments; (3) the ″unusual″ nature of the charges against him; (4) the lack of notice to him that\nindictments were being considered; (5) the suspect timing of the indictments in that they were returned\njust before the fee-dispute trial involving Blue, which Hill claimed prevented [*64] him and his wife\nfrom testifying in that trial; (6) Blue’s telephone records and text message logs, which Hill claimed\nshow a ″heated exchange″ of communications with Watkins and his office in the weeks leading up to\nthe indictments and ending after the indictments were returned; (7) Blue’s admission during her\ndepositions that she discussed indictments with Watkins in the time before they were returned; (8)\nBlue’s comment made in her deposition that she would have no reason to discuss indictments with\nWatkins after they were returned; (9) Blue’s close relationship with Watkins; (10) defense counsel’s\nmeeting with Smith about the charges; and (11) the fact that the charges against Hill’s wife were\ndismissed. In addition, the trial judge heard from the district attorney’s office that they did not initially\nthink this was a good case, and the trial judge noted Martin was impeached with her own notes.\n\nI would conclude the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in determining these facts establish a\nprima facie case of a selective prosecution, vindictive prosecution, and absence of an impartial and\ndisinterested prosecutor. See Terrazas, 970 S.W.2d at 159. The evidence presented by Hill amounted\nto ″more than allegations.″ [*65] See Jennings, 724 F.2d at 445-46. By conducting a hearing after Hill\nmade a prima facie case of a constitutional violation, the trial judge correctly shifted the inquiry to\nwhether the State could produce evidence showing why the prosecution of Hill was not vindictive or\nselective or undertaken by an impartial and disinterested prosecutor. See Neal, 150 S.W.3d at 173.\n\n                                                 Page 26 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *65\n\n\n\nFollowing the State’s failure to present evidence from Watkins or Blue to rebut Hill’s prima facie case,\nthe trial judge did not abuse her discretion in dismissing the indictments against Hill. Id. at 173-75. I\nwould overrule the State’s second issue.\n\nIn its third issue, the State argues the trial judge abused her discretion by compelling Watkins to testify\nand then dismissing the indictments based on his refusal to testify. Specifically, the State argues Hill\nwas attempting to ″invade protected work product″ by seeking to discover the basis for Watkins’s\ndecision to seek indictments against Hill.\n\nIn its response to Hill’s motion to dismiss, the State asserted Hill’s argument assumed the district\nattorney was not free to discuss these crimes or his investigation with others or, more particularly, Blue.\nThe State argued Hill’s assumption is false and argued that, even if the district [*66] attorney spoke\nto Blue about Hill’s cases every single time the two communicated, there was nothing improper about\nit. As the county’s prosecuting authority, the district attorney is obligated to investigate allegations of\ncriminal activity and, according to the State, any source that could inform his decision about whether\nto prosecute and what to prosecute an individual for is fair game. The State argued it would be\nreasonable for the district attorney to conclude that Blue’s prior relationship with Hill, which was both\npersonal and professional, made her a potential source of reliable information.\n\nAgain, nowhere in its response did the State challenge the authenticity or veracity of any of the exhibits\nattached to Hill’s motion to dismiss or argue that Hill’s motion failed to make out a prima facie\nshowing that he had been prosecuted in violation of his constitutional rights. Further, the record shows\nthe State subsequently stipulated to the authenticity of the exhibits at a later hearing.\n\nWork product comprises:\n\n   (1) material prepared or mental impressions developed in anticipation of litigation or for trial\n   by or for a party or a party’s representatives, including the party’s attorneys, [*67] consultants,\n   sureties, indemnitors, insurers, employees, or agents; or\n   (2) a communication made in anticipation of litigation or for trial between a party and the\n   party’s representatives or among a party’s representatives, including the party’s attorneys,\n   consultants, sureties, indemnitors, insurers, employees, or agents.\n\nTEX.

(2) [u]se confidential information of a client to the\n   disadvantage of the client unless the client consents after consultation [or] (3) [u]se confidential\n   information of a former client to the disadvantage of the former client after the representation\n   is concluded unless the former client consents after consultation or the confidential information\n   has become generally known.\n\nTEX.

The communication could have\nbeen an inquiry of Blue as a ″potential source of reliable information″ against Hill, in which case the\ncommunication would have violated rule 1.05. Or the communication could have been an inquiry into\nwhether Blue, who had formerly urged the district attorney’s office not to indict Hill while she\nrepresented Hill, was ″still interested″ in preventing the indictments now that she was seeking in excess\nof $50 million in attorney’s fees from Hill. In that case, the characterization of Watkins’s\ncommunication as ″a communication made in anticipation of litigation or for trial″ cannot [*70] stand;\nthe purpose of the communication in that case would be to violate Hill’s constitutional rights under the\nguise of legitimate ″prosecution.″ None of these possibilities support the State’s theory that Watkins’s\ncommunication with Blue concerning the Hill indictments fit within the definition of work product. I\nwould overrule the State’s third issue.\nIn its fourth issue, the State argues the trial judge abused her discretion by dismissing the indictments\nwith prejudice. The State argues dismissal without prejudice would have cured the claimed\nconstitutional violations.\nDismissal with prejudice may be warranted when a defendant suffers demonstrable prejudice, or a\nsubstantial threat thereof, and where the trial court is unable to ″identify and neutralize the taint″ by\n\n                                                Page 28 of 29\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13835, *70\n\n\n\nother means. Frye, 897 S.W.2d at 330. Here, the evidence supported the trial judge’s determination that\nHill established a prima facie case his constitutional rights were violated, and the State presented no\nevidence enabling the trial judge to ″identify and neutralize the taint.″ See id. It was for the trial judge\nto decide the ultimate factual issue based upon the evidence and credibility determinations. Neal, 150\nS.W.3d at 174-75. I would conclude the trial judge [*71] did not abuse her discretion in dismissing the\nindictments with prejudice. I would overrule the State’s fourth issue.\n\nI would affirm the trial judge’s order dismissing the indictments in these cases.\n\nDAVID L.
