INTRODUCTION\n\n      When Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) in 2010, it built upon\n\nthe widespread use of employer-based health insurance in the United States.1 The ACA\n\nand its implementing regulations require employers who provide health insurance\n\ncoverage to their employees to include coverage for certain types of preventive care\n\nwithout cost to the insured. The appeals before us concern the regulations that require\n\ngroup health plans to cover contraceptive services for women as a form of preventive\n\ncare (“Mandate”).2\n\n      In response to religious concerns, the Departments implementing the ACA—\n\nHealth and Human Services (“HHS”), Labor, and Treasury—adopted a regulation that\n\nexempts religious employers—churches and their integrated auxiliaries—from covering\n\ncontraceptives. When religious non-profit organizations complained about their omission\n\nfrom this exemption, the Departments adopted a regulation that allows them to opt out of\n\n\n\n      1\n        A majority of the nonelderly population in the United States receives health\ninsurance as a job benefit through an employer. See Melissa Majerol, Vann Newkirk &\nRachel Garfield, The Uninsured: A Primer – Key Facts About Health Insurance and the\nUninsured in America, The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 1 (Jan.\n2015), http://files.kff.org/attachment/the-uninsured-a-primer-key-facts-about-health-\ninsurance-and-the-uninsured-in-america-primer.\n      2\n         We use “Mandate” as shorthand for the ACA’s employer mandate, which\nrequires employers who offer health benefits to comply with the coverage requirements\ndetailed in the ACA and its implementing regulations. This Mandate is distinct from the\nindividual mandate at issue in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius,\n132 S. Ct. 2566 (2012), which generally requires individuals to maintain health\ninsurance.\n\n\n                                           -1-\n\fproviding, paying for, or facilitating contraceptive coverage.3 Under this regulation, a\n\nreligious non-profit organization can opt out by delivering a form to their group health\n\nplan’s health insurance issuer or third-party administrator (“TPA”) or by sending a\n\nnotification to HHS.\n\n       The Plaintiffs in the cases before us are religious non-profit organizations. They\n\ncontend that complying with the Mandate or the accommodation scheme imposes a\n\nsubstantial burden on their religious exercise. The Plaintiffs argue the Mandate and the\n\naccommodation scheme violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”) and\n\nthe Religion and Speech Clauses of the First Amendment.4\n\n       Although we recognize and respect the sincerity of Plaintiffs’ beliefs and\n\narguments, we conclude the accommodation scheme relieves Plaintiffs of their\n\nobligations under the Mandate and does not substantially burden their religious exercise\n\nunder RFRA or infringe upon their First Amendment rights. Exercising jurisdiction\n\n       3\n         Plaintiffs object to the term “opt out” because their accommodation from the\nMandate involves an act on their part—self-certification—that they deem objectionable.\nWe believe “opt out” is accurate. Self-certifying for the accommodation expressly\nrelieves Plaintiffs of their obligation to provide, pay for, or facilitate contraceptive\ncoverage, and does so without substantially burdening their religious exercise. Under\nthese conditions, the self-certification is accurately characterized as an “opt out.” By\ndefinition, all opt-out mechanisms require some affirmative act by objecting parties.\n       4\n        RFRA applies to all subsequent federal statutes absent a specific exemption by\nCongress. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-3(b) (“Federal statutory law adopted after November\n16, 1993, is subject to this chapter unless such law explicitly excludes such application by\nreference to this chapter.”). The ACA, enacted in 2010, did not contain a specific\nexemption and is subject to RFRA. See Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d\n1114, 1157 (10th Cir. 2013).\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\funder 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a), we affirm the district court’s denial of a preliminary\n\ninjunction to the plaintiffs in Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Sebelius, 6 F.\n\nSupp. 3d 1225 (D. Colo. 2013), and reverse the district courts’ grants of a preliminary\n\ninjunction to the plaintiffs in Southern Nazarene University v. Sebelius, No. CIV-13-\n\n1015-F, 2013 WL 6804265 (W.D. Okla. Dec. 23, 2013), and Reaching Souls\n\nInternational, Inc. v. Burwell, No. CIV-13-1092-D, 2013 WL 6804259 (W.D. Okla. Dec.\n\n20, 2013).\n\n                         II. HOBBY LOBBY AND THIS CASE\n\n       Last year, the Supreme Court decided Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S.\n\nCt. 2751 (2014), in which closely-held for-profit corporations challenged the Mandate\n\nunder RFRA. The difference between Hobby Lobby and this case is significant and\n\nframes the issue here. In Hobby Lobby, the plaintiff for-profit corporations objected on\n\nreligious grounds to providing contraceptive coverage and could choose only between (1)\n\ncomplying with the ACA by providing the coverage or (2) not complying and paying\n\nsignificant penalties. Id. at 2759-60. In the cases before us, the plaintiff religious non-\n\nprofit organizations can avail themselves of an accommodation that allows them to opt\n\nout of providing contraceptive coverage without penalty. Plaintiffs contend the process\n\nto opt out substantially burdens their religious exercise.\n\n       In other words, unlike in Hobby Lobby, the Plaintiffs do not challenge the general\n\nobligation under the ACA to provide contraceptive coverage. They instead challenge the\n\nprocess they must follow to get out of complying with that obligation. The Plaintiffs do\n\n                                             -3-\n\fnot claim the Departments have not tried to accommodate their religious concerns. They\n\nclaim the Departments’ attempt is inadequate because the acts required to opt out of the\n\nMandate substantially burden their religious exercise. As we discuss more fully below,\n\nhowever, the accommodation relieves Plaintiffs of their obligation to provide, pay for, or\n\nfacilitate contraceptive coverage, and does so without substantially burdening their\n\nreligious exercise.\n\n                                   III. BACKGROUND\n\n       We begin by providing background information on the ACA and its implementing\n\nregulations, the Plaintiffs objecting to the accommodation scheme, and the procedural\n\nhistory of the three cases before us.\n\n                               A. Regulatory Background\n\n       The regulations at issue in these cases have evolved in significant ways since their\n\ninitial promulgation. We review: (1) the exemption from the ACA’s contraceptive\n\ncoverage requirement for churches and integrated auxiliaries, (2) the accommodation\n\nscheme for religious non-profit organizations, and (3) the mechanics of the\n\naccommodation scheme for different types of group health plans.\n\n1. The ACA Mandate and the Religious Employer Exemption\n\n       Under the ACA, employer-sponsored group health plans must meet minimum\n\ncoverage requirements. As part of these requirements, both group health plans and health\n\ninsurance issuers must cover preventive health care services and cannot require plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries to share the costs of these services through co-payments,\n\n                                           -4-\n\fdeductibles, or co-insurance. 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13. On July 19, 2010, the Departments\n\nissued interim final rules implementing the ACA’s requirements for preventive services.\n\nInterim Final Rules for Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to\n\nCoverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\n\n75 Fed. Reg. 41,726 (July 19, 2010).\n\n      Among the services required by the ACA are preventive care and screenings for\n\nwomen “as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources\n\nand Services Administration” (“HRSA”), a federal agency within HHS. 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 300gg-13(a)(4). On August 1, 2011, after receiving recommendations from the\n\nInstitute of Medicine (“IOM”), the HRSA issued its guidelines for women’s preventive\n\nhealth services. The guidelines include coverage of “[a]ll Food and Drug Administration\n\n[(“FDA”)] approved contraceptives, sterilization procedures, and patient education and\n\ncounseling for all women with reproductive capacity,” as prescribed by a health care\n\nprovider. HRSA, Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines,\n\nhttp://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines (last visited Mar. 25, 2015).\n\n      In accordance with the HRSA’s guidelines, the Departments require coverage of\n\nthe full range of FDA-approved contraceptive services. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n2713(a)(1)(iv); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv); 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv). Not\n\nall employers, however, are required to comply with the Mandate.\n\n      First, employers with 50 or fewer employees are exempt from the Mandate\n\nbecause they are not required to offer insurance under the ACA. See 26 U.S.C.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f§§ 4980H(c)(2)(A), 4980D(d).\n\n       Second, “grandfathered” plans are exempt from the Mandate because the ACA\n\nallows individuals to temporarily maintain the health coverage they possessed before the\n\nACA was enacted. See 42 U.S.C. § 18011.5\n\n       Third, and the most relevant here, is the exemption for religious employers. In\n\nresponse to concerns from religious organizations, the Departments amended the interim\n\nfinal regulations to give the HRSA authority to exempt group health plans established or\n\nmaintained by religious employers. See Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers\n\nRelating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable\n\nCare Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 46,621, 46,623 (Aug. 3, 2011). The Departments defined a\n\n“religious employer” as one that: “(1) Has the inculcation of religious values as its\n\npurpose; (2) primarily employs persons who share its religious tenets; (3) primarily\n\nserves persons who share its religious tenets; and (4) is a nonprofit organization described\n\nin section 6033(a)(1) and section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the [Internal Revenue]\n\nCode.” Id. The cited sections “refer to churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and\n\nconventions or associations of churches, as well as the exclusively religious activities of\n\n       5\n         The exception for grandfathered plans is temporary and transitional. A health\nplan loses its grandfathered status—and is subject to the Mandate—when it eliminates\nbenefits, increases cost sharing requirements, or changes the terms of employer\ncontributions. See 45 C.F.R. § 147.140(g). In 2011, 56 percent of individuals who\nreceive health care from their employer were covered by grandfathered plans; in 2014,\nonly 26 percent were covered by grandfathered plans. See Kaiser Family Foundation &\nHealth Research & Educational Trust, Employer Health Benefits: 2014 Annual Survey, 7\n(2014), http://files.kff.org/attachment/2014-employer-health-benefits-survey-full-report.\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fany religious order.” Id. The Departments noted the definition was intended “to\n\nreasonably balance the extension of any coverage of contraceptive services under the\n\nHRSA Guidelines to as many women as possible, while respecting the unique\n\nrelationship between certain religious employers and their employees in certain religious\n\npositions.” Id.6 They invited comments on the proposed definition of “religious\n\nemployer” and potential alternatives. Id.\n\n       The Departments received more than 200,000 responses to their request for\n\ncomments from a variety of entities both supporting and opposing expansion of the\n\nproposed exemption. See Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to\n\nCoverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\n\n77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8726 (Feb. 15, 2012). After reviewing these comments, they\n\npublished final regulations on February 15, 2012, adopting their proposed definition of\n\n“religious employer.” Id. at 8727. They also created a one-year safe harbor for religious\n\nnon-profit organizations, during which the Departments would not enforce the Mandate\n\nagainst them. Id. at 8728.\n\n2. The Accommodation Scheme for Religious Non-Profit Organizations\n\n       In response to religious groups that were dissatisfied with the scope of the\n\nproposed religious employer exemption, the Departments issued an advance notice of\n\n       6\n        A number of states have laws that require employers to cover contraceptive\nservices but excuse some religious employers from complying. The Departments\ndeveloped their definition to accord with these existing state laws. See 76 Fed. Reg. at\n46,623.\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fproposed rulemaking (“ANPRM”) in anticipation of creating additional accommodations\n\nfor non-exempt religious non-profit organizations. Certain Preventive Services Under the\n\nAffordable Care Act, 77 Fed. Reg. 16,501 (Mar. 21, 2012). After reviewing the\n\ncomments received from the ANPRM, the Departments published proposed rules\n\ncreating an accommodation for a wider range of religious non-profit organizations.\n\nCoverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 78 Fed. Reg.\n\n8456 (Feb. 6, 2013).\n\n       The Departments received over 400,000 comments on the proposed rules, and\n\nfinalized two notable changes. Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the\n\nAffordable Care Act, 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870, 39,871 (July 2, 2013). First, the Departments\n\nsimplified and clarified the existing exemption for religious employers by eliminating the\n\nfirst three elements of the definition, thereby defining “religious employer” as “an\n\nemployer that is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is referred to in section\n\n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the [Internal Revenue] Code [(“IRC”)].” Id. at 39,874.\n\nSecond, they created an accommodation for religious non-profit organizations that did\n\nnot meet this simplified definition of a religious employer. Id.\n\n       The regulations state a religious non-profit organization can receive this\n\naccommodation if it: (1) has religious objections to “providing coverage for some or all\n\nof the contraceptive services required to be covered” under the Mandate, (2) “is\n\norganized and operates as a nonprofit entity,” (3) “holds itself out as a religious\n\norganization,” and (4) “self-certifies that it satisfies the first three criteria.” Id. The\n\n                                              -8-\n\faccommodation is available for both (1) insured group health plans, under which an\n\nemployer contracts with a health insurance issuer to assume the risk of providing benefits\n\nto employees, and (2) self-insured group health plans, under which the employer itself\n\nassumes the risk of providing benefits to employees. Id. at 39,875-80.7 As we explain\n\nbelow, religious non-profit organizations can self-certify their religious objection and\n\nreceive the accommodation either by notifying their health insurance issuer or TPA or by\n\nnotifying HHS directly.\n\n             a. EBSA Form 700\n\n       To self-certify under the accommodation scheme, the Departments initially\n\nrequired religious non-profit organizations to use the Employee Benefits Security\n\nAdministration’s (“EBSA”) Form 700 (“Form”).8 Objecting organizations are relieved\n\nfrom complying with the Mandate by delivering the executed Form to their health\n\ninsurance issuer or TPA. The Form notifies the health insurance issuer or TPA that the\n\norganization self-certifies as exempt from the Mandate because it has a religious\n\nobjection to providing coverage for some or all contraceptive services to its employees,\n\nand identifies the relevant federal regulations under which the organization is permitted\n\nto opt out of that obligation. See Dep’t of Labor, EBSA Form 700 (Aug. 2014),\n\n       7\n        Employers with self-insured group health plans typically employ a TPA to\ncoordinate logistics and deliver benefits. Cong. Budget Office, Key Issues in Analyzing\nMajor Health Insurance Proposals, 6 (Dec. 2008),\nhttp://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/12-18-keyissues.pdf.\n       8\n           A copy of the Form appears at the end of this opinion.\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\fhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/preventiveserviceseligibleorganizationcertificationform.doc\n\n(citing 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(a); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(a); 45 C.F.R.\n\n§ 147.131(b)).\n\n       The back of the Form notifies TPAs of their obligations.9 Form at 2. It informs\n\nthe TPA that the eligible organization “[w]ill not act as the plan administrator or claims\n\nadministrator with respect to claims for contraceptive services, or contribute to the\n\nfunding of contraceptive services.” Form at 2. It identifies regulations requiring the TPA\n\nto provide contraceptive coverage without cost sharing to plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries if the TPA agrees to continue providing administrative services for a group\n\nhealth plan. Id. (citing 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A; 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16; 29 C.F.R. §\n\n2590.715-2713A). A TPA that receives the Form from an objecting employer is eligible\n\nfor a government payment to cover the costs of providing contraceptive coverage. See 45\n\nC.F.R. § 156.50(d)(5).\n\n       As part of this scheme, the regulations initially included a non-interference\n\nprovision, which specified that objecting religious non-profit organizations “must not,\n\ndirectly or indirectly, seek to influence the third party administrator’s decision” whether\n\nto provide coverage for contraceptives. 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(b)(iii) (2013).\n\nWhen the Plaintiffs filed their suits, they sought a preliminary injunction relieving them\n\n\n       9\n        The notice of regulatory requirements on the back of the Form is specifically\naddressed to TPAs. See Form at 2. The legal obligations of health insurance issuers are\nevident from the text of the ACA itself. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13.\n\n\n                                           - 10 -\n\ffrom complying with this version of the accommodation scheme, arguing delivery of the\n\nForm to their health insurance issuer or TPA constituted a substantial burden on their\n\nreligious exercise in violation of RFRA and the First Amendment.\n\n            b. Alternative notice\n\n       In response to litigation by Plaintiffs and others, the Departments have since\n\nexpanded the accommodation scheme.10 The Supreme Court granted injunctions pending\n\nappeal in two suits brought by religious non-profit organizations, including the Little\n\nSisters, that objected to the accommodation scheme. See Wheaton Coll. v. Burwell, 134\n\nS. Ct. 2806 (2014); Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged, Denver, Colo. v.\n\nSebelius, 134 S. Ct. 1022 (2014). In a third suit, the Court declined to recall or stay a\n\ncircuit court mandate in favor of the Government, but granted an injunction to religious\n\nnon-profit organizations pending final disposition of their petition for certiorari. See\n\nZubik v. Burwell, Nos. 14A1065, 14-1418, 2015 WL 3947586, at *1 (U.S. June 29,\n\n2015). The injunctions allowed the organizations to notify HHS directly of their religious\n\nobjection to the Mandate rather than sending the Form to their health insurance issuers or\n\nTPAs. In response to the injunction in Wheaton College, the Departments issued an\n\ninterim final rule on August 27, 2014, creating an alternative accommodation for\n\nreligious non-profit organizations. Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the\n\n       10\n          As we explain in this section, the Departments did not expand the pool of actors\nwho could claim an accommodation and obtain relief from the Mandate. They expanded\nthe accommodation scheme by offering objecting organizations an alternative method of\nself-certification.\n\n\n                                            - 11 -\n\fAffordable Care Act, 79 Fed. Reg. 51,092, 51,092 (Aug. 27, 2014).11\n\n       These regulations relieve a religious non-profit organization from complying with\n\nthe Mandate if it notifies HHS in writing of its religious objection to the provision of\n\nsome or all contraceptive services. Id. at 51,094. The notice may be sent by letter or\n\nemail, and must contain (1) “the name of the eligible organization and the basis on which\n\nit qualifies for an accommodation,” (2) “its objection based on sincerely held religious\n\nbeliefs to providing coverage of some or all contraceptive services,” including any\n\nparticular subset to which it objects; (3) the name and type of the group health plan; and\n\n(4) the name and contact information for any of the plan’s TPAs and/or health insurance\n\nissuers. Id. at 51,094-95. According to the Departments, these requirements constitute\n\n“the minimum information necessary for the Departments to determine which entities are\n\ncovered by the accommodation, to administer the accommodation, and to implement the\n\n\n       11\n          We discuss the procedural history of the cases before us below, but note that this\nalternative accommodation is akin to the accommodation granted by the Supreme Court\nin the cases mentioned above—Little Sisters, 134 S. Ct. 1022; Wheaton College, 134 S.\nCt. 2806; and Zubik, 2015 WL 3947586:\n\n       If the applicant informs the Secretary of Health and Human Services in\n       writing that it is a nonprofit organization that holds itself out as religious\n       and has religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive\n       services, the respondents are enjoined from enforcing against the applicant\n       the challenged provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n       and related regulations pending final disposition of appellate review. To\n       meet the condition for injunction pending appeal, the applicant need not use\n       the form prescribed by the Government, EBSA Form 700, and need not\n       send copies to health insurance issuers or third-party administrators.\n\nWheaton Coll., 134 S. Ct. at 2807.\n\n\n                                            - 12 -\n\fpolicies in the July 2013 final regulations.” Id. at 51,095.\n\n       The revised regulations also repeal the non-interference provision by deleting\n\nlanguage prohibiting organizations from interfering with or seeking to influence their\n\nTPA’s decision to cover contraception. Id.12\n\n       We note again that the entirety of this accommodation scheme for religious non-\n\nprofit organizations—using either the Form or the alternative notice to HHS—was not\n\navailable to the for-profit corporate plaintiff in Hobby Lobby. Here, an accommodation is\n\navailable to Plaintiffs. In the cases before us, we consider whether their taking advantage\n\nof that accommodation to opt out of the Mandate is itself a substantial burden on their\n\nreligious exercise.\n\n3. The Mechanics of the Accommodation for Insured Plans, Self-Insured Plans, and\n   Self-Insured Church Plans\n\n       The Plaintiffs use different types of employer-sponsored group health plans, which\n\nthe Departments treat differently within the accommodation scheme. By its own terms,\n\n       12\n            The regulations explain the rationale for this change:\n\n       The Departments interpret the July 2013 final regulations solely as\n       prohibiting the use of bribery, threats, or other forms of economic coercion\n       in an attempt to prevent a third party administrator from fulfilling its\n       independent legal obligations to provide or arrange separate payments for\n       contraceptive services. Because such conduct is generally unlawful and is\n       prohibited under other state and federal laws, and to reduce unnecessary\n       confusion, these interim final regulations delete the language prohibiting an\n       eligible organization from interfering with or seeking to influence a third\n       party administrator’s decision or efforts to provide separate payments for\n       contraceptive services.\n\n79 Fed. Reg. at 51,095.\n\n\n                                              - 13 -\n\fthe ACA obligates both group health plans and health insurance issuers to provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage. 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13 (“A group health plan and a health\n\ninsurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall, at a\n\nminimum provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements\n\nfor . . . with respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings . . . as\n\nprovided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and\n\nServices Administration for purposes of this paragraph.”); 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n2713(a)(1); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713(a)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1). Because the\n\ndifferences among these arrangements are relevant to our discussion of the merits of\n\nPlaintiffs’ claims, we consider it helpful to explain how the Mandate and accommodation\n\nscheme affect insured plans, self-insured plans, and self-insured church plans.\n\n          a. Insured plans\n\n       When a religious non-profit organization offers its employees an insured plan, the\n\nstatutory language not only requires the group health plan to cover contraception, but also\n\nobligates the plan’s health insurance issuer to ensure plan participants and beneficiaries\n\nreceive contraceptive coverage. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 300gg-13; 300gg-22. Thus, even if a\n\nreligious non-profit organization does not self-certify that it has an objection, its health\n\ninsurance issuer is obligated to provide contraceptive coverage to plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries and charge the organization for the cost. See Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep’t\n\nof Health & Hum. Servs., 7 F. Supp. 3d 88, 95-96 & n.2 (D.D.C. 2013). The organization\n\ncan free itself from complying with the Mandate and paying for that coverage, however,\n\n                                             - 14 -\n\f“if the eligible organization or group health plan provides either a copy of the self-\n\ncertification to each issuer providing coverage in connection with the plan or a notice to\n\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services.” 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(c)(1); 29\n\nC.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(c)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(1). When an organization\n\nsubmits the Form expressing an objection to providing contraceptive coverage, “the\n\nissuer has sole responsibility for providing such coverage in accordance with § 147.130.”\n\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(1)(i); see also 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(c)(1)(i) (requiring\n\ncoverage in accordance with § 54.9815-2713); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(c)(1)(i)\n\n(requiring coverage in accordance with § 2590.715-2713). Similarly, when an\n\norganization notifies HHS, the Department of Labor will send a separate notification to\n\nthe organization’s issuer informing it of that notice and describing its regulatory\n\nobligations. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(1)(ii); see also 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n2713AT(c)(1)(ii); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(c)(1)(ii).\n\n       In the context of insured plans, health insurance issuers are generally responsible\n\nfor paying for contraceptive coverage when a religious non-profit organization opts out.\n\nSee 45 C.F.R. § 156.50. The Departments expect this will be cost-neutral for issuers\n\nbecause of the cost savings that accompany improvements in women’s health and lower\n\npregnancy rates. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,877.\n\n          b. Self-insured plans\n\n       When a religious non-profit organization offers its employees a self-insured plan,\n\nthe accommodation works in a slightly different fashion. A self-insured group health\n\n                                            - 15 -\n\fplan complies with the regulatory requirements and is excused from providing\n\ncontraceptive coverage if “[t]he eligible organization or its plan contracts with one or\n\nmore third party administrators” and “[t]he eligible organization provides either a copy of\n\nthe self-certification to each third party administrator or a notice to the Secretary of\n\nHealth and Human Services that it is an eligible organization and of its religious\n\nobjection to coverage of all or a subset of contraceptive services.” 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n2713AT(b)(1); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1).\n\n       Although the text of the ACA does not specify a role for TPAs, it expressly\n\nrequires group health plans to include contraceptive coverage, and federal regulations\n\nimpose obligations on TPAs that administer self-insured group health plans. See 42\n\nU.S.C. § 300gg-13; 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(b); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b).\n\nThe regulations require a TPA administering a group health plan to provide or arrange for\n\ncontraceptive coverage without cost sharing with the organization or its beneficiaries\n\nwhen it: (1) receives a notification that an eligible employer has opted out of providing\n\ncoverage and (2) decides to remain in a relationship with that employer or its plan to\n\nprovide administrative services for the plan. 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(b)(2); 29\n\nC.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2). The TPA’s obligations are enforceable under the\n\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”). See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,879-80.\n\n       In the context of self-insured plans, a TPA may seek reimbursement if it has\n\nreceived the Form or a notification from the government and “provides or arranges\n\npayments for contraceptive services.” See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(b)(3); 29 C.F.R.\n\n                                            - 16 -\n\f§ 2590.715-2713A(b)(3); 45 C.F.R. § 156.50(d)(2)(ii)-(iii). TPAs do so by working\n\nthrough health insurance issuers, who receive adjustments to fees they pay to the\n\ngovernment under the ACA and pass along the reimbursements to TPAs. See 45 C.F.R.\n\n§ 156.50(d).\n\n           c. Self-insured church plans\n\n       Although federal regulations impose certain requirements on TPAs, the\n\nDepartments concede they lack authority to enforce those requirements as to self-insured\n\n“church plans,” which are group health plans established by a church or association of\n\nchurches covering the church’s or association’s employees. 29 U.S.C. § 1002(33).\n\nOrganizations that provide health care coverage for employees through self-insured\n\nchurch plans are exempt from regulation under ERISA. 29 U.S.C. § 1003(b)(2). Unless\n\na church plan has made an election under 26 U.S.C. § 410(d), which opts plans into\n\nprovisions of ERISA, the Departments concede they lack authority to compel church plan\n\nTPAs to provide contraceptive coverage, and may not levy fines against those TPAs for\n\nfailing to provide it.\n\n           d. Legal obligation to provide coverage after the accommodation\n\n       Although the accommodation is available for both insured and self-insured group\n\nhealth plans, the source of the legal obligation to provide contraceptive coverage after a\n\nreligious non-profit organization has opted out differs based on the type of insurance\n\narrangement the organization uses. When an organization takes advantage of the\n\naccommodation, the ACA requires health insurance issuers to provide coverage for\n\n                                           - 17 -\n\finsured group health plans, while federal regulations adopted pursuant to the ACA\n\nrequire TPAs to arrange coverage for self-insured group plans that are subject to ERISA.\n\nAs we discuss below, these distinctions shape the claims advanced by different Plaintiffs\n\nin the cases before us.\n\n                                    B. The Plaintiffs\n\n       The Plaintiffs13 in this litigation object to both means to receive an\n\naccommodation—sending the Form to their health insurance issuer or TPA or sending a\n\nnotification to HHS. The Plaintiffs differ from each other in ways that are relevant to the\n\nDepartments’ authority to require employers to provide contraceptive coverage and\n\nrelieve objecting religious non-profit organizations from the Mandate when they use the\n\naccommodation scheme.\n\n1. Little Sisters of the Poor\n\n       The Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged, Denver, Colorado and Little\n\nSisters of the Poor, Baltimore (“Little Sisters”) belong to an order of Catholic nuns who\n\ndevote their lives to care for the elderly. The Little Sisters provide health insurance\n\ncoverage to their employees through the Christian Brothers Employee Benefit Trust\n\n(“Trust”), a self-insured church plan that is not subject to ERISA. The Trust uses\n\nChristian Brothers Services (“Christian Brothers”), another Catholic organization, as its\n\nTPA.\n\n       13\n          When we refer to the plaintiffs in all three cases collectively, we use\n“Plaintiffs.” When we refer to a subset of the plaintiffs, we use “plaintiffs.”\n\n\n                                            - 18 -\n\f       The Little Sisters have always excluded coverage of sterilization, contraception,\n\nand abortifacients from their health care plan in accordance with their religious belief that\n\ndeliberately avoiding reproduction through medical means is immoral. The Little Sisters\n\n“believe that it is wrong for them to intentionally facilitate the provision of these medical\n\nprocedures, drugs, devices, and related counseling and services.” LS Br. at 10. They cite\n\n“well-established Catholic teaching that prohibits encouraging, supporting, or partnering\n\nwith others in the provision of sterilization, contraception, and abortion.” LS Br. at 9-10.\n\nThe Little Sisters contend they “cannot provide these things, take actions that directly\n\ncause others to provide them, or otherwise appear to participate in the government’s\n\ndelivery scheme,” as the mere appearance of condoning these services “would violate\n\ntheir public witness to the sanctity of human life and human dignity and could mislead\n\nother Catholics and the public.” LS Br. at 10.\n\n       The Little Sisters are subject to the Mandate unless they take advantage of the\n\naccommodation scheme by delivering the Form to the Christian Brothers, their TPA, or\n\nnotifying HHS of their religious objection. If they do not take one of these steps and do\n\nnot provide contraceptive coverage, they estimate a single Little Sisters home could incur\n\npenalties of up to $2.5 million per year, and allege the Trust could lose up to $130 million\n\nin plan contributions. The Little Sisters plaintiffs object that the accommodation scheme\n\nviolates their sincerely held religious beliefs because they cannot take actions that\n\ndirectly cause others to provide contraception or appear to participate in the Departments’\n\ndelivery scheme.\n\n                                            - 19 -\n\f2. Southern Nazarene\n\n       Southern Nazarene University, Oklahoma Wesleyan University, Oklahoma Baptist\n\nUniversity, and Mid-America Christian University are “Christ-centered institutions of\n\nhigher learning.” SN Br. at 1-2. Southern Nazarene is partially self-insured; it generally\n\nassumes the risks of providing coverage but contracts with a health insurance issuer to\n\npay all claims over $100,000. For its insured employee coverage, it uses Blue Cross Blue\n\nShield of Oklahoma. It offers separate coverage to students through an insured plan.\n\nOklahoma Baptist is an insured university. It uses Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma,\n\nand offers separate coverage to students through an insured plan. Oklahoma Wesleyan is\n\nan insured university. It uses Community Care of Oklahoma. Mid-America Christian is\n\na self-insured university on a church plan that is not subject to ERISA. It uses plans\n\nprovided by GuideStone Financial Resources.14\n\n\n\n       14\n         The descriptions of Mid-America Christian’s insurance arrangements in the\nrecord before us are inconsistent. Before the district court, counsel described Mid-\nAmerica Christian’s plan as “insured by GuideStone,” App. in SN at A32, and suggested\nit would be obligated, like Oklahoma Baptist and Oklahoma Wesleyan, to deliver the\nForm to its health insurance issuer to opt out of the Mandate. In its opening brief on\nappeal, counsel described Mid-America Christian’s plan as “self-insured,” and suggested\nit would be obligated, like Southern Nazarene, to deliver the Form to its TPA. SN Br. at\n2, 18. In a supplemental brief and at oral argument, counsel now indicates Mid-America\nChristian has a self-insured church plan and is more akin to the Reaching Souls plaintiffs.\nSN Supp. Br. II at 9 n.2; Oral Arg. in SN at 20:24-20:32.\n       We treat Mid-America Christian’s plan as a self-insured church plan. The parties\nin Southern Nazarene stipulated as fact that Mid-America Christian’s group health plan is\nprovided by GuideStone Financial Resources. Southern Nazarene, 2013 WL 6804265, at\n*2. Because we understand GuideStone Financial Resources to be a sponsor of self-\ninsured church plans and not an insurer, we assume the latest characterization on appeal\n                                                                              Continued . . .\n                                           - 20 -\n\f       The universities have brought suit collectively, but they are in slightly different\n\npositions insofar as Mid-America Christian University uses a church plan and contracts\n\nwith a TPA, Oklahoma Baptist University and Oklahoma Wesleyan use health insurance\n\nissuers, and Southern Nazarene contracts with a TPA but uses a health insurance issuer\n\nfor student coverage and employee claims above $100,000.\n\n       The universities believe “it would be sinful and immoral for them to participate in,\n\npay for, facilitate, enable, or otherwise support access to abortion, abortion-inducing\n\ndrugs and devices, and related counseling.” SN Br. at 1-2. They object to the provision\n\nof contraceptives they consider abortifacients. The universities currently offer health\n\nplans to students and employees that do not cover the contraceptives the universities find\n\nobjectionable.\n\n       The universities are subject to the Mandate, but they may take advantage of the\n\naccommodation scheme by delivering the Form or notifying HHS of their religious\n\nobjections to relieve themselves of the obligation to provide contraceptive coverage.\n\nThey object to the accommodation, however, because they believe it requires them to\n\nexpressly or functionally offer contraceptive coverage through their group health plan,\n\ninterferes with the spiritual development of their communities, and requires them to\n\nfacilitate behavior they consider sinful. If they do not take advantage of the\n\n______________________________________\nCont.\n\nis correct and treat Mid-America Christian’s group health plan as a self-insured church\nplan that is not subject to ERISA.\n\n                                            - 21 -\n\faccommodation, each university must either provide coverage or incur penalties of $100\n\nper employee per day.\n\n3. Reaching Souls\n\n       Reaching Souls is a non-profit corporation founded by a Southern Baptist minister\n\nand based in Oklahoma. The organization trains pastors and evangelists and provides\n\ncare to orphans in Africa, India, and Cuba. Truett-McConnell College is a private liberal\n\narts college based in Georgia. Both Reaching Souls and Truett-McConnell use the\n\nGuideStone Plan, a self-insured church plan that is not subject to ERISA. GuideStone\n\nFinancial Resources, a Texas non-profit corporation, established the GuideStone Plan and\n\nholds the assets funding it in trust. GuideStone Financial Resources has entered into\n\nagreements with other entities to provide claims administration as TPAs under the\n\nGuideStone Plan, including Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, Highmark\n\nHealth Services, and Express Scripts, Inc.\n\n       Reaching Souls believes life begins at conception and objects to four of the twenty\n\nFDA-approved methods of contraception that Reaching Souls characterizes as\n\nabortifacients. Truett-McConnell has adopted the Southern Baptist Convention’s\n\nstatement of faith and objects to the same four methods of contraception. GuideStone\n\nFinancial Resources, as an arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, also opposes\n\ncoverage of contraception methods it believes to be abortifacients. The organizations\n\nground their beliefs in the sanctity of human life and opposition to elective abortion in the\n\nreligious teachings of the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\n                                             - 22 -\n\f       Both Reaching Souls and Truett-McConnell College are subject to the Mandate,\n\nbut they may take advantage of the accommodation scheme by delivering the Form or\n\nnotifying HHS of their religious objections. If they do, GuideStone Financial Resources\n\nwould have to pass the information to the TPAs of the GuideStone Plan to effectuate the\n\ncoverage. The plaintiffs believe this would violate their religious beliefs “by making\n\nthem complicit in the government’s scheme to provide abortifacients.” RS Br. at 4. If\n\nthe organizations do not take advantage of the accommodation scheme or provide\n\ncoverage, they contend they will incur millions of dollars in fines, which “would crush\n\nthe ministries and force a mass exodus from GuideStone.” RS Br. at 3.\n\n                                 C. Procedural History\n\n       The district courts reached different results in the three cases before us, denying a\n\npreliminary injunction to the plaintiffs in Little Sisters but granting a preliminary\n\ninjunction to the plaintiffs in Southern Nazarene and Reaching Souls. Reviewing the\n\nreasoning behind their determinations clarifies the claims before us on appeal.\n\n1. Little Sisters of the Poor\n\n       In Little Sisters, the district court determined that complying with the\n\naccommodation scheme would not impose a substantial burden on the Little Sisters’ or\n\nChristian Brothers’ religious exercise. 6 F. Supp. 3d at 1239-45. The court’s analysis of\n\nthe preliminary injunction factors began and ended by examining whether the plaintiffs\n\nwould suffer irreparable injury if the requested relief were denied. Id. at 1236. After\n\ndetermining it was the court’s duty to determine how the regulations operate as a matter\n\n                                            - 23 -\n\fof law, id. at 1239, the court concluded the accommodation scheme does not require the\n\nLittle Sisters to provide contraceptive coverage or to participate in the provision of\n\ncontraceptive coverage, id. at 1239-42.\n\n       The court noted that the Little Sisters—unlike the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby—\n\ncould be relieved of the obligation to provide coverage by signing and delivering the\n\nForm to their TPA, the Christian Brothers. Id. at 1237.15 The court underscored that,\n\nwhile the Departments could require the Little Sisters to sign and deliver the Form to\n\ntheir TPA to avoid the Mandate, the Departments lacked enforcement authority under\n\nERISA to levy fines or otherwise force the Christian Brothers to provide contraceptive\n\ncoverage as the TPA for a self-insured, ERISA-exempt church plan. Id. at 1243-44. The\n\ncourt concluded that requiring the Little Sisters to sign and deliver the Form to opt out\n\ndid not constitute a substantial burden on their religious exercise and declined to issue a\n\npreliminary injunction. Id. at 1242-45.\n\n       The Little Sisters next asked the Tenth Circuit for an injunction pending appeal,\n\nwhich this court denied. The Supreme Court subsequently granted their request for an\n\ninjunction pending appeal, allowing the Little Sisters to notify HHS of their religious\n\nobjection instead of sending the Form to their TPA as the regulations at the time required.\n\n       15\n          At the time the district courts decided all three of the cases before us, the interim\nfinal rules allowing Plaintiffs to opt out by notifying HHS of their religious objection had\nnot yet been issued. The district court decisions therefore focus on the Form and do not\nconsider the expanded accommodation scheme in August 2014’s interim final rules. In\nsupplemental briefing to this court, the Plaintiffs argue the expanded scheme does not\nadequately address the religious liberty concerns they have raised in this litigation.\n\n\n                                            - 24 -\n\fSee Little Sisters, 134 S. Ct. 1022. The Little Sisters now appeal the district court’s\n\ndenial of a preliminary injunction.\n\n2. Southern Nazarene\n\n       In Southern Nazarene, the district court granted a preliminary injunction to the\n\nplaintiffs. 2013 WL 6804265, at *11. The court’s analysis focused mainly on the\n\nplaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits.16 Id. at *7-10. The court characterized the\n\nForm as “in effect, a permission slip which must be signed by the institution to enable the\n\nplan beneficiary to get access, free of charge, from the institution’s insurer or third party\n\nadministrator, to the products to which the institution objects.” Id. at *8. It determined\n\nthe Form imposed a substantial burden on the plaintiffs’ sincere religious exercise and the\n\nGovernment had not articulated a compelling state interest or argued its approach was the\n\nleast restrictive means of advancing that interest. Id. at *7-10.\n\n\n\n\n       16\n           The district court noted that, unlike in the recently decided Priests for Life, 7 F.\nSupp. 3d 88, the parties in Southern Nazarene “stipulated that the act of signing the\ncertification is contrary to the religious beliefs to which these institutions subscribe.”\nSouthern Nazarene, 2013 WL 6804265, at *8. The court’s characterization paraphrases\nthe stipulation, which addresses only the litigation position taken by the Southern\nNazarene plaintiffs. The parties specifically stipulated: “The Universities believe that,\nwithin the operation of the regulations, completing and delivering the self-certification to\ntheir issuers or third party administrators would violate the Universities’ sincere religious\nbeliefs.” Id. at *5. The Government accepts that the Southern Nazarene plaintiffs take\nthe position that completing the self-certification would violate their religious beliefs—a\nfairly straightforward characterization of their litigation position—but has never\nconceded that completing the self-certification actually would violate their religious\nbeliefs.\n\n\n                                             - 25 -\n\f       The court concluded the plaintiffs had shown they were likely to succeed on the\n\nmerits. Id. After reaching this conclusion, it briefly reviewed the other preliminary\n\ninjunction factors and entered a preliminary injunction that prevented the Departments\n\nfrom enforcing the Mandate, requiring self-certification to opt out, or levying penalties.\n\nId. at *10-11. The Government now appeals the district court’s ruling.\n\n3. Reaching Souls\n\n       Like the district court in Southern Nazarene, the district court in Reaching Souls\n\ngranted a preliminary injunction to the plaintiffs. 2013 WL 6804259, at *8. The court\n\nprimarily analyzed the likelihood of plaintiffs’ success on the merits. Id. at *6-8. It\n\ncharacterized the Government’s substantial burden argument as “simply another variation\n\nof a proposition rejected by the court of appeals in Hobby Lobby,” likening it to the\n\nargument that the Mandate was not a substantial burden on for-profit employers because\n\nit required intervening acts by third parties—employees deciding whether to acquire\n\ncontraception. Id. at *7. It emphasized that regardless of whether the Form actually\n\ntriggers the provision of contraceptive services, the plaintiffs believe that signing it would\n\nsignal their tacit support or cooperation. Id.\n\n       The court thus determined “the accommodation scheme applies substantial\n\npressure on Plaintiffs to violate their belief that participating in or facilitating the\n\naccommodation is the moral equivalent of directly complying with the contraceptive\n\nmandate.” Id. at *8. It briefly reviewed the other preliminary injunction factors and\n\nenjoined the Government from requiring the plaintiffs to comply with the Mandate and\n\n                                              - 26 -\n\faccommodation scheme or penalizing the plaintiffs for noncompliance. Id. The\n\nGovernment now appeals the district court’s ruling.\n\n                IV. UNUSUAL NATURE OF PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIM\n\n       Before we present our analysis of the issues, we wish to highlight the unusual\n\nnature of Plaintiffs’ central claim, which attacks the Government’s attempt to\n\naccommodate religious exercise by providing a means to opt out of compliance with a\n\ngenerally applicable law.\n\n       Most religious liberty claimants allege that a generally applicable law or policy\n\nwithout a religious exception burdens religious exercise, and they ask courts to strike\n\ndown the law or policy or excuse them from compliance. Our circuit’s three most recent\n\nRFRA cases fall into this category. In Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d\n\n1114 (10th Cir. 2013) (en banc), aff’d sub nom. Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. 2751, the ACA\n\nrequired the plaintiffs to provide their employees with health insurance coverage of\n\ncontraceptives against their religious beliefs. In Yellowbear v. Lampert, 741 F.3d 48\n\n(10th Cir. 2014), a prison policy denied the plaintiff access to a sweat lodge, where he\n\nwished to exercise his Native American religion. In Abdulhaseeb v. Calbone, 600 F.3d\n\n1301 (10th Cir. 2010), a prison policy denied the plaintiff a halal diet, which is necessary\n\nto his Muslim religious exercise. In each instance, the law or policy failed to provide an\n\nexemption or accommodation to the plaintiff(s).\n\n       The Supreme Court’s recent ruling in Holt v. Hobbs, 135 S. Ct. 853 (2015), which\n\nconcerned a prison ban on inmates’ growing beards, is another recent example of the\n\n                                           - 27 -\n\fmore common RFRA claim. The plaintiff in Holt sought to grow a beard in accordance\n\nwith his Muslim faith. In Holt, like in Hobby Lobby, the government defendants insisted\n\non a complete restriction and did not attempt to accommodate the plaintiff’s religious\n\nexercise. The plaintiff in Holt proposed a compromise—he would be allowed to grow\n\nonly a half-inch beard—which the prison refused. 135 S. Ct. at 861. The Court\n\nultimately approved this compromise in its ruling. Id. at 867.\n\n       In the cases before us, by contrast, the Departments have developed a religious\n\naccommodation rather than leaving it for the courts to fashion judicial relief. Plaintiffs\n\nnot only challenge a law that requires them to provide contraceptive coverage against\n\ntheir religious beliefs, they challenge the exception that the law affords to them. The\n\nprecedents Plaintiffs cite are instructive in some respects, but none of them involve a\n\nsituation where the government offers religious objectors an accommodation.17 The\n\nSupreme Court and this circuit have suggested such accommodations might have\n\neliminated or lessened burdens we otherwise deemed substantial. See, e.g., Hobby\n\nLobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2759 (observing the accommodation scheme “constitutes an\n\n       17\n          The accommodation adds an additional consideration that makes this unlike the\ntypical RFRA case. In Hobby Lobby, Yellowbear, Abdulhaseeb, and Holt, the\ngovernment either required or prohibited acts of religious significance to the plaintiffs. In\nthe cases before us, the government has freed Plaintiffs from the responsibility to perform\nthe act they consider religiously objectionable—namely, providing contraceptive\ncoverage. Nonetheless, the Plaintiffs argue an act they do not consider objectionable in\nitself—completing a form or writing to HHS—becomes objectionable because it either\ncauses the provision of contraceptive coverage or renders them complicit in the provision\nof contraceptive coverage. Therefore, unlike the aforementioned cases, we are in the\nslightly different position of considering whether an otherwise unobjectionable act,\nunderstood in context, constitutes a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise.\n\n                                           - 28 -\n\falternative that achieves all of the Government’s aims while providing greater respect for\n\nreligious liberty”); Yellowbear, 741 F.3d at 56 (underscoring that the case “isn’t a\n\nsituation where the claimant is left with some degree of choice in the matter and we have\n\nto inquire into the degree of the government’s coercive influence on that choice”). Until\n\nnow, however, we have not squarely considered a RFRA challenge to a religious\n\naccommodation.\n\n       The closest Tenth Circuit case we have found is United States v. Friday, 525 F.3d\n\n938 (10th Cir. 2008), in which defendant Winslow Friday argued his conviction for\n\nshooting a bald eagle without a permit violated RFRA because he shot the eagle for use\n\nin a tribal religious ceremony. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act forbids killing\n\na bald eagle, but an applicant can obtain a permit to “take” a live eagle for a religious\n\nceremony. See 16 U.S.C. §§ 668, 668a. We recognized the potential question of\n\n“whether it substantially burdens Mr. Friday’s religion to require him to obtain a permit\n\nin advance of taking an eagle.” Friday, 525 F.3d at 947. We said we were “skeptical that\n\nthe bare requirement of obtaining a permit can be regarded as a ‘substantial burden’\n\nunder RFRA,” id., but Mr. Friday did not make that specific argument, and we decided\n\nthe permit accommodation otherwise met RFRA’s strict scrutiny element, id. at 948.\n\n       We spoke favorably of the government’s accommodation scheme in Friday, even\n\nthough “[t]hat accommodation may be more burdensome than the [religious objectors]\n\nwould prefer, and may sometimes subordinate their interests to other policies not of their\n\nchoosing.” Id. at 960. As we noted in conclusion: “Law accommodates religion; it\n\n                                            - 29 -\n\fcannot wholly exempt religion from the reach of the law.” Id. We therefore turn to\n\nuncharted Tenth Circuit terrain.\n\n                                         * * * *\n\n       The Plaintiffs in the three cases before us assert claims against the Mandate and\n\naccommodation scheme under RFRA and the First Amendment’s Free Exercise,\n\nEstablishment, and Free Speech Clauses.18 Because we determine the accommodation\n\nscheme relieves Plaintiffs from complying with the Mandate and does not substantially\n\nburden their religious exercise under RFRA or infringe upon their First Amendment\n\nrights, we affirm the district court’s denial of a preliminary injunction to the plaintiffs in\n\nLittle Sisters and reverse the district courts’ grants of a preliminary injunction to the\n\nplaintiffs in Southern Nazarene and Reaching Souls.\n\n                                         V. RFRA\n\n       Under RFRA, the government “shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise\n\nof religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability” unless “it\n\ndemonstrates that application of the burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance of a\n\ncompelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that\n\ncompelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue the ACA and its implementing regulations violate RFRA because\n\n\n       18\n          We refer to “Plaintiffs” throughout the discussion, but in the First Amendment\ncontext, “Plaintiffs” refers only to the plaintiffs in Little Sisters and Reaching Souls. See\ninfra note 51.\n\n\n                                             - 30 -\n\fthey substantially burden their religious exercise by forcing them to do one of three\n\nthings: (a) comply with the Mandate and provide contraceptive coverage, (b) take\n\nadvantage of the accommodation scheme, or (c) pay steep fines for non-compliance.19\n\nWe conclude that the accommodation scheme relieves Plaintiffs of complying with the\n\nMandate or paying fines and does not impose a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ religious\n\nexercise for the purposes of RFRA.\n\n       To explain why the accommodation is permissible under RFRA, we first review\n\nthe RFRA framework and consider how religious accommodations may lessen or\n\neliminate the substantiality of a burden on religious exercise. We then apply this\n\nframework to the accommodation scheme before us, which exempts religious non-profits\n\n\n       19\n          The Government identifies a fourth option: by declining to sponsor a group\nhealth plan, Plaintiffs could avoid complying with the Mandate, using the\naccommodation, or paying the fines. The Government frames the Plaintiffs’ provision of\nhealth insurance as an economic expenditure, and notes that regulations may make a\nbusiness activity more expensive or onerous without violating the freedom of religion.\nSee Tony & Susan Alamo Found. v. Sec. of Labor, 471 U.S. 290, 303-05 (1985);\nBraunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 605-06 (1961); but see Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at\n2777. Plaintiffs respond that they consider the provision of health insurance a religious\nobligation, not merely an economic expenditure. Plaintiffs “believe they have a religious\nobligation to care for the employees who join in their ministry, and they cannot throw\nthose people off their insurance policies without violating that obligation and harming\ntheir ministry.” LS Reply Br. at 8.\n        Because we determine the accommodation scheme is not a substantial burden, we\nneed not decide whether this fourth option constitutes a substantial burden on religious\nexercise—or, if it does, whether it survives strict scrutiny.\n        For similar reasons, we need not address the safe harbor provision detailed in the\nJune 2013 regulations, which indicates organizations with self-insured group health plans\nthat bring administration of their plans in-house and thereby do not use third-party\nadministrators currently are not subject to enforcement of the contraceptive coverage\nrequirement. 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,880-81.\n\n                                           - 31 -\n\ffrom providing contraceptive coverage and instead assigns that task to health insurance\n\nissuers and TPAs.\n\n       We conclude the accommodation does not substantially burden Plaintiffs’\n\nreligious exercise. The accommodation relieves Plaintiffs from complying with the\n\nMandate and guarantees they will not have to provide, pay for, or facilitate contraceptive\n\ncoverage. Plaintiffs do not “trigger” or otherwise cause contraceptive coverage because\n\nfederal law, not the act of opting out, entitles plan participants and beneficiaries to\n\ncoverage. Although Plaintiffs allege the administrative tasks required to opt out of the\n\nMandate make them complicit in the overall delivery scheme, opting out instead relieves\n\nthem from complicity. Furthermore, these de minimis administrative tasks do not\n\nsubstantially burden religious exercise for the purposes of RFRA.\n\n       The dissent parts ways with our majority opinion on the self-insured plaintiffs’\n\nRFRA claims. It stresses that, by opting out, the self-insured plaintiffs would cause the\n\nlegal responsibility to provide contraceptive coverage to shift to their TPAs.20 We agree.\n\nAs we observe below, the regulations are clear on that point.21 But shifting legal\n\n\n       20\n         Plaintiffs make causation the centerpiece of their RFRA claim. They allege that\nopting out of the Mandate would cause or make them complicit in providing\ncontraceptive coverage, and thus substantially burdens their religious exercise. Much of\nour opinion assesses and ultimately rejects the merits of this claim.\n       21\n          Indeed, this is an unremarkable feature of the accommodation scheme. An opt\nout religious accommodation typically contemplates that a non-objector will replace the\nreligious objector and take over any legal responsibilities.\n\n\n\n                                            - 32 -\n\fresponsibility to provide coverage away from the plaintiffs relieves rather than burdens\n\ntheir religious exercise. The ACA and its implementing regulations entitle plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries to coverage whether or not the plaintiffs opt out. And the\n\ngovernment has established a scheme where, if the law is followed, self-insured plaintiffs\n\nthat opt out are relieved of providing, paying for, and facilitating coverage; the\n\ngovernment assigns that responsibility to their TPAs; and plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries receive the coverage to which they are entitled by federal law. Such an\n\narrangement is among the common and permissible methods of religious accommodation\n\nin a pluralist society, and does not constitute a substantial burden under RFRA.\n\n                                 A. Legal Background\n\n1. Standard of Review\n\n       Each appeal before us seeks review of a district court order granting or denying a\n\npreliminary injunction. We review orders granting or denying a preliminary injunction\n\nfor abuse of discretion. See Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1128; Aid for Women v. Foulston,\n\n441 F.3d 1101, 1115 (10th Cir. 2006).\n\n       A preliminary injunction may be granted if the party seeking it shows: “(1) a\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits; (2) a likely threat of irreparable harm to the movant;\n\n(3) the harm alleged by the movant outweighs any harm to the non-moving party; and (4)\n\nan injunction is in the public interest.” Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1128. A district court\n\nabuses its discretion by granting or denying a preliminary injunction based on an error of\n\nlaw. See id.; Aid for Women, 441 F.3d at 1115.\n\n                                            - 33 -\n\f2. RFRA and Free Exercise\n\n       RFRA was enacted in 1993 in response to Employment Division, Department of\n\nHuman Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), in which the Supreme Court\n\nheld that burdens on religious exercise are constitutional under the Free Exercise Clause\n\nif they result from a neutral law of general application and have a rational basis. Id. at\n\n878-80; United States v. Hardman, 297 F.3d 1116, 1126 (10th Cir. 2002). Congress\n\nenacted RFRA to restore the pre-Smith standard, which permitted legal burdens on an\n\nindividual’s religious exercise only if the government could show a compelling need to\n\napply the law to that person and that the law did so in the least restrictive way. Smith,\n\n494 U.S. at 882-84; see also Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2792-93 (Ginsburg, J.,\n\ndissenting). Congress specified the purpose of RFRA was to restore this compelling\n\ninterest test as it had been recognized in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963), and\n\nWisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972). See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(b)(1).\n\n       By restoring the pre-Smith compelling interest standard, Congress did not express\n\nany intent to alter other aspects of Free Exercise jurisprudence. See id.; Hobby Lobby,\n\n723 F.3d at 1133 (“Congress, through RFRA, intended to bring Free Exercise\n\njurisprudence back to the test established before Smith. There is no indication Congress\n\nmeant to alter any other aspect of pre-Smith jurisprudence . . . .”). Notably, pre-Smith\n\njurisprudence allowed the government “wide latitude” to administer large administrative\n\nprograms, and rejected the imposition of strict scrutiny in that context. As the Supreme\n\nCourt indicated in Bowen v. Roy,\n\n                                            - 34 -\n\f       In the enforcement of a facially neutral and uniformly applicable\n       requirement for the administration of welfare programs reaching many\n       millions of people, the Government is entitled to wide latitude. The\n       Government should not be put to the strict test applied by the District\n       Court; that standard required the Government to justify enforcement of the\n       use of Social Security number requirement as the least restrictive means of\n       accomplishing a compelling state interest.\n\n476 U.S. 693, 707 (1986). As we discuss at greater length below, the pre-Smith standards\n\nrestored by RFRA permitted the Government to impose de minimis administrative\n\nburdens on religious actors without running afoul of religious liberty guarantees.\n\n3. Elements of RFRA Analysis\n\n       RFRA analysis follows a burden-shifting framework. “[A] plaintiff establishes a\n\nprima facie claim under RFRA by proving the following three elements: (1) a substantial\n\nburden imposed by the federal government on a (2) sincere (3) exercise of religion.”\n\nKikumura v. Hurley, 242 F.3d 950, 960 (10th Cir. 2001); see 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a).22\n\nThe burden then shifts to the government to demonstrate its law or policy advances “a\n\ncompelling interest implemented through the least restrictive means available.” Hobby\n\nLobby, 723 F.3d at 1142-43. The government must show that the “compelling interest\n\ntest is satisfied through application of the challenged law ‘to the person’—the particular\n\n\n       22\n          RFRA originally defined “exercise of religion” as “the exercise of religion\nunder the First Amendment to the Constitution.” In 1999, the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (“RLUIPA”) amended RFRA, and redefined “exercise of\nreligion” by reference to 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5(7)(A). 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-2(4). Section\n2000cc-5(7)(A) expanded the phrase to include “any exercise of religion, whether or not\ncompelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5(7)(A);\nsee Kikumura, 242 F.3d at 960.\n\n\n                                           - 35 -\n\fclaimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.” Id. at 1126\n\n(quotations and citation omitted). “This burden-shifting approach applies even at the\n\npreliminary injunction stage.” Id.\n\n       We have previously stated “a government act imposes a ‘substantial burden’ on\n\nreligious exercise if it: (1) requires participation in an activity prohibited by a sincerely\n\nheld religious belief, (2) prevents participation in conduct motivated by a sincerely held\n\nreligious belief, or (3) places substantial pressure on an adherent to engage in conduct\n\ncontrary to a sincerely held religious belief.” Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1125-26\n\n(quotations and alterations omitted); see also Yellowbear, 741 F.3d at 55 (applying this\n\nframework to RLUIPA); Abdulhaseeb, 600 F.3d at 1315 (same). As we discuss in the\n\nnext section, whether a law substantially burdens religious exercise in one or more of\n\nthese ways is a matter for courts—not plaintiffs—to decide.\n\n4. Courts Determine Substantial Burden\n\n       To determine whether plaintiffs have made a prima facie RFRA claim, courts do\n\nnot question “whether the petitioner . . . correctly perceived the commands of [his or her]\n\nfaith.” Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 716 (1981); see\n\nHobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1138-40. But courts do determine whether a challenged law or\n\npolicy substantially burdens plaintiffs’ religious exercise. RFRA’s statutory text and\n\nreligious liberty case law demonstrate that courts—not plaintiffs—must determine if a\n\nlaw or policy substantially burdens religious exercise.\n\n       RFRA states the federal government “shall not substantially burden a person’s\n\n                                             - 36 -\n\fexercise of religion.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a). We must “give effect . . . to every clause\n\nand word” of a statute when possible. United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538-39\n\n(1955). Drafts of RFRA prohibited the government from placing a “burden” on religious\n\nexercise. Congress added the word “substantially” before passage to clarify that only\n\nsome burdens would violate the act. 139 Cong. Rec. S14352 (daily ed. Oct. 26, 1993)\n\n(statements of Sen. Kennedy and Sen. Hatch).\n\n       We therefore consider not only whether a law or policy burdens religious exercise,\n\nbut whether that burden is substantial. If plaintiffs could assert and establish that a\n\nburden is “substantial” without any possibility of judicial scrutiny, the word “substantial”\n\nwould become wholly devoid of independent meaning. See Menasche, 348 U.S. at 538-\n\n39. Furthermore, accepting any burden alleged by Plaintiffs as “substantial” would\n\nimproperly conflate the determination that a religious belief is sincerely held with the\n\ndetermination that a law or policy substantially burdens religious exercise.\n\n       Every circuit that has addressed a RFRA challenge to the accommodation scheme\n\nat issue here has concluded that whether the government has imposed a “substantial\n\nburden” is a legal determination. See E. Tex. Baptist Univ. v. Burwell, Nos. 14-20112,\n\n14-10241, 14-40212, 14-10661, 2015 WL 3852811, at *3-5 & n.33 (5th Cir. June 22,\n\n2015); Univ. of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 786 F.3d 606, 612 (7th Cir. 2015); Geneva Coll.\n\nv. Sec’y of U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 778 F.3d 422, 436 (3d Cir. 2015);\n\nPriests for Life v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 772 F.3d 229, 247-49 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2014); Mich. Catholic Conf. & Catholic Family Servs. v. Burwell, 755 F.3d 372, 385 (6th\n\n                                            - 37 -\n\fCir. 2014), vacated and remanded, 135 S. Ct. 1914 (2015). This is consistent with our\n\ndetermination that we review de novo “what constitutes [a] substantial burden . . . and the\n\nultimate determination as to whether the RFRA has been violated.” United States v.\n\nMeyers, 95 F.3d 1475, 1482 (10th Cir. 1996); see also Yellowbear, 741 F.3d at 56\n\n(determining “a reasonable finder of fact could conclude the prison has substantially\n\nburdened Mr. Yellowbear’s religious exercise”). Thus, we “accept[] as true the factual\n\nallegations that [Plaintiffs’] beliefs are sincere and of a religious nature—but not the legal\n\nconclusion, cast as a factual allegation, that [their] religious exercise is substantially\n\nburdened.” Kaemmerling v. Lappin, 553 F.3d 669, 679 (D.C. Cir. 2008); see Mahoney v.\n\nDoe, 642 F.3d at 1112, 1121 (D.C. Cir. 2011); Henderson v. Kennedy, 253 F.3d 12, 17\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2001).23\n\n       We have cautioned that substantiality does not permit us to scrutinize the\n\n“theological merit” of a plaintiff’s religious beliefs—instead, we analyze “the intensity of\n\n\n       23\n          Plaintiffs cite Thomas to argue we must accept their belief that they cannot\nparticipate in the accommodation whether or not that belief is “acceptable, logical,\nconsistent, or comprehensible.” LS Br. at 47; RS Br. at 39 (quoting Thomas, 450 U.S. at\n714). Thomas concerned the denial of unemployment benefits to a claimant who quit his\njob because his religious beliefs prohibited him from producing armaments to be used for\nwar. Thomas prevents courts from scrutinizing the theological merit of a plaintiff’s\nsincere religious belief, but not from assessing whether a challenged law or policy\namounts to a substantial burden on religious exercise. See Hernandez v. Comm’r, 490\nU.S. 680, 699 (1989) (“It is not within the judicial ken to question the centrality of\nparticular beliefs or practices to a faith, or the validity of particular litigants’\ninterpretations of those creeds. We do, however, have doubts whether the alleged burden\nimposed by the deduction disallowance on the Scientologists’ practices is a substantial\none.” (citing Thomas, 450 U.S. at 716)).\n\n\n                                             - 38 -\n\fthe coercion applied by the government to act contrary to those beliefs.” Hobby Lobby,\n\n723 F.3d at 1137 (emphasis omitted). “Our only task is to determine whether the\n\nclaimant’s belief is sincere, and if so, whether the government has applied substantial\n\npressure on the claimant to violate that belief.” Id.24 In determining whether a law or\n\npolicy applies substantial pressure on a claimant to violate his or her beliefs, we consider\n\nhow the law or policy being challenged actually operates and affects religious exercise.\n\nSee Geneva Coll., 778 F.3d at 436 (“We may consider the nature of the action required of\n\nthe appellees, the connection between that action and the appellees’ beliefs, and the\n\nextent to which that action interferes with or otherwise affects the appellees’ exercise of\n\nreligion—all without delving into the appellees’ beliefs.”); see also 139 Cong. Rec.\n\nS14352 (daily ed. Oct. 26, 1993) (statement of Sen. Kennedy) (observing that RFRA\n\nwould not impose strict scrutiny for “governmental actions that have an incidental effect\n\non religious institutions”).\n\n       When evaluating RFRA claims, we have therefore recognized that not all burdens\n\nalleged by plaintiffs amount to substantial burdens. See Abdulhaseeb, 600 F.3d at 1321\n\n(“We are not willing to conclude, however, that every single presentation of a meal an\n\ninmate considers impermissible constitutes a substantial burden on an inmate’s religious\n\nexercise.”); Grace United Methodist Church v. City of Cheyenne, 451 F.3d 643, 654\n\n(10th Cir. 2006) (“[W]e are not persuaded by Grace United’s assertion that the Board’s\n\n       24\n          The Government does not dispute the sincerity of Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs.\nSee Little Sisters, 6 F. Supp. 3d at 1237; Southern Nazarene, 2013 WL 6804265, at *5;\nReaching Souls, 2013 WL 6804259, at *4.\n\n                                           - 39 -\n\fdenial of a zoning variance for its proposed daycare operation constitutes more than an\n\nincidental burden on religious conduct.”); Kikumura, 242 F.3d at 961 (requiring\n\nevidentiary proof from the plaintiff that an alleged burden was “substantial” and\n\nremanding to the district court). Furthermore, as we discuss in the following section, the\n\nexistence of an accommodation may affect whether a law or policy burdens religious\n\nexercise and whether that burden is substantial.\n\n5. Accommodations Can Lessen or Eliminate Burden\n\n       We finally note that accommodations function to lessen or eliminate the burden of\n\na generally applicable law. In Hobby Lobby, this court said the stark choice between\n\nproviding contraceptive coverage and paying steep fines constitutes a sufficiently\n\nsubstantial burden to warrant relief under RFRA. Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d 1114.\n\nReligious objectors are not always put to such a stark choice. When, as here, plaintiffs\n\nare offered an accommodation to a law or policy that would otherwise constitute a\n\nsubstantial burden, we must analyze whether the accommodation renders the potential\n\nburden on religious exercise insubstantial or nonexistent such that the law or policy that\n\nincludes the accommodation satisfies RFRA.\n\n       Accommodations may eliminate burdens on religious exercise or reduce those\n\nburdens to de minimis acts of administrative compliance that are not substantial for\n\nRFRA purposes. The Supreme Court recognized this point in Hobby Lobby when it\n\nsuggested an accommodation to exempt the plaintiff corporations from complying with\n\nthe Mandate could satisfy RFRA concerns. Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2782 (“At a\n\n                                           - 40 -\n\fminimum, [the accommodation] does not impinge on the plaintiffs’ religious belief that\n\nproviding insurance coverage for the contraceptives at issue here violates their religion,\n\nand it serves HHS’s stated interests equally well.”); see also id. at 2786-87 (Kennedy, J.,\n\nconcurring). The D.C. Circuit observed that “[a] burden does not rise to the level of\n\nbeing substantial when it places an inconsequential or de minimis burden on an\n\nadherent’s religious exercise.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 246 (quotations, citations, and\n\nalterations omitted). Were it otherwise, our substantial burden inquiry would become a\n\nblunt tool incapable of recognizing the meaningful difference between forcing\n\norganizations to provide or pay for contraceptives and allowing them to opt out of that\n\nrequirement. To determine whether the accommodation scheme in these cases renders\n\nthe alleged burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise nonexistent or insubstantial, we turn to\n\nthe merits of Plaintiffs’ RFRA arguments.\n\n                             B. Substantial Burden Analysis\n\n1. Plaintiffs’ RFRA Arguments\n\n       The cases before us turn on whether complying with the accommodation\n\nconstitutes a substantial burden. The Government does not dispute the sincerity of\n\nPlaintiffs’ religious belief that they may not provide, pay for, or facilitate contraceptive\n\ncoverage. The parties dispute whether the accommodation scheme substantially burdens\n\nthe Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion.\n\n       Plaintiffs oppose completing the Form or notifying HHS because they believe they\n\nare being asked to play a causal role in the delivery of contraceptive coverage and would\n\n                                            - 41 -\n\fbe complicit or perceived to be complicit in the overall contraceptive delivery scheme by\n\nvirtue of their opting out. They also allege their continuing involvement in the regulatory\n\nscheme is a substantial burden.25\n\n       The Government responds that completing the Form or notification does not\n\ninvolve Plaintiffs in the delivery of contraceptive coverage. The accommodation relieves\n\nPlaintiffs of their obligations under the Mandate, and when that occurs, federal law\n\nauthorizes and obligates a health insurance issuer or TPA to provide or arrange for the\n\ndelivery of contraceptive coverage to plan participants and beneficiaries who are entitled\n\nto that coverage under the ACA. The Government therefore argues the accommodation\n\n\n       25\n          The Little Sisters and Reaching Souls plaintiffs clarify that they “have never\nobjected to merely identifying themselves so that the government can leave them alone.”\nLS Supp. Br. II at 2 n.2; RS Supp. Br. II at 2 n.2. They have expressed satisfaction with\nthe Supreme Court’s injunctions pending appeal in Little Sisters and Wheaton College.\nLS Supp. Br. II at 1-2; RS Supp. Br. II at 2, 12; Oral Arg. in LS at 12:10-12:40. They\nnevertheless object to the recent modified accommodation promulgated by the\nDepartments—the opt out letter to HHS—both because the self-certification requires\nmore information about their group health plan than the aforementioned notice the\nSupreme Court proposed, and because of the “collateral consequences” that follow after\nthey opt out. Oral Arg. in LS at 12:10-13:53.\n       The Little Sisters and Reaching Souls plaintiffs have not convincingly explained\nhow the notice to HHS promulgated by the Departments would substantially burden their\nreligious exercise but the notice crafted by the Supreme Court does not. In Wheaton\nCollege, the Supreme Court emphasized the plaintiffs had functionally notified the\nDepartments they met the necessary requirements to obtain an accommodation, and said\n“[n]othing in this order precludes the Government from relying on this notice, to the\nextent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provision of full contraceptive coverage\nunder the Act.” 134 S. Ct. at 2807; see also Zubik, 2015 WL 3947586.\n       The Southern Nazarene plaintiffs object to affirmatively voicing a religious\nobjection, including the type of notice described in Wheaton College. See Oral Arg. in\nSN at 24:30-25:20. They appear to believe that exemption from the Mandate—like the\nexemption for religious employers—is the only proper result under RFRA.\n\n                                           - 42 -\n\fdoes not substantially burden Plaintiffs’ religious exercise as a matter of law.\n\n2. The Accommodation Scheme Eliminates Burdens on Religious Exercise\n\n       Under the accommodation scheme, the act of opting out relieves objecting\n\nreligious non-profit organizations from complying with the Mandate and excuses them\n\nfrom participating in the provision of contraceptive coverage. The Departments designed\n\nthe accommodation so that, upon receipt of the Form or a notification from the\n\ngovernment, health insurance issuers and TPAs—not the objecting religious non-profit\n\norganization—provide contraceptive coverage and ensure the organization will not be\n\nrequired to provide, pay for, or otherwise facilitate that coverage. See Mich. Catholic\n\nConf., 755 F.3d at 391. We review this feature of the accommodation scheme to show\n\nhow it eliminates burdens Plaintiffs otherwise would face, similar to the burdens the for-\n\nprofit plaintiffs faced in Hobby Lobby.\n\n       First, the regulations specify a health insurance issuer must handle contraceptive\n\ncoverage separately from the insurance provided under the religious non-profit\n\norganization’s plan.\n\n       A group health insurance issuer that receives a copy of the self-certification\n       or notification . . . must (A) Expressly exclude contraceptive coverage from\n       the group health insurance coverage provided in connection with the group\n       health plan; and (B) Provide separate payments for any contraceptive\n       services required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) for plan\n       participants and beneficiaries for so long as they remain enrolled in the\n       plan.\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 43 -\n\f45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2)(i).26\n\n       Second, after a religious non-profit organization opts out, a health insurance issuer\n\nmay not share the costs of providing contraception with the employer or employees.\n\n       With respect to payments for contraceptive services, the [health insurance]\n       issuer may not impose any cost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment,\n       coinsurance, or a deductible), or impose any premium, fee, or other charge,\n       or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible organization,\n       the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries. The issuer must\n       segregate premium revenue collected from the eligible organization from\n       the monies used to provide payments for contraceptive services.\n\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2)(ii); see also 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(c)(2)(ii); 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 2590.715-2713A(c)(2)(ii). TPAs are subject to similar requirements. See 26 C.F.R.\n\n§ 54.9815-2713AT(b)(2); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2).\n\n       Finally, a health insurance issuer or TPA must, in communicating with plan\n\nparticipants or beneficiaries, send separate notice regarding contraceptive coverage from\n\nother plan notifications and make clear the employer neither administers nor funds\n\ncontraceptive benefits. A health insurance issuer or TPA\n\n       must provide to plan participants and beneficiaries written notice of the\n       availability of separate payments for contraceptive services\n       contemporaneous with (to the extent possible), but separate from, any\n       application materials distributed in connection with enrollment (or re-\n       enrollment) in group health coverage that is effective beginning on the first\n       day of each applicable plan year. The notice must specify that the eligible\n       organization does not administer or fund contraceptive benefits, but that the\n       third party administrator or issuer, as applicable, provides separate\n\n       26\n          TPAs are not subject to this provision. Instead, a TPA that receives the Form or\na notification from the government must provide or arrange for contraceptive coverage\nfor plan participants and beneficiaries if it wishes to remain the TPA for the group health\nplan. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(b)(2); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2).\n\n                                           - 44 -\n\f       payments for contraceptive services, and must provide contact information\n       for questions and complaints.\n\n26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(d); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(d); see also 45 C.F.R.\n\n§ 147.131(d).\n\n       All of the foregoing remove the objecting religious non-profit organizations from\n\nproviding contraceptive coverage, but Plaintiffs argue these protections of their religious\n\nliberty are insufficient because they still must deliver a Form or notify HHS to opt out of\n\nthe Mandate. They contend this act substantially burdens their religious exercise because\n\nit “triggers” the provision of contraceptive coverage, makes them complicit in the larger\n\ndelivery scheme, and demands their ongoing involvement. We disagree. The\n\naccommodation relieves Plaintiffs of their statutory obligation to provide contraceptive\n\ncoverage to their plan participants and beneficiaries, and as we discuss below, taking\n\nadvantage of that accommodation is not a substantial burden on religious exercise.\n\n3. The Accommodation Scheme Does Not Impose a Substantial Burden\n\n       To explain why the accommodation scheme does not substantially burden\n\nPlaintiffs’ religious exercise, we look at the theories argued by the Plaintiffs and why\n\nthey fail.\n\n       a. Opting out does not cause contraceptive coverage.\n\n       Although the accommodation scheme frees Plaintiffs from providing, paying for,\n\nor facilitating contraceptive coverage, they contend that, by delivering the Form or\n\nnotifying HHS, they nevertheless “trigger” or cause contraceptive coverage. They do\n\nnot. As we explain below, Plaintiffs’ causation argument misconstrues the statutory and\n                                           - 45 -\n\fregulatory framework. Federal law, not the Form or notification to HHS, provides for\n\ncontraceptive coverage without cost sharing to plan participants and beneficiaries.\n\nBecause the mechanics of the accommodation scheme differ slightly for different types of\n\nplans, we examine how the regulations work for insured plans, self-insured plans, and\n\nself-insured church plans. But in each circumstance, Plaintiffs’ causation argument fails\n\nto establish any burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise.\n\n             i.   Insured Plans\n\n       The plaintiffs with insured plans deal directly with a health insurance issuer and\n\ndo not use a TPA.27 They argue the accommodation scheme levies a substantial burden\n\non their religious exercise because “insurance issuers will sell [them] plans that either (a)\n\nexpressly include abortifacients; or (b) functionally include abortifacients by guaranteeing\n\nseparate payments for them upon [their] execution and conveyance of the self-\n\ncertification to the issuer.” SN Br. at 18. We disagree.\n\n       The regulations do not burden the religious exercise of employers using insured\n\nplans. The ACA obligates both group health plans and health insurance issuers to\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage. A religious non-profit organization may comply with\n\nthe Mandate and provide coverage to its employees, opt out using the accommodation, or\n\nnot comply with the law and pay fines. But in each instance, the health insurance issuer\n\n\n       27\n         The plaintiffs with insured plans are Oklahoma Wesleyan University and\nOklahoma Baptist University. Southern Nazarene also has an insured plan for students\nand claims above $100,000.\n\n\n                                            - 46 -\n\fmust ensure the organization’s employees receive contraceptive coverage.\n\n       By delivering the Form or notifying HHS, an organization with an insured plan\n\ndoes not enable coverage—to the contrary, it simply notifies its health insurance issuer\n\nthe organization will not be providing coverage. The health insurance issuer then has an\n\nindependent and exclusive obligation to provide that coverage without cost sharing. The\n\nrelevant regulation states: “When a self-certification is provided directly to an issuer, the\n\nissuer has sole responsibility for providing such coverage in accordance with § 147.130.”\n\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(1)(i). Because the ACA obligates health insurance issuers to\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage, they must meet this obligation independently and\n\nirrespective of the notification. The self-certification does not impose any responsibility;\n\nit merely makes it the issuer’s sole responsibility rather than one shared with the group\n\nhealth plan itself.\n\n       Because federal law requires the health insurance issuer to provide coverage and\n\nthe accommodation process removes an objecting organization from participating,\n\nplaintiffs with insured plans fail to show the accommodation burdens their religious\n\nexercise. The insured plaintiffs are not burdened when they are relieved of their\n\nresponsibility and their insurers provide coverage as required by independent obligations\n\nset out in the ACA.\n\n            ii.       Self-Insured Plans\n\n       The accommodation scheme permits religious non-profit organizations with self-\n\ninsured plans to opt out by delivering the Form to their TPA or notifying HHS that they\n\n                                            - 47 -\n\fhave a religious objection and will not comply with the Mandate. When the objecting\n\norganization opts out, the TPA that administers its group health plan is responsible for\n\nproviding contraceptive coverage if it wishes to remain a TPA for the plan. In this\n\nsection, we address this self-insured arrangement. In the next section, we consider the\n\nsubset of self-insured plaintiffs having church plans over which the government lacks\n\nenforcement authority under ERISA to compel the TPA to comply with its legal\n\nobligations.\n\n                     1) Plaintiffs’ argument\n\n       The only plaintiff with a self-insured plan subject to ERISA is Southern Nazarene.\n\nSouthern Nazarene argues the accommodation scheme substantially burdens its religious\n\nexercise because the scheme requires it to “comply with the Mandate by either (a) setting\n\nup a self-insured plan that includes abortifacients; or (b) setting up a self-insured plan that\n\nfunctionally includes abortifacients by guaranteeing separate payments for them by the\n\nTPA upon the entity’s execution of the self-certification.” SN Br. at 18. Self-insured\n\nplaintiffs with ERISA-exempt church plans make similar claims.\n\n       Plaintiffs and the dissent emphasize that the TPA may arrange or provide coverage\n\nonly after a religious non-profit organization opts out.28 We consider this to be an\n\n\n       28\n          In University of Notre Dame, Judge Posner said: “By refusing to fill out the\nform Notre Dame would subject itself to penalties, but Aetna and Meritain would still be\nrequired to provide the services to the university’s students and employees.” Univ. of\nNotre Dame, 786 F.3d at 614.\n       We understand the mechanics of the accommodation to work differently. Aetna,\nas a health insurance issuer for Notre Dame’s students, would be obligated to provide\n                                                                             Continued . . .\n                                            - 48 -\n\funcontested and unremarkable feature of the accommodation scheme.29 The regulations\n\nstate that when a religious non-profit organization opts out of providing contraceptive\n\ncoverage, the TPA is notified that the organization will not administer or pay for\n\ncontraceptive coverage, and that it must provide or arrange for contraceptive coverage\n\nwithout cost sharing if it wishes to continue administering the plan. 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n2713AT(b)(2); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2). The TPA is authorized and obligated\n\nto provide the coverage guaranteed by the ACA only if the religious non-profit\n\norganization that has primary responsibility for contraceptive coverage opts out of\n\nproviding it.\n\n       Plaintiffs suggest this shift in legal responsibility for contraceptive coverage\n\nsubstantially burdens their religious exercise under RFRA. They argue their opting out\n\nwould trigger, cause, or offer a “permission slip” for the delivery of contraception by\n\nallowing their TPA to provide the coverage. Southern Nazarene, 2013 WL 6804265, at\n\n______________________________________\nCont.\n\ncontraceptive coverage under the ACA whether or not Notre Dame delivered the Form or\nnotification to HHS. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13. Meritain, a TPA, would be obligated to\nprovide contraceptive coverage only after Notre Dame delivered the Form or notification\nto HHS and opted out of the Mandate. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(b)(2); 29 C.F.R.\n§ 2590.715-2713A(b)(2).\n       29\n          Even the dissent in Wheaton College recognized that a TPA need only provide\nthe legally required contraceptive coverage when a religious non-profit organization takes\nadvantage of the accommodation scheme. As Justice Sotomayor observed, “a third-party\nadministrator bears the legal obligation to provide contraceptive coverage only upon\nreceipt of a valid self-certification.” Wheaton Coll., 134 S. Ct. at 2814 n.6 (Sotomayor,\nJ., dissenting from grant of injunction pending appeal).\n\n\n                                            - 49 -\n\f*8. We disagree.\n\n                     2) Opting out does not cause coverage\n\n       The ACA requires all group health plans to cover preventive services, including\n\ncontraception, without cost sharing. Because a group health plan must include\n\ncontraceptive coverage under the ACA, the accommodation scheme requires a TPA that\n\nadministers a self-insured religious non-profit organization’s group health plan to provide\n\ncoverage if the organization opts out. The TPA must then arrange coverage for plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries if it wishes to continue functioning as the TPA for the\n\nobjecting organization. This arrangement allows religious non-profit organizations to opt\n\nout and ensures plan participants and beneficiaries will receive the contraceptive\n\ncoverage to which they are entitled by law.\n\n       Under this framework, the plaintiffs’ argument does not identify a substantial\n\nburden on religious exercise. The opt out does not “cause” contraceptive coverage; it\n\nrelieves objectors of their coverage responsibility, at which point federal law shifts that\n\nresponsibility to a different actor. The ACA and its implementing regulations have\n\nalready required that group health plans will include contraceptive coverage and have\n\nassigned legal responsibilities to ensure such coverage will be provided when the\n\nreligious non-profit organization opts out. See Wheaton College v. Burwell, No. 14-2396,\n\n2015 WL 3988356, at *4 (7th Cir. July 1, 2015); E. Tex. Baptist Univ., 2015 WL\n\n3852811, at *5-6; Univ. of Notre Dame, 786 F.3d at 613-14; Geneva Coll., 778 F.3d at\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 50 -\n\f437-38; Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 254-55.30 This arrangement is typical of religious\n\nobjection accommodations that shift responsibility to non-objecting entities only after an\n\nobjector declines to perform a task on religious grounds.31 Although a religious non-\n\nprofit organization may opt out from providing contraceptive coverage, it cannot preclude\n\n       30\n          To the extent Plaintiffs are specifically concerned about the language on the\nForm, that concern can be alleviated by taking advantage of the expanded\naccommodation and notifying HHS in writing. Plaintiffs need not use any terms they\nconsider morally charged, like “certify,” in their letter or email to HHS.\n        We further note the notification to HHS requires self-insured plaintiffs only to\nregister their objection and identify their TPA—it does not require them to inform their\nTPA of any legal responsibilities to provide contraceptive coverage. When the opt out is\nsubmitted to HHS, the plaintiffs are relieved of their responsibilities. The government\nthen takes steps to ensure that coverage is provided—HHS notifies the Department of\nLabor of the objection, and the Department of Labor then contacts the TPA to inform it\nof its duties under the ACA.\n       31\n          Analogizing the opt out to conscientious objections to war, see, e.g., Priests for\nLife, 772 F.3d at 245-46; Univ. of Notre Dame, 786 F.3d at 623-24 (Hamilton, J.,\nconcurring), should not overshadow the diverse array of mechanisms that federal, state,\nand local governments have used to accommodate objectors. Many religious objection\nschemes require an affirmative opt out before another person is required to step in and\nassume responsibility, and may require the objector to identify a replacement in the\nprocess. See, e.g., 2015 Utah Laws Ch. 46 (accommodating religious objections to same-\nsex marriage of those working in county clerks’ offices by requiring that “[a] county\nclerk shall . . . establish policies to ensure that the county clerk, or a designee of the\ncounty clerk who is willing, is available during business hours to solemnize a legal\nmarriage for which a marriage license has been issued”); Stormans Inc. v. Selecky, 844 F.\nSupp. 2d 1172 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 22, 2012) (reinstating a “refuse and refer” approach\nwhere pharmacies need not provide contraception so long as they refer patients to\nalternative providers); Conn. Agencies Regs. § 19a-580d-9 (requiring health care\nproviders who object to implementing a do-not-resuscitate order to “turn over care of the\npatient without delay to another provider who will implement the DNR order”); Internal\nRevenue Service, Tax Guide for Churches & Religious Organizations 18 (2013),\nwww.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1828.pdf (explaining that a church may opt out of paying\nSocial Security and Medicare taxes for religious reasons, shifting that responsibility to\ntheir employees to pay those taxes as though they were self-employed).\n\n\n                                           - 51 -\n\fthe government from requiring others to provide the legally required coverage in its\n\nstead.32 In short, the framework established by federal law, not the actions of the\n\nreligious objector, ensures that plan participants and beneficiaries will receive\n\ncontraceptive coverage.33\n\n\n       32\n          Plaintiffs argue that, under the accommodation scheme, organizations with self-\ninsured plans participate in the delivery of contraceptive coverage because their TPAs\ncannot arrange for that coverage unless and until plaintiffs deliver the Form or\nnotification to HHS. We discuss above why this characterization of the accommodation\nscheme is incorrect, but we note here that this concern is specific to self-insured plans\nsubject to ERISA. Plaintiffs could avoid the situation they deem objectionable by\nemploying an insured plan, employing a self-insured church plan where the Departments\nlack authority to enforce the Mandate against their TPA, or administering the self-insured\nplan on their own in-house without using a TPA. Although the dissent notes that in-\nhouse administration is complex, Dissent at 22-23, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated it\nwould be a substantial burden under RFRA. The fact that this alternative may be more\nexpensive or difficult for plaintiffs does not necessarily make it a substantial burden. See\nBraunfeld, 366 U.S. at 605-06.\n       33\n          In this regard, the accommodation scheme here is comparable to a conscientious\nobjector accommodation scheme, which provides for someone to replace the objector\nwhen he opts out of military service. See Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 245-46; see also\nUniv. of Notre Dame, 786 F.3d at 623-24 (Hamilton, J., concurring). Indeed, the\nconscientious objector scheme is administratively more burdensome than filing the Form\nor notifying HHS to opt out of the Mandate. A conscientious objector must register in\nthe Selective Service System before being able to apply for an exemption, must complete\nan application and appear for an in-person interview, and, if the exemption is granted,\nmust perform two years of service for the government in lieu of military service. See 50\nU.S.C. § 456j.\n        The dissent points to differences between the religious accommodation here and\nthe conscientious objector scheme. But the comparison is apt. Courts have recognized\nthat, to opt out of military service for religious reasons, a conscientious objector must\nnotify the government of his objection knowing that someone else will take his place.\nSee Trans World Airlines v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63, 96 n.13 (1977) (Marshall, J.,\ndissenting) (recognizing that “the effect of excusing conscientious objectors from military\nconscription is to require a nonobjector to serve instead, yet we have repeatedly upheld\nthis exemption”); Sheridan v. United States, 483 F.2d 169, 174 (8th Cir. 1973)\n                                                                                Continued . . .\n                                            - 52 -\n\f                     3) Response to dissent\n\n       The dissent argues that our reasoning fails to appreciate the difference between\n\ninsured and self-insured plans. With insured plans, the health insurance issuer bears legal\n\nresponsibility to provide contraceptive coverage whether or not the religious non-profit\n\nhas opted out. With self-insured plans, the TPA shoulders legal responsibility for\n\ncoverage only after the religious non-profit has opted out.\n\n______________________________________\nCont.\n\n(acknowledging that when the plaintiff evaded induction, “another person had to be\ncalled in his place”); McKenzie v. Schuppener, 415 F.2d 1056, 1058 (5th Cir. 1969)\n(characterizing a conscientious objection application as “the situation where appellant\nmust go to Vietnam or someone else go in his place”). Similarly, to opt out of the\nMandate, the self-insured religious objector must notify the government knowing that a\nTPA will take its place.\n        And historically, it is not unprecedented to require an objector to identify a\nsubstitute for military service. To the contrary, the first federal draft statute permitted a\ndraftee to avoid service only by either providing a substitute or paying $300. See Act of\nMarch 3, 1863, ch. 75, § 13, 12 Stat. 731, 733 (1863). As the dissent observes, the Civil\nWar Enrollment Act sparked riots, Dissent at 14-15 n.7, but these were triggered by\nopposition to the draft itself, the inability of working class people to pay the $300\nexemption, and anxiety about freed slaves entering the labor market after the war—not\nthe fact that the draft law allowed draftees to name a substitute in their place. See Leslie\nM. Harris, In the Shadow of Slavery: African Americans in New York City, 1626-1863,\nat 279-88 (2003). Although Congress later eliminated the $300 commutation fee (except\nfor conscientious objectors), it retained the provision allowing enrollees to supply a\nsubstitute. See Act of July 4, 1864, ch. 237, §§ 2, 10, 11, 13 Stat. 379, 379-80 (1864).\nTo the extent the dissent suggests Chief Justice Taney’s thoughts on the topic are\nrelevant, Dissent at 14-15 n.7, we note that he considered conscription itself\nunconstitutional, not the substitution provision. See Leon Friedman, Conscription and\nthe Constitution: The Original Understanding, 67 Mich. L. Rev. 1493, 1546-48 (1969).\nIn fact, Chief Justice Taney paid $100 to excuse his “body servant” from the draft. See\nBernard C. Steiner, Life of Roger Brooke Taney: Chief Justice of the United States\nSupreme Court 511-12 (1922).\n\n\n                                            - 53 -\n\f       We agree this is a distinction between these types of plans, but the dissent\n\noverplays its importance. See Dissent at 5 (deeming the difference between insured and\n\nself-insured plans “the critical distinction”).34 In both contexts, the ACA requires that\n\ngroup health plans cover contraceptive services, and a plaintiff knows coverage will be\n\nprovided when it opts out. Plaintiffs do not dispute plan participants and beneficiaries’\n\nright to contraceptive coverage, nor do they contest the government’s ability to require\n\nTPAs and health insurance issuers to arrange for such coverage when a religious non-\n\nprofit organization opts out. The only question before us is whether the plaintiffs are\n\nsubstantially burdened when they notify the government of their objection with the\n\nknowledge that another party will be required to provide coverage in their stead. The\n\nanswer is no.\n\n       A religious accommodation tries to reconcile religious liberty with the rule of law.\n\nWhen faced with an unavoidable conflict between following the law or religious belief,\n\nRFRA provides a religious objector a means to challenge a generally applicable law and\n\nseek an exception to avoid following that law without having to break it. A statutory\n\naccommodation, as we have here, serves the same purpose. As noted above, this case is\n\n\n       34\n          Although the Mandate in the insured plan context assigns responsibility to\nprovide contraceptive coverage to both the religious non-profit organization and its health\ninsurance issuer, we do not believe this is the only permissible arrangement to permit\nreligious accommodation. Requiring all accommodations to follow this model would be\nduplicative, costly, and impractical, and would foreclose a wide range of pragmatic\narrangements that bring in substitutes when and only when a religious objector opts out\nof performing a task. See, e.g., supra note 31.\n\n\n                                           - 54 -\n\funusual because the Plaintiffs do not seek an accommodation where none exists, but\n\ninstead challenge a statutory accommodation and argue that the process for seeking\n\nrefuge in it substantially burdens their religious exercise. As to the self-insured plaintiffs,\n\nthe dissent contends that if they opt out and transfer their duty to provide contraceptive\n\ncoverage to the TPA, they necessarily cause such coverage. We disagree.\n\n       By opting out, the self-insured plaintiffs shift their duty to provide coverage to a\n\nTPA, but they do not change their plan participants and beneficiaries’ entitlement to\n\ncontraceptive coverage under federal law.35 The dissent suggests, however, that because\n\nthe plaintiffs can stymie coverage to their employees by breaking the law and incurring\n\nfines, and because opting out ultimately results in the TPAs’ providing coverage, the\n\nplaintiffs’ opting out therefore would cause contraceptive coverage. But this\n\nmisconstrues the purpose of religious accommodation: to permit the religious objector\n\nboth to avoid a religious burden and to comply with the law. If the plaintiffs wish to\n\navail themselves of a legal means—an accommodation—to be excused from compliance\n\n       35\n          The dissent attempts to distinguish between health plan beneficiaries’\nentitlement to coverage and their actual receipt of coverage. This distinction breaks\ndown under inspection. If a religious non-profit complies with the law by providing\ncoverage, the beneficiaries are entitled to and receive coverage. If the non-profit opts out\nas the law allows, the beneficiaries likewise are entitled to and receive coverage, they just\ndo not receive it from the non-profit. Only if the non-profit disobeys the law and refuses\neither to provide coverage or opt out would the beneficiaries not receive coverage\n(though they would still be entitled to it). If the opt out were not part of the law, the\nplaintiffs would be in the same position as the for-profits in Hobby Lobby—without a\nlegal option to avoid providing coverage. But the accommodation scheme gives the\nplaintiffs a legal avenue to avoid providing coverage as opposed to non-compliance with\nthe law with the attendant financial penalties.\n\n\n                                            - 55 -\n\fwith a law, they cannot rely on the possibility of their violating that very same law to\n\nchallenge the accommodation.\n\n       In making this argument, the dissent focuses almost exclusively on whether the\n\nplaintiffs’ opt out is a but-for cause of the TPAs’ authority to provide contraceptive\n\ncoverage.36 It does, but this approach misses the mark. Although opting out is\n\nnecessarily a but-for cause of someone else—the TPA—providing contraceptive\n\ncoverage, that is the point of an accommodation—shifting a responsibility from an\n\nobjector to a non-objector. That is how a legislative policy choice—here, to afford\n\nwomen contraceptive coverage—can be reconciled with religious objections to that\n\npolicy. We do not “den[y] the existence of any causation.” Dissent at 10. We instead\n\ncorrectly identify the effect of opting out. The effect is to shift legal responsibility from\n\nthe self-insured plaintiff to its TPA and relieve the plaintiff of the duty it considers\n\nobjectionable. The effect is not the provision of contraceptive coverage, which would be\n\nafforded under the law whether or not the plaintiff opts out.\n\n\n       36\n          Plaintiffs and the dissent characterize the self-certification as giving the TPA\n“permission” to provide contraceptive coverage. Dissent at 9. This characterization\nignores that the self-certification specifically registers an objection to providing coverage,\nrelieves the plaintiffs of their obligation to provide it, and affirmatively distances the\nplaintiffs in numerous ways from providing coverage to plan participants and\nbeneficiaries. See supra Section V.B.2. Equating the opt out to a permission slip is akin\nto “disregard[ing] the difference between a ‘No Trespassing’ sign and a welcome mat.”\nAdarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 245 (1995) (Stevens, J., dissenting).\nThe government is not compelling the plaintiffs to endorse or license something they\nconsider objectionable; instead, the government is allowing them to decline a legal\nresponsibility while requiring another party to perform it in their stead.\n\n\n                                             - 56 -\n\f       The ACA requires that either the religious non-profit organization or the TPA\n\nmust provide contraceptive coverage for a self-insured group health plan, and the\n\naccommodation must be evaluated with that provision in mind. The scheme allows the\n\nreligious non-profit organization to opt out of the responsibility of providing coverage\n\nand assigns that duty to the TPA administering the group health plan. Crucially, it does\n\nnot change or expand contraceptive coverage beyond what federal law has already\n\nguaranteed. As the Supreme Court said in Hobby Lobby, the effect of the\n\naccommodation on employees “would be precisely zero. Under that accommodation,\n\nthese women would still be entitled to all FDA-approved contraceptives without cost\n\nsharing.” 134 S. Ct. at 2760.\n\n       The government has designed the accommodation so plaintiffs that opt out are\n\nfreed from providing, paying for, or facilitating contraception, and the TPA’s\n\nresponsibility to provide coverage in their stead stems from federal law. Because this\n\narrangement does not substantially burden the plaintiffs when they comply with the law,\n\nit does not matter whether the plaintiffs could prevent plan participants and beneficiaries\n\nfrom receiving coverage by violating the law. The dissent seems to suggest the ACA and\n\nits implementing regulations give self-insured plaintiffs discretion to decide whether their\n\nemployees receive contraceptive coverage. The ACA and its implementing regulations\n\ndo not, and the plaintiffs do not contend that they do. To the contrary, federal law\n\ngenerally requires that all people must have health insurance and that all health insurance\n\nmust include preventive services, including contraceptive coverage. See 42 U.S.C.\n\n                                           - 57 -\n\f§ 300gg-13.37 And “although [the ACA] does not specifically mention third-party\n\nadministrators, they administer ‘group health plans,’ which must include coverage.\n\nNothing suggests the insurers’ or third-party administrators’ obligations would be waived\n\nif the plaintiffs refused to apply for the accommodation.” E. Tex. Baptist Univ., 2015 WL\n\n3852811, at *5 (alterations omitted). The accommodation scheme does not give plaintiffs\n\ndiscretion to thwart their employees’ right to contraceptive coverage by refusing to\n\nprovide coverage and also refusing to register their objection so the government can\n\nmake alternative arrangements to free them from providing coverage.38 Because\n\nCongress has created a federal entitlement to contraceptive coverage and formulated a\n\nframework to guarantee that coverage will be provided even if plaintiffs decline to\n\nprovide it, self-insured plaintiffs do not “cause” contraceptive coverage by exercising\n\ntheir ability to opt out.\n\n                       4) No cause of substantial burden\n\n       In sum, the self-insured plaintiffs’ causal analysis falters regarding the effect of\n\nopting out, which is to shift legal responsibility to provide contraceptive coverage from\n\n\n       37\n          The dissent asks, “if the self-insured plaintiffs do not opt out, who will provide\nthe coverage for their plan participants and beneficiaries?” Dissent at 8. The answer is\nthe self-insured plaintiffs, if they comply with the law. But this is the reason for the opt\nout: to allow the plaintiffs a legal means to avoid providing coverage.\n       38\n         In the absence of any such discretionary power or responsibility, plaintiffs are\nnot faced with the Hobson’s choice the dissent describes. Dissent at 7-8, 12, 23. To the\ncontrary, the accommodation eliminates any Hobson’s choice by allowing plaintiffs to\nopt out of providing coverage.\n\n\n                                            - 58 -\n\fplaintiffs to their TPAs. When the government establishes a scheme that anticipates\n\nreligious concerns by allowing objectors to opt out but ensuring that others will take up\n\ntheir responsibilities, plaintiffs are not substantially burdened merely because their\n\ndecision to opt out cannot prevent the responsibility from being met.\n\n       To establish a claim under RFRA, about which the dissent says little, a plaintiff\n\nmust show the government substantially burdens its sincere religious exercise. The ACA\n\nstates group health plans must cover contraception, and the regulations state that if a\n\nreligious non-profit organization opts out, that coverage will be provided by a TPA.\n\nOpting out does not cause the coverage itself; federal law does, by establishing a scheme\n\nthat permits plaintiffs to opt out of their legal responsibility while simultaneously\n\nensuring that plan participants and beneficiaries receive the coverage to which they are\n\nlegally entitled. Allowing plaintiffs to opt out is not a substantial burden under RFRA.39\n\n\n       39\n          The dissent’s theory of causation is not viable for the reasons discussed above.\nWe also fail to see how it comports with the Supreme Court’s orders in Wheaton College,\n134 S. Ct. 2806, and Zubik, 2015 WL 3947586. In Part II.B.1, the dissent objects that “a\nthird party’s legal authority (i.e. permission) to provide the coverage is wholly dependent\nupon (i.e. caused by) the self-insured non-profit opting out.” Dissent at 9. But that\nwould be equally true of the arrangement proposed in the Supreme Court’s orders in\nZubik, which enjoined the Mandate only “[i]f the applicants ensure that the Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services is in possession of all information necessary to verify\napplicants’ eligibility under 26 CFR §54.9815-2713A(a) or 29 CFR §2590.715-2713A(a)\nor 45 CFR §147.131(b) (as applicable),” 2015 WL 3947586, at *1, and Wheaton College,\nwhich enjoined the Mandate only “[i]f the applicant informs the Secretary of Health and\nHuman Services in writing that it is a nonprofit organization that holds itself out as\nreligious and has religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services,”\n134 S. Ct. at 2807. (The plaintiffs in Zubik are self-insured and use TPAs. See Geneva\nCollege, 778 F.3d at 433. Wheaton College employs various insurance arrangements, but\nuses a TPA to deliver a portion of its coverage—specifically, its prescription drug\n                                                                               Continued . . .\n                                            - 59 -\n\f            iii.   Self-Insured Church Plans\n\n       The foregoing analysis of self-insured plans applies to the subset of self-insured\n\nchurch plans. We address additional reasons here to reject the church plan plaintiffs’\n\nRFRA claims.\n\n       The plaintiffs with self-insured church plans are in a unique position.40 A TPA\n\ncannot be compelled to provide or arrange for contraceptive coverage if it administers a\n\nchurch plan under 26 U.S.C. § 414(e) that has not elected to comply with provisions of\n\nERISA under 26 U.S.C. § 410(d)—which describes the self-insured church plans in the\n\ncases before us. The Departments concede they lack authority under ERISA to force\n\nthese church plan TPAs to perform their regulatory responsibility. See 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1003(b)(2). As a result, the Government can require the plaintiffs with self-insured\n\nchurch plans to use the Form or notify HHS to register their objection and opt out, but it\n\nhas no enforcement authority to compel or penalize those plaintiffs’ TPAs if they decline\n______________________________________\nCont.\n\ncoverage. See Wheaton College v. Burwell, 50 F. Supp. 3d. 939, 944 (N.D. Ill. 2014).)\nWheaton College had already submitted a notice of its objection to the government, but\nthe Supreme Court did not limit the injunction to that factual scenario. As Justice\nSotomayor observed, “because Wheaton is materially indistinguishable from other\nnonprofits that object to the Government’s accommodation, the issuance of an injunction\nin this case will presumably entitle hundreds or thousands of other objectors to the same\nremedy.” Wheaton College, 134 S. Ct. at 2814 n.6 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).\n       40\n          The plaintiffs with self-insured church plans include the Little Sisters, Reaching\nSouls, Truett-McConnell, and Mid-America Christian. The analysis in this section also\napplies to the plaintiffs that operate or administer self-insured church plans, which\ninclude the Christian Brothers Employee Benefit Trust, Christian Brothers Services, and\nGuideStone Financial Resources.\n\n\n                                           - 60 -\n\fto provide or arrange for contraceptive coverage.41\n\n       The lack of enforcement authority makes any burden on plaintiffs with church\n\nplans even less substantial than the burden on plaintiffs with self-insured plans that are\n\nsubject to ERISA. Nonetheless, plaintiffs with church plans offer the following\n\narguments as to why the accommodation scheme might still burden their religious\n\nexercise. First, the Departments could decide to alter the regulations and assert authority\n\nover church plans under ERISA. Second, the mere act of signing the Form or delivering\n\nthe notification may involve them in the provision of contraception, either by cooperating\n\nwith the Departments or by providing authorization to a TPA, which then decides it\n\nwants to provide contraceptive coverage after all. Third, their opting out incentivizes\n\nTPAs to provide coverage even if they are exempt from ERISA. Fourth, the Government\n\nhas not demonstrated why the plaintiffs must complete the self-certification if their TPAs\n\ncan decline to provide contraceptive coverage. In addition to the reasons self-insured\n\nplans in general are not substantially burdened by the accommodation scheme, we\n\n       41\n          If TPAs for self-insured church plans decide not to provide contraceptive\ncoverage, plan participants and beneficiaries would not get the coverage to which they\nare otherwise entitled under the ACA. The dissent suggests it is paradoxical to maintain\nthe ACA ensures plan participants and beneficiaries will receive contraceptive coverage\nand also acknowledge TPAs for self-insured church plans may in fact decline to provide\nthat coverage. Dissent at 11 n.4. The positions are consistent. The ACA requires all\ngroup health plans to provide contraceptive coverage, but because it can only enforce that\nrequirement through ERISA, church plans that are exempt from ERISA do not face any\nconsequences if they fail to meet it. Put differently, the ACA creates a legal duty for all\ngroup health plans, but the Government cannot enforce that duty against a narrow subset\nof self-insured church plans. The inability to enforce that duty does not mean the duty\ndoes not exist.\n\n\n                                            - 61 -\n\fconclude the plaintiffs with self-insured church plans have failed to identify a substantial\n\nburden on religious exercise.\n\n                     1) Hypothetical regulation\n\n       The plaintiffs argue the Departments could assert authority over church plans\n\nunder ERISA at some point in the future. We assess the regulations as they currently\n\nexist, not amendments to ERISA’s implementing regulations the Department of Labor\n\nmay hypothetically promulgate. An “[i]njunction issues to prevent existing or presently\n\nthreatened injuries. One will not be granted against something merely feared as liable to\n\noccur at some indefinite time in the future.” Connecticut v. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. 660,\n\n674 (1931). Should the Departments assert ERISA authority over church plans at some\n\nlater date, plaintiffs may then seek a preliminary injunction to prevent the Departments\n\nfrom enforcing the Mandate. Unless and until the Departments change their position,\n\nhowever, plaintiffs’ speculative argument does not warrant a preliminary injunction. See\n\nCrowe & Dunlevy, P.C. v. Stidham, 640 F.3d 1140, 1157 (10th Cir. 2011).\n\n                     2) No causation from church plan TPA notification\n\n       The plaintiffs contend completing the self-certification would be a substantial\n\nburden because it would allow TPAs to provide coverage to their group health plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries, even if the Departments cannot compel the TPA to do so\n\nunder ERISA. But plaintiffs with self-insured church plans are not substantially\n\nburdened by the requirement that they complete the Form or notification to HHS. As we\n\nexplained in the previous section on self-insured plans, when a religious non-profit\n\n                                           - 62 -\n\forganization opts out of the Mandate, the requirement that the group health plan include\n\ncontraceptive coverage is a product of federal law, not the product of the organization’s\n\nopting out. Opting out frees plaintiffs from their obligation to provide contraceptive\n\ncoverage under the ACA. The lack of substantial burden is especially evident when the\n\ngroup health plan is administered by a TPA that has made clear it will not provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage on religious grounds. The Little Sisters’ TPA, for example, is\n\nChristian Brothers, their co-plaintiff in this case. It is clear Christian Brothers need not,\n\nand will not, provide contraceptive coverage if the Little Sisters opt out of the Mandate.42\n\n                     3) No incentive from church plan TPA notification\n\n       Even when TPAs for self-insured church plans indicate they may comply with the\n\nMandate, the TPAs make that decision, and the objecting religious non-profit\n\norganization is not substantially burdened. The plaintiffs in Reaching Souls argue one of\n\ntheir TPAs, Highmark, has indicated it will provide contraceptive coverage if they opt out\n\nof the Mandate. The Reaching Souls plaintiffs argue their act of opting out would not\n\nonly provide Highmark with permission to provide contraceptive coverage, but would\n\nincentivize it to do so because Highmark could then seek reimbursement from the\n\ngovernment.\n\n       Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate the reimbursement provision actually gives TPAs an\n\nincentive to provide coverage. They claim a TPA that receives the Form or a letter from\n\n       42\n          Plaintiff TPAs that administer church plans are not substantially burdened for\nsimilar reasons. In the absence of any enforcement power, the Government cannot levy\nfines against them for declining to provide contraceptive coverage.\n\n                                            - 63 -\n\fthe government “becomes eligible for government payments that will both cover the\n\nTPA’s costs and include an additional payment (equal to at least 10% of costs) for the\n\nTPA’s margin and overhead.” LS Br. at 16. At a hearing in Reaching Souls, counsel for\n\nthe Government seemed to accept this characterization. But the regulations themselves\n\nexpressly contradict this reading. They state the payment for margin and overhead goes\n\nto health insurance issuers who act as intermediaries for the reimbursement, and need not\n\ngo to TPAs.43 See 45 C.F.R. § 156.50(d)(5) (specifying health insurance issuers must\n\nreimburse TPAs for “the portion of the adjustment attributable to the total dollar amount\n\nof the payments for contraceptive services submitted by the third party administrator” but\n\nthat “[n]o such payment is required with respect to the allowance for administrative costs\n\nand margin”).\n\n      Moreover, even if TPAs were to receive a payment for margin and overhead—set\n\nat 15% of costs for 2014—plaintiffs do not demonstrate this allowance actually functions\n\nas an incentive to provide contraceptive coverage rather than repayment for the\n\nadministrative costs TPAs incur by stepping in to arrange for or provide coverage.\n\nPlaintiffs have not demonstrated the allowance for administrative overhead actually\n\n      43\n         The Departments credit the health insurance issuer for (1) the total dollar\namount of the TPA’s payments for contraceptive coverage, and (2) an allowance of at\nleast 10% for administrative costs and margin. See 45 C.F.R. § 156.50(d)(3). The health\ninsurance issuer then pays the TPA for the total dollar amount of the TPA’s payments for\ncontraceptive coverage, but is not required to pay the TPA the allowance for\nadministrative costs and margin. See 45 C.F.R. § 156.50(d)(5). As a result, the\nregulations require only that a TPA receive repayment for what it has actually spent\nproviding contraceptive coverage. A reimbursement solely for costs incurred would not\ngenerate a profit or offer any incentive to provide contraceptive coverage.\n\n                                          - 64 -\n\fgenerates a profit for TPAs, nor have they demonstrated that the allowance would\n\nincentivize TPAs to provide coverage where they otherwise would not.\n\n                     4) The Government may require affirmative objection\n\n       Plaintiffs finally argue that if the Departments lack ERISA enforcement authority\n\nagainst TPAs of self-insured church plans, the Government has no reason to require\n\nreligious non-profit organizations to comply with the accommodation scheme and deliver\n\nthe Form or notify HHS. It is the plaintiffs’ burden, however, to state a prima facie case\n\nunder RFRA. Because they cannot establish that signing the Form or notifying HHS\n\nconstitutes a substantial burden on their religious exercise, we do not question the\n\nDepartments’ interest in requiring them to opt out of the Mandate to avoid penalties for\n\nfailure to provide contraceptive coverage.44\n\n                                       * * * *\n\n       We conclude the Plaintiffs’ causation arguments do not establish a burden on their\n\nreligious exercise, much less a substantial burden, because opting out would not trigger,\n\n\n\n\n       44\n          The Departments have a sound reason to require an affirmative opt out—not all\nreligious organizations share the beliefs of the Little Sisters, Reaching Souls, Truett-\nMcConnell, and Mid-America Christian. The parties agree that the Departments can\nrequire non-objecting employers to provide contraceptive coverage under their group\nhealth plans. To enforce that general requirement, the Departments may require\nobjecting employers to affirmatively voice their objection instead of assuming all\nreligious non-profit organizations share the plaintiffs’ beliefs.\n\n\n                                           - 65 -\n\fincentivize, or otherwise cause the provision of contraceptive coverage.45 We therefore\n\nturn to Plaintiffs’ argument that the act of opting out and the administrative requirements\n\nassociated with the accommodation make them feel or appear complicit in the overall\n\ncontraceptive coverage scheme.\n\n       e. No substantial burden from complicity\n\n       The accommodation relieves Plaintiffs from providing, paying for, or facilitating\n\ncontraceptive coverage, and federal law requires health insurance issuers and TPAs to\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage when religious non-profit organizations take advantage of\n\nthe accommodation. Plaintiffs argue the act of opting out would nevertheless\n\nsubstantially burden their religious exercise because they believe delivering the Form or\n\nnotification to HHS would make them complicit in the overall scheme to deliver\n\ncontraceptive coverage. They wish to play no part in it. We find this argument\n\nunconvincing for a number of reasons.\n\n       First, the purpose and design of the accommodation scheme is to ensure that\n\nPlaintiffs are not complicit—that they do not have to provide, pay for, or facilitate\n\ncontraception. Plaintiffs’ concern that others may believe they condone the Mandate is\n\nunfounded. Opting out sends the unambiguous message that they oppose contraceptive\n\ncoverage and refuse to provide it, and does not foreclose them from objecting both to\n\n\n       45\n         Under these circumstances, as the Third Circuit observed, “the burden is not\nmerely attenuated at the outset but totally disconnected from the appellees.” Geneva\nColl., 778 F.3d at 442.\n\n\n                                           - 66 -\n\fcontraception and the Mandate in the strongest possible terms.\n\n       Second, to the extent Plaintiffs assert that completing the Form or notification\n\nviolates their religious beliefs, they state a necessary but not a sufficient predicate for a\n\nRFRA claim. Under RFRA, they must establish that completing the Form or notification\n\nsubstantially burdens their religious exercise; otherwise, this argument could be used to\n\navoid almost any legal obligation that involves a form. Plaintiffs do not object to signing\n\nforms and paperwork generally—they object to the Form or notification to HHS, and they\n\ndo so because they believe it involves them in directly or indirectly providing, paying for,\n\nor facilitating contraceptive coverage, which they oppose as a matter of religious\n\nconviction. As we have explained, the Plaintiffs misstate their role in the accommodation\n\nscheme. RFRA does not require us to defer to their erroneous view about the operation\n\nof the ACA and its implementing regulations.46\n\n\n\n       46\n          Plaintiffs cite Thomas for the proposition that we cannot question the\ntheological merit of their religious beliefs. See Thomas, 450 U.S. at 715 (“We see,\ntherefore, that Thomas drew a line, and it is not for us to say that the line he drew was an\nunreasonable one.”). We agree with that proposition, but we may—indeed, we must—\ndetermine whether the accommodation scheme substantially burdens their religious\nexercise.\n       In Thomas, Mr. Thomas believed he could not participate in the production of war\nmaterials. Id. at 709. The government argued Mr. Thomas’s beliefs did not warrant\nprotection by suggesting those beliefs were inconsistent and not shared by his co-\nreligionists. Id. at 714-15. The Supreme Court specifically rejected these attempts to\nimpeach Mr. Thomas’s religious beliefs, id. at 715-16, but the Court was not confronted\nwith the question of whether those beliefs were substantially burdened. Both the\nSupreme Court and the Tenth Circuit have indicated that accepting a plaintiff’s religious\nbelief does not foreclose an inquiry into whether religious exercise has been substantially\nburdened. See, e.g., Hernandez, 490 U.S. at 699; Kikumura, 242 F.3d at 961.\n                                                                                Continued . . .\n                                             - 67 -\n\f       Third, because the accommodation does not involve them in providing, paying for,\n\nfacilitating, or causing contraceptive coverage, Plaintiffs’ only involvement in the scheme\n\nis the act of opting out. Plaintiffs are not substantially burdened solely by the de minimis\n\nadministrative tasks this involves. All opt-out schemes require some affirmative act to\n\nfree objectors from the obligations they would otherwise face. The Plaintiffs’ logic\n\nwould undermine conscientious objection schemes that require the objection to be made,\n\nrelieve objectors of their obligations, but assign those obligations to other, non-objecting\n\nactors in their stead. See, e.g., Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437 (1971)\n\n(acknowledging a petitioner must complete an exemption application to obtain\n\n______________________________________\nCont.\n\n        The Government does not question Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs that contraception\nis sinful and they cannot be involved in providing, paying for, or facilitating\ncontraceptive coverage. But Plaintiffs go beyond Thomas when they insist that we\ncannot question whether opting out makes them complicit in providing contraceptive\ncoverage. We may properly consider that opting out excuses them from providing\ncoverage, does not cause that coverage to be extended to plan participants and\nbeneficiaries, and involves only routine administrative tasks that are not substantial\nburdens under RFRA. See Little Sisters, 6 F. Supp. 3d at 1239 (“Thus, Plaintiff’s\ncontention that the Court cannot look behind their statements about what offends their\nreligious beliefs is well-supported. However, the Court is under no such restriction with\nregard to Plaintiffs’ construction of how the Final Rules operate, including the\nadministrative burdens imposed on the parties by these regulations.”).\n        For these reasons, Thomas is inapposite when the inquiry focuses on whether a\nburden is substantial. It does not preclude courts from examining the relationship\nbetween a sincerely held religious belief and the alleged burden imposed by the\nGovernment. This important distinction prevents the Government from having to survive\nstrict scrutiny whenever a plaintiff misunderstands the burden being placed upon them—\nfor example, if Mr. Thomas had been required to produce equipment for farming and\nsincerely, but incorrectly, believed that equipment was being produced for war. See, e.g.,\nPriests for Life, 772 F.3d at 249 n.14.\n\n\n                                            - 68 -\n\fconscientious objector status in wartime); Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333 (1970)\n\n(same).47 Having to file paperwork or otherwise register a religious objection, even if one\n\ndisagrees with the ultimate aim of the law at issue, does not alone substantially burden\n\nreligious exercise.\n\n       The Government may therefore require religious objectors to complete de minimis\n\nadministrative tasks to opt out. Filing the Form or notifying HHS easily fits within this\n\ncategory. The Departments have made opting out of the Mandate at least as easy as\n\nobtaining a parade permit, filing a simple tax form, or registering to vote—in other\n\nwords, a routine, brief administrative task. The purpose of the Form or notification to\n\nHHS is to extricate Plaintiffs from their legal obligation to provide contraceptive\n\ncoverage. Opting out ensures they will play no part in the provision of contraceptive\n\ncoverage, prohibits TPAs and health insurance issuers from sharing the costs of providing\n\ncoverage with them, and requires notice to employees that they do not administer or fund\n\ncontraceptive services.\n\n\n       47\n          As other courts have observed, invalidating the accommodation scheme would\nrun contrary to many other laws allowing objectors to opt out of government programs\nand requirements. See Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 245 (deeming Plaintiffs’ argument\nagainst the accommodation scheme “extraordinary and potentially far reaching”); Univ.\nof Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 743 F.3d 547, 557 (7th Cir. 2014), vacated and remanded sub\nnom., Univ. of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 1528 (2015) (“The novelty of Notre\nDame’s claim—not for the exemption, which it has, but for the right to have it without\nhaving to ask for it—deserves emphasis. . . . What makes this case and others like it\ninvolving the contraception exemption paradoxical and virtually unprecedented is that the\nbeneficiaries of the religious exemption are claiming that the exemption process itself\nimposes a substantial burden on their religious faiths.”).\n\n\n                                           - 69 -\n\f       The notification to HHS is especially minimal, as it requires Plaintiffs only to\n\nregister their objection with HHS and does not require any contact with their health\n\ninsurance issuers or TPAs. Although Plaintiffs must tell HHS which health insurance\n\nissuer or TPA they use to opt out of the Mandate, this is not a substantial burden on\n\nreligious exercise.48 It is the kind of administrative task the Departments can require of\n\nreligious believers in the administration of governmental programs. See Priests for Life,\n\n772 F.3d at 246; Tony & Susan Alamo Found. v. Sec’y of Labor, 471 U.S. 290, 305-06\n\n(1985); see also Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. Bd. of Equaliz. of Cal., 493 U.S. 378, 395\n\n(1990); Hernandez, 490 U.S. at 696-97. When understood in light of the ACA’s\n\nrequirement that group health plans and health insurance issuers provide contraceptive\n\ncoverage and the manner in which the accommodation relieves Plaintiffs of providing\n\n\n       48\n         Plaintiffs using the Form need only enter the name of the objecting organization,\nname and title of the individual authorized to make the certification on behalf of the\norganization, and the mailing address, email address, and phone number of that\nindividual. That person signs, dates, and sends the form to their TPA or health insurance\nissuer. Employers are required to keep the Form on file for six years. The Plaintiffs have\nleeway in drafting a notification to HHS, which need only include\n\n       the name of the eligible organization and the basis on which it qualifies for\n       an accommodation; its objection based on sincerely held religious beliefs to\n       providing coverage of some or all contraceptive services (including an\n       identification of the subset of contraceptive services to which coverage the\n       eligible organization objects, if applicable); the plan name and type (i.e.,\n       whether it is a student health insurance plan within the meaning of 45 CFR\n       147.145(a) or a church plan within the meaning of ERISA section 3(33));\n       and the name and contact information for any of the plan’s third party\n       administrators and health insurance issuers.\n\n79 Fed. Reg. at 51,094-95.\n\n\n                                           - 70 -\n\fthat coverage, identifying one’s TPA in a letter to HHS is at most a minimal burden and\n\ncertainly not a substantial one.\n\n       Finally, Plaintiffs are not substantially burdened when, after they opt out and are\n\nrelieved of their obligations under the Mandate, health insurance issuers or TPAs must\n\nprovide contraception to plan participants and beneficiaries. Plaintiffs sincerely oppose\n\ncontraception, but their religious objection cannot hamstring government efforts to ensure\n\nthat plan participants and beneficiaries receive the coverage to which they are entitled\n\nunder the ACA. “Religious objectors do not suffer substantial burdens under RFRA\n\nwhere the only harm to them is that they sincerely feel aggrieved by their inability to\n\nprevent what other people would do to fulfill regulatory objectives after they opt out.”\n\nPriests for Life, 772 F.3d at 246. Pre-Smith case law and RFRA’s legislative history\n\nunderscore that religious exercise is not substantially burdened merely because the\n\nGovernment spends its money or arranges its own affairs in ways that plaintiffs find\n\nobjectionable. See Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery Protective Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439, 450-54\n\n(1988); Bowen, 476 U.S. at 699-700; Tony & Susan Alamo Found., 471 U.S. at 303; S.\n\nRep. No. 103-111, at 9 (1993), reprinted in 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1892, 1898 (“[P]re-Smith\n\ncase law makes it clear that strict scrutiny does not apply to government actions involving\n\nonly management of internal Government affairs or the use of the Government’s own\n\nproperty or resources.”). RFRA does not prevent the Government from reassigning\n\nobligations after an objector opts out simply because the objector strongly opposes the\n\nultimate goal of the generally applicable law.\n\n                                           - 71 -\n\f       Plaintiffs’ complicity argument therefore fails. Opting out would eliminate their\n\ncomplicity with the Mandate and require only routine and minimal administrative\n\npaperwork, and they are not substantially burdened by the Government’s subsequent\n\nefforts to deliver contraceptive coverage in their stead.\n\n          f. No burden from ongoing requirements\n\n       As a final argument, Plaintiffs deny the act of opting out would free them from\n\nfurther involvement in the provision of contraceptive coverage. They argue the\n\naccommodation scheme would require their ongoing participation, and give two\n\nexamples to support this claim.\n\n       First, Plaintiffs argue they would remain involved because the Departments are\n\ncommandeering their group health plans to provide contraceptive coverage to their\n\nemployees. They note their TPA or health insurance issuer can provide coverage only as\n\nlong as plan participants and beneficiaries remain employed with the religious non-profit\n\norganization.\n\n       Plaintiffs have not shown, assuming they opt out, how the provision of coverage to\n\nplan participants and beneficiaries through the health insurance issuer or TPA would\n\nsubstantially burden their religious exercise. Plaintiffs’ plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries are not guaranteed contraceptive coverage without cost sharing because they\n\nwork for the Plaintiffs; they are guaranteed contraceptive coverage under the ACA. The\n\nACA mandates health insurance that includes contraceptive coverage. See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 300gg-13(a)(4). Plaintiffs’ theory would not only relieve them of complying with the\n\n                                            - 72 -\n\fMandate, it would prevent health insurance issuers and TPAs from stepping in under the\n\nACA to provide plan participants and beneficiaries with the coverage they are entitled to\n\nreceive under federal law.\n\n       Second, Plaintiffs object that they must (a) notify their TPA or health insurance\n\nissuer when employees join or leave their broader health insurance scheme, and (b)\n\ncomplete the self-certification or notification to HHS when they create or terminate a\n\nrelationship with a TPA or health insurance issuer. As to the first requirement, employers\n\nalready must notify their TPA or health insurance issuer when they hire or fire\n\nemployees. The communication with the TPA or health insurance issuer regarding\n\ngeneral health insurance coverage for entering or exiting plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries would occur regardless of any legal obligation under the accommodation\n\nscheme. The latter requirement, however, is an obligation specific to the accommodation\n\nscheme. An insured or self-insured employer using the Form must send it to “each” TPA\n\nor health insurance issuer as the employer forms contractual relationships with them. 26\n\nC.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(b)(1)(ii); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii). If the\n\nemployer instead uses the notification process, the regulations state: “If there is a change\n\nin any of the information required to be included in the notice, the organization must\n\nprovide updated information to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.” 26 C.F.R.\n\n§ 54.9815-2713AT(b)(1)(ii)(B); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii)(B).\n\n       Once again, this does not constitute a substantial burden. The only new\n\nrequirement is that employers must complete the Form or notify HHS of their objection\n\n                                           - 73 -\n\fwhen they contract with a new health insurance issuer or TPA. Plaintiffs do not argue the\n\ntime, cost, or energy required to comply with this requirement constitutes a substantial\n\nburden; they argue it is the moral significance of their involvement which burdens their\n\nreligious exercise.49 If the first self-certification is not a substantial burden, a second or\n\nthird self-certification would not be substantially burdensome given the extremely\n\nminimal administrative requirements of the Form or notification. As we have discussed\n\nabove, de minimis administrative requirements do not themselves amount to substantial\n\nburdens on religious liberty. See Tony & Susan Alamo Found., 471 U.S. at 305-06; see\n\nalso Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, 493 U.S. at 394-95; Hernandez, 490 U.S. at 696-97. If\n\nthe actual delivery of the Form or notification is not a substantial burden, a contingent\n\nadministrative requirement to update the Form or notification is not either.\n\n       The regulations require the Plaintiffs to complete the Form or deliver the\n\nnotification if they wish to opt out. But this ministerial act to opt out is not a substantial\n\nburden on religious exercise, nor are the collateral requirements of the scheme. The\n\nDepartments have allowed Plaintiffs to opt out of a neutral and generally applicable\n\nrequirement imposed by federal law, and have done so in a manner that affirmatively\n\ndistances those organizations from the provision of contraceptive coverage that other\n\nemployers must provide. It is not a substantial burden to require organizations to provide\n\n       49\n         The interim final rules estimate “the total annual burden for preparing and\nproviding the information in the self-certification or notice to HHS will require\napproximately 50 minutes for each eligible organization with an equivalent cost burden\nof approximately $53.” 79 Fed. Reg. at 51,097.\n\n\n                                             - 74 -\n\fminimal information for administrative purposes to take advantage of that\n\naccommodation.\n\n                                    C. Strict Scrutiny\n\n       Because we determine Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a substantial burden\n\non their religious exercise, we need not address whether the Departments have shown a\n\ncompelling state interest and adopted the least restrictive means of advancing that\n\ninterest.50\n\n                                     D. Conclusion\n\n       In the absence of a substantial burden, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a strong\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits of their RFRA claim, nor have they demonstrated they\n\nwill suffer irreparable injury if an injunction is denied. Accordingly, a preliminary\n\ninjunction on RFRA grounds is inappropriate.\n\n                               VI. FIRST AMENDMENT\n\n       Although the district courts focused almost exclusively on RFRA, Plaintiffs also\n\n       50\n          We recognize third-party rights and interests are at stake in this litigation—\nnamely, that plan participants and beneficiaries are entitled by law to contraceptive\ncoverage without cost sharing. When evaluating RFRA and Free Exercise claims, courts\nproperly consider the impact of religious liberty claims on pre-existing rights holders.\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2760 (emphasizing “[t]he effect of the HHS-created\naccommodation on the women employed by Hobby Lobby and the other companies\ninvolved in these cases would be precisely zero”); see Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709,\n720 (2005); Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc., 472 U.S. 703, 709-10 (1985); Yoder, 406\nU.S. at 230; Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 409; Braunfeld, 366 U.S. at 604-05. Because we\ndetermine Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a substantial burden on their religious\nexercise, we do not reach the strict scrutiny analysis where the rights and interests of third\nparties are properly weighed.\n\n\n                                            - 75 -\n\fraised constitutional claims. They argue the accommodation scheme violates the Free\n\nExercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment by exempting religious\n\nemployers from the Mandate but requiring religious non-profit organizations to seek an\n\naccommodation.51 Plaintiffs also argue the accommodation scheme simultaneously\n\n\n\n       51\n          In this discussion of First Amendment claims, “Plaintiffs” refers only to the\nplaintiffs in Little Sisters and Reaching Souls, and not Southern Nazarene. All of the\nplaintiffs raised First Amendment claims in their complaints, but only the Little Sisters\nand Reaching Souls plaintiffs preserved these claims in their subsequent motions for a\npreliminary injunction and briefs on appeal. App. in LS at 57a-66a, 136a-38a; App. in\nRS at A65-74, A145-49.\n        The district courts in Little Sisters and Reaching Souls did not reach the First\nAmendment claims. In Little Sisters, the court found the plaintiffs’ assertion of\nirreparable harm—which they were required to show to obtain a preliminary injunction,\nsee Beltronics USA, Inc. v. Midwest Inventory Distrib., LLC, 562 F.3d 1067, 1070 (10th\nCir. 2009)—was based only on RFRA. See Little Sisters, 6 F. Supp. 3d at 1245. In\nReaching Souls, the court determined it did not need to reach First Amendment claims\nbecause it granted a preliminary injunction on RFRA grounds. See Reaching Souls, 2013\nWL 6804259, at *8 n.9.\n        On appeal, we consider the First Amendment claims in both cases. First, the Little\nSisters plaintiffs made a sufficient argument before the district court. They expressly\nsought a preliminary injunction on First Amendment as well as RFRA grounds. App. in\nLS at 136a-138a. They did not elaborate on their First Amendment claims in the\nirreparable harm analysis, but “[w]hen an alleged constitutional right is involved, most\ncourts hold that no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary.” Kikumura, 242\nF.3d at 963 (quotations omitted). Second, although we reverse the district court’s grant\nof a preliminary injunction on RFRA grounds in Reaching Souls, plaintiffs there raised\nthe question whether that preliminary injunction is appropriate on First Amendment\ngrounds. “If the district court fails to analyze the factors necessary to justify a\npreliminary injunction, this court may do so if the record is sufficiently developed.”\nWestar Energy, Inc. v. Lake, 552 F.3d 1215, 1224 (10th Cir. 2009); see also Hobby\nLobby, 723 F.3d at1145 (“The record we have is the record the parties chose to create\nbelow—it is the record they deemed sufficient for the district court to decide the\npreliminary injunction question. For each element, we believe this record suffices for us\nto resolve each of the remaining preliminary injunction factors.”). Because the First\nAmendment claims in both Little Sisters and Reaching Souls are legal questions that have\n                                                                                Continued . . .\n                                            - 76 -\n\fcompels and silences their speech in violation of the Free Speech Clause of the First\n\nAmendment. We disagree and conclude the accommodation scheme comports with the\n\nFirst Amendment. We note that the same standard of review we identified for the RFRA\n\nclaim applies to the First Amendment claims.\n\n                               A. Free Exercise Clause\n\n      Plaintiffs contend the ACA and its implementing regulations violate the Free\n\nExercise Clause by exempting some religious objectors—churches and their “integrated\n\nauxiliaries”—from the Mandate, while requiring others—specifically, religious non-\n\nprofit organizations—to comply with the Mandate, seek an accommodation, or pay\n\nsubstantial fines. They have not explained how their Free Exercise claim differs from\n\ntheir Establishment Clause claim, nor do they explain how they could prevail under the\n\nstandard in Smith if they are unlikely to succeed under RFRA. Because we conclude the\n\n\n______________________________________\nCont.\n\nbeen fully briefed on appeal, we resolve those questions in this opinion rather than\nremanding them to the district courts and prolonging this litigation.\n       By contrast, the Southern Nazarene plaintiffs included First Amendment claims in\ntheir complaint, but did not assert them in their motion for a preliminary injunction or\naccompanying memorandum of law. As a result, the district court did not reach any First\nAmendment claims in its decision. See Southern Nazarene, 2013 WL 6804265.\nMoreover, the Southern Nazarene plaintiffs do not make First Amendment claims in their\nopening brief on appeal.\n       Although we believe our First Amendment analysis applies to all group health\nplans and does not depend on whether they are insured, self-insured, or self-insured\nchurch plans, we note Little Sisters and Reaching Souls involve only self-insured church\nplans that are not subject to ERISA, and the insured and self-insured plans discussed in\nSouthern Nazarene are not before us.\n\n\n                                          - 77 -\n\fMandate and accommodation scheme are neutral and generally applicable laws, they are\n\nsubject only to rational basis review, which they survive.\n\n1. Legal Background\n\n       The First Amendment’s religion clauses state: “Congress shall make no law\n\nrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” U.S.\n\nConst. amend. 1. To resolve challenges under the Free Exercise Clause, we use a well-\n\nestablished framework. If a law is neutral and generally applicable, it does not violate the\n\nFree Exercise Clause “even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular\n\nreligious practice.” Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S.\n\n520, 531 (1993); see Smith, 494 U.S. at 878-80. “A law is neutral so long as its object is\n\nsomething other than the infringement or restriction of religious practices.” Grace\n\nUnited, 451 F.3d at 649-50. A law that is facially neutral may nevertheless fail the\n\nneutrality test if it covertly targets religious conduct for adverse treatment. Lukumi\n\nBabalu, 508 U.S. at 534.\n\n       To determine whether a law is generally applicable, we ask if the “legislature\n\ndecide[d] that the governmental interests it seeks to advance are worthy of being pursued\n\nonly against conduct with a religious motivation.” Id. at 542-43. “[A] law that is both\n\nneutral and generally applicable need only be rationally related to a legitimate\n\ngovernmental interest to survive a constitutional challenge.” Grace United, 451 F.3d at\n\n649.\n\n\n\n\n                                           - 78 -\n\f2. The Mandate and Accommodation Scheme are Neutral\n\n       The Mandate and the accommodation scheme are neutral laws. See Priests for\n\nLife, 772 F.3d at 267-69; Mich. Catholic Conf., 755 F.3d at 393-94. The Mandate is\n\nfacially neutral with regard to employers, and neither the history nor the text of the ACA\n\nand its implementing regulations suggest the Mandate was targeted at a particular religion\n\nor religious practice. Plaintiffs cannot show Congress or HHS “had as their object the\n\nsuppression of religion.” Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 542. To the contrary, the Mandate\n\narose from concerns about the personal and social costs of barriers preventing women\n\nfrom receiving preventive care, including reproductive health care. See IOM, Clinical\n\nPreventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps 102-03 (2011), available at\n\nwww.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13181. The accommodation scheme was\n\ndeveloped to facilitate the free exercise of religion, not to target religious groups or\n\nburden religious practice. To that end, the Departments expanded the religious employer\n\nexemption and religious non-profit organization accommodation to respond to the\n\nconcerns of religious groups. The Plaintiffs’ apparent dissatisfaction with the\n\naccommodation offered to them does not mean the Mandate or the accommodation\n\nscheme is non-neutral.\n\n3. The Mandate and Accommodation Scheme are Generally Applicable\n\n       The Mandate and the accommodation scheme are also generally applicable. See\n\nPriests for Life, 772 F.3d at 267-69; Mich. Catholic Conf., 755 F.3d at 393-94. Plaintiffs\n\ncannot show Congress or the Departments sought to impose the Mandate only against\n\n                                            - 79 -\n\freligious groups; to the contrary, the Mandate applies to all employers with more than\n\nfifty employees using non-grandfathered health plans.52 “The exemptions do not render\n\nthe law so under-inclusive as to belie the government’s interest in protecting public\n\nhealth and promoting women’s well-being or to suggest that disfavoring Catholic or other\n\npro-life employers was its objective.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 268. Plaintiffs fail to\n\ndemonstrate the accommodation scheme targets religious conduct or was created with the\n\nobjective of disfavoring particular faiths. Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 542-43. To the\n\ncontrary, the Mandate was enacted as part of a larger program of health care reform, and\n\nboth the exemption for religious employers and the accommodation for religious non-\n\nprofit organizations demonstrate federal deference to religious liberty concerns and were\n\npromulgated to facilitate rather than inhibit the free exercise of religion.\n\n       52\n         Smith stated that “where the State has in place a system of individual\nexemptions, it may not refuse to extend that system to cases of religious hardship without\ncompelling reason.” Smith, 494 U.S. at 884 (quotations and citation omitted). But as we\nnoted in Grace United, “we have already refused to interpret Smith as standing for the\nproposition that a secular exemption automatically creates a claim for a religious\nexemption.” Grace United, 451 F.3d at 651. We have instead held:\n\n       a system of individualized exemptions is one that gives rise to the\n       application of a subjective test. Such a system is one in which case-by-case\n       inquiries are routinely made, such that there is an individualized\n       governmental assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct that invites\n       considerations of the particular circumstances involved in the particular\n       case.\n\nAxson-Flynn v. Johnson, 356 F.3d 1277, 1297 (10th Cir. 2004) (quotations and citations\nomitted). None of the categorical exemptions enacted by the ACA and its implementing\nregulations establish a system of individualized objections. And for the reasons detailed\nabove, we believe the accommodation scheme effectively relieves objecting religious\nnon-profit organizations of their obligations.\n\n                                            - 80 -\n\f4. The Mandate and Accommodation Scheme Have a Rational Basis\n\n       Rather than make an argument based on the rational relationship standard,\n\nPlaintiffs instead contend our decision in Hobby Lobby precludes us from finding that\n\npublic health and gender equality, without greater specificity, constitute compelling\n\ngovernmental interests. But, as we have explained, the compelling interest test does not\n\napply; the rational basis test does. Grace United, 451 F.3d at 649. The Government\n\nobserves that in the cases before us, the accommodation scheme rationally serves the twin\n\ninterests of facilitating religious exercise and filling coverage gaps resulting from\n\naccommodating that religious exercise.\n\n       On rational basis review, these interests are sufficient. Alleviating governmental\n\ninterference with religious exercise, which the accommodation scheme does, is a\n\npermissible legislative purpose. Corp. of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus\n\nChrist of Latter-Day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 335 (1987). And we need not\n\nscrutinize whether the Government’s interest in public health and gender equality is more\n\ncompelling in this case than in Hobby Lobby. We need only determine that public health\n\nand gender equality are legitimate state interests. We believe they meet this more\n\npermissive standard, which is not foreclosed by our compelling interest analysis in Hobby\n\nLobby. See, e.g., Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1143 (determining public health and gender\n\nequality are too broad to satisfy the compelling interest test but noting “[w]e recognize\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 81 -\n\fthe importance of these interests”).53 The accommodation scheme advances both the free\n\nexercise of religion and the Government’s legitimate interests in public health and gender\n\nequality. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2759 (“We therefore conclude that [the\n\naccommodation] system constitutes an alternative that achieves all of the Government’s\n\naims while providing greater respect for religious liberty.”).\n\n       Furthermore, when applying the rational basis test, we are not limited to interests\n\nspecifically articulated by the Departments. We may look to any conceivable legitimate\n\ngovernmental interest, and “the burden is upon the challenging party to negative any\n\nreasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis.” Bd. of Trs. of\n\nUniv. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 367 (2001) (citations and internal quotations\n\nomitted). The more specific governmental interest in health by ensuring access to\n\ncontraception without cost sharing, which we did not specifically address in Hobby\n\nLobby, would constitute a legitimate interest conceivably advanced by the\n\naccommodation scheme. See Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1160 (Bacharach, J., concurring)\n\n(“[T]he plurality does not mention the public interest that the government had relied on at\n\n       53\n          See also Bd. of Dirs. of Rotary Int’l v.

U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 626 (1984) (“Assuring women equal access to\nsuch goods, privileges, and advantages clearly furthers compelling state interests.”);\nPrince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 165-67 (1944) (upholding child labor laws\nagainst a free exercise challenge on health and welfare grounds); Jacobson v.\nMassachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25 (1905) (upholding a mass vaccination program against a\nliberty challenge on health and welfare grounds); see also Bob Jones Univ. v. United\nStates, 461 U.S. 574, 604 (1983) (determining a compelling interest in eradicating racial\ndiscrimination “substantially outweighs whatever burden denial of tax benefits places on\npetitioners’ exercise of their religious beliefs”).\n\n                                            - 82 -\n\fthe preliminary-injunction hearing: the health reasons for promoting employee access to\n\nemergency contraceptives.”). The Departments’ recognized interest in the uniformity and\n\nease of administration of its programs would also meet this standard. See, e.g., Bowen,\n\n476 U.S. at 707; Hernandez, 490 U.S. at 682; United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 258-59\n\n(1982).\n\n       The Mandate and accommodation scheme easily pass the rational basis test.\n\nBecause the Mandate is both neutral and generally applicable and supported by a rational\n\nbasis, Plaintiffs fail to make out a plausible claim under the Free Exercise Clause.\n\n                                B. Establishment Clause\n\n       Plaintiffs contend that exempting churches and integrated auxiliaries from the\n\nMandate but requiring religious non-profit organizations to seek an accommodation\n\nviolates the Establishment Clause. We disagree. Because the Departments have chosen\n\nto distinguish between entities based on neutral, objective organizational criteria and not\n\nby denominational preference or religiosity, the distinction does not run afoul of the\n\nEstablishment Clause.\n\n1. Organizational Distinctions Well-Established in Federal Law\n\n       Federal law distinguishes between different types of religious organizations, and\n\nas we discuss below, this differentiation is constitutionally permissible. Under the ACA\n\nand its implementing regulations, a religious employer “is organized and operates as a\n\nnonprofit entity and is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (a)(3)(A)(iii) of the\n\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.” 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). The regulations\n\n                                            - 83 -\n\fat issue in this case draw on the tax code’s distinction between houses of worship and\n\nreligious non-profits, a “longstanding and familiar” distinction in federal law. Priests for\n\nLife, 772 F.3d at 238; see also Geneva Coll., 778 F.3d at 443 (determining it was\n\npermissible for the Departments to base the exemption on the IRC’s provision “because\n\nthat provision was a bright line that was already statutorily codified and frequently\n\napplied”).\n\n       Exempting churches while requiring other religious objectors to seek an\n\naccommodation is standard practice under the tax code. The IRC and other regulations\n\naward benefits to some religious organizations—typically, houses of worship—based on\n\narticulable criteria that other religious organizations do not meet. See 26 U.S.C.\n\n§ 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii). Churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or\n\nassociations of churches are automatically considered tax exempt and need not notify the\n\ngovernment they are applying for recognition, but other religious non-profit organizations\n\nmust apply for tax-exempt status if their annual gross receipts are more than $5,000. See\n\nid. § 508(a), (c)(1)(A). Similarly, churches, their integrated auxiliaries, conventions or\n\nassociations of churches, and the exclusively religious activities of any religious order\n\nneed not file tax returns, but religious non-profit organizations with gross receipts above\n\n$5,000—even if they are tax-exempt—must file annually. Id. § 6033(a). Congress has\n\nplaced special limitations on tax inquiries and examinations of churches, but not\n\nintegrated auxiliaries, church-operated schools, or religious non-profit organizations. See\n\nid. § 7611.\n\n                                            - 84 -\n\f      Congress has used similar organizational distinctions in the realm of religious\n\naccommodations. Churches and qualified church-controlled organizations that object to\n\npaying Social Security and Medicare taxes for religious reasons may opt out of paying\n\nthem by filing a form with the IRS, but other religious non-profit organizations may not.\n\nSee id. § 3121(w).\n\n2. Organizational Distinctions and Respecting the Religion Clauses\n\n      Distinctions based on organizational form enable the government to\n\nsimultaneously respect both the Free Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause and\n\npermit the construction of accommodation schemes that pass constitutional muster. The\n\nSupreme Court has concluded\n\n      [t]he general principle deducible from the First Amendment and all that has\n      been said by the Court is this: that we will not tolerate either\n      governmentally established religion or governmental interference with\n      religion. Short of those expressly proscribed governmental acts there is\n      room for play in the joints productive of a benevolent neutrality which will\n      permit religious exercise to exist without sponsorship and without\n      interference.\n\nWalz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397 U.S. 664, 669 (1970); see also Catholic\n\nCharities of Diocese of Albany v. Serio, 859 N.E.2d 459, 469 (N.Y. 2006) (observing the\n\nPlaintiffs’ argument here “would call into question any limitations placed by the\n\nLegislature on the scope of any religious exemption—and thus would discourage the\n\nLegislature from creating any such exemptions at all,” and thus concluding “[a]\n\nlegislative decision not to extend an accommodation to all kinds of religious\n\norganizations does not violate the Establishment Clause”). We recognize the\n\n                                          - 85 -\n\fGovernment enjoys some discretion in fashioning religious accommodations, and believe\n\ndoing so on the basis of organizational form comports with the Establishment Clause.\n\n3. Organizational Distinctions Compatible with Larson and Colorado Christian\n\n       The Departments have offered the accommodation to Plaintiffs based on their\n\norganizational form. Plaintiffs rely on the decisions in Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228\n\n(1982), and Colorado Christian University v. Weaver, 534 F.3d 1245 (10th Cir. 2008), to\n\nsupport their Establishment Clause claim. But those cases do not hold that distinctions\n\nbased on organizational type are impermissible.\n\n       Larson involved an Establishment Clause challenge to a Minnesota law that\n\nimposed registration and reporting requirements on religious organizations that received\n\nless than half of their contributions from members or affiliated organizations. Larson,\n\n456 U.S. at 231. The legislature drew this distinction to discriminate against particular\n\nreligions, which was evident in the legislative history. Id. at 253-54 (“[T]he history of\n\n[the challenged law] demonstrates that the provision was drafted with the explicit\n\nintention of including particular religious denominations and excluding others.”).\n\nColorado Christian differentiated institutions based on intrusive inquiries into their\n\ndegree of religiosity. 534 F.3d 1259. In Colorado Christian, we concluded Colorado’s\n\nexclusion of “pervasively sectarian” institutions from state scholarship programs violated\n\nthe First Amendment “for two reasons: the program expressly discriminates among\n\nreligions without constitutional justification, and its criteria for doing so involve\n\nunconstitutionally intrusive scrutiny of religious belief and practice.” Id. at 1250.\n\n                                             - 86 -\n\fNeither of these two concerns in Colorado Christian is applicable here.\n\n       Larson and Colorado Christian prohibit preferences based on denomination (e.g.,\n\nCatholic, Jewish, Islamic, etc.) and religiosity (e.g., pervasively sectarian, moderately\n\nsectarian, non-sectarian, etc.), but do not prohibit distinctions based on organizational\n\ntype (e.g., church, non-profit, university, etc.). As Larson noted: “The clearest command\n\nof the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination cannot be officially\n\npreferred over another.” 456 U.S. at 244. In Colorado Christian, we determined that\n\n“defendants supply no reason to think that the government may discriminate between\n\n‘types of institution’ on the basis of the nature of the religious practice these institutions\n\nare moved to engage in.” 534 F.3d at 1259. As a result, Establishment Clause\n\njurisprudence clearly indicates denominational preferences expressed by the government\n\nare subject to strict scrutiny. See id. Religiosity distinctions are subject to strict scrutiny\n\nas well because they involve the government in scrutinizing and making decisions based\n\non particular expressions of religious belief. See id. at 1256 (invalidating Colorado law\n\nbecause it “expressly discriminates among religions, allowing aid to ‘sectarian’ but not\n\n‘pervasively sectarian’ institutions, and it does so on the basis of criteria that entail\n\nintrusive governmental judgments regarding matters of religious belief and practice”).\n\n       Plaintiffs cite no case holding that organizational distinctions, as opposed to those\n\nbased on denomination or religiosity, run afoul of the Establishment Clause. Unlike\n\nAwad v. Ziriax, 670 F.3d 1111, 1128-29 (10th Cir. 2012), which concerned a state\n\nconstitutional amendment forbidding courts from considering or using Sharia law,\n\n                                             - 87 -\n\fevidence of animus or favoritism aimed at a denomination or degree of religiosity is\n\nabsent here. “Because the law’s distinction does not favor a certain denomination and\n\ndoes not cause excessive entanglement between government and religion, the framework\n\ndoes not violate the Establishment Clause.” Mich. Catholic Conf., 755 F.3d at 395; see\n\nalso Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 272-74.\n\n       Neither Larson nor Colorado Christian supports Plaintiffs’ claim that distinctions\n\nbetween churches and other religious entities is impermissible. As we concluded in\n\nColorado Christian, “if the State wishes to choose among otherwise eligible institutions,\n\nit must employ neutral, objective criteria rather than criteria that involve the evaluation of\n\ncontested religious questions and practices.” 534 F.3d at 1266. This is what the\n\nDepartments have done with the accommodation scheme in compliance with the First\n\nAmendment’s Establishment Clause.\n\n4. Plaintiffs’ Argument Based on the Departments’ Rationale\n\n       Plaintiffs seize on the Departments’ rationale for the distinction that religious non-\n\nprofit organizations are more likely than churches to employ individuals who do not\n\nshare their employers’ beliefs but are nevertheless entitled to contraceptive coverage\n\nunder the ACA. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874 (“Houses of worship and their integrated\n\nauxiliaries that object to contraceptive coverage on religious grounds are more likely than\n\nother employers to employ people of the same faith who share the same objection, and\n\nwho would therefore be less likely than other people to use contraceptive services even if\n\nsuch services were covered under their plan.”). Plaintiffs argue some denominations are\n\n                                             - 88 -\n\fless likely to carry out ministry functions through a church or integrated auxiliary than\n\nothers, and that the workforces of some non-profit institutions may be more religiously\n\nhomogenous than the workforces of some established churches.\n\n       The Departments’ rationale may not be perfectly accurate, but it does not make the\n\naccommodation scheme unconstitutional. The class of religious non-profit organizations\n\nencompasses a vast array of religiously affiliated universities, hospitals, service\n\nproviders, and charities, some of them employing thousands of people. Of course, some\n\nreligious non-profit organizations may be more likely than some churches to employ co-\n\nreligionists, but the Departments may reasonably recognize that, on the whole, churches\n\nare more likely to employ those who share their beliefs. Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 272.\n\nThe Departments originally exempted religious employers to “respect[] the unique\n\nrelationship between a house of worship and its employees in ministerial positions.” 76\n\nFed. Reg. at 46,623. We recognize that relationship between houses of worship and\n\nministerial employees has been given special solicitude under the First Amendment. See\n\nHosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. EEOC, 132 S. Ct. 694, 712-13\n\n(2012). The Departments must avoid inquiries that involve them in “excessive\n\nentanglement” between religion and government, see Colorado Christian, 534 F.3d at\n\n1261-62, and the general notion that houses of worship are more likely than religious\n\nnon-profit organizations to employ people of the same faith avoids impermissible\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 89 -\n\fscrutiny into the beliefs of religious entities and their employees.54\n\n                                        * * * *\n\n       Drawing a distinction between religious employers and religious non-profit\n\norganizations is a neutral and reasonable way for the Departments to pursue their\n\nlegitimate goals in a constitutional manner. It gives special solicitude to churches to\n\nfacilitate the liberties guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause, and offers the\n\naccommodation scheme to relieve religious non-profit organizations of their obligation to\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage under the Mandate without imposing a substantial burden\n\non their religious exercise. The accommodation scheme does not violate the\n\nEstablishment Clause.\n\n                                 C. Free Speech Clause\n\n       Plaintiffs finally contend the accommodation scheme violates the Free Speech\n\nClause of the First Amendment, which states that “Congress shall make no law . . .\n\nabridging the freedom of speech,” U.S. Const. amend. 1, by compelling them both to\n\nspeak and remain silent, see Riley v. Nat’l Fed’n of the Blind of N.C., Inc., 487 U.S. 781,\n\n796-97 (1988). First, they argue that requiring them to sign and deliver the Form or the\n\nnotification to HHS constitutes compelled speech. Second, they argue that prohibiting\n\n       54\n          The original definition of “religious employer” required that the employer\n“primarily employs persons who share its religious tenets [and] primarily serves persons\nwho share its religious tenets.” 76 Fed. Reg. at 46,623. In response to religious entities\nthat argued these requirements might involve excessive entanglement with religion, the\nDepartments eliminated three of the four criteria and based the definition solely on\norganizational form. 78 Fed. Reg. at 8459. Plaintiffs now contend that simplified\ndefinition makes unfounded assumptions about who religious employers employ.\n\n                                            - 90 -\n\fthem from influencing their TPAs’ provision of contraceptive coverage compels them to\n\nbe silent. Both arguments fail.\n\n1. Compelled Speech\n\n       The compelled speech claim fails. To the extent such a claim requires government\n\ninterference with the plaintiff’s own message, see Johanns v. Livestock Mktg. Ass’n, 544\n\nU.S. 550, 557 (2005) (stating a compelled speech claim arises when “an individual is\n\nobliged personally to express a message he disagrees with, imposed by the government”),\n\nthe regulations do not require an organization seeking an accommodation to engage in\n\nspeech it finds objectionable or would not otherwise express. The only act the\n\naccommodation scheme requires is for religious non-profit organizations with group\n\nhealth plans to sign and deliver the Form or notification expressing their religious\n\nobjection to providing contraceptive coverage. The Sixth Circuit reasoned: “Even\n\nassuming the government is compelling this speech, it is not speech that the appellants\n\ndisagree with and so cannot be the basis of a First Amendment claim.” Mich. Catholic\n\nConf., 755 F.3d at 392; see also Geneva Coll., 778 F.3d at 438-39 (“If anything, because\n\nthe appellees specifically state on the self-certification form that they object on religious\n\ngrounds to providing such coverage, it is a declaration that they will not be complicit in\n\nproviding coverage.”). Plaintiffs cannot point to speech they are required to express and\n\nfind objectionable.55\n\n\n       55\n        In Axson-Flynn, we recognized that a compelled speech claim may apply to\nnon-ideological speech. We held a University of Utah theater student had alleged a\n                                                                          Continued . . .\n                                            - 91 -\n\f       Indeed, Plaintiffs have not shown any likelihood that their sending in the Form or\n\nthe notification would convey a message of support for contraception. Plaintiffs do not\n\ndemonstrate their TPA, their health insurance issuer, or HHS—any one of which would\n\nbe the sole recipient of the Form or notification—would view it as anything other than an\n\nobjection to providing contraception. Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & Inst. Rights,\n\nInc. (“FAIR”), 547 U.S. 47 (2006), is instructive. In FAIR, a group of law schools\n\nchallenged the Solomon Amendment, a federal statute that denied federal funding to\n\nuniversities that barred military recruiters from their campuses. At that time, the military\n\ndid not permit gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals to serve. The schools claimed a\n\nFirst Amendment compelled speech violation, arguing their compliance with the\n\nSolomon Amendment would signal their agreement with this policy. The Supreme Court\n\nrejected the argument, noting compliance did not signal agreement with the military’s\n\npositions, and the Solomon Amendment did not prevent the schools from making their\n\nown position clear. FAIR, 547 U.S. at 65.\n\n       This point is even stronger in the instant case, where Plaintiffs would send the\n\nForm or notification to convey their opposition to providing contraception, and the ACA\n\nand implementing regulations do not prevent them from expressing that opposition\n\nwidely. Plaintiffs remain free to express opposition to contraception; “[n]othing in the[]\n______________________________________\nCont.\n\ncompelled speech violation because she was required to utter certain swear words as part\nof a script and objected to doing so on religious grounds. 356 F.3d at 1284 n.4.\n\n\n                                            - 92 -\n\ffinal regulations prohibits an eligible organization from expressing its opposition to the\n\nuse of contraceptives.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,880 n.41. With the passage of the interim\n\nfinal rule, Plaintiffs also have the option to send a letter or email to HHS expressly\n\nobjecting to any provision of contraception. They can fully explain their position in that\n\nnotification. We are especially unconvinced that this option, freed from the text of the\n\nForm and permitting greater self-expression, forces Plaintiffs to engage in unwanted\n\nspeech. Plaintiffs have not suggested the notification must be conveyed or\n\ncommunicated to any third parties or wider audience aside from the Departments\n\nthemselves.\n\n       Even if Plaintiffs could identify speech they disagreed with—for example,\n\nidentifying the name of their TPA or health insurance issuer—the argument that they are\n\nforced to send a message they do not wish to send is unavailing. The First Amendment\n\ndoes not—and cannot—protect organizations from having to make any and all statements\n\n“they wish to avoid.” The cases cited by Plaintiffs are not about routine administrative\n\nburdens akin to complying with the accommodation scheme. These cases instead\n\nconcern compelled ideological expression such as salutes to the flag, W. Va. State Bd. of\n\nEduc. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 634 (1943); messages on license plates, Wooley v.\n\nMaynard, 430 U.S. 705, 715 (1977), Cressman v. Thompson, 719 F.3d 1139, 1152 (10th\n\nCir. 2013); wearing school slogans, Frudden v. Pilling, 742 F.3d 1199, 1203-04 (9th Cir.\n\n2014); and taking a political stance on commercial sex, Agency for Int’l Dev. v. Alliance\n\nfor Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2321, 2331 (2013).\n\n                                            - 93 -\n\f       “Compelling an organization to send a form to a third party to claim eligibility for\n\nan exemption ‘is simply not the same as forcing a student to pledge allegiance, or forcing\n\na Jehovah’s Witness to display the motto “Live Free or Die,” and it trivializes the\n\nfreedom protected in Barnette and Wooley to suggest that it is.’” Priests for Life, 772\n\nF.3d at 271 (quoting FAIR, 547 U.S. at 62). “That would be the equivalent of entitling a\n\ntax protester to refuse on First Amendment grounds to fill out a 1099 form and mail it to\n\nthe Internal Revenue Service.” Wheaton College, 2015 WL 3988356, at *8. None of the\n\ncases cited by Plaintiffs involve compliance with the administrative requirements of a\n\ngovernment program, and especially not a government program designed to exempt and\n\ndistance an organization from activity it finds objectionable.\n\n       We finally note that Plaintiffs’ signature and delivery of the Form or notification\n\nto HHS is “plainly incidental to the . . . regulation of conduct” and thus is not protected\n\nspeech. FAIR, 547 U.S. at 62. The act of signing and delivering the Form or notification\n\nto HHS is required to opt out of the Mandate. The Supreme Court has “rejected the view\n\nthat ‘conduct can be labeled “speech” whenever the person engaging in the conduct\n\nintends thereby to express an idea.’ Instead, we have extended First Amendment\n\nprotection only to conduct that is inherently expressive.” Id. at 65-66 (quoting United\n\nStates v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376 (1968)). The fact that Plaintiffs must complete the\n\nForm or notification to HHS to opt out of coverage does not render the act inherently\n\nexpressive. See id. at 62.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we reject Plaintiffs’ compelled speech claim.\n\n                                            - 94 -\n\f2. Compelled Silence\n\n       We further reject the claim that the accommodation scheme compels Plaintiffs’\n\nsilence. Like the Sixth and Seventh Circuits, we note Plaintiffs have made only general\n\nclaims objecting to the non-interference regulation and have failed to indicate how it\n\nprecludes speech in which they wish to engage. Mich. Catholic Conf., 755 F.3d at 392-\n\n93; Univ. of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 743 F.3d 547, 561 (7th Cir. 2014), vacated and\n\nremanded sub nom., Univ. of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 1528 (2015). After the\n\nissuance of the interim final rule repealing the non-interference regulation, we do not\n\nbelieve this question is before us. We agree with the Government and the D.C. Circuit\n\nthat the repeal of the non-interference rule renders Plaintiffs’ claims regarding compelled\n\nsilence moot. See Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 242 n.8.\n\n                                  VII.   CONCLUSION\n\n       We have reviewed the district courts’ decisions to grant or deny a preliminary\n\ninjunction to Plaintiffs in the three cases before us. Because we determine the ACA and\n\nits implementing regulations do not substantially burden Plaintiffs’ religious exercise or\n\nviolate the Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights, Plaintiffs have not established a likelihood\n\nof success on the merits or a likely threat of irreparable harm as required for a\n\npreliminary injunction. See Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1128.\n\n       We therefore affirm the district court’s denial of a preliminary injunction in Little\n\nSisters, 6 F. Supp. 3d 1225, and reverse the district courts’ grant of a preliminary\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 95 -\n\finjunction in Southern Nazarene, 2013 WL 6804265, and Reaching Souls, 2013 WL\n\n6804259.\n\n                               EBSA FORM 700-- CERTIFICATION\n                                      (revised August 2014)\n\nThis form may be used to certify that the health coverage established or maintained or arranged by\nthe organization listed below qualifies for an accommodation with respect to the federal requirement\nto cover certain contraceptive services without cost sharing, pursuant to 26 CFR 54.9815-2713A, 29\nCFR 2590.715-2713A, and 45 CFR 147.131.

Burwell, Nos. 13-1540, 14-6026, 14-6028\n\nBALDOCK, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part.\n\n        Today the Court holds, among other things, that the ACA contraceptive Mandate’s\n\naccommodation scheme does not substantially burden religious non-profits that object to\n\nfacilitating contraceptive or abortifacient coverage because opting out does not cause,\n\nauthorize, or otherwise facilitate such coverage.1 The Court’s opinion provides perhaps\n\nthe most thorough explanation of the accommodation scheme’s nuanced mechanics that I\n\nhave yet read. And for argument’s sake, I follow its holding as to the insured plaintiffs’\n\nand Little Sisters plaintiffs’ RFRA claims.2 But I cannot join the Court’s holding as to\n\nthe other self-insured plaintiffs’ RFRA claims, as that holding contradicts the Court’s\n\nown reasoning and thorough explanation of the accommodation scheme.\n\n        In reality, the accommodation scheme forces the self-insured plaintiffs to perform\n\nan act that causes their beneficiaries to receive religiously objected-to coverage. The\n\nfines the government uses to compel this act thus impose a substantial burden on the self-\n\ninsured plaintiffs’ religious exercise. Moreover, less restrictive means exist to achieve\n\nthe government’s contraceptive coverage goals here. I must therefore dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    For consistency, I adopt the Court’s glossary.\n2\n   As I explain below, the Little Sisters plaintiffs, though self-insured, have not shown\nthat their opting out will necessarily cause their plan participants and beneficiaries to\nreceive contraceptive coverage. Accordingly, my use of the term “self-insured plaintiffs”\ndoes not refer to the Little Sisters unless otherwise stated.\n\f          I.     WHEN IS A BURDEN ON RELIGIOUS EXERCISE “SUBSTANTIAL?”\n\n       The first step of a RFRA claim requires plaintiffs to show (1) that the federal\n\ngovernment has imposed a substantial burden on a (2) sincere (3) exercise of religion.\n\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a). The unique threshold question we and so many other\n\ncourts are currently grappling with, however, is how to determine whether a substantial\n\nburden exists where a law compels religious adherents to perform an act they sincerely\n\noppose when this opposition might be based on a faulty understanding of the law. See,\n\ne.g., E. Tex. Baptist Univ. v. Burwell, 2015 WL 3852811, at *3 (5th Cir. June 22, 2015).\n\n       Several learned judges have argued compellingly that, under Burwell v. Hobby\n\nLobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014), the amount of coercion the government uses\n\nto force a religious adherent to perform an act she sincerely believes is inconsistent with\n\nher understanding of her religion’s requirements is the only consideration relevant to\n\nwhether a burden is “substantial” under RFRA. See, e.g., Priests For Life v. U.S. Dep’t\n\nof Health & Human Servs., No. 13-5368, slip op. at 17–22 (D.C. Cir. May 20, 2015)\n\n(Brown, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc); id. at 35 (Kavanaugh, J.,\n\ndissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc); Univ. of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 786\n\nF.3d 606, 628 (7th Cir. 2015) (Flaum, J., dissenting); Eternal Word Television Network,\n\nInc. v. Sec’y, Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 756 F.3d 1339, 1340 (11th Cir. 2014)\n\n(Pryor, J. specially concurring); see also Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d\n\n1114, 1137 (10th Cir. 2013) (“Our only task is to determine whether the claimant’s belief\n\nis sincere, and if so, whether the government has applied substantial pressure on the\n\nclaimant to violate that belief.”); cf. E.E.O.C. v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 135 S.\n\n                                             2\n\fCt. 2028, 2031–33 (2015) (analyzing a plaintiff’s exercise as a “religious practice” under\n\nTitle VII where the act was motivated by “her understanding of her religion’s\n\nrequirements”).\n\n       These judges assert that whether religious objectors properly understand the legal\n\nsignificance of the compelled act has no bearing on the substantial burden analysis. E.g.\n\nPriests For Life., No. 13-5368, slip op. at 35 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (“But what if the\n\nreligious organizations are misguided in thinking that this scheme . . . makes them\n\ncomplicit in facilitating contraception or abortion? That is not our call to make under the\n\nfirst prong of RFRA.”). And Hobby Lobby supports this position well, as questioning a\n\nreligious adherent’s understanding of the significance of a compelled action comes\n\ndangerously close to questioning “whether the religious belief asserted in a RFRA case is\n\nreasonable”—a “question that the federal courts have no business addressing.” Hobby\n\nLobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2778.\n\n       Under this understanding of RFRA, the accommodation scheme substantially\n\nburdens any religious non-profit that objects to performing an act that would cause or\n\notherwise make it complicit in providing contraceptive coverage simply because the\n\nscheme uses substantial fines to compel an act that the non-profit sincerely believes\n\nwould have that effect. The actual legal significance of the compelled act is irrelevant to\n\nthe substantial burden analysis. And because the government has conceded (2) the\n\nsincerity of (3) the religious exercise at issue, the only issue left to address is whether the\n\ngovernment has shown that the accommodation scheme survives strict scrutiny. The\n\njudges who take this position, so far, all agree that the government has not made this\n\n                                              3\n\fshowing. Priests For Life., No. 13-5368, slip op. at 22–25 (Brown, J., dissenting); id. at\n\n46–51 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting); Notre Dame, 786 F.3d at 629–30 (Flaum, J.,\n\ndissenting); Eternal Word Television Network, 756 F.3d at 1348–49 (Pryor, J. specially\n\nconcurring).\n\n       Notwithstanding the strength of those positions, I will proceed under the following\n\nassumptions to highlight an even deeper problem lurking within the self-insured\n\naccommodation scheme: First, I will assume that whether a burden on religious exercise\n\nis “substantial” turns not only on the amount of coercion the government uses to compel\n\nan act (no one disputes the substantiality of the fines at issue here), but also on “how the\n\nlaw or policy being challenged actually operates and affects religious exercise.” Slip Op.\n\nat 39. Second, I will assume this Court may tell a religious adherent she does not face a\n\nsubstantial burden on her religious exercise if her understanding of the law is flawed.\n\nThird, I will assume that any burden the accommodation scheme imposes on Plaintiffs—\n\nwho object to performing any act that would cause or otherwise make them complicit in\n\nproviding various forms of contraceptive coverage—cannot be substantial unless they\n\nshow, for example, how their compelled act causes that coverage. See Slip Op. at 45–66.\n\n       The Court tells Plaintiffs they cannot make this showing “because opting out\n\nwould not trigger, incentivize, or otherwise cause the provision of contraceptive\n\ncoverage.” Slip Op. at 65. If showing this causation is a prerequisite to establishing a\n\nsubstantial burden, the Court properly rejects the insured plaintiffs’ RFRA claim, as their\n\naction or inaction will not affect whether their plan beneficiaries receive objected-to\n\ncoverage. But the self-insured plaintiffs’ inaction will prevent their plan beneficiaries\n\n                                             4\n\ffrom receiving the coverage. If their beneficiaries receive this coverage, it is only\n\nbecause the self-insured plaintiffs, by opting out, caused that effect. Thus, the self-\n\ninsured plaintiffs have shown how their opting out would cause the provision and receipt\n\nof objected-to coverage and established a substantial burden on their religious exercise.\n\n                     II.     THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION IN THIS CASE\n\n       I have nothing to add to the Court’s summary of the background in these cases,\n\nand very little to add to its explanation of the detailed mechanics of the ACA\n\naccommodation scheme. But a critical distinction within scheme bears repeating. Under\n\nthe ACA accommodation scheme, in the insured health plan context, “a health insurance\n\nissuer . . . would be obligated to provide contraceptive coverage under the ACA whether\n\nor not [the insured non-profit] delivered the Form or notification to HHS.” Slip Op. at 48\n\nn.28 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13). But in the self-insured context, a TPA would be\n\n“authorized and obligated to provide the coverage . . . only if the religious non-profit . . .\n\nopts out.” Slip Op at 49 (emphases added); see also 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(b)(2);\n\n29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2).\n\n       The Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits failed to recognize this distinction. See E.\n\nTex. Baptist, 2015 WL 3852811, at *5; Notre Dame, 789 F.3d at 614; Mich. Catholic\n\nConference & Catholic Family Servs. v. Burwell, 755 F.3d 372, 387 (6th Cir. 2014) cert.\n\ngranted, judgment vacated 135 S. Ct. 1914 (2015). The Third and D.C. Circuits failed to\n\nappreciate its significance. See Geneva Coll. v. Sec’y U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human\n\nServs., 778 F.3d 422, 438 (3d Cir. 2015); Priests For Life v. U.S. Dep’t of Health &\n\nHuman Servs., 772 F.3d 229, 254–56 (D.C. Cir. 2014).              This Court considers the\n\n                                              5\n\fdistinction “unremarkable.”     Slip Op. at 49.      I disagree.   The distinction makes a\n\ndifference, and juxtaposing the insured plaintiffs and self-insured plaintiffs forces that\n\ndifference into bold relief.\n\n                                   A. The Insured Plaintiffs\n\n       Assuming causation is key, I agree the accommodation scheme does not\n\nsubstantially burden the insured plaintiffs’ religious exercise. As the Court explains,\n\neven total inaction on the part of an insured non-profit still results in its plan participants\n\nand beneficiaries receiving the coverage to which they are entitled under the ACA\n\nbecause the government has independently obligated a third party (insurance issuers) to\n\nprovide it.3 See Slip Op. at 46–47. Opting out in the insured context does not cause the\n\nreceipt of contraceptive coverage; rather, it merely absolves the eligible insured non-\n\nprofit of any responsibility for the contraceptive coverage its plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries will receive whether it opts out or not. Thus, assuming Plaintiffs must show\n\nhow opting out causes coverage, the accommodation scheme does not substantially\n\nburden the insured plaintiffs’ exercise of religion. The insured accommodation is more\n\nakin to traditional conscientious objector schemes: the government can and will conscript\n\nthe actors it needs to achieve its goals whether objectors opt out or not.\n\n       The same cannot be said of the self-insured plaintiffs, however.\n\n\n3\n   Even the government’s proffered fourth option—declining to sponsor a group health\nplan—would not interfere with contraceptive coverage for the insured plaintiffs’ plan\nbeneficiaries. Without an employer-sponsored plan, these beneficiaries would have to\nfind other health insurance. See Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. 2566,\n2664 (2012) (Scalia, J., dissenting).       And that insurance would likely cover\ncontraceptives. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13.\n                                              6\n\f                                B. The Self-Insured Plaintiffs\n\n       Unlike the insured plaintiffs, the ACA leaves the self-insured plaintiffs in a\n\nposition where, by refusing to opt out, they can prevent their plan beneficiaries from\n\nreceiving the objected-to coverage the beneficiaries are entitled to and would otherwise\n\nreceive under the ACA. In other words, their plan participants and beneficiaries will\n\nreceive the coverage only if they opt out as the government commands. This makes their\n\nopting out a but-for cause of the receipt of the coverage.\n\n       The Court views this ability to prevent contraceptive coverage by inaction as\n\nnothing more than the ability to disobey the law. See Slip Op. at 54–55 & n.35. But that\n\nis the same limited ability the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby possessed, and it goes to the\n\nheart of the substantial burden the self-insured plaintiffs face here. “In Hobby Lobby, the\n\nplaintiff[s] . . . could choose only between (1) complying with the ACA by providing the\n\ncoverage or (2) not complying and paying significant penalties.” Slip Op. at 3 (citing\n\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2759–60). Similarly, these self-insured plaintiffs must\n\nchoose between (1) complying with the ACA by taking an action that ultimately causes\n\ntheir beneficiaries to receive this coverage or (2) not complying and paying significant\n\npenalties. This is a Hobson’s choice, which we have long held imposes a substantial\n\nburden under RFRA. See Abdulhaseeb v. Calbone, 600 F.3d 1301, 1315 (10th Cir. 2010)\n\n(“We conclude that a religious exercise is substantially burdened under [RFRA] 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000cc–1(a) when a government . . . presents the plaintiff with a Hobson’s\n\nchoice—an illusory choice where the only realistically possible course of action trenches\n\non an adherent’s sincerely held religious belief.”); Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1141 (10th\n\n                                             7\n\fCir. 2013) (explaining that the choice between compromising religious beliefs and paying\n\nfines under the ACA “is precisely the sort of Hobson’s choice described in\n\nAbdulhaseeb”).\n\n                           1. The Obvious Causal Connection\n\n      If causation is key to showing a substantial burden, see Slip Op. at 32–33, 45–66,\n\nthe self-insured plaintiffs have surely shown that burden. Certainly, a shifting legal\n\nresponsibility alone may not necessarily create a causal relationship. But here, the self-\n\ninsured plaintiffs’ opt out causes the coverage because (1) the government cannot force\n\nplaintiffs themselves to provide the coverage, Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2785, and (2)\n\nthe government cannot shift the ability (let alone the responsibility) to provide the\n\ncoverage to non-objectors unless the self-insured plaintiffs opt out.     See 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 2590.715-2713A(b)(2); Slip Op. at 48–49. Opting out is thus the only way their plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries may receive the coverage.\n\n      Put another way, if the self-insured plaintiffs do not opt out, who will provide the\n\ncoverage for their plan participants and beneficiaries? The answer: no one. The self-\n\ninsured plaintiffs cannot do so per their faith; the TPAs cannot do so per the law. Thus,\n\nthe self-insured accommodation renders any duty to provide, and any entitlement to\n\nreceive, contraceptive coverage wholly unenforceable and thus illusory—unless and until\n\nthe self-insured plaintiffs opt out.   Cf. Pennington v. Northrop Grumman Space &\n\nMission Sys. Corp., 269 F. App’x 812, 819 (10th Cir. 2008) (unpublished) (“[W]hen a\n\npromise, in reality, promises nothing—it is illusory.” (Internal marks and citation\n\nomitted)).\n\n                                            8\n\f       To fully understand why no one can or will provide this objected-to coverage\n\nunless the self-insured plaintiffs perform a compelled act, one must view the ACA\n\nMandate and accommodation scheme in light of Hobby Lobby. Hobby Lobby clearly\n\nholds forcing religious employers to provide objected-to contraceptive coverage violates\n\nRFRA. 134 S. Ct. at 2785. So, if any entity is to provide the coverage, it must be a third\n\nparty. The insured accommodation independently conscripts third parties to provide the\n\ncoverage. But as this Court points out, the self-insured accommodation was drafted such\n\nthat no third party can provide the coverage in the self-insured context unless and until\n\nthe objecting religious employer opts out. Slip Op. at 48–49; see also Eternal Word\n\nTelevision Network, 756 F.3d at 1347 (Pryor, J., specially concurring) (explaining that,\n\nwithout the Form or letter, a TPA “has no legal authority to step into the shoes of the\n\n[non-profit] and provide contraceptive coverage to the employees and beneficiaries of the\n\n[non-profit]”). As such, a third party’s legal authority (i.e. permission) to provide the\n\ncoverage is wholly dependent upon (i.e. caused by) the self-insured non-profit opting out.\n\n       The Court believes we should focus on the fact that the ACA “entitle[s] plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries to coverage whether or not the plaintiffs opt out” and\n\nimposes a duty on “either the religious non-profit organization or the TPA” to provide\n\nthat coverage. Slip Op. at 33, 57. But this reasoning (1) fails to consider the ACA\n\nMandate in light of the limitations Hobby Lobby already imposed, and (2) confuses legal\n\nconcepts (duty and entitlement) with real-world effects (provision and receipt).\n\n       First, the Court’s focus on the ACA’s requirement that “either the religious non-\n\nprofit organization or the TPA” provide the coverage, Slip Op. at 57, ignores the fact that\n\n                                            9\n\fthe government cannot require the religious non-profit to provide the coverage under\n\nHobby Lobby. By ignoring the limitation Hobby Lobby imposes on the government, the\n\nCourt simultaneously acknowledges that “opting out is necessarily a but-for cause of\n\nsomeone else—the TPA—providing contraceptive coverage,” Slip Op. at 56, and\n\nnevertheless rejects the self-insured plaintiffs’ RFRA claims for lack of causation. Slip\n\nOp. at 64–65.     But again, Hobby Lobby forbids the government from placing this\n\nrequirement on the non-profits themselves. So if opting out is necessarily a but-for cause\n\nof someone else providing the coverage, it is necessarily a but-for cause of anyone\n\nproviding the coverage at all. Essentially, the Court concedes but-for cause and then\n\nturns around and denies the existence of any causation. What?\n\n       Second, the Court asserts that the self-insured plaintiffs’ opt out will not cause the\n\nactual provision and receipt of objected-to coverage because the ACA creates an\n\nindependent, albeit illusory, duty and entitlement related to that coverage. True, opting\n\nout does not cause entitlement to contraceptive coverage—the ACA entitles all health\n\nplan beneficiaries to contraceptive coverage. But these beneficiaries will not receive that\n\ncoverage unless the self-insured plaintiffs do something to cause its provision from a\n\nthird party. In other words, the ACA may independently say “someone” has a duty to\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage, see 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715–2713, but no one can or will\n\nhonor that duty and provide the coverage unless the self-insured plaintiffs opt out. No\n\nself-insured plaintiff will honor it because the government cannot force them to under\n\nHobby Lobby, and no third party can honor it because no third party has authority to do\n\nso without an opt out. Based on this error, the Court concludes that “federal law, not the\n\n                                             10\n\factions of the religious objector, ensures that plan participants and beneficiaries will\n\nreceive contraceptive coverage.” Slip Op. at 52 (emphasis added). But that is simply\n\nwrong. As explained above, federal law alone does not ensure receipt of the coverage\n\nfrom the self-insured plaintiffs; and it does not even allow, let alone ensure, receipt of\n\nthat coverage from a third party unless the self-insured plaintiffs opt out. Rather, federal\n\nlaw, only in conjunction with the self-insured plaintiffs’ opt out, allows plan participants\n\nand beneficiaries to receive contraceptive coverage.4\n\n       These errors, taken together, cause the Court to reject a straw man rather than the\n\nself-insured plaintiffs’ RFRA claims. The self-insured plaintiffs do not claim a RFRA\n\nviolation based on the fact that the ACA created an entitlement to contraceptive\n\ncoverage; they object to the causal role they must play in providing that coverage. 5\n\n\n4\n  Even with the opt-out, federal law does not always ensure receipt of the coverage. For\nexample, the Court asserts “the ACA ensures plan participants and beneficiaries will\nreceive contraceptive coverage” but simultaneously contradicts itself by acknowledging\nthat TPAs for self-insured church plans may in fact decline to provide that coverage, in\nwhich case “plan participants and beneficiaries would not get the coverage to which they\nare otherwise entitled.” Slip Op. at 61 & n.41 (emphases added).\n        The Court’s attempt to paint these contradictory positions as consistent suffers\nfrom the same logical flaw highlighted above; that is, it confuses the actual provision and\nreceipt of coverage with a concededly unenforceable entitlement and duty to provide it.\nIf the law cannot force an unwilling TPA to provide contraceptive coverage, the TPA will\nnot provide it, and the plan beneficiaries will not receive it. Cf. Mach Mining, LLC v.\nE.E.O.C., 135 S. Ct. 1645, 1652–53 (2015) (acknowledging that even the government\nmay violate the law, “especially so when [it faces] no consequence”). Thus, the existence\nof an unenforceable duty to provide contraceptive coverage does not ensure receipt, as\nthis Court seems to believe.\n5\n  The Court also asserts that religious non-profits “cannot preclude the government from\nrequiring others to provide the legally required coverage in its stead,” Slip Op. at 51–52,\nand “cannot hamstring government efforts to ensure that plan participants and\nbeneficiaries receive the coverage to which they are entitled under the ACA,” Slip Op. at\n                                            11\n\f      A proper accommodation may relieve otherwise substantial burdens on religious\n\nexercise, but this accommodation fails to do so, at least in the self-insured context. And\n\nto be sure, “[a] burden does not rise to the level of being substantial when it places an\n\ninconsequential or de minimis burden on an adherent’s religious exercise.” Slip Op. at 41\n\n(quoting Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 246). But here, the accommodation scheme foists\n\nupon the self-insured plaintiffs a choice with dire consequences. Either (1) they refuse to\n\nact, which would avoid causing their plan beneficiaries to receive objected-to coverage\n\nbut trigger crippling fines for violating the law or (2) they act, which would cause the\n\nreceipt of this coverage and violate their faith.         If “the purpose of religious\n\naccommodation” was to permit religious objectors “to avoid a religious burden and to\n\ncomply with the law,” see Slip Op. at 55, it fails to achieve that purpose. Rather, the\n\naccommodation foists upon the self-insured plaintiffs a Hobson’s choice and thus a\n\nsubstantial burden on their exercise of religion. Abdulhaseeb, 600 F.3d at 1315.\n\n            2. This is Not a Conscientious Objector Accommodation Scheme\n\n      The Court believes this accommodation scheme akin to the conscientious objector\n\nschemes used for military conscription.      See Slip Op. at 52 n.33.       Not so.    The\n\n\n\n71. I agree that this should not be the case but, unfortunately, the government drafted the\nself-insured accommodation such that the self-insured plaintiffs can, by inaction, do\nexactly that. As explained above, that is precisely why their opting out causes the receipt\nof objected-to coverage.\n        Moreover, to the extent this language connotes dissatisfaction with the problems\ncreated by the self-insured accommodation, such dissatisfaction is irrelevant to whether\nthe law imposes a substantial burden under RFRA. Our job is not to “add words to the\nlaw to produce what is thought to be a desirable result.” Abercrombie & Fitch, 135 S. Ct.\nat 2033.\n                                            12\n\faccommodation scheme may function like a conscientious objector scheme in some\n\nregards, but it ultimately forces objectors to play a very different and causal role.\n\n       Military conscription law generally requires male citizens to register for the draft\n\nand allows the President to draft a certain number of men from that pool of candidates\n\ninto active duty in the Armed Forces.6 See, e.g., Arver v. United States, 245 U.S. 366,\n\n375–76 (1918) (allowing the President to draft up to two groups of 500,000 men). After\n\nregistering, conscientious objectors can opt out of serving in combat. 50 App. U.S.C.\n\n§ 456(j). But they cannot reduce the number of men the President ultimately drafts.\n\nWhether objectors lawfully register and opt out, or register and then choose unlawfully to\n\navoid induction, or even choose unlawfully not to register at all, the President can and\n\nwill draft the same number of men needed for war. See LAWRENCE M. BASKIR &\n\nWILLIAM A. STRAUSS, CHANCE AND CIRCUMSTANCE: THE DRAFT, THE WAR, AND THE\n\nVIETNAM GENERATION 14–28 (1978) (explaining that the government’s Vietnam draft\n\npolicies “did not care who was drafted as long as enough people were drafted”).\n\n       Indeed, the Court’s reliance on Sheridan v. United States, 483 F.2d 169 (8th Cir.\n\n1973), highlights this difference. In Sheridan, the defendant registered for the draft but\n\ndid not lawfully opt out. Instead, he simply refused to be inducted. Id. at 170. But the\n\nresult under conscription law was the same: “another person [was] called in his place.”\n\nId. at 174. In other words, like the insured plaintiffs, no matter what conscientious\n\nobjectors do or refuse to do, the government can and will achieve its military draft goals.\n\n6\n  Currently, “every male citizen of the United States . . . between the ages of eighteen\nand twenty-six” must register in order to facilitate any eventual conscription into the\nArmed Forces. 50 App. U.S.C. § 453(a).\n                                             13\n\f       The opposite result occurs under the self-insured accommodation scheme. If a\n\nself-insured plaintiff simply refuses to provide coverage and does not opt out, the\n\ngovernment cannot call a third party in its place. The accommodation scheme thus places\n\nthe self-insured plaintiffs in a very different position vis-à-vis helping the government\n\nachieve its religiously objectionable goals. Conscientious objectors cannot prevent the\n\ngovernment from conscripting their replacements; but the self-insured plaintiffs can\n\ncompletely prevent the government from even authorizing their TPAs to provide\n\nobjected-to coverage. Conscientious objectors also need not identify a related third party\n\nto serve in their stead; but the self-insured plaintiffs must identify a related third party\n\nthrough a form or letter.     And this form or letter is the only means by which the\n\ngovernment can authorize that third party to serve in their stead. Under conscientious\n\nobjector schemes, the government may independently draft non-objecting Americans into\n\ncombat to further its war efforts; conscientious objectors have no power to stop it. But\n\nunder the self-insured accommodation scheme the government needs the self-insured\n\nplaintiffs to commit an act to further its contraceptive coverage efforts; their beneficiaries\n\nwill not receive this coverage unless they commit that act and cause that result. Such a\n\nconscientious objector scheme—where the government could draft a replacement soldier\n\nonly if the initial conscientious objector opted out and identified a previously ineligible\n\nrelative to serve in his stead—would be immensely problematic, to say the least.7\n\n\n7\n  The Court attempts to counter this point by referencing the Enrollment Act of 1863,\nwhich “permitted a draftee to avoid service only by either providing a substitute or\npaying $300.” Slip Op. at 52 n.33 (quoting Act of March 3, 1863, ch. 75, § 13, 12 Stat.\n731, 733 (1863)). But this act was a short-lived experiment that did not even survive to\n                                             14\n\f       In relying on conscientious objector schemes the Court commits the same error it\n\nlevies against this dissent: it fails to appreciate the broader structures of both the\n\naccommodation and conscientious objector schemes. In comparing the two schemes, the\n\nCourt focuses only on the acts the objector must perform to opt out, and what happens if\n\nthe objector performs those acts. The comparison totally ignores the broader and more\n\ncritical difference between the two schemes: what happens if the objector refuses to\n\nperform those acts? Conscription law requires that “someone” go to war, and in the end\n\n“someone” will go to war. The law is such that the government can and will shift this\n\nlegal duty to a non-objector regardless of the objector’s action or inaction. Conversely,\n\nthe ACA says “someone” must provide contraceptive coverage, but the self-insured\n\naccommodation was drafted such that if the self-insured plaintiffs choose to do nothing\n\nrather than opt out, no one will actually provide that coverage. Again, the government\n\ncannot force the plaintiffs to provide the coverage, and it cannot shift the duty to provide\n\nthe coverage unless the self-insured plaintiffs choose to opt out. If the government could\n\nindependently shift this duty (as conscription law allows) or eliminate the need to shift\n\nthe duty at all (as the insured accommodation does) that might eliminate the causal role\n\nthe end of that war. Moreover, resentment over the Enrollment Act and its opt-out\nprovision triggered the “New York City draft riot, the largest [and deadliest] civil\ninsurrection in American history apart from the South’s rebellion itself.” ERIC FONER,\nRECONSTRUCTION: AMERICA’S UNFINISHED REVOLUTION 1863–1877 at 32 (1988). “No\ncase questioning the Civil War draft was heard by the Supreme Court, but it is known\nthat Chief Justice Roger Taney prepared a rough outline of an opinion declaring the act\nunconstitutional.” Leon Friedman, Conscription and the Constitution, 67 MICH. L. REV.\n1493, 1546 (1969). Indeed, one eminent historian called the substitution provision a\n“grotesque monstrosit[y]” and stated “[t]he government could hardly have devised a\nworse law.” BRUCE CATTON, THE CIVIL WAR 208 (1987). I would call that problematic.\n\n                                            15\n\fthe self-insured plaintiffs currently face. But presently, the law forces the self-insured\n\nplaintiffs into gatekeeping positions and then uses fines to force them to open the gates.\n\n           3. The Supreme Court’s Little Sisters and Wheaton College Orders\n\n       The Court also believes the accommodation scheme does not impose a substantial\n\nburden on self-insured non-profits because the government’s new alternative notice\n\naccommodation—which forces an objecting non-profit to write a letter to HHS opting out\n\nand identifying its TPAs and/or health insurance issuers—is essentially akin to the\n\nSupreme Court’s injunctions pending appeal in Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the\n\nAged, Denver, Colorado v. Sebelius, 134 S. Ct. 1022 (2014), Wheaton College v.\n\nBurwell, 134 S. Ct. 2806 (2014), and most recently Zubik v. Burwell, Nos. 14A1065, 14-\n\n1418, 2015 WL 3947586, at *1 (U.S. June 29, 2015). See Slip Op. at 42 n.25, 59 n.39.\n\nBut the Court’s reliance on these interim orders appears to be based on two flawed\n\nassumptions: (1) that the notices required by these orders were sufficient to authorize a\n\nTPA to provide coverage it could not provide before, and (2) even assuming this dubious\n\ninterpretation of the orders, that they approved of compelling religious non-profits to play\n\nthis causal role under RFRA’s first step (no substantial burden) as opposed to approving\n\nof such compulsion only where it satisfies RFRA’s second step (strict scrutiny).\n\n       As to the first assumption, the Little Sisters order nowhere contemplates allowing\n\nthe government to use the Little Sisters’ interim written notice to facilitate coverage by\n\nalternative means. And the Wheaton College order did not allow the government to rely\n\non Wheaton’s interim written notice, either. Rather, it allowed the government to rely on\n\npreexisting knowledge that Wheaton qualified for exemption and would not provide\n\n                                            16\n\fcertain contraceptive coverage. See Wheaton Coll., 134 S. Ct. at 2807 (“But [Wheaton]\n\nhas already notified the Government—without using EBSA Form 700—that it meets the\n\nrequirements for exemption from the contraceptive coverage requirement on religious\n\ngrounds. Nothing in this order precludes the Government from relying on this notice, to\n\nthe extent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provision of full contraceptive\n\ncoverage under the Act.” (emphases added)). Moreover, as Justice Sotomayor’s dissent\n\nin Wheaton College shows, the written notices required in Wheaton College, Little\n\nSisters, and Zubik were insufficient to authorize TPA coverage under the then-effective\n\naccommodation, and may remain insufficient even under the new alternative\n\naccommodation. See Wheaton Coll., 134 S. Ct. at 2814 n.6 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).8\n\n       To the extent Wheaton College allows the government to rely on its knowledge of\n\nWheaton’s objection, this merely tracks the Supreme Court’s decision in Bowen v. Roy,\n\nwhere the Court rejected a Free Exercise challenge to the government’s use of a social\n\nsecurity number it already possessed and concluded that the First Amendment does not\n\n“require the government to conduct its own internal affairs in ways that comport with the\n\nreligious beliefs of particular citizens.” 476 U.S. at 693, 699 (1986). But importantly:\n\n\n\n8\n    That is, even under the new alternative notice scheme, the “information necessary to\nverify applicants’ eligibility under 26 CFR §54.9815-2713A(a),” see Zubik, 2015 WL\n3947586, at *1, does not contain all the information required by the regulations and thus\nmight not qualify as a valid opt out sufficient to trigger TPA coverage, see 29 C.F.R. §\n2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii)(B) (requiring the self-insured organization to provide, among\nother things “the plan name and type . . . and the name and contact information for any of\nthe plan’s third party administrators”); Wheaton Coll., 134 S. Ct. at 2814 n.6 (Sotomayor,\nJ., dissenting).\n\n                                            17\n\f       a majority of justices [in Roy] indicated that the requirement that applicants\n       furnish a social security number was a different matter. Five justices either\n       concluded or strongly suggested that the government could not require an\n       applicant to provide the number on a benefits application if the applicant\n       had a sincere religious objection to doing so.\n\nUniv. of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 743 F.3d 547, 567 (7th Cir. 2014) (Flaum, J.,\n\ndissenting) (emphasis in original), cert. granted, judgment vacated sub nom. Univ. of\n\nNotre Dame v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 1528 (2015); see Roy, 476 U.S. at 714–16 (Blackmun,\n\nJ., concurring in part), 732 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“The\n\nrise of the welfare state was not the fall of the Free Exercise Clause.”), 733 (White, J.,\n\ndissenting).\n\n       Moreover, the Court may well have expressly allowed for this reliance in Wheaton\n\nCollege because, unlike the Little Sisters, Wheaton provides insurance through both self-\n\ninsured plans and insured plans subject to the Mandate. See Wheaton Coll. v. Burwell, 50\n\nF. Supp. 3d 939, 944 (N.D. Ill. 2014) (Wheaton “offers its health insurance pursuant to\n\nsix plans: two insured HMO plans, a [grandfathered] PPO plan, two self-funded\n\nprescription drug plans, and an insured student health plan.” (footnote omitted)). Thus,\n\nunlike the wholly self-insured Little Sisters, the government might independently ensure\n\nthat an issuer from at least one of these insured health plans provides full contraceptive\n\ncoverage to at least some of Wheaton’s various plan beneficiaries under the current ACA\n\nregime without forcing Wheaton to play a causal role in the receipt of that coverage.\n\n       Thus, the Little Sisters, Wheaton College, and Zubik orders allow religious non-\n\nprofits to simply notify the government that they qualify for exemption and will not\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage.      The government may use its knowledge of these\n\n                                            18\n\fobjections when choosing between independently available alternative means to ensure\n\ncoverage is provided (as the conscientious objector and insured schemes do). But these\n\norders do not allow the government to compel religious non-profits to furnish the\n\ndocument that is essential to cause their plan beneficiaries to receive objected-to\n\ncoverage.\n\n       And yet, suppose these orders could be read to say that the written notices they\n\nrequired were legally sufficient to authorize a previously ineligible TPA to provide\n\nobjected-to coverage. Under that dubious interpretation, the orders would indeed force\n\nself-insured religious objectors to perform an act that causes the ultimate provision of the\n\ncoverage, as they would make the provision of the coverage wholly contingent upon the\n\nreligious objectors’ acts of providing HHS with that notice. For all the reasons discussed\n\nabove, that interpretation of the orders would impose a substantial burden on the self-\n\ninsured plaintiffs’ exercise of religion.\n\n       So, turning to the Court’s second assumption, even under its dubious interpretation\n\nof the orders, the orders nowhere say that forcing religious non-profits to play this sort of\n\ncausal role avoids imposing a substantial burden on their religious exercise. Instead,\n\nassuming the Court’s interpretation of these orders is correct, these orders would impose\n\na substantial burden under RFRA’s first step and therefore must comply with RFRA’s\n\nsecond step (strict scrutiny). Indeed, Judge Kavanaugh has compellingly argued that\n\nthese orders simply set forth a less restrictive means of achieving the government’s\n\ncompelling interest in facilitating access to contraceptive coverage. See Priests For Life,\n\nNo. 13-5368, slip op. at 46–51 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). These orders do not require\n\n                                             19\n\freligious non-profits to identify related third parties for the government to authorize and\n\npossibly conscript in their stead. Rather, they only require the non-profits to inform HHS\n\nthat they qualify for exemption and will not provide objected-to coverage. As discussed\n\nabove regarding conscientious objector schemes, a significant difference exists between\n\nasking a religious objector to say simply “no” and compelling that objector to identify a\n\nrelated entity to serve as a scapegoat where no one else can.9\n\n                4. ERISA-Bound Plans v. ERISA-Exempt Church Plans\n\n       The burden the self-insured plaintiffs face is most salient with regards to Southern\n\nNazarene, whose TPA is subject to ERISA enforcement and therefore will be not only\n\nauthorized but also required to provide contraceptives to the participants and\n\nbeneficiaries of Southern Nazarene’s self-insured plan only if Southern Nazarene opts\n\nout. See 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2). Southern Nazarene’s opt out will thus\n\nclearly cause someone to provide contraceptive coverage where no one would or could\n\nbefore.\n\n       But the lack of an enforcement mechanism as to ERISA-exempt church plans does\n\nnot itself remove the causal role and substantial burden that the accommodation scheme\n\nfoists upon the church-plan plaintiffs. For example, the Guidestone Plan is an ERISA-\n\nexempt church plan, but at least one of its TPAs, Highmark, has indicated it will provide\n\nfull contraceptive coverage for those self-insured organizations that use the Guidestone\n\nPlan and validly opt out. And plaintiffs Reaching Souls, Truett-McConnell College, and\n\n\n9\n  Moreover, this less restrictive means of achieving the same goal necessarily dooms the\ncurrent self-insured accommodation scheme under strict scrutiny. See infra Part III.\n                                            20\n\fMid-America Christian University are all self-insured plaintiffs that use the Guidestone\n\nPlan. Slip Op. at 21; SN Supp. Br. II at 9 n.2. So even though their opting out might not\n\ntrigger an enforceable duty to provide objected-to coverage, these church plan plaintiffs\n\nhave established that their opting out will actually cause Highmark to provide the\n\ncoverage—coverage it cannot provide unless they opt out.\n\n       True, given the repeal of the accommodation scheme’s non-interference provision,\n\nchurch plans like the Guidestone Plan might try to fire TPAs like Highmark and replace\n\nthem with TPAs that promise not to provide coverage for objected-to contraceptives, and\n\nthose plaintiffs that use the Guidestone Plan might be able to fire Guidestone if it refuses\n\nto do so. See RS Oral at 12:57–13:10. Thus, by economic coercion, these plaintiffs\n\nmight be able to ultimately stop the provision of the coverage they were initially forced to\n\ncause. But, the government maintains that “such conduct is generally unlawful and is\n\nprohibited under . . . state and federal laws.” See 79 Fed. Reg. at 51,095. And none of\n\nthis changes the present fact that if plaintiffs who use the Guidestone Plan opt out, they\n\nwill cause Highmark to perform a religiously objected-to act on their behalf where\n\nHighmark previously could not do so. Thus, those self-insured plaintiffs that use the\n\nGuidestone Plan have shown “presently threatened injuries” warranting injunctive relief.\n\nConnecticut v. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. 660, 674 (1931).\n\n       The Little Sisters plaintiffs, on the other hand, have not established this causal\n\nconnection. The Little Sisters’ primary TPA, Brothers Services, is not bound by ERISA\n\nand has promised not to provide contraceptive coverage even if Little Sisters opts out.\n\nLittle Sisters asserts that Brothers Trust also uses other TPAs who might choose to\n\n                                            21\n\fprovide contraceptive coverage if they opt out, but they have not sufficiently developed\n\nthis theory to bear the burden of establishing that their opting out will presently cause\n\nsomeone to provide contraceptive coverage to their plan beneficiaries.\n\n      The Court also suggests self-insured non-profits “could relieve themselves of any\n\nlingering doubts they may have about causation by [1] employing an insured plan, [2]\n\nemploying a self-insured church plan where the Departments lack authority to enforce the\n\nMandate against their TPA, or [3] administering the self-insured plan on their own in-\n\nhouse without using a TPA.” Slip Op. at 52 n.32. But none of these options alleviate the\n\nsubstantial burden the accommodation scheme imposes. First, choosing to switch from a\n\nself-insured plan, where no coverage can be provided without an opt out, to an insured\n\nplan, where coverage will be provided by a third party, would simply mean choosing to\n\ncause that coverage by switching plans rather than opting out. Second, as discussed\n\nabove, even in the church plan context, opting out may still cause a TPA to provide the\n\ncoverage. Third, no plaintiff in this case administers its plan in-house. So to the extent\n\nthe Court opines on the legal effect the ACA Mandate might have on a plan not at issue\n\nin this case, the Court impermissibly exceeds its jurisdiction by “advising what the law\n\nwould be upon a hypothetical state of facts.” Lewis v. Cont’l Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472,\n\n477 (1990) (quoting North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 246 (1971)).\n\n      Given that we do not have jurisdiction to pass on this hypothetical, the self-insured\n\nplaintiffs should not have to rebut it to prove a present substantial burden under RFRA.\n\nBut, because the Court goes there, administering a self-insured plan in-house without a\n\nTPA can be prohibitively complex, limit options for managing care, and create legal\n\n                                           22\n\fpitfalls that many non-profits simply cannot afford to handle. See Thomas R. McLean &\n\nEdward P. Richards, Health Care’s “Thirty Years War”: The Origins and Dissolution of\n\nManaged Care, 60 N.Y.U. ANN. SURV. AM. L. 283, 313 (2004); see generally Rhonda D.\n\nOrin and Daniel J. Healy, Self-Administering, Insuring and Funding Benefit Plans, 197–\n\n213 in HUMAN RESOURCES (Thompson 2007 Summer Edition).\n\n          C. Summing Up the Substantial Burden On the Self-Insured Plaintiffs\n\n       The Court concludes that the Plaintiffs’ causation arguments fail because “opting\n\nout would not trigger, incentivize, or otherwise cause the provision of contraceptive\n\ncoverage.” Slip Op. at 65–66. This conclusion is correct in the insured context. But the\n\nself-insured plaintiffs, with the exception of Little Sisters, have shown exactly how their\n\nact of opting out will cause someone to provide contraceptive coverage where their\n\nrefusal to act would prevent that result. Unfortunately, the Court fails to see this obvious\n\ncausal relationship because it ignores the clear holding of Hobby Lobby and fails to\n\ncomprehend the difference between unenforceable entitlement and actual receipt. The\n\ngovernment has left self-insured plaintiffs in a position where they must decide whether\n\ntheir beneficiaries will actually receive objected-to contraceptive coverage.           The\n\naccommodation does not absolve these plaintiffs of this responsibility. Instead, it forces\n\nthem to either (1) violate their sincere religious beliefs by performing an action that will\n\ncause their beneficiaries to receive objected-to coverage, or (2) violate the law and incur\n\nsteep fines to obey those religious beliefs. Again, this is a Hobson’s choice and thus a\n\nsubstantial burden on their religious exercise under RFRA. Abdulhaseeb, 600 F.3d at\n\n1317; Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1141.\n\n                                            23\n\f                                   III.    STRICT SCRUTINY\n\n       Because the government has imposed a substantial burden on at least the self-\n\ninsured plaintiffs’ religious exercise, under RFRA it must demonstrate that this burden is\n\n“(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive\n\nmeans of furthering that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1. Our\n\nprecedent currently holds the government has no compelling interest in contraceptive\n\ncoverage. See Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1143. But even assuming such a compelling\n\ninterest, see Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2780 (assuming the same), 2785–86 (Kennedy,\n\nJ., concurring), 2799 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting), the government cannot show this scheme\n\nis the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. As discussed above, the Supreme\n\nCourt’s interim orders in Little Sisters,      Wheaton College, and Zubik, even when\n\ninterpreted so as to force self-insured non-profits to play a necessary causal role in\n\ncontraceptive coverage, provide a less restrictive means of achieving the same goal. See\n\nPriests For Life, No. 13-5368, slip op. at 46–51 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).            The\n\nexistence of this less restrictive means dooms the current accommodation scheme under\n\nstrict scrutiny. Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2781–82.\n\n                                     IV.     CONCLUSION\n\n       “Congress enacted RFRA in 1993 in order to provide very broad protection for\n\nreligious liberty,” Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2760, a liberty essential to our country’s\n\nconstitutional tradition, albeit with boundaries difficult to define, see id. at 2785\n\n(Kennedy, J., concurring). The Court today makes causation one of those boundaries.\n\nEven assuming this boundary, however, the self-insured plaintiffs in this case, with the\n\n                                             24\n\fexception of the Little Sisters plaintiffs, have clearly shown how their compelled act will\n\ncause their plan beneficiaries to receive objected-to coverage that they could not\n\notherwise receive. Therefore, I dissent from the Court’s holding regarding these self-\n\ninsured plaintiffs. Even assuming a causation requirement, I would still hold these self-\n\ninsured plaintiffs have shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their\n\nRFRA claim and that the other requirements for a preliminary injunction are met. I\n\nwould therefore affirm the district court’s denial of a preliminary injunction in Little\n\nSisters, 6 F. Supp. 3d 1225, affirm the district court’s grant of a preliminary injunction in\n\nReaching Souls, 2013 WL 6804259, and affirm in part (as to the self-insured plaintiffs:\n\nSouthern Nazarene University and Mid-America University) and reverse in part (as to the\n\ninsured plaintiffs: Oklahoma Baptist University and Oklahoma Wesleyan University) the\n\ndistrict court’s grant of a preliminary injunction in Southern Nazarene, 2013 WL\n\n6804265.\n\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\f",

INTRODUCTION\n\n      When Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) in 2010, it built upon\n\nthe widespread use of employer-based health insurance in the United States.1 The ACA\n\nand its implementing regulations require employers who provide health insurance\n\ncoverage to their employees to include coverage for certain types of preventive care\n\nwithout cost to the insured. The appeals before us concern the regulations that require\n\ngroup health plans to cover contraceptive services for women as a form of preventive\n\ncare (“Mandate”).2\n\n      In response to religious concerns, the Departments implementing the ACA—\n\nHealth and Human Services (“HHS”), Labor, and Treasury—adopted a regulation that\n\nexempts religious employers—churches and their integrated auxiliaries—from covering\n\ncontraceptives. When religious non-profit organizations complained about their omission\n\nfrom this exemption, the Departments adopted a regulation that allows them to opt out of\n\n\n\n      1\n        A majority of the nonelderly population in the United States receives health\ninsurance as a job benefit through an employer. See Melissa Majerol, Vann Newkirk &\nRachel Garfield, The Uninsured: A Primer – Key Facts About Health Insurance and the\nUninsured in America, The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 1 (Jan.\n2015), http://files.kff.org/attachment/the-uninsured-a-primer-key-facts-about-health-\ninsurance-and-the-uninsured-in-america-primer.\n      2\n         We use “Mandate” as shorthand for the ACA’s employer mandate, which\nrequires employers who offer health benefits to comply with the coverage requirements\ndetailed in the ACA and its implementing regulations. This Mandate is distinct from the\nindividual mandate at issue in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"809122\"><a href=\"/opinion/809122/national-federation-of-independent-business-v-sebelius/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

They\n\ncontend that complying with the Mandate or the accommodation scheme imposes a\n\nsubstantial burden on their religious exercise. The Plaintiffs argue the Mandate and the\n\naccommodation scheme violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”) and\n\nthe Religion and Speech Clauses of the First Amendment.4\n\n       Although we recognize and respect the sincerity of Plaintiffs’ beliefs and\n\narguments, we conclude the accommodation scheme relieves Plaintiffs of their\n\nobligations under the Mandate and does not substantially burden their religious exercise\n\nunder RFRA or infringe upon their First Amendment rights. Exercising jurisdiction\n\n       3\n         Plaintiffs object to the term “opt out” because their accommodation from the\nMandate involves an act on their part—self-certification—that they deem objectionable.\nWe believe “opt out” is accurate. Self-certifying for the accommodation expressly\nrelieves Plaintiffs of their obligation to provide, pay for, or facilitate contraceptive\ncoverage, and does so without substantially burdening their religious exercise. Under\nthese conditions, the self-certification is accurately characterized as an “opt out.” By\ndefinition, all opt-out mechanisms require some affirmative act by objecting parties.\n       4\n        RFRA applies to all subsequent federal statutes absent a specific exemption by\nCongress. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-3(b) (“Federal statutory law adopted after November\n16, 1993, is subject to this chapter unless such law explicitly excludes such application by\nreference to this chapter.”). The ACA, enacted in 2010, did not contain a specific\nexemption and is subject to RFRA. See Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v.

Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S.\n\nCt. 2751 (2014), in which closely-held for-profit corporations challenged the Mandate\n\nunder RFRA. The difference between Hobby Lobby and this case is significant and\n\nframes the issue here. In Hobby Lobby, the plaintiff for-profit corporations objected on\n\nreligious grounds to providing contraceptive coverage and could choose only between (1)\n\ncomplying with the ACA by providing the coverage or (2) not complying and paying\n\nsignificant penalties. Id. at 2759-60. In the cases before us, the plaintiff religious non-\n\nprofit organizations can avail themselves of an accommodation that allows them to opt\n\nout of providing contraceptive coverage without penalty. Plaintiffs contend the process\n\nto opt out substantially burdens their religious exercise.\n\n       In other words, unlike in Hobby Lobby, the Plaintiffs do not challenge the general\n\nobligation under the ACA to provide contraceptive coverage. They instead challenge the\n\nprocess they must follow to get out of complying with that obligation. The Plaintiffs do\n\n                                             -3-\n\fnot claim the Departments have not tried to accommodate their religious concerns. They\n\nclaim the Departments’ attempt is inadequate because the acts required to opt out of the\n\nMandate substantially burden their religious exercise. As we discuss more fully below,\n\nhowever, the accommodation relieves Plaintiffs of their obligation to provide, pay for, or\n\nfacilitate contraceptive coverage, and does so without substantially burdening their\n\nreligious exercise.\n\n                                   III. BACKGROUND\n\n       We begin by providing background information on the ACA and its implementing\n\nregulations, the Plaintiffs objecting to the accommodation scheme, and the procedural\n\nhistory of the three cases before us.\n\n                               A. Regulatory Background\n\n       The regulations at issue in these cases have evolved in significant ways since their\n\ninitial promulgation. We review: (1) the exemption from the ACA’s contraceptive\n\ncoverage requirement for churches and integrated auxiliaries, (2) the accommodation\n\nscheme for religious non-profit organizations, and (3) the mechanics of the\n\naccommodation scheme for different types of group health plans.\n\n1. The ACA Mandate and the Religious Employer Exemption\n\n       Under the ACA, employer-sponsored group health plans must meet minimum\n\ncoverage requirements. As part of these requirements, both group health plans and health\n\ninsurance issuers must cover preventive health care services and cannot require plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries to share the costs of these services through co-payments,\n\n                                           -4-\n\fdeductibles, or co-insurance. 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13. On July 19, 2010, the Departments\n\nissued interim final rules implementing the ACA’s requirements for preventive services.\n\nInterim Final Rules for Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to\n\nCoverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\n\n75 Fed. Reg. 41,726 (July 19, 2010).\n\n      Among the services required by the ACA are preventive care and screenings for\n\nwomen “as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources\n\nand Services Administration” (“HRSA”), a federal agency within HHS. 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 300gg-13(a)(4). On August 1, 2011, after receiving recommendations from the\n\nInstitute of Medicine (“IOM”), the HRSA issued its guidelines for women’s preventive\n\nhealth services. The guidelines include coverage of “[a]ll Food and Drug Administration\n\n[(“FDA”)] approved contraceptives, sterilization procedures, and patient education and\n\ncounseling for all women with reproductive capacity,” as prescribed by a health care\n\nprovider. HRSA, Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines,\n\nhttp://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines (last visited Mar. 25, 2015).\n\n      In accordance with the HRSA’s guidelines, the Departments require coverage of\n\nthe full range of FDA-approved contraceptive services. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n2713(a)(1)(iv); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv); 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv). Not\n\nall employers, however, are required to comply with the Mandate.\n\n      First, employers with 50 or fewer employees are exempt from the Mandate\n\nbecause they are not required to offer insurance under the ACA. See 26 U.S.C.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f§§ 4980H(c)(2)(A), 4980D(d).\n\n       Second, “grandfathered” plans are exempt from the Mandate because the ACA\n\nallows individuals to temporarily maintain the health coverage they possessed before the\n\nACA was enacted. See 42 U.S.C. § 18011.5\n\n       Third, and the most relevant here, is the exemption for religious employers. In\n\nresponse to concerns from religious organizations, the Departments amended the interim\n\nfinal regulations to give the HRSA authority to exempt group health plans established or\n\nmaintained by religious employers. See Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers\n\nRelating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable\n\nCare Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 46,621, 46,623 (Aug. 3, 2011). The Departments defined a\n\n“religious employer” as one that: “(1) Has the inculcation of religious values as its\n\npurpose; (2) primarily employs persons who share its religious tenets; (3) primarily\n\nserves persons who share its religious tenets; and (4) is a nonprofit organization described\n\nin section 6033(a)(1) and section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the [Internal Revenue]\n\nCode.” Id. The cited sections “refer to churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and\n\nconventions or associations of churches, as well as the exclusively religious activities of\n\n       5\n         The exception for grandfathered plans is temporary and transitional. A health\nplan loses its grandfathered status—and is subject to the Mandate—when it eliminates\nbenefits, increases cost sharing requirements, or changes the terms of employer\ncontributions. See 45 C.F.R. § 147.140(g). In 2011, 56 percent of individuals who\nreceive health care from their employer were covered by grandfathered plans; in 2014,\nonly 26 percent were covered by grandfathered plans. See Kaiser Family Foundation &\nHealth Research & Educational Trust, Employer Health Benefits: 2014 Annual Survey, 7\n(2014), http://files.kff.org/attachment/2014-employer-health-benefits-survey-full-report.\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fany religious order.” Id. The Departments noted the definition was intended “to\n\nreasonably balance the extension of any coverage of contraceptive services under the\n\nHRSA Guidelines to as many women as possible, while respecting the unique\n\nrelationship between certain religious employers and their employees in certain religious\n\npositions.” Id.6 They invited comments on the proposed definition of “religious\n\nemployer” and potential alternatives. Id.\n\n       The Departments received more than 200,000 responses to their request for\n\ncomments from a variety of entities both supporting and opposing expansion of the\n\nproposed exemption. See Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to\n\nCoverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\n\n77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8726 (Feb. 15, 2012). After reviewing these comments, they\n\npublished final regulations on February 15, 2012, adopting their proposed definition of\n\n“religious employer.” Id. at 8727. They also created a one-year safe harbor for religious\n\nnon-profit organizations, during which the Departments would not enforce the Mandate\n\nagainst them. Id. at 8728.\n\n2. The Accommodation Scheme for Religious Non-Profit Organizations\n\n       In response to religious groups that were dissatisfied with the scope of the\n\nproposed religious employer exemption, the Departments issued an advance notice of\n\n       6\n        A number of states have laws that require employers to cover contraceptive\nservices but excuse some religious employers from complying. The Departments\ndeveloped their definition to accord with these existing state laws. See 76 Fed. Reg. at\n46,623.\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fproposed rulemaking (“ANPRM”) in anticipation of creating additional accommodations\n\nfor non-exempt religious non-profit organizations. Certain Preventive Services Under the\n\nAffordable Care Act, 77 Fed. Reg. 16,501 (Mar. 21, 2012). After reviewing the\n\ncomments received from the ANPRM, the Departments published proposed rules\n\ncreating an accommodation for a wider range of religious non-profit organizations.\n\nCoverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 78 Fed. Reg.\n\n8456 (Feb. 6, 2013).\n\n       The Departments received over 400,000 comments on the proposed rules, and\n\nfinalized two notable changes. Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the\n\nAffordable Care Act, 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870, 39,871 (July 2, 2013). First, the Departments\n\nsimplified and clarified the existing exemption for religious employers by eliminating the\n\nfirst three elements of the definition, thereby defining “religious employer” as “an\n\nemployer that is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is referred to in section\n\n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the [Internal Revenue] Code [(“IRC”)].” Id. at 39,874.\n\nSecond, they created an accommodation for religious non-profit organizations that did\n\nnot meet this simplified definition of a religious employer. Id.\n\n       The regulations state a religious non-profit organization can receive this\n\naccommodation if it: (1) has religious objections to “providing coverage for some or all\n\nof the contraceptive services required to be covered” under the Mandate, (2) “is\n\norganized and operates as a nonprofit entity,” (3) “holds itself out as a religious\n\norganization,” and (4) “self-certifies that it satisfies the first three criteria.” Id. The\n\n                                              -8-\n\faccommodation is available for both (1) insured group health plans, under which an\n\nemployer contracts with a health insurance issuer to assume the risk of providing benefits\n\nto employees, and (2) self-insured group health plans, under which the employer itself\n\nassumes the risk of providing benefits to employees. Id. at 39,875-80.7 As we explain\n\nbelow, religious non-profit organizations can self-certify their religious objection and\n\nreceive the accommodation either by notifying their health insurance issuer or TPA or by\n\nnotifying HHS directly.\n\n             a. EBSA Form 700\n\n       To self-certify under the accommodation scheme, the Departments initially\n\nrequired religious non-profit organizations to use the Employee Benefits Security\n\nAdministration’s (“EBSA”) Form 700 (“Form”).8 Objecting organizations are relieved\n\nfrom complying with the Mandate by delivering the executed Form to their health\n\ninsurance issuer or TPA. The Form notifies the health insurance issuer or TPA that the\n\norganization self-certifies as exempt from the Mandate because it has a religious\n\nobjection to providing coverage for some or all contraceptive services to its employees,\n\nand identifies the relevant federal regulations under which the organization is permitted\n\nto opt out of that obligation. See Dep’t of Labor, EBSA Form 700 (Aug. 2014),\n\n       7\n        Employers with self-insured group health plans typically employ a TPA to\ncoordinate logistics and deliver benefits. Cong. Budget Office, Key Issues in Analyzing\nMajor Health Insurance Proposals, 6 (Dec. 2008),\nhttp://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/12-18-keyissues.pdf.\n       8\n           A copy of the Form appears at the end of this opinion.\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\fhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/preventiveserviceseligibleorganizationcertificationform.doc\n\n(citing 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(a); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(a); 45 C.F.R.\n\n§ 147.131(b)).\n\n       The back of the Form notifies TPAs of their obligations.9 Form at 2. It informs\n\nthe TPA that the eligible organization “[w]ill not act as the plan administrator or claims\n\nadministrator with respect to claims for contraceptive services, or contribute to the\n\nfunding of contraceptive services.” Form at 2. It identifies regulations requiring the TPA\n\nto provide contraceptive coverage without cost sharing to plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries if the TPA agrees to continue providing administrative services for a group\n\nhealth plan. Id. (citing 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A; 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16; 29 C.F.R. §\n\n2590.715-2713A). A TPA that receives the Form from an objecting employer is eligible\n\nfor a government payment to cover the costs of providing contraceptive coverage. See 45\n\nC.F.R. § 156.50(d)(5).\n\n       As part of this scheme, the regulations initially included a non-interference\n\nprovision, which specified that objecting religious non-profit organizations “must not,\n\ndirectly or indirectly, seek to influence the third party administrator’s decision” whether\n\nto provide coverage for contraceptives. 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(b)(iii) (2013).\n\nWhen the Plaintiffs filed their suits, they sought a preliminary injunction relieving them\n\n\n       9\n        The notice of regulatory requirements on the back of the Form is specifically\naddressed to TPAs. See Form at 2. The legal obligations of health insurance issuers are\nevident from the text of the ACA itself. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13.\n\n\n                                           - 10 -\n\ffrom complying with this version of the accommodation scheme, arguing delivery of the\n\nForm to their health insurance issuer or TPA constituted a substantial burden on their\n\nreligious exercise in violation of RFRA and the First Amendment.\n\n            b. Alternative notice\n\n       In response to litigation by Plaintiffs and others, the Departments have since\n\nexpanded the accommodation scheme.10 The Supreme Court granted injunctions pending\n\nappeal in two suits brought by religious non-profit organizations, including the Little\n\nSisters, that objected to the accommodation scheme. See Wheaton Coll. v. Burwell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2806</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014); Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged, Denver, Colo. v.\n\nSebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1022</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014). In a third suit, the Court declined to recall or stay a\n\ncircuit court mandate in favor of the Government, but granted an injunction to religious\n\nnon-profit organizations pending final disposition of their petition for certiorari. See\n\nZubik v. Burwell, Nos. 14A1065, 14-1418, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3947586</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (U.S. June 29,\n\n2015). The injunctions allowed the organizations to notify HHS directly of their religious\n\nobjection to the Mandate rather than sending the Form to their health insurance issuers or\n\nTPAs. In response to the injunction in Wheaton College, the Departments issued an\n\ninterim final rule on August 27, 2014, creating an alternative accommodation for\n\nreligious non-profit organizations. Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the\n\n       10\n          As we explain in this section, the Departments did not expand the pool of actors\nwho could claim an accommodation and obtain relief from the Mandate. They expanded\nthe accommodation scheme by offering objecting organizations an alternative method of\nself-certification.\n\n\n                                            - 11 -\n\fAffordable Care Act, 79 Fed. Reg. 51,092, 51,092 (Aug. 27, 2014).11\n\n       These regulations relieve a religious non-profit organization from complying with\n\nthe Mandate if it notifies HHS in writing of its religious objection to the provision of\n\nsome or all contraceptive services. Id. at 51,094. The notice may be sent by letter or\n\nemail, and must contain (1) “the name of the eligible organization and the basis on which\n\nit qualifies for an accommodation,” (2) “its objection based on sincerely held religious\n\nbeliefs to providing coverage of some or all contraceptive services,” including any\n\nparticular subset to which it objects; (3) the name and type of the group health plan; and\n\n(4) the name and contact information for any of the plan’s TPAs and/or health insurance\n\nissuers. Id. at 51,094-95. According to the Departments, these requirements constitute\n\n“the minimum information necessary for the Departments to determine which entities are\n\ncovered by the accommodation, to administer the accommodation, and to implement the\n\n\n       11\n          We discuss the procedural history of the cases before us below, but note that this\nalternative accommodation is akin to the accommodation granted by the Supreme Court\nin the cases mentioned above—Little Sisters, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To\n       meet the condition for injunction pending appeal, the applicant need not use\n       the form prescribed by the Government, EBSA Form 700, and need not\n       send copies to health insurance issuers or third-party administrators.\n\nWheaton Coll., 134 S.

Id.12\n\n       We note again that the entirety of this accommodation scheme for religious non-\n\nprofit organizations—using either the Form or the alternative notice to HHS—was not\n\navailable to the for-profit corporate plaintiff in Hobby Lobby. Here, an accommodation is\n\navailable to Plaintiffs. In the cases before us, we consider whether their taking advantage\n\nof that accommodation to opt out of the Mandate is itself a substantial burden on their\n\nreligious exercise.\n\n3. The Mechanics of the Accommodation for Insured Plans, Self-Insured Plans, and\n   Self-Insured Church Plans\n\n       The Plaintiffs use different types of employer-sponsored group health plans, which\n\nthe Departments treat differently within the accommodation scheme. By its own terms,\n\n       12\n            The regulations explain the rationale for this change:\n\n       The Departments interpret the July 2013 final regulations solely as\n       prohibiting the use of bribery, threats, or other forms of economic coercion\n       in an attempt to prevent a third party administrator from fulfilling its\n       independent legal obligations to provide or arrange separate payments for\n       contraceptive services. Because such conduct is generally unlawful and is\n       prohibited under other state and federal laws, and to reduce unnecessary\n       confusion, these interim final regulations delete the language prohibiting an\n       eligible organization from interfering with or seeking to influence a third\n       party administrator’s decision or efforts to provide separate payments for\n       contraceptive services.\n\n79 Fed. Reg. at 51,095.\n\n\n                                              - 13 -\n\fthe ACA obligates both group health plans and health insurance issuers to provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage. 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13 (“A group health plan and a health\n\ninsurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall, at a\n\nminimum provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements\n\nfor . . . with respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings . . . as\n\nprovided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and\n\nServices Administration for purposes of this paragraph.”); 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n2713(a)(1); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713(a)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1). Because the\n\ndifferences among these arrangements are relevant to our discussion of the merits of\n\nPlaintiffs’ claims, we consider it helpful to explain how the Mandate and accommodation\n\nscheme affect insured plans, self-insured plans, and self-insured church plans.\n\n          a. Insured plans\n\n       When a religious non-profit organization offers its employees an insured plan, the\n\nstatutory language not only requires the group health plan to cover contraception, but also\n\nobligates the plan’s health insurance issuer to ensure plan participants and beneficiaries\n\nreceive contraceptive coverage. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 300gg-13; 300gg-22. Thus, even if a\n\nreligious non-profit organization does not self-certify that it has an objection, its health\n\ninsurance issuer is obligated to provide contraceptive coverage to plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries and charge the organization for the cost.

The organization\n\ncan free itself from complying with the Mandate and paying for that coverage, however,\n\n                                             - 14 -\n\f“if the eligible organization or group health plan provides either a copy of the self-\n\ncertification to each issuer providing coverage in connection with the plan or a notice to\n\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services.” 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(c)(1); 29\n\nC.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(c)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(1). When an organization\n\nsubmits the Form expressing an objection to providing contraceptive coverage, “the\n\nissuer has sole responsibility for providing such coverage in accordance with § 147.130.”\n\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(1)(i); see also 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(c)(1)(i) (requiring\n\ncoverage in accordance with § 54.9815-2713); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(c)(1)(i)\n\n(requiring coverage in accordance with § 2590.715-2713). Similarly, when an\n\norganization notifies HHS, the Department of Labor will send a separate notification to\n\nthe organization’s issuer informing it of that notice and describing its regulatory\n\nobligations. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(1)(ii); see also 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n2713AT(c)(1)(ii); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(c)(1)(ii).\n\n       In the context of insured plans, health insurance issuers are generally responsible\n\nfor paying for contraceptive coverage when a religious non-profit organization opts out.\n\nSee 45 C.F.R. § 156.50. The Departments expect this will be cost-neutral for issuers\n\nbecause of the cost savings that accompany improvements in women’s health and lower\n\npregnancy rates. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,877.\n\n          b. Self-insured plans\n\n       When a religious non-profit organization offers its employees a self-insured plan,\n\nthe accommodation works in a slightly different fashion. A self-insured group health\n\n                                            - 15 -\n\fplan complies with the regulatory requirements and is excused from providing\n\ncontraceptive coverage if “[t]he eligible organization or its plan contracts with one or\n\nmore third party administrators” and “[t]he eligible organization provides either a copy of\n\nthe self-certification to each third party administrator or a notice to the Secretary of\n\nHealth and Human Services that it is an eligible organization and of its religious\n\nobjection to coverage of all or a subset of contraceptive services.” 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n2713AT(b)(1); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1).\n\n       Although the text of the ACA does not specify a role for TPAs, it expressly\n\nrequires group health plans to include contraceptive coverage, and federal regulations\n\nimpose obligations on TPAs that administer self-insured group health plans. See 42\n\nU.S.C. § 300gg-13; 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(b); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b).\n\nThe regulations require a TPA administering a group health plan to provide or arrange for\n\ncontraceptive coverage without cost sharing with the organization or its beneficiaries\n\nwhen it: (1) receives a notification that an eligible employer has opted out of providing\n\ncoverage and (2) decides to remain in a relationship with that employer or its plan to\n\nprovide administrative services for the plan. 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(b)(2); 29\n\nC.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2). The TPA’s obligations are enforceable under the\n\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”). See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,879-80.\n\n       In the context of self-insured plans, a TPA may seek reimbursement if it has\n\nreceived the Form or a notification from the government and “provides or arranges\n\npayments for contraceptive services.” See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(b)(3); 29 C.F.R.\n\n                                            - 16 -\n\f§ 2590.715-2713A(b)(3); 45 C.F.R. § 156.50(d)(2)(ii)-(iii). TPAs do so by working\n\nthrough health insurance issuers, who receive adjustments to fees they pay to the\n\ngovernment under the ACA and pass along the reimbursements to TPAs. See 45 C.F.R.\n\n§ 156.50(d).\n\n           c. Self-insured church plans\n\n       Although federal regulations impose certain requirements on TPAs, the\n\nDepartments concede they lack authority to enforce those requirements as to self-insured\n\n“church plans,” which are group health plans established by a church or association of\n\nchurches covering the church’s or association’s employees. 29 U.S.C. § 1002(33).\n\nOrganizations that provide health care coverage for employees through self-insured\n\nchurch plans are exempt from regulation under ERISA. 29 U.S.C. § 1003(b)(2). Unless\n\na church plan has made an election under 26 U.S.C. § 410(d), which opts plans into\n\nprovisions of ERISA, the Departments concede they lack authority to compel church plan\n\nTPAs to provide contraceptive coverage, and may not levy fines against those TPAs for\n\nfailing to provide it.\n\n           d. Legal obligation to provide coverage after the accommodation\n\n       Although the accommodation is available for both insured and self-insured group\n\nhealth plans, the source of the legal obligation to provide contraceptive coverage after a\n\nreligious non-profit organization has opted out differs based on the type of insurance\n\narrangement the organization uses. When an organization takes advantage of the\n\naccommodation, the ACA requires health insurance issuers to provide coverage for\n\n                                           - 17 -\n\finsured group health plans, while federal regulations adopted pursuant to the ACA\n\nrequire TPAs to arrange coverage for self-insured group plans that are subject to ERISA.\n\nAs we discuss below, these distinctions shape the claims advanced by different Plaintiffs\n\nin the cases before us.\n\n                                    B. The Plaintiffs\n\n       The Plaintiffs13 in this litigation object to both means to receive an\n\naccommodation—sending the Form to their health insurance issuer or TPA or sending a\n\nnotification to HHS. The Plaintiffs differ from each other in ways that are relevant to the\n\nDepartments’ authority to require employers to provide contraceptive coverage and\n\nrelieve objecting religious non-profit organizations from the Mandate when they use the\n\naccommodation scheme.\n\n1. Little Sisters of the Poor\n\n       The Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged, Denver, Colorado and Little\n\nSisters of the Poor, Baltimore (“Little Sisters”) belong to an order of Catholic nuns who\n\ndevote their lives to care for the elderly. The Little Sisters provide health insurance\n\ncoverage to their employees through the Christian Brothers Employee Benefit Trust\n\n(“Trust”), a self-insured church plan that is not subject to ERISA. The Trust uses\n\nChristian Brothers Services (“Christian Brothers”), another Catholic organization, as its\n\nTPA.\n\n       13\n          When we refer to the plaintiffs in all three cases collectively, we use\n“Plaintiffs.” When we refer to a subset of the plaintiffs, we use “plaintiffs.”\n\n\n                                            - 18 -\n\f       The Little Sisters have always excluded coverage of sterilization, contraception,\n\nand abortifacients from their health care plan in accordance with their religious belief that\n\ndeliberately avoiding reproduction through medical means is immoral. The Little Sisters\n\n“believe that it is wrong for them to intentionally facilitate the provision of these medical\n\nprocedures, drugs, devices, and related counseling and services.” LS Br. at 10. They cite\n\n“well-established Catholic teaching that prohibits encouraging, supporting, or partnering\n\nwith others in the provision of sterilization, contraception, and abortion.” LS Br. at 9-10.\n\nThe Little Sisters contend they “cannot provide these things, take actions that directly\n\ncause others to provide them, or otherwise appear to participate in the government’s\n\ndelivery scheme,” as the mere appearance of condoning these services “would violate\n\ntheir public witness to the sanctity of human life and human dignity and could mislead\n\nother Catholics and the public.” LS Br. at 10.\n\n       The Little Sisters are subject to the Mandate unless they take advantage of the\n\naccommodation scheme by delivering the Form to the Christian Brothers, their TPA, or\n\nnotifying HHS of their religious objection. If they do not take one of these steps and do\n\nnot provide contraceptive coverage, they estimate a single Little Sisters home could incur\n\npenalties of up to $2.5 million per year, and allege the Trust could lose up to $130 million\n\nin plan contributions. The Little Sisters plaintiffs object that the accommodation scheme\n\nviolates their sincerely held religious beliefs because they cannot take actions that\n\ndirectly cause others to provide contraception or appear to participate in the Departments’\n\ndelivery scheme.\n\n                                            - 19 -\n\f2. Southern Nazarene\n\n       Southern Nazarene University, Oklahoma Wesleyan University, Oklahoma Baptist\n\nUniversity, and Mid-America Christian University are “Christ-centered institutions of\n\nhigher learning.” SN Br. at 1-2. Southern Nazarene is partially self-insured; it generally\n\nassumes the risks of providing coverage but contracts with a health insurance issuer to\n\npay all claims over $100,000. For its insured employee coverage, it uses Blue Cross Blue\n\nShield of Oklahoma. It offers separate coverage to students through an insured plan.\n\nOklahoma Baptist is an insured university. It uses Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma,\n\nand offers separate coverage to students through an insured plan. Oklahoma Wesleyan is\n\nan insured university. It uses Community Care of Oklahoma. Mid-America Christian is\n\na self-insured university on a church plan that is not subject to ERISA. It uses plans\n\nprovided by GuideStone Financial Resources.14\n\n\n\n       14\n         The descriptions of Mid-America Christian’s insurance arrangements in the\nrecord before us are inconsistent. Before the district court, counsel described Mid-\nAmerica Christian’s plan as “insured by GuideStone,” App. in SN at A32, and suggested\nit would be obligated, like Oklahoma Baptist and Oklahoma Wesleyan, to deliver the\nForm to its health insurance issuer to opt out of the Mandate. In its opening brief on\nappeal, counsel described Mid-America Christian’s plan as “self-insured,” and suggested\nit would be obligated, like Southern Nazarene, to deliver the Form to its TPA. SN Br. at\n2, 18. In a supplemental brief and at oral argument, counsel now indicates Mid-America\nChristian has a self-insured church plan and is more akin to the Reaching Souls plaintiffs.\nSN Supp. Br. II at 9 n.2; Oral Arg. in SN at 20:24-20:32.\n       We treat Mid-America Christian’s plan as a self-insured church plan. The parties\nin Southern Nazarene stipulated as fact that Mid-America Christian’s group health plan is\nprovided by GuideStone Financial Resources. Southern Nazarene, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6804265</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n*2. Because we understand GuideStone Financial Resources to be a sponsor of self-\ninsured church plans and not an insurer, we assume the latest characterization on appeal\n                                                                              Continued . . .\n                                           - 20 -\n\f       The universities have brought suit collectively, but they are in slightly different\n\npositions insofar as Mid-America Christian University uses a church plan and contracts\n\nwith a TPA, Oklahoma Baptist University and Oklahoma Wesleyan use health insurance\n\nissuers, and Southern Nazarene contracts with a TPA but uses a health insurance issuer\n\nfor student coverage and employee claims above $100,000.\n\n       The universities believe “it would be sinful and immoral for them to participate in,\n\npay for, facilitate, enable, or otherwise support access to abortion, abortion-inducing\n\ndrugs and devices, and related counseling.” SN Br. at 1-2. They object to the provision\n\nof contraceptives they consider abortifacients. The universities currently offer health\n\nplans to students and employees that do not cover the contraceptives the universities find\n\nobjectionable.\n\n       The universities are subject to the Mandate, but they may take advantage of the\n\naccommodation scheme by delivering the Form or notifying HHS of their religious\n\nobjections to relieve themselves of the obligation to provide contraceptive coverage.\n\nThey object to the accommodation, however, because they believe it requires them to\n\nexpressly or functionally offer contraceptive coverage through their group health plan,\n\ninterferes with the spiritual development of their communities, and requires them to\n\nfacilitate behavior they consider sinful. If they do not take advantage of the\n\n______________________________________\nCont.\n\nis correct and treat Mid-America Christian’s group health plan as a self-insured church\nplan that is not subject to ERISA.\n\n                                            - 21 -\n\faccommodation, each university must either provide coverage or incur penalties of $100\n\nper employee per day.\n\n3. Reaching Souls\n\n       Reaching Souls is a non-profit corporation founded by a Southern Baptist minister\n\nand based in Oklahoma. The organization trains pastors and evangelists and provides\n\ncare to orphans in Africa, India, and Cuba. Truett-McConnell College is a private liberal\n\narts college based in Georgia. Both Reaching Souls and Truett-McConnell use the\n\nGuideStone Plan, a self-insured church plan that is not subject to ERISA. GuideStone\n\nFinancial Resources, a Texas non-profit corporation, established the GuideStone Plan and\n\nholds the assets funding it in trust. GuideStone Financial Resources has entered into\n\nagreements with other entities to provide claims administration as TPAs under the\n\nGuideStone Plan, including Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, Highmark\n\nHealth Services, and Express Scripts, Inc.\n\n       Reaching Souls believes life begins at conception and objects to four of the twenty\n\nFDA-approved methods of contraception that Reaching Souls characterizes as\n\nabortifacients. Truett-McConnell has adopted the Southern Baptist Convention’s\n\nstatement of faith and objects to the same four methods of contraception. GuideStone\n\nFinancial Resources, as an arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, also opposes\n\ncoverage of contraception methods it believes to be abortifacients. The organizations\n\nground their beliefs in the sanctity of human life and opposition to elective abortion in the\n\nreligious teachings of the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\n                                             - 22 -\n\f       Both Reaching Souls and Truett-McConnell College are subject to the Mandate,\n\nbut they may take advantage of the accommodation scheme by delivering the Form or\n\nnotifying HHS of their religious objections. If they do, GuideStone Financial Resources\n\nwould have to pass the information to the TPAs of the GuideStone Plan to effectuate the\n\ncoverage. The plaintiffs believe this would violate their religious beliefs “by making\n\nthem complicit in the government’s scheme to provide abortifacients.” RS Br. at 4. If\n\nthe organizations do not take advantage of the accommodation scheme or provide\n\ncoverage, they contend they will incur millions of dollars in fines, which “would crush\n\nthe ministries and force a mass exodus from GuideStone.” RS Br. at 3.\n\n                                 C. Procedural History\n\n       The district courts reached different results in the three cases before us, denying a\n\npreliminary injunction to the plaintiffs in Little Sisters but granting a preliminary\n\ninjunction to the plaintiffs in Southern Nazarene and Reaching Souls. Reviewing the\n\nreasoning behind their determinations clarifies the claims before us on appeal.\n\n1. Little Sisters of the Poor\n\n       In Little Sisters, the district court determined that complying with the\n\naccommodation scheme would not impose a substantial burden on the Little Sisters’ or\n\nChristian Brothers’ religious exercise. 6 F. Supp. 3d at 1239-45. The court’s analysis of\n\nthe preliminary injunction factors began and ended by examining whether the plaintiffs\n\nwould suffer irreparable injury if the requested relief were denied. Id. at 1236. After\n\ndetermining it was the court’s duty to determine how the regulations operate as a matter\n\n                                            - 23 -\n\fof law, id. at 1239, the court concluded the accommodation scheme does not require the\n\nLittle Sisters to provide contraceptive coverage or to participate in the provision of\n\ncontraceptive coverage, id. at 1239-42.\n\n       The court noted that the Little Sisters—unlike the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby—\n\ncould be relieved of the obligation to provide coverage by signing and delivering the\n\nForm to their TPA, the Christian Brothers. Id. at 1237.15 The court underscored that,\n\nwhile the Departments could require the Little Sisters to sign and deliver the Form to\n\ntheir TPA to avoid the Mandate, the Departments lacked enforcement authority under\n\nERISA to levy fines or otherwise force the Christian Brothers to provide contraceptive\n\ncoverage as the TPA for a self-insured, ERISA-exempt church plan. Id. at 1243-44. The\n\ncourt concluded that requiring the Little Sisters to sign and deliver the Form to opt out\n\ndid not constitute a substantial burden on their religious exercise and declined to issue a\n\npreliminary injunction. Id. at 1242-45.\n\n       The Little Sisters next asked the Tenth Circuit for an injunction pending appeal,\n\nwhich this court denied. The Supreme Court subsequently granted their request for an\n\ninjunction pending appeal, allowing the Little Sisters to notify HHS of their religious\n\nobjection instead of sending the Form to their TPA as the regulations at the time required.\n\n       15\n          At the time the district courts decided all three of the cases before us, the interim\nfinal rules allowing Plaintiffs to opt out by notifying HHS of their religious objection had\nnot yet been issued. The district court decisions therefore focus on the Form and do not\nconsider the expanded accommodation scheme in August 2014’s interim final rules. In\nsupplemental briefing to this court, the Plaintiffs argue the expanded scheme does not\nadequately address the religious liberty concerns they have raised in this litigation.\n\n\n                                            - 24 -\n\fSee Little Sisters, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1022</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The Little Sisters now appeal the district court’s\n\ndenial of a preliminary injunction.\n\n2. Southern Nazarene\n\n       In Southern Nazarene, the district court granted a preliminary injunction to the\n\nplaintiffs. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6804265</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *11. The court’s analysis focused mainly on the\n\nplaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits.16 Id. at *7-10. The court characterized the\n\nForm as “in effect, a permission slip which must be signed by the institution to enable the\n\nplan beneficiary to get access, free of charge, from the institution’s insurer or third party\n\nadministrator, to the products to which the institution objects.” Id. at *8. It determined\n\nthe Form imposed a substantial burden on the plaintiffs’ sincere religious exercise and the\n\nGovernment had not articulated a compelling state interest or argued its approach was the\n\nleast restrictive means of advancing that interest. Id. at *7-10.\n\n\n\n\n       16\n           The district court noted that, unlike in the recently decided Priests for Life, 7 F.\nSupp. 3d 88, the parties in Southern Nazarene “stipulated that the act of signing the\ncertification is contrary to the religious beliefs to which these institutions subscribe.”\nSouthern Nazarene, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6804265</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8. The court’s characterization paraphrases\nthe stipulation, which addresses only the litigation position taken by the Southern\nNazarene plaintiffs. The parties specifically stipulated: “The Universities believe that,\nwithin the operation of the regulations, completing and delivering the self-certification to\ntheir issuers or third party administrators would violate the Universities’ sincere religious\nbeliefs.” Id. at *5. The Government accepts that the Southern Nazarene plaintiffs take\nthe position that completing the self-certification would violate their religious beliefs—a\nfairly straightforward characterization of their litigation position—but has never\nconceded that completing the self-certification actually would violate their religious\nbeliefs.\n\n\n                                             - 25 -\n\f       The court concluded the plaintiffs had shown they were likely to succeed on the\n\nmerits. Id. After reaching this conclusion, it briefly reviewed the other preliminary\n\ninjunction factors and entered a preliminary injunction that prevented the Departments\n\nfrom enforcing the Mandate, requiring self-certification to opt out, or levying penalties.\n\nId. at *10-11. The Government now appeals the district court’s ruling.\n\n3. Reaching Souls\n\n       Like the district court in Southern Nazarene, the district court in Reaching Souls\n\ngranted a preliminary injunction to the plaintiffs. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6804259</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8. The court\n\nprimarily analyzed the likelihood of plaintiffs’ success on the merits. Id. at *6-8. It\n\ncharacterized the Government’s substantial burden argument as “simply another variation\n\nof a proposition rejected by the court of appeals in Hobby Lobby,” likening it to the\n\nargument that the Mandate was not a substantial burden on for-profit employers because\n\nit required intervening acts by third parties—employees deciding whether to acquire\n\ncontraception. Id. at *7. It emphasized that regardless of whether the Form actually\n\ntriggers the provision of contraceptive services, the plaintiffs believe that signing it would\n\nsignal their tacit support or cooperation. Id.\n\n       The court thus determined “the accommodation scheme applies substantial\n\npressure on Plaintiffs to violate their belief that participating in or facilitating the\n\naccommodation is the moral equivalent of directly complying with the contraceptive\n\nmandate.” Id. at *8. It briefly reviewed the other preliminary injunction factors and\n\nenjoined the Government from requiring the plaintiffs to comply with the Mandate and\n\n                                              - 26 -\n\faccommodation scheme or penalizing the plaintiffs for noncompliance. Id. The\n\nGovernment now appeals the district court’s ruling.\n\n                IV. UNUSUAL NATURE OF PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIM\n\n       Before we present our analysis of the issues, we wish to highlight the unusual\n\nnature of Plaintiffs’ central claim, which attacks the Government’s attempt to\n\naccommodate religious exercise by providing a means to opt out of compliance with a\n\ngenerally applicable law.\n\n       Most religious liberty claimants allege that a generally applicable law or policy\n\nwithout a religious exception burdens religious exercise, and they ask courts to strike\n\ndown the law or policy or excuse them from compliance. Our circuit’s three most recent\n\nRFRA cases fall into this category. In Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1114</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 2013) (en banc), aff’d sub nom.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2751</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the ACA\n\nrequired the plaintiffs to provide their employees with health insurance coverage of\n\ncontraceptives against their religious beliefs. In Yellowbear v. Lampert, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">741</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(10th Cir. 2014), a prison policy denied the plaintiff access to a sweat lodge, where he\n\nwished to exercise his Native American religion.

Hobbs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2771249\"><a href=\"/opinion/2771249/holt-v-hobbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015), which\n\nconcerned a prison ban on inmates’ growing beards, is another recent example of the\n\n                                           - 27 -\n\fmore common RFRA claim. The plaintiff in Holt sought to grow a beard in accordance\n\nwith his Muslim faith. In Holt, like in Hobby Lobby, the government defendants insisted\n\non a complete restriction and did not attempt to accommodate the plaintiff’s religious\n\nexercise. The plaintiff in Holt proposed a compromise—he would be allowed to grow\n\nonly a half-inch beard—which the prison refused. 135 S. Ct. at 861. The Court\n\nultimately approved this compromise in its ruling. Id. at 867.\n\n       In the cases before us, by contrast, the Departments have developed a religious\n\naccommodation rather than leaving it for the courts to fashion judicial relief. Plaintiffs\n\nnot only challenge a law that requires them to provide contraceptive coverage against\n\ntheir religious beliefs, they challenge the exception that the law affords to them. The\n\nprecedents Plaintiffs cite are instructive in some respects, but none of them involve a\n\nsituation where the government offers religious objectors an accommodation.17 The\n\nSupreme Court and this circuit have suggested such accommodations might have\n\neliminated or lessened burdens we otherwise deemed substantial. See, e.g., Hobby\n\nLobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2759 (observing the accommodation scheme “constitutes an\n\n       17\n          The accommodation adds an additional consideration that makes this unlike the\ntypical RFRA case. In Hobby Lobby, Yellowbear, Abdulhaseeb, and Holt, the\ngovernment either required or prohibited acts of religious significance to the plaintiffs. In\nthe cases before us, the government has freed Plaintiffs from the responsibility to perform\nthe act they consider religiously objectionable—namely, providing contraceptive\ncoverage. Nonetheless, the Plaintiffs argue an act they do not consider objectionable in\nitself—completing a form or writing to HHS—becomes objectionable because it either\ncauses the provision of contraceptive coverage or renders them complicit in the provision\nof contraceptive coverage. Therefore, unlike the aforementioned cases, we are in the\nslightly different position of considering whether an otherwise unobjectionable act,\nunderstood in context, constitutes a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise.\n\n                                           - 28 -\n\falternative that achieves all of the Government’s aims while providing greater respect for\n\nreligious liberty”); Yellowbear, 741 F.3d at 56 (underscoring that the case “isn’t a\n\nsituation where the claimant is left with some degree of choice in the matter and we have\n\nto inquire into the degree of the government’s coercive influence on that choice”). Until\n\nnow, however, we have not squarely considered a RFRA challenge to a religious\n\naccommodation.\n\n       The closest Tenth Circuit case we have found is United States v. Friday, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"170693\"><a href=\"/opinion/170693/united-states-v-friday/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 2008), in which defendant Winslow Friday argued his conviction for\n\nshooting a bald eagle without a permit violated RFRA because he shot the eagle for use\n\nin a tribal religious ceremony. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act forbids killing\n\na bald eagle, but an applicant can obtain a permit to “take” a live eagle for a religious\n\nceremony. See 16 U.S.C. §§ 668, 668a. We recognized the potential question of\n\n“whether it substantially burdens Mr. Friday’s religion to require him to obtain a permit\n\nin advance of taking an eagle.” Friday, 525 F.3d at 947. We said we were “skeptical that\n\nthe bare requirement of obtaining a permit can be regarded as a ‘substantial burden’\n\nunder RFRA,” id., but Mr. Friday did not make that specific argument, and we decided\n\nthe permit accommodation otherwise met RFRA’s strict scrutiny element, id. at 948.\n\n       We spoke favorably of the government’s accommodation scheme in Friday, even\n\nthough “[t]hat accommodation may be more burdensome than the [religious objectors]\n\nwould prefer, and may sometimes subordinate their interests to other policies not of their\n\nchoosing.” Id. at 960. As we noted in conclusion: “Law accommodates religion; it\n\n                                            - 29 -\n\fcannot wholly exempt religion from the reach of the law.” Id. We therefore turn to\n\nuncharted Tenth Circuit terrain.\n\n                                         * * * *\n\n       The Plaintiffs in the three cases before us assert claims against the Mandate and\n\naccommodation scheme under RFRA and the First Amendment’s Free Exercise,\n\nEstablishment, and Free Speech Clauses.18 Because we determine the accommodation\n\nscheme relieves Plaintiffs from complying with the Mandate and does not substantially\n\nburden their religious exercise under RFRA or infringe upon their First Amendment\n\nrights, we affirm the district court’s denial of a preliminary injunction to the plaintiffs in\n\nLittle Sisters and reverse the district courts’ grants of a preliminary injunction to the\n\nplaintiffs in Southern Nazarene and Reaching Souls.\n\n                                         V. RFRA\n\n       Under RFRA, the government “shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise\n\nof religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability” unless “it\n\ndemonstrates that application of the burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance of a\n\ncompelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that\n\ncompelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue the ACA and its implementing regulations violate RFRA because\n\n\n       18\n          We refer to “Plaintiffs” throughout the discussion, but in the First Amendment\ncontext, “Plaintiffs” refers only to the plaintiffs in Little Sisters and Reaching Souls. See\ninfra note 51.\n\n\n                                             - 30 -\n\fthey substantially burden their religious exercise by forcing them to do one of three\n\nthings: (a) comply with the Mandate and provide contraceptive coverage, (b) take\n\nadvantage of the accommodation scheme, or (c) pay steep fines for non-compliance.19\n\nWe conclude that the accommodation scheme relieves Plaintiffs of complying with the\n\nMandate or paying fines and does not impose a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ religious\n\nexercise for the purposes of RFRA.\n\n       To explain why the accommodation is permissible under RFRA, we first review\n\nthe RFRA framework and consider how religious accommodations may lessen or\n\neliminate the substantiality of a burden on religious exercise. We then apply this\n\nframework to the accommodation scheme before us, which exempts religious non-profits\n\n\n       19\n          The Government identifies a fourth option: by declining to sponsor a group\nhealth plan, Plaintiffs could avoid complying with the Mandate, using the\naccommodation, or paying the fines. The Government frames the Plaintiffs’ provision of\nhealth insurance as an economic expenditure, and notes that regulations may make a\nbusiness activity more expensive or onerous without violating the freedom of religion.\nSee Tony & Susan Alamo Found. v. Sec. of Labor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111417\"><a href=\"/opinion/111417/tony-and-susan-alamo-foundation-v-secretary-of-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 303-05 (1985);\nBraunfeld v.

Ct. at\n2777. Plaintiffs respond that they consider the provision of health insurance a religious\nobligation, not merely an economic expenditure. Plaintiffs “believe they have a religious\nobligation to care for the employees who join in their ministry, and they cannot throw\nthose people off their insurance policies without violating that obligation and harming\ntheir ministry.” LS Reply Br. at 8.\n        Because we determine the accommodation scheme is not a substantial burden, we\nneed not decide whether this fourth option constitutes a substantial burden on religious\nexercise—or, if it does, whether it survives strict scrutiny.\n        For similar reasons, we need not address the safe harbor provision detailed in the\nJune 2013 regulations, which indicates organizations with self-insured group health plans\nthat bring administration of their plans in-house and thereby do not use third-party\nadministrators currently are not subject to enforcement of the contraceptive coverage\nrequirement. 78 Fed.

The accommodation relieves Plaintiffs from complying with the\n\nMandate and guarantees they will not have to provide, pay for, or facilitate contraceptive\n\ncoverage. Plaintiffs do not “trigger” or otherwise cause contraceptive coverage because\n\nfederal law, not the act of opting out, entitles plan participants and beneficiaries to\n\ncoverage. Although Plaintiffs allege the administrative tasks required to opt out of the\n\nMandate make them complicit in the overall delivery scheme, opting out instead relieves\n\nthem from complicity. Furthermore, these de minimis administrative tasks do not\n\nsubstantially burden religious exercise for the purposes of RFRA.\n\n       The dissent parts ways with our majority opinion on the self-insured plaintiffs’\n\nRFRA claims. It stresses that, by opting out, the self-insured plaintiffs would cause the\n\nlegal responsibility to provide contraceptive coverage to shift to their TPAs.20 We agree.\n\nAs we observe below, the regulations are clear on that point.21 But shifting legal\n\n\n       20\n         Plaintiffs make causation the centerpiece of their RFRA claim. They allege that\nopting out of the Mandate would cause or make them complicit in providing\ncontraceptive coverage, and thus substantially burdens their religious exercise. Much of\nour opinion assesses and ultimately rejects the merits of this claim.\n       21\n          Indeed, this is an unremarkable feature of the accommodation scheme. An opt\nout religious accommodation typically contemplates that a non-objector will replace the\nreligious objector and take over any legal responsibilities.\n\n\n\n                                            - 32 -\n\fresponsibility to provide coverage away from the plaintiffs relieves rather than burdens\n\ntheir religious exercise. The ACA and its implementing regulations entitle plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries to coverage whether or not the plaintiffs opt out. And the\n\ngovernment has established a scheme where, if the law is followed, self-insured plaintiffs\n\nthat opt out are relieved of providing, paying for, and facilitating coverage; the\n\ngovernment assigns that responsibility to their TPAs; and plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries receive the coverage to which they are entitled by federal law. Such an\n\narrangement is among the common and permissible methods of religious accommodation\n\nin a pluralist society, and does not constitute a substantial burden under RFRA.\n\n                                 A.

Smith,\n\n494 U.S. at 882-84; see also Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2792-93 (Ginsburg, J.,\n\ndissenting).

See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(b)(1).\n\n       By restoring the pre-Smith compelling interest standard, Congress did not express\n\nany intent to alter other aspects of Free Exercise jurisprudence. See id.; Hobby Lobby,\n\n723 F.3d at 1133 (“Congress, through RFRA, intended to bring Free Exercise\n\njurisprudence back to the test established before Smith. There is no indication Congress\n\nmeant to alter any other aspect of pre-Smith jurisprudence . . . .”). Notably, pre-Smith\n\njurisprudence allowed the government “wide latitude” to administer large administrative\n\nprograms, and rejected the imposition of strict scrutiny in that context. As the Supreme\n\nCourt indicated in Bowen v.

As we discuss at greater length below, the pre-Smith standards\n\nrestored by RFRA permitted the Government to impose de minimis administrative\n\nburdens on religious actors without running afoul of religious liberty guarantees.\n\n3. Elements of RFRA Analysis\n\n       RFRA analysis follows a burden-shifting framework. “[A] plaintiff establishes a\n\nprima facie claim under RFRA by proving the following three elements: (1) a substantial\n\nburden imposed by the federal government on a (2) sincere (3) exercise of religion.”\n\nKikumura v. Hurley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"160840\"><a href=\"/opinion/160840/kikumura-v-hurley/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">950</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 960 (10th Cir. 2001); see 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a).22\n\nThe burden then shifts to the government to demonstrate its law or policy advances “a\n\ncompelling interest implemented through the least restrictive means available.” Hobby\n\nLobby, 723 F.3d at 1142-43. The government must show that the “compelling interest\n\ntest is satisfied through application of the challenged law ‘to the person’—the particular\n\n\n       22\n          RFRA originally defined “exercise of religion” as “the exercise of religion\nunder the First Amendment to the Constitution.” In 1999, the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (“RLUIPA”) amended RFRA, and redefined “exercise of\nreligion” by reference to 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5(7)(A). 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-2(4). Section\n2000cc-5(7)(A) expanded the phrase to include “any exercise of religion, whether or not\ncompelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5(7)(A);\nsee Kikumura, 242 F.3d at 960.\n\n\n                                           - 35 -\n\fclaimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.” Id. at 1126\n\n(quotations and citation omitted). “This burden-shifting approach applies even at the\n\npreliminary injunction stage.” Id.\n\n       We have previously stated “a government act imposes a ‘substantial burden’ on\n\nreligious exercise if it: (1) requires participation in an activity prohibited by a sincerely\n\nheld religious belief, (2) prevents participation in conduct motivated by a sincerely held\n\nreligious belief, or (3) places substantial pressure on an adherent to engage in conduct\n\ncontrary to a sincerely held religious belief.” Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1125-26\n\n(quotations and alterations omitted); see also Yellowbear, 741 F.3d at 55 (applying this\n\nframework to RLUIPA); Abdulhaseeb, 600 F.3d at 1315 (same). As we discuss in the\n\nnext section, whether a law substantially burdens religious exercise in one or more of\n\nthese ways is a matter for courts—not plaintiffs—to decide.\n\n4. Courts Determine Substantial Burden\n\n       To determine whether plaintiffs have made a prima facie RFRA claim, courts do\n\nnot question “whether the petitioner . . . correctly perceived the commands of [his or her]\n\nfaith.” Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110440\"><a href=\"/opinion/110440/thomas-v-review-bd-of-indiana-employment-security-div/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 716 (1981); see\n\nHobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1138-40. But courts do determine whether a challenged law or\n\npolicy substantially burdens plaintiffs’ religious exercise. RFRA’s statutory text and\n\nreligious liberty case law demonstrate that courts—not plaintiffs—must determine if a\n\nlaw or policy substantially burdens religious exercise.\n\n       RFRA states the federal government “shall not substantially burden a person’s\n\n                                             - 36 -\n\fexercise of religion.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a). We must “give effect . . . to every clause\n\nand word” of a statute when possible. United States v. Menasche, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105289\"><a href=\"/opinion/105289/united-states-v-menasche/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538-39\n\n(1955). Drafts of RFRA prohibited the government from placing a “burden” on religious\n\nexercise. Congress added the word “substantially” before passage to clarify that only\n\nsome burdens would violate the act. 139 Cong. Rec. S14352 (daily ed. Oct. 26, 1993)\n\n(statements of Sen. Kennedy and Sen. Hatch).\n\n       We therefore consider not only whether a law or policy burdens religious exercise,\n\nbut whether that burden is substantial. If plaintiffs could assert and establish that a\n\nburden is “substantial” without any possibility of judicial scrutiny, the word “substantial”\n\nwould become wholly devoid of independent meaning. See Menasche, 348 U.S. at 538-\n\n39. Furthermore, accepting any burden alleged by Plaintiffs as “substantial” would\n\nimproperly conflate the determination that a religious belief is sincerely held with the\n\ndetermination that a law or policy substantially burdens religious exercise.\n\n       Every circuit that has addressed a RFRA challenge to the accommodation scheme\n\nat issue here has concluded that whether the government has imposed a “substantial\n\nburden” is a legal determination.

Furthermore, as we discuss in the following section, the\n\nexistence of an accommodation may affect whether a law or policy burdens religious\n\nexercise and whether that burden is substantial.\n\n5. Accommodations Can Lessen or Eliminate Burden\n\n       We finally note that accommodations function to lessen or eliminate the burden of\n\na generally applicable law. In Hobby Lobby, this court said the stark choice between\n\nproviding contraceptive coverage and paying steep fines constitutes a sufficiently\n\nsubstantial burden to warrant relief under RFRA. Hobby Lobby, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1114</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\nReligious objectors are not always put to such a stark choice. When, as here, plaintiffs\n\nare offered an accommodation to a law or policy that would otherwise constitute a\n\nsubstantial burden, we must analyze whether the accommodation renders the potential\n\nburden on religious exercise insubstantial or nonexistent such that the law or policy that\n\nincludes the accommodation satisfies RFRA.\n\n       Accommodations may eliminate burdens on religious exercise or reduce those\n\nburdens to de minimis acts of administrative compliance that are not substantial for\n\nRFRA purposes. The Supreme Court recognized this point in Hobby Lobby when it\n\nsuggested an accommodation to exempt the plaintiff corporations from complying with\n\nthe Mandate could satisfy RFRA concerns. Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2782 (“At a\n\n                                           - 40 -\n\fminimum, [the accommodation] does not impinge on the plaintiffs’ religious belief that\n\nproviding insurance coverage for the contraceptives at issue here violates their religion,\n\nand it serves HHS’s stated interests equally well.”); see also id. at 2786-87 (Kennedy, J.,\n\nconcurring). The D.C. Circuit observed that “[a] burden does not rise to the level of\n\nbeing substantial when it places an inconsequential or de minimis burden on an\n\nadherent’s religious exercise.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 246 (quotations, citations, and\n\nalterations omitted). Were it otherwise, our substantial burden inquiry would become a\n\nblunt tool incapable of recognizing the meaningful difference between forcing\n\norganizations to provide or pay for contraceptives and allowing them to opt out of that\n\nrequirement. To determine whether the accommodation scheme in these cases renders\n\nthe alleged burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise nonexistent or insubstantial, we turn to\n\nthe merits of Plaintiffs’ RFRA arguments.\n\n                             B. Substantial Burden Analysis\n\n1. Plaintiffs’ RFRA Arguments\n\n       The cases before us turn on whether complying with the accommodation\n\nconstitutes a substantial burden. The Government does not dispute the sincerity of\n\nPlaintiffs’ religious belief that they may not provide, pay for, or facilitate contraceptive\n\ncoverage. The parties dispute whether the accommodation scheme substantially burdens\n\nthe Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion.\n\n       Plaintiffs oppose completing the Form or notifying HHS because they believe they\n\nare being asked to play a causal role in the delivery of contraceptive coverage and would\n\n                                            - 41 -\n\fbe complicit or perceived to be complicit in the overall contraceptive delivery scheme by\n\nvirtue of their opting out. They also allege their continuing involvement in the regulatory\n\nscheme is a substantial burden.25\n\n       The Government responds that completing the Form or notification does not\n\ninvolve Plaintiffs in the delivery of contraceptive coverage. The accommodation relieves\n\nPlaintiffs of their obligations under the Mandate, and when that occurs, federal law\n\nauthorizes and obligates a health insurance issuer or TPA to provide or arrange for the\n\ndelivery of contraceptive coverage to plan participants and beneficiaries who are entitled\n\nto that coverage under the ACA. The Government therefore argues the accommodation\n\n\n       25\n          The Little Sisters and Reaching Souls plaintiffs clarify that they “have never\nobjected to merely identifying themselves so that the government can leave them alone.”\nLS Supp. Br. II at 2 n.2; RS Supp. Br. II at 2 n.2. They have expressed satisfaction with\nthe Supreme Court’s injunctions pending appeal in Little Sisters and Wheaton College.\nLS Supp. Br. II at 1-2; RS Supp. Br. II at 2, 12; Oral Arg. in LS at 12:10-12:40. They\nnevertheless object to the recent modified accommodation promulgated by the\nDepartments—the opt out letter to HHS—both because the self-certification requires\nmore information about their group health plan than the aforementioned notice the\nSupreme Court proposed, and because of the “collateral consequences” that follow after\nthey opt out. Oral Arg. in LS at 12:10-13:53.\n       The Little Sisters and Reaching Souls plaintiffs have not convincingly explained\nhow the notice to HHS promulgated by the Departments would substantially burden their\nreligious exercise but the notice crafted by the Supreme Court does not. In Wheaton\nCollege, the Supreme Court emphasized the plaintiffs had functionally notified the\nDepartments they met the necessary requirements to obtain an accommodation, and said\n“[n]othing in this order precludes the Government from relying on this notice, to the\nextent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provision of full contraceptive coverage\nunder the Act.” 134 S. Ct. at 2807; see also Zubik, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3947586</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n       The Southern Nazarene plaintiffs object to affirmatively voicing a religious\nobjection, including the type of notice described in Wheaton College. See Oral Arg. in\nSN at 24:30-25:20. They appear to believe that exemption from the Mandate—like the\nexemption for religious employers—is the only proper result under RFRA.\n\n                                           - 42 -\n\fdoes not substantially burden Plaintiffs’ religious exercise as a matter of law.\n\n2. The Accommodation Scheme Eliminates Burdens on Religious Exercise\n\n       Under the accommodation scheme, the act of opting out relieves objecting\n\nreligious non-profit organizations from complying with the Mandate and excuses them\n\nfrom participating in the provision of contraceptive coverage. The Departments designed\n\nthe accommodation so that, upon receipt of the Form or a notification from the\n\ngovernment, health insurance issuers and TPAs—not the objecting religious non-profit\n\norganization—provide contraceptive coverage and ensure the organization will not be\n\nrequired to provide, pay for, or otherwise facilitate that coverage. See Mich. Catholic\n\nConf., 755 F.3d at 391. We review this feature of the accommodation scheme to show\n\nhow it eliminates burdens Plaintiffs otherwise would face, similar to the burdens the for-\n\nprofit plaintiffs faced in Hobby Lobby.\n\n       First, the regulations specify a health insurance issuer must handle contraceptive\n\ncoverage separately from the insurance provided under the religious non-profit\n\norganization’s plan.\n\n       A group health insurance issuer that receives a copy of the self-certification\n       or notification . . . must (A) Expressly exclude contraceptive coverage from\n       the group health insurance coverage provided in connection with the group\n       health plan; and (B) Provide separate payments for any contraceptive\n       services required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) for plan\n       participants and beneficiaries for so long as they remain enrolled in the\n       plan.\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 43 -\n\f45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2)(i).26\n\n       Second, after a religious non-profit organization opts out, a health insurance issuer\n\nmay not share the costs of providing contraception with the employer or employees.\n\n       With respect to payments for contraceptive services, the [health insurance]\n       issuer may not impose any cost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment,\n       coinsurance, or a deductible), or impose any premium, fee, or other charge,\n       or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible organization,\n       the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries. The issuer must\n       segregate premium revenue collected from the eligible organization from\n       the monies used to provide payments for contraceptive services.\n\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2)(ii); see also 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(c)(2)(ii); 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 2590.715-2713A(c)(2)(ii). TPAs are subject to similar requirements. See 26 C.F.R.\n\n§ 54.9815-2713AT(b)(2); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2).\n\n       Finally, a health insurance issuer or TPA must, in communicating with plan\n\nparticipants or beneficiaries, send separate notice regarding contraceptive coverage from\n\nother plan notifications and make clear the employer neither administers nor funds\n\ncontraceptive benefits. A health insurance issuer or TPA\n\n       must provide to plan participants and beneficiaries written notice of the\n       availability of separate payments for contraceptive services\n       contemporaneous with (to the extent possible), but separate from, any\n       application materials distributed in connection with enrollment (or re-\n       enrollment) in group health coverage that is effective beginning on the first\n       day of each applicable plan year. The notice must specify that the eligible\n       organization does not administer or fund contraceptive benefits, but that the\n       third party administrator or issuer, as applicable, provides separate\n\n       26\n          TPAs are not subject to this provision. Instead, a TPA that receives the Form or\na notification from the government must provide or arrange for contraceptive coverage\nfor plan participants and beneficiaries if it wishes to remain the TPA for the group health\nplan. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(b)(2); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2).\n\n                                           - 44 -\n\f       payments for contraceptive services, and must provide contact information\n       for questions and complaints.\n\n26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(d); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(d); see also 45 C.F.R.\n\n§ 147.131(d).\n\n       All of the foregoing remove the objecting religious non-profit organizations from\n\nproviding contraceptive coverage, but Plaintiffs argue these protections of their religious\n\nliberty are insufficient because they still must deliver a Form or notify HHS to opt out of\n\nthe Mandate. They contend this act substantially burdens their religious exercise because\n\nit “triggers” the provision of contraceptive coverage, makes them complicit in the larger\n\ndelivery scheme, and demands their ongoing involvement. We disagree. The\n\naccommodation relieves Plaintiffs of their statutory obligation to provide contraceptive\n\ncoverage to their plan participants and beneficiaries, and as we discuss below, taking\n\nadvantage of that accommodation is not a substantial burden on religious exercise.\n\n3. The Accommodation Scheme Does Not Impose a Substantial Burden\n\n       To explain why the accommodation scheme does not substantially burden\n\nPlaintiffs’ religious exercise, we look at the theories argued by the Plaintiffs and why\n\nthey fail.\n\n       a. Opting out does not cause contraceptive coverage.\n\n       Although the accommodation scheme frees Plaintiffs from providing, paying for,\n\nor facilitating contraceptive coverage, they contend that, by delivering the Form or\n\nnotifying HHS, they nevertheless “trigger” or cause contraceptive coverage. They do\n\nnot. As we explain below, Plaintiffs’ causation argument misconstrues the statutory and\n                                           - 45 -\n\fregulatory framework. Federal law, not the Form or notification to HHS, provides for\n\ncontraceptive coverage without cost sharing to plan participants and beneficiaries.\n\nBecause the mechanics of the accommodation scheme differ slightly for different types of\n\nplans, we examine how the regulations work for insured plans, self-insured plans, and\n\nself-insured church plans. But in each circumstance, Plaintiffs’ causation argument fails\n\nto establish any burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise.\n\n             i.   Insured Plans\n\n       The plaintiffs with insured plans deal directly with a health insurance issuer and\n\ndo not use a TPA.27 They argue the accommodation scheme levies a substantial burden\n\non their religious exercise because “insurance issuers will sell [them] plans that either (a)\n\nexpressly include abortifacients; or (b) functionally include abortifacients by guaranteeing\n\nseparate payments for them upon [their] execution and conveyance of the self-\n\ncertification to the issuer.” SN Br. at 18. We disagree.\n\n       The regulations do not burden the religious exercise of employers using insured\n\nplans. The ACA obligates both group health plans and health insurance issuers to\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage. A religious non-profit organization may comply with\n\nthe Mandate and provide coverage to its employees, opt out using the accommodation, or\n\nnot comply with the law and pay fines. But in each instance, the health insurance issuer\n\n\n       27\n         The plaintiffs with insured plans are Oklahoma Wesleyan University and\nOklahoma Baptist University. Southern Nazarene also has an insured plan for students\nand claims above $100,000.\n\n\n                                            - 46 -\n\fmust ensure the organization’s employees receive contraceptive coverage.\n\n       By delivering the Form or notifying HHS, an organization with an insured plan\n\ndoes not enable coverage—to the contrary, it simply notifies its health insurance issuer\n\nthe organization will not be providing coverage. The health insurance issuer then has an\n\nindependent and exclusive obligation to provide that coverage without cost sharing. The\n\nrelevant regulation states: “When a self-certification is provided directly to an issuer, the\n\nissuer has sole responsibility for providing such coverage in accordance with § 147.130.”\n\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(1)(i). Because the ACA obligates health insurance issuers to\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage, they must meet this obligation independently and\n\nirrespective of the notification. The self-certification does not impose any responsibility;\n\nit merely makes it the issuer’s sole responsibility rather than one shared with the group\n\nhealth plan itself.\n\n       Because federal law requires the health insurance issuer to provide coverage and\n\nthe accommodation process removes an objecting organization from participating,\n\nplaintiffs with insured plans fail to show the accommodation burdens their religious\n\nexercise. The insured plaintiffs are not burdened when they are relieved of their\n\nresponsibility and their insurers provide coverage as required by independent obligations\n\nset out in the ACA.\n\n            ii.       Self-Insured Plans\n\n       The accommodation scheme permits religious non-profit organizations with self-\n\ninsured plans to opt out by delivering the Form to their TPA or notifying HHS that they\n\n                                            - 47 -\n\fhave a religious objection and will not comply with the Mandate. When the objecting\n\norganization opts out, the TPA that administers its group health plan is responsible for\n\nproviding contraceptive coverage if it wishes to remain a TPA for the plan. In this\n\nsection, we address this self-insured arrangement. In the next section, we consider the\n\nsubset of self-insured plaintiffs having church plans over which the government lacks\n\nenforcement authority under ERISA to compel the TPA to comply with its legal\n\nobligations.\n\n                     1) Plaintiffs’ argument\n\n       The only plaintiff with a self-insured plan subject to ERISA is Southern Nazarene.\n\nSouthern Nazarene argues the accommodation scheme substantially burdens its religious\n\nexercise because the scheme requires it to “comply with the Mandate by either (a) setting\n\nup a self-insured plan that includes abortifacients; or (b) setting up a self-insured plan that\n\nfunctionally includes abortifacients by guaranteeing separate payments for them by the\n\nTPA upon the entity’s execution of the self-certification.” SN Br. at 18. Self-insured\n\nplaintiffs with ERISA-exempt church plans make similar claims.\n\n       Plaintiffs and the dissent emphasize that the TPA may arrange or provide coverage\n\nonly after a religious non-profit organization opts out.28 We consider this to be an\n\n\n       28\n          In University of Notre Dame, Judge Posner said: “By refusing to fill out the\nform Notre Dame would subject itself to penalties, but Aetna and Meritain would still be\nrequired to provide the services to the university’s students and employees.” Univ. of\nNotre Dame, 786 F.3d at 614.\n       We understand the mechanics of the accommodation to work differently. Aetna,\nas a health insurance issuer for Notre Dame’s students, would be obligated to provide\n                                                                             Continued . . .\n                                            - 48 -\n\funcontested and unremarkable feature of the accommodation scheme.29 The regulations\n\nstate that when a religious non-profit organization opts out of providing contraceptive\n\ncoverage, the TPA is notified that the organization will not administer or pay for\n\ncontraceptive coverage, and that it must provide or arrange for contraceptive coverage\n\nwithout cost sharing if it wishes to continue administering the plan. 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n2713AT(b)(2); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2). The TPA is authorized and obligated\n\nto provide the coverage guaranteed by the ACA only if the religious non-profit\n\norganization that has primary responsibility for contraceptive coverage opts out of\n\nproviding it.\n\n       Plaintiffs suggest this shift in legal responsibility for contraceptive coverage\n\nsubstantially burdens their religious exercise under RFRA. They argue their opting out\n\nwould trigger, cause, or offer a “permission slip” for the delivery of contraception by\n\nallowing their TPA to provide the coverage. Southern Nazarene, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6804265</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n\n______________________________________\nCont.\n\ncontraceptive coverage under the ACA whether or not Notre Dame delivered the Form or\nnotification to HHS. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13. Meritain, a TPA, would be obligated to\nprovide contraceptive coverage only after Notre Dame delivered the Form or notification\nto HHS and opted out of the Mandate. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(b)(2); 29 C.F.R.\n§ 2590.715-2713A(b)(2).\n       29\n          Even the dissent in Wheaton College recognized that a TPA need only provide\nthe legally required contraceptive coverage when a religious non-profit organization takes\nadvantage of the accommodation scheme. As Justice Sotomayor observed, “a third-party\nadministrator bears the legal obligation to provide contraceptive coverage only upon\nreceipt of a valid self-certification.” Wheaton Coll., 134 S. Ct. at 2814 n.6 (Sotomayor,\nJ., dissenting from grant of injunction pending appeal).\n\n\n                                            - 49 -\n\f*8. We disagree.\n\n                     2) Opting out does not cause coverage\n\n       The ACA requires all group health plans to cover preventive services, including\n\ncontraception, without cost sharing. Because a group health plan must include\n\ncontraceptive coverage under the ACA, the accommodation scheme requires a TPA that\n\nadministers a self-insured religious non-profit organization’s group health plan to provide\n\ncoverage if the organization opts out. The TPA must then arrange coverage for plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries if it wishes to continue functioning as the TPA for the\n\nobjecting organization. This arrangement allows religious non-profit organizations to opt\n\nout and ensures plan participants and beneficiaries will receive the contraceptive\n\ncoverage to which they are entitled by law.\n\n       Under this framework, the plaintiffs’ argument does not identify a substantial\n\nburden on religious exercise. The opt out does not “cause” contraceptive coverage; it\n\nrelieves objectors of their coverage responsibility, at which point federal law shifts that\n\nresponsibility to a different actor. The ACA and its implementing regulations have\n\nalready required that group health plans will include contraceptive coverage and have\n\nassigned legal responsibilities to ensure such coverage will be provided when the\n\nreligious non-profit organization opts out.

Plaintiffs need not use any terms they\nconsider morally charged, like “certify,” in their letter or email to HHS.\n        We further note the notification to HHS requires self-insured plaintiffs only to\nregister their objection and identify their TPA—it does not require them to inform their\nTPA of any legal responsibilities to provide contraceptive coverage. When the opt out is\nsubmitted to HHS, the plaintiffs are relieved of their responsibilities. The government\nthen takes steps to ensure that coverage is provided—HHS notifies the Department of\nLabor of the objection, and the Department of Labor then contacts the TPA to inform it\nof its duties under the ACA.\n       31\n          Analogizing the opt out to conscientious objections to war, see, e.g., Priests for\nLife, 772 F.3d at 245-46; Univ. of Notre Dame, 786 F.3d at 623-24 (Hamilton, J.,\nconcurring), should not overshadow the diverse array of mechanisms that federal, state,\nand local governments have used to accommodate objectors. Many religious objection\nschemes require an affirmative opt out before another person is required to step in and\nassume responsibility, and may require the objector to identify a replacement in the\nprocess.

We discuss above why this characterization of the accommodation\nscheme is incorrect, but we note here that this concern is specific to self-insured plans\nsubject to ERISA. Plaintiffs could avoid the situation they deem objectionable by\nemploying an insured plan, employing a self-insured church plan where the Departments\nlack authority to enforce the Mandate against their TPA, or administering the self-insured\nplan on their own in-house without using a TPA. Although the dissent notes that in-\nhouse administration is complex, Dissent at 22-23, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated it\nwould be a substantial burden under RFRA. The fact that this alternative may be more\nexpensive or difficult for plaintiffs does not necessarily make it a substantial burden. See\nBraunfeld, 366 U.S. at 605-06.\n       33\n          In this regard, the accommodation scheme here is comparable to a conscientious\nobjector accommodation scheme, which provides for someone to replace the objector\nwhen he opts out of military service. See Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 245-46; see also\nUniv. of Notre Dame, 786 F.3d at 623-24 (Hamilton, J., concurring). Indeed, the\nconscientious objector scheme is administratively more burdensome than filing the Form\nor notifying HHS to opt out of the Mandate. A conscientious objector must register in\nthe Selective Service System before being able to apply for an exemption, must complete\nan application and appear for an in-person interview, and, if the exemption is granted,\nmust perform two years of service for the government in lieu of military service. See 50\nU.S.C. § 456j.\n        The dissent points to differences between the religious accommodation here and\nthe conscientious objector scheme. But the comparison is apt. Courts have recognized\nthat, to opt out of military service for religious reasons, a conscientious objector must\nnotify the government of his objection knowing that someone else will take his place.\nSee Trans World Airlines v.

With insured plans, the health insurance issuer bears legal\n\nresponsibility to provide contraceptive coverage whether or not the religious non-profit\n\nhas opted out. With self-insured plans, the TPA shoulders legal responsibility for\n\ncoverage only after the religious non-profit has opted out.\n\n______________________________________\nCont.\n\n(acknowledging that when the plaintiff evaded induction, “another person had to be\ncalled in his place”); McKenzie v.

Similarly, to opt out of the\nMandate, the self-insured religious objector must notify the government knowing that a\nTPA will take its place.\n        And historically, it is not unprecedented to require an objector to identify a\nsubstitute for military service. To the contrary, the first federal draft statute permitted a\ndraftee to avoid service only by either providing a substitute or paying $300. See Act of\nMarch 3, 1863, ch. 75, § 13, 12 Stat. 731, 733 (1863). As the dissent observes, the Civil\nWar Enrollment Act sparked riots, Dissent at 14-15 n.7, but these were triggered by\nopposition to the draft itself, the inability of working class people to pay the $300\nexemption, and anxiety about freed slaves entering the labor market after the war—not\nthe fact that the draft law allowed draftees to name a substitute in their place. See Leslie\nM. Harris, In the Shadow of Slavery: African Americans in New York City, 1626-1863,\nat 279-88 (2003). Although Congress later eliminated the $300 commutation fee (except\nfor conscientious objectors), it retained the provision allowing enrollees to supply a\nsubstitute. See Act of July 4, 1864, ch. 237, §§ 2, 10, 11, 13 Stat. 379, 379-80 (1864).\nTo the extent the dissent suggests Chief Justice Taney’s thoughts on the topic are\nrelevant, Dissent at 14-15 n.7, we note that he considered conscription itself\nunconstitutional, not the substitution provision.

Rev. 1493, 1546-48 (1969).\nIn fact, Chief Justice Taney paid $100 to excuse his “body servant” from the draft. See\nBernard C. Steiner, Life of Roger Brooke Taney: Chief Justice of the United States\nSupreme Court 511-12 (1922).\n\n\n                                            - 53 -\n\f       We agree this is a distinction between these types of plans, but the dissent\n\noverplays its importance. See Dissent at 5 (deeming the difference between insured and\n\nself-insured plans “the critical distinction”).34 In both contexts, the ACA requires that\n\ngroup health plans cover contraceptive services, and a plaintiff knows coverage will be\n\nprovided when it opts out. Plaintiffs do not dispute plan participants and beneficiaries’\n\nright to contraceptive coverage, nor do they contest the government’s ability to require\n\nTPAs and health insurance issuers to arrange for such coverage when a religious non-\n\nprofit organization opts out. The only question before us is whether the plaintiffs are\n\nsubstantially burdened when they notify the government of their objection with the\n\nknowledge that another party will be required to provide coverage in their stead. The\n\nanswer is no.\n\n       A religious accommodation tries to reconcile religious liberty with the rule of law.\n\nWhen faced with an unavoidable conflict between following the law or religious belief,\n\nRFRA provides a religious objector a means to challenge a generally applicable law and\n\nseek an exception to avoid following that law without having to break it. A statutory\n\naccommodation, as we have here, serves the same purpose. As noted above, this case is\n\n\n       34\n          Although the Mandate in the insured plan context assigns responsibility to\nprovide contraceptive coverage to both the religious non-profit organization and its health\ninsurance issuer, we do not believe this is the only permissible arrangement to permit\nreligious accommodation. Requiring all accommodations to follow this model would be\nduplicative, costly, and impractical, and would foreclose a wide range of pragmatic\narrangements that bring in substitutes when and only when a religious objector opts out\nof performing a task. See, e.g., supra note 31.\n\n\n                                           - 54 -\n\funusual because the Plaintiffs do not seek an accommodation where none exists, but\n\ninstead challenge a statutory accommodation and argue that the process for seeking\n\nrefuge in it substantially burdens their religious exercise. As to the self-insured plaintiffs,\n\nthe dissent contends that if they opt out and transfer their duty to provide contraceptive\n\ncoverage to the TPA, they necessarily cause such coverage. We disagree.\n\n       By opting out, the self-insured plaintiffs shift their duty to provide coverage to a\n\nTPA, but they do not change their plan participants and beneficiaries’ entitlement to\n\ncontraceptive coverage under federal law.35 The dissent suggests, however, that because\n\nthe plaintiffs can stymie coverage to their employees by breaking the law and incurring\n\nfines, and because opting out ultimately results in the TPAs’ providing coverage, the\n\nplaintiffs’ opting out therefore would cause contraceptive coverage. But this\n\nmisconstrues the purpose of religious accommodation: to permit the religious objector\n\nboth to avoid a religious burden and to comply with the law. If the plaintiffs wish to\n\navail themselves of a legal means—an accommodation—to be excused from compliance\n\n       35\n          The dissent attempts to distinguish between health plan beneficiaries’\nentitlement to coverage and their actual receipt of coverage. This distinction breaks\ndown under inspection. If a religious non-profit complies with the law by providing\ncoverage, the beneficiaries are entitled to and receive coverage. If the non-profit opts out\nas the law allows, the beneficiaries likewise are entitled to and receive coverage, they just\ndo not receive it from the non-profit. Only if the non-profit disobeys the law and refuses\neither to provide coverage or opt out would the beneficiaries not receive coverage\n(though they would still be entitled to it). If the opt out were not part of the law, the\nplaintiffs would be in the same position as the for-profits in Hobby Lobby—without a\nlegal option to avoid providing coverage. But the accommodation scheme gives the\nplaintiffs a legal avenue to avoid providing coverage as opposed to non-compliance with\nthe law with the attendant financial penalties.\n\n\n                                            - 55 -\n\fwith a law, they cannot rely on the possibility of their violating that very same law to\n\nchallenge the accommodation.\n\n       In making this argument, the dissent focuses almost exclusively on whether the\n\nplaintiffs’ opt out is a but-for cause of the TPAs’ authority to provide contraceptive\n\ncoverage.36 It does, but this approach misses the mark. Although opting out is\n\nnecessarily a but-for cause of someone else—the TPA—providing contraceptive\n\ncoverage, that is the point of an accommodation—shifting a responsibility from an\n\nobjector to a non-objector. That is how a legislative policy choice—here, to afford\n\nwomen contraceptive coverage—can be reconciled with religious objections to that\n\npolicy. We do not “den[y] the existence of any causation.” Dissent at 10. We instead\n\ncorrectly identify the effect of opting out. The effect is to shift legal responsibility from\n\nthe self-insured plaintiff to its TPA and relieve the plaintiff of the duty it considers\n\nobjectionable. The effect is not the provision of contraceptive coverage, which would be\n\nafforded under the law whether or not the plaintiff opts out.\n\n\n       36\n          Plaintiffs and the dissent characterize the self-certification as giving the TPA\n“permission” to provide contraceptive coverage. Dissent at 9. This characterization\nignores that the self-certification specifically registers an objection to providing coverage,\nrelieves the plaintiffs of their obligation to provide it, and affirmatively distances the\nplaintiffs in numerous ways from providing coverage to plan participants and\nbeneficiaries. See supra Section V.B.2. Equating the opt out to a permission slip is akin\nto “disregard[ing] the difference between a ‘No Trespassing’ sign and a welcome mat.”\nAdarand Constructors, Inc. v.

The scheme allows the\n\nreligious non-profit organization to opt out of the responsibility of providing coverage\n\nand assigns that duty to the TPA administering the group health plan. Crucially, it does\n\nnot change or expand contraceptive coverage beyond what federal law has already\n\nguaranteed. As the Supreme Court said in Hobby Lobby, the effect of the\n\naccommodation on employees “would be precisely zero. Under that accommodation,\n\nthese women would still be entitled to all FDA-approved contraceptives without cost\n\nsharing.” 134 S.

Because this\n\narrangement does not substantially burden the plaintiffs when they comply with the law,\n\nit does not matter whether the plaintiffs could prevent plan participants and beneficiaries\n\nfrom receiving coverage by violating the law. The dissent seems to suggest the ACA and\n\nits implementing regulations give self-insured plaintiffs discretion to decide whether their\n\nemployees receive contraceptive coverage. The ACA and its implementing regulations\n\ndo not, and the plaintiffs do not contend that they do.

The accommodation scheme does not give plaintiffs\n\ndiscretion to thwart their employees’ right to contraceptive coverage by refusing to\n\nprovide coverage and also refusing to register their objection so the government can\n\nmake alternative arrangements to free them from providing coverage.38 Because\n\nCongress has created a federal entitlement to contraceptive coverage and formulated a\n\nframework to guarantee that coverage will be provided even if plaintiffs decline to\n\nprovide it, self-insured plaintiffs do not “cause” contraceptive coverage by exercising\n\ntheir ability to opt out.\n\n                       4) No cause of substantial burden\n\n       In sum, the self-insured plaintiffs’ causal analysis falters regarding the effect of\n\nopting out, which is to shift legal responsibility to provide contraceptive coverage from\n\n\n       37\n          The dissent asks, “if the self-insured plaintiffs do not opt out, who will provide\nthe coverage for their plan participants and beneficiaries?” Dissent at 8.

But this is the reason for the opt\nout: to allow the plaintiffs a legal means to avoid providing coverage.\n       38\n         In the absence of any such discretionary power or responsibility, plaintiffs are\nnot faced with the Hobson’s choice the dissent describes.

To the\ncontrary, the accommodation eliminates any Hobson’s choice by allowing plaintiffs to\nopt out of providing coverage.\n\n\n                                            - 58 -\n\fplaintiffs to their TPAs. When the government establishes a scheme that anticipates\n\nreligious concerns by allowing objectors to opt out but ensuring that others will take up\n\ntheir responsibilities, plaintiffs are not substantially burdened merely because their\n\ndecision to opt out cannot prevent the responsibility from being met.\n\n       To establish a claim under RFRA, about which the dissent says little, a plaintiff\n\nmust show the government substantially burdens its sincere religious exercise. The ACA\n\nstates group health plans must cover contraception, and the regulations state that if a\n\nreligious non-profit organization opts out, that coverage will be provided by a TPA.\n\nOpting out does not cause the coverage itself; federal law does, by establishing a scheme\n\nthat permits plaintiffs to opt out of their legal responsibility while simultaneously\n\nensuring that plan participants and beneficiaries receive the coverage to which they are\n\nlegally entitled. Allowing plaintiffs to opt out is not a substantial burden under RFRA.39\n\n\n       39\n          The dissent’s theory of causation is not viable for the reasons discussed above.\nWe also fail to see how it comports with the Supreme Court’s orders in Wheaton College,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Departments concede they lack authority under ERISA to force\n\nthese church plan TPAs to perform their regulatory responsibility. See 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1003(b)(2). As a result, the Government can require the plaintiffs with self-insured\n\nchurch plans to use the Form or notify HHS to register their objection and opt out, but it\n\nhas no enforcement authority to compel or penalize those plaintiffs’ TPAs if they decline\n______________________________________\nCont.\n\ncoverage.

As Justice\nSotomayor observed, “because Wheaton is materially indistinguishable from other\nnonprofits that object to the Government’s accommodation, the issuance of an injunction\nin this case will presumably entitle hundreds or thousands of other objectors to the same\nremedy.” Wheaton College, 134 S.

The analysis in this section also\napplies to the plaintiffs that operate or administer self-insured church plans, which\ninclude the Christian Brothers Employee Benefit Trust, Christian Brothers Services, and\nGuideStone Financial Resources.\n\n\n                                           - 60 -\n\fto provide or arrange for contraceptive coverage.41\n\n       The lack of enforcement authority makes any burden on plaintiffs with church\n\nplans even less substantial than the burden on plaintiffs with self-insured plans that are\n\nsubject to ERISA. Nonetheless, plaintiffs with church plans offer the following\n\narguments as to why the accommodation scheme might still burden their religious\n\nexercise. First, the Departments could decide to alter the regulations and assert authority\n\nover church plans under ERISA. Second, the mere act of signing the Form or delivering\n\nthe notification may involve them in the provision of contraception, either by cooperating\n\nwith the Departments or by providing authorization to a TPA, which then decides it\n\nwants to provide contraceptive coverage after all. Third, their opting out incentivizes\n\nTPAs to provide coverage even if they are exempt from ERISA. Fourth, the Government\n\nhas not demonstrated why the plaintiffs must complete the self-certification if their TPAs\n\ncan decline to provide contraceptive coverage. In addition to the reasons self-insured\n\nplans in general are not substantially burdened by the accommodation scheme, we\n\n       41\n          If TPAs for self-insured church plans decide not to provide contraceptive\ncoverage, plan participants and beneficiaries would not get the coverage to which they\nare otherwise entitled under the ACA. The dissent suggests it is paradoxical to maintain\nthe ACA ensures plan participants and beneficiaries will receive contraceptive coverage\nand also acknowledge TPAs for self-insured church plans may in fact decline to provide\nthat coverage. Dissent at 11 n.4. The positions are consistent. The ACA requires all\ngroup health plans to provide contraceptive coverage, but because it can only enforce that\nrequirement through ERISA, church plans that are exempt from ERISA do not face any\nconsequences if they fail to meet it. Put differently, the ACA creates a legal duty for all\ngroup health plans, but the Government cannot enforce that duty against a narrow subset\nof self-insured church plans. The inability to enforce that duty does not mean the duty\ndoes not exist.\n\n\n                                            - 61 -\n\fconclude the plaintiffs with self-insured church plans have failed to identify a substantial\n\nburden on religious exercise.\n\n                     1) Hypothetical regulation\n\n       The plaintiffs argue the Departments could assert authority over church plans\n\nunder ERISA at some point in the future. We assess the regulations as they currently\n\nexist, not amendments to ERISA’s implementing regulations the Department of Labor\n\nmay hypothetically promulgate. An “[i]njunction issues to prevent existing or presently\n\nthreatened injuries.

Should the Departments assert ERISA authority over church plans at some\n\nlater date, plaintiffs may then seek a preliminary injunction to prevent the Departments\n\nfrom enforcing the Mandate.

But plaintiffs with self-insured church plans are not substantially\n\nburdened by the requirement that they complete the Form or notification to HHS. As we\n\nexplained in the previous section on self-insured plans, when a religious non-profit\n\n                                           - 62 -\n\forganization opts out of the Mandate, the requirement that the group health plan include\n\ncontraceptive coverage is a product of federal law, not the product of the organization’s\n\nopting out. Opting out frees plaintiffs from their obligation to provide contraceptive\n\ncoverage under the ACA. The lack of substantial burden is especially evident when the\n\ngroup health plan is administered by a TPA that has made clear it will not provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage on religious grounds. The Little Sisters’ TPA, for example, is\n\nChristian Brothers, their co-plaintiff in this case. It is clear Christian Brothers need not,\n\nand will not, provide contraceptive coverage if the Little Sisters opt out of the Mandate.42\n\n                     3) No incentive from church plan TPA notification\n\n       Even when TPAs for self-insured church plans indicate they may comply with the\n\nMandate, the TPAs make that decision, and the objecting religious non-profit\n\norganization is not substantially burdened. The plaintiffs in Reaching Souls argue one of\n\ntheir TPAs, Highmark, has indicated it will provide contraceptive coverage if they opt out\n\nof the Mandate. The Reaching Souls plaintiffs argue their act of opting out would not\n\nonly provide Highmark with permission to provide contraceptive coverage, but would\n\nincentivize it to do so because Highmark could then seek reimbursement from the\n\ngovernment.\n\n       Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate the reimbursement provision actually gives TPAs an\n\nincentive to provide coverage. They claim a TPA that receives the Form or a letter from\n\n       42\n          Plaintiff TPAs that administer church plans are not substantially burdened for\nsimilar reasons. In the absence of any enforcement power, the Government cannot levy\nfines against them for declining to provide contraceptive coverage.\n\n                                            - 63 -\n\fthe government “becomes eligible for government payments that will both cover the\n\nTPA’s costs and include an additional payment (equal to at least 10% of costs) for the\n\nTPA’s margin and overhead.” LS Br. at 16. At a hearing in Reaching Souls, counsel for\n\nthe Government seemed to accept this characterization. But the regulations themselves\n\nexpressly contradict this reading. They state the payment for margin and overhead goes\n\nto health insurance issuers who act as intermediaries for the reimbursement, and need not\n\ngo to TPAs.43 See 45 C.F.R. § 156.50(d)(5) (specifying health insurance issuers must\n\nreimburse TPAs for “the portion of the adjustment attributable to the total dollar amount\n\nof the payments for contraceptive services submitted by the third party administrator” but\n\nthat “[n]o such payment is required with respect to the allowance for administrative costs\n\nand margin”).\n\n      Moreover, even if TPAs were to receive a payment for margin and overhead—set\n\nat 15% of costs for 2014—plaintiffs do not demonstrate this allowance actually functions\n\nas an incentive to provide contraceptive coverage rather than repayment for the\n\nadministrative costs TPAs incur by stepping in to arrange for or provide coverage.\n\nPlaintiffs have not demonstrated the allowance for administrative overhead actually\n\n      43\n         The Departments credit the health insurance issuer for (1) the total dollar\namount of the TPA’s payments for contraceptive coverage, and (2) an allowance of at\nleast 10% for administrative costs and margin. See 45 C.F.R. § 156.50(d)(3). The health\ninsurance issuer then pays the TPA for the total dollar amount of the TPA’s payments for\ncontraceptive coverage, but is not required to pay the TPA the allowance for\nadministrative costs and margin. See 45 C.F.R. § 156.50(d)(5). As a result, the\nregulations require only that a TPA receive repayment for what it has actually spent\nproviding contraceptive coverage. A reimbursement solely for costs incurred would not\ngenerate a profit or offer any incentive to provide contraceptive coverage.\n\n                                          - 64 -\n\fgenerates a profit for TPAs, nor have they demonstrated that the allowance would\n\nincentivize TPAs to provide coverage where they otherwise would not.\n\n                     4) The Government may require affirmative objection\n\n       Plaintiffs finally argue that if the Departments lack ERISA enforcement authority\n\nagainst TPAs of self-insured church plans, the Government has no reason to require\n\nreligious non-profit organizations to comply with the accommodation scheme and deliver\n\nthe Form or notify HHS. It is the plaintiffs’ burden, however, to state a prima facie case\n\nunder RFRA. Because they cannot establish that signing the Form or notifying HHS\n\nconstitutes a substantial burden on their religious exercise, we do not question the\n\nDepartments’ interest in requiring them to opt out of the Mandate to avoid penalties for\n\nfailure to provide contraceptive coverage.44\n\n                                       * * * *\n\n       We conclude the Plaintiffs’ causation arguments do not establish a burden on their\n\nreligious exercise, much less a substantial burden, because opting out would not trigger,\n\n\n\n\n       44\n          The Departments have a sound reason to require an affirmative opt out—not all\nreligious organizations share the beliefs of the Little Sisters, Reaching Souls, Truett-\nMcConnell, and Mid-America Christian. The parties agree that the Departments can\nrequire non-objecting employers to provide contraceptive coverage under their group\nhealth plans. To enforce that general requirement, the Departments may require\nobjecting employers to affirmatively voice their objection instead of assuming all\nreligious non-profit organizations share the plaintiffs’ beliefs.\n\n\n                                           - 65 -\n\fincentivize, or otherwise cause the provision of contraceptive coverage.45 We therefore\n\nturn to Plaintiffs’ argument that the act of opting out and the administrative requirements\n\nassociated with the accommodation make them feel or appear complicit in the overall\n\ncontraceptive coverage scheme.\n\n       e. No substantial burden from complicity\n\n       The accommodation relieves Plaintiffs from providing, paying for, or facilitating\n\ncontraceptive coverage, and federal law requires health insurance issuers and TPAs to\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage when religious non-profit organizations take advantage of\n\nthe accommodation. Plaintiffs argue the act of opting out would nevertheless\n\nsubstantially burden their religious exercise because they believe delivering the Form or\n\nnotification to HHS would make them complicit in the overall scheme to deliver\n\ncontraceptive coverage. They wish to play no part in it. We find this argument\n\nunconvincing for a number of reasons.\n\n       First, the purpose and design of the accommodation scheme is to ensure that\n\nPlaintiffs are not complicit—that they do not have to provide, pay for, or facilitate\n\ncontraception. Plaintiffs’ concern that others may believe they condone the Mandate is\n\nunfounded. Opting out sends the unambiguous message that they oppose contraceptive\n\ncoverage and refuse to provide it, and does not foreclose them from objecting both to\n\n\n       45\n         Under these circumstances, as the Third Circuit observed, “the burden is not\nmerely attenuated at the outset but totally disconnected from the appellees.” Geneva\nColl., 778 F.3d at 442.\n\n\n                                           - 66 -\n\fcontraception and the Mandate in the strongest possible terms.\n\n       Second, to the extent Plaintiffs assert that completing the Form or notification\n\nviolates their religious beliefs, they state a necessary but not a sufficient predicate for a\n\nRFRA claim. Under RFRA, they must establish that completing the Form or notification\n\nsubstantially burdens their religious exercise; otherwise, this argument could be used to\n\navoid almost any legal obligation that involves a form. Plaintiffs do not object to signing\n\nforms and paperwork generally—they object to the Form or notification to HHS, and they\n\ndo so because they believe it involves them in directly or indirectly providing, paying for,\n\nor facilitating contraceptive coverage, which they oppose as a matter of religious\n\nconviction. As we have explained, the Plaintiffs misstate their role in the accommodation\n\nscheme. RFRA does not require us to defer to their erroneous view about the operation\n\nof the ACA and its implementing regulations.46\n\n\n\n       46\n          Plaintiffs cite Thomas for the proposition that we cannot question the\ntheological merit of their religious beliefs. See Thomas, 450 U.S. at 715 (“We see,\ntherefore, that Thomas drew a line, and it is not for us to say that the line he drew was an\nunreasonable one.”). We agree with that proposition, but we may—indeed, we must—\ndetermine whether the accommodation scheme substantially burdens their religious\nexercise.\n       In Thomas, Mr. Thomas believed he could not participate in the production of war\nmaterials. Id. at 709. The government argued Mr. Thomas’s beliefs did not warrant\nprotection by suggesting those beliefs were inconsistent and not shared by his co-\nreligionists. Id. at 714-15. The Supreme Court specifically rejected these attempts to\nimpeach Mr. Thomas’s religious beliefs, id. at 715-16, but the Court was not confronted\nwith the question of whether those beliefs were substantially burdened. Both the\nSupreme Court and the Tenth Circuit have indicated that accepting a plaintiff’s religious\nbelief does not foreclose an inquiry into whether religious exercise has been substantially\nburdened. See, e.g., Hernandez, 490 U.S. at 699; Kikumura, 242 F.3d at 961.\n                                                                                Continued . . .\n                                             - 67 -\n\f       Third, because the accommodation does not involve them in providing, paying for,\n\nfacilitating, or causing contraceptive coverage, Plaintiffs’ only involvement in the scheme\n\nis the act of opting out. Plaintiffs are not substantially burdened solely by the de minimis\n\nadministrative tasks this involves. All opt-out schemes require some affirmative act to\n\nfree objectors from the obligations they would otherwise face. The Plaintiffs’ logic\n\nwould undermine conscientious objection schemes that require the objection to be made,\n\nrelieve objectors of their obligations, but assign those obligations to other, non-objecting\n\nactors in their stead. See, e.g., Gillette v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108285\"><a href=\"/opinion/108285/gillette-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971)\n\n(acknowledging a petitioner must complete an exemption application to obtain\n\n______________________________________\nCont.\n\n        The Government does not question Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs that contraception\nis sinful and they cannot be involved in providing, paying for, or facilitating\ncontraceptive coverage. But Plaintiffs go beyond Thomas when they insist that we\ncannot question whether opting out makes them complicit in providing contraceptive\ncoverage. We may properly consider that opting out excuses them from providing\ncoverage, does not cause that coverage to be extended to plan participants and\nbeneficiaries, and involves only routine administrative tasks that are not substantial\nburdens under RFRA. See Little Sisters, 6 F. Supp. 3d at 1239 (“Thus, Plaintiff’s\ncontention that the Court cannot look behind their statements about what offends their\nreligious beliefs is well-supported. However, the Court is under no such restriction with\nregard to Plaintiffs’ construction of how the Final Rules operate, including the\nadministrative burdens imposed on the parties by these regulations.”).\n        For these reasons, Thomas is inapposite when the inquiry focuses on whether a\nburden is substantial. It does not preclude courts from examining the relationship\nbetween a sincerely held religious belief and the alleged burden imposed by the\nGovernment. This important distinction prevents the Government from having to survive\nstrict scrutiny whenever a plaintiff misunderstands the burden being placed upon them—\nfor example, if Mr. Thomas had been required to produce equipment for farming and\nsincerely, but incorrectly, believed that equipment was being produced for war. See, e.g.,\nPriests for Life, 772 F.3d at 249 n.14.\n\n\n                                            - 68 -\n\fconscientious objector status in wartime); Welsh v.

Filing the Form or notifying HHS easily fits within this\n\ncategory. The Departments have made opting out of the Mandate at least as easy as\n\nobtaining a parade permit, filing a simple tax form, or registering to vote—in other\n\nwords, a routine, brief administrative task. The purpose of the Form or notification to\n\nHHS is to extricate Plaintiffs from their legal obligation to provide contraceptive\n\ncoverage. Opting out ensures they will play no part in the provision of contraceptive\n\ncoverage, prohibits TPAs and health insurance issuers from sharing the costs of providing\n\ncoverage with them, and requires notice to employees that they do not administer or fund\n\ncontraceptive services.\n\n\n       47\n          As other courts have observed, invalidating the accommodation scheme would\nrun contrary to many other laws allowing objectors to opt out of government programs\nand requirements.

Opting out would eliminate their\n\ncomplicity with the Mandate and require only routine and minimal administrative\n\npaperwork, and they are not substantially burdened by the Government’s subsequent\n\nefforts to deliver contraceptive coverage in their stead.\n\n          f. No burden from ongoing requirements\n\n       As a final argument, Plaintiffs deny the act of opting out would free them from\n\nfurther involvement in the provision of contraceptive coverage. They argue the\n\naccommodation scheme would require their ongoing participation, and give two\n\nexamples to support this claim.\n\n       First, Plaintiffs argue they would remain involved because the Departments are\n\ncommandeering their group health plans to provide contraceptive coverage to their\n\nemployees. They note their TPA or health insurance issuer can provide coverage only as\n\nlong as plan participants and beneficiaries remain employed with the religious non-profit\n\norganization.\n\n       Plaintiffs have not shown, assuming they opt out, how the provision of coverage to\n\nplan participants and beneficiaries through the health insurance issuer or TPA would\n\nsubstantially burden their religious exercise. Plaintiffs’ plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries are not guaranteed contraceptive coverage without cost sharing because they\n\nwork for the Plaintiffs; they are guaranteed contraceptive coverage under the ACA. The\n\nACA mandates health insurance that includes contraceptive coverage. See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 300gg-13(a)(4). Plaintiffs’ theory would not only relieve them of complying with the\n\n                                            - 72 -\n\fMandate, it would prevent health insurance issuers and TPAs from stepping in under the\n\nACA to provide plan participants and beneficiaries with the coverage they are entitled to\n\nreceive under federal law.\n\n       Second, Plaintiffs object that they must (a) notify their TPA or health insurance\n\nissuer when employees join or leave their broader health insurance scheme, and (b)\n\ncomplete the self-certification or notification to HHS when they create or terminate a\n\nrelationship with a TPA or health insurance issuer. As to the first requirement, employers\n\nalready must notify their TPA or health insurance issuer when they hire or fire\n\nemployees. The communication with the TPA or health insurance issuer regarding\n\ngeneral health insurance coverage for entering or exiting plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries would occur regardless of any legal obligation under the accommodation\n\nscheme. The latter requirement, however, is an obligation specific to the accommodation\n\nscheme. An insured or self-insured employer using the Form must send it to “each” TPA\n\nor health insurance issuer as the employer forms contractual relationships with them. 26\n\nC.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(b)(1)(ii); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii). If the\n\nemployer instead uses the notification process, the regulations state: “If there is a change\n\nin any of the information required to be included in the notice, the organization must\n\nprovide updated information to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.” 26 C.F.R.\n\n§ 54.9815-2713AT(b)(1)(ii)(B); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii)(B).\n\n       Once again, this does not constitute a substantial burden. The only new\n\nrequirement is that employers must complete the Form or notify HHS of their objection\n\n                                           - 73 -\n\fwhen they contract with a new health insurance issuer or TPA. Plaintiffs do not argue the\n\ntime, cost, or energy required to comply with this requirement constitutes a substantial\n\nburden; they argue it is the moral significance of their involvement which burdens their\n\nreligious exercise.49 If the first self-certification is not a substantial burden, a second or\n\nthird self-certification would not be substantially burdensome given the extremely\n\nminimal administrative requirements of the Form or notification. As we have discussed\n\nabove, de minimis administrative requirements do not themselves amount to substantial\n\nburdens on religious liberty. See Tony & Susan Alamo Found., 471 U.S. at 305-06; see\n\nalso Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, 493 U.S. at 394-95; Hernandez, 490 U.S. at 696-97. If\n\nthe actual delivery of the Form or notification is not a substantial burden, a contingent\n\nadministrative requirement to update the Form or notification is not either.\n\n       The regulations require the Plaintiffs to complete the Form or deliver the\n\nnotification if they wish to opt out. But this ministerial act to opt out is not a substantial\n\nburden on religious exercise, nor are the collateral requirements of the scheme. The\n\nDepartments have allowed Plaintiffs to opt out of a neutral and generally applicable\n\nrequirement imposed by federal law, and have done so in a manner that affirmatively\n\ndistances those organizations from the provision of contraceptive coverage that other\n\nemployers must provide. It is not a substantial burden to require organizations to provide\n\n       49\n         The interim final rules estimate “the total annual burden for preparing and\nproviding the information in the self-certification or notice to HHS will require\napproximately 50 minutes for each eligible organization with an equivalent cost burden\nof approximately $53.” 79 Fed.

Strict Scrutiny\n\n       Because we determine Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a substantial burden\n\non their religious exercise, we need not address whether the Departments have shown a\n\ncompelling state interest and adopted the least restrictive means of advancing that\n\ninterest.50\n\n                                     D. Conclusion\n\n       In the absence of a substantial burden, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a strong\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits of their RFRA claim, nor have they demonstrated they\n\nwill suffer irreparable injury if an injunction is denied. Accordingly, a preliminary\n\ninjunction on RFRA grounds is inappropriate.\n\n                               VI.

Second, although we reverse the district court’s grant\nof a preliminary injunction on RFRA grounds in Reaching Souls, plaintiffs there raised\nthe question whether that preliminary injunction is appropriate on First Amendment\ngrounds. “If the district court fails to analyze the factors necessary to justify a\npreliminary injunction, this court may do so if the record is sufficiently developed.”\nWestar Energy, Inc. v.

Free Exercise Clause\n\n      Plaintiffs contend the ACA and its implementing regulations violate the Free\n\nExercise Clause by exempting some religious objectors—churches and their “integrated\n\nauxiliaries”—from the Mandate, while requiring others—specifically, religious non-\n\nprofit organizations—to comply with the Mandate, seek an accommodation, or pay\n\nsubstantial fines. They have not explained how their Free Exercise claim differs from\n\ntheir Establishment Clause claim, nor do they explain how they could prevail under the\n\nstandard in Smith if they are unlikely to succeed under RFRA. Because we conclude the\n\n\n______________________________________\nCont.\n\nbeen fully briefed on appeal, we resolve those questions in this opinion rather than\nremanding them to the district courts and prolonging this litigation.\n       By contrast, the Southern Nazarene plaintiffs included First Amendment claims in\ntheir complaint, but did not assert them in their motion for a preliminary injunction or\naccompanying memorandum of law. As a result, the district court did not reach any First\nAmendment claims in its decision.

Legal Background\n\n       The First Amendment’s religion clauses state: “Congress shall make no law\n\nrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” U.S.\n\nConst. amend. 1. To resolve challenges under the Free Exercise Clause, we use a well-\n\nestablished framework. If a law is neutral and generally applicable, it does not violate the\n\nFree Exercise Clause “even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular\n\nreligious practice.” Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112881\"><a href=\"/opinion/112881/church-of-lukumi-babalu-aye-inc-v-hialeah/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 531 (1993); see Smith, 494 U.S. at 878-80. “A law is neutral so long as its object is\n\nsomething other than the infringement or restriction of religious practices.” Grace\n\nUnited, 451 F.3d at 649-50. A law that is facially neutral may nevertheless fail the\n\nneutrality test if it covertly targets religious conduct for adverse treatment. Lukumi\n\nBabalu, 508 U.S. at 534.\n\n       To determine whether a law is generally applicable, we ask if the “legislature\n\ndecide[d] that the governmental interests it seeks to advance are worthy of being pursued\n\nonly against conduct with a religious motivation.” Id. at 542-43. “[A] law that is both\n\nneutral and generally applicable need only be rationally related to a legitimate\n\ngovernmental interest to survive a constitutional challenge.” Grace United, 451 F.3d at\n\n649.\n\n\n\n\n                                           - 78 -\n\f2. The Mandate and Accommodation Scheme are Neutral\n\n       The Mandate and the accommodation scheme are neutral laws. See Priests for\n\nLife, 772 F.3d at 267-69; Mich. Catholic Conf., 755 F.3d at 393-94. The Mandate is\n\nfacially neutral with regard to employers, and neither the history nor the text of the ACA\n\nand its implementing regulations suggest the Mandate was targeted at a particular religion\n\nor religious practice. Plaintiffs cannot show Congress or HHS “had as their object the\n\nsuppression of religion.” Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 542. To the contrary, the Mandate\n\narose from concerns about the personal and social costs of barriers preventing women\n\nfrom receiving preventive care, including reproductive health care. See IOM, Clinical\n\nPreventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps 102-03 (2011), available at\n\nwww.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13181. The accommodation scheme was\n\ndeveloped to facilitate the free exercise of religion, not to target religious groups or\n\nburden religious practice. To that end, the Departments expanded the religious employer\n\nexemption and religious non-profit organization accommodation to respond to the\n\nconcerns of religious groups. The Plaintiffs’ apparent dissatisfaction with the\n\naccommodation offered to them does not mean the Mandate or the accommodation\n\nscheme is non-neutral.\n\n3. The Mandate and Accommodation Scheme are Generally Applicable\n\n       The Mandate and the accommodation scheme are also generally applicable. See\n\nPriests for Life, 772 F.3d at 267-69; Mich. Catholic Conf., 755 F.3d at 393-94. Plaintiffs\n\ncannot show Congress or the Departments sought to impose the Mandate only against\n\n                                            - 79 -\n\freligious groups; to the contrary, the Mandate applies to all employers with more than\n\nfifty employees using non-grandfathered health plans.52 “The exemptions do not render\n\nthe law so under-inclusive as to belie the government’s interest in protecting public\n\nhealth and promoting women’s well-being or to suggest that disfavoring Catholic or other\n\npro-life employers was its objective.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 268. Plaintiffs fail to\n\ndemonstrate the accommodation scheme targets religious conduct or was created with the\n\nobjective of disfavoring particular faiths. Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 542-43. To the\n\ncontrary, the Mandate was enacted as part of a larger program of health care reform, and\n\nboth the exemption for religious employers and the accommodation for religious non-\n\nprofit organizations demonstrate federal deference to religious liberty concerns and were\n\npromulgated to facilitate rather than inhibit the free exercise of religion.\n\n       52\n         Smith stated that “where the State has in place a system of individual\nexemptions, it may not refuse to extend that system to cases of religious hardship without\ncompelling reason.” Smith, 494 U.S. at 884 (quotations and citation omitted). But as we\nnoted in Grace United, “we have already refused to interpret Smith as standing for the\nproposition that a secular exemption automatically creates a claim for a religious\nexemption.” Grace United, 451 F.3d at 651. We have instead held:\n\n       a system of individualized exemptions is one that gives rise to the\n       application of a subjective test. Such a system is one in which case-by-case\n       inquiries are routinely made, such that there is an individualized\n       governmental assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct that invites\n       considerations of the particular circumstances involved in the particular\n       case.\n\nAxson-Flynn v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"164292\"><a href=\"/opinion/164292/axson-flynn-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1277</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1297 (10th Cir. 2004) (quotations and citations\nomitted). None of the categorical exemptions enacted by the ACA and its implementing\nregulations establish a system of individualized objections. And for the reasons detailed\nabove, we believe the accommodation scheme effectively relieves objecting religious\nnon-profit organizations of their obligations.\n\n                                            - 80 -\n\f4. The Mandate and Accommodation Scheme Have a Rational Basis\n\n       Rather than make an argument based on the rational relationship standard,\n\nPlaintiffs instead contend our decision in Hobby Lobby precludes us from finding that\n\npublic health and gender equality, without greater specificity, constitute compelling\n\ngovernmental interests. But, as we have explained, the compelling interest test does not\n\napply; the rational basis test does. Grace United, 451 F.3d at 649. The Government\n\nobserves that in the cases before us, the accommodation scheme rationally serves the twin\n\ninterests of facilitating religious exercise and filling coverage gaps resulting from\n\naccommodating that religious exercise.\n\n       On rational basis review, these interests are sufficient. Alleviating governmental\n\ninterference with religious exercise, which the accommodation scheme does, is a\n\npermissible legislative purpose. Corp. of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus\n\nChrist of Latter-Day Saints v. Amos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111944\"><a href=\"/opinion/111944/corporation-of-presiding-bishop-of-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 335 (1987). And we need not\n\nscrutinize whether the Government’s interest in public health and gender equality is more\n\ncompelling in this case than in Hobby Lobby. We need only determine that public health\n\nand gender equality are legitimate state interests. We believe they meet this more\n\npermissive standard, which is not foreclosed by our compelling interest analysis in Hobby\n\nLobby. See, e.g., Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1143 (determining public health and gender\n\nequality are too broad to satisfy the compelling interest test but noting “[w]e recognize\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 81 -\n\fthe importance of these interests”).53 The accommodation scheme advances both the free\n\nexercise of religion and the Government’s legitimate interests in public health and gender\n\nequality. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2759 (“We therefore conclude that [the\n\naccommodation] system constitutes an alternative that achieves all of the Government’s\n\naims while providing greater respect for religious liberty.”).\n\n       Furthermore, when applying the rational basis test, we are not limited to interests\n\nspecifically articulated by the Departments. We may look to any conceivable legitimate\n\ngovernmental interest, and “the burden is upon the challenging party to negative any\n\nreasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis.” Bd. of Trs. of\n\nUniv. of Ala. v.

Establishment Clause\n\n       Plaintiffs contend that exempting churches and integrated auxiliaries from the\n\nMandate but requiring religious non-profit organizations to seek an accommodation\n\nviolates the Establishment Clause. We disagree. Because the Departments have chosen\n\nto distinguish between entities based on neutral, objective organizational criteria and not\n\nby denominational preference or religiosity, the distinction does not run afoul of the\n\nEstablishment Clause.\n\n1. Organizational Distinctions Well-Established in Federal Law\n\n       Federal law distinguishes between different types of religious organizations, and\n\nas we discuss below, this differentiation is constitutionally permissible. Under the ACA\n\nand its implementing regulations, a religious employer “is organized and operates as a\n\nnonprofit entity and is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (a)(3)(A)(iii) of the\n\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.” 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). The regulations\n\n                                            - 83 -\n\fat issue in this case draw on the tax code’s distinction between houses of worship and\n\nreligious non-profits, a “longstanding and familiar” distinction in federal law. Priests for\n\nLife, 772 F.3d at 238; see also Geneva Coll., 778 F.3d at 443 (determining it was\n\npermissible for the Departments to base the exemption on the IRC’s provision “because\n\nthat provision was a bright line that was already statutorily codified and frequently\n\napplied”).\n\n       Exempting churches while requiring other religious objectors to seek an\n\naccommodation is standard practice under the tax code. The IRC and other regulations\n\naward benefits to some religious organizations—typically, houses of worship—based on\n\narticulable criteria that other religious organizations do not meet. See 26 U.S.C.\n\n§ 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii). Churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or\n\nassociations of churches are automatically considered tax exempt and need not notify the\n\ngovernment they are applying for recognition, but other religious non-profit organizations\n\nmust apply for tax-exempt status if their annual gross receipts are more than $5,000. See\n\nid. § 508(a), (c)(1)(A). Similarly, churches, their integrated auxiliaries, conventions or\n\nassociations of churches, and the exclusively religious activities of any religious order\n\nneed not file tax returns, but religious non-profit organizations with gross receipts above\n\n$5,000—even if they are tax-exempt—must file annually. Id. § 6033(a). Congress has\n\nplaced special limitations on tax inquiries and examinations of churches, but not\n\nintegrated auxiliaries, church-operated schools, or religious non-profit organizations. See\n\nid. § 7611.\n\n                                            - 84 -\n\f      Congress has used similar organizational distinctions in the realm of religious\n\naccommodations. Churches and qualified church-controlled organizations that object to\n\npaying Social Security and Medicare taxes for religious reasons may opt out of paying\n\nthem by filing a form with the IRS, but other religious non-profit organizations may not.\n\nSee id. § 3121(w).\n\n2. Organizational Distinctions and Respecting the Religion Clauses\n\n      Distinctions based on organizational form enable the government to\n\nsimultaneously respect both the Free Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause and\n\npermit the construction of accommodation schemes that pass constitutional muster. The\n\nSupreme Court has concluded\n\n      [t]he general principle deducible from the First Amendment and all that has\n      been said by the Court is this: that we will not tolerate either\n      governmentally established religion or governmental interference with\n      religion. Short of those expressly proscribed governmental acts there is\n      room for play in the joints productive of a benevolent neutrality which will\n      permit religious exercise to exist without sponsorship and without\n      interference.\n\nWalz v.

In Colorado Christian, we concluded Colorado’s\n\nexclusion of “pervasively sectarian” institutions from state scholarship programs violated\n\nthe First Amendment “for two reasons: the program expressly discriminates among\n\nreligions without constitutional justification, and its criteria for doing so involve\n\nunconstitutionally intrusive scrutiny of religious belief and practice.” Id. at 1250.\n\n                                             - 86 -\n\fNeither of these two concerns in Colorado Christian is applicable here.\n\n       Larson and Colorado Christian prohibit preferences based on denomination (e.g.,\n\nCatholic, Jewish, Islamic, etc.) and religiosity (e.g., pervasively sectarian, moderately\n\nsectarian, non-sectarian, etc.), but do not prohibit distinctions based on organizational\n\ntype (e.g., church, non-profit, university, etc.). As Larson noted: “The clearest command\n\nof the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination cannot be officially\n\npreferred over another.” 456 U.S. at 244. In Colorado Christian, we determined that\n\n“defendants supply no reason to think that the government may discriminate between\n\n‘types of institution’ on the basis of the nature of the religious practice these institutions\n\nare moved to engage in.” 534 F.3d at 1259. As a result, Establishment Clause\n\njurisprudence clearly indicates denominational preferences expressed by the government\n\nare subject to strict scrutiny. See id. Religiosity distinctions are subject to strict scrutiny\n\nas well because they involve the government in scrutinizing and making decisions based\n\non particular expressions of religious belief. See id. at 1256 (invalidating Colorado law\n\nbecause it “expressly discriminates among religions, allowing aid to ‘sectarian’ but not\n\n‘pervasively sectarian’ institutions, and it does so on the basis of criteria that entail\n\nintrusive governmental judgments regarding matters of religious belief and practice”).\n\n       Plaintiffs cite no case holding that organizational distinctions, as opposed to those\n\nbased on denomination or religiosity, run afoul of the Establishment Clause.

Catholic Conf., 755 F.3d at 395; see\n\nalso Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 272-74.\n\n       Neither Larson nor Colorado Christian supports Plaintiffs’ claim that distinctions\n\nbetween churches and other religious entities is impermissible. As we concluded in\n\nColorado Christian, “if the State wishes to choose among otherwise eligible institutions,\n\nit must employ neutral, objective criteria rather than criteria that involve the evaluation of\n\ncontested religious questions and practices.” 534 F.3d at 1266. This is what the\n\nDepartments have done with the accommodation scheme in compliance with the First\n\nAmendment’s Establishment Clause.\n\n4. Plaintiffs’ Argument Based on the Departments’ Rationale\n\n       Plaintiffs seize on the Departments’ rationale for the distinction that religious non-\n\nprofit organizations are more likely than churches to employ individuals who do not\n\nshare their employers’ beliefs but are nevertheless entitled to contraceptive coverage\n\nunder the ACA. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874 (“Houses of worship and their integrated\n\nauxiliaries that object to contraceptive coverage on religious grounds are more likely than\n\nother employers to employ people of the same faith who share the same objection, and\n\nwho would therefore be less likely than other people to use contraceptive services even if\n\nsuch services were covered under their plan.”). Plaintiffs argue some denominations are\n\n                                             - 88 -\n\fless likely to carry out ministry functions through a church or integrated auxiliary than\n\nothers, and that the workforces of some non-profit institutions may be more religiously\n\nhomogenous than the workforces of some established churches.\n\n       The Departments’ rationale may not be perfectly accurate, but it does not make the\n\naccommodation scheme unconstitutional. The class of religious non-profit organizations\n\nencompasses a vast array of religiously affiliated universities, hospitals, service\n\nproviders, and charities, some of them employing thousands of people. Of course, some\n\nreligious non-profit organizations may be more likely than some churches to employ co-\n\nreligionists, but the Departments may reasonably recognize that, on the whole, churches\n\nare more likely to employ those who share their beliefs. Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 272.\n\nThe Departments originally exempted religious employers to “respect[] the unique\n\nrelationship between a house of worship and its employees in ministerial positions.” 76\n\nFed. Reg. at 46,623. We recognize that relationship between houses of worship and\n\nministerial employees has been given special solicitude under the First Amendment. See\n\nHosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. EEOC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"620673\"><a href=\"/opinion/620673/hosanna-tabor-evangelical-lutheran-church-and-school-v-eeoc/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Departments must avoid inquiries that involve them in “excessive\n\nentanglement” between religion and government, see Colorado Christian, 534 F.3d at\n\n1261-62, and the general notion that houses of worship are more likely than religious\n\nnon-profit organizations to employ people of the same faith avoids impermissible\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 89 -\n\fscrutiny into the beliefs of religious entities and their employees.54\n\n                                        * * * *\n\n       Drawing a distinction between religious employers and religious non-profit\n\norganizations is a neutral and reasonable way for the Departments to pursue their\n\nlegitimate goals in a constitutional manner. It gives special solicitude to churches to\n\nfacilitate the liberties guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause, and offers the\n\naccommodation scheme to relieve religious non-profit organizations of their obligation to\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage under the Mandate without imposing a substantial burden\n\non their religious exercise. The accommodation scheme does not violate the\n\nEstablishment Clause.\n\n                                 C. Free Speech Clause\n\n       Plaintiffs finally contend the accommodation scheme violates the Free Speech\n\nClause of the First Amendment, which states that “Congress shall make no law . . .\n\nabridging the freedom of speech,” U.S. Const. amend. 1, by compelling them both to\n\nspeak and remain silent, see Riley v. Nat’l Fed’n of the Blind of N.C., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112141\"><a href=\"/opinion/112141/riley-v-national-federation-of-blind-of-nc-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n796-97 (1988). First, they argue that requiring them to sign and deliver the Form or the\n\nnotification to HHS constitutes compelled speech.

Reg. at 46,623. In response to religious entities\nthat argued these requirements might involve excessive entanglement with religion, the\nDepartments eliminated three of the four criteria and based the definition solely on\norganizational form. 78 Fed. Reg. at 8459. Plaintiffs now contend that simplified\ndefinition makes unfounded assumptions about who religious employers employ.\n\n                                            - 90 -\n\fthem from influencing their TPAs’ provision of contraceptive coverage compels them to\n\nbe silent.

The only act the\n\naccommodation scheme requires is for religious non-profit organizations with group\n\nhealth plans to sign and deliver the Form or notification expressing their religious\n\nobjection to providing contraceptive coverage. The Sixth Circuit reasoned: “Even\n\nassuming the government is compelling this speech, it is not speech that the appellants\n\ndisagree with and so cannot be the basis of a First Amendment claim.” Mich. Catholic\n\nConf., 755 F.3d at 392; see also Geneva Coll., 778 F.3d at 438-39 (“If anything, because\n\nthe appellees specifically state on the self-certification form that they object on religious\n\ngrounds to providing such coverage, it is a declaration that they will not be complicit in\n\nproviding coverage.”). Plaintiffs cannot point to speech they are required to express and\n\nfind objectionable.55\n\n\n       55\n        In Axson-Flynn, we recognized that a compelled speech claim may apply to\nnon-ideological speech.

Plaintiffs do not\n\ndemonstrate their TPA, their health insurance issuer, or HHS—any one of which would\n\nbe the sole recipient of the Form or notification—would view it as anything other than an\n\nobjection to providing contraception. Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & Inst. Rights,\n\nInc. (“FAIR”), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145672\"><a href=\"/opinion/145672/rumsfeld-v-forum-for-academic-and-institutional-rights-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006), is instructive. In FAIR, a group of law schools\n\nchallenged the Solomon Amendment, a federal statute that denied federal funding to\n\nuniversities that barred military recruiters from their campuses. At that time, the military\n\ndid not permit gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals to serve. The schools claimed a\n\nFirst Amendment compelled speech violation, arguing their compliance with the\n\nSolomon Amendment would signal their agreement with this policy. The Supreme Court\n\nrejected the argument, noting compliance did not signal agreement with the military’s\n\npositions, and the Solomon Amendment did not prevent the schools from making their\n\nown position clear. FAIR, 547 U.S. at 65.\n\n       This point is even stronger in the instant case, where Plaintiffs would send the\n\nForm or notification to convey their opposition to providing contraception, and the ACA\n\nand implementing regulations do not prevent them from expressing that opposition\n\nwidely. Plaintiffs remain free to express opposition to contraception; “[n]othing in the[]\n______________________________________\nCont.\n\ncompelled speech violation because she was required to utter certain swear words as part\nof a script and objected to doing so on religious grounds. 356 F.3d at 1284 n.4.\n\n\n                                            - 92 -\n\ffinal regulations prohibits an eligible organization from expressing its opposition to the\n\nuse of contraceptives.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,880 n.41. With the passage of the interim\n\nfinal rule, Plaintiffs also have the option to send a letter or email to HHS expressly\n\nobjecting to any provision of contraception. They can fully explain their position in that\n\nnotification. We are especially unconvinced that this option, freed from the text of the\n\nForm and permitting greater self-expression, forces Plaintiffs to engage in unwanted\n\nspeech. Plaintiffs have not suggested the notification must be conveyed or\n\ncommunicated to any third parties or wider audience aside from the Departments\n\nthemselves.\n\n       Even if Plaintiffs could identify speech they disagreed with—for example,\n\nidentifying the name of their TPA or health insurance issuer—the argument that they are\n\nforced to send a message they do not wish to send is unavailing. The First Amendment\n\ndoes not—and cannot—protect organizations from having to make any and all statements\n\n“they wish to avoid.” The cases cited by Plaintiffs are not about routine administrative\n\nburdens akin to complying with the accommodation scheme.

Burwell, Nos. 13-1540, 14-6026, 14-6028\n\nBALDOCK, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part.\n\n        Today the Court holds, among other things, that the ACA contraceptive Mandate’s\n\naccommodation scheme does not substantially burden religious non-profits that object to\n\nfacilitating contraceptive or abortifacient coverage because opting out does not cause,\n\nauthorize, or otherwise facilitate such coverage.1 The Court’s opinion provides perhaps\n\nthe most thorough explanation of the accommodation scheme’s nuanced mechanics that I\n\nhave yet read. And for argument’s sake, I follow its holding as to the insured plaintiffs’\n\nand Little Sisters plaintiffs’ RFRA claims.2 But I cannot join the Court’s holding as to\n\nthe other self-insured plaintiffs’ RFRA claims, as that holding contradicts the Court’s\n\nown reasoning and thorough explanation of the accommodation scheme.\n\n        In reality, the accommodation scheme forces the self-insured plaintiffs to perform\n\nan act that causes their beneficiaries to receive religiously objected-to coverage. The\n\nfines the government uses to compel this act thus impose a substantial burden on the self-\n\ninsured plaintiffs’ religious exercise. Moreover, less restrictive means exist to achieve\n\nthe government’s contraceptive coverage goals here. I must therefore dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    For consistency, I adopt the Court’s glossary.\n2\n   As I explain below, the Little Sisters plaintiffs, though self-insured, have not shown\nthat their opting out will necessarily cause their plan participants and beneficiaries to\nreceive contraceptive coverage. Accordingly, my use of the term “self-insured plaintiffs”\ndoes not refer to the Little Sisters unless otherwise stated.\n\f          I.     WHEN IS A BURDEN ON RELIGIOUS EXERCISE “SUBSTANTIAL?”\n\n       The first step of a RFRA claim requires plaintiffs to show (1) that the federal\n\ngovernment has imposed a substantial burden on a (2) sincere (3) exercise of religion.\n\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a). The unique threshold question we and so many other\n\ncourts are currently grappling with, however, is how to determine whether a substantial\n\nburden exists where a law compels religious adherents to perform an act they sincerely\n\noppose when this opposition might be based on a faulty understanding of the law.

E.E.O.C. v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 135 S.\n\n                                             2\n\fCt. 2028, 2031–33 (2015) (analyzing a plaintiff’s exercise as a “religious practice” under\n\nTitle VII where the act was motivated by “her understanding of her religion’s\n\nrequirements”).\n\n       These judges assert that whether religious objectors properly understand the legal\n\nsignificance of the compelled act has no bearing on the substantial burden analysis. E.g.\n\nPriests For Life., No. 13-5368, slip op. at 35 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (“But what if the\n\nreligious organizations are misguided in thinking that this scheme . . . makes them\n\ncomplicit in facilitating contraception or abortion? That is not our call to make under the\n\nfirst prong of RFRA.”). And Hobby Lobby supports this position well, as questioning a\n\nreligious adherent’s understanding of the significance of a compelled action comes\n\ndangerously close to questioning “whether the religious belief asserted in a RFRA case is\n\nreasonable”—a “question that the federal courts have no business addressing.” Hobby\n\nLobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2778.\n\n       Under this understanding of RFRA, the accommodation scheme substantially\n\nburdens any religious non-profit that objects to performing an act that would cause or\n\notherwise make it complicit in providing contraceptive coverage simply because the\n\nscheme uses substantial fines to compel an act that the non-profit sincerely believes\n\nwould have that effect. The actual legal significance of the compelled act is irrelevant to\n\nthe substantial burden analysis. And because the government has conceded (2) the\n\nsincerity of (3) the religious exercise at issue, the only issue left to address is whether the\n\ngovernment has shown that the accommodation scheme survives strict scrutiny. The\n\njudges who take this position, so far, all agree that the government has not made this\n\n                                              3\n\fshowing. Priests For Life., No. 13-5368, slip op. at 22–25 (Brown, J., dissenting); id. at\n\n46–51 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting); Notre Dame, 786 F.3d at 629–30 (Flaum, J.,\n\ndissenting); Eternal Word Television Network, 756 F.3d at 1348–49 (Pryor, J. specially\n\nconcurring).\n\n       Notwithstanding the strength of those positions, I will proceed under the following\n\nassumptions to highlight an even deeper problem lurking within the self-insured\n\naccommodation scheme: First, I will assume that whether a burden on religious exercise\n\nis “substantial” turns not only on the amount of coercion the government uses to compel\n\nan act (no one disputes the substantiality of the fines at issue here), but also on “how the\n\nlaw or policy being challenged actually operates and affects religious exercise.” Slip Op.\n\nat 39. Second, I will assume this Court may tell a religious adherent she does not face a\n\nsubstantial burden on her religious exercise if her understanding of the law is flawed.\n\nThird, I will assume that any burden the accommodation scheme imposes on Plaintiffs—\n\nwho object to performing any act that would cause or otherwise make them complicit in\n\nproviding various forms of contraceptive coverage—cannot be substantial unless they\n\nshow, for example, how their compelled act causes that coverage. See Slip Op. at 45–66.\n\n       The Court tells Plaintiffs they cannot make this showing “because opting out\n\nwould not trigger, incentivize, or otherwise cause the provision of contraceptive\n\ncoverage.” Slip Op. at 65. If showing this causation is a prerequisite to establishing a\n\nsubstantial burden, the Court properly rejects the insured plaintiffs’ RFRA claim, as their\n\naction or inaction will not affect whether their plan beneficiaries receive objected-to\n\ncoverage. But the self-insured plaintiffs’ inaction will prevent their plan beneficiaries\n\n                                             4\n\ffrom receiving the coverage. If their beneficiaries receive this coverage, it is only\n\nbecause the self-insured plaintiffs, by opting out, caused that effect. Thus, the self-\n\ninsured plaintiffs have shown how their opting out would cause the provision and receipt\n\nof objected-to coverage and established a substantial burden on their religious exercise.\n\n                     II.     THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION IN THIS CASE\n\n       I have nothing to add to the Court’s summary of the background in these cases,\n\nand very little to add to its explanation of the detailed mechanics of the ACA\n\naccommodation scheme. But a critical distinction within scheme bears repeating. Under\n\nthe ACA accommodation scheme, in the insured health plan context, “a health insurance\n\nissuer . . . would be obligated to provide contraceptive coverage under the ACA whether\n\nor not [the insured non-profit] delivered the Form or notification to HHS.” Slip Op. at 48\n\nn.28 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13). But in the self-insured context, a TPA would be\n\n“authorized and obligated to provide the coverage . . . only if the religious non-profit . . .\n\nopts out.” Slip Op at 49 (emphases added); see also 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(b)(2);\n\n29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2).\n\n       The Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits failed to recognize this distinction.

Cir. 2014).              This Court considers the\n\n                                              5\n\fdistinction “unremarkable.”     Slip Op. at 49.      I disagree.   The distinction makes a\n\ndifference, and juxtaposing the insured plaintiffs and self-insured plaintiffs forces that\n\ndifference into bold relief.\n\n                                   A. The Insured Plaintiffs\n\n       Assuming causation is key, I agree the accommodation scheme does not\n\nsubstantially burden the insured plaintiffs’ religious exercise. As the Court explains,\n\neven total inaction on the part of an insured non-profit still results in its plan participants\n\nand beneficiaries receiving the coverage to which they are entitled under the ACA\n\nbecause the government has independently obligated a third party (insurance issuers) to\n\nprovide it.3 See Slip Op. at 46–47. Opting out in the insured context does not cause the\n\nreceipt of contraceptive coverage; rather, it merely absolves the eligible insured non-\n\nprofit of any responsibility for the contraceptive coverage its plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries will receive whether it opts out or not. Thus, assuming Plaintiffs must show\n\nhow opting out causes coverage, the accommodation scheme does not substantially\n\nburden the insured plaintiffs’ exercise of religion. The insured accommodation is more\n\nakin to traditional conscientious objector schemes: the government can and will conscript\n\nthe actors it needs to achieve its goals whether objectors opt out or not.\n\n       The same cannot be said of the self-insured plaintiffs, however.\n\n\n3\n   Even the government’s proffered fourth option—declining to sponsor a group health\nplan—would not interfere with contraceptive coverage for the insured plaintiffs’ plan\nbeneficiaries. Without an employer-sponsored plan, these beneficiaries would have to\nfind other health insurance. See Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"809122\"><a href=\"/opinion/809122/national-federation-of-independent-business-v-sebelius/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2566</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n2664 (2012) (Scalia, J., dissenting).       And that insurance would likely cover\ncontraceptives. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13.\n                                              6\n\f                                B. The Self-Insured Plaintiffs\n\n       Unlike the insured plaintiffs, the ACA leaves the self-insured plaintiffs in a\n\nposition where, by refusing to opt out, they can prevent their plan beneficiaries from\n\nreceiving the objected-to coverage the beneficiaries are entitled to and would otherwise\n\nreceive under the ACA. In other words, their plan participants and beneficiaries will\n\nreceive the coverage only if they opt out as the government commands. This makes their\n\nopting out a but-for cause of the receipt of the coverage.\n\n       The Court views this ability to prevent contraceptive coverage by inaction as\n\nnothing more than the ability to disobey the law. See Slip Op. at 54–55 & n.35. But that\n\nis the same limited ability the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby possessed, and it goes to the\n\nheart of the substantial burden the self-insured plaintiffs face here. “In Hobby Lobby, the\n\nplaintiff[s] . . . could choose only between (1) complying with the ACA by providing the\n\ncoverage or (2) not complying and paying significant penalties.” Slip Op. at 3 (citing\n\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2759–60). Similarly, these self-insured plaintiffs must\n\nchoose between (1) complying with the ACA by taking an action that ultimately causes\n\ntheir beneficiaries to receive this coverage or (2) not complying and paying significant\n\npenalties. This is a Hobson’s choice, which we have long held imposes a substantial\n\nburden under RFRA. See Abdulhaseeb v. Calbone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1188\"><a href=\"/opinion/1188/abdulhaseeb-v-calbone/\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1315 (10th Cir. 2010)\n\n(“We conclude that a religious exercise is substantially burdened under [RFRA] 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000cc–1(a) when a government . . . presents the plaintiff with a Hobson’s\n\nchoice—an illusory choice where the only realistically possible course of action trenches\n\non an adherent’s sincerely held religious belief.”); Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1141 (10th\n\n                                             7\n\fCir. 2013) (explaining that the choice between compromising religious beliefs and paying\n\nfines under the ACA “is precisely the sort of Hobson’s choice described in\n\nAbdulhaseeb”).\n\n                           1. The Obvious Causal Connection\n\n      If causation is key to showing a substantial burden, see Slip Op. at 32–33, 45–66,\n\nthe self-insured plaintiffs have surely shown that burden. Certainly, a shifting legal\n\nresponsibility alone may not necessarily create a causal relationship. But here, the self-\n\ninsured plaintiffs’ opt out causes the coverage because (1) the government cannot force\n\nplaintiffs themselves to provide the coverage, Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2785, and (2)\n\nthe government cannot shift the ability (let alone the responsibility) to provide the\n\ncoverage to non-objectors unless the self-insured plaintiffs opt out.     See 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 2590.715-2713A(b)(2); Slip Op. at 48–49. Opting out is thus the only way their plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries may receive the coverage.\n\n      Put another way, if the self-insured plaintiffs do not opt out, who will provide the\n\ncoverage for their plan participants and beneficiaries? The answer: no one. The self-\n\ninsured plaintiffs cannot do so per their faith; the TPAs cannot do so per the law. Thus,\n\nthe self-insured accommodation renders any duty to provide, and any entitlement to\n\nreceive, contraceptive coverage wholly unenforceable and thus illusory—unless and until\n\nthe self-insured plaintiffs opt out.   Cf. Pennington v. Northrop Grumman Space &\n\nMission Sys. Corp., 269 F. App’x 812, 819 (10th Cir. 2008) (unpublished) (“[W]hen a\n\npromise, in reality, promises nothing—it is illusory.” (Internal marks and citation\n\nomitted)).\n\n                                            8\n\f       To fully understand why no one can or will provide this objected-to coverage\n\nunless the self-insured plaintiffs perform a compelled act, one must view the ACA\n\nMandate and accommodation scheme in light of Hobby Lobby. Hobby Lobby clearly\n\nholds forcing religious employers to provide objected-to contraceptive coverage violates\n\nRFRA. 134 S. Ct. at 2785. So, if any entity is to provide the coverage, it must be a third\n\nparty. The insured accommodation independently conscripts third parties to provide the\n\ncoverage. But as this Court points out, the self-insured accommodation was drafted such\n\nthat no third party can provide the coverage in the self-insured context unless and until\n\nthe objecting religious employer opts out. Slip Op. at 48–49; see also Eternal Word\n\nTelevision Network, 756 F.3d at 1347 (Pryor, J., specially concurring) (explaining that,\n\nwithout the Form or letter, a TPA “has no legal authority to step into the shoes of the\n\n[non-profit] and provide contraceptive coverage to the employees and beneficiaries of the\n\n[non-profit]”). As such, a third party’s legal authority (i.e. permission) to provide the\n\ncoverage is wholly dependent upon (i.e. caused by) the self-insured non-profit opting out.\n\n       The Court believes we should focus on the fact that the ACA “entitle[s] plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries to coverage whether or not the plaintiffs opt out” and\n\nimposes a duty on “either the religious non-profit organization or the TPA” to provide\n\nthat coverage. Slip Op. at 33, 57. But this reasoning (1) fails to consider the ACA\n\nMandate in light of the limitations Hobby Lobby already imposed, and (2) confuses legal\n\nconcepts (duty and entitlement) with real-world effects (provision and receipt).\n\n       First, the Court’s focus on the ACA’s requirement that “either the religious non-\n\nprofit organization or the TPA” provide the coverage, Slip Op. at 57, ignores the fact that\n\n                                            9\n\fthe government cannot require the religious non-profit to provide the coverage under\n\nHobby Lobby. By ignoring the limitation Hobby Lobby imposes on the government, the\n\nCourt simultaneously acknowledges that “opting out is necessarily a but-for cause of\n\nsomeone else—the TPA—providing contraceptive coverage,” Slip Op. at 56, and\n\nnevertheless rejects the self-insured plaintiffs’ RFRA claims for lack of causation. Slip\n\nOp. at 64–65.     But again, Hobby Lobby forbids the government from placing this\n\nrequirement on the non-profits themselves. So if opting out is necessarily a but-for cause\n\nof someone else providing the coverage, it is necessarily a but-for cause of anyone\n\nproviding the coverage at all. Essentially, the Court concedes but-for cause and then\n\nturns around and denies the existence of any causation. What?\n\n       Second, the Court asserts that the self-insured plaintiffs’ opt out will not cause the\n\nactual provision and receipt of objected-to coverage because the ACA creates an\n\nindependent, albeit illusory, duty and entitlement related to that coverage. True, opting\n\nout does not cause entitlement to contraceptive coverage—the ACA entitles all health\n\nplan beneficiaries to contraceptive coverage. But these beneficiaries will not receive that\n\ncoverage unless the self-insured plaintiffs do something to cause its provision from a\n\nthird party. In other words, the ACA may independently say “someone” has a duty to\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage, see 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715–2713, but no one can or will\n\nhonor that duty and provide the coverage unless the self-insured plaintiffs opt out. No\n\nself-insured plaintiff will honor it because the government cannot force them to under\n\nHobby Lobby, and no third party can honor it because no third party has authority to do\n\nso without an opt out. Based on this error, the Court concludes that “federal law, not the\n\n                                             10\n\factions of the religious objector, ensures that plan participants and beneficiaries will\n\nreceive contraceptive coverage.” Slip Op. at 52 (emphasis added). But that is simply\n\nwrong. As explained above, federal law alone does not ensure receipt of the coverage\n\nfrom the self-insured plaintiffs; and it does not even allow, let alone ensure, receipt of\n\nthat coverage from a third party unless the self-insured plaintiffs opt out. Rather, federal\n\nlaw, only in conjunction with the self-insured plaintiffs’ opt out, allows plan participants\n\nand beneficiaries to receive contraceptive coverage.4\n\n       These errors, taken together, cause the Court to reject a straw man rather than the\n\nself-insured plaintiffs’ RFRA claims. The self-insured plaintiffs do not claim a RFRA\n\nviolation based on the fact that the ACA created an entitlement to contraceptive\n\ncoverage; they object to the causal role they must play in providing that coverage. 5\n\n\n4\n  Even with the opt-out, federal law does not always ensure receipt of the coverage. For\nexample, the Court asserts “the ACA ensures plan participants and beneficiaries will\nreceive contraceptive coverage” but simultaneously contradicts itself by acknowledging\nthat TPAs for self-insured church plans may in fact decline to provide that coverage, in\nwhich case “plan participants and beneficiaries would not get the coverage to which they\nare otherwise entitled.” Slip Op. at 61 & n.41 (emphases added).\n        The Court’s attempt to paint these contradictory positions as consistent suffers\nfrom the same logical flaw highlighted above; that is, it confuses the actual provision and\nreceipt of coverage with a concededly unenforceable entitlement and duty to provide it.\nIf the law cannot force an unwilling TPA to provide contraceptive coverage, the TPA will\nnot provide it, and the plan beneficiaries will not receive it. Cf. Mach Mining, LLC v.\nE.E.O.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2797291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2797291/mach-mining-llc-v-eeoc/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, the existence\nof an unenforceable duty to provide contraceptive coverage does not ensure receipt, as\nthis Court seems to believe.\n5\n  The Court also asserts that religious non-profits “cannot preclude the government from\nrequiring others to provide the legally required coverage in its stead,” Slip Op. at 51–52,\nand “cannot hamstring government efforts to ensure that plan participants and\nbeneficiaries receive the coverage to which they are entitled under the ACA,” Slip Op. at\n                                            11\n\f      A proper accommodation may relieve otherwise substantial burdens on religious\n\nexercise, but this accommodation fails to do so, at least in the self-insured context. And\n\nto be sure, “[a] burden does not rise to the level of being substantial when it places an\n\ninconsequential or de minimis burden on an adherent’s religious exercise.” Slip Op. at 41\n\n(quoting Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 246). But here, the accommodation scheme foists\n\nupon the self-insured plaintiffs a choice with dire consequences. Either (1) they refuse to\n\nact, which would avoid causing their plan beneficiaries to receive objected-to coverage\n\nbut trigger crippling fines for violating the law or (2) they act, which would cause the\n\nreceipt of this coverage and violate their faith.         If “the purpose of religious\n\naccommodation” was to permit religious objectors “to avoid a religious burden and to\n\ncomply with the law,” see Slip Op. at 55, it fails to achieve that purpose. Rather, the\n\naccommodation foists upon the self-insured plaintiffs a Hobson’s choice and thus a\n\nsubstantial burden on their exercise of religion. Abdulhaseeb, 600 F.3d at 1315.\n\n            2. This is Not a Conscientious Objector Accommodation Scheme\n\n      The Court believes this accommodation scheme akin to the conscientious objector\n\nschemes used for military conscription.      See Slip Op. at 52 n.33.       Not so.    The\n\n\n\n71. I agree that this should not be the case but, unfortunately, the government drafted the\nself-insured accommodation such that the self-insured plaintiffs can, by inaction, do\nexactly that. As explained above, that is precisely why their opting out causes the receipt\nof objected-to coverage.\n        Moreover, to the extent this language connotes dissatisfaction with the problems\ncreated by the self-insured accommodation, such dissatisfaction is irrelevant to whether\nthe law imposes a substantial burden under RFRA. Our job is not to “add words to the\nlaw to produce what is thought to be a desirable result.” Abercrombie & Fitch, 135 S. Ct.\nat 2033.\n                                            12\n\faccommodation scheme may function like a conscientious objector scheme in some\n\nregards, but it ultimately forces objectors to play a very different and causal role.\n\n       Military conscription law generally requires male citizens to register for the draft\n\nand allows the President to draft a certain number of men from that pool of candidates\n\ninto active duty in the Armed Forces.6 See, e.g., Arver v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99053\"><a href=\"/opinion/99053/selective-draft-law-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n375–76 (1918) (allowing the President to draft up to two groups of 500,000 men). After\n\nregistering, conscientious objectors can opt out of serving in combat. 50 App. U.S.C.\n\n§ 456(j). But they cannot reduce the number of men the President ultimately drafts.\n\nWhether objectors lawfully register and opt out, or register and then choose unlawfully to\n\navoid induction, or even choose unlawfully not to register at all, the President can and\n\nwill draft the same number of men needed for war. See LAWRENCE M. BASKIR &\n\nWILLIAM A. STRAUSS, CHANCE AND CIRCUMSTANCE: THE DRAFT, THE WAR, AND THE\n\nVIETNAM GENERATION 14–28 (1978) (explaining that the government’s Vietnam draft\n\npolicies “did not care who was drafted as long as enough people were drafted”).\n\n       Indeed, the Court’s reliance on Sheridan v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"312910\"><a href=\"/opinion/312910/gerald-robert-sheridan-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir.\n\n1973), highlights this difference. In Sheridan, the defendant registered for the draft but\n\ndid not lawfully opt out. Instead, he simply refused to be inducted. Id. at 170. But the\n\nresult under conscription law was the same: “another person [was] called in his place.”\n\nId. at 174. In other words, like the insured plaintiffs, no matter what conscientious\n\nobjectors do or refuse to do, the government can and will achieve its military draft goals.\n\n6\n  Currently, “every male citizen of the United States . . . between the ages of eighteen\nand twenty-six” must register in order to facilitate any eventual conscription into the\nArmed Forces. 50 App. U.S.C. § 453(a).\n                                             13\n\f       The opposite result occurs under the self-insured accommodation scheme. If a\n\nself-insured plaintiff simply refuses to provide coverage and does not opt out, the\n\ngovernment cannot call a third party in its place. The accommodation scheme thus places\n\nthe self-insured plaintiffs in a very different position vis-à-vis helping the government\n\nachieve its religiously objectionable goals. Conscientious objectors cannot prevent the\n\ngovernment from conscripting their replacements; but the self-insured plaintiffs can\n\ncompletely prevent the government from even authorizing their TPAs to provide\n\nobjected-to coverage. Conscientious objectors also need not identify a related third party\n\nto serve in their stead; but the self-insured plaintiffs must identify a related third party\n\nthrough a form or letter.     And this form or letter is the only means by which the\n\ngovernment can authorize that third party to serve in their stead. Under conscientious\n\nobjector schemes, the government may independently draft non-objecting Americans into\n\ncombat to further its war efforts; conscientious objectors have no power to stop it. But\n\nunder the self-insured accommodation scheme the government needs the self-insured\n\nplaintiffs to commit an act to further its contraceptive coverage efforts; their beneficiaries\n\nwill not receive this coverage unless they commit that act and cause that result. Such a\n\nconscientious objector scheme—where the government could draft a replacement soldier\n\nonly if the initial conscientious objector opted out and identified a previously ineligible\n\nrelative to serve in his stead—would be immensely problematic, to say the least.7\n\n\n7\n  The Court attempts to counter this point by referencing the Enrollment Act of 1863,\nwhich “permitted a draftee to avoid service only by either providing a substitute or\npaying $300.” Slip Op. at 52 n.33 (quoting Act of March 3, 1863, ch. 75, § 13, 12 Stat.\n731, 733 (1863)). But this act was a short-lived experiment that did not even survive to\n                                             14\n\f       In relying on conscientious objector schemes the Court commits the same error it\n\nlevies against this dissent: it fails to appreciate the broader structures of both the\n\naccommodation and conscientious objector schemes. In comparing the two schemes, the\n\nCourt focuses only on the acts the objector must perform to opt out, and what happens if\n\nthe objector performs those acts. The comparison totally ignores the broader and more\n\ncritical difference between the two schemes: what happens if the objector refuses to\n\nperform those acts? Conscription law requires that “someone” go to war, and in the end\n\n“someone” will go to war. The law is such that the government can and will shift this\n\nlegal duty to a non-objector regardless of the objector’s action or inaction. Conversely,\n\nthe ACA says “someone” must provide contraceptive coverage, but the self-insured\n\naccommodation was drafted such that if the self-insured plaintiffs choose to do nothing\n\nrather than opt out, no one will actually provide that coverage. Again, the government\n\ncannot force the plaintiffs to provide the coverage, and it cannot shift the duty to provide\n\nthe coverage unless the self-insured plaintiffs choose to opt out. If the government could\n\nindependently shift this duty (as conscription law allows) or eliminate the need to shift\n\nthe duty at all (as the insured accommodation does) that might eliminate the causal role\n\nthe end of that war. Moreover, resentment over the Enrollment Act and its opt-out\nprovision triggered the “New York City draft riot, the largest [and deadliest] civil\ninsurrection in American history apart from the South’s rebellion itself.” ERIC FONER,\nRECONSTRUCTION: AMERICA’S UNFINISHED REVOLUTION 1863–1877 at 32 (1988). “No\ncase questioning the Civil War draft was heard by the Supreme Court, but it is known\nthat Chief Justice Roger Taney prepared a rough outline of an opinion declaring the act\nunconstitutional.” Leon Friedman, Conscription and the Constitution, 67 MICH. L. REV.\n1493, 1546 (1969). Indeed, one eminent historian called the substitution provision a\n“grotesque monstrosit[y]” and stated “[t]he government could hardly have devised a\nworse law.” BRUCE CATTON, THE CIVIL WAR 208 (1987). I would call that problematic.\n\n                                            15\n\fthe self-insured plaintiffs currently face. But presently, the law forces the self-insured\n\nplaintiffs into gatekeeping positions and then uses fines to force them to open the gates.\n\n           3. The Supreme Court’s Little Sisters and Wheaton College Orders\n\n       The Court also believes the accommodation scheme does not impose a substantial\n\nburden on self-insured non-profits because the government’s new alternative notice\n\naccommodation—which forces an objecting non-profit to write a letter to HHS opting out\n\nand identifying its TPAs and/or health insurance issuers—is essentially akin to the\n\nSupreme Court’s injunctions pending appeal in Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the\n\nAged, Denver, Colorado v. Sebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Slip Op. at 42 n.25, 59 n.39.\n\nBut the Court’s reliance on these interim orders appears to be based on two flawed\n\nassumptions: (1) that the notices required by these orders were sufficient to authorize a\n\nTPA to provide coverage it could not provide before, and (2) even assuming this dubious\n\ninterpretation of the orders, that they approved of compelling religious non-profits to play\n\nthis causal role under RFRA’s first step (no substantial burden) as opposed to approving\n\nof such compulsion only where it satisfies RFRA’s second step (strict scrutiny).\n\n       As to the first assumption, the Little Sisters order nowhere contemplates allowing\n\nthe government to use the Little Sisters’ interim written notice to facilitate coverage by\n\nalternative means. And the Wheaton College order did not allow the government to rely\n\non Wheaton’s interim written notice, either. Rather, it allowed the government to rely on\n\npreexisting knowledge that Wheaton qualified for exemption and would not provide\n\n                                            16\n\fcertain contraceptive coverage. See Wheaton Coll., 134 S. Ct. at 2807 (“But [Wheaton]\n\nhas already notified the Government—without using EBSA Form 700—that it meets the\n\nrequirements for exemption from the contraceptive coverage requirement on religious\n\ngrounds. Nothing in this order precludes the Government from relying on this notice, to\n\nthe extent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provision of full contraceptive\n\ncoverage under the Act.” (emphases added)). Moreover, as Justice Sotomayor’s dissent\n\nin Wheaton College shows, the written notices required in Wheaton College, Little\n\nSisters, and Zubik were insufficient to authorize TPA coverage under the then-effective\n\naccommodation, and may remain insufficient even under the new alternative\n\naccommodation. See Wheaton Coll., 134 S. Ct. at 2814 n.6 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).8\n\n       To the extent Wheaton College allows the government to rely on its knowledge of\n\nWheaton’s objection, this merely tracks the Supreme Court’s decision in Bowen v. Roy,\n\nwhere the Court rejected a Free Exercise challenge to the government’s use of a social\n\nsecurity number it already possessed and concluded that the First Amendment does not\n\n“require the government to conduct its own internal affairs in ways that comport with the\n\nreligious beliefs of particular citizens.” 476 U.S. at 693, 699 (1986). But importantly:\n\n\n\n8\n    That is, even under the new alternative notice scheme, the “information necessary to\nverify applicants’ eligibility under 26 CFR §54.9815-2713A(a),” see Zubik, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">3947586</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1, does not contain all the information required by the regulations and thus\nmight not qualify as a valid opt out sufficient to trigger TPA coverage, see 29 C.F.R. §\n2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii)(B) (requiring the self-insured organization to provide, among\nother things “the plan name and type . . . and the name and contact information for any of\nthe plan’s third party administrators”); Wheaton Coll., 134 S. Ct. at 2814 n.6 (Sotomayor,\nJ., dissenting).\n\n                                            17\n\f       a majority of justices [in Roy] indicated that the requirement that applicants\n       furnish a social security number was a different matter. Five justices either\n       concluded or strongly suggested that the government could not require an\n       applicant to provide the number on a benefits application if the applicant\n       had a sincere religious objection to doing so.\n\nUniv. of Notre Dame v.

See Wheaton Coll. v. Burwell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 939, 944 (N.D. Ill. 2014) (Wheaton “offers its health insurance pursuant to\n\nsix plans: two insured HMO plans, a [grandfathered] PPO plan, two self-funded\n\nprescription drug plans, and an insured student health plan.” (footnote omitted)). Thus,\n\nunlike the wholly self-insured Little Sisters, the government might independently ensure\n\nthat an issuer from at least one of these insured health plans provides full contraceptive\n\ncoverage to at least some of Wheaton’s various plan beneficiaries under the current ACA\n\nregime without forcing Wheaton to play a causal role in the receipt of that coverage.\n\n       Thus, the Little Sisters, Wheaton College, and Zubik orders allow religious non-\n\nprofits to simply notify the government that they qualify for exemption and will not\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage.      The government may use its knowledge of these\n\n                                            18\n\fobjections when choosing between independently available alternative means to ensure\n\ncoverage is provided (as the conscientious objector and insured schemes do). But these\n\norders do not allow the government to compel religious non-profits to furnish the\n\ndocument that is essential to cause their plan beneficiaries to receive objected-to\n\ncoverage.\n\n       And yet, suppose these orders could be read to say that the written notices they\n\nrequired were legally sufficient to authorize a previously ineligible TPA to provide\n\nobjected-to coverage. Under that dubious interpretation, the orders would indeed force\n\nself-insured religious objectors to perform an act that causes the ultimate provision of the\n\ncoverage, as they would make the provision of the coverage wholly contingent upon the\n\nreligious objectors’ acts of providing HHS with that notice. For all the reasons discussed\n\nabove, that interpretation of the orders would impose a substantial burden on the self-\n\ninsured plaintiffs’ exercise of religion.\n\n       So, turning to the Court’s second assumption, even under its dubious interpretation\n\nof the orders, the orders nowhere say that forcing religious non-profits to play this sort of\n\ncausal role avoids imposing a substantial burden on their religious exercise. Instead,\n\nassuming the Court’s interpretation of these orders is correct, these orders would impose\n\na substantial burden under RFRA’s first step and therefore must comply with RFRA’s\n\nsecond step (strict scrutiny). Indeed, Judge Kavanaugh has compellingly argued that\n\nthese orders simply set forth a less restrictive means of achieving the government’s\n\ncompelling interest in facilitating access to contraceptive coverage. See Priests For Life,\n\nNo. 13-5368, slip op. at 46–51 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). These orders do not require\n\n                                             19\n\freligious non-profits to identify related third parties for the government to authorize and\n\npossibly conscript in their stead. Rather, they only require the non-profits to inform HHS\n\nthat they qualify for exemption and will not provide objected-to coverage. As discussed\n\nabove regarding conscientious objector schemes, a significant difference exists between\n\nasking a religious objector to say simply “no” and compelling that objector to identify a\n\nrelated entity to serve as a scapegoat where no one else can.9\n\n                4. ERISA-Bound Plans v. ERISA-Exempt Church Plans\n\n       The burden the self-insured plaintiffs face is most salient with regards to Southern\n\nNazarene, whose TPA is subject to ERISA enforcement and therefore will be not only\n\nauthorized but also required to provide contraceptives to the participants and\n\nbeneficiaries of Southern Nazarene’s self-insured plan only if Southern Nazarene opts\n\nout. See 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2). Southern Nazarene’s opt out will thus\n\nclearly cause someone to provide contraceptive coverage where no one would or could\n\nbefore.\n\n       But the lack of an enforcement mechanism as to ERISA-exempt church plans does\n\nnot itself remove the causal role and substantial burden that the accommodation scheme\n\nfoists upon the church-plan plaintiffs. For example, the Guidestone Plan is an ERISA-\n\nexempt church plan, but at least one of its TPAs, Highmark, has indicated it will provide\n\nfull contraceptive coverage for those self-insured organizations that use the Guidestone\n\nPlan and validly opt out. And plaintiffs Reaching Souls, Truett-McConnell College, and\n\n\n9\n  Moreover, this less restrictive means of achieving the same goal necessarily dooms the\ncurrent self-insured accommodation scheme under strict scrutiny. See infra Part III.\n                                            20\n\fMid-America Christian University are all self-insured plaintiffs that use the Guidestone\n\nPlan. Slip Op. at 21; SN Supp. Br. II at 9 n.2. So even though their opting out might not\n\ntrigger an enforceable duty to provide objected-to coverage, these church plan plaintiffs\n\nhave established that their opting out will actually cause Highmark to provide the\n\ncoverage—coverage it cannot provide unless they opt out.\n\n       True, given the repeal of the accommodation scheme’s non-interference provision,\n\nchurch plans like the Guidestone Plan might try to fire TPAs like Highmark and replace\n\nthem with TPAs that promise not to provide coverage for objected-to contraceptives, and\n\nthose plaintiffs that use the Guidestone Plan might be able to fire Guidestone if it refuses\n\nto do so. See RS Oral at 12:57–13:10. Thus, by economic coercion, these plaintiffs\n\nmight be able to ultimately stop the provision of the coverage they were initially forced to\n\ncause. But, the government maintains that “such conduct is generally unlawful and is\n\nprohibited under . . . state and federal laws.” See 79 Fed. Reg. at 51,095. And none of\n\nthis changes the present fact that if plaintiffs who use the Guidestone Plan opt out, they\n\nwill cause Highmark to perform a religiously objected-to act on their behalf where\n\nHighmark previously could not do so. Thus, those self-insured plaintiffs that use the\n\nGuidestone Plan have shown “presently threatened injuries” warranting injunctive relief.\n\nConnecticut v. Massachusetts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101678\"><a href=\"/opinion/101678/connecticut-v-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 674 (1931).\n\n       The Little Sisters plaintiffs, on the other hand, have not established this causal\n\nconnection. The Little Sisters’ primary TPA, Brothers Services, is not bound by ERISA\n\nand has promised not to provide contraceptive coverage even if Little Sisters opts out.\n\nLittle Sisters asserts that Brothers Trust also uses other TPAs who might choose to\n\n                                            21\n\fprovide contraceptive coverage if they opt out, but they have not sufficiently developed\n\nthis theory to bear the burden of establishing that their opting out will presently cause\n\nsomeone to provide contraceptive coverage to their plan beneficiaries.\n\n      The Court also suggests self-insured non-profits “could relieve themselves of any\n\nlingering doubts they may have about causation by [1] employing an insured plan, [2]\n\nemploying a self-insured church plan where the Departments lack authority to enforce the\n\nMandate against their TPA, or [3] administering the self-insured plan on their own in-\n\nhouse without using a TPA.” Slip Op. at 52 n.32. But none of these options alleviate the\n\nsubstantial burden the accommodation scheme imposes. First, choosing to switch from a\n\nself-insured plan, where no coverage can be provided without an opt out, to an insured\n\nplan, where coverage will be provided by a third party, would simply mean choosing to\n\ncause that coverage by switching plans rather than opting out. Second, as discussed\n\nabove, even in the church plan context, opting out may still cause a TPA to provide the\n\ncoverage. Third, no plaintiff in this case administers its plan in-house. So to the extent\n\nthe Court opines on the legal effect the ACA Mandate might have on a plan not at issue\n\nin this case, the Court impermissibly exceeds its jurisdiction by “advising what the law\n\nwould be upon a hypothetical state of facts.” Lewis v. Cont’l Bank Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112389\"><a href=\"/opinion/112389/lewis-v-continental-bank-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n477 (1990) (quoting North Carolina v.

Healy, Self-Administering, Insuring and Funding Benefit Plans, 197–\n\n213 in HUMAN RESOURCES (Thompson 2007 Summer Edition).\n\n          C. Summing Up the Substantial Burden On the Self-Insured Plaintiffs\n\n       The Court concludes that the Plaintiffs’ causation arguments fail because “opting\n\nout would not trigger, incentivize, or otherwise cause the provision of contraceptive\n\ncoverage.” Slip Op. at 65–66. This conclusion is correct in the insured context. But the\n\nself-insured plaintiffs, with the exception of Little Sisters, have shown exactly how their\n\nact of opting out will cause someone to provide contraceptive coverage where their\n\nrefusal to act would prevent that result. Unfortunately, the Court fails to see this obvious\n\ncausal relationship because it ignores the clear holding of Hobby Lobby and fails to\n\ncomprehend the difference between unenforceable entitlement and actual receipt. The\n\ngovernment has left self-insured plaintiffs in a position where they must decide whether\n\ntheir beneficiaries will actually receive objected-to contraceptive coverage.           The\n\naccommodation does not absolve these plaintiffs of this responsibility. Instead, it forces\n\nthem to either (1) violate their sincere religious beliefs by performing an action that will\n\ncause their beneficiaries to receive objected-to coverage, or (2) violate the law and incur\n\nsteep fines to obey those religious beliefs. Again, this is a Hobson’s choice and thus a\n\nsubstantial burden on their religious exercise under RFRA.

STRICT SCRUTINY\n\n       Because the government has imposed a substantial burden on at least the self-\n\ninsured plaintiffs’ religious exercise, under RFRA it must demonstrate that this burden is\n\n“(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive\n\nmeans of furthering that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1. Our\n\nprecedent currently holds the government has no compelling interest in contraceptive\n\ncoverage. See Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1143. But even assuming such a compelling\n\ninterest, see Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2780 (assuming the same), 2785–86 (Kennedy,\n\nJ., concurring), 2799 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting), the government cannot show this scheme\n\nis the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. As discussed above, the Supreme\n\nCourt’s interim orders in Little Sisters,      Wheaton College, and Zubik, even when\n\ninterpreted so as to force self-insured non-profits to play a necessary causal role in\n\ncontraceptive coverage, provide a less restrictive means of achieving the same goal. See\n\nPriests For Life, No. 13-5368, slip op. at 46–51 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).            The\n\nexistence of this less restrictive means dooms the current accommodation scheme under\n\nstrict scrutiny. Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2781–82.\n\n                                     IV.

Ct. at 2760, a liberty essential to our country’s\n\nconstitutional tradition, albeit with boundaries difficult to define, see id. at 2785\n\n(Kennedy, J., concurring). The Court today makes causation one of those boundaries.\n\nEven assuming this boundary, however, the self-insured plaintiffs in this case, with the\n\n                                             24\n\fexception of the Little Sisters plaintiffs, have clearly shown how their compelled act will\n\ncause their plan beneficiaries to receive objected-to coverage that they could not\n\notherwise receive. Therefore, I dissent from the Court’s holding regarding these self-\n\ninsured plaintiffs. Even assuming a causation requirement, I would still hold these self-\n\ninsured plaintiffs have shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their\n\nRFRA claim and that the other requirements for a preliminary injunction are met. I\n\nwould therefore affirm the district court’s denial of a preliminary injunction in Little\n\nSisters, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.
