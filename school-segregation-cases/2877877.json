We dismiss the appeal\nas moot.\n\n       In 1983, the SSD, the Board of Education of the City of St. Louis (City Board),\nthe Caldwell and Liddell plaintiffs, and the United States entered into an agreement and\nsubsequently submitted a special education plan to the district court to settle claims\ninvolving special education services, arising from the pending desegregation litigation.\nThe plan provided for certain students to receive special education services, teacher\ntransfers and exchanges, grievance procedures, and the establishment of a funding\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\fmechanism. The plan also provided for direct city-to-county transfers of students with\nmoderate and severe disabilities who require more than 50% of their instructional time\nin self-contained special education classrooms. These students are designated as Phase\nII and Phase III students.\n\n       In 1985, after a fairness hearing, the district court approved the plan to be\nimplemented in the 1985-86 school year. The district court noted that the SSD was not\nrequired under the plan to accept a specific number of Phase II or III direct transfer\nstudents, but provided that acceptance of students was to be decided cooperatively by\nthe local school districts and the SSD on the basis of space availability. An added\nrestriction was that the assignment of transfer students could not contribute to racial\nsegregation. In the first two years under the plan, the SSD accepted only 3 Phase II\ndirect transfer students out of over 400 applicants. For the next eight years, the SSD\nhas accepted no Phase II or III direct transfer students while over 1,100 students have\napplied.\n\n        In 1995, the City Board negotiated with the SSD to accept fifteen Phase II direct\ntransfer students for the 1995-96 school year. The SSD, however, did not enroll any\ndirect transfer students in that year or in the 1996-97 school year. The City Board filed\na motion to enforce the SSD&s agreement to accept fifteen direct transfer students. The\nSSD argued it was not contractually obligated to accept direct transfer students during\nthe 1997-98 school year. The SSD further argued that under the plan it was not\nrequired to accept a particular number of direct transfer students, the host district must\nfirst determine the availability of space or the appropriate special education service, and\nassignment could not contribute to racial segregation.\n\n        The district court rejected the SSD&s arguments and concluded that the record\nestablished that the SSD had not made a good-faith effort to comply with the plan. The\ndistrict court granted the City Board&s motion, concluding that, although the 1995-96\n\n\n                                            5\n\fagreement might no longer be binding on the SSD, it represented evidence of what\nwould be a reasonable number of students for the SSD to accept in a given school year.\n\n        The City Board argues that because fifteen Phase II students were accepted and\nenrolled in the SSD for the 1997-98 school year, this appeal is moot. We agree.\nDuring oral argument, the SSD agreed that this appeal is moot as to the fifteen students.\nDue to educational and practical considerations, the SSD indicated it would not return\nthe fifteen students even were we to reverse the district court&s order. The order which\nis the subject of this appeal does not address future years. Because there is no effective\nrelief for us to grant, we conclude this appeal is moot. See Beck v.

We dismiss the appeal\nas moot.\n\n       In 1983, the SSD, the Board of Education of the City of St. Louis (City Board),\nthe Caldwell and Liddell plaintiffs, and the United States entered into an agreement and\nsubsequently submitted a special education plan to the district court to settle claims\ninvolving special education services, arising from the pending desegregation litigation.\nThe plan provided for certain students to receive special education services, teacher\ntransfers and exchanges, grievance procedures, and the establishment of a funding\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\fmechanism. The plan also provided for direct city-to-county transfers of students with\nmoderate and severe disabilities who require more than 50% of their instructional time\nin self-contained special education classrooms. These students are designated as Phase\nII and Phase III students.\n\n       In 1985, after a fairness hearing, the district court approved the plan to be\nimplemented in the 1985-86 school year. The district court noted that the SSD was not\nrequired under the plan to accept a specific number of Phase II or III direct transfer\nstudents, but provided that acceptance of students was to be decided cooperatively by\nthe local school districts and the SSD on the basis of space availability. An added\nrestriction was that the assignment of transfer students could not contribute to racial\nsegregation. In the first two years under the plan, the SSD accepted only 3 Phase II\ndirect transfer students out of over 400 applicants. For the next eight years, the SSD\nhas accepted no Phase II or III direct transfer students while over 1,100 students have\napplied.\n\n        In 1995, the City Board negotiated with the SSD to accept fifteen Phase II direct\ntransfer students for the 1995-96 school year. The SSD, however, did not enroll any\ndirect transfer students in that year or in the 1996-97 school year. The City Board filed\na motion to enforce the SSD&s agreement to accept fifteen direct transfer students. The\nSSD argued it was not contractually obligated to accept direct transfer students during\nthe 1997-98 school year. The SSD further argued that under the plan it was not\nrequired to accept a particular number of direct transfer students, the host district must\nfirst determine the availability of space or the appropriate special education service, and\nassignment could not contribute to racial segregation.\n\n        The district court rejected the SSD&s arguments and concluded that the record\nestablished that the SSD had not made a good-faith effort to comply with the plan. The\ndistrict court granted the City Board&s motion, concluding that, although the 1995-96\n\n\n                                            5\n\fagreement might no longer be binding on the SSD, it represented evidence of what\nwould be a reasonable number of students for the SSD to accept in a given school year.\n\n        The City Board argues that because fifteen Phase II students were accepted and\nenrolled in the SSD for the 1997-98 school year, this appeal is moot. We agree.\nDuring oral argument, the SSD agreed that this appeal is moot as to the fifteen students.\nDue to educational and practical considerations, the SSD indicated it would not return\nthe fifteen students even were we to reverse the district court&s order. The order which\nis the subject of this appeal does not address future years. Because there is no effective\nrelief for us to grant, we conclude this appeal is moot. See Beck v.
