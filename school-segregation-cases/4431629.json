See TEX.\nPENAL CODE ANN. § 21.02 (West Supp. 2014). The trial court assessed Appellant’s\npunishment at confinement for a term of twenty-five years. We affirm.\n      Appellant presents four issues on appeal. In his first two issues, he challenges\nthe sufficiency of the evidence. Appellant argues in his third issue that the trial court\nerred when it excluded evidence that Appellant offered to impeach the testimony of\n\fthe victim. In his fourth issue, Appellant alleges that the trial court erred when it\nadmitted hearsay testimony.\n      We will first address Appellant’s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.\nAppellant argues in his first issue that the evidence is insufficient to prove that the\nalleged acts of sexual abuse occurred during a period that was thirty days or more in\nduration and argues in his second issue that the evidence was insufficient to prove\nthat the alleged acts occurred on or after September 1, 2007. We review the\nsufficiency of the evidence under the standard of review set forth in Jackson v.\nVirginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979). Brooks v. State, 323 S.W.3d 893, 912 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2010); Polk v. State, 337 S.W.3d 286, 288–89 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2010, pet.\nref’d). Under the Jackson standard, we examine all of the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the verdict and determine whether, based on that evidence and any\nreasonable inferences from it, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\nelements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319; Isassi\nv. State, 330 S.W.3d 633, 638 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). The jury, as the trier of fact,\nis the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and of the weight to be given their\ntestimony. TEX. CODE. CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 36.13 (West 2007), art. 38.04 (West\n1979). As such, the jury is entitled to accept or reject any or all of the testimony of\nany witness. Adelman v. State, 828 S.W.2d 418, 421 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992). It is\nalso within the jury’s province to resolve any inconsistencies or conflicts in the\nwitnesses’ testimony. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319.\n      A person commits the offense of continuous sexual abuse of a child when that\nperson commits two or more acts of sexual abuse during a period of thirty days or\nmore in duration. PENAL § 21.02(b)(1). “The legislature created the offense of\ncontinuous sexual abuse of a child in response to a need to address sexual assaults\nagainst young children who are normally unable to identify the exact dates of the\noffenses when there are ongoing acts of sexual abuse.” Michell v. State, 381 S.W.3d\n                                           2\n\f554, 561 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2012, no pet.). The offense became effective on\nSeptember 1, 2007, and the statute does not apply to acts that were committed prior\nto that date. Kuhn v. State, 393 S.W.3d 519, 524 (Tex. App.—Austin 2013, pet.\nref’d). An “act of sexual abuse” includes indecency with a child, other than touching\nthe breast, as provided by Section 21.11(a)(1); sexual assault under Section 22.011;\nand aggravated sexual assault under Section 22.021. PENAL § 21.02(c)(2)–(4). Here,\nthe grand jury indicted Appellant for the following specific acts of sexual abuse:\n(1) aggravated sexual assault by penetrating G.F.’s sexual organ with his finger;\n(2) indecency by touching G.F.’s genitals; (3) indecency by touching G.F.’s breast;\nand (4) indecency by causing G.F. to touch his genitals. The jury was instructed on\neach of these specific acts, except for indecency by touching G.F.’s breast. The jury\nwas “not required to agree unanimously on which specific acts of sexual abuse were\ncommitted by the defendant or the exact date when those acts were committed.” Id.\n§ 21.02(d). But, the jury was required to “agree unanimously that the defendant,\nduring a period that is 30 or more days in duration, committed two or more acts of\nsexual abuse.” Id.\n      The complainant, G.F., was Appellant’s granddaughter. She testified that\nAppellant started to abuse her when she was in fifth grade. At first, Appellant\nwanted her to kiss him. This occurred on Bridge Street in Abilene. Then Appellant\ndid something else: he touched her in a “bad place.” The first “bad place” that he\ntouched her was on her breasts outside of her clothes. He also touched her on her\nbreasts underneath her clothes. G.F. testified that the next area that Appellant\ntouched was her “private.” He went underneath her pants. Later that summer, she\nmoved to the Abilene North Apartments. Appellant continued to touch her. He\ntouched her under her pants and shirt. He touched her breasts and touched her “pee-\npee.” He tried to stick his finger inside of her “pee-pee,” but she moved his finger.\nThis happened more than once. Appellant also asked her to touch his “pee-pee.”\n                                          3\n\fShe testified that she saw his “pee-pee” and touched it. He showed her how he\nwanted to be touched; he wanted her to use both hands.\n      G.F. testified that she did not start the sixth grade in Abilene. She went to\nvisit family in South Dakota. Appellant was with her, and he touched her in South\nDakota as well. The abuse lasted for the “whole summer” before she moved to South\nDakota and for the “whole time” she was in South Dakota. The abuse stopped when\nshe moved back to Abilene.\n      On cross-examination, G.F. admitted that she told Melinda Beard, the forensic\ninterviewer, that the first time it happened was in fourth grade at the house on Bridge\nStreet and that there was no touching, just kissing. She agreed that was the summer\nof 2007. She also admitted that she told Beard that nothing else happened until South\nDakota, which was the summer of her sixth grade year, and that she did not let him\nput his finger in her. On redirect, she agreed that she did not tell Beard the whole\nstory; she was not ready.\n      Beard testified that G.F. told her that the abuse started when she was in fourth\ngrade and that she thought it was the summer. G.F. was fourteen years old when\nBeard interviewed her on August 22, 2011. G.F. also told her that it happened once\nin Abilene and that all the other times were in South Dakota. Beard explained that\nG.F. told her some things, but she did not know whether G.F. was able to tell her\neverything that happened.\n      Susan Sutton, the girlfriend of G.F.’s father, testified that she met G.F. when\nG.F. was in the fourth or fifth grade. G.F. came to live with Sutton in March 2011;\nshe had been living in South Dakota.\n      In addition to the specific testimony above, the State created a timeline that\nshowed what grade G.F. was in and what age she was during the years 2007 through\n2011. The timeline shows that G.F. was born in December 1996. The timeline also\nshows that she was in fourth grade in Abilene from September 2007 to May 2008,\n                                           4\n\fthat she was in fifth grade in Abilene from September 2008 to May 2009, that she\nwas in sixth grade in South Dakota from September 2009 to May 2010, and that she\nwas in seventh grade in South Dakota from September 2010 to March 2011. She\nmoved back to Abilene from South Dakota in the middle of her seventh grade year.\n      During his interview with police, Appellant admitted that he touched G.F.’s\nbreast and that he “rubbed” her a couple of times; there was no penetration.\nAppellant also admitted that it happened in Abilene and South Dakota. It happened\nmore times in South Dakota than it did in Abilene, but it happened a few times in\nAbilene. He was not sure whether G.F. was ten, eleven, or twelve when it started;\nhe gave each of those ages throughout the interview. When police interviewed\nAppellant in September 2011, Appellant was sixty-three years old.\n      There is no question in this case that the evidence is sufficient to show that\nAppellant abused G.F. on multiple occasions over several years. Appellant argues,\nhowever, that the evidence does not show that the abuse occurred in Texas after\nSeptember 1, 2007, and for a period of thirty days or more in duration. We disagree.\nThe jury is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence. Jackson, 443\nU.S. at 319. The evidence shows that G.F. moved to South Dakota to go to sixth\ngrade and that the abuse lasted the “whole time” that she was in South Dakota as\nwell as at least the “whole summer” before she moved to South Dakota. The summer\nbefore she moved to South Dakota would have been the summer of 2009. G.F.\nwould have been twelve at that time, given that she was born in December 1996.\nAlthough G.F. did not provide specific dates as to when the abuse in Texas occurred,\nshe agreed that it occurred the “whole summer” before she moved to South Dakota.\nShe testified that some instances occurred on Bridge Street and some instances\noccurred at the Abilene North Apartments.\n      The jury could have reasonably concluded that the “whole summer” was a\nperiod of time that lasted at least thirty days. “Summer” typically means the time\n                                         5\n\fduring the year when children are out of school. One definition of “summer” is “the\nseason between spring and autumn comprising in the northern hemisphere usu[ally]\nthe months of June, July, and August or as reckoned astronomically extending from\nthe June solstice to the September equinox.” MERRIAM-WEBSTER’S COLLEGIATE\nDICTIONARY 1250 (11th ed. 2004). Here, the school years were referred to as lasting\nfrom September through May. Thus, it is a reasonable inference that the summer\nlasted from June through August. We have reviewed the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the verdict, and we hold that a rational trier of fact could have found\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant committed two acts of sexual abuse\nagainst G.F. after September 1, 2007, and that the acts occurred over a period of time\nthat was at least thirty days in duration. We overrule Appellant’s first and second\nissues.\n      Appellant contends in his third issue that the trial court erred when it excluded\nthe video recording of Beard’s forensic interview of G.F. Defense counsel offered\nthe recording to impeach G.F. by showing that G.F.’s trial testimony was\ninconsistent with her prior statements. Appellant concedes that the video is not a\npart of the appellate record; however, he alleges that it is apparent from the record\nthat the video contained some information that could have been used to impeach\nG.F.’s testimony. Even if we were to agree that the content is apparent from the\nrecord, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion when it excluded the\nvideo. When defense counsel argued that the video should come in as a prior\ninconsistent statement made by G.F., the trial court responded: “I’m not disagreeing\nwith you but you offered the whole video. You didn’t offer parts of it that would\nimpeach her so until you do that I’m not going to admit it.” Defense counsel did not\nmake an attempt to redact the video, nor did counsel re-offer any specific portion of\nthe video. “When a trial judge is presented with a proffer of evidence containing\nboth admissible and inadmissible statements and the proponent of the evidence fails\n                                          6\n\fto segregate and specifically offer the admissible statements, the trial court may\nproperly exclude all of the statements.” Willover v. State, 70 S.W.3d 841, 847 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2002). Therefore, the trial court did not err when it denied Appellant’s\nrequest to admit the entire video. We overrule Appellant’s third issue.\n      In his fourth issue, Appellant asserts that the trial court erred when it admitted\nhearsay testimony by Sutton. Sutton testified that G.F. called her and said that G.F.\nwanted to come live with her and G.F.’s father. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement\noffered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. TEX. R. EVID. 801(d).\nHearsay is not admissible unless provided by statute, the Rules of Evidence, or by\nother rules prescribed under statutory authority. TEX. R. EVID. 802.\n      The State contends that this testimony was not offered for the truth of the\nmatter asserted but was offered to show what Sutton did with the information and to\nshow that G.F. moved back to Abilene. See Meier v. State, No. 07-08-0209-CR,\n2009 WL 3335282, at *5 (Tex. App.—Amarillo Oct. 16, 2009, pet. ref’d) (mem. op.,\nnot designated for publication) (holding that testimony was not hearsay when\nwitness testified about a phone call she received and what she did with the\ninformation that she learned during the call). We agree that the testimony at issue\nwas not offered for the truth of what G.F. said during the phone call, but was instead\noffered to show that G.F. called and that, as a result, Sutton and G.F.’s father moved\nher back to Abilene. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it\noverruled Appellant’s hearsay objection.\n      However, even if the trial court did err, we find that the error did not affect\nAppellant’s substantial rights. Pursuant to TEX. R. APP. P. 44.2(b), an error is not\nreversible error unless it affects a substantial right of the defendant. A substantial\nright is affected when the error has a substantial and injurious effect or influence in\ndetermining the jury’s verdict. Johnson v. State, 43 S.W.3d 1, 4 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2001); King v. State, 953 S.W.2d 266, 271 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). An accused’s\n                                           7\n\fsubstantial rights are not affected by the erroneous admission of evidence if the\ncourt, after examining the record as a whole, has fair assurance that the error did not\ninfluence the jury or had but a slight effect. Johnson v. State, 967 S.W.2d 410, 417\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1998). The improper admission of evidence is harmless when the\nsame facts are proven by other properly admitted evidence or evidence that is\nadmitted without objection. Brooks v. State, 990 S.W.2d 278, 287 (Tex. Crim. App.\n1999); Anderson v. State, 717 S.W.2d 622, 628 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986).\n      Here, G.F. testified that she called Sutton in March 2011 and told Sutton that\nshe wanted to come live with her. G.F. also testified that her father and Sutton came\nto get her and brought her back to Abilene. She eventually told Sutton what was\nhappening with Appellant. As the State correctly alleges, G.F.’s testimony proved\nthe same facts that were admitted through Sutton’s testimony. Thus, the error, if\nany, was harmless. See Hudson v. State, 675 S.W.2d 507, 511 (Tex. Crim. App.\n1984) (“an error in admission of evidence is cured where the same evidence comes\nin elsewhere without objection”). Appellant’s fourth issue is overruled.\n      We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     JIM R.

The jury\nwas “not required to agree unanimously on which specific acts of sexual abuse were\ncommitted by the defendant or the exact date when those acts were committed.” Id.\n§ 21.02(d). But, the jury was required to “agree unanimously that the defendant,\nduring a period that is 30 or more days in duration, committed two or more acts of\nsexual abuse.” Id.\n      The complainant, G.F., was Appellant’s granddaughter. She testified that\nAppellant started to abuse her when she was in fifth grade. At first, Appellant\nwanted her to kiss him. This occurred on Bridge Street in Abilene. Then Appellant\ndid something else: he touched her in a “bad place.” The first “bad place” that he\ntouched her was on her breasts outside of her clothes. He also touched her on her\nbreasts underneath her clothes. G.F. testified that the next area that Appellant\ntouched was her “private.” He went underneath her pants. Later that summer, she\nmoved to the Abilene North Apartments. Appellant continued to touch her. He\ntouched her under her pants and shirt. He touched her breasts and touched her “pee-\npee.” He tried to stick his finger inside of her “pee-pee,” but she moved his finger.\nThis happened more than once. Appellant also asked her to touch his “pee-pee.”\n                                          3\n\fShe testified that she saw his “pee-pee” and touched it. He showed her how he\nwanted to be touched; he wanted her to use both hands.\n      G.F. testified that she did not start the sixth grade in Abilene. She went to\nvisit family in South Dakota. Appellant was with her, and he touched her in South\nDakota as well. The abuse lasted for the “whole summer” before she moved to South\nDakota and for the “whole time” she was in South Dakota. The abuse stopped when\nshe moved back to Abilene.\n      On cross-examination, G.F. admitted that she told Melinda Beard, the forensic\ninterviewer, that the first time it happened was in fourth grade at the house on Bridge\nStreet and that there was no touching, just kissing. She agreed that was the summer\nof 2007. She also admitted that she told Beard that nothing else happened until South\nDakota, which was the summer of her sixth grade year, and that she did not let him\nput his finger in her. On redirect, she agreed that she did not tell Beard the whole\nstory; she was not ready.\n      Beard testified that G.F. told her that the abuse started when she was in fourth\ngrade and that she thought it was the summer. G.F. was fourteen years old when\nBeard interviewed her on August 22, 2011. G.F. also told her that it happened once\nin Abilene and that all the other times were in South Dakota. Beard explained that\nG.F. told her some things, but she did not know whether G.F. was able to tell her\neverything that happened.\n      Susan Sutton, the girlfriend of G.F.’s father, testified that she met G.F. when\nG.F. was in the fourth or fifth grade. G.F. came to live with Sutton in March 2011;\nshe had been living in South Dakota.\n      In addition to the specific testimony above, the State created a timeline that\nshowed what grade G.F. was in and what age she was during the years 2007 through\n2011. The timeline shows that G.F. was born in December 1996. The timeline also\nshows that she was in fourth grade in Abilene from September 2007 to May 2008,\n                                           4\n\fthat she was in fifth grade in Abilene from September 2008 to May 2009, that she\nwas in sixth grade in South Dakota from September 2009 to May 2010, and that she\nwas in seventh grade in South Dakota from September 2010 to March 2011. She\nmoved back to Abilene from South Dakota in the middle of her seventh grade year.\n      During his interview with police, Appellant admitted that he touched G.F.’s\nbreast and that he “rubbed” her a couple of times; there was no penetration.\nAppellant also admitted that it happened in Abilene and South Dakota. It happened\nmore times in South Dakota than it did in Abilene, but it happened a few times in\nAbilene. He was not sure whether G.F. was ten, eleven, or twelve when it started;\nhe gave each of those ages throughout the interview. When police interviewed\nAppellant in September 2011, Appellant was sixty-three years old.\n      There is no question in this case that the evidence is sufficient to show that\nAppellant abused G.F. on multiple occasions over several years. Appellant argues,\nhowever, that the evidence does not show that the abuse occurred in Texas after\nSeptember 1, 2007, and for a period of thirty days or more in duration. We disagree.\nThe jury is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence. Jackson, 443\nU.S. at 319. The evidence shows that G.F. moved to South Dakota to go to sixth\ngrade and that the abuse lasted the “whole time” that she was in South Dakota as\nwell as at least the “whole summer” before she moved to South Dakota. The summer\nbefore she moved to South Dakota would have been the summer of 2009. G.F.\nwould have been twelve at that time, given that she was born in December 1996.\nAlthough G.F. did not provide specific dates as to when the abuse in Texas occurred,\nshe agreed that it occurred the “whole summer” before she moved to South Dakota.\nShe testified that some instances occurred on Bridge Street and some instances\noccurred at the Abilene North Apartments.\n      The jury could have reasonably concluded that the “whole summer” was a\nperiod of time that lasted at least thirty days. “Summer” typically means the time\n                                         5\n\fduring the year when children are out of school. One definition of “summer” is “the\nseason between spring and autumn comprising in the northern hemisphere usu[ally]\nthe months of June, July, and August or as reckoned astronomically extending from\nthe June solstice to the September equinox.” MERRIAM-WEBSTER’S COLLEGIATE\nDICTIONARY 1250 (11th ed. 2004). Here, the school years were referred to as lasting\nfrom September through May. Thus, it is a reasonable inference that the summer\nlasted from June through August. We have reviewed the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the verdict, and we hold that a rational trier of fact could have found\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant committed two acts of sexual abuse\nagainst G.F. after September 1, 2007, and that the acts occurred over a period of time\nthat was at least thirty days in duration. We overrule Appellant’s first and second\nissues.\n      Appellant contends in his third issue that the trial court erred when it excluded\nthe video recording of Beard’s forensic interview of G.F. Defense counsel offered\nthe recording to impeach G.F. by showing that G.F.’s trial testimony was\ninconsistent with her prior statements. Appellant concedes that the video is not a\npart of the appellate record; however, he alleges that it is apparent from the record\nthat the video contained some information that could have been used to impeach\nG.F.’s testimony. Even if we were to agree that the content is apparent from the\nrecord, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion when it excluded the\nvideo. When defense counsel argued that the video should come in as a prior\ninconsistent statement made by G.F., the trial court responded: “I’m not disagreeing\nwith you but you offered the whole video. You didn’t offer parts of it that would\nimpeach her so until you do that I’m not going to admit it.” Defense counsel did not\nmake an attempt to redact the video, nor did counsel re-offer any specific portion of\nthe video. “When a trial judge is presented with a proffer of evidence containing\nboth admissible and inadmissible statements and the proponent of the evidence fails\n                                          6\n\fto segregate and specifically offer the admissible statements, the trial court may\nproperly exclude all of the statements.” Willover v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1591702\"><a href=\"/opinion/1591702/willover-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 847 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2002). Therefore, the trial court did not err when it denied Appellant’s\nrequest to admit the entire video. We overrule Appellant’s third issue.\n      In his fourth issue, Appellant asserts that the trial court erred when it admitted\nhearsay testimony by Sutton. Sutton testified that G.F. called her and said that G.F.\nwanted to come live with her and G.F.’s father. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement\noffered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. TEX. R. EVID. 801(d).\nHearsay is not admissible unless provided by statute, the Rules of Evidence, or by\nother rules prescribed under statutory authority. TEX. R. EVID. 802.\n      The State contends that this testimony was not offered for the truth of the\nmatter asserted but was offered to show what Sutton did with the information and to\nshow that G.F. moved back to Abilene.

State, No. 07-08-0209-CR,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3335282</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (Tex. App.—Amarillo Oct. 16, 2009, pet. ref’d) (mem. op.,\nnot designated for publication) (holding that testimony was not hearsay when\nwitness testified about a phone call she received and what she did with the\ninformation that she learned during the call). We agree that the testimony at issue\nwas not offered for the truth of what G.F. said during the phone call, but was instead\noffered to show that G.F. called and that, as a result, Sutton and G.F.’s father moved\nher back to Abilene. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it\noverruled Appellant’s hearsay objection.\n      However, even if the trial court did err, we find that the error did not affect\nAppellant’s substantial rights. Pursuant to TEX. R. APP. P. 44.2(b), an error is not\nreversible error unless it affects a substantial right of the defendant. A substantial\nright is affected when the error has a substantial and injurious effect or influence in\ndetermining the jury’s verdict. Johnson v.

G.F. also testified that her father and Sutton came\nto get her and brought her back to Abilene. She eventually told Sutton what was\nhappening with Appellant. As the State correctly alleges, G.F.’s testimony proved\nthe same facts that were admitted through Sutton’s testimony. Thus, the error, if\nany, was harmless. See Hudson v.
