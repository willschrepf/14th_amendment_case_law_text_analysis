Fuentes assumed senior status\non July 18, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n                              2\n\f                        ______________\n\n                  OPINION OF THE COURT\n                      ______________\n\nRESTREPO, Circuit Judge.\n\n       Appellees Maureen and John Mirabella petitioned their\nlocal government for assistance in a dispute with their\nneighbors and, at the same time, threatened the local\ngovernment with litigation. A local official responded, via\nemail, by barring the Mirabellas from communicating directly\nwith any members of the local government, other than its\ncounsel. Local officials also threatened to move for sanctions\nagainst the Mirabellas for frivolous litigation if they filed suit.\n\n        The Mirabellas allege that the government officials\nviolated their First Amendment rights in two ways: (1) by\nretaliating against the Mirabellas for the exercise of their First\nAmendment rights and (2) by violating the Mirabellas’ First\nAmendment right to petition the government for redress of\ngrievances. As to these claims, the District Court denied the\nDefendants’ motions to dismiss and denied qualified\nimmunity. The government officials now appeal on qualified\nimmunity grounds. For the reasons below, we conclude that\nthe Mirabellas have adequately alleged both a retaliation\nclaim and a violation of their right to petition. The rights\nallegedly violated, however, were not clearly established for\nthe purpose of qualified immunity. Therefore, we are\nconstrained to reverse.\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\f                               I1\n\n       This case arises out of a dispute between the\nMirabellas and their neighbors regarding a public wetlands\nabutting their properties.    The wetlands is owned by\nMontgomery Township, Pennsylvania. The Mirabellas allege\nthat their neighbors extended their backyards into the public\nwetlands by attempting to fence in the open space, placing\nplayground equipment there and landscaping it.\n\n       The Mirabellas complained to the Township, which\nremoved the fence, required the neighbors to move their\nplayground equipment and—initially—required the neighbors\nto stop landscaping the open space. Nevertheless, the\nMirabellas allege, the neighbors continued to “cut and clear”\nthe open space “using driving mowers, weed whackers, push\nmowers, chainsaws and other means.” App. 39. The\nMirabellas continued to complain about this, but the\nTownship ultimately reversed course and gave the neighbors\npermission to mow the open space.\n\n       The Mirabellas viewed the Township’s response as\noverly permissive and environmentally destructive. For these\nreasons, the Mirabellas—who are both attorneys—notified\nthe Township Board of Supervisors by email that they\nintended to sue their neighbors for “encroachment and\ndestruction” of the open space. App. 119. The Mirabellas\nprotested “the Board’s failure to . . . protect our natural open\n\n       1\n          We recite the facts only as necessary for the\npurposes of this appeal, which involves a single count of a\nnine-count complaint. The only remaining defendants are\nAppellants Joseph Walsh and Jeffrey McDonnell.\n\n\n\n\n                               4\n\fspaces,” which put them “in the position of having to sue\nneighbors in order to see that our environment is preserved.”\nId. The Mirabellas further stated that as the owner of the\nopen space, “the Township will be an indispensable party in\nthis litigation.” Id. Walsh and McDonnell interpreted this as\na threat that the Mirabellas would sue the Township.\n\n        On the same day the Mirabellas ostensibly threatened\nlitigation, the Township responded. Appellant Joseph Walsh,\nChairperson of the Board of Supervisors, wrote to the\nMontgomery Township Solicitor and copied the Mirabellas.\nWalsh wrote that “[i]f the Township is sued by the Mirabellas\nmake sure our insurance counsel motions the court for\nsanctions . . . as they have no standing to file such a frivolous\naction.” App. 121. Another member of the Board of\nSupervisors, Appellant Jeffrey McDonnell, concurred later\nthat evening. He wrote: “I agree. I would also suggest our\n[attorney] put them on notice now that we will seek\nsan[c]tions so there’s no surprise.” App. 126.\n\n       John Mirabella replied within minutes defending the\npotential lawsuit as non-frivolous. He requested that the\nBoard of Supervisors provide “any legal authority to support\nthe Board’s decision and your claim that we do not have\nstanding.” App. 123.\n\n       Later that night, at 11:26 p.m., Walsh replied from his\niPhone. Walsh’s email—later an impetus for the Mirabellas’\nFirst Amendment claims—stated:\n\n       Dear Mr[.] Mirabella and his wife attorney.\n       Please direct all further communications to the\n       Township attorney. Please never contact me,\n\n\n\n\n                               5\n\f       the Board of Supervisors or the Township\n       employees directly. Do not call me at work,\n       email me at work or speak to me in public or\n       private. The dye is caste [sic].\n\nApp. 125 (emphasis added). Walsh copied this “no contact”2\nemail to numerous Township officials, including the Board of\nSupervisors, Township Manager, Planning and Zoning\nDirector and members of the police department.\n\n       Thereafter, the Mirabellas attended one meeting of the\nBoard of Supervisors, at which they allegedly protested the\ndestruction of the open space and expressed their “dismay and\nanger” over Walsh and McDonnell’s emails. App. 45.\n\n       The Mirabellas filed this lawsuit under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983, alleging, inter alia, violations of their First\nAmendment rights. The defendants filed motions to dismiss\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), in which they\nasserted a qualified immunity defense. The District Court\ndismissed all of the Mirabellas’ claims except for certain First\nAmendment claims against Walsh and McDonnell.\n\n      In its opinion, the District Court construed the\nMirabellas’ surviving First Amendment claims as alleging\n\n       2\n         The term “no contact” is used to refer to a rule of\nprofessional conduct, prohibiting contact with a represented\nperson, regarding the subject of the representation, absent\nconsent or legal authority. 2 Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. et al.,\nThe Law of Lawyering § 39.01 (4th ed. 2016). We discuss\nPennsylvania’s rule in more detail below.         See infra\nPart IV(A)(3).\n\n\n\n\n                               6\n\ftwo violations: (1) retaliation against the Mirabellas for the\nexercise of their First Amendment rights to free speech and to\npetition the government for redress of grievances and (2) a\ndirect violation of the Mirabellas’ First Amendment right to\npetition the government. As to both claims, the District Court\nfound that the Mirabellas had pled a constitutional violation.\nThe District Court denied qualified immunity via a very brief\nanalysis. Walsh and McDonnell now appeal, alleging that\nthey are entitled to qualified immunity on both claims.\n\n                                II\n\n       The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 1331. We have jurisdiction over the District\nCourt’s denial of qualified immunity under 28 U.S.C. § 1291\nand the collateral order doctrine. L.R. v. Sch. Dist. of Phila.,\n836 F.3d 235, 240 (3d Cir. 2016). The qualified immunity\nissue before us is solely a question of law and is, therefore,\nimmediately appealable as a final order. Zaloga v. Borough\nof Moosic, 841 F.3d 170, 174 n.3 (3d Cir. 2016). We exercise\nplenary review. L.R., 836 F.3d at 241. As this is an appeal\nfrom the denial of a motion to dismiss, we accept the\nallegations in the complaint as true. Mammaro v. New Jersey\nDiv. of Child Prot. & Permanency, 814 F.3d 164, 166 (3d Cir.\n2016).\n\n                               III\n\n       “Qualified immunity shields federal and state officials\nfrom money damages unless a plaintiff pleads facts showing\n(1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right,\nand (2) that the right was ‘clearly established’ at the time of\nthe challenged conduct.” Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731,\n\n\n\n\n                                7\n\f735 (2011) (citation omitted). “A Government official’s\nconduct violates clearly established law when, at the time of\nthe challenged conduct, ‘[t]he contours of [a] right [are]\nsufficiently clear’ that every ‘reasonable official would [have\nunderstood] that what he is doing violates that right.’” Id. at\n741 (alterations in original) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton,\n483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987)).\n\n       To determine if a right is clearly established, we first\nlook for Supreme Court precedent. Mammaro, 814 F.3d at\n169. If there is none, we may rely on a “‘robust consensus of\ncases of persuasive authority’ in the Court[s] of Appeals.” Id.\n(quoting Taylor v. Barkes, 135 S.Ct. 2042, 2044 (2015) (per\ncuriam)). “[A]lthough earlier cases involving fundamentally\nsimilar facts can provide especially strong support for a\nconclusion that the law is clearly established, they are not\nnecessary to such a finding.” L.R., 836 F.3d at 248 (quoting\nHope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002)).\n\n       We exercise our discretion to decide which of the two\nprongs of the qualified immunity analysis to address first “in\nlight of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.”\nPearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009). For reasons\nof constitutional avoidance, we may begin by determining\nwhether a right was clearly established. Camreta v. Greene,\n563 U.S. 692, 705 (2011). Yet in other cases “following the\ntwo-step sequence—defining constitutional rights and only\nthen conferring immunity—is sometimes beneficial to clarify\nthe legal standards governing public officials.” Id. at 707.\n\n       In the Mirabellas’ case, we exercise our discretion to\nfollow the two-step sequence. We do so in order to guide\nlocal officials in safeguarding the First Amendment rights of\n\n\n\n\n                              8\n\fconstituents in challenging circumstances: when the\ngovernment’s constituents are also litigation adversaries.\nSee Am. Canoe Ass’n, Inc. v. City of St. Albans, 18\nF. Supp. 2d 620, 621 (S.D.W.Va. 1998) (observing that the\n“[g]overnment remains the servant of the people, even when\ncitizens are litigating against it”).\n\n                              IV\n\n        The Mirabellas allege—in the first of two claims on\nappeal—that local officials Walsh and McDonnell retaliated\nagainst them for the exercise of their First Amendment rights.\nWe conclude that the Mirabellas have pled a retaliation claim\nbased upon Walsh’s “no contact” email, but not Walsh and\nMcDonnell’s threat that they would move for litigation\nsanctions. As to the second prong of qualified immunity, we\nconclude that the right was not clearly established.\n\n                               A\n\n        “Official reprisal for protected speech ‘offends the\nConstitution [because] it threatens to inhibit exercise of the\nprotected right.’” Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.S. 250, 256\n(2006) (citation omitted). To plead retaliation for the exercise\nof First Amendment rights, a plaintiff must allege “(1)\nconstitutionally protected conduct, (2) retaliatory action\nsufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness from\nexercising his constitutional rights, and (3) a causal link\nbetween the constitutionally protected conduct and the\nretaliatory action.” Thomas v. Indep. Twp., 463 F.3d 285, 296\n(3d Cir. 2006) (citation omitted); see also Mack v. Warden\nLoretto FCI, 839 F.3d 286, 297 (3d Cir. 2016) (applying this\n\n\n\n\n                               9\n\ftest to a claim of retaliation for the exercise of the right to\npetition).\n\n                               1\n\n       The first element of the Mirabellas’ retaliation claim is\nstraightforward.      The parties do not dispute that the\nMirabellas exercised their First Amendment rights—both\ntheir right to free speech and their right to petition the\ngovernment for redress of grievances. The Mirabellas\nengaged in constitutionally protected speech and petitioning\nwhen they protested the Township’s failure to protect the\nopen space and threatened litigation. “Both the Free Speech\nClause and the Petition Clause protect ‘personal\nexpression’—both expression generally and expression\ndirected towards the government for the specific purpose of\nasking it to right a wrong.” Mack, 839 F.3d at 297-98.3\n\n                               2\n\n       As to the second element of the retaliation claim, the\nparties dispute whether there was a retaliatory act “sufficient\nto deter a person of ordinary firmness.” Thomas, 463 F.3d at\n296. We conclude that Walsh’s “no contact” email met this\n\n       3\n           We will discuss the First Amendment right to\npetition the government in greater detail below, in the context\nof the Mirabellas’ second claim, which alleges a direct\nviolation of their right to petition. As explained below, the\nright to free speech and the right to petition are not\nnecessarily coextensive, although this is immaterial to our\nanalysis of the Mirabellas’ retaliation claim. See infra\nPart V(A).\n\n\n\n\n                              10\n\fstandard, but that Walsh and McDonnell’s threat that they\nwould move for litigation sanctions did not.4\n\n        As a preliminary matter, we reject Walsh and\nMcDonnell’s argument that the second element cannot be\nsatisfied because the Mirabellas were undeterred in the\nexercise of their constitutional rights and, for example,\nattended one meeting of the Board of Supervisors after Walsh\nsent the “no contact” email. This argument fails because\nwhether an act is retaliatory is an objective question. Bistrian\nv. Levi, 696 F.3d 352, 376 (3d Cir. 2012). We ask whether\nthe act would deter a person of ordinary firmness, not whether\nthe plaintiff was deterred. There is good reason for such a\nrule: we will not “‘reward’ government officials for picking\non unusually hardy speakers. At the same time, we recognize\nthat government officials should not be liable when the\nplaintiff is unreasonably weak-willed . . . .”       Bennett v.\nHendrix, 423 F.3d 1247, 1252 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation\nomitted). We now consider the two retaliatory acts alleged.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          At this level, we construe Walsh and McDonnell’s\nactions as being made “under color of state law” for the\npurposes of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. This requirement can be met\nwhere the defendant either: (1) acts in his or her official\ncapacity or (2) “purports to act according to official power.”\nBarna v. City of Perth Amboy, 42 F.3d 809, 816 (3d Cir.\n1994). Construing the allegations in the Mirabellas’ favor,\nWalsh and McDonnell either acted or purported to act,\nrespectively, as chairperson and member of the Board of\nSupervisors.\n\n\n\n\n                              11\n\f                               i\n\n       The first allegedly retaliatory act is Walsh’s “no\ncontact” email.       In this email, Walsh prohibited the\nMirabellas from contacting government employees, as\nfollows: “Please direct all further communications to the\nTownship attorney. Please never contact me, the Board of\nSupervisors or the Township employees directly. Do not call\nme at work, email me at work or speak to me in public or\nprivate. The dye is caste [sic].” App. 125. Construing all\ninferences in favor of the Mirabellas, we agree with the\nDistrict Court that this email “is significantly more than a\ndirection to contact the town attorney regarding the\n[threatened] lawsuit. This is a complete prohibition against\nPlaintiffs contacting town officials and employees for any\nreason.” App. 17. In short, Walsh barred the Mirabellas from\ncommunicating directly with their local government, for any\nreason, indefinitely. This prohibition was “sufficient to deter\na person of ordinary firmness from exercising his\nconstitutional rights.” Thomas, 463 F.3d at 296.\n\n        In concluding that Walsh’s “no contact” email was\nretaliatory, we draw upon and distinguish a similar First\nAmendment retaliation case decided by the Second Circuit.\nIn Tuccio v. Marconi, a real estate developer filed a lawsuit\nagainst a town where he sought to do business. 589 F.3d 538,\n540 (2d Cir. 2009). Because of this pending lawsuit, town\nofficials refused to meet with the developer in person, and\nadvised him to communicate with them in writing. The\ndeveloper then filed a second lawsuit, alleging that the town\nofficials’ refusal to meet with him was retaliatory. After a\ntrial on the retaliation claim, judgment was entered for the\ntown and the Second Circuit affirmed. The Second Circuit\n\n\n\n\n                              12\n\fheld that the town’s decision not to meet with the\ndeveloper—a litigation adversary—was not a retaliatory act.\nId. at 541-42. In reaching this conclusion, Tuccio emphasized\nthat the developer “had no business with the Town” other\nthan the lawsuit. Id. at 541. Tuccio further explained that\n“the result might be different” if the prohibition had “been\nimplemented in a manner that effectively denied Tuccio\naccess to permits or opportunities to do business with the\nTown,” but that the trial record demonstrated that this had not\noccurred. Id.\n\n        The result is different in the Mirabellas’ case, because\nunlike the developer in Tuccio, the Mirabellas have alleged\n“business with” their local government. Id. The Mirabellas\nlive in Montgomery Township and have alleged a myriad of\ninterests, for which they may petition the Township. Walsh’s\nemail bars the Mirabellas from communicating with\nTownship employees about any topic, not only the threatened\nlitigation, as to which limits on communication might have\nbeen “prudent.” Id. at 542. Thus, we conclude that Walsh’s\n“no contact” email was a retaliatory act.5\n\n\n       5\n         Our analysis of the Mirabellas’ retaliation claim does\nnot turn on whether Walsh’s “no contact” email was itself\nunconstitutional. In a retaliation claim, we ask instead\n“whether the Government is punishing the plaintiffs for\nexercising their rights.” Miller v. Mitchell, 598 F.3d 139, 148\nn.9 (3d Cir. 2010) (emphasis in original) (quoting Anderson v.\nDavila, 125 F.3d 148, 161 (3d Cir. 1997)). We will return to\nthe constitutionality of Walsh’s “no contact” email in the\ncontext of the Mirabella’s direct Petition Clause claim.\nSee infra Part V(B).\n\n\n\n\n                              13\n\f                              ii\n\n        The Mirabellas also allege that both Walsh and\nMcDonnell retaliated against them by stating that if the\nMirabellas sued the Township, the Township would move for\nsanctions for frivolous litigation. Significantly, this alleged\nact of retaliation is a particular kind—one taking the form of\nthe official’s own speech. McLaughlin v. Watson, 271 F.3d\n566, 573 (3d Cir. 2001) (quoting Suarez Corp. Indus. v.\nMcGraw, 202 F.3d 676, 687 (4th Cir. 2000)); see also\nZaloga, 841 F.3d at 176. In such circumstances we employ a\nmore specific test to determine whether the official’s speech\namounts to a retaliatory act. We ask whether there was “a\nthreat, coercion, or intimidation, intimating that punishment,\nsanction, or adverse regulatory action will follow.”\nMcLaughlin, 271 F.3d at 573 (quoting Suarez Corp. Indus.,\n202 F.3d at 687).\n\n        This standard is not met by Walsh and McDonnell’s\nstatements that if the Mirabellas sued the Township, they\nwould move a court for sanctions. In such statements, the\n“quantum of governmental authority brought to bear” was\nminimal. R.C. Maxwell Co. v. Borough of New Hope,\n735 F.2d 85, 88 (3d Cir. 1984); see also Novoselsky v. Brown,\n822 F.3d 342 (7th Cir. 2016) (holding that there was no\nretaliatory act where government official filed an attorney\ndisciplinary complaint against the plaintiff and publicly\naccused him of litigiousness). As such, the Mirabellas’\nretaliation claim must succeed, if at all, on Walsh’s “no\ncontact” email, not the threat of motioning for litigation\nsanctions.\n\n\n\n\n                              14\n\f                              3\n\n         The third element of a retaliation claim requires a\ncausal link between a plaintiff’s constitutionally protected\nactivity and the retaliatory act. Thomas, 463 F.3d at 296.\nThe required link is “but-for” causation. Hartman, 547 U.S.\nat 256. “[A]ny . . . plaintiff charging official retaliatory\naction . . . must prove the elements of retaliatory animus as\nthe cause of injury, and the defendant will have the\n. . . opportunity to respond to a prima facie case by showing\nthat the action would have been taken anyway, independently\nof any retaliatory animus.” Id. at 260-61. One method of\nproving a causal link, applicable here, is “unusually\nsuggestive temporal proximity.” Lauren W. v. Deflaminis,\n480 F.3d 259, 267 (3d Cir. 2007). The Mirabellas have\nalleged such a causal link. On the very same day that the\nMirabellas emailed the Township to protest its treatment of\nthe open space, and to threaten litigation, Walsh responded\nwith the “no contact” email.6\n\n       Although this “would normally be enough to carry a\ncomplaint across the starting line in the face of a Rule\n12(b)(6) motion,” we must address one counter-argument.\nMaloy v. Ballori-Lage, 744 F.3d 250, 253 (1st Cir. 2014).\n\n       6\n            This allegation of temporal proximity is itself\nsufficient. In addition, we infer that Walsh’s “no contact”\nemail was a direct response to the threat of litigation because\nof Walsh’s concluding message, “[t]he dye is caste [sic].”\nApp. 125. Construing this statement in favor of the\nMirabellas, we infer that Walsh meant that the Mirabellas cast\nthe die by threatening litigation against the Township.\n\n\n\n\n                              15\n\fWalsh argues that there is “another explanation that is so\nobviously correct as to render the charge of improper\nmotivation implausible.” Id. (citation omitted); see also\nGeorge v. Rehiel, 738 F.3d 562, 586 (3d Cir. 2013) (holding\nthat there was an alternative explanation (airline security) that\nwas “obvious” on the fact of the complaint). Specifically,\nWalsh contends that his email was merely a demand that the\nMirabellas—both attorneys—follow the “no contact” rule of\nthe Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct. This\nargument fails because Walsh’s prohibition swept far more\nbroadly than the rule.\n\n       Rule 4.2 of the Rules of Professional Conduct provides\nthat a lawyer, representing a client, “shall not communicate\nabout the subject of the representation with a person the\nlawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the\nmatter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer\nor is authorized to do so by law or a court order.”\nPa.R.P.C. 4.2. This prohibition is narrower than Walsh’s “no\ncontact” email, for at least three reasons: Rule 4.2 (1) is\nlimited to the subject of the representation; (2) is limited to a\nperson represented by counsel in the matter and (3) contains\nan “authorized by law” exception, which safeguards\nconstitutionally-protected expression.         Id.; see also\nPa.R.P.C. 4.2, cmt. ¶¶ 4, 5, 7. Walsh’s “no contact” email\ncontained none of these three limitations.7\n\n\n       7\n         We pass no judgment as to whether Rule 4.2 of the\nPennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct applies where, as\nhere, lawyers represent themselves pro se. See Hazard et al.,\nsupra note 2, § 41.03; Restatement (Third) of the Law\nGoverning Lawyers § 99, cmt. ¶ e (Am. Law Inst. 2016).\n\n\n\n\n                               16\n\f       Thus, we reject Walsh’s attempt to justify his email by\nreference to Rule 4.2. The Mirabellas have pled causation,\nthe final element of their First Amendment retaliation claim.\n\n                               B\n\n       Having held that the Mirabellas adequately alleged a\nFirst Amendment retaliation claim based upon Walsh’s “no\ncontact” email, our inquiry is not complete. We must\nnevertheless determine whether the right was clearly\nestablished under the second prong of qualified immunity.\n\n        In this analysis we are mindful that we must not\n“define clearly established law at a high level of generality.”\nal-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 742. More specifically, the Supreme\nCourt has given us guidance on defining a right in the First\nAmendment retaliation context. In Reichle v. Howards, the\nSupreme Court clarified that it is too broad to define the right\nas the “right to be free from retaliation for one’s speech.”\n132 S.Ct. 2088, 2094 (2012). Conversely, Reichle held that is\nproper to define a right as the “right to be free from a\nretaliatory arrest that is otherwise supported by probable\ncause.” Id.\n\n        Reichle is directly applicable to the Mirabellas’\nretaliation claim. As in Reichle, the disputed issue here is\nwhether it was clearly established that the defendant’s act was\nretaliatory.8 Paralleling Reichle, we define the right at issue\n\n\n       8\n           In other First Amendment retaliation cases, the\ndisputed issue may be whether it was clearly established that\nthe plaintiff’s conduct was constitutionally protected. See,\n\n\n\n\n                              17\n\fas the right to be free from a retaliatory restriction on\ncommunication with one’s government, when the plaintiff has\nthreatened or engaged in litigation against the government.\n\n        This right was not clearly established when Walsh sent\nthe “no contact” email. The Mirabellas have identified\nneither Supreme Court precedent nor a “robust consensus of\ncases of persuasive authority.” Mammaro, 814 F.3d at 169\n(citation omitted). The closest case we have identified,\nTuccio, held that the refusal of town officials to meet with a\nlitigation adversary did not amount to First Amendment\nretaliation. Tuccio, 589 F.3d at 541-42. Thus, Walsh is\nentitled to qualified immunity on the Mirabellas’ First\nAmendment retaliation claim.\n\n                               V\n\n       The Mirabellas also assert a direct violation of their\nFirst Amendment right to petition the government for redress\nof grievances, again based upon Walsh’s “no contact” email.\nWe conclude that the Mirabellas have pled a constitutional\nviolation, but that the right was not clearly established for\nqualified immunity purposes.\n\n                               A\n\n         The First Amendment of the United States\nConstitution provides that “Congress shall make no law . . .\nabridging the freedom of speech, . . . or the right of the people\n. . . to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”\n\n\ne.g., Dougherty v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., 772 F.3d 979, 993-94\n(3d Cir. 2014).\n\n\n\n\n                               18\n\fU.S. Const. amend. I. These two guarantees are known,\nrespectively, as the Speech Clause and the Petition Clause.\n\n       The right to petition the government is “one of ‘the\nmost precious of the liberties safeguarded by the Bill of\nRights.’” BE & K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 536 U.S. 516, 524\n(2002) (quoting United Mine Workers of Am., Dist. 12 v. Ill.\nState Bar Ass’n, 389 U.S. 217, 222 (1967)). “The very idea\nof a government, republican in form, implies a right on the\npart of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in\nrespect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of\ngrievances.” United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 552\n(1875). Petitioning serves numerous, fundamental interests of\npetitioners and the government alike. It is “essential to\nfreedom,” liberty and self-government. Borough of Duryea v.\nGuarnieri, 564 U.S. 379, 382, 394 (2011); see also\nMcDonald v. Smith, 472 U.S. 479, 483 (1985). Petitions\ncontribute to the “public airing” of disputes, the “evolution of\nthe law,” and the use of government as an “alternative to\nforce.” BE & K Constr., 536 U.S. at 532.\n\n       In Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri, the Supreme Court\nrecently renewed its Petition Clause jurisprudence, with a\nfocus on the historical underpinnings of the right. 564 U.S. at\n387-97; see also Ronald J. Krotoszynski, Jr., Reclaiming the\nPetition Clause 104-28 (2012) (chronicling the history of\npetitioning in the United States, including its importance in\nthe abolitionist movement). The Supreme Court described\nthe “special concerns” of the Petition Clause, as compared to\nthe Speech Clause, as follows: “The right to petition allows\ncitizens to express their ideas, hopes, and concerns to their\ngovernment and their elected representatives, whereas the\nright to speak fosters the public exchange of ideas that is\n\n\n\n\n                              19\n\fintegral to deliberative democracy as well as to the whole\nrealm of ideas and human affairs.” Id. at 388 (emphasis\nadded).\n\n        A petition may “undoubtedly” consist of a “personal\ngrievance addressed to the government.” Id. at 394. But\n“[p]etitions to the government assume an added dimension\nwhen they seek to advance political, social, or other ideas of\ninterest to the community as a whole.” Id. at 395. A petition\nneed not “take[] a specific form,” and may include an oral\ngrievance. Mack, 839 F.3d at 299 (citation omitted).\n\n        A petition enjoys constitutional protection whether it is\naddressed, as here, to a local government, or to a state or\nnational government.       See, e.g., NAACP v. Claiborne\nHardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 889 (1982) (petition and\nboycott directed at county officials); Brown v. Louisiana,\n383 U.S. 131, 142 (1966) (protest of segregated public\nlibrary); Holzemer v. City of Memphis, 621 F.3d 512, 519 (6th\nCir. 2010) (oral request to city councilperson); Van Deelen v.\nJohnson, 497 F.3d 1151, 1158 (10th Cir. 2007) (appeal of\ncounty property tax assessment). A petition may be directed\ntowards any department of government, including the courts.\nGuarnieri, 564 U.S. at 387; BE & K Constr., 536 U.S. at 525;\nsee also Anderson v. Davila, 125 F.3d at 162-63 (holding that\nthe right to petition includes actions taken in anticipation of\nlitigation).\n\n       At the same time, the right to petition is not\n“[u]nrestrained,” Guarnieri, 564 U.S. at 390, or “absolute,”\nMcDonald, 472 U.S. at 484. For example, the Supreme Court\nhas held that “petitions to the President that contain\nintentional and reckless falsehoods ‘do not enjoy\n\n\n\n\n                               20\n\fconstitutional protection.’” McDonald, 472 U.S. at 484\n(citation omitted). Accordingly, we may ask whether the\ngovernment may “nevertheless burden” the right to petition,\ngiven countervailing government interests. BE & K Constr.,\n536 U.S. at 535.\n\n        To balance such competing interests, courts have\ngenerally applied Speech Clause precedent, rather than any\nfreestanding Petition Clause doctrine.9 Guarnieri, 564 U.S. at\n389 (acknowledging this trend); see also Galena v. Leone,\n638 F.3d 186, 197 n.7 (3d Cir. 2011) (considering speech and\npetition claims as one); Eichenlaub v. Twp. of Indiana,\n385 F.3d 274, 281 (3d Cir. 2004) (same). But Guarnieri\nclarified that we cannot do so automatically. For while the\nright to petition and the right to free speech “share substantial\ncommon ground,” they are not “identical in their mandate or\ntheir purpose and effect.” Guarnieri, 564 U.S. at 388.\nAccordingly, the Supreme Court cautioned that “Speech\nClause precedents [do not] necessarily and in every case\nresolve Petition Clause claims.” Id. Despite this guidance,\nhowever, Guarnieri did apply Speech Clause precedent,\nrather than forge new ground under the Petition Clause. Id. at\n382-83.\n\n\n\n\n       9\n          That said, the Petition Clause has been interpreted\nindependently from the Speech Clause in the antitrust context.\nUnited Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657\n(1965); E. R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor\nFreight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127 (1961).\n\n\n\n\n                               21\n\f                               B\n\n       With this background in mind, we turn to the\nMirabellas’ claim that Walsh violated their right to petition by\nprohibiting them from contacting any Township employees,\nother than its counsel. To answer this question, we will apply\nfree speech precedent, as the Supreme Court did in Guarnieri.\nId. We conclude that this is appropriate given the “extensive\ncommon ground” of the two rights, and the Supreme Court’s\nown example. Id. at 389. As such, our analysis would be\nidentical if the Mirabellas had framed their argument as a free\nspeech claim, rather than a violation of their right to petition\nthe government.\n\n                               1\n\n        Drawing upon free speech precedent, the Mirabellas\nencourage us to apply a test that is highly deferential to their\nFirst Amendment rights, on at least two theories. First, the\nMirabellas assert that Walsh’s email is a content-based\nrestriction on their speech.       Cf. Nat’l Assoc. for the\nAdvancement of Multijurisdiction Practice (NAAMJP) v.\nCastille, 799 F.3d 216, 222-23 (3d Cir. 2015) (explaining that\nspeaker-based restrictions on speech are subject to heightened\nscrutiny when they reflect content-based preferences).\nSecond, the Mirabellas assert that Walsh’s email is a\nrestriction on their political speech. See Citizens United v.\nFEC, 558 U.S. 310, 340 (2010).\n\n      We decline to determine whether these theories apply.\nRather, we will assume for the sake of argument that Walsh’s\n“no contact” email is a content-neutral, “time, place or\nmanner” restriction on the Mirabellas’ speech.         It is\n\n\n\n\n                              22\n\funnecessary to apply greater scrutiny to the restriction\nbecause, as explained below, even under a standard more\ndeferential to Walsh, the “no contact” email is\nunconstitutional. Cf. McCullen v. Coakley, 134 S.Ct. 2518,\n2530 (2014) (recognizing cases that make such an\nassumption, but declining to adopt the same approach).\n\n        Given a content-neutral, “time, place or manner”\nrestriction on speech, our inquiry is whether the prohibition is\nnarrowly tailored. Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S.\n622, 662 (1994); Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781,\n791 (1989). We ask whether the restriction “‘burden[s]\nsubstantially more speech than is necessary to further the\ngovernment’s legitimate interests.’” McCullen, 134 S.Ct. at\n2535 (quoting Ward, 491 U.S. at 799). The restriction need\nnot be the least restrictive means of furthering the\ngovernment’s interests. Id. (quoting Ward, 491 U.S. at 798).\nHowever, the government may not restrict speech “in such a\nmanner that a substantial portion of the burden on speech\ndoes not serve to advance its goals.” Id. (quoting Ward,\n491 U.S. at 799). The restriction on speech must also “leave\nopen ample alternative channels for communication of the\ninformation.” Ward, 491 U.S. at 791. The government bears\nthe burden to demonstrate that the restriction is\nconstitutionally permissible. Startzell v. City of Phila.,\n533 F.3d 183, 201 (3d Cir. 2008).10\n\n       10\n          Although Walsh does not make the argument, we\npause to explain that we are not applying another doctrine\nthat would be even more deferential to the government. This\ndoctrine holds, in some contexts, that the government has\n“additional authority to regulate” attorney speech.\nIn re Kendall, 712 F.3d 814, 825 (3d Cir. 2013). This\n\n\n\n\n                              23\n\f                               2\n\n       Applying the time, place or manner test, we begin with\nthe alleged governmental interest. Walsh alleges an interest\nin preventing the Mirabellas, litigation adversaries, from\n\n\nadditional authority is a product of the government’s\nregulatory authority over bar admissions and attorney\ndiscipline. See Gentile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U.S. 1030,\n1066 (1991).\n\n        Doctrinally, the regulation of certain attorney speech is\none example of the government’s additional authority to\nrestrict speech when it “acts in capacities that go beyond\nbeing sovereign.” B.H. v. Easton Area Sch. Dist., 725 F.3d\n293, 303 (3d Cir. 2013) (en banc) (citing In re Kendall, 712\nF.3d at 825). That is, the law distinguishes between the\ngovernment’s authority to restrict speech (1) as a “sovereign”\nor (2) as a “property owner, educator, employer, or patron.”\nKathleen M. Sullivan, The Intersection of Free Speech and\nthe Legal Profession: Constraints on Lawyers’ First\nAmendment Rights, 67 Fordham L. Rev. 569, 584-85 (1998).\nWhen the government acts as a sovereign, “robust free speech\nprotection” applies. Id. at 587. But when the government\nacts in certain other capacities, it may be “freer to place\nconditions” on speech. Id.\n\n       Walsh, we conclude, acted as a local “sovereign,” not\nby virtue of any regulatory authority over attorneys. “When\nacting as sovereign, the government is empowered to impose\ntime, place, and manner restrictions on speech . . . .” B.H.,\n725 F.3d at 302 (citing Ward, 492 U.S. at 791). It is this\nstandard that we apply.\n\n\n\n\n                               24\n\fcommunicating with Township employees per Rule 4.2 of the\nPennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct. That Rule, the\ncommentary explains, “contributes to the proper functioning\nof the legal system,” for three reasons: (1) it protects\nrepresented persons from “possible overreaching by other\nlawyers” in the matter; (2) it protects the lawyer-client\nrelationship from interference and (3) it prevents\n“uncounseled disclosure[s].” Pa.R.P.C. 4.2, cmt. ¶ 1; see also\nRestatement (Third) of Law Governing Lawyers, supra note\n7, § 99(A), cmt. ¶ b (same). These governmental interests are\nlegitimate. But see Restatement (Third) of Law Governing\nLawyers, supra note 7, § 101(A), cmt. ¶ b (suggesting that the\nneed for a “no contact” rule is reduced where the represented\nperson is a government entity).\n\n       As to the Mirabellas’ interests, they are substantial.\nConstruing all inferences in their favor, the Mirabellas were\nprohibited from contacting Township officials and employees\ndirectly, for any reason, indefinitely. This ban encompasses,\ninter alia, “normal conversation” and “one-on-one\ncommunication” with government officials—forms of\nexpression “historically . . . closely associated with the\ntransmission of ideas.” McCullen, 134 S.Ct. at 2536.11\n\n\n\n\n      11\n           Walsh’s “no contact” email also substantially\nimpairs the Mirabellas’ interests in petitioning the\ngovernment.     Walsh prohibited the Mirabellas from\n“express[ing] their ideas, hopes, and concerns to their\ngovernment and their elected representatives,” as the Petition\nClause guarantees. Guarnieri, 564 U.S. at 388 (emphasis\nadded).\n\n\n\n\n                             25\n\f        Comparing the parties’ interests, the Mirabellas have\nalleged a burden on their speech substantially greater than\nnecessary to protect the Township’s litigation interests. “[I]t\nis no answer . . . to say . . . that the purpose of these\nregulations was merely to insure high professional standards\nand not to curtail free expression.” Reed v. Town of Gilbert,\n135 S.Ct. 2218, 2229 (2015) (alteration in original) (quoting\nNAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 438-39 (1963)).12 Thus, the\nMirabellas have alleged a constitutional violation of their\nright to petition.\n\n                              C\n\n       For the reasons above, the Mirabellas have alleged a\nviolation of their First Amendment right to petition the\ngovernment for redress of grievances. Under the second\nprong of qualified immunity, however, we conclude that the\nright was not clearly established.\n\n       As stated above, we must not “define clearly\nestablished law at a high level of generality.” al-Kidd, 563\nU.S. at 742. We therefore define the First Amendment right\nat issue as the right to be free from a restriction on\ncommunicating with one’s government, when the plaintiff has\n\n\n      12\n           Because we hold that Walsh’s “no contact” email\nwas not narrowly tailored, we need not reach the additional\nrequirement that a time, place or manner restriction on speech\nleave open ample alternative channels for communication.\nWard, 491 U.S. at 791; see, e.g., Johnson v. City & Cty. of\nPhila., 665 F.3d 486, 493 (3d Cir. 2011) (conducting this\nanalysis).\n\n\n\n\n                              26\n\fthreatened or engaged in litigation against the government.\nThis right was not clearly established.\n\n        While other cases have held that there is a clearly\nestablished right to petition a local government, those cases\ndid not involve litigation. For example, the Sixth Circuit has\nheld that there is a clearly established right “to petition a\nlocal, elected representative for assistance in dealing with\nlocal government agencies.” Holzemer, 621 F.3d at 527.\nSimilarly, the Tenth Circuit has held that there is a clearly\nestablished right to petition a local government regarding a\ntax assessment. Van Deelen, 497 F.3d at 1159. These cases,\nwhile persuasive, do not establish that “every ‘reasonable\nofficial’” in Walsh’s position would have understood that his\n“no contact” email violated the Mirabellas’ First Amendment\nrights. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 741 (citation omitted). Thus,\nWalsh is entitled to qualified immunity on the Mirabellas’\nPetition Clause claim.\n\n                             VI\n\n       For the reasons above, we will reverse the judgment of\nthe District Court denying, in part, Appellant Walsh and\nMcDonnell’s motion to dismiss and we will remand with\ninstructions to enter judgment in their favor.\n\n\n\n\n                             27\n\f",

Fuentes assumed senior status\non July 18, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n                              2\n\f                        ______________\n\n                  OPINION OF THE COURT\n                      ______________\n\nRESTREPO, Circuit Judge.\n\n       Appellees Maureen and John Mirabella petitioned their\nlocal government for assistance in a dispute with their\nneighbors and, at the same time, threatened the local\ngovernment with litigation. A local official responded, via\nemail, by barring the Mirabellas from communicating directly\nwith any members of the local government, other than its\ncounsel. Local officials also threatened to move for sanctions\nagainst the Mirabellas for frivolous litigation if they filed suit.\n\n        The Mirabellas allege that the government officials\nviolated their First Amendment rights in two ways: (1) by\nretaliating against the Mirabellas for the exercise of their First\nAmendment rights and (2) by violating the Mirabellas’ First\nAmendment right to petition the government for redress of\ngrievances. As to these claims, the District Court denied the\nDefendants’ motions to dismiss and denied qualified\nimmunity. The government officials now appeal on qualified\nimmunity grounds. For the reasons below, we conclude that\nthe Mirabellas have adequately alleged both a retaliation\nclaim and a violation of their right to petition. The rights\nallegedly violated, however, were not clearly established for\nthe purpose of qualified immunity. Therefore, we are\nconstrained to reverse.\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\f                               I1\n\n       This case arises out of a dispute between the\nMirabellas and their neighbors regarding a public wetlands\nabutting their properties.    The wetlands is owned by\nMontgomery Township, Pennsylvania. The Mirabellas allege\nthat their neighbors extended their backyards into the public\nwetlands by attempting to fence in the open space, placing\nplayground equipment there and landscaping it.\n\n       The Mirabellas complained to the Township, which\nremoved the fence, required the neighbors to move their\nplayground equipment and—initially—required the neighbors\nto stop landscaping the open space. Nevertheless, the\nMirabellas allege, the neighbors continued to “cut and clear”\nthe open space “using driving mowers, weed whackers, push\nmowers, chainsaws and other means.” App. 39. The\nMirabellas continued to complain about this, but the\nTownship ultimately reversed course and gave the neighbors\npermission to mow the open space.\n\n       The Mirabellas viewed the Township’s response as\noverly permissive and environmentally destructive. For these\nreasons, the Mirabellas—who are both attorneys—notified\nthe Township Board of Supervisors by email that they\nintended to sue their neighbors for “encroachment and\ndestruction” of the open space. App. 119. The Mirabellas\nprotested “the Board’s failure to . . . protect our natural open\n\n       1\n          We recite the facts only as necessary for the\npurposes of this appeal, which involves a single count of a\nnine-count complaint. The only remaining defendants are\nAppellants Joseph Walsh and Jeffrey McDonnell.\n\n\n\n\n                               4\n\fspaces,” which put them “in the position of having to sue\nneighbors in order to see that our environment is preserved.”\nId. The Mirabellas further stated that as the owner of the\nopen space, “the Township will be an indispensable party in\nthis litigation.” Id. Walsh and McDonnell interpreted this as\na threat that the Mirabellas would sue the Township.\n\n        On the same day the Mirabellas ostensibly threatened\nlitigation, the Township responded. Appellant Joseph Walsh,\nChairperson of the Board of Supervisors, wrote to the\nMontgomery Township Solicitor and copied the Mirabellas.\nWalsh wrote that “[i]f the Township is sued by the Mirabellas\nmake sure our insurance counsel motions the court for\nsanctions . . . as they have no standing to file such a frivolous\naction.” App. 121. Another member of the Board of\nSupervisors, Appellant Jeffrey McDonnell, concurred later\nthat evening. He wrote: “I agree. I would also suggest our\n[attorney] put them on notice now that we will seek\nsan[c]tions so there’s no surprise.” App. 126.\n\n       John Mirabella replied within minutes defending the\npotential lawsuit as non-frivolous. He requested that the\nBoard of Supervisors provide “any legal authority to support\nthe Board’s decision and your claim that we do not have\nstanding.” App. 123.\n\n       Later that night, at 11:26 p.m., Walsh replied from his\niPhone. Walsh’s email—later an impetus for the Mirabellas’\nFirst Amendment claims—stated:\n\n       Dear Mr[.] Mirabella and his wife attorney.\n       Please direct all further communications to the\n       Township attorney. Please never contact me,\n\n\n\n\n                               5\n\f       the Board of Supervisors or the Township\n       employees directly. Do not call me at work,\n       email me at work or speak to me in public or\n       private. The dye is caste [sic].\n\nApp. 125 (emphasis added). Walsh copied this “no contact”2\nemail to numerous Township officials, including the Board of\nSupervisors, Township Manager, Planning and Zoning\nDirector and members of the police department.\n\n       Thereafter, the Mirabellas attended one meeting of the\nBoard of Supervisors, at which they allegedly protested the\ndestruction of the open space and expressed their “dismay and\nanger” over Walsh and McDonnell’s emails. App. 45.\n\n       The Mirabellas filed this lawsuit under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983, alleging, inter alia, violations of their First\nAmendment rights. The defendants filed motions to dismiss\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), in which they\nasserted a qualified immunity defense. The District Court\ndismissed all of the Mirabellas’ claims except for certain First\nAmendment claims against Walsh and McDonnell.\n\n      In its opinion, the District Court construed the\nMirabellas’ surviving First Amendment claims as alleging\n\n       2\n         The term “no contact” is used to refer to a rule of\nprofessional conduct, prohibiting contact with a represented\nperson, regarding the subject of the representation, absent\nconsent or legal authority. 2 Geoffrey C.

See infra\nPart IV(A)(3).\n\n\n\n\n                               6\n\ftwo violations: (1) retaliation against the Mirabellas for the\nexercise of their First Amendment rights to free speech and to\npetition the government for redress of grievances and (2) a\ndirect violation of the Mirabellas’ First Amendment right to\npetition the government. As to both claims, the District Court\nfound that the Mirabellas had pled a constitutional violation.\nThe District Court denied qualified immunity via a very brief\nanalysis. Walsh and McDonnell now appeal, alleging that\nthey are entitled to qualified immunity on both claims.\n\n                                II\n\n       The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 1331.

The parties do not dispute that the\nMirabellas exercised their First Amendment rights—both\ntheir right to free speech and their right to petition the\ngovernment for redress of grievances. The Mirabellas\nengaged in constitutionally protected speech and petitioning\nwhen they protested the Township’s failure to protect the\nopen space and threatened litigation. “Both the Free Speech\nClause and the Petition Clause protect ‘personal\nexpression’—both expression generally and expression\ndirected towards the government for the specific purpose of\nasking it to right a wrong.” Mack, 839 F.3d at 297-98.3\n\n                               2\n\n       As to the second element of the retaliation claim, the\nparties dispute whether there was a retaliatory act “sufficient\nto deter a person of ordinary firmness.” Thomas, 463 F.3d at\n296. We conclude that Walsh’s “no contact” email met this\n\n       3\n           We will discuss the First Amendment right to\npetition the government in greater detail below, in the context\nof the Mirabellas’ second claim, which alleges a direct\nviolation of their right to petition. As explained below, the\nright to free speech and the right to petition are not\nnecessarily coextensive, although this is immaterial to our\nanalysis of the Mirabellas’ retaliation claim. See infra\nPart V(A).\n\n\n\n\n                              10\n\fstandard, but that Walsh and McDonnell’s threat that they\nwould move for litigation sanctions did not.4\n\n        As a preliminary matter, we reject Walsh and\nMcDonnell’s argument that the second element cannot be\nsatisfied because the Mirabellas were undeterred in the\nexercise of their constitutional rights and, for example,\nattended one meeting of the Board of Supervisors after Walsh\nsent the “no contact” email. This argument fails because\nwhether an act is retaliatory is an objective question. Bistrian\nv.

We ask whether\nthe act would deter a person of ordinary firmness, not whether\nthe plaintiff was deterred. There is good reason for such a\nrule: we will not “‘reward’ government officials for picking\non unusually hardy speakers. At the same time, we recognize\nthat government officials should not be liable when the\nplaintiff is unreasonably weak-willed . . . .”       Bennett v.\nHendrix, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77110\"><a href=\"/opinion/77110/danny-m-bennett-v-dennis-lee-hendrix/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1252 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation\nomitted). We now consider the two retaliatory acts alleged.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          At this level, we construe Walsh and McDonnell’s\nactions as being made “under color of state law” for the\npurposes of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. This requirement can be met\nwhere the defendant either: (1) acts in his or her official\ncapacity or (2) “purports to act according to official power.”\nBarna v.

Construing the allegations in the Mirabellas’ favor,\nWalsh and McDonnell either acted or purported to act,\nrespectively, as chairperson and member of the Board of\nSupervisors.\n\n\n\n\n                              11\n\f                               i\n\n       The first allegedly retaliatory act is Walsh’s “no\ncontact” email.       In this email, Walsh prohibited the\nMirabellas from contacting government employees, as\nfollows: “Please direct all further communications to the\nTownship attorney. Please never contact me, the Board of\nSupervisors or the Township employees directly. Do not call\nme at work, email me at work or speak to me in public or\nprivate. The dye is caste [sic].” App. 125. Construing all\ninferences in favor of the Mirabellas, we agree with the\nDistrict Court that this email “is significantly more than a\ndirection to contact the town attorney regarding the\n[threatened] lawsuit. This is a complete prohibition against\nPlaintiffs contacting town officials and employees for any\nreason.” App. 17. In short, Walsh barred the Mirabellas from\ncommunicating directly with their local government, for any\nreason, indefinitely. This prohibition was “sufficient to deter\na person of ordinary firmness from exercising his\nconstitutional rights.” Thomas, 463 F.3d at 296.\n\n        In concluding that Walsh’s “no contact” email was\nretaliatory, we draw upon and distinguish a similar First\nAmendment retaliation case decided by the Second Circuit.\nIn Tuccio v. Marconi, a real estate developer filed a lawsuit\nagainst a town where he sought to do business. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n540 (2d Cir. 2009). Because of this pending lawsuit, town\nofficials refused to meet with the developer in person, and\nadvised him to communicate with them in writing. The\ndeveloper then filed a second lawsuit, alleging that the town\nofficials’ refusal to meet with him was retaliatory. After a\ntrial on the retaliation claim, judgment was entered for the\ntown and the Second Circuit affirmed. The Second Circuit\n\n\n\n\n                              12\n\fheld that the town’s decision not to meet with the\ndeveloper—a litigation adversary—was not a retaliatory act.\nId. at 541-42. In reaching this conclusion, Tuccio emphasized\nthat the developer “had no business with the Town” other\nthan the lawsuit. Id. at 541. Tuccio further explained that\n“the result might be different” if the prohibition had “been\nimplemented in a manner that effectively denied Tuccio\naccess to permits or opportunities to do business with the\nTown,” but that the trial record demonstrated that this had not\noccurred. Id.\n\n        The result is different in the Mirabellas’ case, because\nunlike the developer in Tuccio, the Mirabellas have alleged\n“business with” their local government. Id. The Mirabellas\nlive in Montgomery Township and have alleged a myriad of\ninterests, for which they may petition the Township. Walsh’s\nemail bars the Mirabellas from communicating with\nTownship employees about any topic, not only the threatened\nlitigation, as to which limits on communication might have\nbeen “prudent.” Id. at 542. Thus, we conclude that Walsh’s\n“no contact” email was a retaliatory act.5\n\n\n       5\n         Our analysis of the Mirabellas’ retaliation claim does\nnot turn on whether Walsh’s “no contact” email was itself\nunconstitutional. In a retaliation claim, we ask instead\n“whether the Government is punishing the plaintiffs for\nexercising their rights.” Miller v.

As such, the Mirabellas’\nretaliation claim must succeed, if at all, on Walsh’s “no\ncontact” email, not the threat of motioning for litigation\nsanctions.\n\n\n\n\n                              14\n\f                              3\n\n         The third element of a retaliation claim requires a\ncausal link between a plaintiff’s constitutionally protected\nactivity and the retaliatory act. Thomas, 463 F.3d at 296.\nThe required link is “but-for” causation. Hartman, 547 U.S.\nat 256. “[A]ny . . . plaintiff charging official retaliatory\naction . . . must prove the elements of retaliatory animus as\nthe cause of injury, and the defendant will have the\n. . . opportunity to respond to a prima facie case by showing\nthat the action would have been taken anyway, independently\nof any retaliatory animus.” Id. at 260-61. One method of\nproving a causal link, applicable here, is “unusually\nsuggestive temporal proximity.” Lauren W. v. Deflaminis,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797154\"><a href=\"/opinion/797154/lauren-w-by-and-through-her-parents-jean-and-james-w-jean-w-james-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 267 (3d Cir. 2007). The Mirabellas have\nalleged such a causal link. On the very same day that the\nMirabellas emailed the Township to protest its treatment of\nthe open space, and to threaten litigation, Walsh responded\nwith the “no contact” email.6\n\n       Although this “would normally be enough to carry a\ncomplaint across the starting line in the face of a Rule\n12(b)(6) motion,” we must address one counter-argument.\nMaloy v. Ballori-Lage, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">744</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 253 (1st Cir. 2014).\n\n       6\n            This allegation of temporal proximity is itself\nsufficient. In addition, we infer that Walsh’s “no contact”\nemail was a direct response to the threat of litigation because\nof Walsh’s concluding message, “[t]he dye is caste [sic].”\nApp. 125. Construing this statement in favor of the\nMirabellas, we infer that Walsh meant that the Mirabellas cast\nthe die by threatening litigation against the Township.\n\n\n\n\n                              15\n\fWalsh argues that there is “another explanation that is so\nobviously correct as to render the charge of improper\nmotivation implausible.” Id. (citation omitted); see also\nGeorge v. Rehiel, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">738</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 586 (3d Cir. 2013) (holding\nthat there was an alternative explanation (airline security) that\nwas “obvious” on the fact of the complaint). Specifically,\nWalsh contends that his email was merely a demand that the\nMirabellas—both attorneys—follow the “no contact” rule of\nthe Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct. This\nargument fails because Walsh’s prohibition swept far more\nbroadly than the rule.\n\n       Rule 4.2 of the Rules of Professional Conduct provides\nthat a lawyer, representing a client, “shall not communicate\nabout the subject of the representation with a person the\nlawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the\nmatter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer\nor is authorized to do so by law or a court order.”\nPa.R.P.C. 4.2. This prohibition is narrower than Walsh’s “no\ncontact” email, for at least three reasons: Rule 4.2 (1) is\nlimited to the subject of the representation; (2) is limited to a\nperson represented by counsel in the matter and (3) contains\nan “authorized by law” exception, which safeguards\nconstitutionally-protected expression.         Id.; see also\nPa.R.P.C. 4.2, cmt. ¶¶ 4, 5, 7. Walsh’s “no contact” email\ncontained none of these three limitations.7\n\n\n       7\n         We pass no judgment as to whether Rule 4.2 of the\nPennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct applies where, as\nhere, lawyers represent themselves pro se. See Hazard et al.,\nsupra note 2, § 41.03; Restatement (Third) of the Law\nGoverning Lawyers § 99, cmt. ¶ e (Am. Law Inst. 2016).\n\n\n\n\n                               16\n\f       Thus, we reject Walsh’s attempt to justify his email by\nreference to Rule 4.2. The Mirabellas have pled causation,\nthe final element of their First Amendment retaliation claim.\n\n                               B\n\n       Having held that the Mirabellas adequately alleged a\nFirst Amendment retaliation claim based upon Walsh’s “no\ncontact” email, our inquiry is not complete. We must\nnevertheless determine whether the right was clearly\nestablished under the second prong of qualified immunity.\n\n        In this analysis we are mindful that we must not\n“define clearly established law at a high level of generality.”\nal-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 742. More specifically, the Supreme\nCourt has given us guidance on defining a right in the First\nAmendment retaliation context. In Reichle v. Howards, the\nSupreme Court clarified that it is too broad to define the right\nas the “right to be free from retaliation for one’s speech.”\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"801500\"><a href=\"/opinion/801500/reichle-v-howards/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2088</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2094 (2012). Conversely, Reichle held that is\nproper to define a right as the “right to be free from a\nretaliatory arrest that is otherwise supported by probable\ncause.” Id.\n\n        Reichle is directly applicable to the Mirabellas’\nretaliation claim. As in Reichle, the disputed issue here is\nwhether it was clearly established that the defendant’s act was\nretaliatory.8 Paralleling Reichle, we define the right at issue\n\n\n       8\n           In other First Amendment retaliation cases, the\ndisputed issue may be whether it was clearly established that\nthe plaintiff’s conduct was constitutionally protected. See,\n\n\n\n\n                              17\n\fas the right to be free from a retaliatory restriction on\ncommunication with one’s government, when the plaintiff has\nthreatened or engaged in litigation against the government.\n\n        This right was not clearly established when Walsh sent\nthe “no contact” email. The Mirabellas have identified\nneither Supreme Court precedent nor a “robust consensus of\ncases of persuasive authority.” Mammaro, 814 F.3d at 169\n(citation omitted). The closest case we have identified,\nTuccio, held that the refusal of town officials to meet with a\nlitigation adversary did not amount to First Amendment\nretaliation. Tuccio, 589 F.3d at 541-42. Thus, Walsh is\nentitled to qualified immunity on the Mirabellas’ First\nAmendment retaliation claim.\n\n                               V\n\n       The Mirabellas also assert a direct violation of their\nFirst Amendment right to petition the government for redress\nof grievances, again based upon Walsh’s “no contact” email.\nWe conclude that the Mirabellas have pled a constitutional\nviolation, but that the right was not clearly established for\nqualified immunity purposes.\n\n                               A\n\n         The First Amendment of the United States\nConstitution provides that “Congress shall make no law . . .\nabridging the freedom of speech, . . . or the right of the people\n. . . to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”\n\n\ne.g., Dougherty v.

Krotoszynski, Jr., Reclaiming the\nPetition Clause 104-28 (2012) (chronicling the history of\npetitioning in the United States, including its importance in\nthe abolitionist movement). The Supreme Court described\nthe “special concerns” of the Petition Clause, as compared to\nthe Speech Clause, as follows: “The right to petition allows\ncitizens to express their ideas, hopes, and concerns to their\ngovernment and their elected representatives, whereas the\nright to speak fosters the public exchange of ideas that is\n\n\n\n\n                              19\n\fintegral to deliberative democracy as well as to the whole\nrealm of ideas and human affairs.” Id. at 388 (emphasis\nadded).\n\n        A petition may “undoubtedly” consist of a “personal\ngrievance addressed to the government.” Id. at 394. But\n“[p]etitions to the government assume an added dimension\nwhen they seek to advance political, social, or other ideas of\ninterest to the community as a whole.” Id. at 395. A petition\nneed not “take[] a specific form,” and may include an oral\ngrievance. Mack, 839 F.3d at 299 (citation omitted).\n\n        A petition enjoys constitutional protection whether it is\naddressed, as here, to a local government, or to a state or\nnational government.

Davila, 125 F.3d at 162-63 (holding that\nthe right to petition includes actions taken in anticipation of\nlitigation).\n\n       At the same time, the right to petition is not\n“[u]nrestrained,” Guarnieri, 564 U.S. at 390, or “absolute,”\nMcDonald, 472 U.S. at 484. For example, the Supreme Court\nhas held that “petitions to the President that contain\nintentional and reckless falsehoods ‘do not enjoy\n\n\n\n\n                               20\n\fconstitutional protection.’” McDonald, 472 U.S. at 484\n(citation omitted). Accordingly, we may ask whether the\ngovernment may “nevertheless burden” the right to petition,\ngiven countervailing government interests. BE & K Constr.,\n536 U.S. at 535.\n\n        To balance such competing interests, courts have\ngenerally applied Speech Clause precedent, rather than any\nfreestanding Petition Clause doctrine.9 Guarnieri, 564 U.S. at\n389 (acknowledging this trend); see also Galena v.

But Guarnieri\nclarified that we cannot do so automatically. For while the\nright to petition and the right to free speech “share substantial\ncommon ground,” they are not “identical in their mandate or\ntheir purpose and effect.” Guarnieri, 564 U.S. at 388.\nAccordingly, the Supreme Court cautioned that “Speech\nClause precedents [do not] necessarily and in every case\nresolve Petition Clause claims.” Id. Despite this guidance,\nhowever, Guarnieri did apply Speech Clause precedent,\nrather than forge new ground under the Petition Clause.

To answer this question, we will apply\nfree speech precedent, as the Supreme Court did in Guarnieri.\nId. We conclude that this is appropriate given the “extensive\ncommon ground” of the two rights, and the Supreme Court’s\nown example. Id. at 389. As such, our analysis would be\nidentical if the Mirabellas had framed their argument as a free\nspeech claim, rather than a violation of their right to petition\nthe government.\n\n                               1\n\n        Drawing upon free speech precedent, the Mirabellas\nencourage us to apply a test that is highly deferential to their\nFirst Amendment rights, on at least two theories. First, the\nMirabellas assert that Walsh’s email is a content-based\nrestriction on their speech.       Cf. Nat’l Assoc. for the\nAdvancement of Multijurisdiction Practice (NAAMJP) v.\nCastille, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">799</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">216</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 222-23 (3d Cir. 2015) (explaining that\nspeaker-based restrictions on speech are subject to heightened\nscrutiny when they reflect content-based preferences).\nSecond, the Mirabellas assert that Walsh’s email is a\nrestriction on their political speech. See Citizens United v.\nFEC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1741\"><a href=\"/opinion/1741/citizens-united-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 340 (2010).\n\n      We decline to determine whether these theories apply.\nRather, we will assume for the sake of argument that Walsh’s\n“no contact” email is a content-neutral, “time, place or\nmanner” restriction on the Mirabellas’ speech.         It is\n\n\n\n\n                              22\n\funnecessary to apply greater scrutiny to the restriction\nbecause, as explained below, even under a standard more\ndeferential to Walsh, the “no contact” email is\nunconstitutional.

The restriction need\nnot be the least restrictive means of furthering the\ngovernment’s interests. Id.

Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">725</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">293</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 303 (3d Cir. 2013) (en banc) (citing In re Kendall, 712\nF.3d at 825). That is, the law distinguishes between the\ngovernment’s authority to restrict speech (1) as a “sovereign”\nor (2) as a “property owner, educator, employer, or patron.”\nKathleen M. Sullivan, The Intersection of Free Speech and\nthe Legal Profession: Constraints on Lawyers’ First\nAmendment Rights, 67 Fordham L. Rev. 569, 584-85 (1998).\nWhen the government acts as a sovereign, “robust free speech\nprotection” applies. Id. at 587. But when the government\nacts in certain other capacities, it may be “freer to place\nconditions” on speech. Id.\n\n       Walsh, we conclude, acted as a local “sovereign,” not\nby virtue of any regulatory authority over attorneys. “When\nacting as sovereign, the government is empowered to impose\ntime, place, and manner restrictions on speech . . . .” B.H.,\n725 F.3d at 302 (citing Ward, 492 U.S. at 791). It is this\nstandard that we apply.\n\n\n\n\n                               24\n\fcommunicating with Township employees per Rule 4.2 of the\nPennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct. That Rule, the\ncommentary explains, “contributes to the proper functioning\nof the legal system,” for three reasons: (1) it protects\nrepresented persons from “possible overreaching by other\nlawyers” in the matter; (2) it protects the lawyer-client\nrelationship from interference and (3) it prevents\n“uncounseled disclosure[s].” Pa.R.P.C. 4.2, cmt. ¶ 1; see also\nRestatement (Third) of Law Governing Lawyers, supra note\n7, § 99(A), cmt. ¶ b (same). These governmental interests are\nlegitimate. But see Restatement (Third) of Law Governing\nLawyers, supra note 7, § 101(A), cmt. ¶ b (suggesting that the\nneed for a “no contact” rule is reduced where the represented\nperson is a government entity).\n\n       As to the Mirabellas’ interests, they are substantial.\nConstruing all inferences in their favor, the Mirabellas were\nprohibited from contacting Township officials and employees\ndirectly, for any reason, indefinitely. This ban encompasses,\ninter alia, “normal conversation” and “one-on-one\ncommunication” with government officials—forms of\nexpression “historically . . . closely associated with the\ntransmission of ideas.” McCullen, 134 S.Ct. at 2536.11\n\n\n\n\n      11\n           Walsh’s “no contact” email also substantially\nimpairs the Mirabellas’ interests in petitioning the\ngovernment.     Walsh prohibited the Mirabellas from\n“express[ing] their ideas, hopes, and concerns to their\ngovernment and their elected representatives,” as the Petition\nClause guarantees. Guarnieri, 564 U.S. at 388 (emphasis\nadded).\n\n\n\n\n                             25\n\f        Comparing the parties’ interests, the Mirabellas have\nalleged a burden on their speech substantially greater than\nnecessary to protect the Township’s litigation interests. “[I]t\nis no answer . . . to say . . . that the purpose of these\nregulations was merely to insure high professional standards\nand not to curtail free expression.” Reed v. Town of Gilbert,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2809763\"><a href=\"/opinion/2809763/reed-v-town-of-gilbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under the second\nprong of qualified immunity, however, we conclude that the\nright was not clearly established.\n\n       As stated above, we must not “define clearly\nestablished law at a high level of generality.” al-Kidd, 563\nU.S. at 742. We therefore define the First Amendment right\nat issue as the right to be free from a restriction on\ncommunicating with one’s government, when the plaintiff has\n\n\n      12\n           Because we hold that Walsh’s “no contact” email\nwas not narrowly tailored, we need not reach the additional\nrequirement that a time, place or manner restriction on speech\nleave open ample alternative channels for communication.\nWard, 491 U.S. at 791; see, e.g., Johnson v. City & Cty. of\nPhila., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">486</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 493 (3d Cir. 2011) (conducting this\nanalysis).\n\n\n\n\n                              26\n\fthreatened or engaged in litigation against the government.\nThis right was not clearly established.\n\n        While other cases have held that there is a clearly\nestablished right to petition a local government, those cases\ndid not involve litigation. For example, the Sixth Circuit has\nheld that there is a clearly established right “to petition a\nlocal, elected representative for assistance in dealing with\nlocal government agencies.” Holzemer, 621 F.3d at 527.\nSimilarly, the Tenth Circuit has held that there is a clearly\nestablished right to petition a local government regarding a\ntax assessment. Van Deelen, 497 F.3d at 1159. These cases,\nwhile persuasive, do not establish that “every ‘reasonable\nofficial’” in Walsh’s position would have understood that his\n“no contact” email violated the Mirabellas’ First Amendment\nrights. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 741 (citation omitted). Thus,\nWalsh is entitled to qualified immunity on the Mirabellas’\nPetition Clause claim.\n\n                             VI\n\n       For the reasons above, we will reverse the judgment of\nthe District Court denying, in part, Appellant Walsh and\nMcDonnell’s motion to dismiss and we will remand with\ninstructions to enter judgment in their favor.\n\n\n\n\n                             27\n\f</pre>",
