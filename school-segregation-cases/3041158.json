I.D. No. 1310019248\n      Plaintiff Below,                 §\n      Appellee.                        §\n\n                             Submitted: January 20, 2016\n                               Decided: March 2, 2016\n\nBefore STRINE, Chief Justice; HOLLAND, VALIHURA, VAUGHN, and SEITZ,\nJustices, constituting the Court en Banc.\n\nUpon appeal from the Superior Court. REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\nThomas A. Foley, Esquire, Wilmington, Delaware for Appellant.\n\nAndrew J. Vella, Esquire, Department of Justice, Wilmington, Delaware for Appellee.\n\n\n\n\nVALIHURA, Justice:\n\f       In this direct appeal, Christopher Wheeler (“Wheeler”) seeks to overturn his\n\nconviction of Dealing in Child Pornography. He raises two issues. First, he challenges\n\na September 18, 2014 decision of the Superior Court denying his Amended and\n\nSuperseding Motion to Suppress (“Motion to Suppress”). The Motion to Suppress sought\n\nto exclude evidence collected from Wheeler’s home and office during a search executed\n\npursuant to two warrants related to witness tampering. The challenged warrants covered\n\nWheeler’s entire digital universe and essentially had no limitations. In performing the\n\nsearch, officers seized 19 electronic devices and other digital media. Despite the broad,\n\ngeneralized language in the challenged warrants, the State found no evidence of witness\n\ntampering on any of Wheeler’s devices. But when performing a cursory search of the\n\ndata on an iMac found in Wheeler’s piano room closet (the “iMac”), police discovered\n\nfiles containing child pornography. Wheeler contends that the search warrants were in\n\nthe nature of “general warrants” and were overly broad in scope, in violation of the\n\nFourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, § 6 of the Delaware\n\nConstitution.1\n\n       Second, Wheeler appeals from a December 22, 2014 decision of the Superior\n\nCourt denying his Motion to Dismiss and/or for Judgment of Acquittal (“Motion for\n\nJudgment of Acquittal”). Wheeler was charged with 25 identical counts of Dealing in\n\nChild Pornography based upon 25 images of child sexual exploitation—all of which were\n\nfound on the iMac. Wheeler argues that there was insufficient evidence to convict him\n\n\n1\n  Wheeler is joined by amicus curiae, American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Delaware\n(the “ACLU”), which filed a brief in support of reversal.\n                                            1\n\fbecause the State could not establish that he was aware of the existence of the offending\n\nimages in his “newsgroup cache.” The State admits it has no proof that Wheeler ever\n\nviewed any of the images, which automatically “cached” on his computer, with no human\n\nintervention, as a result of his subscription to certain “newsgroups.”        Wheeler was\n\nsentenced to 50 years at Level V.\n\n       Throughout these proceedings, Wheeler has asserted that the State utilized charges\n\nof witness tampering stemming from his admission in 2013 that he had molested two\n\nbrothers in Pennsylvania in the 1980’s as a pretext to search broadly for child\n\npornography. The challenged warrants in this case are the witness tampering warrants—\n\nnot the later-obtained child pornography warrant.         But the State admits that the\n\nchallenged witness tampering warrants were virtual copies of an off-the-shelf warrant for\n\nchild pornography.\n\n       Because we agree that the challenged witness tampering warrants were in the\n\nnature of “general warrants” in violation of the United States and Delaware Constitutions,\n\nwe reverse the judgments of the Superior Court and remand this matter for further\n\nproceedings in accordance with this Opinion.\n\n                                      I.     FACTS\n\n                               A.     Christopher Wheeler\n\n       Christopher Wheeler is the former headmaster at the Tower Hill School (“Tower\n\nHill”) in Wilmington, Delaware. He has an adult son, NK,2 whom he adopted when NK\n\n\n2\n Because the victims in this matter were juveniles at the time they were subject to abuse, we\nhave assigned pseudonyms sua sponte.\n                                             2\n\fwas twelve or thirteen.3 In the 1980’s, Wheeler lived with the “W” family in West\n\nChester, Pennsylvania for months at a time. The Ws took in a number of students that\n\nattended the Westtown School, where the three W brothers went to school.4 Wheeler was\n\none of these students. Wheeler was approximately 16 or 17 when he began living with\n\nthe Ws. Even after he left Westtown School, Wheeler maintained a relationship with the\n\nW family.\n\n          Approximately 35 years ago, Wheeler sexually abused two of the W brothers. In\n\n2005, Wheeler returned to the Delaware area after having spent time in Illinois with his\n\nadopted son. Wheeler became the headmaster of Tower Hill. In 2008, Wheeler and NK\n\nlived with the Ws before moving onto the Tower Hill campus.\n\n    B.     In 2013, the W Brothers Confront Wheeler About the Abuse Wheeler Inflicted\n                               on Them in the Early 1980’s\n\n          After the Jerry Sandusky scandal broke, one of the W brothers, MW, resolved to\n\ntell his two adult brothers, SW and TW, that Wheeler had molested him when he was\n\napproximately 11 to 13 years old, at a time when Wheeler was in his early-20’s. Upon\n\nhearing this, SW told his brothers that Wheeler had also molested him when he was\n\napproximately 13 to 15 years old. TW told MW and SW that, although Wheeler had\n\nnever physically or sexually abused him, Wheeler had inappropriate sexual conversations\n\nwith TW when TW was a boy.\n\n          After the W brothers told each other about their past experiences with Wheeler,\n\nMW wrote Wheeler a letter. The letter read, in part: “I shudder at the notion that you, in\n\n3\n    A27 (Affidavit 1 ¶ 6).\n4\n    A135.\n                                             3\n\fyour career, have chosen an environment that brings you into daily contact with other\n\nboys who are as old as I was when you molested me.”5 MW’s letter also provided that\n\nMW “wants nothing to do with Chris Wheeler ever and wants him to stay away from him\n\nand his family.”6 MW supplied Investigator Robert Schreiber (“Investigator Schreiber”)\n\nof the Delaware Department of Justice with a copy of the letter.\n\n       On July 20, 2013, SW also wrote Wheeler. MW provided Investigator Schreiber\n\nwith a “draft” of SW’s letter. Unlike MW’s letter, SW’s three-page letter invited a\n\nresponse from Wheeler. It read, in part:\n\n       If I had known the torment, pain, humiliation, and anger that your\n       molestation and abuse of me as a child would cause me these 35 years later,\n       I would have had greater strength to stand up to you and defend myself.\n       The fact that you preyed upon me in my own home, from the room next to\n       mine, is lewd and inexcusable. The reality that you continue to shirk any\n       responsibility for the harm that you caused, as if it never occurred, will\n       continue no longer.7\n\n                                           *       *   *\n\n       I will not keep quiet and hide from your abuses any longer. I have not yet\n       determined how or when to tell my parents of the harm, pain, and\n       humiliation that you have caused. . . . The real and full truth must be told\n       and brought to light; beginning now.\n\n       The only thing that I am sorry for is that it has taken me this long to gain\n       the fortitude to bring your past abuses to the surface, to move towards\n       holding you accountable for your predatory and abusive actions. Despite\n       my pain and anger, I am curious to return part of the burden to you; what\n       does justice look like for Chris Wheeler for the molestation you\n       perpetuated, culpability you willingly evade, and the harms that you\n\n\n\n5\n  A27 (Affidavit 1 ¶ 10).\n6\n  Id.\n7\n  A130.\n                                               4\n\f         continue to cause? What role (if any) should you play in determining\n         appropriate resolution to and restitution for the abuses you have caused?8\n\n         On July 23, 2013, Wheeler responded to SW’s letter. In his reply letter, Wheeler\n\nadmits his wrongdoing. It reads, in part:\n\n         I will not compound your pain by attempting to deny or in any way deflect\n         responsibility for my actions 35 years ago. I did those things. I am the one\n         responsible.\n\n         I am profoundly sorry. Some things are unforgivable, so I don’t expect\n         forgiveness from any of you. Nevertheless, I ask for your forgiveness.\n\n                                            *       *      *\n\n         The truth is that I have carried inside of me a profound and loud\n         dissonance, an ever-present reminder that some evil has been done and it\n         cannot be undone. And I am responsible for it.\n\n                                            *       *      *\n\n         You hoped for proof of my conscience, my contrition, my sense of\n         accountability. Only you know if you see proof of those things in this\n         letter. Regarding my compunction to make right the many wrongs that I\n         have committed, perhaps this letter is evidence of at least a few steps in that\n         direction as well. I’ll wait to hear from you about further appropriate steps\n         towards resolution and restitution.9\n\n         MW provided the investigators with a copy of Wheeler’s response. SW told\n\ninvestigators that he still had Wheeler’s original response letter and the corresponding\n\nFedEx envelope in his possession.\n\n         Rather than writing a letter, TW held telephone conversations with Wheeler to\n\narrange a face-to-face meeting at Wheeler’s home on July 25, 2013. TW also exchanged\n\ne-mails with Wheeler, who used his Tower Hill e-mail address. According to TW, at the\n\n8\n    A130-32 (emphasis added).\n9\n    A133 (emphasis added).\n                                                5\n\fmeeting, Wheeler apologized for his previous actions and told TW that he was going to\n\nmeet with NK to tell him about his abuse of the W brothers. Wheeler also told TW that\n\nhe had recently contemplated suicide.\n\nC.     The Witness Tampering Warrants Target Wheeler’s Entire Digital Universe and\n               are Cut-and-Pasted from Child Pornography Warrants\n\n       On October 22, 2013, the Wilmington Police Department, working in concert with\n\nthe State of Delaware, sought and obtained two search warrants from the Superior Court.\n\nThe first search warrant (“Warrant 1”) related to Wheeler’s residence in Wilmington,\n\nDelaware and his 2011 Chevrolet Equinox. The second warrant (“Warrant 2” and jointly\n\nwith Warrant 1, the “Witness Tampering Warrants”) was for Wheeler’s office at Tower\n\nHill and for the same vehicle.\n\n       The Witness Tampering Warrants were substantially similar and were each\n\nsupported by a corresponding affidavit of probable cause.10 The Witness Tampering\n\nWarrants and Affidavits together sought to gather evidence related to two witness\n\ntampering crimes: (1) Tampering with a Witness under 11 Del. C. § 1263(3); and (2) Act\n\nof Intimidation of a Witness under 11 Del. C. § 3532. The affiants were Detective\n\nCecilia E. Ashe (“Detective Ashe”) and Chief Investigator Robert J. Irwin (“Chief\n\nInvestigator Irwin”).    On the date the Witness Tampering Warrants were issued,\n\nDetective Ashe was an officer with the Wilmington Police Department.                   Chief\n\n\n10\n  For purposes of this Opinion, Warrant 1’s affidavit of probable cause is referred to as\n“Affidavit 1.” Warrant 2’s affidavit of probable cause is referred to as “Affidavit 2.”\nCollectively, Affidavit 1 and Affidavit 2 are referred to as the “Affidavits.” Similarly, the\napplications in support of the Witness Tampering Warrants are collectively referred to as the\n“Applications.”\n                                             6\n\fInvestigator Irwin was with the Delaware Department of Justice and, at the time, was\n\nassigned to the Child Predator Task Force. Investigator Schreiber is also mentioned\n\nthroughout the Affidavits, as he provided information to Detective Ashe and Chief\n\nInvestigator Irwin.\n\n       The Affidavits are based in large part on interviews with the W brothers, and\n\nincorporate the brothers’ statements regarding communications they had with Wheeler in\n\nJuly 2013. The police also interviewed MW’s wife and the W brothers’ parents. As to\n\nNK, the sum of the witness tampering allegations contained in the Affidavits is that an\n\nofficer of the Bluffton Police Department in Bluffton, South Carolina told Investigator\n\nSchreiber that, while investigating an incident at NK’s South Carolina residence, NK\n\ninformed him that Wheeler would “penetrate his anus and that [NK] never previously\n\nreported this to the authorities because [Wheeler] would pay him off.”11 The Affidavits\n\nsuggest that this took place in Illinois, but provide no other details regarding Wheeler’s\n\nalleged tampering with NK.\n\n       The Affidavits state that MW spoke with authorities during the week of October\n\n14, 2013. MW told personnel in the Department of Justice that approximately 35 years\n\nago, when he was 12 or 13 years old, Wheeler molested him. At the time, Wheeler was\n\n22 or 23 years old. MW also stated that Wheeler molested SW when SW was a boy.12\n\n\n\n\n11\n  A28 (Affidavit 1 ¶ 20).\n12\n  A26 (Affidavit 1 ¶ 2). SW told Investigator Schreiber that Wheeler molested him when he\nwas approximately 13 to 15 years old. A28 (Affidavit 1 ¶ 15). SW stated that “the sexual abuse\ntook place multiple times over a period of months, possibly for a year.” A28 (Affidavit 1 ¶ 15).\n                                               7\n\fMW advised that the sexual abuse took place when Wheeler lived at the W family\n\nresidence in West Chester, Pennsylvania.\n\n      The Affidavits refer to and quote from the italicized portions of the letters in the\n\nprevious section. The Affidavits also recount that the W brothers decided to confront\n\nWheeler about the abuse he had inflicted upon them. The first communication from the\n\nW brothers to Wheeler occurred in July 2013.\n\n      According to the Affidavits, in July 2013, MW sent a letter to Wheeler,\n\nconfronting him about what had happened. TW also confronted Wheeler in a face-to-\n\nface meeting in Wilmington, Delaware. On October 22, 2013, TW told Investigator\n\nSchreiber, according to the Affidavits, that he and Wheeler “communicated via telephone\n\nand e-mail using [Wheeler’s] Tower Hill [e]-[m]ail address to coordinate a meeting in\n\nWilmington and then to communicate since.”\n\n      The Affidavits provide that NK complained about Wheeler to MW’s mother when\n\nvisiting her home in West Chester, Pennsylvania. During a visit, NK “stated that his\n\nfather had abused him[,]” according to the Affidavits. When MW’s mother asked NK\n\nwhat he meant, NK responded: “You know. You know.”\n\n      According to the Affidavits, on October 22, 2013, Investigator Schreiber contacted\n\nOfficer Anson Singleton of the Bluffton Police Department. The Affidavits then recite\n\nthe following: “Officer Singleton stated that while investigating the incident at [NK’s]\n\nresidence, [NK] told him that his dad would penetrate his anus and that he never\n\npreviously reported this to the authorities because his father would pay him off. When\n\nthe officer asked [NK] where this occurred, [NK] said it occurred when they lived in\n\n                                           8\n\fIllinois.” The Affidavits did not provide a time frame as to when these events allegedly\n\noccurred.\n\n       The first three sections of the Affidavits set forth the background of the affiants\n\n(“Section A”), “Terms and Definitions” (“Section B”), and “Issues of Staleness\n\nAssociated with [C]omputer [I]nvestigations” (“Section C”). Sections A and B highlight\n\nthe extensive background of Chief Investigator Irwin in the area of crimes against\n\nchildren, and generally describe electronic data, electronic filing systems, hard drives,\n\nstorage media, and Internet and local networks. The broad, sweeping “staleness” section,\n\ncomprised of five paragraphs, emphasizes that digital data can often be forensically\n\nrecovered “years after it [i]s written.”13\n\n       Against the backdrop of this boilerplate language, which underscores technology’s\n\ncapacity to preserve digital data for lengthy periods of time and the ability of forensic\n\nexperts to recover it, the concluding paragraphs of the Affidavits recite the history and\n\nfacts underlying the complaint (“Section D”). The concluding paragraphs of Section D\n\nrefer to documents, e-mails, and “other electronically stored communications,” and state\n\nthat cellular phones may contain evidence, including text messages and e-mails.\n\nAlthough the investigators had copies of the letters referenced above, the Affidavits state\n\nthat “there may be evidence of written communications at the residence and the personal\n\nwork place [sic] of the subject” and that “[w]ritten communications were sent to the\n\n13\n   Section C also states that, “[w]ith the advent of larger capacity hard-drives, removable media,\nand CD/DVD burners over the past several years, the retention and therefore recovery of, data\nfrom digital media has greatly increased.” A25. With respect to DVDs and CDs, Section C\nobserves that “[t]he data stored on them is highly stable and not usually subject to corruption\nbarring physical damage to the media itself.” A25-26.\n                                                9\n\fvictims . . . .” The affiant averred that “evidence of this correspondence may be envelope\n\n[sic], letters, address books and handwritten notes.”\n\n       Later on October 22, 2013, the Wilmington Police Department and the State of\n\nDelaware obtained the Witness Tampering Warrants.14\n\n       Despite mention of written communications in the Affidavits, the Witness\n\nTampering Warrants listed, under “ITEMS TO BE SEARCHED FOR AND SEIZED[,]”\n\nthe following broad categories of items:\n\n       2. Search the following location within the residence described herein the\n          application and affidavit [sic] to include but not limited to: locked or unlocked\n          safes, boxes, bags, compartments, storage areas or things in the nature thereof,\n          found in or upon said residence that could be used to contain evidence[.]\n\n       3.

Any digital or optical data storage device connected to, capable of being\n          connected to, read by, or capable of being read by, any item described in\n          paragraph 4, to include: internal or external hard drives (found within or\n          without any item seized pursuant to paragraph 4), mass storage devices, pen\n          drives, smart cards, compact disks(CD), compact disk – recordable (CD R) or\n          re-writable (CD RW), floppy diskettes, DVD+/- R or RW, or any other such\n          device that stores digital data optically, electronically, or magnetically.\n\n       5. Any cellular telephone, to include the registry entries, call logs, pictures, video\n          recordings[,] text messages, user names, buddy lists, screen names, telephone\n          numbers, writings or other digital material as it relates to this investigation.\n\n\n\n14\n   The Applications, with respect to the items to be searched for and seized, are substantially\nsimilar to the Witness Tampering Warrants. Compare A19, with A21-22. Compare A31, with\nA33-34.\n                                              10\n\f         6.

Any and all data, and the forensic examination thereof, stored by whatever\n            means on any items seized pursuant to paragraphs 4, 5, and 6, as described\n            above to include but not limited to: registry entries, pictures, images,\n            temporary internet files, internet history files, chat logs, writings, passwords,\n            user names, buddy names, screen names, email, connection logs, or other\n            evidence.\n\n         8. Any file, writing, log, artifact, paper, document, billing record or other\n            instrument, stored electronically or in printed form, which relates to or\n            references the owner of items seized pursuant to paragraphs [] 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n            and 8, as described above.15\n\n         After reviewing the Affidavits, a Superior Court judge (the “Issuing Judge”)\n\ndetermined that there was probable cause for a search and seizure of Wheeler’s property.\n\nThe Witness Tampering Warrants were then issued.\n\n                                D.     The Search and Seizure\n\n         During the evening of October 22, 2013, law enforcement officers executed the\n\nwarrants for Wheeler’s home and office at Tower Hill.               The team seized several\n\ncomputers and other electronic devices, including: (1) two iMacs; (2) a Mac PowerBook\n\nG4; (3) two external hard drives; (4) two iPhones; (5) a Tungsten Palm; (6) an iPad; (7) a\n\nMacBook Pro; (8) 26 CDs; and (9) 23 DVDs.\n\n         After the Witness Tampering Warrants were executed, Sergeant Kevin Perna of\n\nthe Delaware State Police Department (“Sergeant Perna”)—a forensic examiner who, at\n\nthe time, had performed nearly 500 forensic examinations and taught classes related to\n\nthe subject at a local law school and the Delaware police academy—conducted a forensic\n\n15\n     A19 (Warrant 1 ¶¶ 2-8) (emphasis added); A31 (Warrant 2 ¶¶ 2-8) (emphasis added).\n                                               11\n\fsearch of the seized devices using EnCase. This was his first forensic examination using\n\nEnCase, a software program utilized by law enforcement to forensically examine\n\ncomputers and other electronics. Using this software, a forensic examiner can perform\n\nkeyword searches, access files that a standard computer search would not uncover, and\n\nview “all the contents on [a] hard drive . . . .”16\n\n       Despite orders from Chief Investigator Irwin that directed Sergeant Perna to\n\nsearch for “text-type” documents, Sergeant Perna’s forensic evaluation of Wheeler’s data\n\ncaptured “image files” and “video files.”17 Sergeant Perna acknowledged that video and\n\nimage files were not implicated in the context of this case and were not subsumed within\n\nhis “more restrictive” marching orders from Chief Investigator Irwin.18\n\n       Sergeant Perna also acknowledged that the EnCase software enabled him to filter\n\nWheeler’s data by limiting the search results to certain file extensions, such as .doc, .text,\n\n.pdf, which were among the items he was seeking, and that he could have removed image\n\nand movie video files. He testified as follows:\n\n       Q.      . . . So had you put those kind of conditions [sic] in, it would have\n       restricted the files that would have popped up and you would not have seen\n       video or image files; correct?\n\n       A.      Yes.19\n\nInstead of restricting his search, Sergeant Perna performed a review of the “folder\n\nstructure” on the iMac, including the “Desktop” folder, which enabled him to review all\n\n\n16\n   A185 (Tr. 14:3-6).\n17\n   See A194 (Tr. 47:6-8).\n18\n   A193 (Tr. 43:10-13); A194 (Tr. 47:16-23).\n19\n   A194 (Tr. 48:10-14).\n                                               12\n\fof Wheeler’s digital files. He stated that he prefers to “see all of the files, . . . [so that he\n\ncan] find the ones that are pertinent and things that are not pertinent.”20 This cursory\n\nsearch of the files on the hard drive of the iMac occurred while Sergeant Perna ran a\n\nkeyword search using the terms “witness intimidation” and “witness tampering.” During\n\nthis cursory review, he found files that appeared to be video files. Because these files—\n\nlabeled “GERBYS II” and “hippodrome boys large”—seemed suspicious, Sergeant Perna\n\nasked Detective Scott Garland (“Detective Garland”) if he was familiar with them.\n\nDetective Garland explained that these titles were related to child pornography.\n\n       Based upon Sergeant Perna’s discovery of these two files, on October 29, 2013,\n\nthe State obtained an additional search warrant from the Kent County Superior Court to\n\nsearch previously seized devices for child pornography (the “Child Pornography\n\nWarrant”).21 The Child Pornography Warrant authorized the search and seizure of digital\n\ndevices the investigators already had in their custody.22 The State did not open the video\n\nfiles until it obtained the Child Pornography Warrant.23 After viewing the files, the State\n\nsought and obtained an indictment against Wheeler on charges of Dealing in Child\n\nPornography under 11 Del. C. § 1109(4).\n\n                                    E.      The Indictment\n\n20\n   A197 (Tr. 62:19-21).\n21\n   On October 23, 2013, a separate search warrant was obtained for Wheeler’s 2011 Chevrolet\nTahoe. On October 25, 2013, the State also obtained a search warrant for Wheeler’s airplane.\n22\n   The application for the Child Pornography Warrant contained a broad “catch-all” provision\nthat was nearly identical to the catch-all provision in the Witness Tampering Warrants, all of\nwhich permitted the search, seizure, and forensic examination of “[a]ny and all data” on\nWheeler’s devices.\n23\n   Wheeler correctly maintains that, if his challenge to the Witness Tampering Warrants is\nsuccessful, all evidence seized and recovered thereafter represents “fruit of the poisonous tree.”\n                                               13\n\f        On December 9, 2013, a Grand Jury returned an indictment against Wheeler. The\n\nindictment charged Wheeler with 25 counts of Dealing in Child Pornography in violation\n\nof 11 Del. C. § 1109(4). In relevant part, the statute provides:\n\n        A person is guilty of dealing in child pornography when: . . . (4) The\n        person, intentionally compiles, enters, accesses, transmits, receives,\n        exchanges, disseminates, stores, makes, prints, reproduces or otherwise\n        possesses any photograph, image, file, data or other visual depiction of a\n        child engaging in a prohibited sexual act or in the simulation of such an\n        act.24\n\n        Of the 19 devices seized from Wheeler’s home and office, three contained images\n\nof child pornography. The indictment was based upon 25 images recovered from the\n\nnewsgroup cache on Wheeler’s iMac. The iMac itself had not been turned on since\n\nSeptember 29, 2012.25 Of the 25 images of child pornography, only one was cached after\n\n2009. Specifically, one image was cached on September 2, 2005, one image was cached\n\non January 1, 2010, and the remaining images were cached between July and September\n\n2009.\n\n                               F.     The Motion to Suppress\n\n        On May 5, 2014, Wheeler filed the Motion to Suppress. On May 23, 2014, the\n\nSuperior Court held a hearing on the Motion to Suppress. The State presented the\n\ntestimony of Sergeant Perna. Wheeler presented testimony from his expert witness, Tami\n\nL. Loehrs (“Loehrs”). Sergeant Perna testified that he was looking for evidence of\n\nwitness tampering and witness intimidation, particularly in the form of “text-type”\n\n24\n  11 Del. C. § 1109(4).\n25\n   A245 (Tr. 49:5-10). As Sergeant Perna testified, the forensic significance of the date of last\naccess merely signified the date on which the computer was last powered on, and it did not\nreflect that any newsgroup or newsreader was accessed on that date. A245 (Tr. 49:11-17).\n                                               14\n\fdocuments. On cross-examination, he agreed that the Witness Tampering Warrants’ lists\n\nof items to be searched for and seized were “almost virtually identical to exactly the list\n\n[one] would see in a child pornography case.”           He also agreed that the Witness\n\nTampering Warrants essentially had no limitations and that the warrants, on their face,\n\nwere “wide open.”\n\n       The Superior Court heard final arguments from the parties on the Motion to\n\nSuppress on July 11, 2014. The State, again, conceded that the substance of the Witness\n\nTampering Warrants “could be viewed as a cut-and-paste from a [warrant related to]\n\nchild porn[.]”26 Further, at oral argument before this Court, the State conceded that the\n\nWitness Tampering Warrants did not contain “anything particularized from the evidence\n\nthat they were . . . searching.”27\n\n       On September 18, 2014, the Superior Court issued its Opinion denying Wheeler’s\n\nMotion to Suppress.28 The Superior Court did not explicitly address the issue of whether\n\nthe Witness Tampering Warrants were general warrants in violation of the Fourth\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, Article I, § 6 of the Delaware Constitution,\n\nand 11 Del. C. § 2307(a).\n\n                                     G.   The Bench Trial\n\n26\n   A230 (Tr. 34:16-19) (The Superior Court: “How do you address the issue that this could be\nviewed as a cut-and-paste from a child porn [warrant]?” Prosecutor: “Well, [Y]our Honor, I\ndon’t -- the State concedes that.”).\n27\n   Videotape: Oral Argument before the Delaware Supreme Court, at 43:35 (Christopher\nWheeler v. State of Delaware, No. 205, 2015, Jan. 20, 2016), archived at\nhttp://livestream.com/accounts/5969852/events/4710274/videos/109946633/player?autoPlay=fal\nse&height=360&mute=false&width=640 [hereinafter, “Oral Argument at __”].\n28\n   See generally State v. Wheeler, 2014 WL 4735126 (Del. Super. Sept. 18, 2014) [hereinafter,\n“Wheeler I, 2014 WL 4735126, at __”].\n                                             15\n\f       On October 7, 2014, the Superior Court held a bench trial. The parties stipulated\n\nto the facts that Wheeler was the sole user of each of the seized devices and that each of\n\nthe 25 images at issue constituted child pornography under Delaware law. Wheeler did\n\nnot take the stand in his defense, and the sole witness at trial was Sergeant Perna.\n\nHowever, since becoming EnCase certified in 2013, Sergeant Perna had never performed\n\na child pornography-related forensic examination before his evaluation of Wheeler’s\n\ndigital universe.29\n\n       At trial, it was undisputed that the charged images came to be on each of\n\nWheeler’s devices through his subscription to newsgroups. Newsgroups are Internet\n\ndiscussion groups in which people exchange, browse, upload, and download files, which\n\ncan be documents, photos, or videos. It was also undisputed that there is nothing illegal\n\nabout newsgroups as a general matter, and that they exist on a variety of legitimate\n\ntopics. Because the 25 indicted images were found in the newsgroup cache, the State\n\nagreed throughout the proceedings that this was not an Internet case.                Nor was an\n\nindictment obtained with respect to Wheeler’s Internet activity.\n\n       Sergeant Perna testified that the 25 charged images were found in two newsgroups\n\nthat Wheeler subscribed to: “alt.binaries.pictures.asparagus” and “alt.fan.air.”30\n\nHowever, Sergeant Perna acknowledged that there is no way to forensically determine\n\nwhether a newsreader user has viewed any particular file. Accordingly, at oral argument\n\n29\n   Sergeant Perna’s testimony in this case represented the first time that he had ever testified as\nan expert in a child pornography trial.\n30\n   A240 (Tr. 29:8-31:6). Sergeant Perna found four newsgroups related to child pornography\nthat Wheeler subscribed to on the PowerBook: “alt.binaries.pictures.asparagus,”\n“alt.fan.prettyboy,” “alt.fan.rdm,” and “alt.fan.snuffles.” Id. at Tr. 31:11-32:6.\n                                                16\n\fbefore this Court, the State conceded that it could not conclusively prove that Wheeler\n\never viewed the 25 charged images at issue.31\n\n       At trial, Sergeant Perna acknowledged that he had no expertise concerning\n\nnewsgroups or newsreaders.32        He explained that information from newsgroups\n\nautomatically caches on the subscriber’s computer, regardless of whether the user\n\naccesses that information.     But if Wheeler had downloaded the images of child\n\npornography from the newsgroups, Sergeant Perna agreed that such images should have\n\nappeared somewhere other than the cache on Wheeler’s computer. Here, the 25 charged\n\nimages appeared only in the cache. Accordingly, Sergeant Perna conceded that the\n\ngovernment could not forensically establish that Wheeler ever viewed the 25 indicted\n\nimages:\n\n       Q.     Fair to say that the 25 charged images here found in the cache, you cannot\n       forensically say whether or not they were ever viewed, correct, you can simply say\n       they cached?\n\n       A.     Cached.33\n\n                                          *        *    *\n\n       Q.    But it is possible that not only was the image never viewed, but the\n       news[]group wasn’t even visited on those dates when they cached, correct?\n\n       A.     Correct.34\n\n                                          *        *    *\n\n\n31\n   See Oral Argument at 52:20.\n32\n   See A243 (Tr. 43:6-8) (Q. [Newsreaders are] not something that you had a lot of expertise\nabout, correct? A. No, sir.).\n33\n   A250 (Tr. 71:4-8).\n34\n   A251 (Tr. 76:12-15).\n                                              17\n\f          Q.    And you cannot say that Mr. Wheeler actually opened up and viewed the\n          news[]groups on the days in question?\n\n          A.     No.\n\n          Q.    And you cannot say that he ever viewed any of the images that he has been\n          charged for, correct?\n\n          A.     No.35\n\n                                           *        *   *\n\n          Q.     All you can tell is what news[]group the person has selected a box [sic],\n          correct?\n\n          A.     Yes.\n\n          Q.    You can never know if they ever even viewed that particular news box,\n          much less the contents within?\n\n          A.     No.36\n\nBased upon such testimony, Wheeler argued that the State had not adequately proved that\n\nhe possessed the indicted images because the State failed to establish that he even viewed\n\nthe images.\n\n                         H.    The Motion for Judgment of Acquittal\n\n          Between the close of evidence and closing arguments, Wheeler filed his Motion\n\nfor Judgment of Acquittal. On December 22, 2014, the Superior Court denied Wheeler’s\n\nMotion for Judgment of Acquittal, finding Wheeler guilty of each of the 25 indicted\n\ncounts of Dealing in Child Pornography. The trial court concluded that the evidence\n\ndemonstrated that “Wheeler developed a pattern of Internet browsing for child\n\n\n35\n     A252 (Tr. 80:7-13).\n36\n     A253 (Tr. 82:22:-83:5).\n                                               18\n\fpornography.”37 In part, the trial court reasoned that “[t]he sheer number of images . . .\n\nsupports the reasonable inference that Mr. Wheeler intentionally, as opposed to\n\ninadvertently, possessed child pornography.”38\n\n       On April 24, 2015, Wheeler was sentenced to 50 years at Level V. Two days\n\nlater, on April 26, 2015, Wheeler filed his Notice of Appeal in this Court.\n\n                           I.      Proceedings Before this Court\n\n       Wheeler appeals from the Superior Court’s denial of both of his motions, although\n\nhe focuses primarily on the trial court’s denial of his Motion to Suppress. As to the\n\nMotion to Suppress, he contends that the Superior Court erred because: (1) the Affidavits\n\nfailed to establish probable cause that he committed the alleged witness tampering\n\ncrimes; (2) the State deliberately and recklessly omitted information from the Affidavits\n\nthat was material to the Issuing Judge’s probable cause determination; (3) the Affidavits\n\nfailed to establish the required nexus between evidence of witness tampering and the\n\nitems to be searched for and seized; and (4) the Witness Tampering Warrants were\n\nunconstitutionally overbroad.\n\n\n37\n   State v. Wheeler, 2014 WL 7474234, at *13 (Del. Super. Dec. 22, 2014) [hereinafter, “Wheeler\nII, 2014 WL 7474234, at __”]. Although the State filed no charges relating to 2,000 images of\nchild pornography and 3,000 images of child erotica discovered across Wheeler’s digital\nuniverse, it argued that these images were evidence of Wheeler’s intentional possession, receipt,\nand compilation of the 25 charged images. Further, although the record is not entirely clear, the\nState contends that these images were downloaded from the Internet through the use of\nnewsgroups. Ans. Br. 5. The trial court relied upon the 2,000 images of child pornography as\nevidence that Wheeler intentionally, as opposed to inadvertently, possessed the 25 charged\nimages. Wheeler II, 2014 WL 7474234, at *13. Sergeant Perna found a program called\n“NetShred X” on certain of Wheeler’s devices. According to Sergeant Perna, NetShred X is a\nprogram that erases a user’s Internet activity from the computer’s hard drive. See A242 (Tr.\n37:10-14). Notably, the State agrees that this is not an Internet case.\n38\n   Wheeler II, 2014 WL 7474234, at *13.\n                                               19\n\f       Because we conclude that the Witness Tampering Warrants are prohibited general\n\nwarrants, we do not reach Wheeler’s assertion that no probable cause existed to issue the\n\nWitness Tampering Warrants. We briefly address it only insofar as it bears on the\n\nconstitutional analysis and provides useful context.\n\n       The witness tampering charges relate to three individuals: NK and two of the W\n\nbrothers. As to NK, the Affidavits suggest that he never reported Wheeler’s sexual abuse\n\nto the police because “his father would pay him off.”39 But the State conceded during\n\noral argument before this Court that there was likely no evidence of the witness\n\ntampering that allegedly occurred in Illinois present in Wheeler’s Delaware home or\n\noffice: according to the State, the police were “not going to find anything regarding\n\n[NK], the son.”40\n\n       That leaves the W brothers’ allegations as a possible basis for justifying the search\n\nand seizure of Wheeler’s property. As to the W brothers, the Affidavits establish that\n\nthey initiated communication with Wheeler beginning in July 2013. But Sergeant Perna\n\nsearched Wheeler’s iMac for evidence of witness tampering related to such\n\ncommunication, despite the fact that the iMac had not been powered on since September\n\n2012. Upon discovering that the iMac had last been turned on in 2012, Sergeant Perna\n\n\n\n39\n   Wheeler argues that “the [A]ffidavits do not allege that any witness tampering of [NK]\noccurred in Delaware or within 5 years to satisfy [Delaware’s] statute of limitations.” Op. Br.\n20. The record evidence indicates that Wheeler’s alleged “pay offs” to NK occurred in Illinois,\nyears before the underlying search. Specifically, the Affidavits suggest that this conduct\noccurred when Wheeler and NK lived in Illinois, but do not indicate whether NK provided the\nBluffton Police with particular dates as to when the pay offs were made. Nor was any evidence\npresented to this Court showing that such payments were made.\n40\n   Oral Argument at 40:25.\n                                              20\n\fshould have terminated his forensic examination of the device since it could not contain\n\ninformation from the relevant time frame.\n\n       Further, Wheeler argues that none of the evidence presented creates a reasonable\n\ninference that he acted “knowingly and with malice.”41 In his July 20, 2013 letter to\n\nWheeler, SW first raised the matter of restitution and Wheeler responded that he would\n\nwait to hear from SW “about further appropriate steps towards resolution and restitution.”\n\nWhether an offer of civil restitution forms a sufficient basis for witness tampering and\n\nintimidation charges—such that it establishes that the offeror acts knowingly and with\n\nmalice in attempting to undermine any trial, proceeding, or inquiry—presents a question,\n\nwhere, as here, the offer of restitution is responsive to a request from the potential\n\nwitness, is accompanied by an admission of guilt, and does not indicate an intention to\n\nprevent the potential witness from contacting law enforcement. We do not address these\n\nother important arguments, since we think it is clear that the challenged warrants were of\n\na kind which it was the purpose of the Fourth Amendment to forbid—general warrants.\n\nThus, even accepting for the sake of argument that the Witness Tampering Warrants were\n\nissued upon probable cause, the order denying the Motion to Suppress must be reversed.\n\n41\n   See 11 Del. C. § 1263 (“A person is guilty of tampering with a witness when: . . . (3) The\nperson knowingly intimidates a witness or victim under circumstances set forth in subchapter III\nof Chapter 35 of this title.”). A person is guilty of the Act of Intimidating a Witness when that\nperson “knowingly and with malice attempts to prevent another person who has been the victim\nof a crime, or a witness to a crime (or any person acting on behalf of a victim or witness) from”\nengaging in certain enumerated acts related to the administration or enforcement of the law. See\n11 Del. C. § 3532.\n        Wheeler also raises a reverse-Franks claim pursuant to the United States Supreme\nCourt’s decision in Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978). He contends that the State\nintentionally or recklessly omitted material information from the Affidavits. Because we find\nthat the Witness Tampering Warrants are unconstitutionally general, we also need not reach this\nissue.\n                                               21\n\f                                     II.    ANALYSIS\n\n          In assessing Wheeler’s challenge to the Witness Tampering Warrants on the\n\ngrounds that they violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and\n\nArticle I, § 6 of the Delaware Constitution, we review such alleged constitutional\n\nviolations de novo.42      We also apply de novo review to the Superior Court’s legal\n\nconclusions when reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress.43 “We review the\n\nSuperior Court’s factual findings to determine ‘whether there was sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the findings and whether those findings were clearly erroneous.’”44\n\n     A.    The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Article I, § 6 of the\n                     Delaware Constitution, and 11 Del. C. § 2307(a)\n\n          The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: “The right of\n\nthe people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable\n\nsearches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon\n\nprobable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to\n\nbe searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”45 The United States Supreme Court\n\nhas observed that “the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is\n\n‘reasonableness[.]’”46\n\n          Similarly, Article I, § 6 of the Delaware Constitution provides: “The people shall\n\nbe secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions, from unreasonable searches\n\n42\n   Bradley v.

Our Founding Fathers Rejected “General Warrants”\n\n       Our nation’s constitutional history and jurisprudence reflects a long-standing\n\nhostility towards general warrants.           General warrants, when employed by the\n\ngovernment, afford officials “blanket authority” to indiscriminately search persons,\n\nhouses, papers, and effects.49 The United States Supreme Court has characterized “the\n\nspecific evil” of the general warrant abhorred by the colonists as “a general, exploratory\n\nrummaging in a person’s belongings.”50 By contrast, a warrant that is simply overly\n\n\n\n\n47\n   Del.

Carrington54 case,\n\nwhere a London publisher successfully sued for trespass after his home was searched\n\npursuant to a general warrant.55\n\n       During the colonial era, the English issued writs of assistance upon mere suspicion\n\nand gave customs officials blanket authority to search where they pleased for smuggled\n\ngoods and evidence of libel in the homes of colonists.56 In 1761, a group of Boston\n\nmerchants, represented by James Otis, Jr., unsuccessfully contested the issuance of new\n\n\n51\n   United States v.

Delaware’s Search and Seizure Protections\n\n       The search and seizure protections in the Delaware Constitution preceded the\n\nadoption of the Fourth Amendment.65 In 1776, Delaware adopted its own constitutional\n\nprotections against general warrants66 and embraced the first search and seize safeguards\n\nfor its citizens.67 The Declaration of Rights and Fundamental Rules of the Delaware\n\nState provided:\n\n       Sect. 17. That all warrants without oath to search suspected places, or to\n       seize any person or his property, are grievous and oppressive; and all\n       general warrants to search suspected places, or to apprehend all persons\n       suspected, without naming or describing the place or any person in special,\n       are illegal and ought not to be granted.68\n\nThis provision was the antecedent to the provision now found in Article I, § 6 of the\n\npresent Delaware Constitution.\n\n       On January 28, 1790, Delaware ratified the Bill of Rights to the United States\n\nConstitution.69 But when Delaware subsequently adopted a new State Constitution in\n\n1792, it closely tracked the language of the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1790.70 In\n\nprevious cases, this Court has held that our Constitution affords our citizens protections\n\n\n\n\nEngland and in the American colonies, to exceed laws which confined governmental powers to\nsearch.”).\n65\n   Id. at 247 (“Delaware’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures predate those\nwhich are provided for in the Fourth Amendment.”); see also Jones v.

The warrant must describe the things to be searched with sufficient\n\nparticularity and be no broader than the probable cause on which it is based.74 “The\n\nmanifest purpose of this particularity requirement [i]s to prevent general searches. By\n\nlimiting the authorization to search to the specific areas and things for which there is\n\nprobable cause to search, the requirement ensures that the search will be carefully tailored\n\n\n\n\n71\n   For instance, we note three cases in which this Court held that our State Constitution provides\nsomewhat broader constitutional protections. First, despite observing that the language of the\nFourth Amendment and Article I, § 6 is “nearly identical,” we have held that “the Delaware\nConstitution provides a greater protection for the individual than the United States Constitution\nin the determination of whether a seizure by the State has occurred.” Flonnory v. State, 805\nA.2d 854, 857 (Del. 2001) (citing Jones, 745 A.2d at 863-64). Second, in Dorsey v. State, this\nCourt held that the “good faith” exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply in Delaware\nbecause “exclusion is the constitutional remedy for a violation of the search and seizure\nprotections set forth in Article I[,] Section 6 of the Delaware Constitution.” Dorsey, 761 A.2d at\n821 (citing Jones, 745 A.2d at 873-74) (citation omitted).

For example, in United States v. Richards,88 the Court of Appeals for the Sixth\n\nCircuit observed that:\n\n       [G]iven the unique problem encountered in computer searches, and the\n       practical difficulties inherent in implementing universal search\n       methodologies, the majority of federal courts have eschewed the use of a\n       specific search protocol and, instead, have employed the Fourth\n       Amendment’s bedrock principle of reasonableness on a case-by-case basis:\n       While officers must be clear as to what it is they are seeking on the\n       computer and conduct the search in a way that avoids searching files of\n       types not identified in the warrant, . . . a computer search may be as\n       extensive as reasonably required to locate the items described in the warrant\n       based on probable cause.89\n\n\n\n\n86\n   See, e.g., Berger v.

Accordingly, the proper metric of sufficient\n\nspecificity is whether it was reasonable to provide a more specific description of the\n\nitems at that juncture of the investigation.90\n\n       Further, the propensity of criminals to disguise files must be balanced against the\n\ncompeting interest of avoiding unrestrained general searches: “It is unrealistic to expect\n\na warrant to prospectively restrict the scope of a search by directory, filename or\n\nextension or to attempt to structure search methods—that process must remain\n\ndynamic.”91 “[I]t is clear that because criminals can—and often do—hide, mislabel, or\n\nmanipulate files to conceal criminal activity, a broad, expansive search of the hard drive\n\nmay be required.”92 Consequently, it would likely unduly restrict law enforcement to\n\nrequire the crafting of specific keyword searches or identification of file names and\n\nextensions ex ante. In some instances, the technological reality may be that, “in the end,\n\nthere may be no practical substitute for actually looking in many (perhaps all) folders and\n\nsometimes at the documents contained within those folders, and that is true whether the\n\n\n\n\n90\n   See, e.g., Christine, 687 F.2d at 760 (“[T]he use of generic classifications in a warrant is\nacceptable when a more precise description is not feasible.”) (citations omitted).\n91\n   Burgess, 576 F.3d at 1093 (“While file or directory names may sometimes alert one to the\ncontents . . ., illegal activity may not be advertised even in the privacy of one’s personal\ncomputer—it could well be coded or otherwise disguised.” (footnote omitted)).\n92\n   Stabile, 633 F.3d at 237 (citing Burgess, 576 F.3d at 1092-94).\n                                                 31\n\fsearch is of computer files or physical files.”93 “[N]o tenet of the Fourth Amendment\n\nprohibits a search merely because it cannot be performed with surgical precision.”94\n\n       This Court has addressed Fourth Amendment challenges in the digital context on\n\ntwo occasions. But in neither case did we confront directly a challenge that a warrant\n\nseeking digital information failed to satisfy the particularity requirement in the United\n\nStates and Delaware Constitutions.\n\n       In the more recent of the cases, Bradley v. State,95 we considered whether the\n\nsearch exceeded the scope of the warrants, but not whether the warrants were\n\nunconstitutionally general. Bradley argued, among other things, that the police exceeded\n\nthe scope of the warrant in executing the instrument and that the supporting affidavit\n\nfailed to establish probable cause that patient files would be found in digital format. This\n\nCourt concluded that “the computers and digital storage devices could reasonably contain\n\nthe patient files described in the warrant, whether in text or image form.”96 Thus, in\n\nBradley, there was no basis for segregating text files from other types of files because\n\nprobable cause allowed for the search of both.\n\n       Likewise, in the earlier case of Fink v. State,97 the State obtained a warrant to\n\nsearch the residence and automobile of the defendant, who was an attorney, for “client\n\nfiles including but not limited to” specifically listed clients and the personal banking\n\n93\n   Burgess, 576 F.3d at 1094; see also Ninety-Two Thousand, 307 F.3d at 150 (suggesting that, in\nsome instances, it may be “necessary to search for and seize all” files when executing a search\nwarrant).\n94\n   Christine, 687 F.2d at 760.\n95\n   51 A.3d 423 (Del. 2012).\n96\n   Id. at 435.\n97\n   817 A.2d 781 (Del. 2003).\n                                              32\n\frecords of the defendant. During the execution of the third of three search warrants, the\n\npolice recovered a computer compact disk and three zip disks, each of which contained\n\nchild pornography. The defendant argued that the warrant lacked sufficient particularity\n\nand that the words, “client files including but not limited to,” were overly broad and\n\nfailed to adequately limit the search to those items for which probable cause had been\n\nestablished. This Court rejected the overbreadth claim, since the defendant’s financial\n\ndealings at issue “effectively opened all his financial records to potential scrutiny by the\n\npolice.”98    Accordingly, we held that “the warrant’s authorized search did not\n\nunreasonably exceed a logical scope of inquiry.”99 However, this Court did not more\n\ndirectly address the permissible scope of warrants seeking digital information.100\n\n       Thus, we consider more directly, for the first time, a challenge to warrants seeking\n\nto seize and search computer-based and digital items on the grounds that they are in the\n\nnature of a general warrant, unconstitutionally overbroad, and lack sufficient\n\nparticularity. We have considered how other courts have addressed similar claims. In\n\n\n\n\n98\n   Id. at 787.\n99\n    Id.; see also United States v. Am. Investors of Pittsburgh, Inc., 879 F.2d 1087, 1105-06 (3d\nCir. 1989) (“The fact that the warrant authorized a search for a large amount of documents and\nrecords does not necessarily render the search invalid so long as there exists a sufficient nexus\nbetween the evidence to be seized and the alleged offenses.”).\n100\n     In Starkey v. State, 2013 WL 4858988 (Del. Sept. 10, 2013), this Court addressed a claim that\nthe search warrants at issue were overbroad, ambiguous, and failed to provide the relevance of\nthe defendant’s “cell phone files” to the alleged crimes. This Court rejected the claim that the\nwarrants were vague since “they specifically limited the officer’s search of the cell phones to\ncertain types of data, media, and files that were ‘pertinent to th[e] investigation.’” Id. at *4. We\nheld that “[t]his language effectively limited the scope of the warrants, and prevented a\nboundless search of the cell phones.” Id. (citing Fink, 817 A.2d at 786).\n                                                33\n\fUnited States v. Riccardi,101 for example, the United States Court of Appeals for the\n\nTenth Circuit considered whether a warrant to seize and examine a defendant’s computer\n\nfailed to satisfy the Fourth Amendment’s particularity requirement. There, the defendant\n\nwas convicted of two counts of possession of child pornography and two counts of use of\n\nan instrumentality of interstate commerce to entice a minor to engage in a prohibited sex\n\nact.\n\n       The Tenth Circuit held that the challenged warrant failed to satisfy the Fourth\n\nAmendment’s particularity requirement. It stated that the warrant “was not limited to any\n\nparticular files, or to any particular federal crime. The warrant authorized the ‘seizure’ of\n\n[the defendant’s] computer”\n\n       and all electronic and magnetic media stored therein, together with all\n       storage devises [sic], internal or external to the computer or computer\n       system, including but not limited to floppy disks, diskettes, hard disks,\n       magnetic tapes, removable media drives, optical media such as CD–ROM,\n       printers, modems, and any other electronic or magnetic devises [sic] used\n       as a peripheral to the computer or computer system, and all electronic\n       media stored within such devises [sic].102\n\nThe Tenth Circuit observed that, “[b]y its terms, the warrant thus permitted the officers to\n\nsearch for anything—from child pornography to tax returns to private correspondence. It\n\nseemed to authorize precisely the kind of ‘wide-ranging exploratory search[] that the\n\nFramers intended to prohibit.’”103 Ultimately, however, the Tenth Circuit affirmed the\n\n\n101\n    405 F.3d 852 (10th Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 919 (2005), petition for reh’g denied,\n546 U.S. 1083 (2005); see also United States v. Galpin, 720 F.3d 436, 448 (2d Cir. 2013)\n(finding that an electronic search warrant related to a registration offense was facially overbroad,\nin part, because it “authorized a search for images depicting child sexual activity”).\n102\n    Riccardi, 405 F.3d at 862.\n103\n    Id. at 863 (quoting Garrison, 480 U.S. at 84).\n                                                34\n\ftrial court’s decision that the evidence seized pursuant to the invalid warrant need not be\n\nsuppressed, on the basis of the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.104\n\n       Recently, in State v. Castagnola,105 the Supreme Court of Ohio considered the\n\napplication of the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment to the search of a\n\ncomputer. There, the initial search warrant related to the crimes of retaliation, criminal\n\ntrespassing, criminal damaging, and possession of criminal tools.106 The warrant sought\n\nthe following:\n\n       Records and documents either stored on computers, ledgers, or any other\n       electronic recording device to include hard drives and external portable\n       hard drives, cell phones, printers, storage devices of any kind, printed out\n       copies of text messages or emails, cameras, video recorders or any photo\n       imaging devices and their storage media to include tapes, compact discs, or\n       flash drives.107\n\nLooking for “evidence of intimidation” on the defendant’s computer, the forensic\n\nexaminer used a software program that “go[es] through documents, images, videos on the\n\nhard drive.”108 The examiner also performed a keyword search that did not yield any\n\nresponsive results, before proceeding to open a tab that maintained “all the images\n\nassociated with the drive being examined.”109 After accessing the tab, the examiner\n\ndiscovered images that she thought were child pornography, stopped her investigation,\n\nand applied for another warrant.     When performing a search based on the second search\n\n104\n    Id. at 863-64.\n105\n    2015 WL 1934723 (Ohio Apr. 28, 2015).\n106\n    Id. at *2.

First, “the language of the search\n\nwarrant did not ‘guide and control’ [the forensic examiner’s] judgment as to what was to\n\nbe seized on the computer[,]” leaving the determination as to what to seize within the\n\ndiscretion of the examiner.113 Second, “the broad language of th[e] search warrant clearly\n\nincluded items that were not subject to seizure[,]” such that the instrument was not as\n\nspecific as “the circumstances and the nature of the activity under investigation permitted\n\n. . . .”114\n\n         The Ohio Supreme Court rejected the idea that the Fourth Amendment required a\n\nsearch warrant to specify restrictive search protocols. But it also recognized “that the\n\nFourth Amendment does prohibit a ‘sweeping comprehensive search of a computer’s\n\n\n\n110\n    Id.\n111\n    Notably, Castagnola involved a single warrant that was first used to search the defendant’s\nhouse in order to seize the computers.

The Witness Tampering Warrants Were General Warrants and Violated the\n                                 Particularity Requirement\n\n       1.       The Witness Tampering Warrants Have No Temporal Limitations, Despite\n                          Relevant Dates Being Available to the Police\n\n            A key principle distilled from the jurisprudence in this area is that warrants, in\n\norder to satisfy the particularity requirement, must describe what investigating officers\n\nbelieve will be found on electronic devices with as much specificity as possible under the\n\ncircumstances. That principle simply was not followed here in several respects. One\n\nobvious respect was the failure to limit the search to the relevant time frame. Federal\n\nCourts of Appeals have concluded that warrants lacking temporal constraints, where\n\nrelevant dates are available to the police, are insufficiently particular.117 Our sister courts\n\n\n115\n    Id. at *18 (citation omitted).\n116\n    Id.\n117\n     See, e.g., United States v. Abboud, 438 F.3d 554, 576 (6th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted)\n(stating that a warrant was overbroad because it “[f]ail[ed] to limit broad descriptive terms by\nrelevant dates, when such dates [were] available to the police”); United States v. Ford, 184 F.3d\n566, 576 (6th Cir. 1999) (citations omitted) (“Failure to limit broad descriptive terms by relevant\ndates, when such dates are available to the police, will render a warrant overbroad.”), cert.\ndenied, 528 U.S. 1161 (2000); United States v. Kow, 58 F.3d 423, 427 (9th Cir. 1995)\n(admonishing the government for failing to “limit the scope of the seizure to a time frame within\nwhich the suspected criminal activity took place, even though . . . [the supporting] affidavit\nindicate[d] that the alleged criminal activity began” at a specified point in time). Cf. United\nStates v. Karrer, 460 F. App’x 157, 161 (3d Cir. 2012) (citing United States v. Yusuf, 461 F.3d\n374, 395 (3d Cir. 2006)) (concluding that a warrant was not a general warrant, as it “sufficiently\n                                                37\n\fhave similarly considered temporal restrictions in the context of the particularity\n\nrequirement.118 Ultimately, “[i]t is settled law that generic classifications in a warrant are\n\nacceptable only when a more precise description is not possible.”119\n\n       We hesitate to prescribe rigid rules and instead reiterate that warrants must\n\ndesignate the things to be searched and seized as particularly as possible. Striking the\n\ncorrect balance when protecting against generality and overbreadth requires vigilance on\n\nthe part of judicial officers who are on the front lines of preserving constitutional rights\n\nwhile assisting government officials in the legitimate pursuit of prosecuting criminal\n\nactivity.   Where, as here, the investigators had available to them a more precise\n\ndescription of the alleged criminal activity that is the subject of the warrant, such\n\ninformation should be included in the instrument and the search and seizure should be\n\n\n\n\nidentified a time period during which the suspected offenses occurred”). But compare Ninety-\nTwo Thousand, 307 F.3d at 151 (Alito, J.) (“At most, the lack of time restrictions meant that the\nwarrant was overly broad, not general. . . . In any event, the absence from the warrant of a\nprovision limiting the search and seizure to documents pertaining to the time period of the\nscheme did not make the warrant ‘so facially deficient’ ‘as to render official belief in its\n[legality] entirely unreasonable.’”) (internal citation omitted) (alteration in original), with id. at\n156 (Ambro, J., dissenting) (arguing that failure to limit the temporal scope of a warrant, when\nrelevant dates are available to the police, is a “deficiency” that underlies an “unconstitutionally\nbroad warrant”) (citing Ford, 184 F.3d at 576).\n118\n    See, e.g., In re Search Warrant, 71 A.3d at 1183-84 (observing that a magistrate may properly\nrestrict law enforcement’s search to items that meet certain parameters based on, inter alia, dates\nand “the known details of the suspected crime such as the time-period”); Commonwealth v.\nMcDermott, 864 N.E.2d 471, 487 (Mass. 2007) (rejecting an argument that a warrant was\noverbroad where the challenged category of items was limited both in time frame and in the\nnature of the items that could be seized), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 910 (2007).\n119\n    United States v. Bright, 630 F.2d 804, 812 (5th Cir. 1980) (citing James v. United States, 416\nF.2d 467, 473 (5th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 907 (1970)).\n                                                 38\n\fappropriately narrowed to the relevant time period so as to mitigate the potential for\n\nunconstitutional exploratory rummaging.120\n\n       The State conceded that nothing relating to NK would be found on Wheeler’s\n\nproperty identified in the Witness Tampering Warrants. And the Affidavits do not\n\nsuggest otherwise. As to the only other potential victims, the W brothers, the Affidavits\n\nindicate that the alleged witness tampering occurred, if it did, in or after July 2013, since\n\nthat was when the W brothers renewed contact with Wheeler.121 The Affidavits contain\n\nno facts suggesting that any tampering might have occurred prior to July 2013. Yet, the\n\nWitness Tampering Warrants were boundless as to time. Sergeant Perna testified that\n\none of the first things he did in executing the search was determine when the iMac was\n\nlast used. Proceeding under the Witness Tampering Warrants, he determined that the\n\ncomputer had last been powered on in September 2012.                  However, the State\n\nunsystematically sifted through Wheeler’s digital universe, even though the iMac\n\nlogically could not have contained material created or recorded during the relevant time\n\nperiod.\n\n       A failure to describe the items to be searched for and seized with as much\n\nparticularity as the circumstances reasonably allow offends the constitutional protections\n\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures. Because the State was able to more precisely\n\ndescribe the items to be searched and seized, the Witness Tampering Warrants violated\n\nthe particularity requirement.\n\n120\n  See id.; Ford, 184 F.3d at 576.\n121\n   The State also conceded at oral argument before this Court that the relevant time period\ncommenced in 2013. See Oral Argument at 40:37.\n                                             39\n\f  2.     The Witness Tampering Warrants Likely Fail the Particularity Requirement for\n                                  Other Reasons\n\n       The Witness Tampering Warrants likely fail the particularity requirement in other\n\nrespects. For example, nothing in the Affidavits supports an inference that evidence may\n\nbe found on DVDs or optical cameras. The Affidavits do not allege that Wheeler was\n\ncommunicating with NK or any of the W brothers through videos or pictures. Nor do the\n\nAffidavits link witness tampering to these types of media. The likely reason that the\n\nWitness Tampering Warrants sought the search for and seizure of devices and items that\n\ncannot lead to evidence of witness tampering based on the Affidavits is that, as the State\n\nconceded, the language was essentially copied and pasted from a search warrant for child\n\npornography.      Although the parties agree that cutting and pasting search warrant\n\nlanguage does not automatically invalidate the resulting instrument, that technique has\n\nled, in the context of this case, to search warrants that do not satisfy the particularity\n\nrequirement.122\n\n       Further, the Affidavits recite that the State was searching for “evidence of written\n\ncommunications,” which it believed were relevant to the alleged witness tampering.\n\nSergeant Perna wrote in his forensic report and testified that he was “looking for any files\n\ncreated and/or saved as word documents, emails, text messages, pdf [sic] or any other\n\n\n\n\n122\n   Cf. Massachusetts v. Sheppard, 468 U.S. 981, 986-91 (1984) (scrutinizing police use of a\nform warrant pertaining to an unrelated crime and indicating that it might be insufficiently\nparticular, but ultimately upholding the search based upon the good faith exception to the\nexclusionary rule notwithstanding the defect). As noted above, the good faith exception to the\nexclusionary rule is not recognized in Delaware. See Dorsey, 761 A.2d at 820-21.\n                                             40\n\frelated file format.”123 The portions of the Affidavits discussing the items sought refer to\n\nwritten communications.124 These observations suggest that the items for which there\n\nwas probable cause to search and seize were written communications—not DVDs and\n\n\n123\n   A191 (Tr. 38:10-19).\n124\n    At oral argument before this Court, the State asserted that it was not relying on incorporation\nof the Affidavits into the Witness Tampering Warrants for the latter to satisfy the particularity\nrequirement. Oral Argument at 31:50. In Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551 (2004), the United\nStates Supreme Court observed that, although supporting documentation adequately describes\nthe things to be searched for and seized, such description does not necessarily save a warrant\nfrom its facial invalidity. Id. at 557. The Supreme Court noted that: “The Fourth Amendment\nby its terms requires particularity in the warrant, not in the supporting documents.” Id. (citations\nomitted) (emphasis added). It also stated the following: “We do not say that the Fourth\nAmendment prohibits a warrant from cross-referencing other documents. Indeed, most [Federal]\nCourts of Appeals have held that a court may construe a warrant with reference to a supporting\napplication or affidavit if the warrant uses appropriate words of incorporation, and if the\nsupporting document accompanies the warrant.” Id. at 557-58 (citations omitted).\n         Some Federal Courts of Appeals have limited Groh’s import to establishing that an\nunconstitutional warrant can be saved by its supporting documentation only if the warrant\nappropriately references the supporting document through “clear” language of incorporation and\nthe supporting document accompanies the warrant. See, e.g., United States v. Perez, 2015 WL\n6405695, at *3 (6th Cir. Oct. 23, 2015) (citing Groh, 540 U.S. at 557-58); Tracey, 597 F.3d at\n146-48 (citations omitted) (“Along with other Courts of Appeals, we have held that an affidavit\nmay be used in determining the scope of a warrant that lacks particularity if the warrant is\n‘accompanied by an affidavit that is incorporated by reference.’”); United States v. Waker, 534\nF.3d 168, 172-73 (2d Cir. 2008). Others have held that, for an unconstitutional warrant to be\ncured through incorporation by reference to an affidavit, the affidavit must not be filed under\nseal. See, e.g., Bartholomew v. Pennsylvania, 221 F.3d 425, 429-30 (3d Cir. 2000) (“We now\nmake clear . . . and hold that, generally speaking, where the list of items to be seized does not\nappear on the face of the warrant, sealing that list, even though it is ‘incorporated’ in the warrant,\nwould violate the Fourth Amendment.”). Here, the Applications and Affidavits indicate that they\nwere filed under seal.\n         Although the Witness Tampering Warrants, under “ITEMS TO BE SEARCHED FOR\nAND SEIZED[,]” state in paragraph 1, “[e]nter and search the residence [or office] as\ncompletely described herein [sic] the application and affidavit for evidence of the\naforementioned crime(s)[,]” it is not clear that the broad lists of items in the Witness Tampering\nWarrants are necessarily limited by the Affidavits and, if so, in what fashion. A19 (Warrant 1 ¶\n1); A31 (Warrant 2 ¶ 1). This is true particularly in view of the fact that the Affidavits contain\nsweeping, boilerplate language concerning digital data and the ability of forensic experts to\nrecover it for lengthy periods of time, including “years after it [i]s written.” Thus, even\nassuming, arguendo, that the Affidavits are fairly incorporated, they fail to cure the\nconstitutional defects, as they lack temporal restraints as to all potential victims and fail to guide\nthe executing officers as to the limits of the search and seizure.\n                                                 41\n\foptical cameras. Yet, by their terms, the Witness Tampering Warrants permitted the\n\nState to search for anything—from child pornography to medical records to consumer\n\ninformation to tax returns.         In short, they permitted the species of wide-ranging,\n\nexploratory searches the Framers intended to prohibit. Because the lack of temporal\n\nlimitations is sufficient to invalidate the Witness Tampering Warrants, we need not reach\n\nthese other potential substantive challenges.          Instead, we caution that the risk that\n\nwarrants for digital and electronic devices take on the character of “general warrants” is\n\nsubstantial. This reality necessitates heightened vigilance, at the outset, on the part of\n\njudicial officers to guard against unjustified invasions of privacy.\n\n                                     III.   CONCLUSION\n\n          The subject of this prosecution is an unsympathetic figure.           And the sexual\n\nexploitation of children is a dreadful scourge in our society. But “[t]he principles laid\n\ndown in this [O]pinion affect the very essence of constitutional liberty and security.\n\nThey reach further than the concrete form of the case before the court . . .; they apply to\n\nall invasions on the part of the government and its employe[e]s of the sanctity of a\n\n[person’s] home and the privacies of life.”125 “There is always a temptation in criminal\n\ncases to let the end justify the means, but as guardians of the Constitution, we must resist\n\nthat temptation.”126\n\n          The United States Constitution and the Delaware Constitution both mandate that\n\nthe decision of the Superior Court with respect to the Motion to Suppress be reversed.\n\n\n125\n      Boyd, 116 U.S. at 630.\n126\n      Castagnola, 2015 WL 1934723, at *20 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n                                                 42\n\fAccordingly, the judgments of conviction are REVERSED.

REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\nThomas A. Foley, Esquire, Wilmington, Delaware for Appellant.\n\nAndrew J. Vella, Esquire, Department of Justice, Wilmington, Delaware for Appellee.\n\n\n\n\nVALIHURA, Justice:\n\f       In this direct appeal, Christopher Wheeler (“Wheeler”) seeks to overturn his\n\nconviction of Dealing in Child Pornography. He raises two issues. First, he challenges\n\na September 18, 2014 decision of the Superior Court denying his Amended and\n\nSuperseding Motion to Suppress (“Motion to Suppress”). The Motion to Suppress sought\n\nto exclude evidence collected from Wheeler’s home and office during a search executed\n\npursuant to two warrants related to witness tampering. The challenged warrants covered\n\nWheeler’s entire digital universe and essentially had no limitations. In performing the\n\nsearch, officers seized 19 electronic devices and other digital media. Despite the broad,\n\ngeneralized language in the challenged warrants, the State found no evidence of witness\n\ntampering on any of Wheeler’s devices. But when performing a cursory search of the\n\ndata on an iMac found in Wheeler’s piano room closet (the “iMac”), police discovered\n\nfiles containing child pornography. Wheeler contends that the search warrants were in\n\nthe nature of “general warrants” and were overly broad in scope, in violation of the\n\nFourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, § 6 of the Delaware\n\nConstitution.1\n\n       Second, Wheeler appeals from a December 22, 2014 decision of the Superior\n\nCourt denying his Motion to Dismiss and/or for Judgment of Acquittal (“Motion for\n\nJudgment of Acquittal”). Wheeler was charged with 25 identical counts of Dealing in\n\nChild Pornography based upon 25 images of child sexual exploitation—all of which were\n\nfound on the iMac. Wheeler argues that there was insufficient evidence to convict him\n\n\n1\n  Wheeler is joined by amicus curiae, American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Delaware\n(the “ACLU”), which filed a brief in support of reversal.\n                                            1\n\fbecause the State could not establish that he was aware of the existence of the offending\n\nimages in his “newsgroup cache.” The State admits it has no proof that Wheeler ever\n\nviewed any of the images, which automatically “cached” on his computer, with no human\n\nintervention, as a result of his subscription to certain “newsgroups.”        Wheeler was\n\nsentenced to 50 years at Level V.\n\n       Throughout these proceedings, Wheeler has asserted that the State utilized charges\n\nof witness tampering stemming from his admission in 2013 that he had molested two\n\nbrothers in Pennsylvania in the 1980’s as a pretext to search broadly for child\n\npornography. The challenged warrants in this case are the witness tampering warrants—\n\nnot the later-obtained child pornography warrant.         But the State admits that the\n\nchallenged witness tampering warrants were virtual copies of an off-the-shelf warrant for\n\nchild pornography.\n\n       Because we agree that the challenged witness tampering warrants were in the\n\nnature of “general warrants” in violation of the United States and Delaware Constitutions,\n\nwe reverse the judgments of the Superior Court and remand this matter for further\n\nproceedings in accordance with this Opinion.\n\n                                      I.     FACTS\n\n                               A.     Christopher Wheeler\n\n       Christopher Wheeler is the former headmaster at the Tower Hill School (“Tower\n\nHill”) in Wilmington, Delaware. He has an adult son, NK,2 whom he adopted when NK\n\n\n2\n Because the victims in this matter were juveniles at the time they were subject to abuse, we\nhave assigned pseudonyms sua sponte.\n                                             2\n\fwas twelve or thirteen.3 In the 1980’s, Wheeler lived with the “W” family in West\n\nChester, Pennsylvania for months at a time. The Ws took in a number of students that\n\nattended the Westtown School, where the three W brothers went to school.4 Wheeler was\n\none of these students. Wheeler was approximately 16 or 17 when he began living with\n\nthe Ws. Even after he left Westtown School, Wheeler maintained a relationship with the\n\nW family.\n\n          Approximately 35 years ago, Wheeler sexually abused two of the W brothers. In\n\n2005, Wheeler returned to the Delaware area after having spent time in Illinois with his\n\nadopted son. Wheeler became the headmaster of Tower Hill. In 2008, Wheeler and NK\n\nlived with the Ws before moving onto the Tower Hill campus.\n\n    B.     In 2013, the W Brothers Confront Wheeler About the Abuse Wheeler Inflicted\n                               on Them in the Early 1980’s\n\n          After the Jerry Sandusky scandal broke, one of the W brothers, MW, resolved to\n\ntell his two adult brothers, SW and TW, that Wheeler had molested him when he was\n\napproximately 11 to 13 years old, at a time when Wheeler was in his early-20’s. Upon\n\nhearing this, SW told his brothers that Wheeler had also molested him when he was\n\napproximately 13 to 15 years old. TW told MW and SW that, although Wheeler had\n\nnever physically or sexually abused him, Wheeler had inappropriate sexual conversations\n\nwith TW when TW was a boy.\n\n          After the W brothers told each other about their past experiences with Wheeler,\n\nMW wrote Wheeler a letter. The letter read, in part: “I shudder at the notion that you, in\n\n3\n    A27 (Affidavit 1 ¶ 6).\n4\n    A135.\n                                             3\n\fyour career, have chosen an environment that brings you into daily contact with other\n\nboys who are as old as I was when you molested me.”5 MW’s letter also provided that\n\nMW “wants nothing to do with Chris Wheeler ever and wants him to stay away from him\n\nand his family.”6 MW supplied Investigator Robert Schreiber (“Investigator Schreiber”)\n\nof the Delaware Department of Justice with a copy of the letter.\n\n       On July 20, 2013, SW also wrote Wheeler. MW provided Investigator Schreiber\n\nwith a “draft” of SW’s letter. Unlike MW’s letter, SW’s three-page letter invited a\n\nresponse from Wheeler. It read, in part:\n\n       If I had known the torment, pain, humiliation, and anger that your\n       molestation and abuse of me as a child would cause me these 35 years later,\n       I would have had greater strength to stand up to you and defend myself.\n       The fact that you preyed upon me in my own home, from the room next to\n       mine, is lewd and inexcusable. The reality that you continue to shirk any\n       responsibility for the harm that you caused, as if it never occurred, will\n       continue no longer.7\n\n                                           *       *   *\n\n       I will not keep quiet and hide from your abuses any longer. I have not yet\n       determined how or when to tell my parents of the harm, pain, and\n       humiliation that you have caused. . . . The real and full truth must be told\n       and brought to light; beginning now.\n\n       The only thing that I am sorry for is that it has taken me this long to gain\n       the fortitude to bring your past abuses to the surface, to move towards\n       holding you accountable for your predatory and abusive actions. Despite\n       my pain and anger, I am curious to return part of the burden to you; what\n       does justice look like for Chris Wheeler for the molestation you\n       perpetuated, culpability you willingly evade, and the harms that you\n\n\n\n5\n  A27 (Affidavit 1 ¶ 10).\n6\n  Id.\n7\n  A130.\n                                               4\n\f         continue to cause? What role (if any) should you play in determining\n         appropriate resolution to and restitution for the abuses you have caused?8\n\n         On July 23, 2013, Wheeler responded to SW’s letter. In his reply letter, Wheeler\n\nadmits his wrongdoing. It reads, in part:\n\n         I will not compound your pain by attempting to deny or in any way deflect\n         responsibility for my actions 35 years ago. I did those things. I am the one\n         responsible.\n\n         I am profoundly sorry. Some things are unforgivable, so I don’t expect\n         forgiveness from any of you. Nevertheless, I ask for your forgiveness.\n\n                                            *       *      *\n\n         The truth is that I have carried inside of me a profound and loud\n         dissonance, an ever-present reminder that some evil has been done and it\n         cannot be undone. And I am responsible for it.\n\n                                            *       *      *\n\n         You hoped for proof of my conscience, my contrition, my sense of\n         accountability. Only you know if you see proof of those things in this\n         letter. Regarding my compunction to make right the many wrongs that I\n         have committed, perhaps this letter is evidence of at least a few steps in that\n         direction as well. I’ll wait to hear from you about further appropriate steps\n         towards resolution and restitution.9\n\n         MW provided the investigators with a copy of Wheeler’s response. SW told\n\ninvestigators that he still had Wheeler’s original response letter and the corresponding\n\nFedEx envelope in his possession.\n\n         Rather than writing a letter, TW held telephone conversations with Wheeler to\n\narrange a face-to-face meeting at Wheeler’s home on July 25, 2013. TW also exchanged\n\ne-mails with Wheeler, who used his Tower Hill e-mail address. According to TW, at the\n\n8\n    A130-32 (emphasis added).\n9\n    A133 (emphasis added).\n                                                5\n\fmeeting, Wheeler apologized for his previous actions and told TW that he was going to\n\nmeet with NK to tell him about his abuse of the W brothers. Wheeler also told TW that\n\nhe had recently contemplated suicide.\n\nC.     The Witness Tampering Warrants Target Wheeler’s Entire Digital Universe and\n               are Cut-and-Pasted from Child Pornography Warrants\n\n       On October 22, 2013, the Wilmington Police Department, working in concert with\n\nthe State of Delaware, sought and obtained two search warrants from the Superior Court.\n\nThe first search warrant (“Warrant 1”) related to Wheeler’s residence in Wilmington,\n\nDelaware and his 2011 Chevrolet Equinox. The second warrant (“Warrant 2” and jointly\n\nwith Warrant 1, the “Witness Tampering Warrants”) was for Wheeler’s office at Tower\n\nHill and for the same vehicle.\n\n       The Witness Tampering Warrants were substantially similar and were each\n\nsupported by a corresponding affidavit of probable cause.10 The Witness Tampering\n\nWarrants and Affidavits together sought to gather evidence related to two witness\n\ntampering crimes: (1) Tampering with a Witness under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Del.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. § 1263(3); and (2) Act\n\nof Intimidation of a Witness under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Del.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. § 3532. The affiants were Detective\n\nCecilia E. Ashe (“Detective Ashe”) and Chief Investigator Robert J. Irwin (“Chief\n\nInvestigator Irwin”).    On the date the Witness Tampering Warrants were issued,\n\nDetective Ashe was an officer with the Wilmington Police Department.                   Chief\n\n\n10\n  For purposes of this Opinion, Warrant 1’s affidavit of probable cause is referred to as\n“Affidavit 1.” Warrant 2’s affidavit of probable cause is referred to as “Affidavit 2.”\nCollectively, Affidavit 1 and Affidavit 2 are referred to as the “Affidavits.” Similarly, the\napplications in support of the Witness Tampering Warrants are collectively referred to as the\n“Applications.”\n                                             6\n\fInvestigator Irwin was with the Delaware Department of Justice and, at the time, was\n\nassigned to the Child Predator Task Force. Investigator Schreiber is also mentioned\n\nthroughout the Affidavits, as he provided information to Detective Ashe and Chief\n\nInvestigator Irwin.\n\n       The Affidavits are based in large part on interviews with the W brothers, and\n\nincorporate the brothers’ statements regarding communications they had with Wheeler in\n\nJuly 2013. The police also interviewed MW’s wife and the W brothers’ parents. As to\n\nNK, the sum of the witness tampering allegations contained in the Affidavits is that an\n\nofficer of the Bluffton Police Department in Bluffton, South Carolina told Investigator\n\nSchreiber that, while investigating an incident at NK’s South Carolina residence, NK\n\ninformed him that Wheeler would “penetrate his anus and that [NK] never previously\n\nreported this to the authorities because [Wheeler] would pay him off.”11 The Affidavits\n\nsuggest that this took place in Illinois, but provide no other details regarding Wheeler’s\n\nalleged tampering with NK.\n\n       The Affidavits state that MW spoke with authorities during the week of October\n\n14, 2013. MW told personnel in the Department of Justice that approximately 35 years\n\nago, when he was 12 or 13 years old, Wheeler molested him. At the time, Wheeler was\n\n22 or 23 years old. MW also stated that Wheeler molested SW when SW was a boy.12\n\n\n\n\n11\n  A28 (Affidavit 1 ¶ 20).\n12\n  A26 (Affidavit 1 ¶ 2). SW told Investigator Schreiber that Wheeler molested him when he\nwas approximately 13 to 15 years old. A28 (Affidavit 1 ¶ 15). SW stated that “the sexual abuse\ntook place multiple times over a period of months, possibly for a year.” A28 (Affidavit 1 ¶ 15).\n                                               7\n\fMW advised that the sexual abuse took place when Wheeler lived at the W family\n\nresidence in West Chester, Pennsylvania.\n\n      The Affidavits refer to and quote from the italicized portions of the letters in the\n\nprevious section. The Affidavits also recount that the W brothers decided to confront\n\nWheeler about the abuse he had inflicted upon them. The first communication from the\n\nW brothers to Wheeler occurred in July 2013.\n\n      According to the Affidavits, in July 2013, MW sent a letter to Wheeler,\n\nconfronting him about what had happened. TW also confronted Wheeler in a face-to-\n\nface meeting in Wilmington, Delaware. On October 22, 2013, TW told Investigator\n\nSchreiber, according to the Affidavits, that he and Wheeler “communicated via telephone\n\nand e-mail using [Wheeler’s] Tower Hill [e]-[m]ail address to coordinate a meeting in\n\nWilmington and then to communicate since.”\n\n      The Affidavits provide that NK complained about Wheeler to MW’s mother when\n\nvisiting her home in West Chester, Pennsylvania. During a visit, NK “stated that his\n\nfather had abused him[,]” according to the Affidavits. When MW’s mother asked NK\n\nwhat he meant, NK responded: “You know. You know.”\n\n      According to the Affidavits, on October 22, 2013, Investigator Schreiber contacted\n\nOfficer Anson Singleton of the Bluffton Police Department. The Affidavits then recite\n\nthe following: “Officer Singleton stated that while investigating the incident at [NK’s]\n\nresidence, [NK] told him that his dad would penetrate his anus and that he never\n\npreviously reported this to the authorities because his father would pay him off. When\n\nthe officer asked [NK] where this occurred, [NK] said it occurred when they lived in\n\n                                           8\n\fIllinois.” The Affidavits did not provide a time frame as to when these events allegedly\n\noccurred.\n\n       The first three sections of the Affidavits set forth the background of the affiants\n\n(“Section A”), “Terms and Definitions” (“Section B”), and “Issues of Staleness\n\nAssociated with [C]omputer [I]nvestigations” (“Section C”). Sections A and B highlight\n\nthe extensive background of Chief Investigator Irwin in the area of crimes against\n\nchildren, and generally describe electronic data, electronic filing systems, hard drives,\n\nstorage media, and Internet and local networks. The broad, sweeping “staleness” section,\n\ncomprised of five paragraphs, emphasizes that digital data can often be forensically\n\nrecovered “years after it [i]s written.”13\n\n       Against the backdrop of this boilerplate language, which underscores technology’s\n\ncapacity to preserve digital data for lengthy periods of time and the ability of forensic\n\nexperts to recover it, the concluding paragraphs of the Affidavits recite the history and\n\nfacts underlying the complaint (“Section D”). The concluding paragraphs of Section D\n\nrefer to documents, e-mails, and “other electronically stored communications,” and state\n\nthat cellular phones may contain evidence, including text messages and e-mails.\n\nAlthough the investigators had copies of the letters referenced above, the Affidavits state\n\nthat “there may be evidence of written communications at the residence and the personal\n\nwork place [sic] of the subject” and that “[w]ritten communications were sent to the\n\n13\n   Section C also states that, “[w]ith the advent of larger capacity hard-drives, removable media,\nand CD/DVD burners over the past several years, the retention and therefore recovery of, data\nfrom digital media has greatly increased.” A25. With respect to DVDs and CDs, Section C\nobserves that “[t]he data stored on them is highly stable and not usually subject to corruption\nbarring physical damage to the media itself.” A25-26.\n                                                9\n\fvictims . . . .” The affiant averred that “evidence of this correspondence may be envelope\n\n[sic], letters, address books and handwritten notes.”\n\n       Later on October 22, 2013, the Wilmington Police Department and the State of\n\nDelaware obtained the Witness Tampering Warrants.14\n\n       Despite mention of written communications in the Affidavits, the Witness\n\nTampering Warrants listed, under “ITEMS TO BE SEARCHED FOR AND SEIZED[,]”\n\nthe following broad categories of items:\n\n       2. Search the following location within the residence described herein the\n          application and affidavit [sic] to include but not limited to: locked or unlocked\n          safes, boxes, bags, compartments, storage areas or things in the nature thereof,\n          found in or upon said residence that could be used to contain evidence[.]\n\n       3. Any personal computer, computer system, device or component to include\n          desktop(s), laptop(s), notebook(s), PDA(s), or tower style systems capable of\n          storing, retrieving, and/or processing magnetic, digital or optical data and in\n          particular any such devices capable of connecting to or communicating with\n          the Internet or Internet Service Providers by any means including dial-up,\n          broadband, or wireless services.\n\n       4. Any digital or optical data storage device connected to, capable of being\n          connected to, read by, or capable of being read by, any item described in\n          paragraph 4, to include: internal or external hard drives (found within or\n          without any item seized pursuant to paragraph 4), mass storage devices, pen\n          drives, smart cards, compact disks(CD), compact disk – recordable (CD R) or\n          re-writable (CD RW), floppy diskettes, DVD+/- R or RW, or any other such\n          device that stores digital data optically, electronically, or magnetically.\n\n       5. Any cellular telephone, to include the registry entries, call logs, pictures, video\n          recordings[,] text messages, user names, buddy lists, screen names, telephone\n          numbers, writings or other digital material as it relates to this investigation.\n\n\n\n14\n   The Applications, with respect to the items to be searched for and seized, are substantially\nsimilar to the Witness Tampering Warrants. Compare A19, with A21-22. Compare A31, with\nA33-34.\n                                              10\n\f         6. Any digital camera, digital video camera, optical camera, optical video camera,\n            cell phone, or other device capable of capturing and storing to any media,\n            photographs or images and the associated media there from [sic].\n\n         7. Any and all data, and the forensic examination thereof, stored by whatever\n            means on any items seized pursuant to paragraphs 4, 5, and 6, as described\n            above to include but not limited to: registry entries, pictures, images,\n            temporary internet files, internet history files, chat logs, writings, passwords,\n            user names, buddy names, screen names, email, connection logs, or other\n            evidence.\n\n         8. Any file, writing, log, artifact, paper, document, billing record or other\n            instrument, stored electronically or in printed form, which relates to or\n            references the owner of items seized pursuant to paragraphs [] 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n            and 8, as described above.15\n\n         After reviewing the Affidavits, a Superior Court judge (the “Issuing Judge”)\n\ndetermined that there was probable cause for a search and seizure of Wheeler’s property.\n\nThe Witness Tampering Warrants were then issued.\n\n                                D.     The Search and Seizure\n\n         During the evening of October 22, 2013, law enforcement officers executed the\n\nwarrants for Wheeler’s home and office at Tower Hill.               The team seized several\n\ncomputers and other electronic devices, including: (1) two iMacs; (2) a Mac PowerBook\n\nG4; (3) two external hard drives; (4) two iPhones; (5) a Tungsten Palm; (6) an iPad; (7) a\n\nMacBook Pro; (8) 26 CDs; and (9) 23 DVDs.\n\n         After the Witness Tampering Warrants were executed, Sergeant Kevin Perna of\n\nthe Delaware State Police Department (“Sergeant Perna”)—a forensic examiner who, at\n\nthe time, had performed nearly 500 forensic examinations and taught classes related to\n\nthe subject at a local law school and the Delaware police academy—conducted a forensic\n\n15\n     A19 (Warrant 1 ¶¶ 2-8) (emphasis added); A31 (Warrant 2 ¶¶ 2-8) (emphasis added).\n                                               11\n\fsearch of the seized devices using EnCase. This was his first forensic examination using\n\nEnCase, a software program utilized by law enforcement to forensically examine\n\ncomputers and other electronics. Using this software, a forensic examiner can perform\n\nkeyword searches, access files that a standard computer search would not uncover, and\n\nview “all the contents on [a] hard drive . . . .”16\n\n       Despite orders from Chief Investigator Irwin that directed Sergeant Perna to\n\nsearch for “text-type” documents, Sergeant Perna’s forensic evaluation of Wheeler’s data\n\ncaptured “image files” and “video files.”17 Sergeant Perna acknowledged that video and\n\nimage files were not implicated in the context of this case and were not subsumed within\n\nhis “more restrictive” marching orders from Chief Investigator Irwin.18\n\n       Sergeant Perna also acknowledged that the EnCase software enabled him to filter\n\nWheeler’s data by limiting the search results to certain file extensions, such as .doc, .text,\n\n.pdf, which were among the items he was seeking, and that he could have removed image\n\nand movie video files. He testified as follows:\n\n       Q.      . . . So had you put those kind of conditions [sic] in, it would have\n       restricted the files that would have popped up and you would not have seen\n       video or image files; correct?\n\n       A.      Yes.19\n\nInstead of restricting his search, Sergeant Perna performed a review of the “folder\n\nstructure” on the iMac, including the “Desktop” folder, which enabled him to review all\n\n\n16\n   A185 (Tr. 14:3-6).\n17\n   See A194 (Tr. 47:6-8).\n18\n   A193 (Tr. 43:10-13); A194 (Tr. 47:16-23).\n19\n   A194 (Tr. 48:10-14).\n                                               12\n\fof Wheeler’s digital files. He stated that he prefers to “see all of the files, . . . [so that he\n\ncan] find the ones that are pertinent and things that are not pertinent.”20 This cursory\n\nsearch of the files on the hard drive of the iMac occurred while Sergeant Perna ran a\n\nkeyword search using the terms “witness intimidation” and “witness tampering.” During\n\nthis cursory review, he found files that appeared to be video files. Because these files—\n\nlabeled “GERBYS II” and “hippodrome boys large”—seemed suspicious, Sergeant Perna\n\nasked Detective Scott Garland (“Detective Garland”) if he was familiar with them.\n\nDetective Garland explained that these titles were related to child pornography.\n\n       Based upon Sergeant Perna’s discovery of these two files, on October 29, 2013,\n\nthe State obtained an additional search warrant from the Kent County Superior Court to\n\nsearch previously seized devices for child pornography (the “Child Pornography\n\nWarrant”).21 The Child Pornography Warrant authorized the search and seizure of digital\n\ndevices the investigators already had in their custody.22 The State did not open the video\n\nfiles until it obtained the Child Pornography Warrant.23 After viewing the files, the State\n\nsought and obtained an indictment against Wheeler on charges of Dealing in Child\n\nPornography under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Del.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. § 1109(4).\n\n                                    E.      The Indictment\n\n20\n   A197 (Tr. 62:19-21).\n21\n   On October 23, 2013, a separate search warrant was obtained for Wheeler’s 2011 Chevrolet\nTahoe. On October 25, 2013, the State also obtained a search warrant for Wheeler’s airplane.\n22\n   The application for the Child Pornography Warrant contained a broad “catch-all” provision\nthat was nearly identical to the catch-all provision in the Witness Tampering Warrants, all of\nwhich permitted the search, seizure, and forensic examination of “[a]ny and all data” on\nWheeler’s devices.\n23\n   Wheeler correctly maintains that, if his challenge to the Witness Tampering Warrants is\nsuccessful, all evidence seized and recovered thereafter represents “fruit of the poisonous tree.”\n                                               13\n\f        On December 9, 2013, a Grand Jury returned an indictment against Wheeler.

In relevant part, the statute provides:\n\n        A person is guilty of dealing in child pornography when: . . . (4) The\n        person, intentionally compiles, enters, accesses, transmits, receives,\n        exchanges, disseminates, stores, makes, prints, reproduces or otherwise\n        possesses any photograph, image, file, data or other visual depiction of a\n        child engaging in a prohibited sexual act or in the simulation of such an\n        act.24\n\n        Of the 19 devices seized from Wheeler’s home and office, three contained images\n\nof child pornography. The indictment was based upon 25 images recovered from the\n\nnewsgroup cache on Wheeler’s iMac. The iMac itself had not been turned on since\n\nSeptember 29, 2012.25 Of the 25 images of child pornography, only one was cached after\n\n2009. Specifically, one image was cached on September 2, 2005, one image was cached\n\non January 1, 2010, and the remaining images were cached between July and September\n\n2009.\n\n                               F.     The Motion to Suppress\n\n        On May 5, 2014, Wheeler filed the Motion to Suppress. On May 23, 2014, the\n\nSuperior Court held a hearing on the Motion to Suppress. The State presented the\n\ntestimony of Sergeant Perna. Wheeler presented testimony from his expert witness, Tami\n\nL. Loehrs (“Loehrs”). Sergeant Perna testified that he was looking for evidence of\n\nwitness tampering and witness intimidation, particularly in the form of “text-type”\n\n24\n  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Del.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. § 1109(4).\n25\n   A245 (Tr. 49:5-10). As Sergeant Perna testified, the forensic significance of the date of last\naccess merely signified the date on which the computer was last powered on, and it did not\nreflect that any newsgroup or newsreader was accessed on that date. A245 (Tr. 49:11-17).\n                                               14\n\fdocuments. On cross-examination, he agreed that the Witness Tampering Warrants’ lists\n\nof items to be searched for and seized were “almost virtually identical to exactly the list\n\n[one] would see in a child pornography case.”           He also agreed that the Witness\n\nTampering Warrants essentially had no limitations and that the warrants, on their face,\n\nwere “wide open.”\n\n       The Superior Court heard final arguments from the parties on the Motion to\n\nSuppress on July 11, 2014. The State, again, conceded that the substance of the Witness\n\nTampering Warrants “could be viewed as a cut-and-paste from a [warrant related to]\n\nchild porn[.]”26 Further, at oral argument before this Court, the State conceded that the\n\nWitness Tampering Warrants did not contain “anything particularized from the evidence\n\nthat they were . . . searching.”27\n\n       On September 18, 2014, the Superior Court issued its Opinion denying Wheeler’s\n\nMotion to Suppress.28 The Superior Court did not explicitly address the issue of whether\n\nthe Witness Tampering Warrants were general warrants in violation of the Fourth\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, Article I, § 6 of the Delaware Constitution,\n\nand </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Del.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. § 2307(a).\n\n                                     G.

The parties stipulated\n\nto the facts that Wheeler was the sole user of each of the seized devices and that each of\n\nthe 25 images at issue constituted child pornography under Delaware law. Wheeler did\n\nnot take the stand in his defense, and the sole witness at trial was Sergeant Perna.\n\nHowever, since becoming EnCase certified in 2013, Sergeant Perna had never performed\n\na child pornography-related forensic examination before his evaluation of Wheeler’s\n\ndigital universe.29\n\n       At trial, it was undisputed that the charged images came to be on each of\n\nWheeler’s devices through his subscription to newsgroups. Newsgroups are Internet\n\ndiscussion groups in which people exchange, browse, upload, and download files, which\n\ncan be documents, photos, or videos. It was also undisputed that there is nothing illegal\n\nabout newsgroups as a general matter, and that they exist on a variety of legitimate\n\ntopics. Because the 25 indicted images were found in the newsgroup cache, the State\n\nagreed throughout the proceedings that this was not an Internet case.                Nor was an\n\nindictment obtained with respect to Wheeler’s Internet activity.\n\n       Sergeant Perna testified that the 25 charged images were found in two newsgroups\n\nthat Wheeler subscribed to: “alt.binaries.pictures.asparagus” and “alt.fan.air.”30\n\nHowever, Sergeant Perna acknowledged that there is no way to forensically determine\n\nwhether a newsreader user has viewed any particular file. Accordingly, at oral argument\n\n29\n   Sergeant Perna’s testimony in this case represented the first time that he had ever testified as\nan expert in a child pornography trial.\n30\n   A240 (Tr. 29:8-31:6). Sergeant Perna found four newsgroups related to child pornography\nthat Wheeler subscribed to on the PowerBook: “alt.binaries.pictures.asparagus,”\n“alt.fan.prettyboy,” “alt.fan.rdm,” and “alt.fan.snuffles.” Id. at Tr. 31:11-32:6.\n                                                16\n\fbefore this Court, the State conceded that it could not conclusively prove that Wheeler\n\never viewed the 25 charged images at issue.31\n\n       At trial, Sergeant Perna acknowledged that he had no expertise concerning\n\nnewsgroups or newsreaders.32        He explained that information from newsgroups\n\nautomatically caches on the subscriber’s computer, regardless of whether the user\n\naccesses that information.     But if Wheeler had downloaded the images of child\n\npornography from the newsgroups, Sergeant Perna agreed that such images should have\n\nappeared somewhere other than the cache on Wheeler’s computer. Here, the 25 charged\n\nimages appeared only in the cache. Accordingly, Sergeant Perna conceded that the\n\ngovernment could not forensically establish that Wheeler ever viewed the 25 indicted\n\nimages:\n\n       Q.     Fair to say that the 25 charged images here found in the cache, you cannot\n       forensically say whether or not they were ever viewed, correct, you can simply say\n       they cached?\n\n       A.

But it is possible that not only was the image never viewed, but the\n       news[]group wasn’t even visited on those dates when they cached, correct?\n\n       A.     Correct.34\n\n                                          *        *    *\n\n\n31\n   See Oral Argument at 52:20.\n32\n   See A243 (Tr. 43:6-8) (Q. [Newsreaders are] not something that you had a lot of expertise\nabout, correct? A. No, sir.).\n33\n   A250 (Tr. 71:4-8).\n34\n   A251 (Tr. 76:12-15).\n                                              17\n\f          Q.    And you cannot say that Mr. Wheeler actually opened up and viewed the\n          news[]groups on the days in question?\n\n          A.     No.\n\n          Q.    And you cannot say that he ever viewed any of the images that he has been\n          charged for, correct?\n\n          A.     No.35\n\n                                           *        *   *\n\n          Q.     All you can tell is what news[]group the person has selected a box [sic],\n          correct?\n\n          A.     Yes.\n\n          Q.    You can never know if they ever even viewed that particular news box,\n          much less the contents within?\n\n          A.     No.36\n\nBased upon such testimony, Wheeler argued that the State had not adequately proved that\n\nhe possessed the indicted images because the State failed to establish that he even viewed\n\nthe images.\n\n                         H.    The Motion for Judgment of Acquittal\n\n          Between the close of evidence and closing arguments, Wheeler filed his Motion\n\nfor Judgment of Acquittal. On December 22, 2014, the Superior Court denied Wheeler’s\n\nMotion for Judgment of Acquittal, finding Wheeler guilty of each of the 25 indicted\n\ncounts of Dealing in Child Pornography. The trial court concluded that the evidence\n\ndemonstrated that “Wheeler developed a pattern of Internet browsing for child\n\n\n35\n     A252 (Tr. 80:7-13).\n36\n     A253 (Tr. 82:22:-83:5).\n                                               18\n\fpornography.”37 In part, the trial court reasoned that “[t]he sheer number of images . . .\n\nsupports the reasonable inference that Mr. Wheeler intentionally, as opposed to\n\ninadvertently, possessed child pornography.”38\n\n       On April 24, 2015, Wheeler was sentenced to 50 years at Level V. Two days\n\nlater, on April 26, 2015, Wheeler filed his Notice of Appeal in this Court.\n\n                           I.      Proceedings Before this Court\n\n       Wheeler appeals from the Superior Court’s denial of both of his motions, although\n\nhe focuses primarily on the trial court’s denial of his Motion to Suppress. As to the\n\nMotion to Suppress, he contends that the Superior Court erred because: (1) the Affidavits\n\nfailed to establish probable cause that he committed the alleged witness tampering\n\ncrimes; (2) the State deliberately and recklessly omitted information from the Affidavits\n\nthat was material to the Issuing Judge’s probable cause determination; (3) the Affidavits\n\nfailed to establish the required nexus between evidence of witness tampering and the\n\nitems to be searched for and seized; and (4) the Witness Tampering Warrants were\n\nunconstitutionally overbroad.\n\n\n37\n   State v.

Although the State filed no charges relating to 2,000 images of\nchild pornography and 3,000 images of child erotica discovered across Wheeler’s digital\nuniverse, it argued that these images were evidence of Wheeler’s intentional possession, receipt,\nand compilation of the 25 charged images. Further, although the record is not entirely clear, the\nState contends that these images were downloaded from the Internet through the use of\nnewsgroups. Ans. Br. 5. The trial court relied upon the 2,000 images of child pornography as\nevidence that Wheeler intentionally, as opposed to inadvertently, possessed the 25 charged\nimages.

Sergeant Perna found a program called\n“NetShred X” on certain of Wheeler’s devices. According to Sergeant Perna, NetShred X is a\nprogram that erases a user’s Internet activity from the computer’s hard drive. See A242 (Tr.\n37:10-14). Notably, the State agrees that this is not an Internet case.\n38\n   Wheeler II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">7474234</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *13.\n                                               19\n\f       Because we conclude that the Witness Tampering Warrants are prohibited general\n\nwarrants, we do not reach Wheeler’s assertion that no probable cause existed to issue the\n\nWitness Tampering Warrants. We briefly address it only insofar as it bears on the\n\nconstitutional analysis and provides useful context.\n\n       The witness tampering charges relate to three individuals: NK and two of the W\n\nbrothers. As to NK, the Affidavits suggest that he never reported Wheeler’s sexual abuse\n\nto the police because “his father would pay him off.”39 But the State conceded during\n\noral argument before this Court that there was likely no evidence of the witness\n\ntampering that allegedly occurred in Illinois present in Wheeler’s Delaware home or\n\noffice: according to the State, the police were “not going to find anything regarding\n\n[NK], the son.”40\n\n       That leaves the W brothers’ allegations as a possible basis for justifying the search\n\nand seizure of Wheeler’s property. As to the W brothers, the Affidavits establish that\n\nthey initiated communication with Wheeler beginning in July 2013. But Sergeant Perna\n\nsearched Wheeler’s iMac for evidence of witness tampering related to such\n\ncommunication, despite the fact that the iMac had not been powered on since September\n\n2012. Upon discovering that the iMac had last been turned on in 2012, Sergeant Perna\n\n\n\n39\n   Wheeler argues that “the [A]ffidavits do not allege that any witness tampering of [NK]\noccurred in Delaware or within 5 years to satisfy [Delaware’s] statute of limitations.” Op. Br.\n20. The record evidence indicates that Wheeler’s alleged “pay offs” to NK occurred in Illinois,\nyears before the underlying search. Specifically, the Affidavits suggest that this conduct\noccurred when Wheeler and NK lived in Illinois, but do not indicate whether NK provided the\nBluffton Police with particular dates as to when the pay offs were made. Nor was any evidence\npresented to this Court showing that such payments were made.\n40\n   Oral Argument at 40:25.\n                                              20\n\fshould have terminated his forensic examination of the device since it could not contain\n\ninformation from the relevant time frame.\n\n       Further, Wheeler argues that none of the evidence presented creates a reasonable\n\ninference that he acted “knowingly and with malice.”41 In his July 20, 2013 letter to\n\nWheeler, SW first raised the matter of restitution and Wheeler responded that he would\n\nwait to hear from SW “about further appropriate steps towards resolution and restitution.”\n\nWhether an offer of civil restitution forms a sufficient basis for witness tampering and\n\nintimidation charges—such that it establishes that the offeror acts knowingly and with\n\nmalice in attempting to undermine any trial, proceeding, or inquiry—presents a question,\n\nwhere, as here, the offer of restitution is responsive to a request from the potential\n\nwitness, is accompanied by an admission of guilt, and does not indicate an intention to\n\nprevent the potential witness from contacting law enforcement. We do not address these\n\nother important arguments, since we think it is clear that the challenged warrants were of\n\na kind which it was the purpose of the Fourth Amendment to forbid—general warrants.\n\nThus, even accepting for the sake of argument that the Witness Tampering Warrants were\n\nissued upon probable cause, the order denying the Motion to Suppress must be reversed.\n\n41\n   See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Del.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. § 1263 (“A person is guilty of tampering with a witness when: . . . (3) The\nperson knowingly intimidates a witness or victim under circumstances set forth in subchapter III\nof Chapter 35 of this title.”). A person is guilty of the Act of Intimidating a Witness when that\nperson “knowingly and with malice attempts to prevent another person who has been the victim\nof a crime, or a witness to a crime (or any person acting on behalf of a victim or witness) from”\nengaging in certain enumerated acts related to the administration or enforcement of the law.

He contends that the State\nintentionally or recklessly omitted material information from the Affidavits. Because we find\nthat the Witness Tampering Warrants are unconstitutionally general, we also need not reach this\nissue.\n                                               21\n\f                                     II.    ANALYSIS\n\n          In assessing Wheeler’s challenge to the Witness Tampering Warrants on the\n\ngrounds that they violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and\n\nArticle I, § 6 of the Delaware Constitution, we review such alleged constitutional\n\nviolations de novo.42      We also apply de novo review to the Superior Court’s legal\n\nconclusions when reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress.43 “We review the\n\nSuperior Court’s factual findings to determine ‘whether there was sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the findings and whether those findings were clearly erroneous.’”44\n\n     A.

Delaware’s Search and Seizure Protections\n\n       The search and seizure protections in the Delaware Constitution preceded the\n\nadoption of the Fourth Amendment.65 In 1776, Delaware adopted its own constitutional\n\nprotections against general warrants66 and embraced the first search and seize safeguards\n\nfor its citizens.67 The Declaration of Rights and Fundamental Rules of the Delaware\n\nState provided:\n\n       Sect. 17. That all warrants without oath to search suspected places, or to\n       seize any person or his property, are grievous and oppressive; and all\n       general warrants to search suspected places, or to apprehend all persons\n       suspected, without naming or describing the place or any person in special,\n       are illegal and ought not to be granted.68\n\nThis provision was the antecedent to the provision now found in Article I, § 6 of the\n\npresent Delaware Constitution.\n\n       On January 28, 1790, Delaware ratified the Bill of Rights to the United States\n\nConstitution.69 But when Delaware subsequently adopted a new State Constitution in\n\n1792, it closely tracked the language of the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1790.70 In\n\nprevious cases, this Court has held that our Constitution affords our citizens protections\n\n\n\n\nEngland and in the American colonies, to exceed laws which confined governmental powers to\nsearch.”).\n65\n   Id. at 247 (“Delaware’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures predate those\nwhich are provided for in the Fourth Amendment.”); see also Jones v.

The warrant must describe the things to be searched with sufficient\n\nparticularity and be no broader than the probable cause on which it is based.74 “The\n\nmanifest purpose of this particularity requirement [i]s to prevent general searches. By\n\nlimiting the authorization to search to the specific areas and things for which there is\n\nprobable cause to search, the requirement ensures that the search will be carefully tailored\n\n\n\n\n71\n   For instance, we note three cases in which this Court held that our State Constitution provides\nsomewhat broader constitutional protections. First, despite observing that the language of the\nFourth Amendment and Article I, § 6 is “nearly identical,” we have held that “the Delaware\nConstitution provides a greater protection for the individual than the United States Constitution\nin the determination of whether a seizure by the State has occurred.” Flonnory v.

Accordingly, the proper metric of sufficient\n\nspecificity is whether it was reasonable to provide a more specific description of the\n\nitems at that juncture of the investigation.90\n\n       Further, the propensity of criminals to disguise files must be balanced against the\n\ncompeting interest of avoiding unrestrained general searches: “It is unrealistic to expect\n\na warrant to prospectively restrict the scope of a search by directory, filename or\n\nextension or to attempt to structure search methods—that process must remain\n\ndynamic.”91 “[I]t is clear that because criminals can—and often do—hide, mislabel, or\n\nmanipulate files to conceal criminal activity, a broad, expansive search of the hard drive\n\nmay be required.”92 Consequently, it would likely unduly restrict law enforcement to\n\nrequire the crafting of specific keyword searches or identification of file names and\n\nextensions ex ante. In some instances, the technological reality may be that, “in the end,\n\nthere may be no practical substitute for actually looking in many (perhaps all) folders and\n\nsometimes at the documents contained within those folders, and that is true whether the\n\n\n\n\n90\n   See, e.g., Christine, 687 F.2d at 760 (“[T]he use of generic classifications in a warrant is\nacceptable when a more precise description is not feasible.”) (citations omitted).\n91\n   Burgess, 576 F.3d at 1093 (“While file or directory names may sometimes alert one to the\ncontents . . ., illegal activity may not be advertised even in the privacy of one’s personal\ncomputer—it could well be coded or otherwise disguised.” (footnote omitted)).\n92\n   Stabile, 633 F.3d at 237 (citing Burgess, 576 F.3d at 1092-94).\n                                                 31\n\fsearch is of computer files or physical files.”93 “[N]o tenet of the Fourth Amendment\n\nprohibits a search merely because it cannot be performed with surgical precision.”94\n\n       This Court has addressed Fourth Amendment challenges in the digital context on\n\ntwo occasions. But in neither case did we confront directly a challenge that a warrant\n\nseeking digital information failed to satisfy the particularity requirement in the United\n\nStates and Delaware Constitutions.\n\n       In the more recent of the cases, Bradley v. State,95 we considered whether the\n\nsearch exceeded the scope of the warrants, but not whether the warrants were\n\nunconstitutionally general. Bradley argued, among other things, that the police exceeded\n\nthe scope of the warrant in executing the instrument and that the supporting affidavit\n\nfailed to establish probable cause that patient files would be found in digital format. This\n\nCourt concluded that “the computers and digital storage devices could reasonably contain\n\nthe patient files described in the warrant, whether in text or image form.”96 Thus, in\n\nBradley, there was no basis for segregating text files from other types of files because\n\nprobable cause allowed for the search of both.\n\n       Likewise, in the earlier case of Fink v. State,97 the State obtained a warrant to\n\nsearch the residence and automobile of the defendant, who was an attorney, for “client\n\nfiles including but not limited to” specifically listed clients and the personal banking\n\n93\n   Burgess, 576 F.3d at 1094; see also Ninety-Two Thousand, 307 F.3d at 150 (suggesting that, in\nsome instances, it may be “necessary to search for and seize all” files when executing a search\nwarrant).\n94\n   Christine, 687 F.2d at 760.\n95\n   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Del. 2012).\n96\n   Id. at 435.\n97\n   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1888895\"><a href=\"/opinion/1888895/fink-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">817</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Del. 2003).\n                                              32\n\frecords of the defendant. During the execution of the third of three search warrants, the\n\npolice recovered a computer compact disk and three zip disks, each of which contained\n\nchild pornography. The defendant argued that the warrant lacked sufficient particularity\n\nand that the words, “client files including but not limited to,” were overly broad and\n\nfailed to adequately limit the search to those items for which probable cause had been\n\nestablished. This Court rejected the overbreadth claim, since the defendant’s financial\n\ndealings at issue “effectively opened all his financial records to potential scrutiny by the\n\npolice.”98    Accordingly, we held that “the warrant’s authorized search did not\n\nunreasonably exceed a logical scope of inquiry.”99 However, this Court did not more\n\ndirectly address the permissible scope of warrants seeking digital information.100\n\n       Thus, we consider more directly, for the first time, a challenge to warrants seeking\n\nto seize and search computer-based and digital items on the grounds that they are in the\n\nnature of a general warrant, unconstitutionally overbroad, and lack sufficient\n\nparticularity.

It stated that the warrant “was not limited to any\n\nparticular files, or to any particular federal crime. The warrant authorized the ‘seizure’ of\n\n[the defendant’s] computer”\n\n       and all electronic and magnetic media stored therein, together with all\n       storage devises [sic], internal or external to the computer or computer\n       system, including but not limited to floppy disks, diskettes, hard disks,\n       magnetic tapes, removable media drives, optical media such as CD–ROM,\n       printers, modems, and any other electronic or magnetic devises [sic] used\n       as a peripheral to the computer or computer system, and all electronic\n       media stored within such devises [sic].102\n\nThe Tenth Circuit observed that, “[b]y its terms, the warrant thus permitted the officers to\n\nsearch for anything—from child pornography to tax returns to private correspondence.

The Witness Tampering Warrants Have No Temporal Limitations, Despite\n                          Relevant Dates Being Available to the Police\n\n            A key principle distilled from the jurisprudence in this area is that warrants, in\n\norder to satisfy the particularity requirement, must describe what investigating officers\n\nbelieve will be found on electronic devices with as much specificity as possible under the\n\ncircumstances. That principle simply was not followed here in several respects. One\n\nobvious respect was the failure to limit the search to the relevant time frame.

And the Affidavits do not\n\nsuggest otherwise. As to the only other potential victims, the W brothers, the Affidavits\n\nindicate that the alleged witness tampering occurred, if it did, in or after July 2013, since\n\nthat was when the W brothers renewed contact with Wheeler.121 The Affidavits contain\n\nno facts suggesting that any tampering might have occurred prior to July 2013. Yet, the\n\nWitness Tampering Warrants were boundless as to time. Sergeant Perna testified that\n\none of the first things he did in executing the search was determine when the iMac was\n\nlast used. Proceeding under the Witness Tampering Warrants, he determined that the\n\ncomputer had last been powered on in September 2012.                  However, the State\n\nunsystematically sifted through Wheeler’s digital universe, even though the iMac\n\nlogically could not have contained material created or recorded during the relevant time\n\nperiod.\n\n       A failure to describe the items to be searched for and seized with as much\n\nparticularity as the circumstances reasonably allow offends the constitutional protections\n\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures. Because the State was able to more precisely\n\ndescribe the items to be searched and seized, the Witness Tampering Warrants violated\n\nthe particularity requirement.\n\n120\n  See id.; Ford, 184 F.3d at 576.\n121\n   The State also conceded at oral argument before this Court that the relevant time period\ncommenced in 2013. See Oral Argument at 40:37.\n                                             39\n\f  2.     The Witness Tampering Warrants Likely Fail the Particularity Requirement for\n                                  Other Reasons\n\n       The Witness Tampering Warrants likely fail the particularity requirement in other\n\nrespects. For example, nothing in the Affidavits supports an inference that evidence may\n\nbe found on DVDs or optical cameras. The Affidavits do not allege that Wheeler was\n\ncommunicating with NK or any of the W brothers through videos or pictures. Nor do the\n\nAffidavits link witness tampering to these types of media. The likely reason that the\n\nWitness Tampering Warrants sought the search for and seizure of devices and items that\n\ncannot lead to evidence of witness tampering based on the Affidavits is that, as the State\n\nconceded, the language was essentially copied and pasted from a search warrant for child\n\npornography.      Although the parties agree that cutting and pasting search warrant\n\nlanguage does not automatically invalidate the resulting instrument, that technique has\n\nled, in the context of this case, to search warrants that do not satisfy the particularity\n\nrequirement.122\n\n       Further, the Affidavits recite that the State was searching for “evidence of written\n\ncommunications,” which it believed were relevant to the alleged witness tampering.\n\nSergeant Perna wrote in his forensic report and testified that he was “looking for any files\n\ncreated and/or saved as word documents, emails, text messages, pdf [sic] or any other\n\n\n\n\n122\n   Cf.

See Dorsey, 761 A.2d at 820-21.\n                                             40\n\frelated file format.”123 The portions of the Affidavits discussing the items sought refer to\n\nwritten communications.124 These observations suggest that the items for which there\n\nwas probable cause to search and seize were written communications—not DVDs and\n\n\n123\n   A191 (Tr. 38:10-19).\n124\n    At oral argument before this Court, the State asserted that it was not relying on incorporation\nof the Affidavits into the Witness Tampering Warrants for the latter to satisfy the particularity\nrequirement. Oral Argument at 31:50. In Groh v. Ramirez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131161\"><a href=\"/opinion/131161/groh-v-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004), the United\nStates Supreme Court observed that, although supporting documentation adequately describes\nthe things to be searched for and seized, such description does not necessarily save a warrant\nfrom its facial invalidity. Id. at 557. The Supreme Court noted that: “The Fourth Amendment\nby its terms requires particularity in the warrant, not in the supporting documents.” Id. (citations\nomitted) (emphasis added). It also stated the following: “We do not say that the Fourth\nAmendment prohibits a warrant from cross-referencing other documents. Indeed, most [Federal]\nCourts of Appeals have held that a court may construe a warrant with reference to a supporting\napplication or affidavit if the warrant uses appropriate words of incorporation, and if the\nsupporting document accompanies the warrant.” Id. at 557-58 (citations omitted).\n         Some Federal Courts of Appeals have limited Groh’s import to establishing that an\nunconstitutional warrant can be saved by its supporting documentation only if the warrant\nappropriately references the supporting document through “clear” language of incorporation and\nthe supporting document accompanies the warrant. See, e.g., United States v. Perez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">6405695</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (6th Cir. Oct. 23, 2015) (citing Groh, 540 U.S. at 557-58); Tracey, 597 F.3d at\n146-48 (citations omitted) (“Along with other Courts of Appeals, we have held that an affidavit\nmay be used in determining the scope of a warrant that lacks particularity if the warrant is\n‘accompanied by an affidavit that is incorporated by reference.’”); United States v. Waker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1198805\"><a href=\"/opinion/1198805/united-states-v-waker/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 172-73 (2d Cir. 2008). Others have held that, for an unconstitutional warrant to be\ncured through incorporation by reference to an affidavit, the affidavit must not be filed under\nseal. See, e.g., Bartholomew v. Pennsylvania, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769756\"><a href=\"/opinion/769756/gene-bartholomew-robin-bartholomew-husband-and-wife-v-commonwealth-of-pa/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 429-30 (3d Cir. 2000) (“We now\nmake clear . . . and hold that, generally speaking, where the list of items to be seized does not\nappear on the face of the warrant, sealing that list, even though it is ‘incorporated’ in the warrant,\nwould violate the Fourth Amendment.”). Here, the Applications and Affidavits indicate that they\nwere filed under seal.\n         Although the Witness Tampering Warrants, under “ITEMS TO BE SEARCHED FOR\nAND SEIZED[,]” state in paragraph 1, “[e]nter and search the residence [or office] as\ncompletely described herein [sic] the application and affidavit for evidence of the\naforementioned crime(s)[,]” it is not clear that the broad lists of items in the Witness Tampering\nWarrants are necessarily limited by the Affidavits and, if so, in what fashion. A19 (Warrant 1 ¶\n1); A31 (Warrant 2 ¶ 1). This is true particularly in view of the fact that the Affidavits contain\nsweeping, boilerplate language concerning digital data and the ability of forensic experts to\nrecover it for lengthy periods of time, including “years after it [i]s written.” Thus, even\nassuming, arguendo, that the Affidavits are fairly incorporated, they fail to cure the\nconstitutional defects, as they lack temporal restraints as to all potential victims and fail to guide\nthe executing officers as to the limits of the search and seizure.\n                                                 41\n\foptical cameras. Yet, by their terms, the Witness Tampering Warrants permitted the\n\nState to search for anything—from child pornography to medical records to consumer\n\ninformation to tax returns.         In short, they permitted the species of wide-ranging,\n\nexploratory searches the Framers intended to prohibit. Because the lack of temporal\n\nlimitations is sufficient to invalidate the Witness Tampering Warrants, we need not reach\n\nthese other potential substantive challenges.          Instead, we caution that the risk that\n\nwarrants for digital and electronic devices take on the character of “general warrants” is\n\nsubstantial. This reality necessitates heightened vigilance, at the outset, on the part of\n\njudicial officers to guard against unjustified invasions of privacy.\n\n                                     III.   CONCLUSION\n\n          The subject of this prosecution is an unsympathetic figure.           And the sexual\n\nexploitation of children is a dreadful scourge in our society. But “[t]he principles laid\n\ndown in this [O]pinion affect the very essence of constitutional liberty and security.\n\nThey reach further than the concrete form of the case before the court . . .; they apply to\n\nall invasions on the part of the government and its employe[e]s of the sanctity of a\n\n[person’s] home and the privacies of life.”125 “There is always a temptation in criminal\n\ncases to let the end justify the means, but as guardians of the Constitution, we must resist\n\nthat temptation.”126\n\n          The United States Constitution and the Delaware Constitution both mandate that\n\nthe decision of the Superior Court with respect to the Motion to Suppress be reversed.\n\n\n125\n      Boyd, 116 U.S. at 630.\n126\n      Castagnola, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1934723</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *20 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n                                                 42\n\fAccordingly, the judgments of conviction are REVERSED.
