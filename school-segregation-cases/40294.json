One\nof their adult children, a son, and his wife have three children – T.P. (12 y.o.a.), A.P.\n(7 y.o.a.), and B.P. (6 y.o.a.).2 (Tr. 353, 386.)               The children’s parents became\ninvolved in “street” drugs and Tom and Sue took legal and physical custody (by\nagreement) of those three grandchildren in 2002. (Tr. 353-354.) Sue does not work\noutside the home, but cares for the children on a daily basis. (Tr. 371.)\n        {¶3}    In 2007, Tom’s friend, Stoffer, came to them in need of a place to stay\nfollowing an accident and injury. (Tr. 354.) Tom had been friends with Stoffer since\ngrade school. (Tr. 386.) They rented a bedroom in their home to him for $75 a\nmonth. (Tr. 355.)\n        {¶4}    Stoffer was not working, but received VA benefits. (Tr. 387-388.)\nStoffer regularly took part in family gatherings and spent a lot of time with the\ngrandchildren, and was generally treated as part of the family. (Tr. 349, 372, 376-\n377, 403, 474-476.) A.P. and B.P. would spend time with Stoffer in his room. (Tr.\n361-362, 372.) Stoffer kept a computer and digital camera in the room. (Tr. 360, 393,\n476.) He would let them play games on his computer and allowed A.P. to use the\ncamera. A guitar which A.P.’s father had given her for her birthday was kept on a\nshelf in the closet in his room out of her reach. (Tr. 365-366, 453.)\n        {¶5}    Another of Tom and Sue’s five children, Karen, lives in her own home\ndirectly behind her parents. (Tr. 342.) She has two children of her own, two young\nboys – a 4-year-old and a 5-year-old. (Tr. 343.)                     Since they were next door\nneighbors, Karen’s children would often play with T.P., A.P., and B.P. (Tr. 343.)\n\n\n1. Tom and Sue’s last name has been withheld to protect the identity of the child victim in this case.\n2. The children’s stated ages were their ages at the time of trial.\n\f                                                                              -3-\n\n\nKaren and her children would spend time in her parents’ house and in turn, Karen\nwould occasionally watch all of the children at her house when her mother went out\nto the store or on errands. (Tr. 343, 346.)\n       {¶6}   On July 2, 2008, the kids had been playing outside and then went into\nKaren’s house to watch cartoons. (Tr. 343.) As she was in the kitchen doing dishes,\nKaren overheard the children’s conversation. (Tr. 343.) A.P. asked Karen’s 5-year-\nold boy to take his shirt off and then asked him to take his pants off. (Tr. 344.) She\nthen giggled and told him she was just kidding. (Tr. 344.) When Karen asked A.P.\nwhy she had asked the 5-year-old to take his pants off, she replied that she was only\nkidding. (Tr. 344.) At that point, B.P. spoke up and said he had seen Stoffer and A.P.\nkissing. (Tr. 344-345.) When Sue returned from the store, Karen told Sue that she\nneeded to have a talk with A.P. (Tr. 345.)\n       {¶7}   After talking with A.P., Sue had serious concerns about what had\noccurred between A.P. and Stoffer and phoned Tom at work to relay those concerns\nto him. (Tr. 356-357, 389.) Tom left work early and returned home. (Tr. 389.) Tom\nconfronted Stoffer and told him he had heard that he was “messing” with his\ngranddaughter. (Tr. 390.) Stoffer responded that he would never do anything like\nthat. (Tr. 390.) Tom then brought A.P. to Stoffer and had her recite the allegations to\nhim. (Tr. 391.) He again denied the allegations, but then indicated that he might\nhave pulled her pants down but forgot and that he had picked her up by her feet and\nher underwear had fallen off. (Tr. 391.)\n       {¶8}   Sue went to the Columbiana County Department of Job and Family\nServices on July 7, 2008, to report what had occurred. (Tr. 315.) Laurie Jones, an\ninvestigator with that department, went to Tom and Sue’s home the following day to\nassess the safety of the children. (Tr. 315-316.) Since Tom and Sue had asked\nStoffer to leave the home and believed A.P.’s story, Jones determined that A.P. was\nsafe. (Tr. 316.)\n       {¶9}   Jones returned to Tom and Sue’s home on July 18, 2008 for a follow-up\nvisit. (Tr. 316.)   This time, she was accompanied by Dan Valentine, a part-time\n\f                                                                              -4-\n\n\nconstable for the Salem Township Police Department. (Tr. 316.) Jones interviewed\nT.P. and B.P. (Tr. 316.) Valentine interviewed and took statements from Sue and\nKaren. (Tr. 226.) A.P. was not formally interviewed and was instead scheduled to be\nseen at Tri-County Advocacy Center in Youngstown, Ohio. (Tr. 243, 316-317.) The\ncenter is a medical clinic in which children who are suspected of being abused are\nmedically evaluated. (Tr. 243.)\n       {¶10} A.P. was evaluated at the center on July 22, 2008 by Dr. Paul\nMcPherson. (Tr. 245.)      After he obtained her medical history, A.P. was then\ninterviewed by the center’s social worker, Diana Russo. (Tr. 346.) Dr. McPherson\nand Laurie Jones observed the interview as it took place via closed circuit television.\n(Tr. 246, 251, 317.) During the interview, A.P. disclosed that Stoffer had kissed her\n“boobies.” (Tr. 249.) She also said that Stoffer touched her “private area” and that it\nhurt after she “peed.” (Tr. 249.) She also explained the Stoffer put her hand on his\n“private part” over his clothes and that Stoffer got on top of her and moved up and\ndown on her with his clothes on. (Tr. 250.) For the first time, she also revealed that\nStoffer had taken pictures of her “boobies” and “private spot.” (Tr. 250.)\n       {¶11} Valentine subsequently located Stoffer at a motel in North Lima. North\nLima is located in Beaver Township, Mahoning County, Ohio, where Valentine is also\na full-time police officer with the rank of corporal. (Tr.223.) Valentine obtained a\nsearch warrant for Stoffer’s room in hopes of locating his computer and digital\ncamera. (Tr. 228.) Valentine, along with other members of the Beaver Township\nPolice Department and Laurie Jones, executed the warrant on July 25, 2008.\n(11/07/2008 Suppression Hearing Tr. 8, Trial Tr. 228.) When it was apparent that\nthere were very few personal items of Stoffer’s found in the room or his vehicle,\nStoffer was asked where his belongings were and he indicated that they were in a\nstorage unit. (Tr. 232.) Stoffer gave the police consent to search the unit and they\nrecovered the camera they were looking for. (Tr. 232-233.)\n       {¶12} Valentine forwarded the camera to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal\nIdentification and Investigation. (Tr. 234.) There, forensic specialist Joann Gibb was\n\f                                                                              -5-\n\n\nable to view numerous pictures which had been deleted from the camera. (Tr. 274.)\nThree of these pictures showed A.P. in various stages of nudity in Stoffer’s room at\nTom and Sue’s house. (Tr. 237-238, 275.)\n      {¶13} On August 20, 2008, a Columbiana County grand jury indicted Stoffer\non two counts of gross sexual imposition, in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4), third-\ndegree felonies, and three counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material\nor performance, in violation of R.C. 2907.323(A)(1), second-degree felonies. Stoffer\npleaded not guilty, the court appointed him counsel, and the case proceeded to\ndiscovery and other pretrial matters.\n      {¶14} One of those pretrial matters which is relevant in this appeal is a motion\nto suppress filed by Stoffer on October 31, 2008. Stoffer argued that no search\nwarrant had been provided in discovery and that if a search warrant was issued there\nwas no probable cause to justify its issuance. He also argued that no consent to\nsearch form had been provided in discovery and that if there was one, his consent\nwas not validly obtained.\n      {¶15} The trial court held a hearing on the motion on November 7, 2008. The\nstate presented the testimony of Valentine who testified about the execution of the\nsearch warrant and Stoffer’s consent to search the storage unit and subsequent\nconsent to search the memory of the computer and digital camera that were seized.\n      {¶16} On November 10, 2008, the trial court denied Stoffer’s motion to\nsuppress. The court reasoned that Stoffer was cooperative and voluntarily signed\nboth consent forms and voluntarily led the police officers to the camera and admitted\nthat the camera was his. The court found that there was no evidence of revocation of\nany consents or any coercion or threats employed to get Stoffer to sign the consent\nforms or to make the admissions that he did.\n      {¶17} On November 25, 2008, a Columbiana County grand jury returned a\nsuperseding indictment charging Stoffer with the same offenses as before but adding\nthe mental state of purposely to the two counts of gross sexual imposition and adding\n\f                                                                                -6-\n\n\nthe mental state of recklessly to the three counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-\noriented material or performance.\n       {¶18} The case proceeded to a jury trial on December 8, 2008. After initial\ninstructions, a jury view of Tom and Sue’s home was conducted, in particular the\nroom Stoffer rented while he was there and where the pictures that formed the basis\nof the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance counts were\ntaken. The state presented the testimony of those who investigated the case: Laurie\nJones, the investigator with the Columbiana County Department of Job and Family\nService who first interviewed A.P.’s family and who witnessed the formal interview at\nthe Tri-County Advocacy group; Dan Valentine, the part-time constable of Salem\nTownship where the crimes occurred and a full-time police officer in Beaver\nTownship where Stoffer was located and where the digital camera was recovered\nwhich yielded the pictures that formed the basis of the illegal use of a minor in nudity-\noriented material or performance counts; Dr. Paul McPherson, who evaluated A.P. at\nthe Tri-County Advocacy Center; and Joann Gibb, the forensic specialist with the\nOhio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation that recovered the illicit\npictures from Stoffer’s digital camera. The state also presented the testimony of A.P.\nand her family, including her grandparents, Tom and Sue, her aunt Karen, and her\nbrother, B.P. Various pictures including the three nude pictures taken of A.P. were\nadmitted as evidence. Stoffer testified in his own defense. He described how A.P.’s\npants may have fell down while playing, explained that he only gave the children\n“goodnight” kisses, and denied rubbing up against A.P. or taking nude pictures of\nher.\n       {¶19} On December 9, 2008, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all five\ncounts contained in the indictment. On December 17, 2008, the trial court sentenced\nStoffer to five years in prison on each of the gross sexual imposition counts to be\nserved consecutively to each other and five years in prison on each of the illegal use\nof a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance counts to be served\nconcurrently with each other but consecutively with the sentence for the gross sexual\n\f                                                                              -7-\n\n\nimposition counts for an aggregate sentence of fifteen years. The trial court also\ndesignated Stoffer a Tier II Sex Offender/Child Victim Offender pursuant to R.C.\nChapter 2950, and was advised of his duty to register under the statute. This appeal\nfollowed.\n       {¶20} Stoffer raises fifteen assignments of error. Stoffer’s first assignment of\nerror states:\n       {¶21} “THE          TRIAL    COURT      ERRED        IN     DENYING        THE\nDEFENDANT/APPELLANT’S MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE[.]”\n       {¶22} Stoffer contends that when the police officers executed the search\nwarrant at his hotel room he was placed in handcuffs. When they were unable to\nlocate the digital camera they were looking for and questioned him about its location,\nhe revealed that it was in a storage unit. Stoffer characterizes the encounter as a\ncustodial interrogation.    Since the police did not read him his Miranda rights, he\nargues that his revelation about the location of the digital camera and the pictures\nrecovered from it are physical evidence obtained as a result of unwarned statements\nand, thus, are inadmissible.\n       {¶23} In response, the state points out that in his motion to suppress and at\nthe hearing on the motion Stoffer never challenged the evidence on the basis of the\npolice officer’s failure to read him his Miranda rights. The state contends the hearing\nwas confined to whether there was an unreasonable search and seizure (i.e.\nwarrantless) and whether there was valid consent given by Stoffer.\n       {¶24} This court has observed that a defendant’s failure to raise an issue in a\nmotion to suppress constitutes a waiver of that issue on appeal. State v. Roskovich,\n7th Dist. No. 04 BE 37, 2005-Ohio-2719, ¶13, citing State v. Peagler (1996), 76 Ohio\nSt.3d 496, 500, 668 N.E.2d 489. A review of Stoffer’s motion to suppress reveals\nthat the Miranda issue was not raised in the motion. The motion set forth only two\nspecific grounds. The first was that the state had failed to produce a search warrant\nin discovery and that there was no probable cause to justify the search. The second\nwas that no valid consent to search was given by Stoffer. At the hearing on the\n\f                                                                                 -8-\n\n\nmotion, the only person to testify was Officer Dan Valentine. During his testimony,\nthe state provided Stoffer’s attorney with a copy of the search warrant and a copy of\nthe consent to search form.         Stoffer’s attorney’s cross-examination of Valentine\nsimply focused on who was present when the warrant and consent to search were\npresented to Stoffer and whether the consent-to-search form was explained to him.\nSince Stoffer never raised the Miranda issue below either in his motion or at the\nhearing on the motion, he waived that issue on appeal.\n       {¶25} We are left only to examine the propriety of the trial court’s decision\nbased on the two grounds that were presented to it in Stoffer’s suppression motion.\nThe standard of review in an appeal of a suppression issue is two-fold. State v.\nDabney, 7th Dist. No. 02BE31, 2003-Ohio-5141, at ¶9, citing State v. Lloyd (1998),\n126 Ohio App.3d 95, 100-101, 709 N.E.2d 913. Since the trial court is in the best\nposition to evaluate witness credibility, an appellate court must uphold the trial court’s\nfindings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. Id., citing State\nv. Winand (1996), 116 Ohio App.3d 286, 288, 688 N.E.2d 9, citing Tallmadge v.\nMcCoy (1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 604, 608, 645 N.E.2d 802.               However, once an\nappellate court has accepted those facts as true, the court must independently\ndetermine as a matter of law whether the trial court met the applicable legal standard.\nId., citing State v. Clayton (1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 623, 627, 620 N.E.2d 906. This\ndetermination is a question of law of which an appellate court cannot give deference\nto the trial court’s conclusion. Id., citing Lloyd.\n       {¶26} The first ground set forth in Stoffer’s suppression motion was that the\nstate had failed to produce a search warrant in discovery and that there was no\nprobable cause to justify the search. At the suppression hearing, the prosecutor\nprovided Stoffer’s defense counsel with a copy of the search warrant. In addition,\nOfficer Valentine testified that Stoffer was present at the motel when they went to\nexecute the warrant and that Stoffer was given a copy of the search warrant at that\ntime. (11/07/2008 Suppression Hearing Tr. 9-10, 17.)               Moreover, the only\nincriminating physical evidence there was in this case was Stoffer’s digital camera\n\f                                                                                  -9-\n\n\nand the images retrieved from it. The search warrant was limited to Stoffer’s motel\nroom and his vehicle. The digital camera was not retrieved from either of those\nlocations, but from a storage unit Stoffer had rented nearby. Since there was a\nsigned written consent by Stoffer to search that unit, the underlying probable cause\nfor the search warrant, which did not yield any incriminating evidence, was irrelevant.\n       {¶27} That brings us to the second ground set forth in the suppression motion\nwhich was that no valid consent to search was given by Stoffer.            Again, Officer\nValentine was the only person to testify at the suppression hearing. Stoffer did not\ntestify. Officer Valentine testified that Stoffer executed a written consent to search\nthe storage unit where the digital camera was located. (11/07/2008 Suppression\nHearing Tr. 11-12.) Stoffer opened the storage unit himself, was present the entire\ntime the officers searched it, and at no time revoked his consent. (11/07/2008\nSuppression Hearing Tr. 11-12.) Based on the evidence presented, we agree with\nthe trial court’s conclusion that Stoffer gave valid consent to police to search the\nstorage unit.\n       {¶28} Based on the foregoing and limited to the two grounds raised by\nStoffer’s suppression motion, the trial court did not err in overruling the motion.\n       {¶29} Accordingly, Stoffer’s first assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶30} Stoffer’s second assignment of error states:\n       {¶31} “THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING [B.P.] COMPETENT TO\nTESTIFY AND IN FINDING [A.P.] COMPETENT TO TESTIFY.”\n       {¶32} Stoffer contends that pursuant to Evid.R. 601(A) a child witness under\nthe age of ten is not competent to testify if they appear incapable of receiving or\nrelating facts properly. Stoffer points out that A.P.’s brother, B.P., who was six years\nold when he testified at the November 26, 2008 voir dire on the issue of competence,\nincorrectly stated that the next day would be Christmas. Stoffer states that B.P. also\ntestified that he did not know his address, his birthday, his grandmother’s name, what\nschool he attended, what grade he was in, what grade he was in the previous year,\n\f                                                                                 - 10 -\n\n\nand what house he lived in the previous year.         Stoffer also points out that B.P.\ndescribed trips to the county fair and to a park as his vacation.\n        {¶33} As for A.P., Stoffer contends her age at the time of voir dire was never\nestablished and that she did not know her own birthday or the name of her teacher\nfrom the previous year.\n        {¶34} In response, the state maintains that the trial court properly determined\nthrough the questioning of the children that they were capable of receiving just and\ntruthful impressions of facts and events and that they were able to accurately relate\nthem.    Nevertheless, the state argues that since Stoffer never objected to the\nintroduction of the children’s testimony any error arising therefrom does not rise to\nthe level of plain error.\n        {¶35} Since Stoffer failed to object to the trial court’s competency\ndetermination or the introduction of the children’s testimony at trial, this court reviews\nthis issue only for plain error. Crim.R. 52(B); In re Williams (1997), 116 Ohio App.3d\n237, 241, 687 N.E.2d 507.        To prevail on a claim governed by the plain error\nstandard, an appellant must demonstrate that the trial outcome would have been\nclearly different but for the alleged errors. State v. Waddell (1996), 75 Ohio St.3d\n163, 166, 661 N.E.2d 1043.\n        {¶36} Generally, an appellate court reviews a trial court’s determination of\nwhether a child is competent to testify for an abuse of discretion. State v. Frazier\n(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 247, 251, 574 N.E.2d 483. This is because the court has the\nopportunity to observe the child’s appearance, manner of responding to questions,\ndemeanor, and any indicia of ability to relate facts accurately and truthfully. Id.\nAbuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that\nthe trial court’s attitude was arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. State v.\nClark (1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 466, 470, 644 N.E.2d 331.\n        {¶37} Evid.R. 601(A) provides that “[e]very person is competent to be a\nwitness except: (A) Those of unsound mind, and children under ten years of age,\nwho appear incapable of receiving just impressions of the facts and transactions\n\f                                                                                  - 11 -\n\n\nrespecting which they are examined, or of relating them truly.” Thus, the trial court\nmust make a determination of whether a child under ten is competent to testify.\nWhen making this determination the court must consider:\n       {¶38} “(1) the child’s ability to receive accurate impressions of fact or to\nobserve acts about which he or she will testify, (2) the child’s ability to recollect those\nimpressions or observations, (3) the child’s ability to communicate what was\nobserved, (4) the child’s understanding of truth and falsity, and (5) the child’s\nappreciation of his or her responsibility to be truthful.” Frazier, 61 Ohio St.3d at 251,\n574 N.E.2d 483.\n       {¶39} Commenting on the Frazier considerations, the Ohio Supreme Court\nlater stated:\n       {¶40} “Those characteristics can be broken down into three elements. First,\nthe individual must have the ability to receive accurate impressions of fact. Second,\nthe individual must be able to accurately recollect those impressions. Third, the\nindividual must be able to relate those impressions truthfully.” State v. Said (1994),\n71 Ohio St.3d 473, 476, 644 N.E.2d 337.\n       {¶41} In this case, although the children could not relay certain details about\ntheir lives, they still demonstrated that they were competent to testify. As for B.P., he\nindicated that he knew that telling the truth was a rule of court. (Tr. 10.)           He\nunderstood that breaking a rule had consequences. (Tr. 10.) For example, he stated\nthat if he broke a rule at home he would be spanked. (Tr. 10.) He also demonstrated\nthat he understood what telling the truth meant. (Tr. 12.) Although he was unsure of\nwhat holiday was the next day (Thanksgiving), he knew that saying the female court\nreporter was a boy was not the truth. (Tr. 11-12.) He was able to tell the court that\nhis favorite television program was Sponge Bob and that saying Sponge Bob (who is\na boy) was a girl was not the truth. (Tr. 12.) He knew that he lived in Leetonia and\nthat he lived with “Grandma.” (Tr. 13.) He knew his sister’s name and her age. (Tr.\n14.)   Although he could not relate his exact birthdate, he was able to recall his\nfavorite present that he got for his birthday the previous year. (Tr. 14.) He was able\n\f                                                                                    - 12 -\n\n\nto tell the court his favorite present that he received the previous Christmas. (Tr. 15.)\nHe was able to relate his teachers’ names from the previous year and the current\nyear, as well as what grade he was in. (Tr. 16-17.) B.P.’s answers established that\nhe could not only accurately receive and recollect impressions of fact, but that he\ncould also relate those impressions truthfully.\n       {¶42} As for A.P., she also stated that she understood the need to tell the\ntruth in court. (Tr. 23.) As with B.P., she related that the consequences of not telling\nthe truth at home resulted in being spanked. (Tr. 23.)               She stated that she\nunderstood that the judge could put her in jail for not telling the truth in court. (Tr. 24.)\nShe understood that saying she was a boy or that the male assistant prosecutor was\na girl were examples of not being truthful. (Tr. 23.) She was able to relate what grade\nshe was in and the name of her teacher. (Tr. 24.) Like B.P., she was able to recall\nher favorite presents from last Christmas and her last birthday. (Tr. 26-27.) A.P.’s\nanswers reflected that she too could accurately receive and recollect impressions of\nfact, and relate those impressions truthfully.\n       {¶43} Accordingly, Stoffer’s second assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶44} Stoffer’s third assignment of error states:\n       {¶45} “THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO SEVER THE FIVE (5)\nCOUNTS OF THE SUPERCEDING [sic] INDICTMENT FOR PURPOSES OF\nTRIAL.”\n       {¶46} Stoffer argues that the trial court abused its discretion in joining the\ncounts for trial, contending that the factual situation of each crime was identical and\nnot easily capable of segregation. Stoffer also notes that the crimes involved the\nsame victim, factual situations, and witnesses. Stoffer argues that prejudice in joining\nthe counts was demonstrated by the assistant prosecutor suggesting to the jury in his\nopening statement that they should believe the two counts of gross sexual imposition\nbecause of the three pictures which gave rise to the three counts of illegal use of a\nminor in nudity-oriented material or performance.\n\f                                                                                    - 13 -\n\n\n        {¶47} In response, the state argues that Stoffer waived this alleged error\nbecause he did not request severance below in the trial court.\n        {¶48} Stoffer failed to move for separate trials after the grand jury issued the\nsuperseding indictment. As mentioned before, an appellant’s failure to raise an error\nin the trial court constitutes a waiver of that issue on appeal unless it rises to the level\nof plain error. State v. Underwood (1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 12, 13, 444 N.E.2d 1332.\nThus, this court reviews the trial court’s failure to grant separate trials for plain error.\n        {¶49} Crim.R. 8(A) provides that two or more offenses may be charged in the\nsame indictment if the offenses are (1) of the same or similar character, or (2) are\nbased on the same act or transaction, or (3) are based on two or more acts or\ntransactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan,\nor (4) are part of a course of criminal conduct.\n        {¶50} The law favors joining multiple criminal offenses in a single trial under\nCrim.R. 8(A). State v. Lott (1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293, 298.\nTwo or more offenses can be joined if they are of the same or similar character. State\nv. Torres (1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 343, 20 O.O.3d 313, 314-315, 421 N.E.2d 1288,\n1290.\n        {¶51} In this case, all of the offenses charged in Stoffer’s indictment were of\nthe same or similar character. The offenses charged were gross sexual imposition\nand illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance. Thus, it was\nproper to join all of the offenses in one indictment.\n        {¶52} Crim.R. 14 provides that if it appears that a defendant is prejudiced by a\njoinder of offenses in an indictment for trial, the court shall order an election or\nseparate trial of counts or provide such other relief as justice requires.\n        {¶53} If a defendant claims the court erred in refusing to allow separate trials\nof multiple charges, he has the burden of affirmatively showing that his rights were\nprejudiced. State v. Torres (1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 343, 421 N.E.2d 1288. “When\na defendant claims that he was prejudiced by the joinder of multiple offenses, a court\nmust determine (1) whether evidence of the other crimes would be admissible even if\n\f                                                                                  - 14 -\n\n\nthe counts were severed, and (2) if not, whether the evidence of each crime is simple\nand distinct.” State v. Schaim (1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 51, 59, 600 N.E.2d 661.\n       {¶54} In this case, the evidence of each crime was simple and distinct. The\nthree photographs were each taken within seconds of each other as evidenced by\nthe time stamp on each photograph.         A.P. testified that Stoffer had touched her\nbreasts and vagina, and that he had also taken pictures of those areas. Under these\ncircumstances, the trial court did not err in joining the five counts for trial. Nor is it\napparent that the outcome of the trial would clearly have been otherwise.\n       {¶55} Accordingly, Stoffer’s third assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶56} Stoffer’s fourth assignment of error states:\n       {¶57} “THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT ADMITTED INADMISSIBLE\nHEARSAY TESTIMONY OF DR. MCPHERSON.”\n       {¶58} Dr. Paul McPherson evaluated A.P. at the Tri-County Advocacy Center.\nAfter Dr. McPherson conducted a physical examination of A.P., Diane Russo, a\nsocial worker, interviewed A.P. in another room. Although not in the room where A.P.\nwas interviewed, Dr. McPherson watched the interview live via closed circuit\ntelevision. At trial, the court permitted Dr. McPherson, over objection, to testify about\nwhat A.P. told Russo. Dr. McPherson testified that A.P. told Russo that Stoffer had\nkissed her breasts, touched her private area which resulted in pain when she\nurinated, and that he went up and down while lying on top of her.\n       {¶59} Stoffer argues the Dr. McPherson’s testimony constituted hearsay and\nthat the trial court erred in allowing its admission. Stoffer contends that the only\npossible hearsay exception would be Evid.R. 803(4), concerning statements for\npurposes of medical diagnosis or treatment.         However, Stoffer argues that the\nexception does not apply here because Dr. McPherson was not in the room,\nremoving the guarantee of trustworthiness upon which the exception is based.\n       {¶60} In response, the state argues that the statements made by A.P. and\ntestified to by Dr. McPherson were made for purposes of medical treatment and,\ntherefore, fall within the hearsay exception set forth in Evid.R. 803(4).\n\f                                                                              - 15 -\n\n\n       {¶61} Evid.R. 803 provides certain exceptions to the hearsay rule. Evid.R.\n803(4) provides:\n       {¶62} “The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the\ndeclarant is available as a witness:\n       {¶63} “* * *\n       {¶64} “(4) Statements for Purposes of Medical Diagnosis or Treatment.\nStatements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing\nmedical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or\ngeneral character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably\npertinent to diagnosis or treatment.”\n       {¶65} When a child sex abuse victim is taken to an advocacy center, it is not\nuncommon for the child to be subject to a physical exam by a doctor separate from\nan interview conducted by a social worker. Nor is it uncommon for a doctor or others\nto view the interview via closed circuit television and then testify about what they\nheard during the interview at trial. Despite the contents of the interview constituting\nhearsay, the testimony is admissible under the hearsay exception set forth in Evid.R.\n803(4) as long as the interview was conducted for the purpose of medical diagnosis\nor treatment. State v. Griffith, 11th Dist. No. 2001-T-0136, 2003-Ohio-6980, ¶52-82.\nSee, also, State v. Gilfillan, 10th Dist. No. 08AP-317, 2009-Ohio-1104, ¶74-79; State\nv. Arnold, 10th Dist.

Edinger, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-\n31, 2006-Ohio-1527, ¶53-64.\n       {¶66} Moreover, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that “[s]tatements made to\ninterviewers at child-advocacy centers that are made for medical diagnosis and\ntreatment are nontestimonial and are admissible without offending the Confrontation\nClause.” (Emphasis added.) State v. Arnold, 126 Ohio St.3d 290, 2010-Ohio-2742,\n933 N.E.2d 775, paragraph two of the syllabus.\n       {¶67} In this case, Dr. McPherson testified as follows:\n\f                                                                                 - 16 -\n\n\n       {¶68} “Q.     Now is part of your job at the Tri-County Children’s Advocacy\nCenter to diagnose and treat victims of abuse?\n       {¶69} “A.     Yes. That’s our main clinical responsibility there.\n       {¶70} “Q.     And in order to achieve that responsibility is it important to obtain\nan accurate history from the patient?\n       {¶71} “A.     Yes, that is one of the big aspects of making a diagnosis of child\nsexual abuse, is the history that the child provides.\n       {¶72} “We also talk to the parents, or the non-offending caregiver, about any\nother medical conditions they may have that may confuse us.\n       {¶73} “We also do a physical exam on the child. And then afterwards we\nrecommend testing for sexually transmitted diseases, if we need to.            And then\ntypically recommend therapy.\n       {¶74} “Q.     Now did you see [A.P.] yourself, personally?\n       {¶75} “A.     Yes. I examined [A.P.] personally.\n       {¶76} “Q.     Do you also take a history, or are you present when a history is\nobtained?\n       {¶77} “A.     Yes, we take essentially two histories. I first talk to the caregiver\nthat brought the child in, and ask them basic medical history questions; medications\nthey’re on. Are they allergic to any medications? Have they injured their private\nparts previously, that required a visit to the doctor or hospital?\n       {¶78} “And then afterwards, the child herself was interviewed by Diane\nRusso, our social worker. During that interview I actually observe that in real time in\na different room, but via closed circuit television.\n       {¶79} “Q.     And do you use all of that information then to properly examine\nand diagnose the patient?\n       {¶80} “A.     Yes. Obtaining a history from the child is critical so we know\nwhat kind of exam we need to do, so, we know what kind of labs or test studies that\nwe need to do, as well. And then again, for mental health and therapy counseling,\n\f                                                                                 - 17 -\n\n\nwe need all of that information to make a diagnosis and proper management.” (Tr.\n245-246.)\n         {¶81} As the aforementioned testimony reveals, the statements A.P. made at\nthe Tri-County Advocacy Center, including those to Russo and observed in real time\nby Dr. McPherson via closed circuit television, were made for purposes of medical\ndiagnosis or treatment.\n         {¶82} Accordingly, Stoffer’s fourth assignment of error is without merit.\n         {¶83} Stoffer’s fifth assignment of error states:\n         {¶84} “THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING THE STATE’S MOTION\nIN      LIMINE   AS    FILED    ON     DECEMBER        9,    2008,   PREVENTING      THE\nDEFENDANT/APPELLANT FROM CALLING WITNESS KEMATS TO TESTIFY AS\nTO [A.P.’S] PRIOR ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE.”\n         {¶85} Stoffer proffered the testimony of Jamie Kemats, a guidance counselor\nat A.P.’s school. She testified that in January 2008 A.P.’s brother B.P. had reported\nthat another student touched A.P. in gym class. Kemats interviewed A.P. about the\nincident and confirmed B.P.’s report. The police were summoned and Kemats later\nlearned from the principal that the five-year-old offender admitted to the incident and\nwas removed from the school.\n         {¶86}   Because the incident was of the same nature and occurred around\nthe same time as the crimes charged in the superseding indictment, Stoffer argued\nthat the jury should know about it. The trial court determined that since the incident\nactually did occur, it fell within the rape shield statute and could not go before the\njury.\n         {¶87}   Ohio’s rape shield provision provides:\n         {¶88}   “Evidence of specific instances of the victim’s sexual activity, opinion\nevidence of the victim’s sexual activity, and reputation evidence of the victim’s sexual\nactivity shall not be admitted under this section unless it involves evidence of the\norigin of semen, pregnancy, or disease, or the victim’s past sexual activity with the\noffender, and only to the extent that the court finds that the evidence is material to a\n\f                                                                             - 18 -\n\n\nfact at issue in the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature does not\noutweigh its probative value.” R.C. 2907.05(E).\n       {¶89}   It is a well recognized constitutional principle that “(t)he rights to\nconfront and cross-examine witnesses and to call witnesses in one’s own behalf have\nlong been recognized as essential to due process.” Chambers v. Mississippi (1973),\n410 U.S. 284, 294-95, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297.\n       {¶90}   Several legitimate state interests are advanced by the shield law: (1)\nguarding the complainant’s sexual privacy and protecting them from undue\nharassment; (2) discouraging the tendency in rape cases to try the victim rather than\nthe defendant; (3) encouraging the reporting of rape, thus aiding crime prevention;\n(4) and aiding the truth-finding process by excluding evidence that is unduly\ninflammatory and prejudicial, while being only marginally probative. State v. Gardner\n(1997), 59 Ohio St.2d 14, 17-18, 391 N.E.2d 337.\n       {¶91}   In   determining   whether    the   rape    shield   law   has   been\nunconstitutionally applied in any particular instance, the court must thus balance the\nstate interest which the statute is designed to protect against the probative value of\nthe excluded evidence. State v. Gardner (1997), 59 Ohio St.2d 14, 17, 391 N.E.2d\n337.\n       {¶92}   Stoffer argues that the application of the rape shield law in his case\ninfringed on his ability to present a defense. Stoffer relies on In re Michael (1997),\n119 Ohio App.3d 112, 694 N.E.2d 538, in support. In Michael, a juvenile defendant\nwas adjudicated delinquent by reason of rape, attempted rape, and gross sexual\nimposition of an eight-year-old foster child who had been placed in his home and with\nwhom he shared a bedroom. At trial, a clinical psychologist who evaluated the victim\ntestified that there were three criteria he used to determine if a child had been\nsexually abused, one of which was the degree to which the child is conversant in\nsexual matters compared to “ordinary” children. Michael wanted to present evidence\nthat the victim had been sexually abused prior to being placed in his home and that\nanother person had been convicted of sexually abusing the victim in the identical\n\f                                                                                 - 19 -\n\n\nmanner in which he had been accused of sexually abusing the victim. On appeal,\nMichael argued that the trial court erred in applying the rape shield law to exclude\nthat evidence because it prevented him from showing an alternative source of the\nvictim’s knowledge of sexual conduct or activity.\n       {¶93}    In a matter of first impression for the Second District Court of Appeals,\nthe court observed that the average fact-finder would consider an eight-year-old to be\na “sexual innocent” and would be more likely to believe the sexual experience they\ndescribed in connection with the crime being prosecuted because they otherwise\ncould have not described it. The court found that because an expert (i.e., the clinical\npsychologist) had testified that the victim’s advanced knowledge of sexuality was an\nindicator of sexual abuse, it was probative for the jury to know that the victim had\npreviously been victimized in a similar manner by another because the victim was of\nsuch a young age that their knowledge of sexuality was inappropriate.\nConsequently, the court held that the exclusion of all evidence of a victim’s prior\nsexual abuse under those circumstances infringed on the defendant’s constitutional\nright to present a necessary and critical element of his defense and was\nunreasonable and constituted an abuse of discretion.            However, because the\ndefendant’s trial counsel was able to elicit testimony about the victim’s prior sexual\nabuse from cross-examination of the clinical psychologist and a children services\ncaseworker, the court effectively deemed it harmless error and affirmed the\nadjudication.\n       {¶94}    We disagree with Michael to the extent that it stands for the\nproposition that the rape shield law has any application to prior sexual abuse suffered\nby a child victim. In construing the rape shield statute, “our paramount concern is the\nlegislative intent” in enacting it. State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, 103 Ohio St.3d 355,\n2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, ¶21. To discern this intent, we must “read words\nand phrases in context according to the rules of grammar and common usage.” State\nex rel. Lee v. Karnes, 103 Ohio St.3d 559, 2004-Ohio-5718, 817 N.E.2d 76, ¶23.\nOhio’s rape shield law prohibits evidence of “specific instances of the victim’s sexual\n\f                                                                                  - 20 -\n\n\nactivity” unless one of four exceptions applies. The statute’s reference to “specific\ninstances of the victim’s sexual activity” connotes volitional activity by the victim with\nanother and not involuntary activity such as that which would stem from being\nsubjected to sexual abuse.\n       {¶95}     This interpretation of Ohio’s rape shield statute is supported by the\nGeneral Assembly’s use of the “victim’s sexual activity” throughout that provision.\nThe statute specifically prohibits opinion and reputation evidence of the victim’s\nsexual activity. Opinion and reputation evidence are methods of proving character.\nEvid.R. 405. Character is generally thought to include qualities, like honesty and\nintegrity,3 over which that person has control.               Therefore, when the General\nAssembly sought to protect a victim from opinion and reputation evidence, it was\ncontemplating evidence of a victim’s sexual history over which they had control.\n       {¶96}     The state interests identified by the Ohio Supreme Court in Gardner,\nsupra, which are advanced by the rape shield law also support this understanding of\nthe “victim’s sexual activity.” It is hoped that guarding the victim’s sexual privacy and\nprotecting them from undue harassment encourages the reporting of rape, thus\naiding crime prevention. Interpreting the rape shield statute to exclude evidence of\npast sexual abuse does not further these state interests. While sexual abuse victims\nmay very understandably be reluctant to disclose past instances of sexual abuse,\nthat discomfort is different from the undue harassment that rape shield statutes were\nenacted to protect against – undue harassment that may be caused by the revelation\nof one’s own history of questionable voluntary or consensual sexual activity.\n       {¶97}     The rape shield law also was intended to prevent a defendant from\nexploiting a victim’s sexual history to imply consent in the defendant’s case. State v.\nRay (June 11, 1992), 10th Dist. No. 91AP-1290. Since in this case defense counsel\nsought to introduce evidence that the victim had previously been sexually abused by\na person other than the defendant, such evidence cannot be similarly exploited by\n\n\n3. character. Dictionary.com. Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc.\nhttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/character (accessed: August 31, 2011).\n\f                                                                                    - 21 -\n\n\nthe defendant. Moreover, given that gross sexual imposition involving a victim under\nthe age of thirteen is a strict liability offense in Ohio, State v. Salinas, 10th Dist. No.\n09AP-1201, 2010-Ohio-4738, at ¶16, consent of the child victim be would unavailable\nas a defense. See R.C. 2907.05(D).\n       {¶98}    Based on the foregoing, we construe that the legislative intent of\nOhio’s rape shield law was to address only past consensual sexual activity of the\nvictim and not prior sexual abuse suffered by the victim. Therefore, the rape shield\nstatute has no application in this case and the trial court erred in applying it.\n       {¶99}    The question then becomes whether the exclusion of evidence of\nA.P.’s prior sexual abuse unconstitutionally infringed on Stoffer’s ability to present a\ndefense. The right of a criminal defendant to confront and cross-examine a witness\non relevant matters is secured in the Sixth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution. Delaware v. Van Arsdall (1986), 475 U.S. 673, 89 L.Ed.2d 674, 682-83.\nHowever, “trial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is\nconcerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on\nconcerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues,\nthe witness’ safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.”\n(Emphasis added.) Id.\n       {¶100} “Relevant evidence” is any evidence that tends to make the existence\nof any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less\nprobable than it would be without the evidence. Evid.R. 401. Generally, all relevant\nevidence is admissible. Evid.R. 402.         Relevant evidence may be inadmissible,\nhowever, if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\nprejudice. Evid.R. 403.\n       {¶101} In this case, evidence of the prior sexual abuse was not relevant. In\nhis opening statement, the prosecutor never suggested that A.P.’s age-inappropriate\nsexual knowledge was proof that that A.P. was telling the truth.              Rather, the\nprosecution relied on the photographs recovered from Stoffer’s digital camera\ndepicting A.P. in various stages of nudity in Stoffer’s bedroom to bolster A.P.’s\n\f                                                                             - 22 -\n\n\ncredibility. While Dr. McPherson did testify that A.P.’s sexual knowledge must have\nbeen derived from specific experiences, he also testified that she was\ndevelopmentally appropriate for her age:\n       {¶102} “Q. Would you please summarize for the jury the history that you\nprovided and relied upon in regards to [A.P.]?\n       {¶103} “A. Yes.       The history that we relied upon, apart from her past\nmedical history, was an interview of the child.\n       {¶104} “And when we interview children we do a couple of things; first of all\nwe want to make sure the child was developmentally appropriate, or that they\nunderstand their colors, they understand body parts, that they understand what\ninside and outside means. So we-- we make sure that the child is developmentally\nappropriate for her age. And [A.P.] was developmentally appropriate for her age.\n       {¶105} “Q. What’s the next step?\n       {¶106} “A. Then typically what we do is we make sure they understand\nbody parts, because children use different terms for body parts. We hear all kinds.\nAnd we wanted to make sure when she said something we knew what she meant.\nAnd so, she identified for us her private parts.\n       {¶107} “(Thereupon, Attorney McNicol marked for purposes of identification\nas State’s Exhibit Number 15, being two anatomical drawings.)\n       {¶108} “Q. (By Attorney McNicol.)           I’m going to hand you what I have\nmarked as State’s Exhibit Number 15.         Do you -- do you recognize those two\ndocuments?\n       {¶109} “A. Yes, I do.\n       {¶110} “Q. What are they?\n       {¶111} “A. These documents are-- are photocopied from the medical chart\nin which the originals are kept. And these are the, what we call anatomical drawings\nthat were used when, uh, [A.P.] was interviewed at our center.\n       {¶112} “Q. And there are some labeling on those documents, is there not?\n       {¶113} “A. Yes, there is.\n\f                                                                                   - 23 -\n\n\n       {¶114} “Q. What-- what is the labeling?\n       {¶115} “A. Uh, [A.P.] identified the female chest region as boobies; she\nidentified the vaginal area as the private spot. And then the anal region on the\nfemale as a butt. And then on the male anatomical drawing she identified the male\npenis as a private.\n       {¶116} “Q. Was she spoken to specifically about the -- the abuse involving\nthis Defendant, Mike?\n       {¶117} “A. Yes. When we-- when we interviewed her after we obtain that\nshe’s developmentally appropriate, and we understand what terms she uses for\nprivate parts, we give the child the opportunity to tell us what happened. And we do\nit in a way where we don’t make any presumptions. We want to make sure that\nsomeone hasn’t misunderstood the child, or the child said something that was really\nan innocent type of interaction. So, we approach the interview that way. We keep\nour mind open.\n       {¶118} “And then we also ask questions in a way where we’re not suggesting\nthe child anything, or we’re not putting things in the child’s mind.\n       {¶119} “And so by taking that type of approach we allow the child to tell us\ntheir story. * * *” (Tr. 246-249.)\n       {¶120} Dr. McPherson then went on to relate A.P.’s very specific statements\nconcerning Stoffer’s sexual abuse of her.\n       {¶121} Lastly, even though we have determined that it ultimately was not\nerror for the trial court to exclude the evidence of prior sexual abuse, albeit for\ndifferent reasons, its exclusion would otherwise have been harmless error. Unlike in\nMichael, here there was independent, physical evidence indicating that inappropriate\ncontact had occurred between A.P. and Stoffer. There was evidence presented that\nthree photographs were retrieved from Stoffer’s digital camera showing A.P. in\nvarious stages of nudity.\n       {¶122} Accordingly, Stoffer’s fifth assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶123} Stoffer’s sixth assignment of error states:\n\f                                                                                   - 24 -\n\n\n       {¶124} “THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN PERMITTING WITNESS GIBBS\nAND WITNESS DR. MCPHERSON TO TESTIFY AS EXPERTS.”\n       {¶125} Stoffer argues that despite not being qualified as an expert and the\nabsence of any finding that Dr. McPherson or JoAnn Gibbs was an expert, they\nnonetheless proceeded to state their opinion as such. Concerning Dr. McPherson,\nStoffer cites two examples of his testimony in support. First, Dr. McPherson testified\nthat it was his expert opinion that a seven year old would not know the details of the\nsexual contact that was alleged to have occurred unless she had experienced it. (Tr.\n250.) Second, Dr. McPherson opined that this was a case of sexual abuse within a\nreasonable degree of medical certainty. (Tr. 253.) Concerning JoAnn Gibbs, Stoffer\nrefers to her testimony about the retrieval and authentication of the pictures retrieved\nfrom his digital camera.\n       {¶126} In response, the state points out that Stoffer did not object to any of\nthe expert testimony and that their testimony nonetheless comported with Evid.R.\n702, the rule of evidence which governs expert testimony.          Because of Stoffer’s\nfailure to object to the testimony, the state contends that this assignment of error\nshould be reviewed only for plain error and that if there was any error it did not rise to\nthat level.\n       {¶127} Whether a witness is qualified to testify as an expert is a matter within\nthe trial court’s discretion. State v. Awkal (1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 324, 331. Therefore,\nwe will review a trial court’s decision to qualify a witness as an expert for abuse of\ndiscretion.\n       {¶128} Evid.R. 702 provides the qualifications a person must meet in order to\nbe qualified as an expert:\n       {¶129} “A witness may testify as an expert if all of the following apply:\n       {¶130} “(A) The witness’ testimony either relates to matters beyond the\nknowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception\ncommon among lay persons;\n\f                                                                                - 25 -\n\n\n         {¶131} “(B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge,\nskill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony;\n         {¶132} “(C) The witness’ testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical,\nor other specialized information. To the extent that the testimony reports the result of\na procedure, test, or experiment, the testimony is reliable only if all of the following\napply:\n         {¶133} “(1) The theory upon which the procedure, test, or experiment is\nbased is objectively verifiable or is validly derived from widely accepted knowledge,\nfacts, or principles;\n         {¶134} “(2) The design of the procedure, test, or experiment reliably\nimplements the theory;\n         {¶135} “(3) The particular procedure, test, or experiment was conducted in a\nway that will yield an accurate result.”\n         {¶136} Despite the trial court’s failure to make a specific finding that Dr.\nMcPherson was qualified to testify as an expert, he was nonetheless so qualified. He\ngraduated from medical school and trained in general pediatrics. (Tr. 244.)           He\ntrained an additional two years in specifically diagnosing and treating children who\nhave been abused. Id. By the time of trial, he had evaluated approximately fourteen-\nhundred children who were suspected of being abused. Id.\n         {¶137} Likewise, JoAnn Gibbs was qualified to testify as an expert.        She\ntestified that she was a certified forensic computer examiner by the International\nAssociation of Computer Investigative Specialists. (Tr. 270). She is also a certified\nelectronics evidence collection specialist, holding a Microsoft Certified Professional\nCertification. Id. She also testified that she had been through numerous schools\npertaining to the various software that they utilize at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal\nIdentification and Investigation. Id.\n         {¶138} Based on the testimony presented by Dr. McPherson and JoAnn\nGibbs concerning their professional qualifications, it cannot be said that any error in\n\f                                                                                  - 26 -\n\n\nthe trial court’s failure to make a specific finding that they were qualified to testify as\nexperts rose to the level of plain error.\n       {¶139} Accordingly, Stoffer’s sixth assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶140} Stoffer’s seventh assignment of error states:\n       {¶141} “THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING INTO EVIDENCE\nSTATE EXHIBITS 1 THROUGH 7 AS NO PROPER FOUNDATION WAS LAID NOR\nWAS EXPERT TESTIMONY APPROPRIATE.”\n       {¶142} Under this assignment of error, Stoffer reasserts his argument that he\nmade under the previous assignment of error that JoAnn Gibbs was not found to be\nan expert and, therefore, should not have been able to offer her expert opinion\nregarding the retrieval of the pictures from Stoffer’s digital camera.        Stoffer also\nargues that the state failed to lay a proper foundation for admission as evidence. In\nparticular, Stoffer takes issue with Gibbs subjecting the camera to analysis by “a\nmemory stick reader” and that she used “specialized forensic software.” (Brief of\nDefendant-Appellant, p. 25; Tr. 272, 274.) He also takes issue with Gibbs’s inability\nto verify the dates the photos were taken. (Tr. 281-282.)\n       {¶143} The admission of photographs into evidence at trial is a decision left\nto the sound discretion of the trial judge. State v. Smith, 97 Ohio St.3d 367, 2002-\nOhio-6659, 780 N.E.2d 221, ¶33.             Evid.R. 901 sets forth the requirements for\nauthenticating evidence, including photographic evidence: “The requirement of\nauthentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by\nevidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its\nproponent claims.” Pursuant to Evid.R. 901(B)(9), “[e]vidence describing a process\nor system used to produce a result and showing that the process or system produces\nan accurate result” is one example of authentication conforming to the rule’s\nrequirements.\n       {¶144} In this case, JoAnn Gibbs testified concerning the authentication of\nphotographs. Gibbs explained how she removed the memory stick from Stoffer’s\ndigital camera and inserted it into a memory stick reader. (Tr. 272.)           She then\n\f                                                                               - 27 -\n\n\nattached the memory stick reader to a write blocker device. (Tr. 272.) The write\nblocker device physically barricades the memory stick from the computer in such a\nway that the computer analyzing the memory stick cannot alter it in any way. (Tr.\n273.) Using her computer and specialized software, she then proceeded to take a\nforensic image of the memory stick. (Tr. 273.) The forensic image is a bit for bit copy\nof every sector on the memory stick. (Tr. 273.) Again with specialized software,\nGibbs was able to view everything on the memory stick, including deleted\nphotographic images. (Tr. 274.) It was from those images that Gibbs located the\nphotographs that formed the basis of the three counts of illegal use of a minor in\nnudity-oriented material or performance. (Tr. 275.) As for the date the photographs\nwere taken, Gibbs explained that the date information contained with the digital\nimage file was the date that was on the camera at the time the picture was taken. (Tr.\n277.)\n        {¶145} There is no dispute that the digital camera seized from Stoffer’s\nstorage unit was in fact his. As the above testimony illustrates, the state adduced\nsufficient testimony from Gibbs to authenticate or identify the images comprising\nExhibits 1 through 7 as duplicates of the images appearing on Stoffer’s digital\ncamera. In sum, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\nphotographs as evidence.\n        {¶146} Accordingly, Stoffer’s seventh assignment of error is without merit.\n        {¶147} Stoffer’s eighth and ninth assignments of error state, respectively:\n        {¶148} “THE       TRIAL     COURT        ERRED       WHEN       IT     DENIED\nDEFENDANT/APPELLANT’S CRIMINAL RULE 29 MOTION FOR JUDGMENT OF\nACQUITTAL; ALTERNATIVELY, THE DEFENDANT/APPELLANT’S CONVICTION\nIS BASED UPON INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND THEREFORE MUST BE\nREVERSED.”\n        {¶149} “THE DEFENDANT/APPELLANT’S CONVICTION IS AGAINST THE\nMANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.”\n\f                                                                                - 28 -\n\n\n       {¶150} Though sufficiency and manifest weight involve two different\nstandards of review, they will be discussed together for the sake of clarity and judicial\neconomy and because both call for a review of the evidence, and because Stoffer\nadvances the same arguments in support of each.\n       {¶151} Stoffer argues the conviction was based upon insufficient evidence\nand was against the manifest weight of the evidence because the evidence he\nheretofore argued was improperly admitted into evidence. He argues: (1) the digital\ncamera was illegally seized; (2) the children were not competent to testify; (3) the\nexperts were not properly qualified to testify; (4) impermissible hearsay was admitted;\n(5) the photographs were not properly authenticated; and (6) the court erroneously\nprohibited testimony concerning an alternative explanation for A.P.’s sexual\nknowledge.\n       {¶152} Sufficiency of the evidence is the legal standard applied to determine\nwhether the case may go to the jury or whether the evidence is legally sufficient as a\nmatter of law to support the jury verdict. State v. Smith (1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 113,\n684 N.E.2d 668. In essence, sufficiency is a test of adequacy. State v. Thompkins\n(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541. Whether the evidence is legally\nsufficient to sustain a verdict is a question of law. Id. In reviewing the record for\nsufficiency, the relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most\nfavorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\nelements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Smith, 80 Ohio St.3d at\n113, 684 N.E.2d 668.\n       {¶153} Alternatively,    a   weight-of-the-evidence    challenge    requires      an\nappellate court to review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable\ninferences, and consider the credibility of the witnesses. State v. Thompkins (1997),\n78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541.           In weighing the evidence and the\nreasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom, if there exists two fairly\nreasonable views of the evidence, the reviewing court cannot simply substitute its\njudgment for the jury and choose the one it finds more persuasive or believable.\n\f                                                                                - 29 -\n\n\nState v. Gore (1999), 131 Ohio App.3d 197, 201, 722 N.E.2d 125 (7th Dist.). In\nassessing the credibility of the witnesses, the reviewing court is guided by the\nprinciple that the credibility of the witnesses is primarily the responsibility and\nprovince of the jury. State v. DeHass (1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O. 366, 227\nN.E.2d 212. This is because the jury is in the best position to asses the credibility of\na trial witness based on their observations of the witnesses’ demeanor, gestures, and\nvoice inflections. Gore, 131 Ohio App.3d at 201, 722 N.E.2d 125, citing Seasons\nCoal Co., Inc. v. Cleveland (1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 10 OBR 408, 410, 461\nN.E.2d 1273, 1276.      In reviewing all of the evidence, a weight-of-the-evidence\nchallenge requires the reviewing court to determine if the greater amount of credible\nevidence supported the jury’s finding of guilt. State v. Thompkins (1997), 78 Ohio\nSt.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541.\n       {¶154} Reversal based on a successful weight-of-evidence challenge is\nreserved only for the exceptional case in which the evidence weighed so heavily\nagainst conviction that the jury clearly must have lost its way, creating a manifest\nmiscarriage of justice. Id. Indeed, reversing on weight of the evidence after a jury\ntrial is so extreme that it requires the unanimous vote of all three appellate judges\nrather than a mere majority vote. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d at 389, 678 N.E.2d 541,\nciting Section 3(B)(3), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution (noting that the power of the\ncourt of appeals is limited in order to preserve the jury's role with respect to issues\nsurrounding the credibility of witnesses).\n       {¶155} The two counts of gross sexual imposition will be addressed first.\nStoffer was convicted of two counts of gross sexual imposition in violation of R.C.\n2907.05(A)(4), which provides:\n       {¶156} “(A) No person shall have sexual contact with another, not the spouse\nof the offender; cause another, not the spouse of the offender, to have sexual contact\nwith the offender; or cause two or more other persons to have sexual contact when\nany of the following applies:\n       {¶157} “* * *\n\f                                                                                   - 30 -\n\n\n       {¶158} “(4) The other person, or one of the other persons, is less than\nthirteen years of age, whether or not the offender knows the age of that person.”\n       {¶159} “Sexual contact” is defined as “any touching of an erogenous zone of\nanother, including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if the\nperson is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either\nperson.” R.C. 2907.01(B).\n       {¶160} A rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat Stoffer twice had sexual contact with A.P. A.P. testified that Stoffer had used his\nhands to touch her “boobies” and her “wrong place.” This court has previously found\nsimilar testimony sufficient. See State v. Rhodes, 7th Dist. No. 99 BA 62, 2002-Ohio-\n1572 (where victim testified that the defendant testified that he put “his finger in her\nprivate.”)\n       {¶161} Stoffer’s conviction on the two counts of gross sexual imposition is\nalso supported by the weight of the evidence. In addition to A.P.’s own testimony, Dr.\nMcPherson testified to the statements A.P. made at the Tri-County Advocacy Center\nabout Stoffer touching her breasts and pubic regions. Additionally, Dr. McPherson\ntestified that, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, A.P. had been sexually\nabused. (Tr. 253.)\n       {¶162} Turning to the three counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented\nmaterial or performance, Stoffer was convicted of three counts of illegal use of a\nminor in nudity-oriented material or performance, in violation of R.C. 2907.323(A)(1),\nwhich provides:\n       {¶163} “(A) No person shall do any of the following:\n       {¶164} “(1) Photograph any minor who is not the person’s child or ward in a\nstate of nudity, or create, direct, produce, or transfer any material or performance that\nshows the minor in a state of nudity * * * [.]”\n       {¶165} A rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat Stoffer took the three nude pictures of A.P. found on his digital camera. A.P.\ntestified that Stoffer took a picture of her “boobies” and her “wrong place.” (Tr. 38.).\n\f                                                                               - 31 -\n\n\nTherefore, there was sufficient evidence to support Stoffer’s conviction on those\ncounts.\n       {¶166} Further the weight of the evidence supports Stoffer’s conviction on\nthose three counts. Dan Valentine testified about retrieving the digital camera from\nStoffer’s storage unit to which Stoffer voluntarily directed him. (Tr. 232-233.) Joann\nGibb testified about retrieving the images from Stoffer’s camera. In addition, Dr.\nMcPherson corroborated A.P.’s recounting of Stoffer taking the pictures of her in\nvarious stages of nudity. (Tr. 250.)\n       {¶167} Accordingly, Stoffer’s eighth and ninth assignments of error are\nwithout merit.\n       {¶168} Stoffer’s tenth assignment of error states:\n       {¶169} “THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO MERGE THE\nOFFENSES IN THE SUPERCEDING INDICTMENT FOR PURPOSES OF\nSENTENCING.”\n       {¶170} Stoffer argues that the two counts of gross sexual imposition were not\nallied offenses of similar import. He contends that there was no evidence presented\nto establish that the counts were committed at separate times or with separate\nanimus. Therefore, he concludes, the trial court’s sentence of five years in prison on\neach count to be served consecutively was contrary to law. Stoffer also contends\nthat three counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material were allied\noffenses of similar import. But since the trial court ordered concurrent sentences on\nthose convictions, Stoffer concedes that the sentences were permissible.\n       {¶171} In response, the state argues that the testimony of the victim\nestablished that there were at least two separate incidents which gave rise to the two\ncounts of gross sexual imposition.\n       {¶172} Stoffer failed to raise the issue of merger at sentencing and, therefore,\nwaived all but plain error. “Because an error related to merger affects a defendant’s\nright to protection from double jeopardy, and because an erroneous failure to merge\nconvictions inevitably causes a different outcome in a defendant's trial, the failure to\n\f                                                                                   - 32 -\n\n\nmerge convictions on allied offenses of similar import will almost always result in\nplain error.” State v. Haslam, 7th Dist. No. 08-MO-3, 2009-Ohio1663, at ¶ 62. Thus,\nif the court here failed to properly merge Stoffer’s convictions, the result is plain error.\n       {¶173} R.C. 2941.25 addresses the issue of merger and provides:\n       {¶174} “(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to\nconstitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information\nmay contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only\none.\n       {¶175} “(B) Where the defendant’s conduct constitutes two or more offenses\nof dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same\nor similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the\nindictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant\nmay be convicted of all of them.”\n       {¶176} Recently, in State v. Johnson, 128 Ohio St.3d 153, 942 N.E.2d 1061,\n2010-Ohio-6314, the Ohio Supreme Court adopted the new following approach to\ndetermination of allied offenses:\n       {¶177} “Under R.C. 2941.25, the court must determine prior to sentencing\nwhether the offenses were committed by the same conduct. Thus, the court need not\nperform any hypothetical or abstract comparison of the offenses at issue in order to\nconclude that the offenses are subject to merger.\n       {¶178} “In determining whether offenses are allied offenses of similar import\nunder R.C. 2941.25(A), the question is whether it is possible to commit one offense\nand commit the other with the same conduct, not whether it is possible to commit one\nwithout committing the other. Blankenship, 38 Ohio St.3d at 119, 526 N.E.2d 816\n(Whiteside, J., concurring) * * * If the offenses correspond to such a degree that the\nconduct of the defendant constituting commission of one offense constitutes\ncommission of the other, then the offenses are of similar import.\n       {¶179} “If the multiple offenses can be committed by the same conduct, then\nthe court must determine whether the offenses were committed by the same conduct,\n\f                                                                               - 33 -\n\n\ni.e., ‘a single act, committed with a single state of mind.’ Brown, 119 Ohio St.3d 447,\n2008-Ohio-4569, 895 N.E.2d 149, at ¶ 50 (Lanzinger, J., dissenting).\n       {¶180} “If the answer to both questions is yes, then the offenses are allied\noffenses of similar import and will be merged.\n       {¶181} “Conversely, if the court determines that the commission of one\noffense will never result in the commission of the other, or if the offenses are\ncommitted separately, or if the defendant has separate animus for each offense,\nthen, according to R.C. 2941.25(B), the offenses will not merge.” (Emphasis sic.) Id.\nat ¶47-41.\n       {¶182} Applying Johnson to this case, we address the first question –\nwhether it is possible to commit one offense and commit the other with the same\nconduct. Here, Stoffer’s two convictions for gross sexual imposition were both for\nviolations of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) and, therefore, contain identical elements. Thus, it is\npossible to commit one offense and commit the other with the same conduct. So, the\nanswer to the first question is yes.\n       {¶183} The second question is whether the offenses were committed by the\nsame conduct, i.e., a single act, committed with a single state of mind. Here, the\nrecord reveals two distinct acts of sexual misconduct defined by R.C. 2907.01(B):\ntouching the victim’s breasts and touching her pubic region. So, the answer to the\nsecond question is no.      Therefore, each offense charged constitutes a separate\noffense of gross sexual imposition, and the crimes do not constitute allied offenses of\nsimilar import which must be merged for conviction.\n       {¶184} Other districts are in accord. In State v. Moralevitz (1980), 70 Ohio\nApp.2d 20, 24 O.O.3d 16, 433 N.E.2d 1280 the defendant was charged with three\ncounts of gross sexual imposition: placing his finger between the victim’s legs, putting\nhis hand upon the victim’s chest, and putting his tongue between the victim’s legs.\nThe Eighth District concluded that the acts occurred consecutively, determining that\nthey were not allied offenses, “just as the commission of anal rape after vaginal rape\nconstituted the commission of separate offenses in State v. Ware (1977), 53 Ohio\n\f                                                                               - 34 -\n\n\nApp.2d 210, 211 [judgment affirmed (1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 84] * * *.” Id. at 28. See,\nalso, State v. Austin (2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 547, 741 N.E.2d 927 discretionary\nappeal not allowed, 90 Ohio St.3d 1472, 738 N.E.2d 383 (3d Dist.) (concluding that\ntouching of the victim’s breast with defendant’s hand and kissing the victim’s breast\nwith his mouth did not indicate a single, simultaneous incident; rather the acts\noccurred separately but in close proximity of time during the same extended assault\nof the victim).\n       {¶185} Applying that same analysis to the three counts of illegal use of a\nminor in nudity-oriented material or performance leads to the same conclusion. The\nfirst question is whether it is possible to commit one offense and commit the other\nwith the same conduct. Here, Stoffer’s three convictions of illegal use of a minor in\nnudity-oriented material or performance were all for violations of R.C. 2907.323(A)(1)\nand, therefore, contain identical elements. Thus, it is possible to commit one offense\nand commit the other with the same conduct. So, the answer to the first question is\nyes.\n       {¶186} The second question is whether the offenses were committed by the\nsame conduct, i.e., a single act, committed with a single state of mind. Here, the\nrecord reveals three distinct acts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material\nor performance. Three separate pictures showing A.P. in various stages of nudity\nwere retrieved from Stoffer’s digital camera. While they may have been taken within\nseconds of each other, all three pictures were taken separately and at distinctly\ndifferent times.   So, the answer to the second question is no.        Therefore, each\noffense charged constitutes a separate offense of illegal use of a minor in nudity-\noriented material or performance, and the crimes do not constitute allied offenses of\nsimilar import which must be merged for conviction.\n       {¶187} Accordingly, Stoffer’s tenth assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶188} Stoffer’s eleventh assignment of error states:\n       {¶189} “THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IMPOSING CONSECUTIVE\nSENTENCES UPON DEFENDANT/APPELLANT.”\n\f                                                                               - 35 -\n\n\n      {¶190} Stoffer acknowledges the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision in State v.\nFoster, 109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, removing the requirement\nof specific findings for imposition of consecutive sentences.        However, Stoffer\nmaintains that the underlying legislative policy remains intact. Stoffer argues that the\ntrial court’s reasons for imposing consecutive sentences should be clear from the\nrecord in order to allow for a meaningful appellate review.\n      {¶191} Regardless of the “policy” argument advanced by Stoffer, this court is\nleft only with what remains of Ohio’s felony sentencing law and is bound by the Ohio\nSupreme Court’s decisions in that regard.        Prior to the Ohio Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Foster, the trial court was required to make certain findings in order to\nsentence an offender to consecutive sentences. R.C. 2929.14(E).            However, in\nFoster, the Court found that provision unconstitutional because it statutorily required\n“judicial fact-finding before imposition of a sentence greater than the maximum term\nauthorized by a jury verdict or admission of the defendant.” Id. at paragraph one of\nthe syllabus. As a remedy, Foster severed the provision in its entirety from the\nstatute. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.     Now, a sentencing court has “full\ndiscretion” to sentence an offender within the statutory range and is no longer\nrequired to make findings or give its reasons for imposing non-minimum, maximum,\nor consecutive sentences. Id. at paragraph seven of the syllabus. A sentencing court\nneed only consider “R.C. 2929.11, which specifies the purposes of sentencing, and\nR.C. 2929.12, which provides guidance in considering factors relating to the\nseriousness of the offense and recidivism of the offender.” State v. Mathis, 109 Ohio\nSt.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, 846 N.E.2d 1, at ¶38.\n      {¶192} Accordingly, Stoffer’s eleventh assignment of error is without merit.\n      {¶193} Stoffer’s twelfth assignment of error states:\n      {¶194} “THE       DEFENDANT/APPELLANT’S             SENTENCE        WAS      NOT\nPROPORTIONAL RELATIVE TO THE DEFENDANT’S CONDUCT LEADING TO\nTHE CHARGES AND THEREFORE THE SENTENCES ARE CONTRARY TO LAW.”\n\f                                                                                - 36 -\n\n\n       {¶195} Stoffer argues that although the Ohio Supreme Court in State v.\nFoster, 109 Ohio St.3d 1, 845 N.E.2d 470, 2006-Ohio-856, determined that R.C.\n2929.14(E) was unconstitutional, the trial court should still engage in a proportionality\nanalysis in furtherance of the statutory policy underlying that section. He contends\nthere is nothing in the record to support a conclusion that the sentence was\nproportionate to his conduct.\n       {¶196} R.C. 2929.14(E) provided that before a court could sentence an\noffender to consecutive sentences that the trial court was required to find that\nconsecutive sentences were “necessary to protect the public from future crime or to\npunish the offender and that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the\nseriousness of the offender’s conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the\npublic.” The court was also required to find that one of the three factors in R.C.\n2929.14(E)(4)(a), (b), or (c) was applicable. The trial court was then required to\nprovide reasons supporting its findings. R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(c).\n       {¶197} Again, Stoffer concedes that under Foster the trial court is no longer\nrequired to making findings under R.C. 2929.14(E). 109 Ohio St.3d 1, 845 N.E.2d\n470, 2006-Ohio-856, paragraph three of the syllabus. After severing that section\nfrom the statute, the Ohio Supreme Court then held that a sentencing court has “full\ndiscretion” to sentence an offender within the statutory range and is no longer\nrequired to make findings or give its reasons for imposing non-minimum, maximum,\nor consecutive sentences. Id. at paragraph seven of the syllabus. A sentencing court\nneed only consider “R.C. 2929.11, which specifies the purposes of sentencing.” “R.C.\n2929.12, which provides guidance in considering factors relating to the seriousness\nof the offense and recidivism of the offender,” and any other statutes that are specific\nto the case. State v. Mathis, 109 Ohio St.3d 54, 846 N.E.2d 1, 2006-Ohio-855, ¶ 38.\nConsequently, the trial court was not required to engage in the proportionality\nanalysis espoused in R.C. 2929.14(E).\n       {¶198} Accordingly, Stoffer’s twelfth assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶199} Stoffer’s thirteenth assignment of error states:\n\f                                                                                - 37 -\n\n\n       {¶200} “DEFENDANT/APPELLANT’S SENTENCES ARE CONTRARY TO\nLAW AS THEY DO NOT SERVE THE OVERRIDING PURPOSES AND\nPRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING AS EXPRESSED IN ORC 2929.11.”\n       {¶201} Under this assignment of error, Stoffer argues that imposition of\nmaximum and consecutive sentences regarding the two counts of gross sexual\nimposition was not consistent with the purposes of felony sentencing set forth in R.C.\n2929.11(A) to adequately protect the public and punish the offender. He posits that\nthe trial court’s imposition of consecutive sentences was not commensurate with the\nseriousness of his conduct and that the sentences do not comply with purposes of\nfelony sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11(B). Again, he argues that the record is\nlacking for a meaningful appellate review.\n       {¶202} Appellate review of felony sentences is a very limited, two-fold\napproach, as outlined by the plurality opinion of the Ohio State Supreme Court in\nState v. Kalish, 120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124, at ¶26. The\nfirst step requires appellate courts to “examine the sentencing court’s compliance\nwith all applicable rules and statutes in imposing the sentence to determine whether\nthe sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law.” Id. (O’Connor, J., plurality\nopinion). In examining “all applicable rules and statutes,” the sentencing court must\nconsider R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12. Id. at ¶13-14 (O’Connor, J., plurality\nopinion).    If the sentence is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law, the\nsentencing court’s exercise of discretion “in selecting a sentence within the\npermissible statutory range is subject to review for any abuse of discretion.” Id. at ¶17\n(O’Connor, J., plurality opinion). Thus, an abuse of discretion is used to determine\nwhether the sentence satisfies R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12. Id. at ¶17 (O’Connor,\nJ., plurality opinion).\n       {¶203} A sentencing court must consider the principles and purposes of\nsentencing in R.C. 2929.11 and the seriousness and recidivism factors in R.C.\n2929.12. State v. Mathis, 109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, ¶38. The trial court in\nthis case did not discuss the statutory principles and factors either at the sentencing\n\f                                                                                - 38 -\n\n\nhearing or in the sentencing entry. However, the sentencing court need not make\nfindings regarding these statutes. This court has held that a silent record raises the\nrebuttable presumption that the sentencing court considered the statutory sentencing\ncriteria. State v. James, 7th Dist. No.07CO47, 2009-Ohio-4392, ¶50, citing State v.\nAdams (1988), 37 Ohio St .3d 295 and applying footnote from Kalish, 120 Ohio St.3d\n23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124. Only if the record affirmatively shows that the\ntrial court failed to consider the principles and purposes of sentencing will a sentence\nbe reversed on this basis, unless the sentence is strikingly inconsistent with relevant\nconsiderations. Id.\n       {¶204} The record does not affirmatively show that the court refused to\nconsider the proper principles and factors. Nor is the sentence strikingly inconsistent\nwith the pertinent considerations. In sum, Stoffer’s sentence fell within the statutory\nrange and was not clearly and convincingly contrary to law. Nor did the trial court’s\napplication of R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12 to Stoffer’s sentence constitute an\nabuse of discretion.\n       {¶205} Accordingly, Stoffer’s thirteenth assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶206} Stoffer’s fourteenth assignment of error states:\n       {¶207} “THE      TRIAL     COURT’S       IMPOSITION       OF     CONSECUTIVE\nSENTENCES IN THE PRESENT CASE IS CONTRARY TO LAW AND/OR\nVIOLATES THE MANDATES OF ORC 2929.13(A).”\n       {¶208} Stoffer argues that the trial court made no finding that the imposition\nof consecutive sentences would not impose an unnecessary burden on state or local\ngovernment resources, citing R.C. 2929.13(A). Without further explanation, Stoffer\nargues that it is “clear” in this case that the sentences imposed did “in fact” impose an\nunnecessary burden on state and local government resources.\n       {¶209} R.C. 2929.13(A) provides that a felony “sentence shall not impose an\nunnecessary burden on state or local government resources.”\n       {¶210} “Just what constitutes a ‘burden’ on state resources is undefined by\nthe statute, but the plain language suggests that the costs, both economic and\n\f                                                                                - 39 -\n\n\nsocietal, should not outweigh the benefit that the people of the state derive from an\noffender’s incarceration. Some have argued that in cases where the multiple life tails\nmight be involved, incarceration of aged offenders who require the kind of nursing\ncare needed by elderly people might place a burden on the state’s resources. Of\ncourse this is true, but it is only one type of cost associated with incarceration. The\ncourt must also consider the benefit to society in assuring that an offender will not be\nfree to reoffend. Many people sleep better at night knowing that certain offenders are\nincarcerated. They would no doubt consider a lengthy incarceration worth the cost of\nhousing those offenders.” State v. Vlahopoulos, 154 Ohio App.3d 450, 2003-Ohio-\n5070, 797 N.E.2d 580, at ¶5.\n       {¶211} As mentioned, Stoffer has provided no explanation or evidence that\nthe sentence the trial court imposed would create an unnecessary burden on state or\nlocal government resources. Given the nature of the crimes perpetrated by Stoffer\nagainst his child-victim, it cannot be said that the public, and primarily its safety,\nwould not benefit from having Stoffer incarcerated for fifteen years.\n       {¶212} Accordingly, Stoffer’s fourteenth assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶213} Stoffer’s fifteenth assignment of error states:\n       {¶214} “DEFENDANT/APPELLANT WAS DENIED A FAIR TRIAL DUE TO\nTHE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ERRORS AS SET FORTH HEREIN.”\n       {¶215} Stoffer argues that due to the cumulative effect of the errors he\nalleged occurred in this case, he was denied a fair trial and substantive due process.\nHe requests dismissal of all the charges against him and discharge from prison or, at\nthe very least, a new trial.\n       {¶216} “The cumulative error doctrine refers to a situation in which the\nexistence of multiple errors, which may not individually require reversal, may violate a\ndefendant’s right to a fair trial. To affirm a conviction in spite of multiple errors, we\nmust determine that the cumulative effect of the errors is harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt. The errors may be considered harmless if there is overwhelming\nevidence of guilt, if Appellant’s substantial rights were not affected, or if there are\n\f                                                                               - 40 -\n\n\nother indicia that the errors did not contribute to the conviction.” (Internal citations\nomitted.) State v. Anderson, 7th Dist. No. 03-MA-252, 2006-Ohio-4618, at ¶80.\n      {¶217} As discussed above, the errors Stoffer alleges do not have merit,\nharmless or otherwise. Thus, no cumulative error exists.\n      {¶218} Accordingly, Stoffer’s fifteenth assignment of error is without merit.\n      {¶219} The judgment of the trial court is hereby affirmed.\n\nVukovich, J., concurs.\n\nDeGenaro, J., concurs.\n\f",

One\nof their adult children, a son, and his wife have three children – T.P. (12 y.o.a.), A.P.\n(7 y.o.a.), and B.P. (6 y.o.a.).2 (Tr. 353, 386.)               The children’s parents became\ninvolved in “street” drugs and Tom and Sue took legal and physical custody (by\nagreement) of those three grandchildren in 2002. (Tr. 353-354.) Sue does not work\noutside the home, but cares for the children on a daily basis. (Tr. 371.)\n        {¶3}    In 2007, Tom’s friend, Stoffer, came to them in need of a place to stay\nfollowing an accident and injury. (Tr. 354.) Tom had been friends with Stoffer since\ngrade school. (Tr. 386.) They rented a bedroom in their home to him for $75 a\nmonth. (Tr. 355.)\n        {¶4}    Stoffer was not working, but received VA benefits. (Tr. 387-388.)\nStoffer regularly took part in family gatherings and spent a lot of time with the\ngrandchildren, and was generally treated as part of the family. (Tr. 349, 372, 376-\n377, 403, 474-476.) A.P. and B.P. would spend time with Stoffer in his room. (Tr.\n361-362, 372.) Stoffer kept a computer and digital camera in the room. (Tr. 360, 393,\n476.) He would let them play games on his computer and allowed A.P. to use the\ncamera. A guitar which A.P.’s father had given her for her birthday was kept on a\nshelf in the closet in his room out of her reach. (Tr. 365-366, 453.)\n        {¶5}    Another of Tom and Sue’s five children, Karen, lives in her own home\ndirectly behind her parents. (Tr. 342.) She has two children of her own, two young\nboys – a 4-year-old and a 5-year-old. (Tr. 343.)                     Since they were next door\nneighbors, Karen’s children would often play with T.P., A.P., and B.P. (Tr. 343.)\n\n\n1. Tom and Sue’s last name has been withheld to protect the identity of the child victim in this case.\n2. The children’s stated ages were their ages at the time of trial.\n\f                                                                              -3-\n\n\nKaren and her children would spend time in her parents’ house and in turn, Karen\nwould occasionally watch all of the children at her house when her mother went out\nto the store or on errands. (Tr. 343, 346.)\n       {¶6}   On July 2, 2008, the kids had been playing outside and then went into\nKaren’s house to watch cartoons. (Tr. 343.) As she was in the kitchen doing dishes,\nKaren overheard the children’s conversation. (Tr. 343.) A.P. asked Karen’s 5-year-\nold boy to take his shirt off and then asked him to take his pants off. (Tr. 344.) She\nthen giggled and told him she was just kidding. (Tr. 344.) When Karen asked A.P.\nwhy she had asked the 5-year-old to take his pants off, she replied that she was only\nkidding. (Tr. 344.) At that point, B.P. spoke up and said he had seen Stoffer and A.P.\nkissing. (Tr. 344-345.) When Sue returned from the store, Karen told Sue that she\nneeded to have a talk with A.P. (Tr. 345.)\n       {¶7}   After talking with A.P., Sue had serious concerns about what had\noccurred between A.P. and Stoffer and phoned Tom at work to relay those concerns\nto him. (Tr. 356-357, 389.) Tom left work early and returned home. (Tr. 389.) Tom\nconfronted Stoffer and told him he had heard that he was “messing” with his\ngranddaughter. (Tr. 390.) Stoffer responded that he would never do anything like\nthat. (Tr. 390.) Tom then brought A.P. to Stoffer and had her recite the allegations to\nhim. (Tr. 391.) He again denied the allegations, but then indicated that he might\nhave pulled her pants down but forgot and that he had picked her up by her feet and\nher underwear had fallen off. (Tr. 391.)\n       {¶8}   Sue went to the Columbiana County Department of Job and Family\nServices on July 7, 2008, to report what had occurred. (Tr. 315.) Laurie Jones, an\ninvestigator with that department, went to Tom and Sue’s home the following day to\nassess the safety of the children. (Tr. 315-316.) Since Tom and Sue had asked\nStoffer to leave the home and believed A.P.’s story, Jones determined that A.P. was\nsafe. (Tr. 316.)\n       {¶9}   Jones returned to Tom and Sue’s home on July 18, 2008 for a follow-up\nvisit. (Tr. 316.)   This time, she was accompanied by Dan Valentine, a part-time\n\f                                                                              -4-\n\n\nconstable for the Salem Township Police Department. (Tr. 316.) Jones interviewed\nT.P. and B.P. (Tr. 316.) Valentine interviewed and took statements from Sue and\nKaren. (Tr. 226.) A.P. was not formally interviewed and was instead scheduled to be\nseen at Tri-County Advocacy Center in Youngstown, Ohio. (Tr. 243, 316-317.) The\ncenter is a medical clinic in which children who are suspected of being abused are\nmedically evaluated. (Tr. 243.)\n       {¶10} A.P. was evaluated at the center on July 22, 2008 by Dr. Paul\nMcPherson. (Tr. 245.)      After he obtained her medical history, A.P. was then\ninterviewed by the center’s social worker, Diana Russo. (Tr. 346.) Dr. McPherson\nand Laurie Jones observed the interview as it took place via closed circuit television.\n(Tr. 246, 251, 317.) During the interview, A.P. disclosed that Stoffer had kissed her\n“boobies.” (Tr. 249.) She also said that Stoffer touched her “private area” and that it\nhurt after she “peed.” (Tr. 249.) She also explained the Stoffer put her hand on his\n“private part” over his clothes and that Stoffer got on top of her and moved up and\ndown on her with his clothes on. (Tr. 250.) For the first time, she also revealed that\nStoffer had taken pictures of her “boobies” and “private spot.” (Tr. 250.)\n       {¶11} Valentine subsequently located Stoffer at a motel in North Lima. North\nLima is located in Beaver Township, Mahoning County, Ohio, where Valentine is also\na full-time police officer with the rank of corporal. (Tr.223.) Valentine obtained a\nsearch warrant for Stoffer’s room in hopes of locating his computer and digital\ncamera. (Tr. 228.) Valentine, along with other members of the Beaver Township\nPolice Department and Laurie Jones, executed the warrant on July 25, 2008.\n(11/07/2008 Suppression Hearing Tr. 8, Trial Tr. 228.) When it was apparent that\nthere were very few personal items of Stoffer’s found in the room or his vehicle,\nStoffer was asked where his belongings were and he indicated that they were in a\nstorage unit. (Tr. 232.) Stoffer gave the police consent to search the unit and they\nrecovered the camera they were looking for. (Tr. 232-233.)\n       {¶12} Valentine forwarded the camera to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal\nIdentification and Investigation. (Tr. 234.) There, forensic specialist Joann Gibb was\n\f                                                                              -5-\n\n\nable to view numerous pictures which had been deleted from the camera. (Tr. 274.)\nThree of these pictures showed A.P. in various stages of nudity in Stoffer’s room at\nTom and Sue’s house. (Tr. 237-238, 275.)\n      {¶13} On August 20, 2008, a Columbiana County grand jury indicted Stoffer\non two counts of gross sexual imposition, in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4), third-\ndegree felonies, and three counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material\nor performance, in violation of R.C. 2907.323(A)(1), second-degree felonies. Stoffer\npleaded not guilty, the court appointed him counsel, and the case proceeded to\ndiscovery and other pretrial matters.\n      {¶14} One of those pretrial matters which is relevant in this appeal is a motion\nto suppress filed by Stoffer on October 31, 2008. Stoffer argued that no search\nwarrant had been provided in discovery and that if a search warrant was issued there\nwas no probable cause to justify its issuance. He also argued that no consent to\nsearch form had been provided in discovery and that if there was one, his consent\nwas not validly obtained.\n      {¶15} The trial court held a hearing on the motion on November 7, 2008. The\nstate presented the testimony of Valentine who testified about the execution of the\nsearch warrant and Stoffer’s consent to search the storage unit and subsequent\nconsent to search the memory of the computer and digital camera that were seized.\n      {¶16} On November 10, 2008, the trial court denied Stoffer’s motion to\nsuppress. The court reasoned that Stoffer was cooperative and voluntarily signed\nboth consent forms and voluntarily led the police officers to the camera and admitted\nthat the camera was his. The court found that there was no evidence of revocation of\nany consents or any coercion or threats employed to get Stoffer to sign the consent\nforms or to make the admissions that he did.\n      {¶17} On November 25, 2008, a Columbiana County grand jury returned a\nsuperseding indictment charging Stoffer with the same offenses as before but adding\nthe mental state of purposely to the two counts of gross sexual imposition and adding\n\f                                                                                -6-\n\n\nthe mental state of recklessly to the three counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-\noriented material or performance.\n       {¶18} The case proceeded to a jury trial on December 8, 2008. After initial\ninstructions, a jury view of Tom and Sue’s home was conducted, in particular the\nroom Stoffer rented while he was there and where the pictures that formed the basis\nof the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance counts were\ntaken. The state presented the testimony of those who investigated the case: Laurie\nJones, the investigator with the Columbiana County Department of Job and Family\nService who first interviewed A.P.’s family and who witnessed the formal interview at\nthe Tri-County Advocacy group; Dan Valentine, the part-time constable of Salem\nTownship where the crimes occurred and a full-time police officer in Beaver\nTownship where Stoffer was located and where the digital camera was recovered\nwhich yielded the pictures that formed the basis of the illegal use of a minor in nudity-\noriented material or performance counts; Dr. Paul McPherson, who evaluated A.P. at\nthe Tri-County Advocacy Center; and Joann Gibb, the forensic specialist with the\nOhio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation that recovered the illicit\npictures from Stoffer’s digital camera. The state also presented the testimony of A.P.\nand her family, including her grandparents, Tom and Sue, her aunt Karen, and her\nbrother, B.P. Various pictures including the three nude pictures taken of A.P. were\nadmitted as evidence. Stoffer testified in his own defense. He described how A.P.’s\npants may have fell down while playing, explained that he only gave the children\n“goodnight” kisses, and denied rubbing up against A.P. or taking nude pictures of\nher.\n       {¶19} On December 9, 2008, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all five\ncounts contained in the indictment. On December 17, 2008, the trial court sentenced\nStoffer to five years in prison on each of the gross sexual imposition counts to be\nserved consecutively to each other and five years in prison on each of the illegal use\nof a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance counts to be served\nconcurrently with each other but consecutively with the sentence for the gross sexual\n\f                                                                              -7-\n\n\nimposition counts for an aggregate sentence of fifteen years. The trial court also\ndesignated Stoffer a Tier II Sex Offender/Child Victim Offender pursuant to R.C.\nChapter 2950, and was advised of his duty to register under the statute. This appeal\nfollowed.\n       {¶20} Stoffer raises fifteen assignments of error. Stoffer’s first assignment of\nerror states:\n       {¶21} “THE          TRIAL    COURT      ERRED        IN     DENYING        THE\nDEFENDANT/APPELLANT’S MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE[.]”\n       {¶22} Stoffer contends that when the police officers executed the search\nwarrant at his hotel room he was placed in handcuffs. When they were unable to\nlocate the digital camera they were looking for and questioned him about its location,\nhe revealed that it was in a storage unit. Stoffer characterizes the encounter as a\ncustodial interrogation.    Since the police did not read him his Miranda rights, he\nargues that his revelation about the location of the digital camera and the pictures\nrecovered from it are physical evidence obtained as a result of unwarned statements\nand, thus, are inadmissible.\n       {¶23} In response, the state points out that in his motion to suppress and at\nthe hearing on the motion Stoffer never challenged the evidence on the basis of the\npolice officer’s failure to read him his Miranda rights. The state contends the hearing\nwas confined to whether there was an unreasonable search and seizure (i.e.\nwarrantless) and whether there was valid consent given by Stoffer.\n       {¶24} This court has observed that a defendant’s failure to raise an issue in a\nmotion to suppress constitutes a waiver of that issue on appeal. State v. Roskovich,\n7th Dist. No. 04 BE 37, 2005-Ohio-2719, ¶13, citing State v. Peagler (1996), 76 Ohio\nSt.3d 496, 500, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. A review of Stoffer’s motion to suppress reveals\nthat the Miranda issue was not raised in the motion. The motion set forth only two\nspecific grounds. The first was that the state had failed to produce a search warrant\nin discovery and that there was no probable cause to justify the search. The second\nwas that no valid consent to search was given by Stoffer. At the hearing on the\n\f                                                                                 -8-\n\n\nmotion, the only person to testify was Officer Dan Valentine. During his testimony,\nthe state provided Stoffer’s attorney with a copy of the search warrant and a copy of\nthe consent to search form.         Stoffer’s attorney’s cross-examination of Valentine\nsimply focused on who was present when the warrant and consent to search were\npresented to Stoffer and whether the consent-to-search form was explained to him.\nSince Stoffer never raised the Miranda issue below either in his motion or at the\nhearing on the motion, he waived that issue on appeal.\n       {¶25} We are left only to examine the propriety of the trial court’s decision\nbased on the two grounds that were presented to it in Stoffer’s suppression motion.\nThe standard of review in an appeal of a suppression issue is two-fold.

This\ndetermination is a question of law of which an appellate court cannot give deference\nto the trial court’s conclusion. Id., citing Lloyd.\n       {¶26} The first ground set forth in Stoffer’s suppression motion was that the\nstate had failed to produce a search warrant in discovery and that there was no\nprobable cause to justify the search. At the suppression hearing, the prosecutor\nprovided Stoffer’s defense counsel with a copy of the search warrant. In addition,\nOfficer Valentine testified that Stoffer was present at the motel when they went to\nexecute the warrant and that Stoffer was given a copy of the search warrant at that\ntime. (11/07/2008 Suppression Hearing Tr. 9-10, 17.)               Moreover, the only\nincriminating physical evidence there was in this case was Stoffer’s digital camera\n\f                                                                                  -9-\n\n\nand the images retrieved from it. The search warrant was limited to Stoffer’s motel\nroom and his vehicle. The digital camera was not retrieved from either of those\nlocations, but from a storage unit Stoffer had rented nearby. Since there was a\nsigned written consent by Stoffer to search that unit, the underlying probable cause\nfor the search warrant, which did not yield any incriminating evidence, was irrelevant.\n       {¶27} That brings us to the second ground set forth in the suppression motion\nwhich was that no valid consent to search was given by Stoffer.            Again, Officer\nValentine was the only person to testify at the suppression hearing. Stoffer did not\ntestify. Officer Valentine testified that Stoffer executed a written consent to search\nthe storage unit where the digital camera was located. (11/07/2008 Suppression\nHearing Tr. 11-12.) Stoffer opened the storage unit himself, was present the entire\ntime the officers searched it, and at no time revoked his consent. (11/07/2008\nSuppression Hearing Tr. 11-12.) Based on the evidence presented, we agree with\nthe trial court’s conclusion that Stoffer gave valid consent to police to search the\nstorage unit.\n       {¶28} Based on the foregoing and limited to the two grounds raised by\nStoffer’s suppression motion, the trial court did not err in overruling the motion.\n       {¶29} Accordingly, Stoffer’s first assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶30} Stoffer’s second assignment of error states:\n       {¶31} “THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING [B.P.] COMPETENT TO\nTESTIFY AND IN FINDING [A.P.] COMPETENT TO TESTIFY.”\n       {¶32} Stoffer contends that pursuant to Evid.R. 601(A) a child witness under\nthe age of ten is not competent to testify if they appear incapable of receiving or\nrelating facts properly. Stoffer points out that A.P.’s brother, B.P., who was six years\nold when he testified at the November 26, 2008 voir dire on the issue of competence,\nincorrectly stated that the next day would be Christmas. Stoffer states that B.P. also\ntestified that he did not know his address, his birthday, his grandmother’s name, what\nschool he attended, what grade he was in, what grade he was in the previous year,\n\f                                                                                 - 10 -\n\n\nand what house he lived in the previous year.         Stoffer also points out that B.P.\ndescribed trips to the county fair and to a park as his vacation.\n        {¶33} As for A.P., Stoffer contends her age at the time of voir dire was never\nestablished and that she did not know her own birthday or the name of her teacher\nfrom the previous year.\n        {¶34} In response, the state maintains that the trial court properly determined\nthrough the questioning of the children that they were capable of receiving just and\ntruthful impressions of facts and events and that they were able to accurately relate\nthem.    Nevertheless, the state argues that since Stoffer never objected to the\nintroduction of the children’s testimony any error arising therefrom does not rise to\nthe level of plain error.\n        {¶35} Since Stoffer failed to object to the trial court’s competency\ndetermination or the introduction of the children’s testimony at trial, this court reviews\nthis issue only for plain error.

This is because the court has the\nopportunity to observe the child’s appearance, manner of responding to questions,\ndemeanor, and any indicia of ability to relate facts accurately and truthfully.

As for B.P., he\nindicated that he knew that telling the truth was a rule of court. (Tr. 10.)           He\nunderstood that breaking a rule had consequences. (Tr. 10.) For example, he stated\nthat if he broke a rule at home he would be spanked. (Tr. 10.) He also demonstrated\nthat he understood what telling the truth meant. (Tr. 12.) Although he was unsure of\nwhat holiday was the next day (Thanksgiving), he knew that saying the female court\nreporter was a boy was not the truth. (Tr. 11-12.) He was able to tell the court that\nhis favorite television program was Sponge Bob and that saying Sponge Bob (who is\na boy) was a girl was not the truth. (Tr. 12.) He knew that he lived in Leetonia and\nthat he lived with “Grandma.” (Tr. 13.) He knew his sister’s name and her age. (Tr.\n14.)   Although he could not relate his exact birthdate, he was able to recall his\nfavorite present that he got for his birthday the previous year. (Tr. 14.)

B.P.’s answers established that\nhe could not only accurately receive and recollect impressions of fact, but that he\ncould also relate those impressions truthfully.\n       {¶42} As for A.P., she also stated that she understood the need to tell the\ntruth in court. (Tr. 23.) As with B.P., she related that the consequences of not telling\nthe truth at home resulted in being spanked. (Tr. 23.)               She stated that she\nunderstood that the judge could put her in jail for not telling the truth in court. (Tr. 24.)\nShe understood that saying she was a boy or that the male assistant prosecutor was\na girl were examples of not being truthful. (Tr. 23.) She was able to relate what grade\nshe was in and the name of her teacher. (Tr. 24.) Like B.P., she was able to recall\nher favorite presents from last Christmas and her last birthday. (Tr. 26-27.) A.P.’s\nanswers reflected that she too could accurately receive and recollect impressions of\nfact, and relate those impressions truthfully.\n       {¶43} Accordingly, Stoffer’s second assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶44} Stoffer’s third assignment of error states:\n       {¶45} “THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO SEVER THE FIVE (5)\nCOUNTS OF THE SUPERCEDING [sic] INDICTMENT FOR PURPOSES OF\nTRIAL.”\n       {¶46} Stoffer argues that the trial court abused its discretion in joining the\ncounts for trial, contending that the factual situation of each crime was identical and\nnot easily capable of segregation. Stoffer also notes that the crimes involved the\nsame victim, factual situations, and witnesses. Stoffer argues that prejudice in joining\nthe counts was demonstrated by the assistant prosecutor suggesting to the jury in his\nopening statement that they should believe the two counts of gross sexual imposition\nbecause of the three pictures which gave rise to the three counts of illegal use of a\nminor in nudity-oriented material or performance.\n\f                                                                                    - 13 -\n\n\n        {¶47} In response, the state argues that Stoffer waived this alleged error\nbecause he did not request severance below in the trial court.\n        {¶48} Stoffer failed to move for separate trials after the grand jury issued the\nsuperseding indictment. As mentioned before, an appellant’s failure to raise an error\nin the trial court constitutes a waiver of that issue on appeal unless it rises to the level\nof plain error. State v.

The offenses charged were gross sexual imposition\nand illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance. Thus, it was\nproper to join all of the offenses in one indictment.\n        {¶52} Crim.R. 14 provides that if it appears that a defendant is prejudiced by a\njoinder of offenses in an indictment for trial, the court shall order an election or\nseparate trial of counts or provide such other relief as justice requires.\n        {¶53} If a defendant claims the court erred in refusing to allow separate trials\nof multiple charges, he has the burden of affirmatively showing that his rights were\nprejudiced.

The\nthree photographs were each taken within seconds of each other as evidenced by\nthe time stamp on each photograph.         A.P. testified that Stoffer had touched her\nbreasts and vagina, and that he had also taken pictures of those areas. Under these\ncircumstances, the trial court did not err in joining the five counts for trial. Nor is it\napparent that the outcome of the trial would clearly have been otherwise.\n       {¶55} Accordingly, Stoffer’s third assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶56} Stoffer’s fourth assignment of error states:\n       {¶57} “THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT ADMITTED INADMISSIBLE\nHEARSAY TESTIMONY OF DR. MCPHERSON.”\n       {¶58} Dr. Paul McPherson evaluated A.P. at the Tri-County Advocacy Center.\nAfter Dr. McPherson conducted a physical examination of A.P., Diane Russo, a\nsocial worker, interviewed A.P. in another room. Although not in the room where A.P.\nwas interviewed, Dr. McPherson watched the interview live via closed circuit\ntelevision. At trial, the court permitted Dr. McPherson, over objection, to testify about\nwhat A.P. told Russo. Dr. McPherson testified that A.P. told Russo that Stoffer had\nkissed her breasts, touched her private area which resulted in pain when she\nurinated, and that he went up and down while lying on top of her.\n       {¶59} Stoffer argues the Dr. McPherson’s testimony constituted hearsay and\nthat the trial court erred in allowing its admission. Stoffer contends that the only\npossible hearsay exception would be Evid.R. 803(4), concerning statements for\npurposes of medical diagnosis or treatment.         However, Stoffer argues that the\nexception does not apply here because Dr. McPherson was not in the room,\nremoving the guarantee of trustworthiness upon which the exception is based.\n       {¶60} In response, the state argues that the statements made by A.P. and\ntestified to by Dr. McPherson were made for purposes of medical treatment and,\ntherefore, fall within the hearsay exception set forth in Evid.R. 803(4).\n\f                                                                              - 15 -\n\n\n       {¶61} Evid.R. 803 provides certain exceptions to the hearsay rule. Evid.R.\n803(4) provides:\n       {¶62} “The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the\ndeclarant is available as a witness:\n       {¶63} “* * *\n       {¶64} “(4) Statements for Purposes of Medical Diagnosis or Treatment.\nStatements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing\nmedical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or\ngeneral character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably\npertinent to diagnosis or treatment.”\n       {¶65} When a child sex abuse victim is taken to an advocacy center, it is not\nuncommon for the child to be subject to a physical exam by a doctor separate from\nan interview conducted by a social worker. Nor is it uncommon for a doctor or others\nto view the interview via closed circuit television and then testify about what they\nheard during the interview at trial. Despite the contents of the interview constituting\nhearsay, the testimony is admissible under the hearsay exception set forth in Evid.R.\n803(4) as long as the interview was conducted for the purpose of medical diagnosis\nor treatment.

During that interview I actually observe that in real time in\na different room, but via closed circuit television.\n       {¶79} “Q.     And do you use all of that information then to properly examine\nand diagnose the patient?\n       {¶80} “A.     Yes. Obtaining a history from the child is critical so we know\nwhat kind of exam we need to do, so, we know what kind of labs or test studies that\nwe need to do, as well.

She testified that in January 2008 A.P.’s brother B.P. had reported\nthat another student touched A.P. in gym class. Kemats interviewed A.P. about the\nincident and confirmed B.P.’s report. The police were summoned and Kemats later\nlearned from the principal that the five-year-old offender admitted to the incident and\nwas removed from the school.\n         {¶86}   Because the incident was of the same nature and occurred around\nthe same time as the crimes charged in the superseding indictment, Stoffer argued\nthat the jury should know about it. The trial court determined that since the incident\nactually did occur, it fell within the rape shield statute and could not go before the\njury.\n         {¶87}   Ohio’s rape shield provision provides:\n         {¶88}   “Evidence of specific instances of the victim’s sexual activity, opinion\nevidence of the victim’s sexual activity, and reputation evidence of the victim’s sexual\nactivity shall not be admitted under this section unless it involves evidence of the\norigin of semen, pregnancy, or disease, or the victim’s past sexual activity with the\noffender, and only to the extent that the court finds that the evidence is material to a\n\f                                                                             - 18 -\n\n\nfact at issue in the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature does not\noutweigh its probative value.” R.C. 2907.05(E).\n       {¶89}   It is a well recognized constitutional principle that “(t)he rights to\nconfront and cross-examine witnesses and to call witnesses in one’s own behalf have\nlong been recognized as essential to due process.” Chambers v.

Stoffer relies on In re Michael (1997),\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3721525\"><a href=\"/opinion/3970579/in-re-michael/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3721525\"><a href=\"/opinion/3970579/in-re-michael/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, in support. In Michael, a juvenile defendant\nwas adjudicated delinquent by reason of rape, attempted rape, and gross sexual\nimposition of an eight-year-old foster child who had been placed in his home and with\nwhom he shared a bedroom. At trial, a clinical psychologist who evaluated the victim\ntestified that there were three criteria he used to determine if a child had been\nsexually abused, one of which was the degree to which the child is conversant in\nsexual matters compared to “ordinary” children. Michael wanted to present evidence\nthat the victim had been sexually abused prior to being placed in his home and that\nanother person had been convicted of sexually abusing the victim in the identical\n\f                                                                                 - 19 -\n\n\nmanner in which he had been accused of sexually abusing the victim. On appeal,\nMichael argued that the trial court erred in applying the rape shield law to exclude\nthat evidence because it prevented him from showing an alternative source of the\nvictim’s knowledge of sexual conduct or activity.\n       {¶93}    In a matter of first impression for the Second District Court of Appeals,\nthe court observed that the average fact-finder would consider an eight-year-old to be\na “sexual innocent” and would be more likely to believe the sexual experience they\ndescribed in connection with the crime being prosecuted because they otherwise\ncould have not described it. The court found that because an expert (i.e., the clinical\npsychologist) had testified that the victim’s advanced knowledge of sexuality was an\nindicator of sexual abuse, it was probative for the jury to know that the victim had\npreviously been victimized in a similar manner by another because the victim was of\nsuch a young age that their knowledge of sexuality was inappropriate.\nConsequently, the court held that the exclusion of all evidence of a victim’s prior\nsexual abuse under those circumstances infringed on the defendant’s constitutional\nright to present a necessary and critical element of his defense and was\nunreasonable and constituted an abuse of discretion.            However, because the\ndefendant’s trial counsel was able to elicit testimony about the victim’s prior sexual\nabuse from cross-examination of the clinical psychologist and a children services\ncaseworker, the court effectively deemed it harmless error and affirmed the\nadjudication.\n       {¶94}    We disagree with Michael to the extent that it stands for the\nproposition that the rape shield law has any application to prior sexual abuse suffered\nby a child victim. In construing the rape shield statute, “our paramount concern is the\nlegislative intent” in enacting it. State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n2004-Ohio-4960, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1107</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶21.

The statute’s reference to “specific\ninstances of the victim’s sexual activity” connotes volitional activity by the victim with\nanother and not involuntary activity such as that which would stem from being\nsubjected to sexual abuse.\n       {¶95}     This interpretation of Ohio’s rape shield statute is supported by the\nGeneral Assembly’s use of the “victim’s sexual activity” throughout that provision.\nThe statute specifically prohibits opinion and reputation evidence of the victim’s\nsexual activity. Opinion and reputation evidence are methods of proving character.\nEvid.R. 405. Character is generally thought to include qualities, like honesty and\nintegrity,3 over which that person has control.               Therefore, when the General\nAssembly sought to protect a victim from opinion and reputation evidence, it was\ncontemplating evidence of a victim’s sexual history over which they had control.\n       {¶96}     The state interests identified by the Ohio Supreme Court in Gardner,\nsupra, which are advanced by the rape shield law also support this understanding of\nthe “victim’s sexual activity.” It is hoped that guarding the victim’s sexual privacy and\nprotecting them from undue harassment encourages the reporting of rape, thus\naiding crime prevention. Interpreting the rape shield statute to exclude evidence of\npast sexual abuse does not further these state interests. While sexual abuse victims\nmay very understandably be reluctant to disclose past instances of sexual abuse,\nthat discomfort is different from the undue harassment that rape shield statutes were\nenacted to protect against – undue harassment that may be caused by the revelation\nof one’s own history of questionable voluntary or consensual sexual activity.\n       {¶97}     The rape shield law also was intended to prevent a defendant from\nexploiting a victim’s sexual history to imply consent in the defendant’s case. State v.\nRay (June 11, 1992), 10th Dist. No. 91AP-1290.

See R.C. 2907.05(D).\n       {¶98}    Based on the foregoing, we construe that the legislative intent of\nOhio’s rape shield law was to address only past consensual sexual activity of the\nvictim and not prior sexual abuse suffered by the victim. Therefore, the rape shield\nstatute has no application in this case and the trial court erred in applying it.\n       {¶99}    The question then becomes whether the exclusion of evidence of\nA.P.’s prior sexual abuse unconstitutionally infringed on Stoffer’s ability to present a\ndefense. The right of a criminal defendant to confront and cross-examine a witness\non relevant matters is secured in the Sixth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution. Delaware v.

Id.\n       {¶100} “Relevant evidence” is any evidence that tends to make the existence\nof any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less\nprobable than it would be without the evidence. Evid.R. 401. Generally, all relevant\nevidence is admissible. Evid.R. 402.         Relevant evidence may be inadmissible,\nhowever, if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\nprejudice. Evid.R. 403.\n       {¶101} In this case, evidence of the prior sexual abuse was not relevant. In\nhis opening statement, the prosecutor never suggested that A.P.’s age-inappropriate\nsexual knowledge was proof that that A.P. was telling the truth.              Rather, the\nprosecution relied on the photographs recovered from Stoffer’s digital camera\ndepicting A.P. in various stages of nudity in Stoffer’s bedroom to bolster A.P.’s\n\f                                                                             - 22 -\n\n\ncredibility.

The history that we relied upon, apart from her past\nmedical history, was an interview of the child.\n       {¶104} “And when we interview children we do a couple of things; first of all\nwe want to make sure the child was developmentally appropriate, or that they\nunderstand their colors, they understand body parts, that they understand what\ninside and outside means. So we-- we make sure that the child is developmentally\nappropriate for her age. And [A.P.] was developmentally appropriate for her age.\n       {¶105} “Q. What’s the next step?\n       {¶106} “A.

Unlike in\nMichael, here there was independent, physical evidence indicating that inappropriate\ncontact had occurred between A.P. and Stoffer. There was evidence presented that\nthree photographs were retrieved from Stoffer’s digital camera showing A.P. in\nvarious stages of nudity.\n       {¶122} Accordingly, Stoffer’s fifth assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶123} Stoffer’s sixth assignment of error states:\n\f                                                                                   - 24 -\n\n\n       {¶124} “THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN PERMITTING WITNESS GIBBS\nAND WITNESS DR. MCPHERSON TO TESTIFY AS EXPERTS.”\n       {¶125} Stoffer argues that despite not being qualified as an expert and the\nabsence of any finding that Dr. McPherson or JoAnn Gibbs was an expert, they\nnonetheless proceeded to state their opinion as such. Concerning Dr. McPherson,\nStoffer cites two examples of his testimony in support. First, Dr. McPherson testified\nthat it was his expert opinion that a seven year old would not know the details of the\nsexual contact that was alleged to have occurred unless she had experienced it. (Tr.\n250.) Second, Dr. McPherson opined that this was a case of sexual abuse within a\nreasonable degree of medical certainty. (Tr. 253.) Concerning JoAnn Gibbs, Stoffer\nrefers to her testimony about the retrieval and authentication of the pictures retrieved\nfrom his digital camera.\n       {¶126} In response, the state points out that Stoffer did not object to any of\nthe expert testimony and that their testimony nonetheless comported with Evid.R.\n702, the rule of evidence which governs expert testimony.          Because of Stoffer’s\nfailure to object to the testimony, the state contends that this assignment of error\nshould be reviewed only for plain error and that if there was any error it did not rise to\nthat level.\n       {¶127} Whether a witness is qualified to testify as an expert is a matter within\nthe trial court’s discretion. State v. Awkal (1996), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 331. Therefore,\nwe will review a trial court’s decision to qualify a witness as an expert for abuse of\ndiscretion.\n       {¶128} Evid.R. 702 provides the qualifications a person must meet in order to\nbe qualified as an expert:\n       {¶129} “A witness may testify as an expert if all of the following apply:\n       {¶130} “(A) The witness’ testimony either relates to matters beyond the\nknowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception\ncommon among lay persons;\n\f                                                                                - 25 -\n\n\n         {¶131} “(B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge,\nskill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony;\n         {¶132} “(C) The witness’ testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical,\nor other specialized information. To the extent that the testimony reports the result of\na procedure, test, or experiment, the testimony is reliable only if all of the following\napply:\n         {¶133} “(1) The theory upon which the procedure, test, or experiment is\nbased is objectively verifiable or is validly derived from widely accepted knowledge,\nfacts, or principles;\n         {¶134} “(2) The design of the procedure, test, or experiment reliably\nimplements the theory;\n         {¶135} “(3) The particular procedure, test, or experiment was conducted in a\nway that will yield an accurate result.”\n         {¶136} Despite the trial court’s failure to make a specific finding that Dr.\nMcPherson was qualified to testify as an expert, he was nonetheless so qualified. He\ngraduated from medical school and trained in general pediatrics. (Tr. 244.)           He\ntrained an additional two years in specifically diagnosing and treating children who\nhave been abused. Id. By the time of trial, he had evaluated approximately fourteen-\nhundred children who were suspected of being abused. Id.\n         {¶137} Likewise, JoAnn Gibbs was qualified to testify as an expert.        She\ntestified that she was a certified forensic computer examiner by the International\nAssociation of Computer Investigative Specialists. (Tr. 270). She is also a certified\nelectronics evidence collection specialist, holding a Microsoft Certified Professional\nCertification. Id. She also testified that she had been through numerous schools\npertaining to the various software that they utilize at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal\nIdentification and Investigation. Id.\n         {¶138} Based on the testimony presented by Dr. McPherson and JoAnn\nGibbs concerning their professional qualifications, it cannot be said that any error in\n\f                                                                                  - 26 -\n\n\nthe trial court’s failure to make a specific finding that they were qualified to testify as\nexperts rose to the level of plain error.\n       {¶139} Accordingly, Stoffer’s sixth assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶140} Stoffer’s seventh assignment of error states:\n       {¶141} “THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING INTO EVIDENCE\nSTATE EXHIBITS 1 THROUGH 7 AS NO PROPER FOUNDATION WAS LAID NOR\nWAS EXPERT TESTIMONY APPROPRIATE.”\n       {¶142} Under this assignment of error, Stoffer reasserts his argument that he\nmade under the previous assignment of error that JoAnn Gibbs was not found to be\nan expert and, therefore, should not have been able to offer her expert opinion\nregarding the retrieval of the pictures from Stoffer’s digital camera.        Stoffer also\nargues that the state failed to lay a proper foundation for admission as evidence. In\nparticular, Stoffer takes issue with Gibbs subjecting the camera to analysis by “a\nmemory stick reader” and that she used “specialized forensic software.” (Brief of\nDefendant-Appellant, p. 25; Tr. 272, 274.) He also takes issue with Gibbs’s inability\nto verify the dates the photos were taken. (Tr. 281-282.)\n       {¶143} The admission of photographs into evidence at trial is a decision left\nto the sound discretion of the trial judge. State v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2002-\nOhio-6659, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">780</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶33.             Evid.R. 901 sets forth the requirements for\nauthenticating evidence, including photographic evidence: “The requirement of\nauthentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by\nevidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its\nproponent claims.” Pursuant to Evid.R. 901(B)(9), “[e]vidence describing a process\nor system used to produce a result and showing that the process or system produces\nan accurate result” is one example of authentication conforming to the rule’s\nrequirements.\n       {¶144} In this case, JoAnn Gibbs testified concerning the authentication of\nphotographs. Gibbs explained how she removed the memory stick from Stoffer’s\ndigital camera and inserted it into a memory stick reader. (Tr. 272.)           She then\n\f                                                                               - 27 -\n\n\nattached the memory stick reader to a write blocker device. (Tr. 272.) The write\nblocker device physically barricades the memory stick from the computer in such a\nway that the computer analyzing the memory stick cannot alter it in any way. (Tr.\n273.) Using her computer and specialized software, she then proceeded to take a\nforensic image of the memory stick. (Tr. 273.) The forensic image is a bit for bit copy\nof every sector on the memory stick. (Tr. 273.) Again with specialized software,\nGibbs was able to view everything on the memory stick, including deleted\nphotographic images. (Tr. 274.) It was from those images that Gibbs located the\nphotographs that formed the basis of the three counts of illegal use of a minor in\nnudity-oriented material or performance. (Tr. 275.) As for the date the photographs\nwere taken, Gibbs explained that the date information contained with the digital\nimage file was the date that was on the camera at the time the picture was taken. (Tr.\n277.)\n        {¶145} There is no dispute that the digital camera seized from Stoffer’s\nstorage unit was in fact his. As the above testimony illustrates, the state adduced\nsufficient testimony from Gibbs to authenticate or identify the images comprising\nExhibits 1 through 7 as duplicates of the images appearing on Stoffer’s digital\ncamera. In sum, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\nphotographs as evidence.\n        {¶146} Accordingly, Stoffer’s seventh assignment of error is without merit.\n        {¶147} Stoffer’s eighth and ninth assignments of error state, respectively:\n        {¶148} “THE       TRIAL     COURT        ERRED       WHEN       IT     DENIED\nDEFENDANT/APPELLANT’S CRIMINAL RULE 29 MOTION FOR JUDGMENT OF\nACQUITTAL; ALTERNATIVELY, THE DEFENDANT/APPELLANT’S CONVICTION\nIS BASED UPON INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND THEREFORE MUST BE\nREVERSED.”\n        {¶149} “THE DEFENDANT/APPELLANT’S CONVICTION IS AGAINST THE\nMANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.”\n\f                                                                                - 28 -\n\n\n       {¶150} Though sufficiency and manifest weight involve two different\nstandards of review, they will be discussed together for the sake of clarity and judicial\neconomy and because both call for a review of the evidence, and because Stoffer\nadvances the same arguments in support of each.\n       {¶151} Stoffer argues the conviction was based upon insufficient evidence\nand was against the manifest weight of the evidence because the evidence he\nheretofore argued was improperly admitted into evidence. He argues: (1) the digital\ncamera was illegally seized; (2) the children were not competent to testify; (3) the\nexperts were not properly qualified to testify; (4) impermissible hearsay was admitted;\n(5) the photographs were not properly authenticated; and (6) the court erroneously\nprohibited testimony concerning an alternative explanation for A.P.’s sexual\nknowledge.\n       {¶152} Sufficiency of the evidence is the legal standard applied to determine\nwhether the case may go to the jury or whether the evidence is legally sufficient as a\nmatter of law to support the jury verdict. State v.

A.P. testified that Stoffer had used his\nhands to touch her “boobies” and her “wrong place.” This court has previously found\nsimilar testimony sufficient. See State v. Rhodes, 7th Dist. No. 99 BA 62, 2002-Ohio-\n1572 (where victim testified that the defendant testified that he put “his finger in her\nprivate.”)\n       {¶161} Stoffer’s conviction on the two counts of gross sexual imposition is\nalso supported by the weight of the evidence. In addition to A.P.’s own testimony, Dr.\nMcPherson testified to the statements A.P. made at the Tri-County Advocacy Center\nabout Stoffer touching her breasts and pubic regions. Additionally, Dr. McPherson\ntestified that, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, A.P. had been sexually\nabused. (Tr. 253.)\n       {¶162} Turning to the three counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented\nmaterial or performance, Stoffer was convicted of three counts of illegal use of a\nminor in nudity-oriented material or performance, in violation of R.C. 2907.323(A)(1),\nwhich provides:\n       {¶163} “(A) No person shall do any of the following:\n       {¶164} “(1) Photograph any minor who is not the person’s child or ward in a\nstate of nudity, or create, direct, produce, or transfer any material or performance that\nshows the minor in a state of nudity * * * [.]”\n       {¶165} A rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat Stoffer took the three nude pictures of A.P. found on his digital camera. A.P.\ntestified that Stoffer took a picture of her “boobies” and her “wrong place.” (Tr. 38.).\n\f                                                                               - 31 -\n\n\nTherefore, there was sufficient evidence to support Stoffer’s conviction on those\ncounts.\n       {¶166} Further the weight of the evidence supports Stoffer’s conviction on\nthose three counts. Dan Valentine testified about retrieving the digital camera from\nStoffer’s storage unit to which Stoffer voluntarily directed him. (Tr. 232-233.) Joann\nGibb testified about retrieving the images from Stoffer’s camera. In addition, Dr.\nMcPherson corroborated A.P.’s recounting of Stoffer taking the pictures of her in\nvarious stages of nudity. (Tr. 250.)\n       {¶167} Accordingly, Stoffer’s eighth and ninth assignments of error are\nwithout merit.\n       {¶168} Stoffer’s tenth assignment of error states:\n       {¶169} “THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO MERGE THE\nOFFENSES IN THE SUPERCEDING INDICTMENT FOR PURPOSES OF\nSENTENCING.”\n       {¶170} Stoffer argues that the two counts of gross sexual imposition were not\nallied offenses of similar import. He contends that there was no evidence presented\nto establish that the counts were committed at separate times or with separate\nanimus. Therefore, he concludes, the trial court’s sentence of five years in prison on\neach count to be served consecutively was contrary to law. Stoffer also contends\nthat three counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material were allied\noffenses of similar import. But since the trial court ordered concurrent sentences on\nthose convictions, Stoffer concedes that the sentences were permissible.\n       {¶171} In response, the state argues that the testimony of the victim\nestablished that there were at least two separate incidents which gave rise to the two\ncounts of gross sexual imposition.\n       {¶172} Stoffer failed to raise the issue of merger at sentencing and, therefore,\nwaived all but plain error. “Because an error related to merger affects a defendant’s\nright to protection from double jeopardy, and because an erroneous failure to merge\nconvictions inevitably causes a different outcome in a defendant's trial, the failure to\n\f                                                                                   - 32 -\n\n\nmerge convictions on allied offenses of similar import will almost always result in\nplain error.” State v. Haslam, 7th Dist. No. 08-MO-3, 2009-Ohio1663, at ¶ 62. Thus,\nif the court here failed to properly merge Stoffer’s convictions, the result is plain error.\n       {¶173} R.C. 2941.25 addresses the issue of merger and provides:\n       {¶174} “(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to\nconstitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information\nmay contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only\none.\n       {¶175} “(B) Where the defendant’s conduct constitutes two or more offenses\nof dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same\nor similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the\nindictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant\nmay be convicted of all of them.”\n       {¶176} Recently, in State v.

Thus, the court need not\nperform any hypothetical or abstract comparison of the offenses at issue in order to\nconclude that the offenses are subject to merger.\n       {¶178} “In determining whether offenses are allied offenses of similar import\nunder R.C. 2941.25(A), the question is whether it is possible to commit one offense\nand commit the other with the same conduct, not whether it is possible to commit one\nwithout committing the other.

Id.\nat ¶47-41.\n       {¶182} Applying Johnson to this case, we address the first question –\nwhether it is possible to commit one offense and commit the other with the same\nconduct. Here, Stoffer’s two convictions for gross sexual imposition were both for\nviolations of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) and, therefore, contain identical elements. Thus, it is\npossible to commit one offense and commit the other with the same conduct. So, the\nanswer to the first question is yes.\n       {¶183} The second question is whether the offenses were committed by the\nsame conduct, i.e., a single act, committed with a single state of mind. Here, the\nrecord reveals two distinct acts of sexual misconduct defined by R.C. 2907.01(B):\ntouching the victim’s breasts and touching her pubic region. So, the answer to the\nsecond question is no.      Therefore, each offense charged constitutes a separate\noffense of gross sexual imposition, and the crimes do not constitute allied offenses of\nsimilar import which must be merged for conviction.\n       {¶184} Other districts are in accord.

Moralevitz (1980), 70 Ohio\nApp.2d 20, 24 O.O.3d 16, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3727617\"><a href=\"/opinion/3976102/state-v-moralevitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1280</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> the defendant was charged with three\ncounts of gross sexual imposition: placing his finger between the victim’s legs, putting\nhis hand upon the victim’s chest, and putting his tongue between the victim’s legs.\nThe Eighth District concluded that the acts occurred consecutively, determining that\nthey were not allied offenses, “just as the commission of anal rape after vaginal rape\nconstituted the commission of separate offenses in State v.

The\nfirst question is whether it is possible to commit one offense and commit the other\nwith the same conduct. Here, Stoffer’s three convictions of illegal use of a minor in\nnudity-oriented material or performance were all for violations of R.C. 2907.323(A)(1)\nand, therefore, contain identical elements. Thus, it is possible to commit one offense\nand commit the other with the same conduct. So, the answer to the first question is\nyes.\n       {¶186} The second question is whether the offenses were committed by the\nsame conduct, i.e., a single act, committed with a single state of mind. Here, the\nrecord reveals three distinct acts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material\nor performance. Three separate pictures showing A.P. in various stages of nudity\nwere retrieved from Stoffer’s digital camera. While they may have been taken within\nseconds of each other, all three pictures were taken separately and at distinctly\ndifferent times.   So, the answer to the second question is no.        Therefore, each\noffense charged constitutes a separate offense of illegal use of a minor in nudity-\noriented material or performance, and the crimes do not constitute allied offenses of\nsimilar import which must be merged for conviction.\n       {¶187} Accordingly, Stoffer’s tenth assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶188} Stoffer’s eleventh assignment of error states:\n       {¶189} “THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IMPOSING CONSECUTIVE\nSENTENCES UPON DEFENDANT/APPELLANT.”\n\f                                                                               - 35 -\n\n\n      {¶190} Stoffer acknowledges the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision in State v.\nFoster, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2006-Ohio-856, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, removing the requirement\nof specific findings for imposition of consecutive sentences.        However, Stoffer\nmaintains that the underlying legislative policy remains intact. Stoffer argues that the\ntrial court’s reasons for imposing consecutive sentences should be clear from the\nrecord in order to allow for a meaningful appellate review.\n      {¶191} Regardless of the “policy” argument advanced by Stoffer, this court is\nleft only with what remains of Ohio’s felony sentencing law and is bound by the Ohio\nSupreme Court’s decisions in that regard.        Prior to the Ohio Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Foster, the trial court was required to make certain findings in order to\nsentence an offender to consecutive sentences. R.C. 2929.14(E).            However, in\nFoster, the Court found that provision unconstitutional because it statutorily required\n“judicial fact-finding before imposition of a sentence greater than the maximum term\nauthorized by a jury verdict or admission of the defendant.” Id. at paragraph one of\nthe syllabus. As a remedy, Foster severed the provision in its entirety from the\nstatute. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.     Now, a sentencing court has “full\ndiscretion” to sentence an offender within the statutory range and is no longer\nrequired to make findings or give its reasons for imposing non-minimum, maximum,\nor consecutive sentences.

A sentencing court\nneed only consider “R.C. 2929.11, which specifies the purposes of sentencing, and\nR.C. 2929.12, which provides guidance in considering factors relating to the\nseriousness of the offense and recidivism of the offender.” State v.

Mathis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2006-Ohio-855, ¶ 38.\nConsequently, the trial court was not required to engage in the proportionality\nanalysis espoused in R.C. 2929.14(E).\n       {¶198} Accordingly, Stoffer’s twelfth assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶199} Stoffer’s thirteenth assignment of error states:\n\f                                                                                - 37 -\n\n\n       {¶200} “DEFENDANT/APPELLANT’S SENTENCES ARE CONTRARY TO\nLAW AS THEY DO NOT SERVE THE OVERRIDING PURPOSES AND\nPRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING AS EXPRESSED IN ORC 2929.11.”\n       {¶201} Under this assignment of error, Stoffer argues that imposition of\nmaximum and consecutive sentences regarding the two counts of gross sexual\nimposition was not consistent with the purposes of felony sentencing set forth in R.C.\n2929.11(A) to adequately protect the public and punish the offender. He posits that\nthe trial court’s imposition of consecutive sentences was not commensurate with the\nseriousness of his conduct and that the sentences do not comply with purposes of\nfelony sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11(B). Again, he argues that the record is\nlacking for a meaningful appellate review.\n       {¶202} Appellate review of felony sentences is a very limited, two-fold\napproach, as outlined by the plurality opinion of the Ohio State Supreme Court in\nState v. Kalish, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2008-Ohio-4912, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at ¶26. The\nfirst step requires appellate courts to “examine the sentencing court’s compliance\nwith all applicable rules and statutes in imposing the sentence to determine whether\nthe sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law.” Id. (O’Connor, J., plurality\nopinion). In examining “all applicable rules and statutes,” the sentencing court must\nconsider R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12. Id. at ¶13-14 (O’Connor, J., plurality\nopinion).    If the sentence is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law, the\nsentencing court’s exercise of discretion “in selecting a sentence within the\npermissible statutory range is subject to review for any abuse of discretion.” Id. at ¶17\n(O’Connor, J., plurality opinion). Thus, an abuse of discretion is used to determine\nwhether the sentence satisfies R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12. Id. at ¶17 (O’Connor,\nJ., plurality opinion).\n       {¶203} A sentencing court must consider the principles and purposes of\nsentencing in R.C. 2929.11 and the seriousness and recidivism factors in R.C.\n2929.12. State v. Mathis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2006-Ohio-855, ¶38. The trial court in\nthis case did not discuss the statutory principles and factors either at the sentencing\n\f                                                                                - 38 -\n\n\nhearing or in the sentencing entry. However, the sentencing court need not make\nfindings regarding these statutes. This court has held that a silent record raises the\nrebuttable presumption that the sentencing court considered the statutory sentencing\ncriteria. State v. James, 7th Dist. No.07CO47, 2009-Ohio-4392, ¶50, citing State v.\nAdams (1988), 37 Ohio St .3d 295 and applying footnote from Kalish, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">23</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2008-Ohio-4912, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Only if the record affirmatively shows that the\ntrial court failed to consider the principles and purposes of sentencing will a sentence\nbe reversed on this basis, unless the sentence is strikingly inconsistent with relevant\nconsiderations. Id.\n       {¶204} The record does not affirmatively show that the court refused to\nconsider the proper principles and factors. Nor is the sentence strikingly inconsistent\nwith the pertinent considerations. In sum, Stoffer’s sentence fell within the statutory\nrange and was not clearly and convincingly contrary to law. Nor did the trial court’s\napplication of R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12 to Stoffer’s sentence constitute an\nabuse of discretion.\n       {¶205} Accordingly, Stoffer’s thirteenth assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶206} Stoffer’s fourteenth assignment of error states:\n       {¶207} “THE      TRIAL     COURT’S       IMPOSITION       OF     CONSECUTIVE\nSENTENCES IN THE PRESENT CASE IS CONTRARY TO LAW AND/OR\nVIOLATES THE MANDATES OF ORC 2929.13(A).”\n       {¶208} Stoffer argues that the trial court made no finding that the imposition\nof consecutive sentences would not impose an unnecessary burden on state or local\ngovernment resources, citing R.C. 2929.13(A). Without further explanation, Stoffer\nargues that it is “clear” in this case that the sentences imposed did “in fact” impose an\nunnecessary burden on state and local government resources.\n       {¶209} R.C. 2929.13(A) provides that a felony “sentence shall not impose an\nunnecessary burden on state or local government resources.”\n       {¶210} “Just what constitutes a ‘burden’ on state resources is undefined by\nthe statute, but the plain language suggests that the costs, both economic and\n\f                                                                                - 39 -\n\n\nsocietal, should not outweigh the benefit that the people of the state derive from an\noffender’s incarceration. Some have argued that in cases where the multiple life tails\nmight be involved, incarceration of aged offenders who require the kind of nursing\ncare needed by elderly people might place a burden on the state’s resources. Of\ncourse this is true, but it is only one type of cost associated with incarceration. The\ncourt must also consider the benefit to society in assuring that an offender will not be\nfree to reoffend. Many people sleep better at night knowing that certain offenders are\nincarcerated. They would no doubt consider a lengthy incarceration worth the cost of\nhousing those offenders.” State v. Vlahopoulos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3743019\"><a href=\"/opinion/3990135/state-v-vlahopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2003-Ohio-\n5070, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3743019\"><a href=\"/opinion/3990135/state-v-vlahopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at ¶5.\n       {¶211} As mentioned, Stoffer has provided no explanation or evidence that\nthe sentence the trial court imposed would create an unnecessary burden on state or\nlocal government resources. Given the nature of the crimes perpetrated by Stoffer\nagainst his child-victim, it cannot be said that the public, and primarily its safety,\nwould not benefit from having Stoffer incarcerated for fifteen years.\n       {¶212} Accordingly, Stoffer’s fourteenth assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶213} Stoffer’s fifteenth assignment of error states:\n       {¶214} “DEFENDANT/APPELLANT WAS DENIED A FAIR TRIAL DUE TO\nTHE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ERRORS AS SET FORTH HEREIN.”\n       {¶215} Stoffer argues that due to the cumulative effect of the errors he\nalleged occurred in this case, he was denied a fair trial and substantive due process.\nHe requests dismissal of all the charges against him and discharge from prison or, at\nthe very least, a new trial.\n       {¶216} “The cumulative error doctrine refers to a situation in which the\nexistence of multiple errors, which may not individually require reversal, may violate a\ndefendant’s right to a fair trial. To affirm a conviction in spite of multiple errors, we\nmust determine that the cumulative effect of the errors is harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt. The errors may be considered harmless if there is overwhelming\nevidence of guilt, if Appellant’s substantial rights were not affected, or if there are\n\f                                                                               - 40 -\n\n\nother indicia that the errors did not contribute to the conviction.” (Internal citations\nomitted.) State v. Anderson, 7th Dist. No. 03-MA-252, 2006-Ohio-4618, at ¶80.\n      {¶217} As discussed above, the errors Stoffer alleges do not have merit,\nharmless or otherwise. Thus, no cumulative error exists.\n      {¶218} Accordingly, Stoffer’s fifteenth assignment of error is without merit.\n      {¶219} The judgment of the trial court is hereby affirmed.\n\nVukovich, J., concurs.\n\nDeGenaro, J., concurs.\n\f</pre>",
