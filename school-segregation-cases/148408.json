WIENER and ROBERT M. PARKER, Circuit Judges, joined by\nCAROLYN DINEEN KING, PATRICK E. HIGGINBOTHAM, W. EUGENE DAVIS and\nJAMES L. DENNIS, Circuit Judges, dissenting from the Court’s denial\nof the Petition for Rehearing En Banc:\n     The panel opinion for this case marks the first time in the\nhistory of American jurisprudence that an appellate court has\nreversed a trial judge’s discretionary refusal to recuse himself ——\nand has ordered the judge recused —— based solely on the fact that\nmany years earlier, while he was a practicing attorney, he had been\nlinked (erroneously at that) with one view of a legal issue that\nwas then pending in state court and only recently resurfaced in a\ncase pending before him in federal court.2                 The Petition for\nRehearing En Banc challenges the panel’s holding that a federal\ndistrict judge (“the Judge”) abused his discretion by refusing to\nrecuse himself pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 455(a), simply because he\nhad been mistakenly identified, years before he became a judge, as\nhaving an “association with the legal position” now being espoused\nby one of the parties in a case pending before him.\n     The    Petition   for   Panel   Rehearing    challenged       the   panel’s\nholding    that   under   those   circumstances      the   Judge   abused   his\ndiscretion by not recusing himself pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 455(a).\nWe respectfully but vigorously dissent from the refusal of a\nmajority of the active judges of this court to rehear this matter\nen banc.    We would have granted rehearing en banc, not merely\nbecause    we   view   the   panel   opinion3   as   wrongly   decided,      but\n\n\n     2\n         Republic of Panama I, 217 F.3d at 347.\n     3\n      The panel opinion in this matter, Republic of Panama v.\nAmerican Tobacco Co., Inc., 250 F.3d 315 (5th Cir. 2001)(“Republic\nof Panama II”), followed, as it had to, the earlier panel decision\nin a companion case, Republic of Panama v. American Tobacco Co.,\n\n                                      3\n\fprimarily because the nature of the error committed in pronouncing\nthat result dangerously erodes the discretion that Congress has\nassigned to federal judges in matters of recusal while opening a\nnew, broad avenue for litigants to avoid appearing before a judge\nthey perceive to be unfairly disinclined to favor their side of a\ncase.\n                   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n     In October 1998, the Republic of Panama filed suit alleging\nthat the defendant tobacco companies conspired to conceal the\naddictiveness and health risks of tobacco and seeking compensation\nfor health costs for diseases caused by smoking.        Republic of\nPanama I, 217 F.3d at 344.   The defendant tobacco companies removed\nthe case to federal court.      Id. at 345.   In 1999, the tobacco\ncompanies sought to recuse the Judge, who had been assigned to the\ncase.   Id.   The Judge exercised the discretion vested in him by\nstatute, explaining in detail why he was denying the motion to\nrecuse himself and remanding the action to state court.     Id.   On\nappeal, a panel of this court held that the Judge had abused his\ndiscretion, reversed his order denying recusal, vacated his order\nremanding the case to state court, and remanded the action to the\ndistrict court for reassignment to a different judge.   Republic of\nPanama II, 250 F.3d at 316.\n     The motion to recuse was based solely on the fact that the\nJudge had been listed —— erroneously —— as the president of a\n\n\n\nInc., 217 F.3d 343 (5th Cir. 2000)(“Republic of Panama I”). Both\nof these cases involve identical facts and decisions regarding the\nrecusal issue at both the trial and appellate level.             We\nacknowledge that the panel in Republic of Panama II was constrained\nby precedent and was not free to correct what we view as the error\nof Republic of Panama I.\n\n                                  4\n\fspecialized   bar   association    (the    Louisiana    Trial    Lawyer’s\nAssociation   (“LTLA”))   on   that    organization’s   motion    seeking\npermission to file an amicus curiae brief in similar state court\ntobacco litigation some nine years earlier.      The Judge’s name did\nnot appear on the amicus brief itself.\n     Almost a decade prior to his appointment to the federal trial\nbench, the Judge had served a one-year term as president of the\nLTLA, from approximately October 1989 - October 1990.            In April\n1991, some six months after his term as president had expired, LTLA\nfiled the subject motion seeking permission to file an amicus brief\nin the appeal of a tobacco products liability case in the Supreme\nCourt of Louisiana.    Despite his being president no longer, the\nJudge’s name was mistakenly listed as President of the LTLA on the\n“Motion for Leave to File Amicus Curiae Brief” which was filed\nsimultaneously with the filing of the association’s amicus brief.\nThe Judge signed neither the motion nor the brief, either as\ncounsel or as an officer of the putative amicus association.\nListed among the counsel on this motion, however, was Michael St.\nMartin, who is also counsel for the plaintiff in the present\naction.   The amicus brief itself was not signed by Mr. St. Martin\n(or by the Judge) but by another attorney; neither did the brief or\nthe motion list the Judge as counsel.\n     Although they were not identical to the allegations in the\npresent case, the LTLA’s 1991 amicus brief did contain allegations\nsimilar to those in the current litigation, including, inter alia,\nthat smoking is addictive and that it causes cancer, and that the\ndefendant tobacco companies knew or should have known about the\nhealth dangers of smoking.        The amicus brief argued that the\ntobacco companies should be held liable because they were negligent\nin producing their product.\n\n                                   5\n\f       In denying the tobacco defendants’ recusal motion in the\npresent case, the Judge specifically informed the parties that,\neven   though   his      name   had    been    listed      on   the   motion    seeking\npermission to file the amicus brief in state court years ago, it\nhad been placed on the motion by mistake; his term as president of\nLTLA had ended months before by the time the brief was filed.                         The\nJudge further informed the parties that he had nothing to do with\nthe research, writing, signing, or approval of the brief; and that\nneither as a practicing attorney nor in any other capacity had he\never participated in any tobacco litigation.                      And the Judge also\nexplained that the decision to file an amicus brief and the\ndetermination       of   the    contents      of   the   brief     were    exclusively\ngoverned by     the      LTLA   Amicus     Committee,       not    the    president    or\nexecutive committee of the association.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n       We review the denial of a motion to recuse for abuse of\ndiscretion.     Trevino v. Johnson, 168 F.3d 173, 178 (5th Cir. 1999).\nA judge should recuse himself “in any proceeding in which his\nimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.”                     28 U.S.C. § 455(a).\n“In order to determine whether a court’s impartiality is reasonably\nin question, the objective inquiry is whether a well-informed,\nthoughtful    and     objective       observer     would    question      the   court’s\nimpartiality.”       Trust Co. v. N.N.P., 104 F.3d 1478, 1491 (5th Cir.\n1997).   The purpose of § 455(a) is to avoid even an appearance of\npartiality.     United States v. Jordan, 49 F.3d 152, 155 (5th Cir.\n1995).\n       We are firmly convinced that no reasonable person, aware of\nall the facts, would question any judge’s impartiality based on\ncircumstances as attenuated as those presented by this case:                          (1)\n\n\n                                           6\n\fThe Judge’s name was listed, erroneously and without his knowledge,\non a motion to file an amicus curiae brief —— not even the brief\nitself; (2) the motion and brief were filed on behalf of an\nassociation of which the future judge was a past president; (3) the\nmotion was filed in a state court proceeding seven years before the\nJudge took the bench and eight years before the present lawsuit was\nfiled; (4) the motion related to a legal issue in which the Judge\nhad never been involved as a practicing attorney or otherwise; and\n(5) it was filed by lawyers for the association with whom the Judge\nhas never been a partner or an associate.\n      On appeal, the tobacco companies urged a panel of this court\nto   adopt   the   rule   that   any   judge    who    had   a   “pre-judicial\nassociation with the position” —— not with the parties, not with\nthe lawyers, but with a “position” —— can never fairly decide a\ncase that raises questions pertaining to that “position.”                     In\nbuying   into   that   proposition,    the     panel   clearly    called    into\nquestion the oath we take when we become federal judges.                   If we\nshould embark on such a perilous course, we will launch a cottage\nindustry in which investigators will comb the contents of speeches\nmade, articles written, and pleadings and briefs filed by a judge\nprior to his taking of that oath, looking for some trace of\nevidence suggesting that, prior to his judgeship, the judge held\nviews on legal questions that can be used to disqualify him from\nhearing cases that implicate such matters.              Nothing —— not the\nstatute, not our jurisprudence, not the public policy underlying\nthe concept of recusal —— supports the panel’s decision to require\nthe Judge’s recusal under such attenuated circumstances.\n      Republic of Panama I correctly notes that this record includes\nno evidence of actual bias on the part of the Judge.               Republic of\nPanama I, 217 F.3d at 347.       It nevertheless concludes that nothing\n\n                                       7\n\fmore than the mere listing of the Judge’s name on a motion to file\nan amicus brief that years earlier had asserted allegations against\ntobacco companies similar to those asserted by the plaintiffs in\nthis case, could lead a reasonable person to doubt the Judge’s\nimpartiality.      Id.\n      The panel’s analysis of Republic of Panama I relies on but a\nsingle case, Bradshaw v. McCotter, 785 F.2d 1327 (5th Cir. 1986).\nIn Bradshaw, a criminal defendant argued that a judge on the Texas\nCourt of Criminal Appeals should have been disqualified because at\nthe time of the defendant’s conviction the future Judge’s name was\nlisted on a brief as State Prosecuting Attorney in the defendant’s\nappeal. Id. at 1328.         The judge in Bradshaw explained that in fact\nhe had not participated in the prosecution of the case at all, and\nthat his name had appeared on the brief simply as a matter of\ncourtesy and protocol.           We held that whether the judge actually\nparticipated in the prosecution was immaterial because the listing\nof his name on the brief undermined the appearance of impartiality.\nId. at 1329.\n\n\n      Yet, when carefully read, the opinion in Bradshaw makes\npellucid    that    it    does   not   present      a    “somewhat     similar   fact\nsituation” to that in Republic of Panama I.                    Republic of Panama I,\n217 F.3d at 347.         The recusal ordered in Bradshaw was directed at\na judge who was not just correctly listed on the State’s brief as\nprosecuting attorney (albeit he did not personally participate in\nthe prosecution), but who was in fact scheduled to hear the appeal\nof   the   very    same   case   of    the   very       same    criminal   defendant.\nBradshaw does not deal with a mere amicus; it is not a civil case;\nit does not involve a union, trade association, or bar association;\n\n\n                                         8\n\fit correctly identified the judge as the prosecuting attorney; and\nit implicated a substantive pleading —— the appellate brief —— not,\nas here, a non-substantive, procedural motion.          Because Bradshaw\nneither presents nor answers the questions raised by the instant\ncase, it affords no support for the panel’s decision to require the\nJudge’s recusal under the present circumstances.\n\n\n     Although Bradshaw offers no map out of the present situation,\nwe are not here navigating uncharted waters.       In an earlier en banc\ndecision, this court held that a district judge who, before ever\nbecoming a judge, served as president of a racially segregated bar\nassociation, was not thereby disqualified from hearing plaintiffs’\nclaims of racial discrimination in the administration of the\nAlabama State Bar examination.      Parrish v. Bd. of Comm’rs of the\nAla. State Bar, 524 F.2d 98 (5th Cir. 1975).            Even though that\nfuture   judge   had   actually   taken   steps   to   change   the   bar’s\nsegregation policy, he was faulted by those who sought his recusal\nfor the failure of his effort to obtain membership for African-\nAmerican lawyers during his term of leadership.          Id. at 101.     We\nheld in Parrish that the allegation concerning the judge’s “past\nactivities in the Montgomery [Alabama] Bar Association [] is\nessentially an allegation based on the judge’s background and\nstates no specific facts that would suggest he would be anything\nbut impartial in the deciding the case before him.”         Id.\n     The facts in Parrish more closely parallel those presented in\nthis case than do the facts in the Bradshaw decision relied on by\nthe Republic of Panama I panel.     Even if the views expressed in the\namicus brief ten years earlier had been firmly held by the Judge at\nthe time that the brief was written (note that nothing other than\n\n\n                                    9\n\fhis membership in the amicus association and his prior presidency\nof it can be cited as evidence that in fact he held those views),\nthis    would   not     be   grounds     for   forced   recusal   under   the\njurisprudence of this or any other circuit.              More to the point,\nthat is not the question presented by the record in this case,\nwhich does not indicate that the Judge ever expressed any anti-\ntobacco sentiments, either publicly or privately, much less that he\never participated in any tobacco litigation whatsoever, whether as\na party or as counsel.        His only “taint” was his connection to a\nbar association that advocated, solely as a friend of the court, a\nsimilar position on similar litigation in state court almost a\ndecade earlier.       Such an attenuated nexus is woefully insufficient\nto underpin this court’s interference with the Judge’s decision,\nwhich was well within his discretion.\n       Equally important in sorting out this issue is the position\ntaken by the United States Supreme Court.            In Laird v. Tatum, 409\nU.S.   824   (1972)(Rehnquist,         J.,   mem.)   then-Associate   Justice\nRehnquist decided not to disqualify himself on the basis of public\nstatements he had made prior to his appointment to the bench.              As\na Department of Justice lawyer, he had testified as an expert\nwitness before the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on\nConstitutional Rights regarding the statutory and constitutional\nlaw dealing with the authority of the executive branch to gather\ninformation.    Notably, then-attorney Rehnquist’s remarks included\na reference to the very case involved (Laird), which then was\npending in the D.C. Circuit.             Id. at 825-27.     The respondents\ncontended that the Justice should disqualify himself because he had\npreviously expressed a public view concerning what the law is or\nought to be in the matters presented in the Laird litigation.             Id.\n\n\n                                        10\n\fat 824-25.   In declining to recuse, Justice Rehnquist stated:\n          Proof that a Justice’s mind at the time he\n          joined the court was a complete tabula rasa in\n          the area of constitutional adjudication would\n          be evidence of lack of qualification, not lack\n          of bias. . . .\n\n          The oath prescribed by 28 U.S.C. § 453 which\n          is taken by each person upon becoming a member\n          of the federal judiciary requires that he\n          “administer   justice   without   respect   to\n          persons, and do equal right to the poor and to\n          the rich,” that he “faithfully and impartially\n          discharge and perform all the duties incumbent\n          upon (him) . . . agreeably to the Constitution\n          and laws of the United States.”          Every\n          litigant is entitled to have his case heard by\n          a judge mindful of this oath. But neither the\n          oath, the disqualification statute, nor the\n          practice of the former Justices of this Court\n          guarantee a litigant that each judge will\n          start off from dead center in his willingness\n          or ability to reconcile the opposing arguments\n          of counsel with his understanding of the\n          Constitution and the law.      That being the\n          case, it is not a ground for disqualification\n          that a judge has prior to his nomination\n          expressed his then understanding of the\n          meaning of some particular provision of the\n          Constitution.\n\nId., 409 U.S. at 835; 838-39.\n\n     In addition to repudiating clear direction from both our own\n\nen banc court and the Supreme Court, the panel opinion disregards\n\nthe unanimous voices of other U.S. Courts of Appeals that have\n\naddressed the issue. For example, in Schurz Communications v. FCC,\n\n982 F.2d 1057 (7th Cir. 1992), Judge Richard Posner denied a\n\nrecusal motion that was based on an affidavit he had submitted as\n\nan expert witness fifteen years earlier in an antitrust case\n\ninvolving the identical question presented in the case in which his\n\n                                11\n\fdisqualification was being sought.    Judge Posner reasoned that if\n\n28 U.S.C. § 455(a) were interpreted to require recusal in such a\n\nsituation,\n\n          I would be eternally disqualified from\n          participating in antitrust or regulatory\n          cases, because when I was a law professor I\n          acted   frequently   as  a   consultant   and\n          occasionally   an   as  expert   witness   in\n          regulatory   and   antitrust   matters   that\n          presented the same types of issues, often in\n          the same industry, as do cases that come\n          before this court. No decision supports such\n          an interpretation.\n\n                              * * *\n\n          The affidavit repeated views about antitrust\n          policy that I had stated in many different\n          fora over a period of years, and the movants\n          do not and could not argue that a judge should\n          disqualify himself because he has views on a\n          case.\n\nId. at 1061-62.\n\n     Similarly, in a much more closely analogous case, Cipollone v.\n\nLiggett, 802 F.2d 658 (3rd Cir. 1986), the district judge had,\n\nwhile in private practice, represented a tobacco company in a case\n\ninvolving a products liability claim like the one currently pending\n\nbefore him as a judge.   The Third Circuit affirmed the district\n\ncourt’s decision not to recuse himself, stating:\n\n          [P]rior knowledge about legal issues is not a\n          ground for recusal of a Judge. . . .If Judges\n          could be disqualified because their knowledge\n          of legal issues which might be presented in\n          cases coming before them, then only the least-\n          informed and worst-prepared lawyers could be\n          appointed to the bench.\n\n\n                                12\n\fId. at 659-60.    See also United States v. Payne, 944 F.2d 1458 (9th\n\nCir. 1991)(rejecting the notion that generalized policy views,\n\nexpertise on and exposure to a subject necessitates recusal);\n\nUnited States v. Alabama, 828 F.2d 1532 (11th Cir. 1987)(holding\n\nthat district judge’s background representing plaintiffs in civil\n\nrights actions does not warrant disqualification in a school\n\ndesegregation case brought by United States against Alabama);\n\nRosquist   v.    Soo     Line   Railroad,    692   F.2d    1107    (7th      Cir.\n\n1982)(affirming a denial of recusal and holding that a judge is not\n\nrequired   to   recuse    himself   merely   because      he   holds   and    had\n\nexpressed certain views on a subject.)\n\n     In the instant litigation, the defendant tobacco companies\n\nimply that the fact that, in the old state case, the name of one of\n\ntoday’s opposing counsel was listed as counsel for the amicus\n\nassociation on the same pleading (motion for permission to file an\n\namicus brief) as was the name of the Judge (erroneously) as\n\npresident of the client association —— thereby evidencing that they\n\nbelonged to the same bar association —— requires recusal.                    This\n\nargument is so lacking in merit that it needs no further comment.\n\nAnother concern raised by the tobacco defendants is that the Judge\n\n“appeared” to have been involved in litigation against the same\n\ntobacco companies.       This too is feckless, as we have long rejected\n\nthis “identity of parties” argument.          For example, in Chitamacha\n\nTribe of Louisiana v. Harry L. Laws Co., Inc., 690 F.2d 1157 (5th\n\n\n                                     13\n\fCir. 1982), the presiding judge had, during his law practice prior\n\nto assuming the bench some six years earlier, represented Texaco,\n\ncurrently a defendant in the case before him, on an unrelated\n\nmatter. Id. at 1166.    Other defendants in the case were related to\n\npartners in the judge’s former law firm.      Id. at 1167.       We agreed\n\nwith the Judge that his recusal was not required, declaring his\n\nconnection with Texaco too remote and innocuous to warrant\n\n\n\ndisqualification.     If direct representation of a party (not an\n\namicus) six years earlier is too remote, surely mere membership in\n\nand past presidency of a bar association whose only nexus with the\n\nappeal then pending before the state supreme court was the filing\n\nof an amicus brief eight years earlier, relating to a common —— but\n\nnon-represented —— party, cannot require reversal of the Judge’s\n\nexercise of discretion not to recuse himself.\n\n     We can perceive no legitimate basis for disturbing the Judge’s\n\nexercise of discretion in this case and would affirm his denial of\n\nthe recusal motion.    We are satisfied that this issue cuts across\n\nideology, politics, and judicial philosophy, and that it has the\n\npotential   for   undermining   the    independence   of   the    federal\n\njudiciary. No existing jurisprudence supports, much less requires,\n\nrecusal of a judge who, years before taking the judicial oath, had\n\nexpressed an opinion on an issue of law, or had represented the\n\nsame or a related party, or had belonged to and held office in an\n\n\n                                  14\n\forganization that advocated a particular view of public policy or\n\nlegal interpretation.   Never before has any court accepted “issue\n\nrecusal” as a ground for reversing a judge who in his own exercise\n\nof discretion, concluded that his recusal was not required.    The\n\npanel decision that this court has refused to rehear en banc sets\n\nan alarming precedent by doing precisely that, and trivializes our\n\n\n\n\noath in the process.    For these reasons we are constrained to\n\ndissent from the refusal of a majority of the judges of this court\n\nto vote to rehear this case en banc.\n\n\n\n\n                                15\n\f",

WIENER and ROBERT M. PARKER, Circuit Judges, joined by CAROLYN DINEEN KING, PATRICK E. HIGGINBOTHAM, W. EUGENE DAVIS and JAMES L. DENNIS, Circuit Judges, dissenting from the Court's denial of the Petition for Rehearing En Banc:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The panel opinion for this case marks the first time in the history of American jurisprudence that an appellate court has reversed a trial judge's discretionary refusal to recuse himself    and has ordered the judge recused    based solely on the fact that many years earlier, while he was a practicing attorney, he had been linked (erroneously at that) with one view of a legal issue that was then pending in state court and only recently resurfaced in a case pending before him in federal court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>  The Petition for  Rehearing En Banc challenges the panel's holding that a federal district judge (\"the Judge\") abused his discretion by refusing to recuse himself pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 455(a), simply because he had been mistakenly identified, years before he became a judge, as having an \"association with the legal position\" now being espoused by one of the parties in a case pending before him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Petition for Panel Rehearing challenged the panel's holding that under those circumstances the Judge abused his discretion by not recusing himself pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 455(a). We respectfully but vigorously dissent from the refusal of a majority of the active judges of this court to rehear this matter en banc.  We would have granted rehearing en banc, not merely because we view the panel opinion<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> as wrongly decided, but primarily because the nature of the error committed in pronouncing that result dangerously erodes the discretion that Congress has assigned to federal judges in matters of recusal while opening a new, broad avenue for litigants to avoid appearing before a judge they perceive to be unfairly disinclined to favor their side of a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1998, the Republic of Panama filed suit alleging that the defendant tobacco companies conspired to conceal the addictiveness and health risks of tobacco and seeking compensation for health costs for diseases caused by smoking.  Republic of Panama I, 217 F.3d at 344.  The defendant tobacco companies removed the case to federal court.  Id. at 345.  In 1999, the tobacco companies sought to recuse the Judge, who had been assigned to the case.  Id.  The Judge exercised the discretion vested in him by statute, explaining in detail why he was denying the motion to recuse himself and remanding the action to state court.  Id.  On appeal, a panel of this court held that the Judge had abused his discretion, reversed his order denying recusal, vacated his order remanding the case to state court, and remanded the action to the district court for reassignment to a different judge.  Republic of Panama II, 250 F.3d at 316.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion to recuse was based solely on the fact that the Judge had been listed    erroneously    as the president of a specialized bar association (the Louisiana Trial Lawyer's Association (\"LTLA\")) on that organization's motion seeking permission to file an amicus curiae brief in similar state court tobacco litigation some nine years earlier.  The Judge's name did not appear on the amicus brief itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Almost a decade prior to his appointment to the federal trial bench, the Judge had served a one-year term as president of the LTLA, from approximately October 1989 - October 1990.  In April 1991, some six months after his term as president had expired, LTLA filed the subject motion seeking permission to file an amicus brief in the appeal of a tobacco products liability case in the Supreme Court of Louisiana.  Despite his being president no longer, the Judge's name was mistakenly listed as President of the LTLA on the \"Motion for Leave to File Amicus Curiae Brief\" which was filed simultaneously with the filing of the association's amicus brief.  The Judge signed neither the motion nor the brief, either as counsel or as an officer of the putative amicus association.  Listed among the counsel on this motion, however, was Michael St. Martin, who is also counsel for the plaintiff in the present action.  The amicus brief itself was not signed by Mr. St. Martin (or by the Judge) but by another attorney; neither did the brief or the motion list the Judge as counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although they were not identical to the allegations in the present case, the LTLA's 1991 amicus brief did contain allegations similar to those in the current litigation, including, inter alia, that smoking is addictive and that it causes cancer, and that the defendant tobacco companies knew or should have known about the health dangers of smoking.  The amicus brief argued that the tobacco companies should be held liable because they were negligent in producing their product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In denying the tobacco defendants' recusal motion in the present case, the Judge specifically informed the parties that, even though his name had been listed on the motion seeking permission to file the amicus brief in state court years ago, it had been placed on the motion by mistake; his term as president of LTLA had ended months before by the time the brief was filed.  The Judge further informed the parties that he had nothing to do with the research, writing, signing, or approval of the brief; and that neither as a practicing attorney nor in any other capacity had he ever participated in any tobacco litigation.  And the Judge also explained that the decision to file an amicus brief and the determination of the contents of the brief were exclusively governed by the LTLA Amicus Committee, not the president or executive committee of the association.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a motion to recuse for abuse of discretion.  Trevino v. Johnson, 168 F.3d 173, 178 (5th Cir. 1999).  A judge should recuse himself \"in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 455(a).  \"In order to determine whether a court's impartiality is reasonably in question, the objective inquiry is whether a well-informed, thoughtful and objective observer would question the court's impartiality.\"  Trust Co. v. N.N.P., 104 F.3d 1478, 1491 (5th Cir. 1997).  The purpose of &#167; 455(a) is to avoid even an appearance of partiality.  United States v. Jordan, 49 F.3d 152, 155 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are firmly convinced that no reasonable person, aware of all the facts, would question any judge's impartiality based on circumstances as attenuated as those presented by this case:  (1) The Judge's name was listed, erroneously and without his knowledge, on a motion to file an amicus curiae brief    not even the brief itself; (2) the motion and brief were filed on behalf of an association of which the future judge was a past president; (3) the motion was filed in a state court proceeding seven years before the Judge took the bench and eight years before the present lawsuit was filed; (4) the motion related to a legal issue in which the Judge had never been involved as a practicing attorney or otherwise; and (5) it was filed by lawyers for the association with whom the Judge has never been a partner or an associate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the tobacco companies urged a panel of this court to adopt the rule that any judge who had a \"pre-judicial association with the position\"    not with the parties, not with the lawyers, but with a \"position\"    can never fairly decide a case that raises questions pertaining to that \"position.\"  In buying into that proposition, the panel clearly called into question the oath we take when we become federal judges.  If we should embark on such a perilous course, we will launch a cottage industry in which investigators will comb the contents of speeches made, articles written, and pleadings and briefs filed by a judge prior to his taking of that oath, looking for some trace of evidence suggesting that, prior to his judgeship, the judge held views on legal questions that can be used to disqualify him from hearing cases that implicate such matters.  Nothing    not the statute, not our jurisprudence, not the public policy underlying the concept of recusal    supports the panel's decision to require the Judge's recusal under such attenuated circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Republic of Panama I correctly notes that this record includes no evidence of actual bias on the part of the Judge.  Republic of Panama I, 217 F.3d at 347.  It nevertheless concludes that nothing more than the mere listing of the Judge's name on a motion to file an amicus brief that years earlier had asserted allegations against tobacco companies similar to those asserted by the plaintiffs in this case, could lead a reasonable person to doubt the Judge's impartiality.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The panel's analysis of Republic of Panama I relies on but a single case, Bradshaw v. McCotter, 785 F.2d 1327 (5th Cir. 1986).  In Bradshaw, a criminal defendant argued that a judge on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals should have been disqualified because at the time of the defendant's conviction the future Judge's name was listed on a brief as State Prosecuting Attorney in the defendant's appeal.  Id. at 1328.  The judge in Bradshaw explained that in fact he had not participated in the prosecution of the case at all, and that his name had appeared on the brief simply as a matter of courtesy and protocol.  We held that whether the judge actually participated in the prosecution was immaterial because the listing of his name on the brief undermined the appearance of impartiality. Id. at 1329.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet, when carefully read, the opinion in Bradshaw makes pellucid that it does not present a \"somewhat similar fact situation\" to that in Republic of Panama I.  Republic of Panama I, 217 F.3d at 347.  The recusal ordered in Bradshaw was directed at a judge who was not just correctly listed on the State's brief as prosecuting attorney (albeit he did not personally participate in the prosecution), but who was in fact scheduled to hear the appeal of the very same case of the very same criminal defendant.  Bradshaw does not deal with a mere amicus; it is not a civil case; it does not involve a union, trade association, or bar association; it correctly identified the judge as the prosecuting attorney; and it implicated a substantive pleading    the appellate brief    not, as here, a non-substantive, procedural motion.  Because Bradshaw neither presents nor answers the questions raised by the instant case, it affords no support for the panel's decision to require the Judge's recusal under the present circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Bradshaw offers no map out of the present situation, we are not here navigating uncharted waters.  In an earlier en banc decision, this court held that a district judge who, before ever becoming a judge, served as president of a racially segregated bar association, was not thereby disqualified from hearing plaintiffs' claims of racial discrimination in the administration of the Alabama State Bar examination.  Parrish v. Bd. of Comm'rs of the Ala. State Bar, 524 F.2d 98 (5th Cir. 1975).  Even though that future judge had actually taken steps to change the bar's segregation policy, he was faulted by those who sought his recusal for the failure of his effort to obtain membership for African-American lawyers during his term of leadership.  Id. at 101.  We held in Parrish that the allegation concerning the judge's \"past activities in the Montgomery [Alabama] Bar Association [] is essentially an allegation based on the judge's background and states no specific facts that would suggest he would be anything but impartial in the deciding the case before him.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts in Parrish more closely parallel those presented in this case than do the facts in the Bradshaw decision relied on by the Republic of Panama I panel.  Even if the views expressed in the amicus brief ten years earlier had been firmly held by the Judge at the time that the brief was written (note that nothing other than his membership in the amicus association and his prior presidency of it can be cited as evidence that in fact he held those views), this would not be grounds for forced recusal under the jurisprudence of this or any other circuit.  More to the point, that is not the question presented by the record in this case, which does not indicate that the Judge ever expressed any anti-tobacco sentiments, either publicly or privately, much less that he ever participated in any tobacco litigation whatsoever, whether as a party or as counsel.  His only \"taint\" was his connection to a bar association that advocated, solely as a friend of the court, a similar position on similar litigation in state court almost a decade earlier.  Such an attenuated nexus is woefully insufficient to underpin this court's interference with the Judge's decision, which was well within his discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equally important in sorting out this issue is the position taken by the United States Supreme Court.  In Laird v. Tatum, 409 U.S. 824 (1972)(Rehnquist, J., mem.) then-Associate Justice Rehnquist decided not to disqualify himself on the basis of public statements he had made prior to his appointment to the bench.  As a Department of Justice lawyer, he had testified as an expert witness before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights regarding the statutory and constitutional law dealing with the authority of the executive branch to gather information.  Notably, then-attorney Rehnquist's remarks included a reference to the very case involved (Laird), which then was pending in the D.C. Circuit.  Id. at 825-27.  The respondents contended that the Justice should disqualify himself because he had previously expressed a public view concerning what the law is or ought to be in the matters presented in the Laird litigation.  Id. at 824-25.  In declining to recuse, Justice Rehnquist stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proof that a Justice's mind at the time he joined the court was a complete tabula rasa in the area of constitutional adjudication would be evidence of lack of qualification, not lack of bias.  . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The oath prescribed by 28 U.S.C. &#167; 453 which is taken by each person upon becoming a member of the federal judiciary requires that he \"administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich,\" that he \"faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon (him) . . . agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States.\"  Every litigant is entitled to have his case heard by a judge mindful of this oath.  But neither the oath, the disqualification statute, nor the practice of the former Justices of this Court guarantee a litigant that each judge will start off from dead center in his willingness or ability to reconcile the opposing arguments of counsel with his understanding of the Constitution and the law.  That being the case, it is not a ground for disqualification that a judge has prior to his nomination expressed his then understanding of the meaning of some particular provision of the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id., 409 U.S. at 835; 838-39.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to repudiating clear direction from both our own en banc court and the Supreme Court, the panel opinion disregards the unanimous voices of other U.S. Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue.  For example, in Schurz Communications v. FCC, 982 F.2d 1057 (7th Cir. 1992), Judge Richard Posner denied a recusal motion that was based on an affidavit he had submitted as an expert witness fifteen years earlier in an antitrust case involving the identical question presented in the case in which his disqualification was being sought.  Judge Posner reasoned that if 28 U.S.C. &#167; 455(a) were interpreted to require recusal in such a situation,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would be eternally disqualified from participating in antitrust or regulatory cases, because when I was a law professor I acted frequently as a consultant and occasionally an as expert witness in regulatory and antitrust matters that presented the same types of issues, often in the same industry, as do cases that come before this court.

The Third Circuit affirmed the district court's decision not to recuse himself, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[P]rior knowledge about legal issues is not a ground for recusal of a Judge.  . . .If Judges could be disqualified because their knowledge of legal issues which might be presented in cases coming before them, then only the least-informed and worst-prepared lawyers could be appointed to the bench.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 659-60.  See also United States v. Payne, 944 F.2d 1458 (9th Cir. 1991)(rejecting the notion that generalized policy views, expertise on and exposure to a subject necessitates recusal); United States v. Alabama, 828 F.2d 1532 (11th Cir. 1987)(holding that district judge's background representing plaintiffs in civil rights actions does not warrant disqualification in a school desegregation case brought by United States against Alabama);  Rosquist v. Soo Line Railroad, 692 F.2d 1107 (7th Cir. 1982)(affirming a denial of recusal and holding that a judge is not required to recuse himself merely because he holds and had expressed certain views on a subject.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant litigation, the defendant tobacco companies imply that the fact that, in the old state case, the name of one of today's opposing counsel was listed as counsel for the amicus association on the same pleading (motion for permission to file an amicus brief) as was the name of the Judge (erroneously) as president of the client association    thereby evidencing that they belonged to the same bar association    requires recusal.  This argument is so lacking in merit that it needs no further comment.  Another concern raised by the tobacco defendants is that the Judge \"appeared\" to have been involved in litigation against the same tobacco companies.  This too is feckless, as we have long rejected this \"identity of parties\" argument.  For example, in Chitamacha Tribe of Louisiana v. Harry L. Laws Co., Inc., 690 F.2d 1157 (5th Cir. 1982), the presiding judge had, during his law practice prior to assuming the bench some six years earlier, represented Texaco, currently a defendant in the case before him, on an unrelated matter.  Id. at 1166.  Other defendants in the case were related to partners in the judge's former law firm.  Id. at 1167.  We agreed with the Judge that his recusal was not required, declaring his connection with Texaco too remote and innocuous to warrant disqualification.  If direct representation of a party (not an amicus) six years earlier is too remote, surely mere membership in and past presidency of a bar association whose only nexus with the appeal then pending before the state supreme court was the filing of an amicus brief eight years earlier, relating to a common    but non-represented    party, cannot require reversal of the Judge's exercise of discretion not to recuse himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can perceive no legitimate basis for disturbing the Judge's exercise of discretion in this case and would affirm his denial of the recusal motion.  We are satisfied that this issue cuts across ideology, politics, and judicial philosophy, and that it has the potential for undermining the independence of the federal judiciary.  No existing jurisprudence supports, much less requires, recusal of a judge who, years before taking the judicial oath, had expressed an opinion on an issue of law, or had represented the same or a related party, or had belonged to and held office in an organization that advocated a particular view of public policy or legal interpretation.  Never before has any court accepted \"issue recusal\" as a ground for reversing a judge who in his own exercise of discretion, concluded that his recusal was not required.  The panel decision that this court has refused to rehear en banc sets an alarming precedent by doing precisely that, and trivializes our oath in the process.  For these reasons we are constrained to dissent from the refusal of a majority of the judges of this court to vote to rehear this case en banc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Republic of Panama I, 217 F.3d at 347.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The panel opinion in this matter, Republic of Panama v.

We respectfully but vigorously dissent from the refusal of a majority of the active judges of this court to rehear this matter en banc.  We would have granted rehearing en banc, not merely because we view the panel opinion<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> as wrongly decided, but primarily because the nature of the error committed in pronouncing that result dangerously erodes the discretion that Congress has assigned to federal judges in matters of recusal while opening a new, broad avenue for litigants to avoid appearing before a judge they perceive to be unfairly disinclined to favor their side of a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1998, the Republic of Panama filed suit alleging that the defendant tobacco companies conspired to conceal the addictiveness and health risks of tobacco and seeking compensation for health costs for diseases caused by smoking.  Republic of Panama I, 217 F.3d at 344.  The defendant tobacco companies removed the case to federal court.  Id. at 345.  In 1999, the tobacco companies sought to recuse the Judge, who had been assigned to the case.  Id.  The Judge exercised the discretion vested in him by statute, explaining in detail why he was denying the motion to recuse himself and remanding the action to state court.  Id.  On appeal, a panel of this court held that the Judge had abused his discretion, reversed his order denying recusal, vacated his order remanding the case to state court, and remanded the action to the district court for reassignment to a different judge.  Republic of Panama II, 250 F.3d at 316.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion to recuse was based solely on the fact that the Judge had been listed    erroneously    as the president of a specialized bar association (the Louisiana Trial Lawyer's Association (\"LTLA\")) on that organization's motion seeking permission to file an amicus curiae brief in similar state court tobacco litigation some nine years earlier.  The Judge's name did not appear on the amicus brief itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Almost a decade prior to his appointment to the federal trial bench, the Judge had served a one-year term as president of the LTLA, from approximately October 1989 - October 1990.  In April 1991, some six months after his term as president had expired, LTLA filed the subject motion seeking permission to file an amicus brief in the appeal of a tobacco products liability case in the Supreme Court of Louisiana.  Despite his being president no longer, the Judge's name was mistakenly listed as President of the LTLA on the \"Motion for Leave to File Amicus Curiae Brief\" which was filed simultaneously with the filing of the association's amicus brief.  The Judge signed neither the motion nor the brief, either as counsel or as an officer of the putative amicus association.  Listed among the counsel on this motion, however, was Michael St. Martin, who is also counsel for the plaintiff in the present action.  The amicus brief itself was not signed by Mr. St. Martin (or by the Judge) but by another attorney; neither did the brief or the motion list the Judge as counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although they were not identical to the allegations in the present case, the LTLA's 1991 amicus brief did contain allegations similar to those in the current litigation, including, inter alia, that smoking is addictive and that it causes cancer, and that the defendant tobacco companies knew or should have known about the health dangers of smoking.  The amicus brief argued that the tobacco companies should be held liable because they were negligent in producing their product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In denying the tobacco defendants' recusal motion in the present case, the Judge specifically informed the parties that, even though his name had been listed on the motion seeking permission to file the amicus brief in state court years ago, it had been placed on the motion by mistake; his term as president of LTLA had ended months before by the time the brief was filed.  The Judge further informed the parties that he had nothing to do with the research, writing, signing, or approval of the brief; and that neither as a practicing attorney nor in any other capacity had he ever participated in any tobacco litigation.  And the Judge also explained that the decision to file an amicus brief and the determination of the contents of the brief were exclusively governed by the LTLA Amicus Committee, not the president or executive committee of the association.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a motion to recuse for abuse of discretion.

A judge should recuse himself \"in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 455(a).  \"In order to determine whether a court's impartiality is reasonably in question, the objective inquiry is whether a well-informed, thoughtful and objective observer would question the court's impartiality.\"  Trust Co. v.

The purpose of &#167; 455(a) is to avoid even an appearance of partiality.  United States v. Jordan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7011\"><a href=\"/opinion/7011/united-states-v-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span>, 155 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are firmly convinced that no reasonable person, aware of all the facts, would question any judge's impartiality based on circumstances as attenuated as those presented by this case:  (1) The Judge's name was listed, erroneously and without his knowledge, on a motion to file an amicus curiae brief    not even the brief itself; (2) the motion and brief were filed on behalf of an association of which the future judge was a past president; (3) the motion was filed in a state court proceeding seven years before the Judge took the bench and eight years before the present lawsuit was filed; (4) the motion related to a legal issue in which the Judge had never been involved as a practicing attorney or otherwise; and (5) it was filed by lawyers for the association with whom the Judge has never been a partner or an associate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the tobacco companies urged a panel of this court to adopt the rule that any judge who had a \"pre-judicial association with the position\"    not with the parties, not with the lawyers, but with a \"position\"    can never fairly decide a case that raises questions pertaining to that \"position.\"  In buying into that proposition, the panel clearly called into question the oath we take when we become federal judges.  If we should embark on such a perilous course, we will launch a cottage industry in which investigators will comb the contents of speeches made, articles written, and pleadings and briefs filed by a judge prior to his taking of that oath, looking for some trace of evidence suggesting that, prior to his judgeship, the judge held views on legal questions that can be used to disqualify him from hearing cases that implicate such matters.  Nothing    not the statute, not our jurisprudence, not the public policy underlying the concept of recusal    supports the panel's decision to require the Judge's recusal under such attenuated circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Republic of Panama I correctly notes that this record includes no evidence of actual bias on the part of the Judge.  Republic of Panama I, 217 F.3d at 347.  It nevertheless concludes that nothing more than the mere listing of the Judge's name on a motion to file an amicus brief that years earlier had asserted allegations against tobacco companies similar to those asserted by the plaintiffs in this case, could lead a reasonable person to doubt the Judge's impartiality.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The panel's analysis of Republic of Panama I relies on but a single case, Bradshaw v. McCotter, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"466299\"><a href=\"/opinion/466299/alfred-ray-bradshaw-v-ol-mccotter-director-texas-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">785</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1327</span></a></span> (5th Cir. 1986).  In Bradshaw, a criminal defendant argued that a judge on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals should have been disqualified because at the time of the defendant's conviction the future Judge's name was listed on a brief as State Prosecuting Attorney in the defendant's appeal.  Id. at 1328.  The judge in Bradshaw explained that in fact he had not participated in the prosecution of the case at all, and that his name had appeared on the brief simply as a matter of courtesy and protocol.  We held that whether the judge actually participated in the prosecution was immaterial because the listing of his name on the brief undermined the appearance of impartiality. Id. at 1329.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet, when carefully read, the opinion in Bradshaw makes pellucid that it does not present a \"somewhat similar fact situation\" to that in Republic of Panama I.  Republic of Panama I, 217 F.3d at 347.  The recusal ordered in Bradshaw was directed at a judge who was not just correctly listed on the State's brief as prosecuting attorney (albeit he did not personally participate in the prosecution), but who was in fact scheduled to hear the appeal of the very same case of the very same criminal defendant.  Bradshaw does not deal with a mere amicus; it is not a civil case; it does not involve a union, trade association, or bar association; it correctly identified the judge as the prosecuting attorney; and it implicated a substantive pleading    the appellate brief    not, as here, a non-substantive, procedural motion.  Because Bradshaw neither presents nor answers the questions raised by the instant case, it affords no support for the panel's decision to require the Judge's recusal under the present circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Bradshaw offers no map out of the present situation, we are not here navigating uncharted waters.  In an earlier en banc decision, this court held that a district judge who, before ever becoming a judge, served as president of a racially segregated bar association, was not thereby disqualified from hearing plaintiffs' claims of racial discrimination in the administration of the Alabama State Bar examination.  Parrish v. Bd. of Comm'rs of the Ala. State Bar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"330579\"><a href=\"/opinion/330579/alfredo-g-parrish-etc-v-board-of-commissioners-of-the-alabama-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span> (5th Cir. 1975).  Even though that future judge had actually taken steps to change the bar's segregation policy, he was faulted by those who sought his recusal for the failure of his effort to obtain membership for African-American lawyers during his term of leadership.  Id. at 101.  We held in Parrish that the allegation concerning the judge's \"past activities in the Montgomery [Alabama] Bar Association [] is essentially an allegation based on the judge's background and states no specific facts that would suggest he would be anything but impartial in the deciding the case before him.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts in Parrish more closely parallel those presented in this case than do the facts in the Bradshaw decision relied on by the Republic of Panama I panel.  Even if the views expressed in the amicus brief ten years earlier had been firmly held by the Judge at the time that the brief was written (note that nothing other than his membership in the amicus association and his prior presidency of it can be cited as evidence that in fact he held those views), this would not be grounds for forced recusal under the jurisprudence of this or any other circuit.  More to the point, that is not the question presented by the record in this case, which does not indicate that the Judge ever expressed any anti-tobacco sentiments, either publicly or privately, much less that he ever participated in any tobacco litigation whatsoever, whether as a party or as counsel.  His only \"taint\" was his connection to a bar association that advocated, solely as a friend of the court, a similar position on similar litigation in state court almost a decade earlier.  Such an attenuated nexus is woefully insufficient to underpin this court's interference with the Judge's decision, which was well within his discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equally important in sorting out this issue is the position taken by the United States Supreme Court.  In Laird v. Tatum, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108668\"><a href=\"/opinion/108668/melvin-r-laird-secretary-of-defense-v-arlo-tatum/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span> (1972)(Rehnquist, J., mem.) then-Associate Justice Rehnquist decided not to disqualify himself on the basis of public statements he had made prior to his appointment to the bench.  As a Department of Justice lawyer, he had testified as an expert witness before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights regarding the statutory and constitutional law dealing with the authority of the executive branch to gather information.  Notably, then-attorney Rehnquist's remarks included a reference to the very case involved (Laird), which then was pending in the D.C. Circuit.  Id. at 825-27.  The respondents contended that the Justice should disqualify himself because he had previously expressed a public view concerning what the law is or ought to be in the matters presented in the Laird litigation.  Id. at 824-25.  In declining to recuse, Justice Rehnquist stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proof that a Justice's mind at the time he joined the court was a complete tabula rasa in the area of constitutional adjudication would be evidence of lack of qualification, not lack of bias.  . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The oath prescribed by 28 U.S.C. &#167; 453 which is taken by each person upon becoming a member of the federal judiciary requires that he \"administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich,\" that he \"faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon (him) . . . agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States.\"  Every litigant is entitled to have his case heard by a judge mindful of this oath.  But neither the oath, the disqualification statute, nor the practice of the former Justices of this Court guarantee a litigant that each judge will start off from dead center in his willingness or ability to reconcile the opposing arguments of counsel with his understanding of the Constitution and the law.  That being the case, it is not a ground for disqualification that a judge has prior to his nomination expressed his then understanding of the meaning of some particular provision of the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id., 409 U.S. at 835; 838-39.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to repudiating clear direction from both our own en banc court and the Supreme Court, the panel opinion disregards the unanimous voices of other U.S. Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue.  For example, in Schurz Communications v. FCC, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1057</span></span> (7th Cir. 1992), Judge Richard Posner denied a recusal motion that was based on an affidavit he had submitted as an expert witness fifteen years earlier in an antitrust case involving the identical question presented in the case in which his disqualification was being sought.  Judge Posner reasoned that if 28 U.S.C. &#167; 455(a) were interpreted to require recusal in such a situation,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would be eternally disqualified from participating in antitrust or regulatory cases, because when I was a law professor I acted frequently as a consultant and occasionally an as expert witness in regulatory and antitrust matters that presented the same types of issues, often in the same industry, as do cases that come before this court.

The Third Circuit affirmed the district court's decision not to recuse himself, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[P]rior knowledge about legal issues is not a ground for recusal of a Judge.  . . .If Judges could be disqualified because their knowledge of legal issues which might be presented in cases coming before them, then only the least-informed and worst-prepared lawyers could be appointed to the bench.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 659-60.

This argument is so lacking in merit that it needs no further comment.  Another concern raised by the tobacco defendants is that the Judge \"appeared\" to have been involved in litigation against the same tobacco companies.  This too is feckless, as we have long rejected this \"identity of parties\" argument.  For example, in Chitamacha Tribe of Louisiana v. Harry L. Laws Co., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409613\"><a href=\"/opinion/409613/the-chitimacha-tribe-of-louisiana-v-harry-l-laws-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1157</span></a></span> (5th Cir. 1982), the presiding judge had, during his law practice prior to assuming the bench some six years earlier, represented Texaco, currently a defendant in the case before him, on an unrelated matter.  Id. at 1166.  Other defendants in the case were related to partners in the judge's former law firm.  Id. at 1167.  We agreed with the Judge that his recusal was not required, declaring his connection with Texaco too remote and innocuous to warrant disqualification.  If direct representation of a party (not an amicus) six years earlier is too remote, surely mere membership in and past presidency of a bar association whose only nexus with the appeal then pending before the state supreme court was the filing of an amicus brief eight years earlier, relating to a common    but non-represented    party, cannot require reversal of the Judge's exercise of discretion not to recuse himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can perceive no legitimate basis for disturbing the Judge's exercise of discretion in this case and would affirm his denial of the recusal motion.  We are satisfied that this issue cuts across ideology, politics, and judicial philosophy, and that it has the potential for undermining the independence of the federal judiciary.  No existing jurisprudence supports, much less requires, recusal of a judge who, years before taking the judicial oath, had expressed an opinion on an issue of law, or had represented the same or a related party, or had belonged to and held office in an organization that advocated a particular view of public policy or legal interpretation.  Never before has any court accepted \"issue recusal\" as a ground for reversing a judge who in his own exercise of discretion, concluded that his recusal was not required.  The panel decision that this court has refused to rehear en banc sets an alarming precedent by doing precisely that, and trivializes our oath in the process.  For these reasons we are constrained to dissent from the refusal of a majority of the judges of this court to vote to rehear this case en banc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Republic of Panama I, 217 F.3d at 347.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The panel opinion in this matter, Republic of Panama v.

Both of these cases involve identical facts and decisions regarding the recusal issue at both the trial and appellate level.
