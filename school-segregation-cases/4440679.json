Plaintiff has made written demand upon the Defendant for payment of the\n\nbalances owed for legal services provided, and Plaintiff would show the Court that the recovery\n\nof attorneys' fees is authorized, made, and provided, under and according to Chapter 38 of the\n\nTexas Civil Practice & Remedies Code, and Plaintiff further sues Defendant for reasonable\n\nattorneys' fees, which Plaintiff alleges to be in at least the sum of $70,000.00.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff\"s Original Petit/On\nJ.

Bennett White, P.C. (\"JEW, PC\"), Petitioner, filing this Motion to\n\n          Disqualify J. Keith Mayo and Mayo Mendolia & Vice, L.L.P as attorneys for Defendant,\n\n          Wendell Reeder (\"Reeder\"), and would show to the Court as follows:\n\n                       Summary ofMotion: Defendant's law firm should be disqualified\n                 because it now employs a legal assistant previously employed by Plaintiff.\n\n                 1.      Jennifer Smith (\"Smith\") is currently employed as a legal assistant by Mayo\n\n          Mendolia & Vice, L.L.P (\"Ml'vIV\"). She was previously employed by J. Bennett White, P.C. in\n\n          that same capacity. During the time Smith was employed by JEW, PC, she was privy to JEW,\n\n          PC's privileged and confidential information.         With this being a lawsuit for collection of\n\n          attorneys' fees owed, Smith's employment with MMV subjects her to competing loyalties in\n\n          honoring the client confidences gained while working at JEW, PC against her cun-ent obligation\n\n          of loyalty to M1v1V and its clients. MMV's representation of Reeder jeopardizes Smith's ability\n\n          to honor Plaintiff's confidences.\n\n                 2.      More importantly, as an employee of JEW, PC, Smith has first-hand knowledge\n\n          of the conectness of Plaintiff's claim against Reeder. In fact, some portion of the amount owed\n\n          is for services perfonned by Smith. Based on Smith's personal knowledge of the validity of\n\n          Plaintiffs claim and the potential that she could be called as a witness,   P~S/;\\Nt.J.EQ\n\n                                                                                                                 0013\n\f06/11/2015 THU 13: 08    FAX 903 597     4330   J   BENNETT WHITE PC,           ATTY                                      id!004/005\n\n\n\n\n          be prejudiced by her knO\\vledge that to provide truthful testimony would be detiimenta I to her\n\n          employment with Ml\\IIV and to Reeder.

Prior to that time I had\n                 done work for Clarksville Oil and Gas, a company operated by Mr. Reeder, but I\n                 had not done any significant work for him, individually. During that meeting, he\n                 told me about having recently lost a trial in which he was sued in Wood County,\n                 Texas. As a result of the recent trial, Mr. Reeder had a judgment entered against\n                 him in excess of one million dollars. During that meeting, he inquired whether\n                 appealing the judgment was something that my office could do. I indicated that\n                 we could, that I had extensive experience in appellate matters, and that I was\n                 willing to investigate the prospects for a successful appeal.

Mr. Reeder\n                    indicated that there was a chance the buyer would complete that transaction. I\n                    again agreed to await payment until that transaction could be consummated. Mr.\n                    Reeder continued to keep me infonned on the status of the closing. I had\n                    approximately 13 phone conversations with Mr. Reeder regarding the status of\n                    the closing from January, 2015 until the end of March, 2015. Further on\n                    February 27, 2015, Mr. Reeder sent a letter included with a pattial payment in\n                    which he expressed his hopefulness that the balance owed would soon be paid.\n                    A copy of the letter sent by Mr. Reeder is attached hereto as Exhibit 14. The\n                    closing finally occurred in March, 2015. Once that transaction was completed, I\n                    expected Mr. Reeder to make payment in full. On Jv1arch 23, 2015, Mr. Reeder\n                    called and asked to come to my office to settle up his account balances.\n\n                            \"When Mr. Reeder atTived, he met with my legal assistant Tw-yla Fields\n                    and me. In that meeting, he expressed some concerns about certain billing items\n                    and indicated that he did not want to have to pay the full balance. In an effort to\n                    get the bill reduced, Mr. Reeder raised several complaints. First, he expressed\n                    concern about what he thought were duplicate time entries in consecutive months\n                    on the Fry Appeal matter. Specifically, he thought that he was charged for the\n                    same work done in two consecutive months, May, 2009 and June, 2009. I pulled\n                    copies of those invoices and noticed multiple entries for reviewing the clerk's\n                    record and the reporter's record. I explained to Mr. Reeder that the billing\n                    records indicated that my associate at the time, Chris rviassey, was taking the\n\n         A,{lidCNil ofJ Be /Ille ti White\n         J Bew1ett White.

I reminded Mr.\n                     Reeder that since my firm had not been involved in the trial in Wood County, the\n                     entire transcript had to be read in order to prepare the statement of facts po1tion\n                     of the appellant brief I also reminded Mr. Reeder that the trial had been lengthy\n                     with a large number of exhibits -- which all had to be reviewed as well. I assured\n                     him that anyone handling an appeal of that judgment would have had to do all\n                     the same work and would have charged him for that time, just as we had.\n\n                             \"Mr. Reeder then faulted the result from the initial appeal and stated that\n                     the only work that accomplished anything was the work that was done at the\n                     Texas Supreme Court. He did concede that the results there were positive, but he\n                     attributed that work to the lawyers at Locke Lord Bissell & Liddell, LLP, which\n                     served as lead attorneys during the Supreme Comt appeal.\n\n                             \"However, Mr. Reeder also agreed with me that the Supreme Comt\n                     ultimately vindicated the position we had taken with the Comt of Appeals. I\n                     con-ected Nlr. Reeder's belief that Locke Lord handled the entire proceeding\n                     before the Supreme Comt. I pulled up a copy of the original petition for review\n                     filed with the Supreme Court and showed to him that the only attorneys on that\n                     petition were those attorneys associated with J. Bennett White, P.C. I reminded\n                     him that Locke Lord was not willing to be hired unless the Supreme Court either\n                     granted the petition or requested briefing on the merits. The Supreme Court\n                     eventually granted the petition and Locke Lord then made its appearance for\n                     purposes of drafting the principal brief and participating in oral argument;\n                     however, the initial petition for review was drafted and filed by J. Bennett White,\n                     P.C.\n\n                            \"Mr. Reeder then insisted that with all the money that he had paid, the\n                     balance he cum;ntly owes should just be forgiven. In making this point, Mr.\n                     Reeder chose to aggregate the payments he had made with all the payments\n                     made by Clarksville Oil & Gas and its affiliated companies. I reminded him that\n                     nonpayment for work performed was not our deal. I did not dispute that\n                     Clarksville Oil and Gas had paid J. Bennett White, P.C. a substantial amount of\n                     money, but I assured him that all money \\Vas paid in exchange for services that\n                     were already provided to Clarksville Oil and Gas. There had never been any\n                     agreement to provide services for free or to waive fees or charges that were\n                     legitimately incuITed on his behalf He then stated that the closing had simply\n                     not produced enough funds to pay the entire balance, but that he still did not\n                     believe that the balances that were reflected on our accounts were accurate. I\n                     told him that my office would reconcile the account balances with his records\n                     and would coordinate with his staff to get that done.\n\n                            \"Over the next week, my office spent approximately 26 hours\n                     reconstmcting all the billing records and reconciling the allocation of payments\n                     between the way that the payments were applied by J.

During a portion of the time that Plaintiff represented Mr.\n\nReeder, a legal assistant named Jennifer Smith worked for Plaintiff.\n\n        On April 14, 2015, Mr. Reeder retained the undersigned counsel to represent him\n\nindividually, as well as in a number of other business and litigation related matters. The majority\n\nof these matters were previously handled by Plaintiffs firm. On the same day as the undersigned\n\ncounsel was retained by Mr. Reeder, Plaintiff filed this suit suing Mr. Reeder for alleged unpaid legal\n\nfees.\n\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT WENDELL REED ER'S RESPONSE\nAND BRIEF IN SUPPORT TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY                                       PAGEl\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          0082\n\f        Prior to being retained by Mr. Reeder, the undersigned counsel was contacted by Ms. Smith\n\nwho inquired about a position with the undersigned's law office. 1 Ms. Smith was re-hired by Mayo\n\nMendolia & Vice, LLP on April 16, 2015.\n\n        Prior to the retention of Mr. Reeder as a client, there were other cases in which both the law\n\noffice of Mayo Mendolia & Vice, LLP and Plaintiff were involved. Therefore, when Ms. Smith was\n\nre-hired by Mayo Mendolia & Vice, LLP, the undersigned counsel had already contemplated the\n\nsegregation of Ms. Smith from these files as a matter of precaution. At the time of Ms. Smith's re-\n\nhire, all cases in which Mayo Mendolia & Vice, LLP were involved in any capacity with Plaintiffs\n\noffice were disclosed to Ms. Smith. Instruction was issued by the undersigned counsel to Ms. Smith\n\nand all firm personnel that Ms. Smith was to field no calls associated with these files, was not to\n\naccess these files via the firm server or by viewing the hard files, and was not to discuss these files,\n\neven in casual conversation, with any firm employee or partner until further notice from the\n\nundersigned counsel. All of these files were assigned to another legal assistant in the office and the\n\nhard files were placed in a segregated office from Ms. Smith's office.\n\n       Since the commencement of Ms. Smith's employment with this office, the utmost care has\n\nbeen taken to segregate Ms. Smith from any file in which she may have had prior involvement. To\n\ndate, Ms. Smith has remained completely isolated from any file where representation, at some point,\n\nmay have been by Plaintiffs office. This statement is particularly true in relation to the files,\n\nincluding this one, associated with Mr. Reeder.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      Ms. Smith had previously worked for Mayo Mendolia & Vice, LLP, and formerly for\nMayo Mendolia & Stan-, LLP, from 2008 until March 2012.\n\nDEFENDANT WENDELL REEDER'S RESPONSE\nAND BRIEF IN SUPPORT TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY                                        PAGE2\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           0083\n\f                                 Evidence in Support of Response\n\n1.      Affidavit of J. Keith Mayo- attached hereto as Exhibit \"A\" and incorporated herein by\n\n        reference.\n\n                                                   11.\n                                     Argument and Authorities\n\n        The Texas Rules of Professional Conduct were made and incorporated so that attorneys in\n\nthe state of Texas would not act unprofessionally and unethically when representing the interests of\n\ntheir clients or in any situation where a lack of ethics will have negative effects on an involved party.\n\nThis is not one of those cases. Ms. Smith has not done any work on the Bennett v. Reeder case since\n\nbeginning work at the Mayo, Mendolia & Vice, nor has she divulged any confidential information\n\nabout the case to anyone at the firm. Since the Defendant's attorney properly screened Ms. Smith and\n\nmade sure she did not divulge any information concerning this action, the Court should not grant the\n\nPlaintiffs motion to disqualify and allow the Defendant' s attorney to participate in this trial.\n\nI.     Ms. Smith was properly screened about the matter before any\n       work was done on the case.\n\n       In America, federal antitrust laws give prospective employees the right to solicit their own\n\nemployment and choose from any job offer that is presented to them. Spectrum Sports, Inc. v.\n\nMcQuillan, 506 U.S. 447 (1993). Disqualifying the Defendant's Attorney simply because he hired\n\nan employee, an employee with a sterling reputation in the legal industry, would not only be a\n\nmiscarriage of justice, but would violate Section II of the Sherman Antitrust Act. It is not\n\nunreasonable to believe that attorneys in the Tyler, Texas area, where Ms. Smith lives, would be\n\nregular opponents in Court so this disqualification effectively bars Ms. Smith from working as a\n\nparalegal anywhere in the area she lives. This cannot be the intent of the Texas Rules of Professional\n\nDEFENDANT WENDELL REEDER'S RESPONSE\nAND BRIEF IN SUPPORT TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY                                         PAGE3\n\n\n\n                                                                                                            0084\n\fConduct pertaining to disqualification. The Texas Supreme Court agrees. Because a potential\n\nemployer would be less inclined to hire paralegals due to the threat of disqualification, the Court held\n\nthat any restrictions on the non-lawyer should be held to the minimum necessary to protect\n\nconfidentiality. Phoenix Founders, Inc. v. Marshall, 87 S. W.2d 831, 835 (1994).\n\n       The court held that a non-lawyer employee must be cautioned not to disclose any information\n\nrelating to the representation of a client of the former employer and should also be instructed to not\n\nwork on any matter on which the employee worked during the prior employment. Phoenix Founders,\n\n87 S.W.2d 831, 835. In this case, the Defendant's attorney instructed Ms. Smith not to disclose any\n\ninformation or to work on any matter that she worked on as a member of the Plaintiffs firm. Not\n\nonly has Ms. Smith not disclosed any information, but she hasn't been anywhere near any of the\n\nwork done on aforementioned matters.\n\n       The Court also calls for \"other reasonable steps\" to be made to ensure that no information\n\nis leaked. Id. When this case was brought to the Defendant's attorney's firm, Ms. Smith was\n\ncompletely segregated from all the work. The files were made unavailable for her access. The\n\nphysical files were moved to a segregated ofiice and Ms. Smith was again instructed not to access\n\nthose files. Furthermore, staff was instructed to isolate Ms. Smith from any phone calls related to\n\nthese cases and this case in particular.\n\n       The distinct possibility of Ms. Smith using this information is not enough to disqualify the\n\nDefendant's attorney. The Defendant's attorney took the necessary steps to ensure that Ms. Smith\n\nwould not divulge any information at all concerning her work on these files while employed by\n\nPlaintiff. Defendant should be allowed to participate in this case and vigorously defend his client.\n\nOur State's highest court made this ruling because it did not want to create a chilling effect on the\n\nDEFENDANT WENDELL REEDER'S RESPONSE\nAND BRIEF IN SUPPORT TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY                                        PAGE4\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           0085\n\femployment of capable paralegals when the risk of divulging confidential or competing information\n\nhas been duly controlled by measured steps.\n\nII.    Ms. Smith does not present a genuine threat of disclosure of the information.\n\n\n       The Texas Rules of Professional Conduct do not allow a lawyer who has previously\n\nrepresented a client to use information that would create a disadvantage for the former client. Tex.\n\nR. Prof. Conduct l .09(a)(3). These same rules apply to legal assistants and clerks under direct\n\nsupervision of partners in law firms as well. Texas. R. Prof. Conduct 5.03(b)(l). In Texas, the\n\nburden of proof is on the movant to disqualify opposing council by establishing, by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence, that the matter in question is substantially related to matters previously worked on\n\nby the attorney or legal assistant, that there is a genuine threat of disclosure, and [the movant] must\n\nhave factual evidence to support this. Home fns . Co. v. Marsh, 790 S.W.2d 749, 753 (1990). Neither\n\nparty disputes the fact that Ms. Smith worked directly on this case. In fact, Ms. Smith was one of\n\nthree legal assistants employed by the Plaintiff with access to confidential information about this\n\ncase. Ms. Smith has taken on a full caseload at the Defendant's attorney's firm and has been\n\noccupied with other, unrelated work since taking the job. The Defendant's attorney has two [other]\n\nlegal assistants and a clerk working on the matter at hand and they have been instructed not to speak\n\nabout the matter to Ms. Smith. Ms. Smith has been otherwise occupied the entire time she has been\n\nemployed by the Defendant's attorney and has not assisted any employee or member of the firm in\n\nhandling this case, thus she is not a legitimate threat to divulge information.\n\n       Unless opposing council can submit evidence that proves Ms. Smith is a threat to divulge\n\nconfidential information, it is not proper for the Defendant' s Attorney to excuse himself from\n\n\nDEFENDANT WENDELL REEDER'S RESPONSE\nAND BRIEF IN SUPPORT TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY                                       PAGES\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          0086\n\fworking on this case. Defendant respectfully requests that the Court DENY Plaintiffs request for\n\nthese reasons.\n\n\nIII.   Ms. Smith has not spoken of or worked on any matter related to her employment by\n       the Plaintiff.\n\n\n       Now, the court must question whether the proper effect of screening has occurred.\n\n\"Ordinarily, disqualification is not required as long as the practical effect of formal screening has\n\nbeen achieved.\" Jn Re Complex Asbestos Litigation, 232 Cal.App.3d 572, 596. The challenged\n\nattorney must show that the employee in question has not and will not disclose any of the relevant\n\ninformation. Asbestos, 232 Cal.App.3d 572, 596.\n\n       Since leaving the Plaintiffs firm, Ms. Smith has not worked on or spoken of any matter that\n\nshe worked on during her time as an employee of the Plaintiff. As a dedicated employee, Ms. Smith\n\nunderstands the importance of a client's right to privilege and that leaking any information related\n\nto this matter would be unethical. Despite her vigorous screening and all the extreme measures taken\n\nto create a Chinese Wall, if Ms. Smith were to leak information, the Defendant's attorney would\n\nhave no choice but to disqualify himself. id\n\n       Ms. Smith was specifically told not to work the case and or look over the files. She did not\n\nsay a word about the case to anyone at the firm. When the Defondant's attorney screened Ms. Smith,\n\nhe became aware of her knowledge of this case and took the proper steps to make sure she would\n\nnot volunteer any confidential information. Despite the fact that she has complete knowledge of the\n\ncase, Ms. Smith has not broken privileged with her former employer. The legal assistants and clerk\n\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT WENDELL REED ER'S RESPONSE\nAND BRIEF IN SUPPORT TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO lJISQUt\\LIFY                                   PAGE6\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        0087\n\fworking on the case were also instructed not to speak with Ms. Smith under any circumstances about\n\nthe case.\n\n                                                Conclusion\n\n        Because Ms. Smith has been properly screened and has not worked on or divulged any\n\nconfidential information concerning the matter at hand, the Defendant's attorney should not be\n\ndisqualified from working on this case. None of the actions taken by Mayo, Mendolia & Vice, LLP\n\nviolate the Texas Rules of Professional Conduct with respect to conflicts of interest. Disqualifying\n\nthe Defendant's attorney would not only severely inhibit the Defendant's case, but would violate\n\nfederal antitrust laws and keep Ms. Smith from effecti vcly providing for her family because no firms\n\nin the Tyler, Texas area who have any working relationship wiLh the Plaintiff would hire her. Ms.\n\nSmith was told not to work on the case and has not worked on the case. Since none of Ms. Smith's\n\nactions while working for the Defendant's attorney endangers the Plaintiffs right to confidence, the\n\nDefendant therefore requests that the Court deny his motion for disqualification of the Defendant's\n\nattorney, and requests such other and further relief as to which Defendant may show himself justly\n\nentitled.\n\n                                              Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                              MAYO MENDOLIA & VICE, L.L.P.\n                                              I I 0 N.

Procedurally, a Motion for Summary Judgment is premature as\n\nDefendant has had virtually no opportunity to complete or even begin discovery. A timeline of\n\nthe proceeding in this case are as follows:\n\n       4/14/15         Plaintiff’s Original Petition filed.\n\n       6/1/15          Defendant Wendell Reeder’s Original Answer and General Denial filed.\n\n       6/11/15         Motion to Disqualify J.

A\n\nNotice of Appearance of Additional Counsel naming Jack Walker has been filed in this matter\n\nconcurrently with this motion. As of the date of filing of this Motion for Continuance, the\n\nDefendant has only been in the case for approximately 52 days. Defendant is entitled to the\n\nopportunity to conduct discovery and, at a minimum obtain the deposition of the Plaintiff, J.\n\nBennett White with J. Bennett White, P.C. The Defendant would request that this court continue\n\nthe hearing on the summary judgment so as to allow the parties to engage in discovery. This\n\ncontinuance is not sought for delay but so that justice may be done.\n\n\n\n                                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n                                             The Arcadia Theater\n                                             121 N.

Background\n\n         White sued Reeder for breach of contract, alleging that Reeder hired White to perform\n\nattorney services, and failed to pay $212,597.07 in attorney fees.1 White also seeks an award of\n\n12% interest, costs of court, and $70,000 in attorney fees for this proceeding.\n\n         Reeder contests the fees represented to be charged by White, and contests that the fees\n\nwere reasonable and necessary for the work accomplished. Exhibit 1. Further, Reeder believes\n\nthat charges and fees charged by White and his office reflect actions taken by White that were\n\nnot in compliance with or in furtherance of the client’s particular instructions and strategies in\n\nthe case. Exhibit 1. Reeder cannot provide more specific explanation of White’s departures from\n\ninstruction until White actually provides the billing statements with description of legal services\n\nprovided and time spent. Exhibit 1.\n\n         The hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment is currently scheduled to take\n\nplace on August 25, 2015. Procedurally, a Motion for Summary Judgment is premature as\n\nDefendant has had virtually no opportunity to complete or even begin discovery. A timeline of\n\nthe proceeding in this case are as follows:\n\n         4/14/15             Plaintiff’s Original Petition filed.\n\n         6/1/15              Defendant Wendell Reeder’s Original Answer and General Denial filed.\n\n         6/11/15             Motion to Disqualify J. Keith Mayo and Mayo Mendolia & Vice, LLP as\n                             Attorney for Defendant Wendell Reeder filed.\n\n         6/19/15             Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment filed.\n\n         6/23/15             Order Granting Motion to Disqualify J. Keith Mayo and Mayo Mendolia\n                             & Vice, LLP as Attorney for Defendant Wendell Reeder filed.\n\n\n\n1 See Plaintiff’s Original Petition, on file.\n                                                                                                    2\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        0104\n\f           Defendant has recently retained additional counsel to represent him in this matter. A\n\nNotice of Appearance of Additional Counsel naming Jack Walker has been filed in this matter\n\nconcurrently with this motion. As of the date of filing of this Motion for Continuance, the\n\nDefendant has only been in the case for approximately 52 days. Defendant is entitled to the\n\nopportunity to conduct discovery and, at a minimum obtain the deposition of the Plaintiff, J.\n\nBennett White with J. Bennett White, P.C.\n\n                                         II. Table of Exhibits\n\n           Reeder attached the following exhibits which are incorporated by reference as if set forth\n\nin full:\n\nExhibit 1         Affidavit of Wendell Reeder.\n\nPlaintiff also relies upon and incorporates all pleadings on file.\n\n\n                                       III. Standard of Review\n\n           When a movant files a traditional motion for summary judgment based on the summary\n\njudgment evidence, the court can grant the motion only when the movant’s evidence, “as a\n\nmatter of law,” either conclusively establishes all the elements of the movant’s affirmative\n\ndefense or conclusively disproves the facts of at least one element of the nonmovant’s claim.\n\nM.D. Anderson Hosp. and Tumor Inst. v. Willrich, 28 S.W.3d 22, 23 (Tex. 2000); Park Place\n\nHosp. v. Estate of Milo, 909 S.W.2d 508, 511 (Tex. 1995). When evaluating a motion for\n\nsummary judgment based on summary judgment proof, the trial court must do the following:\n\n           (1) Assume all the nonmovant’s proof is true. Limestone Prods. Distrib. v.\n           McNamara, 71 S.W.3d 308, 311 (Tex. 2002); Nixon v. Mr. Prop. Mgmt. Co., 690\n           S.W.2d 546\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    3\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        0105\n\f       (2) Indulge every reasonable inference in favor of the nonmovant. Provident Life\n       & Acc. Ins. Co. v. Knott, 128 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex. 2003).\n\n       (3) Resolve all doubts about the existence of a genuine issue of a material fact\n       against the movant. M.D. Anderson Hosp. v. Willrich, 28 S.W.3d 22, 23 (2000).\n\n       The movant bears the burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists and\n\nthat it is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. American Tobacco Co. v. Grinnell,\n\n951 S.W.2d 420, 425 (Tex. 1997).\n\n       The nonmovant has no burden to respond to a summary judgment motion unless the\n\nmovant conclusively establishes its cause of action. Id. If the movant meets his burden, the\n\nburden then shifts to the non-movant to present competent summary judgment evidence creating\n\na genuine issue of material fact. Kaye v. Harris County Mun. Util. Dist. No. 9, 866 S.W.2d 791,\n\n793 (Tex. App. – Houston [14th Dist.] 1993, no writ) (citing McConnell v. Southside Indep. Sch,\n\nDist., 858 S.W. 2d 337, 341 (Tex. 1993)).\n\nWhat Constitutes a Material Fact Issue?\n\n       In deciding whether there is a material fact issue precluding summary judgment, evidence\n\nfavorable to the non-movant will be taken as true; every reasonable inference must be indulged\n\nin favor of the non-movant and any doubts resolved in its favor. Hughes Wood Products, Inc. v.\n\nWagner, 18 S.W.3d 202, 205, 43 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 595 (Tex. 2000). The evidentiary standard in\n\nreviewing a summary judgment is well-known to this court:\n\n       We must... view the evidence and its reasonable inferences in the light most\n       favorable to the nonmovant. Great American Reserve Ins. Co. v. San Antonio\n       Plumbing Supply Col, 391 S.W.2d 41, 47 (Tex. 1965). In deciding whether there\n       is a material fact issue precluding summary judgment, all conflicts in the evidence\n       will be disregarded and the evidence favorable to the nonmovant will be accepted\n       as true. Harwell v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 896 S.W.2d 170, 173 (Tex.\n       1995). Evidence that favors the movant’s position will not be considered\n       unless it is uncontroverted. Great American, 391 S.W.2d at 47.\n\n                                                                                                  4\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      0106\n\fDavis v. City of Palestine, 988 S.W.2d 854, 857 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1999, no pet.). Additionally,\n\n“Conflicting testimony of the same witness on the same issue creates a fact issue for the fact\n\nfinder to decide.” Washington v. Aetna Cas. & Surety Co., 521 S.W.2d 313, 316 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.—Fort Worth 1975, no writ), emphasis added; Maleski v. Tex. Emp. Ins. Ass’n., 471 S.W.2d\n\n416, 421 (Tex. Civ. App.—Corpus Christi 1971, no writ).\n\n                                 IV. Argument and Authorities\n\n       White sued Reeder for breach of contract, and has failed to establish his right to a\n\ntraditional summary judgment, “as a matter of law.”\n\n1. White failed to plead a Suit on Sworn Account, and thus is not entitled to avail himself of\nRule 185’s procedural advantages.\n\n       White’s claim is for breach of contract. White failed to plead breach of contract in a way\n\nthat meets Rule 185’s elements and thus is not allowed to harness a suit on sworn account’s\n\nprocedural benefits.\n\n       Rule 185 states that an open account includes, “any claim… for personal services\n\nrendered.” See Tex. R. Civ. P. 185; Panditi v. Apostle, 180 S.W.3d 924, 926 (Tex. App.---Dallas\n\n2006, no pet.). Rule 185 is not a rule of substantive law, but rather, a rule of procedure regarding\n\nthe evidence necessary to establish a prima facie right of recovery for certain types of contractual\n\nclaims. Id.\n\n       It is merely a rule of evidence which, if there is no proper denial, avoids the necessity of\n\nproving the correctness of the account. Long v. Miken Oil, Inc., 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 9189, at\n\n*29 (Tex. App.---Tyler 2014, no pet.). Proof of the contract or sale that gave rise to the account\n\nmust be made as alleged. Id. at 30.\n\n\n                                                                                                  5\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       0107\n\f          If a plaintiff’s pleading of a sworn account is defective or if the defendant files a proper\n\nsworn denial, the plaintiff must offer proof of the sworn account. Id. In a suit on sworn account,\n\nthe plaintiff must prove:\n\n          (1) there was a sale or delivery of the goods or services,\n\n          (2) the charges on the account are just, that is, the prices charged are in\n          accordance with an agreement or, in the absence of an agreement, are usual,\n          customary and reasonable, and\n\n          (3) the amount remains unpaid.\n\nId.\n\n          The account must show with reasonable certainty the name, date and charge for each\n\nitem, and provide specifics or details as to how the figures were arrived at. Panditi, 180 S.W.3d\n\nat 926.\n\n          A claim is liquidated for a suit on sworn account if the amount of damages may be\n\naccurately calculated by the trial court from the “factual, as opposed to the conclusory,”\n\nallegations in the plaintiffs’ petition and the instrument in writing. Id. When a plaintiff’s suit on\n\nsworn account is not based on a liquidated amount, the pleadings are neutralized and the plaintiff\n\nmust prove his case at common law. Id.\n\n          A systematic record must have been kept on all claims brought under the rule. Id. at 31. A\n\nsuit on sworn account must be accompanied by the affidavit of the plaintiff, his agent or his\n\nattorney, that (1) the claim is within the knowledge of the affiant, (2) that the claim is just and\n\ntrue, (3) the account is due, and (4) all just and lawful offsets, payments and credits have been\n\nallowed. Id. A defendant is not required to file a sworn denial if the plaintiff’s suit on a sworn\n\naccount is not properly pleaded. Id.\n\n\n                                                                                                    6\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         0108\n\fa. White failed to establish his prima facie case under Rule 185, and thus is not entitled to\nsuit on sworn account treatment.\n\n       White filed a petition wholly deficient of Rule 185’s requirements. Namely, the petition\n\nwas conclusory and:\n\n      Failed to attach an affidavit establishing facts under oath\n\n      Failed to contain facts establishing systematic record(s) of transaction(s)\n\n      Failed to contain facts establishing that the amount charged were usual, customary and\n       reasonable\n\n      Failed to contain facts establishing a contract between the parties\n\n      Failed to contain facts establishing the lawful payments, offsets and credits applied to the\n       account.\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 185; Andrews v. ETMC, 885 S.W.2d 264 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1994, no writ).\n\n       At a minimum, the sworn information in support of a Rule 185 suit on sworn account for\n\nattorney fees should have included statements that list the date and description of legal services\n\nprovided, the number of hours spent, etc., so that the defendant could have something more than\n\nmere conclusions to controvert. Panditi, 180 S.W.3d at 927.\n\n       In every way, White’s petition fails to establish its prima facie burden under Rule 185.\n\nb. Nonetheless, Reeder has filed a sworn denial, and White is put to his burden of proof.\n\n       Reeder is not required to file a sworn denial. “A defendant is not required to file a sworn\n\ndenial if the plaintiff’s suit on a sworn account was not properly pleaded.” Panditi, 180 S.W.3d\n\nat 926. As explained above, because White didn’t properly plead a sworn account, this is a\n\nbreach of contract action and nothing more.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  7\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      0109\n\f        The purpose is straightforward. Defendant cannot be expected to refute allegations that\n\nhaven’t been clearly and particularly alleged and sworn under oath in the first place.\n\n        Nonetheless, Reeder has filed a sworn denial, and White must establish his right to\n\nrecovery by common law. Where a defendant files a verified denial, he is permitted to dispute\n\nthe receipt of services and correctness of the charges. Panditi, 180 S.W.3d at 926.\n\n        Here, Reeder has alleged in his sworn denial that the fees were improper. Ashton Grove\n\nL.C. v. Jackson Walker L.L.P., 366 S.W.3d 790, 798 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.). Reeder\n\ncontests the fees represented to be charged by White, and contests that the fees were reasonable\n\nand necessary for the work accomplished. Exhibit 1. Further, Reeder believes that charges and\n\nfees charged by White and his office reflect actions taken by White that were not in compliance\n\nwith or in furtherance of the client’s particular instructions and strategies in the case. Exhibit 1.\n\nReeder cannot provide more specific explanation of White’s departures from instruction until\n\nWhite actually provides the billing statements with description of legal services provided and\n\ntime spent. Exhibit 1.\n\n3. White failed to satisfy Andersen Requirements.\n\n        An examination of the documents attached to White’s traditional motion for summary\n\njudgment reveals flimsy, conclusory information that cannot establish his claim as a matter of\n\nlaw. In order to prevail on his motion for summary judgment, White must establish his claim for\n\nbreach of contract, the link between breach of contract and damages, and his contract damages\n\nthemselves “as a matter of law,” which he cannot do. Ashton, 366 S.W.3d at 797-98.\n\n        As explained above, Reeder has alleged in his sworn denial that the fees were improper.\n\nId. at 798.\n\n\n                                                                                                   8\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        0110\n\f          The Andersen factors apply in determining the reasonableness of attorney fees, and these\n\nfactors include: (1) the time and labor required and difficulty of the issues involved; (2) the\n\nlikelihood that acceptance of the employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer; (3)\n\nthe fees customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; (4) the amount involved\n\nand results obtained; (5) the time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (6) the\n\nnature and length of the professional relationship with the client; (7) the experience, reputation,\n\nand ability of the lawyer performing the services; and (8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent\n\non the result obtained. Ashton, 366 S.W.3d at 799.\n\n          In support of his motion, White attaches an affidavit with exhibits. The affidavit fails to\n\nset forward any evidence regarding factors such as fees customarily charged for similar\n\ncircumstances, or the experience or reputation of the lawyers involved.\n\n          White attaches documents he refers to as a “summary of account activity,” containing\n\nconclusory information for seven matters, labeled as Exhibits 4-10. The financial records\n\nattached fail to set forward any information regarding the actual hours worked on a particular\n\nday on a given file, or a description of legal services provided during that time spent. They are\n\nlittle more than meaningless numbers, which, in a vacuum, cannot establish a claim as a matter\n\nof law.\n\n4. Continuance of summary judgment hearing is appropriate.\n\n          As explained in the companion motion, a continuance of any summary judgment hearing\n\nis appropriate. As of the date of filing of the Motion for Continuance, the Defendant has only\n\nbeen in the case for approximately 52 days. Defendant is entitled to the opportunity to conduct\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   9\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        0111\n\fdiscovery and, at a minimum obtain the deposition of the Plaintiff, J. Bennett White with J.\n\nBennett White, P.C.\n\n       The motion for continuance is adopted and incorporated as if set forth fully. And this\n\nresponse is subject to the motion for continuance.\n\n                                         V. Conclusion\n\n       Accordingly, this Court should deny White’s motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n\n                                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n                                             The Arcadia Theater\n                                             121 N.

General Denial\n\n        Defendant generally denies the allegations in plaintiffs original petition.\n\n      II. Objection to Consideration as Suit ou Sworn Account, and Special Exceptions\n\n        Defendant objects and specially excepts to plaintiffs petition because the claims are not\n\nproperly brought as a suit on a sworn account. This is a suit for breach of contract arising from\n\nan attorney client relationship.\n\n        White failed to plead breach of contract in a way that meets Rule 185' s elements and thus\n\nis not allowed to harness a suit on sworn account's procedural benefits. His pleadings are\n\ndefective because they fail to establish by affidavit under oath any of the following:\n\n        (!)there was a sale or delivery of the goods or services,\n\n        (2) the charges on the account are just, that is, the prices charged are in\n        accordance with an agreement or, in the absence of an agreement, are usual,\n        customary and reasonable, and\n\n        (3) the amount remains unpaid.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         0117\n\f        (4) systematic records of transactions, such as the name, date and charge for each\n        item, and provide specifics or details as to how the figures were anived at.\n\n        (5) Failed to contain facts establishing the lawful payments, offsets and credits\n        applied to the account.\n\n        Defendant further objects and specially excepts to the conclusory nature of plaintiffs\n\nallegations. The usual and customary practice for attorneys is to make separate time entries\n\ndetailing the date of service provided, amount of time spent, and description of legal service\n\nprovided. Here, the amounts listed are nothing more than conclusions. When a plaintiffs suit on\n\nsworn account is not based on a liquidated amount, the pleadings are neutralized and the plaintiff\n\nmust prove his case at common law. Conclusory totals do not satisfy the record keeping\n\nrequirement of Rule 185.\n\n       A defendant is not required to file a sworn denial if the plaintiffs suit on a sworn account\n\nis not properly pleaded.\n\n                                         III. Verified Pleas\n\n       Defendant denies the account on which plaintiff files suit because not each and every\n\nitem of the account made the basis of plaintiffs suit is just or true. Defendant has filed an\n\naffidavit in support of this answer, and incorporates same as if set forth fully.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      0118\n\f                                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                             MARTIN\n                                             WALKER.r.c.\n                                             The Arcadia Theater\n                                             121 N.

I just have this down as a motions hearing.\n\n 4   What are we dealing with?\n\n 5                   MR. WHITE:    Your Honor, my law firm filed\n\n 6   a lawsuit against Mr. Reeder for collection of fees.\n\n 7   Mr. Mayo's firm has been hired to represent Mr. Reeder.\n\n 8   One of my formal legal assistants has gone to work for\n\n 9   Mr. Mayo.   Since she both has prior confidences being\n\n10   both employed by my firm and my client, we've moved to\n\n11   disqualify Mr. Mayo, so we're here on our motion to\n\n12   disqualify.\n\n13                   MR. MAYO:    Your Honor, we filed a\n\n14   response, and in the response, we believe that we have\n\n15   met the criteria for isolating this particular\n\n16   nonlawyer/paralegal in the manner prescribed by the law.\n\n17   In the Phoenix Founders case, the Court's very clear\n\n18   with regard to what needs to be done by the law firm\n\n19   hiring the incoming paralegal.\n\n20                   The Court discusses the fact that there\n\n21   doesn't need to be a chilling effect on the hiring of\n\n22   paralegals simply because of the fact a paralegal has\n\n23   worked in another law office prior to coming to this law\n\n24   office, and they've set out the difference between\n\n25   paralegals and lawyers.\n\f                                                                   5\n\n\n\n 1                  Your Honor, I would direct you to Page --\n\n 2   in the Phoenix case, Page 4, beginning on Page 4 in the\n\n 3   second column, and it's really the first full paragraph\n\n 4   beginning with, \"Underlying...\"   It talks about the\n\n 5   criteria that's looked at by the Supreme Court.      And as\n\n 6   long as my firm can satisfy the burden -- well, it's the\n\n 7   Movant's burden to prove that there is a basis for\n\n 8   disqualification, but my response to that, in responding\n\n 9   to that, I simply have to show that there's a screening\n\n10   done with the employee, which there was -- I've included\n\n11   in my affidavit attached to my response -- that there\n\n12   have been measures taken within the office to isolate\n\n13   the employee from these files, which there has been.\n\n14   We've removed the files and segregated those particular\n\n15   files in another office from hers.    She has also\n\n16   instructed, as has our staff and other paralegals, not\n\n17   to discuss this case within the office with this\n\n18   paralegal.\n\n19                  Ms. Smith is very capable paralegal, a\n\n20   single mother, and needs the job.    The Court, not\n\n21   wanting to impose a chilling effect in the hiring of\n\n22   capable legal professionals as long as these criteria\n\n23   been met and we have met this criteria and we believe\n\n24   there's no basis for disqualification, Your Honor.\n\n25                  THE COURT:   Thank you.\n\f                                                                  6\n\n\n\n 1                   Mr. White.\n\n 2                   MR. WHITE:   Thank you, Your Honor.   May\n\n 3   approach, Your Honor?\n\n 4                   THE COURT:   Yes.\n\n 5                   MR. WHITE:   I've printed off this.   It's\n\n 6   the same court opinion that Mr. Mayo provided, although\n\n 7   I did highlight three paragraphs that are a little bit\n\n 8   different place where Mr. Mayo called the Court's\n\n 9   attention to.\n\n10                   Essentially, where the opinion goes to\n\n11   Page 836, the Supreme Court sets forth the criteria\n\n12   that's to be looked at.   And essentially, what this case\n\n13   does is it draws a distinction between the lawyer and\n\n14   the legal assistant whereas the lawyer is presumed,\n\n15   conclusively presumed to share whatever confidences they\n\n16   have to other people in the firm.\n\n17                   The Court Supreme has said that if we want\n\n18   to indulge that conclusive presumption as to a legal\n\n19   assistant, but it says it is inevitable that we should\n\n20   presume some sharing.   On the left-hand column there, it\n\n21   talks about the court will presume some sharing in a\n\n22   case of a legal assistant, but that can be rebutted,\n\n23   which that's the fact that it has to be rebutted by the\n\n24   firm seeking to be -- or the firm -- this -- the target\n\n25   of the disqualification, it would be their burden to\n\f                                                                7\n\n\n\n 1   prove there are adequate safeguards in place, but when\n\n 2   you go over to the next column, you go over the factors\n\n 3   and the circumstances that exist here.\n\n 4                   The first factor is the substantiality of\n\n 5   the relationship between the former and the current\n\n 6   matters.   Well, Your Honor, when Ms. Smith was working\n\n 7   for my firm, there is some portion of the work that's\n\n 8   been sued on here today in this lawsuit that was work\n\n 9   that she provided, so she's a fact witness about work\n\n10   she did that is reflected in the billing.\n\n11                   She worked for my firm which is both the\n\n12   Plaintiff and plaintiff's counsel, so she got\n\n13   confidences of both the employee of the party as well as\n\n14   an employee of the party's attorney.   Well, the matter\n\n15   we are here today is the very same matter that she\n\n16   helped work on right before she left which was\n\n17   accounting for Mr. Reeder's time, reconciling the\n\n18   billing, making sure the amount we were claiming against\n\n19   him was correctly calculated, and so she's got direct\n\n20   involvement in the matter while she worked for my firm,\n\n21   and this is the same exact matter that Mr. Mayo is\n\n22   representing Mr. Reeder on.\n\n23                   The next factor the Supreme Court talks\n\n24   about is the time elapsing between the matters.   This\n\n25   isn't where she did work for me years ago on something\n\f                                                                 8\n\n\n\n 1   that's remote in time from what we're on here today.\n\n 2   This is all bang, bang; March-April of this year.\n\n 3   There's no gap in-between the two.\n\n 4                    The next factor the Supreme Court talks\n\n 5   about is the size of the law firm.    In that case, they\n\n 6   made not that the legal assistant involved was going to\n\n 7   work at Thompson & Knight.    There was the ability to put\n\n 8   her in different departments in different floors.    The\n\n 9   firm was large enough it was easy to lose her among the\n\n10   bodies so there was not much chance that her information\n\n11   would be drawn upon accidentally or improperly.\n\n12   Mr. Mayo's office is a small office.    My office is a\n\n13   small office.    This factor does not weigh in favor of\n\n14   denying our motion.\n\n15                    The next factor says the number of persons\n\n16   presumed to have confidential information.    Mr. Mayo in\n\n17   his responses has indicated he's got three for four\n\n18   employees in his office.    If there's anybody that's\n\n19   presumed to have shared confidences, it would be a\n\n20   substantial percentage of that office.    It's not in this\n\n21   case where the paralegal had shared information with\n\n22   maybe her supervising attorney who had nothing to do\n\n23   with the ongoing matters that were the subject of this\n\n24   qualification.\n\n25                    The next factor is the nature involvement\n\f                                                                9\n\n\n\n 1   in the former matter.    Well, the former matter is the\n\n 2   same matter that we're -- that has resulted in this\n\n 3   case.   She was completely involved in that.\n\n 4                    The next factor is the timing and features\n\n 5   of measures to reduce the dangers of disclosure.\n\n 6   Mr. Mayo has indicated what he believes those to be, and\n\n 7   the Supreme Court goes on to say a little further, the\n\n 8   last part I've highlighted there, the fact that the\n\n 9   present case involves representation of adverse parties\n\n10   in the same proceeding rather than two separate\n\n11   proceedings increases the danger that some improper\n\n12   disclosure may have occurred.    We're here in exactly\n\n13   that scenario.\n\n14                    So to the extent the Supreme Court lowered\n\n15   the boundary or -- or the raised the burden for\n\n16   disqualification to some extent, the manner in which\n\n17   they've raised it simply does not apply to the facts\n\n18   that we have here, and not only that, but this speaks\n\n19   solely to the person being affected as having been an\n\n20   employee of the law firm, not as having been employed by\n\n21   the client.\n\n22                    I mean, we can just imagine in a personal\n\n23   injury case, if a former employee of the defendant goes\n\n24   to work for the plaintiff's law firm.    That -- that\n\n25   would hardly be appropriate.    And Mr. Mayo talks about\n\f                                                                10\n\n\n\n 1   her ability to get a job, he can hire whoever he wants o\n\n 2   hire.   We're not saying he cannot hire her.   It's just\n\n 3   that he has to chose between hiring her and keeping this\n\n 4   case.   He doesn't have to fire her.   He can be\n\n 5   disqualified which would allow her to keep her job which\n\n 6   would protect her from being exposed.\n\n 7                    But the problem we have right now, Your\n\n 8   Honor, she is a fact witness.    She has knowledge that\n\n 9   bears upon the legitimacy of our claim against Mr.\n\n10   Mayo's client.    Mr. Mayo is obligated to zealously\n\n11   defend his client and there's no way for him to\n\n12   zealously defend his client if he's taking a hands-off\n\n13   approach with a fact witness because she happens to work\n\n14   for him.\n\n15                    If she has to testify, she's going to be\n\n16   extremely torn between the truthfulness of the work that\n\n17   she did as reflected in our claim and the loyalty she\n\n18   feels to Mr. Mayo by being employed by him and the\n\n19   loyalty she'll feel for her client as her client, and so\n\n20   that's unfair to do.\n\n21                    If Mr. Reeder has got legitimate defenses,\n\n22   there are plenty other lawyers that can take this case.\n\n23   There's no necessity to keep Mr. Mayo, but under these\n\n24   circumstances and under the facts that exists here,\n\n25   disqualification would be appropriate, and we ask the\n\f                                                                11\n\n\n\n 1   Court to grant our motion and disqualify Mr. Mayo and\n\n 2   his firm.\n\n 3                  THE COURT:    Any further response?\n\n 4                  MR. MAYO:    Just briefly, Your Honor.    The\n\n 5   Phoenix case deals specifically with -- and the Supreme\n\n 6   Court is dealing specifically with what Mr. White has\n\n 7   urged in his motion.    In the Phoenix case, the Supreme\n\n 8   Court says we're lowing the standard because we do not\n\n 9   want to have that effect from hiring capable paralegals\n\n10   simply because they've worked on a case in another firm.\n\n11                  The size of the firm is a criteria.\n\n12   However, in this particular case, to disqualify our firm\n\n13   would be to presume that we haven't given all of these\n\n14   warnings, which I've sworn to an affidavit and attached\n\n15   to my response that we did, and we haven't taken these\n\n16   precautions in my office to isolate Ms. Smith from any\n\n17   exposure to the file.\n\n18                  THE COURT:    Yes, sir.\n\n19                  Let me just say that the Court works on\n\n20   the assumption that everything in the affidavit is\n\n21   correct --\n\n22                  MR. MAYO:    Yes, sir.\n\n23                  THE COURT:    -- and you've taken all those\n\n24   steps and is acting in good faith.      I think Mr. White is\n\n25   correct in what he's saying for the reason that this\n\f                                                                 12\n\n\n\n 1   is -- well, especially for the reason that this is a\n\n 2   case where's it's not representing -- in other words,\n\n 3   this has to do with the law firm itself as visa-vis\n\n 4   Mr. Reeder as opposed to Mr. White.    In other words, I\n\n 5   think it gets too directly into the fact especially she\n\n 6   might be called -- potentially be called as a witness,\n\n 7   and I know she may not necessarily be called as a\n\n 8   witness, but where she could be, this really puts this\n\n 9   in a much more difficult situation that it would be\n\n10   otherwise.\n\n11                  I'm going to -- well, what is our\n\n12   timetable?\n\n13                  MR. MAYO:    It's just begun.   He filed a\n\n14   motion for summary judgement, but other than that, the\n\n15   case has just been filed.\n\n16                  THE COURT:    The summary judgement is\n\n17   going to be heard when?\n\n18                  MR. WHITE:    I don't think we have a\n\n19   setting.\n\n20                  THE COURT:    I'm going to find that,\n\n21   Mr. Mayo, that your firm needs to either withdraw within\n\n22   30 days -- in other words, if the matter isn't resolved\n\n23   some other way within 30 days, that your firm would need\n\n24   to withdraw.\n\n25                  MR. WHITE:    Your Honor, is that a final\n\f                                                                  13\n\n\n\n 1   order?    I presume the Court understands why because I\n\n 2   understand Mr. Reeder is going to ask me to have this\n\n 3   decision reviewed, I feel confident.\n\n 4                    THE COURT:    And, you know, I know\n\n 5   mandamus isn't used as much as it used to be, but if\n\n 6   it's available, why certainly, that's you need to take\n\n 7   advantage of if you feel like that's what needs to be\n\n 8   done.    So I guess let me make that -- just put it on the\n\n 9   basis of the fact changing that to where I'm saying that\n\n10   I find there is a conflict and that --\n\n11                    MR. MAYO:    Even though it's the same\n\n12   client?    That's okay.\n\n13                    THE COURT:    Yes, sir.   And that -- and so\n\n14   you've got something real clear to deal with.\n\n15                    If you'll reduce that to a properly\n\n16   written form, and if counsel signs off it approving as\n\n17   to form, I'll sign it when I get it.\n\n18                    MR. WHITE:    I will prepare the proposed\n\n19   order.\n\n20                    THE COURT:    Yes, sir.\n\n21                    (End of proceedings.)\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\f                                                              14\n\n\n\n 1                    REPORTER'S CERTIFICATE\n\n 2   THE STATE OF TEXAS          )\n     COUNTY OF WOOD         )\n 3\n\n 4        I, Una B.

In July, 2012, Defendant Reeder hired Plaintiff to appeal the judgment granted in\n\n the Jamestown Insurance declaratory judgment proceeding.\n\n                  15.         From July, 2012 and continuing through and including April, 2013, Plaintiff, at\n\nthe special instance and request of Reeder, provided services as requested by Reeder.                        In\n\nconnection therewith, Reeder promised to pay Plaintiff on an hourly basis for legal services\n\nprovided at Plaintiffs regular hourly rates. As of March 20, 2015, after allowing all just and\n\nlawful offsets and payments and credits, Reeder is indebted to Plaintiff in the sum of $30,023.85\n\nfor legal services provided in the appeal of the Jamestown Insurance declaratory judgment\n\nproceeding.\n\n                                                      Cause of Action No. 7(General)\n\n                  16.        In June, 2008, Defendant Reeder hired Plaintiff provided legal representation in\n\nmatters of a general nature.\n\n                  17.        From June, 2008 and continuing through and including April, 2015, Plaintiff, at\n\nthe special instance and request of Reeder, provided services as requested by Reeder.                        In\n\nconnection therewith, Reeder promised to pay Plaintiff on an hourly basis for legal services\n\nprovided at Plaintiffs regular hourly rates. As of March 20. 2015, after allowing all just and\n\nlawful offsets and payments and credits, Reeder is indebted to Plaintiff in the sum of $5,055.01\n\nfor legal services provided in general matters.\n\n                                                       Allegations As to All Claims\n\n                 18.         Beginning in approximately July, 2009, Reeder specifically requested Plaintiff to\n\npostpone collection of the balances on the accounts brought by this petition.

The Supreme Court reversed the Wood County\n\n Judgment in approximately April, 2013.\n\n             19.        At that time, Reeder asked Plaintiff to continue deferring collection until the\n\njudgment liens pertaining to the Wood County Judgment had been removed. That task was\n\n completed in approximately November, 2014.\n\n            20.         Once the judgment liens were released, Plaintiff sought payment from Defendant.\n\n Reeder promised Plaintiff that he would have the funds to pay Plaintiff from a real estate closing\n\n originally scheduled for December, 2014. After numerous delays, that closing finally occurred\n\n in March, 2015. However, rather than paying Plaintiff as agreed, Defendant now refuses to pay\n\nPlaintiff the just and true balance owed.\n\n                                                   Rule 47 (c)\n\n            21.         All conditions precedent to the recovery sought by Plaintiff have been perfom1ed\n\nor have occurred. The damages Plaintiff seeks are within the jurisdictional limits of this court.\n\nIn accordance with TEX. R.

Plaintiff has made written demand upon the Defendant for payment of the\n\nbalances owed for legal services provided, and Plaintiff would show the Court that the recovery\n\nof attorneys' fees is authorized, made, and provided, under and according to Chapter 38 of the\n\nTexas Civil Practice & Remedies Code, and Plaintiff further sues Defendant for reasonable\n\nattorneys' fees, which Plaintiff alleges to be in at least the sum of $70,000.00.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff\"s Original Petit/On\nJ.

Keith Mayo and Mayo Mendolia & Vice, L.L.P as attorneys for Defendant,\n\n          Wendell Reeder (\"Reeder\"), and would show to the Court as follows:\n\n                       Summary ofMotion: Defendant's law firm should be disqualified\n                 because it now employs a legal assistant previously employed by Plaintiff.\n\n                 1.      Jennifer Smith (\"Smith\") is currently employed as a legal assistant by Mayo\n\n          Mendolia & Vice, L.L.P (\"Ml'vIV\"). She was previously employed by J. Bennett White, P.C. in\n\n          that same capacity. During the time Smith was employed by JEW, PC, she was privy to JEW,\n\n          PC's privileged and confidential information.         With this being a lawsuit for collection of\n\n          attorneys' fees owed, Smith's employment with MMV subjects her to competing loyalties in\n\n          honoring the client confidences gained while working at JEW, PC against her cun-ent obligation\n\n          of loyalty to M1v1V and its clients. MMV's representation of Reeder jeopardizes Smith's ability\n\n          to honor Plaintiff's confidences.\n\n                 2.

Prior to that time I had\n                 done work for Clarksville Oil and Gas, a company operated by Mr. Reeder, but I\n                 had not done any significant work for him, individually. During that meeting, he\n                 told me about having recently lost a trial in which he was sued in Wood County,\n                 Texas. As a result of the recent trial, Mr. Reeder had a judgment entered against\n                 him in excess of one million dollars. During that meeting, he inquired whether\n                 appealing the judgment was something that my office could do. I indicated that\n                 we could, that I had extensive experience in appellate matters, and that I was\n                 willing to investigate the prospects for a successful appeal. In June, 2008, J.\n                 Bennett \\Vhite, P.C. internally created Matter Number 08-1082 (the \"Fry\n                 Appeal\") and began charging services to that matter in conjunction with\n                 appealing the Wood County judgment against l\\!Ir.

He would occasionally remit some payment as the exhibits\n                     demonstrate; however, he consistently indicated that he would pay the full\n                     amount once the Fry Appeal was completed. Mr. Reeder explained to me that he\n                     had substantial real estate holdings to which the land title was encumbered by the\n                     judgment lien that had been filed by the judgment creditors on the Wood County\n                     Judgment. Mr. Reeder indicated that his boffowing power to provide capital for\n                     Clarksville Oil and Gas had been severely undennined by the judgment lien, and\n                     that it had left his business operations with far less capital than he had become\n                     accustomed to having available to operate. Mr. Reeder assured me that once the\n                     appeals were concluded and the judgment liens were removed from his real\n                     estate, he would have the ability to bon-ow the funds needed to pay the unpaid\n                     balances in full.

The final lien releases were provided to Mr. Reeder\n                    in either October or November of 2014. At that time, l'vir. Reeder assured me\n                    that he had a real estate closing scheduled for December, 2014 that would allow\n                    the unpaid balances to be paid, in full. On December 3, 2014, I wrote l'vir.\n                    Reeder a letter to summarize the balances owed on these various matters. A hue\n                    and cotTect copy of that letter is attached hereto as Exhibit 11.\n\n                             \"The real estate closing was postponed and rescheduled over a period of\n                    several months; however, both Mr. Reeder and his agent Barbara Watts kept J.\n                    Bennett White, P.C. informed on the progress and status of the closing either by\n                    phone or by email. At some time prior to the closing, it was explained to me that\n                    the closing on which J. Bennett White, P.C. was awaiting payment was not a\n                    transaction in which J\\1Ir. Reeder was going to be bon-owing money as I had been\n                    promised. Instead, he had previously sold a convenience store on a contract for\n                    deed, and the buyer was refinancing, leaving Mr. Reeder with the funds needed\n                    to retire the balances owed to J. Bennett White, P.C. I was initially assured that\n                    the closing was scheduled for January 23, 2015. A hue and correct copy of the\n                    January 20, 2015 email from Barbara Watts infonning of the date of closing is\n                    attached hereto as Exhibit 12. On January 23, 2015, I was informed by Barbara\n                    Watts by email that the buyer elected not to proceed with the closing. A true and\n                    con-ect copy of the January 23rd email is attached hereto as Exhibit 13. At that\n                    time, I insisted that Mr. Reeder honor this prior commitment to me. Mr. Reeder\n                    indicated that there was a chance the buyer would complete that transaction. I\n                    again agreed to await payment until that transaction could be consummated. Mr.\n                    Reeder continued to keep me infonned on the status of the closing. I had\n                    approximately 13 phone conversations with Mr. Reeder regarding the status of\n                    the closing from January, 2015 until the end of March, 2015. Further on\n                    February 27, 2015, Mr. Reeder sent a letter included with a pattial payment in\n                    which he expressed his hopefulness that the balance owed would soon be paid.\n                    A copy of the letter sent by Mr. Reeder is attached hereto as Exhibit 14. The\n                    closing finally occurred in March, 2015. Once that transaction was completed, I\n                    expected Mr. Reeder to make payment in full. On Jv1arch 23, 2015, Mr. Reeder\n                    called and asked to come to my office to settle up his account balances.\n\n                            \"When Mr. Reeder atTived, he met with my legal assistant Tw-yla Fields\n                    and me. In that meeting, he expressed some concerns about certain billing items\n                    and indicated that he did not want to have to pay the full balance. In an effort to\n                    get the bill reduced, Mr. Reeder raised several complaints. First, he expressed\n                    concern about what he thought were duplicate time entries in consecutive months\n                    on the Fry Appeal matter. Specifically, he thought that he was charged for the\n                    same work done in two consecutive months, May, 2009 and June, 2009. I pulled\n                    copies of those invoices and noticed multiple entries for reviewing the clerk's\n                    record and the reporter's record.

I reminded Mr.\n                     Reeder that since my firm had not been involved in the trial in Wood County, the\n                     entire transcript had to be read in order to prepare the statement of facts po1tion\n                     of the appellant brief I also reminded Mr. Reeder that the trial had been lengthy\n                     with a large number of exhibits -- which all had to be reviewed as well. I assured\n                     him that anyone handling an appeal of that judgment would have had to do all\n                     the same work and would have charged him for that time, just as we had.\n\n                             \"Mr. Reeder then faulted the result from the initial appeal and stated that\n                     the only work that accomplished anything was the work that was done at the\n                     Texas Supreme Court. He did concede that the results there were positive, but he\n                     attributed that work to the lawyers at Locke Lord Bissell & Liddell, LLP, which\n                     served as lead attorneys during the Supreme Comt appeal.\n\n                             \"However, Mr. Reeder also agreed with me that the Supreme Comt\n                     ultimately vindicated the position we had taken with the Comt of Appeals. I\n                     con-ected Nlr. Reeder's belief that Locke Lord handled the entire proceeding\n                     before the Supreme Comt. I pulled up a copy of the original petition for review\n                     filed with the Supreme Court and showed to him that the only attorneys on that\n                     petition were those attorneys associated with J. Bennett White, P.C. I reminded\n                     him that Locke Lord was not willing to be hired unless the Supreme Court either\n                     granted the petition or requested briefing on the merits. The Supreme Court\n                     eventually granted the petition and Locke Lord then made its appearance for\n                     purposes of drafting the principal brief and participating in oral argument;\n                     however, the initial petition for review was drafted and filed by J.

In making this point, Mr.\n                     Reeder chose to aggregate the payments he had made with all the payments\n                     made by Clarksville Oil & Gas and its affiliated companies. I reminded him that\n                     nonpayment for work performed was not our deal. I did not dispute that\n                     Clarksville Oil and Gas had paid J. Bennett White, P.C. a substantial amount of\n                     money, but I assured him that all money \\Vas paid in exchange for services that\n                     were already provided to Clarksville Oil and Gas.

I\n                     told him that my office would reconcile the account balances with his records\n                     and would coordinate with his staff to get that done.\n\n                            \"Over the next week, my office spent approximately 26 hours\n                     reconstmcting all the billing records and reconciling the allocation of payments\n                     between the way that the payments were applied by J.

During a portion of the time that Plaintiff represented Mr.\n\nReeder, a legal assistant named Jennifer Smith worked for Plaintiff.\n\n        On April 14, 2015, Mr. Reeder retained the undersigned counsel to represent him\n\nindividually, as well as in a number of other business and litigation related matters. The majority\n\nof these matters were previously handled by Plaintiffs firm. On the same day as the undersigned\n\ncounsel was retained by Mr. Reeder, Plaintiff filed this suit suing Mr. Reeder for alleged unpaid legal\n\nfees.\n\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT WENDELL REED ER'S RESPONSE\nAND BRIEF IN SUPPORT TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY                                       PAGEl\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          0082\n\f        Prior to being retained by Mr. Reeder, the undersigned counsel was contacted by Ms. Smith\n\nwho inquired about a position with the undersigned's law office. 1 Ms. Smith was re-hired by Mayo\n\nMendolia & Vice, LLP on April 16, 2015.\n\n        Prior to the retention of Mr. Reeder as a client, there were other cases in which both the law\n\noffice of Mayo Mendolia & Vice, LLP and Plaintiff were involved. Therefore, when Ms. Smith was\n\nre-hired by Mayo Mendolia & Vice, LLP, the undersigned counsel had already contemplated the\n\nsegregation of Ms. Smith from these files as a matter of precaution. At the time of Ms. Smith's re-\n\nhire, all cases in which Mayo Mendolia & Vice, LLP were involved in any capacity with Plaintiffs\n\noffice were disclosed to Ms. Smith. Instruction was issued by the undersigned counsel to Ms. Smith\n\nand all firm personnel that Ms. Smith was to field no calls associated with these files, was not to\n\naccess these files via the firm server or by viewing the hard files, and was not to discuss these files,\n\neven in casual conversation, with any firm employee or partner until further notice from the\n\nundersigned counsel. All of these files were assigned to another legal assistant in the office and the\n\nhard files were placed in a segregated office from Ms. Smith's office.\n\n       Since the commencement of Ms. Smith's employment with this office, the utmost care has\n\nbeen taken to segregate Ms. Smith from any file in which she may have had prior involvement. To\n\ndate, Ms. Smith has remained completely isolated from any file where representation, at some point,\n\nmay have been by Plaintiffs office. This statement is particularly true in relation to the files,\n\nincluding this one, associated with Mr. Reeder.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      Ms. Smith had previously worked for Mayo Mendolia & Vice, LLP, and formerly for\nMayo Mendolia & Stan-, LLP, from 2008 until March 2012.\n\nDEFENDANT WENDELL REEDER'S RESPONSE\nAND BRIEF IN SUPPORT TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY                                        PAGE2\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           0083\n\f                                 Evidence in Support of Response\n\n1.      Affidavit of J. Keith Mayo- attached hereto as Exhibit \"A\" and incorporated herein by\n\n        reference.\n\n                                                   11.\n                                     Argument and Authorities\n\n        The Texas Rules of Professional Conduct were made and incorporated so that attorneys in\n\nthe state of Texas would not act unprofessionally and unethically when representing the interests of\n\ntheir clients or in any situation where a lack of ethics will have negative effects on an involved party.\n\nThis is not one of those cases. Ms. Smith has not done any work on the Bennett v.

Since the Defendant's attorney properly screened Ms. Smith and\n\nmade sure she did not divulge any information concerning this action, the Court should not grant the\n\nPlaintiffs motion to disqualify and allow the Defendant' s attorney to participate in this trial.\n\nI.     Ms. Smith was properly screened about the matter before any\n       work was done on the case.\n\n       In America, federal antitrust laws give prospective employees the right to solicit their own\n\nemployment and choose from any job offer that is presented to them.

Disqualifying the Defendant's Attorney simply because he hired\n\nan employee, an employee with a sterling reputation in the legal industry, would not only be a\n\nmiscarriage of justice, but would violate Section II of the Sherman Antitrust Act. It is not\n\nunreasonable to believe that attorneys in the Tyler, Texas area, where Ms. Smith lives, would be\n\nregular opponents in Court so this disqualification effectively bars Ms. Smith from working as a\n\nparalegal anywhere in the area she lives.

The Texas Supreme Court agrees. Because a potential\n\nemployer would be less inclined to hire paralegals due to the threat of disqualification, the Court held\n\nthat any restrictions on the non-lawyer should be held to the minimum necessary to protect\n\nconfidentiality.

In this case, the Defendant's attorney instructed Ms. Smith not to disclose any\n\ninformation or to work on any matter that she worked on as a member of the Plaintiffs firm. Not\n\nonly has Ms. Smith not disclosed any information, but she hasn't been anywhere near any of the\n\nwork done on aforementioned matters.\n\n       The Court also calls for \"other reasonable steps\" to be made to ensure that no information\n\nis leaked. Id. When this case was brought to the Defendant's attorney's firm, Ms. Smith was\n\ncompletely segregated from all the work. The files were made unavailable for her access. The\n\nphysical files were moved to a segregated ofiice and Ms. Smith was again instructed not to access\n\nthose files. Furthermore, staff was instructed to isolate Ms. Smith from any phone calls related to\n\nthese cases and this case in particular.\n\n       The distinct possibility of Ms. Smith using this information is not enough to disqualify the\n\nDefendant's attorney. The Defendant's attorney took the necessary steps to ensure that Ms. Smith\n\nwould not divulge any information at all concerning her work on these files while employed by\n\nPlaintiff. Defendant should be allowed to participate in this case and vigorously defend his client.\n\nOur State's highest court made this ruling because it did not want to create a chilling effect on the\n\nDEFENDANT WENDELL REEDER'S RESPONSE\nAND BRIEF IN SUPPORT TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY                                        PAGE4\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           0085\n\femployment of capable paralegals when the risk of divulging confidential or competing information\n\nhas been duly controlled by measured steps.\n\nII.    Ms. Smith does not present a genuine threat of disclosure of the information.\n\n\n       The Texas Rules of Professional Conduct do not allow a lawyer who has previously\n\nrepresented a client to use information that would create a disadvantage for the former client. Tex.\n\nR. Prof. Conduct l .09(a)(3). These same rules apply to legal assistants and clerks under direct\n\nsupervision of partners in law firms as well. Texas. R. Prof. Conduct 5.03(b)(l). In Texas, the\n\nburden of proof is on the movant to disqualify opposing council by establishing, by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence, that the matter in question is substantially related to matters previously worked on\n\nby the attorney or legal assistant, that there is a genuine threat of disclosure, and [the movant] must\n\nhave factual evidence to support this.

Neither\n\nparty disputes the fact that Ms. Smith worked directly on this case. In fact, Ms. Smith was one of\n\nthree legal assistants employed by the Plaintiff with access to confidential information about this\n\ncase. Ms. Smith has taken on a full caseload at the Defendant's attorney's firm and has been\n\noccupied with other, unrelated work since taking the job. The Defendant's attorney has two [other]\n\nlegal assistants and a clerk working on the matter at hand and they have been instructed not to speak\n\nabout the matter to Ms. Smith. Ms. Smith has been otherwise occupied the entire time she has been\n\nemployed by the Defendant's attorney and has not assisted any employee or member of the firm in\n\nhandling this case, thus she is not a legitimate threat to divulge information.\n\n       Unless opposing council can submit evidence that proves Ms. Smith is a threat to divulge\n\nconfidential information, it is not proper for the Defendant' s Attorney to excuse himself from\n\n\nDEFENDANT WENDELL REEDER'S RESPONSE\nAND BRIEF IN SUPPORT TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY                                       PAGES\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          0086\n\fworking on this case.

As a dedicated employee, Ms. Smith\n\nunderstands the importance of a client's right to privilege and that leaking any information related\n\nto this matter would be unethical. Despite her vigorous screening and all the extreme measures taken\n\nto create a Chinese Wall, if Ms. Smith were to leak information, the Defendant's attorney would\n\nhave no choice but to disqualify himself. id\n\n       Ms. Smith was specifically told not to work the case and or look over the files. She did not\n\nsay a word about the case to anyone at the firm. When the Defondant's attorney screened Ms. Smith,\n\nhe became aware of her knowledge of this case and took the proper steps to make sure she would\n\nnot volunteer any confidential information. Despite the fact that she has complete knowledge of the\n\ncase, Ms. Smith has not broken privileged with her former employer.

None of the actions taken by Mayo, Mendolia & Vice, LLP\n\nviolate the Texas Rules of Professional Conduct with respect to conflicts of interest. Disqualifying\n\nthe Defendant's attorney would not only severely inhibit the Defendant's case, but would violate\n\nfederal antitrust laws and keep Ms. Smith from effecti vcly providing for her family because no firms\n\nin the Tyler, Texas area who have any working relationship wiLh the Plaintiff would hire her. Ms.\n\nSmith was told not to work on the case and has not worked on the case. Since none of Ms. Smith's\n\nactions while working for the Defendant's attorney endangers the Plaintiffs right to confidence, the\n\nDefendant therefore requests that the Court deny his motion for disqualification of the Defendant's\n\nattorney, and requests such other and further relief as to which Defendant may show himself justly\n\nentitled.\n\n                                              Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                              MAYO MENDOLIA & VICE, L.L.P.\n                                              I I 0 N.

Procedurally, a Motion for Summary Judgment is premature as\n\nDefendant has had virtually no opportunity to complete or even begin discovery. A timeline of\n\nthe proceeding in this case are as follows:\n\n       4/14/15         Plaintiff’s Original Petition filed.\n\n       6/1/15          Defendant Wendell Reeder’s Original Answer and General Denial filed.\n\n       6/11/15         Motion to Disqualify J.

A\n\nNotice of Appearance of Additional Counsel naming Jack Walker has been filed in this matter\n\nconcurrently with this motion. As of the date of filing of this Motion for Continuance, the\n\nDefendant has only been in the case for approximately 52 days. Defendant is entitled to the\n\nopportunity to conduct discovery and, at a minimum obtain the deposition of the Plaintiff, J.\n\nBennett White with J. Bennett White, P.C. The Defendant would request that this court continue\n\nthe hearing on the summary judgment so as to allow the parties to engage in discovery. This\n\ncontinuance is not sought for delay but so that justice may be done.\n\n\n\n                                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n                                             The Arcadia Theater\n                                             121 N.

Background\n\n         White sued Reeder for breach of contract, alleging that Reeder hired White to perform\n\nattorney services, and failed to pay $212,597.07 in attorney fees.1 White also seeks an award of\n\n12% interest, costs of court, and $70,000 in attorney fees for this proceeding.\n\n         Reeder contests the fees represented to be charged by White, and contests that the fees\n\nwere reasonable and necessary for the work accomplished. Exhibit 1. Further, Reeder believes\n\nthat charges and fees charged by White and his office reflect actions taken by White that were\n\nnot in compliance with or in furtherance of the client’s particular instructions and strategies in\n\nthe case. Exhibit 1. Reeder cannot provide more specific explanation of White’s departures from\n\ninstruction until White actually provides the billing statements with description of legal services\n\nprovided and time spent. Exhibit 1.\n\n         The hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment is currently scheduled to take\n\nplace on August 25, 2015. Procedurally, a Motion for Summary Judgment is premature as\n\nDefendant has had virtually no opportunity to complete or even begin discovery. A timeline of\n\nthe proceeding in this case are as follows:\n\n         4/14/15             Plaintiff’s Original Petition filed.\n\n         6/1/15              Defendant Wendell Reeder’s Original Answer and General Denial filed.\n\n         6/11/15             Motion to Disqualify J.

Keith Mayo and Mayo Mendolia\n                             & Vice, LLP as Attorney for Defendant Wendell Reeder filed.\n\n\n\n1 See Plaintiff’s Original Petition, on file.\n                                                                                                    2\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        0104\n\f           Defendant has recently retained additional counsel to represent him in this matter. A\n\nNotice of Appearance of Additional Counsel naming Jack Walker has been filed in this matter\n\nconcurrently with this motion. As of the date of filing of this Motion for Continuance, the\n\nDefendant has only been in the case for approximately 52 days. Defendant is entitled to the\n\nopportunity to conduct discovery and, at a minimum obtain the deposition of the Plaintiff, J.\n\nBennett White with J. Bennett White, P.C.\n\n                                         II. Table of Exhibits\n\n           Reeder attached the following exhibits which are incorporated by reference as if set forth\n\nin full:\n\nExhibit 1         Affidavit of Wendell Reeder.\n\nPlaintiff also relies upon and incorporates all pleadings on file.\n\n\n                                       III. Standard of Review\n\n           When a movant files a traditional motion for summary judgment based on the summary\n\njudgment evidence, the court can grant the motion only when the movant’s evidence, “as a\n\nmatter of law,” either conclusively establishes all the elements of the movant’s affirmative\n\ndefense or conclusively disproves the facts of at least one element of the nonmovant’s claim.\n\nM.D. Anderson Hosp. and Tumor Inst. v.

Argument and Authorities\n\n       White sued Reeder for breach of contract, and has failed to establish his right to a\n\ntraditional summary judgment, “as a matter of law.”\n\n1. White failed to plead a Suit on Sworn Account, and thus is not entitled to avail himself of\nRule 185’s procedural advantages.\n\n       White’s claim is for breach of contract. White failed to plead breach of contract in a way\n\nthat meets Rule 185’s elements and thus is not allowed to harness a suit on sworn account’s\n\nprocedural benefits.\n\n       Rule 185 states that an open account includes, “any claim… for personal services\n\nrendered.” See Tex. R. Civ. P. 185; Panditi v. Apostle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1489109\"><a href=\"/opinion/1489109/panditi-v-apostle/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">924</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 926 (Tex. App.---Dallas\n\n2006, no pet.). Rule 185 is not a rule of substantive law, but rather, a rule of procedure regarding\n\nthe evidence necessary to establish a prima facie right of recovery for certain types of contractual\n\nclaims. Id.\n\n       It is merely a rule of evidence which, if there is no proper denial, avoids the necessity of\n\nproving the correctness of the account. Long v. Miken Oil, Inc., 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 9189, at\n\n*29 (Tex. App.---Tyler 2014, no pet.). Proof of the contract or sale that gave rise to the account\n\nmust be made as alleged. Id. at 30.\n\n\n                                                                                                  5\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       0107\n\f          If a plaintiff’s pleading of a sworn account is defective or if the defendant files a proper\n\nsworn denial, the plaintiff must offer proof of the sworn account. Id. In a suit on sworn account,\n\nthe plaintiff must prove:\n\n          (1) there was a sale or delivery of the goods or services,\n\n          (2) the charges on the account are just, that is, the prices charged are in\n          accordance with an agreement or, in the absence of an agreement, are usual,\n          customary and reasonable, and\n\n          (3) the amount remains unpaid.\n\nId.\n\n          The account must show with reasonable certainty the name, date and charge for each\n\nitem, and provide specifics or details as to how the figures were arrived at. Panditi, 180 S.W.3d\n\nat 926.\n\n          A claim is liquidated for a suit on sworn account if the amount of damages may be\n\naccurately calculated by the trial court from the “factual, as opposed to the conclusory,”\n\nallegations in the plaintiffs’ petition and the instrument in writing. Id. When a plaintiff’s suit on\n\nsworn account is not based on a liquidated amount, the pleadings are neutralized and the plaintiff\n\nmust prove his case at common law. Id.\n\n          A systematic record must have been kept on all claims brought under the rule. Id. at 31. A\n\nsuit on sworn account must be accompanied by the affidavit of the plaintiff, his agent or his\n\nattorney, that (1) the claim is within the knowledge of the affiant, (2) that the claim is just and\n\ntrue, (3) the account is due, and (4) all just and lawful offsets, payments and credits have been\n\nallowed. Id. A defendant is not required to file a sworn denial if the plaintiff’s suit on a sworn\n\naccount is not properly pleaded. Id.\n\n\n                                                                                                    6\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         0108\n\fa. White failed to establish his prima facie case under Rule 185, and thus is not entitled to\nsuit on sworn account treatment.\n\n       White filed a petition wholly deficient of Rule 185’s requirements. Namely, the petition\n\nwas conclusory and:\n\n      Failed to attach an affidavit establishing facts under oath\n\n      Failed to contain facts establishing systematic record(s) of transaction(s)\n\n      Failed to contain facts establishing that the amount charged were usual, customary and\n       reasonable\n\n      Failed to contain facts establishing a contract between the parties\n\n      Failed to contain facts establishing the lawful payments, offsets and credits applied to the\n       account.\n\nTEX.

Panditi, 180 S.W.3d at 927.\n\n       In every way, White’s petition fails to establish its prima facie burden under Rule 185.\n\nb. Nonetheless, Reeder has filed a sworn denial, and White is put to his burden of proof.\n\n       Reeder is not required to file a sworn denial. “A defendant is not required to file a sworn\n\ndenial if the plaintiff’s suit on a sworn account was not properly pleaded.” Panditi, 180 S.W.3d\n\nat 926. As explained above, because White didn’t properly plead a sworn account, this is a\n\nbreach of contract action and nothing more.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  7\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      0109\n\f        The purpose is straightforward. Defendant cannot be expected to refute allegations that\n\nhaven’t been clearly and particularly alleged and sworn under oath in the first place.\n\n        Nonetheless, Reeder has filed a sworn denial, and White must establish his right to\n\nrecovery by common law. Where a defendant files a verified denial, he is permitted to dispute\n\nthe receipt of services and correctness of the charges. Panditi, 180 S.W.3d at 926.\n\n        Here, Reeder has alleged in his sworn denial that the fees were improper. Ashton Grove\n\nL.C. v.

App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.). Reeder\n\ncontests the fees represented to be charged by White, and contests that the fees were reasonable\n\nand necessary for the work accomplished. Exhibit 1. Further, Reeder believes that charges and\n\nfees charged by White and his office reflect actions taken by White that were not in compliance\n\nwith or in furtherance of the client’s particular instructions and strategies in the case. Exhibit 1.\n\nReeder cannot provide more specific explanation of White’s departures from instruction until\n\nWhite actually provides the billing statements with description of legal services provided and\n\ntime spent. Exhibit 1.\n\n3. White failed to satisfy Andersen Requirements.\n\n        An examination of the documents attached to White’s traditional motion for summary\n\njudgment reveals flimsy, conclusory information that cannot establish his claim as a matter of\n\nlaw. In order to prevail on his motion for summary judgment, White must establish his claim for\n\nbreach of contract, the link between breach of contract and damages, and his contract damages\n\nthemselves “as a matter of law,” which he cannot do. Ashton, 366 S.W.3d at 797-98.\n\n        As explained above, Reeder has alleged in his sworn denial that the fees were improper.\n\nId. at 798.\n\n\n                                                                                                   8\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        0110\n\f          The Andersen factors apply in determining the reasonableness of attorney fees, and these\n\nfactors include: (1) the time and labor required and difficulty of the issues involved; (2) the\n\nlikelihood that acceptance of the employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer; (3)\n\nthe fees customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; (4) the amount involved\n\nand results obtained; (5) the time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (6) the\n\nnature and length of the professional relationship with the client; (7) the experience, reputation,\n\nand ability of the lawyer performing the services; and (8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent\n\non the result obtained. Ashton, 366 S.W.3d at 799.\n\n          In support of his motion, White attaches an affidavit with exhibits. The affidavit fails to\n\nset forward any evidence regarding factors such as fees customarily charged for similar\n\ncircumstances, or the experience or reputation of the lawyers involved.\n\n          White attaches documents he refers to as a “summary of account activity,” containing\n\nconclusory information for seven matters, labeled as Exhibits 4-10. The financial records\n\nattached fail to set forward any information regarding the actual hours worked on a particular\n\nday on a given file, or a description of legal services provided during that time spent. They are\n\nlittle more than meaningless numbers, which, in a vacuum, cannot establish a claim as a matter\n\nof law.\n\n4. Continuance of summary judgment hearing is appropriate.\n\n          As explained in the companion motion, a continuance of any summary judgment hearing\n\nis appropriate. As of the date of filing of the Motion for Continuance, the Defendant has only\n\nbeen in the case for approximately 52 days.

General Denial\n\n        Defendant generally denies the allegations in plaintiffs original petition.\n\n      II. Objection to Consideration as Suit ou Sworn Account, and Special Exceptions\n\n        Defendant objects and specially excepts to plaintiffs petition because the claims are not\n\nproperly brought as a suit on a sworn account. This is a suit for breach of contract arising from\n\nan attorney client relationship.\n\n        White failed to plead breach of contract in a way that meets Rule 185' s elements and thus\n\nis not allowed to harness a suit on sworn account's procedural benefits. His pleadings are\n\ndefective because they fail to establish by affidavit under oath any of the following:\n\n        (!)there was a sale or delivery of the goods or services,\n\n        (2) the charges on the account are just, that is, the prices charged are in\n        accordance with an agreement or, in the absence of an agreement, are usual,\n        customary and reasonable, and\n\n        (3) the amount remains unpaid.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         0117\n\f        (4) systematic records of transactions, such as the name, date and charge for each\n        item, and provide specifics or details as to how the figures were anived at.\n\n        (5) Failed to contain facts establishing the lawful payments, offsets and credits\n        applied to the account.\n\n        Defendant further objects and specially excepts to the conclusory nature of plaintiffs\n\nallegations. The usual and customary practice for attorneys is to make separate time entries\n\ndetailing the date of service provided, amount of time spent, and description of legal service\n\nprovided. Here, the amounts listed are nothing more than conclusions. When a plaintiffs suit on\n\nsworn account is not based on a liquidated amount, the pleadings are neutralized and the plaintiff\n\nmust prove his case at common law. Conclusory totals do not satisfy the record keeping\n\nrequirement of Rule 185.\n\n       A defendant is not required to file a sworn denial if the plaintiffs suit on a sworn account\n\nis not properly pleaded.\n\n                                         III. Verified Pleas\n\n       Defendant denies the account on which plaintiff files suit because not each and every\n\nitem of the account made the basis of plaintiffs suit is just or true. Defendant has filed an\n\naffidavit in support of this answer, and incorporates same as if set forth fully.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      0118\n\f                                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                             MARTIN\n                                             WALKER.r.c.\n                                             The Arcadia Theater\n                                             121 N.

MAYO:    Your Honor, we filed a\n\n14   response, and in the response, we believe that we have\n\n15   met the criteria for isolating this particular\n\n16   nonlawyer/paralegal in the manner prescribed by the law.\n\n17   In the Phoenix Founders case, the Court's very clear\n\n18   with regard to what needs to be done by the law firm\n\n19   hiring the incoming paralegal.\n\n20                   The Court discusses the fact that there\n\n21   doesn't need to be a chilling effect on the hiring of\n\n22   paralegals simply because of the fact a paralegal has\n\n23   worked in another law office prior to coming to this law\n\n24   office, and they've set out the difference between\n\n25   paralegals and lawyers.\n\f                                                                   5\n\n\n\n 1                  Your Honor, I would direct you to Page --\n\n 2   in the Phoenix case, Page 4, beginning on Page 4 in the\n\n 3   second column, and it's really the first full paragraph\n\n 4   beginning with, \"Underlying...\"   It talks about the\n\n 5   criteria that's looked at by the Supreme Court.      And as\n\n 6   long as my firm can satisfy the burden -- well, it's the\n\n 7   Movant's burden to prove that there is a basis for\n\n 8   disqualification, but my response to that, in responding\n\n 9   to that, I simply have to show that there's a screening\n\n10   done with the employee, which there was -- I've included\n\n11   in my affidavit attached to my response -- that there\n\n12   have been measures taken within the office to isolate\n\n13   the employee from these files, which there has been.\n\n14   We've removed the files and segregated those particular\n\n15   files in another office from hers.    She has also\n\n16   instructed, as has our staff and other paralegals, not\n\n17   to discuss this case within the office with this\n\n18   paralegal.\n\n19                  Ms. Smith is very capable paralegal, a\n\n20   single mother, and needs the job.    The Court, not\n\n21   wanting to impose a chilling effect in the hiring of\n\n22   capable legal professionals as long as these criteria\n\n23   been met and we have met this criteria and we believe\n\n24   there's no basis for disqualification, Your Honor.\n\n25                  THE COURT:   Thank you.\n\f                                                                  6\n\n\n\n 1                   Mr. White.\n\n 2                   MR. WHITE:   Thank you, Your Honor.   May\n\n 3   approach, Your Honor?\n\n 4                   THE COURT:   Yes.\n\n 5                   MR. WHITE:   I've printed off this.   It's\n\n 6   the same court opinion that Mr. Mayo provided, although\n\n 7   I did highlight three paragraphs that are a little bit\n\n 8   different place where Mr. Mayo called the Court's\n\n 9   attention to.\n\n10                   Essentially, where the opinion goes to\n\n11   Page 836, the Supreme Court sets forth the criteria\n\n12   that's to be looked at.   And essentially, what this case\n\n13   does is it draws a distinction between the lawyer and\n\n14   the legal assistant whereas the lawyer is presumed,\n\n15   conclusively presumed to share whatever confidences they\n\n16   have to other people in the firm.\n\n17                   The Court Supreme has said that if we want\n\n18   to indulge that conclusive presumption as to a legal\n\n19   assistant, but it says it is inevitable that we should\n\n20   presume some sharing.   On the left-hand column there, it\n\n21   talks about the court will presume some sharing in a\n\n22   case of a legal assistant, but that can be rebutted,\n\n23   which that's the fact that it has to be rebutted by the\n\n24   firm seeking to be -- or the firm -- this -- the target\n\n25   of the disqualification, it would be their burden to\n\f                                                                7\n\n\n\n 1   prove there are adequate safeguards in place, but when\n\n 2   you go over to the next column, you go over the factors\n\n 3   and the circumstances that exist here.\n\n 4                   The first factor is the substantiality of\n\n 5   the relationship between the former and the current\n\n 6   matters.   Well, Your Honor, when Ms. Smith was working\n\n 7   for my firm, there is some portion of the work that's\n\n 8   been sued on here today in this lawsuit that was work\n\n 9   that she provided, so she's a fact witness about work\n\n10   she did that is reflected in the billing.\n\n11                   She worked for my firm which is both the\n\n12   Plaintiff and plaintiff's counsel, so she got\n\n13   confidences of both the employee of the party as well as\n\n14   an employee of the party's attorney.   Well, the matter\n\n15   we are here today is the very same matter that she\n\n16   helped work on right before she left which was\n\n17   accounting for Mr. Reeder's time, reconciling the\n\n18   billing, making sure the amount we were claiming against\n\n19   him was correctly calculated, and so she's got direct\n\n20   involvement in the matter while she worked for my firm,\n\n21   and this is the same exact matter that Mr. Mayo is\n\n22   representing Mr. Reeder on.\n\n23                   The next factor the Supreme Court talks\n\n24   about is the time elapsing between the matters.   This\n\n25   isn't where she did work for me years ago on something\n\f                                                                 8\n\n\n\n 1   that's remote in time from what we're on here today.\n\n 2   This is all bang, bang; March-April of this year.\n\n 3   There's no gap in-between the two.\n\n 4                    The next factor the Supreme Court talks\n\n 5   about is the size of the law firm.    In that case, they\n\n 6   made not that the legal assistant involved was going to\n\n 7   work at Thompson & Knight.    There was the ability to put\n\n 8   her in different departments in different floors.    The\n\n 9   firm was large enough it was easy to lose her among the\n\n10   bodies so there was not much chance that her information\n\n11   would be drawn upon accidentally or improperly.\n\n12   Mr. Mayo's office is a small office.    My office is a\n\n13   small office.    This factor does not weigh in favor of\n\n14   denying our motion.\n\n15                    The next factor says the number of persons\n\n16   presumed to have confidential information.    Mr. Mayo in\n\n17   his responses has indicated he's got three for four\n\n18   employees in his office.    If there's anybody that's\n\n19   presumed to have shared confidences, it would be a\n\n20   substantial percentage of that office.    It's not in this\n\n21   case where the paralegal had shared information with\n\n22   maybe her supervising attorney who had nothing to do\n\n23   with the ongoing matters that were the subject of this\n\n24   qualification.\n\n25                    The next factor is the nature involvement\n\f                                                                9\n\n\n\n 1   in the former matter.    Well, the former matter is the\n\n 2   same matter that we're -- that has resulted in this\n\n 3   case.   She was completely involved in that.\n\n 4                    The next factor is the timing and features\n\n 5   of measures to reduce the dangers of disclosure.\n\n 6   Mr. Mayo has indicated what he believes those to be, and\n\n 7   the Supreme Court goes on to say a little further, the\n\n 8   last part I've highlighted there, the fact that the\n\n 9   present case involves representation of adverse parties\n\n10   in the same proceeding rather than two separate\n\n11   proceedings increases the danger that some improper\n\n12   disclosure may have occurred.    We're here in exactly\n\n13   that scenario.\n\n14                    So to the extent the Supreme Court lowered\n\n15   the boundary or -- or the raised the burden for\n\n16   disqualification to some extent, the manner in which\n\n17   they've raised it simply does not apply to the facts\n\n18   that we have here, and not only that, but this speaks\n\n19   solely to the person being affected as having been an\n\n20   employee of the law firm, not as having been employed by\n\n21   the client.\n\n22                    I mean, we can just imagine in a personal\n\n23   injury case, if a former employee of the defendant goes\n\n24   to work for the plaintiff's law firm.    That -- that\n\n25   would hardly be appropriate.    And Mr. Mayo talks about\n\f                                                                10\n\n\n\n 1   her ability to get a job, he can hire whoever he wants o\n\n 2   hire.   We're not saying he cannot hire her.   It's just\n\n 3   that he has to chose between hiring her and keeping this\n\n 4   case.   He doesn't have to fire her.   He can be\n\n 5   disqualified which would allow her to keep her job which\n\n 6   would protect her from being exposed.\n\n 7                    But the problem we have right now, Your\n\n 8   Honor, she is a fact witness.    She has knowledge that\n\n 9   bears upon the legitimacy of our claim against Mr.\n\n10   Mayo's client.    Mr. Mayo is obligated to zealously\n\n11   defend his client and there's no way for him to\n\n12   zealously defend his client if he's taking a hands-off\n\n13   approach with a fact witness because she happens to work\n\n14   for him.\n\n15                    If she has to testify, she's going to be\n\n16   extremely torn between the truthfulness of the work that\n\n17   she did as reflected in our claim and the loyalty she\n\n18   feels to Mr. Mayo by being employed by him and the\n\n19   loyalty she'll feel for her client as her client, and so\n\n20   that's unfair to do.\n\n21                    If Mr. Reeder has got legitimate defenses,\n\n22   there are plenty other lawyers that can take this case.\n\n23   There's no necessity to keep Mr. Mayo, but under these\n\n24   circumstances and under the facts that exists here,\n\n25   disqualification would be appropriate, and we ask the\n\f                                                                11\n\n\n\n 1   Court to grant our motion and disqualify Mr. Mayo and\n\n 2   his firm.\n\n 3                  THE COURT:    Any further response?\n\n 4                  MR. MAYO:    Just briefly, Your Honor.    The\n\n 5   Phoenix case deals specifically with -- and the Supreme\n\n 6   Court is dealing specifically with what Mr. White has\n\n 7   urged in his motion.    In the Phoenix case, the Supreme\n\n 8   Court says we're lowing the standard because we do not\n\n 9   want to have that effect from hiring capable paralegals\n\n10   simply because they've worked on a case in another firm.\n\n11                  The size of the firm is a criteria.\n\n12   However, in this particular case, to disqualify our firm\n\n13   would be to presume that we haven't given all of these\n\n14   warnings, which I've sworn to an affidavit and attached\n\n15   to my response that we did, and we haven't taken these\n\n16   precautions in my office to isolate Ms. Smith from any\n\n17   exposure to the file.\n\n18                  THE COURT:    Yes, sir.\n\n19                  Let me just say that the Court works on\n\n20   the assumption that everything in the affidavit is\n\n21   correct --\n\n22                  MR. MAYO:    Yes, sir.\n\n23                  THE COURT:    -- and you've taken all those\n\n24   steps and is acting in good faith.      I think Mr. White is\n\n25   correct in what he's saying for the reason that this\n\f                                                                 12\n\n\n\n 1   is -- well, especially for the reason that this is a\n\n 2   case where's it's not representing -- in other words,\n\n 3   this has to do with the law firm itself as visa-vis\n\n 4   Mr. Reeder as opposed to Mr. White.    In other words, I\n\n 5   think it gets too directly into the fact especially she\n\n 6   might be called -- potentially be called as a witness,\n\n 7   and I know she may not necessarily be called as a\n\n 8   witness, but where she could be, this really puts this\n\n 9   in a much more difficult situation that it would be\n\n10   otherwise.\n\n11                  I'm going to -- well, what is our\n\n12   timetable?\n\n13                  MR. MAYO:    It's just begun.   He filed a\n\n14   motion for summary judgement, but other than that, the\n\n15   case has just been filed.\n\n16                  THE COURT:    The summary judgement is\n\n17   going to be heard when?\n\n18                  MR. WHITE:    I don't think we have a\n\n19   setting.\n\n20                  THE COURT:    I'm going to find that,\n\n21   Mr. Mayo, that your firm needs to either withdraw within\n\n22   30 days -- in other words, if the matter isn't resolved\n\n23   some other way within 30 days, that your firm would need\n\n24   to withdraw.\n\n25                  MR. WHITE:    Your Honor, is that a final\n\f                                                                  13\n\n\n\n 1   order?    I presume the Court understands why because I\n\n 2   understand Mr. Reeder is going to ask me to have this\n\n 3   decision reviewed, I feel confident.\n\n 4                    THE COURT:    And, you know, I know\n\n 5   mandamus isn't used as much as it used to be, but if\n\n 6   it's available, why certainly, that's you need to take\n\n 7   advantage of if you feel like that's what needs to be\n\n 8   done.    So I guess let me make that -- just put it on the\n\n 9   basis of the fact changing that to where I'm saying that\n\n10   I find there is a conflict and that --\n\n11                    MR. MAYO:    Even though it's the same\n\n12   client?    That's okay.\n\n13                    THE COURT:    Yes, sir.   And that -- and so\n\n14   you've got something real clear to deal with.\n\n15                    If you'll reduce that to a properly\n\n16   written form, and if counsel signs off it approving as\n\n17   to form, I'll sign it when I get it.\n\n18                    MR. WHITE:    I will prepare the proposed\n\n19   order.\n\n20                    THE COURT:    Yes, sir.\n\n21                    (End of proceedings.)\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\f                                                              14\n\n\n\n 1                    REPORTER'S CERTIFICATE\n\n 2   THE STATE OF TEXAS          )\n     COUNTY OF WOOD         )\n 3\n\n 4        I, Una B.
