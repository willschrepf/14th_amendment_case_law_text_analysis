INTRODUCTION\n\n      Plaintiffs-Appellees brought a class action suit against Defendant-Appellant\n\nState of Colorado (“Colorado”). Plaintiffs claimed that the fee charged by\n\nColorado for handicapped parking placards violated the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”) and implementing regulations. After\n\nstipulating to various facts, both parties moved for summary judgment. In its\n\nmotion for summary judgment, Colorado argued that Plaintiffs’ claims were\n\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment. The district court granted Plaintiffs’ motion\n\nfor summary judgment and denied Colorado’s motion for summary judgment.\n\nColorado has appealed the district court’s decision; jurisdiction to consider\n\n\n\n      The Honorable Thomas M. Reavley, Senior Judge, United States Court of\n      *\n\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fColorado’s appeal arises under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Because Colorado is entitled\n\nto Eleventh Amendment immunity, this court        vacates the order of the district\n\ncourt granting Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and denying Colorado’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\nII. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       Under Colorado law, a “person with a disability” may apply for a special\n\nlicense plate or placard.   See Colo. Rev. Stat. § 42-3-121(2)(a). The license plate\n\nand the placard allow the disabled person to park in designated handicap parking\n\nspaces. See id. § 42-4-1208(3)(a).     The special license plates are supplied to the\n\ndisabled at the same cost as standard license plates. See id. § 42-3-121(2)(a)(I).\n\nIn order to receive a placard, however, a fee must be paid. See id. § 42-3-\n\n121(2)(d). The fee is not to exceed the actual cost of issuing the placard; at the\n\ntime of appellate briefing the fee was $2.25.     See id.\n\n       Plaintiffs brought a class action suit against Colorado challenging the\n\nimposition of the placard fee. Plaintiffs claimed that the placard fee violated\n\nTitle II of the ADA and the implementing regulations promulgated by the\n\nDepartment of Justice. Title II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual\n\nwith a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation\n\nin or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public\n\nentity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132.\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fThe term “public entity” includes “any State or local government” and “any\n\ndepartment, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or\n\nStates or local government.” Id. § 12131(1). Plaintiffs also relied on 28 C.F.R. §\n\n35.130(f), a regulation promulgated by the Department of Justice for the purpose\n\nof implementing Title II of the ADA. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.101. Section 35.130(f)\n\nprovides as follows:\n\n             A public entity may not place a surcharge on a particular\n      individual with a disability or any group of individuals with\n      disabilities to cover the costs of measures, such as the provision of\n      auxiliary aids or program accessibility, that are required to provide\n      that individual or group with the nondiscriminatory treatment\n      required by the [ADA] or this part.\n\n      Plaintiffs requested two forms of relief in their complaint: (1) a declaration\n\nthat it is unlawful for Colorado to require payment for the parking placards and a\n\nsubsequent injunction preventing Colorado from charging these fees in the\n\nfuture, and (2) reimbursement of previous fees paid by Plaintiffs for the placards\n\nafter passage of the ADA.    1\n                                 Colorado was the only defendant named in the\n\ncomplaint.\n\n      In its answer, Colorado claimed, inter alia, that it was entitled to immunity\n\nunder the Eleventh Amendment. After stipulating to many relevant facts, both\n\nparties moved for summary judgment. Although Plaintiffs’ complaint sought both\n\n\n\n      1\n          Plaintiffs also requested attorney fees and litigation costs.\n\n                                            -4-\n\finjunctive relief and reimbursement for past fees paid, Plaintiffs’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment was only for declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\n      The cross motions for summary judgment were referred to a magistrate\n\njudge. The magistrate judge concluded that (1) the placard fee charged by\n\nColorado violated Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations; (2)\n\nColorado was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity; and (3) Title II of\n\nthe ADA does not violate the Tenth Amendment. The magistrate judge thus\n\nrecommended that Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment be granted, that\n\nColorado’s motion for summary judgment be denied, and that a schedule be set\n\nfor certification of the plaintiff class claiming reimbursement of fees paid to\n\nColorado for placards.\n\n      The district court adopted the magistrate judge’s recommendations over\n\nColorado’s objections. Colorado appealed to this court. After oral argument, this\n\ncourt formally abated the case following the Supreme Court’s grant of certiorari\n\nin Florida Department of Corrections v. Dickson. See 528 U.S. 1132 (2000).\n\nThe Dickson case settled, however, and this case was then reactivated. See Fla.\n\nDep’t of Corr. v. Dickson, 528 U.S. 1184 (2000). This court further delayed\n\ndeciding this case, however, in order to await the outcome of Board of Trustees of\n\nthe University of Alabama v. Garrett and to allow the parties and the United\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fStates as intervenor to file supplemental briefs; the Supreme Court decided\n\nGarrett on February 21, 2001. See 121 S. Ct. 955 (2001).\n\nIII. DISCUSSION\n\n      On appeal, Colorado argues that it is entitled to Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity from Plaintiffs’ suit. Under circuit precedent, a defendant’s assertion\n\nof Eleventh Amendment immunity calls into question the subject matter\n\njurisdiction of the district court. See Martin v. Kansas, 190 F.3d 1120, 1126\n\n(10th Cir. 1999), overruled on other grounds by Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 967-68.\n\nBut see Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene, 521 U.S. 261, 267 (1997) (stating that the\n\nEleventh Amendment “enacts a sovereign immunity from suit, rather than a\n\nnonwaivable limit on the Federal Judiciary’s subject-matter jurisdiction”);\n\nCisneros v. Wilson, 226 F.3d 1113, 1136, 1137 (10th Cir. 2000) (Kelly, J.,\n\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (arguing that “[w]ere the Eleventh\n\nAmendment truly jurisdictional, a court would not be free to ignore it” and stating\n\nthat the court should not have reached the Eleventh Amendment issue), majority\n\nholding overruled on other grounds by Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 967. Questions\n\nregarding jurisdiction must generally be answered before turning to the merits of\n\na case. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 93-102 (1998)\n\n(rejecting the doctrine of hypothetical jurisdiction). The Supreme Court has held\n\nthat the issue of whether a statute provides for suits against the states may be\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\faddressed before examining a defendant’s claim of Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity. See Vt. Agency of Natural Res. v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529\n\nU.S. 765, 778-79 (2000). Colorado, however, concedes that Title II of the ADA\n\ncontemplates suits by private individuals against the states. Thus, Vermont\n\nAgency is not applicable to this case and this court must resolve whether Colorado\n\nis entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity before it can address whether\n\nPlaintiffs have stated a valid claim under Title II and its implementing\n\nregulations.\n\n      The Eleventh Amendment provides:\n\n             The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed\n      to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted\n      against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by\n      Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\n\nThe Eleventh Amendment has been understood as “evidencing and exemplifying”\n\na concept of sovereign immunity implicit in the Constitution broader than the\n\nexplicit language of the amendment might suggest. Coeur d’Alene, 521 U.S. at\n\n267-68; see also Blatchford v. Native Vill. of Noatak, 501 U.S. 775, 779 (1991).\n\nThus, although the explicit language of the Eleventh Amendment applies only to\n\nsuits in federal court against a state by citizens of another state, immunity has\n\nbeen extended to suits in federal court by citizens against their own state, such as\n\nthe present suit. See Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 962; Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1,\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f15-21 (1890); cf. Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 754 (1999) (holding that states\n\npossess sovereign immunity from federal suits in state courts).\n\n      Certain exceptions to Eleventh Amendment immunity have been\n\nrecognized. A state can waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity and consent to\n\nbe sued. See Coeur d’Alene, 521 U.S. at 267. There has been no suggestion in\n\nthis case, however, that Colorado consented to suit under Title II of the ADA. In\n\naddition, the Court has often found federal jurisdiction in suits against state\n\nofficials seeking prospective injunctive relief. See Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517\n\nU.S. 44, 73 (1996). These suits are referred to as Ex parte Young suits, based on\n\nthe Supreme Court case first recognizing this exception to Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity. See Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159-60 (1908). Because no state\n\nofficial has been named as a defendant in this suit, however, the Ex parte Young\n\nexception to Eleventh Amendment immunity is not appropriate. 2\n\n\n      2\n        Plaintiffs have filed a Motion for Leave to Amend to Add Party Defendant,\nseeking to add Fred Fisher in his capacity as Executive Director of the Colorado\nDepartment of Revenue. This motion is obviously an attempt to make prospective\ninjunctive relief possible through an Ex parte Young suit. It appears that, if this\ncourt were inclined to grant the motion, it would have the power to do so. See\nNewman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U.S. 826, 833 (1989) (concluding\nthat appellate courts do have the power to dismiss a dispensable party whose\npresence spoils statutory diversity jurisdiction); Balgowan v. New Jersey, 115\nF.3d 214, 216-17 (3d Cir. 1997) (granting motion to amend the complaint to add a\nstate official as a defendant and to include a claim for prospective declaratory and\ninjunctive relief, thus making Ex parte Young suit possible). Nevertheless, there\nare considerations weighing against Plaintiffs’ motion.\n       Allowing Plaintiffs to amend their complaint would substantially alter the\n\n                                          -8-\n\frelevant legal issues to be decided in this case. Under the current complaint, the\ninitial question that must be answered by this court is whether Colorado is entitled\nto Eleventh Amendment immunity. The main consideration in this analysis is\nwhether Congress validly abrogated Colorado’s Eleventh Amendment immunity in\nenacting Title II of the ADA. If Plaintiffs’ motion to amend is granted, however,\nthis court could address the district court’s award of the prospective injunctive\nrelief requested in Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment without regard to the\nEleventh Amendment immunity question. See Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123,\n159-60 (1908). In addition, after Plaintiffs filed their motion to amend, Colorado\nasserted a challenge to Congress’ ability to pass Title II of the ADA pursuant to\nthe Interstate Commerce Clause. If Plaintiffs’ motion to amend were granted,\nfairness would require this court to allow Defendants to press the Commerce\nClause argument; more briefing and perhaps additional oral argument would then\nbe necessary to properly evaluate the Commerce Clause issue. Allowing the\namendment would wholly alter the complexion of this case.\n        Furthermore, unlike in Balgowan, there has been no reversal of a prior\nSupreme Court case on which Plaintiffs relied in drafting their complaint. In\nBalgowan, the plaintiffs had brought a claim against the New Jersey Department\nof Transportation seeking monetary relief for alleged violations of the Fair Labor\nStandards Act of 1938 (“FLSA”), 29 U.S.C. § 201-219 (1978). See 115 F.3d at\n216. Under Supreme Court precedent at the time the plaintiffs in Balgowan filed\nsuit, it appeared that the FLSA was a valid exercise of Congress’ Commerce\nClause power and that Congress could abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity\nthrough legislation enacted pursuant to the Commerce Clause. See Pennsylvania\nv. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1, 19-20 (1989); Garcia v. San Antonio Metro.\nTransit Auth., 469 U.S. 528, 555-56 (1985). In Seminole Tribe v. Florida, which\nwas decided after the plaintiffs in Balgowan filed suit, the Supreme Court\nreversed Union Gas and held that Congress cannot abrogate Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity by means of its Commerce Clause power. See 517 U.S. 44, 66 (1996).\nThus, the Third Circuit allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, partly\nbecause of the plaintiffs’ reliance on Union Gas. See Balgowan, 115 F.3d at 217.\nPlaintiffs in this case, however, have identified no similar equitable consideration\njustifying their eleventh-hour request to amend their complaint.\n        In Newman-Green the Supreme Court emphasized that the power of\nappellate courts to dismiss a nondiverse party “should be exercised sparingly.”\n490 U.S. at 837. This admonition applies to Plaintiffs’ motion to add a party,\nwhich has neither alleged nor shown that denial of the motion results in an\nadvantage lost by the Plaintiffs or disadvantage incurred. For the above-stated\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      Under certain circumstances Congress may abrogate a state’s Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity. See Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 55. First, Congress must\n\n“unequivocally express[] its intent to abrogate the immunity.” Green v. Mansour,\n\n474 U.S. 64, 68 (1985). Congress has clearly expressed its intent to abrogate\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity in the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. § 12202. Second,\n\nCongress must abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity pursuant to a\n\n“constitutional provision granting Congress the power to abrogate.” Seminole\n\nTribe, 517 U.S. at 59. After Seminole Tribe, only Section Five of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment stands as a recognized source of power by which Congress can\n\nabrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity. See id. at 59-66 (overruling\n\nPennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1 (1989), which held that Congress can\n\nabrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity pursuant to the Interstate Commerce\n\nClause). Congress relied on Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment in\n\nenacting the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(4). The mere recitation by\n\nCongress of Section Five as a basis for the ADA does not, however, end the\n\ninquiry; it is a function of the judicial branch to determine whether Congress was\n\nwithin its Section Five authority to abrogate the states’ Eleventh Amendment\n\n\n\n\nreasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to Amend to Add Party Defendant is\ndenied.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fimmunity by enacting Title II. See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 527-29\n\n(1997); Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176-80 (1803).\n\n      Both this court and the Supreme Court have recently considered whether\n\nthe ADA is a valid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity. In Martin v.\n\nKansas, this court considered a former corrections officer’s claims against the\n\nState of Kansas brought under Title I of the ADA. See 190 F.3d at 1123-25,\n\n1129. Title I of the ADA prohibits certain employers, including the states, from\n\n“discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual with a disability” in matters\n\nrelated to employment. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12111(2), (5).\n\nIn Martin, this court concluded that “the ADA was a permissible exercise of\n\nCongress’ Section 5 enforcement powers” and thus validly abrogated Kansas’\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity. 190 F.3d at 1128. It is not entirely clear from\n\nthe opinion, however, whether the holding that the ADA was a valid abrogation of\n\nthe states’ Eleventh Amendment immunity applied to all suits brought under the\n\nADA or solely to Title I suits such as the one brought in Martin. Compare\n\nMartin, 190 F.3d at 1125-26 (describing ADA in terms of the duties imposed\n\nunder Title I in matters of employment), with Johnson v. Oklahoma, Nos.\n\n99-6322, 99-6427, 2000 WL 1114194, at *1 (10th Cir. Aug. 7, 2000) (unpublished\n\ndisposition) (suggesting Martin’s holding that the ADA validly abrogated the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fstates’ Eleventh Amendment immunity applied to a claim brought under Title II\n\nof the ADA).\n\n      This court again considered a claim brought under Title I of the ADA in\n\nCisneros v. Wilson. See 226 F.3d at 1115. In Cisneros, the court considered\n\nwhether Martin’s holding that the ADA abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity\n\nwas still good law in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Kimel v. Florida\n\nBoard of Regents, 528 U.S. 62 (2000). See Cisneros, 226 F.3d at 1118. In Kimel,\n\nthe Supreme Court held that Congress did not validly abrogate the states’\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity in passing the Age Discrimination in Employment\n\nAct, 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634. See 528 U.S. at 82-83. This court concluded in\n\nCisneros that nothing in Kimel required the court to “revise the conclusions\n\nexpressed” in Martin and thus confirmed the viability of Martin’s conclusion that\n\nthe ADA validly abrogated the states’ Eleventh Amendment immunity. 226 F.3d\n\nat 1128. Because both Cisneros and Martin were Title I cases, however, it was\n\nnot necessary for the Cisneros court to determine whether Martin applied to the\n\nentire ADA or just Title I.\n\n      In Garrett, the Supreme Court held that Title I of the ADA was not a valid\n\nabrogation of the states’ Eleventh Amendment immunity. See 121 S. Ct. at 967-\n\n68. The Court noted that the legislative record of the ADA did not identify a\n\npattern of unconstitutional discrimination by the states and that even if such a\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\frecord existed “the rights and remedies created by the ADA against the States\n\nwould raise the same sort of concerns as to congruence and proportionality as\n\nwere found in City of Boerne.” Id. at 966, 965. The Court, however, explicitly\n\nlimited its ruling to Title I of the ADA and stated that it was “not disposed to\n\ndecide [in Garrett] the constitutional issue whether Title II, which has somewhat\n\ndifferent remedial provisions from Title I, is appropriate legislation under § 5 of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.” Id. at 960 n.1.\n\n      Against this backdrop of cases, this court must determine whether the\n\nvalidity of Congress’ attempt through Title II to abrogate the states’ Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity is controlled by precedent. Garrett, although clearly\n\ninstrumental in informing this court’s analysis, expressly disavows any holding on\n\nTitle II of the ADA. See id. As stated above, it is not clear whether the decision\n\nin Martin was intended to apply to the entire ADA or only Title I. 3 It is not\n\nnecessary, however, for this court to resolve that because Garrett clarifies that\n\nwhen evaluating a claim under the ADA the abrogation analysis should be\n\nconducted on each specific title, not on the statute as a whole. The Supreme\n\nCourt held in Garrett that Title I of the ADA was not a valid abrogation of\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity; it did not render a decision as to the entire ADA.\n\n\n\n      3\n       Whatever the scope of Martin, clearly Garrett now controls claims\nbrought pursuant to Title I.\n\n                                         -13-\n\fSee id. Thus, even if Martin was a holding as to the entire ADA, Garrett\n\ndemonstrates that it was error to conduct the abrogation analysis at that level of\n\ngenerality. 4 See Currier v. Doran, 242 F.3d 905, 912 (10th Cir. 2001) (stating\n\n\n\n      4\n        While some courts have addressed the Eleventh Amendment question by\nbroadly considering the entire ADA, see Coolbaugh v. Louisiana, 136 F.3d 430,\n437-38 (5th Cir. 1998), other courts have gone in the opposite direction and\nconsidered whether the specific regulation under which the plaintiff makes a\nclaim is a valid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Neinast v.\nTexas, 217 F.3d 275, 280–82 (5th Cir. 2000) (stating that 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(f)\nexceeds Congress’ Section Five power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment),\ncert denied, 121 S. Ct. 1188 (2001); Brown v. N.C. Div. of Motor Vehicles, 166\nF.3d 698, 701, 703-04 (4th Cir. 1999) (same), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 1186\n(2001). This court agrees with the Ninth Circuit in rejecting a specific\n“piecemeal analysis” of whether each regulation passed pursuant to Title II is a\nvalid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Dare v. California, 191\nF.3d 1167, 1176 n.7 (9th Cir. 1999), cert denied, 121 S. Ct. 1187 (2001); see also\nAlsbrook v. City of Maumelle, 184 F.3d 999, 1010 (8th Cir. 1999) (en banc)\n(holding that Title II of the ADA is not a valid abrogation of Eleventh\nAmendment immunity). The analysis adopted by the Supreme Court in cases such\nas Garrett addresses Congress’ ability to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity\nby enacting legislation pursuant to its power to enforce the Fourteenth\nAmendment. The power of various agencies to enact regulations implementing\nlegislation passed by Congress is an entirely different question, one that is\ngenerally approached with deference by the courts. See Olmstead v. Zimring, 527\nU.S. 581, 597 (1999) (“Because the Department [of Justice] is the agency directed\nby Congress to issue regulations implementing Title II, its views warrant respect.\nWe need not inquire whether the degree of deference described in Chevron U.S.A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct.\n2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), is in order; [i]t is enough to observe that the\nwell-reasoned views of the agencies implementing a statute constitute a body of\nexperience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly\nresort for guidance.” (quotations and citation omitted)). In this court’s view, it is\nsimply inappropriate to apply the abrogation analysis to agency regulations.\nThus, as the Supreme Court did with Title I in Garrett, this court will conduct the\nabrogation analysis by considering Title II in its entirety.\n\n                                         -14-\n\fthat a panel is not bound by a prior panel opinion when there is a superseding\n\nSupreme Court decision). Therefore, this court now writes on a clean slate in\n\naddressing whether Title II of the ADA is a valid abrogation of the states’\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n      Whether there has been an abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity is\n\ngenerally controlled by the “now familiar principles” for determining whether the\n\nstatute in question was validly passed pursuant to Section Five of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment. Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 963. Section Five gives Congress the power\n\nto enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment by enacting “appropriate\n\nlegislation.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 5; see also Flores, 521 U.S. at 536. This\n\npower “includes the authority both to remedy and to deter violation of rights\n\nguaranteed [by the Fourteenth Amendment] by prohibiting a somewhat broader\n\nswath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the\n\nAmendment’s text.” Kimel, 528 U.S. at 81. When Congress has enacted\n\nlegislation that exceeds the substantive guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment,\n\nhowever, the legislation must exhibit “congruence and proportionality between\n\nthe [constitutional] injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to\n\nthat end.” Flores, 521 U.S. at 520. In conducting the congruent and proportional\n\nanalysis, courts look to the Congressional record to determine “whether Congress\n\n\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fidentified a history and pattern of unconstitutional [conduct] by the States.”\n\nGarrett, 121 S. Ct. at 964.\n\n      In determining whether Title II is a valid abrogation of Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity, it is first important to delineate with some care what\n\nconduct Title II prohibits or, perhaps more appropriately in this case, what\n\nconduct Title II requires. Title II states that “ no qualified individual with a\n\ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or\n\nbe denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity,\n\nor be subjected to discrimination by any such entity   .” 42 U.S.C. § 12132.\n\n      A cursory reading of the statutory language can leave the impression that\n\nTitle II simply prohibits intentional exclusion against the disabled solely because\n\nof their status as “disabled.” A more thorough review, however, reveals that,\n\nrather than preventing public entities from treating the disabled differently than\n\nthe nondisabled, Title II requires that public entities make certain\n\naccommodations for the disabled in order to ensure their access to government\n\nprograms. See Bonnie Poitras Tucker, The ADA’s Revolving Door: Inherent\n\nFlaws in the Civil Rights Paradigm, 62 Ohio St. L.J. 335, 344 (2001) (stating that\n\n“[s]imple equal treatment does not result in [the disabled’s] inclusion into\n\nmainstream society” and that “[t]he ADA recognizes this need for different\n\ntreatment”). That Title II of the ADA requires accommodations by public entities\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\fis evident from other portions of the statute, the regulations implementing Title II,\n\nand caselaw interpreting the statute.\n\n       The findings section of the ADA (applicable to all titles of the Act) states\n\nthat\n\n       individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of\n       discrimination, including outright intentional exclusion,    the\n       discriminatory effects of architectural, transportation, and\n       communication barriers, overprotective rules and policies, failure to\n       make modifications to existing facilities and practices   , exclusionary\n       qualification standards and criteria, segregation, and relegation to\n       lesser services, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other\n       opportunities.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12101(5) (emphasis added). The definition of a “qualified individual\n\nwith a disability” also illustrates the affirmative duty Title II imposes on public\n\nentities:\n\n              The term “qualified individual with a disability” means an\n       individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable\n       modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of\n       architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the\n       provision of auxiliary aids and services , meets the essential\n       eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation\n       in programs or activities provided by a public entity.\n\nId. § 12131(2) (emphasis added). In addition, Part B of Title II delineates\n\nspecific examples of what constitutes “discrimination” by public entities in their\n\npublic transportation services. See id. §§ 12141-12165. This section of the\n\nstatute requires, inter alia, that all new public transportation vehicles be\n\naccessible to the disabled and that any public entity which operates a fixed route\n\n                                         -17-\n\ftransportation system provide comparable services for use by the disabled. See\n\nid. §§ 12142-12144.\n\n      Thus, from the language of the statute it is clear Title II requires public\n\nentities to make accommodations for the disabled. The regulations issued by the\n\nDepartment of Justice implementing Title II confirm this reading of the statute.\n\nCf. Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 304-05 & n.24 (1985) (using regulations\n\nas a source of guidance in interpreting a statute). One regulation provides that\n\n      [a] public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies,\n      practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to\n      avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public\n      entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would\n      fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.\n\n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). The regulation on which Plaintiffs in this case have\n\nbased their claim also demonstrates that public entities will be required to take\n\ncertain “measures” in order to comply with Title II. Id. § 35.130(f).\n\n      Finally, many courts have recognized that Title II requires public entities to\n\nmake accommodations for the disabled. See, e.g., Popovich v. Cuyahoga County\n\nCourt of Common Pleas, 227 F.3d 627, 638 (6th Cir. 2000) (stating that Title II\n\n“imposes an affirmative obligation on public entities to accommodate disabled\n\nindividuals”), rehearing en banc granted, opinion vacated (Dec. 12, 2000);\n\nAlsbrook v. City of Maumelle, 184 F.3d 999, 1009 (8th Cir. 1999) (en banc).\n\nSimilarly, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“§ 504”), which uses\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\flanguage almost identical to Title II in describing a violation by covered entities, 5\n\nhas been interpreted to require “reasonable accommodations” to covered programs\n\nor services. See Sch. Bd. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287 n.17 (1987) (stating that\n\n“reasonable accommodations” by covered entities are required under § 504);\n\nAlexander, 469 U.S. at 299-301 (assuming without deciding that § 504 provides\n\nfor at least some disparate impact claims and that “reasonable accommodations . .\n\n. may have to be made”); Wynne v. Tufts Univ. Sch. of Med., 932 F.2d 19, 25 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (en banc). Thus, the duty to accommodate contained in Title II is well\n\nsettled.\n\n       It appears, however, that the duty to accommodate under § 12132 is not\n\nboundless. Regulations issued by the Department of Justice speak of “reasonable\n\nmodifications” that do not “fundamentally alter the nature of the service,\n\nprogram, or activity.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2)\n\n(defining “qualified individual with a disability” as an individual “who, with or\n\nwithout reasonable modifications . . ., meets the essential eligibility requirements\n\nfor the receipt of services” (emphasis added)). While expressly avoiding any\n\nruling on the validity of § 35.130(b)(7), the Supreme Court has interpreted the\n\nregulation to allow inquiry into whether an accommodation is “reasonable” in\n\nlight of, inter alia, “the resources available to the State.” Olmstead v. Zimring,\n\n\n       5\n           Compare 42 U.S.C. § 12132, with 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).\n\n                                         -19-\n\f527 U.S. 581, 607, 592, 603-07 (1999). It is not necessary for purposes of this\n\ncase to determine exactly when a state might refuse an accommodation because it\n\nis “unreasonable” or because it “fundamentally alter[s] the nature of the service,\n\nprogram, or activity”; this court will assume that such a defense does exist in\n\ncertain circumstances.\n\n      The next step in determining whether Title II is a valid abrogation of\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity “is to identify with some precision the scope of\n\nthe constitutional right at issue.” Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 963. Section Five of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment gives Congress the power to enforce the provisions of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs claim that Title II enforces both the Equal\n\nProtection Clause and the Due Process Clause. See U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.\n\n      The fundamental guarantee of the Equal Protection Clause is that “all\n\npersons similarly situated should be treated alike.” City of Cleburne v. Cleburne\n\nLiving Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985). Thus, a typical claim brought under the\n\nEqual Protection Clause challenges a classification or distinction made by the\n\nstate. The reviewing court then determines the seriousness with which the Equal\n\nProtection Clause treats the particular classification and then applies the\n\nappropriate degree of judicial scrutiny to the state justifications for making the\n\ndistinction.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\f      The Supreme Court case of Cleburne follows this pattern. In Cleburne, the\n\nCourt considered an Equal Protection challenge to a city ordinance that required a\n\nspecial use permit for construction of a group home for the mentally disabled.\n\nSee id. at 435-37. The Court determined that “mental retardation” is not a quasi-\n\nsuspect class and that state legislation making classifications based on mental\n\nretardation need only be rationally related to a legitimate city interest. See id. at\n\n442-46. Thus, a state violates the Equal Protection Clause if it makes distinctions\n\nbetween the disabled and nondisabled without a rational justification. 6 Of course,\n\n“a bare [] desire to harm a politically unpopular group” is not a legitimate state\n\ninterest. See United States Dep’t of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973).\n\nWhen a state acts with invidious intent there is an equal protection violation even\n\nif no facial distinction has been made and the state action merely has a disparate\n\nimpact on the disabled. See Lee v. City of L.A., 250 F.3d 668, 686-88 (9th Cir.\n\n2001); Erickson v. Bd. of Governors of State Colls. & Univs. for Northeastern Ill.\n\nUniv., 207 F.3d 945, 950 (7th Cir. 2000).\n\n      In contrast to the Equal Protection Clause prohibition on invidious\n\ndiscrimination against the disabled and irrational distinctions between the\n\n\n\n      6\n        Although Cleburne dealt only with classifications based on mental\nretardation, the Court’s decision in Garrett confirms that classifications based on\ndisabilities, whether mental or otherwise, are subject only to rational basis review.\nSee Bd. of Trustees of the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 121 S. Ct. 955, 963-65 (2001).\n\n                                          -21-\n\fdisabled and the nondisabled, Title II requires public entities to recognize the\n\nunique position of the disabled and to make favorable accommodations on their\n\nbehalf. Thus, while the basic premise of the Equal Protection Clause is that\n\nsimilarly situated citizens should be treated alike, the mandate of the ADA is that\n\nthose who are not similarly situated should be treated differently. The Equal\n\nProtection Clause does not generally require accommodations on behalf of the\n\ndisabled by the states. See Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 964 (“If special accommodations\n\nfor the disabled are to be required, they have to come from positive law and not\n\nthrough the Equal Protection Clause.”); Erickson, 207 F.3d at 951 (“[N]o one\n\nbelieves that the Equal Protection Clause establishes the disparate-impact and\n\nmandatory-accommodation rules found in the ADA.”).\n\n      Plaintiffs correctly note that a fundamental interest in voting inheres in the\n\nEqual Protection Clause. See Harper v. Va. Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 665\n\n(1966) (“[O]nce the franchise is granted to the electorate, lines may not be drawn\n\nwhich are inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.”). Thus, state measures which have the effect of denying or diluting\n\na citizen’s vote must be justified with a compelling state interest. See id. at 670\n\n(striking down state poll tax); Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 568-69 (1964)\n\n(establishing the one person-one vote standard). It is not clear whether the equal\n\nprotection interest in voting requires states to make accommodations for the\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\fdisabled in order to ensure their ability to vote. See Selph v. Council of L.A., 390\n\nF. Supp. 58, 61 (C.D.Cal. 1975) (holding that Equal Protection Clause does not\n\nrequire city to make polling places accessible to the disabled when absentee\n\nvoting is available); Whalen v. Heimann, 373 F. Supp. 353, 357 (D. Conn. 1974)\n\n(finding no equal protection violation in failing to provide absentee ballots to\n\nthose who are physically unable to vote and stating that “[a] physically\n\nincapacitated voter has no more basis to challenge a voting requirement of\n\npersonal appearance than a blind voter can complain that the ballot is not printed\n\nin braille” and that it is not “the province of courts to weigh the relative ease or\n\ndifficulty with which the state could accommodate its voting procedures to meet\n\nthe needs of various handicapped voters”); cf. McDonald v. Bd of Election\n\nComm’rs, 394 U.S. 802, 806-11 & n.6 (1969) (holding that Illinois did not violate\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause by refusing to give unsentenced inmates an absentee\n\nballot, when there was no record evidence that inmates would be prevented from\n\nvoting on election day). For purposes of this case only, this court assumes\n\nwithout deciding that the Equal Protection Clause requires states and local entities\n\neither to make polling locations accessible to the disabled or to allow the disabled\n\nto vote by absentee ballot.\n\n      Plaintiffs also rely on the Due Process Clause. The Due Process Clause of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment has been interpreted to incorporate most of the\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\fguarantees found in the Bill of Rights; these incorporated provisions thus apply to\n\nthe states as well as the federal government. See Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S.\n\n145, 148 (1968). Some of the incorporated guarantees of the first ten\n\namendments require states, on certain occasions, to make accommodations for the\n\ndisabled. For instance, a prison is required to provide the disabled with\n\naccessible toilets in order to comply with the prohibition against cruel and\n\nunusual punishment contained in the Eighth Amendment. See LaFaut v. Smith,\n\n834 F.2d 389, 389-95 (4th Cir. 1987) (Powell, J., sitting by designation). In at\n\nleast some instances, the failure of states to provide accessible courtrooms could\n\nconceivably be a violation of due process. See Faretta v. California, 422 U.S.\n\n806, 819 n.15 (1975) (“[A]n accused has a right to be present at all stages of the\n\ntrial where his absence might frustrate the fairness of the proceedings.”);\n\nHelminski v. Ayerst Labs., 766 F.2d 208, 215 (6th Cir. 1985) (holding that a civil\n\nlitigant’s “physical condition alone does not warrant his exclusion from the\n\ncourtroom during any portion of the proceedings”). These examples do not\n\nexhaust the categories of rights protected by a requirement for some level of\n\naccommodation under the Due Process Clause. See, e.g., Youngberg v. Romeo,\n\n457 U.S. 307, 309-10, 322 (1982) (holding that mentally disabled individual who\n\nhad been involuntarily committed to a state institution was entitled by Due\n\nProcess Clause to “minimally adequate training”). For purposes of this case,\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\fhowever, it is sufficient to note that the Due Process Clause does not contain the\n\ngeneral mandate found in Title II, which requires accommodations by public\n\nentities in all of its “services, programs, or activities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132.\n\n      Thus, states can violate the Fourteenth Amendment rights of the disabled in\n\nthree different ways. First, facial distinctions between the disabled and\n\nnondisabled are unconstitutional unless rationally related to a legitimate state\n\ninterest. Second, invidious state action against the disabled is unconstitutional,\n\neven if facially neutral toward the disabled (such as neutral statutory language).\n\nFinally, in certain limited circumstances such as those involving voting rights and\n\nprison conditions, states are required to make at least some accommodations for\n\nthe disabled.\n\n      Having explored the Fourteenth Amendment’s protections of the disabled,\n\nthis court next “examine[s] whether Congress identified a history and pattern of\n\nunconstitutional [conduct] by the States against the disabled.” Garrett, 121 S. Ct.\n\nat 964. In conducting this inquiry, only constitutional violations committed by\n\nbeneficiaries of the Eleventh Amendment are considered. 7 See id. at 965.\n\n\n      7\n       Of course, whether a particular defendant is entitled to Eleventh\nAmendment immunity is not always a straightforward question. See, e.g., Ambus\nv. Granite Bd. of Educ., 995 F.2d 992, 995-97 (10th Cir. 1993) (en banc)\n(applying four-part test to determine if local school districts are entitled to\nEleventh Amendment immunity). As a result of the directive in Garrett that only\ncongressional findings of constitutional violations by beneficiaries of the\nEleventh Amendment be considered, a determination that a statute is not a valid\n\n                                         -25-\n\f      Congress held thirteen hearings and created a special task force to assess\n\nthe need for the ADA. See Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 969-70 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\nAs a result of these inquiries, Congress determined that “discrimination against\n\nindividuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as employment,\n\nhousing, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication,\n\nrecreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and access to public\n\nservices.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(3). Clearly, many of the “critical areas” in\n\nwhich Congress determined “discrimination” to exist apply to the states and come\n\nunder the purview of Title II. Normally, congressional findings are entitled to\n\nmuch deference. See Walters v. Nat’l Ass’n of Radiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305,\n\n330 n.12 (1985). As explained above, however, Congress’ determination of what\n\nconstitutes “discrimination” against the disabled differs from discrimination in the\n\nconstitutional sense. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 12101(5). This court’s duty is\n\ntherefore to determine “whether Congress identified a history and pattern of\n\nunconstitutional [] discrimination by the States against the disabled.” Garrett,\n\n121 S. Ct. at 964 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\nabrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity does not necessarily mean that the\nstatute is not a valid exercise of Congress’ power to enforce the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Because the Fourteenth Amendment applies to local government\nentities not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, the analysis of whether\nCongress has the power to enact legislation requires inquiry into constitutional\nviolations by these entities in addition to entities entitled to Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity.\n\n                                         -26-\n\f      There is some evidence in the congressional record that unconstitutional\n\ndiscrimination against the disabled exists in government “services, programs, or\n\nactivities.” See, e.g., 2 Staff of the House Comm. on Educ. & Labor, 101st\n\nCong., 2d Sess., Legislative History of Public Law 101-336: The Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act 1230 (Comm. Print 1990) [hereinafter Legislative History]\n\n(discussing neighborhood opposition to housing for the mentally disabled); see\n\nalso Alexander, 469 U.S. at 295 n.12 (discussing § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n\nof 1973 and stating that “well-cataloged instances of invidious discrimination\n\nagainst the handicapped do exist”). However, most of these occurrences involve\n\nlocal officials and not the states. 8 See, e.g., 3 Legislative History 1872\n\n(discussing invidious refusal by park commissioner to allow disabled person to\n\nswim in public pool). In any event, the vast majority of incidents discussed in the\n\nlegislative record involving government “services, programs, or activities” are\n\nrefusals by public entities to make accommodations for the disabled. See, e.g.,\n\nAmericans With Disabilities Act: Hearings on H.R. 2273 Before the Subcomm. on\n\nSurface Transp. of the Comm. on Public Works and Transp., 101st Cong. 204-09\n\n(1989) (statement of John Hudson, Social Work Coordinator at the National\n\n\n\n      8\n       In fact, by the time Congress enacted the ADA every state in the Union,\nincluding Colorado, had enacted legislation requiring some accommodations on\nbehalf of the disabled. See Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 964 n.5; Colo. Rev. Stat. § 9-5-\n101 to -112.\n\n                                         -27-\n\fRehabilitation Hospital in Washington, D.C.) (discussing lack of adequate public\n\ntransportation for the disabled in Montgomery County, Maryland). The\n\nidentification of only a few examples of unconstitutional discrimination against\n\nthe disabled confirms the notion that Title II’s primary focus was the failure by\n\npublic entities to make accommodations for the disabled. See Helen L. v.\n\nDiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 335 (3d Cir. 1995) (stating that “the ADA evolved from an\n\nattempt to remedy the effects of benign neglect resulting from the invisibility of\n\nthe disabled” and that “invidious animus . . . was not the focus of . . . the\n\nADA”(quotations omitted)); see also Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989:\n\nHearing on H.R. 2273 Before the Comm. on the Judiciary & the Subcomm. on\n\nCivil & Constitutional Rights of the Comm. on the Judiciary, 101st Cong. 162\n\n(1989) (statement of Laura D. Cooper, disabled attorney) (“It is my firm belief\n\nthat many, but not all[,] of the inaccessibility problems that I have encountered\n\nare not so much the result of hostility or willful discrimination; rather, they are\n\nthe result of benign neglect and a lack of understanding or concern about how\n\nparticular policies or practices affect the disabled patrons in our midst.”). The\n\nSupreme Court, in discussing § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, upon which\n\nTitle II of the ADA was based, 9 has stated that\n\n\n\n      See H.R. Rep. No. 101-485(II), at 84 (1990), reprinted in 1990\n      9\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 303; H.R. Rep. No. 101-485(III), at 49-50 (1990), reprinted in 1990\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 445.\n\n                                          -28-\n\f      [d]iscrimination against the handicapped was perceived by Congress\n      to be most often the product, not of invidious animus, but rather of\n      thoughtlessness and indifference—of benign neglect. . . . Federal\n      agencies and commentators on the plight of the handicapped\n      similarly have found that discrimination against the handicapped is\n      primarily the result of apathetic attitudes rather than affirmative\n      animus.\n\nAlexander, 469 U.S. at 295-96 (footnote omitted). This language is applicable to\n\nTitle II of the ADA. Apathetic attitudes and refusals to make accommodations do\n\nnot usually violate the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n      This court cannot conclude that Congress “identified a history and pattern”\n\nof unconstitutional discrimination by the states against the disabled. 10 Garrett,\n\n121 S. Ct. at 964. Nor can this court find in the caselaw “extensive litigation and\n\ndiscussion of the constitutional violations.” Id. at 968 (Kennedy, J., concurring).\n\nWithout this foundation, Title II cannot be considered preventive or remedial\n\nlegislation that is congruent and proportional to any constitutional violation.\n\nBased on the “minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination” against\n\nthe disabled, Title II’s accommodation requirement appears to be an attempt to\n\nprescribe a new federal standard for the treatment of the disabled rather than an\n\nattempt to combat unconstitutional discrimination. Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 965-66.\n\n\n\n      10\n        This court was also unable to identify a history and pattern of\nunconstitutional state conduct in The Report of the Task Force on the Rights and\nEmpowerment of Americans with Disabilities: From ADA to Empowerment\n(1990).\n\n                                         -29-\n\fIn this respect, Title II resembles the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which\n\nthe Supreme Court struck down in Flores. See 521 U.S. at 536; see also\n\nErickson, 207 F.3d at 951 (“What the RFRA did for religion, the ADA does for\n\ndisabilities.”). Thus, Title II is not a valid abrogation of the states’ Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity. 11\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\n      For the reasons stated above, Colorado is entitled to Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity from Plaintiffs’ suit and the district court erred in denying Colorado’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment. We therefore VACATE the order of the district\n\ncourt granting summary judgment for Plaintiffs and denying summary judgment\n\nfor Colorado and REMAND with instructions that summary judgment be entered\n\nfor Colorado.\n\n\n\n\n      11\n        This court expresses no opinion on the constitutional power of Congress\nto enact Title II of the ADA. Thus, Ex parte Young suits seeking prospective\ninjunctive relief and suits against entities not protected by the Eleventh\nAmendment are not prohibited by this opinion.\n\n                                          -30-\n\f",

INTRODUCTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs-Appellees brought a class action suit against Defendant-Appellant State of Colorado (\"Colorado\"). Plaintiffs claimed that the fee charged by Colorado for handicapped parking placards violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\") and implementing regulations. After stipulating to various facts, both parties moved for summary judgment. In its motion for summary judgment, Colorado argued that Plaintiffs' claims were barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The district court granted Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denied Colorado's motion for summary judgment. Colorado has appealed the district court's decision; jurisdiction to consider Colorado's appeal arises under 28 U.S.C.  1291. Because Colorado is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, this court vacates the order of the district court granting Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denying Colorado's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Colorado law, a \"person with a disability\" may apply for a special license plate or placard. See Colo. Rev. Stat.  42-3-121(2)(a). The license plate and the placard allow the disabled person to park in designated handicap parking spaces. See id.  42-4-1208(3)(a). The special license plates are supplied to the disabled at the same cost as standard license plates. See id.  42-3-121(2)(a)(I). In order to receive a placard, however, a fee must be paid. See id.  42-3-121(2)(d). The fee is not to exceed the actual cost of issuing the placard; at the time of appellate briefing the fee was $2.25. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs brought a class action suit against Colorado challenging the imposition of the placard fee. Plaintiffs claimed that the placard fee violated Title II of the ADA and the implementing regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice. Title II of the ADA provides that \"no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\" 42 U.S.C.  12132. The term \"public entity\" includes \"any State or local government\" and \"any department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government.\" Id.  12131(1). Plaintiffs also relied on 28 C.F.R.  35.130(f), a regulation promulgated by the Department of Justice for the purpose of implementing Title II of the ADA. See 28 C.F.R.  35.101. Section 35.130(f) provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A public entity may not place a surcharge on a particular individual with a disability or any group of individuals with disabilities to cover the costs of measures, such as the provision of auxiliary aids or program accessibility, that are required to provide that individual or group with the nondiscriminatory treatment required by the [ADA] or this part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs requested two forms of relief in their complaint: (1) a declaration that it is unlawful for Colorado to require payment for the parking placards and a subsequent injunction preventing Colorado from charging these fees in the future, and (2) reimbursement of previous fees paid by Plaintiffs for the placards after passage of the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Colorado was the only defendant named in the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its answer, Colorado claimed, inter alia, that it was entitled to immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. After stipulating to many relevant facts, both parties moved for summary judgment. Although Plaintiffs' complaint sought both injunctive relief and reimbursement for past fees paid, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment was only for declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cross motions for summary judgment were referred to a magistrate judge. The magistrate judge concluded that (1) the placard fee charged by Colorado violated Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations; (2) Colorado was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity; and (3) Title II of the ADA does not violate the Tenth Amendment. The magistrate judge thus recommended that Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment be granted, that Colorado's motion for summary judgment be denied, and that a schedule be set for certification of the plaintiff class claiming reimbursement of fees paid to Colorado for placards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge's recommendations over Colorado's objections. Colorado appealed to this court. After oral argument, this court formally abated the case following the Supreme Court's grant of certiorari in Florida Department of Corrections v. Dickson. See 528 U.S. 1132 (2000). The Dickson case settled, however, and this case was then reactivated. See Fla. Dep't of Corr. v. Dickson, 528 U.S. 1184 (2000). This court further delayed deciding this case, however, in order to await the outcome of Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett and to allow the parties and the United States as intervenor to file supplemental briefs; the Supreme Court decided Garrett on February 21, 2001. See 121 S. Ct. 955 (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Colorado argues that it is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity from Plaintiffs' suit. Under circuit precedent, a defendant's assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity calls into question the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court. See Martin v. Kansas, 190 F.3d 1120, 1126 (10th Cir. 1999), overruled on other grounds by Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 967-68. But see Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene, 521 U.S. 261, 267 (1997) (stating that the Eleventh Amendment \"enacts a sovereign immunity from suit, rather than a nonwaivable limit on the Federal Judiciary's subject-matter jurisdiction\"); Cisneros v. Wilson, 226 F.3d 1113, 1136, 1137 (10th Cir. 2000) (Kelly, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (arguing that \"[w]ere the Eleventh Amendment truly jurisdictional, a court would not be free to ignore it\" and stating that the court should not have reached the Eleventh Amendment issue), majority holding overruled on other grounds by Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 955. Questions regarding jurisdiction must generally be answered before turning to the merits of a case. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 93-102 (1998) (rejecting the doctrine of hypothetical jurisdiction). The Supreme Court has held that the issue of whether a statute provides for suits against the states may be addressed before examining a defendant's claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Vt. Agency of Natural Res. v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 778-79 (2000). Colorado, however, concedes that Title II of the ADA contemplates suits by private individual against the states. Thus, Vermont Agency is not applicable to this case and this court must resolve whether Colorado is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity before it can address whether Plaintiffs have stated a valid claim under Title II and its implementing regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Amendment provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Amendment has been understood as \"evidencing and exemplifying\" a concept of sovereign immunity implicit in the Constitution broader than the explicit language of the amendment might suggest. Coeur d'Alene, 521 U.S. at 267-68; see also Blatchford v. Native Vill. of Noatak, 501 U.S. 775, 779 (1991). Thus, although the explicit language of the Eleventh Amendment applies only to suits in federal court against a state by citizens of another state, immunity has been extended to suits in federal court by citizens against their own state, such as the present suit. See Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 962; Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 15-21 (1890); cf. Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 754 (1999) (holding that states possess sovereign immunity from federal suits in state courts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certain exceptions to Eleventh Amendment immunity have been recognized. A state can waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity and consent to be sued. See Coeur d'Alene, 521 U.S. at 267. There has been no suggestion in this case, however, that Colorado consented to suit under Title II of the ADA. In addition, the Court has often found federal jurisdiction in suits against state officials seeking prospective injunctive relief. See Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 73 (1996). These suits are referred to as Ex parte Young suits, based on the Supreme Court case first recognizing this exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159-60 (1908). Because no state official has been named as a defendant in this suit, however, the Ex parte Young exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity is not appropriate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under certain circumstances Congress may abrogate a state's Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 55. First, Congress must \"unequivocally express[] its intent to abrogate the immunity.\"Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 68 (1985). Congress has clearly expressed its intent to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity in the ADA. See 42 U.S.C.  12202. Second, Congress must abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity pursuant to a \"constitutional provision granting Congress the power to abrogate.\" Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 59. After Seminole Tribe, only Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment stands as a recognized source of power by which Congress can abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity. See id. at 59-66 (overruling Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1 (1989), which held that Congress can abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Clause). Congress relied on Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment in enacting the ADA. See 42 U.S.C.  12101(b)(4). The mere recitation by Congress of Section Five as a basis for the ADA does not, however, end the inquiry; it is a function of the judicial branch to determine whether Congress was within its Section Five authority to abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity by enacting Title II. See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 527-29 (1997); Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176-80 (1803).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both this court and the Supreme Court have recently considered whether the ADA is a valid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity. In Martin v. Kansas, this court considered a former corrections officer's claims against the State of Kansas brought under Title I of the ADA. See 190 F.3d at 1123-25, 1129. Title I of the ADA prohibits certain employers, including the states, from \"discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual with a disability\" in matters related to employment. 42 U.S.C.  12112(a); see also 42 U.S.C.  12111(2), (5). In Martin, this court concluded that \"the ADA was a permissible exercise of Congress' Section 5 enforcement powers\" and thus validly abrogated Kansas' Eleventh Amendment immunity. 190 F.3d at 1128. It is not entirely clear from the opinion, however, whether the holding that the ADA was a valid abrogation of the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity applied to all suits brought under the ADA or solely to Title I suits such as the one brought in Martin. Compare Martin, 190 F.3d at 1125-26 (describing ADA in terms of the duties imposed under Title I in matters of employment), with Johnson v. Oklahoma, Nos. 99-6322, 99-6427, 2000 WL 1114194, at *1 (10th Cir. Aug. 7, 2000) (unpublished disposition) (suggesting Martin's holding that the ADA validly abrogated the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity applied to a claim brought under Title II of the ADA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court again considered a claim brought under Title I of the ADA in Cisneros v. Wilson. See 226 F.3d at 1115. In Cisneros, the court considered whether Martin's holding that the ADA abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity was still good law in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, 528 U.S. 62 (2000). See Cisneros, 226 F.3d at 1118. In Kimel, the Supreme Court held that Congress did not validly abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity in passing the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C.  621-634. See 528 U.S. at 82-83. This court concluded in Cisneros that nothing in Kimel required the court to \"revise the conclusions expressed\" in Martin and thus confirmed the viability of Martin's conclusion that the ADA validly abrogated the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity. 226 F.3d at 1128. Because both Cisneros and Martin were Title I cases, however, it was not necessary for the Cisneros court to determine whether Martin applied to the entire ADA or just Title I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Garrett, the Supreme Court held that Title I of the ADA was not a valid abrogation of the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity. See 121 S. Ct. at 967-68. The Court noted that the legislative record of the ADA did not identify a pattern of unconstitutional discrimination by the states and that even if such a record existed \"the rights and remedies created by the ADA against the States would raise the same sort of concerns as to congruence and proportionality as were found in City of Boerne.\" Id. at 966, 965. The Court, however, explicitly limited its ruling to Title I of the ADA and stated that it was \"not disposed to decide [in Garrett] the constitutional issue whether Title II, which has somewhat different remedial provisions from Title I, is appropriate legislation under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Id. at 960 n.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop of cases, this court must determine whether the validity of Congress' attempt through Title II to abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity is controlled by precedent. Garrett, although clearly instrumental in informing this court's analysis, expressly disavows any holding on Title II of the ADA. See id. As stated above, it is not clear whether the decision in Martin was intended to apply to the entire ADA or only Title I.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> It is not necessary, however, for this court to resolve that because Garrett clarifies that when evaluating a claim under the ADA the abrogation analysis should be conducted on each specific title, not on the statute as a whole. The Supreme Court held in Garrett that Title I of the ADA was not a valid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity; it did not render a decision as to the entire ADA. See id. Thus, even if Martin was a holding as to the entire ADA, Garrett demonstrates that it was error to conduct the abrogation analysis at that level of generality.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See Currier v. Doran, 242 F.3d 905, 912 (10th Cir. 2001) (stating that a panel is not bound by a prior panel opinion when there is a superseding Supreme Court decision). Therefore, this court now writes on a clean slate in addressing whether Title II of the ADA is a valid abrogation of the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether there has been an abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity is generally controlled by the \"now familiar principles\" for determining whether the statute in question was validly passed pursuant to Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment. Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 963. Section Five gives Congress the power to enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment by enacting \"appropriate legislation.\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV,  5; see also Flores, 521 U.S. at 536. This power \"includes the authority both to remedy and to deter violation of rights guaranteed [by the Fourteenth Amendment] by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment's text.\" Kimel, 528 U.S. at 81. When Congress has enacted legislation that exceeds the substantive guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment, however, the legislation must exhibit \"congruence and proportionality between the [constitutional] injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.\" Flores, 521 U.S. at 520. In conducting the congruent and proportional analysis, courts look to the Congressional record to determine \"whether Congress identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional [conduct] by the States.\" Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 964.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether Title II is a valid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity, it is first important to delineate with some care what conduct Title II prohibits or, perhaps more appropriately in this case, what conduct Title II requires. Title II states that \"no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\" 42 U.S.C.  12132.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A cursory reading of the statutory language can leave the impression that Title II simply prohibits intentional exclusion against the disabled solely because of their status as \"disabled.\" A more thorough review, however, reveals that, rather than preventing public entities from treating the disabled differently than the nondisabled, Title II requires that public entities make certain accommodations for the disabled in order to ensure their access to government programs. See Bonnie Poitras Tucker, The ADA's Revolving Door: Inherent Flaws in the Civil Rights Paradigm, 62 Ohio St. L.J. 335, 344 (2001) (stating that \"[s]imple equal treatment does not result in [the disabled's] inclusion into mainstream society\" and that \"[t]he ADA recognizes this need for different treatment\"). That Title II of the ADA requires accommodations by public entities is evident from other portions of the statute, the regulations implementing Title II, and caselaw interpreting the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The findings section of the ADA (applicable to all titles of the Act) states that individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including outright intentional exclusion, the discriminatory effects of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers, overprotective rules and policies, failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices, exclusionary qualification standards and criteria, segregation, and relegation to lesser services, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other opportunities</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C.  12101(5) (emphasis added). The definition of a \"qualified individual with a disability\" also illustrates the affirmative duty Title II imposes on public entities:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"qualified individual with a disability\" means an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.  12131(2) (emphasis added). In addition, Part B of Title II delineates specific examples of what constitutes \"discrimination\" by public entities in their public transportation services. See id.  12141-12165. This section of the statute requires, inter alia, that all new public transportation vehicles be accessible to the disabled and that any public entity which operates a fixed route transportation system provide comparable services for use by the disabled. See id.  12142-12144.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, from the language of the statute it is clear Title II requires public entities to make accommodations for the disabled. The regulations issued by the Department of Justice implementing Title II confirm this reading of the statute. Cf. Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 304-05 &amp; n.24 (1985) (using regulations as a source of guidance in interpreting a statute). One regulation provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a] public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 C.F.R.  35.130(b)(7). The regulation on which Plaintiffs in this case have based their claim also demonstrates that public entities will be required to take certain \"measures\" in order to comply with Title II. Id.  35.130(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, many courts have recognized that Title II requires public entities to make accommodations for the disabled. See, e.g., Popovich v. Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, 227 F.3d 627, 638 (6th Cir. 2000) (stating that Title II \"imposes an affirmative obligation on public entities to accommodate disabled individuals\"), rehearing en banc granted, opinion vacated (Dec. 12, 2000); Alsbrook v. City of Maumelle, 184 F.3d 999, 1009 (8th Cir. 1999) (en banc). Similarly, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\" 504\"), which uses language almost identical to Title II in describing a violation by covered entities,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> has been interpreted to require \"reasonable accommodations\" to covered programs or services. See Sch. Bd. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287 n.17 (1987) (stating that \"reasonable accommodations\" by covered entities are required under  504); Alexander, 469 U.S. at 299-301 (assuming without deciding that  504 provides for at least some disparate impact claims and that \"reasonable accommodations . . . may have to be made\"); Wynne v. Tufts Univ. Sch. of Med., 932 F.2d 19, 25 (1st Cir. 1991) (en banc). Thus, the duty to accommodate contained in Title II is well settled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears, however, that the duty to accommodate under  12132 is not boundless. Regulations issued by the Department of Justice speak of \"reasonable modifications\" that do not \"fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.\" 28 C.F.R.  35.130(b)(7); see also 42 U.S.C.  12131(2) (defining \"qualified individual with a disability\" as an individual \"who, with or without reasonable modifications . . ., meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services\" (emphasis added)). While expressly avoiding any ruling on the validity of  35.130(b)(7), the Supreme Court has interpreted the regulation to allow inquiry into whether an accommodation is \"reasonable\" in light of, inter alia, \"the resources available to the State.\" Olmstead v. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 607, 592, 603-07 (1999). It is not necessary for purposes of this case to determine exactly when a state might refuse an accommodation because it is \"unreasonable\" or because it \"fundamentally alter[s] the nature of the service, program, or activity\"; this court will assume that such a defense does exist in certain circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next step in determining whether Title II is a valid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity \"is to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue.\" Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 963. Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment gives Congress the power to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. Appellees claim that Title II enforces both the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause. See U.S. Const. amend. XIV,  1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fundamental guarantee of the Equal Protection Clause is that \"all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\" City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985). Thus, a typical claim brought under the Equal Protection Clause challenges a classification or distinction made by the state. The reviewing court then determines the seriousness with which the Equal Protection Clause treats the particular classification and then applies the appropriate degree of judicial scrutiny to the state justifications for making the distinction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court case of Cleburne follows this pattern. In Cleburne, the Court considered an equal protection challenge to a city ordinance that required a special use permit for construction of a group home for the mentally disabled. See id. at 435-37. The Court determined that \"mental retardation\" is not a quasi-suspect class and that state legislation making classifications based on mental retardation need only be rationally related to a legitimate city interest. See id. at 442-46. Thus, a state violates the Equal Protection Clause if it makes distinctions between the disabled and nondisabled without a rational justification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Of course, \"a bare [] desire to harm a politically unpopular group\" is not a legitimate state interest. See United States Dep't of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973). When a state acts with invidious intent there is an Equal Protection violation even if no facial distinction has been made and the state action merely has a disparate impact on the disabled. See Lee v. City of L.A., 250 F.3d 668, 686-88 (9th Cir. 2001); Erickson v. Bd. of Governors of State Colls. &amp; Univs. for Northeastern Ill. Univ., 207 F.3d 945, 950 (7th Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to the Equal Protection Clause prohibition on invidious discrimination against the disabled and irrational distinctions between the disabled and the nondisabled, Title II requires public entities to recognize the unique position of the disabled and to make favorable accommodations on their behalf. Thus, while the basic premise of the Equal Protection Clause is that similarly situated citizens should be treated alike, the mandate of the ADA is that those who are not similarly situated should be treated differently. The Equal Protection Clause does not generally require accommodations on behalf of the disabled by the states. See Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 964 (\"If special accommodations for the disabled are to be required, they have to come from positive law and not through the Equal Protection Clause.\"); Erickson, 207 F.3d at 951 (\"[N]o one believes that the Equal Protection Clause establishes the disparate-impact and mandatory-accommodation rules found in the ADA.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees correctly note that a fundamental interest in voting inheres in the Equal Protection Clause. See Harper v. Va. Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 665 (1966) (\"[O]nce the franchise is granted to the electorate, lines may not be drawn which are inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"). Thus, state measures which have the effect of denying or diluting a citizen's vote must be justified with a compelling state interest. See id. at 670 (striking down state poll tax); Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 568-69 (1964) (establishing the one person-one vote standard). It is not clear whether the equal protection interest in voting requires states to make accommodations for the disabled in order to ensure their ability to vote. See Selph v. Council of L.A., 390 F. Supp. 58, 61 (C.D.Cal. 1975) (holding that Equal Protection Clause does not require city to make polling places accessible to the disabled when absentee voting is available); Whalen v. Heimann, 373 F. Supp. 353, 357 (D. Conn. 1974) (finding no equal protection violation in failing to provide absentee ballots to those who are physically unable to vote and stating that \"[a] physically incapacitated voter has no more basis to challenge a voting requirement of personal appearance than a blind voter can complain that the ballot is not printed in braille\" and that it is not \"the province of courts to weigh the relative ease or difficulty with which the state could accommodate its voting procedures to meet the needs of various handicapped voters\"); cf. McDonald v. Bd of Election Comm'rs, 394 U.S. 802, 806-11 &amp; n.6 (1969) (holding that Illinois did not violate the Equal Protection Clause by refusing to give unsentenced inmates an absentee ballot, when there was no record evidence that inmates would be prevented from voting on election day). For purposes of this case only, this court assumes without deciding that the Equal Protection Clause requires states and local entities either to make polling locations accessible to the disabled or to allow the disabled to vote by absentee ballot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees also rely on the Due Process Clause. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has been interpreted to incorporate most of the guarantees found in the Bill of Rights; these incorporated provisions thus apply to the states as well as the federal government See Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 148 (1968). Some of the incorporated guarantees of the first ten amendments require states, on certain occasions, to make accommodations for the disabled. For instance, a prison is required to provide the disabled with accessible toilets in order to comply with the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment contained in the Eighth Amendment. See LaFaut v. Smith, 834 F.2d 389, 389-95 (4th Cir. 1987) (Powell, A.J.). In at least some instances, the failure of states to provide accessible courtrooms could conceivably be a violation of due process. See Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 819 n.15 (1975) (\"[A]n accused has a right to be present at all stages of the trial where his absence might frustrate the fairness of the proceedings.\"); Helminski v. Ayerst Labs., 766 F.2d 208, 215 (6th Cir. 1985) (holding that a civil litigant's \"physical condition alone does not warrant his exclusion from the courtroom during any portion of the proceedings\"). These examples do not exhaust the categories of rights protected by a requirement for some level of accommodation under the Due Process Clause. See, e.g., Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 309-10, 322 (1982) (holding that mentally disabled individual who had been involuntarily committed to a state institution was entitled by Due Process Clause to \"minimally adequate training\"). For purposes of this case, however, it is sufficient to note that the Due Process Clause does not contain the general mandate found in Title II, which requires accommodations by public entities in all of its \"services, programs, or activities.\" 42 U.S.C.  12132.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, states can violate the Fourteenth Amendment rights of the disabled in three different ways. First, facial distinctions between the disabled and nondisabled are unconstitutional unless rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Second, invidious state action against the disabled is unconstitutional, even if facially neutral toward the disabled (such as neutral statutory language). Finally, in certain limited circumstances such as those involving voting rights and prison conditions, states are required to make at least some accommodations for the disabled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having explored the Fourteenth Amendment's protections of the disabled, this court next \"examine[s] whether Congress identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional [conduct] by the States against the disabled.\" Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 964. In conducting this inquiry, only constitutional violations committed by beneficiaries of the Eleventh Amendment are considered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> See id. at 965.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress held thirteen hearings and created a special task force to assess the need for the ADA. See Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 969-70 (Breyer, J., dissenting). As a result of these inquiries, Congress determined that \"discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as employment, housing, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and access to public services.\" 42 U.S.C.  12101(a)(3). Clearly, many of the \"critical areas\" in which Congress determined \"discrimination\" to exist apply to the states and come under the purview of Title II. Normally, Congressional findings are entitled to much deference. See Walters v. Nat'l Ass'n of Radiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305, 330 n.12 (1985). As explained above, however, Congress' determination of what constitutes \"discrimination\" against the disabled differs from discrimination in the constitutional sense. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C.  12101(5). This court's duty is therefore to determine \"whether Congress identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional [] discrimination by the States against the disabled.\" Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 964 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some evidence in the congressional record that unconstitutional discrimination against the disabled exists in government \"services, programs, or activities.\" See, e.g., 2 Staff of the House Comm. on Educ. &amp; Labor, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., Legislative History of Public Law 101-336: The Americans with Disabilities Act 1230 (Comm. Print 1990) [hereinafter Legislative History] (discussing neighborhood opposition to housing for the mentally disabled); see also Alexander, 469 U.S. at 295 n.12 (discussing  504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and stating that \"well-cataloged instances of invidious discrimination against the handicapped do exist\"). However, most of these occurrences involve local officials and not the states.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> See, e.g., 3 Legislative History 1872 (discussing invidious refusal by park commissioner to allow disabled person to swim in public pool). In any event, the vast majority of incidents discussed in the legislative record involving government \"services, programs, or activities\" are refusals by public entities to make accommodations for the disabled. See, e.g., Americans With Disabilities Act: Hearings on H.R. 2273 Before the Subcomm. on Surface Transp. of the Comm. on Public Works and Transp., 101st Cong. 204-09 (1989) (statement of John Hudson, Social Work Coordinator at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington, D.C.) (discussing lack of adequate public transportation for the disabled in Montgomery County, Maryland). The absence of numerous examples of unconstitutional discrimination against the disabled confirms the notion that Title II's primary focus was the failure by public entities to make accommodations for the disabled. See Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 335 (3d Cir. 1995) (stating that \"the ADA evolved from an attempt to remedy the effects of benign neglect resulting from the invisibility of the disabled\" and that \"invidious animus . . . was not the focus of . . . the ADA\"(quotations omitted)); see also Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989: Hearing on H.R. 2273 Before the Comm. on the Judiciary &amp; the Subcomm. on Civil &amp; Constitutional Rights of the Comm. on the Judiciary, 101st Cong. 162 (1989) (statement of Laura D. Cooper, disabled attorney) (\"It is my firm belief that many, but not all[,] of the inaccessibility problems that I have encountered are not so much the result of hostility or willful discrimination; rather, they are the result of benign neglect and a lack of understanding or concern about how particular policies or practices affect the disabled patrons in our midst.\"). The Supreme Court, in discussing  504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, upon which Title II of the ADA was based<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>, has stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[d]iscrimination against the handicapped was perceived by Congress to be most often the product, not of invidious animus, but rather of thoughtlessness and indifference--of benign neglect. . . . Federal agencies and commentators on the plight of the handicapped similarly have found that discrimination against the handicapped is primarily the result of apathetic attitudes rather than affirmative animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alexander, 469 U.S. at 295-96 (footnote omitted). This language is applicable to Title II of the ADA. Apathetic attitudes and refusals to make accommodations do not usually violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court cannot conclude that Congress \"identified a history and pattern\" of unconstitutional discrimination by the states against the disabled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 964. Nor can this court find in the caselaw \"extensive litigation and discussion of the constitutional violations.\" Id. at 968 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Without this foundation, Title II cannot be considered preventive or remedial legislation that is congruent and proportional to any constitutional violation. Without numerous documented occurrences of unconstitutional state discrimination against the disabled, Title II's accommodation requirement appears to be an attempt to prescribe a new federal standard for the treatment of the disabled rather than an attempt to combat unconstitutional discrimination. In this respect, Title II resembles RFRA, which the Supreme Court struck down in Flores. See 521 U.S. 507; see also Erickson, 207 F.3d at 951 (\"What the RFRA did for religion, the ADA does for disabilities.\"). Thus, Title II is not a valid abrogation of the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, Colorado is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity from Plaintiffs' suit and the district court erred in denying Colorado's motion for summary judgment.

This motion is obviously an attempt to make prospective injunctive relief possible through an Ex parte Young suit. It appears that, if this court were inclined to grant the motion, it would have the power to do so. See Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U.S. 826, 833 (1989) (concluding that appellate courts do have the power to dismiss a dispensable party whose presence spoils statutory diversity jurisdiction); Balgowan v. New Jersey, 115 F.3d 214, 216-17 (3rd Cir. 1997) (granting motion to amend the complaint to add a state official as a defendant and to include a claim for prospective declaratory and injunctive relief, thus making Ex parte Young suit possible). Nevertheless, there are considerations weighing against Plaintiffs' motion.</p>\n        <p>Allowing Plaintiffs to amend their complaint would substantially alter the relevant legal issues to be decided in this case. Under the current complaint, the initial question that must be answered by this court is whether Colorado is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. The main consideration in this analysis is whether Congress validly abrogated Colorado's Eleventh Amendment immunity in enacting Title II of the ADA. If Plaintiffs' motion to amend is granted, however, this court could address the district court's award of the prospective injunctive relief requested in Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment without regard to the Eleventh Amendment immunity question. See Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159-60 (1908). In addition, after Plaintiffs filed their motion to amend, Colorado asserted a challenge to Congress' ability to pass Title II of the ADA pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Clause. If Plaintiffs' motion to amend was granted, fairness would require this court to allow Defendants to press the Commerce Clause argument; more briefing and perhaps additional oral argument would then be necessary to properly evaluate the Commerce Clause issue. Allowing the amendment would wholly alter the complexion of this case.</p>\n        <p>Furthermore, unlike in Balgowan, there has been no reversal of a prior Supreme Court case on which Plaintiffs' relied in drafting their complaint. In Balgowan, the plaintiffs had brought a claim against the New Jersey Department of Transportation seeking monetary relief for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (\"FLSA\"), 29 U.S.C.  201-219 (1978). See 115 F.3d at 216. Under Supreme Court precedent at the time the plaintiffs in Balgowan filed suit, it appeared that the FLSA was a valid exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause power and that Congress could abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity through legislation enacted pursuant to the Commerce Clause. See Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1, 19-20 (1989); Garcia v. San Antonio Metro. Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528, 555-56 (1985). In Seminole Tribe v. Florida, which was decided after the plaintiffs in Balgowan filed suit, the Supreme Court reversed Union Gas and held that Congress cannot abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity by means of its Commerce Clause power. See 517 U.S. 44, 66 (1996). Thus, the Third Circuit allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, partly because of the plaintiffs' reliance on Union Gas. See Balgowan, 115 F.3d at 217. Plaintiffs in this case, however, have identified no similar equitable consideration justifying their eleventh-hour request to amend their complaint.</p>\n        <p>In Newman-Green the Supreme Court emphasized that the power of appellate courts to dismiss a nondiverse party \"should be exercised sparingly.\" 490 U.S. at 837. This admonition applies to Plaintiffs' motion to add a party, which has neither alleged or shown that denial of the motion results in an advantage lost by the Plaintiffs or disadvantage incurred. For the above-stated reasons, Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Amend to Add Party Defendant is denied.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Whatever the scope of Martin, clearly Garrett now controls claims brought pursuant to Title I.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> While some courts have addressed the Eleventh Amendment question by broadly considering the entire ADA, see Coolbaugh v. Louisiana, 136 F.3d 430, 437-38 (5th Cir. 1998), other courts have gone in the opposite direction and considered whether the specific regulation under which the plaintiff makes a claim is a valid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Neinast v. Texas, 217 F.3d 275, 28082 (5th Cir. 2000) (stating that 28 C.F.R.  35.130(f) exceeds Congress' Section Five power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment), cert denied, 121 S. Ct. 1188 (2001); Brown v. N.C. Div. of Motor Vehicles, 166 F.3d 698, 701, 703-04 (4th Cir. 1999) (same), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 1186 (2001). This court agrees with the Ninth Circuit in rejecting a specific \"piecemeal analysis\" of whether each regulation passed pursuant to Title II is a valid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Dare v. California, 191 F.3d 1167, 1176 n.7 (9th Cir. 1999), cert denied, 121 S. Ct. 1187 (2001); see also Alsbrook v. City of Maumelle, 184 F.3d 999, 1010 (8th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (holding that Title II of the ADA is not a valid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity). The analysis adopted by the Supreme Court in cases such as Garrett addresses Congress' ability to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity by enacting legislation pursuant to its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. The power of various agencies to enact regulations implementing legislation passed by Congress is an entirely different question, one that is generally approached with deference by the courts. See Olmstead v. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 597 (1999) (\"Because the Department [of Justice] is the agency directed by Congress to issue regulations implementing Title II, its views warrant respect. We need not inquire whether the degree of deference described in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), is in order; [i]t is enough to observe that the well-reasoned views of the agencies implementing a statute constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.\" (quotations and citation omitted)). In this court's view, it is simply inappropriate to apply the abrogation analysis to agency regulations. Thus, as the Supreme Court did with Title I in Garrett, this court will conduct the abrogation analysis by considering Title II in its entirety.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Compare 42 U.S.C.  12132, with 29 U.S.C.  794(a).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Although Cleburne dealt only with classifications based on mental retardation, the Court's decision in Garrett confirms that classifications based on disabilities, whether mental or otherwise, are subject only to rational basis review.

As a result of the directive in Garrett that only congressional findings of constitutional violations by beneficiaries of the Eleventh Amendment be considered, a determination that a statute is not a valid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity does not necessarily mean that the statute is not a valid exercise of Congress' power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the Fourteenth Amendment applies to local government entities not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, the analysis of whether Congress has the power to enact legislation requires inquiry into constitutional violations by these entities in addition to entities entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In fact, by the time Congress enacted the ADA every state in the Union, including Colorado, had enacted legislation requiring some accommodations on behalf of the disabled.

INTRODUCTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs-Appellees brought a class action suit against Defendant-Appellant State of Colorado (\"Colorado\"). Plaintiffs claimed that the fee charged by Colorado for handicapped parking placards violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\") and implementing regulations. After stipulating to various facts, both parties moved for summary judgment. In its motion for summary judgment, Colorado argued that Plaintiffs' claims were barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The district court granted Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denied Colorado's motion for summary judgment. Colorado has appealed the district court's decision; jurisdiction to consider Colorado's appeal arises under 28 U.S.C.  1291. Because Colorado is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, this court vacates the order of the district court granting Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denying Colorado's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Colorado law, a \"person with a disability\" may apply for a special license plate or placard. See Colo. Rev. Stat.  42-3-121(2)(a). The license plate and the placard allow the disabled person to park in designated handicap parking spaces. See id.  42-4-1208(3)(a). The special license plates are supplied to the disabled at the same cost as standard license plates. See id.  42-3-121(2)(a)(I). In order to receive a placard, however, a fee must be paid. See id.  42-3-121(2)(d). The fee is not to exceed the actual cost of issuing the placard; at the time of appellate briefing the fee was $2.25. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs brought a class action suit against Colorado challenging the imposition of the placard fee. Plaintiffs claimed that the placard fee violated Title II of the ADA and the implementing regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice. Title II of the ADA provides that \"no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\" 42 U.S.C.  12132. The term \"public entity\" includes \"any State or local government\" and \"any department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government.\" Id.  12131(1). Plaintiffs also relied on 28 C.F.R.  35.130(f), a regulation promulgated by the Department of Justice for the purpose of implementing Title II of the ADA. See 28 C.F.R.  35.101. Section 35.130(f) provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A public entity may not place a surcharge on a particular individual with a disability or any group of individuals with disabilities to cover the costs of measures, such as the provision of auxiliary aids or program accessibility, that are required to provide that individual or group with the nondiscriminatory treatment required by the [ADA] or this part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs requested two forms of relief in their complaint: (1) a declaration that it is unlawful for Colorado to require payment for the parking placards and a subsequent injunction preventing Colorado from charging these fees in the future, and (2) reimbursement of previous fees paid by Plaintiffs for the placards after passage of the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Colorado was the only defendant named in the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its answer, Colorado claimed, inter alia, that it was entitled to immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. After stipulating to many relevant facts, both parties moved for summary judgment. Although Plaintiffs' complaint sought both injunctive relief and reimbursement for past fees paid, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment was only for declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cross motions for summary judgment were referred to a magistrate judge. The magistrate judge concluded that (1) the placard fee charged by Colorado violated Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations; (2) Colorado was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity; and (3) Title II of the ADA does not violate the Tenth Amendment. The magistrate judge thus recommended that Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment be granted, that Colorado's motion for summary judgment be denied, and that a schedule be set for certification of the plaintiff class claiming reimbursement of fees paid to Colorado for placards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge's recommendations over Colorado's objections. Colorado appealed to this court. After oral argument, this court formally abated the case following the Supreme Court's grant of certiorari in Florida Department of Corrections v. Dickson. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1132</span></span> (2000). The Dickson case settled, however, and this case was then reactivated. See Fla. Dep't of Corr. v. Dickson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></span> (2000). This court further delayed deciding this case, however, in order to await the outcome of Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett and to allow the parties and the United States as intervenor to file supplemental briefs; the Supreme Court decided Garrett on February 21, 2001. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118407\"><a href=\"/opinion/118407/board-of-trustees-of-univ-of-ala-v-garrett/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Colorado argues that it is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity from Plaintiffs' suit. Under circuit precedent, a defendant's assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity calls into question the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court. See Martin v. Kansas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158506\"><a href=\"/opinion/158506/martin-v-state-of-kansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1120</span></a></span>, 1126 (10th Cir. 1999), overruled on other grounds by Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 967-68. But see Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118134\"><a href=\"/opinion/118134/idaho-v-coeur-dalene-tribe-of-idaho/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span>, 267 (1997) (stating that the Eleventh Amendment \"enacts a sovereign immunity from suit, rather than a nonwaivable limit on the Federal Judiciary's subject-matter jurisdiction\"); Cisneros v. Wilson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"160161\"><a href=\"/opinion/160161/cisneros-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></a></span>, 1136, 1137 (10th Cir. 2000) (Kelly, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (arguing that \"[w]ere the Eleventh Amendment truly jurisdictional, a court would not be free to ignore it\" and stating that the court should not have reached the Eleventh Amendment issue), majority holding overruled on other grounds by Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 955. Questions regarding jurisdiction must generally be answered before turning to the merits of a case. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620886\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620886/steel-co-v-citizens-for-better-environment/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 93-102 (1998) (rejecting the doctrine of hypothetical jurisdiction). The Supreme Court has held that the issue of whether a statute provides for suits against the states may be addressed before examining a defendant's claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Vt. Agency of Natural Res. v. United States ex rel. Stevens, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118368\"><a href=\"/opinion/118368/vermont-agency-of-natural-resources-v-united-states-ex-rel-stevens/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 778-79 (2000). Colorado, however, concedes that Title II of the ADA contemplates suits by private individual against the states. Thus, Vermont Agency is not applicable to this case and this court must resolve whether Colorado is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity before it can address whether Plaintiffs have stated a valid claim under Title II and its implementing regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Amendment provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Amendment has been understood as \"evidencing and exemplifying\" a concept of sovereign immunity implicit in the Constitution broader than the explicit language of the amendment might suggest. Coeur d'Alene, 521 U.S. at 267-68; see also Blatchford v. Native Vill. of Noatak, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112641\"><a href=\"/opinion/112641/blatchford-v-native-village-of-noatak/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>, 779 (1991). Thus, although the explicit language of the Eleventh Amendment applies only to suits in federal court against a state by citizens of another state, immunity has been extended to suits in federal court by citizens against their own state, such as the present suit. See Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 962; Hans v. Louisiana, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92702\"><a href=\"/opinion/92702/hans-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 15-21 (1890); cf. Alden v. Maine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118318\"><a href=\"/opinion/118318/alden-v-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 754 (1999) (holding that states possess sovereign immunity from federal suits in state courts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certain exceptions to Eleventh Amendment immunity have been recognized. A state can waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity and consent to be sued. See Coeur d'Alene, 521 U.S. at 267. There has been no suggestion in this case, however, that Colorado consented to suit under Title II of the ADA. In addition, the Court has often found federal jurisdiction in suits against state officials seeking prospective injunctive relief. See Seminole Tribe v. Florida, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118011\"><a href=\"/opinion/118011/seminole-tribe-of-fla-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 73 (1996). These suits are referred to as Ex parte Young suits, based on the Supreme Court case first recognizing this exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Ex parte Young, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96819\"><a href=\"/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, 159-60 (1908). Because no state official has been named as a defendant in this suit, however, the Ex parte Young exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity is not appropriate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under certain circumstances Congress may abrogate a state's Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 55. First, Congress must \"unequivocally express[] its intent to abrogate the immunity.\"Green v. Mansour, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></span>, 68 (1985). Congress has clearly expressed its intent to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity in the ADA. See 42 U.S.C.  12202. Second, Congress must abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity pursuant to a \"constitutional provision granting Congress the power to abrogate.\" Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 59. After Seminole Tribe, only Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment stands as a recognized source of power by which Congress can abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity. See id. at 59-66 (overruling Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112291\"><a href=\"/opinion/112291/pennsylvania-v-union-gas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1989), which held that Congress can abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Clause). Congress relied on Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment in enacting the ADA. See 42 U.S.C.  12101(b)(4). The mere recitation by Congress of Section Five as a basis for the ADA does not, however, end the inquiry; it is a function of the judicial branch to determine whether Congress was within its Section Five authority to abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity by enacting Title II. See City of Boerne v. Flores, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118140\"><a href=\"/opinion/118140/city-of-boerne-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 527-29 (1997); Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176-80 (1803).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both this court and the Supreme Court have recently considered whether the ADA is a valid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity. In Martin v. Kansas, this court considered a former corrections officer's claims against the State of Kansas brought under Title I of the ADA. See 190 F.3d at 1123-25, 1129. Title I of the ADA prohibits certain employers, including the states, from \"discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual with a disability\" in matters related to employment. 42 U.S.C.  12112(a); see also 42 U.S.C.  12111(2), (5). In Martin, this court concluded that \"the ADA was a permissible exercise of Congress' Section 5 enforcement powers\" and thus validly abrogated Kansas' Eleventh Amendment immunity. 190 F.3d at 1128. It is not entirely clear from the opinion, however, whether the holding that the ADA was a valid abrogation of the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity applied to all suits brought under the ADA or solely to Title I suits such as the one brought in Martin. Compare Martin, 190 F.3d at 1125-26 (describing ADA in terms of the duties imposed under Title I in matters of employment), with Johnson v. Oklahoma, Nos. 99-6322, 99-6427, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1114194</span></span>, at *1 (10th Cir. Aug. 7, 2000) (unpublished disposition) (suggesting Martin's holding that the ADA validly abrogated the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity applied to a claim brought under Title II of the ADA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court again considered a claim brought under Title I of the ADA in Cisneros v. Wilson. See 226 F.3d at 1115. In Cisneros, the court considered whether Martin's holding that the ADA abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity was still good law in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118323\"><a href=\"/opinion/118323/kimel-v-florida-bd-of-regents/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span> (2000). See Cisneros, 226 F.3d at 1118. In Kimel, the Supreme Court held that Congress did not validly abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity in passing the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C.  621-634. See 528 U.S. at 82-83. This court concluded in Cisneros that nothing in Kimel required the court to \"revise the conclusions expressed\" in Martin and thus confirmed the viability of Martin's conclusion that the ADA validly abrogated the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity. 226 F.3d at 1128. Because both Cisneros and Martin were Title I cases, however, it was not necessary for the Cisneros court to determine whether Martin applied to the entire ADA or just Title I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Garrett, the Supreme Court held that Title I of the ADA was not a valid abrogation of the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity. See 121 S. Ct. at 967-68. The Court noted that the legislative record of the ADA did not identify a pattern of unconstitutional discrimination by the states and that even if such a record existed \"the rights and remedies created by the ADA against the States would raise the same sort of concerns as to congruence and proportionality as were found in City of Boerne.\" Id. at 966, 965. The Court, however, explicitly limited its ruling to Title I of the ADA and stated that it was \"not disposed to decide [in Garrett] the constitutional issue whether Title II, which has somewhat different remedial provisions from Title I, is appropriate legislation under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Id. at 960 n.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop of cases, this court must determine whether the validity of Congress' attempt through Title II to abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity is controlled by precedent. Garrett, although clearly instrumental in informing this court's analysis, expressly disavows any holding on Title II of the ADA. See id. As stated above, it is not clear whether the decision in Martin was intended to apply to the entire ADA or only Title I.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> It is not necessary, however, for this court to resolve that because Garrett clarifies that when evaluating a claim under the ADA the abrogation analysis should be conducted on each specific title, not on the statute as a whole. The Supreme Court held in Garrett that Title I of the ADA was not a valid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity; it did not render a decision as to the entire ADA. See id. Thus, even if Martin was a holding as to the entire ADA, Garrett demonstrates that it was error to conduct the abrogation analysis at that level of generality.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See Currier v. Doran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"160810\"><a href=\"/opinion/160810/currier-v-doran/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">905</span></a></span>, 912 (10th Cir. 2001) (stating that a panel is not bound by a prior panel opinion when there is a superseding Supreme Court decision). Therefore, this court now writes on a clean slate in addressing whether Title II of the ADA is a valid abrogation of the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether there has been an abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity is generally controlled by the \"now familiar principles\" for determining whether the statute in question was validly passed pursuant to Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment. Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 963. Section Five gives Congress the power to enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment by enacting \"appropriate legislation.\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV,  5; see also Flores, 521 U.S. at 536. This power \"includes the authority both to remedy and to deter violation of rights guaranteed [by the Fourteenth Amendment] by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment's text.\" Kimel, 528 U.S. at 81. When Congress has enacted legislation that exceeds the substantive guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment, however, the legislation must exhibit \"congruence and proportionality between the [constitutional] injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.\" Flores, 521 U.S. at 520. In conducting the congruent and proportional analysis, courts look to the Congressional record to determine \"whether Congress identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional [conduct] by the States.\" Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 964.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether Title II is a valid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity, it is first important to delineate with some care what conduct Title II prohibits or, perhaps more appropriately in this case, what conduct Title II requires. Title II states that \"no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\" 42 U.S.C.  12132.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A cursory reading of the statutory language can leave the impression that Title II simply prohibits intentional exclusion against the disabled solely because of their status as \"disabled.\" A more thorough review, however, reveals that, rather than preventing public entities from treating the disabled differently than the nondisabled, Title II requires that public entities make certain accommodations for the disabled in order to ensure their access to government programs. See Bonnie Poitras Tucker, The ADA's Revolving Door: Inherent Flaws in the Civil Rights Paradigm, 62 Ohio St. L.J. 335, 344 (2001) (stating that \"[s]imple equal treatment does not result in [the disabled's] inclusion into mainstream society\" and that \"[t]he ADA recognizes this need for different treatment\"). That Title II of the ADA requires accommodations by public entities is evident from other portions of the statute, the regulations implementing Title II, and caselaw interpreting the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The findings section of the ADA (applicable to all titles of the Act) states that individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including outright intentional exclusion, the discriminatory effects of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers, overprotective rules and policies, failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices, exclusionary qualification standards and criteria, segregation, and relegation to lesser services, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other opportunities</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C.  12101(5) (emphasis added). The definition of a \"qualified individual with a disability\" also illustrates the affirmative duty Title II imposes on public entities:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"qualified individual with a disability\" means an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.  12131(2) (emphasis added). In addition, Part B of Title II delineates specific examples of what constitutes \"discrimination\" by public entities in their public transportation services. See id.  12141-12165. This section of the statute requires, inter alia, that all new public transportation vehicles be accessible to the disabled and that any public entity which operates a fixed route transportation system provide comparable services for use by the disabled. See id.  12142-12144.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, from the language of the statute it is clear Title II requires public entities to make accommodations for the disabled. The regulations issued by the Department of Justice implementing Title II confirm this reading of the statute. Cf. Alexander v. Choate, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111299\"><a href=\"/opinion/111299/alexander-v-choate/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span>, 304-05 &amp; n.24 (1985) (using regulations as a source of guidance in interpreting a statute). One regulation provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a] public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 C.F.R.  35.130(b)(7). The regulation on which Plaintiffs in this case have based their claim also demonstrates that public entities will be required to take certain \"measures\" in order to comply with Title II. Id.  35.130(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, many courts have recognized that Title II requires public entities to make accommodations for the disabled. See, e.g., Popovich v. Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770527\"><a href=\"/opinion/770527/joseph-m-popovich-plaintiff-appellee-v-cuyahoga-county-court-of-common/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">627</span></a></span>, 638 (6th Cir. 2000) (stating that Title II \"imposes an affirmative obligation on public entities to accommodate disabled individuals\"), rehearing en banc granted, opinion vacated (Dec. 12, 2000); Alsbrook v.

Similarly, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\" 504\"), which uses language almost identical to Title II in describing a violation by covered entities,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> has been interpreted to require \"reasonable accommodations\" to covered programs or services. See Sch. Bd. v. Arline, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111832\"><a href=\"/opinion/111832/school-bd-of-nassau-cty-v-arline/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span>, 287 n.17 (1987) (stating that \"reasonable accommodations\" by covered entities are required under  504); Alexander, 469 U.S. at 299-301 (assuming without deciding that  504 provides for at least some disparate impact claims and that \"reasonable accommodations . . . may have to be made\"); Wynne v. Tufts Univ. Sch. of Med., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"560452\"><a href=\"/opinion/560452/steven-wynne-v-tufts-university-school-of-medicine/\"><span class=\"volume\">932</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir. 1991) (en banc). Thus, the duty to accommodate contained in Title II is well settled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears, however, that the duty to accommodate under  12132 is not boundless. Regulations issued by the Department of Justice speak of \"reasonable modifications\" that do not \"fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.\" 28 C.F.R.  35.130(b)(7); see also 42 U.S.C.  12131(2) (defining \"qualified individual with a disability\" as an individual \"who, with or without reasonable modifications . . ., meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services\" (emphasis added)). While expressly avoiding any ruling on the validity of  35.130(b)(7), the Supreme Court has interpreted the regulation to allow inquiry into whether an accommodation is \"reasonable\" in light of, inter alia, \"the resources available to the State.\" Olmstead v. Zimring, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118315\"><a href=\"/opinion/118315/olmstead-v-lc/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span>, 607, 592, 603-07 (1999). It is not necessary for purposes of this case to determine exactly when a state might refuse an accommodation because it is \"unreasonable\" or because it \"fundamentally alter[s] the nature of the service, program, or activity\"; this court will assume that such a defense does exist in certain circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next step in determining whether Title II is a valid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity \"is to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue.\" Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 963. Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment gives Congress the power to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. Appellees claim that Title II enforces both the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause. See U.S. Const. amend. XIV,  1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fundamental guarantee of the Equal Protection Clause is that \"all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\" City of Cleburne v.

Thus, a typical claim brought under the Equal Protection Clause challenges a classification or distinction made by the state. The reviewing court then determines the seriousness with which the Equal Protection Clause treats the particular classification and then applies the appropriate degree of judicial scrutiny to the state justifications for making the distinction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court case of Cleburne follows this pattern. In Cleburne, the Court considered an equal protection challenge to a city ordinance that required a special use permit for construction of a group home for the mentally disabled. See id. at 435-37. The Court determined that \"mental retardation\" is not a quasi-suspect class and that state legislation making classifications based on mental retardation need only be rationally related to a legitimate city interest. See id. at 442-46. Thus, a state violates the Equal Protection Clause if it makes distinctions between the disabled and nondisabled without a rational justification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Of course, \"a bare [] desire to harm a politically unpopular group\" is not a legitimate state interest.

When a state acts with invidious intent there is an Equal Protection violation even if no facial distinction has been made and the state action merely has a disparate impact on the disabled.

Thus, while the basic premise of the Equal Protection Clause is that similarly situated citizens should be treated alike, the mandate of the ADA is that those who are not similarly situated should be treated differently. The Equal Protection Clause does not generally require accommodations on behalf of the disabled by the states. See Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 964 (\"If special accommodations for the disabled are to be required, they have to come from positive law and not through the Equal Protection Clause.\"); Erickson, 207 F.3d at 951 (\"[N]o one believes that the Equal Protection Clause establishes the disparate-impact and mandatory-accommodation rules found in the ADA.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees correctly note that a fundamental interest in voting inheres in the Equal Protection Clause.

Thus, state measures which have the effect of denying or diluting a citizen's vote must be justified with a compelling state interest. See id. at 670 (striking down state poll tax); Reynolds v.

The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has been interpreted to incorporate most of the guarantees found in the Bill of Rights; these incorporated provisions thus apply to the states as well as the federal government See Duncan v.

Some of the incorporated guarantees of the first ten amendments require states, on certain occasions, to make accommodations for the disabled. For instance, a prison is required to provide the disabled with accessible toilets in order to comply with the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment contained in the Eighth Amendment. See LaFaut v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498148\"><a href=\"/opinion/498148/randy-dean-lafaut-v-william-french-smith-margaret-hambrick-bob-keiser/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span>, 389-95 (4th Cir. 1987) (Powell, A.J.). In at least some instances, the failure of states to provide accessible courtrooms could conceivably be a violation of due process. See Faretta v. California, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109309\"><a href=\"/opinion/109309/faretta-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span>, 819 n.15 (1975) (\"[A]n accused has a right to be present at all stages of the trial where his absence might frustrate the fairness of the proceedings.\"); Helminski v.

These examples do not exhaust the categories of rights protected by a requirement for some level of accommodation under the Due Process Clause. See, e.g., Youngberg v.

For purposes of this case, however, it is sufficient to note that the Due Process Clause does not contain the general mandate found in Title II, which requires accommodations by public entities in all of its \"services, programs, or activities.\" 42 U.S.C.  12132.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, states can violate the Fourteenth Amendment rights of the disabled in three different ways. First, facial distinctions between the disabled and nondisabled are unconstitutional unless rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Second, invidious state action against the disabled is unconstitutional, even if facially neutral toward the disabled (such as neutral statutory language). Finally, in certain limited circumstances such as those involving voting rights and prison conditions, states are required to make at least some accommodations for the disabled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having explored the Fourteenth Amendment's protections of the disabled, this court next \"examine[s] whether Congress identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional [conduct] by the States against the disabled.\" Garrett, 121 S.

As a result of these inquiries, Congress determined that \"discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as employment, housing, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and access to public services.\" 42 U.S.C.  12101(a)(3). Clearly, many of the \"critical areas\" in which Congress determined \"discrimination\" to exist apply to the states and come under the purview of Title II. Normally, Congressional findings are entitled to much deference. See Walters v.

As explained above, however, Congress' determination of what constitutes \"discrimination\" against the disabled differs from discrimination in the constitutional sense. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C.  12101(5). This court's duty is therefore to determine \"whether Congress identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional [] discrimination by the States against the disabled.\" Garrett, 121 S.

In any event, the vast majority of incidents discussed in the legislative record involving government \"services, programs, or activities\" are refusals by public entities to make accommodations for the disabled. See, e.g., Americans With Disabilities Act: Hearings on H.R. 2273 Before the Subcomm. on Surface Transp. of the Comm. on Public Works and Transp., 101st Cong. 204-09 (1989) (statement of John Hudson, Social Work Coordinator at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington, D.C.) (discussing lack of adequate public transportation for the disabled in Montgomery County, Maryland). The absence of numerous examples of unconstitutional discrimination against the disabled confirms the notion that Title II's primary focus was the failure by public entities to make accommodations for the disabled. See Helen L. v. DiDario, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687609\"><a href=\"/opinion/687609/helen-l-beverly-d-florence-h-ilene-f-idell-s-and-american/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, 335 (3d Cir. 1995) (stating that \"the ADA evolved from an attempt to remedy the effects of benign neglect resulting from the invisibility of the disabled\" and that \"invidious animus . . . was not the focus of . . . the ADA\"(quotations omitted)); see also Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989: Hearing on H.R. 2273 Before the Comm. on the Judiciary &amp; the Subcomm. on Civil &amp; Constitutional Rights of the Comm. on the Judiciary, 101st Cong. 162 (1989) (statement of Laura D. Cooper, disabled attorney) (\"It is my firm belief that many, but not all[,] of the inaccessibility problems that I have encountered are not so much the result of hostility or willful discrimination; rather, they are the result of benign neglect and a lack of understanding or concern about how particular policies or practices affect the disabled patrons in our midst.\"). The Supreme Court, in discussing  504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, upon which Title II of the ADA was based<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>, has stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[d]iscrimination against the handicapped was perceived by Congress to be most often the product, not of invidious animus, but rather of thoughtlessness and indifference--of benign neglect. . . . Federal agencies and commentators on the plight of the handicapped similarly have found that discrimination against the handicapped is primarily the result of apathetic attitudes rather than affirmative animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alexander, 469 U.S. at 295-96 (footnote omitted). This language is applicable to Title II of the ADA. Apathetic attitudes and refusals to make accommodations do not usually violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court cannot conclude that Congress \"identified a history and pattern\" of unconstitutional discrimination by the states against the disabled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 964. Nor can this court find in the caselaw \"extensive litigation and discussion of the constitutional violations.\" Id. at 968 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Without this foundation, Title II cannot be considered preventive or remedial legislation that is congruent and proportional to any constitutional violation. Without numerous documented occurrences of unconstitutional state discrimination against the disabled, Title II's accommodation requirement appears to be an attempt to prescribe a new federal standard for the treatment of the disabled rather than an attempt to combat unconstitutional discrimination. In this respect, Title II resembles RFRA, which the Supreme Court struck down in Flores. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118140\"><a href=\"/opinion/118140/city-of-boerne-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>; see also Erickson, 207 F.3d at 951 (\"What the RFRA did for religion, the ADA does for disabilities.\").

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, Colorado is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity from Plaintiffs' suit and the district court erred in denying Colorado's motion for summary judgment.

This motion is obviously an attempt to make prospective injunctive relief possible through an Ex parte Young suit. It appears that, if this court were inclined to grant the motion, it would have the power to do so. See Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112278\"><a href=\"/opinion/112278/newman-green-inc-v-alfonzo-larrain/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">826</span></a></span>, 833 (1989) (concluding that appellate courts do have the power to dismiss a dispensable party whose presence spoils statutory diversity jurisdiction); Balgowan v. New Jersey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741751\"><a href=\"/opinion/741751/richard-m-balgowan-thomas-m-batz-thomas-betten-karl-l-blum-raymond-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, 216-17 (3rd Cir. 1997) (granting motion to amend the complaint to add a state official as a defendant and to include a claim for prospective declaratory and injunctive relief, thus making Ex parte Young suit possible). Nevertheless, there are considerations weighing against Plaintiffs' motion.</p>\n        <p>Allowing Plaintiffs to amend their complaint would substantially alter the relevant legal issues to be decided in this case. Under the current complaint, the initial question that must be answered by this court is whether Colorado is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. The main consideration in this analysis is whether Congress validly abrogated Colorado's Eleventh Amendment immunity in enacting Title II of the ADA. If Plaintiffs' motion to amend is granted, however, this court could address the district court's award of the prospective injunctive relief requested in Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment without regard to the Eleventh Amendment immunity question. See Ex parte Young, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96819\"><a href=\"/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, 159-60 (1908). In addition, after Plaintiffs filed their motion to amend, Colorado asserted a challenge to Congress' ability to pass Title II of the ADA pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Clause. If Plaintiffs' motion to amend was granted, fairness would require this court to allow Defendants to press the Commerce Clause argument; more briefing and perhaps additional oral argument would then be necessary to properly evaluate the Commerce Clause issue. Allowing the amendment would wholly alter the complexion of this case.</p>\n        <p>Furthermore, unlike in Balgowan, there has been no reversal of a prior Supreme Court case on which Plaintiffs' relied in drafting their complaint. In Balgowan, the plaintiffs had brought a claim against the New Jersey Department of Transportation seeking monetary relief for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (\"FLSA\"), 29 U.S.C.  201-219 (1978). See 115 F.3d at 216. Under Supreme Court precedent at the time the plaintiffs in Balgowan filed suit, it appeared that the FLSA was a valid exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause power and that Congress could abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity through legislation enacted pursuant to the Commerce Clause. See Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112291\"><a href=\"/opinion/112291/pennsylvania-v-union-gas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 19-20 (1989); Garcia v. San Antonio Metro. Transit Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111308\"><a href=\"/opinion/111308/garcia-v-san-antonio-metropolitan-transit-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span>, 555-56 (1985). In Seminole Tribe v. Florida, which was decided after the plaintiffs in Balgowan filed suit, the Supreme Court reversed Union Gas and held that Congress cannot abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity by means of its Commerce Clause power. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118011\"><a href=\"/opinion/118011/seminole-tribe-of-fla-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 66 (1996). Thus, the Third Circuit allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, partly because of the plaintiffs' reliance on Union Gas. See Balgowan, 115 F.3d at 217. Plaintiffs in this case, however, have identified no similar equitable consideration justifying their eleventh-hour request to amend their complaint.</p>\n        <p>In Newman-Green the Supreme Court emphasized that the power of appellate courts to dismiss a nondiverse party \"should be exercised sparingly.\" 490 U.S. at 837. This admonition applies to Plaintiffs' motion to add a party, which has neither alleged or shown that denial of the motion results in an advantage lost by the Plaintiffs or disadvantage incurred. For the above-stated reasons, Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Amend to Add Party Defendant is denied.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Whatever the scope of Martin, clearly Garrett now controls claims brought pursuant to Title I.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> While some courts have addressed the Eleventh Amendment question by broadly considering the entire ADA, see Coolbaugh v.

This court agrees with the Ninth Circuit in rejecting a specific \"piecemeal analysis\" of whether each regulation passed pursuant to Title II is a valid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Dare v. California, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766203\"><a href=\"/opinion/766203/william-robert-dare-gary-petillo-v-state-of-california-dept-of-motor/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1167</span></a></span>, 1176 n.7 (9th Cir. 1999), cert denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The analysis adopted by the Supreme Court in cases such as Garrett addresses Congress' ability to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity by enacting legislation pursuant to its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. The power of various agencies to enact regulations implementing legislation passed by Congress is an entirely different question, one that is generally approached with deference by the courts. See Olmstead v. Zimring, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118315\"><a href=\"/opinion/118315/olmstead-v-lc/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span>, 597 (1999) (\"Because the Department [of Justice] is the agency directed by Congress to issue regulations implementing Title II, its views warrant respect.

In this court's view, it is simply inappropriate to apply the abrogation analysis to agency regulations. Thus, as the Supreme Court did with Title I in Garrett, this court will conduct the abrogation analysis by considering Title II in its entirety.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Compare 42 U.S.C.  12132, with 29 U.S.C.  794(a).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Although Cleburne dealt only with classifications based on mental retardation, the Court's decision in Garrett confirms that classifications based on disabilities, whether mental or otherwise, are subject only to rational basis review.

As a result of the directive in Garrett that only congressional findings of constitutional violations by beneficiaries of the Eleventh Amendment be considered, a determination that a statute is not a valid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity does not necessarily mean that the statute is not a valid exercise of Congress' power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the Fourteenth Amendment applies to local government entities not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, the analysis of whether Congress has the power to enact legislation requires inquiry into constitutional violations by these entities in addition to entities entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In fact, by the time Congress enacted the ADA every state in the Union, including Colorado, had enacted legislation requiring some accommodations on behalf of the disabled.
