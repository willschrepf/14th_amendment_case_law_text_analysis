The\nLibrary also challenges the MERC’s refusal to permit the Library to pursue an alternative claim\nthat if the head of the children’s services department is a nonsupervisory position, then the heads\nof two other departments of the Library, the adult services and circulation departments, are also\nnonsupervisory positions such that the challenged ballots cast by the employees holding those\ntwo positions should also be opened and counted. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n       As explained in Macomb Co v AFSCME Council 25, 494 Mich 65, 77; 833 NW2d 225\n(2013) (quotation marks and citations omitted):\n\n               In a case on appeal from the MERC, the MERC’s factual findings are\n       conclusive if supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the\n       whole record. Legal questions, which include questions of statutory interpretation\n       and questions of contract interpretation, are reviewed de novo. As a result, an\n       administrative agency’s legal rulings are set aside if they are in violation of the\n       constitution or a statute, or affected by a substantial and material error of law.\n\n       We first address and reject the Library’s contention that there was not competent,\nmaterial, and substantial evidence to support the MERC’s finding that the head of the children’s\nservices department is a nonsupervisory position.\n\n\n                                                -1-\n\f       The MERC’s classification of an employee as supervisory or nonsupervisory involves\nfindings of fact. See Police Officers Ass’n of Mich v Fraternal Order of Police, Montcalm Co\nLodge No 149, 235 Mich App 580, 586; 599 NW2d 504 (1999). “Findings of fact by the\n[MERC] are conclusive if supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the\nwhole record. This Court will reverse a MERC determination of an appropriate bargaining unit\nonly upon a clear showing of error.” Grosse Pointe Farms, 197 Mich App at 735 (citations\nomitted).\n\n        “The Legislature has segregated supervisory and executive personnel from other\npersonnel for purposes of collective bargaining.” Mich Ed Ass’n v Clare-Gladwin Intermediate\nSch Dist, 153 Mich App 792, 795; 396 NW2d 538 (1986); see also Grosse Pointe Farms, 197\nMich App at 733 (“Generally, supervisory employees are not included in the same bargaining\nunit as nonsupervisory personnel.”). Because the term is not defined in the PERA,1 this Court\nhas utilized a federal statutory definition of “supervisor” as referring to one who has the\nauthority\n\n         “to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or\n         discipline other employees, or responsibility to direct them, or to adjust their\n         grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the\n         foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical\n         nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.” [Clare-Gladwin\n         Intermediate Sch Dist, 153 Mich App at 797, quoting 29 USC 152(11).]\n\n“The existence of any one of these powers, regardless of the frequency of its exercise, is\nsufficient to confer supervisory status on an employee, as long as the power is real, rather than\ntheoretical.” Muskegon Co, 186 Mich App at 372. In other words, “it is not the exercise of\nauthority, but the delegation of authority, which is indicative of the attributes of a ‘supervisor.’ ”\nClare-Gladwin Intermediate Sch Dist, 153 Mich App at 797.\n\n        In this case, the MERC concluded that the evidence showed that Hausman did not\npossess supervisory authority as the head of the children’s services department. The MERC\nfound that Hausman never disciplined an employee or recommended discipline, was not\ninvolved in hiring employees, and was never told that she was expected to participate in hiring,\nfiring, or disciplining employees. The MERC found that Hausman’s authority in the children’s\nservices department, including assigning work on children’s programming, derived from her\nstatus as a professional librarian with a master’s degree rather than from any labor-relations or\nhuman-resources authority.\n\n        We conclude that there was competent, material, and substantial evidence to support the\nMERC’s determination that Hausman’s position as the head of children’s services was not\nsupervisory. Hausman testified that she never hired or fired any employees, was never involved\nin disciplining any employees as the head of children’s services, and never recommended any\nfirings or suspensions. Hausman was not involved in interviewing or hiring a new page who was\n\n\n1\n    Public Employee Relations Act, MCL 423.201 et seq.\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fassigned to her in the children’s department; the page was instead hired by the Library Director\nwithout consulting Hausman. Although the hours of two employees were increased after\nHausman had recommended such an action, there is no evidence that Hausman’s\nrecommendations were adopted without independent investigation. Hausman’s work as one of\nseveral rotating “supervisors in charge” of the Library did not establish that she was a supervisor,\ngiven that employees other than department heads also served as the rotating supervisor in\ncharge, including an administrative assistant, a librarian, and the head of automation. Hausman\nacknowledged that her performance evaluations of employees in the children’s department were\nused to determine whether an employee received a merit increase when there was no wage freeze\nin effect, but the Director determined what award or raise was warranted and never asked\nHausman what raises should be given. Hausman testified that she was not consulted about raises\nfor children’s department associates when across-the-board raises were given in 2006. Although\nHausman did set schedules for children’s department employees before her layoff in 2009, she\ntestified that upon her reinstatement in 2012 the other children’s department employees had\nalready established a work schedule, and Hausman merely “plugged” herself into the “holes of\nthat.” When children’s department employees requested time off, they submitted a form to\nHausman, who would check the schedule to make sure the goal of public service was being met\nand then pass the form on to the Library Director.\n\n        Sheila Collins, the Library Director, testified that she helped to write a description of the\nposition of department head applicable to all three departments, and this description was\napproved by the Library Board on March 14, 2012. According to Collins, a department head\nruns the department, handles personnel and budgetary issues, manages the scheduling of\nemployees, approves or disapproves requests for time off, and signs employees’ time sheets.\nCollins’s description of a department head’s powers could reasonably be viewed as merely\ntheoretical given that, as Collins acknowledged, there have been no hiring or disciplinary\nterminations or suspensions since she became the Director. Collins testified that Hausman had\nprovided an e-mail concerning the number of employees needed for a 40-hour versus a 55-hour\nweek, and that the Library Board chose a 40-hour week and adopted the department heads’\nrecommendations as best it could within budgetary constraints. But Collins did not testify that\nthe Library Board adopted Hausman’s recommendation without independent investigation. We\nacknowledge that Collins testified that the rotating supervisors in charge have the authority to\napprove or disapprove an employee’s request to leave early and to deal with an employee or\npatron problem immediately. However, as explained previously, employees other than\ndepartment heads serve as supervisor in charge on a rotating basis. Collins stated that\nperformance evaluations could affect whether an employee receives a raise if the budget allowed\na raise. But as discussed, Hausman testified that she had never been asked what raises should be\ngiven and that she was not consulted about raises that were provided in 2006.\n\n        We conclude that there was competent, material, and substantial evidence that Hausman\ndid not have authority to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign,\nreward, or discipline other employees or to effectively recommend such action. We discern no\nbasis to upset the MERC’s determination that Hausman lacked supervisory status in her role as\nthe head of the children’s services department. The MERC did not err by determining that\nHausman held a nonsupervisory position at the Library.\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\f        The Library next argues that the MERC erred by rejecting its alternative contention that\nthe three department head positions must be deemed either supervisory or nonsupervisory in\ntandem, and that the Library should have been permitted to present evidence establishing that the\nduties and authority of the three department head positions are effectively identical. We agree\nwith the Library to the extent that it contends it should have been permitted to present evidence\nconcerning the adult services and circulation department head positions in the hearing before the\nadministrative law judge (“ALJ”).\n\n        The Library consistently maintained throughout the administrative proceedings that the\nthree department heads were supervisors and that their ballots should not be opened, but that in\nthe alternative, if any of the three department heads was determined not to be a supervisor, then\nall three of the department heads should be found not to be supervisors and all three ballots\nshould be opened. The Library asserted that the evidence would show that all three department\nheads had the same essential job duties and responsibilities in their respective departments, and\nthat the differences in their job descriptions were related to their specific departmental functions.\nTherefore, the Library argued, there was no basis for concluding that one department head was\nnot a supervisor but that the other two department heads were supervisors.\n\n        The ALJ rejected the Library’s argument on the ground that there was no triable issue or\nmaterial dispute of fact concerning the supervisory status of the heads of the adult services and\ncirculation departments, given that both the Library and Charging Party AFSCME Council 25\n(“the Union”) asserted that those two positions were supervisory. The Library was therefore\nprecluded from presenting evidence concerning the duties and responsibilities of the heads of the\nadult services and circulation departments. The Library presented an offer of proof concerning\nthe proposed testimony of Marilyn Kwik and Diane Mehl, the respective heads of the adult\nservices and circulation departments, indicating their respective responsibilities in their\ndepartments. Following the hearing before the ALJ, the MERC found that the head of children’s\nservices was the only position with respect to which supervisory status was in dispute and that no\nevidence was presented to establish that the heads of adult services and circulation were\nsupervisors.\n\n        We conclude that the MERC committed a material and substantial error of law in\nrefusing to permit the Library to support its alternative contention. The Union and the Library\nagreed before the election that Kwik, Mehl, and Hausman could vote by challenged ballot and\nthat the MERC would determine their eligibility to vote, if necessary. Under the MERC’s rules,\nthe MERC must determine the merits of any challenged ballot and decide whether the person\ncasting the ballot is an eligible voter. Mich Admin Code, R 423.148(2) provides:\n\n               An authorized observer, the commission, or the election agent, before the\n       time the voter’s ballot is cast, or before the time the ballots are counted in the case\n       of a mail ballot election, may challenge for good cause the eligibility of any\n       person to participate in the election. A person challenged as an ineligible voter\n       shall be permitted to vote in secret, and the election agent shall set aside the\n       ballot, with appropriate markings. If it is determined by the commission or its\n       election agent that the challenged ballot, or ballots, is decisive of the result, then\n       the commission shall determine the merits of any challenged ballot and decide\n       whether or not the person is an eligible voter. [Emphasis added.]\n\n                                                -4-\n\f        Prior to the election, the MERC declared that all three department heads would “vote by\nchallenged ballot” and that “[t]he inclusion or exclusion of the [votes of the three department\nheads] will be determined by the Commission if their ballots are determinative of the results of\nthe election.” Because these three challenged ballots would have been decisive, given that the\nremaining unchallenged ballots were evenly split on whether to approve representation by the\nUnion, the MERC was obligated by Rule 423.148(2) to separately determine whether Hausman,\nMehl, and Kwik were eligible voters.\n\n        The ALJ stated that there was no material issue of disputed fact concerning the\nsupervisory status of the adult services and circulation department head positions because both\nthe Library and the Union agreed that those positions were supervisory. In so ruling, however,\nthe ALJ ignored that the Library’s alternative argument disputed the supervisory status of all\nthree department heads. In general, parties are permitted to plead inconsistent claims and facts in\nthe alternative. See MCR 2.111(A)(2); HJ Tucker & Assoc, Inc v Allied Chucker & Engineering\nCo, 234 Mich App 550, 561; 595 NW2d 176 (1999). Section 75 of the Administrative\nProcedures Act,2 MCL 24.275, provides in relevant part that “[i]n a contested case the rules of\nevidence as applied in a nonjury civil case in circuit court shall be followed as far as practicable,\nbut an agency may admit and give probative effect to evidence of a type commonly relied upon\nby reasonably prudent men in the conduct of their affairs.” The ALJ identified no principled\nbasis to exclude evidence offered in support of the Library’s alternative argument that the three\ndepartment head positions must be viewed in tandem as either all supervisory or all\nnonsupervisory. The Library sought to admit the testimony of Kwik and Mehl, the respective\nheads of the adult services and circulation departments, to establish that their duties were\neffectively identical to Hausman’s duties, such that any determination that Hausman’s position\nas the head of the children’s services department is nonsupervisory should apply equally to\nKwik’s and Mehl’s positions. As discussed in more detail below, while we disagree with the\nLibrary’s position that the MERC should have considered all three department heads in tandem,\nwe agree with its position that the MERC erred by precluding it from presenting evidence that\nwas relevant to a disputed issue, i.e., the supervisory or non-supervisory status of Kwik and\nMehl.\n\n        The MERC’s refusal to consider the Library’s alternative claim also constituted a failure\nto fulfill the MERC’s statutory duty to determine the appropriate bargaining unit. The\nLegislature has delegated to the MERC the power to determine appropriate units for collective\nbargaining. MCL 423.213; Muskegon Co Prof Command Ass’n v Muskegon Co, 186 Mich App\n365, 369; 464 NW2d 908 (1990).\n\n                 In designating appropriate bargaining units, the [MERC’s] primary\n         objective is to constitute the largest unit which, under the circumstances of the\n         case, is most compatible with the effectuation of the purposes of the law and\n         includes in a single unit all common interests. Consistent with this objective, the\n         [MERC’s] policy is to avoid fractionalization or multiplicity of bargaining units.\n\n\n\n2\n    MCL 24.201 et seq.\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\f       The touchstone of an appropriate bargaining unit is a common interest of all its\n       members in the terms and conditions of their employment that warrants inclusion\n       in a single bargaining unit and the choosing of a bargaining agent. This Court\n       abides by the [MERC’s] policy to constitute the largest bargaining unit\n       compatible with the effectuation of the [Public Employment Relations Act]. [Id.\n       at 373-374 (citations omitted).]\n\n“A community of interests includes, among other considerations, similarities in duties, skills,\nworking conditions, job classifications, employee benefits, and the amount of interchange or\ntransfer of employees.” Police Officers Ass’n of Mich v Grosse Pointe Farms, 197 Mich App\n730, 736; 496 NW2d 794 (1992).\n\n        In this case, the MERC refused to consider the Library’s proposed evidence with regard\nto the heads of adult services and circulation because it failed to recognize that the Library’s\nalternative argument pertained to the status of those positions. In doing so, the MERC failed to\nproperly exercise its statutory duty to determine the appropriate bargaining unit. The MERC is\nrequired to recognize the largest single unit that includes all common interests that warrant\ninclusion in a single unit. Id. If the evidence shows, as the Library asserts in its alternative\nargument, that the pertinent department heads are nonsupervisory, then excluding those\ndepartment heads from the presumptive bargaining unit may result in fractionalization.\n\n        In sum, we find the MERC committed a substantial and material error of law in refusing\nto permit the Library to advance its alternative claim. We therefore vacate the portion of the\nMERC’s decision that refused to consider the Library’s alternative claim and remand for further\nproceedings. Because, as discussed in detail above, we affirm the MERC’s decision as to\nHausman and her vote will break the existing tie, the MERC on remand should first consider,\nconsistent with Mich Admin Code R 423.148(2), whether Kwik’s and Mehl’s ballots are\ndeterminative of the election in light of Hausman’s now-counted vote. If the two challenged\nballots would be determinative, then the parties may present evidence concerning the duties and\nauthority of Kwik and Mehl, the heads of adult services and circulation, respectively. After\nconsidering the evidence presented, the MERC shall determine whether the heads of adult\nservices and circulation departments are nonsupervisory and therefore included within the\nappropriate bargaining unit such that their ballots should be opened and counted. We note,\nhowever, that whether those positions are supervisory should rise and fall on the facts pertinent\nto each position. In other words, the MERC should make determinations as to each position and\nshould not be bound by the Library’s assertion that the positions are to be considered in\nconjunction with each other and with Hausman. The MERC is to consider the merits of those\ntwo challenged ballots and decide whether each challenged individual is an eligible voter. See\nMich Admin Code R 423.148(2). The Library has not cited any authority, nor have we found\nany, indicating that the three positions at issue must rise and fall collectively, rather than on the\nindividual facts of each position. Indeed, if the positions are similar such that Kwik and Mehl\nshare “a common interest” in “the terms and conditions of their employment” so as to warrant\ninclusion in a single bargaining unit, it would be based on the pertinent facts, not because the\nLibrary has declared it to be so.\n\n      With regard to Mehl, we note the Library argues that the MERC erred by ruling that\nMehl was not in the presumptive bargaining unit regardless of whether she was a supervisor,\n\n                                                -6-\n\fbecause she was not a librarian. This issue is not preserved. “Generally, an issue is not properly\npreserved if it is not raised before, addressed, or decided by the circuit court or administrative\ntribunal.” Polkton Charter Twp v Pellegrom, 265 Mich App 88, 95; 693 NW2d 170 (2005).\nThis issue was not the focus of the proceedings below; rather, it arises from a footnote in the\nMERC decision, stating: “As a non-librarian, it appears that even if she had not been a\nsupervisor, Mehl would not have been included in the unit as it was defined by the consent\nelection agreement.” Despite this footnoted commentary, the issue was not decided by the\nMERC. For the reasons described earlier, the MERC declined to decide the issue whether Mehl\nand Kwik were included in the appropriate bargaining unit. The MERC’s observation in a\nfootnote that it appears that Mehl—a non-librarian—would not have been included in the\nbargaining unit as defined by the consent election agreement was not a decision that Mehl was\nexcluded from the unit for that reason. Indeed, the MERC declined to reach the issue of Mehl’s\ninclusion in the unit for the erroneous reason that Mehl’s supervisory status was supposedly\nundisputed. The issue was not decided below and is not preserved. Id.\n\n         Moreover, because we are remanding for a continued hearing for the reasons addressed\nearlier, the failure to consider this issue will not result in manifest injustice. See Gen Motors\nCorp v Dep’t of Treasury, 290 Mich App 355, 387; 803 NW2d 698 (2010). As discussed, no\nevidence concerning Mehl’s job duties has yet been presented, and the record is not sufficiently\ndeveloped to address whether she is properly included in the bargaining unit. Because the issue\nwhether Mehl’s status as a non-librarian affects her inclusion in the presumptive bargaining unit\nwas neither litigated nor decided below, review of this issue is not appropriate or feasible at this\njuncture.\n\n        Lastly, we note that the MERC’s decision contains inconsistent orders. The MERC\nconcluded that Hausman’s position as head of children’s services did not qualify as a statutory\nsupervisor and, therefore, her challenged ballot should be opened and counted with the election\nresults. Yet, the MERC attached to its decision and order a document entitled “DIRECTION OF\nELECTION” ordering that an election by secret ballot be conducted among the employees\nwithin the unit. The MERC identified no basis in its decision for ordering a new election, and\nwe can discern no basis for holding another election; rather, the appropriate remedy based on the\nMERC’s reasoning was, as the MERC itself initially stated, to open and count Hausman’s ballot.\nAccordingly, we vacate the portion of the MERC’s order directing that a new election be held.\n\n        Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction. No taxable costs pursuant to MCR 7.219, a public\nquestion having been involved.\n\n\n\n                                                             /s/ Kathleen Jansen\n                                                             /s/ Patrick M.

The\nLibrary also challenges the MERC’s refusal to permit the Library to pursue an alternative claim\nthat if the head of the children’s services department is a nonsupervisory position, then the heads\nof two other departments of the Library, the adult services and circulation departments, are also\nnonsupervisory positions such that the challenged ballots cast by the employees holding those\ntwo positions should also be opened and counted.

Because the term is not defined in the PERA,1 this Court\nhas utilized a federal statutory definition of “supervisor” as referring to one who has the\nauthority\n\n         “to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or\n         discipline other employees, or responsibility to direct them, or to adjust their\n         grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the\n         foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical\n         nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.” [Clare-Gladwin\n         Intermediate Sch Dist, 153 Mich App at 797, quoting 29 USC 152(11).]\n\n“The existence of any one of these powers, regardless of the frequency of its exercise, is\nsufficient to confer supervisory status on an employee, as long as the power is real, rather than\ntheoretical.” Muskegon Co, 186 Mich App at 372. In other words, “it is not the exercise of\nauthority, but the delegation of authority, which is indicative of the attributes of a ‘supervisor.’ ”\nClare-Gladwin Intermediate Sch Dist, 153 Mich App at 797.\n\n        In this case, the MERC concluded that the evidence showed that Hausman did not\npossess supervisory authority as the head of the children’s services department. The MERC\nfound that Hausman never disciplined an employee or recommended discipline, was not\ninvolved in hiring employees, and was never told that she was expected to participate in hiring,\nfiring, or disciplining employees. The MERC found that Hausman’s authority in the children’s\nservices department, including assigning work on children’s programming, derived from her\nstatus as a professional librarian with a master’s degree rather than from any labor-relations or\nhuman-resources authority.\n\n        We conclude that there was competent, material, and substantial evidence to support the\nMERC’s determination that Hausman’s position as the head of children’s services was not\nsupervisory. Hausman testified that she never hired or fired any employees, was never involved\nin disciplining any employees as the head of children’s services, and never recommended any\nfirings or suspensions. Hausman was not involved in interviewing or hiring a new page who was\n\n\n1\n    Public Employee Relations Act, MCL 423.201 et seq.\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fassigned to her in the children’s department; the page was instead hired by the Library Director\nwithout consulting Hausman. Although the hours of two employees were increased after\nHausman had recommended such an action, there is no evidence that Hausman’s\nrecommendations were adopted without independent investigation. Hausman’s work as one of\nseveral rotating “supervisors in charge” of the Library did not establish that she was a supervisor,\ngiven that employees other than department heads also served as the rotating supervisor in\ncharge, including an administrative assistant, a librarian, and the head of automation. Hausman\nacknowledged that her performance evaluations of employees in the children’s department were\nused to determine whether an employee received a merit increase when there was no wage freeze\nin effect, but the Director determined what award or raise was warranted and never asked\nHausman what raises should be given. Hausman testified that she was not consulted about raises\nfor children’s department associates when across-the-board raises were given in 2006. Although\nHausman did set schedules for children’s department employees before her layoff in 2009, she\ntestified that upon her reinstatement in 2012 the other children’s department employees had\nalready established a work schedule, and Hausman merely “plugged” herself into the “holes of\nthat.” When children’s department employees requested time off, they submitted a form to\nHausman, who would check the schedule to make sure the goal of public service was being met\nand then pass the form on to the Library Director.\n\n        Sheila Collins, the Library Director, testified that she helped to write a description of the\nposition of department head applicable to all three departments, and this description was\napproved by the Library Board on March 14, 2012. According to Collins, a department head\nruns the department, handles personnel and budgetary issues, manages the scheduling of\nemployees, approves or disapproves requests for time off, and signs employees’ time sheets.\nCollins’s description of a department head’s powers could reasonably be viewed as merely\ntheoretical given that, as Collins acknowledged, there have been no hiring or disciplinary\nterminations or suspensions since she became the Director. Collins testified that Hausman had\nprovided an e-mail concerning the number of employees needed for a 40-hour versus a 55-hour\nweek, and that the Library Board chose a 40-hour week and adopted the department heads’\nrecommendations as best it could within budgetary constraints. But Collins did not testify that\nthe Library Board adopted Hausman’s recommendation without independent investigation. We\nacknowledge that Collins testified that the rotating supervisors in charge have the authority to\napprove or disapprove an employee’s request to leave early and to deal with an employee or\npatron problem immediately. However, as explained previously, employees other than\ndepartment heads serve as supervisor in charge on a rotating basis. Collins stated that\nperformance evaluations could affect whether an employee receives a raise if the budget allowed\na raise. But as discussed, Hausman testified that she had never been asked what raises should be\ngiven and that she was not consulted about raises that were provided in 2006.\n\n        We conclude that there was competent, material, and substantial evidence that Hausman\ndid not have authority to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign,\nreward, or discipline other employees or to effectively recommend such action. We discern no\nbasis to upset the MERC’s determination that Hausman lacked supervisory status in her role as\nthe head of the children’s services department. The MERC did not err by determining that\nHausman held a nonsupervisory position at the Library.\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\f        The Library next argues that the MERC erred by rejecting its alternative contention that\nthe three department head positions must be deemed either supervisory or nonsupervisory in\ntandem, and that the Library should have been permitted to present evidence establishing that the\nduties and authority of the three department head positions are effectively identical. We agree\nwith the Library to the extent that it contends it should have been permitted to present evidence\nconcerning the adult services and circulation department head positions in the hearing before the\nadministrative law judge (“ALJ”).\n\n        The Library consistently maintained throughout the administrative proceedings that the\nthree department heads were supervisors and that their ballots should not be opened, but that in\nthe alternative, if any of the three department heads was determined not to be a supervisor, then\nall three of the department heads should be found not to be supervisors and all three ballots\nshould be opened. The Library asserted that the evidence would show that all three department\nheads had the same essential job duties and responsibilities in their respective departments, and\nthat the differences in their job descriptions were related to their specific departmental functions.\nTherefore, the Library argued, there was no basis for concluding that one department head was\nnot a supervisor but that the other two department heads were supervisors.\n\n        The ALJ rejected the Library’s argument on the ground that there was no triable issue or\nmaterial dispute of fact concerning the supervisory status of the heads of the adult services and\ncirculation departments, given that both the Library and Charging Party AFSCME Council 25\n(“the Union”) asserted that those two positions were supervisory. The Library was therefore\nprecluded from presenting evidence concerning the duties and responsibilities of the heads of the\nadult services and circulation departments. The Library presented an offer of proof concerning\nthe proposed testimony of Marilyn Kwik and Diane Mehl, the respective heads of the adult\nservices and circulation departments, indicating their respective responsibilities in their\ndepartments. Following the hearing before the ALJ, the MERC found that the head of children’s\nservices was the only position with respect to which supervisory status was in dispute and that no\nevidence was presented to establish that the heads of adult services and circulation were\nsupervisors.\n\n        We conclude that the MERC committed a material and substantial error of law in\nrefusing to permit the Library to support its alternative contention. The Union and the Library\nagreed before the election that Kwik, Mehl, and Hausman could vote by challenged ballot and\nthat the MERC would determine their eligibility to vote, if necessary. Under the MERC’s rules,\nthe MERC must determine the merits of any challenged ballot and decide whether the person\ncasting the ballot is an eligible voter. Mich Admin Code, R 423.148(2) provides:\n\n               An authorized observer, the commission, or the election agent, before the\n       time the voter’s ballot is cast, or before the time the ballots are counted in the case\n       of a mail ballot election, may challenge for good cause the eligibility of any\n       person to participate in the election. A person challenged as an ineligible voter\n       shall be permitted to vote in secret, and the election agent shall set aside the\n       ballot, with appropriate markings. If it is determined by the commission or its\n       election agent that the challenged ballot, or ballots, is decisive of the result, then\n       the commission shall determine the merits of any challenged ballot and decide\n       whether or not the person is an eligible voter. [Emphasis added.]\n\n                                                -4-\n\f        Prior to the election, the MERC declared that all three department heads would “vote by\nchallenged ballot” and that “[t]he inclusion or exclusion of the [votes of the three department\nheads] will be determined by the Commission if their ballots are determinative of the results of\nthe election.” Because these three challenged ballots would have been decisive, given that the\nremaining unchallenged ballots were evenly split on whether to approve representation by the\nUnion, the MERC was obligated by Rule 423.148(2) to separately determine whether Hausman,\nMehl, and Kwik were eligible voters.\n\n        The ALJ stated that there was no material issue of disputed fact concerning the\nsupervisory status of the adult services and circulation department head positions because both\nthe Library and the Union agreed that those positions were supervisory. In so ruling, however,\nthe ALJ ignored that the Library’s alternative argument disputed the supervisory status of all\nthree department heads. In general, parties are permitted to plead inconsistent claims and facts in\nthe alternative.

Section 75 of the Administrative\nProcedures Act,2 MCL 24.275, provides in relevant part that “[i]n a contested case the rules of\nevidence as applied in a nonjury civil case in circuit court shall be followed as far as practicable,\nbut an agency may admit and give probative effect to evidence of a type commonly relied upon\nby reasonably prudent men in the conduct of their affairs.” The ALJ identified no principled\nbasis to exclude evidence offered in support of the Library’s alternative argument that the three\ndepartment head positions must be viewed in tandem as either all supervisory or all\nnonsupervisory. The Library sought to admit the testimony of Kwik and Mehl, the respective\nheads of the adult services and circulation departments, to establish that their duties were\neffectively identical to Hausman’s duties, such that any determination that Hausman’s position\nas the head of the children’s services department is nonsupervisory should apply equally to\nKwik’s and Mehl’s positions. As discussed in more detail below, while we disagree with the\nLibrary’s position that the MERC should have considered all three department heads in tandem,\nwe agree with its position that the MERC erred by precluding it from presenting evidence that\nwas relevant to a disputed issue, i.e., the supervisory or non-supervisory status of Kwik and\nMehl.\n\n        The MERC’s refusal to consider the Library’s alternative claim also constituted a failure\nto fulfill the MERC’s statutory duty to determine the appropriate bargaining unit. The\nLegislature has delegated to the MERC the power to determine appropriate units for collective\nbargaining.

Consistent with this objective, the\n         [MERC’s] policy is to avoid fractionalization or multiplicity of bargaining units.\n\n\n\n2\n    MCL 24.201 et seq.\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\f       The touchstone of an appropriate bargaining unit is a common interest of all its\n       members in the terms and conditions of their employment that warrants inclusion\n       in a single bargaining unit and the choosing of a bargaining agent. This Court\n       abides by the [MERC’s] policy to constitute the largest bargaining unit\n       compatible with the effectuation of the [Public Employment Relations Act]. [Id.\n       at 373-374 (citations omitted).]\n\n“A community of interests includes, among other considerations, similarities in duties, skills,\nworking conditions, job classifications, employee benefits, and the amount of interchange or\ntransfer of employees.” Police Officers Ass’n of Mich v Grosse Pointe Farms, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">730</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 736; 496 NW2d 794 (1992).\n\n        In this case, the MERC refused to consider the Library’s proposed evidence with regard\nto the heads of adult services and circulation because it failed to recognize that the Library’s\nalternative argument pertained to the status of those positions. In doing so, the MERC failed to\nproperly exercise its statutory duty to determine the appropriate bargaining unit. The MERC is\nrequired to recognize the largest single unit that includes all common interests that warrant\ninclusion in a single unit. Id. If the evidence shows, as the Library asserts in its alternative\nargument, that the pertinent department heads are nonsupervisory, then excluding those\ndepartment heads from the presumptive bargaining unit may result in fractionalization.\n\n        In sum, we find the MERC committed a substantial and material error of law in refusing\nto permit the Library to advance its alternative claim. We therefore vacate the portion of the\nMERC’s decision that refused to consider the Library’s alternative claim and remand for further\nproceedings. Because, as discussed in detail above, we affirm the MERC’s decision as to\nHausman and her vote will break the existing tie, the MERC on remand should first consider,\nconsistent with Mich Admin Code R 423.148(2), whether Kwik’s and Mehl’s ballots are\ndeterminative of the election in light of Hausman’s now-counted vote. If the two challenged\nballots would be determinative, then the parties may present evidence concerning the duties and\nauthority of Kwik and Mehl, the heads of adult services and circulation, respectively. After\nconsidering the evidence presented, the MERC shall determine whether the heads of adult\nservices and circulation departments are nonsupervisory and therefore included within the\nappropriate bargaining unit such that their ballots should be opened and counted. We note,\nhowever, that whether those positions are supervisory should rise and fall on the facts pertinent\nto each position. In other words, the MERC should make determinations as to each position and\nshould not be bound by the Library’s assertion that the positions are to be considered in\nconjunction with each other and with Hausman. The MERC is to consider the merits of those\ntwo challenged ballots and decide whether each challenged individual is an eligible voter. See\nMich Admin Code R 423.148(2). The Library has not cited any authority, nor have we found\nany, indicating that the three positions at issue must rise and fall collectively, rather than on the\nindividual facts of each position. Indeed, if the positions are similar such that Kwik and Mehl\nshare “a common interest” in “the terms and conditions of their employment” so as to warrant\ninclusion in a single bargaining unit, it would be based on the pertinent facts, not because the\nLibrary has declared it to be so.\n\n      With regard to Mehl, we note the Library argues that the MERC erred by ruling that\nMehl was not in the presumptive bargaining unit regardless of whether she was a supervisor,\n\n                                                -6-\n\fbecause she was not a librarian. This issue is not preserved. “Generally, an issue is not properly\npreserved if it is not raised before, addressed, or decided by the circuit court or administrative\ntribunal.” Polkton Charter Twp v Pellegrom, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1291971\"><a href=\"/opinion/1291971/polkton-charter-twp-v-pellegrom/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 95; 693 NW2d 170 (2005).\nThis issue was not the focus of the proceedings below; rather, it arises from a footnote in the\nMERC decision, stating: “As a non-librarian, it appears that even if she had not been a\nsupervisor, Mehl would not have been included in the unit as it was defined by the consent\nelection agreement.” Despite this footnoted commentary, the issue was not decided by the\nMERC. For the reasons described earlier, the MERC declined to decide the issue whether Mehl\nand Kwik were included in the appropriate bargaining unit. The MERC’s observation in a\nfootnote that it appears that Mehl—a non-librarian—would not have been included in the\nbargaining unit as defined by the consent election agreement was not a decision that Mehl was\nexcluded from the unit for that reason. Indeed, the MERC declined to reach the issue of Mehl’s\ninclusion in the unit for the erroneous reason that Mehl’s supervisory status was supposedly\nundisputed. The issue was not decided below and is not preserved. Id.\n\n         Moreover, because we are remanding for a continued hearing for the reasons addressed\nearlier, the failure to consider this issue will not result in manifest injustice. See Gen Motors\nCorp v Dep’t of Treasury, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 387; 803 NW2d 698 (2010). As discussed, no\nevidence concerning Mehl’s job duties has yet been presented, and the record is not sufficiently\ndeveloped to address whether she is properly included in the bargaining unit. Because the issue\nwhether Mehl’s status as a non-librarian affects her inclusion in the presumptive bargaining unit\nwas neither litigated nor decided below, review of this issue is not appropriate or feasible at this\njuncture.\n\n        Lastly, we note that the MERC’s decision contains inconsistent orders. The MERC\nconcluded that Hausman’s position as head of children’s services did not qualify as a statutory\nsupervisor and, therefore, her challenged ballot should be opened and counted with the election\nresults. Yet, the MERC attached to its decision and order a document entitled “DIRECTION OF\nELECTION” ordering that an election by secret ballot be conducted among the employees\nwithin the unit. The MERC identified no basis in its decision for ordering a new election, and\nwe can discern no basis for holding another election; rather, the appropriate remedy based on the\nMERC’s reasoning was, as the MERC itself initially stated, to open and count Hausman’s ballot.\nAccordingly, we vacate the portion of the MERC’s order directing that a new election be held.\n\n        Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction. No taxable costs pursuant to MCR 7.219, a public\nquestion having been involved.\n\n\n\n                                                             /s/ Kathleen Jansen\n                                                             /s/ Patrick M.
