We will summarily affirm.\n\n       In May 2014, Jones, an inmate at SCI- Graterford, filed a civil rights complaint\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment violations for\n\nretaliation and for failing to take action regarding grievances and appeals he had filed\n\nconcerning a false misconduct report. Jones alleges that he and Corrections Officer (CO)\n\nKenneth Davidson engaged in a verbal altercation on October 22, 2011, following which\n\nJones filed a grievance against CO Davidson. Approximately one week later, CO\n\nDavidson charged plaintiff with misconduct for sexual contact with another inmate.\n\nAccording to Jones, CO Davidson did so in retaliation for the grievance Jones filed.\n\nJones was found guilty of the charge and pursued an appeal through the prison system,\n\nwhich was ultimately unsuccessful. Jones named as defendants CO Davidson; Wendy\n\nShaylor, Graterford Grievance Coordinator; and M. Wenerowicz, Graterford\n\nSuperintendent.\n\n       In July 2014, Shaylor and Wenerowicz filed a motion to dismiss Jones’ complaint.\n\nIn October 2014, Jones filed a motion for default judgment against CO Davidson for\n\nfailure to file a responsive pleading to Jones’ complaint. In June 2015, CO Davidson\n\nfiled a notice of intent to file a response nunc pro tunc, along with a motion to dismiss\n\nJones’ complaint. Jones’ motion for default judgment was subsequently denied. By\n\norder entered on November 25, 2015, the District Court granted Shaylor’s and\n\nWenerowicz’s motion to dismiss under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, without\n                                             2\n\fprejudice to allow Jones to amend his complaint to specify how Shaylor and Wenerowicz\n\nwere personally involved in the alleged violations of Jones’ constitutional rights. The\n\nDistrict Court also dismissed Jones’ Eighth Amendment and Due Process claims against\n\nall defendants but denied CO Davidson’s motion to dismiss as to Jones’ First\n\nAmendment claim.1\n\n             In February 2016, CO Davidson filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,\n\nwhich was subsequently denied in April 2016. In June 2016, CO Davidson filed a\n\nmotion for summary judgment. On August 10, 2016, Jones filed a motion to file an\n\namended complaint. By order that same day, the District Court granted CO Davidson’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment. On August 12, 2016, the District Court dismissed Jones’\n\nmotion to file an amended complaint as moot, noting that summary judgment had been\n\ngranted for CO Davidson and that it would be unfair to allow Jones to amend his\n\npleadings months after discovery had closed.\n\n           Jones appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Because Jones\n\nhas been granted in forma pauperis status pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915, we review this\n\nappeal for possible dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B). We may summarily\n\naffirm under Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6 if the appeal lacks substantial merit.\n\n                                                           I.\n\n\n\n1\n    Although Jones’ complaint does not explicitly bring a claim under the First\n                                                              Amendment, the District\nCourt determined after a liberal reading of Jones’ complaint that CO Davidson’s alleged\nretaliation against Jones for filing a grievance implicating Jones’ First Amendment rights.\n                                               3\n\f       We exercise plenary review of the District Court's order dismissing Jones’\n\ncomplaint in part under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a\n\nclaim. See Allen ex rel. Martin v. LaSalle Bank, N.A., 629 F.3d 364, 367 (3d Cir. 2011).\n\nIn reviewing the dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), “we accept all factual allegations as true\n\n[and] construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.” Warren Gen.\n\nHosp. v. Amgen Inc., 643 F.3d 77, 84 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Pinker v. Roche Holdings,\n\nLtd., 292 F.3d 361, 374 n.7 (3d Cir. 2002)). A court may grant a motion to dismiss under\n\nRule 12(b)(6) “only if, accepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true and\n\nviewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, [it] finds that [the] plaintiff's\n\nclaims lack facial plausibility.” Id. (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,\n\n555–56 (2007)). Pro se pleadings, “however inartfully pleaded,” must be held to “less\n\nstringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.” Haines v. Kerner, 404\n\nU.S. 519, 520 (1972). However, “pro se litigants still must allege sufficient facts in their\n\ncomplaints to support a claim.” Mala v. Crown Bay Marina, Inc., 704 F.3d 239, 245 (3d\n\nCir. 2013).\n\n       We agree with the District Court’s analysis and conclude that the claims against\n\nShaylor and Wenerowicz in their official capacities were properly dismissed under the\n\ndoctrine of sovereign immunity. The Eleventh Amendment bars suits in federal court by\n\nprivate parties against states, state agencies, and state officials in their official capacities,\n\nabsent consent by the state. Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 267-70\n\n(1997). While a state may lose its immunity by Congressional abrogation or by waiver,\n                                                4\n\fsee Lavia v. Pa. Dep’t of Corr., 224 F.3d 190, 195 (3d Cir. 2000), Congress did not\n\nabrogate states’ sovereign immunity when it enacted 42 U.S.C. § 1983, see Will v. Mich.\n\nDep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 66 (1989). Moreover, we have previously noted that\n\nthe Pennsylvania legislature has expressly declined to waive its sovereign immunity by\n\nstatute. See Lavia, 224 F.3d at 195; see also 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 8521(b). To the\n\nextent that Shaylor and Wenerowicz were sued in their official capacities, they are\n\nimmune from suit.\n\n       We further agree with the District Court’s conclusion that Jones failed to plead\n\nsufficient facts to establish liability for Shaylor and Wenerowicz in their individual\n\ncapacities. Liability under § 1983 may not be based solely on the doctrine of respondeat\n\nsuperior. See Evancho v. Fisher, 423 F.3d 347, 353 (3d Cir. 2005). Instead, the plaintiff\n\nmust show that the official’s conduct caused the deprivation of a federally protected right.\n\nSee Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 166 (1985). More particularly, the plaintiff must\n\nallege that the defendant was personally involved in the deprivation. See Rode v.\n\nDellarciprete, 845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988). Here, Jones failed to allege any\n\npersonal involvement of Shaylor or Wenerowicz other than by virtue of their supervisory\n\npositions.\n\n                                             II.\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f       Jones’ Due Process claims against all defendants stem from the disciplinary\n\nconsequences2 of the allegedly retaliatory, fabricated misconduct charge. Jones also\n\nalleges, inter alia, that Shaylor and Wenerowicz failed to sufficiently investigate his\n\ngrievances, and he was not permitted to present witnesses at his misconduct hearing in\n\nviolation of his Due Process rights. A prisoner has a right to procedural due process\n\nwhen he is deprived of a legally cognizable liberty interest, which occurs when the prison\n\n“imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary\n\nincidents of prison life.” Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995). However,\n\n“discipline in segregated confinement [does] not present the type of atypical, significant\n\ndeprivation in which a State might conceivably create a liberty interest” under the\n\nFourteenth Amendment. Id. at 486; see also Smith v. Mensinger, 293 F.3d 641, 653 (3d\n\nCir. 2002) (holding seven months of disciplinary confinement did not implicate liberty\n\ninterest); Torres v. Fauver, 292 F.3d 141, 151–52 (3d Cir. 2002) (holding disciplinary\n\ndetention for fifteen days and administrative segregation for 120 days did not implicate\n\nliberty interest); Griffin v. Vaughn, 112 F.3d 703, 706 (3d Cir. 1997) (holding\n\nadministrative detention for fifteen months did not implicate liberty interest).\n\nAccordingly, the procedures to which he is entitled under Wolff do not apply. See Wolff\n\nv. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 563-67 (1974) (holding where inmate may be deprived of\n\n\n2\n  Specifically, Jones claims that, as a result of the misconduct charge, he was placed in\nthe Restricted Housing Unit (RHU) for thirty days, designated a predator, ostracized and\nstigmatized, and assigned a higher security status, which affects his housing, work\neligibility, and school and program consideration.\n                                                6\n\fprotected liberty interest, he is entitled to: (1) advance written notice of disciplinary\n\ncharges; (2) the opportunity, when consistent with prison safety and penological goals, to\n\ncall witnesses and present evidence; and (3) a written statement by the factfinder of the\n\nevidence relied on and reasons for the disciplinary action).3\n\n                                              III.\n\n       We further conclude that summary judgment was proper with regard to Jones’\n\nretaliation claim against CO Davidson. Summary judgment is appropriate “if the movant\n\nshows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party “bears the initial\n\nresponsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying\n\nthose portions” of the record which demonstrate the absence of a genuine dispute of\n\nmaterial fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). If the moving party\n\nmeets its burden, the nonmoving party then must present specific facts that show there is\n\na genuine issue for trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1), (e)(2); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\n\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A court should grant summary judgment where the non-\n\nmovant’s evidence is merely colorable or not significantly probative, Anderson, 477 U.S.\n\n\n\n3\n  Jones’ Eighth Amendment claim against CO Davidson is equally without merit and was\nappropriately dismissed by the District Court. Where conditions are not “cruel and\nunusual” but merely “restrictive and even harsh,” they do not violate the Eighth\nAmendment but rather “are part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their\noffenses against society.” Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347 (1981). Placing an\ninmate in restricted housing does not violate the Eighth Amendment “as long as the\nconditions of confinement are not foul, inhuman or totally without penological\n                                             7\n\fat 249-50, because “[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of\n\nfact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no ‘genuine issue for trial,’” Matsushita\n\nElec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986) (citation omitted).\n\n       To establish a claim of retaliation, a prisoner must show: (1) that he was engaged\n\nin a constitutionally protected activity; (2) that he “suffered some ‘adverse action’ at the\n\nhands of the prison officials”; and (3) that the protected activity was “a substantial or\n\nmotivating factor” in the prison officials’ decision to take the adverse action. Rauser v.\n\nHorn, 241 F.3d 330, 333-34 (3d Cir. 2001). The burden then shifts to the prison officials\n\nto prove “that they would have made the same decision absent the protected conduct for\n\nreasons reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.” Id. at 334.\n\n       Here, as the District Court aptly concluded, Jones satisfied the first two prongs of\n\na prima facie First Amendment retaliation claim by: (1) filing a grievance; and (2)\n\nalleging that, as a result of the fabricated misconduct charge by CO Davidson, he was\n\ndesignated a predator and a homosexual; given a higher security status, which negatively\n\naffected his housing, work eligibility, school and program considerations; and ostracized,\n\nsee Allah v. Seiverling, 229 F.3d 220, 225-26 (3d Cir. 2000). With regard to the third\n\nand most contested factor, we agree with the District Court’s conclusion that Jones’\n\nproclivity for sexual misconduct prior to his incarceration and history of infractions4 after\n\n\njustification.” See Young v. Quinlan, 960 F.2d 351, 364 (3d Cir. 1992).\n4\n  CO Davidson provided evidence that Jones is currently incarcerated for a variety of\ncriminal offenses, including rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Jones’\nprison disciplinary record also lists thirty-six charges over seventeen years, eighteen of\n                                                8\n\fhe arrived at Graterford was more than sufficient to show that his placement in the RHU\n\nserved a legitimate penological interest and would have occurred regardless of any\n\nretaliatory motive. See Rauser, 241 F.3d at 334. Jones’ retaliatory discipline claim fails\n\nbecause there is “some evidence” supporting the guilty finding for the misconduct charge\n\nbrought against Jones after he filed his grievance against CO Davidson. See Henderson\n\nv. Baird, 29 F.3d 464, 469 (8th Cir. 1994).\n\n       Moreover, Jones’ own account of the incident partially supports defendant’s\n\nversion of events because he does not deny that another inmate was in his cell, that he\n\ndisrobed, and that a curtain was restricting the view of his cell, which he explained to CO\n\nDavidson “may have looked suspicious, but nothing sexual occurred.” Jones has\n\nprovided some countervailing evidence in support of his allegations, including CO\n\nDavidson’s subsequent criminal history for tax fraud, which is relevant to his credibility,\n\nand the affidavits of fellow inmates. However, we agree with the District Court’s\n\ndetermination that the affidavits of the other inmates support only Jones’ allegations\n\nregarding his verbal altercation with CO Davidson and not his innocence of the\n\nmisconduct charge. After considering the evidence of record, a reasonable finder of fact\n\nwould have to conclude that CO Davidson would have made the same decision out of\n\nlegitimate penological interests regardless of any retaliatory motive. See Rauser, 241\n\nF.3d at 334. Thus, summary judgment was appropriate as to this claim.\n\n\nwhich he was found guilty. In another nine instances, he was not exonerated, although\nthe charges were reduced.\n                                           9\n\f                                             IV.\n\n       Because the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily\n\naffirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f",

We will summarily affirm.\n\n       In May 2014, Jones, an inmate at SCI- Graterford, filed a civil rights complaint\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment violations for\n\nretaliation and for failing to take action regarding grievances and appeals he had filed\n\nconcerning a false misconduct report. Jones alleges that he and Corrections Officer (CO)\n\nKenneth Davidson engaged in a verbal altercation on October 22, 2011, following which\n\nJones filed a grievance against CO Davidson. Approximately one week later, CO\n\nDavidson charged plaintiff with misconduct for sexual contact with another inmate.\n\nAccording to Jones, CO Davidson did so in retaliation for the grievance Jones filed.\n\nJones was found guilty of the charge and pursued an appeal through the prison system,\n\nwhich was ultimately unsuccessful. Jones named as defendants CO Davidson; Wendy\n\nShaylor, Graterford Grievance Coordinator; and M. Wenerowicz, Graterford\n\nSuperintendent.\n\n       In July 2014, Shaylor and Wenerowicz filed a motion to dismiss Jones’ complaint.\n\nIn October 2014, Jones filed a motion for default judgment against CO Davidson for\n\nfailure to file a responsive pleading to Jones’ complaint. In June 2015, CO Davidson\n\nfiled a notice of intent to file a response nunc pro tunc, along with a motion to dismiss\n\nJones’ complaint. Jones’ motion for default judgment was subsequently denied. By\n\norder entered on November 25, 2015, the District Court granted Shaylor’s and\n\nWenerowicz’s motion to dismiss under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, without\n                                             2\n\fprejudice to allow Jones to amend his complaint to specify how Shaylor and Wenerowicz\n\nwere personally involved in the alleged violations of Jones’ constitutional rights. The\n\nDistrict Court also dismissed Jones’ Eighth Amendment and Due Process claims against\n\nall defendants but denied CO Davidson’s motion to dismiss as to Jones’ First\n\nAmendment claim.1\n\n             In February 2016, CO Davidson filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,\n\nwhich was subsequently denied in April 2016. In June 2016, CO Davidson filed a\n\nmotion for summary judgment. On August 10, 2016, Jones filed a motion to file an\n\namended complaint. By order that same day, the District Court granted CO Davidson’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment. On August 12, 2016, the District Court dismissed Jones’\n\nmotion to file an amended complaint as moot, noting that summary judgment had been\n\ngranted for CO Davidson and that it would be unfair to allow Jones to amend his\n\npleadings months after discovery had closed.\n\n           Jones appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Because Jones\n\nhas been granted in forma pauperis status pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915, we review this\n\nappeal for possible dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B). We may summarily\n\naffirm under Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6 if the appeal lacks substantial merit.\n\n                                                           I.\n\n\n\n1\n    Although Jones’ complaint does not explicitly bring a claim under the First\n                                                              Amendment, the District\nCourt determined after a liberal reading of Jones’ complaint that CO Davidson’s alleged\nretaliation against Jones for filing a grievance implicating Jones’ First Amendment rights.\n                                               3\n\f       We exercise plenary review of the District Court's order dismissing Jones’\n\ncomplaint in part under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a\n\nclaim.

The Eleventh Amendment bars suits in federal court by\n\nprivate parties against states, state agencies, and state officials in their official capacities,\n\nabsent consent by the state. Idaho v.

Moreover, we have previously noted that\n\nthe Pennsylvania legislature has expressly declined to waive its sovereign immunity by\n\nstatute. See Lavia, 224 F.3d at 195; see also 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 8521(b). To the\n\nextent that Shaylor and Wenerowicz were sued in their official capacities, they are\n\nimmune from suit.\n\n       We further agree with the District Court’s conclusion that Jones failed to plead\n\nsufficient facts to establish liability for Shaylor and Wenerowicz in their individual\n\ncapacities. Liability under § 1983 may not be based solely on the doctrine of respondeat\n\nsuperior. See Evancho v.

More particularly, the plaintiff must\n\nallege that the defendant was personally involved in the deprivation.

Here, Jones failed to allege any\n\npersonal involvement of Shaylor or Wenerowicz other than by virtue of their supervisory\n\npositions.\n\n                                             II.\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f       Jones’ Due Process claims against all defendants stem from the disciplinary\n\nconsequences2 of the allegedly retaliatory, fabricated misconduct charge. Jones also\n\nalleges, inter alia, that Shaylor and Wenerowicz failed to sufficiently investigate his\n\ngrievances, and he was not permitted to present witnesses at his misconduct hearing in\n\nviolation of his Due Process rights. A prisoner has a right to procedural due process\n\nwhen he is deprived of a legally cognizable liberty interest, which occurs when the prison\n\n“imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary\n\nincidents of prison life.” Sandin v.

See Rauser, 241 F.3d at 334. Jones’ retaliatory discipline claim fails\n\nbecause there is “some evidence” supporting the guilty finding for the misconduct charge\n\nbrought against Jones after he filed his grievance against CO Davidson. See Henderson\n\nv.

However, we agree with the District Court’s\n\ndetermination that the affidavits of the other inmates support only Jones’ allegations\n\nregarding his verbal altercation with CO Davidson and not his innocence of the\n\nmisconduct charge. After considering the evidence of record, a reasonable finder of fact\n\nwould have to conclude that CO Davidson would have made the same decision out of\n\nlegitimate penological interests regardless of any retaliatory motive. See Rauser, 241\n\nF.3d at 334. Thus, summary judgment was appropriate as to this claim.\n\n\nwhich he was found guilty.
