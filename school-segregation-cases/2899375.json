Reviewing de novo, see Springdale Educ. Ass’n\nv. Springdale Sch. Dist., 133 F.3d 649, 651 (8th Cir. 1998), we affirm in part and\nreverse in part.\n\f       We conclude that Sims’s allegations against Cummins Unit Mental Health\nAdministrator Jerry Moore and Counselor Jeanette Hall--that they deliberately\ndisregarded his serious medical need by deciding to move him from mental health\nhousing, falsely attributing the decision to Sims’s psychiatrist--amount to a\ndisagreement over a treatment decision. See Jolly v. Knudsen, 205 F.3d 1094, 1096\n(8th Cir. 2000) (for deliberate-indifference claim, plaintiff must demonstrate that he\nsuffered from objectively serious medical need that defendants knew of yet ignored;\nmere disagreement with treatment decisions does not rise to level of constitutional\nviolation). Because this decision in itself did not amount to a constitutional\ndeprivation, there can be no supervisory liability for the decision. See Madewell v.\nRoberts, 909 F.2d 1203, 1208 (8th Cir. 1990).\n\n       We conclude, however, that Sims stated a deliberate-indifference claim against\nWarden Gaylon Lay as a policy maker. Sims alleged that--through his grievances--\nWarden Lay knew of the Cummins Unit’s constitutionally inadequate housing and\nstaffing for mental health inmates yet failed to correct the situation. Cf. Ouzts v.\nCummins, 825 F.2d 1276, 1277 (8th Cir. 1987) (per curiam) (warden’s responsibility\nfor overseeing prison operations is insufficient to establish personal involvement\nrequired to support § 1983 liability for guards’ beating of inmate, but warden might\nbe liable for policy decisions resulting in alleged unconstitutional conditions). Sims\nalleged that he was unable to see a psychiatrist or psychologist when he needed to, and\nthat insufficient housing for mental health inmates resulted in their inappropriate\nplacement in administrative segregation and general population. We believe that\nwhether the housing and staffing at the Cummins Unit were adequate to meet Sims’s\nserious mental health needs is a factual question as to which dismissal on the\npleadings was inappropriate. See Moore v. Duffy, 255 F.3d 543, 545 (8th Cir. 2001)\n(medical treatment may so deviate from applicable standard of care as to show\ndeliberate indifference, but such departure is factual question often requiring expert\nopinion to resolve); Beck v. Skon, 253 F.3d 330, 333 (8th Cir. 2001) (failure to supply\nmedical care can constitute Eighth Amendment violation).\n\n                                         -2-\n\f      Accordingly, we affirm in part, and we reverse and remand for further\nproceedings on this deliberate-indifference claim against Warden Lay.\n                       ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f",
