D/B/A SHARED SERVICE\n                 CENTER-SAN ANTONIO, Appellee\n\n\n                     On Appeal from the 250th District Court\n                              Travis County, Texas\n                     Trial Court Cause No. D-1-GN-10-001941\n\n\n                                  OPINION\n       Jennie Lucan appeals from the trial court’s take-nothing summary judgment\nin favor of her former employer, HSS Systems, L.L.C. d/b/a Shared Service\nCenter-San Antonio. In her sole appellate issue, Lucan contends that she presented\nmore than a scintilla of evidence on each element of her retaliation claim against\nHSS under Section 21.055 of the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act\n\f(TCHRA) 1 and that she presented more than a scintilla of evidence that HSS’s\nstated reason for her termination—that she failed to meet a numerical productivity\nstandard—was a mere pretext for retaliation. Based on these contentions, Lucan\nasserts that the trial court erred when it granted HSS’s motion for summary\njudgment on both traditional and no-evidence grounds and when it failed to grant\nher motion for new trial. We affirm.\n       In November 2007, Lucan began employment with HSS as a registrar at\nSt. David’s South Austin Medical Center in Austin. As a registrar, Lucan had the\nresponsibility to register patients at the hospital. Lucan’s job duties required her to\nobtain necessary information from patients and to verify the patients’ insurance\ncoverage. On April 1, 2009, HSS terminated Lucan’s employment.\n       In June 2010, Lucan filed suit against HSS.                   Lucan alleged that, “[i]n\napproximately May of 2008, [she] was subjected to sexual misconduct in the\nworkplace involving two co-workers.” Lucan further alleged that, “[s]pecifically,\na female employee named [Corina]2 S. (Defendants know her last name) was\nstanding at a copy machine one night making copies while a male LVN named\nJosh C. (Defendants know his last name) was standing behind her”; that “Josh\npushed his groin into [Corina’s] rear end hard and gyrated his hips while rubbing\nhis hands up and down [Corina’s] thighs”; and that, “[i]n response, [Corina]\npushed her rear-end out and pressed it against Josh’s groin while smiling.”\n\n\n\n       1\n         Section 21.055 is found in Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code. See TEX. LABOR CODE ANN. §\n21.055 (West 2006). Courts refer to Chapter 21 of the Labor Code as the Texas Commission on Human\nRights Act. Prairie View A & M Univ. v. Chatha, 381 S.W.3d 500, 502 n.1 (Tex. 2012); see LABOR §§\n21.001–.556 (West 2006 & Supp. 2013). However, the Texas Workforce Commission civil rights\ndivision has replaced the Commission on Human Rights. Prairie View, 381 S.W.3d at 502 n.1.\nThroughout this opinion, we refer to Chapter 21 of the Labor Code as the TCHRA.\n       2\n        In parts of the record, “Corina” is referred to as “Curina.” We will refer to the employee as\n“Corina” throughout this opinion.\n\n                                                 2\n\f      Lucan alleged that she reported Josh’s and Corina’s “improper and offensive\nsexual conduct” to a supervisor, Director Jane Heckler, and to Lucan’s Team Lead,\nTammy, whose last name was unknown to Lucan. Lucan further alleged that she\nmade a written report on March 20, 2009, to Human Resources Manager Stephanie\nLong about the same offensive sexual conduct. In the writing, Lucan stated that,\n“[a]pproximately in May, 2008, I witnessed a sexual behavior between nurse, Josh\n(LVN) and my co-worker (Corina) who is no longer in the department.” Lucan\nalleged that, as a result of her reports about the offensive sexual conduct, she was\nsubjected to numerous adverse employment actions, including her termination\nfrom employment.\n      Lucan alleged that HSS retaliated and discriminated against her in violation\nof Section 21.055 of the TCHRA.         Specifically, Lucan alleged that “[HSS]\nretaliated and/or discriminated against [her] for her opposition to discriminatory\npractices, including but not limited to her opposition to a work environment made\nhostile based on sex.” Lucan also alleged that the retaliation included, but was not\nlimited to, “offensive statements, offensive physical contact, unfounded written\nreprimands, unfounded Performance Improvement Plans, the denial of a transfer,\nand the decision to fire [her].”\n      HSS filed a combined traditional and no-evidence motion for summary\njudgment based on the grounds that Lucan had no evidence or insufficient\nevidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact on any of the three elements of a\nprima facie case of retaliation or on the issue of whether Lucan’s termination was a\npretext for retaliation. Lucan filed a response to the motion. Following a hearing,\nthe trial court entered an order in which it granted the motion. Lucan filed a\nmotion for new trial. The motion was overruled by operation of law.\n      We review a summary judgment de novo. Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp\nAdvisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d 844, 848 (Tex. 2009). Where, as here, a\n                                         3\n\ftrial court does not specify the grounds it relied upon to grant the summary\njudgment, we must affirm the summary judgment if any of the grounds presented\nin the motion for summary judgment are meritorious. FM Props. Operating Co. v.\nCity of Austin, 22 S.W.3d 868, 872 (Tex. 2000). We find one of HSS’s no-\nevidence grounds dispositive. We review a no-evidence summary judgment under\nthe same legal sufficiency standard as a directed verdict. King Ranch, Inc. v.\nChapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 750–51 (Tex. 2003). Accordingly, we examine the\nrecord in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.\nRodriguez, 92 S.W.3d 502, 506 (Tex. 2002).                        We take as true all evidence\nfavorable to the nonmovant, and we indulge every reasonable inference and\nresolve any doubts in the nonmovant’s favor.                      Joe v. Two Thirty Nine Joint\nVenture, 145 S.W.3d 150, 156–57 (Tex. 2004). We disregard all contrary evidence\nand inferences.      King Ranch, 118 S.W.3d at 751.                   A no-evidence motion is\nproperly granted if the nonmovant fails to bring more than a scintilla of probative\nevidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to a challenged element of the\nnonmovant’s claim on which the nonmovant would have the burden of proof at\ntrial. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i); Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d 598,\n600 (Tex. 2004); King Ranch, 118 S.W.3d at 751.\n      The TCHRA is a comprehensive fair employment practices act and remedial\nscheme, and it is modeled on Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964\n(Title VII).3 Prairie View, 381 S.W.3d at 502–03. The TCHRA provides the\nframework for employment discrimination claims in Texas. Id. The TCHRA was\nenacted in an effort to address the specific evils of discrimination and retaliation in\nthe workplace and to coordinate Texas law with federal antidiscrimination and\nretaliation laws under Title VII. Id. at 504. Because one of the primary goals of\nthe TCHRA is to coordinate state law with federal law in the area of employment\n      3\n       Title VII is codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17.\n\n                                                  4\n\fdiscrimination, we look to analogous federal statutes and the cases interpreting\nthem to guide us when interpreting the TCHRA. In re United Servs. Auto. Ass’n,\n307 S.W.3d 299, 308 (Tex. 2010); Quantum Chem. Corp. v. Toennies, 47 S.W.3d\n473, 476 (Tex. 2001).\n      Section 21.051 of the TCHRA defines discrimination by an employer as\nfollows:\n            An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if\n      because of race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age\n      the employer:\n\n                   (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges\n            an individual, or discriminates in any other manner\n            against an individual in connection with compensation or\n            the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or\n\n                   (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or\n            applicant for employment in a manner that would deprive\n            or tend to deprive an individual of any employment\n            opportunity or adversely affect in any other manner the\n            status of an employee.\n\nLABOR § 21.051(1), (2). Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that is\nprohibited by Title VII and the TCHRA. Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477\nU.S. 57, 66–67 (1986); City of San Antonio v. Cancel, 261 S.W.3d 778, 783 (Tex.\nApp.—Amarillo 2008, pet. denied). Generally, sexual harassment claims take one\nof two forms: (1) quid pro quo harassment, in which employment benefits are\nconditioned on sexual favors, and (2) harassment that creates a hostile or offensive\nwork environment. Hoffman-La Roche Inc. v. Zeltwanger, 144 S.W.3d 438, 445\nn.5 (Tex. 2004). To establish that a hostile work environment existed, the plaintiff\nmust show that the sexual harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter\nthe conditions of the plaintiff’s employment and to create an abusive working\n\n\n                                          5\n\fenvironment. Meritor Sav. Bank, 477 U.S. at 67; Waffle House, Inc. v. Williams,\n313 S.W.3d 796, 805–06 (Tex. 2010).\n        Lucan asserted a claim for retaliation under Section 21.055 of the TCHRA.\nSection 21.055 provides that “[a]n employer…commits an unlawful employment\npractice if the employer…retaliates or discriminates against a person who, under\nthis chapter: (1) opposes a discriminatory practice; (2) makes or files a charge; (3)\nfiles a complaint; or (4) testifies, assists, or participates in any manner in an\ninvestigation, proceeding, or hearing.” LABOR § 21.055.\n        Discrimination claims and retaliation claims can be proven by direct or\ncircumstantial evidence. Quantum Chem. Corp., 47 S.W.3d at 476–77; Crutcher v.\nDallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 410 S.W.3d 487, 493 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, no pet.).\nIn this case, Lucan acknowledges that her retaliation claim is based on\ncircumstantial evidence.           In the absence of direct evidence of retaliation, the\nemployee must make out a prima facie case of retaliation under the McDonnell\nDouglas burden-shifting analysis. 4 Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod., Inc., 530\nU.S. 133, 142 (2000); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802–05\n(1973); Crutcher, 410 S.W.3d at 493.\n        To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the TCHRA, a plaintiff\nmust show (1) that she engaged in a protected activity listed in Section 21.055 of\nthe Labor Code, (2) that an adverse employment action occurred, and (3) that a\ncausal link existed between her participation in the protected activity and the\nadverse employment action. 5 Pineda v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 360 F.3d 483,\n\n        4\n          Reviewing courts apply the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis to discrimination and\nretaliation cases that have not been fully tried on the merits. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Canchola, 121\nS.W.3d 735, 739 (Tex. 2003). When a case has been fully tried on the merits, reviewing courts do not\nengage in the burden-shifting analysis but, instead, determine whether the evidence is legally sufficient to\nsupport the jury’s ultimate finding. Id.\n        5\n        If a plaintiff meets her burden to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to\nthe employer to demonstrate a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the adverse employment action.\n\n                                                     6\n\f487 (5th Cir. 2004); Crutcher, 410 S.W.3d at 493; Dias v. Goodman Mfg. Co., 214\nS.W.3d 672, 676 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied).                                  The\nprotected activities under Section 21.055 consist of (1) opposing a discriminatory\npractice; (2) making or filing a charge; (3) filing a complaint; or (4) testifying,\nassisting, or participating in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or\nhearing. LABOR § 21.055; Dias, 214 S.W.3d at 676.\n        As stated above, Lucan alleged in her petition that “[HSS] retaliated and/or\ndiscriminated against [her] for her opposition to discriminatory practices, including\nbut not limited to her opposition to a work environment made hostile based on\nsex.” HSS moved for no-evidence summary judgment on the ground, among\nothers, that Lucan could not establish a prima facie case of retaliation because she\nhad no evidence that she engaged in a protected activity. In response, Lucan\nasserted that her oral and written reports to her superiors at HSS about her\ncoworkers’ “offensive sexual conduct” were protected activities under Section\n21.055 of the TCHRA because the reports constituted opposition to a\ndiscriminatory practice and the filing of a complaint.\n        Lucan presented an affidavit in support of her response to HSS’s motion for\nsummary judgment. In her affidavit, Lucan described the “sexual conduct” that\nshe had witnessed, and she also stated that she had reported the conduct orally and\nin writing to HSS, as follows:\n              In approximately May of 2008, I was working the graveyard\n        shift when I had to make some copies. When I entered the copier\n        room, I saw two co-workers engaged in sexual conduct with each\n\nFOOTNOTE NO. 5 CONTINUED:\nRaggs v. Miss. Power & Light Co., 278 F.3d 463, 468 (5th Cir. 2002); Crutcher, 410 S.W.3d at 493;\nDias, 214 S.W.3d at 676. If the employer meets this burden, then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to\npresent proof that the employer’s stated reason for the adverse action was pretextual. Pineda, 360 F.3d at\n487; Crutcher, 410 S.W.3d at 493. To meet this burden, the plaintiff must rebut each nondiscriminatory\nor nonretaliatory reason articulated by the employer. McCoy v. City of Shreveport, 492 F.3d 551, 557\n(5th Cir. 2007); Crutcher, 410 S.W.3d at 493.\n\n                                                    7\n\fother. Specifically, I saw a female employee named Corina . . .\nstanding at the copy machine while a male LVN named Josh . . . was\nstanding behind her. Josh was a popular and well-liked member of\nthe staff. Josh pushed his groin into Corina’s rear end hard and\ngyrated his hips while rubbing his hands up and down Corina’s thighs.\nIn response, Corina pushed her rear-end out and pressed it against\nJosh’s groin while smiling. This kind of behavior in public, especially\nin a hospital, upset and offended me and made me extremely\nuncomfortable. It was so upsetting that I had difficulty concentrating\non my job. I was especially upset because Corina was married and\nJosh was engaged to be married. I was also upset because this\nbehavior violated the company’s harassment policy, which prohibits\nphysical conduct of a sexual nature, especially where it creates an\noffensive working environment.\n\n       Since I knew about sexual misconduct in the workplace, I had a\nduty to report it and could get in trouble if I did not report it. So, I\nmade an oral complaint that same night to my Team Lead Tammy (I\ndon’t remember her last name). The next day, I made the same oral\ncomplaint by phone to Director Jane Heckler. I don’t recall the exact\nlanguage I used, but in each instance I described what I saw generally\n(for example, that Josh’s hands were all over Corina’s rear end and he\nwas gyrating and grinding into her from behind), expressed that it\nbothered me, and indicated that something should be done to make\nsure that kind of conduct stopped. I will refer to this as “my oral\ncomplaint.”\n\n      ....\n\n      On approximately March 20, 2009, I emailed Ms. Long a\nrequest for transfer and a supporting statement. A true and correct\ncopy of that email is attached and incorporated by reference as\nExhibit A-1, and I will refer to it in this affidavit as “my written\ncomplaint.” My written complaint began, “Approximately in May,\n2008, I witnessed a sexual behavior between nurse, Josh (LVN) and\nmy co-worker (Corina) who is no longer in the department. I reported\nit to my Director, Jane Heckler and my team lead, Tammy, who is\nalso no longer with the company.”\n\n\n\n                                   8\n\f      During her deposition, Lucan testified about the incident that involved Josh\nand Corina. According to her testimony, Lucan was headed to the copy machine to\nmake copies and, when “[s]he came around the corner,” she saw Josh and Corina\nstanding at the copy machine. Lucan said that “Josh was behind [Corina] with his\nhands on [Corina’s] buttocks and gyrating into her backside.” Lucan observed the\nconduct for “a couple of seconds” and immediately left the area because she was\nembarrassed. Lucan testified that the May 2008 incident that involved Josh and\nCorina was the only incident of sexual conduct or sexual misbehavior that she\nwitnessed while she was employed by HSS at the medical center.\n      Lucan contends in her brief that her oral and written reports to her superiors\nat HSS about her coworkers’ “offensive sexual conduct” constituted opposition to\na discriminatory practice and the filing of a complaint under Sections 21.055(1)\nand (3) of the TCHRA. Therefore, Lucan contends that she engaged in protected\nactivity when she reported the offensive sexual conduct.\n      For an employee to establish that she opposed a discriminatory practice, the\nemployee must demonstrate that she had a good faith, reasonable belief that her\nemployer engaged in a discriminatory practice that was prohibited by the law.\nCox & Smith Inc. v. Cook, 974 S.W.2d 217, 224 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1998,\npet. denied); see Payne v. McLemore’s Wholesale & Retail Stores, 654 F.2d 1130,\n1140–41 (5th Cir. 1981). Engaging in protected activity requires a complaint of\nsome sort of discrimination that is covered by the TCHRA. Spinks v. Trugreen\nLandcare, L.L.C., 322 F. Supp. 2d 784, 796 (S.D. Tex. 2004). The employee is not\nrequired to show that an unlawful practice actually existed but, instead, must only\nshow that she held a good faith, reasonable belief that the employer engaged in\nactivity made unlawful by Title VII or the TCHRA. Cox & Smith, 974 S.W.2d at\n224. A reasonable belief consists of subjective and objective components. Id. at\n225. First, a plaintiff must establish that she subjectively, in good faith, believed\n                                         9\n\fthat her employer was engaged in unlawful employment practices. Id. at 225–26.\nSecond, she must establish that her belief was objectively reasonable in light of the\nfacts presented. Id.\n      The summary judgment evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to\nLucan, shows that Lucan briefly witnessed a single, isolated incident of sexual\nconduct between two of her coworkers. Thus, the complained of conduct was not\nsevere or pervasive in the workplace. Lucan reported the incident to her superiors\nat HSS. The fact that Lucan’s coworkers engaged in sexual conduct provides no\nsupport for a belief that HSS engaged in a discriminatory practice, such as sexual\nharassment, under the TCHRA. Lucan’s reports to her superiors centered on her\ncoworkers’ conduct toward each other. In the reports, Lucan did not claim that her\nemployer, HSS, had engaged in any form of discriminatory conduct against her or\nanyone else. We conclude that, based on the evidence, Lucan could not have held\na good faith, reasonable belief that HSS had engaged in an unlawful discriminatory\npractice prohibited in the TCHRA.\n      In Arora v. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., the Fifth Circuit\nheld that an employee’s report to his supervisors that two managers were engaging\nin sexual behavior did not constitute a protected activity under Title VII or Section\n21.055 of the TCHRA. 294 F. App’x 159, 162 (5th Cir. 2008). In Arora, the trial\ncourt granted summary judgment to the employer on the employee’s retaliation\nclaim. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the summary judgment. Id.\n      In Arora, the Fifth Circuit recognized that “[b]oth Title VII and the\n[TCHRA] prohibit discrimination against employees who have opposed an\nunlawful employment practice, or made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated\nin an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the employment practices\nstatute.” Id. The court concluded that the employee had failed to establish a prima\nfacie case of retaliation because he had not raised a genuine issue of material fact\n                                         10\n\fas to whether he engaged in a protected activity. Id. The court explained the\nrationale for its holding as follows:\n      [The employee] alleges he told supervisors that an employee was\n      drinking at the bar without paying and that two managers were\n      engaging in sexually provocative behavior. While ungainly, the\n      complained about behavior does not involve an employee being\n      treated unfairly due to race or sex, thus the complaints are not\n      protected activity.\n\nId. Likewise, in this case, Lucan’s coworkers’ offensive sexual conduct did not\ninvolve Lucan or any other employee being treated unfairly due to sex or any other\nunlawful employment practice. Thus, Lucan’s reports to her superiors about the\nsexual conduct did not constitute a protected activity under the TCHRA.\n      Lucan relies on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Lane, 31 S.W.3d 282 (Tex. App.—\nCorpus Christi 2000, pet. denied). In Lane, the court held that an employee, Lane,\nengaged in protected activity under Section 21.055 of the TCHRA when he\nreported to his employer’s district manager that a female employee, Sparks, was\nspreading “sexual rumors” about Lane to other coworkers and that the rumors were\nmaking Lane feel uncomfortable in the workplace and interfering with his work.\nLane, 31 S.W.3d at 296. The court explained that the context of the rumors was\nthat Lane had made unwelcome sexual advances toward Sparks. Id. Lane learned\nabout the alleged rumors from coworkers. Id. The court concluded that, based on\nwhat Lane had learned from his coworkers, Lane had a reasonable belief that\nSparks was sexually harassing him and that, therefore, Lane’s report to the district\nmanager constituted protected activity as a complaint under Section 21.055(3) of\nthe TCHRA. Id.\n      This case is distinguishable from Lane. Here, the coworkers’ conduct was\nnot directed toward Lucan. Lucan saw her coworkers engaging in sexual conduct\nwhen she entered the copy room, and she immediately left the room when she saw\n\n                                        11\n\fher coworkers. Lucan did not see her coworkers engage in sexual conduct on any\nother occasion. Lucan’s coworkers did not engage in any conduct that would have\ngiven Lucan a reasonable belief that they were sexually harassing her.\n      Lucan also contends that she engaged in protected activity because she\nreported conduct that constituted sexual harassment under HSS’s Equal\nEmployment Opportunity/Harassment Policy. HSS’s policy prohibited “any form\nof unlawful employee harassment based on race, color, religion, gender, national\norigin, age, disability or status in any group protected by state or local law.” The\npolicy provided that “[e]ach member of management is responsible for creating an\natmosphere free of discrimination and harassment, sexual or otherwise.” With\nrespect to sexual harassment, the policy prohibited, among other things,\n“[u]nwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and all other verbal or\nphysical conduct of a sexual or otherwise offensive nature, especially where . . .\n[s]uch conduct has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or\noffensive working environment.”\n      Lucan contends in her brief that her coworkers engaged in “physical conduct\nof a sexual or otherwise offensive nature,” which constituted sexual harassment\nunder the policy. Lucan states in her brief that “[HSS] cannot reasonably contend\nthat the conduct of which [Lucan] complained constituted sexual harassment under\nthe company’s own harassment policy and at the same time argue that [Lucan]\ncould not as a matter of law hold a good faith reasonable belief that the conduct\nconstituted sexual harassment.”     However, even if the conduct of Lucan’s\ncoworkers fell within the definition of sexual harassment under the policy, that\nconduct would not have given Lucan any reason to believe that HSS was engaging\nin unlawful discrimination against her or any other employee.\n       Because Lucan did not present summary judgment evidence that she\nengaged in a protected activity under Section 21.055 of the TCHRA, she failed to\n                                        12\n\festablish a prima facie case of retaliation. Therefore, the trial court did not err\nwhen it granted a no-evidence summary judgment to HSS or when it failed to grant\nLucan’s motion for new trial. In view of our holding, we need not address the\nother arguments raised by Lucan in her sole issue, and her issue is overruled.\n      We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    JIM R.

In her sole appellate issue, Lucan contends that she presented\nmore than a scintilla of evidence on each element of her retaliation claim against\nHSS under Section 21.055 of the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act\n\f(TCHRA) 1 and that she presented more than a scintilla of evidence that HSS’s\nstated reason for her termination—that she failed to meet a numerical productivity\nstandard—was a mere pretext for retaliation. Based on these contentions, Lucan\nasserts that the trial court erred when it granted HSS’s motion for summary\njudgment on both traditional and no-evidence grounds and when it failed to grant\nher motion for new trial. We affirm.\n       In November 2007, Lucan began employment with HSS as a registrar at\nSt. David’s South Austin Medical Center in Austin. As a registrar, Lucan had the\nresponsibility to register patients at the hospital. Lucan’s job duties required her to\nobtain necessary information from patients and to verify the patients’ insurance\ncoverage. On April 1, 2009, HSS terminated Lucan’s employment.\n       In June 2010, Lucan filed suit against HSS.                   Lucan alleged that, “[i]n\napproximately May of 2008, [she] was subjected to sexual misconduct in the\nworkplace involving two co-workers.” Lucan further alleged that, “[s]pecifically,\na female employee named [Corina]2 S. (Defendants know her last name) was\nstanding at a copy machine one night making copies while a male LVN named\nJosh C. (Defendants know his last name) was standing behind her”; that “Josh\npushed his groin into [Corina’s] rear end hard and gyrated his hips while rubbing\nhis hands up and down [Corina’s] thighs”; and that, “[i]n response, [Corina]\npushed her rear-end out and pressed it against Josh’s groin while smiling.”\n\n\n\n       1\n         Section 21.055 is found in Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code. See TEX. LABOR CODE ANN. §\n21.055 (West 2006). Courts refer to Chapter 21 of the Labor Code as the Texas Commission on Human\nRights Act. Prairie View A & M Univ. v.

Lucan further alleged that she\nmade a written report on March 20, 2009, to Human Resources Manager Stephanie\nLong about the same offensive sexual conduct. In the writing, Lucan stated that,\n“[a]pproximately in May, 2008, I witnessed a sexual behavior between nurse, Josh\n(LVN) and my co-worker (Corina) who is no longer in the department.” Lucan\nalleged that, as a result of her reports about the offensive sexual conduct, she was\nsubjected to numerous adverse employment actions, including her termination\nfrom employment.\n      Lucan alleged that HSS retaliated and discriminated against her in violation\nof Section 21.055 of the TCHRA.         Specifically, Lucan alleged that “[HSS]\nretaliated and/or discriminated against [her] for her opposition to discriminatory\npractices, including but not limited to her opposition to a work environment made\nhostile based on sex.” Lucan also alleged that the retaliation included, but was not\nlimited to, “offensive statements, offensive physical contact, unfounded written\nreprimands, unfounded Performance Improvement Plans, the denial of a transfer,\nand the decision to fire [her].”\n      HSS filed a combined traditional and no-evidence motion for summary\njudgment based on the grounds that Lucan had no evidence or insufficient\nevidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact on any of the three elements of a\nprima facie case of retaliation or on the issue of whether Lucan’s termination was a\npretext for retaliation. Lucan filed a response to the motion. Following a hearing,\nthe trial court entered an order in which it granted the motion. Lucan filed a\nmotion for new trial. The motion was overruled by operation of law.\n      We review a summary judgment de novo. Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp\nAdvisors, Inc. v.

City of Shreveport, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1446555\"><a href=\"/opinion/1446555/mccoy-v-city-of-shreveport/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 557\n(5th Cir. 2007); Crutcher, 410 S.W.3d at 493.\n\n                                                    7\n\fother. Specifically, I saw a female employee named Corina . . .\nstanding at the copy machine while a male LVN named Josh . . . was\nstanding behind her. Josh was a popular and well-liked member of\nthe staff. Josh pushed his groin into Corina’s rear end hard and\ngyrated his hips while rubbing his hands up and down Corina’s thighs.\nIn response, Corina pushed her rear-end out and pressed it against\nJosh’s groin while smiling. This kind of behavior in public, especially\nin a hospital, upset and offended me and made me extremely\nuncomfortable. It was so upsetting that I had difficulty concentrating\non my job. I was especially upset because Corina was married and\nJosh was engaged to be married. I was also upset because this\nbehavior violated the company’s harassment policy, which prohibits\nphysical conduct of a sexual nature, especially where it creates an\noffensive working environment.\n\n       Since I knew about sexual misconduct in the workplace, I had a\nduty to report it and could get in trouble if I did not report it. So, I\nmade an oral complaint that same night to my Team Lead Tammy (I\ndon’t remember her last name). The next day, I made the same oral\ncomplaint by phone to Director Jane Heckler. I don’t recall the exact\nlanguage I used, but in each instance I described what I saw generally\n(for example, that Josh’s hands were all over Corina’s rear end and he\nwas gyrating and grinding into her from behind), expressed that it\nbothered me, and indicated that something should be done to make\nsure that kind of conduct stopped. I will refer to this as “my oral\ncomplaint.”\n\n      ....\n\n      On approximately March 20, 2009, I emailed Ms. Long a\nrequest for transfer and a supporting statement. A true and correct\ncopy of that email is attached and incorporated by reference as\nExhibit A-1, and I will refer to it in this affidavit as “my written\ncomplaint.” My written complaint began, “Approximately in May,\n2008, I witnessed a sexual behavior between nurse, Josh (LVN) and\nmy co-worker (Corina) who is no longer in the department. I reported\nit to my Director, Jane Heckler and my team lead, Tammy, who is\nalso no longer with the company.”\n\n\n\n                                   8\n\f      During her deposition, Lucan testified about the incident that involved Josh\nand Corina. According to her testimony, Lucan was headed to the copy machine to\nmake copies and, when “[s]he came around the corner,” she saw Josh and Corina\nstanding at the copy machine. Lucan said that “Josh was behind [Corina] with his\nhands on [Corina’s] buttocks and gyrating into her backside.” Lucan observed the\nconduct for “a couple of seconds” and immediately left the area because she was\nembarrassed. Lucan testified that the May 2008 incident that involved Josh and\nCorina was the only incident of sexual conduct or sexual misbehavior that she\nwitnessed while she was employed by HSS at the medical center.\n      Lucan contends in her brief that her oral and written reports to her superiors\nat HSS about her coworkers’ “offensive sexual conduct” constituted opposition to\na discriminatory practice and the filing of a complaint under Sections 21.055(1)\nand (3) of the TCHRA. Therefore, Lucan contends that she engaged in protected\nactivity when she reported the offensive sexual conduct.\n      For an employee to establish that she opposed a discriminatory practice, the\nemployee must demonstrate that she had a good faith, reasonable belief that her\nemployer engaged in a discriminatory practice that was prohibited by the law.\nCox & Smith Inc. v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 796 (S.D. Tex. 2004). The employee is not\nrequired to show that an unlawful practice actually existed but, instead, must only\nshow that she held a good faith, reasonable belief that the employer engaged in\nactivity made unlawful by Title VII or the TCHRA. Cox & Smith, 974 S.W.2d at\n224. A reasonable belief consists of subjective and objective components. Id. at\n225. First, a plaintiff must establish that she subjectively, in good faith, believed\n                                         9\n\fthat her employer was engaged in unlawful employment practices. Id. at 225–26.\nSecond, she must establish that her belief was objectively reasonable in light of the\nfacts presented. Id.\n      The summary judgment evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to\nLucan, shows that Lucan briefly witnessed a single, isolated incident of sexual\nconduct between two of her coworkers. Thus, the complained of conduct was not\nsevere or pervasive in the workplace. Lucan reported the incident to her superiors\nat HSS. The fact that Lucan’s coworkers engaged in sexual conduct provides no\nsupport for a belief that HSS engaged in a discriminatory practice, such as sexual\nharassment, under the TCHRA. Lucan’s reports to her superiors centered on her\ncoworkers’ conduct toward each other. In the reports, Lucan did not claim that her\nemployer, HSS, had engaged in any form of discriminatory conduct against her or\nanyone else. We conclude that, based on the evidence, Lucan could not have held\na good faith, reasonable belief that HSS had engaged in an unlawful discriminatory\npractice prohibited in the TCHRA.\n      In Arora v. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., the Fifth Circuit\nheld that an employee’s report to his supervisors that two managers were engaging\nin sexual behavior did not constitute a protected activity under Title VII or Section\n21.055 of the TCHRA. 294 F. App’x 159, 162 (5th Cir. 2008). In Arora, the trial\ncourt granted summary judgment to the employer on the employee’s retaliation\nclaim. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the summary judgment. Id.\n      In Arora, the Fifth Circuit recognized that “[b]oth Title VII and the\n[TCHRA] prohibit discrimination against employees who have opposed an\nunlawful employment practice, or made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated\nin an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the employment practices\nstatute.” Id. The court concluded that the employee had failed to establish a prima\nfacie case of retaliation because he had not raised a genuine issue of material fact\n                                         10\n\fas to whether he engaged in a protected activity. Id. The court explained the\nrationale for its holding as follows:\n      [The employee] alleges he told supervisors that an employee was\n      drinking at the bar without paying and that two managers were\n      engaging in sexually provocative behavior. While ungainly, the\n      complained about behavior does not involve an employee being\n      treated unfairly due to race or sex, thus the complaints are not\n      protected activity.\n\nId. Likewise, in this case, Lucan’s coworkers’ offensive sexual conduct did not\ninvolve Lucan or any other employee being treated unfairly due to sex or any other\nunlawful employment practice. Thus, Lucan’s reports to her superiors about the\nsexual conduct did not constitute a protected activity under the TCHRA.\n      Lucan relies on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Lane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1664221\"><a href=\"/opinion/1664221/wal-mart-stores-inc-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.—\nCorpus Christi 2000, pet. denied). In Lane, the court held that an employee, Lane,\nengaged in protected activity under Section 21.055 of the TCHRA when he\nreported to his employer’s district manager that a female employee, Sparks, was\nspreading “sexual rumors” about Lane to other coworkers and that the rumors were\nmaking Lane feel uncomfortable in the workplace and interfering with his work.\nLane, 31 S.W.3d at 296. The court explained that the context of the rumors was\nthat Lane had made unwelcome sexual advances toward Sparks. Id. Lane learned\nabout the alleged rumors from coworkers. Id. The court concluded that, based on\nwhat Lane had learned from his coworkers, Lane had a reasonable belief that\nSparks was sexually harassing him and that, therefore, Lane’s report to the district\nmanager constituted protected activity as a complaint under Section 21.055(3) of\nthe TCHRA. Id.\n      This case is distinguishable from Lane. Here, the coworkers’ conduct was\nnot directed toward Lucan. Lucan saw her coworkers engaging in sexual conduct\nwhen she entered the copy room, and she immediately left the room when she saw\n\n                                        11\n\fher coworkers. Lucan did not see her coworkers engage in sexual conduct on any\nother occasion. Lucan’s coworkers did not engage in any conduct that would have\ngiven Lucan a reasonable belief that they were sexually harassing her.\n      Lucan also contends that she engaged in protected activity because she\nreported conduct that constituted sexual harassment under HSS’s Equal\nEmployment Opportunity/Harassment Policy. HSS’s policy prohibited “any form\nof unlawful employee harassment based on race, color, religion, gender, national\norigin, age, disability or status in any group protected by state or local law.” The\npolicy provided that “[e]ach member of management is responsible for creating an\natmosphere free of discrimination and harassment, sexual or otherwise.” With\nrespect to sexual harassment, the policy prohibited, among other things,\n“[u]nwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and all other verbal or\nphysical conduct of a sexual or otherwise offensive nature, especially where . . .\n[s]uch conduct has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or\noffensive working environment.”\n      Lucan contends in her brief that her coworkers engaged in “physical conduct\nof a sexual or otherwise offensive nature,” which constituted sexual harassment\nunder the policy. Lucan states in her brief that “[HSS] cannot reasonably contend\nthat the conduct of which [Lucan] complained constituted sexual harassment under\nthe company’s own harassment policy and at the same time argue that [Lucan]\ncould not as a matter of law hold a good faith reasonable belief that the conduct\nconstituted sexual harassment.”     However, even if the conduct of Lucan’s\ncoworkers fell within the definition of sexual harassment under the policy, that\nconduct would not have given Lucan any reason to believe that HSS was engaging\nin unlawful discrimination against her or any other employee.\n       Because Lucan did not present summary judgment evidence that she\nengaged in a protected activity under Section 21.055 of the TCHRA, she failed to\n                                        12\n\festablish a prima facie case of retaliation. Therefore, the trial court did not err\nwhen it granted a no-evidence summary judgment to HSS or when it failed to grant\nLucan’s motion for new trial. In view of our holding, we need not address the\nother arguments raised by Lucan in her sole issue, and her issue is overruled.\n      We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    JIM R.
