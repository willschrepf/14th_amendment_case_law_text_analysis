(CR 1-5). The Hoseks\n                                      requested construction of a deed of partition\n                                      to determine whether they owned all or half\n                                      of the minerals under their land in Atascosa\n                                      County.     (CR 75-77). Partial summary\n                                      judgment was granted in favor of Ms. Scott\n                                      owning an undivided one-half interest in the\n                                      minerals under the Hoseks’ land. (Supp. CR\n                                      89-90). A hearing was held on the issue of\n                                      attorneys’ fees, (RR 1-60), after which Judge\n                                      Shannon awarded Ms. Scott attorneys’ fees\n                                      of $39,500, plus $2,500 if a Motion for New\n                                      Trial was filed, 12,500 for appeal to this\n                                      court, $3,500 if petition for review was filed,\n                                      and $12,500 if the petition was granted. (CR\n                                      208-213). Final Judgment was June 19,\n                                      2014. (CR 212).\n\nPost-trial and appeal:                Finding of Facts and Conclusions of Law\n                                      were requested. (CR 227). The Hoseks filed\n                                      a Motion for New Trial. (CR 248-250). The\n                                      Court made Findings of Fact only as to attor-\n                                      ney fees. (CR 345; 405-12). Notice of\n                                      Appeal was filed on June 19, 2014.

However, if Ms. Scott is granted oral\n\nargument, the Hoseks wish to be allowed to argue.\n\n\n                                         vi\n\f                               ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n       The trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Ms. Scott\nbecause the partition deed is ambiguous and summary judgment evidence establishes\nthat a genuine issue of fact exists whether the minerals reverted to the surface owner\nafter the expiration of 25 years and cessation of production.1\n      This summary judgment was harmful error because the partition deed is\nambiguous and summary judgment evidence conclusively establishes that the\nminerals reverted to the surface owner after the expiration of 25 years and cessation\nof production.\n       The trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys’ fees because both\nsides benefitted equally from an interpretation of the deed and an award to Ms. Scott\nwas not fair and equitable.\n       The trial court abused its discretion in allowing the possibility of forcing the\nHoseks to pay the costs of unnecessary and irrelevant documents which were\nincluded in the record at the demand of Ms. Scott’s counsel merely to raise the cost\nof the appeal for the Hoseks.\n\n\n\n\n1\n There was no actual production during the twenty-five year period to extend the\nagreement not to partition.\n                                          vii\n\f                          No. 04-14-00655-CV\n\n                     On Appeal to the Fourth Court of Appeals\n                               San Antonio, Texas\n\n\n                            Ivarene and Victor Hosek,\n                                   Appellants\n\n                                        v.\n\n                                  Rosale Scott,\n                                   Appellee\n\n\nOn Appeal from the 81st Judicial District Court of Atascosa County, Texas, Trial\n     Court No. 13-06-0559-CVA, the Honorable Fred Shannon, Presiding\n\n\nTO THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS:\n      COME NOW, IVARENE and VICTOR HOSEK, and file this, their\n\nAppellants’ Brief in the above-referenced case. The Hoseks will show as follows:\n\n\n                           STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      On October 4, 1978, Fridolin Alex Voigt and his wife, Pearl Schnautz Voigt,\n\ndeeded the family farm to their children, Ivarene Voigt Hosek (and her husband\n\nVictor) and Rosale Voigt Scott, in equal undivided shares. (Supp CR 16; 45). The\n\nHoseks and Ms. Scott then partitioned the tract, but made an agreement not to\n\npartition the minerals for twenty-five years or so long as production continued.\n                                        1\n\f(Supp. CR 19-24; 45). Because the twenty-five years started with the present, the\n\npartition deed did not partition the minerals, and they were severed from the surface\n\nestate. (Supp. CR 20-22). The partition read as follows:\n\n      “This partition does not include any of the oil, gas, or other minerals in, on\n      or under the above described tract of land, and same are to remain undivided\n      for a period of twenty-five years from the date hereof and as long thereafter\n      as oil, gas, or other minerals are produced in paying quantities from the above\n      described lands.”\n\n(Supp. CR 20-22). The deed was unclear what happened to the minerals after the\n\ntwenty-five years was up. The intent of the deed was clearly a partition of interests,\n\n(Supp. CR 19-24), yet did the statement that the partition did not include the minerals\n\njust mean that the minerals were not partitioned during the time the parties had\n\nagreed to not partition them, or did it leave them unpartitioned forever? And if they\n\nwere left unpartitioned forever, why was a twenty-five year period mentioned,\n\ninstead of just saying that the deed did not partition the minerals? This was an\n\nambiguity that would much later cause an oil company landman to send a quit claim\n\ndeed to Ms. Scott for signature, and begin this lawsuit, but up until the quit claim\n\ndeed, the parties treated the minerals in similar fashion.\n\n      After the twenty-five years had passed, (in 2004), both parties treated the land\n\nas though the minerals had reverted to the respective surface owners. Ms. Scott sold\n\nparts of her property to the Moraleses in 1986, (Supp. CR 28), and to the Kings in\n\n1990. (Supp. CR 31). She told the buyers that they would own the 50% of the\n\n\n                                           2\n\fminerals owned by the Hoseks under Ms. Scott’s tract after the twenty-five years\n\nexpired. (Supp. CR 49, 62, 64, and 78). The buyers paid Ms. Scott, not Ms. Hosek,\n\nfor the minerals. (Supp. CR 50). Ms. Scott even asked the Hoseks to ignore the\n\nagreement to not partition and have the minerals revert to the surface owner before\n\nthe twenty-five years were up so that she could please her buyer and convey 100%\n\nof the minerals immediately. (Supp. CR 73-76). There are even current wells pooled\n\nwith the land Ms. Scott sold, and the Hoseks are not getting paid any royalties on the\n\nhydrocarbons produced, because all parties have treated the minerals as reverting to\n\nthe surface owner. Only when oil was found on the Hoseks’ land, and an oilman\n\nasked Ms. Scott to sign a quit claim deed to cure the ambiguity in the poorly-drafted\n\nPartition Deed did Ms. Scott make her claim. (Supp. CR 50).\n\n\n\n\n                          SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      The Partition Deed at the heart of this case, (Supp. CR 19-24), is ambiguous\n\nbecause it does not say what happens to the minerals after a twenty-five year\n\nagreement not to petition and two possibilities are valid: (1), the Partition is\n\ncompleted and the minerals revert to the surface owner, or (2) the minerals stay\n\nunpartitioned forever. The trial court erred in saying the deed was unambiguous.\n\nThis brief discusses the many rules of contract interpretation which cause the deed\n\nto be ambiguous.\n                                          3\n\f      Subsequent treatment of the minerals by the parties before the conflict arose\n\nprovides airtight proof as to what the parties intended. Ms. Scott told two buyers for\n\nher land that the minerals would revert to the surface owner, and after the twenty-\n\nfive years were up, they would own the minerals. Ms. Scott attempted to bring to a\n\nclose the agreement not to partition the minerals before the twenty-five years were\n\nup, so as to give what was the temporarily the Hosek’s minerals to the buyer\n\nimmediately. If the minerals did not revert to the surface owners, Ms. Scott has sold\n\nthe Hosek’s minerals under Ms. Scott’s land without paying the Hoseks for them,\n\nand there are now wells pooled on that land that the Hoseks also aren’t getting paid\n\nfor. The landmen for current wells believe that the Hoseks own all the minerals\n\nunder their tract and the buyers own all the minerals under Ms. Scott’s tract. They\n\nonly gave Ms. Scott a quit claim deed to sign because the deed was ambiguous. The\n\ntrial court’s summary judgment should be reversed and the Hoseks found to own the\n\nminerals (100%) under their land.\n\n      Both parties needed this ambiguous deed interpreted, so attorneys’ fees should\n\nnot have been awarded to either side. Such was not equitable and just.\n\n      The costs of an unnecessarily-long Clerk’s Record requested by Ms. Scott’s\n\ncounsel should not be assessed against the Hoseks. This point is not moot because\n\nthe appellate court could still do this, and such would not be just and equitable.\n\nExpanding the record beyond what was proper was just one of the many techniques\n                                          4\n\fof gamesmanship Ms. Scott’s counsel used to make the appeal cost the Hoseks more\n\nthan it should.\n\n\n                           ARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES\n\nARGUMENT ON FIRST & SECOND ISSUES\n\n        The trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Ms. Scott\n        because the partition deed is ambiguous and summary judgment evidence\n        establishes that a genuine issue of fact exists whether the minerals reverted\n        to the surface owner after the expiration of 25 years and cessation of produc-\n        tion.2\n\n        and\n\n        This summary judgment was harmful error because the partition deed is\n        ambiguous and summary judgment evidence conclusively establishes that\n        the minerals reverted to the surface owner after the expiration of 25 years\n        and cessation of production.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW ON FIRST AND SECOND ISSUES\n\n        To prevail on a summary judgment, the movant is required to prove that there\n\nis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that movant is entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166(a). The appellate court reviews the trial court’s\n\ngrant of a summary judgment de novo. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. Knott,\n\n128 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex. 2003). In reviewing a summary judgment, the Court\n\n\n\n2\n    Again, noting that there was no production during the twenty-five years.\n                                           5\n\fmust accept as true evidence favoring the non-movant, indulging in every reasonable\n\ninference and resolving all doubts in the non-movant’s favor. Park Place Hosp. v.\n\nEstate of Milo, 909 S.W.2d 508, 510 (Tex. 1995); Western Invs. v. Urena, 162\n\nS.W.3d 547, 550 (Tex. 2005).\n\n      When an instrument is unambiguous, and the dispositive facts are not in\n\ndispute, a court may grant summary judgment and render a declaratory judgment\n\nregarding the parties’ rights under the instrument. Berrand, Inc. v. Whataburger,\n\nInc., 214 S.W.3d 122, 131-32 (Tex. App – Corpus Christi 2006, pet denied); T C\n\nDallas #1, LP v. Republic Underwriters Ins. Co., 316 S.W.3d 832, 837 (Tex. App.\n\n– Dallas 2010, no pet.). Extrinsic evidence of intent is admissible if the deed is\n\nambiguous on its face. Friendswood Dev. Co. v. McDade & Co., 926 S.W.2d 280,\n\n283 (Tex. 1996).\n\nARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES:\n\n      In construing a written agreement, we must ascertain and give effect to the\n\nparties’ intentions as expressed in the agreement. Terrill v. Tuckness, 985 S.W.2d\n\n97, 101 (Tex. App. – San Antonio 1998, no pet.). The Hoseks believe that the\n\nPartition Deed is ambiguous. (Supp. CR 21-22). Deciding whether a deed is\n\nambiguous is a question of law for the courts. J.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster, 128\n\nS.W.3d 223, 229 (Tex. 2003).      The court may look to principles of contract\n\ninterpretation to determine whether a deed term is ambiguous. Brown v. Havard,\n\n                                         6\n\f593 S.W.2d 939, 942 (Tex. 1980). A deed term is not ambiguous because of a simple\n\nlack of clarity. DeWitt Cty. Elec. Co-Op, Inc. v. Parks, 18 S.W.3d 96, 100 (Tex.\n\n1999). A deed term is not ambiguous simply because the parties disagree on its\n\nmeaning. Houchins v. Devon Energy Prod. Co., LP, No. 01-08-00273-CV, 2009\n\nTex. App. LEXIS 8064 (Tex. App. – Houston [1st Dist.] Oct. 15, 2009, pet denied).\n\nAn ambiguity arises only after the application of established rules of construction\n\nleave a deed susceptible to more than one meaning. Id.; Universal C.I.T. Credit\n\nCorp. v. Daniel, 243 S.W.2d 154 (Tex. 1951). For an ambiguity to exist, both\n\npotential meanings must be reasonable. Id.\n\n      The conflict over the interpretation of the Partition Deed arises out of the\n\nfailure of the document to state what will occur after the expiration of the twenty-\n\nfive year period and cessation of production. (Supp. CR 21-22, infra, pg. 2). Either\n\nthe mineral rights revert to the surface owner or they do not. The conflict also arises\n\nas to whether the phrase, “This partition does not include any of the oil, gas, or other\n\nminerals in, on or under the above described tract of land…” stands on its own, to\n\nleave the minerals undivided until another act partitions them, or whether it is over-\n\nriding that this phrase is joined with the conjunction “and” with “same are to remain\n\nundivided for a period of twenty-five years…” to mean that the minerals are\n\nundivided only for the twenty-five years set out in the same sentence.\n\n      Arguing for ambiguity are the following principles of deed interpretation:\n\n\n                                           7\n\f(1) Texas courts apply the “four corners” rule, Luckel v. White, 819 S.W.2d\n\n   459 (Tex. 1991), and (a) look not at isolated terms but consider the\n\n   instrument as a whole, (b) to convey on the grantee the greatest estate that\n\n   the terms of the deed will permit. Plainsman Trading Co. v. Crews, 898\n\n   S.W.2d 786, 789 (Tex. 1995); Thomason v. Bradgett, No. 02-12-00303-\n\n   CV, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 8576 (Tex. App. – Fort Worth July 11, 2013,\n\n   pet. denied). The phrase “This partition does not include any of the oil,\n\n   gas, or other minerals in, on or under the above described tract of land…”\n\n   is an isolated phrase. (Supp. CR 21-22). It should not be interpreted alone\n\n   from the phrase to which it is joined: “same are to remain undivided for a\n\n   period of twenty-five years…” (Supp. CR 21-22). It also should not be\n\n   allowed to contradict the patent purpose of the document: to partition the\n\n   estate. While on first blush, the fact that the partition is said to not include\n\n   the minerals may be interpreted to mean the minerals are never partitioned,\n\n   if the whole document is read harmoniously, Frost Nat’l Bank v. L & F\n\n   Distribs, Ltd., 165 S.W.3d 310, 311-12 (Tex. 2005), the isolated phrase\n\n   that the minerals are not partitioned should be read with the phrase which\n\n   immediately follows it and with the fact that this is a partition deed. This\n\n   gives the equally logical interpretation that the minerals are not partitioned\n\n   for twenty-five years to allow for sharing of current production, but that\n\n\n                                     8\n\f   they are partitioned after twenty-five years, to accomplish full partitioning\n\n   of the estates, the stated goal of the document. (Supp. CR 19-24).\n\n(2) The consideration of the whole document, in harmony, comes from “a\n\n   utilitarian standpoint bearing in mind the particular business activity\n\n   sought to be served, and a court will avoid when possible and proper a\n\n   construction which is unreasonable, unequitable, and oppressive.” Reilly\n\n   v. Rangers Mgmt., Inc. 727 S.W.2d 527, 530 (Tex. 1987). While it is\n\n   inequitable to deprive one party of presently-occurring or soon-to occur\n\n   production that they may be counting on, (although this turned out to be\n\n   wishful thinking), it is oppressive to omit the minerals from eventual\n\n   partition, when two people who may have different businesses and\n\n   different goals are trying to partition their estates.\n\n(3) There is the presumption that when lands are partitioned among co-\n\n   owners, the whole of the land is partitioned, unless some portion of the\n\n   land is expressly excepted from the partition. Pewitt v. Renwar Oil Corp.,\n\n   261 S.W.2d 904, 906 (Tex. Civ. App. – Houston 1962, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n   In this case, reading entire sentences as a whole, the only thing that is\n\n   expressly excepted are the minerals for twenty-five years. (Supp. CR 19-\n\n   24).\n\n\n\n\n                                     9\n\f(4) The presumption is that the grantor, (Ms. Scott in the case of the land the\n\n   Hoseks will receive), intends to convey to her grantee (the Hoseks) all of\n\n   the appurtenant rights incident to the beneficial enjoyment of property\n\n   which she had conveyed. Rio Bravo Oil Co. v. Weed, 121 Tex. 427 (Tex.\n\n   1932). In this case, conveyance of all of the appurtenant rights would\n\n   mean the minerals revert to the surface owners after the twenty-five years\n\n   or production are up.\n\n(5) Where the instrument is capable of two constructions, one of which will\n\n   give effect to the whole of the instrument while the other would defeat it\n\n   in whole or in part, preference is given to the construction that will uphold\n\n   the instrument. Bagby v. Bredhauer, 627 S.W.2d 190 (Tex. App. – Austin\n\n   1981, no writ). This is a partition deed, and reverter of the minerals to the\n\n   respective surface owner after twenty-five years upholds the whole\n\n   instrument. (Supp. CR 19-24). Reverter does not ignore the phrase that\n\n   the minerals are not (presently) partitioned, because that phrase is\n\n   implemented for the twenty-five years of the agreement not to partition.\n\n   (Supp. CR 20-22).\n\nThus, there are two reasonable interpretations of the Partition Deed: one in\n\nwhich the minerals remain unpartitioned after the twenty-five years (thwarting\n\nthe full effect of partition) and one in which the minerals revert to the\n\n\n                                   10\n\f      respective surface owner after the twenty-five years are up (giving full life to\n\n      the partition document).      Therefore, the Partition Deed is ambiguous.\n\n      Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp. v. Daniel, 243 S.W.2d 154 (Tex. 1951). The\n\n      trial court erred in finding that it was unambiguous.\n\n      If a contract or deed is ambiguous, then parol evidence is admissible for the\n\npurpose of ascertaining the true intentions of the parties. National Union Fire Ins.\n\nCo. v. CBI Indus., 907 S.W.2d 517 (Tex. 1995). Such parol evidence was admitted\n\nwith the Hoseks’ Response to Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. (Supp. CR\n\n42-82). The Affidavit of Alan Cummings, Board Certified Attorney in Oil and Gas\n\nand noted Tittle Examiner uses statutory construction similar to just presented to\n\ntestify that the parties intended the minerals to revert to the surface owner after\n\ntwenty-five years. (Supp. CR 51). The Affidavit of Ivarene Hosek testifies as to her\n\npresent understanding, that expressed by her sister at the time, and the present\n\nunderstanding of the oil companies who researched title. (Supp. CR 49-50). All\n\nbelieve that the minerals were intended to revert to the respective surface owner.\n\n(Supp. CR. 49-50).\n\n      If any doubt exists as to the intention of the grantors, and a deed is ambiguous,\n\na practical and reasonable construction given it by the parties thereto before any\n\ncontroversy has arisen as to its meaning will generally be given controlling effect by\n\nthe courts. Rio Bravo Oil, 121 Tex. at 426-47; San Antonio St. Ry Co. v. Adams, 87\n\n\n                                          11\n\fTex. 125, 131 (Tex. 1894).       There was testimony from several parties, and\n\ncorrespondence written before the controversy arose that the parties treated the\n\nminerals as reverted to the surface owners. Ms. Hosek testified via affidavit that her\n\nsister told buyers of Ms. Scott’s land that they would own all the minerals under\n\nScott’s land after reversion. (Supp. CR. 49-50). The deposition testimony of Rosale\n\nherself testified that the Hoseks would own the minerals for 14 more years, and then\n\nthe buyer would get the minerals under the Scott tract. (Supp. CR. 64). There was\n\ntestimony that Ms. Scott attempted to break the non-partition agreement before the\n\ntwenty-five years was up so as to be able to transfer all of the minerals under her\n\nland to prospective buyers. (Supp. CR. 76). And in a letter to Mr. King, one eventual\n\nbuyer of Ms. Scott’s land and minerals, Ms. Scott told Mr. King he would get all the\n\nminerals under the land in fourteen years. (Supp. CR 78-79). This is especially\n\ncredible because it all occurred before any controversy came up. (Supp. CR 68).\n\nThe only testimony that Ms. Scott thought the partition would be renegotiated after\n\nthe twenty-five years, (Supp. CR. 72) came up after the conflict arose and much oil\n\nmoney hinged in the balance.\n\n      Thus, the great preponderance of the evidence establishes that the intent of the\n\nparties was that the Hoseks’ minerals have reverted to them and that 100% of the\n\nminerals under the Hoseks’ land belong to them. Therefore, the deed was originally\n\nambiguous, not unambiguous as the trial court decided, and the parol evidence\n\n\n                                         12\n\fconclusively established that the minerals reverted to the surface owners after\n\ntwenty-five years. The summary judgment was harmful because there are currently\n\nproducing oil units into which the minerals under the Hoseks’ land are pooled, but\n\nhalf the money due the Hoseks is not being paid to them, due to Ms. Scotts’ false\n\nclaim. (Supp. CR 50). Other royalty owners are also being denied payment and the\n\nwells may even be abandoned. (Supp. CR 50). The trial court’s summary judgment\n\nmust be reversed.\n\nARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES ON THIRD ISSUE:\n\n      The trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys’ fees because both\n      sides benefitted equally from an interpretation of the deed and an award to\n      Ms. Scott was not fair and equitable.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW ON THIRD ISSUE:\n\n      The standard of review for an award of attorneys’ fees on a declaratory\n\njudgment is abuse of discretion. City of Temple v. Taylor, 268 S.W.3d 852, 858\n\n(Tex. App. – Austin 2008, pet. denied). Whether attorneys’ fees are equitable and\n\njust is a matter of law. Bocquet v. Herring, 972 S.W.2d 19, 20 (Tex. 1998). The\n\nUDJA does not require an award of attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party. Id.\n\nARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES:\n\n      In this case, reversal of the attorneys’ fees award is necessary regardless of\n\nwhether the summary judgment is reversed.\n\n                                        13\n\f      If a court reverses a declaratory judgment, it is usually equitable and just to\n\nreverse the award of attorneys’ fees to the former winner. Tanglewood Homes Ass’n\n\nv. Henke, 728 S.W.2d 39 (Tex. App. – Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, writ ref’d n.r.e.);\n\nScottsdale Ins. Co. v. Travis, 68 S.W.3d 72 (Tex. App. -- Dallas 2001, pet. denied).\n\nIn this case, if the Court reverses, it is because all parties treated the minerals as\n\nhaving reverted to the surface owner. Ms. Scott even sold mineral interests that she\n\ncould only sell if the rights had reverted.3 It was therefore dishonest of her to claim\n\nthat the minerals did not revert. She should just have signed the quitclaim deed and\n\nthere never would have been a lawsuit with attorneys’ fees. (Supp. CR 49-50). It is\n\nnot equitable and just to award attorneys’ fees to someone whose defense was\n\ndishonest.\n\n      Even if this Court does not reverse the summary judgment, the attorneys’ fees\n\naward is not just and equitable and should be reversed. “Just and equitable” should\n\nin most cases be tied to the party who caused the necessity of the suit. Where one\n\nparty caused the suit by having an improper interpretation, they may often be liable\n\nfor attorneys’ fees. However, it is not necessary to award attorneys’ fees to the\n\nprevailing party. Securtec, Inc. v. County of Gregg, No. 06-01-00164-CV, 2002\n\nTex. App. LEXIS 8812 (Tex. App. – Texarkana Dec. 11, 2002, no pet.). In this case,\n\n\n\n3\n Her testimony is that she thought she kept her half and only sold the Hoseks’\nhalf! (Supp. CR 77).\n                                          14\n\fboth parties “caused” the suit in that they both needed the Partition Deed interpreted,\n\nregardless of who had the right interpretation, as a 50% interest in minerals was at\n\nstake, so there is no party who “caused” the lawsuit more than the other, and no party\n\nshould receive attorneys’ fees. This court should reverse and render on the question\n\nof attorneys’ fees.\n\nARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES ON FOURTH ISSUE:\n\n      The trial court abused its discretion in allowing the possibility of forcing the\n      Hoseks to pay the costs of necessary and irrelevant documents which were\n      included in the record at the demand of Ms. Scott’s counsel merely to raise\n      the cost of the appeal for the Hoseks.\n\n\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW ON FOURTH ISSUE:\n\n       A trial judge has discretionary authority to assess court costs against either\nof the parties or to apportion such costs between them in a fair and equitable\nmanner. San Antonio Hous. Auth. v. Underwood, 785 S.W.2d 25 (Tex. App. – San\nAntonio 1989, no writ).\n\nARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES:\n\n      Many unnecessary steps were engaged in by opposing counsel in this case in\n\nan apparent effort by opposing counsel to raise the cost of the case prohibitively for\n\nthe Hoseks. For example, Ms. Scott engaged in lengthy tactics to make the Hoseks\n\nadd parties they did not wish to add, when she could have just added them herself at\n\nminimal expense. Ms. Scott’s legal bills, which she sought to make the Hoseks pay,\n\n\n                                          15\n\fcontained duplication and triplication of effort, and even when cut almost in half,\n\nwere more than those of the Hoseks counsel by more than ten thousand dollars.\n\n      The most outrageous effort, however, was a request for approximately sixteen\n\ndocuments which Ms. Scott’s counsel asked to be added to the record on appeal.\n\n(CR 417). The trial court overruled the Hoseks’ objection to these additions and left\n\nit an open question whether the Hoseks would be forced to pay for this addition.\n\n(CR 427). This was an abuse of discretion, because it was not a fair and equitable\n\naddition. It slowed down the appeal and added to the cost for no reason. Ms. Scott\n\nhad not perfected any appeal. (CR 423). The issues on appeal were two: (1) the\n\ninterpretation of the Partition Deed and (2) the award of attorneys’ fees. (CR 423).\n\nPleadings which had been superseded, or documents, such as documents relevant to\n\nabatement or supercedeas, which were not relevant to any issue on appeal, should\n\nnot have been included in the appellate record and the Hoseks ask that this Court\n\nrule that they are not charged the cost of adding these documents to the record, as\n\nsuch would not be fair and equitable and would be an abuse of discretion.\n\nGamesmanship should not be tolerated when it may affect a party’s ability (and\n\nconstitutional right) to present its case. See Pennzoil Co. v. Arnold Oil Co., 30\n\nS.W.3d 494 (Tex. App. – San Antonio 2000, orig. proceeding).\n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\f                           CONCLUSION & PRAYER\n\n      Bad drafting of a partition deed created an ambiguous document, contrary to\n\nthe trial court’s conclusion that the deed was unambiguous. A great preponderance\n\nof the evidence of how the Hoseks and Ms. Scott treated the deed, before the conflict\n\narose, conclusively established that the minerals reverted to the surface owner after\n\nthe twenty-five year agreement not to partition included in the deed ended. This\n\nevidence proves that the Hoseks own 100% of the minerals under their land,\n\ntherefore, the trial court’s judgment was harmful because it caused an incorrect\n\njudgment to result and a whole neighborhood of royalty owners to have their royalty\n\npayments withheld – not a small matter when ranching income in the area is\n\ncurrently limited by a pervasive drought.\n\n      Both parties needed the deed interpreted, so the award of attorneys’ fees\n\nagainst just the Hoseks should be reversed. “Just and equitable” is a question of law,\n\nso a judgment proving that neither side should recover attorneys’ fees should be\n\nentered.\n\n      Again, the assessment of costs must be “just and equitable.” Therefore a\n\njudgment should be entered that the Hoseks not pay for the extra Clerks’ Record the\n\ncounsel for Ms. Scott required.\n\n      WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Hoseks ask that the\n\nsummary judgment entered by the trial court be completely reversed, and judgment\n\n                                         17\n\fentered that the deed is ambiguous and the Hoseks own 100% of the minerals under\n\ntheir land. The Hoseks ask for such other and further relief as may be just.\n\n                                              Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                              ______/s/ MB CHIMENE_______\n\n                                              THE CHIMENE LAW FIRM\n                                              Michele Barber Chimene\n                                              TBN 04207500\n                                              15203 Newfield Bridge Ln.\n                                              Sugar Land, TX. 77498\n                                              PH: 713 474-5538; no fax\n                                              michelec@airmail.net\n\n                                              COUNSEL FOR THE HOSEKS\n\n\n                       CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE\n\n     The undersigned certifies that this brief was produced in 14 pt Times New\nRoman font with the required margins and number of words.

Mr. Caldwell practices law primarily in civil litigation and oil and gas and is\n\n             familiar withJhe.fees customarily charged in Bexar\n                                                           .. - .   --\n                                                                and Atascosa counties-· on cases\n                                                                                         . ,_    .such\n                                                                                             ·-\"'\"   ___..,_this..... ___ ... _..\n                                                                                                    \"' as            .              _\n\n\n\n\n             one.\n\n                     5.      Mr. Caldwell is familiar with the factors taken into account by the State Bar of\n\n             Texas and courts in the state of Texas in determining reasonable and necessary attorney's fees.\n\n                     6.       Mr. Caldwell is familiar with the fees charged for similar cases in Atascosa\n\n             County, Texas.\n\n                     7.      Since Mr. Caldwell has practiced law in the state of Texas since 1984, he is\n\n             familiar with the range of billing rates for legal services rendered by attorneys possessing his\n\n             experience, skill, knowledge, reputation, and background in the civil litigation field.\n\n                     8.       Attorneys from Bexar County frequently practice law in Atascosa County because\n\n             of, the_~lO.§.€?. ,p_rox!:rpi!y between Bexar and Atascosa Counties. Therefore, it is reasonable to\n\n             charge attorney fee rates from Bexar County in Atascosa County.\n\n                     9.       Mr. Caldwell has experience handling appeals in Texas State appellate courts.\n\n                     10.      Practicing in the civil litigation field regarding mineral titles is a complex area of\n\n             practice.\n\n                     11.      Mr. Caldwell obtained a positive result for Defendant because Defendant\n\n             prevailed on her Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                  Page 12\n       406\n\f                  12.       Plaintiffs did not achieve a benefit by filing the instant litigation to the extent that\n\n           the court found in favor of Defendant.\n\n                   13.      This case was defended by defense counsel on a contingency fee basis for forty\n\n           percent (40%) of the gross amount recovered by Defendant. Defense counsel also advanced\n\n           expenses incurred in this litigation.\n\n                   14.      Even though the law firm of Barton, East & Caldwell, P.L.L.C. defended the case\n\n           on a.contingency basis, the attorneys and legal    st~ff that   worked on the case tracked thei~ tj_me Qn\n\n           an hourly basis.\n\n                   15.      Defendant Rosale Scott submitted copies of time records from the law firm of\n\n           Barton, East and Caldwell, P.L.L.C. reflecting time spent by attorneys and legal staff from May,\n\n           2013 to March 2014. Privileged information was redacted from the time records. The time\n\n           records were attached to Defendant's Motion for Award of Attorneys' Fees and were admitted\n\n           into evidence.\n\n                   16.      The amount of $315.00 per hour ($240.00 for associates) is a fair, reasonable and\n\n           customary hourly fee for an attorney practicing in Atascosa County with the knowledge, skill\n\n           and experience of Mr. Caldwell for this type oflawsuit.\n\n                _U.:.._ ,. TheJe.CLcharged     in this case is well within the parameters of the customarily\n\n           charged fee in Atascosa County, Texas for civillitiga.tion matters.\n\n                   18.      The rates of legal assistants reflected in the time records submitted by Defendant\n\n           are reasonable and necessary and their work was done under the supervision of an attorney.\n'I\n I\n                   19.      The work reflected on the time records submitted by Defendant was reasonable\n\n           and necessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                            Page   13\n     407\n\f..     •   <\n\n\n\n\n                      20.     The time records submitted by Defendant reflect that slightly less than 355 hours\n\n               were spent on the claims which allow recovery of attorneys' fees between May 2013 and\n\n               February 28, 2014. This is a reasonable amount of time in light of the fact that the parties\n\n               engaged in written discovery, took depositions, filed and argued a Plea in Abatement, filed a\n\n               Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, filed a Motion to Strike Expert Report and Exclude\n\n               Expert, filed Motions to Compel, and were set for trial in January 2014.\n\n                      21.     Between the date last reflected in the time records submitted by Defendant,\n\n               additional legal work was performed by Mr. Caldwell as well as other members of his legal staff,\n\n               including preparing, filing and arguing the Motion for Attorneys' Fees, preparing a Final\n\n               Judgment, subpoenaing records from EOG Resources, Inc., and setting the objections of EOG\n\n               Resources, Inc. for hearing.    In his affidavit, Mr. Caldwell estimates that this involves an\n\n               additional 50 hours ofwork. This additional legal work was both reasonable and necessary.\n\n                      22.     Mr. Caldwell provided evidence both in the form of live testimony before the\n\n               court as well as in an affidavit admitted into evidence as to how the fees of his law firm were\n\n               segregated, as required by Texas law.\n\n                      23.     Defendant segregated and did not include, in the fees that Defendant is seeking,\n\n                            - __\n               fees which are related\n                                ,... ...only to the counterclaim or other non-recoverable case matters.\n\n                      24.     The total hours reflected on the time records submitted by Defendant total\n\n               approximately 381.73. From this amount, Defendant segregated and deducted approximately\n\n               28.8 hours that reflected legal services performed for solely non-recoverable claims or other non-\n\n               recoverable case matters.\n\n                      25.     Defendant segregated the attorneys' fees relating to the Motion for Partial\n\n               Summary Judgment and requested 100% of those fees.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          Page 14\n     408\n\f               26.              Non-segregable time entries are time entries where the legal services advance\n\n      - both recoverable and non-recoverable claims and the time entries were not clear if the work\n\n       related solely to the claims which allow recovery of attorneys' fees.\n\n               27.              Mr. Caldwell provided evidence that in his opinion, eighty percent (80%) of these ·\n\n       non-segregable time entries are for work attributable to the claims which allow recovery of\n\n       attorneys' fees and twenty (20%) is related to work attributable to non-recoverable claims.\n\n       Therefore, subtracting the non-recoverable entries and reducing the non-segregable entries by\n\n       twenty percent (20%), the reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees incurred through the last\n\n       invoice on the time records submitted by Defendant are swnmarized and calculated as follows:\n\n       (a) non-segregable fees are $57,945.83; (b) recoverable fees relating to the Motion for Partial\n\n       Summary Judgment are $17,832.49; (c) non-recoverable fees relating to EOG are $6,502.50; and\n\n       (d) non-recoverable fees relating to the counterclaim are $368.00. Accordingly, total attorneys'\n\n       fees are $82,648.82.\n\n               28.              Defendant then segregated and reduced the total attorneys' fees of $82,648.82 by\n\n       the following amounts: (a) $11,589.17 which constituted a 20% reduction ofthe non-segregable\n\n       fees; (b) $6,502.50 which constituted the non-recoverable fees relating to EOG; and (c) $368.00\n\n           .         .   ....   -·-\n       which constituted non-recoverable fees relating to the counter-claim.\n\n               29.              Accordingly, the total attorney fees sought by Defendant through February 28,\n\n       2014 total $64,189.15. These attorneys' fees are both reasonable and necessary.\n\n               30.              Defendant then requested an additional $10,000 of attorneys' fees for additional\n\n       work performed from the date last reflected on the time records through the collection of\n\n       judgment.\n\n               31.              Accordingly, Defendant sought total attorneys' fees in the amount of$74,189.15.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          Page 15\n409\n\f    ..     .!!' •\n              •\n\n\n\n                           32.    $74,189.15 is a reasonable and necessary attorney's fee for the legal services\n\n\\                   performed on behalf of Defendant for the claims which allow recovery of attorneys' fees, for the\n\nI                   work reflected on the time records thru February 28, 2014 and performed thru the entry of a\n\n                    supersedeas bond.\n\n                           33.    If a motion for new trial 'is necessary, a reasonable and necessary, attorneys' fee\n\n                    would be $3,500.00.\n\n                           34.    In the event any part of the judgment is appealed to the appropriate Court of\n\n                    Appeals and Defendant prevails, a reasonable and necessary, attorneys' fee would be\n\n                    $30,000.00.\n\n                           35.    In the event any part of the judgment is appealed to the Texas Supreme Court by\n\n                    Writ or Error and Defendant prevails, a reasonable and necessary, attorneys' fee would be\n\n                    $15,000.00.\n\n                           36.    Should the petition for .review be granted by the Texas Supreme Court and\n\n                    Defendant prevails, a reasonable and necessary, attorneys' fee would be $25,000.00.\n\n                                                             II.\n                                                     CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n                           37.    Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, a court may award reasonable and\n\n                    necessary'attomeys' fees as are equitable and just. GuideOne Elite Ins. v. Fielder Rd.

The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions\n                                    involved, and the skill required to perform the legal services properly;\n\n                             b.     The likelihood that the acceptance of the particular employment will\n                                    preclude other employment by the attorney;\n\n                             c.     The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;\n\n                             d.     The amount involved and .the results obtained;\n\n                             e.     The time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;\n\n                             f.     The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;\n\n                             g.     The experience, reputation, and ability of the attorney performing the\n                                    services; and\n\n                             h.      Whether the fee is fixed or contingent on results obtained - that is, the\n                                     uncertainty of collection before the legal services have been rendered.\n\n                     Arthur Anderson, 945 S.W.2d at 818·819.\n\n                     41.

An award of attorneys' fees to Defendant Rosale Scott is equitable and just.\n\n                     45.      Although $74,000.00 is a reasonable and necessary attorneys' fee for the work\n\n              performed by defense counsel in this case through the entry entry of a supersedeas bond, it is\n\n              equitable and just to reduce such fee to $39,500.00.\n\n\n                                                                                                          Page 17\n\n     411\n\f                 46.

In the event any part of the judgment is appealed to the appropriate Court of\n\n      Appeals and Defendant prevails, a reasonable and necessary attorneys' fee would be $30,000.00,\n\n      however, it would be equitable and just to reduce such fee to $12,500.00.\n\n                 48.

When a movant files a motion for summary judgment based on summary\n\njudgment evidence, the court can grant the motion only when the movant's evidence proves, as a ·\n\nmatter of law, all the elements of the movant's cause of action or defense, or disproves the facts\n\nof at least one element in the non-movant's cause or defense.\n\n       B.     When evaluating a motion for summary judgment, the court must:\n\n              1.      Assume all the non-movant's proof is true;\n\n              2.      Indulge every reasonable inference in favor of the non-movant; and\n\n              3.      Resolve all doubts about the existence of a genuine issue of material fact\n\n       against the movant.\n\n                                               II.\n\n       A.     The Hoseks, the Non-Movants in this cause, filed a declaratory judgment action\n\n                                                1\n\n                                                                                                              37\n\fI\n\n\n\n\n    \"\"\"'\n           lr.\n\n           r                               •                                         •\n                 against Movant Scott, seeking an interpretation of a Partition Deed. The Partition Deed is\n\n                 attached hereto as Exhibit \"A\". The Partition Deed reads as follows:\n\n                         \"This p~ition does not include any of the oil, gas and other minerals in, on, or under the\n\n                 above described tract of land, and same are to remain undivided for a period of twenty-five(25)\n\n                 years from date hereof and as long thereafter as oil, gas or other minerals are produced in paying\n\n                 quantities from the above described land.\"\n\n                         The conflict over the interpretation of this Deed arises out of the failure of the document\n\n                 to state what will occur after the expiration of the 25 year period and cessation of production.\n\n                 The Deed does not expressly state what happens upon that occurrence, and thus the conflict was\n\n                 born.\n\n                         The deed was drafted by an attorney who is deceased. The Hoseks are aware that the\n\n                 language was intended that the undivided mineral interests revert to the surface owners after the\n\n                 expiration of 25 years and cessation     ~f   production, which occurred in 2004. The Hoseks,\n\n                 together with Ms. Scott, instructed the attorney to prepare an instrument which gave effect to\n\n                 their intention.\n\n                         Movant Scott sold her land with the minerals and received cash consideration for the sale.\n\n                 She now seeks one half of the minerals beneath the Hoseks' land, citing the defective deed as the\n\n                 source of her title. In the letter attached as Exhibit \"5\" to   S~ott's   deposition, Scott tells her\n\n                 prospective buyer that he will receive the minerals under the land she will sell him after the\n\n                 expiration of the 25 year period.\n\n                         Movant filed a counterclaim against Non-Movants seeking affirmative relief for damages\n\n                 and a declaration that she owns one-half of the minerals under the Hoseks' land. Movant is aware\n\n                 that the Hoseks have leased their minerals to an oil company and that royalties are being\n\n\n\n                                                                  2\n\n                                                                                                                         38\n\f                           •                                           •\n withheld until this conflict is resolved. During the course of exploration and development of the\n\n minerals on the Hoseks' property, no oil company or title examiner opined that Movant Scott\n\n owned any interest.\n\n        The Hoseks' retained expert, title examiner Allen D. Cummings, opines that the most\n\n natural interpretation of the Partition Deed language is that the minerals reverted to the surface\n\n owner after the expiration of 25 years and cessation of production. The report of Mr. Cummings,\n\n as well as his CV, are attached to his affidavit, being Exhibit \"C\" hereto.\n\n        B.      Movant alleges there is no genuine issue of material fact as to any element of\n\n interpretation of the Partition Deed. The very existence of this litigation disproves this claim. The\n\n wording is susceptible to multiple meanings by virtue of the Movant's claim that the language\n\n did not have its commonly accepted meaning.\n\n         C.     Non-Movants claim a genuine issue of material fact exists as to Movant's\n\n counterclaim and submit affidavits, discC?very, documentary evidence and Movants' pleadings, as\n\n summary judgment evidence, referenced in an appendix attached hereto, filed with this response\n\n· and incorporated by such reference for all purposes as if recited verbatim herein.\n\n                                                 III.\n\n        A.      Non-Movants filed a claim against Movant seeking affirmative relief for the\n\n interpretation of a Partition Deed.\n\n         B.     Movant alleges Movant is entitled to a partial summary judgment as a matter of\n\n law, and alleges that Movant can prove her counterclaim.\n\n                1.     - Non-Movants claim a genuine issue of material fact exists as to Movant's\n\n         claim and submit affidavits, discovery, documentary evidence and Movants' pleadings, as\n\n         summary judgment evidence, referenced in an appendix attached hereto, filed with this\n\ff.'   :   i\n\n                                   •                                         •\n                 response and incorporated by such reference for all purposes as if recited verbatim herein.\n\n                                                        IV.\n                 A.      The Court should deny Movant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and\n\n          pennit evidence to be presented and heard to establish the proper interpretation of the Partition\n\n          Deed made the basis of this lawsuit. The very existence of this dispute proves that there are\n\n          multiple interpretations of the document, and the evidence presented in this pleading establishes\n\n          that the Non-Movants' interpretation is the proper meaning of the document.\n\n\n\n                                                     PRAYER\n\n                 WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Non-Movants pray that this Court will\n\n          deny Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, or order such other relief as may be\n\n          appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n                                                      By: ----~------+---~----~~------­\n                                                      Robert J.

This court has jurisdiction over the parties because Defendant is a Texas resident.\n\n              D..     Venue in Atascosa County is proper in this cause under Section 15.011 of the\n\n      Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code because this action .involves real property as provided\n\n      by said Section, and this county is where all or part of the·real property is located.\n\n                                                  IV. FACTS\n\n              On October 4, 1978, Fridolin ~ex Voigt and wife, Pearl Schnautz Voigt, deeded the\n\n      family farm to their children, Ivarene Hosek (and her husband Victor) and Resale Scott, in\n\n     undivided shares. Ivarene and Rosale then partitioned the property on August 17, 1979, but\n\n     reserved minerals for twenty five years, so that each would have a one half mineral interest in the\n\n     ·entire tract. The partition gave Ivarene a tract of 207.77 acres, less a 38.5 acre tract, and gave\n\n     Rosale a 130.77 acre tract, plus the 38.5 acres reserved out of Ivarene's 207.77 acres. Ivarene\n\n     then purchased back from Rosale the 38.5 acres on October 16, 1979, so that she possessed the\n\n     original 207.77 acre tract. The 38.5 acre purchase also reserved minerals for 25 years. After 25\n\n     years, on August 17, 2004, the minerals reverted back to the owner of the respective tracts.\n\n     Resale sold approximately 60 acres of her acreage to Evaristo Morales and wife, Rene Morales\n\n     on March 4, 1986. Then Rosale sold approximately 70 acres to William W. King and wife, Rosie\n\n     King on January 29, 1990. Ivarene still owns her 207.77 acres together with her husband, Victor\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        2\n\f.;\n:\n\n\n\n\n       Hosek.\n                               ••                                        •\n                Ivarene has attempted to lease her acreage for oil and gas production, and Rosale claims\n\n       an interest in some of the minerals under Ivarene's land. Rosale's claims are unfounded in law\n\n       and in fact and are costing Ivarene substantial potential oil and gas income by making a claim for\n\n     · payment of funds to which she is not entitled.\n\n                                         V. RELIEF REQUESTED\n\n              There exists a genuine controversy between the parties herein that would be terminated\n\n      by the granting of declaratory judgment. Plaintiffs therefore request that declaratory judgment\n\n      be entered as follows;   ·\n\n             A.       A judgment of the court that Ivarene Hosek and Victor Hosek own one hundred\n\n      per cent of the minerals, including oil and gas, lying under their property, described in Exhibit A\n\n      attached hereto and made a part hereof, and a judgment of the court that Rosale Scott owns no\n\n      minerals lying under the said tract.\n\n\n                                         VI.

We agreed to let the minerals remain undivided for a period of twenty five\n\nyears and as long thereafter as oil and gas were being produced. After that time, the minerals\n\nwould be vested in the surface owner. This is the document that our attorney, Joe R. Wiseman,\n\nwas directed to draft, and it was signed by us on August 17, 1979. My sister and I shared the cost\n\nof the attorney fees to Joe Wiseman to prepare this document. My sister knew of our agreement\n\nregarding the minerals and told this to her buyers, who purchased her property after my sister\n\ntold them they would own the minerals after the expiration of the twenty five year period, being\n\nAugust 17, 2004.\n\n       My sister only made this claim for one half of the minerals under my property after being\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     49\n\f                                                                   •\nasked by the oil company to sign a title curative document to address the poorly drafted Partition\n\nDeed. The oil companies who researched the title read this document and presumed that my\n\nhusband and I owned all the minerals under our property after the expiration of the twenty five\n\nyear period. My sister is fully aware of this. My sister has sold her land with the minerals and\n\nbeen paid for them, now she wants half of my minerals. Her actions have prevented me and all\n\nmineral owners of the pooled well unit from being paid any royalties. The oil company, EOG,\n\nhas made it known to me that it may need to either abandon the well unit that has been drilled or\n\nexclude our acreage from the pooled unit if this issue is not resolved.

San Antonio St.\n        Boerne, TX 78006\n\n        Re:          Deed of Partition dated 8/17/1979, recorded 510 DR 126, Atascosa County, Texas, by\n                     and between Victor Hosek, and wife, Ivarene Voigt Hosek and Rosale Voigt Scott.\n\n        Dear Mr. Ogle:\n\n       You have asked me to provide you my opinion, based solely on my review of the above-\n       referenced Deed of Partition, concerning the ownership of the oil, gas and other minerals in and\n       under the lands described in said Deed of Partition. The lands in Deed of Partition are described\n       as a 207.77-acre tract ofland, described by metes and bounds, in the \"First\" section of the Deed\n       of Partition and tracts of 130.77 acres and 38.5 acres, each described by metes and bounds, in the\n       \"Second\" section of the Deed of Partition. The Deed of Partition recites that the parties hold the\n       lands described in common. Following the description of the lands in each section of the Deed\n      ;of Partition is the following clause:\n                     This partition does not include any of the oil, gas and other minerals in, on or\n                     under the above described tract of land, and same are to remain undivided for a\n                     period of twenty-five years from the date hereof and as long thereafter as oil, gas\n                     or other minerals are produced in paying quantities from the above descn'bed\n                     land.\n       This clause does not say what is the effect of the Partition Deed at the end of 25 years, i.e. on\n       8/17/2004, if there was not then, and thereafter, production in paying quantities from the lands\n       described. Therefore, in order to detennine the present ownership of the oil, gas and other\n       minerals in the lands described in the Deed of Partition, assuming there has not been continuous\n       production in paying quantities, we must determine the effect of this clause.\n\n       Whether this clause renders the Deed of Partition ambiguous is a question of law to be\n       detennined by a court. However, the cases on construction of deeds and contracts show that the\n       courts will first apply the rules of construction to determine from the four comers of the\n       instrument the intent of the parties as expressed in the instrument, regardless of what may have\n       been the subjective intent of the parties to the instrument. Luckel v. White, 819 S.W.2d 459\n       (Tex. 1991). If. after the application of the rules of construction, there are two or more\n       reasonable interpretations, then a court may find the instrument is ambiguous.

Daniel, 243 S.W.2d 154 (Tex. 1951).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                         52\n\f        Robert J•. Ogle\n        November 29,2013\n        Page2of2\n                                                 •                            •\n        It is well settled that a partition deed does not convey title, but rather dissolves the. tenancy of\n        lands owned' in comrtlon and segregates the possession and use of the·landS anicmg individual co-\n        owne~ .. Houston 0!/. Co. ofTexas v. Kirkindr;zll, 1.45 s~w.2d 1074 (Te~. l94l). In addition,\n        there is a presumption tlla,t wb,en lands. are partitioned among co-owners; the whole of the land is\n        partitioned, unless some portion of the lapd is expressly excepted from the partition. Pewitt v.\n        RenwarOi/ Corp., 261 S~W.2d 904, 906 (Tex. Civ-. App.- Houston, 1962,.-wrlt refused n.r.e.)\n\n        Readi~g the above clauseJn light of these twO principles, It would appeat tht1t the parties.to the\n        Deed. of Partition, expressly excluded from the partition the oil, gas al1Cl othet minerals in the\n        lands for a tet.ni detli1ed as \"twenty-five years ~ . . and as long thereafter as ·oil, gas or other\n        minerals are produced i.n paying qiJ!intities from the above described land.\" It woulc;I also appear\n        the most reasonable construction of this clause, even though it Is not expressly stated~ is the\n        parties fntended, after the expressly excluded term, that ilie use and posseS.sion of the oil, gas and\n        other minerals would ·be segregated to the owners of the individual trE).cts described in· the first\n        and second section~ of the Deed of Partition. In other words, the exclusio~ from the wtended\n        partition of possession and use of all the lands as to. oil, gas and other minerals ends after 25\n        years or, if there is production in paying quantities from theJands, then when there is no longer\n        production in paying quantities. ItJs,important tO note again, the partition deed does hot affect\n        title to the {a(lds, but only the se~gation of possession and use.\n\n    You:haye as~ed me ~o provide you my opinion about whether such a construction of the Deed of\n    Partition violates the Rule AgainSt Perpetuities (the \"Rule\")~ The Rule i~ applicable to. a future\n    estate? which may not vest during lives in being plus twenty·one year~; it has no application to\n    present interests or •to provisions which m~y postpose possession beyond a period of lives in\n    being and twenty·one years. See generally, Kelly v. WQmack, 268 S. \\V. 2g 903, 905 (Tex. 1954)\n    and Hamman v. Bright &Co., 924 S.W:2d 168, (Tex. App• ., Amarillo 1996). In as much as the\n    Deed of Partition does not affect title,_ but only the segregation of the use and possession of the\n                                                                   in\n   :oil, gas and other minerals by the co-owners whojoined the partition, it would appear that the\n   above construction would not be subject to the Rule. Because the parties. own title to the lands\n    subject. to the Deed of Partition in common, only the segre.gatio+t of use and possession of the oil,\n    gas and other minerals is postponed for the Stated term. Without this clause, ilie oil,_ gas and\n    other minerals woUld have been partitioned upon exec1.rtion and delivery of the. Deed o(Partition.\n\n    Based on the foregoing, it is my opinion that use .and posse~sion of t~e oil. gO$ a~d other\n    miner.:Us in the lands descdbed in the Deed of Partition; is vested in the party to vv~()m the\n    individul,ll tia9ts are partitioned therein, absent continuous production in paying· quantities from\n    and after 8/1712004. This opinion is based on solely on examination ofthe Deed ofPattition as a\n    single document and without ilie benefit ofother instrum~nts in the chain of ti:tle that could affect\n    my opini_on on the effect ofthe Deed of partition.                               .\n\n\n        ~-~~~-·\n          truly,.· ~ ·•.\n        t   .         . . .·                .\n    ;             '      .'\n f...       .:.           • ...... ,   .·   ..\n\n\n\n\n/ Allen D.

................................................................................................................ 5\n   ARGUMENT ON FIRST & SECOND ISSUES ...................................................................................... 5\n      The trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Ms. Scott\n      because the petition deed is ambiguous and the summary judgment evidence\n      establishes that a general issue of material fact exists whether the minerals reverted\n      to the surface owner after twnety-five years and cessation of produc-\n      tion. ....................................................................................................................................................... 5\n      This summary judgment was harmful error because the partition deed was\n      ambiguous and summary judgment evidence conclusively establishes that\n      the minerals reverted to the surface owner

.................................................................... 13\n      The trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees because\n      sides benefitted equally from an interpretation of the deed and an award to\n      Ms. Scott was not fair and equitable. .................................................................................................. 13\n

(CR 75-77). Partial summary\n                                      judgment was granted in favor of Ms. Scott\n                                      owning an undivided one-half interest in the\n                                      minerals under the Hoseks’ land. (Supp. CR\n                                      89-90). A hearing was held on the issue of\n                                      attorneys’ fees, (RR 1-60), after which Judge\n                                      Shannon awarded Ms. Scott attorneys’ fees\n                                      of $39,500, plus $2,500 if a Motion for New\n                                      Trial was filed, 12,500 for appeal to this\n                                      court, $3,500 if petition for review was filed,\n                                      and $12,500 if the petition was granted.

The Hoseks will show as follows:\n\n\n                           STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      On October 4, 1978, Fridolin Alex Voigt and his wife, Pearl Schnautz Voigt,\n\ndeeded the family farm to their children, Ivarene Voigt Hosek (and her husband\n\nVictor) and Rosale Voigt Scott, in equal undivided shares. (Supp CR 16; 45). The\n\nHoseks and Ms. Scott then partitioned the tract, but made an agreement not to\n\npartition the minerals for twenty-five years or so long as production continued.\n                                        1\n\f(Supp. CR 19-24; 45). Because the twenty-five years started with the present, the\n\npartition deed did not partition the minerals, and they were severed from the surface\n\nestate. (Supp. CR 20-22). The partition read as follows:\n\n      “This partition does not include any of the oil, gas, or other minerals in, on\n      or under the above described tract of land, and same are to remain undivided\n      for a period of twenty-five years from the date hereof and as long thereafter\n      as oil, gas, or other minerals are produced in paying quantities from the above\n      described lands.”\n\n(Supp. CR 20-22). The deed was unclear what happened to the minerals after the\n\ntwenty-five years was up. The intent of the deed was clearly a partition of interests,\n\n(Supp. CR 19-24), yet did the statement that the partition did not include the minerals\n\njust mean that the minerals were not partitioned during the time the parties had\n\nagreed to not partition them, or did it leave them unpartitioned forever? And if they\n\nwere left unpartitioned forever, why was a twenty-five year period mentioned,\n\ninstead of just saying that the deed did not partition the minerals? This was an\n\nambiguity that would much later cause an oil company landman to send a quit claim\n\ndeed to Ms. Scott for signature, and begin this lawsuit, but up until the quit claim\n\ndeed, the parties treated the minerals in similar fashion.\n\n      After the twenty-five years had passed, (in 2004), both parties treated the land\n\nas though the minerals had reverted to the respective surface owners. Ms. Scott sold\n\nparts of her property to the Moraleses in 1986, (Supp. CR 28), and to the Kings in\n\n1990. (Supp. CR 31). She told the buyers that they would own the 50% of the\n\n\n                                           2\n\fminerals owned by the Hoseks under Ms. Scott’s tract after the twenty-five years\n\nexpired. (Supp. CR 49, 62, 64, and 78). The buyers paid Ms. Scott, not Ms. Hosek,\n\nfor the minerals. (Supp. CR 50). Ms. Scott even asked the Hoseks to ignore the\n\nagreement to not partition and have the minerals revert to the surface owner before\n\nthe twenty-five years were up so that she could please her buyer and convey 100%\n\nof the minerals immediately. (Supp. CR 73-76). There are even current wells pooled\n\nwith the land Ms. Scott sold, and the Hoseks are not getting paid any royalties on the\n\nhydrocarbons produced, because all parties have treated the minerals as reverting to\n\nthe surface owner. Only when oil was found on the Hoseks’ land, and an oilman\n\nasked Ms. Scott to sign a quit claim deed to cure the ambiguity in the poorly-drafted\n\nPartition Deed did Ms. Scott make her claim. (Supp. CR 50).\n\n\n\n\n                          SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      The Partition Deed at the heart of this case, (Supp. CR 19-24), is ambiguous\n\nbecause it does not say what happens to the minerals after a twenty-five year\n\nagreement not to petition and two possibilities are valid: (1), the Partition is\n\ncompleted and the minerals revert to the surface owner, or (2) the minerals stay\n\nunpartitioned forever. The trial court erred in saying the deed was unambiguous.\n\nThis brief discusses the many rules of contract interpretation which cause the deed\n\nto be ambiguous.\n                                          3\n\f      Subsequent treatment of the minerals by the parties before the conflict arose\n\nprovides airtight proof as to what the parties intended. Ms. Scott told two buyers for\n\nher land that the minerals would revert to the surface owner, and after the twenty-\n\nfive years were up, they would own the minerals. Ms. Scott attempted to bring to a\n\nclose the agreement not to partition the minerals before the twenty-five years were\n\nup, so as to give what was the temporarily the Hosek’s minerals to the buyer\n\nimmediately. If the minerals did not revert to the surface owners, Ms. Scott has sold\n\nthe Hosek’s minerals under Ms. Scott’s land without paying the Hoseks for them,\n\nand there are now wells pooled on that land that the Hoseks also aren’t getting paid\n\nfor. The landmen for current wells believe that the Hoseks own all the minerals\n\nunder their tract and the buyers own all the minerals under Ms. Scott’s tract. They\n\nonly gave Ms. Scott a quit claim deed to sign because the deed was ambiguous. The\n\ntrial court’s summary judgment should be reversed and the Hoseks found to own the\n\nminerals (100%) under their land.\n\n      Both parties needed this ambiguous deed interpreted, so attorneys’ fees should\n\nnot have been awarded to either side. Such was not equitable and just.\n\n      The costs of an unnecessarily-long Clerk’s Record requested by Ms. Scott’s\n\ncounsel should not be assessed against the Hoseks. This point is not moot because\n\nthe appellate court could still do this, and such would not be just and equitable.\n\nExpanding the record beyond what was proper was just one of the many techniques\n                                          4\n\fof gamesmanship Ms. Scott’s counsel used to make the appeal cost the Hoseks more\n\nthan it should.\n\n\n                           ARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES\n\nARGUMENT ON FIRST & SECOND ISSUES\n\n        The trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Ms. Scott\n        because the partition deed is ambiguous and summary judgment evidence\n        establishes that a genuine issue of fact exists whether the minerals reverted\n        to the surface owner after the expiration of 25 years and cessation of produc-\n        tion.2\n\n        and\n\n        This summary judgment was harmful error because the partition deed is\n        ambiguous and summary judgment evidence conclusively establishes that\n        the minerals reverted to the surface owner after the expiration of 25 years\n        and cessation of production.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW ON FIRST AND SECOND ISSUES\n\n        To prevail on a summary judgment, the movant is required to prove that there\n\nis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that movant is entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law.

The phrase “This partition does not include any of the oil,\n\n   gas, or other minerals in, on or under the above described tract of land…”\n\n   is an isolated phrase. (Supp. CR 21-22).

It also should not be\n\n   allowed to contradict the patent purpose of the document: to partition the\n\n   estate. While on first blush, the fact that the partition is said to not include\n\n   the minerals may be interpreted to mean the minerals are never partitioned,\n\n   if the whole document is read harmoniously, Frost Nat’l Bank v.

There was testimony from several parties, and\n\ncorrespondence written before the controversy arose that the parties treated the\n\nminerals as reverted to the surface owners. Ms. Hosek testified via affidavit that her\n\nsister told buyers of Ms. Scott’s land that they would own all the minerals under\n\nScott’s land after reversion. (Supp. CR. 49-50). The deposition testimony of Rosale\n\nherself testified that the Hoseks would own the minerals for 14 more years, and then\n\nthe buyer would get the minerals under the Scott tract. (Supp. CR. 64). There was\n\ntestimony that Ms. Scott attempted to break the non-partition agreement before the\n\ntwenty-five years was up so as to be able to transfer all of the minerals under her\n\nland to prospective buyers. (Supp. CR. 76). And in a letter to Mr. King, one eventual\n\nbuyer of Ms. Scott’s land and minerals, Ms. Scott told Mr. King he would get all the\n\nminerals under the land in fourteen years. (Supp. CR 78-79). This is especially\n\ncredible because it all occurred before any controversy came up. (Supp. CR 68).\n\nThe only testimony that Ms. Scott thought the partition would be renegotiated after\n\nthe twenty-five years, (Supp. CR. 72) came up after the conflict arose and much oil\n\nmoney hinged in the balance.\n\n      Thus, the great preponderance of the evidence establishes that the intent of the\n\nparties was that the Hoseks’ minerals have reverted to them and that 100% of the\n\nminerals under the Hoseks’ land belong to them. Therefore, the deed was originally\n\nambiguous, not unambiguous as the trial court decided, and the parol evidence\n\n\n                                         12\n\fconclusively established that the minerals reverted to the surface owners after\n\ntwenty-five years. The summary judgment was harmful because there are currently\n\nproducing oil units into which the minerals under the Hoseks’ land are pooled, but\n\nhalf the money due the Hoseks is not being paid to them, due to Ms. Scotts’ false\n\nclaim. (Supp. CR 50). Other royalty owners are also being denied payment and the\n\nwells may even be abandoned. (Supp. CR 50). The trial court’s summary judgment\n\nmust be reversed.\n\nARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES ON THIRD ISSUE:\n\n      The trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys’ fees because both\n      sides benefitted equally from an interpretation of the deed and an award to\n      Ms. Scott was not fair and equitable.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW ON THIRD ISSUE:\n\n      The standard of review for an award of attorneys’ fees on a declaratory\n\njudgment is abuse of discretion.

She should just have signed the quitclaim deed and\n\nthere never would have been a lawsuit with attorneys’ fees. (Supp. CR 49-50). It is\n\nnot equitable and just to award attorneys’ fees to someone whose defense was\n\ndishonest.\n\n      Even if this Court does not reverse the summary judgment, the attorneys’ fees\n\naward is not just and equitable and should be reversed. “Just and equitable” should\n\nin most cases be tied to the party who caused the necessity of the suit.

App. – San\nAntonio 1989, no writ).\n\nARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES:\n\n      Many unnecessary steps were engaged in by opposing counsel in this case in\n\nan apparent effort by opposing counsel to raise the cost of the case prohibitively for\n\nthe Hoseks. For example, Ms. Scott engaged in lengthy tactics to make the Hoseks\n\nadd parties they did not wish to add, when she could have just added them herself at\n\nminimal expense. Ms. Scott’s legal bills, which she sought to make the Hoseks pay,\n\n\n                                          15\n\fcontained duplication and triplication of effort, and even when cut almost in half,\n\nwere more than those of the Hoseks counsel by more than ten thousand dollars.\n\n      The most outrageous effort, however, was a request for approximately sixteen\n\ndocuments which Ms. Scott’s counsel asked to be added to the record on appeal.\n\n(CR 417). The trial court overruled the Hoseks’ objection to these additions and left\n\nit an open question whether the Hoseks would be forced to pay for this addition.\n\n(CR 427). This was an abuse of discretion, because it was not a fair and equitable\n\naddition. It slowed down the appeal and added to the cost for no reason. Ms. Scott\n\nhad not perfected any appeal. (CR 423). The issues on appeal were two: (1) the\n\ninterpretation of the Partition Deed and (2) the award of attorneys’ fees. (CR 423).\n\nPleadings which had been superseded, or documents, such as documents relevant to\n\nabatement or supercedeas, which were not relevant to any issue on appeal, should\n\nnot have been included in the appellate record and the Hoseks ask that this Court\n\nrule that they are not charged the cost of adding these documents to the record, as\n\nsuch would not be fair and equitable and would be an abuse of discretion.\n\nGamesmanship should not be tolerated when it may affect a party’s ability (and\n\nconstitutional right) to present its case.

A great preponderance\n\nof the evidence of how the Hoseks and Ms. Scott treated the deed, before the conflict\n\narose, conclusively established that the minerals reverted to the surface owner after\n\nthe twenty-five year agreement not to partition included in the deed ended. This\n\nevidence proves that the Hoseks own 100% of the minerals under their land,\n\ntherefore, the trial court’s judgment was harmful because it caused an incorrect\n\njudgment to result and a whole neighborhood of royalty owners to have their royalty\n\npayments withheld – not a small matter when ranching income in the area is\n\ncurrently limited by a pervasive drought.\n\n      Both parties needed the deed interpreted, so the award of attorneys’ fees\n\nagainst just the Hoseks should be reversed. “Just and equitable” is a question of law,\n\nso a judgment proving that neither side should recover attorneys’ fees should be\n\nentered.\n\n      Again, the assessment of costs must be “just and equitable.” Therefore a\n\njudgment should be entered that the Hoseks not pay for the extra Clerks’ Record the\n\ncounsel for Ms. Scott required.\n\n      WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Hoseks ask that the\n\nsummary judgment entered by the trial court be completely reversed, and judgment\n\n                                         17\n\fentered that the deed is ambiguous and the Hoseks own 100% of the minerals under\n\ntheir land.

Mr. Caldwell practices law primarily in civil litigation and oil and gas and is\n\n             familiar withJhe.fees customarily charged in Bexar\n                                                           .. - .   --\n                                                                and Atascosa counties-· on cases\n                                                                                         . ,_    .such\n                                                                                             ·-\"'\"   ___..,_this..... ___ ... _..\n                                                                                                    \"' as            .              _\n\n\n\n\n             one.\n\n                     5.      Mr. Caldwell is familiar with the factors taken into account by the State Bar of\n\n             Texas and courts in the state of Texas in determining reasonable and necessary attorney's fees.\n\n                     6.       Mr. Caldwell is familiar with the fees charged for similar cases in Atascosa\n\n             County, Texas.\n\n                     7.      Since Mr. Caldwell has practiced law in the state of Texas since 1984, he is\n\n             familiar with the range of billing rates for legal services rendered by attorneys possessing his\n\n             experience, skill, knowledge, reputation, and background in the civil litigation field.\n\n                     8.       Attorneys from Bexar County frequently practice law in Atascosa County because\n\n             of, the_~lO.§.€?. ,p_rox!:rpi!y between Bexar and Atascosa Counties. Therefore, it is reasonable to\n\n             charge attorney fee rates from Bexar County in Atascosa County.\n\n                     9.       Mr. Caldwell has experience handling appeals in Texas State appellate courts.\n\n                     10.      Practicing in the civil litigation field regarding mineral titles is a complex area of\n\n             practice.\n\n                     11.      Mr. Caldwell obtained a positive result for Defendant because Defendant\n\n             prevailed on her Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                  Page 12\n       406\n\f                  12.       Plaintiffs did not achieve a benefit by filing the instant litigation to the extent that\n\n           the court found in favor of Defendant.\n\n                   13.      This case was defended by defense counsel on a contingency fee basis for forty\n\n           percent (40%) of the gross amount recovered by Defendant. Defense counsel also advanced\n\n           expenses incurred in this litigation.\n\n                   14.      Even though the law firm of Barton, East & Caldwell, P.L.L.C. defended the case\n\n           on a.contingency basis, the attorneys and legal    st~ff that   worked on the case tracked thei~ tj_me Qn\n\n           an hourly basis.\n\n                   15.      Defendant Rosale Scott submitted copies of time records from the law firm of\n\n           Barton, East and Caldwell, P.L.L.C. reflecting time spent by attorneys and legal staff from May,\n\n           2013 to March 2014. Privileged information was redacted from the time records. The time\n\n           records were attached to Defendant's Motion for Award of Attorneys' Fees and were admitted\n\n           into evidence.\n\n                   16.      The amount of $315.00 per hour ($240.00 for associates) is a fair, reasonable and\n\n           customary hourly fee for an attorney practicing in Atascosa County with the knowledge, skill\n\n           and experience of Mr. Caldwell for this type oflawsuit.\n\n                _U.:.._ ,. TheJe.CLcharged     in this case is well within the parameters of the customarily\n\n           charged fee in Atascosa County, Texas for civillitiga.tion matters.\n\n                   18.      The rates of legal assistants reflected in the time records submitted by Defendant\n\n           are reasonable and necessary and their work was done under the supervision of an attorney.\n'I\n I\n                   19.      The work reflected on the time records submitted by Defendant was reasonable\n\n           and necessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                            Page   13\n     407\n\f..     •   <\n\n\n\n\n                      20.     The time records submitted by Defendant reflect that slightly less than 355 hours\n\n               were spent on the claims which allow recovery of attorneys' fees between May 2013 and\n\n               February 28, 2014. This is a reasonable amount of time in light of the fact that the parties\n\n               engaged in written discovery, took depositions, filed and argued a Plea in Abatement, filed a\n\n               Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, filed a Motion to Strike Expert Report and Exclude\n\n               Expert, filed Motions to Compel, and were set for trial in January 2014.\n\n                      21.     Between the date last reflected in the time records submitted by Defendant,\n\n               additional legal work was performed by Mr. Caldwell as well as other members of his legal staff,\n\n               including preparing, filing and arguing the Motion for Attorneys' Fees, preparing a Final\n\n               Judgment, subpoenaing records from EOG Resources, Inc., and setting the objections of EOG\n\n               Resources, Inc. for hearing.    In his affidavit, Mr. Caldwell estimates that this involves an\n\n               additional 50 hours ofwork. This additional legal work was both reasonable and necessary.\n\n                      22.     Mr. Caldwell provided evidence both in the form of live testimony before the\n\n               court as well as in an affidavit admitted into evidence as to how the fees of his law firm were\n\n               segregated, as required by Texas law.\n\n                      23.     Defendant segregated and did not include, in the fees that Defendant is seeking,\n\n                            - __\n               fees which are related\n                                ,... ...only to the counterclaim or other non-recoverable case matters.\n\n                      24.     The total hours reflected on the time records submitted by Defendant total\n\n               approximately 381.73. From this amount, Defendant segregated and deducted approximately\n\n               28.8 hours that reflected legal services performed for solely non-recoverable claims or other non-\n\n               recoverable case matters.\n\n                      25.     Defendant segregated the attorneys' fees relating to the Motion for Partial\n\n               Summary Judgment and requested 100% of those fees.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          Page 14\n     408\n\f               26.              Non-segregable time entries are time entries where the legal services advance\n\n      - both recoverable and non-recoverable claims and the time entries were not clear if the work\n\n       related solely to the claims which allow recovery of attorneys' fees.\n\n               27.              Mr. Caldwell provided evidence that in his opinion, eighty percent (80%) of these ·\n\n       non-segregable time entries are for work attributable to the claims which allow recovery of\n\n       attorneys' fees and twenty (20%) is related to work attributable to non-recoverable claims.\n\n       Therefore, subtracting the non-recoverable entries and reducing the non-segregable entries by\n\n       twenty percent (20%), the reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees incurred through the last\n\n       invoice on the time records submitted by Defendant are swnmarized and calculated as follows:\n\n       (a) non-segregable fees are $57,945.83; (b) recoverable fees relating to the Motion for Partial\n\n       Summary Judgment are $17,832.49; (c) non-recoverable fees relating to EOG are $6,502.50; and\n\n       (d) non-recoverable fees relating to the counterclaim are $368.00. Accordingly, total attorneys'\n\n       fees are $82,648.82.\n\n               28.              Defendant then segregated and reduced the total attorneys' fees of $82,648.82 by\n\n       the following amounts: (a) $11,589.17 which constituted a 20% reduction ofthe non-segregable\n\n       fees; (b) $6,502.50 which constituted the non-recoverable fees relating to EOG; and (c) $368.00\n\n           .         .   ....   -·-\n       which constituted non-recoverable fees relating to the counter-claim.\n\n               29.              Accordingly, the total attorney fees sought by Defendant through February 28,\n\n       2014 total $64,189.15. These attorneys' fees are both reasonable and necessary.\n\n               30.              Defendant then requested an additional $10,000 of attorneys' fees for additional\n\n       work performed from the date last reflected on the time records through the collection of\n\n       judgment.\n\n               31.              Accordingly, Defendant sought total attorneys' fees in the amount of$74,189.15.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          Page 15\n409\n\f    ..     .!!' •\n              •\n\n\n\n                           32.    $74,189.15 is a reasonable and necessary attorney's fee for the legal services\n\n\\                   performed on behalf of Defendant for the claims which allow recovery of attorneys' fees, for the\n\nI                   work reflected on the time records thru February 28, 2014 and performed thru the entry of a\n\n                    supersedeas bond.\n\n                           33.    If a motion for new trial 'is necessary, a reasonable and necessary, attorneys' fee\n\n                    would be $3,500.00.\n\n                           34.    In the event any part of the judgment is appealed to the appropriate Court of\n\n                    Appeals and Defendant prevails, a reasonable and necessary, attorneys' fee would be\n\n                    $30,000.00.\n\n                           35.    In the event any part of the judgment is appealed to the Texas Supreme Court by\n\n                    Writ or Error and Defendant prevails, a reasonable and necessary, attorneys' fee would be\n\n                    $15,000.00.\n\n                           36.    Should the petition for .review be granted by the Texas Supreme Court and\n\n                    Defendant prevails, a reasonable and necessary, attorneys' fee would be $25,000.00.\n\n                                                             II.\n                                                     CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n                           37.

When a movant files a motion for summary judgment based on summary\n\njudgment evidence, the court can grant the motion only when the movant's evidence proves, as a ·\n\nmatter of law, all the elements of the movant's cause of action or defense, or disproves the facts\n\nof at least one element in the non-movant's cause or defense.\n\n       B.     When evaluating a motion for summary judgment, the court must:\n\n              1.      Assume all the non-movant's proof is true;\n\n              2.      Indulge every reasonable inference in favor of the non-movant; and\n\n              3.      Resolve all doubts about the existence of a genuine issue of material fact\n\n       against the movant.\n\n                                               II.\n\n       A.     The Hoseks, the Non-Movants in this cause, filed a declaratory judgment action\n\n                                                1\n\n                                                                                                              37\n\fI\n\n\n\n\n    \"\"\"'\n           lr.\n\n           r                               •                                         •\n                 against Movant Scott, seeking an interpretation of a Partition Deed. The Partition Deed is\n\n                 attached hereto as Exhibit \"A\". The Partition Deed reads as follows:\n\n                         \"This p~ition does not include any of the oil, gas and other minerals in, on, or under the\n\n                 above described tract of land, and same are to remain undivided for a period of twenty-five(25)\n\n                 years from date hereof and as long thereafter as oil, gas or other minerals are produced in paying\n\n                 quantities from the above described land.\"\n\n                         The conflict over the interpretation of this Deed arises out of the failure of the document\n\n                 to state what will occur after the expiration of the 25 year period and cessation of production.\n\n                 The Deed does not expressly state what happens upon that occurrence, and thus the conflict was\n\n                 born.\n\n                         The deed was drafted by an attorney who is deceased. The Hoseks are aware that the\n\n                 language was intended that the undivided mineral interests revert to the surface owners after the\n\n                 expiration of 25 years and cessation     ~f   production, which occurred in 2004. The Hoseks,\n\n                 together with Ms. Scott, instructed the attorney to prepare an instrument which gave effect to\n\n                 their intention.\n\n                         Movant Scott sold her land with the minerals and received cash consideration for the sale.\n\n                 She now seeks one half of the minerals beneath the Hoseks' land, citing the defective deed as the\n\n                 source of her title. In the letter attached as Exhibit \"5\" to   S~ott's   deposition, Scott tells her\n\n                 prospective buyer that he will receive the minerals under the land she will sell him after the\n\n                 expiration of the 25 year period.\n\n                         Movant filed a counterclaim against Non-Movants seeking affirmative relief for damages\n\n                 and a declaration that she owns one-half of the minerals under the Hoseks' land. Movant is aware\n\n                 that the Hoseks have leased their minerals to an oil company and that royalties are being\n\n\n\n                                                                  2\n\n                                                                                                                         38\n\f                           •                                           •\n withheld until this conflict is resolved. During the course of exploration and development of the\n\n minerals on the Hoseks' property, no oil company or title examiner opined that Movant Scott\n\n owned any interest.\n\n        The Hoseks' retained expert, title examiner Allen D. Cummings, opines that the most\n\n natural interpretation of the Partition Deed language is that the minerals reverted to the surface\n\n owner after the expiration of 25 years and cessation of production. The report of Mr. Cummings,\n\n as well as his CV, are attached to his affidavit, being Exhibit \"C\" hereto.\n\n        B.      Movant alleges there is no genuine issue of material fact as to any element of\n\n interpretation of the Partition Deed. The very existence of this litigation disproves this claim. The\n\n wording is susceptible to multiple meanings by virtue of the Movant's claim that the language\n\n did not have its commonly accepted meaning.\n\n         C.     Non-Movants claim a genuine issue of material fact exists as to Movant's\n\n counterclaim and submit affidavits, discC?very, documentary evidence and Movants' pleadings, as\n\n summary judgment evidence, referenced in an appendix attached hereto, filed with this response\n\n· and incorporated by such reference for all purposes as if recited verbatim herein.\n\n                                                 III.\n\n        A.      Non-Movants filed a claim against Movant seeking affirmative relief for the\n\n interpretation of a Partition Deed.\n\n         B.     Movant alleges Movant is entitled to a partial summary judgment as a matter of\n\n law, and alleges that Movant can prove her counterclaim.\n\n                1.     - Non-Movants claim a genuine issue of material fact exists as to Movant's\n\n         claim and submit affidavits, discovery, documentary evidence and Movants' pleadings, as\n\n         summary judgment evidence, referenced in an appendix attached hereto, filed with this\n\ff.'   :   i\n\n                                   •                                         •\n                 response and incorporated by such reference for all purposes as if recited verbatim herein.\n\n                                                        IV.\n                 A.      The Court should deny Movant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and\n\n          pennit evidence to be presented and heard to establish the proper interpretation of the Partition\n\n          Deed made the basis of this lawsuit. The very existence of this dispute proves that there are\n\n          multiple interpretations of the document, and the evidence presented in this pleading establishes\n\n          that the Non-Movants' interpretation is the proper meaning of the document.\n\n\n\n                                                     PRAYER\n\n                 WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Non-Movants pray that this Court will\n\n          deny Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, or order such other relief as may be\n\n          appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n                                                      By: ----~------+---~----~~------­\n                                                      Robert J.

This court has jurisdiction over the parties because Defendant is a Texas resident.\n\n              D..     Venue in Atascosa County is proper in this cause under Section 15.011 of the\n\n      Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code because this action .involves real property as provided\n\n      by said Section, and this county is where all or part of the·real property is located.\n\n                                                  IV. FACTS\n\n              On October 4, 1978, Fridolin ~ex Voigt and wife, Pearl Schnautz Voigt, deeded the\n\n      family farm to their children, Ivarene Hosek (and her husband Victor) and Resale Scott, in\n\n     undivided shares. Ivarene and Rosale then partitioned the property on August 17, 1979, but\n\n     reserved minerals for twenty five years, so that each would have a one half mineral interest in the\n\n     ·entire tract. The partition gave Ivarene a tract of 207.77 acres, less a 38.5 acre tract, and gave\n\n     Rosale a 130.77 acre tract, plus the 38.5 acres reserved out of Ivarene's 207.77 acres. Ivarene\n\n     then purchased back from Rosale the 38.5 acres on October 16, 1979, so that she possessed the\n\n     original 207.77 acre tract. The 38.5 acre purchase also reserved minerals for 25 years. After 25\n\n     years, on August 17, 2004, the minerals reverted back to the owner of the respective tracts.\n\n     Resale sold approximately 60 acres of her acreage to Evaristo Morales and wife, Rene Morales\n\n     on March 4, 1986. Then Rosale sold approximately 70 acres to William W. King and wife, Rosie\n\n     King on January 29, 1990. Ivarene still owns her 207.77 acres together with her husband, Victor\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        2\n\f.;\n:\n\n\n\n\n       Hosek.\n                               ••                                        •\n                Ivarene has attempted to lease her acreage for oil and gas production, and Rosale claims\n\n       an interest in some of the minerals under Ivarene's land. Rosale's claims are unfounded in law\n\n       and in fact and are costing Ivarene substantial potential oil and gas income by making a claim for\n\n     · payment of funds to which she is not entitled.\n\n                                         V. RELIEF REQUESTED\n\n              There exists a genuine controversy between the parties herein that would be terminated\n\n      by the granting of declaratory judgment. Plaintiffs therefore request that declaratory judgment\n\n      be entered as follows;   ·\n\n             A.       A judgment of the court that Ivarene Hosek and Victor Hosek own one hundred\n\n      per cent of the minerals, including oil and gas, lying under their property, described in Exhibit A\n\n      attached hereto and made a part hereof, and a judgment of the court that Rosale Scott owns no\n\n      minerals lying under the said tract.\n\n\n                                         VI.

We agreed to let the minerals remain undivided for a period of twenty five\n\nyears and as long thereafter as oil and gas were being produced. After that time, the minerals\n\nwould be vested in the surface owner. This is the document that our attorney, Joe R. Wiseman,\n\nwas directed to draft, and it was signed by us on August 17, 1979. My sister and I shared the cost\n\nof the attorney fees to Joe Wiseman to prepare this document. My sister knew of our agreement\n\nregarding the minerals and told this to her buyers, who purchased her property after my sister\n\ntold them they would own the minerals after the expiration of the twenty five year period, being\n\nAugust 17, 2004.\n\n       My sister only made this claim for one half of the minerals under my property after being\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     49\n\f                                                                   •\nasked by the oil company to sign a title curative document to address the poorly drafted Partition\n\nDeed. The oil companies who researched the title read this document and presumed that my\n\nhusband and I owned all the minerals under our property after the expiration of the twenty five\n\nyear period. My sister is fully aware of this. My sister has sold her land with the minerals and\n\nbeen paid for them, now she wants half of my minerals. Her actions have prevented me and all\n\nmineral owners of the pooled well unit from being paid any royalties. The oil company, EOG,\n\nhas made it known to me that it may need to either abandon the well unit that has been drilled or\n\nexclude our acreage from the pooled unit if this issue is not resolved.

San Antonio St.\n        Boerne, TX 78006\n\n        Re:          Deed of Partition dated 8/17/1979, recorded 510 DR 126, Atascosa County, Texas, by\n                     and between Victor Hosek, and wife, Ivarene Voigt Hosek and Rosale Voigt Scott.\n\n        Dear Mr. Ogle:\n\n       You have asked me to provide you my opinion, based solely on my review of the above-\n       referenced Deed of Partition, concerning the ownership of the oil, gas and other minerals in and\n       under the lands described in said Deed of Partition. The lands in Deed of Partition are described\n       as a 207.77-acre tract ofland, described by metes and bounds, in the \"First\" section of the Deed\n       of Partition and tracts of 130.77 acres and 38.5 acres, each described by metes and bounds, in the\n       \"Second\" section of the Deed of Partition. The Deed of Partition recites that the parties hold the\n       lands described in common. Following the description of the lands in each section of the Deed\n      ;of Partition is the following clause:\n                     This partition does not include any of the oil, gas and other minerals in, on or\n                     under the above described tract of land, and same are to remain undivided for a\n                     period of twenty-five years from the date hereof and as long thereafter as oil, gas\n                     or other minerals are produced in paying quantities from the above descn'bed\n                     land.\n       This clause does not say what is the effect of the Partition Deed at the end of 25 years, i.e. on\n       8/17/2004, if there was not then, and thereafter, production in paying quantities from the lands\n       described. Therefore, in order to detennine the present ownership of the oil, gas and other\n       minerals in the lands described in the Deed of Partition, assuming there has not been continuous\n       production in paying quantities, we must determine the effect of this clause.\n\n       Whether this clause renders the Deed of Partition ambiguous is a question of law to be\n       detennined by a court. However, the cases on construction of deeds and contracts show that the\n       courts will first apply the rules of construction to determine from the four comers of the\n       instrument the intent of the parties as expressed in the instrument, regardless of what may have\n       been the subjective intent of the parties to the instrument.

If. after the application of the rules of construction, there are two or more\n       reasonable interpretations, then a court may find the instrument is ambiguous.

Ogle\n        November 29,2013\n        Page2of2\n                                                 •                            •\n        It is well settled that a partition deed does not convey title, but rather dissolves the. tenancy of\n        lands owned' in comrtlon and segregates the possession and use of the·landS anicmg individual co-\n        owne~ .. Houston 0!/. Co. ofTexas v. Kirkindr;zll, 1.45 s~w.2d 1074 (Te~. l94l). In addition,\n        there is a presumption tlla,t wb,en lands. are partitioned among co-owners; the whole of the land is\n        partitioned, unless some portion of the lapd is expressly excepted from the partition. Pewitt v.\n        RenwarOi/ Corp., 261 S~W.2d 904, 906 (Tex. Civ-. App.- Houston, 1962,.-wrlt refused n.r.e.)\n\n        Readi~g the above clauseJn light of these twO principles, It would appeat tht1t the parties.to the\n        Deed. of Partition, expressly excluded from the partition the oil, gas al1Cl othet minerals in the\n        lands for a tet.ni detli1ed as \"twenty-five years ~ . . and as long thereafter as ·oil, gas or other\n        minerals are produced i.n paying qiJ!intities from the above described land.\" It woulc;I also appear\n        the most reasonable construction of this clause, even though it Is not expressly stated~ is the\n        parties fntended, after the expressly excluded term, that ilie use and posseS.sion of the oil, gas and\n        other minerals would ·be segregated to the owners of the individual trE).cts described in· the first\n        and second section~ of the Deed of Partition. In other words, the exclusio~ from the wtended\n        partition of possession and use of all the lands as to. oil, gas and other minerals ends after 25\n        years or, if there is production in paying quantities from theJands, then when there is no longer\n        production in paying quantities. ItJs,important tO note again, the partition deed does hot affect\n        title to the {a(lds, but only the se~gation of possession and use.\n\n    You:haye as~ed me ~o provide you my opinion about whether such a construction of the Deed of\n    Partition violates the Rule AgainSt Perpetuities (the \"Rule\")~ The Rule i~ applicable to. a future\n    estate? which may not vest during lives in being plus twenty·one year~; it has no application to\n    present interests or •to provisions which m~y postpose possession beyond a period of lives in\n    being and twenty·one years. See generally, Kelly v. WQmack, 268 S. \\V. 2g 903, 905 (Tex. 1954)\n    and Hamman v. Bright &Co., 924 S.W:2d 168, (Tex. App• ., Amarillo 1996). In as much as the\n    Deed of Partition does not affect title,_ but only the segregation of the use and possession of the\n                                                                   in\n   :oil, gas and other minerals by the co-owners whojoined the partition, it would appear that the\n   above construction would not be subject to the Rule. Because the parties. own title to the lands\n    subject. to the Deed of Partition in common, only the segre.gatio+t of use and possession of the oil,\n    gas and other minerals is postponed for the Stated term. Without this clause, ilie oil,_ gas and\n    other minerals woUld have been partitioned upon exec1.rtion and delivery of the. Deed o(Partition.\n\n    Based on the foregoing, it is my opinion that use .and posse~sion of t~e oil. gO$ a~d other\n    miner.:Us in the lands descdbed in the Deed of Partition; is vested in the party to vv~()m the\n    individul,ll tia9ts are partitioned therein, absent continuous production in paying· quantities from\n    and after 8/1712004. This opinion is based on solely on examination ofthe Deed ofPattition as a\n    single document and without ilie benefit ofother instrum~nts in the chain of ti:tle that could affect\n    my opini_on on the effect ofthe Deed of partition.                               .\n\n\n        ~-~~~-·\n          truly,.· ~ ·•.\n        t   .         . . .·                .\n    ;             '      .'\n f...       .:.           • ...... ,   .·   ..\n\n\n\n\n/ Allen D.
