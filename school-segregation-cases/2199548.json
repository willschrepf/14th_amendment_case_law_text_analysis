Clark\n\n\nrespondents are entitled to attorney fees on appeal will be determined by the outcome of\n\nthe remand.\n\n                                         FACTS\n\n       Mike and Marcia Walch own Rainier Skyline Excavators, Inc. (RSE), a company\n\nthat designs and builds portable hydraulic track drive skyline excavators. In 2000, the\n\nWalches became interested in buying some property in Cle Elum, Washington. They\n\nwanted to use the property, which included a pond known as the DaIle Pond, to\n\ndemonstrate, display, and sell RSE's machinery as well as to manufacture excavators.\n\nMany components used to assemble the excavators must be transported on extra-long\n\nlowboy trailers, called superloads. These superloads can be up to 165 feet in length and\n\ncan carry several hundred thousand pounds.\n\n      The Walches purchased the property in May 2004. The real estate contract\n\nidentifies the Walches' access to the property by way of an existing easement over the\n\nproperty located to the east of the Walches' property, then continuing east over and\n\nacross the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad corridor, and then proceeding\n\nnorth over and across the BNSF railroad crossing to Owens Road, \"so long as the railroad\n\nshall allow.\" Ex 1. At that point, Owens Road becomes a public right-of- way owned by\n\nthe city ofCle Elum (City).\n\n      The City has a private agreement with the Owens family to use Owens Road south\n\nof the BNSF railroad crossing to access the City's sewage treatment plant. A trucking\n\n                                             2\n\n\fNo. 30129-0-111\nWalch v. Clark\n\n\ncompany and several private residents all use the BNSF crossing on Owens Road for\n\naccess to their respective properties, but they do not have permits from BNSF to cross the\n\nrailroad right-of-way.\n\n        The respondents in this action, the Clarks and the Folkmans, own property located\n\nto the west of the Walches' property, in the Swiftwater Business Park. All the property\n\nowned by the parties in this action is presently zoned by the City as being within its\n\nIndustrial District. I\n\n        On August 9,2010, the Walches filed suit for a 30-foot easement across the\n\nrespondents' properties. The Walches alleged that a road existed at this location, and that\n\nthey used this road to access the property when they were deciding whether to purchase. 2\n\nThe Walches claimed an easement implied from prior use and/or prescription or,\n\nalternatively, an easement by necessity pursuant to RCW 8.24.010.\n\n       The trial court dismissed the common law claims for prescriptive easement or\n\nimplied easement by prior use before trial. However, the statutory claim proceeded to\n\nbench trial, where the Walches claimed they were entitled to an easement by necessity\n\nbecause their property was effectively landlocked for several reasons: (1) they had no\n\nlegal, insurable access over the railroad right-of-way, and (2) as a practical matter they\n\n\n\n\n        I   See chapter 17.36 of the Cle Elum Municipal Code.\n       2The respondents disputed this claim, and the trial court found that there was no\nevidence that a road ever existed at this location.\n\n                                              3\n\n\fNo. 30 129-0-III\nWalch v. Clark\n\n\ncould not physically enter or exit the property because the super-lowboy trailers could not\n\nuse Owens Road. 3\n\n       Mr. Walch testified that he had not taken any steps to submit any land use\n\napplications for the property because he did not want to do any studies or plans until they\n\nhad legal access to the property. He also acknowledged that he had not hired any\n\nengineers to examine the route feasibility or made any attempts to obtain an estimate of\n\nthe cost of improving Owens Road for the use of the super-lowboys. Additionally, he\n\ntestified that the Walches could not get their access insured because they do not have a\n\nBNSF permitted easement for access to their property. The Walches had not sought a\n\npermit to cross the railroad at Owens Road.\n\n       City administrator Matt Morton testified that the Walches had never submitted any\n\nland use applications, their intended use of the property would be a conditional use, there\n\nwas no guarantee that the Walches would be permitted to use the property for RSE, and it\n\nwas premature to give an opinion on whether the City would grant a permit of any kind.\n\nHe also testified that the Dalle Pond on the Walch property is classified as a category\n\nthree wetland, which could further complicate the land use permit process.\n\n\n\n\n       3 In particular, they alleged that the superloads could not negotiate the turns at\nOwens Road, which also was too narrow, and the trailers would get high centered on the\nrailroad tracks.\n\n                                              4\n\n\fNo. 30129-0-111\nWalch v. Clark\n\n\n       The trial court dismissed the Walches' RCW 8.24.010 claim without prejudice,\n\nfinding that the Wa1ches had physical access to their property over the BNSF railroad\n\ncrossing and that until such access was denied or withdrawn the Walches could make use\n\nand enjoyment of their property for those uses authorized by the City within the industrial\n\nzone. The court concluded that the property was not landlocked and there was no\n\nguarantee that RSE could be situated on the property.\n\n       Respondents requested attorney fees and costs under RCW 8.24.030 for defending\n\nall three easement claims. Finding that the claims all involved the same underlying set of\n\nfacts and were so interrelated that segregation of fees was not required, the trial court\n\nawarded attorney fees for defending all three claims. The Wa1ches then timely appealed\n\nto this court.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n       The Wa1ches challenge the court's statutory easement ruling and the attorney fee\n\nawards. All parties seek attorney fees on appeal. We will first discuss the easement\n\nruling before turning to the fee arguments.\n\n       Easement\n\n       The trial court determined that the Wa1ches had \"not established a reasonable\n\nnecessity for a private way of necessity because their property is not landlocked and\n\nbecause they have no guarantee that a future use of their property would include situating\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\n\fNo. 30129-0-111\nWalch v. Clark\n\n\nthe RSE, Inc. manufacturing business on the property.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 251. We\n\nagree with both of those assessments and affirm the denial of the easement.\n\n      This matter was tried on the authority ofRCW 8.24.010 that provides:\n\n      An owner, or one entitled to the beneficial use, of land which is so situate\n      with respect to the land of another that it is necessary for its proper use and\n      enjoyment to have and maintain a private way of necessity ... on, across,\n      over or through the land of such other ... may condemn and take lands of\n      such other sufficient in area for the construction and maintenance of such\n      private way of necessity. . .. The term \"private way of necessity,\" as used\n      in this chapter, shall mean and include a right of way on, across, over or\n      through the land of another for means of ingress and egress.\n\n      This statute is \"not favored in law and thus must be construed strictly.\" Brown v.\n\nMcAnally, 97 Wn.2d 360,370,644 P.2d 1153 (1982). To condemn a private way of\n\nnecessity, the Wa1ches needed to show that access over the respondents' property was\n\nreasonably necessary for the proper use and enjoyment of their property. See id.\n\n      The landowner's necessity does not have to be absolute, but it must be reasonably\n\nnecessary under the facts of the case. State ex reI. Polson Logging Co. v. Superior Court,\n\n11 Wn.2d 545, 562-63, 119 P.2d 694 (1941). It is insufficient to show that the proposed\n\nroute is more convenient or advantageous than another route. State ex. reI Carlson v.\n\nSuperior Courtfor Kitsap County, 107 Wash. 228, 232, 181 P. 689 (1919). The party\n\nseeking to condemn the private way bears the burden of proving the reasonable necessity,\n\nincluding the absence ofaltematives. Noble v. Safo Harbor Family Pres. Trust, 167\n\nWn.2d 11, 17,216 P.3d 1007 (2009).\n\n\n                                             6\n\n\fNo. 30129-0-111\nWalch v. Clark\n\n\n       However, \"a potential condemnor should not be prevented from condemning a\n\nprivate way of necessity merely because the condemnor may enjoy the permissive user of\n\na 'way.'\" Brown, 97 Wn.2d at 368. The WaIches primarily rely upon this quote from\n\nBro\",!n, arguing that although they currently have access to the property, they have no\n\nlegally protected access and are entitled to pursue their private condemnation action. We\n\nagree. The existence of an access route does not bar a private condemnation action under\n\nthe statute. 4 Id. at 366-68. Existing access, however, is evidence that can be considered\n\nin adjudging the necessity of the proposed private condemnation action. That is how the\n\ntrial court treated the matter.\n\n       The existing access is strong evidence that the property is not currently\n\nlandlocked. There also was evidence that the Walches had not undertaken efforts to\n\ndetermine the feasibility of obtaining permission from BNSF railroad or of improving the\n\nexisting access route to accommodate the superloads RSE would need to use. In light of\n\nthese facts, the trial court did not err in determining that the property was not landlocked.\n\n       The trial court also determined that necessity had not been established because it\n\nwas only speculative that RSE would be able to use the property for its intended\n\n\n\n       4 The Walches seek to extend Brown and apply the statute to condemn a new route\nrather than obtain legal standing to their existing route. In light of our agreement with the\ntrial court that the WaIches did not prove the necessity for private condemnation, we do\nnot address the propriety of their proposed route or of their argument for extending\nBrown.\n\n                                              7\n\n\fNo. 30129-0-111\nWalch v. Clark\n\n\npurposes. The testimony showed that a conditional use permit would be necessary to\n\naddress zoning related restrictions on the property and there also were environmental\n\nconcerns to address. Given these hurdles, it was understandable that the superloads\n\nmight never need to.access the property.\n\n       In Brown, the would-be condemners received approval of their proposed\n\ndevelopment on various conditions that included the need to obtain an easement\n\npermitting access to the property. Id. at 364-65. The Walches approached the matter\n\nfrom the opposite perspective by attempting to obtain their access before seeking\n\napproval of their development plans. While there is no legal impediment to using this\n\napproach, the uncertainty of the property's future use is a proper fact for the trier of fact\n\nto consider in assessing the necessity of the proposed private condemnation.\n\n       The record supported the trial court's determination that the Walches had not\n\nestablished the necessity of their proposed private condemnation. The property was not\n\ncurrently landlocked and it was uncertain whether future access would be inadequate.\n\nWe thus affirm that aspect of the judgment.\n\n       Attorney Fees\n\n       The Walches attack the trial court's ruling assessing fees against them for defense\n\nof the common law claims as well as the reasonableness of the fee award. All parties\n\nseek attorney fees on appeal and the respondents also suggest alternative bases for\n\nupholding the fee award. We conclude that the trial court erred in not segregating the fee\n\n                                              8\n\n\fNo. 30129-0-111\nWalch v. Clark\n\n\nawards, the fees were otherwise reasonable, and we remand for consideration of the CR\n\n11 claim that was raised, but not decided, at trial. The Walches are not awarded any fees\n\nfor the appeal; whether respondents obtain appellate attorney fees is dependent upon the\n\noutcome of the remand. We approach the fee question in a slightly different manner than\n\nit was presented by the parties.\n\n       RCW 8.24.030. Attorney fees in a private condemnation action are governed by\n\nRCW 8.24.030, which provides in relevant part:\n\n       In any action brought under the provisions of this chapter for the\n       condemnation of land for a private way of necessity, reasonable attorneys'\n       fees and expert witness costs may be allowed by the court to reimburse the \n\n       condemnee. \n\n\n       This court reviews a trial court's award of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion. \n\n\nMahler v. Szucs, 135 Wn.2d 398, 435,957 P.2d 632 (1998). Discretion is abused when it\n\nis exercised on untenable grounds or for untenable reasons. State ex rei. Carroll v.\n\nJunker, 79 Wn.2d 12,26,482 P.2d 775 (1971).\n\n       Attorney fees should be awarded only for services related to causes of action that\n\nallow for fees. Absher Constr. Co. v. Kent Sch. Dist. No. 415, 79 Wn. App. 841, 847, 917\n\nP .2d 1086 (1995). If fees are authorized for only some of the claims, the fee award must\n\nproperly reflect a segregation of time spent on issues for which fees are authorized from\n\ntime spent on other issues. Hume v. Am. Disposal Co., 124 Wn.2d 656,672,880 P.2d\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\n\fNo. 30129-0-111\nWalch v. Clark\n\n\n988 (1994). However, if the claims are so related that no reasonable segregation can be\n\nmade, the court does not need to require segregation. See id. at 673.\n\n       In awarding attorney fees, Washington courts apply the lodestar method and the\n\ntrial court must enter findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting its decision to\n\naward fees. Mahler, 135 Wn.2d. at 434-35. The findings are necessary for an appellate\n\ncourt to review the award. Bentzen v. Demmons, 68 Wn. App. 339, 350, 842 P.2d 1015\n\n(1993). Where a trial court fails to create the appropriate record, remand for entry of\n\nproper findings and conclusions is the appropriate remedy. Mahler, 135 Wn.2d at 435.\n\n       The Walches asserted three easement claims: an easement by necessity under\n\nRCW 8.24.010, a prescriptive easement, and an implied easement by prior use. The latter\n\ntwo common law claims were dismissed by agreement at summary judgment. After\n\nprevailing at trial, the respondents presented requests for attorney fees that segregated the\n\nfees related to the statutory action from those related to the common law claims, but\n\nargued on various theories that they were also entitled to attorney fees for defending the\n\ncommon law claims.\n\n       The Walches contend on appeal that the court erred by finding that the claims\n\nwere too interrelated to segregate and that the fee award was excessive. We agree that·\n\nthe claims could be segregated and reverse the trial court's finding that it was not\n\nappropriate to segregate. However, we see no abuse of discretion in assessing the amount\n\nof attorney fees for the defense of the statutory claim.\n\n                                              10 \n\n\fNo. 30 129-0-III\nWalch v. Clark\n\n\n       Initially, we agree with the Wa1ches that RCW 8.24.030 does not apply to the\n\ncommon law claims. The statute applies to any actions \"brought under the provisions of\n\nthis chapter.\" RCW8.24.030. It does not thereby extend to all related claims. However,\n\nthe trial court still has authority to grant the entirety of a fee request when it is impractical\n\nto segregate covered and noncovered claims. Bume, 124 Wn.2d at 673.\n\n       While that is how the trial court treated the requests here, it was not impractical to\n\nsegregate the claims. The respondents did in fact segregate their requests. Indeed, the\n\ntrial court also awarded fees to the respondents based on each category of claims. There\n\nwere three distinct legal theories subject to different discovery and legal research efforts.\n\nIt was not impractical to segregate. The trial court erred in concluding otherwise.\n\n       The Wa1ches also challenge the reasonableness of the total fee award. We see no\n\nabuse of discretion. The Walches imposed significant costs on their neighbors who\n\nproperly proved their defense costs, including the claims that were not subject to\n\nreimbursement under the statute. The Wa1ches do not challenge the hourly rate charged\n\nby respective counsel. The court reviewed the time slips and properly applied the\n\nlodestar formula to calculate the fee award. The fees awarded each respondent were\n\nreasonable. The Walches sought an easement across commercial property owned by two\n\nparties and cannot now claim it was unreasonable for both respondents to fully contest\n\nthe action at great expense to all.\n\n\n\n\n                                               11 \n\n                                                                                                    I\n                                                                                                    ,\n                                                                                                    r\n\fNo. 30129-0-111\nWalch v. Clark\n\n\n       The attorney fee awards for the defense of the statutory claim are affirmed; the\n\nawards under the statute for the defense of the common law claims are reversed.\n\n       Common Law Theories. Respondents also sought CR 11 sanctions in the trial\n\ncourt on the common law claims, arguing that they were brought without proper\n\ninvestigation. The trial court did not address this argumem in light of its decision to grant\n\nfees under the statute. On appeal, the respondents reprise this argument as an alternative\n\nbasis for affirming the fee award.

This appeal was not frivolous. The Walches presented\n\na debatable issue concerning the necessity of their private condemnation action. The\n\nstatute does provide a basis for awarding fees to the respondents. However, at this point\n\nthey have not substantially prevailed. While they have won on the merits of the private\n\ncondemnation action, their attorney fee award has been reduced, at least temporarily.\n\n       If, on remand, respondents prevail on their CR 11 argument and regain their fees\n\nfor the common law claims, the trial court also should award respondents their reasonable\n\nattorney fees for defending the appeal in this court.

(RSE), a company\n\nthat designs and builds portable hydraulic track drive skyline excavators. In 2000, the\n\nWalches became interested in buying some property in Cle Elum, Washington. They\n\nwanted to use the property, which included a pond known as the DaIle Pond, to\n\ndemonstrate, display, and sell RSE's machinery as well as to manufacture excavators.\n\nMany components used to assemble the excavators must be transported on extra-long\n\nlowboy trailers, called superloads. These superloads can be up to 165 feet in length and\n\ncan carry several hundred thousand pounds.\n\n      The Walches purchased the property in May 2004. The real estate contract\n\nidentifies the Walches' access to the property by way of an existing easement over the\n\nproperty located to the east of the Walches' property, then continuing east over and\n\nacross the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad corridor, and then proceeding\n\nnorth over and across the BNSF railroad crossing to Owens Road, \"so long as the railroad\n\nshall allow.\" Ex 1. At that point, Owens Road becomes a public right-of- way owned by\n\nthe city ofCle Elum (City).\n\n      The City has a private agreement with the Owens family to use Owens Road south\n\nof the BNSF railroad crossing to access the City's sewage treatment plant. A trucking\n\n                                             2\n\n\fNo. 30129-0-111\nWalch v. Clark\n\n\ncompany and several private residents all use the BNSF crossing on Owens Road for\n\naccess to their respective properties, but they do not have permits from BNSF to cross the\n\nrailroad right-of-way.\n\n        The respondents in this action, the Clarks and the Folkmans, own property located\n\nto the west of the Walches' property, in the Swiftwater Business Park. All the property\n\nowned by the parties in this action is presently zoned by the City as being within its\n\nIndustrial District. I\n\n        On August 9,2010, the Walches filed suit for a 30-foot easement across the\n\nrespondents' properties. The Walches alleged that a road existed at this location, and that\n\nthey used this road to access the property when they were deciding whether to purchase. 2\n\nThe Walches claimed an easement implied from prior use and/or prescription or,\n\nalternatively, an easement by necessity pursuant to RCW 8.24.010.\n\n       The trial court dismissed the common law claims for prescriptive easement or\n\nimplied easement by prior use before trial. However, the statutory claim proceeded to\n\nbench trial, where the Walches claimed they were entitled to an easement by necessity\n\nbecause their property was effectively landlocked for several reasons: (1) they had no\n\nlegal, insurable access over the railroad right-of-way, and (2) as a practical matter they\n\n\n\n\n        I   See chapter 17.36 of the Cle Elum Municipal Code.\n       2The respondents disputed this claim, and the trial court found that there was no\nevidence that a road ever existed at this location.\n\n                                              3\n\n\fNo. 30 129-0-III\nWalch v. Clark\n\n\ncould not physically enter or exit the property because the super-lowboy trailers could not\n\nuse Owens Road. 3\n\n       Mr. Walch testified that he had not taken any steps to submit any land use\n\napplications for the property because he did not want to do any studies or plans until they\n\nhad legal access to the property. He also acknowledged that he had not hired any\n\nengineers to examine the route feasibility or made any attempts to obtain an estimate of\n\nthe cost of improving Owens Road for the use of the super-lowboys. Additionally, he\n\ntestified that the Walches could not get their access insured because they do not have a\n\nBNSF permitted easement for access to their property. The Walches had not sought a\n\npermit to cross the railroad at Owens Road.\n\n       City administrator Matt Morton testified that the Walches had never submitted any\n\nland use applications, their intended use of the property would be a conditional use, there\n\nwas no guarantee that the Walches would be permitted to use the property for RSE, and it\n\nwas premature to give an opinion on whether the City would grant a permit of any kind.\n\nHe also testified that the Dalle Pond on the Walch property is classified as a category\n\nthree wetland, which could further complicate the land use permit process.\n\n\n\n\n       3 In particular, they alleged that the superloads could not negotiate the turns at\nOwens Road, which also was too narrow, and the trailers would get high centered on the\nrailroad tracks.\n\n                                              4\n\n\fNo. 30129-0-111\nWalch v. Clark\n\n\n       The trial court dismissed the Walches' RCW 8.24.010 claim without prejudice,\n\nfinding that the Wa1ches had physical access to their property over the BNSF railroad\n\ncrossing and that until such access was denied or withdrawn the Walches could make use\n\nand enjoyment of their property for those uses authorized by the City within the industrial\n\nzone. The court concluded that the property was not landlocked and there was no\n\nguarantee that RSE could be situated on the property.\n\n       Respondents requested attorney fees and costs under RCW 8.24.030 for defending\n\nall three easement claims. Finding that the claims all involved the same underlying set of\n\nfacts and were so interrelated that segregation of fees was not required, the trial court\n\nawarded attorney fees for defending all three claims. The Wa1ches then timely appealed\n\nto this court.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n       The Wa1ches challenge the court's statutory easement ruling and the attorney fee\n\nawards. All parties seek attorney fees on appeal. We will first discuss the easement\n\nruling before turning to the fee arguments.\n\n       Easement\n\n       The trial court determined that the Wa1ches had \"not established a reasonable\n\nnecessity for a private way of necessity because their property is not landlocked and\n\nbecause they have no guarantee that a future use of their property would include situating\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\n\fNo. 30129-0-111\nWalch v.

We\n\nagree with both of those assessments and affirm the denial of the easement.\n\n      This matter was tried on the authority ofRCW 8.24.010 that provides:\n\n      An owner, or one entitled to the beneficial use, of land which is so situate\n      with respect to the land of another that it is necessary for its proper use and\n      enjoyment to have and maintain a private way of necessity ... on, across,\n      over or through the land of such other ... may condemn and take lands of\n      such other sufficient in area for the construction and maintenance of such\n      private way of necessity. . ..

The WaIches primarily rely upon this quote from\n\nBro\",!n, arguing that although they currently have access to the property, they have no\n\nlegally protected access and are entitled to pursue their private condemnation action. We\n\nagree. The existence of an access route does not bar a private condemnation action under\n\nthe statute. 4 Id. at 366-68. Existing access, however, is evidence that can be considered\n\nin adjudging the necessity of the proposed private condemnation action. That is how the\n\ntrial court treated the matter.\n\n       The existing access is strong evidence that the property is not currently\n\nlandlocked. There also was evidence that the Walches had not undertaken efforts to\n\ndetermine the feasibility of obtaining permission from BNSF railroad or of improving the\n\nexisting access route to accommodate the superloads RSE would need to use. In light of\n\nthese facts, the trial court did not err in determining that the property was not landlocked.\n\n       The trial court also determined that necessity had not been established because it\n\nwas only speculative that RSE would be able to use the property for its intended\n\n\n\n       4 The Walches seek to extend Brown and apply the statute to condemn a new route\nrather than obtain legal standing to their existing route. In light of our agreement with the\ntrial court that the WaIches did not prove the necessity for private condemnation, we do\nnot address the propriety of their proposed route or of their argument for extending\nBrown.\n\n                                              7\n\n\fNo. 30129-0-111\nWalch v. Clark\n\n\npurposes. The testimony showed that a conditional use permit would be necessary to\n\naddress zoning related restrictions on the property and there also were environmental\n\nconcerns to address. Given these hurdles, it was understandable that the superloads\n\nmight never need to.access the property.\n\n       In Brown, the would-be condemners received approval of their proposed\n\ndevelopment on various conditions that included the need to obtain an easement\n\npermitting access to the property. Id. at 364-65. The Walches approached the matter\n\nfrom the opposite perspective by attempting to obtain their access before seeking\n\napproval of their development plans. While there is no legal impediment to using this\n\napproach, the uncertainty of the property's future use is a proper fact for the trier of fact\n\nto consider in assessing the necessity of the proposed private condemnation.\n\n       The record supported the trial court's determination that the Walches had not\n\nestablished the necessity of their proposed private condemnation. The property was not\n\ncurrently landlocked and it was uncertain whether future access would be inadequate.\n\nWe thus affirm that aspect of the judgment.\n\n       Attorney Fees\n\n       The Walches attack the trial court's ruling assessing fees against them for defense\n\nof the common law claims as well as the reasonableness of the fee award. All parties\n\nseek attorney fees on appeal and the respondents also suggest alternative bases for\n\nupholding the fee award. We conclude that the trial court erred in not segregating the fee\n\n                                              8\n\n\fNo. 30129-0-111\nWalch v. Clark\n\n\nawards, the fees were otherwise reasonable, and we remand for consideration of the CR\n\n11 claim that was raised, but not decided, at trial. The Walches are not awarded any fees\n\nfor the appeal; whether respondents obtain appellate attorney fees is dependent upon the\n\noutcome of the remand. We approach the fee question in a slightly different manner than\n\nit was presented by the parties.\n\n       RCW 8.24.030. Attorney fees in a private condemnation action are governed by\n\nRCW 8.24.030, which provides in relevant part:\n\n       In any action brought under the provisions of this chapter for the\n       condemnation of land for a private way of necessity, reasonable attorneys'\n       fees and expert witness costs may be allowed by the court to reimburse the \n\n       condemnee. \n\n\n       This court reviews a trial court's award of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion. \n\n\nMahler v.

Where a trial court fails to create the appropriate record, remand for entry of\n\nproper findings and conclusions is the appropriate remedy. Mahler, 135 Wn.2d at 435.\n\n       The Walches asserted three easement claims: an easement by necessity under\n\nRCW 8.24.010, a prescriptive easement, and an implied easement by prior use. The latter\n\ntwo common law claims were dismissed by agreement at summary judgment. After\n\nprevailing at trial, the respondents presented requests for attorney fees that segregated the\n\nfees related to the statutory action from those related to the common law claims, but\n\nargued on various theories that they were also entitled to attorney fees for defending the\n\ncommon law claims.\n\n       The Walches contend on appeal that the court erred by finding that the claims\n\nwere too interrelated to segregate and that the fee award was excessive. We agree that·\n\nthe claims could be segregated and reverse the trial court's finding that it was not\n\nappropriate to segregate. However, we see no abuse of discretion in assessing the amount\n\nof attorney fees for the defense of the statutory claim.\n\n                                              10 \n\n\fNo. 30 129-0-III\nWalch v.

The statute applies to any actions \"brought under the provisions of\n\nthis chapter.\" RCW8.24.030. It does not thereby extend to all related claims. However,\n\nthe trial court still has authority to grant the entirety of a fee request when it is impractical\n\nto segregate covered and noncovered claims. Bume, 124 Wn.2d at 673.\n\n       While that is how the trial court treated the requests here, it was not impractical to\n\nsegregate the claims. The respondents did in fact segregate their requests. Indeed, the\n\ntrial court also awarded fees to the respondents based on each category of claims. There\n\nwere three distinct legal theories subject to different discovery and legal research efforts.\n\nIt was not impractical to segregate. The trial court erred in concluding otherwise.\n\n       The Wa1ches also challenge the reasonableness of the total fee award. We see no\n\nabuse of discretion. The Walches imposed significant costs on their neighbors who\n\nproperly proved their defense costs, including the claims that were not subject to\n\nreimbursement under the statute. The Wa1ches do not challenge the hourly rate charged\n\nby respective counsel. The court reviewed the time slips and properly applied the\n\nlodestar formula to calculate the fee award. The fees awarded each respondent were\n\nreasonable. The Walches sought an easement across commercial property owned by two\n\nparties and cannot now claim it was unreasonable for both respondents to fully contest\n\nthe action at great expense to all.\n\n\n\n\n                                               11 \n\n                                                                                                    I\n                                                                                                    ,\n                                                                                                    r\n\fNo. 30129-0-111\nWalch v. Clark\n\n\n       The attorney fee awards for the defense of the statutory claim are affirmed; the\n\nawards under the statute for the defense of the common law claims are reversed.\n\n       Common Law Theories. Respondents also sought CR 11 sanctions in the trial\n\ncourt on the common law claims, arguing that they were brought without proper\n\ninvestigation. The trial court did not address this argumem in light of its decision to grant\n\nfees under the statute. On appeal, the respondents reprise this argument as an alternative\n\nbasis for affirming the fee award. The Walches contend that the argument cannot be\n\naddressed due to the failure of the respondents to cross appeal.\n\n       Only a party who has been aggrieved by a trial court action can appeal. RAP 3.1.\n\nThe respondents were not aggrieved; the trial court awarded attorney fees on the common\n\nlaw claims. They had no basis for seeking affirmative relief. Instead, they properly\n\nraised the issue as an alternative basis for affirming the trial court. Wolstein v. Yorkshire\n\nIns. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

Since we have reversed the fee award under the statute for the common\n\nlaw claims, we remand this issue to the trial court for consideration of the respondents'\n\nCR 11 argument related to those claims.\n\n       Attorney Fees on Appeal. Finally, all parties seek attorney fees on appeal. The\n\nWalches seek fees for responding to the CR 11 argument. However, as that argument\n\n\n\n\n                                              12 \n\n\fNo.30129-0-III\nWalch v. Clark\n\n\nwas properly brought to this court, the Walches have not prevailed on that issue and there\n\nis no basis for awarding fees to them.\n\n       Respondents seek their attorney fees based on either RCW 8.24.030 or for\n\nresponding to a frivolous appeal. This appeal was not frivolous. The Walches presented\n\na debatable issue concerning the necessity of their private condemnation action. The\n\nstatute does provide a basis for awarding fees to the respondents. However, at this point\n\nthey have not substantially prevailed. While they have won on the merits of the private\n\ncondemnation action, their attorney fee award has been reduced, at least temporarily.\n\n       If, on remand, respondents prevail on their CR 11 argument and regain their fees\n\nfor the common law claims, the trial court also should award respondents their reasonable\n\nattorney fees for defending the appeal in this court. If they do not prevail on the CR 11\n\nclaim, then no party will receive any fees for the appeal.\n\n       Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13 \n\n\fNo. 30129-0-111\nWalch v.
