However, Section 5 of Article 2700, supra, clearly\nstates that the repealing clause is not applicable to~ang laws\nwhich provide for a part of the office expense to be paid out\nof the general revenue of the county.\n          There are many statutes, too numerous to serve any\nuseful purpose In quoting here, or referring to specifically\nhere, of very narrow population brackets, and of varied popula-\ntion brackets, dealing with and purportedly authorizing the\nCommissioners' CouPts to expend county funds from the general\nrevenue to assist in paying the expenses of county superinten-\ndents. Undoubtedly a very large portion of same are unconstl~-\ntutlonal as being local or special laws in violation of Article\nIII, Section 56 of our State Constitution. The amounts allow;,\nable range from $200.00, $300.00, $600.00, $900.00 to $1~;200.00\nper annum. When viewed as a whole there seems to be no real\nand substantial basis for the varlous~classifications made.\n(~Withone exception, towit, Art. 2700a referred to in 3 infra.)\nFor example, we will point out a few examples:\n              Art. 27OOd-28 V.A.T.C.S    applicable to,countles\nwithinpop~iation brackets ig7 000 to iG8 000 ana 32 400 to\n32,800; amount payable by Commissioners’ Court to Co&ty~Super-\nlntendent out of the general fund for expenses not to exceed\n$300.00 per annum.\n          2~. Art. 2700b, V.A.T.C.S., applicable to counties of\nnot less than 60,000 and not more than 73,000; amount payalbe\nby Commissioners' Court to County Superintendent out of the gen-\neral fund for expenses not to exceed $600.00 per annum.\n\n          3. Art. 2700a, V.A.T.C.S., applicable to counties of\nmore than 210,000; amount payable by Commissioners' Court to\nCounty Superintendents out of the general fund for traveling ex-\npenses not to exceed $900.00 per annum. (This article is pro-\nbably constitutional).\n          4. Art. 2700a, V.A.T.C.S., the article under consla-\neration here, which allows the top amount of not to exceed\n$1200.00 per annum for such expenses.\n          There is no allowance whatever for county superinten-\ndent's expenses to be paid from the county general revenue fund\nfor counties between the brackets of 150,000 (the top bracket of\n\fHon. T. M. Trimble - Page 7       O-6542\n\n\n\nArt. 2700d) and the bracket of 210,000 (the bottom bracket of\nArt. 2700a, V.A.T.C.S.) with the lone exception of the bracket\nIn Art. 2700d, V.A.T.C.S. (1 7,000 to 198,000 which allows a\nmaximm of $600.00 per annum7 .\n          Thus we see the resulting hodge podge of laws enacted\nupon the subject under discussion. Counties having larger popl-\nlation than 150,000 are clearly discriminated against.\n          The case of Bexar County v. Tynan, 97 S.W. (2d) 467\nholds, among other things:\n          \"1 .

Courts in determining whether a law is\n   public, general, special, or local will look to\n   its substance and practical operation rather than\n   to Its title, form, phraseology, since otherwise\n   prohibition of fundamental law against special leg-\n   islation would be nugatory.\n          \"6 . To justify placing of one county In very\n    limited and restricted classification by Legislature,\n\fHon. T. M. Trimble - page 8        O-6542\n\n\n    there must be.some reasonable relation between\n    situation of counties classified and purposes\n    and objects to be obtained, and classification\n    cannot be adopted arbitrarily on ground which\n    has no foundation in difference of situation or\n    circumstance of counties placed in different\n    classes.\n          \"7 . Act reducing salaries of officers in\n    counties of over 290,000 and less than 310,000\n    population held unreasonable and arbitrary In its\n    classificationand void as a 'special law', where\n    it applied only to Bexar county, and where maxl-\n    mm compensation for county officers was reduced\n    below that in counties of 37,500 and to less than\n    half compensation allowed in other counties of\n    more than 150,000 (Vernon's Ann.

Substantial differences in population\n    of county can be made basis of leglslatlon fixing\n    compensation of county officers on theory that\n    work devolving on office    is in some degree pro-\n    portionate to population of county.\n          \"9 .

However, Section 5 of Article 2700, supra, clearly\nstates that the repealing clause is not applicable to~ang laws\nwhich provide for a part of the office expense to be paid out\nof the general revenue of the county.\n          There are many statutes, too numerous to serve any\nuseful purpose In quoting here, or referring to specifically\nhere, of very narrow population brackets, and of varied popula-\ntion brackets, dealing with and purportedly authorizing the\nCommissioners' CouPts to expend county funds from the general\nrevenue to assist in paying the expenses of county superinten-\ndents. Undoubtedly a very large portion of same are unconstl~-\ntutlonal as being local or special laws in violation of Article\nIII, Section 56 of our State Constitution. The amounts allow;,\nable range from $200.00, $300.00, $600.00, $900.00 to $1~;200.00\nper annum. When viewed as a whole there seems to be no real\nand substantial basis for the varlous~classifications made.\n(~Withone exception, towit, Art. 2700a referred to in 3 infra.)\nFor example, we will point out a few examples:\n              Art. 27OOd-28 V.A.T.C.S    applicable to,countles\nwithinpop~iation brackets ig7 000 to iG8 000 ana 32 400 to\n32,800; amount payable by Commissioners’ Court to Co&ty~Super-\nlntendent out of the general fund for expenses not to exceed\n$300.00 per annum.\n          2~. Art. 2700b, V.A.T.C.S., applicable to counties of\nnot less than 60,000 and not more than 73,000; amount payalbe\nby Commissioners' Court to County Superintendent out of the gen-\neral fund for expenses not to exceed $600.00 per annum.\n\n          3. Art. 2700a, V.A.T.C.S., applicable to counties of\nmore than 210,000; amount payable by Commissioners' Court to\nCounty Superintendents out of the general fund for traveling ex-\npenses not to exceed $900.00 per annum. (This article is pro-\nbably constitutional).\n          4. Art. 2700a, V.A.T.C.S., the article under consla-\neration here, which allows the top amount of not to exceed\n$1200.00 per annum for such expenses.\n          There is no allowance whatever for county superinten-\ndent's expenses to be paid from the county general revenue fund\nfor counties between the brackets of 150,000 (the top bracket of\n\fHon. T. M. Trimble - Page 7       O-6542\n\n\n\nArt. 2700d) and the bracket of 210,000 (the bottom bracket of\nArt. 2700a, V.A.T.C.S.) with the lone exception of the bracket\nIn Art. 2700d, V.A.T.C.S. (1 7,000 to 198,000 which allows a\nmaximm of $600.00 per annum7 .\n          Thus we see the resulting hodge podge of laws enacted\nupon the subject under discussion. Counties having larger popl-\nlation than 150,000 are clearly discriminated against.\n          The case of Bexar County v. Tynan, 97 S.W. (2d) 467\nholds, among other things:\n          \"1 .

Courts in determining whether a law is\n   public, general, special, or local will look to\n   its substance and practical operation rather than\n   to Its title, form, phraseology, since otherwise\n   prohibition of fundamental law against special leg-\n   islation would be nugatory.\n          \"6 . To justify placing of one county In very\n    limited and restricted classification by Legislature,\n\fHon. T. M. Trimble - page 8        O-6542\n\n\n    there must be.some reasonable relation between\n    situation of counties classified and purposes\n    and objects to be obtained, and classification\n    cannot be adopted arbitrarily on ground which\n    has no foundation in difference of situation or\n    circumstance of counties placed in different\n    classes.\n          \"7 . Act reducing salaries of officers in\n    counties of over 290,000 and less than 310,000\n    population held unreasonable and arbitrary In its\n    classificationand void as a 'special law', where\n    it applied only to Bexar county, and where maxl-\n    mm compensation for county officers was reduced\n    below that in counties of 37,500 and to less than\n    half compensation allowed in other counties of\n    more than 150,000 (Vernon's Ann.

Substantial differences in population\n    of county can be made basis of leglslatlon fixing\n    compensation of county officers on theory that\n    work devolving on office    is in some degree pro-\n    portionate to population of county.\n          \"9 . Where Legislature Ignores obvious facts\n    that work of county officers is proportionate to\n    population and classifies counties In such way\n    that compensation of officers of counties having\n    large population is fixed far below compensation\n    allowed like officers In small counties, classifl-\n    cation is arbitrary and has no true relevancy to\n    purpose of legislation.\"\n          We quote from the case of Miller v.

It is intended to pre-\n   vent the granting of special privileges and to\n   secure uniformity of law throughout the State as\n   far as possible. It is said that at an early\n   period in many of the states the practice of\n   enacting special and local laws became 'an effi-\n   cient means for the easy enactment of laws for\n   the advancement of personal rather than public in-\n   terests, and encouraged the reprehensible practice\n   of trading and 'logrolling'. It was for the sup-\n   pression of such practices that such a provision\n   was adopted in this and many of the other states\n   of the Union.\n         \"Notwithstanding the above constitutional\n   provision, the courts recognize in the Legis,la-\n   ture a rather broad power to make classifications\n   for legislative purposes and to enact laws for\n   the regulation thereof, even though such leglsla-\n   tlon ma be ap licable on1 to a particular class\n   or, in Y act, af feet only tK e Inhabitants of a\n   particular locality; but such legislation xmst\n   be intended to apply uniformly to all who may\n   come within the classification designated in the\n   Act, and the classification must be broad enough to\n   include a substantial class and mst be based on\n   characteristics legitimately distinguishing such\n   class from others with respect to the public pur-\n   pose sought to be accomplished by the proposed\n   legislation. In other words, there must be a\n   substantial reason for the classification. It\n   must not be a mere arbitrary device res,orted,to\n   for the purpose of giving what Is, In fact, a\n   local law the appearanc'eof a general law. city\n   of Fort Worth v.
