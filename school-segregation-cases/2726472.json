Moe appeals the trial court's order denying her motion\r\nto modify, maintaining both parents as joint managing conservators with Malmquist having the right\r\nto determine the children's primary residence, and putting restrictions and conditions upon Moe's\r\nrights of possession and access.  Moe's parents, Harold and Irene Moe,<sup> (2)</sup> intervened below, seeking\r\nto be appointed as conservators of the children, and now join Moe as appellants to challenge the\r\nattorney's fees awarded against themselves and Moe, jointly and severally, in favor of Malmquist's\r\nattorney and the children's attorney ad litem.  We will affirm the June 2004 order, but reverse an\r\naward of appellate attorney's fees that was contained in a subsequent, void order.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><center>PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</center></strong>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSince the final divorce decree was entered in July 1994, both parents have filed\r\nmultiple motions to modify conservatorship and both have been held in contempt on multiple\r\noccasions for violating court orders pertaining to their parental actions.  Also, both parents have\r\nconsistently disputed their financial responsibility for child support, the children's medical expenses,\r\nand the unpaid fees owed to their personal attorneys, the attorney ad litem, and the children's\r\ntherapist.  The trial court recognized that both parents--but particularly Moe--have overlooked the\r\ndamage this litigation has inflicted on their children and have, in fact, involved L.M.M. and S.D.M\r\nin the cross-fire.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe phase of litigation at issue began with an April 2003 motion that Moe filed to\r\nreduce her child support obligation and collect her attorney's fees.  She later filed several amended\r\nmotions to additionally request that the trial court hold Malmquist in contempt, award her additional\r\nperiods of possession, award her the right to determine S.D.M.'s primary residence, and appoint her\r\nas the children's sole managing conservator.<sup> (3)</sup>  The attorney ad litem intervened seeking to enforce\r\nthe prior orders, hold the parents in contempt for their violations, enjoin them from further\r\nviolations, and impose additional orders upon them.  Malmquist responded, denying Moe's\r\nallegations, seeking attorney's fees, and asking the court to deny Moe's requests.  Harold and Irene\r\nMoe, the grandparents, then filed a plea in intervention seeking that they be named sole managing\r\nconservators or joint managing conservators and that they recover their attorney's fees.  Malmquist\r\nand the ad litem filed additional motions to collect their attorney's fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter a four-day hearing in October 2003 and a three-day review hearing in March\r\n2004,<sup> (4)</sup> the trial court announced its proposed order, and the parties reconvened in April and May to\r\nfurther discuss the details of what should be included in that order.  The court then signed a final\r\norder on June 28, 2004, which maintained Moe and Malmquist as joint managing conservators with\r\nMalmquist having the right to establish the children's primary residence, but placed additional\r\nrestrictions on Moe's rights of possession and access, and conditioned her rights on continued\r\npsychological treatment.  The June 2004 order also awarded attorney's fees against Moe and the\r\ngrandparents, jointly and severally, in favor of the ad litem (for $15,000) and Malmquist's attorney\r\n(for $20,000, without mention of any fees that might be incurred on appeal) and awarded attorney's\r\nfees against Malmquist in favor of the ad litem (for $5,000).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn July 2004, Moe filed a motion for reconsideration and/or for a new trial, and\r\nMalmquist filed a motion to reform the judgment to include an award of appellate attorney's fees. \r\nAt a hearing on July 23, 2004, the trial court denied Moe's requests and stated that it would enter an\r\naward of $5,000 in favor of Malmquist's attorney against Harold and Irene in the event that they filed\r\nan unsuccessful appeal.  Although the court requested at that time for Malmquist's attorney to\r\nprepare an order reflecting that award, no such order appears in the record.  The award of appellate\r\nfees was not memorialized in writing until October 18, 2004, when the trial court issued a modified\r\nfinal order, which differed from the June order only by its inclusion of the appellate attorney's fees\r\naward.  The parties agree on appeal that the October 2004 order is void because it was issued after\r\nthe expiration of the court's plenary power and that the June 2004 order controls.  In November\r\n2004, the trial court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law in response to requests by Moe\r\nand the grandparents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoe appeals, challenging the trial court's order regarding conservatorship issues and\r\nattorney's fees.  Harold and Irene also appeal, confining their challenge to the award of attorney's\r\nfees.  Malmquist responds that the trial court committed no abuse of discretion regarding either the\r\nconservatorship issues or the attorney's fees and asks this Court to uphold the June 2004 order in all\r\nrespects.  Malmquist also urges that, although the October 2004 order is void, the award of appellate\r\nattorney's fees should be upheld as a temporary order pursuant to section 109.001 of the family code. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 109.001 (West 2002).  The ad litem asserts that the award of ad litem\r\nfees against Moe and the grandparents, jointly and severally, should be upheld.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong></strong></span><span><strong>CONSERVATORSHIP ISSUES</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough the June 2004 order maintained Moe and Malmquist as joint managing\r\nconservators with Malmquist having the exclusive right to determine the children's primary\r\nresidence, as the case had been since August 2002, it modified Moe's possession and access rights\r\nby adding restrictions and conditions to the terms.  Whereas the August 2002 order employed the\r\nfamily code's \"standard possession order,\" as set forth in sections 153.311 through 153.317, the June\r\n2004 order stated that \"the provisions of the Standard Possession Order are not appropriate in this\r\ncase and . . . would not be in the children's best interest.\"  <em>See</em> Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §§ 153.311-.317\r\n(West 2002 &amp; Supp. 2004-05).  Instead, the court crafted an order that conditioned Moe's rights of\r\npossession and access on her attending therapy with Dr. Thomas Lowry.  The court ordered that,\r\nthirty days after Moe had \"begun a regular course of psychological treatment with Dr. Thomas Lowry\r\nand [] provided proof thereof [to all parties],\" she could engage in supervised visitation at Kids\r\nExchange from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month and, once\r\nnotice of her treatment with Dr. Lowry had been provided, she could have telephone contact with\r\nthe children.  The court also provided for the possibility of increased possession by Moe if certain\r\nconditions were met.  It ordered that, if Moe continued her treatment with Dr. Lowry, then as of\r\nAugust 1, 2004, she could have the children on the second and fourth Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to\r\n10:00 p.m., and as of September 1, 2004, from Saturday at 9:00 a.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m.  These\r\nperiods of possession were to be supervised by Harold Moe until September 15, 2004, and thereafter\r\ncould be unsupervised.  Then, on December 1, 2004, assuming Moe continued treatment with Dr.\r\nLowry, the terms of the family code's standard possession order would supersede the June 2004\r\norder, providing Moe with additional conservatorship rights.<sup> (5)</sup>  All possibilities of Moe's increased\r\npossession were, however, subject to her compliance with the order that she continue treatment with\r\nDr. Lowry.  And the court ordered that Dr. Lowry should consult the children's therapist to\r\n\"determine the impact of the increased possession,\" and \"[i]f Dr. Thomas Lowry <strong>and</strong> the children's\r\ncounselor agree that any specific period of possession is not in the best interest of the child or\r\nchildren, and have stated so in writing, that period of possession is ordered [to] not occur.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoe challenges the conservatorship order on two basic grounds: she urges that the\r\ntrial court abused its discretion in awarding certain privileges to Malmquist and in imposing certain\r\nlimitations on her.  More specifically, Moe asserts that the trial court abused its discretion and\r\nviolated the family code by (1) maintaining Malmquist as joint managing conservator with the right\r\nto determine the children's primary residence because Malmquist has a history of abusing the\r\nchildren, making it impermissible for him to be the joint managing conservator under section\r\n153.004(b) of the family code, and by (2) granting Moe less than the standard possession order, as\r\ndefined by section 153.311 of the family code; by not awarding Moe specific, enforceable periods\r\nof possession and access; and by making Moe's visitation rights dependent on the approval of her\r\nand the children's therapists, which poses the risk that her parental rights could be unconstitutionally\r\ndenied by <em>de facto </em>termination and which constitutes an impermissible delegation of the trial court's\r\nauthority to determine conservatorship rights.  <em>See id</em>. § 153.004(b) (West Supp. 2004-05), § 153.311\r\n(West 2002).<strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>Standard of Review</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn determining issues of conservatorship and possession and access, the primary\r\nconsideration is always the best interest of the child.  <em>See</em> <em>id</em>. § 153.002 (West 2002); <em>Lenz v. Lenz</em>,\r\n79 S.W.3d 10, 14 (Tex. 2002).  Trial courts have broad discretion to determine what is in a child's\r\nbest interest.  <em>Coleman v. Coleman</em>, 109 S.W.3d 108, 110 (Tex. App.--Austin 2003, no pet.).  A trial\r\ncourt's order modifying a joint managing conservatorship will not be disturbed on appeal unless a\r\nclear abuse of discretion is established by the complaining party.  <em>Echols v. Olivarez</em>, 85 S.W.3d 475,\r\n477 (Tex. App.--Austin 2002, no pet.).  This is because conservatorship determinations are\r\n\"intensely fact driven,\" <em>Lenz</em>, 79 S.W.3d at 19, and the trial court is in the best position to observe\r\nthe witnesses and \"can 'feel' the forces, powers, and influences that cannot be discerned by merely\r\nreading the record.\"  <em>Echols</em>, 85 S.W.3d at 477.  To demonstrate an abuse of discretion, therefore,\r\nthe appellant must show that the trial court acted in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner, or without\r\nreference to guiding principles of law.  <em>Coleman</em>, 109 S.W.3d at 110.  As long as some evidence of\r\na substantive and probative character exists to support the order, we will not substitute our judgment\r\nfor that of the trial court.  <em>Echols</em>, 85 S.W.3d at 477.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong></strong></span><span><strong>Evidence Before the Trial Court</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tOver the course of several hearings in October 2003 and March 2004, the trial court\r\nheard testimony from over two dozen witnesses, including many mental health and educational\r\nprofessionals, and conducted in camera interviews with L.M.M. and S.D.M. concerning Moe's and\r\nMalmquist's behaviors and the family's general situation.  The overall theme that developed through\r\nthis wealth of evidence was as follows: Moe and Malmquist have had a highly contentious\r\nrelationship since 1994, and the children have suffered, academically and emotionally, as a result. \r\nAs stated by the children's therapist, the family has been in \"perpetual crisis mode\" for several years,\r\nand as described by Moe's sister, \"[Moe and Malmquist] don't speak to each other, but they fight\r\neach other through the kids.\"  Although various courts have repeatedly ordered the parents to not\r\ndisparage the other in front of the children, to not involve the children in the custody and child\r\nsupport disputes, and to maintain a consistent regimen of counseling for both themselves and the\r\nchildren, both parents have failed to comply with these orders and have been held in contempt for\r\ntheir failures.  Several witnesses described Moe as having psychological disorders, exhibiting intense\r\nand uncontrollable anger, obsessing over things she believes Malmquist has done wrong, and\r\nconsistently using the children as weapons against Malmquist.  Despite this, evidence was presented\r\nthat S.D.M. is protective of his mother and feels bonded to her, and that Moe loves her children. \r\nRegarding Malmquist, witnesses repeatedly testified that he has an authoritarian attitude, uses\r\nphysical discipline, relies on calling the sheriff's department to resolve his disagreements with the\r\nchildren, and is unable or unwilling to communicate with the children.  On the other hand, several\r\nwitnesses described Malmquist as being very involved at the children's school, being attentive to and\r\nconcerned about their needs and successes, using appropriate methods of discipline, and doing the\r\nbest he can in the difficult situations that Moe creates between him and the children.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition to general testimony about the parents' characteristics and the family's\r\nsituation, the trial court also heard testimony about several specific episodes.  This evidence is\r\nsignificant because the trial court made several comments on the record that these episodes\r\ninfluenced its determinations about what conservatorship arrangement was in the best interest of the\r\nchildren.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMichelle Heckroth, a school counselor, testified about an incident that occurred\r\nbetween Moe and L.M.M. on May 19, 2003.  Heckroth testified that Moe was \"loud and upset\" and\r\n\"caused a scene\" in front of the middle school, apparently in response to L.M.M. having \"flipped her\r\nthe bird.\"  Moe screamed at L.M.M. that she was \"white trash\" and, despite Heckroth's efforts to\r\ncalm Moe down, her level of intensity did not subside.  Another school counselor, Andrew Karbo,\r\nwho also witnessed the scene, heard Moe call L.M.M. a \"bitch\" and saw that Moe was \"out of\r\ncontrol.\"  Heckroth testified that Moe blamed Malmquist for the occurrence and, when Heckroth\r\nattempted to counsel her about this incident, Moe only wanted to talk about Malmquist's\r\nshortcomings and continued to belittle him in front of the children.  At the end of the encounter, Moe\r\nsaid to Heckroth, \"it's not over.  She'll pay for this.\"  Heckroth testified that Moe and L.M.M.'s\r\nrelationship consisted of \"a lot of hate, a lot of anger\" and that, in twenty-one years of education, she\r\nhad \"never seen a mother degrade her child like that.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSeveral witnesses testified about an episode in September 2003, when Moe equipped\r\nS.D.M. with a tape recorder and instructed him to take it to Malmquist's house, conceal it in a\r\nbackpack, provoke a fight with Malmquist, and record Malmquist's reaction.  Moe's instructions to\r\nS.D.M., which she gave when they were practicing using the device, were caught on tape.  She\r\nadmitted that it was her voice on the tape telling S.D.M. that, \"when you get to court . . . you need\r\nto tell . . . all the stuff we do\" and \"[y]ou need to tell what you hate about living with [Malmquist].\r\n. . .  [H]e just sits around and f--ing drinks. . . .  We'll kick his ass in court if you just listen to me\r\nand just do what I say.\"  She acknowledged that this was a \"direct violation of the August 2002\r\norder,\" but claimed she only did it to have evidence for the sheriff's department and that she \"didn't\r\nthink about . . . it endangering [S.D.M.].\"  The trial court commented that he believed Moe's actions\r\nwith the tape recorder were \"evil, and I think my opinion's important on that issue.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEvidence was also presented to the trial court that Moe instructed the children to write\r\nletters about Malmquist's shortcomings and about their alleged preference to live with Moe.  A\r\ncounselor with Mothers Against Drunk Driving testified that, when Moe contacted her with concerns\r\nabout Malmquist drinking and driving, she advised Moe to have the children write letters expressing\r\ntheir feelings, but did not intend for Moe to \"coach\" or \"prompt\" them about what to write.  Moe\r\nadmitted that she instructed the children to write the letters and that she knew it was in violation of\r\nthe August 2002 order.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRegarding Malmquist's behavior, the trial court heard testimony about various\r\nincidents where Malmquist called the sheriff's department to resolve disputes with his children.  The\r\ntwo most prominent of these incidents involved S.D.M.  In the first, Malmquist noticed that a child\r\nsupport check, written to him from Moe's employer, was missing from his desk.  S.D.M. denied\r\nhaving taken it.  Two months later, Malmquist took S.D.M. to the police station about the missing\r\ncheck, and S.D.M. admitted to having taken it.  Malmquist claimed he wanted to teach S.D.M. that,\r\n\"if he did this later in life, [the consequences] would be a lot worse.\"  The officer who handled the\r\nmissing check incident testified that it is not unusual for parents to bring their children in to be talked\r\nto about bad behaviors and that, on average, he talks to children \"two or three times a month\" about\r\nsuch matters.  The children's therapist, however, testified that the use of such a disciplinary tactic\r\nwas intimidating to S.D.M., made him fearful, and decreased his respect for authority figures.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe second incident involving the sheriff's department occurred in September 2003,\r\nin connection with Moe's equipping S.D.M. with the hidden tape recorder.  By all accounts,<sup> (6)</sup> one\r\nmorning before school, S.D.M. hid the tape recorder in his backpack, and Malmquist told him to take\r\nout the trash.  S.D.M. refused, and Malmquist attempted to hurry up their morning routine by loading\r\nS.D.M.'s backpack into the truck while again telling S.D.M. to take out the trash.  When S.D.M.\r\nbecame very possessive of his bag, Malmquist looked inside and found the tape recorder.  Malmquist\r\ntook it and the bag, gave S.D.M. his lunch and books, told S.D.M. to wait outside for the bus, and\r\nlocked the door.  S.D.M. yelled and banged on the door, but Malmquist refused to let him back in. \r\nS.D.M. then threw something at the door and broke the window.  Malmquist told him to stay put and\r\ncalled the sheriff's department.  The officers arrived, handcuffed S.D.M., put him in the squad car,\r\nand took him to the downtown station.  Malmquist followed.  After leaving the station, Malmquist\r\ntook S.D.M. for an emergency session with the children's therapist, and then took him to school. \r\nSchool personnel testified that S.D.M. was upset and scared to go back to Malmquist's.  Malmquist\r\ntestified that, because S.D.M. was out of control, he believed it was appropriate to get the sheriff's\r\noffice involved.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, the issue of Malmquist's alleged drinking-and-driving was also the subject\r\nof testimony, in response to Moe's repeated accusations that Malmquist drives drunk with the\r\nchildren.  Malmquist acknowledged that he was pulled over on Halloween night, 2001, for driving\r\n48 mph in a 45 mph zone.  According to Malmquist, he was detained because another man of the\r\nsame name had an outstanding warrant.  Because the police intended to take him to the station to\r\nclear it up, Malmquist's sister came to retrieve the children.  Malmquist denied that the reason for\r\nhis sister coming was because he and his girlfriend were too inebriated to drive.  No DWI charges\r\nwere filed.  Although Malmquist admits to often having a mixed drink in the evenings when the\r\nchildren are present, he claims that he does not drink to the point of intoxication and that he never\r\ndrives intoxicated.  Multiple witnesses confirmed that they have never known Malmquist to drink\r\nand drive, that it would be inconsistent with his character to do so, and that he drinks responsibly in\r\nsocial settings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court also heard testimony from key witnesses about their recommendations\r\nfor a custody arrangement.<sup> (7)</sup>  In October 2003, the children's therapist, Tammy Wanamaker, testified\r\nthat it was not in the children's best interest to continue the joint conservatorship ordered in August\r\n2002 and that, thus far, they had not been able to achieve a healthy situation when both parents were\r\ninvolved.  But, she testified, both children have expressed a desire to have a relationship with both\r\nparents, and her general philosophy is to try and keep children \"in the home setting and try to\r\npromote the relationship with both parents.\"  Wanamaker felt that \"intensive\" therapy work with\r\nboth Moe and Malmquist was necessary.  Ultimately, Wanamaker testified that she \"would like to\r\nsee the children continue to have contact with their parents.  I think that supervised visitation may\r\nbe helpful for awhile, but I would like to, eventually, see them be able to have nonsupervised time\r\nwith both parents.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMalmquist testified that \"I'm not a perfect parent, but I try the best I can, and I\r\nhaven't made a hundred percent of the right choices, no one does . . . but I'm not here to condemn\r\nmyself.  I think I've done a great job raising these kids. . . .  I got them tutors. . . .  [When L.M.M.\r\nhid her progress report], I went and got it. . . .  [I] take them to school early in the mornings for\r\n[S.D.M.'s] football practice and after I drop them off, go to work.  And, normally, I don't get home,\r\nmostly between 5:30 and 6:00, and in the meantime, they're with [my girlfriend] doing their studies\r\nor playing or fishing or football practice. . . .  I don't want to eliminate [Moe].  I believe there needs\r\nto be supervised visitation of some sort, and that happened before, and it worked out well.\" \r\nMalmquist's sister testified that he should have custody.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoe acknowledged that she had contributed to the children's emotional and academic\r\nproblems, but testified that S.D.M. wanted to live with her.  She stated that, if she could not have\r\ncustody of the children, her preference would be that they live with her parents.  Two of Moe's\r\nsisters, Moe's adult daughter from a previous marriage, and three of Harold and Irene's friends\r\ntestified that they thought conservatorship should be awarded to the grandparents.<sup> (8)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the March review hearing, several witnesses testified that Malmquist had made\r\nimprovements.  Dr. Elizabeth Holtzman, Malmquist's psychologist, testified that Malmquist was\r\ncommitted to the therapeutic process, understood the need to change his authoritarian style, and\r\ndemonstrated to her that he could provide a stable environment for the children.  Scott Matthew, an\r\nassistant director for Williamson County Juvenile Services, testified that S.D.M. needed more\r\ndiscipline than Harold and Irene were providing and that, given his experience, it is better to not\r\nplace children with the grandparents when there is a viable parental option.  Nancy Graff, one of\r\nS.D.M.'s teachers, testified that Malmquist had been supportive of her efforts to improve S.D.M.'s\r\nacademic performance.  Malmquist testified that he had been attending counseling and parenting\r\nclasses and reading parenting books; he felt these things were helping him to be a better father. \r\nWanamaker testified that, since October, Malmquist had improved his ability to communicate with\r\nthe children and had not physically disciplined S.D.M., although their relationship was still \"rocky.\" \r\nWanamaker could not say whether it would be better to leave S.D.M. with Harold and Irene or move\r\nhim to Malmquist's; she did not feel it would benefit L.M.M. to be moved from her grandparents';\r\nand she felt the children should not be separated.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the hearing, Moe declined to offer any direct testimony.  And other witnesses had\r\nlittle to say about Moe because her involvement with the children since October had been minimal,\r\ngiven the time she spent in jail serving her contempt sentence and that, once released, she failed to\r\nbegin counseling with Dr. Lowry in order to see the children.  Moe testified on cross-examination\r\nthat she had attended one session with Dr. Lowry, but she had not scheduled another.<sup> (9)</sup>  Irene Moe\r\nand Moe's sister testified that they did not believe Moe posed a danger to the children, that her\r\nvisitation did not need to be supervised, and that the court's orders were primarily for the purpose\r\nof punishing Moe rather than protecting the children.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEvidence was also presented at the March hearing that, during the five months the\r\nchildren were residing at their grandparents' house, L.M.M.'s behavior and academic performance\r\nimproved, although she continued to struggle with grades and made poor choices for friends.  On\r\nthe other hand, S.D.M.'s attitude and grades declined drastically.  Although the grandparents claimed\r\nthat he behaved well at home, his teachers reported that he had anger management problems, was\r\nfailing, was in frequent violation of the dress code, and that he told them he could get away with\r\nanything because his grandparents would not discipline him.<strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>Analysis</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA joint managing conservatorship may be modified only upon establishing that (1)\r\nthere has been a material and substantial change of circumstances and (2) the modification would\r\nbe in the best interest of the child.  <em>See</em> Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 156.101 (West 2002 &amp; Supp. 2004-05).  Here, Moe does not dispute that material and substantial changes to the family's circumstances\r\nhad occurred since the August 2002 order, but she argues that the trial court's June 2004 order did\r\nnot modify the conservatorship arrangement in a manner that was in the best interests of L.M.M. and\r\nS.D.M.  She sought to modify the August order to have Malmquist removed as a joint managing\r\nconservator and herself appointed as sole managing conservator.  Malmquist responds that, when\r\nconsidering all of the evidence before it, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Moe's\r\nmotion to modify and maintaining the parents as joint managing conservators with Malmquist having\r\nthe right to establish primary residence, while placing additional restrictions on Moe's possession\r\nand access rights.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\tMalmquist's rights of possession and access</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tMoe bases her argument against Malmquist's conservatorship on the presumptions\r\nestablished in Chapter 153 of the family code.  She argues that, while section 153.131 sets forth a\r\npresumption in favor of both parents being named as joint conservators, that was rebutted in this case\r\nby evidence that Malmquist abuses the children.  <em>See id</em>. § 153.004, .131.  Moe's arguments are,\r\nhowever, without merit in this modification proceeding because the Texas Supreme Court has\r\nunequivocally stated that the presumptions of Chapter 153 do not apply to Chapter 156 modification\r\nactions.  <em>In re V.L.K.</em>, 24 S.W.3d 338, 343 (Tex. 2002) (presumptions in Chapter 153 only govern\r\noriginal custody determinations).  Accordingly, in regards to Moe's first issue, the only question\r\npresented for our review is whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying Moe's motion to\r\nmodify.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause Moe was the party asserting that Malmquist should not be maintained as\r\njoint conservator with the right to establish the children's primary residence and that the arrangement\r\nshould be modified, Moe carried the burden of proof to establish by a preponderance of evidence that\r\nit would be injurious to the children to maintain Malmquist and that her appointment would be a\r\npositive improvement.  <em>Eason v. Eason</em>, 860 S.W.2d 187, 190 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.]\r\n1993, no writ);<em> Ogrydziak v. Ogrydziak</em>, 614 S.W.2d 474, 477 (Tex. Civ. App.--El Paso 1981, no\r\nwrit).  She failed to satisfy this burden.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough several witnesses testified that Malmquist physically disciplined the\r\nchildren, such as slapping L.M.M. across the face or wrestling S.D.M. to the ground, none\r\ncharacterized this behavior as \"abuse.\"  The children's therapist testified that she did not believe\r\nMalmquist was physically abusing the children but she did worry that the exchanges between\r\nMalmquist and his son would become \"[m]ore physical, maybe more intense,\" as S.D.M. got larger\r\nand older.  The therapist also acknowledged that Moe had reported Malmquist to Child Protective\r\nServices on multiple occasions, and that each case was resolved in Malmquist's favor.  Further,\r\nMoe's allegations that Malmquist abused the children by drinking and driving were not corroborated\r\nby the testimony, and multiple witnesses testified that they had observed Malmquist with the\r\nchildren and believed they had a good relationship.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen the trial court announced its order in October 2003, he admonished Malmquist\r\nfor his method of handling disputes by resorting to either physical discipline or the sheriff's\r\ndepartment.  He then said to Moe that </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>[t]he mental, cruel and harmful abuse that you have inflicted over these children is\r\nmuch more severe and much more life damaging than a slap in the face.  A kid will\r\nget over a slap in the face.  I don't know that these kids will get over the garbage you\r\nput them through, from [having] them sign the [court] documents and the letters . . .,\r\nfrom giving your child a tape recorder. . . .  [and] calling [L.M.M.] white trash and\r\na bitch in front of her friends and her schoolmates and her teachers is disgusting.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>At the March 2004 review hearing, the court explained that he could \"understand the conflict\r\nbetween [Malmquist's] authoritarian, discipline personality and the [grandparents' soft approach],\r\n. . . [but] that's not working for [S.D.M.]\" because S.D.M. needs some discipline, and\r\n\"[Malmquist's] gone to [Dr.] Holtzman, and he's done what I've told him to do.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe record demonstrates sufficient evidence to support the trial court's determinations\r\nthat it was in the best interest of the children to maintain Malmquist as the joint conservator with the\r\nright to establish the children's primary residence and deny Moe's motion to modify.  Moe failed to\r\nestablish by a preponderance of the evidence that it would be injurious to the children to maintain\r\nMalmquist in this position or that it would be an improvement to appoint Moe as the children's sole\r\nmanaging conservator.  <em>See Eason</em>, 860 S.W.2d at 190.  She also failed to show on appeal that the\r\ntrial court acted in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner, or without reference to guiding principals\r\nof law.  <em>See Coleman</em>, 109 S.W.3d at 110.  The trial court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion. \r\n<em>See Echols</em>, 85 S.W.3d at 477.  Moe's first issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em></em></span><span><em>\tMoe's rights of possession and access</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn her second, third, and fourth issues, Moe challenges the trial court's modification\r\nof her joint conservatorship rights to possession of and access to the children.  Moe asserts that it was\r\nerror for the trial court to award her less than the standard possession order; to not grant her specific,\r\nenforceable periods of possession and access; and to condition her rights upon the combined\r\napproval of Dr. Lowry and the children's therapist.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTrial courts have discretion to establish the terms and conditions of conservatorship. \r\n<em>Green v. Green</em>, 850 S.W.2d 809, 812 (Tex. App.--El Paso 1993, no writ); <em>see</em> Tex. Fam. Code Ann.\r\n§ 153.193 (West 2002).  This includes the authority to determine the frequency and duration of\r\nvisits, as well as the limitations and safeguards to be placed on such visits.  <em>Hill v. Hill</em>, 404 S.W.2d\r\n641, 642 (Tex. Civ. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1966, no writ).  Trial courts are not obligated to order\r\nstandard possession; if a court determines that the standard possession order is not in the child's best\r\ninterest, then the court can either deny possession and access altogether or \"fashion an order that\r\nrestricts possession or access so as to eliminate any danger to the physical or emotional welfare of\r\nthe child.\"  <em>In re Walters</em>, 39 S.W.3d 280, 286 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 2001, no pet.);<em> see also In\r\nre R.D.Y.</em>, 51 S.W.3d 314, 323 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, pet. denied).  Trial courts,\r\nhowever, cannot deny a conservator's rights of possession and access absent a finding that the child's\r\nphysical and emotional welfare would be endangered by the possession and access, and any\r\nlimitations placed on such rights cannot exceed that required to protect the child's best interest. \r\n<em>Roosth v. Roosth</em>, 889 S.W.3d 445, 451-52 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, writ denied). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIf a trial court determines that it is in the best interest of the child to place restrictions\r\nor conditions on a conservator's rights of possession and access, then it is the court's responsibility\r\nto specifically define those terms in its decree.  <em>In re A.P.S.,</em> 54 S.W.3d 493, 499 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Texarkana 2001, no pet.); <em>Hill</em>, 404 S.W.2d at 643.  The judgment must state in clear and\r\nunambiguous terms what is required for the conservator to comply, and the terms must be specific\r\nenough to allow the conservator to enforce the judgment by contempt.  <em>In re A.P.S.,</em> 54 S.W.3d  at\r\n498; <em>Roosth</em>, 889 S.W.2d at 452; <em>see also In re Walters</em>, 39 S.W.3d at 288.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs in her first issue, Moe relies on a Chapter 153 presumption to support her second\r\nissue, claiming that she is entitled to the standard possession order.  <em>See</em> Tex. Fam. Code Ann.\r\n§ 153.137 (West Supp. 2004-05) (standard possession order constitutes presumptive minimum\r\namount of possession for parent named as joint managing conservator who is not awarded right to\r\nestablish children's primary residence).  But the supreme court has held that the presumptions in\r\nChapter 153 are only applicable in original custody cases, not in modification proceedings such as\r\nthis one, which are governed by Chapter 156.  <em>In re V.L.K.</em>, 24 S.W.3d at 343.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court was afforded broad discretion in establishing the terms of\r\nconservatorship and it was not obligated to order standard possession.  <em>In re Walters</em>, 39 S.W.3d at\r\n286.  Moreover, the court explained on the record why the standard possession order was not initially\r\nappropriate in this case<sup> (10)</sup> and it structured the order so that, within six months from the date of the\r\norder, Moe would be entitled to standard possession, assuming she had established and continued\r\ntreatment with Dr. Lowry.  Thus, Moe's claim that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding\r\nher less than the standard possession order is without merit, and her second issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoe's only argument with regard to her third issue--that the trial court erred by not\r\ngiving her specific, enforceable periods of possession--is that \"[i]t has been repeatedly held that\r\ndenials of specific periods of visitation should only be ordered in the most extreme of\r\ncircumstances.\"  <em>See</em> <em>Roosth,</em> 889 S.W.2d at 451.  While we agree with this proposition, it does not\r\nsupport Moe's claim because, in conditioning Moe's rights on her continued therapy, she was not\r\ndenied specific, enforceable periods of possession.  To the contrary, the court's order sets forth very\r\nspecific terms of her possession and access rights.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe June 2004 order stated that Moe had to (1) begin treatment with Dr. Lowry, (2)\r\nnotify all the parties of such compliance, and (3) continue that treatment for thirty days.  At that\r\npoint, she was entitled to supervised visitation at Kids Exchange on specified dates and to telephone\r\ncontact with the children.  Thereafter, beginning in August 2004, as long as she continued treatment\r\nwith Dr. Lowry, Moe was entitled to increased periods of possession and access--with very specific\r\ntimes, dates, and locations provided for--culminating in a December 2004 return to standard\r\npossession.  Accordingly, the terms of what Moe was required to do in order to obtain and enhance\r\nher rights of possession and access were unambiguous, specific, and enforceable.  Moreover, the\r\nfamily code expressly grants trial courts authority to order that conservators \"participate in\r\ncounseling with a mental health professional.\"  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.010(a) (West 2002). \r\nThe trial court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion by conditioning Moe's rights on her continued\r\ntherapy with Dr. Lowry.  Her third issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, Moe challenges the conservatorship arrangement on the grounds that it\r\npermitted Dr. Lowry and the children's therapist to order that a particular period of possession not\r\noccur if the therapists mutually agreed that it would not be in the children's best interest and stated\r\nso in writing.  She asserts that this order poses the threat that the therapists could cause a <em>de facto\r\n</em>termination of her parental rights by agreeing that it would be in the children's best interest for Moe\r\nto be denied all periods of possession and access; she urges that giving them the ability to deny her\r\nall possession of and access to her children, without any court intervention, violates her\r\nconstitutional rights as a parent,<em> see In re M.S.</em>, 115 S.W.3d 534, 547 (Tex. 2003), and constitutes\r\nan impermissible delegation of the trial court's authority to make judicial determinations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe first address Moe's claim that the order empowered the therapists to prevent her\r\nfrom \"ever again see[ing] her own minor children.\"  In raising this issue, Moe overlooks the\r\nsignificant distinction between the terms \"possession\" and \"access.\"  Although the terms are\r\nsometimes used interchangeably, they represent two different concepts in the family code.  <em>In re\r\nWalters</em>, 39 S.W.3d at 284.  The right of access permits a conservator to approach, communicate,\r\nand visit with the child, whereas the right of possession allows the conservator to exercise control\r\nover the child to the exclusion of all others during a specified period.  <em>Id</em>.  Here, the order empowered\r\nthe therapists to deny Moe only a period of possession, not access.<sup> (11)</sup>  Moe holds the key to that\r\nability by attending her therapy sessions with Dr. Lowry: As long as Moe continues her treatment\r\nwith Dr. Lowry, then she is, at a minimum, permitted access to or visitation with her children.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn light of the evidence that Moe had caused mental and emotional damage to her\r\nchildren over the last decade, it was reasonable for the trial court to determine that limitations needed\r\nto be placed on her rights of possession.  Furthermore, the limitation it imposed sufficiently\r\nsafeguarded against a <em>de facto </em>termination of Moe's rights (1) by requiring that the therapists agree\r\nto deny a period of possession and that they state their agreement in writing, (2) by limiting their\r\nright to deny possession to one particular period at a time, and (3) by permitting them to deny Moe\r\npossession, not access.  Because the trial court placed restrictions only on Moe's rights of possession,\r\nrather than denying her all rights of possession and access, her constitutional rights are not\r\nimplicated by the June 2004 order.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe question remains, however, whether it was a proper exercise of the court's\r\ndiscretion to delegate authority over Moe's rights of possession to the therapists.  Although we are\r\naware of no other court that has addressed the issue of whether a conservator's right to possess a\r\nchild may be contingent on a mental therapist's approval, other courts have addressed whether it is\r\nappropriate to leave that determination within the discretion of another conservator.<sup> (12)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Hill</em>, the First Court of Appeals held that the trial court abused its discretion by\r\nmaking the father's right to visit his children contingent upon securing the written permission of their\r\nmother, the managing conservator.  404 S.W.2d at 643; <em>see also Wright v. Wentzel</em>, 749 S.W.2d 228,\r\n234 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1988, no writ) (trial court erred by making mother's visitation\r\nrights contingent on father's consent).  In <em>Roosth</em>, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals similarly reversed\r\nan order that gave the mother \"complete discretion to determine when, where, and if [the father] may\r\nhave possession of or access to the children,\" because this grant of \"absolute discretion\" to the\r\nmother denied the father an ability to enforce the judgment by contempt.  889 S.W.2d at 452.  The\r\nTexarkana Court of Appeals also reversed an order that conditioned the mother's possession rights\r\non the father's agreement because it was \"not sufficiently specific.\"  <em>In re Walters</em>, 39 S.W.3d at 288;\r\n<em>see also In re A.P.S.</em>, 54 S.W.3d at 498 (trial court abused discretion in ordering that mother was\r\nentitled to possession \"at reasonable times and places as determined by [father]\" because it gave\r\nfather complete discretion over mother's rights and denied mother ability to enforce order by\r\ncontempt).<sup> (13)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThese cases, however, are distinguishable from the instant one in two, significant\r\nrespects.  First, the conflict that results from allowing one conservator to have absolute discretion\r\nover the other conservator's rights is readily apparent because it gives an adverse party the right to\r\ncompletely deny possession and/or access to the other.  Here, that is not the case because the\r\ndecision-makers, the therapists, are presumably neutral third parties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSecond, the orders in the above-mentioned cases did not sufficiently specify the terms\r\nupon which the decision-maker could deny the conservator's possession or visitation rights.  Instead,\r\nthe orders simply stated that possession could not occur unless the conservator obtained the other's\r\n\"written permission,\" <em>Hill</em>, 404 S.W.2d at 643, \"consent,\" <em>Wright</em>, 749 S.W.2d at 234, or \"mutual\r\nagreement,\"<em> In re Walters</em>, 39 S.W.3d at 288.  Thus, in these cases, absolute, unconditional discretion\r\nwas granted over the conservator's rights of possession and access.  Here, on the other hand, the\r\ntherapists were not permitted to deny Moe a single period of possession without first reaching a\r\nmutual, written agreement that it was in the children's best interest to do so.  This is in accord with\r\nwhat the family code requires a trial court to find prior to denying conservatorship rights.   <em>See</em> Tex.\r\nFam. Code Ann. § 153.002.  While it may not be appropriate in all cases for the trial court to\r\ndelegate such authority to third parties, here the decision-makers were mental health professionals\r\nappointed by the court, and the trial court maintained the power to review their decisions if\r\nchallenged by the parties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe terms of this order are sufficiently specific so as to be enforceable by contempt,\r\nand the trial court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in granting the therapists the right to deny\r\nMoe a specific period of possession if they mutually agreed it was in the best interest of the children. \r\nMoe's fourth issue is overruled.<sup> (14)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>ATTORNEY'S FEES</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe final order issued in June 2004 awarded attorney's fees against Moe and the\r\ngrandparents, jointly and severally, in the following amounts: $15,000 for Laurie Nowlin, the\r\nattorney ad litem, and $20,000 for John Barrett, Malmquist's attorney.<sup> (15)</sup>  The June order was\r\nconfined to the attorneys' work during the trial phase and did not mention any appellate fees. \r\nMalmquist, therefore, filed a motion to reform the judgment on July 20, 2004, seeking an attorney's\r\nfee award of $20,000, should Moe and/or the grandparents appeal.  Moe responded with her own\r\nmotion for reconsideration, urging that the initial award of attorney's fees was unjust and that\r\nMalmquist's motion to add appellate fees should be denied because $20,000 was an unconscionable\r\namount.  At a hearing on July 23, 2004, the trial court denied Moe's motion, announced it would\r\naward Malmquist's attorney $5,000 in appellate fees, and asked that an order be prepared to reflect\r\nthat pronouncement.  The only written memorialization appearing in the record of the July\r\npronouncement, however, is a reformed final order issued on October 18, 2004,<sup> (16)</sup> which was after\r\nthe trial court's plenary power expired.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 306a, 329b (regarding timetables for\r\nplenary power).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn appeal, Moe and the grandparents challenge the awards assessed against them in\r\nfavor of both the ad litem and Malmquist's attorney, for both the trial and appellate phases.  They\r\nurge (1) that each of these awards constituted an abuse of the trial court's discretion, (2) that it\r\nviolated section 261.106 of the family code to assess Malmquist's attorney's fees against them, and\r\n(3) that the October 2004 award of appellate fees is void based on the expiration of the court's\r\nplenary power. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong></strong></span><span><strong>Abuse of Discretion</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tSection 106.002 of the family code governs the award of attorney's fees in suits\r\naffecting the parent-child relationship.  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 106.002 (West Supp. 2004-05).  In\r\nsuch cases, we review the award of attorney's fees for an abuse of discretion.  <em>Tull v. Tull</em>, 159\r\nS.W.3d 758, 760 (Tex. App.--Dallas 2005, no pet.).  There is no abuse of discretion where an award\r\nof attorney's fees is supported by the evidence.  <em>Id</em>. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoe's only argument in support of her claim that the trial court abused its discretion\r\nby awarding attorney's fees against her<sup> (17)</sup> is that her allegations that Malmquist \"batter[ed] the\r\nchildren and [her] allegations of child abuse were not only brought in good faith but were proven to\r\nbe absolutely true.\"  As discussed in relation to the conservatorship issues, the evidence did not\r\ncorroborate Moe's allegations of abuse, but instead was sufficient to support the trial court's finding\r\nthat Malmquist had not engaged in a pattern or history of abuse towards L.M.M. or S.D.M. \r\nAccordingly, this claim does not demonstrate an abuse of discretion on behalf of the trial court. \r\nMoe's fifth issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHarold and Irene, on the other hand, assert several grounds for their claim that the\r\ntrial court abused its discretion in awarding attorney's fees against them in favor of the ad litem and\r\nMalmquist's attorney.  They urge that these awards constitute impermissible sanctions levied against\r\nthem in an attempt to collect fees owed by their apparently insolvent daughter,<sup> (18)</sup> which are designed\r\nto punish them for helping her financially<sup> (19)</sup> and to discourage them from being involved in further\r\nlitigation regarding the custody of their grandchildren.  Harold and Irene also urge that the awards\r\nwere an abuse of discretion because the ad litem and Malmquist's attorney failed to segregate their\r\nfees among Moe and them and between different proceedings, actions, and motions; they urge that\r\nthey should not be responsible for any fees incurred prior to August 26, 2003, the date they\r\nintervened.  Finally, the grandparents challenge the award of the ad litem's fees against them on the\r\ngrounds that there is no evidence or insufficient evidence that their conduct made the appointment\r\nof the ad litem necessary.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em></em></span><span><em>\tAttorney's fees as sanctions</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tHarold and Irene's argument that the attorney's fees were assessed against them as\r\nan impermissible sanction is without merit because the trial court did not award the attorney's fees\r\nas sanctions.  The court denied Malmquist's motion to enter a monetary sanction against Harold and\r\nIrene<sup> (20)</sup> and stated that these fees were awarded against them \"[p]ursuant to Section 106.002 of the\r\nTexas Family Code . . . as reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and expenses.\"  Thus, rather than\r\nconstituting an award of sanctions for any fees that accrued or any conduct that occurred in prior\r\nlitigation, the attorney's fees awarded in the June 2004 order are merely a judgment to collect the\r\nfees that accrued in the current phase of litigation, which was initiated by Moe and in which the\r\ngrandparents intervened.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHarold and Irene do not dispute that they were a party to the instant case, and they do\r\nnot challenge that the fee amounts awarded to either Malmquist's attorney or the ad litem were\r\nunreasonable or unnecessary.  Instead, they only dispute their responsibility for the fees by claiming\r\nthat the record demonstrates no evidence or insufficient evidence to find that they have aided,\r\nabetted, encouraged, or conspired with Moe in the litigation, or that their actions have been frivolous\r\nor in bad faith.  Because these fees were not entered as sanctions, however, there is no need for\r\nevidence of conspiracy or bad faith on their behalf.  Rather, to affirm the award, there need only be\r\nsufficient evidence in the record upon which the trial court could determine the award was\r\n\"reasonable.\"  In a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, this is the only statutorily-defined\r\nrequirement and trial courts are otherwise afforded broad discretion in determining the propriety of\r\nan attorney's fees award.  <em>See</em> Tex. Fam. Code. Ann. § 106.002.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence are factors to be considered in\r\nwhether the trial court abused its discretion, but they are not independent grounds of error.  <em>Doyle\r\nv. Doyle</em>, 955 S.W.2d 478, 479 (Tex. App.--Austin 1997, no pet.).  In reviewing the legal sufficiency\r\nof the evidence, we consider the evidence in a light most favorable to the finding to determine\r\nwhether a reasonable trier of fact could have formed a firm belief or conviction that its finding was\r\ntrue and we must disregard all evidence that a reasonable factfinder could have disbelieved or found\r\nto have been incredible.  <em>In re J.L.</em>, 163 S.W.3d 79, 85 (Tex. 2005).  \"Under traditional factual\r\nsufficiency standards, a court determines if a finding is so against the great weight and\r\npreponderance of the evidence that it is manifestly unjust, shocks the conscience, or clearly\r\ndemonstrates bias.\"  <em>In re J.F.C.</em>, 96 S.W.3d 256, 264 (Tex. 2002). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough the grandparents claimed to be adverse to Moe in the current litigation, their\r\ntestimony revealed otherwise.  When asked what Moe had done wrong as a parent, Harold testified\r\nthat \"the only thing I can think of [is] talking about their father and stuff like that in front of the\r\nkids.\"  He was asked this question several times, but offered nothing further.  The trial court\r\nexpressed surprise that, although \"given five opportunities,\" Harold failed to mention either the tape-recorder incident involving S.D.M. or the school incident, where Moe screamed at and belittled\r\nL.M.M.  Irene testified that she did not believe Moe posed a psychological danger to the children,\r\nthat Moe's visits with the children did not need to be supervised, and that the court's limitations on\r\nMoe's rights were imposed as punishment.  Moe's sister agreed that \"the goal that [she, Moe, the\r\ngrandparents], and other family members have had for the last eight years is to have custody of these\r\nchildren removed from [Malmquist] and restored to [Moe].\"  The other evidence concerning whether\r\nthe grandparents encouraged Moe's previous litigation through their financial support is irrelevant\r\nto this issue because the fees awarded in the June 2004 order only pertain to the attorneys' work in\r\nthe current action, which was brought by Moe and to which the grandparents were a party.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause there is legally sufficient, credible evidence on which the trial court could\r\ndetermine that the grandparents were aligned with Moe in the current litigation and because the fees\r\nwere not awarded as sanctions, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to determine that\r\nit was \"reasonable\" for Harold and Irene to be held jointly and severally responsible for the resulting\r\nattorney's fees accrued by Malmquist's attorney and the ad litem. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\tFailure to segregate fees</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHarold and Irene also challenge the attorney's fees award on the grounds that the\r\nattorneys failed to segregate their fees as between Moe and themselves<sup> (21)</sup> or between various\r\nproceedings, actions, and motions.  They urge that it was an abuse of discretion to hold them\r\nresponsible for any fees that accrued prior to their intervention into the lawsuit on August 26, 2003.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause Harold and Irene do not cite any authority in support of their claim that the\r\nattorney's fees were unreasonable unless segregated, this issue is waived.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 38.1\r\n(appellant's brief must contain \"a clear and concise argument . . . with appropriate citations to\r\nauthorities).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFurthermore, Harold and Irene do not appear to have otherwise preserved error on the\r\nissue of whether the trial court abused its discretion by awarding unsegregated fees against them. <em>\r\nSee</em> Tex. R. App. P. 33.1 (to preserve appellate issue, party must present timely, specific objection,\r\nrequest, or motion and obtain ruling or refusal to rule from trial court); <em>Villasenor v. Villasenor</em>, 911\r\nS.W.2d 411, 420 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1995, no writ) (complaint about failure to segregate\r\nattorney's fees was waived because not raised in open court or specifically in motion for new trial). \r\nWhen the ad litem offered testimony of her attorney's fees and an exhibit in support of them, the\r\ngrandparents did not object on any ground, including the failure to segregate fees.  On cross-examination of the ad litem, their counsel elicited testimony that, since the grandparents'\r\nintervention, the ad litem had accrued about $37,000 in fees, about $15,000 of which pertained to\r\nthe motion to modify.  This evidence supports the trial court's award of $15,000 in favor of the ad\r\nlitem, jointly and severally against Moe and the grandparents, because that is the amount she testified\r\nhad accrued since their intervention on the issue relevant to their motion--the modification of\r\nconservatorship.  Likewise, when Malmquist's attorney testified to his fees, the grandparents did not\r\nobject.  Malmquist's attorney stated in response to their cross-examination that he was owed over\r\n$30,000 for the current litigation.  Although he did concede that this amount covered the entire\r\nproceeding, beginning with Moe's motion filed a year before the grandparents intervened, the\r\ngrandparents never argued to the trial court that the fees should be segregated on this basis.  And,\r\nin any event, the trial court only assessed $20,000 in favor of Malmquist's attorney against Moe and\r\nthe grandparents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFollowing both the ad litem's and Malmquist's attorney's presentation of fees, the\r\nonly arguments made by Harold and Irene on the issue of attorney's fees were (1) that \"[Malmquist]\r\ndoesn't need to be rewarded. . . .  Because if that happens, he's going to be king of the world, and\r\nhe's got empowerment problems and problems using his power and his authority\" and (2) that\r\ninterest should not be assessed on the awards.  These arguments do not speak to whether it was error\r\nto not segregate the fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the July 23, 2003, hearing on the motion for reconsideration of the June 2004\r\norder, Moe's attorney stated that \"the Court has no authority to assess attorney's fees or costs against\r\n[Harold and Irene],\" to which the trial court asked, \"Do you represent [the grandparents]?,\" and she\r\nresponded, \"No, not at this time.\"  The court said, \"then I don't want to hear any argument about\r\nthat. . . .  [L]et [their counsel] address that.\"  Thereafter, the grandparents' attorney stated that \"my\r\ninstructions from [Harold and Irene] with regard to the motion for reconsideration are to be neutral\r\nabout it, let the Court make whatever decisions it makes. . . .  [T]hat's all I have to say about the\r\nmotion for reconsideration.\"  The trial court then ruled, stating that \"the motion for reconsideration\r\nis, in all respects, denied.\"  Although Harold and Irene subsequently asserted the failure to segregate\r\nas an error in a motion for new trial on July 26, 2004, this came after their counsel waived any error\r\nat the hearing. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn any event, when non-parents intervene in suits affecting the parent-child\r\nrelationship, those parties are equally subject to having attorney's fees assessed against them, and\r\nthere is no requirement that the fees be segregated between the parental and non-parental parties.<em> \r\nSee</em> <em>Garner v. Garner</em>, 673 S.W.2d 413, 415, 418 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 1984, writ dism'd w.o.j.)<em>\r\n</em>(not abuse of discretion to award attorney's fees against mother and maternal grandparents, where\r\nmaternal grandparents intervened seeking custody against wishes of mother, but custody was\r\nawarded to paternal grandparents); <em>Yancey v. Koonce</em>, 645 S.W.2d 861, 864-65 (Tex. App.--El Paso\r\n1983, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (not abuse of discretion to award attorney's fees against both father and\r\npaternal grandparents, where latter intervened seeking custody of child in event that custody not\r\nawarded to father).  Section 106.002 provides the court broad discretion in a suit affecting a parent-child relationship to award attorney's fees as it deems \"reasonable.\"  Tex. Fam. Code Ann.\r\n§ 106.002.  There is no need to segregate attorney's fees for separate claims if they \"arise from the\r\nsame transaction and are so interrelated that their prosecution or defense entails proof or denial of\r\nessentially the same facts.\"  <em>Villasenor</em>, 911 S.W.2d at 420.  Here, all issues raised in the underlying\r\nlitigation--whether concerning the requests to modify conservatorship or the requests to hold Moe\r\nand Malmquist in contempt for violating court orders--centered on what should be done in the\r\nchildren's best interest and were, therefore, dependent on the same facts--those concerning the\r\nparents' actions and what the best home environment would be for the children.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGiven the grandparents' failure to cite supporting authority, their failure to raise the\r\nissue before the trial court, and the existence of authority contrary to their position, the trial court did\r\nnot abuse its discretion in finding that it was reasonable to award the attorney's fees against Moe and\r\nthe grandparents, jointly and severally, without segregation of those fees. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em></em></span><span><em>\tAd litem's fees</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tHarold and Irene's final ground for complaining that the trial court abused its\r\ndiscretion in assessing attorney's fees against them, jointly and severally with Moe, is that they\r\nshould not be responsible for any of the ad litem's fees because they did nothing to necessitate the\r\nad litem's appointment or continued involvement.  While we agree that an ad litem's fees should not\r\nbe taxed against a party who was not responsible for any of those fees being incurred, <em>see Dawson\r\nv. Garcia</em>, 666 S.W.2d 254, 265 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1984, no writ), we disagree with the\r\ngrandparents' contention that they have no such responsibility in this case.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe ad litem's purpose was to represent the children's best interests, which included\r\nher work to determine who should be appointed and/or maintained as a conservator for the children. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 107.021 (West Supp. 2004-05).  The grandparents intervened, seeking\r\nappointment as the children's sole and/or joint managing conservators, thereby contributing to the\r\nneed for the ad litem's continued involvement in the case.  The grandparents' intervention required\r\nadditional preparation and time on the ad litem's behalf, such as her having to organize a home study\r\nfor the grandparents and having to prepare cross-examinations of them and the multiple witnesses\r\nthey called on their behalf.  Although the grandparents were not acting in bad faith, that is not a\r\nrequirement in order to hold them responsible for a portion of the ad litem's fees.  <em>See Dawson</em>, 666\r\nS.W.2d at 265.  Moreover, as discussed in relation to the segregation of fees, the ad litem's testimony\r\ndemonstrates that the only fees assessed in her favor against Harold and Irene were those that\r\naccrued following their intervention and in relation to their issue--the modification of\r\nconservatorship.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis case is distinguishable from <em>Minns v. Minns</em>, which held it was an abuse of\r\ndiscretion for the ad litem's fees to be assessed, jointly and severally, against the father and the\r\npaternal grandmother, who intervened asking to be named as a possessory conservator with visitation\r\nrights.  615 S.W.2d 893, 897-98 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1981, writ dism'd).  The holding\r\nin <em>Minns </em>was based on the court's determination that the grandmother was a \"successful\" party\r\nbecause she was granted the relief requested in her petition.  <em>Id</em>. at 898 (citing Tex. R. Civ. P. 131\r\n(successful party to a suit shall recover costs from adversary)).  Unlike the grandmother in <em>Minns</em>,\r\nhere the grandparents were ultimately not successful, given that they were not appointed sole or joint\r\nmanaging conservatorship as requested in their petition.  Based on this and on the facts that they\r\ncontributed to the ad litem's work and that the trial court only assessed the portion of the ad litem's\r\nfees that accrued after their involvement and in relation to their issue, it was reasonable for the trial\r\ncourt to hold Harold and Irene responsible for part of the ad litem's fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney's fees in favor of\r\nMalmquist's attorney and the ad litem, against the grandparents and Moe, jointly and severally, on\r\nthe grounds that the fees constituted an impermissible sanction, that the fees should have been\r\nsegregated, or that the grandparents did not contribute to the need for the ad litem.  Harold and\r\nIrene's second and third issues are overruled.<strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>Family Code section 261.106</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn Moe's sixth issue and in the grandparents' fourth<sup> (22)</sup> issue, they assert that it violated\r\nsection 261.106 of the family code to award attorney's fees against them because they are \"immune\"\r\nfrom the imposition of the fees based on their \"good faith . . . participat[ion] in a judicial proceeding\r\narising from a report, petition, or investigation of alleged child abuse.\"  Tex. Fam. Code Ann.\r\n§ 261.106 (West 2002).  Moe and the grandparents urge that, because they supported their requests\r\nto be awarded conservatorship over Malmquist with allegations that Malmquist abused the children,\r\nthey should be immunized from paying any attorney's fees incurred in litigating this custody battle. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNeither Moe nor the grandparents, however, once mentioned this statute or claimed\r\nimmunity before the trial court, even in Moe's <em>Motion for Reconsideration of Award of Attorney's\r\nFees </em>or in the grandparents' <em>Motion for New Trial</em>, which was dedicated solely to the challenge of\r\nthe attorney's fees.  Therefore, error was not preserved on this issue.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 33.1.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn any event, the immunity prescribed by section 261.106 would not protect Moe or\r\nthe grandparents here because this litigation primarily concerned the modification of a custody order;\r\nit was not a \"child abuse case.\"  \"The clear import of the progression of the [duty-to-report] statutes\r\nis that the legislature intended to protect reporters of child abuse from <em>liability for the act of\r\nreporting the abuse itself</em>, not from civil or criminal liability generally.<em>  State v.

R. Civ. P. 306a, 329b (regarding timetables for plenary power). \r\nMalmquist agrees that the October 2004 reformed order, which contained the $5,000 appellate\r\naward, was void, but he asserts that the award should be upheld as a \"temporary order\" under section\r\n109.001.  <em>See</em> Tex.

By its plain language, this provision does not apply to preserve the award of Malmquist's\r\nappellate attorney's fees.  Here, after the appeal was perfected, there was no motion filed by any\r\nparty or by the court <em>sua sponte </em>seeking the temporary award of appellate attorney's fees on\r\nMalmquist's behalf.<em>  See id. </em> Even if Malmquist's previous motion, filed in July 2004, were\r\nconsidered as satisfying this requirement, there was no notice given to the parties about a temporary\r\norder for appellate attorney's fees and no hearing on the matter, as required by the statute.  <em>See id. </em>\r\n\tBecause there was no temporary order entered awarding Malmquist's attorney\r\nappellate fees and the October 2004 reformed order that attempted to do so was void, we vacate the\r\n$5,000 in appellate fees awarded in favor of Malmquist's attorney.

L.M.M., the daughter, turned sixteen in April 2005, and S.D.M., the son, will be fifteen in\r\nSeptember 2005. \r\n</p><p>2.   We will refer to the mother as \"Moe\" and the grandparents as \"Harold and Irene\" or \"the\r\ngrandparents.\"\r\n</p><p>3.   The record presents some confusion over the exact modifications sought by Moe.  On its\r\nface, her <em>Second Amended Petition to Modify Parent-Child Relationship </em>makes no mention of a\r\nrequest to be appointed as the children's sole managing conservator, and such a request was likewise\r\nnot made in her prior motions to modify.  Instead, her petition makes a series of allegations about\r\nMalmquist's behavior with the children--that he would drink and drive, make disparaging comments\r\nabout Moe, and abuse the children emotionally and physically--and requests that she be given the\r\nright to determine S.D.M.'s primary residence.  Also, Moe testified that she wanted L.M.M. to live\r\nwith Malmquist and S.D.M. to live with her.  Nevertheless, the court and other parties refer to Moe's\r\npetition as a request that she be appointed sole managing conservator of the children.  For example,\r\nin its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the trial court specifically found that Moe's \"request\r\nto be appointed as sole managing conservator of [L.M.M. and S.D.M.] is not in the best interest of\r\n[the children].\"  And, in his brief, Malmquist cites to Moe's petition as a \"request that she be named\r\nas sole managing conservator of the children.\"  Although it does not appear that Moe asserted this\r\nrequest within the four corners of her petition, for the purpose of this appeal, we will assume that a\r\nrequest by Moe to be the children's sole managing conservator was properly before the trial court.\r\n</p><p>4.   At the conclusion of the October 2003 hearings, the children were temporarily placed at\r\nthe Texas Baptist Children's Home, by agreement of the parties, until a better solution could be\r\nfound.  On October 30, 2003, the court ordered that, until the March 2004 review hearing, Malmquist\r\nwould retain the right to establish the children's residence, but the location was limited to the\r\ngrandparents' home, and that Malmquist would have possession on the first, third and fifth\r\nweekends, as well as the winter holidays, while Moe was to have only supervised visits twice a\r\nmonth at Kids Exchange once she completed her contempt sentence and began treatment with a\r\ntherapist.\r\n</p><p>5.   Those specific terms were set forth in an attachment to the June 2004 order.\r\n</p><p>6.   Several witnesses testified about this episode, including Malmquist, police officers, the\r\nchildren's therapist, school counselors, and S.D.M.\r\n</p><p>7.   This included conducting individual, in camera interviews with both L.M.M. and S.D.M.\r\nBecause their living arrangement preferences are not binding on the trial court, <em>see</em> Tex. Fam. Code\r\nAnn. § 153.009 (West 2002), and we respect the need for confidentiality of this sensitive testimony,\r\ntheir stated preferences will not be repeated here.  We presume the trial court considered this\r\ntestimony, along with all of the other evidence, and afforded it appropriate weight when determining\r\nwhat was in the best interest of the children.  <em>See Gillespie v. Gillespie</em>, 644 S.W.2d 449, 450-51\r\n(Tex. 1982). \r\n</p><p>8.   On appeal, no party asserts that the grandparents should have been appointed as\r\nconservators of the children.\r\n</p><p>9.   On April 21, 2004, Dr. Lowry wrote a letter to the court stating, \"I believe she can be\r\ntrusted with standard visitation.\"\r\n</p><p>10.   The court stated that Moe \"has had opportunities prior to the hearing in October, as far\r\nback as almost 10 years, to go to the counseling. . . .  And she has continually and willfully refused\r\nto do it, and I'm not going to make it any more convenient for her now.  It's Dr. Lowry, and she can\r\neither go or she cannot go. . . .  But the gate to visitation, [Moe] has the key.\"\r\n</p><p>11.   The trial court's order specifically stated that, upon the therapists' written agreement that\r\n\"any specific period of <em>possession</em> is not in the children's best interest, . . . that period of <em>possession</em>\r\nis ordered [to] not occur.\" (Emphasis added.)\r\n</p><p>12.   <em>See In re R.D.Y.</em>, 92 S.W.3d 433 (Tex. 2002) (Justice Hecht writing that petition for review\r\nshould be granted because courts of appeals disagree about whether it is permissible to order that\r\nconservator's possession rights are \"solely at the discretion of a managing conservator,\" and listing\r\nrelevant opinions).\r\n</p><p>13.   Contrary to these cases, however, in <em>In re R.D.Y.</em>, the First Court of Appeals affirmed a\r\ntrial court's order that gave the grandmother \"sole discretion\" over the mother's possession rights\r\nbased on the grandmother's determination of whether the mother was \"mentally and physically\r\ncapable of exercising her visitation with the child.\"  51 S.W.3d 314, 323 n.1, 324 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, pet. denied).  The court held this order was not an abuse of\r\ndiscretion because the mother could enforce it by filing a motion to modify if she felt the\r\ngrandmother was abusing her power to evaluate whether or not the mother was capable of exercising\r\nher visitation rights.  <em>Id</em>. at 324.  We agree with the Texarkana court's statement about<em> In re R.D.Y.\r\n</em>that, \"[a]lthough a judge can rightfully restrict the conditions of [visitation] . . ., we respectfully\r\ndisagree . . . that giving total discretion, unenforceable by contempt, to one conservator constitutes\r\na mere restriction on the conditions of visitation.\"  <em>In re A.P.S.</em>, 54 S.W.3d 493, 499 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Texarkana 2001, no pet.).\r\n</p><p>14.   Moe states that her four issues regarding the conservatorship order constitute a challenge\r\nto twelve findings of fact issued by the trial court in relation to that order.  The record demonstrates\r\nsufficient evidence to support those findings.\r\n</p><p>15.   Malmquist was also ordered to pay the attorney ad litem $5,000, which he does not dispute\r\non appeal.\r\n</p><p>16.   The order stated that the appellate fees were awarded against Moe and the grandparents,\r\njointly and severally, in favor of John Barrett, and that the award was \"conditioned on the pursuit\r\nby any or all of said parties of an ultimately unsuccessful appeal.\"  It also provided for a remittitur\r\nof $5,000 to Moe and the grandparents, jointly and severally, \"if an appeal is not perfected.\"\r\n</p><p>17. \tMoe claims it was an abuse of discretion to assess \"any\" fees against her for Malmquist's\r\nattorney and to assess \"the greater portion of\" the fees against her for the ad litem.\r\n</p><p>18. \tThey believe the court awarded fees against them jointly and severally because\r\nMalmquist's attorney has been unable to collect a prior judgment against Moe (for $20,000 in fees)\r\nsince 1997. \r\n</p><p>19. \tIrene testified that, including the $2,500 worth of attorney's fees that they have paid for\r\nMoe in the current litigation, the total amount of attorney's fees they have paid on Moe's behalf is\r\napproximately $42,000, that Moe has paid very little of it back, and that they do not expect her to\r\nreimburse them.  She also testified that they purchased the mortgage on Moe's house in 2001; the\r\ntotal cost of the loan was $87,925.  Moe testified that Harold and Irene do not require her to pay rent. \r\n</p><p>20.   On October 21, 2003, Malmquist filed a motion seeking (1) a judgment of attorney's fees\r\nin favor of his attorney, jointly and severally against Moe and the grandparents, and (2) the entry of\r\na monetary sanction against Harold and Irene.  The June 2004 order stated that it considered all\r\nmotions before it, that the relief sought by Malmquist was denied in part and granted in part, and that\r\nall requested relief \"not expressly granted herein is denied.\"  The June order did not mention the\r\nsanctions sought by Malmquist and, therefore, it denied that relief.\r\n</p><p>21.   Harold and Irene additionally claim that Malmquist's attorney should have allocated the\r\nfees between the ad litem, in addition to Moe and themselves, and that the ad litem should have\r\nallocated her fees against Malmquist, in addition to Moe and themselves.  But since no fees were\r\nassessed against the ad litem, any failure to segregate fees to the ad litem is immaterial.  Further, a\r\nportion of the ad litem's fees were assessed separately against Malmquist, and so this argument is\r\nalso without merit.\r\n</p><p>22.   Although not designated as the grandparents' \"fourth\" issue, it was the sole issue asserted\r\nin their supplemental brief, following the three issues raised in their initial brief.\r\n</p><p>23.   Moe states that her fifth, sixth, and seventh issues regarding the attorneys constitute a\r\nchallenge to seven findings of fact issued by the trial court in relation to that order.  The record\r\ndemonstrates sufficient evidence to support those findings.</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",

Moe appeals the trial court's order denying her motion\r\nto modify, maintaining both parents as joint managing conservators with Malmquist having the right\r\nto determine the children's primary residence, and putting restrictions and conditions upon Moe's\r\nrights of possession and access.  Moe's parents, Harold and Irene Moe,<sup> (2)</sup> intervened below, seeking\r\nto be appointed as conservators of the children, and now join Moe as appellants to challenge the\r\nattorney's fees awarded against themselves and Moe, jointly and severally, in favor of Malmquist's\r\nattorney and the children's attorney ad litem.  We will affirm the June 2004 order, but reverse an\r\naward of appellate attorney's fees that was contained in a subsequent, void order.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><center>PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</center></strong>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSince the final divorce decree was entered in July 1994, both parents have filed\r\nmultiple motions to modify conservatorship and both have been held in contempt on multiple\r\noccasions for violating court orders pertaining to their parental actions.  Also, both parents have\r\nconsistently disputed their financial responsibility for child support, the children's medical expenses,\r\nand the unpaid fees owed to their personal attorneys, the attorney ad litem, and the children's\r\ntherapist.  The trial court recognized that both parents--but particularly Moe--have overlooked the\r\ndamage this litigation has inflicted on their children and have, in fact, involved L.M.M. and S.D.M\r\nin the cross-fire.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe phase of litigation at issue began with an April 2003 motion that Moe filed to\r\nreduce her child support obligation and collect her attorney's fees.  She later filed several amended\r\nmotions to additionally request that the trial court hold Malmquist in contempt, award her additional\r\nperiods of possession, award her the right to determine S.D.M.'s primary residence, and appoint her\r\nas the children's sole managing conservator.<sup> (3)</sup>  The attorney ad litem intervened seeking to enforce\r\nthe prior orders, hold the parents in contempt for their violations, enjoin them from further\r\nviolations, and impose additional orders upon them.  Malmquist responded, denying Moe's\r\nallegations, seeking attorney's fees, and asking the court to deny Moe's requests.  Harold and Irene\r\nMoe, the grandparents, then filed a plea in intervention seeking that they be named sole managing\r\nconservators or joint managing conservators and that they recover their attorney's fees.  Malmquist\r\nand the ad litem filed additional motions to collect their attorney's fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter a four-day hearing in October 2003 and a three-day review hearing in March\r\n2004,<sup> (4)</sup> the trial court announced its proposed order, and the parties reconvened in April and May to\r\nfurther discuss the details of what should be included in that order.  The court then signed a final\r\norder on June 28, 2004, which maintained Moe and Malmquist as joint managing conservators with\r\nMalmquist having the right to establish the children's primary residence, but placed additional\r\nrestrictions on Moe's rights of possession and access, and conditioned her rights on continued\r\npsychological treatment.  The June 2004 order also awarded attorney's fees against Moe and the\r\ngrandparents, jointly and severally, in favor of the ad litem (for $15,000) and Malmquist's attorney\r\n(for $20,000, without mention of any fees that might be incurred on appeal) and awarded attorney's\r\nfees against Malmquist in favor of the ad litem (for $5,000).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn July 2004, Moe filed a motion for reconsideration and/or for a new trial, and\r\nMalmquist filed a motion to reform the judgment to include an award of appellate attorney's fees. \r\nAt a hearing on July 23, 2004, the trial court denied Moe's requests and stated that it would enter an\r\naward of $5,000 in favor of Malmquist's attorney against Harold and Irene in the event that they filed\r\nan unsuccessful appeal.  Although the court requested at that time for Malmquist's attorney to\r\nprepare an order reflecting that award, no such order appears in the record.  The award of appellate\r\nfees was not memorialized in writing until October 18, 2004, when the trial court issued a modified\r\nfinal order, which differed from the June order only by its inclusion of the appellate attorney's fees\r\naward.  The parties agree on appeal that the October 2004 order is void because it was issued after\r\nthe expiration of the court's plenary power and that the June 2004 order controls.  In November\r\n2004, the trial court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law in response to requests by Moe\r\nand the grandparents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoe appeals, challenging the trial court's order regarding conservatorship issues and\r\nattorney's fees.  Harold and Irene also appeal, confining their challenge to the award of attorney's\r\nfees.  Malmquist responds that the trial court committed no abuse of discretion regarding either the\r\nconservatorship issues or the attorney's fees and asks this Court to uphold the June 2004 order in all\r\nrespects.  Malmquist also urges that, although the October 2004 order is void, the award of appellate\r\nattorney's fees should be upheld as a temporary order pursuant to section 109.001 of the family code. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 109.001 (West 2002).  The ad litem asserts that the award of ad litem\r\nfees against Moe and the grandparents, jointly and severally, should be upheld.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong></strong></span><span><strong>CONSERVATORSHIP ISSUES</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough the June 2004 order maintained Moe and Malmquist as joint managing\r\nconservators with Malmquist having the exclusive right to determine the children's primary\r\nresidence, as the case had been since August 2002, it modified Moe's possession and access rights\r\nby adding restrictions and conditions to the terms.  Whereas the August 2002 order employed the\r\nfamily code's \"standard possession order,\" as set forth in sections 153.311 through 153.317, the June\r\n2004 order stated that \"the provisions of the Standard Possession Order are not appropriate in this\r\ncase and . . . would not be in the children's best interest.\"  <em>See</em> Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §§ 153.311-.317\r\n(West 2002 &amp; Supp. 2004-05).  Instead, the court crafted an order that conditioned Moe's rights of\r\npossession and access on her attending therapy with Dr. Thomas Lowry.  The court ordered that,\r\nthirty days after Moe had \"begun a regular course of psychological treatment with Dr. Thomas Lowry\r\nand [] provided proof thereof [to all parties],\" she could engage in supervised visitation at Kids\r\nExchange from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month and, once\r\nnotice of her treatment with Dr. Lowry had been provided, she could have telephone contact with\r\nthe children.  The court also provided for the possibility of increased possession by Moe if certain\r\nconditions were met.  It ordered that, if Moe continued her treatment with Dr. Lowry, then as of\r\nAugust 1, 2004, she could have the children on the second and fourth Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to\r\n10:00 p.m., and as of September 1, 2004, from Saturday at 9:00 a.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m.  These\r\nperiods of possession were to be supervised by Harold Moe until September 15, 2004, and thereafter\r\ncould be unsupervised.  Then, on December 1, 2004, assuming Moe continued treatment with Dr.\r\nLowry, the terms of the family code's standard possession order would supersede the June 2004\r\norder, providing Moe with additional conservatorship rights.<sup> (5)</sup>  All possibilities of Moe's increased\r\npossession were, however, subject to her compliance with the order that she continue treatment with\r\nDr. Lowry.  And the court ordered that Dr. Lowry should consult the children's therapist to\r\n\"determine the impact of the increased possession,\" and \"[i]f Dr. Thomas Lowry <strong>and</strong> the children's\r\ncounselor agree that any specific period of possession is not in the best interest of the child or\r\nchildren, and have stated so in writing, that period of possession is ordered [to] not occur.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoe challenges the conservatorship order on two basic grounds: she urges that the\r\ntrial court abused its discretion in awarding certain privileges to Malmquist and in imposing certain\r\nlimitations on her.  More specifically, Moe asserts that the trial court abused its discretion and\r\nviolated the family code by (1) maintaining Malmquist as joint managing conservator with the right\r\nto determine the children's primary residence because Malmquist has a history of abusing the\r\nchildren, making it impermissible for him to be the joint managing conservator under section\r\n153.004(b) of the family code, and by (2) granting Moe less than the standard possession order, as\r\ndefined by section 153.311 of the family code; by not awarding Moe specific, enforceable periods\r\nof possession and access; and by making Moe's visitation rights dependent on the approval of her\r\nand the children's therapists, which poses the risk that her parental rights could be unconstitutionally\r\ndenied by <em>de facto </em>termination and which constitutes an impermissible delegation of the trial court's\r\nauthority to determine conservatorship rights.  <em>See id</em>. § 153.004(b) (West Supp. 2004-05), § 153.311\r\n(West 2002).<strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>Standard of Review</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn determining issues of conservatorship and possession and access, the primary\r\nconsideration is always the best interest of the child.  <em>See</em> <em>id</em>. § 153.002 (West 2002); <em>Lenz v. Lenz</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1747741\"><a href=\"/opinion/1747741/lenz-v-lenz/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 14 (Tex. 2002).  Trial courts have broad discretion to determine what is in a child's\r\nbest interest.  <em>Coleman v. Coleman</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1747221\"><a href=\"/opinion/1747221/coleman-v-coleman/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span>, 110 (Tex. App.--Austin 2003, no pet.).  A trial\r\ncourt's order modifying a joint managing conservatorship will not be disturbed on appeal unless a\r\nclear abuse of discretion is established by the complaining party.  <em>Echols v. Olivarez</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1588572\"><a href=\"/opinion/1588572/echols-v-olivarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span>,\r\n477 (Tex. App.--Austin 2002, no pet.).  This is because conservatorship determinations are\r\n\"intensely fact driven,\" <em>Lenz</em>, 79 S.W.3d at 19, and the trial court is in the best position to observe\r\nthe witnesses and \"can 'feel' the forces, powers, and influences that cannot be discerned by merely\r\nreading the record.\"  <em>Echols</em>, 85 S.W.3d at 477.  To demonstrate an abuse of discretion, therefore,\r\nthe appellant must show that the trial court acted in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner, or without\r\nreference to guiding principles of law.  <em>Coleman</em>, 109 S.W.3d at 110.  As long as some evidence of\r\na substantive and probative character exists to support the order, we will not substitute our judgment\r\nfor that of the trial court.  <em>Echols</em>, 85 S.W.3d at 477.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong></strong></span><span><strong>Evidence Before the Trial Court</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tOver the course of several hearings in October 2003 and March 2004, the trial court\r\nheard testimony from over two dozen witnesses, including many mental health and educational\r\nprofessionals, and conducted in camera interviews with L.M.M. and S.D.M. concerning Moe's and\r\nMalmquist's behaviors and the family's general situation.  The overall theme that developed through\r\nthis wealth of evidence was as follows: Moe and Malmquist have had a highly contentious\r\nrelationship since 1994, and the children have suffered, academically and emotionally, as a result. \r\nAs stated by the children's therapist, the family has been in \"perpetual crisis mode\" for several years,\r\nand as described by Moe's sister, \"[Moe and Malmquist] don't speak to each other, but they fight\r\neach other through the kids.\"  Although various courts have repeatedly ordered the parents to not\r\ndisparage the other in front of the children, to not involve the children in the custody and child\r\nsupport disputes, and to maintain a consistent regimen of counseling for both themselves and the\r\nchildren, both parents have failed to comply with these orders and have been held in contempt for\r\ntheir failures.  Several witnesses described Moe as having psychological disorders, exhibiting intense\r\nand uncontrollable anger, obsessing over things she believes Malmquist has done wrong, and\r\nconsistently using the children as weapons against Malmquist.  Despite this, evidence was presented\r\nthat S.D.M. is protective of his mother and feels bonded to her, and that Moe loves her children. \r\nRegarding Malmquist, witnesses repeatedly testified that he has an authoritarian attitude, uses\r\nphysical discipline, relies on calling the sheriff's department to resolve his disagreements with the\r\nchildren, and is unable or unwilling to communicate with the children.  On the other hand, several\r\nwitnesses described Malmquist as being very involved at the children's school, being attentive to and\r\nconcerned about their needs and successes, using appropriate methods of discipline, and doing the\r\nbest he can in the difficult situations that Moe creates between him and the children.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition to general testimony about the parents' characteristics and the family's\r\nsituation, the trial court also heard testimony about several specific episodes.  This evidence is\r\nsignificant because the trial court made several comments on the record that these episodes\r\ninfluenced its determinations about what conservatorship arrangement was in the best interest of the\r\nchildren.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMichelle Heckroth, a school counselor, testified about an incident that occurred\r\nbetween Moe and L.M.M. on May 19, 2003.  Heckroth testified that Moe was \"loud and upset\" and\r\n\"caused a scene\" in front of the middle school, apparently in response to L.M.M. having \"flipped her\r\nthe bird.\"  Moe screamed at L.M.M. that she was \"white trash\" and, despite Heckroth's efforts to\r\ncalm Moe down, her level of intensity did not subside.  Another school counselor, Andrew Karbo,\r\nwho also witnessed the scene, heard Moe call L.M.M. a \"bitch\" and saw that Moe was \"out of\r\ncontrol.\"  Heckroth testified that Moe blamed Malmquist for the occurrence and, when Heckroth\r\nattempted to counsel her about this incident, Moe only wanted to talk about Malmquist's\r\nshortcomings and continued to belittle him in front of the children.  At the end of the encounter, Moe\r\nsaid to Heckroth, \"it's not over.  She'll pay for this.\"  Heckroth testified that Moe and L.M.M.'s\r\nrelationship consisted of \"a lot of hate, a lot of anger\" and that, in twenty-one years of education, she\r\nhad \"never seen a mother degrade her child like that.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSeveral witnesses testified about an episode in September 2003, when Moe equipped\r\nS.D.M. with a tape recorder and instructed him to take it to Malmquist's house, conceal it in a\r\nbackpack, provoke a fight with Malmquist, and record Malmquist's reaction.  Moe's instructions to\r\nS.D.M., which she gave when they were practicing using the device, were caught on tape.  She\r\nadmitted that it was her voice on the tape telling S.D.M. that, \"when you get to court . . . you need\r\nto tell . . . all the stuff we do\" and \"[y]ou need to tell what you hate about living with [Malmquist].\r\n. . .  [H]e just sits around and f--ing drinks. . . .  We'll kick his ass in court if you just listen to me\r\nand just do what I say.\"  She acknowledged that this was a \"direct violation of the August 2002\r\norder,\" but claimed she only did it to have evidence for the sheriff's department and that she \"didn't\r\nthink about . . . it endangering [S.D.M.].\"  The trial court commented that he believed Moe's actions\r\nwith the tape recorder were \"evil, and I think my opinion's important on that issue.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEvidence was also presented to the trial court that Moe instructed the children to write\r\nletters about Malmquist's shortcomings and about their alleged preference to live with Moe.  A\r\ncounselor with Mothers Against Drunk Driving testified that, when Moe contacted her with concerns\r\nabout Malmquist drinking and driving, she advised Moe to have the children write letters expressing\r\ntheir feelings, but did not intend for Moe to \"coach\" or \"prompt\" them about what to write.  Moe\r\nadmitted that she instructed the children to write the letters and that she knew it was in violation of\r\nthe August 2002 order.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRegarding Malmquist's behavior, the trial court heard testimony about various\r\nincidents where Malmquist called the sheriff's department to resolve disputes with his children.  The\r\ntwo most prominent of these incidents involved S.D.M.  In the first, Malmquist noticed that a child\r\nsupport check, written to him from Moe's employer, was missing from his desk.  S.D.M. denied\r\nhaving taken it.  Two months later, Malmquist took S.D.M. to the police station about the missing\r\ncheck, and S.D.M. admitted to having taken it.  Malmquist claimed he wanted to teach S.D.M. that,\r\n\"if he did this later in life, [the consequences] would be a lot worse.\"  The officer who handled the\r\nmissing check incident testified that it is not unusual for parents to bring their children in to be talked\r\nto about bad behaviors and that, on average, he talks to children \"two or three times a month\" about\r\nsuch matters.  The children's therapist, however, testified that the use of such a disciplinary tactic\r\nwas intimidating to S.D.M., made him fearful, and decreased his respect for authority figures.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe second incident involving the sheriff's department occurred in September 2003,\r\nin connection with Moe's equipping S.D.M. with the hidden tape recorder.  By all accounts,<sup> (6)</sup> one\r\nmorning before school, S.D.M. hid the tape recorder in his backpack, and Malmquist told him to take\r\nout the trash.  S.D.M. refused, and Malmquist attempted to hurry up their morning routine by loading\r\nS.D.M.'s backpack into the truck while again telling S.D.M. to take out the trash.  When S.D.M.\r\nbecame very possessive of his bag, Malmquist looked inside and found the tape recorder.  Malmquist\r\ntook it and the bag, gave S.D.M. his lunch and books, told S.D.M. to wait outside for the bus, and\r\nlocked the door.  S.D.M. yelled and banged on the door, but Malmquist refused to let him back in. \r\nS.D.M. then threw something at the door and broke the window.  Malmquist told him to stay put and\r\ncalled the sheriff's department.  The officers arrived, handcuffed S.D.M., put him in the squad car,\r\nand took him to the downtown station.  Malmquist followed.  After leaving the station, Malmquist\r\ntook S.D.M. for an emergency session with the children's therapist, and then took him to school. \r\nSchool personnel testified that S.D.M. was upset and scared to go back to Malmquist's.  Malmquist\r\ntestified that, because S.D.M. was out of control, he believed it was appropriate to get the sheriff's\r\noffice involved.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, the issue of Malmquist's alleged drinking-and-driving was also the subject\r\nof testimony, in response to Moe's repeated accusations that Malmquist drives drunk with the\r\nchildren.  Malmquist acknowledged that he was pulled over on Halloween night, 2001, for driving\r\n48 mph in a 45 mph zone.  According to Malmquist, he was detained because another man of the\r\nsame name had an outstanding warrant.  Because the police intended to take him to the station to\r\nclear it up, Malmquist's sister came to retrieve the children.  Malmquist denied that the reason for\r\nhis sister coming was because he and his girlfriend were too inebriated to drive.  No DWI charges\r\nwere filed.  Although Malmquist admits to often having a mixed drink in the evenings when the\r\nchildren are present, he claims that he does not drink to the point of intoxication and that he never\r\ndrives intoxicated.  Multiple witnesses confirmed that they have never known Malmquist to drink\r\nand drive, that it would be inconsistent with his character to do so, and that he drinks responsibly in\r\nsocial settings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court also heard testimony from key witnesses about their recommendations\r\nfor a custody arrangement.<sup> (7)</sup>  In October 2003, the children's therapist, Tammy Wanamaker, testified\r\nthat it was not in the children's best interest to continue the joint conservatorship ordered in August\r\n2002 and that, thus far, they had not been able to achieve a healthy situation when both parents were\r\ninvolved.  But, she testified, both children have expressed a desire to have a relationship with both\r\nparents, and her general philosophy is to try and keep children \"in the home setting and try to\r\npromote the relationship with both parents.\"  Wanamaker felt that \"intensive\" therapy work with\r\nboth Moe and Malmquist was necessary.  Ultimately, Wanamaker testified that she \"would like to\r\nsee the children continue to have contact with their parents.  I think that supervised visitation may\r\nbe helpful for awhile, but I would like to, eventually, see them be able to have nonsupervised time\r\nwith both parents.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMalmquist testified that \"I'm not a perfect parent, but I try the best I can, and I\r\nhaven't made a hundred percent of the right choices, no one does . . . but I'm not here to condemn\r\nmyself.  I think I've done a great job raising these kids. . . .  I got them tutors. . . .  [When L.M.M.\r\nhid her progress report], I went and got it. . . .  [I] take them to school early in the mornings for\r\n[S.D.M.'s] football practice and after I drop them off, go to work.

She stated that, if she could not have\r\ncustody of the children, her preference would be that they live with her parents.  Two of Moe's\r\nsisters, Moe's adult daughter from a previous marriage, and three of Harold and Irene's friends\r\ntestified that they thought conservatorship should be awarded to the grandparents.<sup> (8)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the March review hearing, several witnesses testified that Malmquist had made\r\nimprovements.  Dr. Elizabeth Holtzman, Malmquist's psychologist, testified that Malmquist was\r\ncommitted to the therapeutic process, understood the need to change his authoritarian style, and\r\ndemonstrated to her that he could provide a stable environment for the children.  Scott Matthew, an\r\nassistant director for Williamson County Juvenile Services, testified that S.D.M. needed more\r\ndiscipline than Harold and Irene were providing and that, given his experience, it is better to not\r\nplace children with the grandparents when there is a viable parental option.  Nancy Graff, one of\r\nS.D.M.'s teachers, testified that Malmquist had been supportive of her efforts to improve S.D.M.'s\r\nacademic performance.  Malmquist testified that he had been attending counseling and parenting\r\nclasses and reading parenting books; he felt these things were helping him to be a better father. \r\nWanamaker testified that, since October, Malmquist had improved his ability to communicate with\r\nthe children and had not physically disciplined S.D.M., although their relationship was still \"rocky.\" \r\nWanamaker could not say whether it would be better to leave S.D.M. with Harold and Irene or move\r\nhim to Malmquist's; she did not feel it would benefit L.M.M. to be moved from her grandparents';\r\nand she felt the children should not be separated.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the hearing, Moe declined to offer any direct testimony.  And other witnesses had\r\nlittle to say about Moe because her involvement with the children since October had been minimal,\r\ngiven the time she spent in jail serving her contempt sentence and that, once released, she failed to\r\nbegin counseling with Dr. Lowry in order to see the children.  Moe testified on cross-examination\r\nthat she had attended one session with Dr. Lowry, but she had not scheduled another.<sup> (9)</sup>  Irene Moe\r\nand Moe's sister testified that they did not believe Moe posed a danger to the children, that her\r\nvisitation did not need to be supervised, and that the court's orders were primarily for the purpose\r\nof punishing Moe rather than protecting the children.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEvidence was also presented at the March hearing that, during the five months the\r\nchildren were residing at their grandparents' house, L.M.M.'s behavior and academic performance\r\nimproved, although she continued to struggle with grades and made poor choices for friends.  On\r\nthe other hand, S.D.M.'s attitude and grades declined drastically.  Although the grandparents claimed\r\nthat he behaved well at home, his teachers reported that he had anger management problems, was\r\nfailing, was in frequent violation of the dress code, and that he told them he could get away with\r\nanything because his grandparents would not discipline him.<strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>Analysis</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA joint managing conservatorship may be modified only upon establishing that (1)\r\nthere has been a material and substantial change of circumstances and (2) the modification would\r\nbe in the best interest of the child.  <em>See</em> Tex.

Here, Moe does not dispute that material and substantial changes to the family's circumstances\r\nhad occurred since the August 2002 order, but she argues that the trial court's June 2004 order did\r\nnot modify the conservatorship arrangement in a manner that was in the best interests of L.M.M. and\r\nS.D.M.  She sought to modify the August order to have Malmquist removed as a joint managing\r\nconservator and herself appointed as sole managing conservator.  Malmquist responds that, when\r\nconsidering all of the evidence before it, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Moe's\r\nmotion to modify and maintaining the parents as joint managing conservators with Malmquist having\r\nthe right to establish primary residence, while placing additional restrictions on Moe's possession\r\nand access rights.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\tMalmquist's rights of possession and access</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tMoe bases her argument against Malmquist's conservatorship on the presumptions\r\nestablished in Chapter 153 of the family code.  She argues that, while section 153.131 sets forth a\r\npresumption in favor of both parents being named as joint conservators, that was rebutted in this case\r\nby evidence that Malmquist abuses the children.  <em>See id</em>. § 153.004, .131.  Moe's arguments are,\r\nhowever, without merit in this modification proceeding because the Texas Supreme Court has\r\nunequivocally stated that the presumptions of Chapter 153 do not apply to Chapter 156 modification\r\nactions.  <em>In re V.L.K.</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></span>, 343 (Tex. 2002) (presumptions in Chapter 153 only govern\r\noriginal custody determinations).

She failed to satisfy this burden.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough several witnesses testified that Malmquist physically disciplined the\r\nchildren, such as slapping L.M.M. across the face or wrestling S.D.M. to the ground, none\r\ncharacterized this behavior as \"abuse.\"  The children's therapist testified that she did not believe\r\nMalmquist was physically abusing the children but she did worry that the exchanges between\r\nMalmquist and his son would become \"[m]ore physical, maybe more intense,\" as S.D.M. got larger\r\nand older.  The therapist also acknowledged that Moe had reported Malmquist to Child Protective\r\nServices on multiple occasions, and that each case was resolved in Malmquist's favor.  Further,\r\nMoe's allegations that Malmquist abused the children by drinking and driving were not corroborated\r\nby the testimony, and multiple witnesses testified that they had observed Malmquist with the\r\nchildren and believed they had a good relationship.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen the trial court announced its order in October 2003, he admonished Malmquist\r\nfor his method of handling disputes by resorting to either physical discipline or the sheriff's\r\ndepartment.  He then said to Moe that </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>[t]he mental, cruel and harmful abuse that you have inflicted over these children is\r\nmuch more severe and much more life damaging than a slap in the face.

Moe failed to\r\nestablish by a preponderance of the evidence that it would be injurious to the children to maintain\r\nMalmquist in this position or that it would be an improvement to appoint Moe as the children's sole\r\nmanaging conservator.  <em>See Eason</em>, 860 S.W.2d at 190.  She also failed to show on appeal that the\r\ntrial court acted in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner, or without reference to guiding principals\r\nof law.  <em>See Coleman</em>, 109 S.W.3d at 110.

The judgment must state in clear and\r\nunambiguous terms what is required for the conservator to comply, and the terms must be specific\r\nenough to allow the conservator to enforce the judgment by contempt.  <em>In re A.P.S.,</em> 54 S.W.3d  at\r\n498; <em>Roosth</em>, 889 S.W.2d at 452; <em>see also In re Walters</em>, 39 S.W.3d at 288.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs in her first issue, Moe relies on a Chapter 153 presumption to support her second\r\nissue, claiming that she is entitled to the standard possession order.  <em>See</em> Tex. Fam. Code Ann.\r\n§ 153.137 (West Supp. 2004-05) (standard possession order constitutes presumptive minimum\r\namount of possession for parent named as joint managing conservator who is not awarded right to\r\nestablish children's primary residence).  But the supreme court has held that the presumptions in\r\nChapter 153 are only applicable in original custody cases, not in modification proceedings such as\r\nthis one, which are governed by Chapter 156.  <em>In re V.L.K.</em>, 24 S.W.3d at 343.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court was afforded broad discretion in establishing the terms of\r\nconservatorship and it was not obligated to order standard possession.  <em>In re Walters</em>, 39 S.W.3d at\r\n286.  Moreover, the court explained on the record why the standard possession order was not initially\r\nappropriate in this case<sup> (10)</sup> and it structured the order so that, within six months from the date of the\r\norder, Moe would be entitled to standard possession, assuming she had established and continued\r\ntreatment with Dr. Lowry.  Thus, Moe's claim that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding\r\nher less than the standard possession order is without merit, and her second issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoe's only argument with regard to her third issue--that the trial court erred by not\r\ngiving her specific, enforceable periods of possession--is that \"[i]t has been repeatedly held that\r\ndenials of specific periods of visitation should only be ordered in the most extreme of\r\ncircumstances.\"  <em>See</em> <em>Roosth,</em> 889 S.W.2d at 451.  While we agree with this proposition, it does not\r\nsupport Moe's claim because, in conditioning Moe's rights on her continued therapy, she was not\r\ndenied specific, enforceable periods of possession.  To the contrary, the court's order sets forth very\r\nspecific terms of her possession and access rights.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe June 2004 order stated that Moe had to (1) begin treatment with Dr. Lowry, (2)\r\nnotify all the parties of such compliance, and (3) continue that treatment for thirty days.  At that\r\npoint, she was entitled to supervised visitation at Kids Exchange on specified dates and to telephone\r\ncontact with the children.  Thereafter, beginning in August 2004, as long as she continued treatment\r\nwith Dr. Lowry, Moe was entitled to increased periods of possession and access--with very specific\r\ntimes, dates, and locations provided for--culminating in a December 2004 return to standard\r\npossession.  Accordingly, the terms of what Moe was required to do in order to obtain and enhance\r\nher rights of possession and access were unambiguous, specific, and enforceable.  Moreover, the\r\nfamily code expressly grants trial courts authority to order that conservators \"participate in\r\ncounseling with a mental health professional.\"  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.010(a) (West 2002). \r\nThe trial court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion by conditioning Moe's rights on her continued\r\ntherapy with Dr. Lowry.  Her third issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, Moe challenges the conservatorship arrangement on the grounds that it\r\npermitted Dr. Lowry and the children's therapist to order that a particular period of possession not\r\noccur if the therapists mutually agreed that it would not be in the children's best interest and stated\r\nso in writing.  She asserts that this order poses the threat that the therapists could cause a <em>de facto\r\n</em>termination of her parental rights by agreeing that it would be in the children's best interest for Moe\r\nto be denied all periods of possession and access; she urges that giving them the ability to deny her\r\nall possession of and access to her children, without any court intervention, violates her\r\nconstitutional rights as a parent,<em> see In re M.S.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1880763\"><a href=\"/opinion/1880763/in-re-ms/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span>, 547 (Tex. 2003), and constitutes\r\nan impermissible delegation of the trial court's authority to make judicial determinations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe first address Moe's claim that the order empowered the therapists to prevent her\r\nfrom \"ever again see[ing] her own minor children.\"  In raising this issue, Moe overlooks the\r\nsignificant distinction between the terms \"possession\" and \"access.\"  Although the terms are\r\nsometimes used interchangeably, they represent two different concepts in the family code.  <em>In re\r\nWalters</em>, 39 S.W.3d at 284.  The right of access permits a conservator to approach, communicate,\r\nand visit with the child, whereas the right of possession allows the conservator to exercise control\r\nover the child to the exclusion of all others during a specified period.  <em>Id</em>.  Here, the order empowered\r\nthe therapists to deny Moe only a period of possession, not access.<sup> (11)</sup>  Moe holds the key to that\r\nability by attending her therapy sessions with Dr. Lowry: As long as Moe continues her treatment\r\nwith Dr. Lowry, then she is, at a minimum, permitted access to or visitation with her children.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn light of the evidence that Moe had caused mental and emotional damage to her\r\nchildren over the last decade, it was reasonable for the trial court to determine that limitations needed\r\nto be placed on her rights of possession.  Furthermore, the limitation it imposed sufficiently\r\nsafeguarded against a <em>de facto </em>termination of Moe's rights (1) by requiring that the therapists agree\r\nto deny a period of possession and that they state their agreement in writing, (2) by limiting their\r\nright to deny possession to one particular period at a time, and (3) by permitting them to deny Moe\r\npossession, not access.  Because the trial court placed restrictions only on Moe's rights of possession,\r\nrather than denying her all rights of possession and access, her constitutional rights are not\r\nimplicated by the June 2004 order.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe question remains, however, whether it was a proper exercise of the court's\r\ndiscretion to delegate authority over Moe's rights of possession to the therapists.  Although we are\r\naware of no other court that has addressed the issue of whether a conservator's right to possess a\r\nchild may be contingent on a mental therapist's approval, other courts have addressed whether it is\r\nappropriate to leave that determination within the discretion of another conservator.<sup> (12)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Hill</em>, the First Court of Appeals held that the trial court abused its discretion by\r\nmaking the father's right to visit his children contingent upon securing the written permission of their\r\nmother, the managing conservator.  404 S.W.2d at 643; <em>see also Wright v. Wentzel</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2468504\"><a href=\"/opinion/2468504/wright-v-wentzel/\"><span class=\"volume\">749</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>,\r\n234 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1988, no writ) (trial court erred by making mother's visitation\r\nrights contingent on father's consent).  In <em>Roosth</em>, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals similarly reversed\r\nan order that gave the mother \"complete discretion to determine when, where, and if [the father] may\r\nhave possession of or access to the children,\" because this grant of \"absolute discretion\" to the\r\nmother denied the father an ability to enforce the judgment by contempt.  889 S.W.2d at 452.  The\r\nTexarkana Court of Appeals also reversed an order that conditioned the mother's possession rights\r\non the father's agreement because it was \"not sufficiently specific.\"  <em>In re Walters</em>, 39 S.W.3d at 288;\r\n<em>see also In re A.P.S.</em>, 54 S.W.3d at 498 (trial court abused discretion in ordering that mother was\r\nentitled to possession \"at reasonable times and places as determined by [father]\" because it gave\r\nfather complete discretion over mother's rights and denied mother ability to enforce order by\r\ncontempt).<sup> (13)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThese cases, however, are distinguishable from the instant one in two, significant\r\nrespects.  First, the conflict that results from allowing one conservator to have absolute discretion\r\nover the other conservator's rights is readily apparent because it gives an adverse party the right to\r\ncompletely deny possession and/or access to the other.  Here, that is not the case because the\r\ndecision-makers, the therapists, are presumably neutral third parties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSecond, the orders in the above-mentioned cases did not sufficiently specify the terms\r\nupon which the decision-maker could deny the conservator's possession or visitation rights.  Instead,\r\nthe orders simply stated that possession could not occur unless the conservator obtained the other's\r\n\"written permission,\" <em>Hill</em>, 404 S.W.2d at 643, \"consent,\" <em>Wright</em>, 749 S.W.2d at 234, or \"mutual\r\nagreement,\"<em> In re Walters</em>, 39 S.W.3d at 288.  Thus, in these cases, absolute, unconditional discretion\r\nwas granted over the conservator's rights of possession and access.  Here, on the other hand, the\r\ntherapists were not permitted to deny Moe a single period of possession without first reaching a\r\nmutual, written agreement that it was in the children's best interest to do so.  This is in accord with\r\nwhat the family code requires a trial court to find prior to denying conservatorship rights.   <em>See</em> Tex.\r\nFam. Code Ann. § 153.002.  While it may not be appropriate in all cases for the trial court to\r\ndelegate such authority to third parties, here the decision-makers were mental health professionals\r\nappointed by the court, and the trial court maintained the power to review their decisions if\r\nchallenged by the parties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe terms of this order are sufficiently specific so as to be enforceable by contempt,\r\nand the trial court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in granting the therapists the right to deny\r\nMoe a specific period of possession if they mutually agreed it was in the best interest of the children. \r\nMoe's fourth issue is overruled.<sup> (14)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>ATTORNEY'S FEES</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe final order issued in June 2004 awarded attorney's fees against Moe and the\r\ngrandparents, jointly and severally, in the following amounts: $15,000 for Laurie Nowlin, the\r\nattorney ad litem, and $20,000 for John Barrett, Malmquist's attorney.<sup> (15)</sup>  The June order was\r\nconfined to the attorneys' work during the trial phase and did not mention any appellate fees. \r\nMalmquist, therefore, filed a motion to reform the judgment on July 20, 2004, seeking an attorney's\r\nfee award of $20,000, should Moe and/or the grandparents appeal.

At a hearing on July 23, 2004, the trial court denied Moe's motion, announced it would\r\naward Malmquist's attorney $5,000 in appellate fees, and asked that an order be prepared to reflect\r\nthat pronouncement.  The only written memorialization appearing in the record of the July\r\npronouncement, however, is a reformed final order issued on October 18, 2004,<sup> (16)</sup> which was after\r\nthe trial court's plenary power expired.  <em>See</em> Tex.

App.--Dallas 2005, no pet.).  There is no abuse of discretion where an award\r\nof attorney's fees is supported by the evidence.  <em>Id</em>. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoe's only argument in support of her claim that the trial court abused its discretion\r\nby awarding attorney's fees against her<sup> (17)</sup> is that her allegations that Malmquist \"batter[ed] the\r\nchildren and [her] allegations of child abuse were not only brought in good faith but were proven to\r\nbe absolutely true.\"  As discussed in relation to the conservatorship issues, the evidence did not\r\ncorroborate Moe's allegations of abuse, but instead was sufficient to support the trial court's finding\r\nthat Malmquist had not engaged in a pattern or history of abuse towards L.M.M. or S.D.M. \r\nAccordingly, this claim does not demonstrate an abuse of discretion on behalf of the trial court. \r\nMoe's fifth issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHarold and Irene, on the other hand, assert several grounds for their claim that the\r\ntrial court abused its discretion in awarding attorney's fees against them in favor of the ad litem and\r\nMalmquist's attorney.  They urge that these awards constitute impermissible sanctions levied against\r\nthem in an attempt to collect fees owed by their apparently insolvent daughter,<sup> (18)</sup> which are designed\r\nto punish them for helping her financially<sup> (19)</sup> and to discourage them from being involved in further\r\nlitigation regarding the custody of their grandchildren.  Harold and Irene also urge that the awards\r\nwere an abuse of discretion because the ad litem and Malmquist's attorney failed to segregate their\r\nfees among Moe and them and between different proceedings, actions, and motions; they urge that\r\nthey should not be responsible for any fees incurred prior to August 26, 2003, the date they\r\nintervened.  Finally, the grandparents challenge the award of the ad litem's fees against them on the\r\ngrounds that there is no evidence or insufficient evidence that their conduct made the appointment\r\nof the ad litem necessary.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em></em></span><span><em>\tAttorney's fees as sanctions</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tHarold and Irene's argument that the attorney's fees were assessed against them as\r\nan impermissible sanction is without merit because the trial court did not award the attorney's fees\r\nas sanctions.  The court denied Malmquist's motion to enter a monetary sanction against Harold and\r\nIrene<sup> (20)</sup> and stated that these fees were awarded against them \"[p]ursuant to Section 106.002 of the\r\nTexas Family Code . . . as reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and expenses.\"  Thus, rather than\r\nconstituting an award of sanctions for any fees that accrued or any conduct that occurred in prior\r\nlitigation, the attorney's fees awarded in the June 2004 order are merely a judgment to collect the\r\nfees that accrued in the current phase of litigation, which was initiated by Moe and in which the\r\ngrandparents intervened.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHarold and Irene do not dispute that they were a party to the instant case, and they do\r\nnot challenge that the fee amounts awarded to either Malmquist's attorney or the ad litem were\r\nunreasonable or unnecessary.  Instead, they only dispute their responsibility for the fees by claiming\r\nthat the record demonstrates no evidence or insufficient evidence to find that they have aided,\r\nabetted, encouraged, or conspired with Moe in the litigation, or that their actions have been frivolous\r\nor in bad faith.  Because these fees were not entered as sanctions, however, there is no need for\r\nevidence of conspiracy or bad faith on their behalf.  Rather, to affirm the award, there need only be\r\nsufficient evidence in the record upon which the trial court could determine the award was\r\n\"reasonable.\"  In a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, this is the only statutorily-defined\r\nrequirement and trial courts are otherwise afforded broad discretion in determining the propriety of\r\nan attorney's fees award.  <em>See</em> Tex. Fam. Code. Ann. § 106.002.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence are factors to be considered in\r\nwhether the trial court abused its discretion, but they are not independent grounds of error.  <em>Doyle\r\nv.

In reviewing the legal sufficiency\r\nof the evidence, we consider the evidence in a light most favorable to the finding to determine\r\nwhether a reasonable trier of fact could have formed a firm belief or conviction that its finding was\r\ntrue and we must disregard all evidence that a reasonable factfinder could have disbelieved or found\r\nto have been incredible.  <em>In re J.L.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894654\"><a href=\"/opinion/894654/in-re-jl/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 85 (Tex. 2005).  \"Under traditional factual\r\nsufficiency standards, a court determines if a finding is so against the great weight and\r\npreponderance of the evidence that it is manifestly unjust, shocks the conscience, or clearly\r\ndemonstrates bias.\"  <em>In re J.F.C.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1377577\"><a href=\"/opinion/1377577/in-re-jfc/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span>, 264 (Tex. 2002). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough the grandparents claimed to be adverse to Moe in the current litigation, their\r\ntestimony revealed otherwise.  When asked what Moe had done wrong as a parent, Harold testified\r\nthat \"the only thing I can think of [is] talking about their father and stuff like that in front of the\r\nkids.\"  He was asked this question several times, but offered nothing further.  The trial court\r\nexpressed surprise that, although \"given five opportunities,\" Harold failed to mention either the tape-recorder incident involving S.D.M. or the school incident, where Moe screamed at and belittled\r\nL.M.M.  Irene testified that she did not believe Moe posed a psychological danger to the children,\r\nthat Moe's visits with the children did not need to be supervised, and that the court's limitations on\r\nMoe's rights were imposed as punishment.  Moe's sister agreed that \"the goal that [she, Moe, the\r\ngrandparents], and other family members have had for the last eight years is to have custody of these\r\nchildren removed from [Malmquist] and restored to [Moe].\"  The other evidence concerning whether\r\nthe grandparents encouraged Moe's previous litigation through their financial support is irrelevant\r\nto this issue because the fees awarded in the June 2004 order only pertain to the attorneys' work in\r\nthe current action, which was brought by Moe and to which the grandparents were a party.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause there is legally sufficient, credible evidence on which the trial court could\r\ndetermine that the grandparents were aligned with Moe in the current litigation and because the fees\r\nwere not awarded as sanctions, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to determine that\r\nit was \"reasonable\" for Harold and Irene to be held jointly and severally responsible for the resulting\r\nattorney's fees accrued by Malmquist's attorney and the ad litem. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\tFailure to segregate fees</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHarold and Irene also challenge the attorney's fees award on the grounds that the\r\nattorneys failed to segregate their fees as between Moe and themselves<sup> (21)</sup> or between various\r\nproceedings, actions, and motions.  They urge that it was an abuse of discretion to hold them\r\nresponsible for any fees that accrued prior to their intervention into the lawsuit on August 26, 2003.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause Harold and Irene do not cite any authority in support of their claim that the\r\nattorney's fees were unreasonable unless segregated, this issue is waived.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 38.1\r\n(appellant's brief must contain \"a clear and concise argument . . . with appropriate citations to\r\nauthorities).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFurthermore, Harold and Irene do not appear to have otherwise preserved error on the\r\nissue of whether the trial court abused its discretion by awarding unsegregated fees against them. <em>\r\nSee</em> Tex. R. App. P. 33.1 (to preserve appellate issue, party must present timely, specific objection,\r\nrequest, or motion and obtain ruling or refusal to rule from trial court); <em>Villasenor v.

App.--San Antonio 1995, no writ) (complaint about failure to segregate\r\nattorney's fees was waived because not raised in open court or specifically in motion for new trial). \r\nWhen the ad litem offered testimony of her attorney's fees and an exhibit in support of them, the\r\ngrandparents did not object on any ground, including the failure to segregate fees.  On cross-examination of the ad litem, their counsel elicited testimony that, since the grandparents'\r\nintervention, the ad litem had accrued about $37,000 in fees, about $15,000 of which pertained to\r\nthe motion to modify.  This evidence supports the trial court's award of $15,000 in favor of the ad\r\nlitem, jointly and severally against Moe and the grandparents, because that is the amount she testified\r\nhad accrued since their intervention on the issue relevant to their motion--the modification of\r\nconservatorship.  Likewise, when Malmquist's attorney testified to his fees, the grandparents did not\r\nobject.  Malmquist's attorney stated in response to their cross-examination that he was owed over\r\n$30,000 for the current litigation.  Although he did concede that this amount covered the entire\r\nproceeding, beginning with Moe's motion filed a year before the grandparents intervened, the\r\ngrandparents never argued to the trial court that the fees should be segregated on this basis.  And,\r\nin any event, the trial court only assessed $20,000 in favor of Malmquist's attorney against Moe and\r\nthe grandparents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFollowing both the ad litem's and Malmquist's attorney's presentation of fees, the\r\nonly arguments made by Harold and Irene on the issue of attorney's fees were (1) that \"[Malmquist]\r\ndoesn't need to be rewarded. . . .  Because if that happens, he's going to be king of the world, and\r\nhe's got empowerment problems and problems using his power and his authority\" and (2) that\r\ninterest should not be assessed on the awards.  These arguments do not speak to whether it was error\r\nto not segregate the fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the July 23, 2003, hearing on the motion for reconsideration of the June 2004\r\norder, Moe's attorney stated that \"the Court has no authority to assess attorney's fees or costs against\r\n[Harold and Irene],\" to which the trial court asked, \"Do you represent [the grandparents]?,\" and she\r\nresponded, \"No, not at this time.\"  The court said, \"then I don't want to hear any argument about\r\nthat. . . .  [L]et [their counsel] address that.\"  Thereafter, the grandparents' attorney stated that \"my\r\ninstructions from [Harold and Irene] with regard to the motion for reconsideration are to be neutral\r\nabout it, let the Court make whatever decisions it makes. . . .  [T]hat's all I have to say about the\r\nmotion for reconsideration.\"  The trial court then ruled, stating that \"the motion for reconsideration\r\nis, in all respects, denied.\"  Although Harold and Irene subsequently asserted the failure to segregate\r\nas an error in a motion for new trial on July 26, 2004, this came after their counsel waived any error\r\nat the hearing. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn any event, when non-parents intervene in suits affecting the parent-child\r\nrelationship, those parties are equally subject to having attorney's fees assessed against them, and\r\nthere is no requirement that the fees be segregated between the parental and non-parental parties.<em> \r\nSee</em> <em>Garner v.

Here, all issues raised in the underlying\r\nlitigation--whether concerning the requests to modify conservatorship or the requests to hold Moe\r\nand Malmquist in contempt for violating court orders--centered on what should be done in the\r\nchildren's best interest and were, therefore, dependent on the same facts--those concerning the\r\nparents' actions and what the best home environment would be for the children.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGiven the grandparents' failure to cite supporting authority, their failure to raise the\r\nissue before the trial court, and the existence of authority contrary to their position, the trial court did\r\nnot abuse its discretion in finding that it was reasonable to award the attorney's fees against Moe and\r\nthe grandparents, jointly and severally, without segregation of those fees. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em></em></span><span><em>\tAd litem's fees</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tHarold and Irene's final ground for complaining that the trial court abused its\r\ndiscretion in assessing attorney's fees against them, jointly and severally with Moe, is that they\r\nshould not be responsible for any of the ad litem's fees because they did nothing to necessitate the\r\nad litem's appointment or continued involvement.  While we agree that an ad litem's fees should not\r\nbe taxed against a party who was not responsible for any of those fees being incurred, <em>see Dawson\r\nv.

App.--Dallas 1984, no writ), we disagree with the\r\ngrandparents' contention that they have no such responsibility in this case.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe ad litem's purpose was to represent the children's best interests, which included\r\nher work to determine who should be appointed and/or maintained as a conservator for the children. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 107.021 (West Supp. 2004-05).  The grandparents intervened, seeking\r\nappointment as the children's sole and/or joint managing conservators, thereby contributing to the\r\nneed for the ad litem's continued involvement in the case.  The grandparents' intervention required\r\nadditional preparation and time on the ad litem's behalf, such as her having to organize a home study\r\nfor the grandparents and having to prepare cross-examinations of them and the multiple witnesses\r\nthey called on their behalf.  Although the grandparents were not acting in bad faith, that is not a\r\nrequirement in order to hold them responsible for a portion of the ad litem's fees.  <em>See Dawson</em>, 666\r\nS.W.2d at 265.  Moreover, as discussed in relation to the segregation of fees, the ad litem's testimony\r\ndemonstrates that the only fees assessed in her favor against Harold and Irene were those that\r\naccrued following their intervention and in relation to their issue--the modification of\r\nconservatorship.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis case is distinguishable from <em>Minns v. Minns</em>, which held it was an abuse of\r\ndiscretion for the ad litem's fees to be assessed, jointly and severally, against the father and the\r\npaternal grandmother, who intervened asking to be named as a possessory conservator with visitation\r\nrights.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2449583\"><a href=\"/opinion/2449583/minns-v-minns/\"><span class=\"volume\">615</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></a></span>, 897-98 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1981, writ dism'd).  The holding\r\nin <em>Minns </em>was based on the court's determination that the grandmother was a \"successful\" party\r\nbecause she was granted the relief requested in her petition.  <em>Id</em>. at 898 (citing Tex. R. Civ. P. 131\r\n(successful party to a suit shall recover costs from adversary)).  Unlike the grandmother in <em>Minns</em>,\r\nhere the grandparents were ultimately not successful, given that they were not appointed sole or joint\r\nmanaging conservatorship as requested in their petition.  Based on this and on the facts that they\r\ncontributed to the ad litem's work and that the trial court only assessed the portion of the ad litem's\r\nfees that accrued after their involvement and in relation to their issue, it was reasonable for the trial\r\ncourt to hold Harold and Irene responsible for part of the ad litem's fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney's fees in favor of\r\nMalmquist's attorney and the ad litem, against the grandparents and Moe, jointly and severally, on\r\nthe grounds that the fees constituted an impermissible sanction, that the fees should have been\r\nsegregated, or that the grandparents did not contribute to the need for the ad litem.  Harold and\r\nIrene's second and third issues are overruled.<strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>Family Code section 261.106</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn Moe's sixth issue and in the grandparents' fourth<sup> (22)</sup> issue, they assert that it violated\r\nsection 261.106 of the family code to award attorney's fees against them because they are \"immune\"\r\nfrom the imposition of the fees based on their \"good faith . . . participat[ion] in a judicial proceeding\r\narising from a report, petition, or investigation of alleged child abuse.\"  Tex. Fam. Code Ann.\r\n§ 261.106 (West 2002).  Moe and the grandparents urge that, because they supported their requests\r\nto be awarded conservatorship over Malmquist with allegations that Malmquist abused the children,\r\nthey should be immunized from paying any attorney's fees incurred in litigating this custody battle. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNeither Moe nor the grandparents, however, once mentioned this statute or claimed\r\nimmunity before the trial court, even in Moe's <em>Motion for Reconsideration of Award of Attorney's\r\nFees </em>or in the grandparents' <em>Motion for New Trial</em>, which was dedicated solely to the challenge of\r\nthe attorney's fees.  Therefore, error was not preserved on this issue.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 33.1.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn any event, the immunity prescribed by section 261.106 would not protect Moe or\r\nthe grandparents here because this litigation primarily concerned the modification of a custody order;\r\nit was not a \"child abuse case.\"  \"The clear import of the progression of the [duty-to-report] statutes\r\nis that the legislature intended to protect reporters of child abuse from <em>liability for the act of\r\nreporting the abuse itself</em>, not from civil or criminal liability generally.<em>  State v.

L.M.M., the daughter, turned sixteen in April 2005, and S.D.M., the son, will be fifteen in\r\nSeptember 2005. \r\n</p><p>2.   We will refer to the mother as \"Moe\" and the grandparents as \"Harold and Irene\" or \"the\r\ngrandparents.\"\r\n</p><p>3.   The record presents some confusion over the exact modifications sought by Moe.  On its\r\nface, her <em>Second Amended Petition to Modify Parent-Child Relationship </em>makes no mention of a\r\nrequest to be appointed as the children's sole managing conservator, and such a request was likewise\r\nnot made in her prior motions to modify.  Instead, her petition makes a series of allegations about\r\nMalmquist's behavior with the children--that he would drink and drive, make disparaging comments\r\nabout Moe, and abuse the children emotionally and physically--and requests that she be given the\r\nright to determine S.D.M.'s primary residence.  Also, Moe testified that she wanted L.M.M. to live\r\nwith Malmquist and S.D.M. to live with her.  Nevertheless, the court and other parties refer to Moe's\r\npetition as a request that she be appointed sole managing conservator of the children.  For example,\r\nin its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the trial court specifically found that Moe's \"request\r\nto be appointed as sole managing conservator of [L.M.M. and S.D.M.] is not in the best interest of\r\n[the children].\"  And, in his brief, Malmquist cites to Moe's petition as a \"request that she be named\r\nas sole managing conservator of the children.\"  Although it does not appear that Moe asserted this\r\nrequest within the four corners of her petition, for the purpose of this appeal, we will assume that a\r\nrequest by Moe to be the children's sole managing conservator was properly before the trial court.\r\n</p><p>4.   At the conclusion of the October 2003 hearings, the children were temporarily placed at\r\nthe Texas Baptist Children's Home, by agreement of the parties, until a better solution could be\r\nfound.  On October 30, 2003, the court ordered that, until the March 2004 review hearing, Malmquist\r\nwould retain the right to establish the children's residence, but the location was limited to the\r\ngrandparents' home, and that Malmquist would have possession on the first, third and fifth\r\nweekends, as well as the winter holidays, while Moe was to have only supervised visits twice a\r\nmonth at Kids Exchange once she completed her contempt sentence and began treatment with a\r\ntherapist.\r\n</p><p>5.   Those specific terms were set forth in an attachment to the June 2004 order.\r\n</p><p>6.   Several witnesses testified about this episode, including Malmquist, police officers, the\r\nchildren's therapist, school counselors, and S.D.M.\r\n</p><p>7.   This included conducting individual, in camera interviews with both L.M.M. and S.D.M.\r\nBecause their living arrangement preferences are not binding on the trial court, <em>see</em> Tex. Fam. Code\r\nAnn. § 153.009 (West 2002), and we respect the need for confidentiality of this sensitive testimony,\r\ntheir stated preferences will not be repeated here.  We presume the trial court considered this\r\ntestimony, along with all of the other evidence, and afforded it appropriate weight when determining\r\nwhat was in the best interest of the children.  <em>See Gillespie v. Gillespie</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2456313\"><a href=\"/opinion/2456313/gillespie-v-gillespie/\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span>, 450-51\r\n(Tex. 1982). \r\n</p><p>8.   On appeal, no party asserts that the grandparents should have been appointed as\r\nconservators of the children.\r\n</p><p>9.   On April 21, 2004, Dr. Lowry wrote a letter to the court stating, \"I believe she can be\r\ntrusted with standard visitation.\"\r\n</p><p>10.   The court stated that Moe \"has had opportunities prior to the hearing in October, as far\r\nback as almost 10 years, to go to the counseling. . . .  And she has continually and willfully refused\r\nto do it, and I'm not going to make it any more convenient for her now.  It's Dr. Lowry, and she can\r\neither go or she cannot go. . . .  But the gate to visitation, [Moe] has the key.\"\r\n</p><p>11.   The trial court's order specifically stated that, upon the therapists' written agreement that\r\n\"any specific period of <em>possession</em> is not in the children's best interest, . . . that period of <em>possession</em>\r\nis ordered [to] not occur.\" (Emphasis added.)\r\n</p><p>12.   <em>See In re R.D.Y.</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></span> (Tex. 2002) (Justice Hecht writing that petition for review\r\nshould be granted because courts of appeals disagree about whether it is permissible to order that\r\nconservator's possession rights are \"solely at the discretion of a managing conservator,\" and listing\r\nrelevant opinions).\r\n</p><p>13.   Contrary to these cases, however, in <em>In re R.D.Y.</em>, the First Court of Appeals affirmed a\r\ntrial court's order that gave the grandmother \"sole discretion\" over the mother's possession rights\r\nbased on the grandmother's determination of whether the mother was \"mentally and physically\r\ncapable of exercising her visitation with the child.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1579288\"><a href=\"/opinion/1579288/in-re-rdy/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 323 n.1, 324 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, pet. denied).  The court held this order was not an abuse of\r\ndiscretion because the mother could enforce it by filing a motion to modify if she felt the\r\ngrandmother was abusing her power to evaluate whether or not the mother was capable of exercising\r\nher visitation rights.  <em>Id</em>. at 324.  We agree with the Texarkana court's statement about<em> In re R.D.Y.\r\n</em>that, \"[a]lthough a judge can rightfully restrict the conditions of [visitation] . . ., we respectfully\r\ndisagree . . . that giving total discretion, unenforceable by contempt, to one conservator constitutes\r\na mere restriction on the conditions of visitation.\"  <em>In re A.P.S.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1677813\"><a href=\"/opinion/1677813/in-re-aps/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></a></span>, 499 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Texarkana 2001, no pet.).\r\n</p><p>14.   Moe states that her four issues regarding the conservatorship order constitute a challenge\r\nto twelve findings of fact issued by the trial court in relation to that order.  The record demonstrates\r\nsufficient evidence to support those findings.\r\n</p><p>15.   Malmquist was also ordered to pay the attorney ad litem $5,000, which he does not dispute\r\non appeal.\r\n</p><p>16.   The order stated that the appellate fees were awarded against Moe and the grandparents,\r\njointly and severally, in favor of John Barrett, and that the award was \"conditioned on the pursuit\r\nby any or all of said parties of an ultimately unsuccessful appeal.\"  It also provided for a remittitur\r\nof $5,000 to Moe and the grandparents, jointly and severally, \"if an appeal is not perfected.\"\r\n</p><p>17. \tMoe claims it was an abuse of discretion to assess \"any\" fees against her for Malmquist's\r\nattorney and to assess \"the greater portion of\" the fees against her for the ad litem.\r\n</p><p>18. \tThey believe the court awarded fees against them jointly and severally because\r\nMalmquist's attorney has been unable to collect a prior judgment against Moe (for $20,000 in fees)\r\nsince 1997. \r\n</p><p>19. \tIrene testified that, including the $2,500 worth of attorney's fees that they have paid for\r\nMoe in the current litigation, the total amount of attorney's fees they have paid on Moe's behalf is\r\napproximately $42,000, that Moe has paid very little of it back, and that they do not expect her to\r\nreimburse them.  She also testified that they purchased the mortgage on Moe's house in 2001; the\r\ntotal cost of the loan was $87,925.  Moe testified that Harold and Irene do not require her to pay rent. \r\n</p><p>20.   On October 21, 2003, Malmquist filed a motion seeking (1) a judgment of attorney's fees\r\nin favor of his attorney, jointly and severally against Moe and the grandparents, and (2) the entry of\r\na monetary sanction against Harold and Irene.  The June 2004 order stated that it considered all\r\nmotions before it, that the relief sought by Malmquist was denied in part and granted in part, and that\r\nall requested relief \"not expressly granted herein is denied.\"  The June order did not mention the\r\nsanctions sought by Malmquist and, therefore, it denied that relief.\r\n</p><p>21.   Harold and Irene additionally claim that Malmquist's attorney should have allocated the\r\nfees between the ad litem, in addition to Moe and themselves, and that the ad litem should have\r\nallocated her fees against Malmquist, in addition to Moe and themselves.  But since no fees were\r\nassessed against the ad litem, any failure to segregate fees to the ad litem is immaterial.  Further, a\r\nportion of the ad litem's fees were assessed separately against Malmquist, and so this argument is\r\nalso without merit.\r\n</p><p>22.   Although not designated as the grandparents' \"fourth\" issue, it was the sole issue asserted\r\nin their supplemental brief, following the three issues raised in their initial brief.\r\n</p><p>23.   Moe states that her fifth, sixth, and seventh issues regarding the attorneys constitute a\r\nchallenge to seven findings of fact issued by the trial court in relation to that order.  The record\r\ndemonstrates sufficient evidence to support those findings.</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
