S. C. S 1983. The suit arose from an\nincident that occurred in the Berks County Prison where\nFuentes was detained while awaiting sentencing on\noutstanding federal charges. Fuentes alleged a cause of\naction for excessive force under the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments, a substantive due process claim for cruel and\nunusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments, a procedural due process claim under the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Mr. Fuentes was granted in forma pauperis status, and counsel agreed\nto represent him pro bono. We express our appreciation for the service\ncounsel provided the court, and the quality of their advocacy on behalf\nof Mr. Fuentes.\n\n                               2\n\n\nFourteenth Amendment, and state law claims for assault\nand battery, and false imprisonment.2\n\nCross-motions for summary judgment were eventually\nfiled, and the Magistrate Judge to whom the matter had\nbeen assigned granted summary judgment in favor of the\nprison officials on Fuentes' substantive due process claim,\nbut denied summary judgment on the remaining claims.\nThose remaining claims then proceeded to trial, and a jury\nreturned a verdict in favor of the defendants. Fuentes' post-\ntrial motions were denied, and this appeal followed. 3 We will\naffirm.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nIn December of 1995, Fuentes was being housed in the\nbehavioral adjustment unit (\"BAU\") of the Berks County\nPrison awaiting sentencing on federal drug charges to\nwhich he had previously pled guilty. His cell was typical of\nthe cells in the BAU. It measured approximately 6 by 10\nfeet and contained only a sink, a toilet, and a cement slab.\n\nOn December 28, 1995, the inmates in the BAU were not\nallowed their one-hour exercise period outdoors because of\ninclement weather. Instead, they were individually released\nfrom their cells to exercise in the hallway immediately\noutside their respective cells. After another inmatefinished\nexercising, Fuentes began kicking his own cell door and\nyelling for a Correctional Officer (\"CO\"). 4 CO Konemann and\nCO Kleeman came to Fuentes' cell, and Fuentes complained\n\fthat another inmate had urinated into Fuentes' cell. Neither\nKonemann nor Kleeman saw any urine on Fuentes' cell\nfloor. However, Kleeman did notice some wetness on the\ndoor and the floor outside of Fuentes' cell.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Fuentes filed a pro se complaint on January 11, 1996. Thereafter, he\nwas granted ifp status and counsel was appointed to represent him. A\nfirst amended complaint was filed on February 28, 1997, and a second\namended complaint was filed on November 14, 1997.\n3. All parties consented to have the Magistrate Judge conduct the\nproceedings under 28 U. S. C. S 636(c)(1). Fuentes retained the right to\nappeal directly to us under 28 U. S. C. S 636(c)(3).\n\n4. Fuentes knew that kicking his cell door was a violation of the rules of\nthe BAU.\n\n                               3\n\n\nPolicy requires that a CO handcuff an inmate who is\nhoused in the disciplinary unit before entering his cell.\nAccordingly, Konemann and Kleeman told Fuentes to\nextend his hands through the food slot of his cell door so\nthat they could handcuff him and enter his cell. Fuentes\ncomplied, and was handcuffed. The COs entered and told\nFuentes they were going to strip his cell because he had\nkicked his cell door.5 However, as Konemann began\nremoving sheets from Fuentes' bed in an effort to strip the\ncell, Fuentes grabbed the sheets and a struggle ensued. The\nparties offer different versions of exactly what happened\nnext.\n\nAccording to the defendants, Fuentes swung at\nKonemann's head with his handcuffed fists after\nunsuccessfully trying to grab the sheets. Konemann stated\nhe saw Fuentes' swing, and that he pushed Fuentes\nbackwards. When Fuentes moved back toward Konemann,\nKleeman stepped forward and wrestled Fuentes to thefloor.\nFuentes was then face down on the cell floor with his\nhandcuffed arms beneath him. Kleeman was partially on\ntop of Fuentes as Konemann assisted in holding Fuentes\ndown. According to the defendants, Fuentes was combative\nand was trying to free himself as Konemann and Kleeman\ntried to control him.\n\nCO Donato arrived shortly after Konemann and Kleeman\nbegan stripping the cell, but Donato left to get leg shackles\nand to call for assistance. After Donato retrieved the leg\nshackles she returned with several other COs, and the\nshackles were fastened around Fuentes' legs. Sergeant\nBrown, a supervising CO, did not enter Fuentes' cell, but\nhe did hear Fuentes yelling at Kleeman and Konemann.\nDonato told Brown that Konemann and Kleeman had been\n\fstripping Fuentes' cell when Fuentes swung at Konemann.\nBrown then left to obtain permission to place Fuentes in a\nrestraint chair. Permission was granted by Assistant\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. Cell stripping is a procedure which may be used when an inmate is\ncausing a disturbance. It consists of removing from the cell all items\nexcept the clothes on the inmate's back, his legal papers and his\ntoothbrush. For the first violation, the cell is stripped for 24 hours.\nFor\n\neach subsequent infraction, an additional 24 hours is added.\n\n                               4\n\n\nWarden, who authorized use of the restraint chair for eight\nhours. Fuentes' civil rights claim is based upon the use of\nthat restraint chair and his allegation that Konemann and\nKleeman used excessive force during the initial\nconfrontation in his cell.6\n\nFuentes was no longer physically resisting when Brown\nreturned with permission to use the restraint chair.\nHowever, Kleeman and Konemann were still holding\nFuentes down, and Fuentes was threatening to \"get\"\nKonemann. Fuentes was then carried from his cell to a\nnearby cell where he was placed in the restraint chair. He\ndid not resist physically being placed in the chair, though\nhe did not cooperate.\n\nWith regard to the initial confrontation in Fuentes' cell,\nFuentes alleged that Konemann and Kleeman threw him to\nthe floor and beat him, and that Kleeman smeared his hand\nall over Fuentes' face. Fuentes denied trying to strike\nKonemann or threatening him. Fuentes insisted that he\nonly asked Kleeman and Konemann why they were hitting\nhim, and he claimed to have remained still from the time he\nwas beaten until the time he was placed in the restraint\nchair. Kleeman admitted that Fuentes was no longer a\nthreat to himself or anyone else once his hands were cuffed\nand his legs shackled. From the time Fuentes was removed\nfrom his cell to the time he was placed in the restraint\nchair, he was neither resisting nor physically combative.\nFuentes was not given an opportunity to explain or defend\nany of his actions prior to being placed in the chair.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. The restraint chair at Berks County Prison is the \"Pro-straint Violent\nPrisoner Chair.\" The back of the chair is angled back at a 45#DE# angle.\nAn\n\ninmate is placed in the chair with his arms handcuffed behind his back\nand his legs shackled. A restraint belt is fastened across the inmate's\n\flap, and two more restraint belts are placed across his chest while\nanother restraint belt secures his ankles. At Berks County Prison, it is\nstandard operating procedure to shackle an inmate's legs, as well as\ncuffing his wrists. The handcuffs that are used are double-locked so they\ncannot loosen or tighten more than when initially set. The prison has\nthree restraint chairs, and they are on wheels so that they can be moved\nbetween housing units. They are used in the female unit, the disciplinary\nunit and the mental health unit. The chairs are not used on general\npopulation inmates.\n\n                               5\n\n\nFuentes' confinement in the restraint chair was\nconsistent with the institution's policy. COs checked him at\nfifteen minute intervals and he was released every two\nhours for a ten minute period of stretching, exercise, and\nuse of the toilet. In addition, he was given a meal and seen\nby the medical staff at the end of the first two hour interval.\nThe parties disputed whether Fuentes made any verbal\nthreats during his first release period. Fuentes denied doing\nso, however, Konemann said that Fuentes was still\nthreatening him and saying that he would \"get\" Konemann\nwhen he got out on the street.\n\nDuring the second release period, which came at the end\nof four hours, Fuentes told Konemann \"he wasn't going to\nget away with it, that [Fuentes] was going to see him sooner\nor later . . . .\" Konemann interpreted this as a threat.\nHowever, Fuentes claimed that he only meant that he was\ngoing to sue Konemann.\n\nWhen the third release period arrived, Fuentes had\nstopped making threats. He was finally released at the end\nof eight hours and examined by a staff nurse, as dictated\nby policy. She noted that Fuentes complained of pain in his\nright lower rib cage, but she observed no injuries with the\nexception of small bruises or swelling on both wrists.\n\nOn December 29, 1995, Fuentes was brought before the\nprison disciplinary board for a hearing on charges of\nassault/fighting/horseplay, threats, refusal of orders, and\ndisturbance. He was given an opportunity to make a\nstatement. The assault charge was dismissed but the board\nfound him guilty of threats, refusal of orders and\ndisturbance. Sanctions in the form of loss of all earned time\ncredit and thirty days segregation were imposed.\n\nFuentes claimed that being in the restraint chair for eight\nhours resulted in loss of feeling in his hands and feet, cuts\non his wrists and ankles where he had been handcuffed\nand shackled, leg cramps, discomfort in his arms,\nrestricted breathing, and back pain.\n\fII. DISCUSSION\n\nFuentes argues that the Magistrate Judge erred by: (1)\ndenying his motion for judgment as a matter of law on his\n\n                                6\n\n\nprocedural due process claim; (2) granting summary\njudgment in favor of the defendants on his substantive due\nprocess claim; and (3) instructing the jury improperly on\nhis excessive force claim.\n\nA. The Procedural Due Process Claim.\n\nFuentes alleged that his eight hour confinement in the\nrestraint chair violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the\nUnited States Constitution. The Magistrate Judge denied\ncross-motions for summary judgment on the procedural\ndue process claim after finding that \"the evidence\ndemonstrates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\nMr. Fuentes was placed in the restraint chair for punitive\nreasons or security reasons. . . .\" Op. at 15. After the jury\nfound against him on his procedural due process claim,\nFuentes moved for judgment as a matter of law. However,\nthe Magistrate Judge denied that motion. Fuentes claims\nthat was error.\n\nWe exercise plenary review over the denial of a motion for\njudgment as a matter of law, and we apply the same\nstandard that the District Court should have used.\nLightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1166 (3d\nCir. 1993). A motion for judgment as a matter of law\n\"should be granted only if, viewing the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to the nonmovant . . . there is insufficient\nevidence from which a jury could reasonably find[for the\nnonmovant]. [We] may not weigh the evidence. . . The\nquestion is not whether there is literally no evidence\nsupporting the party against whom the motion is directed\nbut whether there is evidence upon which the jury could\nproperly find a verdict for that party.\" Id . A jury must\nresolve any factual conflicts, not a court. Bonjorno v. Kaiser\nAluminum & Chem. Corp., 752 F.2d 802, 811 (3d Cir.\n1985).\n\nWhen Fuentes was placed in the restraint chair he was a\nconvicted inmate awaiting sentencing. His status under the\nConstitution was therefore that of a pretrial detainee.7 In\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. Before the Magistrate Judge, the defendants conceded that for\npurposes of his S 1983 claim, Fuentes was to be regarded as a pretrial\n\n                                7\n\fCobb v. Aytch, 643 F.2d 946, 962 (3d Cir. 1981), we\nclarified the legal status of convicted, but unsentenced,\ninmates. We stated:\n\n       The trial judge, in fashioning relief, drew a distinction\n       between pretrial detainees and convicted but\n       unsentenced inmates. He concluded that `the\n       conviction alone appears to extinguish any `liberty'\n       interest formally derived from the fourteenth\n       amendment.' We disagree. The right to remain at liberty\n       continues until a court pronounces a judgment of\n       sentence, although after a jury has pronounced a guilty\n       verdict the court may insist upon greater assurance that\n       a defendant will submit to sentence.\n\n(emphasis added). Given Fuentes' status as a pretrial\ndetainee under the Fourteenth Amendment, he has\n\n       federally protected liberty interests that are different in\n       kind from those of sentenced inmates. Unlike\n       sentenced prisoners, who . . . must look to state law\n       for the protection of their personal liberties, pre-trial\n       detainees have liberty interests firmly grounded in\n       federal constitutional law.\n\nId. at 957.8\n\nOur analysis of Fuentes' procedural due process claim is\ngoverned by Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520 (1979).9 There,\nthe Supreme Court wrote:\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ndetainee. Op. at 9 n.17. In this appeal, the defendants argue that\nFuentes' status is the same as a sentenced inmate. See Appellees' Br. at\n13, 20. We reject that argument because it contravenes the concession\nmade before the Magistrate Judge, and because it is simply wrong. See\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 538 (1979).\n\n8. Fuentes' liberty interests are grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment\nbecause his allegations are against state actors as he was confined in a\ncounty prison.\n\n9. The defendants, although discussing Bell v. Wolfish, rely, in part, on\nSandin v. Conner, 515 U. S. 472 (1995), in support of their argument\nthat Fuentes was not punished without due process of law. In Sandin,\nthe Court held that liberty interests protected by the Due Process Clause\n\"will be generally limited to freedom from restraint which, while not\n\n                               8\n\n\n       [I]n evaluating the constitutionality of conditions or\n\f       restrictions of pretrial detention that implicate only the\n       protection against deprivation of liberty without due\n       process of law, we think the proper inquiry is whether\n       those conditions amount to punishment of the\n       detainee.\n\nId. at 535. \"[A] detainee may not be punished prior to an\nadjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of\nlaw.\" Id. However, \"[o]nce the Government has exercised its\nconceded authority to detain a person pending trial, it\nobviously is entitled to employ devices that are calculated\nto effectuate this detention.\" Id. at 537. Thus, \"[r]estraints\nthat are reasonably related to the institution's interest in\nmaintaining jail security do not, without more, constitute\nunconstitutional punishment, even if they are\ndiscomforting. . . .\" Id. at 540. Obviously, \"ensuring\nsecurity and order at the institution is a permissible\nnonpunitive objective, whether the facility houses pretrial\ndetainees, convicted inmates, or both.\" Id. at 561.\nConsequently, \"whether . . . restrictions and practices\nconstitute punishment in the constitutional sense depends\non whether they are rationally related to a legitimate\nnonpunitive government purpose and whether they appear\nexcessive in relation to that purpose.\" Id. Thus, there is a\n\"distinction between punitive measures that may not\nconstitutionally be imposed prior to a determination of guilt\nand regulatory restraints that may.\" Id.\n\n       [We] must decide whether the disability is imposed for\n       the purpose of punishment or whether it is but an\n       incident of some other legitimate governmental\n       purpose. Absent a showing of an expressed intent to\n       punish on the part of detention facility officials, that\n       determination generally will turn on whether an\n       alternative purpose to which [the restriction] may\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nexceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to\nprotection by the Due Process Clause in its own force, nonetheless\nimposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to\nthe ordinary incidents of prison life.\" 515 U. S. at 484. However, Sandin\ndoes not apply here. Sandin concerned punishment of a sentenced\nprisoner, and therefore required a completely different analysis.\n\n                               9\n\n\n       rationally be connected is assignable for it, and\n       whether it appears excessive in relation to the\n 659alternative purpose assigned [to it]. Thus, if a\n\n       particular condition or restriction of pretrial detention\n       is reasonably related to a legitimate governmental\n       objective, it does not, without more, amount to\n\f       `punishment.' Conversely, if a restriction or condition is\n       not reasonably related to a legitimate goal--if it is\n       arbitrary or purposeless--a court permissibly may infer\n       that the purpose of the governmental action is\n       punishment that may not constitutionally be inflicted\n       upon detainees qua detainees.\n\nId. at 538-39.\n\nFuentes has not clearly established that officials used the\nrestraint chair as a means of \"punishing\" (as opposed to\ncontrolling) him. Accordingly, we must determine if this\nparticular restriction, which may appear to be punitive, was\nreally an incident of a legitimate nonpunitive objective. Id.\nat 539 n.20. \"[A]bsent a showing of intent to punish, a\ncourt must determine if a particular restriction or\ncondition, which may on its face appear to be punishment,\nis instead but an incident of a legitimate nonpunitive\ngovernmental objective.\" Id. \"Retribution and deterrence are\nnot legitimate nonpunitive governmental objectives.\" Id.\n\nFuentes argues that \"a reasonable jury could only have\nconcluded that the defendants confined [him] in the\nrestraint chair -- and kept him there for eight long\nhours -- to punish him.\" Appellant's Br. at 38-39. He\ntherefore claims that the Magistrate Judge erred in denying\nhis motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n\nClearly, there is evidence in this record from which a\nreasonable jury could conclude that use of the restraint\nchair was punishment. Sergeant Brown testified that the\nchair is used in the disciplinary unit for behavior\nmodification purposes. Warden Wagner testified that the\nrestraint chair is used to abate an inmate's behavior, and\nthat it is used for behavior modification and control.\nPerhaps most significantly, he also testified that there is\nnothing the inmate can do to affect the amount of time he\nwill remain in the chair once the inmate is placed in it.\n\n                               10\n\n\nHowever, there is also evidence from which a reasonable\njury could conclude that Fuentes was placed in the\nrestraint chair to quell a disturbance and restore the order\nand security of the institution. Kleeman testified that the\nrestraint chair is used to handle an aggressive inmate who\nis causing harm to himself or others. Kleeman and\nKonemann both testified that Fuentes kicked his cell door\nand swung his handcuffed hands at Konemann's head.\nKonemann testified that although Fuentes was not\nphysically aggressive when released from the chair during\nthe first and second rest periods, Fuentes did continue to\nmake threats.\n\fGiven this conflicting evidence, we disagree with Fuentes'\ncontention that a reasonable jury could only conclude that\nuse of the chair was punitive. The evidence was sufficient\nto allow a jury to conclude that he was placed in the\nrestraint chair to stop his disruptive behavior and maintain\nprison order and security. Accordingly, the Magistrate\nJudge did not err in denying Fuentes' motion for judgment\nas a matter of law. \"Conflicting evidence which could\nreasonably lead to inconsistent conclusions will not justify\"\na judgment as a matter of law. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v.\nVidefreeze Corp., 540 F.2d 1171, 1178 (3d Cir. 1976). \"It is\nthe function of the trier of fact alone, the jury in this\ninstance, to evaluate the evidence and to draw inferences\ntherefrom.\" Id.\n\nB. The Substantive Due Process Claim.10\n\nFuentes alleged that the use of the restraint chair\nviolated his substantive due process rights under the\nFourteenth Amendment, and constituted cruel and unusual\npunishment under the Eighth Amendment as a matter of\nlaw. However, the basis of his claim is elusive. The\nMagistrate Judge concluded that Fuentes was claiming that\nthe use of the restraint chair is unconstitutional under any\ncircumstances under the Eighth Amendment. See Op. at 15\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. We exercise plenary review over the grant or denial of a motion for\nsummary judgment, applying the same standard that the district court\nshould have used in the first instance. Olson v. General Elec. Aerospace,\n101 F.3d 947, 951 (3d Cir. 1996).\n\n                               11\n\n\n(\"[Fuentes] contends that the use of the restraint chair as\na means of corporal punishment is `cruel and unusual' and\nviolates the Eighth Amendment.\"). However, in his brief to\nus, Fuentes conflates his substantive due process claim\ninto his procedural due process claim by arguing that the\ncentral issue with respect to both is whether the use of the\nchair constituted punishment. The appellees describe\nFuentes argument before us as follows:\n\n       [Fuentes] appears to now contend that the district\n       court should have considered only whether [he] was\n       punished, not whether the alleged punishment was\n       cruel and unusual. [Thus, Fuentes'] argument with\n       respect to the district court's ruling on [the substantive\n       due process claim] relating to claims of cruel and\n       unusual punishment is confusing at best.\n\nSee Appellees' Br. at 9.\n\fFuentes argues that the Magistrate Judge incorrectly\nanalyzed his substantive due process claim under the\nEighth Amendment rather than under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. He correctly asserts that his claim is governed\nby the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of due process,\nand not the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel\nand unusual punishment because he had not been\nsentenced when the incident occurred.11 Under the\nFourteenth Amendment, a pretrial detainee is entitled \"at a\nminimum, [to] no less protection\" than a sentenced inmate\nis entitled to under the Eighth Amendment. Colburn v.\nUpper Darby Township, 838 F.2d 663, 668 (3d Cir. 1988).\nFuentes claims that \"the district court never even\nconsidered the amount of additional substantive protection\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. \"The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was designed to\nprotect those convicted of crimes and consequently the Clause applies\nonly after the State has complied with the constitutional guarantees\ntraditionally associated with criminal prosecutions.\" Whitley v. Albers,\n475 U. S. 312, 318 (1986)(citation and internal quotations omitted).\nThus, its protections do not apply until \"after conviction and sentence.\"\nGraham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 392 n.6 (1989). The clause, and\nindeed the entire Eighth Amendment, is made applicable to the states\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment. Robinson v. California, 370 U. S.\n660 (1962).\n\n                               12\n\n\nto which [he] was entitled\" under the Fourteenth\nAmendment by virtue of his status as a pretrial detainee.\nAppellant's Br. at 18-19.\n\nIn Kost v. Kozakiewicz, 1 F.3d 176, 188 n.10 (3d Cir.\n1993), we noted that \"pretrial detainees. . . are entitled to\nat least as much protection as convicted prisoners, so the\nprotections of the Eighth Amendment would seem to\nestablish a floor of sorts. It appears that no determination\nhas as yet been made regarding how much more protection\nunconvicted prisoners should receive.\" Fuentes contends\nthat, as an unsentenced inmate, he was entitled to be free\nfrom any punishment. However, that very issue was before\nthe jury with respect to Fuentes' procedural due process\nclaim, and, as we have indicated, the jury's determination\nin favor of the defendants on that issue was supported by\nsufficient evidence. Accordingly, even if the Magistrate\nJudge had applied a Fourteenth Amendment standard,\nFuentes would not have prevailed at trial.\n\nThe Eighth Amendment protects against infliction of\n\"cruel and unusual punishment.\" However, \"not every\ngovernmental action affecting the interests or well-being of\n\fa prisoner is subject to Eighth Amendment scrutiny.\"\nWhitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312, 319 (1986).\"After\nincarceration, only the unnecessary and wanton infliction\nof pain constitutes cruel and unusual punishment\nforbidden by the Eighth Amendment.\" Id. (citation and\ninternal quotations omitted). \"It is obduracy and\nwantonness, not inadvertence or error in good faith, that\ncharacterize the conduct prohibited by the Cruel and\nUnusual Punishments Clause, whether that conduct occurs\nin connection with establishing conditions of confinement,\nsupplying medical needs, or restoring official control over a\ntumultuous cellblock.\" Id.\n\nResolution of an Eighth Amendment claim therefore\n\"mandate[s] an inquiry into a prison official's state of\nmind.\" Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294, 299 (1991). Two\nconsiderations define that inquiry. We must first determine\nif the deprivation was sufficiently serious to fall within the\nEighth Amendment's zone of protections. Id. at 298. If not,\nour inquiry is at an end. However, if the deprivation is\nsufficiently serious, we must determine if the officials acted\n\n                               13\n\n\nwith a sufficiently culpable state of mind. Id . In other\nwords, we must determine if they were motivated by a\ndesire to inflict unnecessary and wanton pain.\"What is\nnecessary to establish an `unnecessary and wanton\ninfliction of pain'. . . varies according to the nature of the\nalleged constitutional violation.\" Hudson v. McMillian, 503\nU. S. 1, 5 (1992).\n\nWhen excessive force is alleged in the context of a prison\ndisturbance, the subjective inquiry is \"whether force was\napplied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore\ndiscipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\"\nId. at 7. The objective inquiry is whether the inmate's injury\nwas more than de minimis. Id. at 9-10.\n\nWhen an Eighth Amendment claim arises in the context\nof a challenge to conditions of confinement, we must\ndetermine if prison officials acted with \"deliberate\nindifference\" to the inmate's health. Farmer v. Brennan, 511\nU. S. 825, 837 (1994).12 The objective inquiry is whether the\ninmate was \"denied the minimal civilized measure of life's\nnecessities.\" Hudson, 503 U. S. at 9.\n\nFuentes contends that his substantive due process claim\ndoes not neatly fit into either the \"excessive force\" category\nor the \"conditions of confinement\" category. Nonetheless, he\nargues, not only that the Magistrate Judge erred by\ngranting summary judgment to the prison officials on his\nhybrid substantive due process claim, but also that he\n\fshould have been granted summary judgment on that\nclaim. He argues in the alternative that the claim should at\nleast have been submitted to the jury. We disagree.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. In Farmer v. Brennan, the Court finally defined \"deliberate\nindifference,\" which first appeared in Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97,\n104 (1976). The Court required a showing that the prison official was\n\"subjectively aware of the risk.\" 511 U. S. at 829. It wrote: \"We hold\n. . . that a prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth\nAmendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement\nunless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate\nhealth or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the\ninference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,\nand he must also draw the inference.\" Id. at 837.\n\n                               14\n\n\nFuentes' due process claim is limited to use of the\nrestraint chair. It does not encompass the force initially\nused to subdue him, or to place him in the chair.\nAccordingly, whether analyzed as an excessive force claim\nor a conditions of confinement claim, Fuentes had to\ndemonstrate that the prison officials had a \"sufficiently\nculpable state of mind,\" to establish that use of the\nrestraint violated the Eighth Amendment. It is obvious that\nprison officials were not \"deliberately indifferent\" to his\nhealth or well-being in employing the restraint chair, and a\nconditions of confinement analysis therefore requires little\ndiscussion.\n\nIt is undisputed that the prison policy for the use of the\nrestraint chair was followed here. Accordingly, Fuentes was\nnot kept in the chair any longer than had been authorized,\nhis physical condition was checked every 15 minutes, and\nhe was released every two hours for 10 minutes to allow\nstretching, exercise, and use of the toilet. He was given\nfood, and he was examined by a nurse at the end of the\neight hour confinement.13\n\nMoreover, even if we assume that the injuries Fuentes\nalleges were sufficiently serious to establish an Eighth\nAmendment violation, there is no evidence that prison\nofficials placed him in the chair \"maliciously and\nsadistically to cause harm.\" Fuentes argues that the prison\nofficials' conduct was malicious and sadistic because (1)\nthere was no need to use the restraint chair; (2) the\nrestraint chair was much too severe a response under the\ncircumstances; (3) the prison officials did not perceive him\nas an immediate threat when they placed him in the chair;\nand (4) the prison officials made no effort to temper the\nseverity of their response even though it was clear that he\nposed no threat to institutional security. Appellant's Br. at\n\f30. However, even if we concede each of these assertions,\nFuentes has established at most that prison officials over-\nreacted to the disturbance that he caused. Given the\ntotality of the circumstances surrounding use of the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. These same factors that establish that the prison officials were not\ndeliberately indifferent also establish that Fuentes was not \"denied the\nminimal civilized measure of life's necessities.\"\n\n                               15\n\n\nrestraint chair here, any such over-reaction would still fall\nshort of supporting a finding that prison officials acted\n\"maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\"\n\nConsequently, the Magistrate Judge did not err by\ngranting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on\nFuentes' substantive due process claim.\n\nC. The Jury Instructions on Excessive Force. 14\n\nFuentes alleged that Konemann and Kleeman used\nexcessive force in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nFuentes also alleged that Donato was liable because she\nobserved the use of excessive force and failed to intervene\nwith respect to the initial confrontation in his cell. Over\nFuentes' objection, the Magistrate Judge charged the jury\non excessive force as follows:\n\n       [P]laintiff must show by a preponderance of the\n       evidence, that one or more of the defendants inflicted\n       unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering. You must\n       decide whether the force applied was in a good faith\n       effort to maintain or restore discipline, in which case,\n       you must find that the defendants did not use\n       excessive force, or whether the force applies (sic) was\n       inspired by an unwise, excessive zeal, amounting to an\n       abuse of official power, that shocks the conscience, in\n       which case, you must find that one or more of the\n       defendants did use excessive force.\n\nFuentes argues that this charge \"compelled [him] to meet\na much higher burden than an unsentenced inmate is\nrequired to meet in order to prove an excessive force claim.\"\nAppellant's Br. at 47. He argues that the \"objective\nreasonableness\" instruction he proposed should have been\ngiven to the jury instead.15\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14. We exercise plenary review in determining whether jury instructions\nmisstated an applicable legal standard. Parks v. AlliedSignal, Inc., 113\nF.3d 1327, 1330 (3d Cir.1997).\n\f15. Fuentes' proposed excessive force jury instruction reads:\n\n       In order to prove that the defendants used excessive and\n       unnecessary force, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of\n\n                                16\n\n\nHowever, Fuentes was not entitled to an \"objective\nreasonableness\" instruction. The \"objective reasonableness\"\ntest has its constitutional foundation in the Fourth\nAmendment and is properly applied in excessive force\nclaims arising from investigatory stops and/or arrests.\nGraham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386 (1989). The Court in\nGraham specifically stated:\n\n       Our cases have not resolved the question of whether\n       the Fourth Amendment continues to provide\n       individuals with protection against the deliberate use of\n       force beyond the point at which arrest ends and\n       pretrial detention begins, and we do not attempt to\n       answer that question today. It is clear, however, that\n       the Due Process Clause protects a pretrial detainee from\n       the use of excessive force that amounts to punishment.\n\n490 U. S. at 395 n.10 (citations omitted)(emphasis added).\n\nOur conclusion that Fuentes was not entitled to an\n\"objective reasonableness\" instruction does not, however,\ncompletely meet Fuentes' claim of error. Fuentes' essential\npoint is that the instruction given to the jury was an Eighth\nAmendment excessive force instruction applicable to\nsentenced inmates and inapplicable to him. He argues that\nhis excessive force claim should have been analyzed under\nthe Bell v. Wolfish \"conditions of confinement\" standard\nbecause he was a pretrial detainee. He insists that he was\nnot required to prove that he experienced \"wanton pain and\nsuffering\" or to establish that the application of force upon\nhim \"was inspired by an unwise, excessive zeal, amounting\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       the evidence: (1) that the plaintiff suffered some harm, (2) that\nthe\n       harm resulted directly from the use of force that was clearly\n       excessive in relation to any need for the use of force, and (3)\nthat\nthe\n       excessiveness of the force was objectively unreasonable in light of\n       the facts and circumstances at the time.\n\n       Some of the factors you may consider in determining whether the\n       defendants used excessive force are: (1) the extent of the injury\n       suffered, (2) the need for the use of force, (3) the relationship\n\f       between that need and the amount of force used, (4) the threat\n       reasonably perceived by the prison guards involved; and (5) any\n       efforts made to temper the severity of the forceful response.\n\n                               17\n\n\nto an abuse of official power\" or to prove that the conduct\nof Konemann, Kleeman and Donato \"shocked the\nconscience.\"\n\nHowever, we agree with the contrary analysis in Valencia\nv. Wiggins, 981 F.2d 1440 (5th Cir. 1993). There, the court\nalso addressed a pretrial detainee's excessive force claim\nagainst a prison guard. The claim arose from a prison\ndisturbance. The court initially looked to Bell v. Wolfish for\nguidance in determining the standards to be applied.\nHowever, it found that Bell, while working\"well for claims\nof improper conditions or restrictions, . . . does not lend\nitself to analysis of claims of excessive force in controlling\nprison disturbances.\" Id. at 1446. The court reasoned:\n\n       In Bell, the Court stated that the government must be\n       able to take steps to maintain security and that\n       \"[r]estraints that are reasonably related to the\n       institution's interest in maintaining jail security do not,\n       without more, constitute unconstitutional punishment\n       . . . .\" Bell further noted that there is no reason to\n       distinguish between pretrial detainees and convicted\n       inmates in reviewing challenged security practices\n       because there is no basis to conclude that pretrial\n       detainees pose any lesser security risk than convicted\n       inmates.\n\n       For these reasons, we conclude that excessive use of\n       force claims by pretrial detainees should not be\n       analyzed under Bell's conditions of confinement\n       standard. Instead, we are guided by the standard\n       announced in Whitley and Hudson. While these cases\n       specifically addressed claims of excessive use of force\n       brought by convicted prisoners, it is impractical to\n       draw a line between convicted prisoners and pretrial\n       detainees for the purpose of maintaining jail security.\n       Moreover, the Court indicated in Hudson that many of\n       its concerns in Whitley were not limited to Eighth\n       Amendment claims but \"arise whenever guards use\n       force to keep order.\" It further observed that claims\n       based on excessive force and claims based on\n       conditions of confinement are different in kind.\n\n       Therefore, when a court is called upon to examine the\n       amount of force used on a pretrial detainee for the\n\n                               18\n\f       purpose of institutional security, the appropriate\n       analysis is that announced in Whitley and Hudson:\n       whether the measure taken inflicted unnecessary and\n       wanton pain and suffering depends on \"whether force\n       was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore\n       discipline, or maliciously and sadistically for the very\n       purpose of causing harm.\"\n\nId. Accordingly, we hold that the Eighth Amendment cruel\nand unusual punishments standards found in Whitley v.\nAlbers, 475 U. S. 312 (1986) and Hudson v. McMillian, 503\nU. S. 1 (1992), apply to a pretrial detainee's excessive force\nclaim arising in the context of a prison disturbance. We can\ndraw no logical or practical distinction between a prison\ndisturbance involving pretrial detainees, convicted but\nunsentenced inmates, or sentenced inmates. Nor can\nprison guards be expected to draw such precise distinctions\nbetween classes of inmates when those guards are trying to\nstop a prison disturbance.\n\nConsequently, Fuentes' objections to having to prove\n\"wanton pain and suffering\" and \"an unwise excessive zeal,\namounting to an abuse of official power,\" were properly\noverruled. We are not troubled by the court's instruction\nrequiring Fuentes to establish that the challenged force was\nmotivated by a desire to inflict \"wanton pain and suffering.\"\nThat requirement is nothing more than a restatement of the\nrequirement that Fuentes establish that the force was\n\"inspired by an unwise, excessive zeal, amounting to an\nabuse of official power.\" That requirement in turn amounts\nto nothing more than the application of force \"maliciously\nand sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\"\n\nHowever, Fuentes' objection to having to prove that the\nprison guards' conduct \"shocked the conscience,\" as\nrequired by the instruction, is somewhat more troublesome.\nAlthough \"shocks the conscience\" is a term of art in\nFourteenth Amendment substantive due process\njurisprudence, see Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 172-\n73 (1952), our recent decisions suggest that the standard\nmay only apply to police pursuit cases. See Fagan v. City of\nVineland, 22 F.3d. 1296, 1306 (3d Cir. 1994); see also\nKneipp v. Tedder, 95 F.3d 1199, 1207-08 (3d Cir. 1996)\n(\"We believe that the Fagan II shocks the conscience\n\n                               19\n\n\nstandard is limited to police pursuit cases. . . .\").\nFurthermore, in Valencia v. Wiggins, supra, the court\nrejected the contention that a pretrial detainee bringing an\nexcessive force claim arising from a prison disturbance had\n\fto demonstrate that the prison guards' conduct \"shocked\nthe conscience.\"\n\nNonetheless, we believe that, in light of the Supreme\nCourt's decision in County of Sacramento v. Lewis, ___ U.\nS. ___, 118 S. Ct. 1708 (1998), the \"shocks the conscience\"\nstandard is not inappropriate to an excessive force claim in\nthe context of a prison disturbance. Lewis involved a high\nspeed police chase of a motorcycle that ended in the death\nof the passenger of the fleeing motorcycle. The parents of\nthe decedent sued under 42 U.S.C. S 1983 alleging that the\npolice conduct violated the constitutional rights of the\ndecedent. The Court's analysis of the police conduct\nclarifies that the \"shocks the conscience\" standard of\nculpability applies in those instances where the police\nofficer must instantaneously respond to a situation without\nopportunity for reflection on his or her actions. 118 S. Ct.\nat 1721.\n\nIn concluding that the \"shocks the conscience\" standard\napplies to police pursuit cases, the Court analogized the\npolice officers' situation in a pursuit case to that of prison\nofficials who have to immediately respond to a violent\nprison disturbance to restore and to maintain order and\nsecurity. Id. at 1720 (\"The analogy to sudden police chases\n(under the Due Process Clause) would be hard to avoid.\").\n\nMoreover, in Hudson v. McMillian, the Court noted that:\n\n       the officials confronted with a prison disturbance must\n       balance the threat unrest poses to inmates, prison\n       workers, administrators, and visitors against the harm\n       inmates may suffer if guards use force. . . . Whether\n       the prison disturbance is a riot or a lesser disruption,\n       corrections officers must balance the need to maintain\n       or restore discipline through force against the risk of\n       injury to inmates. Both situations may require prison\n       officials to act quickly and decisively. Likewise, both\n       implicate the principle that [p]rison administrators\n       . . . should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the\n\n                               20\n\n\n       adoption and execution of policies and practices that in\n       their judgment are needed to preserve internal order\n       and discipline and to maintain institutional security. In\n       recognition of these similarities, we hold that whenever\n       prison officials stand accused of using excessive\n       physical force in violation of the Cruel and Unusual\n       Punishments Clause, the core judicial inquiry is . ..\n       whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to\n       maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and\n       sadistically to cause harm.\n\fHudson, 503 U.S. at 6-7 (citations and internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\nHere, Kleeman, Konemann and Donato were faced with\nFuentes' disruptive and violent behavior for which they\nwere not to blame. They could not take time to reason\nthrough various options to determine the most appropriate\nresponse. Rather, they had to quickly respond in order to\nquell the disturbance Fuentes was creating, and minimize\nthe possibility of an escalating disruption inside the prison.\nUnder those circumstances, we believe that the \"shocks the\nconscience\" test that the Supreme Court has utilized in\nanalogous situations, including high speed chases, is the\nappropriate gauge of the conduct. Accordingly, wefind no\nerror in the Magistrate Judge's jury instruction.\n\nIII.

S 1983. The suit arose from an\nincident that occurred in the Berks County Prison where\nFuentes was detained while awaiting sentencing on\noutstanding federal charges. Fuentes alleged a cause of\naction for excessive force under the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments, a substantive due process claim for cruel and\nunusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments, a procedural due process claim under the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Mr. Fuentes was granted in forma pauperis status, and counsel agreed\nto represent him pro bono. We express our appreciation for the service\ncounsel provided the court, and the quality of their advocacy on behalf\nof Mr. Fuentes.\n\n                               2\n\n\nFourteenth Amendment, and state law claims for assault\nand battery, and false imprisonment.2\n\nCross-motions for summary judgment were eventually\nfiled, and the Magistrate Judge to whom the matter had\nbeen assigned granted summary judgment in favor of the\nprison officials on Fuentes' substantive due process claim,\nbut denied summary judgment on the remaining claims.\nThose remaining claims then proceeded to trial, and a jury\nreturned a verdict in favor of the defendants. Fuentes' post-\ntrial motions were denied, and this appeal followed. 3 We will\naffirm.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nIn December of 1995, Fuentes was being housed in the\nbehavioral adjustment unit (\"BAU\") of the Berks County\nPrison awaiting sentencing on federal drug charges to\nwhich he had previously pled guilty. His cell was typical of\nthe cells in the BAU. It measured approximately 6 by 10\nfeet and contained only a sink, a toilet, and a cement slab.\n\nOn December 28, 1995, the inmates in the BAU were not\nallowed their one-hour exercise period outdoors because of\ninclement weather. Instead, they were individually released\nfrom their cells to exercise in the hallway immediately\noutside their respective cells. After another inmatefinished\nexercising, Fuentes began kicking his own cell door and\nyelling for a Correctional Officer (\"CO\"). 4 CO Konemann and\nCO Kleeman came to Fuentes' cell, and Fuentes complained\n\fthat another inmate had urinated into Fuentes' cell. Neither\nKonemann nor Kleeman saw any urine on Fuentes' cell\nfloor. However, Kleeman did notice some wetness on the\ndoor and the floor outside of Fuentes' cell.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Fuentes filed a pro se complaint on January 11, 1996. Thereafter, he\nwas granted ifp status and counsel was appointed to represent him. A\nfirst amended complaint was filed on February 28, 1997, and a second\namended complaint was filed on November 14, 1997.\n3.

Fuentes knew that kicking his cell door was a violation of the rules of\nthe BAU.\n\n                               3\n\n\nPolicy requires that a CO handcuff an inmate who is\nhoused in the disciplinary unit before entering his cell.\nAccordingly, Konemann and Kleeman told Fuentes to\nextend his hands through the food slot of his cell door so\nthat they could handcuff him and enter his cell. Fuentes\ncomplied, and was handcuffed. The COs entered and told\nFuentes they were going to strip his cell because he had\nkicked his cell door.5 However, as Konemann began\nremoving sheets from Fuentes' bed in an effort to strip the\ncell, Fuentes grabbed the sheets and a struggle ensued. The\nparties offer different versions of exactly what happened\nnext.\n\nAccording to the defendants, Fuentes swung at\nKonemann's head with his handcuffed fists after\nunsuccessfully trying to grab the sheets. Konemann stated\nhe saw Fuentes' swing, and that he pushed Fuentes\nbackwards. When Fuentes moved back toward Konemann,\nKleeman stepped forward and wrestled Fuentes to thefloor.\nFuentes was then face down on the cell floor with his\nhandcuffed arms beneath him. Kleeman was partially on\ntop of Fuentes as Konemann assisted in holding Fuentes\ndown. According to the defendants, Fuentes was combative\nand was trying to free himself as Konemann and Kleeman\ntried to control him.\n\nCO Donato arrived shortly after Konemann and Kleeman\nbegan stripping the cell, but Donato left to get leg shackles\nand to call for assistance. After Donato retrieved the leg\nshackles she returned with several other COs, and the\nshackles were fastened around Fuentes' legs. Sergeant\nBrown, a supervising CO, did not enter Fuentes' cell, but\nhe did hear Fuentes yelling at Kleeman and Konemann.\nDonato told Brown that Konemann and Kleeman had been\n\fstripping Fuentes' cell when Fuentes swung at Konemann.\nBrown then left to obtain permission to place Fuentes in a\nrestraint chair. Permission was granted by Assistant\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. Cell stripping is a procedure which may be used when an inmate is\ncausing a disturbance. It consists of removing from the cell all items\nexcept the clothes on the inmate's back, his legal papers and his\ntoothbrush. For the first violation, the cell is stripped for 24 hours.\nFor\n\neach subsequent infraction, an additional 24 hours is added.\n\n                               4\n\n\nWarden, who authorized use of the restraint chair for eight\nhours. Fuentes' civil rights claim is based upon the use of\nthat restraint chair and his allegation that Konemann and\nKleeman used excessive force during the initial\nconfrontation in his cell.6\n\nFuentes was no longer physically resisting when Brown\nreturned with permission to use the restraint chair.\nHowever, Kleeman and Konemann were still holding\nFuentes down, and Fuentes was threatening to \"get\"\nKonemann. Fuentes was then carried from his cell to a\nnearby cell where he was placed in the restraint chair. He\ndid not resist physically being placed in the chair, though\nhe did not cooperate.\n\nWith regard to the initial confrontation in Fuentes' cell,\nFuentes alleged that Konemann and Kleeman threw him to\nthe floor and beat him, and that Kleeman smeared his hand\nall over Fuentes' face. Fuentes denied trying to strike\nKonemann or threatening him. Fuentes insisted that he\nonly asked Kleeman and Konemann why they were hitting\nhim, and he claimed to have remained still from the time he\nwas beaten until the time he was placed in the restraint\nchair. Kleeman admitted that Fuentes was no longer a\nthreat to himself or anyone else once his hands were cuffed\nand his legs shackled. From the time Fuentes was removed\nfrom his cell to the time he was placed in the restraint\nchair, he was neither resisting nor physically combative.\nFuentes was not given an opportunity to explain or defend\nany of his actions prior to being placed in the chair.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. The restraint chair at Berks County Prison is the \"Pro-straint Violent\nPrisoner Chair.\" The back of the chair is angled back at a 45#DE# angle.\nAn\n\ninmate is placed in the chair with his arms handcuffed behind his back\nand his legs shackled. A restraint belt is fastened across the inmate's\n\flap, and two more restraint belts are placed across his chest while\nanother restraint belt secures his ankles. At Berks County Prison, it is\nstandard operating procedure to shackle an inmate's legs, as well as\ncuffing his wrists. The handcuffs that are used are double-locked so they\ncannot loosen or tighten more than when initially set. The prison has\nthree restraint chairs, and they are on wheels so that they can be moved\nbetween housing units. They are used in the female unit, the disciplinary\nunit and the mental health unit. The chairs are not used on general\npopulation inmates.\n\n                               5\n\n\nFuentes' confinement in the restraint chair was\nconsistent with the institution's policy. COs checked him at\nfifteen minute intervals and he was released every two\nhours for a ten minute period of stretching, exercise, and\nuse of the toilet. In addition, he was given a meal and seen\nby the medical staff at the end of the first two hour interval.\nThe parties disputed whether Fuentes made any verbal\nthreats during his first release period. Fuentes denied doing\nso, however, Konemann said that Fuentes was still\nthreatening him and saying that he would \"get\" Konemann\nwhen he got out on the street.\n\nDuring the second release period, which came at the end\nof four hours, Fuentes told Konemann \"he wasn't going to\nget away with it, that [Fuentes] was going to see him sooner\nor later . . . .\" Konemann interpreted this as a threat.\nHowever, Fuentes claimed that he only meant that he was\ngoing to sue Konemann.\n\nWhen the third release period arrived, Fuentes had\nstopped making threats. He was finally released at the end\nof eight hours and examined by a staff nurse, as dictated\nby policy. She noted that Fuentes complained of pain in his\nright lower rib cage, but she observed no injuries with the\nexception of small bruises or swelling on both wrists.\n\nOn December 29, 1995, Fuentes was brought before the\nprison disciplinary board for a hearing on charges of\nassault/fighting/horseplay, threats, refusal of orders, and\ndisturbance. He was given an opportunity to make a\nstatement. The assault charge was dismissed but the board\nfound him guilty of threats, refusal of orders and\ndisturbance. Sanctions in the form of loss of all earned time\ncredit and thirty days segregation were imposed.\n\nFuentes claimed that being in the restraint chair for eight\nhours resulted in loss of feeling in his hands and feet, cuts\non his wrists and ankles where he had been handcuffed\nand shackled, leg cramps, discomfort in his arms,\nrestricted breathing, and back pain.\n\fII. DISCUSSION\n\nFuentes argues that the Magistrate Judge erred by: (1)\ndenying his motion for judgment as a matter of law on his\n\n                                6\n\n\nprocedural due process claim; (2) granting summary\njudgment in favor of the defendants on his substantive due\nprocess claim; and (3) instructing the jury improperly on\nhis excessive force claim.\n\nA. The Procedural Due Process Claim.\n\nFuentes alleged that his eight hour confinement in the\nrestraint chair violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the\nUnited States Constitution. The Magistrate Judge denied\ncross-motions for summary judgment on the procedural\ndue process claim after finding that \"the evidence\ndemonstrates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\nMr. Fuentes was placed in the restraint chair for punitive\nreasons or security reasons. . . .\" Op. at 15. After the jury\nfound against him on his procedural due process claim,\nFuentes moved for judgment as a matter of law. However,\nthe Magistrate Judge denied that motion. Fuentes claims\nthat was error.\n\nWe exercise plenary review over the denial of a motion for\njudgment as a matter of law, and we apply the same\nstandard that the District Court should have used.\nLightning Lube, Inc. v.

We stated:\n\n       The trial judge, in fashioning relief, drew a distinction\n       between pretrial detainees and convicted but\n       unsentenced inmates. He concluded that `the\n       conviction alone appears to extinguish any `liberty'\n       interest formally derived from the fourteenth\n       amendment.' We disagree.

Op. at 9 n.17. In this appeal, the defendants argue that\nFuentes' status is the same as a sentenced inmate. See Appellees' Br. at\n13, 20. We reject that argument because it contravenes the concession\nmade before the Magistrate Judge, and because it is simply wrong. See\nBell v.

Fuentes' liberty interests are grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment\nbecause his allegations are against state actors as he was confined in a\ncounty prison.\n\n9. The defendants, although discussing Bell v. Wolfish, rely, in part, on\nSandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995), in support of their argument\nthat Fuentes was not punished without due process of law. In Sandin,\nthe Court held that liberty interests protected by the Due Process Clause\n\"will be generally limited to freedom from restraint which, while not\n\n                               8\n\n\n       [I]n evaluating the constitutionality of conditions or\n\f       restrictions of pretrial detention that implicate only the\n       protection against deprivation of liberty without due\n       process of law, we think the proper inquiry is whether\n       those conditions amount to punishment of the\n       detainee.\n\nId. at 535. \"[A] detainee may not be punished prior to an\nadjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of\nlaw.\" Id. However, \"[o]nce the Government has exercised its\nconceded authority to detain a person pending trial, it\nobviously is entitled to employ devices that are calculated\nto effectuate this detention.\" Id. at 537. Thus, \"[r]estraints\nthat are reasonably related to the institution's interest in\nmaintaining jail security do not, without more, constitute\nunconstitutional punishment, even if they are\ndiscomforting. . . .\" Id. at 540. Obviously, \"ensuring\nsecurity and order at the institution is a permissible\nnonpunitive objective, whether the facility houses pretrial\ndetainees, convicted inmates, or both.\" Id. at 561.\nConsequently, \"whether . . . restrictions and practices\nconstitute punishment in the constitutional sense depends\non whether they are rationally related to a legitimate\nnonpunitive government purpose and whether they appear\nexcessive in relation to that purpose.\" Id. Thus, there is a\n\"distinction between punitive measures that may not\nconstitutionally be imposed prior to a determination of guilt\nand regulatory restraints that may.\" Id.\n\n       [We] must decide whether the disability is imposed for\n       the purpose of punishment or whether it is but an\n       incident of some other legitimate governmental\n       purpose. Absent a showing of an expressed intent to\n       punish on the part of detention facility officials, that\n       determination generally will turn on whether an\n       alternative purpose to which [the restriction] may\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nexceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to\nprotection by the Due Process Clause in its own force, nonetheless\nimposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to\nthe ordinary incidents of prison life.\" 515 U. S. at 484. However, Sandin\ndoes not apply here. Sandin concerned punishment of a sentenced\nprisoner, and therefore required a completely different analysis.\n\n                               9\n\n\n       rationally be connected is assignable for it, and\n       whether it appears excessive in relation to the\n 659alternative purpose assigned [to it]. Thus, if a\n\n       particular condition or restriction of pretrial detention\n       is reasonably related to a legitimate governmental\n       objective, it does not, without more, amount to\n\f       `punishment.' Conversely, if a restriction or condition is\n       not reasonably related to a legitimate goal--if it is\n       arbitrary or purposeless--a court permissibly may infer\n       that the purpose of the governmental action is\n       punishment that may not constitutionally be inflicted\n       upon detainees qua detainees.\n\nId. at 538-39.\n\nFuentes has not clearly established that officials used the\nrestraint chair as a means of \"punishing\" (as opposed to\ncontrolling) him. Accordingly, we must determine if this\nparticular restriction, which may appear to be punitive, was\nreally an incident of a legitimate nonpunitive objective. Id.\nat 539 n.20. \"[A]bsent a showing of intent to punish, a\ncourt must determine if a particular restriction or\ncondition, which may on its face appear to be punishment,\nis instead but an incident of a legitimate nonpunitive\ngovernmental objective.\" Id. \"Retribution and deterrence are\nnot legitimate nonpunitive governmental objectives.\" Id.\n\nFuentes argues that \"a reasonable jury could only have\nconcluded that the defendants confined [him] in the\nrestraint chair -- and kept him there for eight long\nhours -- to punish him.\" Appellant's Br. at 38-39. He\ntherefore claims that the Magistrate Judge erred in denying\nhis motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n\nClearly, there is evidence in this record from which a\nreasonable jury could conclude that use of the restraint\nchair was punishment. Sergeant Brown testified that the\nchair is used in the disciplinary unit for behavior\nmodification purposes. Warden Wagner testified that the\nrestraint chair is used to abate an inmate's behavior, and\nthat it is used for behavior modification and control.\nPerhaps most significantly, he also testified that there is\nnothing the inmate can do to affect the amount of time he\nwill remain in the chair once the inmate is placed in it.\n\n                               10\n\n\nHowever, there is also evidence from which a reasonable\njury could conclude that Fuentes was placed in the\nrestraint chair to quell a disturbance and restore the order\nand security of the institution. Kleeman testified that the\nrestraint chair is used to handle an aggressive inmate who\nis causing harm to himself or others. Kleeman and\nKonemann both testified that Fuentes kicked his cell door\nand swung his handcuffed hands at Konemann's head.\nKonemann testified that although Fuentes was not\nphysically aggressive when released from the chair during\nthe first and second rest periods, Fuentes did continue to\nmake threats.\n\fGiven this conflicting evidence, we disagree with Fuentes'\ncontention that a reasonable jury could only conclude that\nuse of the chair was punitive. The evidence was sufficient\nto allow a jury to conclude that he was placed in the\nrestraint chair to stop his disruptive behavior and maintain\nprison order and security. Accordingly, the Magistrate\nJudge did not err in denying Fuentes' motion for judgment\nas a matter of law. \"Conflicting evidence which could\nreasonably lead to inconsistent conclusions will not justify\"\na judgment as a matter of law.

The Substantive Due Process Claim.10\n\nFuentes alleged that the use of the restraint chair\nviolated his substantive due process rights under the\nFourteenth Amendment, and constituted cruel and unusual\npunishment under the Eighth Amendment as a matter of\nlaw. However, the basis of his claim is elusive. The\nMagistrate Judge concluded that Fuentes was claiming that\nthe use of the restraint chair is unconstitutional under any\ncircumstances under the Eighth Amendment.

However, in his brief to\nus, Fuentes conflates his substantive due process claim\ninto his procedural due process claim by arguing that the\ncentral issue with respect to both is whether the use of the\nchair constituted punishment. The appellees describe\nFuentes argument before us as follows:\n\n       [Fuentes] appears to now contend that the district\n       court should have considered only whether [he] was\n       punished, not whether the alleged punishment was\n       cruel and unusual. [Thus, Fuentes'] argument with\n       respect to the district court's ruling on [the substantive\n       due process claim] relating to claims of cruel and\n       unusual punishment is confusing at best.\n\nSee Appellees' Br. at 9.\n\fFuentes argues that the Magistrate Judge incorrectly\nanalyzed his substantive due process claim under the\nEighth Amendment rather than under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. He correctly asserts that his claim is governed\nby the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of due process,\nand not the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel\nand unusual punishment because he had not been\nsentenced when the incident occurred.11 Under the\nFourteenth Amendment, a pretrial detainee is entitled \"at a\nminimum, [to] no less protection\" than a sentenced inmate\nis entitled to under the Eighth Amendment.

Nonetheless, he\nargues, not only that the Magistrate Judge erred by\ngranting summary judgment to the prison officials on his\nhybrid substantive due process claim, but also that he\n\fshould have been granted summary judgment on that\nclaim. He argues in the alternative that the claim should at\nleast have been submitted to the jury. We disagree.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. In Farmer v. Brennan, the Court finally defined \"deliberate\nindifference,\" which first appeared in Estelle v. Gamble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n104 (1976). The Court required a showing that the prison official was\n\"subjectively aware of the risk.\" 511 U. S. at 829. It wrote: \"We hold\n. . . that a prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth\nAmendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement\nunless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate\nhealth or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the\ninference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,\nand he must also draw the inference.\" Id. at 837.\n\n                               14\n\n\nFuentes' due process claim is limited to use of the\nrestraint chair. It does not encompass the force initially\nused to subdue him, or to place him in the chair.\nAccordingly, whether analyzed as an excessive force claim\nor a conditions of confinement claim, Fuentes had to\ndemonstrate that the prison officials had a \"sufficiently\nculpable state of mind,\" to establish that use of the\nrestraint violated the Eighth Amendment. It is obvious that\nprison officials were not \"deliberately indifferent\" to his\nhealth or well-being in employing the restraint chair, and a\nconditions of confinement analysis therefore requires little\ndiscussion.\n\nIt is undisputed that the prison policy for the use of the\nrestraint chair was followed here. Accordingly, Fuentes was\nnot kept in the chair any longer than had been authorized,\nhis physical condition was checked every 15 minutes, and\nhe was released every two hours for 10 minutes to allow\nstretching, exercise, and use of the toilet. He was given\nfood, and he was examined by a nurse at the end of the\neight hour confinement.13\n\nMoreover, even if we assume that the injuries Fuentes\nalleges were sufficiently serious to establish an Eighth\nAmendment violation, there is no evidence that prison\nofficials placed him in the chair \"maliciously and\nsadistically to cause harm.\" Fuentes argues that the prison\nofficials' conduct was malicious and sadistic because (1)\nthere was no need to use the restraint chair; (2) the\nrestraint chair was much too severe a response under the\ncircumstances; (3) the prison officials did not perceive him\nas an immediate threat when they placed him in the chair;\nand (4) the prison officials made no effort to temper the\nseverity of their response even though it was clear that he\nposed no threat to institutional security.

Given the\ntotality of the circumstances surrounding use of the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. These same factors that establish that the prison officials were not\ndeliberately indifferent also establish that Fuentes was not \"denied the\nminimal civilized measure of life's necessities.\"\n\n                               15\n\n\nrestraint chair here, any such over-reaction would still fall\nshort of supporting a finding that prison officials acted\n\"maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\"\n\nConsequently, the Magistrate Judge did not err by\ngranting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on\nFuentes' substantive due process claim.\n\nC. The Jury Instructions on Excessive Force. 14\n\nFuentes alleged that Konemann and Kleeman used\nexcessive force in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nFuentes also alleged that Donato was liable because she\nobserved the use of excessive force and failed to intervene\nwith respect to the initial confrontation in his cell. Over\nFuentes' objection, the Magistrate Judge charged the jury\non excessive force as follows:\n\n       [P]laintiff must show by a preponderance of the\n       evidence, that one or more of the defendants inflicted\n       unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering. You must\n       decide whether the force applied was in a good faith\n       effort to maintain or restore discipline, in which case,\n       you must find that the defendants did not use\n       excessive force, or whether the force applies (sic) was\n       inspired by an unwise, excessive zeal, amounting to an\n       abuse of official power, that shocks the conscience, in\n       which case, you must find that one or more of the\n       defendants did use excessive force.\n\nFuentes argues that this charge \"compelled [him] to meet\na much higher burden than an unsentenced inmate is\nrequired to meet in order to prove an excessive force claim.\"\nAppellant's Br. at 47. He argues that the \"objective\nreasonableness\" instruction he proposed should have been\ngiven to the jury instead.15\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14.

The \"objective reasonableness\"\ntest has its constitutional foundation in the Fourth\nAmendment and is properly applied in excessive force\nclaims arising from investigatory stops and/or arrests.\nGraham v. Connor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989). The Court in\nGraham specifically stated:\n\n       Our cases have not resolved the question of whether\n       the Fourth Amendment continues to provide\n       individuals with protection against the deliberate use of\n       force beyond the point at which arrest ends and\n       pretrial detention begins, and we do not attempt to\n       answer that question today. It is clear, however, that\n       the Due Process Clause protects a pretrial detainee from\n       the use of excessive force that amounts to punishment.\n\n490 U. S. at 395 n.10 (citations omitted)(emphasis added).\n\nOur conclusion that Fuentes was not entitled to an\n\"objective reasonableness\" instruction does not, however,\ncompletely meet Fuentes' claim of error. Fuentes' essential\npoint is that the instruction given to the jury was an Eighth\nAmendment excessive force instruction applicable to\nsentenced inmates and inapplicable to him. He argues that\nhis excessive force claim should have been analyzed under\nthe Bell v. Wolfish \"conditions of confinement\" standard\nbecause he was a pretrial detainee. He insists that he was\nnot required to prove that he experienced \"wanton pain and\nsuffering\" or to establish that the application of force upon\nhim \"was inspired by an unwise, excessive zeal, amounting\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       the evidence: (1) that the plaintiff suffered some harm, (2) that\nthe\n       harm resulted directly from the use of force that was clearly\n       excessive in relation to any need for the use of force, and (3)\nthat\nthe\n       excessiveness of the force was objectively unreasonable in light of\n       the facts and circumstances at the time.\n\n       Some of the factors you may consider in determining whether the\n       defendants used excessive force are: (1) the extent of the injury\n       suffered, (2) the need for the use of force, (3) the relationship\n\f       between that need and the amount of force used, (4) the threat\n       reasonably perceived by the prison guards involved; and (5) any\n       efforts made to temper the severity of the forceful response.\n\n                               17\n\n\nto an abuse of official power\" or to prove that the conduct\nof Konemann, Kleeman and Donato \"shocked the\nconscience.\"\n\nHowever, we agree with the contrary analysis in Valencia\nv. Wiggins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597117\"><a href=\"/opinion/597117/raul-jose-valencia-v-garry-d-wiggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1440</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1993). There, the court\nalso addressed a pretrial detainee's excessive force claim\nagainst a prison guard. The claim arose from a prison\ndisturbance. The court initially looked to Bell v. Wolfish for\nguidance in determining the standards to be applied.\nHowever, it found that Bell, while working\"well for claims\nof improper conditions or restrictions, . . . does not lend\nitself to analysis of claims of excessive force in controlling\nprison disturbances.\" Id. at 1446. The court reasoned:\n\n       In Bell, the Court stated that the government must be\n       able to take steps to maintain security and that\n       \"[r]estraints that are reasonably related to the\n       institution's interest in maintaining jail security do not,\n       without more, constitute unconstitutional punishment\n       . . . .\" Bell further noted that there is no reason to\n       distinguish between pretrial detainees and convicted\n       inmates in reviewing challenged security practices\n       because there is no basis to conclude that pretrial\n       detainees pose any lesser security risk than convicted\n       inmates.\n\n       For these reasons, we conclude that excessive use of\n       force claims by pretrial detainees should not be\n       analyzed under Bell's conditions of confinement\n       standard. Instead, we are guided by the standard\n       announced in Whitley and Hudson. While these cases\n       specifically addressed claims of excessive use of force\n       brought by convicted prisoners, it is impractical to\n       draw a line between convicted prisoners and pretrial\n       detainees for the purpose of maintaining jail security.\n       Moreover, the Court indicated in Hudson that many of\n       its concerns in Whitley were not limited to Eighth\n       Amendment claims but \"arise whenever guards use\n       force to keep order.\" It further observed that claims\n       based on excessive force and claims based on\n       conditions of confinement are different in kind.\n\n       Therefore, when a court is called upon to examine the\n       amount of force used on a pretrial detainee for the\n\n                               18\n\f       purpose of institutional security, the appropriate\n       analysis is that announced in Whitley and Hudson:\n       whether the measure taken inflicted unnecessary and\n       wanton pain and suffering depends on \"whether force\n       was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore\n       discipline, or maliciously and sadistically for the very\n       purpose of causing harm.\"\n\nId. Accordingly, we hold that the Eighth Amendment cruel\nand unusual punishments standards found in Whitley v.\nAlbers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986) and Hudson v.

We can\ndraw no logical or practical distinction between a prison\ndisturbance involving pretrial detainees, convicted but\nunsentenced inmates, or sentenced inmates. Nor can\nprison guards be expected to draw such precise distinctions\nbetween classes of inmates when those guards are trying to\nstop a prison disturbance.\n\nConsequently, Fuentes' objections to having to prove\n\"wanton pain and suffering\" and \"an unwise excessive zeal,\namounting to an abuse of official power,\" were properly\noverruled. We are not troubled by the court's instruction\nrequiring Fuentes to establish that the challenged force was\nmotivated by a desire to inflict \"wanton pain and suffering.\"\nThat requirement is nothing more than a restatement of the\nrequirement that Fuentes establish that the force was\n\"inspired by an unwise, excessive zeal, amounting to an\nabuse of official power.\" That requirement in turn amounts\nto nothing more than the application of force \"maliciously\nand sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\"\n\nHowever, Fuentes' objection to having to prove that the\nprison guards' conduct \"shocked the conscience,\" as\nrequired by the instruction, is somewhat more troublesome.\nAlthough \"shocks the conscience\" is a term of art in\nFourteenth Amendment substantive due process\njurisprudence, see Rochin v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104943\"><a href=\"/opinion/104943/rochin-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 172-\n73 (1952), our recent decisions suggest that the standard\nmay only apply to police pursuit cases. See Fagan v. City of\nVineland, 22 F.3d. 1296, 1306 (3d Cir. 1994); see also\nKneipp v. Tedder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726573\"><a href=\"/opinion/726573/samantha-kneipp-an-incompetent-person-by-ronald-a-cusack-sr-rosanne-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1207-08 (3d Cir. 1996)\n(\"We believe that the Fagan II shocks the conscience\n\n                               19\n\n\nstandard is limited to police pursuit cases. . . .\").\nFurthermore, in Valencia v. Wiggins, supra, the court\nrejected the contention that a pretrial detainee bringing an\nexcessive force claim arising from a prison disturbance had\n\fto demonstrate that the prison guards' conduct \"shocked\nthe conscience.\"\n\nNonetheless, we believe that, in light of the Supreme\nCourt's decision in County of Sacramento v. Lewis, ___ U.\nS. ___, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118214\"><a href=\"/opinion/118214/countyof-sacramento-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1708</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998), the \"shocks the conscience\"\nstandard is not inappropriate to an excessive force claim in\nthe context of a prison disturbance. Lewis involved a high\nspeed police chase of a motorcycle that ended in the death\nof the passenger of the fleeing motorcycle. The parents of\nthe decedent sued under 42 U.S.C. S 1983 alleging that the\npolice conduct violated the constitutional rights of the\ndecedent. The Court's analysis of the police conduct\nclarifies that the \"shocks the conscience\" standard of\nculpability applies in those instances where the police\nofficer must instantaneously respond to a situation without\nopportunity for reflection on his or her actions. 118 S. Ct.\nat 1721.\n\nIn concluding that the \"shocks the conscience\" standard\napplies to police pursuit cases, the Court analogized the\npolice officers' situation in a pursuit case to that of prison\nofficials who have to immediately respond to a violent\nprison disturbance to restore and to maintain order and\nsecurity. Id. at 1720 (\"The analogy to sudden police chases\n(under the Due Process Clause) would be hard to avoid.\").\n\nMoreover, in Hudson v. McMillian, the Court noted that:\n\n       the officials confronted with a prison disturbance must\n       balance the threat unrest poses to inmates, prison\n       workers, administrators, and visitors against the harm\n       inmates may suffer if guards use force. . . . Whether\n       the prison disturbance is a riot or a lesser disruption,\n       corrections officers must balance the need to maintain\n       or restore discipline through force against the risk of\n       injury to inmates. Both situations may require prison\n       officials to act quickly and decisively. Likewise, both\n       implicate the principle that [p]rison administrators\n       . . . should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the\n\n                               20\n\n\n       adoption and execution of policies and practices that in\n       their judgment are needed to preserve internal order\n       and discipline and to maintain institutional security. In\n       recognition of these similarities, we hold that whenever\n       prison officials stand accused of using excessive\n       physical force in violation of the Cruel and Unusual\n       Punishments Clause, the core judicial inquiry is . ..\n       whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to\n       maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and\n       sadistically to cause harm.\n\fHudson, 503 U.S. at 6-7 (citations and internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\nHere, Kleeman, Konemann and Donato were faced with\nFuentes' disruptive and violent behavior for which they\nwere not to blame. They could not take time to reason\nthrough various options to determine the most appropriate\nresponse. Rather, they had to quickly respond in order to\nquell the disturbance Fuentes was creating, and minimize\nthe possibility of an escalating disruption inside the prison.\nUnder those circumstances, we believe that the \"shocks the\nconscience\" test that the Supreme Court has utilized in\nanalogous situations, including high speed chases, is the\nappropriate gauge of the conduct. Accordingly, wefind no\nerror in the Magistrate Judge's jury instruction.\n\nIII.
