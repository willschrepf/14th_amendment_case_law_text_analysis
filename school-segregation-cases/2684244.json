Although the death penalty has been a\nfixture of Connecticut’s criminal law since early colo-\nnial times, public opinion concerning it has long been\ndivided. In 2009, growing opposition to capital punish-\nment led the legislature to enact Public Acts 2009, No.\n09-107 (P.A. 09-107), which would have repealed the\ndeath penalty for all crimes committed on or after the\ndate of enactment but retained the death penalty for\ncapital felonies committed prior to that date. Then Gov-\nernor M. Jodi Rell vetoed P.A. 09-107, however, and it\ndid not become law. Three years later, in 2012, the\nlegislature passed a materially identical act that pro-\nspectively repealed the death penalty; see Public Acts\n2012, No. 12-5 (P.A. 12-5); and, this time, Governor Dan-\nnel P. Malloy signed it into law. During the public hear-\nings on both P.A. 09-107 and P.A. 12-5, supporters\nargued that the proposed legislation represented a mea-\nsured and lawful approach to the issue. Others raised\nserious concerns, however, as to whether, following a\nprospective only repeal, the imposition of the death\npenalty would violate the state constitutional prohibi-\ntion against cruel and unusual punishment. Perhaps\nmost notably, Chief State’s Attorney Kevin T. Kane, who\nserves as this state’s chief law enforcement officer and\nrepresents the state in the present case, testified before\nthe legislature that such a statute could not pass consti-\ntutional muster.1 Additionally, the Division of Criminal\nJustice submitted written testimony, in which it advised\nthe legislature that a prospective only repeal would be\na ‘‘fiction’’ and that, ‘‘[i]n reality, it would effectively\nabolish the death penalty for anyone who has not yet\nbeen executed because it would be untenable as a mat-\nter of constitutional law . . . . [A]ny death penalty that\nhas been imposed and not carried out would effectively\nbe nullified.’’2 In the present appeal, the defendant, Edu-\nardo Santiago, raises similar claims, contending that,\nfollowing the decision by the elected branches to abol-\nish capital punishment for all crimes committed on or\nafter April 25, 2012, it would be unconstitutionally cruel\nand unusual to execute offenders who committed capi-\ntal crimes before that date. Upon careful consideration\nof the defendant’s claims in light of the governing consti-\ntutional principles and Connecticut’s unique historical\nand legal landscape, we are persuaded that, following\nits prospective abolition, this state’s death penalty no\nlonger comports with contemporary standards of\ndecency and no longer serves any legitimate penological\npurpose. For these reasons, execution of those offend-\ners who committed capital felonies prior to April 25,\n2012, would violate the state constitutional prohibition\nagainst cruel and unusual punishment.\n   Following a trial on charges that included capital\nfelony in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999)\n§ 53a-54b (2)3 and General Statutes § 53a-8, a jury found\n\fthe defendant guilty as charged, and the trial court,\nLavine, J., rendered judgment accordingly.4 The court\nthen conducted a penalty phase hearing pursuant to\nGeneral Statutes (Rev. to 1999) § 53a-46a, at which the\njury found the existence of an aggravating factor, one\nor more jurors found the existence of one or more\nmitigating factors, and the jury found that the aggravat-\ning factor outweighed the mitigating factor or factors.\nThe trial court thereupon imposed a sentence of death,5\nand the defendant appealed to this court from both the\njudgment of conviction and the death sentence. See\nState v. Santiago, 305 Conn. 101, 117–18, 49 A.3d 566\n(2012) (Santiago I). While the appeal was pending, the\nlegislature repealed the death penalty for all crimes\ncommitted on or after the effective date of the repeal,\nApril 25, 2012. See P.A. 12-5. On June 12, 2012, this\ncourt ultimately affirmed the judgment of conviction\nbut reversed the sentence of death and remanded the\ncase for a new penalty phase hearing on the ground\nthat the defendant had been deprived of the opportunity\nto review and use certain potentially mitigating evi-\ndence. See State v. Santiago, supra, 215, 308. There-\nafter, the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration\nin which he asked this court to consider, among other\nthings, whether the prospective repeal leads inexorably\nto the conclusion that capital punishment has ceased\nto comport with state constitutional requirements. The\nadoption of P.A. 12-5, when considered in light of the\nhistory of capital punishment in our state and other\nrecent legal developments, compels us to conclude that\nthe death penalty now constitutes cruel and unusual\npunishment, in violation of the state constitution. Con-\nsequently, we reverse the judgment of the trial court\nwith respect to the sentence of death on the capital\nfelony count and remand the case to that court with\ndirection to sentence the defendant to life imprison-\nment without the possibility of release on that count.6\n  The underlying facts of this case, which are set forth\nin detail in Santiago I, may be summarized briefly as\nfollows. In December, 2000, Mark Pascual agreed to\ngive the defendant a snowmobile from Pascual’s repair\nshop if the defendant would kill the victim, Joseph\nNiwinski, for whose girlfriend Pascual had developed\nromantic feelings. Id., 121. That same month, with the\nassistance of Pascual and another friend, the defendant\nentered the victim’s apartment and shot and killed the\nvictim as he slept. Id., 123. The defendant was charged\nwith, among other things, the capital felony of ‘‘murder\ncommitted by a defendant who is hired to commit the\nsame for pecuniary gain,’’ in violation of § 53a-54b (2).\n   In his original appeal to this court, the defendant\nraised numerous challenges to his conviction of capital\nfelony and his conviction on other charges, as well as\nhis death sentence. Id., 142–46. This court affirmed the\ndefendant’s conviction on all counts; see id., 118, 143,\n308; and declined his invitation to revisit our prior deci-\n\fsions holding that the death penalty is not a per se\nviolation of the Connecticut constitution.7 Id., 307. We\nalso concluded, however, that the trial court, Solomon,\nJ., improperly had failed to disclose to the defendant\ncertain confidential records in the possession of the\nDepartment of Children and Families that were mitigat-\ning in nature. Id., 215, 239–41. Accordingly, we reversed\nthe trial court’s judgment with respect to the sentence\nof death and remanded the case to the trial court for\na new penalty phase hearing. Id., 241, 308.\n   While the defendant’s appeal was pending in this\ncourt, the legislature passed and the governor signed\nP.A. 12-5, which repealed the death penalty for all\ncrimes committed on or after the date of passage, April\n25, 2012. See generally P.A. 12-5. Shortly before we\nreleased our opinion in Santiago I, the defendant filed\na motion for permission to file a supplemental brief in\nsupport of his argument that the prospective abolition\nof capital punishment barred the state from seeking the\ndeath penalty at his new penalty phase hearing. See\nState v. Santiago, supra, 307–308 n.167. Specifically,\nthe defendant sought review of what we characterized\nas four ‘‘new appellate claims,’’ the first of which was\nthat, ‘‘although his crimes were committed prior to the\neffective date of [P.A. 12-5], that legislation nevertheless\n‘represents a fundamental change in the contemporary\nstandard[s] of decency in Connecticut and a rejection\nof the penological justifications for the death penalty,’\nrendering the death penalty now cruel and unusual pun-\nishment . . . .’’ Id., 308 n.167.\n   We denied the defendant’s motion, concluding that\nhis new appellate claims would be more appropriately\naddressed in the context of a postjudgment motion. See\nid. Thereafter, the defendant filed such a motion, in\nwhich he sought reconsideration of our decision in San-\ntiago I. In support of his motion, he again maintained,\namong other things, that P.A. 12-5 ‘‘represents a funda-\nmental change in the contemporary standard[s] of\ndecency in Connecticut and a rejection of the penologi-\ncal justifications for the death penalty, eliminating the\nconstitutional prerequisites to the validity of the death\npenalty, such that it is now cruel and unusual punish-\nment forbidden by . . . article first, §§ 8 and 9, of the\n[state] constitution . . . .’’ The defendant also urged\nthis court to order supplemental briefing and further\noral argument on this and related issues, particularly\nin light of the fact that the constitutionality of imposing\nthe death penalty following a prospective only repeal\npresents a question of first impression in Connecticut\nand one that, to our knowledge, no jurisdiction has\naddressed comprehensively in the modern era. See\nState v. Santiago, Conn. Supreme Court Records &\nBriefs, April Term, 2013, Amicus Brief of the American\nCivil Liberties Union Foundation of Connecticut p. 2.\nWe granted the defendant’s motion for reconsideration\nand request for supplemental briefing and further oral\n\fargument without limitation.8\n   On reconsideration, although the defendant focuses\non the claim that P.A. 12-5 creates an impermissible\nand arbitrary distinction between individuals who com-\nmitted murders before and after April 25, 2012, in light\nof the prospective abolition of capital punishment, he\nalso asks this court to ‘‘exercise its independent judg-\nment as to the current acceptability of the death penalty\nin Connecticut.’’ Specifically, he argues that the enact-\nment of P.A. 12-5 means that ‘‘the death penalty is no\nlonger consistent with standards of decency in Connect-\nicut and does not serve any valid penological objective.’’\nThat claim is the sole issue that we address herein.9\n   Public Act 12-5 not only reflects this state’s long-\nstanding aversion to carrying out executions, but also\nrepresents the seminal change in the four century long\nhistory of capital punishment in Connecticut. Accompa-\nnying this dramatic departure are a host of other\nimportant developments that have transpired over the\npast several years. Historians have given us new chroni-\ncles of the history and devolution of the death penalty\nin Connecticut. Legal scholars have provided new\nunderstandings of the original meaning of the constitu-\ntional prohibition against cruel and unusual punish-\nments. Social scientists repeatedly have confirmed that\nthe risk of capital punishment falls disproportionately\non people of color and other disadvantaged groups.\nMeanwhile, nationally, the number of executions and\nthe number of states that allow the death penalty con-\ntinue to decline, and convicted capital felons in this\nstate remain on death row for decades with every likeli-\nhood that they will not be executed for many years to\ncome, if ever. Finally, it has become apparent that the\ndual federal constitutional requirements applicable to\nall capital sentencing schemes—namely, that the jury\nbe provided with objective standards to guide its sen-\ntence, on the one hand, and that it be accorded unfet-\ntered discretion to impose a sentence of less than death,\non the other—are fundamentally in conflict and inevita-\nbly open the door to impermissible racial and ethnic\nbiases. For all these reasons, and in light of the apparent\nintent of the legislature in prospectively repealing the\ndeath penalty and this state’s failure to implement and\noperate a fair and functional system of capital punish-\nment, we conclude that the state constitution no longer\npermits the execution of individuals sentenced to death\nfor crimes committed prior to the enactment of P.A.\n12-5.\n  In part I of this opinion, we review the scope, nature,\nand history of the protections from cruel and unusual\npunishment afforded by article first, §§ 8 and 9, of the\nconstitution of Connecticut, both as a general matter\nand as applied to capital punishment in particular. In\npart II of this opinion, we explain why, in view of the\nadoption of P.A. 12-5, and the state’s near total morato-\n\frium on carrying out executions over the past fifty-\nfive years, capital punishment has become incompatible\nwith contemporary standards of decency in Connecti-\ncut and, therefore, now violates the state constitutional\nprohibition against excessive and disproportionate pun-\nishments. In part III of this opinion, we explain why\nthe prospective repeal also means that the death penalty\nnow fails to satisfy any legitimate penological purpose\nand is unconstitutionally excessive on that basis as well.\nFinally, in part IV of this opinion, we address certain\ngeneral objections raised by the dissenting justices, and\nwe explain why their arguments are unpersuasive.10\n                             I\n     STATE CONSTITUTIONAL PROHIBITIONS\n        AGAINST CRUEL AND UNUSUAL\n               PUNISHMENT\n   Since this court first considered the constitutionality\nof capital punishment, we have recognized that, ‘‘in the\narea of fundamental civil liberties—which includes all\nprotections of the declaration of rights contained in\narticle first of the Connecticut constitution—we sit as\na court of last resort. In such constitutional adjudica-\ntion, our first referent is Connecticut law and the full\npanoply of rights Connecticut citizens have come to\nexpect as their due.’’11 (Internal quotation marks omit-\nted.) State v. Ross, 230 Conn. 183, 247–48, 646 A.2d 1318\n(1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130\nL. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995); accord State v. Mikolinski, 256\nConn. 543, 547, 775 A.2d 274 (2001).\n   It is by now well established that the constitution of\nConnecticut prohibits cruel and unusual punishments\nunder the auspices of the dual due process provisions\ncontained in article first, §§ 8 and 9.12 Those due process\nprotections take as their hallmark principles of funda-\nmental fairness rooted in our state’s unique common\nlaw, statutory, and constitutional traditions. See State\nv. Ross, supra, 230 Conn. 246–47; State v. Lamme, 216\nConn. 172, 178–79, 184, 579 A.2d 484 (1990). Although\nneither provision of the state constitution expressly\nreferences cruel or unusual punishments, it is settled\nconstitutional doctrine that both of our due process\nclauses prohibit governmental infliction of cruel and\nunusual punishments. See State v. Rizzo, 266 Conn.\n171, 206, 833 A.2d 363 (2003) (Rizzo I); State v. Ross,\nsupra, 246.\n   In this part of the opinion, we examine the freedoms\nfrom cruel and unusual punishment traditionally\nenjoyed by the citizens of this state. Because we have\nnot previously undertaken a comprehensive review of\nthese constitutional liberties, we first consider their\nscope and nature in full, before considering how they\napply to the defendant’s specific challenge to Connecti-\ncut’s current capital punishment scheme. In parts II\nand III of this opinion, we turn to that issue, namely,\n\fwhether, in light of the enactment of P.A. 12-5, the\nConnecticut constitution now forbids the imposition of\nthe death penalty.\n  In State v. Geisler, 222 Conn. 672, 610 A.2d 1225\n(1992), we identified six nonexclusive tools of analysis\nto be considered, to the extent applicable, whenever\nwe are called on as a matter of first impression to define\nthe scope and parameters of the state constitution: (1)\npersuasive relevant federal precedents; (2) historical\ninsights into the intent of our constitutional forebears;\n(3) the operative constitutional text; (4) related Con-\nnecticut precedents; (5) persuasive precedents of other\nstates; and (6) contemporary understandings of applica-\nble economic and sociological norms, or, as otherwise\ndescribed, relevant public policies.13 See id., 684–85; see\nalso State v. Rizzo, supra, 266 Conn. 208. These factors,\nwhich we consider in turn, inform our application of the\nestablished state constitutional standards—standards\nthat, as we explain hereinafter, derive from United\nStates Supreme Court precedent concerning the eighth\namendment—to the defendant’s claims in the present\ncase.14\n                            A\n           Federal Constitutional Standards\n   The eighth amendment to the federal constitution\nestablishes the minimum standards for what constitutes\nimpermissibly cruel and unusual punishment.15 See, e.g.,\nState v. Rizzo, supra, 266 Conn. 206. Specifically, the\nUnited States Supreme Court has indicated that at least\nthree types of punishment may be deemed unconstitu-\ntionally cruel: (1) inherently barbaric punishments; (2)\nexcessive and disproportionate punishments; and (3)\narbitrary or discriminatory punishments.16 In Ross, we\nbroadly adopted, as a matter of state constitutional\nlaw, this federal framework for evaluating challenges\nto allegedly cruel and unusual punishments.17 See State\nv. Ross, supra, 230 Conn. 252.\n                            1\n           Inherently Barbaric Punishments\n   First, the eighth amendment categorically prohibits\nthe imposition of inherently barbaric punishments. Gra-\nham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 59, 130 S. Ct. 2011, 176 L.\nEd. 2d 825 (2010). This prohibition is directed toward\nmanifestly and unnecessarily cruel punishments, such\nas torture and other wanton infliction of physical pain.\nSee, e.g., Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 170–72, 96 S.\nCt. 2909, 49 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1976) (opinion announcing\njudgment); In re Kemmler, 136 U.S. 436, 447, 10 S. Ct.\n930, 34 L. Ed. 519 (1890). In the context of capital\npunishment, the eighth amendment also bars particular\nmodes of execution that present a substantial or objec-\ntively intolerable risk of inflicting severe pain. Baze v.\nRees, 553 U.S. 35, 50, 52, 128 S. Ct. 1520, 170 L. Ed. 2d\n420 (2008) (opinion announcing judgment).\n\f                            2\n    Excessive and Disproportionate Punishments\n   Second, the eighth amendment mandates that punish-\nment be proportioned and graduated to the offense of\nconviction. See Graham v. Florida, supra, 560 U.S. 59.\nIn the capital punishment context, the United States\nSupreme Court has held, for example, that the death\npenalty is categorically excessive and disproportionate\nwhen imposed on certain classes of offenders. See, e.g.,\nRoper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 568, 125 S. Ct. 1183,\n161 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2005) (prohibiting execution of individu-\nals who were under eighteen years of age when they\ncommitted capital crimes); Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S.\n304, 321, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335 (2002) (execu-\ntion of intellectually disabled individuals was held to\nbe unconstitutional). The court also has concluded that\ncapital punishment is never warranted for nonhomicide\ncrimes against individuals. See, e.g., Kennedy v. Louisi-\nana, 554 U.S. 407, 446, 128 S. Ct. 2641, 171 L. Ed. 2d 525\n(2008) (death penalty was held to be disproportionate\npunishment for child rape); Enmund v. Florida, 458\nU.S. 782, 797, 102 S. Ct. 3368, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1140 (1982)\n(eighth amendment does not permit execution of defen-\ndant who did not kill or intend to kill but who played\nminor role in felony in course of which murder was\ncommitted by others); Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584,\n592 and n.4, 97 S. Ct. 2861, 53 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1977)\n(plurality opinion) (sentence of death for rape of adult\nwoman was held to be grossly disproportionate and\nexcessive punishment).\n   A reviewing court engages in a two stage analysis in\ndetermining whether a challenged punishment is uncon-\nstitutionally excessive and disproportionate. Enmund\nv. Florida, supra, 458 U.S. 788–89. First, the court looks\nto ‘‘objective factors’’ to determine whether the punish-\nment at issue comports with contemporary standards\nof decency. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 788.\nThese objective indicia include ‘‘the historical develop-\nment of the punishment at issue,’’ legislative enact-\nments, and the decisions of prosecutors and sentencing\njuries. Id.; see also Roper v. Simmons, supra, 543 U.S.\n563; Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815, 821–22, 108\nS. Ct. 2687, 101 L. Ed. 2d 702 (1988).\n   This objective evidence of contemporary social\nmores, however, does not wholly determine the issue.\n‘‘Although legislative measures adopted by the people’s\nchosen representatives provide one important means\nof ascertaining contemporary values, it is evident that\nlegislative judgments alone cannot be determinative of\n[e]ighth [a]mendment standards since that [a]mend-\nment was intended to safeguard individuals from the\nabuse of legislative power.’’ Gregg v. Georgia, supra,\n428 U.S. 174 n.19 (opinion announcing judgment).\nBecause the eighth amendment imposes ‘‘a restraint\n\f[on] the exercise of legislative power’’; id., 174; the\nUnited States Supreme Court repeatedly has empha-\nsized that courts must conduct a second stage of analy-\nsis in which they bring their own independent\njudgments to bear, giving careful consideration to the\nreasons why a civilized society may accept or reject a\ngiven penalty. See, e.g., Hall v. Florida,        U.S.     ,\n134 S. Ct. 1986, 1993, 1999–2000, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007\n(2014); Atkins v. Virginia, supra, 536 U.S. 312; Thomp-\nson v. Oklahoma, supra, 487 U.S. 822–23. ‘‘Although the\njudgments of legislatures, juries, and prosecutors weigh\nheavily in the balance, it is for [the court] ultimately to\njudge whether the [constitution] permits imposition of\nthe death penalty . . . .’’ Enmund v. Florida, supra,\n458 U.S. 797. Our independent analysis must be\ninformed not only by judicial precedents, but also by\nour own understanding of the rights secured by the\nconstitution. Kennedy v. Louisiana, supra, 554 U.S.\n434. This analysis necessarily encompasses the question\nof whether the penalty at issue promotes any of the\npenal goals that courts and commentators have recog-\nnized as legitimate: deterrence, retribution, incapacita-\ntion, and rehabilitation.18 E.g., Graham v. Florida,\nsupra, 560 U.S. 71. A sentence materially lacking any\nlegitimate penological justification would be nothing\nmore than the ‘‘gratuitous infliction of suffering’’ and,\nby its very nature, disproportionate. Gregg v. Georgia,\nsupra, 183 (opinion announcing judgment).\n                             3\n       Arbitrary or Discriminatory Punishments\n  Third, the eighth amendment prohibits punishments\nthat are imposed in an ‘‘arbitrary and unpredictable\nfashion . . . .’’ (Citations omitted; internal quotation\nmarks omitted.) Kennedy v. Louisiana, supra, 554 U.S.\n436. In the context of capital punishment, the United\nStates Supreme Court has indicated that there are two\ndimensions to this rule.\n   On the one hand, in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S.\n238, 239–40, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 33 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1972), in\nwhich the court held, in a per curiam opinion, that\ncapital punishment as then applied violated the eighth\namendment, and four years later in Gregg v. Georgia,\nsupra, 428 U.S. 153, in which the court held that Geor-\ngia’s revamped capital punishment statute did not\noffend the United States constitution; id., 206–207 (opin-\nion announcing judgment); the court established the\nprinciple that a capital sentencing scheme must provide\nthe sentencing authority sufficient guidance as to which\ncrimes and criminals are death worthy to ensure that\nthe death penalty is not imposed in an arbitrary or\nfreakish manner. Id., 192–95 (opinion announcing judg-\nment). ‘‘To pass constitutional muster, a capital sen-\ntencing scheme must genuinely narrow the class of\npersons eligible for the death penalty and must reason-\nably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence\n\fon the defendant compared to others found guilty of\nmurder.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Lowen-\nfield v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231, 244, 108 S. Ct. 546, 98 L.\nEd. 2d 568 (1988). ‘‘This means that if a [s]tate wishes\nto authorize capital punishment it has a constitutional\nresponsibility to tailor and apply its law in a manner\nthat avoids the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the\ndeath penalty. Part of a [s]tate’s responsibility in this\nregard is to define the crimes for which death may\nbe the sentence in a way that obviates standardless\n[sentencing] discretion. . . . It must channel the sen-\ntencer’s discretion by clear and objective standards that\nprovide specific and detailed guidance, and that make\nrationally reviewable the process for imposing a sen-\ntence of death.’’19 (Citations omitted; footnotes omitted;\ninternal quotation marks omitted.) Godfrey v. Georgia,\n446 U.S. 420, 428, 100 S. Ct. 1759, 64 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1980)\n(plurality opinion).\n   It goes without saying, moreover, that the eighth\namendment is offended not only by the random or arbi-\ntrary imposition of the death penalty, but also by the\ngreater evils of racial discrimination and other forms of\npernicious bias in the selection of who will be executed.\nSee, e.g., Tuilaepa v. California, 512 U.S. 967, 973, 114\nS. Ct. 2630, 129 L. Ed. 2d 750 (1994) (guarding against\nbias or caprice in sentencing is ‘‘controlling objective’’\nof court’s review); see also Graham v. Collins, 506 U.S.\n461, 484, 113 S. Ct. 892, 122 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1993)\n(Thomas, J., concurring) (racial prejudice is ‘‘the para-\ndigmatic capricious and irrational sentencing factor’’);\nFurman v. Georgia, supra, 408 U.S. 242 (Douglas, J.,\nconcurring) (one aim of English Declaration of Rights\nof 1689, in which eighth amendment language origi-\nnated, was to forbid discriminatory penalties); Furman\nv. Georgia, supra, 310 (Stewart, J., concurring) (‘‘if any\nbasis can be discerned for the selection of these few\nto be sentenced to die, it is the constitutionally imper-\nmissible basis of race’’). The eighth amendment, then,\nrequires that any capital sentencing scheme determine\nwhich defendants will be eligible for the death penalty\non the basis of legitimate, rational, nondiscriminatory\nfactors.\n   On the other hand, the United States Supreme Court\nalso has insisted that, at the sentencing stage, juries\nmust have unlimited discretion to assess ‘‘the character\nand record of the individual offender and the circum-\nstances of the particular offense as a constitutionally\nindispensable part of the process of inflicting the pen-\nalty of death.’’ Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S.\n280, 304, 96 S. Ct. 2978, 49 L. Ed. 2d 944 (1976) (opinion\nannouncing judgment). The court in Woodson held that\nthis sort of individualized sentencing determination is\nnecessary to arrive at a just and appropriate sentence\nand to honor the eighth amendment’s ‘‘fundamental\nrespect for humanity . . . .’’ Id. The court also has con-\nsistently indicated that the government has broad dis-\n\fcretion as to whom to prosecute and what charge to\nfile. See, e.g., Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.S. 250, 263, 126\nS. Ct. 1695, 164 L. Ed. 2d 441 (2006); McCleskey v. Kemp,\n481 U.S. 279, 296–97, 107 S. Ct. 1756, 95 L. Ed. 2d 262\n(1987); Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607, 105 S.\nCt. 1524, 84 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1985). As currently construed,\nthen, the federal constitution simultaneously requires\nthat states narrowly limit and carefully define which\noffenders are eligible for capital punishment, while,\nparadoxically, also giving prosecutors and juries,\nrespectively, virtually unfettered discretion whether\nactually to charge defendants with capital crimes and\nwhether to sentence convicted offenders to death.\n   In response to Furman and Gregg, a majority of the\nstates, including Connecticut, drafted new capital pun-\nishment statutes in the 1970s that attempted to define\nwith greater precision that small subset of felonies the\ncommission of which could subject an offender to the\nultimate punishment. During the ensuing four decades,\na majority of the United States Supreme Court has con-\ntinued to hold—in the face of persistent dissent—that\ncapital punishment comports with contemporary Amer-\nican standards of decency, satisfies legitimate penologi-\ncal objectives, and is not imposed in an impermissibly\narbitrary or discriminatory manner. See, e.g., Kansas\nv. Marsh, 548 U.S. 163, 181, 126 S. Ct. 2516, 165 L.\nEd. 2d 429 (2006); McCleskey v. Kemp, supra, 481 U.S.\n291–92. That court, however, never has addressed the\nspecific issue raised by the present appeal, namely,\nwhether a state’s prospective only repeal of its capital\nfelony statutes renders its continued imposition of the\ndeath penalty unconstitutionally excessive and dispro-\nportionate punishment. Indeed, the parties have not\nbrought to our attention any case in which a federal\ncourt has addressed that question.\n                            B\n         Relevant State Constitutional History\n  We next consider our state’s constitutional and pre-\nconstitutional history with respect to the freedom from\ncruel and unusual punishment.20 We consider, first, the\npreconstitutional era and the legal traditions that inform\nthe meaning of the Connecticut constitution and, sec-\nond, the period leading up to the adoption of the Con-\nnecticut constitution of 1818.21\n                            1\n          Preconstitutional Legal Traditions\n   We first consider the preconstitutional roots of the\nfreedom from cruel and unusual punishment in Con-\nnecticut. As early as 1672, our colonial code, which\nincorporated a quasi-constitutional statement of indi-\nvidual liberties, provided that, ‘‘for bodily punishment,\nnone shall be inflicted that are Inhumane, Barbarous\nor Cruel.’’22 The Book of the General Laws for the People\nwithin the Jurisdiction of Connecticut (1672) p. 58\n\f(Laws of Connecticut); see also W. Holdsworth, Law\nand Society in Colonial Connecticut, 1636–1672 (1974)\np. 484 (unpublished doctoral dissertation, Claremont\nGraduate School) (explaining that 1672 code incorpo-\nrated what were, in essence, constitutional statutes).\nThe 1672 code also differed from prior Connecticut\nstatutes in that it (1) forbade the use of torture to extract\nconfessions, (2) placed new restrictions on the use of\ncorporal punishment, and (3) afforded novel procedural\nrights to criminal defendants, especially in capital\ncases.23 See Laws of Connecticut, supra, p. 65; W. Hold-\nsworth, supra, pp. 513–14, 527, 539, 581. Many of these\nprotections, in turn, derived from the Massachusetts\nBody of Liberties of 1641; see C. Collier, ‘‘The Common\nLaw and Individual Rights in Connecticut Before the\nFederal Bill of Rights,’’ 76 Conn. B.J. 1, 12 (2002); a\ndeclaration of rights that was far more progressive24\nthan English law at that time.25 See A. Granucci, ‘‘ ‘Nor\nCruel and Unusual Punishments Inflicted:’ The Original\nMeaning,’’ 57 Calif. L. Rev. 839, 851 (1969).\n   In perhaps the most substantial scholarly account of\nthe early legal traditions of the Connecticut colony,\nWilliam K. Holdsworth offers a window into the original\nmeaning of Connecticut’s inceptive prohibition of cruel\npunishment. Holdsworth describes the years leading up\nto the adoption of the 1672 code as a key formative\nperiod in the colony’s legal history. W. Holdsworth,\nsupra, p. x. ‘‘The decade [of 1662 through 1672] was\na watershed in the early history of Connecticut,’’ he\nexplains, ‘‘a period of profound intellectual, social, eco-\nnomic, and political change that set the colony on a\ncourse of its own.’’ Id., p. 582. During this period of\n‘‘extraordinarily rapid and vital change’’; id., p. 479; a\nnew generation of leaders restructured the colony’s\npolitical and judicial systems. See id., pp. 479–80, 547–\n48. The legislature ‘‘made fairer use of its juries . . .\ngave formal recognition to numerous civil liberties, dis-\nplayed a greater awareness of individual rights, dealt\nless severely with most criminal offenders than before,\nand, either formally or in practice, reduced the penalties\nfor several capital crimes.’’ Id., pp. 547–48. In the pro-\ncess, Connecticut’s new leaders bequeathed to its citi-\nzens a ‘‘legacy of moderation . . . .’’ Id., p. 545.\n   During the decade, dramatic shifts in public, judicial,\nand executive attitudes toward crime and punishment\nresulted in fundamental changes in how the criminal\nlaw was applied, changes that directly foreshadowed\nthe prohibition against cruel punishment and other free-\ndoms that the legislature enshrined in the 1772 code.\n‘‘[N]ew social conditions and new attitudes on the part\nof the people and their leaders’’ that emerged during\nthe decade of 1662 through 1672 were mirrored by a\ngrowing judicial leniency.26 Id., p. 537. Magistrates\nenjoyed considerable latitude in enforcing the nascent\ncriminal code during this period, and Holdsworth sug-\ngests that the penalties that were actually imposed may\n\fprovide a more accurate picture of Connecticut’s early\nlegal landscape, and particularly of public attitudes\nregarding what constituted acceptable punishment,\nthan the first legal codes themselves provided. See id.,\npp. 353–54. Although the punishments prescribed often\nwere severe, the criminal law generally was enforced\nwithout ‘‘needless cruelty’’ in the 1660s; id., p. 286; and,\nover the course of the decade, courts became increas-\ningly lenient in the sanctions they imposed. See id., pp.\n286–87, 363, 576. Whipping began to fall out of favor,\nfor example, with fines—and, in the case of fornication,\nmandatory marriage—emerging as the primary sanction\nfor many sexual crimes and crimes against property.\nSee id., pp. 292, 295–300, 313–17. More brutal forms of\ncorporal punishment ‘‘all but disappeared . . . .’’ Id., p.\n364. Christopher Collier, Connecticut’s state historian,\nobserved that, ‘‘through the imposition of lenient pun-\nishments outside of statutory specifications, nonen-\nforcement of restrictive statutes, a tendency to let local\nconsensus be their guide, and a punctilious regard for\ndue process . . . Connecticut’s jurists lightened the\nload of ancient oppressive laws . . . .’’ C. Collier,\nsupra, 76 Conn. B.J. 49–50.\n   ‘‘[This unmistakable] tendency toward judicial mod-\neration in the use of physical punishments in the years\n[1662 through 1675] . . . is all the more pronounced\nwhen we consider capital crimes and capital punish-\nment.’’ W. Holdsworth, supra, p. 365. As public attitudes\nevolved, magistrates grew more reluctant to inflict capi-\ntal punishment and came to believe that the death pen-\nalty should be reserved for only the most heinous and\nuniversally condemned offenses. See id., pp. 382, 431.\nBefore adultery was demoted from a capital offense to\na lesser crime in 1672; C. Collier, supra, 76 Conn. B.J.\n19; for example, ‘‘magistrates displayed marked reluc-\ntance to inflict death for the offense’’; W. Holdsworth,\nsupra, p. 533; and courts found ways to avoid imposing\nthe statutory death penalty on adulterers. C. Collier,\nsupra, 19 n.42. By the 1670s, courts also were demon-\nstrating less willingness ‘‘to exact the full measure of\nretribution’’ for sodomy and other capital crimes. W.\nHoldsworth, supra, p. 418; see also id., pp. 371, 519. In\n1677, for example, a jury declined to convict Nicholas\nSension of capital sodomy, despite what Holdsworth\nsuggests was clear evidence of his guilt. See id., pp.\n418–19.\n   Even more than the courts, however, it was Connecti-\ncut’s forward thinking governor, John Winthrop, Jr., a\nleading colonial physician and scientist, who was\nresponsible for the restraint that the colony began to\nexercise in the 1660s with respect to capital crimes\nranging from witchcraft and blasphemy, on the one\nhand, to adultery, sodomy, and rape, on the other. See\nid., pp. 522–25, 579–80. Governor Winthrop’s ‘‘legendary\ntoleration and the force of his moderating influence\nover the affairs of his colony’’ effectively extinguished\n\fthe colony’s hysteria over witchcraft, and ultimately\nresulted in the delisting of adultery as a capital crime\nin 1672.27 Id., p. 580. Holdsworth concludes that this\ndramatic evolution in public and judicial attitudes\ntoward crime and penology during the 1660s directly\ninfluenced the decision in 1672 to adopt key freedoms\nthat Massachusetts afforded its criminal defendants,\nincluding the freedoms from inhumane, barbarous and\ncruel punishments, in addition to torture, when formu-\nlating the new colonial statutes. See id., pp. 513, 537,\n539, 582. ‘‘The [c]ode of 1672 expounded in the language\nof law the new ideal of a new generation, a more moder-\nate, more explicit, more progressive conception’’ of\ncrime and punishment. Id., p. 582. ‘‘By giving formal\nlegal recognition to many of the changes that had tran-\nspired during the preceding decade,’’ Holdsworth\nexplains, ‘‘the [c]ode of 1672 reflected to a greater\nextent than its predecessor the essential institutional\ncharacter that was to mark Connecticut for the remain-\nder of the colonial period.’’ Id., p. 583.\n   In addition to abolishing such brutal forms of capital\npunishment as flogging to death and breaking on the\nwheel, the 1672 code lessened the severity of many\ncriminal sanctions, reducing the maximum number of\nlashes that could be imposed for noncapital crimes and\nreplacing whipping with imprisonment as the penalty\nfor others. See id., pp. 513, 537–39, 576. Moreover,\nalthough legislators did retain severe corporal punish-\nments such as branding, which replaced death as the\npenalty for those crimes that were decapitalized in 1672,\ncourt records indicate that such punishments were\nrarely if ever inflicted. See id., pp. 535, 576.\n   It is apparent from this history that, long before the\nadoption of either the federal or state constitution, Con-\nnecticut citizens enjoyed a quasi-constitutional freedom\nfrom cruel punishment, one that reflected our unique\nsocial and political traditions and that far exceeded the\nprotections recognized in England at the time. These\nprotections were enshrined in Connecticut’s early con-\nstitutional statutes and common law, and, from the\nstart, were intimately tied to the principles of due\nprocess.\n                            2\n                          1818\n  We next consider the historical circumstances lead-\ning up to the adoption of the state constitution in 1818.\nThe late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries wit-\nnessed the twilight of a premodern system of criminal\njustice in the United States. See generally note, ‘‘The\nEighth Amendment, Proportionality, and the Changing\nMeaning of ‘Punishments,’ ’’ 122 Harv. L. Rev. 960\n(2009). The rapid evolution in penology that occurred\nin the decades following the founding was especially\npronounced in Connecticut. The late eighteenth and\n\fearly nineteenth centuries in Connecticut witnessed a\npronounced liberalization in public, legislative, and judi-\ncial attitudes toward crime and punishment. The period\nhas been described as one characterized by penological\nreform, a broader commitment to human rights, and\nthe first serious public questioning of the moral legiti-\nmacy of capital punishment. See L. Goodheart, The\nSolemn Sentence of Death: Capital Punishment in Con-\nnecticut (2011) pp. 69–70. This time between the adop-\ntion of the federal and state constitutions also saw an\nemerging awareness of and compassion for ‘‘the fate of\nthe condemned perpetrator.’’ Id., p. 85. These changes\ncoincided with the reopening of the newly established\nNewgate Prison (Newgate) in 1790, which provided the\nopportunity to impose incarceration as an alternative\nto more severe traditional punishments. See id., p. 75.\n   During this period, Connecticut’s legislators, jurists,\nand citizens refined their understanding of what consti-\ntuted cruel and unusual punishment. Nowhere was this\nmore apparent than in the repudiation of corporal pun-\nishment as a legitimate penal sanction. ‘‘With the estab-\nlishment of a [s]tate prison, many of the barbarous\npunishments [began] to disappear from the statute\nbook, replaced by confinement for a term of years.’’\nJudicial and Civil History of Connecticut (D. Loomis &\nJ. Calhoun eds., 1895) p. 98. In 1808, for instance, ‘‘legis-\nlators crafted a less draconian statute for the regulation\nof female sexuality’’; L. Goodheart, supra, p. 77; and,\nby the middle of the next decade, a broad consensus\nhad emerged in the state that corporal punishment of\nany sort was degrading and debasing. See id., pp. 77–78.\nWhen the criminal code was revised in 1821 to comport\nwith the state constitution of 1818, bodily punishment\nwas largely abolished. See Judicial and Civil History of\nConnecticut, supra, pp. 98–99. The last vestige of the\nold system, the whipping post, survived only one decade\nmore as a punishment for theft.28 Id., p. 99.\n   Connecticut’s earliest reported judicial decisions\nindicate that the courts, like the legislature, had begun\nto adopt a broader conception of cruel and unusual\npunishment in the years leading up to the adoption of\nthe 1818 constitution. In State v. Smith, 5 Day (Conn.)\n175 (1811), for example, the defendant argued that\nimposing successive terms of imprisonment in Newgate\nfor multiple incidents of counterfeiting was ‘‘novel,\nwithout precedent, cruel and illegal.’’ Id., 178. A majority\nof this court ultimately denied the requested relief, but\nonly because it concluded that ‘‘[n]o injustice [was]\ndone to the prisoner; and this proceeding [was] neither\nnew, nor without precedent; such [had] been the usage\nof our courts, for many years past, in this state.’’ Id.,\n179. Indeed, the majority went out of its way to note\nthat courts ‘‘are bound to become acquainted with the\nsituation and circumstances of the prisoner, when they\npronounce the sentence. If through infirmity, it should\nappear to be inhuman or improper to confine him to\n\fhard labor, in Newgate, immediately upon conviction,\nit would be the duty of the court to postpone the com-\nmencement of his confinement, to a future day.’’ Id.\n   That Connecticut had developed by the turn of the\nnineteenth century a more expansive conception of\nwhat constituted impermissibly cruel punishment is fur-\nther revealed in the writings of former Chief Justice\nZephaniah Swift. Swift did not hesitate to condemn as\n‘‘cruel and illiberal’’ not only corporal punishment and\nthe like, but also what he saw as outmoded and unjust\ncommon-law traditions. 2 Z. Swift, A System of the Laws\nof the State of Connecticut (1796) p. 398. Practices\nranging from false imprisonment, to the denial of\ndefense counsel in capital cases, to punishing a parent\nfor harboring a fugitive child were all, to Swift, exam-\nples of cruelties that the law ought not countenance.\nSee id., pp. 58, 371–72, 398–99. Swift was especially\ntroubled by the traditional English punishment for sui-\ncide—forfeiture of the deceased’s estate and burial on\na public highway with a stake driven through the body—\nwhich he characterized as the product of a ‘‘barbarous\nperiod of superstition, and cruelty.’’ Id., p. 304.29\n   Nor was capital punishment immune from these\nbroader currents in Connecticut’s criminal justice sys-\ntem. Opposition to capital punishment gained traction\nin the decade before the adoption of the 1818 state\nconstitution. In 1808, then Judge Swift instructed a\ngrand jury that courts were adopting a ‘‘milder practice’’\nin applying the capital law. (Internal quotation marks\nomitted.) L. Goodheart, supra, p. 76; see also id., p.\n71. The following year, in a speech to the legislature,\nLieutenant Governor John Treadwell shared his view\nthat ‘‘[c]onfinement in Newgate . . . [was] terrible, but\nnot cruel; and it [was] probably more effectual to pre-\nvent [atrocious] crimes, than capital punishment\n. . . .’’ J. Treadwell, ‘‘Lieutenant Governor Treadwell’s\nSpeech to the Legislature of Connecticut: October,\n1809,’’ The American Register, January 1, 1810, p. 6.\nAlthough he lamented that there were few penitents\namong the inmates housed at Newgate, Treadwell pro-\nposed that providing them with Bibles and religious\ninstruction might have a beneficial effect. See id.\n   Finally, in a series of events that culminated in the\ndecision to convene a constitutional convention, the\nlegislature voted in 1816 to grant a new trial for Peter\nLung, who had been condemned to die for the murder\nof his wife. J. Zeldes, ‘‘Connecticut’s Most Memorable\n‘Good for Nothing Rascal’ in This ‘Land of Steady Hab-\nits,’ ’’ 80 Conn. B.J. 367, 380–81, 393–94 (2006). The\ndeciding vote in favor of a retrial was cast by a member\nof the governing council who ‘‘was not willing that a\nman should be [hanged as a result of] his vote.’’30 (Inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 394. Following his\nconviction upon retrial, Lung was in fact hanged. The\nfollowing week, the Middlesex Gazette published an\n\farticle remarking on the ‘‘infrequency of capital punish-\nment’’ and observing that the ‘‘[behavior] of this unfortu-\nnate sufferer on this trying occasion, was such as to\nattract the tenderest sympathy of every rational\nbeholder.’’ ‘‘Execution,’’ Middlesex Gazzette, reprinted\nin The Weekly Recorder: A Newpaper Conveying\nImportant Intelligence and Other Useful Matter Under\nthe Three General Heads of Theology, Literature and\nNational Affairs, July 31, 1816, p. 8.\n   In summary, it is clear that, from the earliest days of\nthe colonies, and extending until the adoption of the\nstate constitution in 1818,31 the people of Connecticut\nsaw themselves as enjoying significant freedoms from\ncruel and unusual punishment, freedoms that were safe-\nguarded by our courts and enshrined in our state’s pre-\nconstitutional statutory and common law. That our\nhistory reveals a particular sensitivity to such concerns\nwarrants our scrupulous and independent review of\nallegedly cruel and unusual practices and punishments,\nand informs our analysis thereof.\n                            C\n             Relevant Constitutional Text\n   We next consider the relevant provisions of the state\nconstitution. In light of our state’s firm and enduring\ncommitment to the principle that even those offenders\nwho commit the most heinous crimes should not be\nsubjected to inhumane, barbarous, or cruel punishment,\nthe question naturally arises why the framers of the\n1818 constitution decided to embed these traditional\nliberties in our dual due process clauses; see Conn.\nConst. (1818), art. I, §§ 9 and 10; rather than in an\nexpress punishments clause. Although there is no indi-\ncation that that question was debated during the 1818\nconstitutional convention, we find guidance in the\nbroader legal history of turn of the century Connecticut.\n    Connecticut was among three of the original thirteen\nstates that chose not to officially ratify the eighth\namendment or, indeed, any of the first ten amendments\nto the federal constitution.32 C. Leedham, Our Changing\nConstitution (1964) p. 41. In 1787, the state’s representa-\ntives to the federal constitutional convention had\nargued vehemently against the need for a bill of rights.\nSee C. Collier, supra, 57, 67. ‘‘In Connecticut, unlike\nthose states that had recently been under the domina-\ntion of royal and proprietary governors and appointed\nupper houses, limited government was taken for\ngranted. Calvinist theory described limited government,\n[Connecticut’s] Fundamental Orders [of 1639] pro-\nclaimed it, the [Connecticut] Charter [of 1662] estab-\nlished it, tradition demanded it, common law enforced\nit, and frequent elections guaranteed it.’’ Id., 53. During\nthe late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, for\nexample, Connecticut courts routinely safeguarded the\nbasic rights enshrined in the federal Bill of Rights on\n\fthe basis of natural rights or common law, without the\nneed for any formal constitutional sanction. See id., 31,\n65. Moreover, there was a particular fear in Connecticut\nthat the adoption of a written bill of rights would imply,\nby negative inference, that citizens were no longer enti-\ntled to unenumerated protections long enshrined in the\nstate’s common law.33 See id., 56–59. ‘‘A strong state-\nwide consensus, then, held that no bill of rights was\nnecessary and, indeed, might even limit individual lib-\nerty.’’ Id., 57.\n   Although this viewpoint had become less prevalent\nby 1818, when Connecticut adopted its first formal con-\nstitution; see id., 68–69; it retained many ‘‘influential\nadherents . . . .’’ Id., 69. This likely accounts for the\nfact that certain protections long entrenched in the\nstate’s constitutional common law were not expressly\nenumerated in the new written constitution. Indeed,\nin an 1821 speech, Governor Oliver Wolcott called on\nConnecticut’s courts to articulate and protect the many\nnatural rights that remained unenumerated by either\nconstitution or statute. See id., 37–38.\n   Accordingly, in Moore v. Ganim, 233 Conn. 557, 660\nA.2d 742 (1995), we ‘‘assume[d] that the framers\nbelieved that individuals would continue to possess\ncertain natural rights even if those rights were not enu-\nmerated in the written constitution. On the basis of this\nassumption, we [would] not draw firm conclusions from\nthe silence of the constitutional text. . . . Rather, in\ndetermining whether unenumerated rights were incor-\nporated into the constitution, we must focus on the\nframers’ understanding of whether a particular right\nwas part of the natural law, i.e., on the framers’ under-\nstanding of whether the particular right was so funda-\nmental to an ordered society that it did not require\nexplicit enumeration. We can discern the framers’\nunderstanding, of course, only by examining the histori-\ncal sources.’’ (Emphasis omitted.) Id., 601.\n   In her dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Rogers cites\nto Cologne v. Westfarms Associates, 192 Conn. 48, 60,\n469 A.2d 1201 (1984), for the proposition that, by the\ntime the 1818 constitution was adopted, the view that\nthe basic liberties of the people should be enshrined\nin a written constitution had come to prevail in Connect-\nicut. See footnote 6 of Chief Justice Rogers’ dissenting\nopinion. Chief Justice Rogers, however, neglects to con-\nsider an adjacent passage in Cologne that recognizes\nthat ‘‘[a]n opposing view was expressed that such a\ndetailed specification of individual rights was superflu-\nous and tended to abridge them, because all governmen-\ntal powers not granted by the constitution were\nreserved to the people.’’ Cologne v. Westfarms Associ-\nates, supra, 60. In fact, history reveals that article first\nof the 1818 constitution was born of and reflected a\ncompromise between these two constitutional philoso-\nphies. See R. Purcell, Connecticut in Transition: 1775–\n\f1818 (New Ed. 1963) pp. 241–42 (discussing opposition\nto bill of rights at constitutional convention and\nimplying that ultimate decision of which freedoms to\nenshrine and which to exclude was somewhat haphaz-\nard); J. Trumbull, Historical Notes on the Constitutions\nof Connecticut and on the Constitutional Convention\nof 1818 (1873) p. 53 (identifying prominent delegates\nto convention who opposed incorporation of any bill\nof rights in state constitution); J. Trumbull, supra, p.\n56 (recognizing ultimate compromise). For these rea-\nsons, we find little merit in the argument that the deci-\nsion of the framers of the Connecticut constitution not\nto include an express bar on cruel and unusual punish-\nment somehow suggests that this liberty was uncher-\nished.\n                              D\n           Relevant Connecticut Precedents\n   Turning to the next Geisler factor, namely, relevant\nConnecticut precedents, we write on a relatively blank\nslate with respect to cruel and unusual punishment.\nNevertheless, since this court first recognized in Ross\nthat our due process clauses independently prohibit\ncruel and unusual punishment; see State v. Ross, supra,\n230 Conn. 246–47; we have begun to carve out the broad\ncontours of that prohibition. In Ross itself, as we have\nnoted, we adopted the aforementioned federal frame-\nwork for evaluating challenges to allegedly cruel and\nunusual punishments. See id., 252. Specifically, we rec-\nognized that, under the state constitution, whether a\nchallenged punishment is cruel and unusual is to be\njudged according to the ‘‘evolving standards of human\ndecency’’; id., 251; and that those standards are reflected\nnot only in constitutional and legislative text, but also\n‘‘in our history and in the teachings of the jurisprudence\nof our sister states as well as that of the federal courts.’’\nId. In Ross, we also rejected the theory that ‘‘article first,\n§ 9, confers the authority to determine what constitutes\ncruel and unusual punishment solely on the Connecticut\nlegislature and not on the courts.’’ Id., 248. ‘‘Although\nwe should exercise our authority with great restraint,’’\nwe explained, ‘‘this court cannot abdicate its nondelega-\nble responsibility for the adjudication of constitutional\nrights.’’ Id., 249.\n   Subsequently, in Rizzo I, we characterized it as ‘‘set-\ntled constitutional doctrine that, independently of fed-\neral constitutional requirements, our due process\nclauses, because they prohibit cruel and unusual pun-\nishment, impose constitutional limits on the imposition\nof the death penalty.’’ State v. Rizzo, supra, 266 Conn.\n206. In that case, we recognized that there is an ‘‘over-\narching concern for consistency and reliability in the\nimposition of the death penalty’’ under our state consti-\ntution. (Emphasis omitted.) Id., 233. Accordingly, in\norder to avoid having to resolve the state constitutional\nquestion raised in that case, we construed General Stat-\n\futes (Rev. to 1997) § 53a-46a to require that a jury must\nfind beyond a reasonable doubt that the death penalty\nis the appropriate penalty.34 See id., 234.\n   Most recently, in State v. Rizzo, 303 Conn. 71, 184–\n201, 31 A.3d 1094 (2011) (Rizzo II), cert. denied,\nU.S.     , 133 S. Ct. 133, 184 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2012), we\nengaged in a full analysis of the constitutionality of the\ndeath penalty pursuant to the state constitution. At that\ntime, we reiterated that, ‘‘in determining whether a par-\nticular punishment is cruel and unusual in violation of\n[state] constitutional standards, we must look beyond\nhistorical conceptions to the evolving standards of\ndecency that mark the progress of a maturing society.’’35\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 187–88. We also\n‘‘recognize[d] that assessing the propriety of [a punish-\nment] is not exclusively the domain of the legislature,\nand that this court has an independent duty to deter-\nmine that the penalty remains constitutionally viable\nas the sensibilities of our citizens evolve.’’ Id., 197. We\nreturn to these well established principles in parts II\nand III of this opinion.\n                            E\n          Persuasive Sister State Precedents\n    The unique structure and text of the Connecticut\nconstitution of 1965, in which the freedom from cruel\nand unusual punishment is embeded in our dual due\nprocess clauses rather than in a distinct punishments\nclause, mean that sister state authority is less directly\nrelevant than in cases in which we have construed other\nconstitutional provisions. We do agree with our sister\ncourts, however, that, under the state constitution, the\npertinent standards by which we judge the fairness,\ndecency, and efficacy of a punishment are necessarily\nthose of Connecticut. Although regional, national, and\ninternational norms may inform our analysis; see, e.g.,\nState v. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 188–96; the ultimate\nquestion is whether capital punishment has come to\nbe excessive and disproportionate in Connecticut. Cf.\nFleming v. Zant, 259 Ga. 687, 690, 386 S.E.2d 339 (1989)\n(‘‘[t]he standard of decency that is relevant to the inter-\npretation of the prohibition against cruel and unusual\npunishment found in the Georgia [c]onstitution is the\nstandard of the people of Georgia, not the national\nstandard’’ [internal quotation marks omitted]); District\nAttorney v. Watson, 381 Mass. 648, 661, 664–65, 411\nN.E.2d 1274 (1980) (holding that death penalty violated\nstate constitution on basis of contemporary standards\nof decency in Massachusetts);36 J. Acker & E. Walsh,\n‘‘Challenging the Death Penalty under State Constitu-\ntions,’’ 42 Vand. L. Rev. 1299, 1325 (1989) (‘‘[e]ven if\nstate courts are guided by the doctrinal analysis now\nassociated with the eighth amendment, their frame of\nreference for measuring evolving standards of decency\nmust be within state borders’’ [internal quotation marks\nomitted]); cf. also Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public\n\fHealth, 289 Conn. 135, 188–213, 957 A.2d 407 (2008) (in\ncontext of determining whether gay persons are entitled\nto heightened protection for equal protection purposes\nunder state constitution, court assessed their political\npower or lack thereof in Connecticut). Justice Zarella’s\narguments to the contrary notwithstanding, we also\nagree with those courts that have determined that it\nis perfectly reasonable to apply the federal evolving\nstandards of decency rubric to cruel and unusual pun-\nishment claims brought under a state constitution. See,\ne.g., People v. Anderson, 6 Cal. 3d 628, 647–48, 493 P.2d\n880, 100 Cal. Rptr. 152, cert. denied, 406 U.S. 958, 92 S.\nCt. 2060, 32 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1972);37 Fleming v. Zant,\nsupra, 689–90; District Attorney v. Watson, supra, 661–\n62. Indeed, we are not aware of any court that has\nconcluded that the federal evolving standards of\ndecency rubric is inapplicable to state constitutional\nclaims.\n                            F\n                       Conclusion\n   To summarize our analysis of the first five Geisler\nfactors, when construing the state constitutional free-\ndom from cruel and unusual punishment, we broadly\nadopt the framework that the federal courts have used\nto evaluate eighth amendment challenges. We apply this\nframework, however, with respect to the constitutional\nfacts as they exist in Connecticut and mindful of our\nstate’s unique and expansive constitutional and precon-\nstitutional history. To the extent that the sixth Geisler\nfactor—economic and sociological norms and policy\nconsiderations—is relevant, we take such considera-\ntions into account in parts II and III of this opinion, in\nwhich we address the defendant’s specific constitu-\ntional challenge.38\n                            II\n    THE DEATH PENALTY FAILS TO COMPORT\n      WITH CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS\n                OF DECENCY\n   We next consider whether the death penalty, as cur-\nrently imposed in Connecticut, and following the enact-\nment of P.A. 12-5, is so out of step with our contem-\nporary standards of decency as to violate the state con-\nstitutional ban on excessive and disproportionate pun-\nishment. We conclude that it is.\n   As we previously noted, both the federal and state\nconstitutions prohibit the imposition of any punishment\nthat is not proportioned and graduated to the offense\nof conviction. Whether a punishment is disproportion-\nate and excessive is to be judged by the contemporary,\n‘‘evolving standards of decency that mark the progress\nof a maturing society.’’ Trop v. Dulles, supra, 356 U.S.\n101 (plurality opinion); accord State v. Rizzo, supra,\n303 Conn. 187–88. In other words, the constitutional\n\ftened to the obsolete but may acquire meaning as public\nopinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice.’’\nWeems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 378, 30 S. Ct. 544,\n54 L. Ed. 793 (1910); see also Hall v. Florida, supra, 134\nS. Ct. 1992 (‘‘[t]he [e]ighth [a]mendment’s protection of\ndignity reflects the [n]ation we have been, the [n]ation\nwe are, and the [n]ation we aspire to be’’). Because the\nlegal standard is an evolving one, it is both necessary\nand appropriate for us to consider the issue anew, in\nlight of relevant recent developments, when it is\nraised.39 See State v. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 187–88.\n   On only two prior occasions has this court considered\nin any depth whether capital punishment violates the\nstate constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punish-\nment. See State v. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 184–201;\nState v. Ross, supra, 230 Conn. 248–52. In those cases,\nwe considered—and at times blurred the lines\nbetween—two distinct constitutional challenges: (1)\nthe claim that capital punishment is inherently barbaric\npunishment and, therefore, offends the constitution at\nall times and under all circumstances; and (2) the claim\nthat, although capital punishment may once have com-\nported with constitutional requirements, our state’s\nstandards of decency have evolved such that execution\nnow constitutes excessive and disproportionate punish-\nment. See State v. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 187–88; State\nv. Ross, supra, 248, 250. The dissenting justice in Ross\nlikewise challenged capital punishment along both\nparameters. Compare State v. Ross, supra, 298 (Berdon,\nJ., dissenting in part) (‘‘[t]he punishment of death is\ninherently degrading to the dignity of a human being’’),\nwith id., 301–313 (Berdon, J., dissenting in part)\n(arguing that, inter alia, public no longer supports death\npenalty, penalty is unfairly applied, and recent evidence\ndoes not bear out deterrent effect).\n   The majority in Ross—consisting of two members of\nthis court and two Appellate Court judges sitting by\ndesignation—focused its attention on the per se ques-\ntion of whether the ‘‘imposition of the death penalty\ninvariably constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.’’\nId., 245. The majority evaluated the constitutionality of\nthe death penalty under the rubric of the six Geisler\nfactors. Id., 249–52. Dispensing with five of the factors\nin a single paragraph, the majority in Ross afforded each\nconsideration no more than one sentence of attention.40\nSee id., 249–50. The sixth Geisler factor, which encom-\npasses the full panoply of economic and sociological\nnorms and policy considerations, received only slightly\nmore attention. See id., 251–52.\n   With respect to the contention that the death penalty\nis fundamentally offensive to evolving standards of\ndecency, the majority dismissed the claim of the defen-\ndant, Michael B. Ross, with a one sentence quote from\nthe New Jersey Supreme Court: ‘‘When, in the course\nof a decade, thirty-seven states call for the death pen-\n\falty, the probability that the legislature of each state\naccurately reflects its community’s standards\napproaches certainty.’’ (Internal quotation marks omit-\nted.) Id., 251, quoting State v. Ramseur, 106 N.J. 123,\n173, 524 A.2d 188 (1987). In his lengthy dissent, Justice\nBerdon lamented that the majority had given so novel\nand weighty a question such ‘‘cursory analysis . . . .’’41\nState v. Ross, supra, 230 Conn. 295 (Berdon, J., dis-\nsenting in part).\n   Subsequently, this court reiterated the holding of, or\nmerely cited to Ross, without any further elaboration,\nin one-half dozen cases presenting facial challenges to\nthe death penalty under the state constitution. See State\nv. Colon, 272 Conn. 106, 383, 864 A.2d 666 (2004), cert.\ndenied, 546 U.S. 848, 126 S. Ct. 102, 163 L. Ed. 2d 116\n(2005); State v. Breton, 264 Conn. 327, 418, 824 A.2d\n778, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1055, 124 S. Ct. 819, 157 L.\nEd. 2d 708 (2003); State v. Reynolds, 264 Conn. 1, 236,\n836 A.2d 224 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S.\nCt. 1614, 158 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2004); State v. Cobb, 251\nConn. 285, 497, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S.\n841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000); State v.\nWebb, 238 Conn. 389, 402–405, 680 A.2d 147 (1996);42\nState v. Breton, 235 Conn. 206, 217–18, 663 A.2d 1026\n(1995). Accordingly, it was not until 2011, in Rizzo II,\nthat we first seriously explored the scope of the state\nconstitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nwith regard to the modern death penalty. See State v.\nRizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 184–201.\n   In Rizzo II, as in Ross, we had no difficulty rejecting\nthe defendant’s facial challenge, reasoning that a pen-\nalty that is referenced explicitly in the state constitution\ncannot have been unconstitutional at all times and\nunder all circumstances. See id., 188. In that case, how-\never, we also recognized that the fact that capital pun-\nishment has been practiced throughout much of our\nstate’s history and was considered constitutional in\n1818 says little about its legal status two centuries later.\nSee id., 187–88. Rather, under the governing legal frame-\nwork, ‘‘we must look beyond historical conceptions to\nthe evolving standards of decency that mark the prog-\nress of a maturing society. . . . This is because [t]he\nstandard of extreme cruelty is not merely descriptive,\nbut necessarily embodies a moral judgment. The stan-\ndard itself remains the same, but its applicability must\nchange as the basic mores of society change.’’ (Internal\nquotation marks omitted.) Id.; see also People v. Ander-\nson, supra, 6 Cal. 3d 637–39 (incidental references to\ndeath penalty in state constitution merely acknowledge\nthat penalty was in use at time of drafting and do not\nenshrine its constitutional status as standards of\ndecency evolve); District Attorney v. Watson, supra,\n381 Mass. 660–62 (interpretation of state constitutional\nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment is not\nstatic and depends on contemporary moral standards).\n\f   In Rizzo II, we also recognized that whether the death\npenalty constitutes excessive and disproportionate pun-\nishment is a subtler and more nuanced question than\nthe majority in Ross had acknowledged. Our under-\nstanding of what constitutes excessive punishment is\ninformed not only by the laws on the books, both in\nConnecticut and elsewhere, but also by developments\nin how those laws are applied by prosecutors and sen-\ntencing juries. See State v. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn.\n188–98. Accordingly, we undertook a more sweeping\nreview of contemporary social mores and the actual\nimplementation of capital punishment at the state,\nnational and even international levels. See id. We ulti-\nmately concluded, however, that ‘‘there remain[ed]\npowerful evidence of strong public support for the\ndeath penalty in the form of long-standing laws enacted\nby the democratically elected representatives of this\nstate and other jurisdictions within the United States\n. . . .’’ Id., 198. Notwithstanding various indications\nthat there had been a drop off in support for the death\npenalty, we perceived no ‘‘dramatic shift’’ in the consti-\ntutional or legislative landscape. (Internal quotation\nmarks omitted.) Id., 191.\n   We first take this opportunity to clarify that, although\na sudden sea change in public opinion would be suffi-\ncient to demonstrate a constitutionally significant shift\nin contemporary standards of decency, such a dramatic\nshift is not necessary for us to recognize that a punish-\nment has become repugnant to the state constitution.\nIf the legally salient metaphor is the evolution of our\nstandards of decency, then a gradual but inexorable\nextinction may be as significant as the sociological\nequivalent of the meteor that, it is believed, suddenly\nended the reign of the dinosaurs. In any event, new\ninsights into the history of capital punishment in Con-\nnecticut, in tandem with the legislature’s 2012 decision\nto abolish the death penalty prospectively, persuade us\nthat we now have not only a clear picture of the long,\nsteady devolution of capital punishment in our state,\nand, indeed, throughout New England, but also a dra-\nmatic and definitive statement by our elected officials\nthat the death penalty no longer can be justified as a\nnecessary or appropriate tool of justice.\n   This court and the United States Supreme Court have\nlooked to five objective indicia of society’s evolving\nstandards of decency: (1) the historical development\nof the punishment at issue; (2) legislative enactments;\n(3) the current practice of prosecutors and sentencing\njuries; (4) the laws and practices of other jurisdictions;\nand (5) the opinions and recommendations of profes-\nsional associations.43 See, e.g., Graham v. Florida,\nsupra, 560 U.S. 61–67; Atkins v. Virginia, supra, 536\nU.S. 311–16; Thompson v. Oklahoma, supra, 487 U.S.\n830; Enmund v. Florida, supra, 458 U.S. 788–89; State\nv. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 187–96. We consider each\n\ffactor in turn.\n                             A\n                  Historical Development\n  We begin by considering ‘‘the historical development\nof the punishment at issue . . . .’’ Enmund v. Florida,\nsupra, 458 U.S. 788. The history of capital punishment\nin Connecticut is especially important both because\nsubstantial new historical information has become\navailable in recent years and because the ultimate legal\nquestion—whether the death penalty remains conso-\nnant with our evolving standards of decency following\nthe enactment of P.A. 12-5—necessarily requires that\nwe consider the broader historical perspective. We can-\nnot ascertain how our moral standards have evolved\nwithout first understanding what they once were.44\n   Our task in this regard has been greatly facilitated\nby Professor Lawrence B. Goodheart, who recently pub-\nlished the first comprehensive history of capital punish-\nment in Connecticut in ‘‘The Solemn Sentence of Death:\nCapital Punishment in Connecticut.’’ Beginning with the\nfounding of the Connecticut and New Haven colonies\nin the 1600s, and proceeding methodically through the\nfirst decade of the current millennium, Goodheart’s\naward winning45 book traces nearly 400 years of the\nstate’s implementation and public perception of the\ndeath penalty. Two recurring themes emerge from this\nsurvey. First, the acceptability of imposing death as a\nform of judicial punishment has declined steadily over\nConnecticut’s nearly 400 year history. Secularization,\nevolving moral standards, new constitutional and pro-\ncedural protections, and the availability of incarcera-\ntion as a viable alternative to execution have resulted\nin capital punishment being available for far fewer\ncrimes and criminals, and being imposed far less fre-\nquently, with a concomitant deterioration in public\nacceptance. Second, what has not changed is that,\nthroughout every period of our state’s history, the death\npenalty has been imposed disproportionately on those\nwhom society has marginalized socially, politically, and\neconomically: people of color, the poor and unedu-\ncated, and unpopular immigrant and ethnic groups. It\nalways has been easier for us to execute those we see\nas inferior or less intrinsically worthy.\n  Beginning with the seventeenth century, Goodheart\nexplains that early Connecticut penal statutes reflected\nthe Puritans’ deep-seated commitment to the Mosaic\nlegal code of the Old Testament. See L. Goodheart,\nsupra, pp. 10–12. In 1656, the New Haven colony recog-\nnized twenty-three different capital crimes. Id., p. 12.\nAn individual could be executed for conduct offending\nthe colony’s strict religious sensibilities (e.g., idolatry,\nwitchcraft, blasphemy, cursing or smiting a parent, defi-\nance by a rebellious son, profaning the Sabbath); for\nbehavior deemed to be sexually deviant (adultery, mas-\n\fturbation, bestiality, heterosexual and homosexual sod-\nomy, incest); for repeated incidents of burglary or\nrobbery; as well as for rape, rebellion, and killing of\nvarious sorts. See id. From the founding of the colonies\nthrough the end of the seventeenth century, more peo-\nple were executed in Connecticut for witchcraft\n(eleven) and for sexual infractions, such as bestiality\nand sodomy (eleven, including one rape), than for homi-\ncide (ten). See id., pp. 17, 22, 33.\n  Even in that era, however, judges and juries often\nhesitated to enforce the capital laws as written. See,\ne.g., C. Collier, supra, 76 Conn. B.J. 19 n.42. In many\nadultery cases, for example, courts avoided imposing\nthe ultimate punishment by finding the parties not guilty\nbut ‘‘highly suspicious,’’ and thus imposing a sentence\nof something other than death. Id.\n   Commencing with the Age of Enlightenment in the\nlate 1600s, and continuing for the next three plus centu-\nries, Connecticut’s courts and elected officials have\nsteadily pared back the number and types of crimes\ndeemed worthy of the ultimate punishment. See gener-\nally L. Goodheart, supra, cc. 2–7. By the early 1660s,\njuries, magistrates, and the governor himself all were\ntaking steps to, in essence, decapitalize crimes such as\nsodomy, blasphemy, and witchcraft, in keeping with\nthe public’s increasingly secular attitudes toward crime\nand punishment. See part I B 1 of this opinion. The last\nexecutions for bestiality and witchcraft were carried\nout in 1662 and 1663, respectively. L. Goodheart, supra,\npp. 33, 97. Adultery was delisted as a capital offense in\n1672, the same year Thomas Rood was executed for\nincest, and, since then, no one has been executed in\nConnecticut for any nonviolent sexual crime. See id.,\np. 31. The revised Connecticut laws of 1750 removed\nthe capital crimes of idolatry, man stealing, and various\noffenses of rebellious offspring from the books; id., pp.\n38, 45–49; and, two years later, the General Assembly\nblocked an execution for the crime of blasphemy, effec-\ntively decapitalizing that crime. Id., pp. 49, 68. The last\nexecution in Connecticut for infanticide, a charge under\nwhich married and unmarried mothers were treated\ndifferently,46 took place in 1753; id., p. 57; followed in\n1768 by the last hanging for burglary or any purely\neconomic crime. Id., pp. 65–66.\n   The colonialists’ commitment to Mosaic eye for an\neye justice had been grounded not only in their religious\nconvictions, but also in the fact that they lacked any\nviable alternatives to execution. See W. Holdsworth,\nsupra, pp. 356–57. That changed with the advent of\nmodern correctional facilities. Although one dozen cap-\nital crimes remained on the books through the end of\nthe eighteenth century, after Newgate opened in East\nGranby in 1773, no one was executed in Connecticut\nfor any crime other than homicide or rape. See L. Good-\nheart, supra, pp. 68, 75. Moreover, the last execution\n\ffor rape, in 1817; id., p. 94; was carried out just one\ndecade before the opening of the state prison in Weth-\nersfield; id., p. 101; which Goodheart characterizes as\nreflecting ‘‘more hopeful, even utopian, assumptions\nabout penology.’’ Id. With the ideal and means of achiev-\ning rehabilitation well established, in 1846, the legisla-\nture, for the first time, created a distinction between\nfirst and second degree murder to further limit the\napplication of the death penalty. Id., pp. 104–105. One\ncentury later, ‘‘[i]n 1951, the legislature enacted a statute\nthat allowed the jury to recommend life imprisonment\nrather than death for individuals convicted of first\ndegree murder, making it even easier for the jury to\navoid imposing the death penalty. See Public Acts 1951,\nNo. 369.’’ State v. Ross, supra, 230 Conn. 303 (Berdon,\nJ., dissenting in part).\n   Connecticut’s steadily waning commitment to capital\npunishment also has been evidenced in the narrowing\nrange of offenders who have been subject to the ulti-\nmate punishment. No female has been executed in the\nstate since 1786, and no male under the age of eighteen\nat the time of the offense since 1904. See L. Goodheart,\nsupra, pp. 81–82, 136. Indeed, our legislature has ‘‘acted\nahead of the United States Supreme Court’’; State v.\nRizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 189; in prohibiting the execu-\ntion of persons with intellectual disabilities; Public Acts\n1973, No. 73-137, § 4; of offenders who committed their\ncapital crimes when they were under eighteen; Public\nActs 1973, No. 73-137, § 4; and for any crime not involv-\ning the death of a victim. State v. Rizzo, 303 Conn.\nsupra, 189.\n   Although the past 380 years have witnessed an ongo-\ning decline in our state’s commitment to the death pen-\nalty as a legitimate form of punishment, it is noteworthy\nthat Connecticut’s two constitutions, adopted in 1818\nand 1965, were drafted during periods of particularly\ndramatic change. As we previously discussed, the late\neighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were charac-\nterized by penological reform, an emerging commit-\nment to human rights, and the first widespread public\nquestioning of the moral legitimacy of capital punish-\nment in Connecticut. See L. Goodheart, supra, pp. 69–\n70. Throughout the first half of 1786, the New Haven\nGazette had reprinted Cesare Beccaria’s entire 1764\ntreatise ‘‘On Crimes and Punishments,’’ a seminal\nEnlightenment era work that condemned torture and\nthe death penalty, and that led to widespread ques-\ntioning of the latter throughout Europe and the United\nStates. See id., pp. 67–70. The impact of Beccaria’s pro-\ngressive approach to penology may be seen in the case\nof Henry Wilson, a convicted rapist whose death sen-\ntence the General Assembly commuted in 1822. See id.,\npp. 96–97. Goodheart implies that the decision reflected\nthe fact that neighboring states, such as Rhode Island,\nalready had decapitalized that crime. See id., p. 97.\n\f   One hundred and fifty years later, when Connecticut\nadopted the 1965 constitution, there was an ‘‘unofficial\nmoratorium’’ on the death penalty in the state. Id., p.\n196. The last execution in the state had taken place in\n1960, and that only after the condemned man, Joseph\nTaborsky, ‘‘volunteered to die . . . .’’ Id., p. 193. Good-\nheart attributes the unofficial moratorium that began\nin the early 1960s to a myriad of factors: the expansion\nof defendants’ federal constitutional rights; declining\npopular support for the death penalty; opposition from\norganized religion, which originally had championed\ncapital punishment in Connecticut; and research indi-\ncating that, since 1930, ‘‘the death penalty [had fallen]\ninordinately on those at the bottom of society,’’ includ-\ning the poor, uneducated, and mentally disabled. Id.,\np. 202.\n   Another Connecticut execution would not occur until\nforty-five years later, in 2005, when Ross, like Taborsky,\nwaived his right to further appeals and habeas remedies.\nId., pp. 228, 230–31, 244–46. No capital sentences have\nbeen carried out in the decade since Ross was executed.\nOver the past fifty-five years, then, during which time\nthousands of murders have been committed in the state,\nour criminal justice system has conducted but a single\nexecution, and that only after the condemned man all\nbut forced the state to carry out his sentence. See id.,\npp. 230–31. The eleven men currently on death row in\nConnecticut are, at the least, many years, and most\nlikely decades, away from exhausting all of their state\nand federal appeals and habeas remedies. Even if the\nlegislature never had enacted P.A. 12-5, if past is pro-\nlogue, there simply is no reason to believe that any\nConnecticut executions would be carried out in the\nforeseeable future.\n   As Justice Berdon observed in his dissent in Ross,\nthis ‘‘whole state history demonstrates a reluctance to\nimpose the death penalty.’’ State v. Ross, supra, 230\nConn. 302 (Berdon, J., dissenting in part). ‘‘[O]ur early\ncapital laws were seldom enforced, and, indeed, the\ncases in which capital punishment has been inflicted\nhave been exceedingly rare, some counties hardly hav-\ning known an execution.’’ (Internal quotation marks\nomitted.) Id., 303 (Berdon, J., dissenting in part). ‘‘There\nhave been, it is believed, within the last [220] years,\nfewer executions in Connecticut for crime, than in any\nother state of equal size in the world. The records of\nour courts have scarcely the stain of blood upon them\n. . . .’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.\n  Connecticut’s historical ambivalence toward the\ndeath penalty also has manifested in persistent efforts\nto abolish capital punishment. As we previously dis-\ncussed, the first serious organized opposition to the\ndeath penalty emerged in the early nineteenth century,\nand, by the mid-1800s, two governors and a majority\nof the state Senate had signed petitions for its repeal.\n\fL. Goodheart, supra, pp. 130–31. Abolition efforts per-\nsisted throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centu-\nries. See id., pp. 163–64, 178, 191, 195. In 2009, the\nGeneral Assembly passed P.A. 09-107, which would\nhave repealed the death penalty for crimes committed\nafter the passage of that act. See State v. Rizzo, supra,\n303 Conn. 198. Governor Rell vetoed P.A. 09-107, how-\never, and the legislature did not muster the two thirds\nvote necessary to override the governor’s veto. Id. Simi-\nlar legislation was introduced in 2011, which advanced\nthrough the Judiciary Committee but failed to achieve\na full vote in either the House or the Senate. See id.,\n199. Finally, on April 25, 2012, Governor Malloy signed\nP.A. 12-5, which abolished the death penalty for all\ncrimes committed on or after that date. Connecticut’s\nhistory, then, evinces a steady, inexorable devolution\nin the popularity and legitimacy of the death penalty,\nculminating in its prospective abolition in 2012.\n                             B\n                 Legislative Enactments\n   With respect to the second indicator of our evolving\nstandards of decency, both this court and the United\nStates Supreme Court have stated that ‘‘the clearest\nand most reliable objective evidence of contemporary\nvalues is the legislation enacted by the country’s legisla-\ntures.’’47 (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Atkins v.\nVirginia, supra, 536 U.S. 312; accord State v. Rizzo,\nsupra, 303 Conn. 191. We last examined the constitu-\ntionality of the death penalty in Rizzo II. See State\nv. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 184–201. At that time, we\nrecognized that, during the preceding decade, (1) the\nUnited States Supreme Court had imposed additional\nrestrictions on the range of offenses and offenders con-\nstitutionally subject to capital punishment; id., 188; (2)\nseveral additional sister states had abolished the death\npenalty; id., 190; and (3) the number of death sentences\nimposed and executions carried out in the United States\nhad continued to decline. Id., 192–93. Nevertheless, we\nconcluded ‘‘that, as long as there remains powerful evi-\ndence of strong public support for the death penalty in\nthe form of long-standing laws enacted by the democrat-\nically elected representatives of this state and other\njurisdictions within the United States, we will not\nattempt to discern a contrary view of the public will,\nor to answer complex policy questions best answered\nby the legislative process . . . .’’ Id., 198.\n   Public Act 12-5 pulled that linchpin out of our deci-\nsion in Rizzo II. For the first time in our state’s history,\nthe governor and a majority of both legislative chambers\nhave now rejected state sanctioned killing and agreed\nthat life imprisonment without the possibility of release\nis a just and adequate punishment for even the most\nhorrific crimes. For any future crimes, the death penalty\nhas been removed from the list of acceptable punish-\nments that may be imposed in accordance with law.\n\f   Public Act 12-5 thus represents the terminus of the\nfour century long devolution of the death penalty in\nConnecticut. Although the prospective nature of P.A.\n12-5 reflects the intent of the legislature that capital\npunishment shall die with a whimper, not with a bang,\nits death knell has been rung nonetheless. Our elected\nrepresentatives have determined that the machinery of\ndeath48 is irreparable or, at the least, unbecoming to a\ncivilized modern state. As a ranking member of the\nJudiciary Committee recognized in 2012, ‘‘this law is the\nbest and most recent indication of evolving standards in\nour society of human decency.’’49 55 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 2012\nSess., p. 574, remarks of Senator John A. Kissel. The\nprospective abolition of the death penalty thus provides\nstrong support for the conclusion that capital punish-\nment no longer comports with contemporary standards\nof decency and, therefore, constitutes cruel and\nunusual punishment.\n   In her dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Rogers takes\nissue with the conclusion that the prospective repeal\nof the death penalty indicates that capital punishment\nno longer comports with our state’s evolving standards\nof decency. She argues that, as a matter of common\nsense, legislators would not have voted to retain capital\npunishment on a retroactive basis if they had believed\nsuch punishment to be immoral, indecent, or unneces-\nsary. Rather, she speculates that ‘‘the reason for the\nprospective repeal was not that a majority of legislators\nfound the death penalty morally repugnant even for the\nworst crimes, or that they found life imprisonment an\nadequate substitute for the death penalty, but that they\nhad determined that the death penalty simply had\nbecome impracticable.’’ Text accompanying footnote\n19 of Chief Justice Rogers’ dissenting opinion. The most\nreasonable interpretation of P.A. 12-5, Chief Justice\nRogers posits, is that the legislature continues to believe\nthat death is the appropriate punishment for certain\ncrimes but that, for financial and other pragmatic rea-\nsons, our elected representatives were forced to accept\na less severe form of punishment for the future.\n   We begin by observing that the United States\nSupreme Court, in Atkins v. Virginia, supra, 536 U.S.\n304, considered and rejected Chief Justice Rogers’ argu-\nment that a prospective only repeal of a punishment\ndoes not indicate that the punishment no longer com-\nports with society’s evolving values. See id., 313–16\n(recognizing emergence of national consensus against\nexecuting intellectually disabled, based on decisions of\neighteen states to amend their death penalty statutes\nto exempt such persons from capital punishment, even\nthough majority of those states had done so prospec-\ntively only); see also id., 342–43 (Scalia, J., dissenting)\n(criticizing majority for counting among those jurisdic-\ntions that no longer permitted execution of intellectu-\nally disabled eleven states that had abolished practice\n\fonly prospectively). Similarly, in Fleming v. Zant,\nsupra, 259 Ga. 687, the Supreme Court of Georgia con-\ncluded that a statute that prohibited the death penalty\nfor mentally disabled individuals on a prospective only\nbasis nevertheless evidenced an evolving societal con-\nsensus that the execution of such individuals was inap-\npropriate. See id., 690 and n.3. Accordingly, that court\nconcluded that execution of mentally disabled individu-\nals sentenced prior to the effective date of the Georgia\nstatute would be cruel and unusual punishment, in vio-\nlation of the Georgia constitution. Id., 690; see also\nVan Tran v. State, 66 S.W.3d 790, 805 (Tenn. 2001)\n(concluding that statute prohibiting execution of men-\ntally disabled offenders was not intended to apply retro-\nactively but also concluding, under Tennessee consti-\ntution, in light of Fleming, that statute evidenced evolv-\ning consensus that carrying out any such executions\nwould be cruel and unusual).\n   More importantly, the voluminous legislative history\nof P.A. 12-5 simply does not bear out Chief Justice\nRogers’ interpretation of that act. During the legislative\ndebates, of the three dozen senators and representa-\ntives who spoke in favor of P.A. 12-5, nearly every legis-\nlator stated that he or she had come to oppose capital\npunishment as a matter of conscience or principle. Not-\nwithstanding the solely prospective application of P.A.\n12-5, numerous legislators declared that they categori-\ncally opposed state sanctioned killing or, in a few cases,\nthat they had concluded that life imprisonment without\nthe possibility of release is a more appropriate punish-\nment for capital felons.50 They cited a range of princi-\npled objections to the death penalty. Many found\nunacceptable the possibility that the state might mistak-\nenly execute an innocent person.51 Others condemned\ncapital punishment as incurably arbitrary and discrimi-\nnatory,52 or came to believe that death sentences retrau-\nmatize the families of murder victims.53 In his own\nremarks, one of the cochairmen of the Judiciary Com-\nmittee left little doubt as to the primary rationale for\nthe legislation: ‘‘This was a matter of conscience for\nme and I think it’s a matter of conscience for everyone\nin this body, proponents and opponents alike. I want\nto make that very clear.’’ 55 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 2012 Sess.,\npp. 791–92, remarks of Senator Eric D. Coleman.\nIndeed, many of the senators and representatives who\nopposed P.A. 12-5 acknowledged that its supporters\nvoted out of a conscientious and moral rejection of\ncapital punishment.54\n  Notably, although Chief Justice Rogers repeatedly\nchides the majority for failing to afford adequate defer-\nence to the legislative process, she herself is dismissive\nof legislators’ own characterizations of their votes,\nfavoring instead a narrative that is contradicted by the\nlegislative record. It is certainly true, as Chief Justice\nRogers emphasizes, that some proponents of the repeal\nalso expressed concerns over monetary or practical\n\fchallenges facing our state’s capital punishment system.\nThe fact that supporters voted to abolish capital punish-\nment for both moral and practical reasons, however,\nin no way demonstrates that the death penalty contin-\nues to comport with contemporary standards of\ndecency in Connecticut. An indecent punishment is no\nless indecent for the fact that it is also costly and inef-\nfectual.\n   To our knowledge, not a single legislator has publicly\nindicated that the decision to repeal the death penalty\nprospectively while retaining it for those who offended\nprior to April 25, 2012, embodied the sort of grand\nfinancial and pragmatic agreement suggested by Chief\nJustice Rogers. In fact, comments by Senator Kissel, a\nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, directly\nrefute Chief Justice Rogers’ theory that the legislative\nhistory of the act could support such an interpretation:\n‘‘[T]his isn’t being driven by cost savings. There [is]\n. . . ample testimony, year in and year out, that say[s]\nwe for moral, philosophical, religious reasons, because\nit doesn’t deter crime and all these other factors, say[s]\nthat people stridently oppose this penalty in Connecti-\ncut. People will stand up on the floor of the House and\nthe floor of the [Senate] and say, if we had a bill in\nfront of us with complete abolition, I’d support it, but for\npolitical reasons or expediency or for whatever reason,\nthat’s not the bill the Judiciary Committee gave us. But\nbecause this gets us one step closer to full abolition,\nI’m going to support this at this time.’’55 Conn. Joint\nStanding Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 9, 2012\nSess., pp. 2766–67. Ultimately, of the three dozen legisla-\ntors who spoke in favor of P.A. 12-5 during the legisla-\ntive hearings and debates, only two indicated that they\npersonally supported the repeal primarily for prag-\nmatic reasons.56\n   Why, then, did a legislature committed to abolishing\nthe death penalty vote to retain it for the handful of\ninmates already on death row? It is clear from the legis-\nlative history of P.A. 12-5, as well as the record of\nother recent attempts to abolish capital punishment in\nConnecticut, that, as Senator Kissel indicated, the vast\nmajority of those legislators who voted for P.A. 12-5\nwould have supported a full repeal but were forced at\nthat time to accept half a loaf because there were not\nenough votes to pass a full repeal. With regard to the\nhandful of legislators whose support for a repeal was\ncontingent on retaining the death penalty for previous\ncapital felons, the legislative record strongly suggests\nthat they insisted on a prospective only repeal not for\nthe pragmatic and financial reasons offered by Chief\nJustice Rogers but, rather, for one of two reasons.\n  First, some legislators opposed retroactive abolition\nout of a principled belief that the state had made a\ncommitment to families of victims murdered before the\npassage of P.A 12-5 that the state would pursue the\n\fdeath penalty in those cases. Those legislators felt that\nthe state was morally obliged to honor that prior com-\nmitment, even if it had foresworn capital punishment\ngoing forward.57 For such legislators, retaining the death\npenalty on a retroactive basis represented the lesser of\ntwo evils. Indeed, at least one legislator speculated that\nan unwillingness to ‘‘up end’’ victims’ expectations was\nthe primary rationale for enacting a prospective only\nrepeal.58 55 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 2012 Sess., p. 720, remarks\nof Senator Andrew W. Roraback; see also K. Barry,\n‘‘From Wolves, Lambs (Part II): The Fourteenth Amend-\nment Case for Gradual Abolition of the Death Penalty,’’\n35 Cardozo L. Rev. 1829, 1837 (2014) (‘‘[p]rospective-\nonly repeal grants the ‘victim’s mother’ her pound of\nflesh and then bids her adieu’’). Indeed, at oral argument\nbefore this court, the state acknowledged that the legis-\nlature indicated that ‘‘keeping a promise to the victims’’\nwas one of the primary rationales for enacting a pro-\nspective only repeal.\n   For other legislators, support for a prospective only\nrepeal appears to have reflected a calculation that they\ncould accommodate the public demand that certain\nnotorious inmates remain on death row; see part III C\nof this opinion; with little concern that those death\nsentences ever would be carried out.59 During the\ndebates over P.A. 12-5, many legislators were of the\nopinion that, once the death penalty had been prospec-\ntively abolished, the official policy of the state would\nthen disapprove capital punishment, and it would,\ntherefore, become unconstitutional to execute offend-\ners whose crimes were committed prior to the repeal.\nIt was widely predicted that the individuals already on\ndeath row would immediately seek appellate or habeas\nrelief upon passage of a prospective repeal, and that\nthis court would bar all future executions.60 Although\nnot all legislators were in agreement on this point, it is\nnoteworthy that Chief State’s Attorney Kane, who heads\nthe Division of Criminal Justice and represents the state\nin this matter, has himself publicly taken the position\nthat, following a prospective repeal, any efforts to exe-\ncute those already on death row would be unlikely to\npass constitutional muster. See Conn. Joint Standing\nCommittee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 8, 2012 Sess., pp.\n2601–2602 (‘‘I can’t imagine how we would be executing\nsomebody who’s on death row today’’); id., pp. 2630–35\n(indicating that, after prospective repeal, capital punish-\nment would fail to comport with evolving standards of\ndecency in Connecticut).61\n   Some legislators, then, may have seen a prospective\nrepeal as an opportunity to retain the support of constit-\nuents committed to the execution of particular resi-\ndents of death row, while leaving to this court the task of\nabolishing capital punishment retroactively. Professor\nKevin Barry, on whose opinions Chief Justice Rogers\nrepeatedly relies, has argued that adoption of a prospec-\ntive only repeal represented precisely this sort of ‘‘stra-\n\ftegic’’ decision on the part of legislators ‘‘to discard the\ndeath penalty going forward . . . while punting the\nhard political decisions about what to do with those\non death row . . . .’’ K. Barry, supra, 35 Cardozo L.\nRev. 1836; see also id., 1834 (noting that abolitionists\nadopted similar strategy of gradual abolition in move-\nment to end slavery); id., 1836 (prospective only repeal\nis politically viable because it removes so-called ‘‘ ‘vic-\ntim’s mother’ ’’ effect). We do not consider such action\nto evidence legislative endorsement of the death penalty\nas a fitting and acceptable means of punishment in\nmodern Connecticut.62\n   Lastly, we note that, if the primary concern of the\nlegislature had been with the workability of the death\npenalty, as Chief Justice Rogers contends, then the leg-\nislature certainly could have implemented measures,\nshort of abolition, aimed at removing some of the\nimpediments in the state’s capital punishment scheme.63\nThat option was proposed on several occasions during\nthe hearings and debates on P.A. 12-5 but ultimately\nrejected.64 The only plausible reading of the legislative\nhistory, then, is that the legislature made a principled\ndetermination that capital punishment should no longer\nbe the policy of Connecticut.\n   Turning our attention to the other elected branch of\ngovernment, we also recognize that the meaning of a\nstatute is revealed not only in the intent of the legislators\nwho draft and enact it, but also in the aspirations of\nthe governor who signs it. As Chief Justice Rogers,\nwriting for the court in Rizzo II, recently explained:\n‘‘The governor, like our legislators, is an elected repre-\nsentative of the people of the state. Additionally, execu-\ntive approval . . . of legislation is an integral part of\nthe legislative process . . . and it is axiomatic that\nwhen the governor exercises this power, he or she is\nacting in a substantive legislative role. . . . Thus . . .\na governor’s [signing statement issued upon] approval\nof legislation may provide evidence of the motivations\nunderlying that legislation . . . .’’ (Citations omitted.)\nState v. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 199–200. In fact, Chief\nJustice Rogers observed in this very context that ‘‘it may\nbe, at some times, on some subjects, that the [governor]\nelected by all the people is rather more representative\nof them all than are the members of either body of\nthe [l]egislature whose constituencies are local and not\n[statewide] . . . .’’ (Emphasis added; internal quota-\ntion marks omitted.) Id., 201. In the present case, Gover-\nnor Malloy made clear, in signing P.A. 12-5, that his\ndecision to approve legislation abolishing the death pen-\nalty was a principled one: ‘‘Many of us who have advo-\ncated for this position over the years have said there\nis a moral component to our opposition to the death\npenalty. For me, that is certainly the case. . . .\n  ‘‘I [have come] to believe that doing away with the\ndeath penalty [is] the only way to ensure it [will] not\n\fbe unfairly imposed.’’65 Gov. Malloy on Signing Bill To\nRepeal Capital Punishment (April 25, 2012) (Gover-\nnor’s Statement).\n   In conclusion, although support for a legislative com-\npromise as significant and complex as Connecticut’s\nprospective abolition of the death penalty is bound to\narise from and reflect a range of sentiments and con-\ncerns, the best evidence of legislative intent available\nto us strongly suggests that both of the elected branches\nwere motivated in no small part by a principled belief\nthat state sanctioned executions are no longer a neces-\nsary or appropriate form of punishment, even for the\nmost heinous crimes.\n                            C\n                    Current Practice\n   ‘‘Although the clearest and most reliable objective\nevidence of contemporary values is the legislation\nenacted by the country’s legislatures . . . in assessing\nwhether a punishment is constitutionally sound, it also\nis appropriate for us to consider what is occurring in\nactual practice.’’ (Citation omitted; internal quotation\nmarks omitted.) State v. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 191.\n‘‘[T]he sentencing decisions that juries have made . . .\n[are] a significant and reliable objective index of con-\ntemporary values because [juries are] so directly\ninvolved’’ in the administration of criminal justice.\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Enmund v. Flor-\nida, supra, 458 U.S. 794. For example, ‘‘[s]tatistics about\nthe number of executions may inform the consideration\nwhether capital punishment . . . is regarded as unac-\nceptable in our society.’’ Kennedy v. Louisiana, supra,\n554 U.S. 433; see id. (finding social consensus against\ncapital punishment for crime of child rape); see also\nGraham v. Florida, supra, 560 U.S. 64, 74 (determining\nthat sentence of life imprisonment without possibility\nof parole is cruel and unusual punishment for juvenile\nwho had committed nonhomicide offense when only\n123 people were serving such sentences in eleven juris-\ndictions nationwide). The number of death sentences\nactually imposed and carried out is a key barometer of\nsocial mores because, although ‘‘it is easy for the public\nto respond to the conviction of a vicious murderer or\na serial killer by advocating the ultimate penalty of\ndeath, it is far more difficult for society to carry out\nthat penalty by taking the life of that person.’’ State v.\nRoss, supra, 230 Conn. 297; see also D. Garland, Peculiar\nInstitution: America’s Death Penalty in an Age of Aboli-\ntion (2010) p. 60. ‘‘Although death penalty statutes do\nremain on the books of many jurisdictions, and public\nopinion polls show opinion to be divided as to capital\npunishment as an abstract proposition, the infrequency\nof its actual application suggests that among those per-\nsons called [on] to actually impose or carry out the\ndeath penalty it is being repudiated with ever increasing\nfrequency.’’ People v. Anderson, supra, 6 Cal. 3d 648;\n\fsee also District Attorney v. Watson, supra, 381 Mass.\n662 (prolonged dearth of executions evidences current\nstandards of decency).\n   In the post-Furman era, Connecticut has imposed\nsustained death sentences at a rate (taken as a percent-\nage of capital eligible convictions) that is among the\nlowest in the nation. See J. Donohue, ‘‘An Empirical\nEvaluation of the Connecticut Death Penalty System\nSince 1973: Are There Unlawful Racial, Gender, and\nGeographic Disparities?,’’ 11 J. Empirical Legal Stud.\n637, 638 (2014). Of the 205 capital eligible murders\ncommitted in Connecticut between 1973 and 2007, of\nwhich approximately two thirds were charged capitally,\nonly 12 resulted in death sentences. Id., 641. Indeed,\nsince 1973, whereas juries in states such as Texas and\nFlorida have imposed death sentences at an average\nrate of approximately two per month, Connecticut\njuries on average have imposed a death sentence only\napproximately once every two years.66\n   Moreover, each of the capital sentences imposed in\nConnecticut has, in effect, become the equivalent of\nlife imprisonment. As we discussed, there has been an\nalmost complete moratorium on executions in the state\nsince 1960. Connecticut has put only one offender to\ndeath over the past fifty-five years, and that was a serial\nkiller who believed that he deserved to die and volunta-\nrily waived his right to further appeals and habeas reme-\ndies. L. Goodheart, supra, pp. 228, 230–31, 244–46. Even\nthen, it took the state more than two decades to carry\nout his sentence. See id., p. 248. Nor is there even the\nremotest likelihood that any of the inmates currently\non death row in Connecticut will exhaust their federal\nand state appeals and habeas remedies any time in the\nforeseeable future.\n   The United States Supreme Court also has recognized\nthat the willingness or reluctance of prosecutors to seek\na particular punishment constitutes further objective\nevidence of whether society considers that punishment\nto be excessive or disproportionate. See Enmund v.\nFlorida, supra, 458 U.S. 796. This is because prosecu-\ntors ‘‘represent society’s interest in punishing crime\n. . . .’’ Id. In Connecticut, Chief State’s Attorney Kane,\ntestifying before the legislature prior to the enactment\nof P.A. 12-5, strongly suggested that, following the pro-\nspective repeal of the death penalty, he no longer would\nconsider it appropriate to seek the death penalty for\neligible crimes. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee\nHearings, Judiciary, Pt. 8, 2012 Sess., pp. 2602, 2633. At\nneither the charging nor the sentencing stages, then,\nhave the key decision makers in our state’s capital pun-\nishment system demonstrated that the death penalty\ncontinues to comport with contemporary standards of\ndecency in Connecticut.\n                            D\n\f      Laws and Practices of Other Jurisdictions\n   Although trends within Connecticut are the most\ndirect and relevant indicators of contemporary stan-\ndards of decency with respect to the state constitution,\nwe also look to developments in our sister states, and\neven the international community, for additional input.\nSee State v. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 192–96; see also\nRoper v. Simmons, supra, 543 U.S. 578 (‘‘[t]he opinion\nof the world community [opposing the death penalty\nfor juveniles], while not controlling our outcome, does\nprovide respected and significant confirmation for our\nown conclusions’’). Globally, 98 countries have now\nformally abolished the death penalty for all crimes, up\nfrom just 16 countries in 1977, and 140 countries effec-\ntively have renounced the death penalty by law or prac-\ntice.67 ‘‘The ‘age of abolition’ . . . has made America\nan anomaly, the last remaining holdout in a historical\nperiod that has seen the [w]estern nations embrace\nabolitionism as a human rights issue and a mark of\ncivilization.’’ D. Garland, supra, p. 11.\n   Domestically, although capital punishment remains\nlegal in a majority of jurisdictions within the United\nStates, the number of states eschewing the death pen-\nalty continues to rise. The United States Supreme Court\nhas explained that ‘‘[i]t is not so much the number of\nthese [s]tates that is significant, but the consistency of\nthe direction of change.’’ Atkins v. Virginia, supra, 536\nU.S. 315; see also Hall v. Florida, supra, 134 S. Ct. 1997.\nWhen Nebraska repealed its death penalty in May, 2015,\nit became the seventh state in just nine years to have\nabolished capital punishment either prospectively or\ncompletely.68 In total, nineteen states and the District\nof Columbia no longer permit the imposition of new\ncapital sentences.69 And, significantly, no state or nation\nthat has repealed the death penalty prospectively ever\nhas carried out another execution. See, e.g., State v.\nSantiago, Conn. Supreme Court Records & Briefs, April\nTerm, 2013, Amicus Brief of legal historians and schol-\nars p. 1.\n  Even within those jurisdictions where it remains\nlegal, ‘‘use of the death penalty (in terms of executions\nand especially death sentences) has declined signifi-\ncantly in recent years.’’ C. Steiker & J. Steiker, Report\nto the American Law Institute Concerning Capital Pun-\nishment, in A.L.I., Report of the Council to the Member-\nship of the American Law Institute on the Matter of the\nDeath Penalty (April 15, 2009) annex B, p. 2. The total\nnumber of executions carried out nationally has fallen\nby more than 60 percent from the post-Furman peak\nof 1999, dropping from 98 in 1999 to 39 in 2013, and\nthen falling again to 35—a 20 year low—in 2014.70 Of\nthe 35 executions carried out in 2014, approximately\n90 percent occurred in just four states: Texas, Missouri,\nFlorida, and Oklahoma.71\n\f   ‘‘Nationwide death sentences have dropped even\nmore precipitously’’; id.; falling from modern era highs\nof more than 300 annually in the mid-1990s to modern\nera lows of 85 or fewer since 2011.72 The number of\ndeath sentences imposed in 2014, 73, was by far the\nlowest in the post-Furman era.73 That same year, Gover-\nnor Jay Inslee of the state of Washington imposed a\nmoratorium on the carrying out of the death penalty in\nthat state,74 and Governor Martin O’Malley of the state\nof Maryland announced his intention to commute all\nremaining death sentences for those inmates in the\nstate’s prison system to life without parole.75 The latter\ndecision, reached after Maryland’s attorney general\ncalled into question the legality of carrying out pre-\nviously imposed death sentences, effectively trans-\nforms Maryland’s prospective only repeal into a full\nabolition of the death penalty. Notably, by 2012, less\nthan 2 percent of the nation’s counties accounted for\nall of the death sentences imposed nationwide. Glossip\nv. Gross,      U.S.    , 135 S. Ct. 2726, 2761, 192 L. Ed.\n2d 761 (2015) (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n  When we interpret the protections afforded under the\nstate constitution, trends and norms in our neighboring\nNew England states, with which Connecticut shares a\ncultural and historical affinity, can be especially perti-\nnent. See, e.g., State v. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 204 n.4\n(Norcott, J., dissenting) (emphasizing in 2011 that New\nHampshire was only New England state other than Con-\nnecticut with death penalty); cf. State v. James, 237\nConn. 390, 452, 678 A.2d 1338 (1996) (Berdon, J., dis-\nsenting) (noting that ‘‘[e]very state but one in the north-\neast ha[d] adopted a standard of proof in excess of\nthe preponderance of the evidence to determine the\nvoluntariness of a confession’’).\n   In the case of capital punishment, the regional dispar-\nities are both instructive in their character and striking\nin their magnitude. Of approximately 1400 executions\ncarried out nationwide since 1976, nearly two thirds\nhave been performed in just 5 states, and Texas alone\naccounts for more than 37 percent of the total.76 Ten\nstates have accounted for 83 percent of the post-Fur-\nman executions in the country.77 The geographic con-\ncentration of those executions is remarkable. The thir-\nteen states that comprised the Confederacy78 have car-\nried out more than 75 percent of the nation’s executions\nover the past four decades.79 Adding in Oklahoma and\nArizona—not yet states at the time of the civil war—\nbrings the total to nearly 90 percent.80 In stark contrast,\nthe six New England states have carried out a combined\ntotal of one execution since 1976.81 Adding in New York,\nNew Jersey, and Pennsylvania, the nine northeastern\nstates have accounted for less than one-third of 1 per-\ncent of the nation’s post-Furman executions.82 Con-\nnecticut’s execution of Ross has been the only exe-\ncution in the entire Northeast in the new millennium.\n\f   In fact, only a few northeastern states still permit\ncapital punishment. The death penalty was abolished\nby Maine in 1887, Vermont in 1964, Massachusetts and\nRhode Island in 1984, and New York and New Jersey\nin 2007.83 Following Connecticut’s prospective abolition\nof the death penalty in 2012, New Hampshire is the\nonly remaining New England state in which new death\nsentences may be imposed.84 No one has been executed\nin New Hampshire since 1939, however, and it does not\neven have an operational death chamber.85 Accordingly,\nConnecticut now stands as an outlier, the sole remain-\ning New England state in which execution remains a\nlegal and potentially viable option.86\n                            E\n          Opinions and Recommendations of\n              Professional Associations\n   The United States Supreme Court also has looked to\nthe opinions of ‘‘respected professional organizations,’’\nsuch as the American Law Institute, to help illuminate\n‘‘civilized standards of decency’’ in the capital punish-\nment context. Thompson v. Oklahoma, supra, 487 U.S.\n830; accord Hall v. Florida, supra, 134 S. Ct. 1994–95\n(relying on American Psychological Association).\nIndeed, when the United States Supreme Court effec-\ntively reinstated the death penalty in Gregg, it relied\nheavily on the American Law Institute’s work in devel-\noping Model Penal Code § 210.6 for its determination\nthat juror discretion can be sufficiently cabined to avoid\narbitrary and capricious imposition of the death pen-\nalty. See Gregg v. Georgia, supra, 428 U.S. 193–95 (opin-\nion announcing judgment); see also B. Newton, ‘‘The\nSlow Wheels of Furman’s Machinery of Death,’’ 13 J.\nApp. Prac. & Process 41, 47 (2012).\n   The American Law Institute no longer holds out such\nhopes. During the hearings on P.A. 12-5, the legislature\nheard testimony that, following a two year study com-\nmissioned by the American Law Institute, unequivocal\nconclusions were reached regarding the modern death\npenalty: ‘‘[A] review of the unsuccessful efforts to con-\nstitutionally regulate the death penalty, the difficulties\nthat continue to undermine its administration, and the\nstructural and institutional obstacles to curing those\nills forms the basis of our recommendation to the\n[American Law] Institute. The [long-standing] recogni-\ntion of these underlying defects in the capital justice\nprocess, the inability of extensive constitutional regula-\ntion to redress those defects, and the immense struc-\ntural barriers to meaningful improvement all counsel\nstrongly against the Institute’s undertaking a law reform\nproject on capital punishment, either in the form of a\nnew draft of § 210.6 or a more extensive set of propos-\nals. Rather, these conditions strongly suggest that the\nInstitute recognize that the preconditions for an ade-\nquately administered regime of capital punishment\n\fdo not currently exist and cannot reasonably be\nexpected to be achieved.’’ (Emphasis added.) C.\nSteiker & J. Steiker, supra, p. 49; see also Conn. Joint\nStanding Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 9, 2012\nSess., p. 2923, written testimony of Chief Public\nDefender Susan O. Storey. On the basis of those conclu-\nsions, and consistent with the recommendations to the\nAmerican Law Institute, in 2009, § 210.6 was withdrawn.\nMembers of the American Law Institute opted not to\ndevelop a revised or replacement model death penalty\nstatute, in light of their concerns that ‘‘real-world con-\nstraints make it impossible for the death penalty to be\nadministered in ways that satisfy norms of fairness and\nprocess.’’ A.L.I., supra, p. 5.\n   We are compelled to agree. In his concurrence in\nFurman, Justice Brennan observed that the ‘‘accept-\nability of a severe punishment is measured, not by its\navailability, for it might become so offensive to society\nas never to be inflicted, but by its use.’’ Furman v.\nGeorgia, supra, 408 U.S. 279 (Brennan, J., concurring).\nIn passing P.A. 12-5, the legislature simply has acknowl-\nedged and formalized what has become apparent in\nConnecticut, among our sister New England states, and\nthroughout the industrialized world for more than one-\nhalf century. Although some opinion polls continue to\nreflect public support for the death penalty in theory,\nin practice, our state has proved increasingly unwilling\nand unable to impose and carry out the ultimate punish-\nment.87 ‘‘The evolution of this punishment,’’ Justice\nBrennan observed, ‘‘evidences, not that it is an inevita-\nble part of the American scene, but that it has proved\nprogressively more troublesome to the national con-\nscience.’’ Id., 299 (Brennan, J., concurring).\n                            F\n                       Conclusion\n   In conclusion, we are aware that the issue of whether\nthe death penalty is an appropriate punishment for the\nmost heinous crimes is one about which people of good\nfaith continue to disagree. Nevertheless, our review of\nthe five objective indicia that have been deemed rele-\nvant under both the federal and state constitutions com-\npels the conclusion that, following the enactment of\nP.A. 12-5, Connecticut’s capital punishment scheme no\nlonger comports with our state’s contemporary stan-\ndards of decency.88 It therefore offends the state consti-\ntutional prohibition against excessive and dispropor-\ntionate punishment.89\n                           III\n       THE DEATH PENALTY IS DEVOID OF\n        ANY LEGITIMATE PENOLOGICAL\n               JUSTIFICATIONS\n  As the constitution requires, we next consider\nwhether, on the basis of our independent review of\nthe available evidence, executing those individuals who\n\fcommitted capital felonies prior to the enactment of\nP.A. 12-5 would serve any legitimate penological pur-\npose. In light of the history and desuetude of the death\npenalty in Connecticut over the past one-half century,\nculminating in its prospective abolition in 2012, we con-\nclude that capital punishment no longer measurably\ncontributes to any legitimate penological goal.\n   Enforcing the criminal law means marshaling the\nawesome coercive power of the state to deprive its own\ncitizens of the life, liberty, or property to which they\nare otherwise naturally entitled. See, e.g., Stutson v.\nUnited States, 516 U.S. 193, 196, 116 S. Ct. 600, 133 L.\nEd. 2d 571 (1996); State v. Vumback, 247 Conn. 929,\n933, 719 A.2d 1172 (1998) (Berdon, J., dissenting from\nthe denial of certification to appeal). The death penalty\nrepresents the most extreme exercise of this power.\nSee, e.g., State v. Rizzo, supra, 266 Conn. 227. Such a\ndeprivation must, of course, be justified, and society\ntraditionally has recognized four principal justifications\nfor the imposition of criminal sanctions. Criminal penal-\nties may be imposed (1) to deter the perpetrator and\nothers from committing crimes (deterrence), (2) to pun-\nish the perpetrator and give voice to the moral outrage\nexperienced by the victim and society at large (retribu-\ntion), (3) to prevent the perpetrator from committing\nadditional offenses (incapacitation), or (4) to transform\nthe perpetrator into a better, more law-abiding citizen\n(rehabilitation). See, e.g., Graham v. Florida, supra,\n560 U.S. 71–74. ‘‘A sentence lacking any legitimate peno-\nlogical justification is by its nature disproportionate to\nthe offense.’’ Id., 71. Neither the federal nor the state\nconstitution will permit the imposition of a sanction ‘‘so\ntotally without penological justification that it results in\nthe gratuitous infliction of suffering.’’ Gregg v. Georgia,\nsupra, 428 U.S. 183 (opinion announcing judgment).\n    In the case of the death penalty, the punishment itself\nterminates any opportunity for rehabilitation. Hall v.\nFlorida, supra, 134 S. Ct. 1992–93. Moreover, execution,\nas compared to life in prison without the possibility\nof release, offers minimal additional value by way of\nincapacitation.90 See Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U.S. 447,\n461, 104 S. Ct. 3154, 82 L. Ed. 2d 340 (1984) (noting that\n‘‘incapacitation has never been embraced as a sufficient\njustification for the death penalty’’). Accordingly, it is\ngenerally accepted that, if capital punishment is to be\nmorally and legally justified, it must be based on the\ndeterrent or retributive value of executions. E.g., Ken-\nnedy v. Louisiana, supra, 554 U.S. 441; Gregg v. Geor-\ngia, supra, 428 U.S. 183 (opinion announcing judgment).\nUnless the imposition of the death penalty ‘‘measurably\ncontributes to one or both of these goals, it is nothing\nmore than the purposeless and needless imposition of\npain and suffering, and hence an unconstitutional pun-\nishment.’’ (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks\nomitted.) Atkins v. Virginia, supra, 536 U.S. 319. ‘‘At\nthe moment that [the death penalty] ceases realistically\n\fto further these purposes . . . its imposition would\nthen be the pointless and needless extinction of life with\nonly marginal contributions to any discernible social or\npublic purposes. A penalty with such negligible returns\nto the [s]tate would be patently excessive and cruel\nand unusual . . . .’’ Furman v. Georgia, supra, 408 U.S.\n312 (White, J., concurring).\n   We previously have acknowledged that ‘‘the value of\n[a criminal sanction], and its contribution to acceptable\npenological goals, typically is a complex factual issue\nthe resolution of which properly rests with the legisla-\ntures . . . .’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State\nv. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 197. We also have recognized,\nhowever, that this assessment ‘‘is not exclusively the\ndomain of the legislature, and that this court has an\nindependent duty to determine that the penalty remains\nconstitutionally viable as the sensibilities of our citizens\nevolve.’’ Id.; see also part IV C of this opinion. Deference\nto legislative assessments is least warranted, and judi-\ncial scrutiny must be especially exacting, when, as in\nthe present case, the policy judgments embodied in\nthe relevant legislation are ambiguous.91 Upon close\nconsideration of the arguments and the available\nresearch, and particularly in light of the legislature’s\ndecision to abolish capital punishment for all future\ncrimes, we conclude that the death penalty no longer\nmeasurably contributes to the penological goals of\ndeterrence or retribution. We consider each in turn.\n                             A\n                       Deterrence\n   Turning first to deterrence, we observe that it is clear\nthat, with the passage of P.A. 12-5, any deterrent value\nthe death penalty may have had no longer exists. As\nJustice Harper explained in his dissent in Santiago I:\n‘‘The ultimate test of this deterrence claim is whether\nthe state, by executing some of its citizens, better\nachieves the unquestionably legitimate goal of discour-\naging others from committing similar crimes. As a gen-\neral matter, the empirical evidence regarding deter-\nrence is inconclusive. Following the abolition of the\ndeath penalty for all future offenses committed in Con-\nnecticut, however, it is possible to determine the exact\nnumber of potential crimes that will be deterred by\nexecuting the defendant in this case. That number is\nzero.’’ (Emphasis omitted; footnote omitted.) State v.\nSantiago, supra, 305 Conn. 320–21 (Harper, J., concur-\nring in part and dissenting in part).\n  In her dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Rogers rejects\nJustice Harper’s commonsense conclusion that once\nthe legislature enacts a high profile repeal of a punish-\nment, that punishment no longer serves as a deterrent.\nRather, she contends, by maintaining capital punish-\nment for offenders sentenced to death before the enact-\nment of P.A. 12-5, the state can send a ‘‘message’’ to\n\fpotential offenders that the laws are stable and will be\nenforced as written. This, she believes, can strengthen\nthe deterrent force of all penal laws.92\n  We very much doubt that the citizens of Connecticut,\nlearning that the death penalty has been abolished, will\nsomehow infer that they can now rape, pillage, and\nexceed the speed limits with impunity. In fact, during\nthe legislative hearings on P.A. 12-5, a member of the\nJudiciary Committee rejected the suggestion that the\nlegislature was adopting a prospective only repeal ‘‘to\nconvince people that the government is really serious\nabout carrying out its penalties.’’ Conn. Joint Standing\nCommittee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 9, 2012 Sess., pp.\n2781–82, remarks of Representative Arthur J. O’Neill\n(responding to law student who proposed that solely\nprospective repeal could be justified on basis of\ndeterrence).\n   In any event, the horse that Chief Justice Rogers\nseeks to corral has long since left the barn. Of the more\nthan 4000 individuals who have committed murder in\nConnecticut since the death penalty was reinstated four\ndecades ago, only one has been executed, and then only\nafter he demanded that the state carry out his death\nsentence. L. Goodheart, supra, pp. 228, 230–31. The\noverwhelming majority of killers are not sentenced to\ndeath. As we discuss more fully hereinafter, those who\nare sentenced to death routinely spend decades on\ndeath row, and there is every reason to believe that\nthey would die there, outlived by their various appeals\nand habeas petitions. Chief Justice Rogers fails to\nexplain how it is that this system of unexecuted capital\npunishment promotes a respect for the law or leads our\ncitizens to expect that the state will carry out prescribed\npunishments as written.\n   Even if the legislature had not prospectively abol-\nished the death penalty, it would appear that capital\npunishment, as administered in Connecticut in the post-\nFurman era, has failed to demonstrate a sufficient\ndeterrent effect to justify continued state imposed kill-\ning. Although some studies have purported to document\na deterrent effect,93 ‘‘the majority of social science\nresearch on the issue concludes that the death penalty\nhas no effect on the homicide rate.’’94 D. Beschle, ‘‘Why\nDo People Support Capital Punishment? The Death Pen-\nalty as Community Ritual,’’ 33 Conn. L. Rev. 765, 768\n(2001). A principal reason for this failure of deterrence\nappears to be the substantial delays involved in actually\ncarrying out a sentence of death. The number of poten-\ntial state and federal postconviction remedies available,\nthe range and complexity of legal issues involved in\ncapital appeals, and the multiple stages of review mean\nthat at least one decade typically passes from capital\ncrime to execution, and delays of twenty years or more\nare not at all uncommon. See, e.g., A. Kozinski & S.\nGallagher, ‘‘Death: The Ultimate Run-On Sentence,’’ 46\n\fCase W. Res. L. Rev. 1, 10–11, 17 (1995). The delays,\nmoreover, appear to be getting longer. Of the thirty-\nfive offenders executed in the United States in 2014,\nonly one had been on death row for less than one\ndecade, and the average time from sentencing to execu-\ntion exceeded seventeen years.95 The situation is no\ndifferent in Connecticut. Of the eight men sentenced\nto death in the state between 1987 and 2007 whose\nsentences were not later overturned, only one has been\nexecuted. Ross was executed by lethal injection in 2005,\neighteen years after sentencing, and then only after\nhe voluntarily abandoned further legal challenges. L.\nGoodheart, supra, pp. 228, 230–31, 246. Of the eleven\nmen currently on death row in Connecticut, one has\nbeen awaiting execution for twenty-five years, two oth-\ners for nearly that long, and one for twenty years.\n   ‘‘The deterrent value of any punishment is, of course,\nrelated to the promptness with which it is inflicted.’’\nColeman v. Balkcom, 451 U.S. 949, 952, 101 S. Ct. 2031,\n68 L. Ed. 2d 334 (1981) (Stevens, J., concurring in the\ndenial of certiorari); see also Gomez v. Fierro, 519 U.S.\n918, 918, 117 S. Ct. 285, 136 L. Ed. 2d 204 (1996) (Stevens,\nJ., dissenting) (‘‘[d]elay in the execution of judgments\nimposing the death penalty frustrates the public interest\nin deterrence and eviscerates the only rational justifica-\ntion for that type of punishment’’); Furman v. Georgia,\nsupra, 408 U.S. 302 (Brennan, J., concurring) (‘‘[a]\nrational person contemplating a murder or rape is con-\nfronted, not with the certainty of a speedy death, but\nwith the slightest possibility that he will be executed\nin the distant future’’); Jones v. Chappell, 31 F. Supp.\n3d 1050, 1064 (C.D. Cal. 2014) (law and common sense\ndictate that ‘‘long delays preceding execution frustrate\nwhatever deterrent effect the death penalty may have’’);\nPeople v. Anderson, supra, 6 Cal. 3d 652 (‘‘capital pun-\nishment can have a significant deterrent effect only if\nthe punishment is swiftly and certainly exacted’’); L.\nPowell, commentary, ‘‘Capital Punishment,’’ 102 Harv.\nL. Rev. 1035, 1035 (1989) (‘‘years of delay between sen-\ntencing and execution . . . [undermine] the deterrent\neffect of capital punishment and [reduce] public confi-\ndence in the criminal justice system’’). Even prior to\nthe enactment of P.A. 12-5, the fact that one who com-\nmits the most heinous of crimes can expect to spend\ndecades in prison prior to any execution suggests that\ncapital punishment promises little if any deterrence\nover and above life imprisonment.96 The legislature\nheard extensive expert testimony to this effect when\nconsidering P.A. 12-5, and numerous legislators cited\nthe lack of a deterrent effect as a justification for their\ndecision to abolish the death penalty.97 Indeed, Chief\nState’s Attorney Kane, who represents the state in this\nand all other death penalty cases, acknowledged in pub-\nlic testimony that there is insufficient evidence to con-\nclude that capital punishment deters crime. See Conn.\nJoint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 8,\n\f2012 Sess., p. 2623 (‘‘I don’t know if I’d even go so far\nas to say [the death penalty] might well be a deterrent\nbecause the studies are mixed. I’m not ready [to say\nthat the] . . . answer is clear enough to justify that as\na reason for having the death penalty.’’).\n   In addition, aside from the inevitable delays, the sheer\nrarity with which death sentences are imposed and\ncarried out in Connecticut—and, indeed, the entire\nnortheastern United States—suggests that any conceiv-\nable deterrent value will be far less than in a state like\nTexas, for example, which carries out executions on a\nregular basis. ‘‘[C]ommon sense and experience tell us\nthat seldom-enforced laws become ineffective mea-\nsures for controlling human conduct and that the death\npenalty, unless imposed with sufficient frequency, will\nmake little contribution to deterring those crimes for\nwhich it may be exacted.’’ Furman v. Georgia, supra,\n408 U.S. 312 (White, J., concurring). Judge Alex Kozinski\nof the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals puts the problem\nmost plainly: ‘‘Rather than go through the competing\nconsiderations, let’s cut to the meat of the coconut.\nThe death penalty, as we now administer it, has no\ndeterrent value because it is imposed so infrequently\nand so freakishly. To get executed in America these\ndays you have to be not only a truly nasty person, but\nalso very, very unlucky . . . .’’ A. Kozinski & S. Gal-\nlagher, supra, 46 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 25.\n   Our legislature’s adoption of P.A. 12-5 underscores\nthis state’s historical and profound ambivalence with\nrespect to the death penalty, and is further reason to\nbelieve that, even if we were to sustain its constitution-\nality, the delays in the administration of our capital\nsentencing scheme would not abate. On the contrary,\nas we previously noted, no state or nation ever has\nexecuted someone after a prospective only repeal of\nthe death penalty. See, e.g., State v. Santiago, Conn.\nSupreme Court Records & Briefs, April Term, 2013,\nAmicus Brief of legal historians and scholars p. 1.\nWhether death has been belayed by executive clemency\nor simple public aversion, it universally has been con-\nsidered unseemly to carry out an execution after the\npeople’s representatives have expressed their will that\nthe sentence of death no longer shall be imposed.\nAccordingly, Connecticut’s prospective repeal of capi-\ntal punishment provides strong reason to believe that\nthose persons currently on death row never will be\nexecuted. In any event, in light of the passage of P.A.\n12-5, and in the absence of any indication that the death\npenalty, as administered in this state, has forestalled\nthe commission of capital crimes, it is apparent that\ncapital punishment no longer serves any meaningful\ndeterrent function in Connecticut.98\n                            B\n                       Retribution\n\f  The second commonly articulated rationale for the\ndeath penalty is that, regardless of whether capital pun-\nishment provides any tangible benefits such as deter-\nrence, incapacitation, or rehabilitation, it is a justified\nmoral response to a heinous crime such as the one\ncommitted by the defendant in the present case. This\nretributive function of the criminal law has been\nexpressed in varying terms: giving the offender his ‘‘just\ndeserts’’; providing a sense of restoration and closure\nto victims and their families; expressing society’s out-\nrage at the crime and denunciation of the perpetrator;\nand, more philosophically, restoring balance to the\nmoral order.\n   Both this court and the federal courts have recog-\nnized that, as society has evolved and matured, the\nerstwhile importance of retribution as a goal of and\njustification for criminal sanctions has waned. See, e.g.,\nState v. Corchado, 200 Conn. 453, 463, 512 A.2d 183\n(1986) (agreeing with observation of United States\nSupreme Court that reformation and rehabilitation of\noffenders, rather than retribution, has become primary\ngoal of criminal jurisprudence). Over time, ‘‘our society\nhas moved away from public and painful retribution\ntoward ever more humane forms of punishment.’’ Baze\nv. Rees, supra, 553 U.S. 80 (Stevens, J., concurring in\nthe judgment). In addition, the United States Supreme\nCourt has cautioned that, of the valid justifications for\npunishment, ‘‘retribution . . . most often can contra-\ndict the law’s own ends. This is of particular concern\n. . . in capital cases. When the law punishes by death,\nit risks its own sudden descent into brutality, trans-\ngressing the constitutional commitment to decency and\nrestraint.’’ Kennedy v. Louisiana, supra, 554 U.S. 420.\nAccordingly, ‘‘[r]etribution is no longer the dominant\nobjective of the criminal law.’’ Williams v. New York,\n337 U.S. 241, 248, 69 S. Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed. 1337 (1949).\n   Critics of the death penalty have articulated in pas-\nsionate and persuasive terms why, in their view, it can\nnever be morally appropriate for the state to kill one\nof its own. See, e.g., District Attorney v. Watson, supra,\n381 Mass. 677–86 (Liacos, J., concurring). On the other\nhand, we are sympathetic to the view, expressed by\nJustice Scalia, among many others, that, however bar-\nbaric a modern execution may seem, it pales in compari-\nson to the suffering and trauma experienced by the\nvictims and their families. See Callins v. Collins, 510\nU.S. 1141, 1143, 114 S. Ct. 1127, 127 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1994)\n(Scalia, J., concurring in the denial of certiorari) (‘‘How\nenviable a quiet death by lethal injection compared with\nthat!’’). Regardless of one’s general beliefs about the\nmorality of the death penalty, however, there are four\nreasons why capital punishment, as administered in\nConnecticut, simply does not serve a meaningful retrib-\nutive purpose.\n                            1\n\f                 Legislative Judgments\n   First, as we previously discussed; see part II B of this\nopinion; the passage of P.A. 12-5 reflects a legislative\njudgment that capital punishment no longer serves a\nnecessary moral function in our state. The retributive\nrationale for capital punishment always has been that\nthe worst of the worst, those who commit especially\nheinous crimes, have thereby cut themselves off from\nthe human community. See Roper v. Simmons, supra,\n543 U.S. 568 (‘‘[c]apital punishment must be limited to\nthose offenders who commit a narrow category of the\nmost serious crimes and whose extreme culpability\nmakes them the most deserving of execution’’ [internal\nquotation marks omitted]). In other words, execution\nis the ultimate form of ostracism. ‘‘[T]he decision that\ncapital punishment may be the appropriate sanction in\n[such] extreme cases is an expression of the communi-\nty’s belief that certain crimes are themselves so grievous\nan affront to humanity that the only adequate response\nmay be the penalty of death.’’ (Emphasis added.) Gregg\nv. Georgia, supra, 428 U.S. 184 (opinion announcing\njudgment).\n   By prospectively repealing the death penalty, how-\never, the legislature necessarily has made a determina-\ntion that he who lives by the sword need not die by it;\nthat life imprisonment without the possibility of release\nis an adequate and sufficient penalty even for the most\nhorrific of crimes; and that we can express our moral\noutrage, mete out justice, bring some measure of solace\nto the families of the victims, and purge the blemish of\nmurder on our community whilst the offender yet lives.\nIf this is true, then, although the death penalty still\nmight serve some minimal retributive function in Con-\nnecticut, it lacks any retributive justification. In other\nwords, to whatever limited extent capital punishment\nmay still further these retributive purposes, the legisla-\nture has determined that the death penalty is no longer\nnecessary to achieve them. See Conn. Joint Standing\nCommittee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 8, 2012 Sess., p. 2638,\nremarks of Representative Gary A. Holder-Winfield (if\njustice can be achieved in capital eligible case without\ndeath penalty, then it is unnecessary). Lacking such\nnecessity, the death penalty in Connecticut has become\nunconstitutionally excessive. Cf. Furman v. Georgia,\nsupra, 408 U.S. 342 (Marshall, J., concurring) (capital\npunishment unjustified when less severe penalties sat-\nisfy legitimate legislative goals). As Justice Brennan\nexplained in his concurrence in Furman, ‘‘[w]hen the\noverwhelming number of criminals who commit capital\ncrimes go to prison, it cannot be concluded that death\nserves the purpose of retribution more effectively than\nimprisonment. The asserted public belief that murder-\ners and rapists deserve to die is flatly inconsistent with\nthe execution of a random few.’’ Id., 304–305 (Brennan,\nJ., concurring).\n\f                             2\n                          Delays\n   The second reason the death penalty has lost its\nretributive mooring in Connecticut is that the lengthy\nif not interminable delays in carrying out capital senten-\nces ‘‘do not just undermine the death penalty’s deterrent\neffect; they also spoil its capacity for satisfying retribu-\ntion.’’ D. Garland, supra, p. 45; see also Jones v.\nChappell, supra, 31 F. Supp. 3d 1064. Of the eleven\nindividuals awaiting execution in Connecticut, four\nhave been there for more than twenty years, and several\nothers for well over one decade. Nor is there any reason-\nable probability that anyone will be executed in this\nstate for many years to come, given the availability of\nvarious appellate and postconviction remedies, as well\nas the historical reluctance—indeed, unwillingness—\nof our sister states and other countries to carry out\nexecutions after prospectively abolishing capital pun-\nishment. See State v. Santiago, Conn. Supreme Court\nRecords & Briefs, April Term, 2013, Amicus Brief of\nlegal historians and scholars p. 1. ‘‘[W]hen imposition\nof the [death] penalty reaches a certain degree of infre-\nquency, it would be very doubtful that any existing\ngeneral need for retribution would be measurably satis-\nfied. . . . Nor could it be said with confidence . . .\nthat community values are measurably reinforced by\nauthorizing a penalty so rarely invoked.’’ Furman v.\nGeorgia, supra, 408 U.S. 311–12 (White, J., concurring);\nsee also Valle v. Florida,        U.S.     , 132 S. Ct. 1, 2,\n180 L.

As one federal\ncourt recently observed in holding that California’s capi-\ntal punishment scheme violates the eighth amendment,\n‘‘for most [individuals on death row], systemic delay\nhas made their execution so unlikely that the death\nsentence carefully and deliberately imposed by the jury\nhas been quietly transformed into one no rational jury\nor legislature could ever impose: life in prison, with the\nremote possibility of death. As for the random few for\nwhom execution does become a reality, they will have\nlanguished for so long on [d]eath [r]ow that their execu-\ntion[s] will serve no retributive or deterrent purpose\n\fand will be arbitrary.’’ (Emphasis omitted.) Jones v.\nChappell, supra, 1053.\n   After such lengthy delays, scholars have questioned\nwhether there can be any true retribution when the\nmiddle aged inmate who goes to the gallows bears little\nresemblance to the individual who offended years\nbefore: ‘‘The man you wanted to kill was the abusive\nrobber, high on crack, who pistol-whipped and shot\ntwo customers at a [7-Eleven] store in 1984. Instead, in\n1990, the state electrocutes a balding, religious, model\nprisoner in a neat blue-denim uniform.’’ (Internal quota-\ntion marks omitted.) D. Garland, supra, pp. 45–46, quot-\ning S. Gross, ‘‘The Romance of Revenge: Capital\nPunishment in America,’’ 13 Stud. L. Pol. & Society\n71, 82 (1993); see also L. Powell, ‘‘Unraveling Criminal\nStatutes of Limitations,’’ 45 Am. Crim. L.

Even such staunch advo-\ncates of capital punishment as the German philosopher\nImmanuel Kant, the deacon of retributive justice, have\nrecognized that the retributive value of the death pen-\nalty is not realized unless and until the actual execution\nis carried out. See, e.g., I. Kant, The Metaphysics of\nMorals (1991) p. 142; see also Coleman v. Balkcom,\nsupra, 451 U.S. 960 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting from the\ndenial of certiorari) (‘‘[t]here can be little doubt that\ndelay in the enforcement of capital punishment frus-\ntrates the purpose of retribution’’).\n   What then remains of retribution when one who com-\nmits a heinous crime is not executed until after he has\nspent half a lifetime or more on death row, if ever?\nUnlike with deterrence, the retributive value of an exe-\ncution defies easy definition and quantification,\nshrouded as retribution is in metaphysical notions of\nmoral restoration and just deserts. What is clear, how-\never, is that the most tangible retributive fruit of capital\npunishment—providing victims and their families with\na sense of respite, empowerment, and closure—is griev-\nously undermined by the interminable delays in carrying\nout the sentence imposed. ‘‘[I]n reality, rather than\naffording them a quick and final disposition of the case\nagainst the murderer, so that they may finalize the trag-\nedy and begin rebuilding their lives, the capital punish-\nment process often creates a second victimization of\nsurvivors. They must contend with repeated reminders\nabout the murder during the protracted proceedings in\nwhich the death penalty’s implementation is—usually\nunsuccessfully—sought.’’ R. Tabak & J. Lane, ‘‘The Exe-\ncution of Injustice: A Cost and Lack-of-Benefit Analysis\nof the Death Penalty,’’ 23 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 59, 129 (1989);\nsee also Nichols v. Heidle, 725 F.3d 516, 559 (6th Cir.\n2013) (Martin, J., concurring) (noting, inter alia, pro-\ntracted nature of death penalty cases, which, in turn,\nprovides ‘‘no closure for the families of the victims’’),\n\fcert. denied,     U.S.    , 135 S. Ct. 704, 190 L. Ed.\n2d 438 (2014). Psychologically, the capital punishment\nsystem actually may impede the healing process. R.\nTabak & J. Lane, supra, 131.\n   Legislators heard substantial testimony to this effect\nwhen considering P.A. 12-5, with both mental health\nprofessionals and the relatives of individual murder\nvictims speaking about the retraumatization that our\ncapital punishment scheme often inflicts on victims’\nfamilies.99 Many legislators cited such testimony as a\nbasis for their decision to support the repeal of the\ndeath penalty, while at the same time recognizing that\nthere are, of course, families who continue to seek the\ndeath penalty for the offenders who murdered their\nloved ones. Governor Malloy, upon signing the bill,\nshared the sentiments of one victim’s survivor: ‘‘Now\nis the time to start the process of healing, a process\nthat could have been started decades earlier with the\nfinality of a life sentence. We cannot afford to put on\nhold the lives of these secondary victims. We need to\nallow them to find a way as early as possible to begin\nto live again.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Gov-\nernor’s Statement, supra.\n                            3\n                  Possibility of Error\n   The third reason that capital punishment fails to sat-\nisfy the demands of retributive justice is the ever pre-\nsent danger of irreversible error. It is axiomatic that\n‘‘the execution of a legally and factually innocent person\nwould be a constitutionally intolerable event.’’ Herrera\nv. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 419, 113 S. Ct. 853, 122 L. Ed.\n2d 203 (1993) (O’Connor, J., concurring). Indeed, ‘‘[t]he\nexecution of a person who can show [that] he is inno-\ncent comes perilously close to simple murder.’’ (Inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Cobb, supra, 251\nConn. 549 (Norcott, J., dissenting), quoting Herrera v.\nCollins, supra, 446 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).\n   Unfortunately, numerous studies have found that\n‘‘[e]rrors can and have been made repeatedly in the trial\nof death penalty cases because of poor representation,\nracial prejudice, prosecutorial misconduct, or simply\nthe presentation of erroneous evidence.’’ State v. Ross,\nsupra, 230 Conn. 315 (Berdon, J., dissenting in part).\nA study of all death sentences in the United States in\nthe two decades following Furman found ‘‘extremely\nhigh error rates’’; A. Gelman et al., ‘‘A Broken System:\nThe Persistent Patterns of Reversals of Death Sentences\nin the United States,’’ 1 J. Empirical Legal Stud. 209,\n261 (2004); with at least two thirds of capital sentences\neventually overturned on appeal. Id., 209; see also D.\nBenson et al., ‘‘Executing the Innocent,’’ 3 Ala.

L. Rev. 733,\n748 (2001) (capital punishment system is ‘‘collapsing\nunder the weight of its own mistakes’’ [internal quota-\ntion marks omitted]). Statistical analyses have demon-\nstrated to a near certainty that innocent Americans have\nbeen and will continue to be executed in the post-\nFurman era. See Glossip v. Gross, supra, 135 S. Ct.\n2756 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (citing ‘‘convincing evi-\ndence’’ that, ‘‘in the past three decades, innocent people\nhave been executed’’); id., 2758 (Breyer, J., dissenting)\n(citing evidence that ‘‘about [4 percent] of those sen-\ntenced to death are actually innocent’’); see also H.\nBedau & M.

Ross, supra, 230 Conn. 314 (Berdon, J.,\ndissenting in part). ‘‘We know that persons have been\ncondemned who were innocent; we know that future\nscientific evidence can overturn the seemingly most\nsafe of convictions; and we know that we could easily\navoid such problems in adopting an alternative sanc-\ntion, such as life imprisonment. Therefore, we know-\ningly, foreseeably, and avoidably sentence innocent\npeople to death . . . if we continue to endorse capital\npunishment . . . .’’ T. Brooks, ‘‘Retribution and Capital\nPunishment,’’ in Retributivism: Essays on Theory and\nPractice (M. White ed., 2011) p. 238. Of course, all pun-\nishment is tainted by the possibility of error. Capital\npunishment, however, ‘‘is especially problematic. When\nwe impose capital punishment on a convicted murderer,\nthere cannot be any room for error since the murderer\ncan never be brought back to life afterward if error\nis discovered at some later date. If there remains a\nsubstantial risk of error, as demonstrated by advances\nin scientific testing in cases [in which] a person has\nbeen sentenced beyond a reasonable doubt in a fair\ntrial, then we have good reason on retributivist grounds\nto reject capital punishment in favor of an alternative\nsanction.’’ Id., p. 237.\n  It was this risk of error that led Illinois Governor\nGeorge Ryan in 2003 to commute the death sentences of\nthat state’s 167 death row inmates to life imprisonment\n\fwithout the possibility of parole. See J. Wilgoren, ‘‘Cit-\ning Issue of Fairness, Governor Clears Out Death Row\nin Illinois,’’ N.Y. Times, January 12, 2003, p. 1. Governor\nRyan concluded that ‘‘[o]ur capital system is haunted\nby the demon of error . . . .’’ (Internal quotation marks\nomitted.) Id. The possibility of executing an innocent\nperson was also a principal concern voiced by both of\nConnecticut’s elected branches in their support of P.A.\n12-5.100 We do not suggest that anyone currently on\ndeath row in Connecticut has a potentially viable claim\nof actual innocence.101 In concluding that the death pen-\nalty is unconstitutional, however, we recognize that the\nlegal and moral legitimacy of any future executions\nwould be undermined by the ever present risk that an\ninnocent person will be wrongly executed.102\n                            4\n                    Caprice and Bias\n   The fourth reason that our state’s capital punishment\nsystem fails to achieve its retributive goals is that the\nselection of which offenders live and which offenders\ndie appears to be inescapably tainted by caprice and\nbias. ‘‘[T]he heart of the retribution rationale is that a\ncriminal sentence must be directly related to the per-\nsonal culpability of the criminal offender.’’ (Internal\nquotation marks omitted.) Graham v. Florida, supra,\n560 U.S. 71. In other words, the death penalty must be\nequally available for similarly culpable offenders if a\ncapital sentencing scheme is to fulfill a valid retributive\npurpose. To the extent that the ultimate punishment is\nimposed on an offender on the basis of impermissible\nconsiderations such as his, or his victim’s, race, eth-\nnicity, or socio-economic status, rather than the severity\nof his crime, his execution does not restore but, rather,\ntarnishes the moral order. See generally O. Londono,\n‘‘A Retributive Critique of Racial Bias and Arbitrariness\nin Capital Punishment,’’ 44 J. Soc. Phil. 95 (2013); D.\nMcDermott, ‘‘A Retributivist Argument against Capital\nPunishment,’’ 32 J. Soc. Phil. 317 (2001); S. Nathanson,\n‘‘Does It Matter if the Death Penalty Is Arbitrarily\nAdministered?,’’ 14 Phil. & Pub. Aff. 149 (1985).\n  The problem is that, as we previously noted, there is\nan inherent conflict in the requirements that the eighth\namendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment,\nas interpreted by the United States Supreme Court,\nimposes on any capital sentencing scheme. On the one\nhand, Furman and its progeny stand for the proposition\nthat any capital punishment statute, to avoid arbitrari-\nness and pass constitutional muster, must cabin the\ndiscretion of prosecutors, judges, and juries by provid-\ning clear guidelines as to what specific types of crimes\nare eligible for the punishment of death. In the context\nof capital murder—the sole remaining crime against an\nindividual for which capital punishment may be\nimposed under the eighth amendment—that require-\nment has been interpreted to mean that statutes must\n\fidentify specific aggravating factors that the fact finder\nmust find before imposing the death penalty. See Tui-\nlaepa v. California, supra, 512 U.S. 971–73. The ultimate\npunishment must be reserved for the very worst offend-\ners, and may not be ‘‘wantonly [or] . . . freakishly\nimposed.’’ Furman v. Georgia, supra, 408 U.S. 310\n(Stewart, J., concurring). On the other hand, since it\ndecided Woodson v. North Carolina, supra, 428 U.S.\n280, and Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 98 S. Ct. 2954,\n57 L. Ed. 2d 973 (1978), the United States Supreme Court\nhas not wavered in its commitment to the principle\nof individualized sentencing: juries must be afforded\nunlimited discretion to consider any mitigating factor—\nany unique characteristic of the crime, the criminal,\nor the victim—before imposing the death penalty. See\nTuilaepa v. California, supra, 972–73. In other words,\nthe discretion of the jury to accord the capital defendant\nmercy may not be confined or restricted in any way.103\n   The question is whether this individualized sentenc-\ning requirement inevitably allows in through the back\ndoor the same sorts of caprice and freakishness that the\ncourt sought to exclude in Furman, or, worse, whether\nindividualized sentencing necessarily opens the door\nto racial and ethnic discrimination in capital sentenc-\ning.104 In other words, is it ever possible to eliminate\narbitrary and discriminatory application of capital pun-\nishment through a more precise and restrictive defini-\ntion of capital crimes if prosecutors always remain free\nnot to seek the death penalty for a particular defendant,\nand juries not to impose it, for any reason whatsoever?\nWe do not believe that it is.105\n   We begin by observing that the United States\nSupreme Court itself has expressed serious doubts as\nto whether its own commandments can be reconciled.\nIn Tuilaepa, the court recognized that ‘‘[t]he objectives\nof these two inquiries can be in some tension . . . .’’\nId., 973. Fourteen years later, in Kennedy, the court\nagain acknowledged that ‘‘[t]he tension between gen-\neral rules and case-specific circumstances has pro-\nduced results not altogether satisfactory.’’ Kennedy v.\nLouisiana, supra, 554 U.S. 436. ‘‘Our response to this\ncase law,’’ the court frankly conceded, ‘‘is still in search\nof a unifying principle . . . .’’ Id., 437; see also Turner\nv. Murray, 476 U.S. 28, 35, 106 S. Ct. 1683, 90 L. Ed. 2d\n27 (1986) (plurality opinion) (‘‘[b]ecause of the range\nof discretion entrusted to a jury in a capital sentencing\nhearing, there is a unique opportunity for racial preju-\ndice to operate’’).\n   In fact, in the four decades since the United States\nSupreme Court struck down the death penalty (as then\napplied) in Furman and then resuscitated it four years\nlater in Gregg, at least one-half dozen members of that\ncourt—jurists of all jurisprudential stripes—have con-\ncluded that the demands of Furman, on the one hand,\nand of Woodson and Lockett, on the other, are, ulti-\n\fmately, irreconcilable. In Furman itself, of the five con-\ncurring justices, two (Justices Brennan and Marshall)\ntook the position that capital punishment is so inher-\nently arbitrary as to constitute cruel and unusual pun-\nishment under all circumstances, and a third (Justice\nDouglas) opined that any nonmandatory capital sen-\ntencing scheme would be inherently subject to discrimi-\nnation and hence unconstitutional. See Furman v.\nGeorgia, supra, 408 U.S. 255 (Douglas, J., concurring)\n(‘‘we know that the discretion of judges and juries in\nimposing the death penalty enables the penalty to be\nselectively applied, feeding prejudices against the\naccused if he is poor and despised, and lacking political\nclout, or if he is a member of a suspect or unpopular\nminority, and saving those who by social position may\nbe in a more protected position’’); id., 294 (Brennan,\nJ., concurring) (‘‘[n]o one has yet suggested a rational\nbasis that could differentiate . . . the few who die\nfrom the many who go to prison’’); id., 365 (Marshall,\nJ., concurring) (‘‘committing to the untrammeled discre-\ntion of the jury the power to pronounce life or death\nin capital cases is . . . an open invitation to discrimina-\ntion’’ [internal quotation marks omitted]).\n   Justice Marshall elaborated on this ‘‘fundamental\ndefect’’ in the court’s eighth amendment jurisprudence\nin Godfrey v. Georgia, supra, 446 U.S. 420: ‘‘[A]ppellate\ncourts are incapable of guaranteeing the kind of objec-\ntivity and evenhandedness that the [c]ourt contem-\nplated and hoped for in Gregg. The disgraceful\ndistorting effects of racial discrimination and poverty\ncontinue to be painfully visible in the imposition of\ndeath sentences. . . . The task of eliminating arbitrari-\nness in the infliction of capital punishment is proving to\nbe one which our criminal justice system—and perhaps\nany criminal justice system—is unable to perform. . . .\n   ‘‘The . . . inability to administer . . . capital pun-\nishment . . . in an evenhanded fashion is . . . symp-\ntomatic of a deeper problem that is proving to be\ngenuinely intractable. . . .\n   ‘‘[T]he task of selecting in some objective way those\npersons who should be condemned to die is one that\nremains beyond the capacities of the criminal justice\nsystem. For this reason, I remain hopeful that even if\nthe [c]ourt is unwilling to accept the view that the death\npenalty is so barbaric that it is in all circumstances\ncruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the [e]ighth\nand [f]ourteenth [a]mendments, it may eventually con-\nclude that the effort to eliminate arbitrariness in the\ninfliction of that ultimate sanction is so plainly doomed\nto failure that it—and the death penalty—must be aban-\ndoned altogether.’’ (Citations omitted; footnotes omit-\nted.) Id., 439–42 (Marshall, J., concurring in the judg-\nment). Both Justices Stevens and Blackmun have\nreached similar conclusions. See Baze v. Rees, supra,\n553 U.S. 85 (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment)\n\f(‘‘[a] . . . significant concern is the risk of discrimina-\ntory application of the death penalty’’); Tuilaepa v. Cali-\nfornia, supra, 512 U.S. 991–92 (Blackmun, J.,\ndissenting) (‘‘One of the greatest evils of leaving jurors\nwith largely unguided discretion is the risk that this\ndiscretion will be exercised on the basis of constitution-\nally impermissible considerations—primary among\nthem, race. . . . For far too many jurors, the most\nimportant ‘circumstances of the crime’ are the race of\nthe victim or the defendant.’’ [Citations omitted.]).\n   Justice Scalia, while drawing a different legal conclu-\nsion than his more liberal brethren, has been no less\npersuaded by the premise that the United States\nSupreme Court’s Furman and Woodson/Lockett lines\nof jurisprudence are fundamentally incompatible: ‘‘Our\ncases proudly announce that the [c]onstitution effec-\ntively prohibits the [s]tates from excluding from the\nsentencing decision any aspect of a defendant’s charac-\nter or record, or any circumstance surrounding the\ncrime: that the defendant had a poor and deprived child-\nhood, or that he had a rich and spoiled childhood; that\nhe had a great love for the victim’s race, or that he had\na pathological hatred for the victim’s race; that he has\nlimited mental capacity, or that he has a brilliant mind\nwhich can make a great contribution to society; that\nhe was kind to his mother, or that he despised his\nmother.’’ (Emphasis in original.) Walton v. Arizona, 497\nU.S. 639, 663, 110 S. Ct. 3047, 111 L. Ed. 2d 511 (1990)\n(Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the\njudgment), overruled in part on other grounds by Ring\nv. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 122 S. Ct. 2428, 153 L. Ed. 2d\n556 (2002). ‘‘To acknowledge that there perhaps is an\ninherent tension between this line of cases and the line\nstemming from Furman,’’ Justice Scalia continued, ‘‘is\nrather like saying that there was perhaps an inherent\ntension between the [a]llies and the Axis Powers in\nWorld War II. And to refer to the two lines as pursuing\ntwin objectives . . . is rather like referring to the twin\nobjectives of good and evil. They cannot be reconciled.\n. . . The latter requirement quite obviously destroys\nwhatever rationality and predictability the former\nrequirement was designed to achieve.’’ (Citations omit-\nted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Walton v. Ari-\nzona, supra, 664–65 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in the judgment). ‘‘In short, the practice\nwhich in Furman had been described as the discretion\nto sentence to death and pronounced constitutionally\nprohibited, was in Woodson and Lockett renamed the\ndiscretion not to sentence to death and pronounced\nconstitutionally required.’’ Id., 662 (Scalia, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in the judgment).\n   Since we decided Ross in 1994, four members of this\ncourt likewise have concluded that the degree of fact\nfinder discretion required by the federal constitution\nmeans that the death penalty in Connecticut has been\nand inevitably will continue to be imposed with a degree\n\fof discrimination that is impermissible under the state\nconstitution. See State v. Santiago, supra, 305 Conn.\n324 (Harper, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart) (‘‘invidious discrimination . . . pave[s] a\nsmoother path to execution for a subset of the popula-\ntion’’); State v.

Bright, ‘‘Discrimination, Death and Denial:\nThe Tolerance of Racial Discrimination in Infliction of\nthe Death Penalty,’’ 35 Santa Clara L. Rev. 433, 434\n(1995) (‘‘race and poverty continue to determine who\ndies’’); G. Dix, ‘‘Appellate Review of the Decision to\nImpose Death,’’ 68 Geo. L.J. 97, 161 (1979) (concluding\nthat Gregg and its companion cases ‘‘mandate pursuit\nof an impossible goal’’). In 1973, former Yale Law School\nDean Louis H. Pollak, testifying regarding the legisla-\nture’s efforts to craft a new post-Furman capital murder\nstatute, opined that ‘‘[t]he conclusion that this [b]ill is\nunconstitutional is not a criticism of the drafters, it\nis rather a recognition that they were undertaking a\nconstitutional impossibility. Maintaining the idea of a\ndeath sentence while [e]nsuring that it would in practice\nalmost never be imposed, the result necessarily is not\n\fmerely [that] death sentence[s] would be rarities but\nthat those rarities would occur wantonly and freakishly\nand hence, unconstitutionally.’’ (Internal quotation\nmarks omitted.) 16 S. Proc., Pt. 4, 1973 Sess., p. 1892.\n   After thoroughly reviewing the operation of Connecti-\ncut’s capital sentencing scheme over the past four\ndecades, we are persuaded that these critiques are well\nfounded and that the opportunity for the exercise of\nunfettered discretion at key decision points in the pro-\ncess has meant that the ultimate punishment has not\nbeen reserved for the worst of the worst offenders.\nThere is no doubt that our death row has counted among\nits residents the perpetrators of some of the most hei-\nnous crimes in Connecticut history. It is equally clear,\nhowever, that the process of selecting offenders for\nexecution has been both under inclusive and over inclu-\nsive. Many who commit truly horrific crimes are spared,\nwhereas certain defendants whose crimes are, by all\nobjective measures, less brutal are condemned to death.\nThe defendant in the present case is, perhaps, the clear-\nest example. He shot the sole victim, an adult white\nmale, in his sleep, killing him instantly. The defendant\nhad no prior criminal convictions. And yet, of the seven-\nteen offenders convicted of committing capital eligible\nmurders for hire in the state since 1973, Eduardo Santi-\nago was the only one sentenced to death.106 To the\nextent that the population of death row has been chosen\non grounds other than the atrocity of the offenders’\ncrimes, this would undermine all confidence that capital\npunishment, as applied, is morally proportionate and\nserves a legitimate retributive function in Connecti-\ncut.107\n                             C\n                        Vengeance\n   Finally, it bears emphasizing that, to the extent that\nthe statutory history of P.A. 12-5 reveals anything with\nrespect to the legislature’s purpose in prospectively\nabolishing the death penalty while retaining it for the\nhandful of individuals now on death row, it is that the\nprimary rationale for this dichotomy was neither deter-\nrence nor retribution but, rather, vengeance—the Hyde\nto retribution’s Jekyll. Vengeance, unlike retribution, is\npersonal in nature; it is motivated by emotion, and may\neven relish in the suffering of the offender. See R. Noz-\nick, Philosophical Explanations (1981) p. 367. Accord-\ningly, vengeance traditionally has not been considered\na constitutionally permissible justification for criminal\nsanctions. See Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399, 410,\n106 S. Ct. 2595, 91 L. Ed. 2d 335 (1986) (finding no\nretributive value in ‘‘the barbarity of exacting mindless\nvengeance’’). On the contrary, ‘‘[i]t is of vital importance\nto the defendant and to the community that any decision\nto impose the death sentence be, and appear to be,\nbased on reason rather than caprice or emotion.’’ Gard-\nner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349, 358, 97 S. Ct. 1197, 51 L.\n\fEd. 2d 393 (1977) (plurality opinion).\n   There are, no doubt, cases in which the line between\na principled commitment to retributive justice and an\nimpermissible acquiescence to private vengeance is a\ngray one. There is every indication, however, that P.A.\n12-5 was crafted primarily to maintain the possibility of\nexecuting two particular offenders—the much reviled\nperpetrators of the widely publicized 2007 home inva-\nsion and murder of three members of Cheshire’s Petit\nfamily. K. Barry, supra, 35 Cardozo L. Rev. 1837–38. In\nsuggesting that the legislators who voted in favor of a\nsolely prospective repeal of the death penalty were\nequally committed to executing the defendant in the\npresent case and other inmates on Connecticut’s death\nrow, Chief Justice Rogers ignores the overwhelming\nevidence that the perpetrators in the Cheshire case,\nJoshua Komisarjevsky and Steven Hayes, were the prin-\ncipal targets of the decision to retain the death penalty\nretroactively.108 There is certainly no question what\nmotivated one state senator, who opined that ‘‘ ‘[t]hey\nshould bypass the trial [in the Cheshire case] and take\nthat second animal and hang him by his penis from a\ntree out in the middle of Main Street . . . .’ ’’109\n   It has been suggested that it would be a morally\npermissible ‘‘sacrifice’’ for Connecticut to allow those\nmen currently on death row to be executed so as to\nhasten the abolition of capital punishment in other juris-\ndictions. K. Barry, ‘‘From Wolves, Lambs (Part I): The\nEighth Amendment Case for Gradual Abolition of the\nDeath Penalty,’’ 66 Fla. L. Rev. 313, 325 (2014). Such\njudgments are not for us to make. We can say, however,\nthat it would not be constitutionally permissible to exe-\ncute the defendant in the present case, and others simi-\nlarly situated, without any legitimate penological pur-\npose, merely to achieve the politically popular end of\nkilling two especially notorious inmates.\n                            D\n                       Conclusion\n   For all of these reasons, the death penalty no longer\nserves any legitimate penological goal in our state. As\nJudge Kozinski concludes, ‘‘we have little more than\nan illusion of a death penalty in this country. To be\nsure, we have capital trials; we have convictions and\ndeath sentences imposed; we have endless and mas-\nsively costly reviews by the state and federal courts;\nand we do have a small number of people executed\neach year. But the number of executions compared to\nthe number of people who have been sentenced to\ndeath is minuscule, and the gap is widening every year.\nWhatever purposes the death penalty is said to serve—\ndeterrence, retribution, assuaging the pain suffered by\nvictims’ families—these purposes are not served by the\nsystem as it now operates.’’ (Footnotes omitted.) A.\nKozinski & S. Gallagher, supra, 46 Case W. Res. L. Rev.\n\f3–4. We therefore conclude that, following the enact-\nment of P.A. 12-5, capital punishment also violates arti-\ncle first, §§ 8 and 9, of the Connecticut constitution\nbecause it no longer serves any legitimate penologi-\ncal purpose.110\n                            IV\n    RESPONSE TO THE DISSENTING JUSTICES\n  Lastly, we take this opportunity to address briefly\ncertain general arguments that the dissenting justices\nhave raised. Although we recognize and respect that\ntheir opinions are grounded in a principled and com-\nmendable commitment to judicial restraint, we find\nthem to be unpersuasive and, in a few instances, some-\nwhat troubling.\n                             A\n         Whether the Questions Decided Are\n             Properly before the Court\n   We first address Chief Justice Rogers’ argument that\nsome of the issues, evidence, and arguments considered\nin this opinion are not properly before this court. Specif-\nically, she contends that (1) some of the arguments that\nwe consider in this opinion never were raised by the\ndefendant, (2) the parties were not afforded an adequate\nopportunity to brief the issues addressed in this opinion,\nand (3) the majority relies on research and statistics\nthat are not properly the subject of judicial notice. We\nconsider each argument in turn.\n                             1\n Arguments Allegedly Not Raised by the Defendant\n   Chief Justice Rogers first contends that we improp-\nerly have considered certain arguments that the defen-\ndant himself has not raised. For example, she contends\nthat the defendant did not adequately preserve the argu-\nments that (1) the death penalty is rarely imposed in\nConnecticut, (2) the death penalty has slowly fallen out\nof use in Connecticut, and (3) other states recently have\nabolished the death penalty, while respected profes-\nsional organizations, such as the American Law Insti-\ntute, no longer support its use. We are not persuaded\nby this contention.\n   We begin by noting that the defendant indisputably\npreserved the claim that, following the enactment of\nP.A. 12-5, the death penalty now offends the state consti-\ntution in that it (1) fails to comport with contemporary\nstandards of decency, and (2) is now devoid of any\nlegitimate penological value.111 We recognized as much\nin our initial decision in this case; see State v. Santiago,\nsupra, 305 Conn. 307–308 n.167; and, on reconsidera-\ntion, the defendant dedicates pages of discussion to\nthis claim in his supplemental briefs. Indeed, his argu-\nment on reconsideration begins with the statement that\n‘‘[P.A. 12-5] represents the considered judgment of our\n\flegislature and governor that the death penalty is no\nlonger consistent with standards of decency in Connect-\nicut and does not serve any valid penological objective.’’\nThat is precisely the issue that we have considered in\nparts II and III of this opinion.\n   Chief Justice Rogers’ objection, then, is merely that\nthe defendant did not brief the issue in sufficient depth,\nand, specifically, that he did not expressly address cer-\ntain facts and factors—the accuracy of which is not\nreasonably in dispute—on which we rely in this opinion.\nHer view appears to be that, even though a significant\nchange in the legal landscape, such as the prospective\nrepeal of the death penalty, may warrant a full review\nof whether that punishment remains consistent with\ncontemporary standards of decency, and even though\nthat analysis necessarily encompasses the consider-\nation of various factors and historical developments\nthat this court and other courts have considered in past\ncases involving challenges to the death penalty on other\ngrounds, we may take those factors into consideration\nin the present case only if the defendant fully briefs\neach of them anew. This makes little sense.\n  In the present case, the defendant, in his initial\nappeal, submitted an opening brief of nearly 300 pages,\nin which he raised more than twenty distinct legal\nclaims. He also submitted a 122 page reply brief, as\nwell as more than 2000 pages of appendices. Upon our\ngrant of reconsideration, he submitted approximately\n200 more pages of briefing and appendices, addressing\nnew legal claims. The state, of course, responded with\nmany hundreds of pages of its own briefing and\nappendices.\n  Rather than exhaustively brief every aspect of the\nquestion of whether capital punishment now offends\nthe state constitution, the defendant chose instead to\nfocus on the impact of the enactment of P.A. 12-5 on\nthat question, and to incorporate by reference the other\nfactors that this court has considered at length in previ-\nous capital appeals. The state, in rejecting the defen-\ndant’s constitutional claim, likewise relied primarily on\nreferences to our prior cases. We can only assume that\nthis choice represented a calculated decision, by both\nparties, that, with their briefs already taking up more\nthan a ream of paper, resources—both natural and judi-\ncial—would be better addressed to the novel issues\npresented by the defendant’s case, and that we had\nmore than sufficient resources at our disposal to allow\nus to fully review the present constitutionality of capital\npunishment in a thorough and comprehensive manner.\nThis decision was perfectly reasonable.\n  The approach that Chief Justice Rogers advocates\nwould force counsel representing defendants in capital\nappeals to make a Hobson’s choice. When, as in the\npresent case, this court previously has rejected a consti-\ntutional claim, counsel either would have to (1) forgo\n\fthat and related claims for all subsequent capital defen-\ndants, or (2) fully brief each aspect of the issue in each\ncapital appeal, repeatedly addressing every potential\nargument, legal theory, and constitutional fact that this\ncourt might find relevant or persuasive, on the mere\npossibility that we might agree that intervening develop-\nments warrant a fresh consideration of the issue or\npresent novel grounds for finding a constitutional viola-\ntion. If counsel followed the first path, we would be\nprecluded from ever revisiting important constitutional\nquestions, even those where, as in the case of cruel and\nunusual punishment, the legal standard itself envisions\nthat punishments once permissible may over time come\nto offend the constitution. If counsel followed the sec-\nond path, capital appeals, which are already deplorably\nprolonged, expensive, and resource intensive, would\ngrow even more so. Forcing such a choice would be\nboth unwise and unjust.\n   Rather, we believe that appellate counsel in the pre-\nsent appeal made a prudent and appropriate decision\nto raise, and thereby preserve, the constitutional claim;\nto submit thoughtful and informative supplemental\nbriefing to address those novel questions and key devel-\nopments for which we concluded that additional brief-\ning would be helpful; and, with respect to paths already\ntraveled, simply to direct our attention to prior cases\nin which potentially relevant factors have been more\nfully vetted.112 Under the particular circumstances of\nthis capital appeal, nothing more was required.\n  For the same reasons, it would be inappropriate to\narbitrarily restrict our analysis of the constitutionality\nof capital punishment to those facts and circumstances\nthat have been identified expressly by the parties. In\nfact, although we generally do not consider claims or\nissues that the parties themselves have not raised; see,\ne.g., Blumberg Associates Worldwide, Inc. v. Brown &\nBrown of Connecticut, Inc., 311 Conn. 123, 142, 84 A.3d\n840 (2014); in cases too numerous to mention, we have\nconsidered arguments or factors pertaining to those\nclaims or issues that were not expressly identified by\nthe parties. See id., 148 (‘‘when [a case] is properly\nbefore the court, the court is not limited to the particular\nlegal theories advanced by the parties, but rather retains\nthe independent power to identify and apply the proper\nconstruction of governing law’’ [internal quotation\nmarks omitted]); cf. Rowe v. Superior Court, 289 Conn.\n649, 661–63, 960 A.2d 256 (2008) (concluding that defen-\ndant had preserved issue for appeal because theories\nrelated to single legal claim even though defendant had\nnot raised each theory at trial); Vine v. Zoning Board\nof Appeals, 281 Conn. 553, 569, 916 A.2d 5 (2007)\n(addressing alternative ground for affirmance that was\nnot raised at trial because, inter alia, issue was ‘‘closely\nintertwined’’ with certified question); Imperial Casu-\nalty & Indemnity Co. v. State, 246 Conn. 313, 322–23,\n714 A.2d 1230 (1998) (considering argument that defen-\n\fdants raised because court already was obliged to per-\nform full and thorough review of trial court’s decision\non contested issue of insurance coverage and defen-\ndants’ argument did not raise entirely new issue). This\nis especially so when plenary consideration is necessary\nto thoroughly address and accurately decide constitu-\ntional claims and other matters of substantial public\nimportance, our resolution of which will surely redound\nto the benefit or detriment of parties not presently\nbefore the court.\n   Furthermore, the critiques that Chief Justice Rogers\nlevels are particularly ill suited to the present case. As\nChief Justice Rogers herself acknowledges, it is well\nestablished that, before ruling on the constitutionality\nof a challenged mode of punishment, a court must con-\nduct its own independent review to determine whether\nthat punishment remains suitable to the crime and con-\ntinues to serve any legitimate penological objective.113\nSee, e.g., State v. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 197; see also\nGraham v. Florida, supra, 560 U.S. 80; Atkins v. Vir-\nginia, supra, 536 U.S. 312. It would be difficult, if not\nimpossible, for us to fulfill our constitutional duty in\nthis regard if we were barred from considering basic\nfactual questions such as how frequently the punish-\nment is imposed or whether its ongoing use retains the\napproval of our sister states, legal scholars, and other\nsources of persuasive authority. We routinely look to\nsuch sources when deciding legal questions of first\nimpression—often with regrettably sparse assistance\nfrom the parties’ briefing—and we see no reason why\nthe scope of our review should be more fettered when\ndeciding significant constitutional questions. This is\nespecially true in capital cases, in which courts rou-\ntinely, and quite properly, provide accommodations not\nalways afforded in other, less compelling circum-\nstances. See State v. Cobb, 234 Conn. 735, 763, 663\nA.2d 948 (1995) (‘‘the nature of the defendant’s claim\nof systemic racial bias, and the seriousness and finality\nof the death penalty, counsel against raising any undue\nprocedural barriers to review of such a claim’’).\n                            2\n               Opportunity for Briefing\n   Chief Justice Rogers next contends that it was\nimproper for the court to consider the issues that we\nhave decided without first affording the parties a full\nopportunity to brief them. We disagree. The truth is\nthat the parties did have the opportunity to brief the\nissue of whether the death penalty now violates the\nstate constitution. As we have explained, each party\nmade what we presume to be a calculated and reason-\nable decision to focus its argument on the legal conse-\nquences of the enactment of P.A. 12-5 and the novel\nquestions presented thereby, and, in essence, to incor-\nporate by reference our prior decisions, both majority\nand dissenting opinions, that address, in the context of\n\feither per se or as applied challenges, other constitu-\ntionally relevant factors. The purpose of our preserva-\ntion requirements—‘‘to ensure fair notice of a party’s\nclaims to both the trial court and opposing parties’’—\nwas thereby satisfied. White v. Mazda Motor of\nAmerica, Inc., 313 Conn. 610, 620, 99 A.3d 1079 (2014).\n  Nor do we believe that, in so doing, the parties\ndeprived this court of the opportunity to perform its\nconstitutionally mandated independent review of the\ndeath penalty in a fully informed manner. These are\nmatters about which courts, historians, legal scholars,\nand social scientists have written extensively, both in\nConnecticut and nationally. The relevant legislative his-\ntory and constitutional facts are properly subject to\njudicial notice. The legal arguments are well trodden\nand not unfamiliar to us. After a decade of appeals in\nthis case, and several previous rounds of supplemental\nbriefing, our priority now must be to provide the parties,\nthe victims’ families, and the people of Connecticut\nwith some measure of clarity and resolution.\n                              3\n                 Extra-Record Materials\n  Chief Justice Rogers also maintains that we have\nrelied on extra-record materials that, she argues, are\nnot properly the subject of judicial notice. Again, we\ndisagree.\n   Although finding the adjudicative facts that concern\nthe parties and events of a particular case is largely the\nprovince of the jury—or the trial court in cases tried\nto the court—appellate courts tasked with determining\nthe content of law and policy may take notice of consti-\ntutional and legislative facts, such as historical sources\nand scientific and sociological studies. See footnote 44\nof this opinion. It is well established that ‘‘[t]he intellec-\ntual legitimacy of [judicial decisions in which the court\ntakes notice of legislative facts to ascertain constitu-\ntional norms] turns [on] the actual truth-content of the\nlegislative facts taken into account by the judges who\npropound the decision. While not necessarily indisput-\nably true, it would appear that these legislative facts\nmust at least appear to be more likely than not true if\nthe opinion is going to have the requisite intellectual\nlegitimacy [on] which the authority of judge-made rules\nis ultimately founded.’’ (Emphasis added.) 2 K. Broun,\nMcCormick on Evidence (7th Ed. 2013) § 331, pp. 612–\n13. Although Chief Justice Rogers accuses the majority\nof relying on ‘‘cherry picked,’’ extra-record materials;\nfootnote 30 of Chief Justice Rogers’ dissenting opinion;\nshe never specifically explains why she thinks the\nsources on which the majority relies, taken together,\nfail to satisfy this ‘‘more likely than not true’’ standard.\n2 K. Broun, supra, § 331, p. 613. She is unable to point\nto any methodological flaws in the social science and\nother research studies cited in this opinion, to challenge\n\fthe authors’ qualifications, or to direct our attention to\nany conflicting research of equal quality and breadth.\nShe fails to cite to any sources that undermine the\nmeticulous historical research provided by Collier, Con-\nnecticut’s state historian, or Holdsworth’s voluminous\nreview of early Connecticut legal history, or Professor\nGoodheart’s award winning treatise. Nor is there any\nsuggestion that the death penalty statistics that we have\npresented are inaccurate or misleading. In reality, the\nsociological research and historical facts on which we\nrely far exceed the governing more likely than not true\nstandard, and they are not subject to reasonable dis-\npute.\n   It is also noteworthy that the authorities on which\nChief Justice Rogers relies for the proposition that legis-\nlative fact-finding by appellate courts is improper\ninclude a law review article that begins by lamenting\nthat ‘‘[m]any of the [United States] Supreme Court’s\nmost significant decisions turn on questions of [legisla-\ntive] fact.’’ A. Larsen, ‘‘Confronting Supreme Court Fact\nFinding,’’ 98 Va. L. Rev. 1255, 1255 (2012). To be clear,\nthen, Chief Justice Rogers’ complaint is not that the\nmajority uses social science research in a manner that\nappellate courts ordinarily do not but merely that she\nand a handful of law professors personally disapprove\nof this common practice.\n   The sources on which Chief Justice Rogers relies\ncontend that legislative fact-finding by appellate tribu-\nnals is subject to bias and error, and that it deprives\nthe parties of the opportunity to participate fully in the\nadversarial truth seeking process. There is no doubt\nthat appellate review of legislative facts, as with virtu-\nally every other form of truth seeking in which human\nbeings engage, can be an imperfect process. Ultimately,\nhowever, the practice has been approved and adopted\nbecause there simply is no better alternative. Appellate\ncourts frequently are called on to make quasi-legislative\npolicy judgments, whether in crafting state common\nlaw, construing open-ended constitutional and statu-\ntory mandates, or simply determining whether a partic-\nular interpretation of a statute would ‘‘lead to absurd\nconsequences or bizarre results.’’ (Internal quotation\nmarks omitted.) Raftopol v. Ramey, 299 Conn. 681, 703,\n12 A.3d 783 (2011). These policy judgments often hinge\non facts about the world in which we live, facts the\nstudy of which is the domain of natural and social\nscientists. See 2 K. Broun, supra, § 331, pp. 610–15. If\nwe were to follow the counsel of Chief Justice Rogers,\nand submit every such question to the crucible of\nadversarial fact-finding in a trial court, the wheels of\njustice would quickly grind to a halt.114\n  Ultimately, and most importantly, Chief Justice Rog-\ners, having criticized our consideration of extra-record\nmaterials, fails to identify so much as a single statistic\nor historical fact cited in this opinion that she believes\n\fis subject to reasonable dispute. Accordingly, having\ncarefully considered Chief Justice Rogers’ arguments,\nwe continue to have every confidence that the constitu-\ntional and legislative facts on which we rely are a proper\nsubject of judicial notice, are more likely than not true,\nand paint an accurate picture of the historical and con-\ntemporary record of capital punishment in Connecticut\nand the United States.\n                            B\n         Connecticut’s Historical Acceptance\n              of Capital Punishment\n   We next address the argument of the dissenting jus-\ntices that capital punishment cannot now offend the\nconstitution of Connecticut because (1) there are refer-\nences to capital punishment in the text of both the 1818\nand 1965 state constitutions, (2) the framers of the 1818\nconstitution believed that the death penalty was an\nappropriate punishment for the most serious crimes,\nand (3) in 1965, the constitutional convention declined\nto adopt a constitutional provision that would have\nprohibited capital punishment. The premises of the dis-\nsents’ argument are undoubtedly true. The conclusion\nis not.\n   It is certainly the case that, although Connecticut has\nsteadily reduced the number of crimes subject to capital\npunishment over the past four centuries, the death pen-\nalty has continued during that period to be authorized\nby statute, and it is referenced in our state constitution.\nThere also is little doubt that the framers of the state\nconstitution considered the death penalty to be an\nacceptable form of punishment, under certain circum-\nstances and if properly applied. Although the dissenting\njustices reiterate these facts throughout their opinions,\nthey fail to explain exactly how our state’s historical\nacceptance of the death penalty answers the primary\nquestion presented by this appeal, namely, whether,\nfollowing the enactment of P.A. 12-5, capital punish-\nment now constitutes excessive and disproportionate\npunishment when viewed through the lens of our state’s\ncontemporary standards of decency.\n   As we have explained, the constitutionally relevant\ninquiry is whether the death penalty, as currently\nadministered in Connecticut, and following the enact-\nment of P.A. 12-5, offends our state’s evolving standards\nof decency, and whether that punishment continues to\nsatisfy any legitimate penological objective. Although\nthe fact that the death penalty was considered accept-\nable 50 or 200 years ago might be relevant to a challenge\ncontending that capital punishment is inherently uncon-\nstitutional; see State v. Ross, supra, 230 Conn. 249–50;\nit says little about whether capital punishment is consti-\ntutional today, in light of our legislature’s most recent\npronouncement on the issue, and given what we now\nunderstand and what our elected officials have deter-\n\fmined regarding capital punishment’s lack of deterrent\nvalue, the potential for irredeemable error, a pattern of\npersistently arbitrary and discriminatory application,\nand our state’s inability to administer the death penalty\nin a way that affords closure and solace to the families\nof the victims.\n   As the Supreme Court of California has recognized,\nincidental references to the death penalty in a state\nconstitution merely acknowledge that the penalty was\nin use at the time of drafting; they do not forever\nenshrine the death penalty’s constitutional status as\nstandards of decency continue to evolve: ‘‘It has been\nsuggested that we are . . . restrained from considering\nwhether capital punishment is proscribed by [the state\nconstitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual\npunishment] since the death penalty is expressly or\nimpliedly recognized in several other provisions of the\nCalifornia constitution. We perceive no possible con-\nflict or repugnance between those provisions . . .\nhowever, for none of the incidental references to the\ndeath penalty purport to give its existence constitu-\ntional stature. They do no more than recognize its exis-\ntence at the time of their adoption. Thus, the bail clause\nof [the California constitution] restricts the right to bail\nin capital cases . . . [and] the due process clause . . .\nensures that life will not be taken without due process\n. . . . None of these provisions can be construed as\nan affirmative exemption of capital punishment from\nthe compass of the cruel or unusual punishment clause\nof [the California constitution].’’ (Footnote omitted.)\nPeople v. Anderson, supra, 6 Cal. 3d 637–38. The United\nStates Supreme Court likewise has indicated that the\nmere fact that the federal constitution makes reference\nto capital crimes does not mean that contemporary\nstandards of decency may not evolve to the point that\nthe death penalty is no longer constitutionally permissi-\nble. See Gregg v. Georgia, supra, 428 U.S. 176–82 (opin-\nion announcing judgment).\n   It may well be that, at bottom, the opposition of\nthe dissenting justices reflects their disapproval of the\nevolving standards of decency test itself, a legal stan-\ndard according to which a penalty that once passed\nconstitutional muster may, within a relatively brief span\nof time, come to be deemed cruel and unusual. See,\ne.g., Roper v. Simmons, supra, 543 U.S. 574–75, 578\n(overruling Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U.S. 361, 109 S.\nCt. 2969, 106 L. Ed. 2d 306 [1989], in prohibiting execu-\ntion of individuals who were under eighteen years old\nwhen they committed capital crime); Atkins v. Vir-\nginia, supra, 536 U.S. 321 (overruling Penry v.\nLynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 109 S. Ct. 2934, 106 L. Ed. 2d\n256 [1989], in holding that execution of intellectually\ndisabled individuals is unconstitutional). But that is the\nlaw of the land, both federally and in Connecticut. In\nthe case of the death penalty, the past several years\nhave witnessed dramatic changes in the legal landscape,\n\fmost significant of which was the decision by the\nelected branches to abolish capital punishment for all\nfuture offenses. Whatever role the death penalty may\nonce have played in our system of justice, it is clear\nthat our elected representatives, acting on behalf of the\npeople of this state, have repudiated the death penalty\nas a sentencing option unworthy of continued sup-\nport.115\n                             C\n   Whether Deference to the Legislature Requires\n            That We Uphold P.A. 12-5\n   We next address the argument of the dissenting jus-\ntices that, in holding that the death penalty now violates\nthe constitution of Connecticut, we have failed to pay\nadequate deference to the will of the legislature. Each\nof the dissenting justices argues, in essence, that a\nreviewing court is bound to accept what the dissenting\njustices maintain to be the judgment of the legislature—\nthat the death penalty comports with contemporary\nstandards of decency and serves legitimate penological\ninterests—and that to do otherwise is to usurp the\nproper role of the legislature in order to advance judges’\npersonal moral agendas.116 We already have rejected\nthis argument in State v. Ross, supra, 230 Conn. 248–49,\nhowever, recognizing that it fundamentally misunder-\nstands the well established function and role of judicial\nreview in the capital sentencing context.\n   We begin by reiterating that, although the legislature\nvoted to abolish capital punishment on a solely prospec-\ntive basis, this by no means reflects or embodies a\ndetermination that the death penalty remains consonant\nwith contemporary standards of decency and continues\nto serve the goal of deterrence or retribution. The pro-\nspective nature of P.A. 12-5 instead appears to reflect\na belief on the part of some legislators that prior com-\nmitments the state has made to relatives of murder\nvictims justify the retention of capital punishment for\nuse in those cases. Capital punishment may, in other\nwords, simply be the lesser of two evils. Public Act 12-\n5 also likely reflects a purely political decision to placate\nthe public’s desire to exact vengeance on certain notori-\nous inmates, while passing along to this court the task of\nfinally decommissioning the state’s machinery of death.\nThere is abundant evidence in the legislative history to\nsupport both of these interpretations. See parts II B\nand III C of this opinion.\n  If we assume, for the sake of argument, however,\nthat a majority of the legislature has in fact determined\nthat capital punishment remains a morally acceptable\npunishment that serves legitimate penological interests,\nthe question arises as to the proper scope of this court’s\nreview. It is well established that, under both the federal\nand state constitutions, a criminal sentence challenged\nas unconstitutionally excessive or disproportionate\n\fmust undergo two stages of judicial review. First, the\nreviewing court determines whether the punishment\noffends contemporary standards of decency, as evi-\ndenced by the various factors discussed in part II of\nthis opinion. Legislative enactments are one of those\nconsiderations, but certainly not the only one. Second,\nthe court is required to exercise its own independent\njudgment as to whether the punishment remains suit-\nable to the crime and continues to serve any legitimate\npenological purpose. As the United States Supreme\nCourt explained in Atkins v. Virginia, supra, 536 U.S.\n304, although the current legislative judgment is of great\nimportance, ‘‘the [c]onstitution contemplates that in the\nend our own judgment will be brought to bear on the\nquestion of the acceptability of the death penalty under\nthe [e]ighth [a]mendment.’’ (Internal quotation marks\nomitted.) Id., 312. A punishment, therefore, must satisfy\nboth levels of review to survive constitutional scrutiny.\nSuch scrutiny is especially critical in the present case\nbecause, to our knowledge, we are the first court in\nthe modern era to comprehensively address the issue\nof whether the death penalty can remain consonant\nwith society’s evolving standards of decency and serve\nlegitimate penological interests following a prospective\nonly repeal.\n   Although Chief Justice Rogers concedes, as she must,\nthat a challenged punishment is subject to this type of\nclose judicial scrutiny, she nevertheless maintains that,\nbecause the constitutional authority to define crimes\nand to fix the degree and method of punishment belongs\nto the legislature, once the legislature has determined\nthat a particular punishment is appropriate and morally\nacceptable, that determination is, essentially, disposi-\ntive. If that were the case, then judicial review would\nbe a weak tea indeed. When an appellate court is asked\nto pass on the constitutionality of a mode of punish-\nment, it is, almost invariably, after a defendant has been\nfound guilty of a crime and sentenced in accordance\nwith a duly enacted penal statute. If the fact that an\nelected legislature had authorized and enacted the pun-\nishment in question were enough to insulate it from\njudicial scrutiny, then the freedom from cruel and\nunusual punishment would be a hollow one. See People\nv. Anderson, supra, 6 Cal. 3d 640 (‘‘[w]ere it otherwise,\nthe [l]egislature would ever be the sole judge of the\npermissible means and extent of punishment and . . .\nthe [c]onstitution would be superfluous’’ [citation omit-\nted]). ‘‘We know that the [f]ramers did not envision so\nnarrow a role for this basic guaranty of human rights.’’\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) District Attorney\nv. Watson, supra, 381 Mass. 662.\n   In dismissing the United States Supreme Court’s\nrepeated statements as to the importance of this inde-\npendent judicial review process, Chief Justice Rogers\nfails to explain why the high court would continue to\nemphasize that ‘‘[t]he [c]onstitution contemplates that\n\fin the end our own judgment will be brought to bear on\nthe question of the acceptability of the death penalty’’;\n(internal quotation marks omitted) Hall v. Florida,\nsupra, 134 S. Ct. 1999; and that ‘‘[t]hat exercise of inde-\npendent judgment is the [c]ourt’s judicial duty’’; id.,\n2000; if that were not the law. Instead, Chief Justice\nRogers merely queries how truly independent judicial\nreview of an allegedly cruel and unusual punishment\ncan be reconciled with the observation by that court, in\na 1989 decision, that, ‘‘ ‘[i]n determining what standards\nhave ‘‘evolved’’ . . . [the court has] looked not to [its]\nown conceptions of decency, but to those of modern\nAmerican society as a whole.’ ’’ Footnote 33 of Chief\nJustice Rogers’ dissenting opinion, quoting Stanford v.\nKentucky, supra, 492 U.S. 369. Of course, we do not\ndisagree with the cited language from Stanford insofar\nas independent judicial review must stand on the court’s\nprincipled consideration of the available evidence\nregarding a punishment’s penological merits, rather\nthan the personal predilections of individual judges.\nThe short answer to Chief Justice Rogers’ question,\nhowever, is that Stanford, which was an outlier at the\ntime it was decided, subsequently was overruled by\nRoper v. Simmons, supra, 543 U.S. 574–75, 578, and is\nno longer good law. See id., 574 (overruling holding of\nStanford that persons under eighteen years of age at\ntime of capital offense may be executed and explaining\nthat, ‘‘to the extent Stanford was based on a rejection\nof the idea that [the] [c]ourt is required to bring its\nindependent judgment to bear on the proportionality\nof the death penalty for a particular class of crimes or\noffenders . . . it suffices to note that this rejection was\ninconsistent with prior [e]ighth [a]mendment deci-\nsions’’ [citations omitted]). In fact, in Roper, the court\ntook pains to reiterate that ‘‘[t]he beginning point is a\nreview of objective indicia of consensus, as expressed\nin particular by the enactments of legislatures that have\naddressed the question. These data give us essential\ninstruction. We then must determine, in the exercise\nof our own independent judgment, whether the death\npenalty is a disproportionate punishment . . . .’’\n(Emphasis added.) Id., 564.\n   In reality, the United States Supreme Court has, on\nmultiple occasions, held that punishments that were\nduly enacted by democratically elected legislatures\nwere nevertheless unconstitutionally excessive and dis-\nproportionate under this standard. See, e.g., Hall v.\nFlorida, supra, 134 S. Ct. 1990, 2001 (holding that Flor-\nida law foreclosing further exploration of capital defen-\ndant’s intellectual disability if his IQ score is more than\nseventy violated eighth amendment); Thompson v.\nOklahoma, supra, 487 U.S. 838 (declaring as unconstitu-\ntional death penalty for offender who was under sixteen\nyears old when he committed capital offense). Indeed,\nthere are numerous cases in which that court and other\nfederal and state courts have held democratically\n\fenacted criminal sanctions to be devoid of penological\nvalue, and thus unconstitutionally excessive, without\nrelying on any predicate finding that those sanctions\nhad lost their popular support. See, e.g., Solem v. Helm,\n463 U.S. 277, 281, 292–94, 303, 103 S. Ct. 3001, 77 L. Ed.\n2d 637 (1983) (concluding that courts are competent\nto apply ‘‘generally accepted criteria’’ to assess indepen-\ndently relative severity of criminal offenses and senten-\nces for purposes of eighth amendment proportionality\nanalysis, and holding that sentence of life imprisonment\nfor writing $100 check with intent to defraud was uncon-\nstitutionally excessive); Furman v. Georgia, supra, 408\nU.S. 239–40 (holding death penalty unconstitutional as\nthen applied in Georgia and Texas, even though forty-\none state legislatures had approved of its use and polling\ndata was mixed); Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660,\n667, 82 S. Ct. 1417, 8 L. Ed. 2d 758 (1962) (holding that\nCalifornia statute authorizing jail sentence for narcotics\naddiction inflicted cruel and unusual punishment in\nviolation of eighth and fourteenth amendments); Weems\nv. United States, supra, 217 U.S. 357–58, 367, 377 (con-\ncluding that traditional Philippine punishment of years\nof hard and painful labor was unconstitutionally exces-\nsive punishment for crime of falsifying public docu-\nment, even if punishment conformed to customs, habits,\nand prejudices of resident population, and that punish-\nment would have been excessive even if authorized by\nfederal law); People v. Anderson, supra, 6 Cal. 3d 641\n(holding that capital punishment violated state constitu-\ntion and explaining that court ‘‘would abdicate [its]\nresponsibility to examine independently the question\nwere [its] inquiry to begin and end with the fact that\nstatutory provisions authorizing [the] imposition of the\ndeath penalty have been recently enacted’’); see also\nKennedy v. Louisiana, supra, 554 U.S. 461 (Alito, J.,\ndissenting) (indicating that court had exercised its own\nindependent judgment in holding that death penalty\nwas excessive and disproportionate penalty for rape of\nchild); Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 945, 129 S. Ct.\n1, 171 L. Ed. 2d 932 (2008) (Scalia, J., respecting the\ndenial of rehearing) (observing that court in Kennedy\nhad exercised its own judgment while noting that par-\nties had failed to call court’s attention to fact that Con-\ngress and the president recently had reauthorized death\npenalty for military personnel convicted of child rape).\nDespite her attempt to distinguish each of these cases,\nChief Justice Rogers simply cannot wipe away a century\nof eighth amendment jurisprudence.\n   Nor has the United States Supreme Court ever\nreviewed an eighth amendment challenge under the\nhighly deferential rational basis standard that Chief Jus-\ntice Rogers would apparently have this court apply. As\nJustice White explained in Furman, ‘‘[j]udicial review,\nby definition, often involves a conflict between judicial\nand legislative judgment as to what the [c]onstitution\nmeans or requires. . . . It seems conceded by all that\n\f. . . there are punishments that the [eighth] [a]mend-\nment would bar whether legislatively approved or not.\nInevitably, then, there will be occasions when [the\ncourt] will differ with Congress or state legislatures\nwith respect to the validity of punishment.’’ Furman v.\nGeorgia, supra, 408 U.S. 313–14 (White, J., concurring).\nChief Justice Rogers may not agree that courts should\nplay such a critical role in securing the people’s freedom\nfrom cruel and unusual punishment, but that is the law\nof the land. See Glossip v. Gross, supra, 135 S. Ct. 2776\n(Breyer, J., dissenting) (court, not legislature, ultimately\nmust determine whether capital punishment comports\nwith evolving standards of decency because ‘‘[these]\nare quintessentially judicial matters . . . [that] con-\ncern the infliction—indeed the unfair, cruel, and\nunusual infliction—of a serious punishment [on] an\nindividual’’).\n   Finally, it would be difficult to imagine a case in\nwhich the argument for legislative deference is weaker\nthan in the present case. The death penalty is a punish-\nment that Connecticut has imposed on fewer than two\ndozen occasions over the past one-half century, and it\nhas been carried out only once during that time frame.\nThe penalty has been abolished by most of our neigh-\nboring states, and, after years of repeal efforts, our\nlegislature and governor have now followed suit, abol-\nishing it for all future crimes. Capital punishment has\nbeen preserved, then, only on a provisional basis, and\nonly for a handful of current death row inmates. More-\nover, the legislative history suggests that many legisla-\ntors would have supported a full repeal and that those\nwho voted to retain the death penalty on a retroactive\nbasis may well have done so in the belief that this court\nwould not permit any further executions to be carried\nout, as this state’s chief prosecutor himself predicted.\nSee part II B of this opinion; see also footnotes 1, 59\nand 60 of this opinion and accompanying text. In short,\nthe legislature could not have come any closer to fully\nabolishing capital punishment without actually doing\nso. We perceive no ringing legislative endorsement of\nthe death penalty in Connecticut.\n                             V\n                     CONCLUSION\n   In prospectively abolishing the death penalty, the leg-\nislature did not simply express the will of the people\nthat it no longer makes sense to maintain the costly and\nunsatisfying charade of a capital punishment scheme in\nwhich no one ever receives the ultimate punishment.\nPublic Act 12-5 also held a mirror up to Connecticut’s\nlong, troubled history with capital punishment: the\nsteady replacement by more progressive forms of pun-\nishment; the increasing inability to achieve legitimate\npenological purposes; the freakishness with which the\nsentence of death is imposed; the rarity with which it is\ncarried out; and the racial, ethnic, and socio-economic\n\fbiases that likely are inherent in any discretionary death\npenalty system. Because such a system fails to comport\nwith our abiding freedom from cruel and unusual pun-\nishment, we hold that capital punishment, as currently\napplied, violates the constitution of Connecticut.\n   The judgment is reversed with respect to the imposi-\ntion of a sentence of death and the case is remanded\nwith direction to impose a sentence of life imprison-\nment without the possibility of release; the judgment\nis affirmed in all other respects.\n  In this opinion NORCOTT, EVELEIGH and McDON-\nALD, Js., concurred.\n    * This opinion supplements the opinion of this court in State v. Santiago,\n305 Conn. 101, 49 A.3d 566 (2012) (Santiago I), which was released on June\n12, 2012. The judgment rendered herein, however, supersedes the judgment\nin Santiago I.\n    ** The listing of justices reflects their seniority status on this court as of\nthe date of oral argument.\n    1\n      In March, 2009, when he testified before the Judiciary Committee as to\nthe constitutionality of a bifurcated, prospective only repeal, Kane stated\nthat ‘‘[t]he [s]tate could not and would not, could not constitutionally and\nwould not as a matter of public policy seek to execute somebody for a\ncrime they committed today when they could not be executed for committing\nthe same crime tomorrow. I don’t think that would stand up as a matter of\nconstitutional law. I don’t think the courts would permit that . . . .’’ Conn.\nJoint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 8, 2009 Sess., p. 2403.\n‘‘[I]f this [legislature] decides to abolish the death penalty for a crime that’s\ncommitted later on,’’ he continued, ‘‘I think the Connecticut Supreme Court\nwould decide . . . in effect that the community standard is such that this\nis now cruel and unusual punishment.’’ Id., p. 2412. For that reason, Kane\nadvised the legislature that the passage of a prospective only repeal ‘‘would\nactually nullify the death penalty for anybody who has not yet been exe-\ncuted.’’ Id., p. 2403. Kane’s substantially similar 2012 testimony regarding\nthe constitutional defects inherent in a prospective only repeal is discussed\nin part II B of this opinion.\n    2\n      Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 9, 2009 Sess.,\np. 2716.\n    3\n      Hereinafter, all references to § 53a-54b are to the 1999 revision, unless\notherwise noted.\n    4\n      The jury also found the defendant guilty of one count each of murder,\nfelony murder, conspiracy to commit murder, stealing a firearm, and larceny\nin the sixth degree, and two counts each of burglary in the first degree and\nconspiracy to commit burglary in the first degree. The murder and felony\nmurder counts were merged with the capital felony count for purposes\nof sentencing.\n    5\n      In addition to the sentence of death, the trial court also imposed a total\neffective term of imprisonment of forty-five years and ninety days on the\nremaining charges of which the defendant was convicted; see footnote 4 of\nthis opinion; to run consecutive to the death sentence.\n    6\n      Our determination that the defendant must be sentenced on the capital\nfelony count to life imprisonment without the possibility of release has no\nbearing on the sentence imposed by the trial court on the remaining charges.\nSee footnote 5 of this opinion.\n    7\n      In a footnote, the author of the majority opinion in Santiago I, Justice\nNorcott, expressed that he maintained his long-standing belief that the death\npenalty is a violation of the state constitution, and that he was able to author\nthe majority opinion only because there was a possibility that, on remand,\nthe defendant would not be sentenced to death. State v. Santiago, supra,\n305 Conn. 307 n.166.\n    8\n      Thereafter, we granted permission to a group of experts on international\nhuman rights and comparative law, a group of legal historians and scholars,\nand the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Connecticut to file\namicus briefs in support of the defendant’s position, and permission to the\nCriminal Justice Legal Foundation to file an amicus brief in support of the\nstate’s position. We also issued an order requesting supplemental briefs\nfrom the parties to address a then unpublished paper in which the author\n\fasserted that the death penalty may be imposed for crimes committed before\nApril 25, 2012, as provided in P.A. 12-5. See K. Barry, From Wolves, Lambs:\nThe Case for Gradual Abolition of the Death Penalty (preliminary working\ndraft), subsequently published at K. Barry, ‘‘From Wolves, Lambs (Part I):\nThe Eighth Amendment Case for Gradual Abolition of the Death Penalty,’’\n66 Fla. L. Rev. 313 (2014). The defendant filed a second supplemental brief\naddressing the paper, but the state declined to do so.\n   9\n     The defendant also claims that imposing the death penalty on a person,\nsuch as the defendant, who committed a capital felony before April 25, 2012,\nwould (1) be arbitrary, in violation of General Statutes § 53a-46b (b), (2)\nviolate the equal protection guarantees of the federal and state constitutions,\n(3) violate the substantive due process guarantees of the federal and state\nconstitutions, (4) violate the federal constitutional prohibition against bills\nof attainder, (5) violate the federal constitutional prohibition against ex post\nfacto laws, and (6) violate the provision of article first, § 9, of the constitution\nof Connecticut barring punishments ‘‘except in cases clearly warranted by\nlaw.’’ Because we conclude that the state constitutional prohibition against\ncruel and unusual punishment no longer permits the imposition of the death\npenalty, we need not address these claims. Certain of these claims are\naddressed, however, in Justice Eveleigh’s concurring opinion and Chief\nJustice Rogers’ dissenting opinion.\n   10\n      We address certain other, more specific objections of the dissenting\njustices throughout this opinion.\n   11\n      It has been argued that, when an appellant challenges a statute or\npractice under both the state and federal constitutions, this court should\nfirst consider the state claims, turning to the federal claim only after\ndetermining that the appellant’s state constitutional challenges will not suc-\nceed. See W. Horton, The Connecticut State Constitution (2d Ed. 2012) p.\n37. This approach is particularly apt when, as in the present case, the claim\nis one of first impression under both the federal and state constitutions.\nAccordingly, we will evaluate and resolve the defendant’s claim under the\nstate constitution. Because the legal framework that we apply with respect\nto allegedly cruel and unusual punishments is not fundamentally distinct\nfrom that adopted by the United States Supreme Court, we have no reason\nto believe that the eighth amendment would compel a different result. In\nany event, because the defendant prevails under the state constitution, we\nneed not speculate as to how that court might resolve his federal claims or\ndecide whether the state constitution provides broader protection than the\nfederal constitution in this regard.\n   12\n      The relevant portions of article first, §§ 8 and 9, of the Connecticut\nconstitution of 1965 are derived almost verbatim from article first, §§ 9, 10\nand 13, of the Connecticut constitution of 1818. See State v. Joyner, 225\nConn. 450, 486 and n.5, 625 A.2d 791 (1993) (Berdon, J., dissenting) (compar-\ning article first, §§ 8 and 9, of Connecticut constitution of 1965 with article\nfirst, §§ 9 and 10, of Connecticut constitution of 1818); see also Conn. Const.\n(1818), art. I, § 13.\n   Article first, § 8, of the Connecticut constitution of 1965, as amended by\narticle seventeen of the amendments, provides in relevant part: ‘‘No person\nshall be . . . deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of\nlaw, nor shall excessive bail be required nor excessive fines imposed. No\nperson shall be held to answer for any crime, punishable by death or life\nimprisonment, unless upon probable cause shown at a hearing in accordance\nwith procedures prescribed by law . . . .’’\n   Although article twenty-nine of the amendments amended article seven-\nteen of the amendments in 1996, article twenty-nine did not amend the\nforegoing language.\n   Article first, § 9, of the Connecticut constitution of 1965 provides: ‘‘No\nperson shall be arrested, detained or punished, except in cases clearly\nwarranted by law.’’\n   13\n      This ordering of the Geisler factors reflects the order in which we\nconsider them for purposes of the present case and does not necessarily\nreflect their relative importance generally.\n   14\n      In some of our decisions, we have utilized the multifactor Geisler analy-\nsis to flesh out the general nature and parameters of the state constitutional\nprovision at issue. Having done so, we proceeded to resolve the appellant’s\nparticular constitutional challenge according to the legal test and framework\nrelevant and suited to that area of the law, rather than performing the\nsubstantive legal analysis under the somewhat artificial auspices of the six\nGeisler factors. See, e.g., State v. Linares, 232 Conn. 345, 379–87, 655 A.2d\n737 (1995) (concluding, on basis of Geisler factors, that state constitution\naffords expansive protection to free speech in public places but then conclud-\ning that challenged statute did not infringe impermissibly on those protec-\n\ftions under facts presented). In other cases, by contrast, we have used the\nGeisler framework to perform the actual substantive legal analysis. See,\ne.g., State v. Rizzo, 303 Conn. 71, 135–45, 31 A.3d 1094 (2011) (Rizzo II)\n(evaluating challenges to death penalty according to six Geisler factors),\ncert. denied,        U.S.     , 133 S. Ct. 133, 184 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2012); see also\nState v. Ross, supra, 230 Conn. 249–51. In the present case, we follow\nthe former approach because, as we explain more fully hereinafter, the\nconstitutionality of a criminal sanction, like the constitutionality of a limita-\ntion on the free expression at issue in Linares, is governed by its own\ndistinct legal rules and standards. Accordingly, assuming that the Geisler\nframework is even applicable to the ultimate question of whether the death\npenalty now constitutes excessive and disproportionate punishment follow-\ning the enactment of P.A. 12-5; cf. Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public\nHealth, 289 Conn. 135, 227, 957 A.2d 407 (2008) (undertaking Geisler analysis\nfollowing conclusion that plaintiffs met state constitutional standard applica-\nble for determining quasi-suspect class status); our consideration of the\nrelevant Geisler factors is interwoven into our application of the legal frame-\nwork that properly governs such challenges. See parts II and III of this\nopinion.\n   15\n      The eighth amendment to the United States constitution provides:\n‘‘Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel\nand unusual punishments inflicted.’’\n   The cruel and unusual punishments clause of the eighth amendment is\nmade applicable to the states through the due process clause of the four-\nteenth amendment to the United States constitution. See Robinson v. Cali-\nfornia, 370 U.S. 660, 666–68, 82 S. Ct. 1417, 8 L. Ed. 2d 758 (1962).\n   16\n      In addition, some members of the United States Supreme Court have\nsuggested that a punishment may be so unusual that it runs afoul of the\neighth amendment on that basis alone. See, e.g., Furman v. Georgia, 408\nU.S. 238, 331, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 33 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1972) (Marshall, J., concurring);\nWeems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 390, 30 S. Ct. 544, 54 L. Ed. 793 (1910)\n(White, J., dissenting). For the most part, however, the court has treated\nthe term ‘‘unusual’’ as little more than constitutional surplussage. See, e.g.,\nFurman v. Georgia, supra, 276–77 n.20 (Brennan, J., concurring) (meaning\nof term is of minor significance); Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 100 n.32, 78\nS. Ct. 590, 2 L. Ed. 2d 630 (1958) (plurality opinion) (‘‘[o]n the few occasions\n[the] [c]ourt has had to consider the meaning of the phrase [‘unusual’],\nprecise distinctions between cruelty and unusualness do not seem to have\nbeen drawn’’).\n   17\n      It is well established, however, that ‘‘[t]he adoption of federal constitu-\ntional precedents that appropriately illuminate open textured provisions in\nour own organic document in no way compromises our obligation indepen-\ndently to construe the provisions of our state constitution.’’ State v. Lamme,\nsupra, 216 Conn. 184. Accordingly, we are not necessarily bound, for state\nconstitutional purposes, to reach the same conclusions as the United States\nSupreme Court has with regard to any particular punishment or legal\nchallenge.\n   As we previously indicated; see footnote 11 of this opinion; because the\npresent appeal presents an issue that, to our knowledge, is a question of\nfirst impression not only in Connecticut but also for the federal courts, we\nneed not determine, in resolving the defendant’s state constitutional claims,\nwhether the state constitution affords broader protections against cruel\nand unusual punishment than does the eighth amendment. Even if those\nprotections are merely coextensive, however, we note that, in another case,\nthis court nevertheless might conclude that practices and punishments that\nthe United States Supreme Court has expressly approved are nevertheless\nunconstitutionally cruel and unusual in Connecticut. This might be true\neither because our state’s contemporary standards of decency differ from\nthose of the nation as a whole, or because this court simply reaches a\ndifferent conclusion when applying to the relevant constitutional facts, as\na matter of state constitutional law, standards similar or even identical to\nthose that the United States Supreme Court has articulated.\n   18\n      Some justices of the United States Supreme Court have suggested that\nthese considerations—whether a punishment is excessive or disproportion-\nate, whether it comports with contemporary standards of decency and dig-\nnity, and whether it satisfies any legitimate penological goals—represent\nthree distinct elements or prongs of the eighth amendment analysis. See,\ne.g., Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 330–32, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 33 L. Ed.\n2d 346 (1972) (Marshall, J., concurring). Whether these considerations are\ntreated as distinct elements or merely as distinct components of a common\n\felement, however, is merely semantic and ultimately immaterial, because\nit is clear that a sentence’s failure to satisfy any of these requirements would\nrender it unconstitutional under the eighth amendment.\n    19\n       In Davis v. Connecticut, 408 U.S. 935, 92 S. Ct. 2856, 33 L. Ed. 2d 750\n(1972), and Delgado v. Connecticut, 408 U.S. 940, 92 S. Ct. 2879, 33 L. Ed.\n2d 764 (1972), both memorandum decisions, the United States Supreme\nCourt struck down a prior incarnation of Connecticut’s capital punishment\nscheme as facially unconstitutional because it failed to comply with these\nrequirements.\n    20\n       See footnote 44 of this opinion (noting cases in which this court has\npermitted citation to extra-record reference materials, including state histor-\nies, as evidence of contemporary societal norms or to advocate for new\ninterpretation of state constitution).\n    21\n       With respect to the Connecticut constitution of 1965, see footnote 31\nof this opinion.\n    We acknowledge that both the 1818 and 1965 Connecticut constitutions\nmake express reference to capital punishment and that such punishment\nno doubt was considered constitutional at the time of their adoption. In\npart IV B of this opinion, we explain why that historical acceptance does\nnot alter our conclusion that capital punishment no longer comports with\ncontemporary standards of decency or serves a legitimate penological pur-\npose in Connecticut.\n    22\n       This provision was retained in the 1702 laws; see Acts and Laws, of His\nMajesties Colony of Connecticut in New-England (1702) p. 98; but was left\nout of the 1784 laws in keeping with the general sentiment of that time that\nsuch protections were not properly the subject of written legal codes.\n    23\n       In addition to recognizing the freedom from cruel, inhuman, and barba-\nrous punishments, the 1672 code also guaranteed those accused of capital\noffenses the right to a trial by jury and provided for a special jury of life\nand death. See W. Holdsworth, supra, p. 581.\n    24\n       In her dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Rogers chides our use of terms\nsuch as ‘‘progress’’ and ‘‘progressive,’’ implying that we improperly have\nexceeded our constitutional mandate and embraced a progressive socio-\npolitical viewpoint. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Footnote 12 of Chief\nJustice Rogers’ dissenting opinion. Nothing could be further from the truth.\nThe United States Supreme Court has instructed, on literally dozens of\noccasions, that, in construing the eighth amendment, courts must look to\n‘‘the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing\nsociety.’’ (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Hall v. Flor-\nida, supra, 134 S. Ct. 1992; accord Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101, 78 S.\nCt. 590, 2 L. Ed. 2d 630 (1958) (plurality opinion); see also Weems v. United\nStates, 217 U.S. 349, 378, 30 S. Ct. 544, 54 L. Ed. 793 (1910) (‘‘[the eighth\namendment] in the opinion of the learned commentators may be therefore\nprogressive, and is not fastened to the obsolete, but may acquire meaning\nas public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice’’ [emphasis\nadded]). Indeed, Chief Justice Rogers acknowledges shortly thereafter in\nher dissenting opinion that this is the governing federal standard. See text\naccompanying footnote 15 of Chief Justice Rogers’ dissenting opinion. Fur-\nthermore, in more than twenty of our cases, including four capital appeals,\nthis court has recognized that ‘‘our state constitution is an instrument of\nprogress . . . .’’ (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) State\nv. Rizzo, supra, 266 Conn. 207; accord State v. Webb, 238 Conn. 389, 411,\n680 A.2d 147 (1996); State v. Ross, supra, 230 Conn. 248; State v. Dukes, 209\nConn. 98, 115, 547 A.2d 10 (1988). Both state and federal constitutional\njurisprudence, then, has been marked by the use of such language. In the\npresent case, we likewise use the term ‘‘progressive’’ in its established\nconstitutional, rather than political, sense. We do agree with Chief Justice\nRogers, however, that, although the arc of our history in this regard is both\nclear and profound, there is no constitutional mandate that our state’s\ncriminal law become increasingly compassionate.\n    25\n       For nearly one century after the adoption of the English Declaration of\nRights of 1689, for instance, ‘‘the law of Great Britain condemned a prisoner\nwho refused to plead to be slowly pressed to death by weights placed [on]\nhis chest.’’ Judicial and Civil History of Connecticut (D. Loomis & J. Calhoun\neds., 1895) p. 63; see also W. Holdsworth, supra, p. 356 (mutilating punish-\nments were imposed far less frequently in seventeenth century Massachu-\nsetts and, especially, in Connecticut, than in England); W. Holdsworth,\nsupra, p. 361 (England permitted more extensive and more brutal corporal\npunishment than Connecticut in mid-seventeenth century); W. Holdsworth,\nsupra, pp. 431–32, 568 (capital punishment was considerably rarer in New\nEngland than in England, where theft of as little as one shilling constituted\ncapital crime); W. Holdsworth, supra, p. 569 (‘‘[t]he courts and legislatures\nof Connecticut and New Haven succeeded in creating a more equitable and\n\fless brutal system of criminal justice than that of England’’).\n   26\n      For example, a second wave of immigration brought new residents to\nConnecticut during this period, significantly expanding the colonial popula-\ntion. These immigrants did not share the founding generation’s vision of\nConnecticut as a ‘‘new Israel under a new covenant,’’ committed to observing\nand strictly enforcing the judicial laws of Moses. W. Holdsworth, supra, p.\n124; see id., pp. 532–34, 579–81. Whereas their predecessors were preoccu-\npied with the moral aspects of sinfulness, the new citizens were more\nconcerned with addressing the practical consequences of crime. See id., p.\n518. This ‘‘erosion of moral outrage’’ left the public less convinced of the\nneed for strict punishment in many cases and resulted in more lenient public\nsentiment toward a number of crimes. Id., p. 518; see id., p. 576.\n   27\n      In 1666, for example, a special court of assistants at Governor Winthrop’s\nurging overruled Hannah Hackleton’s death sentence for blasphemy. See\nW. Holdsworth, supra, p. 381. The same year, in the case of Elizabeth Seager,\nGovernor Winthrop himself directly overturned a capital sentence, this time\nfor witchcraft, and ordered the defendant freed. See id., pp. 519–20. Seager\nis believed to have been the first convicted witch to have escaped the gallows\nin Connecticut. See id., p. 520. Four years later, a specially appointed court\nreleased another woman who had been sentenced to die for witchcraft. See\nid., pp. 520–21. Katherine Harrison’s case is noteworthy as the first instance\nin which a Connecticut court reversed a jury conviction in a capital case.\nSee id., p. 521.\n   28\n      That such punishments had come to be seen as cruel in Connecticut is\napparent from the case of Polly Rogers, a Native American who petitioned\nthe legislature for redress in 1815 after having been convicted of adultery\nand sentenced to whipping and branding. L. Goodheart, supra, p. 78. ‘‘In\nkeeping with the sensibility of the age,’’ Professor Lawrence B. Goodheart\nrecounts, ‘‘she protested the ‘cruel punishment of being branded with a hot\niron.’ ’’ Id. The legislature granted her request and spared her. Id.\n   Moreover, although Newgate hardly would have met modern standards\nfor the treatment of inmates, records from Connecticut’s preconstitutional\nperiod clearly indicate that the legislature was concerned that prisoners\nnot be treated cruelly. In 1809, the legislature appointed a committee that\nconsidered, and ultimately enacted, the governor’s recommendation that\nthe prisoners in Newgate would benefit from religious instruction. See 1\nCrimes and Misdemeanors, 2d Series (1809) pp. 95a–96a. The following year,\na second committee was appointed to evaluate the condition of the prison’s\ninmates. See 1 Crimes and Misdemeanors, 2d Series (1810) p. 97a. On the\nbasis of the resulting report, the legislature directed Newgate’s overseers\nto provide the prisoners with a more diverse diet and to ensure that suitable\nbathing places were provided. See id., pp. 99d–99e, 99z, 100a. At the same\ntime, the legislature resolved to prohibit ‘‘unnecessary and cruel punish-\nments’’ within the facility. Id., p. 100a. In 1815, just three years before the\nadoption of the state constitution, a legislative committee went even further,\ncondemning the practice of whipping at Newgate as ‘‘incompatible with\n. . . decency and humanity,’’ and beginning to plan for the construction of\na new state prison. 1 Crimes and Misdemeanors, 2d Series (1815) pp. 153a,\n154c; see also 2 Z. Swift, A Digest of the Laws of the State of Connecticut\n(1823) pp. 268–69 (‘‘and though the law invests [jailers] with all the powers\nnecessary for the interest of the commonwealth, yet they are not to behave\nwith the least degree of wanton cruelty to their prisoners’’).\n   29\n      The fact that Swift later repudiated some of his more progressive peno-\nlogical views is of little moment. Swift did not begin to author his Digest\nof the Laws of the State of Connecticut until after he stepped down as\nChief Justice in 1819; P. O’Sullivan, ‘‘Biographies of Connecticut Judges I:\nZephaniah Swift,’’ 19 Conn. B.J. 181, 190–91 (1945); and it was in that work\nthat he embraced a more severe philosophy of punishment. Indeed, in State\nv. Ellis, 197 Conn. 436, 497 A.2d 974 (1985), we recognized that it was Swift\nhimself who, having inveighed against the barbaric and medieval forms of\npunishment of the past; id., 450 n.13; impressed on the legislature in the\nearly 1820s to adopt ‘‘more rational and consistent laws’’ that would ‘‘propor-\ntion the punishment according to the nature and grade of the crime . . . .’’\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 451 n.13.\n   30\n      Justice Zarella is simply incorrect, then, when, in his dissenting opinion,\nhe contends that ‘‘[w]hat is striking thing about this case . . . is the lack\nof any suggestion by the legislature . . . that the imposition of the death\npenalty was wrong.’’\n   31\n      Although we look primarily to our state’s preconstitutional traditions\nand the history and intent of the drafters of the 1818 constitution to parse\n\fthe meanings of article first, §§ 8 and 9; see State v. Joyner, 225 Conn.\n450, 486–87, 625 A.2d 791 (1993) (Berdon, J., dissenting); it also may be\nappropriate to consider how the 1818 provisions were interpreted in 1965,\nwhen they were incorporated into the state’s present constitution. See W.\nHorton, The Connecticut State Constitution (2d Ed. 2012) pp. 33–34. By that\ntime, attitudes toward the purpose and permissible scope of punishment in\nConnecticut had, of course, evolved even further, in ways that are too\nnumerous to count. Perhaps the clearest example of this evolution may be\nseen in the state prison in Somers, which replaced the Wethersfield facility\nshortly before the new constitution was adopted. See G. Demeusy, ‘‘State\nDedicates New Prison with Note of Hope for Future,’’ Hartford Courant,\nFebruary 16, 1964, p. 15B; G. Demeusy & J. Tucker, ‘‘400 Convicts Are Moved\nto New Somers Prison,’’ Hartford Courant, November 6, 1963, p. 1. At a\ndedication ceremony in 1964, the new facility was described as ‘‘a symbol\nof progress, a gateway to penal reform . . . .’’ (Internal quotation marks\nomitted.) ‘‘Penal Outlook Hailed at State Prison Ceremony,’’ Hartford\nCourant, February 15, 1964, p. 4. Speaking at the dedication, Warden Freder-\nick G. Reincke hailed the Somers prison as ‘‘the beginning of a new era\n. . . primarily devoted to preparing inmates for adjusting to community\nliving and responsibility when they are released.’’ (Internal quotation marks\nomitted.) Id. According to Reincke, ‘‘[t]he days of revenge imprisonment in\nConnecticut [were] over.’’ Id.\n   The chairman of the prison’s board of directors, Charles Stroh, concurred,\nexplaining that ‘‘we . . . have launched a rehabilitation [facility] that cen-\nters not around retribution and punishment, but the individual training and\ntreatment of inmates.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) G. Demeusy,\nsupra, p. 15B. This new penal philosophy, he explained, reflected an emerging\npublic ‘‘realization that there’s something more to penology than simply\nlocking up the lawbreakers.’’ Id. Stroh further explained: ‘‘There is punish-\nment—but it’s punishment for a purpose and it is accepted by the inmates\nas a part of their rehabilitation . . . .’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\nId. For his part, Governor John Dempsey opined that the new state prison\nwas ‘‘wholly in keeping with modern penology, [and] maintain[ed] Connecti-\ncut’s reputation as a state that is forward-looking and progressive in all\nfields of human endeavor.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. To the\nextent that conceptions of cruel and unusual punishment prevalent at the\ndrafting of the 1965 state constitution are relevant to the Geisler analysis,\nthen, there is no doubt that our state’s understanding of the permissible\nnature and purposes of punishment had undergone a thorough transfor-\nmation.\n   32\n      Connecticut ultimately approved the federal Bill of Rights in 1939, 150\nyears after its submission to the states for ratification in 1789. P. Maier,\nRatification: The People Debate the Constitution, 1787–1788 (2010) p. 459.\n   33\n      The opinions of the dissenting justices reveal the prescience of these\nfears.\n   34\n      In State v. Rizzo, 303 Conn. 71, 142, 31 A.3d 1094 (2011) (Rizzo II),\ncert. denied,      U.S.    , 133 S. Ct. 133, 184 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2012), we therefore\nidentified Rizzo I as a case, albeit a rare one, in which we had treated the\nstate constitution as providing greater protection to capital defendants than\nthe federal constitution in concluding that the jury must find beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the aggravating factors outweigh mitigating factors\nin order for the death penalty to be imposed. Several members of this court,\nin dissent, also have determined that the state constitution affords broader\nprotection from cruel and unusual punishment. See, e.g., State v. Santiago,\nsupra, 305 Conn. 309 (Harper, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part);\nState v. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 202–203 (Norcott, J., dissenting); State v.\nPeeler, 271 Conn. 338, 464, 857 A.2d 808 (2004) (Katz, J., dissenting), cert.\ndenied, 546 U.S. 845, 126 S. Ct. 94, 163 L. Ed. 2d 110 (2005); State v. Webb,\n238 Conn. 389, 551, 680 A.2d 147 (1996) (Berdon, J., dissenting). As we have\nexplained, however, the present case does not require that we determine\nwhether the state constitution affords greater protection than the federal\nconstitution with respect to cruel and unusual punishment.\n   35\n      In his dissenting opinion, Justice Zarella refuses to acknowledge that,\nin Rizzo II, we adopted and applied the federal courts’ eighth amendment\nframework for evaluating challenges to the death penalty and other allegedly\ncruel and unusual punishments. He does so despite language in that decision\nthat clearly indicates our adherence to the federal framework. See, e.g.,\nState v. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 191 (‘‘[a]lthough the clearest and most\nreliable objective evidence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted\nby the country’s legislatures . . . Atkins v. Virginia, supra, 536 U.S. 312;\n\fin assessing whether a punishment is constitutionally sound, it also is appro-\npriate for us to consider what is occurring in actual practice’’ [internal\nquotation marks omitted]).\n   36\n      In Watson, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts struck down\nthat state’s death penalty as impermissibly cruel under the state constitution.\nDistrict Attorney v. Watson, supra, 381 Mass. 650. In the November, 1982\nelection, Massachusetts voters approved a referendum amending the state\nconstitution to permit the state legislature to reinstate capital punishment.\nSee Commonwealth v. Colon-Cruz, 393 Mass. 150, 152, 470 N.E.2d 116\n(1984). No such statute is currently in place.\n   37\n      In Anderson, the California Supreme Court struck down that state’s\ndeath penalty as both cruel and unusual. See People v. Anderson, supra, 6\nCal. 3d 651, 656–57. In the November, 1972 election, California voters passed\na ballot initiative amending the California constitution and reinstating capital\npunishment. See People v. Frierson, 25 Cal. 3d 142, 173, 599 P.2d 587, 158\nCal. Rptr. 281 (1979).\n   38\n      We emphasize that we are not, as Justice Zarella suggests, in any way\nconflating the sociological considerations encompassed by the sixth Geisler\nfactor with the standards by which federal courts have evaluated claims\nthat a particular punishment is excessive or disproportionate, namely, that\nthe punishment offends contemporary standards of decency or fails to\naccomplish legitimate penological purposes. Those standards are, rather,\nthe substantive test according to which both this court and the federal\ncourts evaluate such claims. The Geisler ‘‘test,’’ by contrast, is merely a\nscheme by which we organize and review, for purposes of state constitutional\nchallenges, the various types of considerations that may bear on any question\nof first impression.\n   39\n      Although Chief Justice Rogers, in her dissenting opinion, suggests that,\nbecause the federal constitution makes express reference to capital offenses,\nit is an open question as to whether the federal courts ever would find\nthe death penalty unconstitutional per se under the evolving standards of\ndecency rubric, we disagree. In Gregg v. Georgia, supra, 428 U.S. 153, the\nUnited States Supreme Court made clear that even claims that capital punish-\nment is categorically unconstitutional are to be evaluated according to that\nrubric, and that the constitutional text is not dispositive. See id., 176–87\n(opinion announcing judgment).\n   40\n      The majority specifically stated: ‘‘The first five factors do not support\nthe . . . argument [of the defendant, Michael B. Ross]. In article first, § 8,\nand article first, § 19, our state constitution makes repeated textual refer-\nences to capital offenses and thus expressly sustains the constitutional\nvalidity of such a penalty in appropriate circumstances. Connecticut case\nlaw has recognized the facial constitutionality of the death penalty under\nthe eighth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution. . . .\nFederal constitutional law does not forbid such a statute outright. . . .\nCourts in the overwhelming majority of our sister states have rejected facial\nchallenges to the death penalty under their state constitutions. Finally,\nConnecticut’s history has included a death penalty statute since 1650, when\nit was incorporated into Ludlow’s Code . . . and such a penalty was consid-\nered constitutional at the time of the adoption of the constitution of 1818.’’\n(Citations omitted; footnotes omitted.) State v. Ross, supra, 230 Conn.\n249–50.\n   41\n      We note that the dissenting justices, while criticizing our departure from\nthe court’s discussion of capital punishment in Ross, make no attempt to\ndefend the adequacy of the analysis therein.\n   42\n      In Webb, this court did consider and reject an alternative argument: that\ncapital punishment violates the social compact clause of article first, § 1,\nof the state constitution. State v. Webb, supra, 238 Conn. 406–12.\n   43\n      We do not disagree with Chief Justice Rogers that the last two factors—\nthe laws and practices of other jurisdictions, and the opinions and recom-\nmendations of professional associations-—are of less importance, and we\nagree that those considerations alone would constitute an insufficient basis\nfor deeming a punishment cruel and unusual in the absence of any evidence\nthat it has come to be so in Connecticut. We do, however, disagree with\nChief Justice Rogers’ suggestion in her dissenting opinion that the defendant\nhas asked that we consider the constitutional implications of the adoption\nof P.A. 12-5 in a complete factual and jurisprudential vacuum, ignoring any\nand all other evidence that capital punishment no longer comports with\ncontemporary standards of decency in Connecticut, even insofar as that\nevidence pertains to the defendant’s claim that the death penalty is now\nunconstitutional in light of P.A. 12-5. In fact, in his brief to this court, the\n\fdefendant expressly asked us to consider previous decisions of this court\nthat explored all of these factors in substantial depth.\n    44\n       We previously have permitted citation to extra-record reference materi-\nals as evidence of contemporary societal norms or to advocate for a new\ninterpretation of the state constitution. See, e.g., State v. Rizzo, supra, 303\nConn. 184 n.81; see also Hall v. Florida, supra, 134 S. Ct. 1993–96 (relying\non medical and psychological research in concluding that eighth amendment\ndoes not permit states to adopt rigid rule that individuals with intelligence\nquotient [IQ] test scores higher than 70 are precluded from offering other\nevidence of mental disability). Notice also may be taken in this context of\ntreatises reporting the public history of Connecticut. See 1 B. Holden & J.\nDaly, Connecticut Evidence (1988) § 31, pp. 128–29. More generally, it is\nwell established that an appellate court may take notice of ‘‘legislative facts,’’\nincluding historical sources and scientific studies, ‘‘which help determine\nthe content of law and policy,’’ as distinguished from the ‘‘adjudicative\nfacts,’’ which concern ‘‘the parties and events of a particular case.’’ (Internal\nquotation marks omitted.)

See L.\nGoodheart, supra, p. 20. This presumption of infanticide could be rebutted\nif a witness to the birth testified that the baby was stillborn. See id.\n    47\n       There is no precedent for Chief Justice Rogers’ contention that legislative\nenactments are relevant indicia of evolving standards of decency only to\nthe extent that they accurately reflect popular opinion. See footnote 33 of\nChief Justice Rogers’ dissenting opinion. On the contrary, the United States\nSupreme Court repeatedly has instructed that, for purposes of the eighth\namendment, social mores are to be measured by the legislation enacted by\nthe elected branches of government, and not according to the shifting winds\nof public sentiment. See, e.g., Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 335, 109 S.\nCt. 2934, 106 L. Ed. 2d 256 (1989) (conflicting public sentiment, as expressed\nin polls and resolutions, does not evidence contemporary values until\nexpressed in legislative action), overruled on other grounds by Atkins v.\nVirginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335 (2002); cf. Furman\nv. Georgia, supra, 408 U.S. 362 (Marshall, J., concurring).\n    48\n       Although Justice Marshall appears to have coined the phrase ‘‘machinery\nof death’’ in Rumbaugh v. McCotter, 473 U.S. 919, 921, 105 S. Ct. 3544, 87\nL. Ed. 2d 668 (1985) (Marshall, J., dissenting from the denial of certiorari),\nit is widely attributed to Justice Blackmun’s famous declaration, shortly\nbefore his retirement from the United States Supreme Court in 1994, that,\n‘‘[f]rom this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of\ndeath. For more than [twenty] years I have endeavored—indeed, I have\nstruggled—along with a majority of [the] [c]ourt, to develop procedural and\nsubstantive rules that would lend more than the mere appearance of fairness\nto the death penalty endeavor. Rather than continue to coddle the [c]ourt’s\ndelusion that the desired level of fairness has been achieved and the need\nfor regulation eviscerated, I feel morally and intellectually obligated simply\nto concede that the death penalty experiment has failed. It is virtually self-\nevident to me now that no combination of procedural rules or substantive\nregulations ever can save the death penalty from its inherent constitutional\ndeficiencies. The basic question—does the system accurately and consis-\ntently determine which defendants deserve to die?—cannot be answered\nin the affirmative.’’ (Footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\nCallins v.

(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Footnote 26 of\nChief Justice Rogers’ dissenting opinion. If there was any ambiguity in\nSenator Kissel’s statement, it surely was resolved by his statement, during a\nJudiciary Committee hearing on the proposed repeal legislation, that ‘‘[e]very\nexpert that I have asked . . . has stated that the evolving societal standards\nevinced by a change in the law form . . . very solid grounds under the\n\fcruel and unusual punishment portion of the constitution to support repeal\nof [the] death [penalty] for folks sitting on death row when a prospective\nbill is passed.’’ Conn.

Importantly, although some opponents of P.A. 12-5 chided supporters\nfor what the opponents characterized as the inconsistency of prospectively\nrepealing capital punishment while retaining it for those already on death\nrow, they consistently characterized this dichotomy as a moral inconsistency\nrather than a merely pragmatic decision. See, e.g., 55 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 2012\nSess., pp. 747–48, remarks of Senator Suzio.\n   55\n      Ignoring Senator Kissel’s explanation that members of the legislature\nhave indicated over the course of many years their moral opposition to the\ndeath penalty, Chief Justice Rogers queries ‘‘how Kissel could have known\nthat.’’ Footnote 26 of Chief Justice Rogers’ dissenting opinion. The relevant\nquestion, rather, is on what basis Chief Justice Rogers would purport to\nknow better than a twelve term senator and ranking member of the Judiciary\nCommittee what lies in the hearts and minds of his colleagues.\n   56\n      See 55 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 2012 Sess., pp. 583–84, remarks of Senator Carlo\nLeone; 55 H.R. Proc., Pt. 4, 2012 Sess., pp. 1373–74, remarks of Representative\nJuan R. Candelaria.\n   Chief Justice Rogers also takes out of context public testimony by Profes-\nsor Kevin Barry, which she offers as evidence that support for P.A. 12-5\nwas driven primarily by financial considerations. See footnote 19 of Chief\nJustice Rogers’ dissenting opinion; see also Conn. Joint Standing Committee\nHearings, Judiciary, Pt. 9, 2012 Sess., pp. 2765–66. In fact, in the quoted\ntestimony, Barry is speaking about the decision of the New Mexico legislature\nto repeal that state’s death penalty on a prospective only basis. Id., p.\n2765. Specifically, Barry refers to evidence that New Mexico’s repeal was\nmotivated in large part by that state’s pending budget crisis. Id. Although\nBarry does propose that the state might try to make a similar argument in\nConnecticut, he provides no support for the proposition that cost considera-\ntions were of comparable importance for the legislators who supported P.A.\n12-5. Indeed, his statements amount to little more than a recommended\nlitigation strategy for those who would seek to preserve the death pen-\nalty retroactively.\n   57\n      See, e.g., 55 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 2012 Sess., pp. 781–82, remarks of Senator\nEdith Prague (opposing capital punishment out of moral concern that inno-\ncent not be wrongly executed, but favoring retroactivity out of respect for\nsurvivors of victims of capital felonies committed before 2012); id., p. 662,\nremarks of Senator Andrew W. Roraback (‘‘I have long believed that the\n[s]tate shouldn’t be in the business of taking life. And as strongly as I believe\nthat, I believe even more strongly that the [s]tate shouldn’t be in the business\nof breaking its commitment to victims of crime.’’).\n   58\n      We do not share Chief Justice Rogers’ conviction that those legislators\nwho believed capital punishment to be indecent or unjustified, and yet who\nheld out for a prospective only repeal in order to honor the state’s prior\ncommitments to the families of murder victims, are somehow illogical or\n‘‘morally incoherent . . . .’’ Footnote 22 of Chief Justice Rogers’ dissenting\nopinion. There are, no doubt, opponents of the death penalty whose princi-\npled opposition is so staunch and so unyielding that they would not counte-\nnance its use under any circumstances. We are equally certain, however,\nthat there are people of good faith and clear mind who, although they have\ncome to believe that, on balance, state sanctioned killing is impermissibly\nexcessive, or arbitrary, or subject to error, are not so stridently opposed\nthat their opposition cannot yield to countervailing moral commitments.\nEach day, legislators, no less than judges, must balance conflicting moral\n\fprinciples and commitments: between free expression and national security;\nbetween environmental conservation and the fruits of economic develop-\nment; between a right to life and a freedom of choice. Why Chief Justice\nRogers believes that opposition to the death penalty, alone among principled\nbeliefs, must be uncompromising simply eludes us. See generally K. Barry,\n‘‘From Wolves, Lambs (Part I): The Eighth Amendment Case for Gradual\nAbolition of the Death Penalty,’’ 66 Fla. L. Rev. 313 (2014) (articulating\nprincipled defense of prospective only repeal of capital punishment on\nmoral grounds).\n   59\n      See, e.g., 55 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 2012 Sess., p. 743, remarks of Senator Kissel;\nid., pp. 748–49, remarks of Senator Len Suzio; id., pp. 795–96, remarks of\nSenator Leonard A. Fasano; 55 H.R.

O’Neill (‘‘there seems to be pretty much a consen-\nsus by both the prosecutor and the defense people here in Connecticut most\nfamiliar with death penalty issues that that’s going to be a very difficult hill\nfor the prosecutors to climb in terms of defending the existing sentences\nand that we should expect that if we repeal with so-called prospective only\nlanguage, that as a practical matter, no one will have the death penalty\nimposed [on] them in the state of Connecticut’’); Conn. Joint Standing Com-\nmittee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 8, 2012 Sess., pp. 2549–50, remarks of Senator\nKissel (‘‘[e]very expert that I have asked . . . has stated that the evolving\nsocietal standards evinced by a change in the law form . . . very solid\ngrounds under the cruel and unusual punishment portion of the constitution\nto support repeal of [the] death [penalty] for folks sitting on death row\nwhen a prospective bill is passed’’).\n   61\n      Kane’s statements on the question are no less unambiguous than those\nof Senator Kissel; see text accompanying footnote 49 of this opinion; see\nalso footnote 1 of this opinion; and Chief Justice Rogers’ insistence that\nKane expressed no opinion on the matter is equally puzzling. See footnote\n28 of Chief Justice Rogers’ dissenting opinion.\n   62\n      It bears noting that senators rejected an amendment crafted to ensure\nthat capital punishment would be retained for those already on death row\nin the event that a court declared P.A. 12-5 unconstitutional. The proposed\namendment provided that, if a court were to conclude that a bifurcated,\nprospective only repeal of the death penalty was unconstitutional, the repeal\nwould be nullified, and the state’s capital felony statutes would revert to\ntheir pre-2012 status. See 55 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 2012 Sess., pp. 652–53, 662–64,\nremarks of Senator Roraback; see also id., p. 669 (vote on amendment).\n   We are perplexed by Chief Justice Rogers’ suggestion that it is improper\nfor us to conclude that some legislators, in supporting a prospective only\nappeal, may have acted in part out of political motivations. That conclusion,\nChief Justice Rogers contends, violates what she refers to as the ‘‘constitu-\ntional principle that this court must presume that the legislature has acted\nfor legitimate reasons . . . .’’ Text accompanying footnote 23 of Chief Jus-\ntice Rogers’ dissenting opinion. We have no quarrel with this principle\ngenerally, but Chief Justice Rogers’ reliance on it in the present case is\nmisplaced. First, there is nothing improper about a legislator acting on the\nbasis of political considerations. Moreover, Chief Justice Rogers’ argument\nimproperly conflates equal protection and eighth amendment principles. As\nshe asserts; see text accompanying footnote 93 of Chief Justice Rogers’\ndissenting opinion; when a statutory classification is challenged on equal\nprotection grounds, but the classification does not involve a fundamental\nright or suspect class, such as race or national origin, it will be evaluated\nunder the highly deferential ‘‘rational basis’’ standard of review. (Internal\nquotation marks omitted.) Contractor’s Supply of Waterbury, LLC v. Com-\nmissioner of Environmental Protection, 283 Conn. 86, 93, 925 A.2d 1071\n(2007). Under rational basis review, a statutory classification will be upheld,\nas long as it is supported by some plausible legitimate rationale, regardless\nof whether the legislature actually had that rationale in mind when enacting\n\fthe legislation. See id. This unremarkable legal principle is, however, wholly\nirrelevant to the question before us. Under the eighth amendment and the\ncorresponding provisions of the state constitution, the issue is not whether\nthere is any legitimate justification for a statutory classification but, rather,\nwhat a penal statute actually indicates about contemporary social mores.\nIt is no more improper for a court to consider the legislative calculations\ninvolved in the crafting of such a statute than in any other situation in which\nwe look to legislative history to help discern the meaning of a statute. See,\ne.g., Local No. 82, Furniture & Piano Moving, Furniture Store Drivers,\nHelpers, Warehousemen & Packers v. Crowley, 467 U.S. 526, 542 n.17, 104\nS. Ct. 2557, 81 L. Ed. 2d 457 (1984) (‘‘[t]he legislation contains more than\nits share of problems for judicial interpretation because . . . many sections\ncontain calculated ambiguities or political compromises essential to secure\na majority’’ [internal quotation marks omitted]); Kerrigan v. Commissioner\nof Public Health, supra, 289 Conn. 205 n.45 (concluding ‘‘that the disclaimer\nset forth in [General Statutes] § 46a-81r [1] was a political compromise\ndesigned to assure persons opposed to homosexual conduct of this state’s\nunwillingness to approve or condone such conduct’’); see also Griswold\nInn, Inc. v. State, 183 Conn. 552, 561–62, 441 A.2d 16 (1981) (court is not\nbound to accept most constitutionally favorable interpretation of state\naction).\n   63\n      Among the many steps that the legislature could have taken in this\nregard include habeas corpus reform, the allocation of additional resources\nfor the purpose of expediting the lengthy appeals process for this state’s\ncapital cases, simplification of our death penalty statutes, and streamlining\nthe procedures applicable to capital cases.\n   64\n      See, e.g., Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 8,\n2012 Sess., pp. 2594–95, remarks of Chief State’s Attorney Kane; Conn. Joint\nStanding Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 9, 2012 Sess., pp. 2741–42,\nremarks of Robert Fromer.\n   65\n      Once again, Chief Justice Rogers begs the question in assuming that\nGovernor Malloy’s opposition to a retroactive repeal precluded him from\nsupporting P.A. 12-5 out of a sincere belief that the death penalty is a\npunishment unbecoming a modern, enlightened state. In fact, Governor\nMalloy’s signing statement, in which he makes it abundantly clear that\nhis opposition to capital punishment is principled rather than pragmatic,\nnotwithstanding his stated preference for a prospective only repeal, offers\nperhaps the clearest and most powerful refutation of Chief Justice Rogers’\ninterpretation of P.A. 12-5. Nor would we join Chief Justice Rogers in labeling\nthe governor’s stated beliefs logically and morally ‘‘incoherent.’’ Footnote\n22 of Chief Justice Rogers’ dissenting opinion. What is illogical, rather,\nis the assumption that one cannot believe that something is indecent or\nunacceptable unless one is prepared to reject it categorically, under every\npossible circumstance.\n   66\n      Death Penalty Information Center, ‘‘Death Sentences in the United States\nfrom 1977 by State and by Year,’’ available at http://www.deathpenalty\ninfo.org/death-sentences-united-states-1977-2008 (last visited July 27, 2015).\n   67\n      See Amnesty International, ‘‘Death Penalty Trends,’’ available at http://\nwww.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/death-penalty/us-death-penalty-\nfacts/death-penalty-trend (last visited July 27, 2015).\n   68\n      Death Penalty Information Center, ‘‘States with and without the Death\nPenalty,’’ available at http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/states-and-without-\ndeath-penalty (last visited July 27, 2015); see also Death Penalty Information\nCenter, ‘‘Crimes Punishable by the Death Penalty,’’ available at http://\nwww.deathpenaltyinfo.org/crimes-punishable-death-penalty#BJS (last vis-\nited July 27, 2015).

See C. Steiker & J. Steiker, supra, pp. 28–29\n(referencing ‘‘broad scholarly literature . . . point[ing] to the fact that exe-\ncutions are overwhelmingly confined to the South [and states bordering the\nSouth], the very same jurisdictions that were last to abandon slavery and\nsegregation, and that were most resistant to the federal enforcement of civil\nrights norms’’).\n   87\n      In Rizzo II, the defendant, Todd Rizzo, offered public opinion polling\ndata for this court’s consideration as another purported source of evidence\nregarding contemporary standards of decency. See State v. Rizzo, supra,\n303 Conn. 194–95. Chief Justice Rogers, writing for the court in that case,\nproperly rejected the relevance of such information, ‘‘recogniz[ing] the weak-\nnesses inherent in public opinion polls as objective measures of the popular\npsyche . . . .’’ Id., 195.\n   Now, in a stark about-face, Chief Justice Rogers criticizes the majority\nfor not focusing on the question of whether a majority of Connecticut\ncitizens, as gauged by public opinion polls, currently believe that the death\npenalty is immoral. She then proceeds to cite to various opinion polls, polls\nthat demonstrate, at best, that a slim and shrinking majority of Connecticut\nregistered voters continue to support the death penalty. See Conn. Joint\nStanding Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 8, 2012 Sess., p. 2623, remarks\nof Senator Edwin A. Gomes (reciting polling data and concluding therefrom\nthat ‘‘[t]he public [has] . . . soured on the death penalty’’).\n   Chief Justice Rogers simply ignores the fundamental principle that ‘‘[t]he\nright to be free [from] cruel and unusual punishments, like the other guaran-\ntees of the Bill of Rights, may not be submitted to vote . . . . The very\npurpose of a [b]ill of [r]ights was to withdraw certain subjects from the\nvicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of\nmajorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied\n\fby the courts.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Furman v. Georgia,\nsupra, 408 U.S. 268–69 (Brennan, J., concurring). ‘‘The [f]ramers were well\nacquainted with the danger of subjecting the determination of the rights of\none person to the tyranny of shifting majorities.’’ (Internal quotation marks\nomitted.)

That same principle animates article first of the constitution of\nConnecticut. It never has been the practice of this court to define the scope\nof our fundamental liberties according to a ‘‘popularity contest,’’ and we\nwill not begin to do so now. See Volusia County Kennel Club, Inc. v.\nHaggard, 73 So. 2d 884, 898 (Fla.) (‘‘If popularity contests ever become the\ncriteria for determining the validity of law, the uncontrolled will of the\nmob will become the substitute for constitutional government. It seems\nsuperfluous to say that a poll to ascertain public opinion should never be\nthe necessary prerequisite to a judicial opinion under our constitutional\nsystem for the administration of [j]ustice.’’), cert. denied sub nom. Lane v.\nVolusia County Kennel Club, Inc., 348 U.S. 865, 75 S. Ct. 87, 99 L. Ed. 681\n(1954); Gillis v. Yount, 748 S.W.2d 357, 369 (Ky. 1988) (Leibson, J., concur-\nring) (‘‘[c]onstitutional validity is not decided by a popularity contest’’).\n   88\n      As we have recognized, society’s standards of decency need not always\nevolve in the same direction. We express no opinion as to the circumstances\nunder which a reviewing court might conclude, on the basis of a revision\nto our state’s capital felony statutes or other change in these indicia, that\ncapital punishment again comports with Connecticut’s standards of decency\nand, therefore, passes constitutional muster. See Fleming v. Zant, supra,\n259 Ga. 690 (conclusion that prospective repeal of death penalty as to\nmentally disabled offenders rendered execution of such individuals imper-\nmissibly cruel and unusual punishment did not amount to ‘‘per se’’ prohi-\nbition).\n   89\n      In her dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Rogers accuses the majority of,\namong other things, cherry picking its sources, improperly advocating for\ncertain political agendas, imposing its personal moral beliefs and policy\npreferences on the people of Connecticut, disregarding this court’s prece-\ndents, and usurping the legislature’s power. If Chief Justice Rogers truly\nbelieves that we have arrived at this conclusion by ‘‘relying solely on [our]\nown views’’ about capital punishment; footnote 33 of Chief Justice Rogers’\ndissenting opinion; and merely because ‘‘it offends [our own] subjective\nsense of morality,’’ it is only because she herself has refused either to\nconsider or to recognize the import of the words of our elected officials,\nthe actions of our jurors and prosecutors, the story of our history, the path\ntrodden by our sister states, and the overwhelming evidence that our society\nno longer considers the death penalty to be necessary or appropriate. In\nany event, we do not question the sincerity or good faith of Chief Justice\nRogers’ views, and we find it unfortunate that she deems it necessary to\nquestion ours. Although it should go without saying, we feel compelled to\nemphasize that we, no less than the dissenting justices, have decided this\ncase on the basis of our understanding of and dedication to the governing\nlegal principles, and our decision should in no way be taken as an indication\nof our personal views with respect to the morality of capital punishment.\n   90\n      There is presumably some de minimus incapacitative value to the death\npenalty in that one in prison for life may still escape or offend against other\ninmates and prison staff.\n   91\n      Public Act 12-5 simultaneously abolished the death penalty for all crimes\ncommitted on or after April 25, 2012, while preserving it for identical crimes\ncommitted prior to that date. The act contains no statement of policy or\nunderlying findings purporting to explain the rationale therefor.\n   92\n      As authority for this theory, Chief Justice Rogers relies on public state-\nments made by Professor Barry, as well as a brief, conclusory citation to\nPeople v. Floyd, 31 Cal. 4th 179, 191, 72 P.3d 820, 1 Cal. Rptr. 3d 885 (2003).\nThere is no indication what empirical evidence, if any, supports this novel\ntheory of deterrence.\n   93\n      See, e.g., I. Ehrlich, ‘‘The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: A\nQuestion of Life and Death,’’ 65 Am. Econ. Rev. 397, 397–98 (1975); M.\nFrakes & M. Harding, ‘‘The Deterrent Effect of Death Penalty Eligibility:\nEvidence from the Adoption of Child Murder Eligibility Factors,’’ 11 Am.\nL. & Econ. Rev. 451, 494–95 (2009); C. Sunstein & A. Vermeule, ‘‘Is Capital\nPunishment Morally Required? Acts, Omissions, and Life-Life Tradeoffs,’’\n58 Stan. L. Rev. 703, 706 (2005).\n   94\n      See generally J. Donohue & J. Wolfers, ‘‘Uses and Abuses of Empirical\nEvidence in the Death Penalty Debate,’’ 58 Stan. L. Rev. 791 (2005) (ques-\n\ftioning reliability of existing data on deterrence); J. Fagan, ‘‘Death and\nDeterrence Redux: Science, Law and Causal Reasoning on Capital Punish-\nment,’’ 4 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 255 (2006) (concluding that there is no reliable\nevidence of deterrence and that studies demonstrating deterrent effect are\nfraught with error); M. Radelet & T. Lacock, ‘‘Do Executions Lower Homicide\nRates?: The Views of Leading Criminologists,’’ 99 J. Crim. L. & Criminology\n489 (2009) (overwhelming consensus among criminologists is that death\npenalty does not add any significant deterrent effect above that of long-\nterm imprisonment).\n   95\n      See Death Penalty Information Center, ‘‘Execution List 2014,’’ available\nat http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/execution-list-2014 (last visited July 27,\n2015); see also B. Newton, supra, 13 J. App. Prac. & Process 42 (average\ntime from sentencing to execution is close to twenty years when postappeal\nresentencings are taken into account).\n   96\n      To the extent that the dissenting justices contend that such delays are\nconstitutionally irrelevant because they are the fault of criminal defendants,\nwho improperly delay their executions by filing frivolous appeals and post-\nconviction challenges, we cannot agree. As Justice Breyer explained in his\ndissenting opinion in Glossip v. Gross, supra, 135 S. Ct. 2726, between 1973\nand 1995, state and federal courts found errors in more than two thirds of\nthe capital cases that they reviewed. Id., 2771 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Delays,\nthen, are indispensable if the ultimate punishment is to be reliably applied,\nand, if the constitution did not mandate such close scrutiny, the execution\nof innocent persons would inevitably result. See id., 2771–72 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting); see also Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 422, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131\nL.

In fact, the opposite may be true. In the three years prior to Ross’\n2005 execution, an average of 102 murders were committed annually in\nConnecticut, a figure that is actually inflated by virtue of the inclusion of\nsixteen deaths resulting from a single nursing home arson. Crimes Analysis\nUnit, Department of Emergency Services & Public Protection, ‘‘Crime in\nConnecticut: January–December 2011’’ (2013) p. 11, available at http://\nwww.dpsdata.ct.gov/dps/ucr/data/2011/Crime%20In%20Connecticut%20-\nCOMPLETE%202011.pdf (last visited July 27, 2015). By contrast, from 2006\nthrough 2008, an average of 124 murders were committed per annum; id.;\na 22 percent increase.\n   We also note that murder rates actually fell in the wake of the mid-2012\nabolition of the death penalty. The number of reported murders in the state’s\nlargest urban areas fell by more than 33 percent in the first half of 2013, as\ncompared to the first half of 2012. See Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n‘‘Crime in the United States 2013: January-June Preliminary Semiannual\nUniform Crime Report,’’ Table 4, available at http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/\ncjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/preliminary-semiannual-uniform-crime-\n report-january-june-2013/tables/table-4-cuts/table_4_offenses_reported_to_\n\flaw_enforcement_by_state_colorado_through_idaho_2013.xls (last visited\nJuly 27, 2015).

See,\ne.g., W. Holdsworth, supra, p. 519 (as many as eleven people were hanged\nas witches in seventeenth century Connecticut).\n   102\n       We note that P.A. 12-5 does not prevent the state from seeking the\ndeath penalty for any future defendant who is accused of having committed\na capital felony prior to April 25, 2012, and one defendant, Richard Roszkow-\nski, was in fact sentenced to death in May, 2014; A. Griffin, ‘‘New Death\nSentence,’’ Hartford Courant, May 23, 2014, pp. A1, A5; approximately two\nyears after the enactment of P.A. 12-5.\n   103\n       In Ross, we adopted these principles under the due process clauses of\nthe state constitution. See State v. Ross, supra, 230 Conn. 252 (principles\narticulated by United States Supreme Court ‘‘require, as a constitutional\nminimum, that a death penalty statute, on the one hand, must channel the\ndiscretion of the sentencing judge or jury so as to [ensure] that the death\npenalty is being imposed consistently and reliably and, on the other hand,\nmust permit the sentencing judge or jury to consider, as a mitigating factor,\nany aspect of the individual defendant’s character or record as well as the\ncircumstances of the particular offense’’); see also State v. Rizzo, supra,\n266 Conn. 227 (same).\n   104\n       Justice Norcott has long expressed his profound concern that, ‘‘[a]s\nlong as racial prejudice is a factor in our lives, and it is an undeniable factor\nin every facet of American life, there can be no place for a capital penalty\nin our society.’’ State v. Webb, supra, 238 Conn. 570 (Norcott, J., dissenting);\nsee also State v. Cobb, supra, 251 Conn. 545–46 (Norcott, J., dissenting) (‘‘I\nam convinced that the arbitrariness inherent in the sentencer’s discretion\nis intensified by the issue of race’’). In their concurring opinion, Justices\nNorcott and McDonald refer to what now appears to be strong evidence\ndemonstrating that impermissible racial and ethnic disparities have, in fact,\npermeated this state’s capital sentencing scheme. We decline to address or\nresolve such claims, however, because they are not before us at this time.\n   105\n       We fail to discern the contradiction that Chief Justice Rogers apparently\nsees in recognizing that the citizens of Connecticut, as a people, have tradi-\ntionally been at the forefront in adopting a more modern and humane system\nof criminal justice; see part I B of this opinion; while at the same time\nacknowledging that the decisions of individual jurors and prosecutors may\nat times be tainted by the same sorts of subconscious biases and prejudices\nwith which all of us wrestle. Cf. United States v. Mulkis, 39 F.3d 664, 664\n(W.D. Wn. 1930) (‘‘surely there is not a righteous man [on] earth that doeth\ngood and sinneth not’’ [internal quotation marks omitted]).\n   106\n       See J. Donohue, ‘‘Capital Punishment in Connecticut, 1973–2007: A\nComprehensive Evaluation from 4686 Murders to One Execution,’’ pp. 130–\n31, 143, available at http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=\n1095&context=john_donohue (last visited July 27, 2015).\n   107\n       Once again, these concerns were at the forefront for the legislators\nwho supported P.A. 12-5; see footnote 50 of this opinion and accompanying\ntext; and for Governor Malloy when he signed the act. See Governor’s\nStatement, supra (‘‘In the trenches of a criminal courtroom, I learned first-\nhand that our system of justice is very imperfect. While it’s a good system\n\fdesigned with the highest ideals of our democratic society in mind, like most\nof human experience, it is subject to the fallibility of those who participate in\nit. I saw people who were poorly served by their counsel. I saw people\nwrongly accused or mistakenly identified. I saw discrimination. In bearing\nwitness to those things, I came to believe that doing away with the death\npenalty was the only way to ensure it would not be unfairly imposed.’’).\n    108\n        Legislators who supported P.A. 12-5 and those who opposed it agreed\nthat public outrage at the perpetrators in the Cheshire case in particular\nwas a primary reason the act was drafted to retain the death penalty retroac-\ntively. See, e.g., 55 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 2012 Sess., p. 539, remarks of Senator\nKissel (‘‘there’s no political will to abolish the death penalty because of\nthose two’’); 55 S.

The two people—the two men that\ncommitted those acts of violence are not men at all. They are animals. And\nI don’t want to let them off the hook . . . .’’); 55 H.R. Proc., Pt. 4, 2012\nSess., p. 1383, remarks of Representative Lawrence F. Cafero, Jr. (‘‘in many\nrespects it’s because of [Hayes and Komisarjevsky] that we have the bill that\nwe have before us’’); Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt.\n8, 2012 Sess., p. 2544, remarks of Senator Martin M. Looney (legislature\ndeferred consideration of repeal in 2011 due to Cheshire case).\n    By contrast, every legislator whom Chief Justice Rogers cites as having\nbeen equally committed to executing the other residents of death row voted\nagainst P.A. 12-5, and would have retained the death penalty both retroac-\ntively and prospectively. Their principled views, while no less deserving of\nrespect, are simply not relevant to the question before us: whether those\nlegislators who voted to abolish capital punishment only on the condition\nthat it be retained for those already occupying death row did so out of a\nprincipled belief in the appropriateness of the death penalty or, rather, to\nsatisfy a public or private call for vengeance against the perpetrators in the\nCheshire case.\n    109\n        B. Connors, ‘‘Prague: ‘Hang the Animal By His . . .’,’’ NBC Connecticut\n(May 12, 2011), quoting Senator Edith Prague, available at http://\nwww.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Prague-Hang-the-Animal-by-His-\n121670559.html (last visited July 27, 2015).\n    110\n        Because we conclude both that the continued imposition of the death\npenalty in Connecticut following the enactment of P.A. 12-5 offends contem-\nporary standards of decency and that it fails to satisfy any legitimate penolog-\nical objective, we need not determine whether it has come to be so rarely\nimposed that it also violates the state constitutional prohibition on unusual\npunishment. As we discussed; see footnote 16 of this opinion; the United\nStates Supreme Court has at times suggested that the eighth amendment\nmay contain an independent prohibition against punishments that are\n\funusual, even if they are not cruel. Recent scholarship supports this interpre-\ntation and suggests that, especially in light of the enactment of P.A. 12-5,\nthe death penalty in Connecticut has become impermissibly unusual. See\nR. Casale & J. Katz, ‘‘Would Executing Death-Sentenced Prisoners after the\nRepeal of the Death Penalty Be Unusually Cruel under the Eighth Amend-\nment?,’’ 86 Conn. B.J. 329, 341, 344–45 (2012). For example, Professor John\nF. Stinneford has observed that, under the original meaning of unusual\npunishment, ‘‘when a traditional [common-law] punishment falls completely\nout of usage, it loses the presumption of validity that comes with being\nusual,’’ and attempts to reintroduce it would be met with as much or more\nscrutiny as entirely novel punishments. J. Stinneford, ‘‘The Original Meaning\nof ‘Unusual’: The Eighth Amendment as a Bar to Cruel Innovation,’’ 102 Nw.\nU. L. Rev. 1739, 1746, 1813 (2008). This reflects the principle that, ‘‘[a]s\ncourts decide cases year after year and century after century, impractical\nand unjust legal practices fall away like dross, while practical and just ones\nsurvive’’; J. Stinneford, supra, 1775; and may apply with equal force to\npunishments eliminated by legislative reform. See id., 1814. This interpreta-\ntion of the constitutional ban on unusual punishment also is consistent with\nConnecticut common law in the years leading up to the adoption of the\n1818 constitution. See, e.g., State v. Smith, supra, 5 Day (Conn.) 178–79\n(reviewing claim that punishment was new or ‘‘novel, without precedent’’);\nL. Goodheart, supra, pp. 68, 76–77 (in 1808, legislature voted to commute\ndeath sentence of Clarissa Ockry, who otherwise would have been first\nwoman executed in Connecticut for infanticide since 1753).\n   111\n       Although Justice Zarella contends otherwise, we disagree for the rea-\nsons stated in this opinion.\n   112\n       Although it might have been helpful for the defendant himself to review\nthe additional historical information that has come to light over the past\nseveral years, his failure to do so does not preclude our consideration of\ninformation revealed from our own independent research. See part IV A 3\nof this opinion.\n   113\n       See part IV C of this opinion.\n   114\n       To respond that appellate courts simply should refuse to consider or\naddress any questions of legislative fact that have not already been fully\nvetted by the parties at the trial level is to miss the point. When a court\nconsiders a legislative fact, it typically is because that fact is central to a\nquestion of policy the necessary determination of which will broadly impact\npersons who are not parties to the immediate dispute. To turn a blind eye\nto relevant and well established scientific or sociological knowledge that\nthe parties may have overlooked or decided to leave unearthed, whether\nfor strategic or financial reasons, would unjustly and unwisely subject the\npublic at large to the results of an ill-informed decision.\n   115\n       Of course, if the citizens of Connecticut wish to reinstate the death\npenalty, they may always amend the state constitution, as the citizens of\nCalifornia and Massachusetts did, to clarify that the punishment is and will\nremain constitutional notwithstanding any evolution in the state’s standards\nof decency.\n   116\n       See footnote 89 of this opinion.\n\f",

Although the death penalty has been a\nfixture of Connecticut’s criminal law since early colo-\nnial times, public opinion concerning it has long been\ndivided. In 2009, growing opposition to capital punish-\nment led the legislature to enact Public Acts 2009, No.\n09-107 (P.A. 09-107), which would have repealed the\ndeath penalty for all crimes committed on or after the\ndate of enactment but retained the death penalty for\ncapital felonies committed prior to that date. Then Gov-\nernor M. Jodi Rell vetoed P.A. 09-107, however, and it\ndid not become law. Three years later, in 2012, the\nlegislature passed a materially identical act that pro-\nspectively repealed the death penalty; see Public Acts\n2012, No. 12-5 (P.A. 12-5); and, this time, Governor Dan-\nnel P. Malloy signed it into law. During the public hear-\nings on both P.A. 09-107 and P.A. 12-5, supporters\nargued that the proposed legislation represented a mea-\nsured and lawful approach to the issue. Others raised\nserious concerns, however, as to whether, following a\nprospective only repeal, the imposition of the death\npenalty would violate the state constitutional prohibi-\ntion against cruel and unusual punishment. Perhaps\nmost notably, Chief State’s Attorney Kevin T. Kane, who\nserves as this state’s chief law enforcement officer and\nrepresents the state in the present case, testified before\nthe legislature that such a statute could not pass consti-\ntutional muster.1 Additionally, the Division of Criminal\nJustice submitted written testimony, in which it advised\nthe legislature that a prospective only repeal would be\na ‘‘fiction’’ and that, ‘‘[i]n reality, it would effectively\nabolish the death penalty for anyone who has not yet\nbeen executed because it would be untenable as a mat-\nter of constitutional law . . . . [A]ny death penalty that\nhas been imposed and not carried out would effectively\nbe nullified.’’2 In the present appeal, the defendant, Edu-\nardo Santiago, raises similar claims, contending that,\nfollowing the decision by the elected branches to abol-\nish capital punishment for all crimes committed on or\nafter April 25, 2012, it would be unconstitutionally cruel\nand unusual to execute offenders who committed capi-\ntal crimes before that date. Upon careful consideration\nof the defendant’s claims in light of the governing consti-\ntutional principles and Connecticut’s unique historical\nand legal landscape, we are persuaded that, following\nits prospective abolition, this state’s death penalty no\nlonger comports with contemporary standards of\ndecency and no longer serves any legitimate penological\npurpose. For these reasons, execution of those offend-\ners who committed capital felonies prior to April 25,\n2012, would violate the state constitutional prohibition\nagainst cruel and unusual punishment.\n   Following a trial on charges that included capital\nfelony in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999)\n§ 53a-54b (2)3 and General Statutes § 53a-8, a jury found\n\fthe defendant guilty as charged, and the trial court,\nLavine, J., rendered judgment accordingly.4 The court\nthen conducted a penalty phase hearing pursuant to\nGeneral Statutes (Rev. to 1999) § 53a-46a, at which the\njury found the existence of an aggravating factor, one\nor more jurors found the existence of one or more\nmitigating factors, and the jury found that the aggravat-\ning factor outweighed the mitigating factor or factors.\nThe trial court thereupon imposed a sentence of death,5\nand the defendant appealed to this court from both the\njudgment of conviction and the death sentence. See\nState v. Santiago, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 117–18, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2012) (Santiago I). While the appeal was pending, the\nlegislature repealed the death penalty for all crimes\ncommitted on or after the effective date of the repeal,\nApril 25, 2012. See P.A. 12-5. On June 12, 2012, this\ncourt ultimately affirmed the judgment of conviction\nbut reversed the sentence of death and remanded the\ncase for a new penalty phase hearing on the ground\nthat the defendant had been deprived of the opportunity\nto review and use certain potentially mitigating evi-\ndence. See State v. Santiago, supra, 215, 308. There-\nafter, the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration\nin which he asked this court to consider, among other\nthings, whether the prospective repeal leads inexorably\nto the conclusion that capital punishment has ceased\nto comport with state constitutional requirements. The\nadoption of P.A. 12-5, when considered in light of the\nhistory of capital punishment in our state and other\nrecent legal developments, compels us to conclude that\nthe death penalty now constitutes cruel and unusual\npunishment, in violation of the state constitution. Con-\nsequently, we reverse the judgment of the trial court\nwith respect to the sentence of death on the capital\nfelony count and remand the case to that court with\ndirection to sentence the defendant to life imprison-\nment without the possibility of release on that count.6\n  The underlying facts of this case, which are set forth\nin detail in Santiago I, may be summarized briefly as\nfollows. In December, 2000, Mark Pascual agreed to\ngive the defendant a snowmobile from Pascual’s repair\nshop if the defendant would kill the victim, Joseph\nNiwinski, for whose girlfriend Pascual had developed\nromantic feelings. Id., 121. That same month, with the\nassistance of Pascual and another friend, the defendant\nentered the victim’s apartment and shot and killed the\nvictim as he slept. Id., 123. The defendant was charged\nwith, among other things, the capital felony of ‘‘murder\ncommitted by a defendant who is hired to commit the\nsame for pecuniary gain,’’ in violation of § 53a-54b (2).\n   In his original appeal to this court, the defendant\nraised numerous challenges to his conviction of capital\nfelony and his conviction on other charges, as well as\nhis death sentence. Id., 142–46. This court affirmed the\ndefendant’s conviction on all counts; see id., 118, 143,\n308; and declined his invitation to revisit our prior deci-\n\fsions holding that the death penalty is not a per se\nviolation of the Connecticut constitution.7 Id., 307. We\nalso concluded, however, that the trial court, Solomon,\nJ., improperly had failed to disclose to the defendant\ncertain confidential records in the possession of the\nDepartment of Children and Families that were mitigat-\ning in nature. Id., 215, 239–41. Accordingly, we reversed\nthe trial court’s judgment with respect to the sentence\nof death and remanded the case to the trial court for\na new penalty phase hearing. Id., 241, 308.\n   While the defendant’s appeal was pending in this\ncourt, the legislature passed and the governor signed\nP.A. 12-5, which repealed the death penalty for all\ncrimes committed on or after the date of passage, April\n25, 2012. See generally P.A. 12-5. Shortly before we\nreleased our opinion in Santiago I, the defendant filed\na motion for permission to file a supplemental brief in\nsupport of his argument that the prospective abolition\nof capital punishment barred the state from seeking the\ndeath penalty at his new penalty phase hearing. See\nState v. Santiago, supra, 307–308 n.167. Specifically,\nthe defendant sought review of what we characterized\nas four ‘‘new appellate claims,’’ the first of which was\nthat, ‘‘although his crimes were committed prior to the\neffective date of [P.A. 12-5], that legislation nevertheless\n‘represents a fundamental change in the contemporary\nstandard[s] of decency in Connecticut and a rejection\nof the penological justifications for the death penalty,’\nrendering the death penalty now cruel and unusual pun-\nishment . . . .’’ Id., 308 n.167.\n   We denied the defendant’s motion, concluding that\nhis new appellate claims would be more appropriately\naddressed in the context of a postjudgment motion. See\nid. Thereafter, the defendant filed such a motion, in\nwhich he sought reconsideration of our decision in San-\ntiago I. In support of his motion, he again maintained,\namong other things, that P.A. 12-5 ‘‘represents a funda-\nmental change in the contemporary standard[s] of\ndecency in Connecticut and a rejection of the penologi-\ncal justifications for the death penalty, eliminating the\nconstitutional prerequisites to the validity of the death\npenalty, such that it is now cruel and unusual punish-\nment forbidden by . . . article first, §§ 8 and 9, of the\n[state] constitution . . . .’’ The defendant also urged\nthis court to order supplemental briefing and further\noral argument on this and related issues, particularly\nin light of the fact that the constitutionality of imposing\nthe death penalty following a prospective only repeal\npresents a question of first impression in Connecticut\nand one that, to our knowledge, no jurisdiction has\naddressed comprehensively in the modern era. See\nState v. Santiago, Conn. Supreme Court Records &\nBriefs, April Term, 2013, Amicus Brief of the American\nCivil Liberties Union Foundation of Connecticut p. 2.\nWe granted the defendant’s motion for reconsideration\nand request for supplemental briefing and further oral\n\fargument without limitation.8\n   On reconsideration, although the defendant focuses\non the claim that P.A. 12-5 creates an impermissible\nand arbitrary distinction between individuals who com-\nmitted murders before and after April 25, 2012, in light\nof the prospective abolition of capital punishment, he\nalso asks this court to ‘‘exercise its independent judg-\nment as to the current acceptability of the death penalty\nin Connecticut.’’ Specifically, he argues that the enact-\nment of P.A. 12-5 means that ‘‘the death penalty is no\nlonger consistent with standards of decency in Connect-\nicut and does not serve any valid penological objective.’’\nThat claim is the sole issue that we address herein.9\n   Public Act 12-5 not only reflects this state’s long-\nstanding aversion to carrying out executions, but also\nrepresents the seminal change in the four century long\nhistory of capital punishment in Connecticut. Accompa-\nnying this dramatic departure are a host of other\nimportant developments that have transpired over the\npast several years. Historians have given us new chroni-\ncles of the history and devolution of the death penalty\nin Connecticut. Legal scholars have provided new\nunderstandings of the original meaning of the constitu-\ntional prohibition against cruel and unusual punish-\nments. Social scientists repeatedly have confirmed that\nthe risk of capital punishment falls disproportionately\non people of color and other disadvantaged groups.\nMeanwhile, nationally, the number of executions and\nthe number of states that allow the death penalty con-\ntinue to decline, and convicted capital felons in this\nstate remain on death row for decades with every likeli-\nhood that they will not be executed for many years to\ncome, if ever. Finally, it has become apparent that the\ndual federal constitutional requirements applicable to\nall capital sentencing schemes—namely, that the jury\nbe provided with objective standards to guide its sen-\ntence, on the one hand, and that it be accorded unfet-\ntered discretion to impose a sentence of less than death,\non the other—are fundamentally in conflict and inevita-\nbly open the door to impermissible racial and ethnic\nbiases. For all these reasons, and in light of the apparent\nintent of the legislature in prospectively repealing the\ndeath penalty and this state’s failure to implement and\noperate a fair and functional system of capital punish-\nment, we conclude that the state constitution no longer\npermits the execution of individuals sentenced to death\nfor crimes committed prior to the enactment of P.A.\n12-5.\n  In part I of this opinion, we review the scope, nature,\nand history of the protections from cruel and unusual\npunishment afforded by article first, §§ 8 and 9, of the\nconstitution of Connecticut, both as a general matter\nand as applied to capital punishment in particular. In\npart II of this opinion, we explain why, in view of the\nadoption of P.A. 12-5, and the state’s near total morato-\n\frium on carrying out executions over the past fifty-\nfive years, capital punishment has become incompatible\nwith contemporary standards of decency in Connecti-\ncut and, therefore, now violates the state constitutional\nprohibition against excessive and disproportionate pun-\nishments. In part III of this opinion, we explain why\nthe prospective repeal also means that the death penalty\nnow fails to satisfy any legitimate penological purpose\nand is unconstitutionally excessive on that basis as well.\nFinally, in part IV of this opinion, we address certain\ngeneral objections raised by the dissenting justices, and\nwe explain why their arguments are unpersuasive.10\n                             I\n     STATE CONSTITUTIONAL PROHIBITIONS\n        AGAINST CRUEL AND UNUSUAL\n               PUNISHMENT\n   Since this court first considered the constitutionality\nof capital punishment, we have recognized that, ‘‘in the\narea of fundamental civil liberties—which includes all\nprotections of the declaration of rights contained in\narticle first of the Connecticut constitution—we sit as\na court of last resort. In such constitutional adjudica-\ntion, our first referent is Connecticut law and the full\npanoply of rights Connecticut citizens have come to\nexpect as their due.’’11 (Internal quotation marks omit-\nted.)

Because we have\nnot previously undertaken a comprehensive review of\nthese constitutional liberties, we first consider their\nscope and nature in full, before considering how they\napply to the defendant’s specific challenge to Connecti-\ncut’s current capital punishment scheme. In parts II\nand III of this opinion, we turn to that issue, namely,\n\fwhether, in light of the enactment of P.A. 12-5, the\nConnecticut constitution now forbids the imposition of\nthe death penalty.\n  In State v.

These factors,\nwhich we consider in turn, inform our application of the\nestablished state constitutional standards—standards\nthat, as we explain hereinafter, derive from United\nStates Supreme Court precedent concerning the eighth\namendment—to the defendant’s claims in the present\ncase.14\n                            A\n           Federal Constitutional Standards\n   The eighth amendment to the federal constitution\nestablishes the minimum standards for what constitutes\nimpermissibly cruel and unusual punishment.15 See, e.g.,\nState v.

Specifically, the\nUnited States Supreme Court has indicated that at least\nthree types of punishment may be deemed unconstitu-\ntionally cruel: (1) inherently barbaric punishments; (2)\nexcessive and disproportionate punishments; and (3)\narbitrary or discriminatory punishments.16 In Ross, we\nbroadly adopted, as a matter of state constitutional\nlaw, this federal framework for evaluating challenges\nto allegedly cruel and unusual punishments.17 See State\nv.

As currently construed,\nthen, the federal constitution simultaneously requires\nthat states narrowly limit and carefully define which\noffenders are eligible for capital punishment, while,\nparadoxically, also giving prosecutors and juries,\nrespectively, virtually unfettered discretion whether\nactually to charge defendants with capital crimes and\nwhether to sentence convicted offenders to death.\n   In response to Furman and Gregg, a majority of the\nstates, including Connecticut, drafted new capital pun-\nishment statutes in the 1970s that attempted to define\nwith greater precision that small subset of felonies the\ncommission of which could subject an offender to the\nultimate punishment. During the ensuing four decades,\na majority of the United States Supreme Court has con-\ntinued to hold—in the face of persistent dissent—that\ncapital punishment comports with contemporary Amer-\nican standards of decency, satisfies legitimate penologi-\ncal objectives, and is not imposed in an impermissibly\narbitrary or discriminatory manner.

That court, however, never has addressed the\nspecific issue raised by the present appeal, namely,\nwhether a state’s prospective only repeal of its capital\nfelony statutes renders its continued imposition of the\ndeath penalty unconstitutionally excessive and dispro-\nportionate punishment. Indeed, the parties have not\nbrought to our attention any case in which a federal\ncourt has addressed that question.\n                            B\n         Relevant State Constitutional History\n  We next consider our state’s constitutional and pre-\nconstitutional history with respect to the freedom from\ncruel and unusual punishment.20 We consider, first, the\npreconstitutional era and the legal traditions that inform\nthe meaning of the Connecticut constitution and, sec-\nond, the period leading up to the adoption of the Con-\nnecticut constitution of 1818.21\n                            1\n          Preconstitutional Legal Traditions\n   We first consider the preconstitutional roots of the\nfreedom from cruel and unusual punishment in Con-\nnecticut. As early as 1672, our colonial code, which\nincorporated a quasi-constitutional statement of indi-\nvidual liberties, provided that, ‘‘for bodily punishment,\nnone shall be inflicted that are Inhumane, Barbarous\nor Cruel.’’22 The Book of the General Laws for the People\nwithin the Jurisdiction of Connecticut (1672) p. 58\n\f(Laws of Connecticut); see also W. Holdsworth, Law\nand Society in Colonial Connecticut, 1636–1672 (1974)\np. 484 (unpublished doctoral dissertation, Claremont\nGraduate School) (explaining that 1672 code incorpo-\nrated what were, in essence, constitutional statutes).\nThe 1672 code also differed from prior Connecticut\nstatutes in that it (1) forbade the use of torture to extract\nconfessions, (2) placed new restrictions on the use of\ncorporal punishment, and (3) afforded novel procedural\nrights to criminal defendants, especially in capital\ncases.23 See Laws of Connecticut, supra, p. 65; W. Hold-\nsworth, supra, pp. 513–14, 527, 539, 581. Many of these\nprotections, in turn, derived from the Massachusetts\nBody of Liberties of 1641; see C. Collier, ‘‘The Common\nLaw and Individual Rights in Connecticut Before the\nFederal Bill of Rights,’’ 76 Conn. B.J. 1, 12 (2002); a\ndeclaration of rights that was far more progressive24\nthan English law at that time.25 See A. Granucci, ‘‘ ‘Nor\nCruel and Unusual Punishments Inflicted:’ The Original\nMeaning,’’ 57 Calif. L. Rev. 839, 851 (1969).\n   In perhaps the most substantial scholarly account of\nthe early legal traditions of the Connecticut colony,\nWilliam K. Holdsworth offers a window into the original\nmeaning of Connecticut’s inceptive prohibition of cruel\npunishment. Holdsworth describes the years leading up\nto the adoption of the 1672 code as a key formative\nperiod in the colony’s legal history. W. Holdsworth,\nsupra, p. x. ‘‘The decade [of 1662 through 1672] was\na watershed in the early history of Connecticut,’’ he\nexplains, ‘‘a period of profound intellectual, social, eco-\nnomic, and political change that set the colony on a\ncourse of its own.’’ Id., p. 582. During this period of\n‘‘extraordinarily rapid and vital change’’; id., p. 479; a\nnew generation of leaders restructured the colony’s\npolitical and judicial systems. See id., pp. 479–80, 547–\n48. The legislature ‘‘made fairer use of its juries . . .\ngave formal recognition to numerous civil liberties, dis-\nplayed a greater awareness of individual rights, dealt\nless severely with most criminal offenders than before,\nand, either formally or in practice, reduced the penalties\nfor several capital crimes.’’ Id., pp. 547–48. In the pro-\ncess, Connecticut’s new leaders bequeathed to its citi-\nzens a ‘‘legacy of moderation . . . .’’ Id., p. 545.\n   During the decade, dramatic shifts in public, judicial,\nand executive attitudes toward crime and punishment\nresulted in fundamental changes in how the criminal\nlaw was applied, changes that directly foreshadowed\nthe prohibition against cruel punishment and other free-\ndoms that the legislature enshrined in the 1772 code.\n‘‘[N]ew social conditions and new attitudes on the part\nof the people and their leaders’’ that emerged during\nthe decade of 1662 through 1672 were mirrored by a\ngrowing judicial leniency.26 Id., p. 537. Magistrates\nenjoyed considerable latitude in enforcing the nascent\ncriminal code during this period, and Holdsworth sug-\ngests that the penalties that were actually imposed may\n\fprovide a more accurate picture of Connecticut’s early\nlegal landscape, and particularly of public attitudes\nregarding what constituted acceptable punishment,\nthan the first legal codes themselves provided. See id.,\npp. 353–54. Although the punishments prescribed often\nwere severe, the criminal law generally was enforced\nwithout ‘‘needless cruelty’’ in the 1660s; id., p. 286; and,\nover the course of the decade, courts became increas-\ningly lenient in the sanctions they imposed. See id., pp.\n286–87, 363, 576. Whipping began to fall out of favor,\nfor example, with fines—and, in the case of fornication,\nmandatory marriage—emerging as the primary sanction\nfor many sexual crimes and crimes against property.\nSee id., pp. 292, 295–300, 313–17. More brutal forms of\ncorporal punishment ‘‘all but disappeared . . . .’’ Id., p.\n364. Christopher Collier, Connecticut’s state historian,\nobserved that, ‘‘through the imposition of lenient pun-\nishments outside of statutory specifications, nonen-\nforcement of restrictive statutes, a tendency to let local\nconsensus be their guide, and a punctilious regard for\ndue process . . . Connecticut’s jurists lightened the\nload of ancient oppressive laws . . . .’’ C. Collier,\nsupra, 76 Conn. B.J. 49–50.\n   ‘‘[This unmistakable] tendency toward judicial mod-\neration in the use of physical punishments in the years\n[1662 through 1675] . . . is all the more pronounced\nwhen we consider capital crimes and capital punish-\nment.’’ W. Holdsworth, supra, p. 365. As public attitudes\nevolved, magistrates grew more reluctant to inflict capi-\ntal punishment and came to believe that the death pen-\nalty should be reserved for only the most heinous and\nuniversally condemned offenses. See id., pp. 382, 431.\nBefore adultery was demoted from a capital offense to\na lesser crime in 1672; C. Collier, supra, 76 Conn. B.J.\n19; for example, ‘‘magistrates displayed marked reluc-\ntance to inflict death for the offense’’; W. Holdsworth,\nsupra, p. 533; and courts found ways to avoid imposing\nthe statutory death penalty on adulterers. C. Collier,\nsupra, 19 n.42. By the 1670s, courts also were demon-\nstrating less willingness ‘‘to exact the full measure of\nretribution’’ for sodomy and other capital crimes. W.\nHoldsworth, supra, p. 418; see also id., pp. 371, 519. In\n1677, for example, a jury declined to convict Nicholas\nSension of capital sodomy, despite what Holdsworth\nsuggests was clear evidence of his guilt. See id., pp.\n418–19.\n   Even more than the courts, however, it was Connecti-\ncut’s forward thinking governor, John Winthrop, Jr., a\nleading colonial physician and scientist, who was\nresponsible for the restraint that the colony began to\nexercise in the 1660s with respect to capital crimes\nranging from witchcraft and blasphemy, on the one\nhand, to adultery, sodomy, and rape, on the other. See\nid., pp. 522–25, 579–80. Governor Winthrop’s ‘‘legendary\ntoleration and the force of his moderating influence\nover the affairs of his colony’’ effectively extinguished\n\fthe colony’s hysteria over witchcraft, and ultimately\nresulted in the delisting of adultery as a capital crime\nin 1672.27 Id., p. 580. Holdsworth concludes that this\ndramatic evolution in public and judicial attitudes\ntoward crime and penology during the 1660s directly\ninfluenced the decision in 1672 to adopt key freedoms\nthat Massachusetts afforded its criminal defendants,\nincluding the freedoms from inhumane, barbarous and\ncruel punishments, in addition to torture, when formu-\nlating the new colonial statutes. See id., pp. 513, 537,\n539, 582. ‘‘The [c]ode of 1672 expounded in the language\nof law the new ideal of a new generation, a more moder-\nate, more explicit, more progressive conception’’ of\ncrime and punishment. Id., p. 582. ‘‘By giving formal\nlegal recognition to many of the changes that had tran-\nspired during the preceding decade,’’ Holdsworth\nexplains, ‘‘the [c]ode of 1672 reflected to a greater\nextent than its predecessor the essential institutional\ncharacter that was to mark Connecticut for the remain-\nder of the colonial period.’’ Id., p. 583.\n   In addition to abolishing such brutal forms of capital\npunishment as flogging to death and breaking on the\nwheel, the 1672 code lessened the severity of many\ncriminal sanctions, reducing the maximum number of\nlashes that could be imposed for noncapital crimes and\nreplacing whipping with imprisonment as the penalty\nfor others. See id., pp. 513, 537–39, 576. Moreover,\nalthough legislators did retain severe corporal punish-\nments such as branding, which replaced death as the\npenalty for those crimes that were decapitalized in 1672,\ncourt records indicate that such punishments were\nrarely if ever inflicted. See id., pp. 535, 576.\n   It is apparent from this history that, long before the\nadoption of either the federal or state constitution, Con-\nnecticut citizens enjoyed a quasi-constitutional freedom\nfrom cruel punishment, one that reflected our unique\nsocial and political traditions and that far exceeded the\nprotections recognized in England at the time. These\nprotections were enshrined in Connecticut’s early con-\nstitutional statutes and common law, and, from the\nstart, were intimately tied to the principles of due\nprocess.\n                            2\n                          1818\n  We next consider the historical circumstances lead-\ning up to the adoption of the state constitution in 1818.\nThe late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries wit-\nnessed the twilight of a premodern system of criminal\njustice in the United States. See generally note, ‘‘The\nEighth Amendment, Proportionality, and the Changing\nMeaning of ‘Punishments,’ ’’ 122 Harv. L. Rev. 960\n(2009). The rapid evolution in penology that occurred\nin the decades following the founding was especially\npronounced in Connecticut. The late eighteenth and\n\fearly nineteenth centuries in Connecticut witnessed a\npronounced liberalization in public, legislative, and judi-\ncial attitudes toward crime and punishment. The period\nhas been described as one characterized by penological\nreform, a broader commitment to human rights, and\nthe first serious public questioning of the moral legiti-\nmacy of capital punishment. See L. Goodheart, The\nSolemn Sentence of Death: Capital Punishment in Con-\nnecticut (2011) pp. 69–70. This time between the adop-\ntion of the federal and state constitutions also saw an\nemerging awareness of and compassion for ‘‘the fate of\nthe condemned perpetrator.’’ Id., p. 85. These changes\ncoincided with the reopening of the newly established\nNewgate Prison (Newgate) in 1790, which provided the\nopportunity to impose incarceration as an alternative\nto more severe traditional punishments. See id., p. 75.\n   During this period, Connecticut’s legislators, jurists,\nand citizens refined their understanding of what consti-\ntuted cruel and unusual punishment. Nowhere was this\nmore apparent than in the repudiation of corporal pun-\nishment as a legitimate penal sanction. ‘‘With the estab-\nlishment of a [s]tate prison, many of the barbarous\npunishments [began] to disappear from the statute\nbook, replaced by confinement for a term of years.’’\nJudicial and Civil History of Connecticut (D. Loomis &\nJ. Calhoun eds., 1895) p. 98. In 1808, for instance, ‘‘legis-\nlators crafted a less draconian statute for the regulation\nof female sexuality’’; L. Goodheart, supra, p. 77; and,\nby the middle of the next decade, a broad consensus\nhad emerged in the state that corporal punishment of\nany sort was degrading and debasing. See id., pp. 77–78.\nWhen the criminal code was revised in 1821 to comport\nwith the state constitution of 1818, bodily punishment\nwas largely abolished. See Judicial and Civil History of\nConnecticut, supra, pp. 98–99. The last vestige of the\nold system, the whipping post, survived only one decade\nmore as a punishment for theft.28 Id., p. 99.\n   Connecticut’s earliest reported judicial decisions\nindicate that the courts, like the legislature, had begun\nto adopt a broader conception of cruel and unusual\npunishment in the years leading up to the adoption of\nthe 1818 constitution. In State v. Smith, 5 Day (Conn.)\n175 (1811), for example, the defendant argued that\nimposing successive terms of imprisonment in Newgate\nfor multiple incidents of counterfeiting was ‘‘novel,\nwithout precedent, cruel and illegal.’’ Id., 178. A majority\nof this court ultimately denied the requested relief, but\nonly because it concluded that ‘‘[n]o injustice [was]\ndone to the prisoner; and this proceeding [was] neither\nnew, nor without precedent; such [had] been the usage\nof our courts, for many years past, in this state.’’ Id.,\n179. Indeed, the majority went out of its way to note\nthat courts ‘‘are bound to become acquainted with the\nsituation and circumstances of the prisoner, when they\npronounce the sentence. If through infirmity, it should\nappear to be inhuman or improper to confine him to\n\fhard labor, in Newgate, immediately upon conviction,\nit would be the duty of the court to postpone the com-\nmencement of his confinement, to a future day.’’ Id.\n   That Connecticut had developed by the turn of the\nnineteenth century a more expansive conception of\nwhat constituted impermissibly cruel punishment is fur-\nther revealed in the writings of former Chief Justice\nZephaniah Swift. Swift did not hesitate to condemn as\n‘‘cruel and illiberal’’ not only corporal punishment and\nthe like, but also what he saw as outmoded and unjust\ncommon-law traditions. 2 Z. Swift, A System of the Laws\nof the State of Connecticut (1796) p. 398. Practices\nranging from false imprisonment, to the denial of\ndefense counsel in capital cases, to punishing a parent\nfor harboring a fugitive child were all, to Swift, exam-\nples of cruelties that the law ought not countenance.\nSee id., pp. 58, 371–72, 398–99. Swift was especially\ntroubled by the traditional English punishment for sui-\ncide—forfeiture of the deceased’s estate and burial on\na public highway with a stake driven through the body—\nwhich he characterized as the product of a ‘‘barbarous\nperiod of superstition, and cruelty.’’ Id., p. 304.29\n   Nor was capital punishment immune from these\nbroader currents in Connecticut’s criminal justice sys-\ntem. Opposition to capital punishment gained traction\nin the decade before the adoption of the 1818 state\nconstitution. In 1808, then Judge Swift instructed a\ngrand jury that courts were adopting a ‘‘milder practice’’\nin applying the capital law. (Internal quotation marks\nomitted.) L. Goodheart, supra, p. 76; see also id., p.\n71. The following year, in a speech to the legislature,\nLieutenant Governor John Treadwell shared his view\nthat ‘‘[c]onfinement in Newgate . . . [was] terrible, but\nnot cruel; and it [was] probably more effectual to pre-\nvent [atrocious] crimes, than capital punishment\n. . . .’’ J. Treadwell, ‘‘Lieutenant Governor Treadwell’s\nSpeech to the Legislature of Connecticut: October,\n1809,’’ The American Register, January 1, 1810, p. 6.\nAlthough he lamented that there were few penitents\namong the inmates housed at Newgate, Treadwell pro-\nposed that providing them with Bibles and religious\ninstruction might have a beneficial effect. See id.\n   Finally, in a series of events that culminated in the\ndecision to convene a constitutional convention, the\nlegislature voted in 1816 to grant a new trial for Peter\nLung, who had been condemned to die for the murder\nof his wife. J. Zeldes, ‘‘Connecticut’s Most Memorable\n‘Good for Nothing Rascal’ in This ‘Land of Steady Hab-\nits,’ ’’ 80 Conn. B.J. 367, 380–81, 393–94 (2006). The\ndeciding vote in favor of a retrial was cast by a member\nof the governing council who ‘‘was not willing that a\nman should be [hanged as a result of] his vote.’’30 (Inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 394. Following his\nconviction upon retrial, Lung was in fact hanged. The\nfollowing week, the Middlesex Gazette published an\n\farticle remarking on the ‘‘infrequency of capital punish-\nment’’ and observing that the ‘‘[behavior] of this unfortu-\nnate sufferer on this trying occasion, was such as to\nattract the tenderest sympathy of every rational\nbeholder.’’ ‘‘Execution,’’ Middlesex Gazzette, reprinted\nin The Weekly Recorder: A Newpaper Conveying\nImportant Intelligence and Other Useful Matter Under\nthe Three General Heads of Theology, Literature and\nNational Affairs, July 31, 1816, p. 8.\n   In summary, it is clear that, from the earliest days of\nthe colonies, and extending until the adoption of the\nstate constitution in 1818,31 the people of Connecticut\nsaw themselves as enjoying significant freedoms from\ncruel and unusual punishment, freedoms that were safe-\nguarded by our courts and enshrined in our state’s pre-\nconstitutional statutory and common law. That our\nhistory reveals a particular sensitivity to such concerns\nwarrants our scrupulous and independent review of\nallegedly cruel and unusual practices and punishments,\nand informs our analysis thereof.\n                            C\n             Relevant Constitutional Text\n   We next consider the relevant provisions of the state\nconstitution. In light of our state’s firm and enduring\ncommitment to the principle that even those offenders\nwho commit the most heinous crimes should not be\nsubjected to inhumane, barbarous, or cruel punishment,\nthe question naturally arises why the framers of the\n1818 constitution decided to embed these traditional\nliberties in our dual due process clauses; see Conn.\nConst. (1818), art. I, §§ 9 and 10; rather than in an\nexpress punishments clause. Although there is no indi-\ncation that that question was debated during the 1818\nconstitutional convention, we find guidance in the\nbroader legal history of turn of the century Connecticut.\n    Connecticut was among three of the original thirteen\nstates that chose not to officially ratify the eighth\namendment or, indeed, any of the first ten amendments\nto the federal constitution.32 C. Leedham, Our Changing\nConstitution (1964) p. 41. In 1787, the state’s representa-\ntives to the federal constitutional convention had\nargued vehemently against the need for a bill of rights.\nSee C. Collier, supra, 57, 67. ‘‘In Connecticut, unlike\nthose states that had recently been under the domina-\ntion of royal and proprietary governors and appointed\nupper houses, limited government was taken for\ngranted. Calvinist theory described limited government,\n[Connecticut’s] Fundamental Orders [of 1639] pro-\nclaimed it, the [Connecticut] Charter [of 1662] estab-\nlished it, tradition demanded it, common law enforced\nit, and frequent elections guaranteed it.’’ Id., 53. During\nthe late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, for\nexample, Connecticut courts routinely safeguarded the\nbasic rights enshrined in the federal Bill of Rights on\n\fthe basis of natural rights or common law, without the\nneed for any formal constitutional sanction. See id., 31,\n65. Moreover, there was a particular fear in Connecticut\nthat the adoption of a written bill of rights would imply,\nby negative inference, that citizens were no longer enti-\ntled to unenumerated protections long enshrined in the\nstate’s common law.33 See id., 56–59. ‘‘A strong state-\nwide consensus, then, held that no bill of rights was\nnecessary and, indeed, might even limit individual lib-\nerty.’’ Id., 57.\n   Although this viewpoint had become less prevalent\nby 1818, when Connecticut adopted its first formal con-\nstitution; see id., 68–69; it retained many ‘‘influential\nadherents . . . .’’ Id., 69. This likely accounts for the\nfact that certain protections long entrenched in the\nstate’s constitutional common law were not expressly\nenumerated in the new written constitution. Indeed,\nin an 1821 speech, Governor Oliver Wolcott called on\nConnecticut’s courts to articulate and protect the many\nnatural rights that remained unenumerated by either\nconstitution or statute. See id., 37–38.\n   Accordingly, in Moore v. Ganim, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">660</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995), we ‘‘assume[d] that the framers\nbelieved that individuals would continue to possess\ncertain natural rights even if those rights were not enu-\nmerated in the written constitution. On the basis of this\nassumption, we [would] not draw firm conclusions from\nthe silence of the constitutional text. . . . Rather, in\ndetermining whether unenumerated rights were incor-\nporated into the constitution, we must focus on the\nframers’ understanding of whether a particular right\nwas part of the natural law, i.e., on the framers’ under-\nstanding of whether the particular right was so funda-\nmental to an ordered society that it did not require\nexplicit enumeration. We can discern the framers’\nunderstanding, of course, only by examining the histori-\ncal sources.’’ (Emphasis omitted.) Id., 601.\n   In her dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Rogers cites\nto Cologne v. Westfarms Associates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1201</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), for the proposition that, by the\ntime the 1818 constitution was adopted, the view that\nthe basic liberties of the people should be enshrined\nin a written constitution had come to prevail in Connect-\nicut. See footnote 6 of Chief Justice Rogers’ dissenting\nopinion. Chief Justice Rogers, however, neglects to con-\nsider an adjacent passage in Cologne that recognizes\nthat ‘‘[a]n opposing view was expressed that such a\ndetailed specification of individual rights was superflu-\nous and tended to abridge them, because all governmen-\ntal powers not granted by the constitution were\nreserved to the people.’’ Cologne v. Westfarms Associ-\nates, supra, 60. In fact, history reveals that article first\nof the 1818 constitution was born of and reflected a\ncompromise between these two constitutional philoso-\nphies. See R. Purcell, Connecticut in Transition: 1775–\n\f1818 (New Ed. 1963) pp. 241–42 (discussing opposition\nto bill of rights at constitutional convention and\nimplying that ultimate decision of which freedoms to\nenshrine and which to exclude was somewhat haphaz-\nard); J. Trumbull, Historical Notes on the Constitutions\nof Connecticut and on the Constitutional Convention\nof 1818 (1873) p. 53 (identifying prominent delegates\nto convention who opposed incorporation of any bill\nof rights in state constitution); J. Trumbull, supra, p.\n56 (recognizing ultimate compromise). For these rea-\nsons, we find little merit in the argument that the deci-\nsion of the framers of the Connecticut constitution not\nto include an express bar on cruel and unusual punish-\nment somehow suggests that this liberty was uncher-\nished.\n                              D\n           Relevant Connecticut Precedents\n   Turning to the next Geisler factor, namely, relevant\nConnecticut precedents, we write on a relatively blank\nslate with respect to cruel and unusual punishment.\nNevertheless, since this court first recognized in Ross\nthat our due process clauses independently prohibit\ncruel and unusual punishment; see State v. Ross, supra,\n230 Conn. 246–47; we have begun to carve out the broad\ncontours of that prohibition. In Ross itself, as we have\nnoted, we adopted the aforementioned federal frame-\nwork for evaluating challenges to allegedly cruel and\nunusual punishments. See id., 252. Specifically, we rec-\nognized that, under the state constitution, whether a\nchallenged punishment is cruel and unusual is to be\njudged according to the ‘‘evolving standards of human\ndecency’’; id., 251; and that those standards are reflected\nnot only in constitutional and legislative text, but also\n‘‘in our history and in the teachings of the jurisprudence\nof our sister states as well as that of the federal courts.’’\nId. In Ross, we also rejected the theory that ‘‘article first,\n§ 9, confers the authority to determine what constitutes\ncruel and unusual punishment solely on the Connecticut\nlegislature and not on the courts.’’ Id., 248. ‘‘Although\nwe should exercise our authority with great restraint,’’\nwe explained, ‘‘this court cannot abdicate its nondelega-\nble responsibility for the adjudication of constitutional\nrights.’’ Id., 249.\n   Subsequently, in Rizzo I, we characterized it as ‘‘set-\ntled constitutional doctrine that, independently of fed-\neral constitutional requirements, our due process\nclauses, because they prohibit cruel and unusual pun-\nishment, impose constitutional limits on the imposition\nof the death penalty.’’ State v. Rizzo, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">206</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In that case, we recognized that there is an ‘‘over-\narching concern for consistency and reliability in the\nimposition of the death penalty’’ under our state consti-\ntution. (Emphasis omitted.) Id., 233. Accordingly, in\norder to avoid having to resolve the state constitutional\nquestion raised in that case, we construed General Stat-\n\futes (Rev. to 1997) § 53a-46a to require that a jury must\nfind beyond a reasonable doubt that the death penalty\nis the appropriate penalty.34 See id., 234.\n   Most recently, in State v.

At that\ntime, we reiterated that, ‘‘in determining whether a par-\nticular punishment is cruel and unusual in violation of\n[state] constitutional standards, we must look beyond\nhistorical conceptions to the evolving standards of\ndecency that mark the progress of a maturing society.’’35\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 187–88. We also\n‘‘recognize[d] that assessing the propriety of [a punish-\nment] is not exclusively the domain of the legislature,\nand that this court has an independent duty to deter-\nmine that the penalty remains constitutionally viable\nas the sensibilities of our citizens evolve.’’ Id., 197. We\nreturn to these well established principles in parts II\nand III of this opinion.\n                            E\n          Persuasive Sister State Precedents\n    The unique structure and text of the Connecticut\nconstitution of 1965, in which the freedom from cruel\nand unusual punishment is embeded in our dual due\nprocess clauses rather than in a distinct punishments\nclause, mean that sister state authority is less directly\nrelevant than in cases in which we have construed other\nconstitutional provisions. We do agree with our sister\ncourts, however, that, under the state constitution, the\npertinent standards by which we judge the fairness,\ndecency, and efficacy of a punishment are necessarily\nthose of Connecticut. Although regional, national, and\ninternational norms may inform our analysis; see, e.g.,\nState v. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 188–96; the ultimate\nquestion is whether capital punishment has come to\nbe excessive and disproportionate in Connecticut. Cf.\nFleming v.

We apply this\nframework, however, with respect to the constitutional\nfacts as they exist in Connecticut and mindful of our\nstate’s unique and expansive constitutional and precon-\nstitutional history. To the extent that the sixth Geisler\nfactor—economic and sociological norms and policy\nconsiderations—is relevant, we take such considera-\ntions into account in parts II and III of this opinion, in\nwhich we address the defendant’s specific constitu-\ntional challenge.38\n                            II\n    THE DEATH PENALTY FAILS TO COMPORT\n      WITH CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS\n                OF DECENCY\n   We next consider whether the death penalty, as cur-\nrently imposed in Connecticut, and following the enact-\nment of P.A. 12-5, is so out of step with our contem-\nporary standards of decency as to violate the state con-\nstitutional ban on excessive and disproportionate pun-\nishment. We conclude that it is.\n   As we previously noted, both the federal and state\nconstitutions prohibit the imposition of any punishment\nthat is not proportioned and graduated to the offense\nof conviction.

Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 187–88.\n   On only two prior occasions has this court considered\nin any depth whether capital punishment violates the\nstate constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punish-\nment.

In those cases,\nwe considered—and at times blurred the lines\nbetween—two distinct constitutional challenges: (1)\nthe claim that capital punishment is inherently barbaric\npunishment and, therefore, offends the constitution at\nall times and under all circumstances; and (2) the claim\nthat, although capital punishment may once have com-\nported with constitutional requirements, our state’s\nstandards of decency have evolved such that execution\nnow constitutes excessive and disproportionate punish-\nment. See State v. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 187–88; State\nv. Ross, supra, 248, 250. The dissenting justice in Ross\nlikewise challenged capital punishment along both\nparameters. Compare State v. Ross, supra, 298 (Berdon,\nJ., dissenting in part) (‘‘[t]he punishment of death is\ninherently degrading to the dignity of a human being’’),\nwith id., 301–313 (Berdon, J., dissenting in part)\n(arguing that, inter alia, public no longer supports death\npenalty, penalty is unfairly applied, and recent evidence\ndoes not bear out deterrent effect).\n   The majority in Ross—consisting of two members of\nthis court and two Appellate Court judges sitting by\ndesignation—focused its attention on the per se ques-\ntion of whether the ‘‘imposition of the death penalty\ninvariably constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.’’\nId., 245. The majority evaluated the constitutionality of\nthe death penalty under the rubric of the six Geisler\nfactors. Id., 249–52. Dispensing with five of the factors\nin a single paragraph, the majority in Ross afforded each\nconsideration no more than one sentence of attention.40\nSee id., 249–50. The sixth Geisler factor, which encom-\npasses the full panoply of economic and sociological\nnorms and policy considerations, received only slightly\nmore attention. See id., 251–52.\n   With respect to the contention that the death penalty\nis fundamentally offensive to evolving standards of\ndecency, the majority dismissed the claim of the defen-\ndant, Michael B. Ross, with a one sentence quote from\nthe New Jersey Supreme Court: ‘‘When, in the course\nof a decade, thirty-seven states call for the death pen-\n\falty, the probability that the legislature of each state\naccurately reflects its community’s standards\napproaches certainty.’’ (Internal quotation marks omit-\nted.)

Accordingly, it was not until 2011, in Rizzo II,\nthat we first seriously explored the scope of the state\nconstitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nwith regard to the modern death penalty. See State v.\nRizzo, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">–201.\n   In Rizzo II, as in Ross, we had no difficulty rejecting\nthe defendant’s facial challenge, reasoning that a pen-\nalty that is referenced explicitly in the state constitution\ncannot have been unconstitutional at all times and\nunder all circumstances. See id., 188. In that case, how-\never, we also recognized that the fact that capital pun-\nishment has been practiced throughout much of our\nstate’s history and was considered constitutional in\n1818 says little about its legal status two centuries later.\nSee id., 187–88. Rather, under the governing legal frame-\nwork, ‘‘we must look beyond historical conceptions to\nthe evolving standards of decency that mark the prog-\nress of a maturing society. . . . This is because [t]he\nstandard of extreme cruelty is not merely descriptive,\nbut necessarily embodies a moral judgment. The stan-\ndard itself remains the same, but its applicability must\nchange as the basic mores of society change.’’ (Internal\nquotation marks omitted.) Id.; see also People v. Ander-\nson, supra, 6 Cal. 3d 637–39 (incidental references to\ndeath penalty in state constitution merely acknowledge\nthat penalty was in use at time of drafting and do not\nenshrine its constitutional status as standards of\ndecency evolve); District Attorney v. Watson, supra,\n381 Mass. 660–62 (interpretation of state constitutional\nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment is not\nstatic and depends on contemporary moral standards).\n\f   In Rizzo II, we also recognized that whether the death\npenalty constitutes excessive and disproportionate pun-\nishment is a subtler and more nuanced question than\nthe majority in Ross had acknowledged. Our under-\nstanding of what constitutes excessive punishment is\ninformed not only by the laws on the books, both in\nConnecticut and elsewhere, but also by developments\nin how those laws are applied by prosecutors and sen-\ntencing juries. See State v. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn.\n188–98. Accordingly, we undertook a more sweeping\nreview of contemporary social mores and the actual\nimplementation of capital punishment at the state,\nnational and even international levels. See id. We ulti-\nmately concluded, however, that ‘‘there remain[ed]\npowerful evidence of strong public support for the\ndeath penalty in the form of long-standing laws enacted\nby the democratically elected representatives of this\nstate and other jurisdictions within the United States\n. . . .’’ Id., 198. Notwithstanding various indications\nthat there had been a drop off in support for the death\npenalty, we perceived no ‘‘dramatic shift’’ in the consti-\ntutional or legislative landscape. (Internal quotation\nmarks omitted.) Id., 191.\n   We first take this opportunity to clarify that, although\na sudden sea change in public opinion would be suffi-\ncient to demonstrate a constitutionally significant shift\nin contemporary standards of decency, such a dramatic\nshift is not necessary for us to recognize that a punish-\nment has become repugnant to the state constitution.\nIf the legally salient metaphor is the evolution of our\nstandards of decency, then a gradual but inexorable\nextinction may be as significant as the sociological\nequivalent of the meteor that, it is believed, suddenly\nended the reign of the dinosaurs. In any event, new\ninsights into the history of capital punishment in Con-\nnecticut, in tandem with the legislature’s 2012 decision\nto abolish the death penalty prospectively, persuade us\nthat we now have not only a clear picture of the long,\nsteady devolution of capital punishment in our state,\nand, indeed, throughout New England, but also a dra-\nmatic and definitive statement by our elected officials\nthat the death penalty no longer can be justified as a\nnecessary or appropriate tool of justice.\n   This court and the United States Supreme Court have\nlooked to five objective indicia of society’s evolving\nstandards of decency: (1) the historical development\nof the punishment at issue; (2) legislative enactments;\n(3) the current practice of prosecutors and sentencing\njuries; (4) the laws and practices of other jurisdictions;\nand (5) the opinions and recommendations of profes-\nsional associations.43 See, e.g., Graham v.

The history of capital punishment\nin Connecticut is especially important both because\nsubstantial new historical information has become\navailable in recent years and because the ultimate legal\nquestion—whether the death penalty remains conso-\nnant with our evolving standards of decency following\nthe enactment of P.A. 12-5—necessarily requires that\nwe consider the broader historical perspective. We can-\nnot ascertain how our moral standards have evolved\nwithout first understanding what they once were.44\n   Our task in this regard has been greatly facilitated\nby Professor Lawrence B. Goodheart, who recently pub-\nlished the first comprehensive history of capital punish-\nment in Connecticut in ‘‘The Solemn Sentence of Death:\nCapital Punishment in Connecticut.’’ Beginning with the\nfounding of the Connecticut and New Haven colonies\nin the 1600s, and proceeding methodically through the\nfirst decade of the current millennium, Goodheart’s\naward winning45 book traces nearly 400 years of the\nstate’s implementation and public perception of the\ndeath penalty. Two recurring themes emerge from this\nsurvey. First, the acceptability of imposing death as a\nform of judicial punishment has declined steadily over\nConnecticut’s nearly 400 year history. Secularization,\nevolving moral standards, new constitutional and pro-\ncedural protections, and the availability of incarcera-\ntion as a viable alternative to execution have resulted\nin capital punishment being available for far fewer\ncrimes and criminals, and being imposed far less fre-\nquently, with a concomitant deterioration in public\nacceptance. Second, what has not changed is that,\nthroughout every period of our state’s history, the death\npenalty has been imposed disproportionately on those\nwhom society has marginalized socially, politically, and\neconomically: people of color, the poor and unedu-\ncated, and unpopular immigrant and ethnic groups. It\nalways has been easier for us to execute those we see\nas inferior or less intrinsically worthy.\n  Beginning with the seventeenth century, Goodheart\nexplains that early Connecticut penal statutes reflected\nthe Puritans’ deep-seated commitment to the Mosaic\nlegal code of the Old Testament. See L. Goodheart,\nsupra, pp. 10–12. In 1656, the New Haven colony recog-\nnized twenty-three different capital crimes. Id., p. 12.\nAn individual could be executed for conduct offending\nthe colony’s strict religious sensibilities (e.g., idolatry,\nwitchcraft, blasphemy, cursing or smiting a parent, defi-\nance by a rebellious son, profaning the Sabbath); for\nbehavior deemed to be sexually deviant (adultery, mas-\n\fturbation, bestiality, heterosexual and homosexual sod-\nomy, incest); for repeated incidents of burglary or\nrobbery; as well as for rape, rebellion, and killing of\nvarious sorts. See id. From the founding of the colonies\nthrough the end of the seventeenth century, more peo-\nple were executed in Connecticut for witchcraft\n(eleven) and for sexual infractions, such as bestiality\nand sodomy (eleven, including one rape), than for homi-\ncide (ten). See id., pp. 17, 22, 33.\n  Even in that era, however, judges and juries often\nhesitated to enforce the capital laws as written. See,\ne.g., C. Collier, supra, 76 Conn. B.J. 19 n.42. In many\nadultery cases, for example, courts avoided imposing\nthe ultimate punishment by finding the parties not guilty\nbut ‘‘highly suspicious,’’ and thus imposing a sentence\nof something other than death. Id.\n   Commencing with the Age of Enlightenment in the\nlate 1600s, and continuing for the next three plus centu-\nries, Connecticut’s courts and elected officials have\nsteadily pared back the number and types of crimes\ndeemed worthy of the ultimate punishment. See gener-\nally L. Goodheart, supra, cc. 2–7. By the early 1660s,\njuries, magistrates, and the governor himself all were\ntaking steps to, in essence, decapitalize crimes such as\nsodomy, blasphemy, and witchcraft, in keeping with\nthe public’s increasingly secular attitudes toward crime\nand punishment. See part I B 1 of this opinion. The last\nexecutions for bestiality and witchcraft were carried\nout in 1662 and 1663, respectively. L. Goodheart, supra,\npp. 33, 97. Adultery was delisted as a capital offense in\n1672, the same year Thomas Rood was executed for\nincest, and, since then, no one has been executed in\nConnecticut for any nonviolent sexual crime. See id.,\np. 31. The revised Connecticut laws of 1750 removed\nthe capital crimes of idolatry, man stealing, and various\noffenses of rebellious offspring from the books; id., pp.\n38, 45–49; and, two years later, the General Assembly\nblocked an execution for the crime of blasphemy, effec-\ntively decapitalizing that crime. Id., pp. 49, 68. The last\nexecution in Connecticut for infanticide, a charge under\nwhich married and unmarried mothers were treated\ndifferently,46 took place in 1753; id., p. 57; followed in\n1768 by the last hanging for burglary or any purely\neconomic crime. Id., pp. 65–66.\n   The colonialists’ commitment to Mosaic eye for an\neye justice had been grounded not only in their religious\nconvictions, but also in the fact that they lacked any\nviable alternatives to execution. See W. Holdsworth,\nsupra, pp. 356–57. That changed with the advent of\nmodern correctional facilities. Although one dozen cap-\nital crimes remained on the books through the end of\nthe eighteenth century, after Newgate opened in East\nGranby in 1773, no one was executed in Connecticut\nfor any crime other than homicide or rape. See L. Good-\nheart, supra, pp. 68, 75. Moreover, the last execution\n\ffor rape, in 1817; id., p. 94; was carried out just one\ndecade before the opening of the state prison in Weth-\nersfield; id., p. 101; which Goodheart characterizes as\nreflecting ‘‘more hopeful, even utopian, assumptions\nabout penology.’’ Id. With the ideal and means of achiev-\ning rehabilitation well established, in 1846, the legisla-\nture, for the first time, created a distinction between\nfirst and second degree murder to further limit the\napplication of the death penalty. Id., pp. 104–105. One\ncentury later, ‘‘[i]n 1951, the legislature enacted a statute\nthat allowed the jury to recommend life imprisonment\nrather than death for individuals convicted of first\ndegree murder, making it even easier for the jury to\navoid imposing the death penalty. See Public Acts 1951,\nNo. 369.’’ State v. Ross, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Berdon,\nJ., dissenting in part).\n   Connecticut’s steadily waning commitment to capital\npunishment also has been evidenced in the narrowing\nrange of offenders who have been subject to the ulti-\nmate punishment. No female has been executed in the\nstate since 1786, and no male under the age of eighteen\nat the time of the offense since 1904. See L. Goodheart,\nsupra, pp. 81–82, 136. Indeed, our legislature has ‘‘acted\nahead of the United States Supreme Court’’; State v.\nRizzo, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; in prohibiting the execu-\ntion of persons with intellectual disabilities; Public Acts\n1973, No. 73-137, § 4; of offenders who committed their\ncapital crimes when they were under eighteen; Public\nActs 1973, No. 73-137, § 4; and for any crime not involv-\ning the death of a victim. State v. Rizzo, 303 Conn.\nsupra, 189.\n   Although the past 380 years have witnessed an ongo-\ning decline in our state’s commitment to the death pen-\nalty as a legitimate form of punishment, it is noteworthy\nthat Connecticut’s two constitutions, adopted in 1818\nand 1965, were drafted during periods of particularly\ndramatic change. As we previously discussed, the late\neighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were charac-\nterized by penological reform, an emerging commit-\nment to human rights, and the first widespread public\nquestioning of the moral legitimacy of capital punish-\nment in Connecticut. See L. Goodheart, supra, pp. 69–\n70. Throughout the first half of 1786, the New Haven\nGazette had reprinted Cesare Beccaria’s entire 1764\ntreatise ‘‘On Crimes and Punishments,’’ a seminal\nEnlightenment era work that condemned torture and\nthe death penalty, and that led to widespread ques-\ntioning of the latter throughout Europe and the United\nStates. See id., pp. 67–70. The impact of Beccaria’s pro-\ngressive approach to penology may be seen in the case\nof Henry Wilson, a convicted rapist whose death sen-\ntence the General Assembly commuted in 1822. See id.,\npp. 96–97. Goodheart implies that the decision reflected\nthe fact that neighboring states, such as Rhode Island,\nalready had decapitalized that crime. See id., p. 97.\n\f   One hundred and fifty years later, when Connecticut\nadopted the 1965 constitution, there was an ‘‘unofficial\nmoratorium’’ on the death penalty in the state. Id., p.\n196. The last execution in the state had taken place in\n1960, and that only after the condemned man, Joseph\nTaborsky, ‘‘volunteered to die . . . .’’ Id., p. 193. Good-\nheart attributes the unofficial moratorium that began\nin the early 1960s to a myriad of factors: the expansion\nof defendants’ federal constitutional rights; declining\npopular support for the death penalty; opposition from\norganized religion, which originally had championed\ncapital punishment in Connecticut; and research indi-\ncating that, since 1930, ‘‘the death penalty [had fallen]\ninordinately on those at the bottom of society,’’ includ-\ning the poor, uneducated, and mentally disabled. Id.,\np. 202.\n   Another Connecticut execution would not occur until\nforty-five years later, in 2005, when Ross, like Taborsky,\nwaived his right to further appeals and habeas remedies.\nId., pp. 228, 230–31, 244–46. No capital sentences have\nbeen carried out in the decade since Ross was executed.\nOver the past fifty-five years, then, during which time\nthousands of murders have been committed in the state,\nour criminal justice system has conducted but a single\nexecution, and that only after the condemned man all\nbut forced the state to carry out his sentence. See id.,\npp. 230–31. The eleven men currently on death row in\nConnecticut are, at the least, many years, and most\nlikely decades, away from exhausting all of their state\nand federal appeals and habeas remedies. Even if the\nlegislature never had enacted P.A. 12-5, if past is pro-\nlogue, there simply is no reason to believe that any\nConnecticut executions would be carried out in the\nforeseeable future.\n   As Justice Berdon observed in his dissent in Ross,\nthis ‘‘whole state history demonstrates a reluctance to\nimpose the death penalty.’’ State v. Ross, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Berdon, J., dissenting in part). ‘‘[O]ur early\ncapital laws were seldom enforced, and, indeed, the\ncases in which capital punishment has been inflicted\nhave been exceedingly rare, some counties hardly hav-\ning known an execution.’’ (Internal quotation marks\nomitted.) Id., 303 (Berdon, J., dissenting in part). ‘‘There\nhave been, it is believed, within the last [220] years,\nfewer executions in Connecticut for crime, than in any\nother state of equal size in the world. The records of\nour courts have scarcely the stain of blood upon them\n. . . .’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.\n  Connecticut’s historical ambivalence toward the\ndeath penalty also has manifested in persistent efforts\nto abolish capital punishment. As we previously dis-\ncussed, the first serious organized opposition to the\ndeath penalty emerged in the early nineteenth century,\nand, by the mid-1800s, two governors and a majority\nof the state Senate had signed petitions for its repeal.\n\fL. Goodheart, supra, pp. 130–31. Abolition efforts per-\nsisted throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centu-\nries. See id., pp. 163–64, 178, 191, 195. In 2009, the\nGeneral Assembly passed P.A. 09-107, which would\nhave repealed the death penalty for crimes committed\nafter the passage of that act. See State v. Rizzo, supra,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Governor Rell vetoed P.A. 09-107, how-\never, and the legislature did not muster the two thirds\nvote necessary to override the governor’s veto. Id. Simi-\nlar legislation was introduced in 2011, which advanced\nthrough the Judiciary Committee but failed to achieve\na full vote in either the House or the Senate. See id.,\n199. Finally, on April 25, 2012, Governor Malloy signed\nP.A. 12-5, which abolished the death penalty for all\ncrimes committed on or after that date. Connecticut’s\nhistory, then, evinces a steady, inexorable devolution\nin the popularity and legitimacy of the death penalty,\nculminating in its prospective abolition in 2012.\n                             B\n                 Legislative Enactments\n   With respect to the second indicator of our evolving\nstandards of decency, both this court and the United\nStates Supreme Court have stated that ‘‘the clearest\nand most reliable objective evidence of contemporary\nvalues is the legislation enacted by the country’s legisla-\ntures.’’47 (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

We last examined the constitu-\ntionality of the death penalty in Rizzo II. See State\nv. Rizzo, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">–201. At that time, we\nrecognized that, during the preceding decade, (1) the\nUnited States Supreme Court had imposed additional\nrestrictions on the range of offenses and offenders con-\nstitutionally subject to capital punishment; id., 188; (2)\nseveral additional sister states had abolished the death\npenalty; id., 190; and (3) the number of death sentences\nimposed and executions carried out in the United States\nhad continued to decline. Id., 192–93. Nevertheless, we\nconcluded ‘‘that, as long as there remains powerful evi-\ndence of strong public support for the death penalty in\nthe form of long-standing laws enacted by the democrat-\nically elected representatives of this state and other\njurisdictions within the United States, we will not\nattempt to discern a contrary view of the public will,\nor to answer complex policy questions best answered\nby the legislative process . . . .’’ Id., 198.\n   Public Act 12-5 pulled that linchpin out of our deci-\nsion in Rizzo II. For the first time in our state’s history,\nthe governor and a majority of both legislative chambers\nhave now rejected state sanctioned killing and agreed\nthat life imprisonment without the possibility of release\nis a just and adequate punishment for even the most\nhorrific crimes. For any future crimes, the death penalty\nhas been removed from the list of acceptable punish-\nments that may be imposed in accordance with law.\n\f   Public Act 12-5 thus represents the terminus of the\nfour century long devolution of the death penalty in\nConnecticut. Although the prospective nature of P.A.\n12-5 reflects the intent of the legislature that capital\npunishment shall die with a whimper, not with a bang,\nits death knell has been rung nonetheless. Our elected\nrepresentatives have determined that the machinery of\ndeath48 is irreparable or, at the least, unbecoming to a\ncivilized modern state. As a ranking member of the\nJudiciary Committee recognized in 2012, ‘‘this law is the\nbest and most recent indication of evolving standards in\nour society of human decency.’’49 55 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 2012\nSess., p. 574, remarks of Senator John A. Kissel. The\nprospective abolition of the death penalty thus provides\nstrong support for the conclusion that capital punish-\nment no longer comports with contemporary standards\nof decency and, therefore, constitutes cruel and\nunusual punishment.\n   In her dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Rogers takes\nissue with the conclusion that the prospective repeal\nof the death penalty indicates that capital punishment\nno longer comports with our state’s evolving standards\nof decency. She argues that, as a matter of common\nsense, legislators would not have voted to retain capital\npunishment on a retroactive basis if they had believed\nsuch punishment to be immoral, indecent, or unneces-\nsary. Rather, she speculates that ‘‘the reason for the\nprospective repeal was not that a majority of legislators\nfound the death penalty morally repugnant even for the\nworst crimes, or that they found life imprisonment an\nadequate substitute for the death penalty, but that they\nhad determined that the death penalty simply had\nbecome impracticable.’’ Text accompanying footnote\n19 of Chief Justice Rogers’ dissenting opinion. The most\nreasonable interpretation of P.A. 12-5, Chief Justice\nRogers posits, is that the legislature continues to believe\nthat death is the appropriate punishment for certain\ncrimes but that, for financial and other pragmatic rea-\nsons, our elected representatives were forced to accept\na less severe form of punishment for the future.\n   We begin by observing that the United States\nSupreme Court, in Atkins v. Virginia, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, considered and rejected Chief Justice Rogers’ argu-\nment that a prospective only repeal of a punishment\ndoes not indicate that the punishment no longer com-\nports with society’s evolving values. See id., 313–16\n(recognizing emergence of national consensus against\nexecuting intellectually disabled, based on decisions of\neighteen states to amend their death penalty statutes\nto exempt such persons from capital punishment, even\nthough majority of those states had done so prospec-\ntively only); see also id., 342–43 (Scalia, J., dissenting)\n(criticizing majority for counting among those jurisdic-\ntions that no longer permitted execution of intellectu-\nally disabled eleven states that had abolished practice\n\fonly prospectively). Similarly, in Fleming v. Zant,\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1387806\"><a href=\"/opinion/1387806/fleming-v-zant/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the Supreme Court of Georgia con-\ncluded that a statute that prohibited the death penalty\nfor mentally disabled individuals on a prospective only\nbasis nevertheless evidenced an evolving societal con-\nsensus that the execution of such individuals was inap-\npropriate. See id., 690 and n.3. Accordingly, that court\nconcluded that execution of mentally disabled individu-\nals sentenced prior to the effective date of the Georgia\nstatute would be cruel and unusual punishment, in vio-\nlation of the Georgia constitution. Id., 690; see also\nVan Tran v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060419\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060419/van-tran-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 805 (Tenn. 2001)\n(concluding that statute prohibiting execution of men-\ntally disabled offenders was not intended to apply retro-\nactively but also concluding, under Tennessee consti-\ntution, in light of Fleming, that statute evidenced evolv-\ning consensus that carrying out any such executions\nwould be cruel and unusual).\n   More importantly, the voluminous legislative history\nof P.A. 12-5 simply does not bear out Chief Justice\nRogers’ interpretation of that act. During the legislative\ndebates, of the three dozen senators and representa-\ntives who spoke in favor of P.A. 12-5, nearly every legis-\nlator stated that he or she had come to oppose capital\npunishment as a matter of conscience or principle. Not-\nwithstanding the solely prospective application of P.A.\n12-5, numerous legislators declared that they categori-\ncally opposed state sanctioned killing or, in a few cases,\nthat they had concluded that life imprisonment without\nthe possibility of release is a more appropriate punish-\nment for capital felons.50 They cited a range of princi-\npled objections to the death penalty. Many found\nunacceptable the possibility that the state might mistak-\nenly execute an innocent person.51 Others condemned\ncapital punishment as incurably arbitrary and discrimi-\nnatory,52 or came to believe that death sentences retrau-\nmatize the families of murder victims.53 In his own\nremarks, one of the cochairmen of the Judiciary Com-\nmittee left little doubt as to the primary rationale for\nthe legislation: ‘‘This was a matter of conscience for\nme and I think it’s a matter of conscience for everyone\nin this body, proponents and opponents alike. I want\nto make that very clear.’’ 55 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 2012 Sess.,\npp. 791–92, remarks of Senator Eric D. Coleman.\nIndeed, many of the senators and representatives who\nopposed P.A. 12-5 acknowledged that its supporters\nvoted out of a conscientious and moral rejection of\ncapital punishment.54\n  Notably, although Chief Justice Rogers repeatedly\nchides the majority for failing to afford adequate defer-\nence to the legislative process, she herself is dismissive\nof legislators’ own characterizations of their votes,\nfavoring instead a narrative that is contradicted by the\nlegislative record. It is certainly true, as Chief Justice\nRogers emphasizes, that some proponents of the repeal\nalso expressed concerns over monetary or practical\n\fchallenges facing our state’s capital punishment system.\nThe fact that supporters voted to abolish capital punish-\nment for both moral and practical reasons, however,\nin no way demonstrates that the death penalty contin-\nues to comport with contemporary standards of\ndecency in Connecticut. An indecent punishment is no\nless indecent for the fact that it is also costly and inef-\nfectual.\n   To our knowledge, not a single legislator has publicly\nindicated that the decision to repeal the death penalty\nprospectively while retaining it for those who offended\nprior to April 25, 2012, embodied the sort of grand\nfinancial and pragmatic agreement suggested by Chief\nJustice Rogers. In fact, comments by Senator Kissel, a\nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, directly\nrefute Chief Justice Rogers’ theory that the legislative\nhistory of the act could support such an interpretation:\n‘‘[T]his isn’t being driven by cost savings. There [is]\n. . . ample testimony, year in and year out, that say[s]\nwe for moral, philosophical, religious reasons, because\nit doesn’t deter crime and all these other factors, say[s]\nthat people stridently oppose this penalty in Connecti-\ncut. People will stand up on the floor of the House and\nthe floor of the [Senate] and say, if we had a bill in\nfront of us with complete abolition, I’d support it, but for\npolitical reasons or expediency or for whatever reason,\nthat’s not the bill the Judiciary Committee gave us. But\nbecause this gets us one step closer to full abolition,\nI’m going to support this at this time.’’55 Conn. Joint\nStanding Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 9, 2012\nSess., pp. 2766–67. Ultimately, of the three dozen legisla-\ntors who spoke in favor of P.A. 12-5 during the legisla-\ntive hearings and debates, only two indicated that they\npersonally supported the repeal primarily for prag-\nmatic reasons.56\n   Why, then, did a legislature committed to abolishing\nthe death penalty vote to retain it for the handful of\ninmates already on death row? It is clear from the legis-\nlative history of P.A. 12-5, as well as the record of\nother recent attempts to abolish capital punishment in\nConnecticut, that, as Senator Kissel indicated, the vast\nmajority of those legislators who voted for P.A. 12-5\nwould have supported a full repeal but were forced at\nthat time to accept half a loaf because there were not\nenough votes to pass a full repeal. With regard to the\nhandful of legislators whose support for a repeal was\ncontingent on retaining the death penalty for previous\ncapital felons, the legislative record strongly suggests\nthat they insisted on a prospective only repeal not for\nthe pragmatic and financial reasons offered by Chief\nJustice Rogers but, rather, for one of two reasons.\n  First, some legislators opposed retroactive abolition\nout of a principled belief that the state had made a\ncommitment to families of victims murdered before the\npassage of P.A 12-5 that the state would pursue the\n\fdeath penalty in those cases. Those legislators felt that\nthe state was morally obliged to honor that prior com-\nmitment, even if it had foresworn capital punishment\ngoing forward.57 For such legislators, retaining the death\npenalty on a retroactive basis represented the lesser of\ntwo evils. Indeed, at least one legislator speculated that\nan unwillingness to ‘‘up end’’ victims’ expectations was\nthe primary rationale for enacting a prospective only\nrepeal.58 55 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 2012 Sess., p. 720, remarks\nof Senator Andrew W. Roraback; see also K. Barry,\n‘‘From Wolves, Lambs (Part II): The Fourteenth Amend-\nment Case for Gradual Abolition of the Death Penalty,’’\n35 Cardozo L. Rev. 1829, 1837 (2014) (‘‘[p]rospective-\nonly repeal grants the ‘victim’s mother’ her pound of\nflesh and then bids her adieu’’). Indeed, at oral argument\nbefore this court, the state acknowledged that the legis-\nlature indicated that ‘‘keeping a promise to the victims’’\nwas one of the primary rationales for enacting a pro-\nspective only repeal.\n   For other legislators, support for a prospective only\nrepeal appears to have reflected a calculation that they\ncould accommodate the public demand that certain\nnotorious inmates remain on death row; see part III C\nof this opinion; with little concern that those death\nsentences ever would be carried out.59 During the\ndebates over P.A. 12-5, many legislators were of the\nopinion that, once the death penalty had been prospec-\ntively abolished, the official policy of the state would\nthen disapprove capital punishment, and it would,\ntherefore, become unconstitutional to execute offend-\ners whose crimes were committed prior to the repeal.\nIt was widely predicted that the individuals already on\ndeath row would immediately seek appellate or habeas\nrelief upon passage of a prospective repeal, and that\nthis court would bar all future executions.60 Although\nnot all legislators were in agreement on this point, it is\nnoteworthy that Chief State’s Attorney Kane, who heads\nthe Division of Criminal Justice and represents the state\nin this matter, has himself publicly taken the position\nthat, following a prospective repeal, any efforts to exe-\ncute those already on death row would be unlikely to\npass constitutional muster. See Conn. Joint Standing\nCommittee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 8, 2012 Sess., pp.\n2601–2602 (‘‘I can’t imagine how we would be executing\nsomebody who’s on death row today’’); id., pp. 2630–35\n(indicating that, after prospective repeal, capital punish-\nment would fail to comport with evolving standards of\ndecency in Connecticut).61\n   Some legislators, then, may have seen a prospective\nrepeal as an opportunity to retain the support of constit-\nuents committed to the execution of particular resi-\ndents of death row, while leaving to this court the task of\nabolishing capital punishment retroactively. Professor\nKevin Barry, on whose opinions Chief Justice Rogers\nrepeatedly relies, has argued that adoption of a prospec-\ntive only repeal represented precisely this sort of ‘‘stra-\n\ftegic’’ decision on the part of legislators ‘‘to discard the\ndeath penalty going forward . . . while punting the\nhard political decisions about what to do with those\non death row . . . .’’ K. Barry, supra, 35 Cardozo L.\nRev. 1836; see also id., 1834 (noting that abolitionists\nadopted similar strategy of gradual abolition in move-\nment to end slavery); id., 1836 (prospective only repeal\nis politically viable because it removes so-called ‘‘ ‘vic-\ntim’s mother’ ’’ effect). We do not consider such action\nto evidence legislative endorsement of the death penalty\nas a fitting and acceptable means of punishment in\nmodern Connecticut.62\n   Lastly, we note that, if the primary concern of the\nlegislature had been with the workability of the death\npenalty, as Chief Justice Rogers contends, then the leg-\nislature certainly could have implemented measures,\nshort of abolition, aimed at removing some of the\nimpediments in the state’s capital punishment scheme.63\nThat option was proposed on several occasions during\nthe hearings and debates on P.A. 12-5 but ultimately\nrejected.64 The only plausible reading of the legislative\nhistory, then, is that the legislature made a principled\ndetermination that capital punishment should no longer\nbe the policy of Connecticut.\n   Turning our attention to the other elected branch of\ngovernment, we also recognize that the meaning of a\nstatute is revealed not only in the intent of the legislators\nwho draft and enact it, but also in the aspirations of\nthe governor who signs it. As Chief Justice Rogers,\nwriting for the court in Rizzo II, recently explained:\n‘‘The governor, like our legislators, is an elected repre-\nsentative of the people of the state. Additionally, execu-\ntive approval . . . of legislation is an integral part of\nthe legislative process . . . and it is axiomatic that\nwhen the governor exercises this power, he or she is\nacting in a substantive legislative role. . . . Thus . . .\na governor’s [signing statement issued upon] approval\nof legislation may provide evidence of the motivations\nunderlying that legislation . . . .’’ (Citations omitted.)\nState v. Rizzo, supra, 303 Conn. 199–200. In fact, Chief\nJustice Rogers observed in this very context that ‘‘it may\nbe, at some times, on some subjects, that the [governor]\nelected by all the people is rather more representative\nof them all than are the members of either body of\nthe [l]egislature whose constituencies are local and not\n[statewide] . . . .’’ (Emphasis added; internal quota-\ntion marks omitted.) Id., 201. In the present case, Gover-\nnor Malloy made clear, in signing P.A. 12-5, that his\ndecision to approve legislation abolishing the death pen-\nalty was a principled one: ‘‘Many of us who have advo-\ncated for this position over the years have said there\nis a moral component to our opposition to the death\npenalty. For me, that is certainly the case. . . .\n  ‘‘I [have come] to believe that doing away with the\ndeath penalty [is] the only way to ensure it [will] not\n\fbe unfairly imposed.’’65 Gov. Malloy on Signing Bill To\nRepeal Capital Punishment (April 25, 2012) (Gover-\nnor’s Statement).\n   In conclusion, although support for a legislative com-\npromise as significant and complex as Connecticut’s\nprospective abolition of the death penalty is bound to\narise from and reflect a range of sentiments and con-\ncerns, the best evidence of legislative intent available\nto us strongly suggests that both of the elected branches\nwere motivated in no small part by a principled belief\nthat state sanctioned executions are no longer a neces-\nsary or appropriate form of punishment, even for the\nmost heinous crimes.\n                            C\n                    Current Practice\n   ‘‘Although the clearest and most reliable objective\nevidence of contemporary values is the legislation\nenacted by the country’s legislatures . . . in assessing\nwhether a punishment is constitutionally sound, it also\nis appropriate for us to consider what is occurring in\nactual practice.’’ (Citation omitted; internal quotation\nmarks omitted.)

Indeed,\nsince 1973, whereas juries in states such as Texas and\nFlorida have imposed death sentences at an average\nrate of approximately two per month, Connecticut\njuries on average have imposed a death sentence only\napproximately once every two years.66\n   Moreover, each of the capital sentences imposed in\nConnecticut has, in effect, become the equivalent of\nlife imprisonment. As we discussed, there has been an\nalmost complete moratorium on executions in the state\nsince 1960. Connecticut has put only one offender to\ndeath over the past fifty-five years, and that was a serial\nkiller who believed that he deserved to die and volunta-\nrily waived his right to further appeals and habeas reme-\ndies. L. Goodheart, supra, pp. 228, 230–31, 244–46. Even\nthen, it took the state more than two decades to carry\nout his sentence. See id., p. 248. Nor is there even the\nremotest likelihood that any of the inmates currently\non death row in Connecticut will exhaust their federal\nand state appeals and habeas remedies any time in the\nforeseeable future.\n   The United States Supreme Court also has recognized\nthat the willingness or reluctance of prosecutors to seek\na particular punishment constitutes further objective\nevidence of whether society considers that punishment\nto be excessive or disproportionate.

Nevertheless, our review of\nthe five objective indicia that have been deemed rele-\nvant under both the federal and state constitutions com-\npels the conclusion that, following the enactment of\nP.A. 12-5, Connecticut’s capital punishment scheme no\nlonger comports with our state’s contemporary stan-\ndards of decency.88 It therefore offends the state consti-\ntutional prohibition against excessive and dispropor-\ntionate punishment.89\n                           III\n       THE DEATH PENALTY IS DEVOID OF\n        ANY LEGITIMATE PENOLOGICAL\n               JUSTIFICATIONS\n  As the constitution requires, we next consider\nwhether, on the basis of our independent review of\nthe available evidence, executing those individuals who\n\fcommitted capital felonies prior to the enactment of\nP.A. 12-5 would serve any legitimate penological pur-\npose.

We also have recognized,\nhowever, that this assessment ‘‘is not exclusively the\ndomain of the legislature, and that this court has an\nindependent duty to determine that the penalty remains\nconstitutionally viable as the sensibilities of our citizens\nevolve.’’ Id.; see also part IV C of this opinion. Deference\nto legislative assessments is least warranted, and judi-\ncial scrutiny must be especially exacting, when, as in\nthe present case, the policy judgments embodied in\nthe relevant legislation are ambiguous.91 Upon close\nconsideration of the arguments and the available\nresearch, and particularly in light of the legislature’s\ndecision to abolish capital punishment for all future\ncrimes, we conclude that the death penalty no longer\nmeasurably contributes to the penological goals of\ndeterrence or retribution. We consider each in turn.\n                             A\n                       Deterrence\n   Turning first to deterrence, we observe that it is clear\nthat, with the passage of P.A. 12-5, any deterrent value\nthe death penalty may have had no longer exists. As\nJustice Harper explained in his dissent in Santiago I:\n‘‘The ultimate test of this deterrence claim is whether\nthe state, by executing some of its citizens, better\nachieves the unquestionably legitimate goal of discour-\naging others from committing similar crimes. As a gen-\neral matter, the empirical evidence regarding deter-\nrence is inconclusive. Following the abolition of the\ndeath penalty for all future offenses committed in Con-\nnecticut, however, it is possible to determine the exact\nnumber of potential crimes that will be deterred by\nexecuting the defendant in this case. That number is\nzero.’’ (Emphasis omitted; footnote omitted.) State v.\nSantiago, supra, 305 Conn. 320–21 (Harper, J., concur-\nring in part and dissenting in part).\n  In her dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Rogers rejects\nJustice Harper’s commonsense conclusion that once\nthe legislature enacts a high profile repeal of a punish-\nment, that punishment no longer serves as a deterrent.\nRather, she contends, by maintaining capital punish-\nment for offenders sentenced to death before the enact-\nment of P.A. 12-5, the state can send a ‘‘message’’ to\n\fpotential offenders that the laws are stable and will be\nenforced as written. This, she believes, can strengthen\nthe deterrent force of all penal laws.92\n  We very much doubt that the citizens of Connecticut,\nlearning that the death penalty has been abolished, will\nsomehow infer that they can now rape, pillage, and\nexceed the speed limits with impunity. In fact, during\nthe legislative hearings on P.A. 12-5, a member of the\nJudiciary Committee rejected the suggestion that the\nlegislature was adopting a prospective only repeal ‘‘to\nconvince people that the government is really serious\nabout carrying out its penalties.’’ Conn. Joint Standing\nCommittee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 9, 2012 Sess., pp.\n2781–82, remarks of Representative Arthur J. O’Neill\n(responding to law student who proposed that solely\nprospective repeal could be justified on basis of\ndeterrence).\n   In any event, the horse that Chief Justice Rogers\nseeks to corral has long since left the barn. Of the more\nthan 4000 individuals who have committed murder in\nConnecticut since the death penalty was reinstated four\ndecades ago, only one has been executed, and then only\nafter he demanded that the state carry out his death\nsentence. L. Goodheart, supra, pp. 228, 230–31. The\noverwhelming majority of killers are not sentenced to\ndeath. As we discuss more fully hereinafter, those who\nare sentenced to death routinely spend decades on\ndeath row, and there is every reason to believe that\nthey would die there, outlived by their various appeals\nand habeas petitions. Chief Justice Rogers fails to\nexplain how it is that this system of unexecuted capital\npunishment promotes a respect for the law or leads our\ncitizens to expect that the state will carry out prescribed\npunishments as written.\n   Even if the legislature had not prospectively abol-\nished the death penalty, it would appear that capital\npunishment, as administered in Connecticut in the post-\nFurman era, has failed to demonstrate a sufficient\ndeterrent effect to justify continued state imposed kill-\ning. Although some studies have purported to document\na deterrent effect,93 ‘‘the majority of social science\nresearch on the issue concludes that the death penalty\nhas no effect on the homicide rate.’’94 D. Beschle, ‘‘Why\nDo People Support Capital Punishment? The Death Pen-\nalty as Community Ritual,’’ </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 765, 768\n(2001). A principal reason for this failure of deterrence\nappears to be the substantial delays involved in actually\ncarrying out a sentence of death. The number of poten-\ntial state and federal postconviction remedies available,\nthe range and complexity of legal issues involved in\ncapital appeals, and the multiple stages of review mean\nthat at least one decade typically passes from capital\ncrime to execution, and delays of twenty years or more\nare not at all uncommon. See, e.g., A. Kozinski & S.\nGallagher, ‘‘Death: The Ultimate Run-On Sentence,’’ 46\n\fCase W. Res. L. Rev. 1, 10–11, 17 (1995). The delays,\nmoreover, appear to be getting longer. Of the thirty-\nfive offenders executed in the United States in 2014,\nonly one had been on death row for less than one\ndecade, and the average time from sentencing to execu-\ntion exceeded seventeen years.95 The situation is no\ndifferent in Connecticut. Of the eight men sentenced\nto death in the state between 1987 and 2007 whose\nsentences were not later overturned, only one has been\nexecuted. Ross was executed by lethal injection in 2005,\neighteen years after sentencing, and then only after\nhe voluntarily abandoned further legal challenges. L.\nGoodheart, supra, pp. 228, 230–31, 246. Of the eleven\nmen currently on death row in Connecticut, one has\nbeen awaiting execution for twenty-five years, two oth-\ners for nearly that long, and one for twenty years.\n   ‘‘The deterrent value of any punishment is, of course,\nrelated to the promptness with which it is inflicted.’’\nColeman v.

Even prior to\nthe enactment of P.A. 12-5, the fact that one who com-\nmits the most heinous of crimes can expect to spend\ndecades in prison prior to any execution suggests that\ncapital punishment promises little if any deterrence\nover and above life imprisonment.96 The legislature\nheard extensive expert testimony to this effect when\nconsidering P.A. 12-5, and numerous legislators cited\nthe lack of a deterrent effect as a justification for their\ndecision to abolish the death penalty.97 Indeed, Chief\nState’s Attorney Kane, who represents the state in this\nand all other death penalty cases, acknowledged in pub-\nlic testimony that there is insufficient evidence to con-\nclude that capital punishment deters crime.

Rev. 25.\n   Our legislature’s adoption of P.A. 12-5 underscores\nthis state’s historical and profound ambivalence with\nrespect to the death penalty, and is further reason to\nbelieve that, even if we were to sustain its constitution-\nality, the delays in the administration of our capital\nsentencing scheme would not abate. On the contrary,\nas we previously noted, no state or nation ever has\nexecuted someone after a prospective only repeal of\nthe death penalty. See, e.g., State v. Santiago, Conn.\nSupreme Court Records & Briefs, April Term, 2013,\nAmicus Brief of legal historians and scholars p. 1.\nWhether death has been belayed by executive clemency\nor simple public aversion, it universally has been con-\nsidered unseemly to carry out an execution after the\npeople’s representatives have expressed their will that\nthe sentence of death no longer shall be imposed.\nAccordingly, Connecticut’s prospective repeal of capi-\ntal punishment provides strong reason to believe that\nthose persons currently on death row never will be\nexecuted. In any event, in light of the passage of P.A.\n12-5, and in the absence of any indication that the death\npenalty, as administered in this state, has forestalled\nthe commission of capital crimes, it is apparent that\ncapital punishment no longer serves any meaningful\ndeterrent function in Connecticut.98\n                            B\n                       Retribution\n\f  The second commonly articulated rationale for the\ndeath penalty is that, regardless of whether capital pun-\nishment provides any tangible benefits such as deter-\nrence, incapacitation, or rehabilitation, it is a justified\nmoral response to a heinous crime such as the one\ncommitted by the defendant in the present case. This\nretributive function of the criminal law has been\nexpressed in varying terms: giving the offender his ‘‘just\ndeserts’’; providing a sense of restoration and closure\nto victims and their families; expressing society’s out-\nrage at the crime and denunciation of the perpetrator;\nand, more philosophically, restoring balance to the\nmoral order.\n   Both this court and the federal courts have recog-\nnized that, as society has evolved and matured, the\nerstwhile importance of retribution as a goal of and\njustification for criminal sanctions has waned.

Regardless of one’s general beliefs about the\nmorality of the death penalty, however, there are four\nreasons why capital punishment, as administered in\nConnecticut, simply does not serve a meaningful retrib-\nutive purpose.\n                            1\n\f                 Legislative Judgments\n   First, as we previously discussed; see part II B of this\nopinion; the passage of P.A. 12-5 reflects a legislative\njudgment that capital punishment no longer serves a\nnecessary moral function in our state. The retributive\nrationale for capital punishment always has been that\nthe worst of the worst, those who commit especially\nheinous crimes, have thereby cut themselves off from\nthe human community.

Simmons, supra,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (‘‘[c]apital punishment must be limited to\nthose offenders who commit a narrow category of the\nmost serious crimes and whose extreme culpability\nmakes them the most deserving of execution’’ [internal\nquotation marks omitted]). In other words, execution\nis the ultimate form of ostracism. ‘‘[T]he decision that\ncapital punishment may be the appropriate sanction in\n[such] extreme cases is an expression of the communi-\nty’s belief that certain crimes are themselves so grievous\nan affront to humanity that the only adequate response\nmay be the penalty of death.’’ (Emphasis added.)

In other\nwords, to whatever limited extent capital punishment\nmay still further these retributive purposes, the legisla-\nture has determined that the death penalty is no longer\nnecessary to achieve them.

Governor\nRyan concluded that ‘‘[o]ur capital system is haunted\nby the demon of error . . . .’’ (Internal quotation marks\nomitted.) Id. The possibility of executing an innocent\nperson was also a principal concern voiced by both of\nConnecticut’s elected branches in their support of P.A.\n12-5.100 We do not suggest that anyone currently on\ndeath row in Connecticut has a potentially viable claim\nof actual innocence.101 In concluding that the death pen-\nalty is unconstitutional, however, we recognize that the\nlegal and moral legitimacy of any future executions\nwould be undermined by the ever present risk that an\ninnocent person will be wrongly executed.102\n                            4\n                    Caprice and Bias\n   The fourth reason that our state’s capital punishment\nsystem fails to achieve its retributive goals is that the\nselection of which offenders live and which offenders\ndie appears to be inescapably tainted by caprice and\nbias. ‘‘[T]he heart of the retribution rationale is that a\ncriminal sentence must be directly related to the per-\nsonal culpability of the criminal offender.’’ (Internal\nquotation marks omitted.)

In other words, the death penalty must be\nequally available for similarly culpable offenders if a\ncapital sentencing scheme is to fulfill a valid retributive\npurpose. To the extent that the ultimate punishment is\nimposed on an offender on the basis of impermissible\nconsiderations such as his, or his victim’s, race, eth-\nnicity, or socio-economic status, rather than the severity\nof his crime, his execution does not restore but, rather,\ntarnishes the moral order. See generally O. Londono,\n‘‘A Retributive Critique of Racial Bias and Arbitrariness\nin Capital Punishment,’’ 44 J. Soc. Phil. 95 (2013); D.\nMcDermott, ‘‘A Retributivist Argument against Capital\nPunishment,’’ 32 J. Soc. Phil. 317 (2001); S. Nathanson,\n‘‘Does It Matter if the Death Penalty Is Arbitrarily\nAdministered?,’’ 14 Phil. & Pub. Aff. 149 (1985).\n  The problem is that, as we previously noted, there is\nan inherent conflict in the requirements that the eighth\namendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment,\nas interpreted by the United States Supreme Court,\nimposes on any capital sentencing scheme. On the one\nhand, Furman and its progeny stand for the proposition\nthat any capital punishment statute, to avoid arbitrari-\nness and pass constitutional muster, must cabin the\ndiscretion of prosecutors, judges, and juries by provid-\ning clear guidelines as to what specific types of crimes\nare eligible for the punishment of death. In the context\nof capital murder—the sole remaining crime against an\nindividual for which capital punishment may be\nimposed under the eighth amendment—that require-\nment has been interpreted to mean that statutes must\n\fidentify specific aggravating factors that the fact finder\nmust find before imposing the death penalty. See Tui-\nlaepa v. California, supra, 512 U.S. 971–73. The ultimate\npunishment must be reserved for the very worst offend-\ners, and may not be ‘‘wantonly [or] . . . freakishly\nimposed.’’ Furman v.

See\nTuilaepa v. California, supra, 972–73. In other words,\nthe discretion of the jury to accord the capital defendant\nmercy may not be confined or restricted in any way.103\n   The question is whether this individualized sentenc-\ning requirement inevitably allows in through the back\ndoor the same sorts of caprice and freakishness that the\ncourt sought to exclude in Furman, or, worse, whether\nindividualized sentencing necessarily opens the door\nto racial and ethnic discrimination in capital sentenc-\ning.104 In other words, is it ever possible to eliminate\narbitrary and discriminatory application of capital pun-\nishment through a more precise and restrictive defini-\ntion of capital crimes if prosecutors always remain free\nnot to seek the death penalty for a particular defendant,\nand juries not to impose it, for any reason whatsoever?\nWe do not believe that it is.105\n   We begin by observing that the United States\nSupreme Court itself has expressed serious doubts as\nto whether its own commandments can be reconciled.\nIn Tuilaepa, the court recognized that ‘‘[t]he objectives\nof these two inquiries can be in some tension . . . .’’\nId., 973.

Maintaining the idea of a\ndeath sentence while [e]nsuring that it would in practice\nalmost never be imposed, the result necessarily is not\n\fmerely [that] death sentence[s] would be rarities but\nthat those rarities would occur wantonly and freakishly\nand hence, unconstitutionally.’’ (Internal quotation\nmarks omitted.) 16 S. Proc., Pt. 4, 1973 Sess., p. 1892.\n   After thoroughly reviewing the operation of Connecti-\ncut’s capital sentencing scheme over the past four\ndecades, we are persuaded that these critiques are well\nfounded and that the opportunity for the exercise of\nunfettered discretion at key decision points in the pro-\ncess has meant that the ultimate punishment has not\nbeen reserved for the worst of the worst offenders.\nThere is no doubt that our death row has counted among\nits residents the perpetrators of some of the most hei-\nnous crimes in Connecticut history. It is equally clear,\nhowever, that the process of selecting offenders for\nexecution has been both under inclusive and over inclu-\nsive. Many who commit truly horrific crimes are spared,\nwhereas certain defendants whose crimes are, by all\nobjective measures, less brutal are condemned to death.\nThe defendant in the present case is, perhaps, the clear-\nest example. He shot the sole victim, an adult white\nmale, in his sleep, killing him instantly. The defendant\nhad no prior criminal convictions. And yet, of the seven-\nteen offenders convicted of committing capital eligible\nmurders for hire in the state since 1973, Eduardo Santi-\nago was the only one sentenced to death.106 To the\nextent that the population of death row has been chosen\non grounds other than the atrocity of the offenders’\ncrimes, this would undermine all confidence that capital\npunishment, as applied, is morally proportionate and\nserves a legitimate retributive function in Connecti-\ncut.107\n                             C\n                        Vengeance\n   Finally, it bears emphasizing that, to the extent that\nthe statutory history of P.A. 12-5 reveals anything with\nrespect to the legislature’s purpose in prospectively\nabolishing the death penalty while retaining it for the\nhandful of individuals now on death row, it is that the\nprimary rationale for this dichotomy was neither deter-\nrence nor retribution but, rather, vengeance—the Hyde\nto retribution’s Jekyll. Vengeance, unlike retribution, is\npersonal in nature; it is motivated by emotion, and may\neven relish in the suffering of the offender. See R. Noz-\nick, Philosophical Explanations (1981) p. 367. Accord-\ningly, vengeance traditionally has not been considered\na constitutionally permissible justification for criminal\nsanctions. See Ford v.

In\nsuggesting that the legislators who voted in favor of a\nsolely prospective repeal of the death penalty were\nequally committed to executing the defendant in the\npresent case and other inmates on Connecticut’s death\nrow, Chief Justice Rogers ignores the overwhelming\nevidence that the perpetrators in the Cheshire case,\nJoshua Komisarjevsky and Steven Hayes, were the prin-\ncipal targets of the decision to retain the death penalty\nretroactively.108 There is certainly no question what\nmotivated one state senator, who opined that ‘‘ ‘[t]hey\nshould bypass the trial [in the Cheshire case] and take\nthat second animal and hang him by his penis from a\ntree out in the middle of Main Street . . . .’ ’’109\n   It has been suggested that it would be a morally\npermissible ‘‘sacrifice’’ for Connecticut to allow those\nmen currently on death row to be executed so as to\nhasten the abolition of capital punishment in other juris-\ndictions.

We can say, however,\nthat it would not be constitutionally permissible to exe-\ncute the defendant in the present case, and others simi-\nlarly situated, without any legitimate penological pur-\npose, merely to achieve the politically popular end of\nkilling two especially notorious inmates.\n                            D\n                       Conclusion\n   For all of these reasons, the death penalty no longer\nserves any legitimate penological goal in our state. As\nJudge Kozinski concludes, ‘‘we have little more than\nan illusion of a death penalty in this country. To be\nsure, we have capital trials; we have convictions and\ndeath sentences imposed; we have endless and mas-\nsively costly reviews by the state and federal courts;\nand we do have a small number of people executed\neach year. But the number of executions compared to\nthe number of people who have been sentenced to\ndeath is minuscule, and the gap is widening every year.\nWhatever purposes the death penalty is said to serve—\ndeterrence, retribution, assuaging the pain suffered by\nvictims’ families—these purposes are not served by the\nsystem as it now operates.’’ (Footnotes omitted.)

We therefore conclude that, following the enact-\nment of P.A. 12-5, capital punishment also violates arti-\ncle first, §§ 8 and 9, of the Connecticut constitution\nbecause it no longer serves any legitimate penologi-\ncal purpose.110\n                            IV\n    RESPONSE TO THE DISSENTING JUSTICES\n  Lastly, we take this opportunity to address briefly\ncertain general arguments that the dissenting justices\nhave raised. Although we recognize and respect that\ntheir opinions are grounded in a principled and com-\nmendable commitment to judicial restraint, we find\nthem to be unpersuasive and, in a few instances, some-\nwhat troubling.\n                             A\n         Whether the Questions Decided Are\n             Properly before the Court\n   We first address Chief Justice Rogers’ argument that\nsome of the issues, evidence, and arguments considered\nin this opinion are not properly before this court. Specif-\nically, she contends that (1) some of the arguments that\nwe consider in this opinion never were raised by the\ndefendant, (2) the parties were not afforded an adequate\nopportunity to brief the issues addressed in this opinion,\nand (3) the majority relies on research and statistics\nthat are not properly the subject of judicial notice. We\nconsider each argument in turn.\n                             1\n Arguments Allegedly Not Raised by the Defendant\n   Chief Justice Rogers first contends that we improp-\nerly have considered certain arguments that the defen-\ndant himself has not raised. For example, she contends\nthat the defendant did not adequately preserve the argu-\nments that (1) the death penalty is rarely imposed in\nConnecticut, (2) the death penalty has slowly fallen out\nof use in Connecticut, and (3) other states recently have\nabolished the death penalty, while respected profes-\nsional organizations, such as the American Law Insti-\ntute, no longer support its use. We are not persuaded\nby this contention.\n   We begin by noting that the defendant indisputably\npreserved the claim that, following the enactment of\nP.A. 12-5, the death penalty now offends the state consti-\ntution in that it (1) fails to comport with contemporary\nstandards of decency, and (2) is now devoid of any\nlegitimate penological value.111 We recognized as much\nin our initial decision in this case; see State v. Santiago,\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">–308 n.167; and, on reconsidera-\ntion, the defendant dedicates pages of discussion to\nthis claim in his supplemental briefs. Indeed, his argu-\nment on reconsideration begins with the statement that\n‘‘[P.A. 12-5] represents the considered judgment of our\n\flegislature and governor that the death penalty is no\nlonger consistent with standards of decency in Connect-\nicut and does not serve any valid penological objective.’’\nThat is precisely the issue that we have considered in\nparts II and III of this opinion.\n   Chief Justice Rogers’ objection, then, is merely that\nthe defendant did not brief the issue in sufficient depth,\nand, specifically, that he did not expressly address cer-\ntain facts and factors—the accuracy of which is not\nreasonably in dispute—on which we rely in this opinion.\nHer view appears to be that, even though a significant\nchange in the legal landscape, such as the prospective\nrepeal of the death penalty, may warrant a full review\nof whether that punishment remains consistent with\ncontemporary standards of decency, and even though\nthat analysis necessarily encompasses the consider-\nation of various factors and historical developments\nthat this court and other courts have considered in past\ncases involving challenges to the death penalty on other\ngrounds, we may take those factors into consideration\nin the present case only if the defendant fully briefs\neach of them anew. This makes little sense.\n  In the present case, the defendant, in his initial\nappeal, submitted an opening brief of nearly 300 pages,\nin which he raised more than twenty distinct legal\nclaims. He also submitted a 122 page reply brief, as\nwell as more than 2000 pages of appendices. Upon our\ngrant of reconsideration, he submitted approximately\n200 more pages of briefing and appendices, addressing\nnew legal claims. The state, of course, responded with\nmany hundreds of pages of its own briefing and\nappendices.\n  Rather than exhaustively brief every aspect of the\nquestion of whether capital punishment now offends\nthe state constitution, the defendant chose instead to\nfocus on the impact of the enactment of P.A. 12-5 on\nthat question, and to incorporate by reference the other\nfactors that this court has considered at length in previ-\nous capital appeals. The state, in rejecting the defen-\ndant’s constitutional claim, likewise relied primarily on\nreferences to our prior cases. We can only assume that\nthis choice represented a calculated decision, by both\nparties, that, with their briefs already taking up more\nthan a ream of paper, resources—both natural and judi-\ncial—would be better addressed to the novel issues\npresented by the defendant’s case, and that we had\nmore than sufficient resources at our disposal to allow\nus to fully review the present constitutionality of capital\npunishment in a thorough and comprehensive manner.\nThis decision was perfectly reasonable.\n  The approach that Chief Justice Rogers advocates\nwould force counsel representing defendants in capital\nappeals to make a Hobson’s choice. When, as in the\npresent case, this court previously has rejected a consti-\ntutional claim, counsel either would have to (1) forgo\n\fthat and related claims for all subsequent capital defen-\ndants, or (2) fully brief each aspect of the issue in each\ncapital appeal, repeatedly addressing every potential\nargument, legal theory, and constitutional fact that this\ncourt might find relevant or persuasive, on the mere\npossibility that we might agree that intervening develop-\nments warrant a fresh consideration of the issue or\npresent novel grounds for finding a constitutional viola-\ntion. If counsel followed the first path, we would be\nprecluded from ever revisiting important constitutional\nquestions, even those where, as in the case of cruel and\nunusual punishment, the legal standard itself envisions\nthat punishments once permissible may over time come\nto offend the constitution. If counsel followed the sec-\nond path, capital appeals, which are already deplorably\nprolonged, expensive, and resource intensive, would\ngrow even more so. Forcing such a choice would be\nboth unwise and unjust.\n   Rather, we believe that appellate counsel in the pre-\nsent appeal made a prudent and appropriate decision\nto raise, and thereby preserve, the constitutional claim;\nto submit thoughtful and informative supplemental\nbriefing to address those novel questions and key devel-\nopments for which we concluded that additional brief-\ning would be helpful; and, with respect to paths already\ntraveled, simply to direct our attention to prior cases\nin which potentially relevant factors have been more\nfully vetted.112 Under the particular circumstances of\nthis capital appeal, nothing more was required.\n  For the same reasons, it would be inappropriate to\narbitrarily restrict our analysis of the constitutionality\nof capital punishment to those facts and circumstances\nthat have been identified expressly by the parties. In\nfact, although we generally do not consider claims or\nissues that the parties themselves have not raised; see,\ne.g., Blumberg Associates Worldwide, Inc. v. Brown &\nBrown of Connecticut, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 142, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">840</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014); in cases too numerous to mention, we have\nconsidered arguments or factors pertaining to those\nclaims or issues that were not expressly identified by\nthe parties.

As\nChief Justice Rogers herself acknowledges, it is well\nestablished that, before ruling on the constitutionality\nof a challenged mode of punishment, a court must con-\nduct its own independent review to determine whether\nthat punishment remains suitable to the crime and con-\ntinues to serve any legitimate penological objective.113\nSee, e.g., State v. Rizzo, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; see also\nGraham v.

It would be difficult, if not\nimpossible, for us to fulfill our constitutional duty in\nthis regard if we were barred from considering basic\nfactual questions such as how frequently the punish-\nment is imposed or whether its ongoing use retains the\napproval of our sister states, legal scholars, and other\nsources of persuasive authority. We routinely look to\nsuch sources when deciding legal questions of first\nimpression—often with regrettably sparse assistance\nfrom the parties’ briefing—and we see no reason why\nthe scope of our review should be more fettered when\ndeciding significant constitutional questions. This is\nespecially true in capital cases, in which courts rou-\ntinely, and quite properly, provide accommodations not\nalways afforded in other, less compelling circum-\nstances. See State v. Cobb, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 763, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">663</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995) (‘‘the nature of the defendant’s claim\nof systemic racial bias, and the seriousness and finality\nof the death penalty, counsel against raising any undue\nprocedural barriers to review of such a claim’’).\n                            2\n               Opportunity for Briefing\n   Chief Justice Rogers next contends that it was\nimproper for the court to consider the issues that we\nhave decided without first affording the parties a full\nopportunity to brief them. We disagree. The truth is\nthat the parties did have the opportunity to brief the\nissue of whether the death penalty now violates the\nstate constitution. As we have explained, each party\nmade what we presume to be a calculated and reason-\nable decision to focus its argument on the legal conse-\nquences of the enactment of P.A. 12-5 and the novel\nquestions presented thereby, and, in essence, to incor-\nporate by reference our prior decisions, both majority\nand dissenting opinions, that address, in the context of\n\feither per se or as applied challenges, other constitu-\ntionally relevant factors. The purpose of our preserva-\ntion requirements—‘‘to ensure fair notice of a party’s\nclaims to both the trial court and opposing parties’’—\nwas thereby satisfied. White v.

These are\nmatters about which courts, historians, legal scholars,\nand social scientists have written extensively, both in\nConnecticut and nationally. The relevant legislative his-\ntory and constitutional facts are properly subject to\njudicial notice. The legal arguments are well trodden\nand not unfamiliar to us. After a decade of appeals in\nthis case, and several previous rounds of supplemental\nbriefing, our priority now must be to provide the parties,\nthe victims’ families, and the people of Connecticut\nwith some measure of clarity and resolution.\n                              3\n                 Extra-Record Materials\n  Chief Justice Rogers also maintains that we have\nrelied on extra-record materials that, she argues, are\nnot properly the subject of judicial notice. Again, we\ndisagree.\n   Although finding the adjudicative facts that concern\nthe parties and events of a particular case is largely the\nprovince of the jury—or the trial court in cases tried\nto the court—appellate courts tasked with determining\nthe content of law and policy may take notice of consti-\ntutional and legislative facts, such as historical sources\nand scientific and sociological studies. See footnote 44\nof this opinion. It is well established that ‘‘[t]he intellec-\ntual legitimacy of [judicial decisions in which the court\ntakes notice of legislative facts to ascertain constitu-\ntional norms] turns [on] the actual truth-content of the\nlegislative facts taken into account by the judges who\npropound the decision. While not necessarily indisput-\nably true, it would appear that these legislative facts\nmust at least appear to be more likely than not true if\nthe opinion is going to have the requisite intellectual\nlegitimacy [on] which the authority of judge-made rules\nis ultimately founded.’’ (Emphasis added.) 2 K. Broun,\nMcCormick on Evidence (7th Ed. 2013) § 331, pp. 612–\n13. Although Chief Justice Rogers accuses the majority\nof relying on ‘‘cherry picked,’’ extra-record materials;\nfootnote 30 of Chief Justice Rogers’ dissenting opinion;\nshe never specifically explains why she thinks the\nsources on which the majority relies, taken together,\nfail to satisfy this ‘‘more likely than not true’’ standard.\n2 K. Broun, supra, § 331, p. 613. She is unable to point\nto any methodological flaws in the social science and\nother research studies cited in this opinion, to challenge\n\fthe authors’ qualifications, or to direct our attention to\nany conflicting research of equal quality and breadth.\nShe fails to cite to any sources that undermine the\nmeticulous historical research provided by Collier, Con-\nnecticut’s state historian, or Holdsworth’s voluminous\nreview of early Connecticut legal history, or Professor\nGoodheart’s award winning treatise. Nor is there any\nsuggestion that the death penalty statistics that we have\npresented are inaccurate or misleading. In reality, the\nsociological research and historical facts on which we\nrely far exceed the governing more likely than not true\nstandard, and they are not subject to reasonable dis-\npute.\n   It is also noteworthy that the authorities on which\nChief Justice Rogers relies for the proposition that legis-\nlative fact-finding by appellate courts is improper\ninclude a law review article that begins by lamenting\nthat ‘‘[m]any of the [United States] Supreme Court’s\nmost significant decisions turn on questions of [legisla-\ntive] fact.’’ A. Larsen, ‘‘Confronting Supreme Court Fact\nFinding,’’ </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 1255, 1255 (2012). To be clear,\nthen, Chief Justice Rogers’ complaint is not that the\nmajority uses social science research in a manner that\nappellate courts ordinarily do not but merely that she\nand a handful of law professors personally disapprove\nof this common practice.\n   The sources on which Chief Justice Rogers relies\ncontend that legislative fact-finding by appellate tribu-\nnals is subject to bias and error, and that it deprives\nthe parties of the opportunity to participate fully in the\nadversarial truth seeking process. There is no doubt\nthat appellate review of legislative facts, as with virtu-\nally every other form of truth seeking in which human\nbeings engage, can be an imperfect process. Ultimately,\nhowever, the practice has been approved and adopted\nbecause there simply is no better alternative. Appellate\ncourts frequently are called on to make quasi-legislative\npolicy judgments, whether in crafting state common\nlaw, construing open-ended constitutional and statu-\ntory mandates, or simply determining whether a partic-\nular interpretation of a statute would ‘‘lead to absurd\nconsequences or bizarre results.’’ (Internal quotation\nmarks omitted.)

Ramey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2555256\"><a href=\"/opinion/2555256/raftopol-v-ramey/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 703,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2555256\"><a href=\"/opinion/2555256/raftopol-v-ramey/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011). These policy judgments often hinge\non facts about the world in which we live, facts the\nstudy of which is the domain of natural and social\nscientists. See 2 K. Broun, supra, § 331, pp. 610–15. If\nwe were to follow the counsel of Chief Justice Rogers,\nand submit every such question to the crucible of\nadversarial fact-finding in a trial court, the wheels of\njustice would quickly grind to a halt.114\n  Ultimately, and most importantly, Chief Justice Rog-\ners, having criticized our consideration of extra-record\nmaterials, fails to identify so much as a single statistic\nor historical fact cited in this opinion that she believes\n\fis subject to reasonable dispute. Accordingly, having\ncarefully considered Chief Justice Rogers’ arguments,\nwe continue to have every confidence that the constitu-\ntional and legislative facts on which we rely are a proper\nsubject of judicial notice, are more likely than not true,\nand paint an accurate picture of the historical and con-\ntemporary record of capital punishment in Connecticut\nand the United States.\n                            B\n         Connecticut’s Historical Acceptance\n              of Capital Punishment\n   We next address the argument of the dissenting jus-\ntices that capital punishment cannot now offend the\nconstitution of Connecticut because (1) there are refer-\nences to capital punishment in the text of both the 1818\nand 1965 state constitutions, (2) the framers of the 1818\nconstitution believed that the death penalty was an\nappropriate punishment for the most serious crimes,\nand (3) in 1965, the constitutional convention declined\nto adopt a constitutional provision that would have\nprohibited capital punishment. The premises of the dis-\nsents’ argument are undoubtedly true. The conclusion\nis not.\n   It is certainly the case that, although Connecticut has\nsteadily reduced the number of crimes subject to capital\npunishment over the past four centuries, the death pen-\nalty has continued during that period to be authorized\nby statute, and it is referenced in our state constitution.\nThere also is little doubt that the framers of the state\nconstitution considered the death penalty to be an\nacceptable form of punishment, under certain circum-\nstances and if properly applied. Although the dissenting\njustices reiterate these facts throughout their opinions,\nthey fail to explain exactly how our state’s historical\nacceptance of the death penalty answers the primary\nquestion presented by this appeal, namely, whether,\nfollowing the enactment of P.A. 12-5, capital punish-\nment now constitutes excessive and disproportionate\npunishment when viewed through the lens of our state’s\ncontemporary standards of decency.\n   As we have explained, the constitutionally relevant\ninquiry is whether the death penalty, as currently\nadministered in Connecticut, and following the enact-\nment of P.A. 12-5, offends our state’s evolving standards\nof decency, and whether that punishment continues to\nsatisfy any legitimate penological objective. Although\nthe fact that the death penalty was considered accept-\nable 50 or 200 years ago might be relevant to a challenge\ncontending that capital punishment is inherently uncon-\nstitutional; see State v. Ross, supra, 230 Conn. 249–50;\nit says little about whether capital punishment is consti-\ntutional today, in light of our legislature’s most recent\npronouncement on the issue, and given what we now\nunderstand and what our elected officials have deter-\n\fmined regarding capital punishment’s lack of deterrent\nvalue, the potential for irredeemable error, a pattern of\npersistently arbitrary and discriminatory application,\nand our state’s inability to administer the death penalty\nin a way that affords closure and solace to the families\nof the victims.\n   As the Supreme Court of California has recognized,\nincidental references to the death penalty in a state\nconstitution merely acknowledge that the penalty was\nin use at the time of drafting; they do not forever\nenshrine the death penalty’s constitutional status as\nstandards of decency continue to evolve: ‘‘It has been\nsuggested that we are . . . restrained from considering\nwhether capital punishment is proscribed by [the state\nconstitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual\npunishment] since the death penalty is expressly or\nimpliedly recognized in several other provisions of the\nCalifornia constitution. We perceive no possible con-\nflict or repugnance between those provisions . . .\nhowever, for none of the incidental references to the\ndeath penalty purport to give its existence constitu-\ntional stature. They do no more than recognize its exis-\ntence at the time of their adoption. Thus, the bail clause\nof [the California constitution] restricts the right to bail\nin capital cases . . . [and] the due process clause . . .\nensures that life will not be taken without due process\n. . . . None of these provisions can be construed as\nan affirmative exemption of capital punishment from\nthe compass of the cruel or unusual punishment clause\nof [the California constitution].’’ (Footnote omitted.)\nPeople v. Anderson, supra, 6 Cal. 3d 637–38. The United\nStates Supreme Court likewise has indicated that the\nmere fact that the federal constitution makes reference\nto capital crimes does not mean that contemporary\nstandards of decency may not evolve to the point that\nthe death penalty is no longer constitutionally permissi-\nble. See Gregg v. Georgia, supra, 428 U.S. 176–82 (opin-\nion announcing judgment).\n   It may well be that, at bottom, the opposition of\nthe dissenting justices reflects their disapproval of the\nevolving standards of decency test itself, a legal stan-\ndard according to which a penalty that once passed\nconstitutional muster may, within a relatively brief span\nof time, come to be deemed cruel and unusual.

But that is the\nlaw of the land, both federally and in Connecticut. In\nthe case of the death penalty, the past several years\nhave witnessed dramatic changes in the legal landscape,\n\fmost significant of which was the decision by the\nelected branches to abolish capital punishment for all\nfuture offenses. Whatever role the death penalty may\nonce have played in our system of justice, it is clear\nthat our elected representatives, acting on behalf of the\npeople of this state, have repudiated the death penalty\nas a sentencing option unworthy of continued sup-\nport.115\n                             C\n   Whether Deference to the Legislature Requires\n            That We Uphold P.A. 12-5\n   We next address the argument of the dissenting jus-\ntices that, in holding that the death penalty now violates\nthe constitution of Connecticut, we have failed to pay\nadequate deference to the will of the legislature. Each\nof the dissenting justices argues, in essence, that a\nreviewing court is bound to accept what the dissenting\njustices maintain to be the judgment of the legislature—\nthat the death penalty comports with contemporary\nstandards of decency and serves legitimate penological\ninterests—and that to do otherwise is to usurp the\nproper role of the legislature in order to advance judges’\npersonal moral agendas.116 We already have rejected\nthis argument in State v. Ross, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">–49,\nhowever, recognizing that it fundamentally misunder-\nstands the well established function and role of judicial\nreview in the capital sentencing context.\n   We begin by reiterating that, although the legislature\nvoted to abolish capital punishment on a solely prospec-\ntive basis, this by no means reflects or embodies a\ndetermination that the death penalty remains consonant\nwith contemporary standards of decency and continues\nto serve the goal of deterrence or retribution. The pro-\nspective nature of P.A. 12-5 instead appears to reflect\na belief on the part of some legislators that prior com-\nmitments the state has made to relatives of murder\nvictims justify the retention of capital punishment for\nuse in those cases. Capital punishment may, in other\nwords, simply be the lesser of two evils. Public Act 12-\n5 also likely reflects a purely political decision to placate\nthe public’s desire to exact vengeance on certain notori-\nous inmates, while passing along to this court the task of\nfinally decommissioning the state’s machinery of death.\nThere is abundant evidence in the legislative history to\nsupport both of these interpretations. See parts II B\nand III C of this opinion.\n  If we assume, for the sake of argument, however,\nthat a majority of the legislature has in fact determined\nthat capital punishment remains a morally acceptable\npunishment that serves legitimate penological interests,\nthe question arises as to the proper scope of this court’s\nreview. It is well established that, under both the federal\nand state constitutions, a criminal sentence challenged\nas unconstitutionally excessive or disproportionate\n\fmust undergo two stages of judicial review. First, the\nreviewing court determines whether the punishment\noffends contemporary standards of decency, as evi-\ndenced by the various factors discussed in part II of\nthis opinion. Legislative enactments are one of those\nconsiderations, but certainly not the only one. Second,\nthe court is required to exercise its own independent\njudgment as to whether the punishment remains suit-\nable to the crime and continues to serve any legitimate\npenological purpose. As the United States Supreme\nCourt explained in Atkins v. Virginia, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, although the current legislative judgment is of great\nimportance, ‘‘the [c]onstitution contemplates that in the\nend our own judgment will be brought to bear on the\nquestion of the acceptability of the death penalty under\nthe [e]ighth [a]mendment.’’ (Internal quotation marks\nomitted.) Id., 312. A punishment, therefore, must satisfy\nboth levels of review to survive constitutional scrutiny.\nSuch scrutiny is especially critical in the present case\nbecause, to our knowledge, we are the first court in\nthe modern era to comprehensively address the issue\nof whether the death penalty can remain consonant\nwith society’s evolving standards of decency and serve\nlegitimate penological interests following a prospective\nonly repeal.\n   Although Chief Justice Rogers concedes, as she must,\nthat a challenged punishment is subject to this type of\nclose judicial scrutiny, she nevertheless maintains that,\nbecause the constitutional authority to define crimes\nand to fix the degree and method of punishment belongs\nto the legislature, once the legislature has determined\nthat a particular punishment is appropriate and morally\nacceptable, that determination is, essentially, disposi-\ntive. If that were the case, then judicial review would\nbe a weak tea indeed. When an appellate court is asked\nto pass on the constitutionality of a mode of punish-\nment, it is, almost invariably, after a defendant has been\nfound guilty of a crime and sentenced in accordance\nwith a duly enacted penal statute. If the fact that an\nelected legislature had authorized and enacted the pun-\nishment in question were enough to insulate it from\njudicial scrutiny, then the freedom from cruel and\nunusual punishment would be a hollow one.

Instead, Chief Justice\nRogers merely queries how truly independent judicial\nreview of an allegedly cruel and unusual punishment\ncan be reconciled with the observation by that court, in\na 1989 decision, that, ‘‘ ‘[i]n determining what standards\nhave ‘‘evolved’’ . . . [the court has] looked not to [its]\nown conceptions of decency, but to those of modern\nAmerican society as a whole.’ ’’ Footnote 33 of Chief\nJustice Rogers’ dissenting opinion, quoting Stanford v.\nKentucky, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Of course, we do not\ndisagree with the cited language from Stanford insofar\nas independent judicial review must stand on the court’s\nprincipled consideration of the available evidence\nregarding a punishment’s penological merits, rather\nthan the personal predilections of individual judges.\nThe short answer to Chief Justice Rogers’ question,\nhowever, is that Stanford, which was an outlier at the\ntime it was decided, subsequently was overruled by\nRoper v. Simmons, supra, 543 U.S. 574–75, 578, and is\nno longer good law. See id., 574 (overruling holding of\nStanford that persons under eighteen years of age at\ntime of capital offense may be executed and explaining\nthat, ‘‘to the extent Stanford was based on a rejection\nof the idea that [the] [c]ourt is required to bring its\nindependent judgment to bear on the proportionality\nof the death penalty for a particular class of crimes or\noffenders . . . it suffices to note that this rejection was\ninconsistent with prior [e]ighth [a]mendment deci-\nsions’’ [citations omitted]). In fact, in Roper, the court\ntook pains to reiterate that ‘‘[t]he beginning point is a\nreview of objective indicia of consensus, as expressed\nin particular by the enactments of legislatures that have\naddressed the question. These data give us essential\ninstruction. We then must determine, in the exercise\nof our own independent judgment, whether the death\npenalty is a disproportionate punishment . . . .’’\n(Emphasis added.) Id., 564.\n   In reality, the United States Supreme Court has, on\nmultiple occasions, held that punishments that were\nduly enacted by democratically elected legislatures\nwere nevertheless unconstitutionally excessive and dis-\nproportionate under this standard.

As\nJustice White explained in Furman, ‘‘[j]udicial review,\nby definition, often involves a conflict between judicial\nand legislative judgment as to what the [c]onstitution\nmeans or requires. . . . It seems conceded by all that\n\f. . . there are punishments that the [eighth] [a]mend-\nment would bar whether legislatively approved or not.\nInevitably, then, there will be occasions when [the\ncourt] will differ with Congress or state legislatures\nwith respect to the validity of punishment.’’ Furman v.\nGeorgia, supra, 408 U.S. 313–14 (White, J., concurring).\nChief Justice Rogers may not agree that courts should\nplay such a critical role in securing the people’s freedom\nfrom cruel and unusual punishment, but that is the law\nof the land.

The death penalty is a punish-\nment that Connecticut has imposed on fewer than two\ndozen occasions over the past one-half century, and it\nhas been carried out only once during that time frame.\nThe penalty has been abolished by most of our neigh-\nboring states, and, after years of repeal efforts, our\nlegislature and governor have now followed suit, abol-\nishing it for all future crimes. Capital punishment has\nbeen preserved, then, only on a provisional basis, and\nonly for a handful of current death row inmates. More-\nover, the legislative history suggests that many legisla-\ntors would have supported a full repeal and that those\nwho voted to retain the death penalty on a retroactive\nbasis may well have done so in the belief that this court\nwould not permit any further executions to be carried\nout, as this state’s chief prosecutor himself predicted.\nSee part II B of this opinion; see also footnotes 1, 59\nand 60 of this opinion and accompanying text. In short,\nthe legislature could not have come any closer to fully\nabolishing capital punishment without actually doing\nso. We perceive no ringing legislative endorsement of\nthe death penalty in Connecticut.\n                             V\n                     CONCLUSION\n   In prospectively abolishing the death penalty, the leg-\nislature did not simply express the will of the people\nthat it no longer makes sense to maintain the costly and\nunsatisfying charade of a capital punishment scheme in\nwhich no one ever receives the ultimate punishment.\nPublic Act 12-5 also held a mirror up to Connecticut’s\nlong, troubled history with capital punishment: the\nsteady replacement by more progressive forms of pun-\nishment; the increasing inability to achieve legitimate\npenological purposes; the freakishness with which the\nsentence of death is imposed; the rarity with which it is\ncarried out; and the racial, ethnic, and socio-economic\n\fbiases that likely are inherent in any discretionary death\npenalty system. Because such a system fails to comport\nwith our abiding freedom from cruel and unusual pun-\nishment, we hold that capital punishment, as currently\napplied, violates the constitution of Connecticut.\n   The judgment is reversed with respect to the imposi-\ntion of a sentence of death and the case is remanded\nwith direction to impose a sentence of life imprison-\nment without the possibility of release; the judgment\nis affirmed in all other respects.\n  In this opinion NORCOTT, EVELEIGH and McDON-\nALD, Js., concurred.\n    * This opinion supplements the opinion of this court in State v.

For that reason, Kane\nadvised the legislature that the passage of a prospective only repeal ‘‘would\nactually nullify the death penalty for anybody who has not yet been exe-\ncuted.’’ Id., p. 2403.

We also issued an order requesting supplemental briefs\nfrom the parties to address a then unpublished paper in which the author\n\fasserted that the death penalty may be imposed for crimes committed before\nApril 25, 2012, as provided in P.A. 12-5. See K. Barry, From Wolves, Lambs:\nThe Case for Gradual Abolition of the Death Penalty (preliminary working\ndraft), subsequently published at K. Barry, ‘‘From Wolves, Lambs (Part I):\nThe Eighth Amendment Case for Gradual Abolition of the Death Penalty,’’\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fla.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 313 (2014). The defendant filed a second supplemental brief\naddressing the paper, but the state declined to do so.\n   9\n     The defendant also claims that imposing the death penalty on a person,\nsuch as the defendant, who committed a capital felony before April 25, 2012,\nwould (1) be arbitrary, in violation of General Statutes § 53a-46b (b), (2)\nviolate the equal protection guarantees of the federal and state constitutions,\n(3) violate the substantive due process guarantees of the federal and state\nconstitutions, (4) violate the federal constitutional prohibition against bills\nof attainder, (5) violate the federal constitutional prohibition against ex post\nfacto laws, and (6) violate the provision of article first, § 9, of the constitution\nof Connecticut barring punishments ‘‘except in cases clearly warranted by\nlaw.’’ Because we conclude that the state constitutional prohibition against\ncruel and unusual punishment no longer permits the imposition of the death\npenalty, we need not address these claims. Certain of these claims are\naddressed, however, in Justice Eveleigh’s concurring opinion and Chief\nJustice Rogers’ dissenting opinion.\n   10\n      We address certain other, more specific objections of the dissenting\njustices throughout this opinion.\n   11\n      It has been argued that, when an appellant challenges a statute or\npractice under both the state and federal constitutions, this court should\nfirst consider the state claims, turning to the federal claim only after\ndetermining that the appellant’s state constitutional challenges will not suc-\nceed. See W. Horton, The Connecticut State Constitution (2d Ed. 2012) p.\n37. This approach is particularly apt when, as in the present case, the claim\nis one of first impression under both the federal and state constitutions.\nAccordingly, we will evaluate and resolve the defendant’s claim under the\nstate constitution. Because the legal framework that we apply with respect\nto allegedly cruel and unusual punishments is not fundamentally distinct\nfrom that adopted by the United States Supreme Court, we have no reason\nto believe that the eighth amendment would compel a different result. In\nany event, because the defendant prevails under the state constitution, we\nneed not speculate as to how that court might resolve his federal claims or\ndecide whether the state constitution provides broader protection than the\nfederal constitution in this regard.\n   12\n      The relevant portions of article first, §§ 8 and 9, of the Connecticut\nconstitution of 1965 are derived almost verbatim from article first, §§ 9, 10\nand 13, of the Connecticut constitution of 1818.

Both state and federal constitutional\njurisprudence, then, has been marked by the use of such language. In the\npresent case, we likewise use the term ‘‘progressive’’ in its established\nconstitutional, rather than political, sense. We do agree with Chief Justice\nRogers, however, that, although the arc of our history in this regard is both\nclear and profound, there is no constitutional mandate that our state’s\ncriminal law become increasingly compassionate.\n    25\n       For nearly one century after the adoption of the English Declaration of\nRights of 1689, for instance, ‘‘the law of Great Britain condemned a prisoner\nwho refused to plead to be slowly pressed to death by weights placed [on]\nhis chest.’’ Judicial and Civil History of Connecticut (D. Loomis & J. Calhoun\neds., 1895) p. 63; see also W. Holdsworth, supra, p. 356 (mutilating punish-\nments were imposed far less frequently in seventeenth century Massachu-\nsetts and, especially, in Connecticut, than in England); W. Holdsworth,\nsupra, p. 361 (England permitted more extensive and more brutal corporal\npunishment than Connecticut in mid-seventeenth century); W. Holdsworth,\nsupra, pp. 431–32, 568 (capital punishment was considerably rarer in New\nEngland than in England, where theft of as little as one shilling constituted\ncapital crime); W. Holdsworth, supra, p. 569 (‘‘[t]he courts and legislatures\nof Connecticut and New Haven succeeded in creating a more equitable and\n\fless brutal system of criminal justice than that of England’’).\n   26\n      For example, a second wave of immigration brought new residents to\nConnecticut during this period, significantly expanding the colonial popula-\ntion. These immigrants did not share the founding generation’s vision of\nConnecticut as a ‘‘new Israel under a new covenant,’’ committed to observing\nand strictly enforcing the judicial laws of Moses. W. Holdsworth, supra, p.\n124; see id., pp. 532–34, 579–81. Whereas their predecessors were preoccu-\npied with the moral aspects of sinfulness, the new citizens were more\nconcerned with addressing the practical consequences of crime. See id., p.\n518. This ‘‘erosion of moral outrage’’ left the public less convinced of the\nneed for strict punishment in many cases and resulted in more lenient public\nsentiment toward a number of crimes. Id., p. 518; see id., p. 576.\n   27\n      In 1666, for example, a special court of assistants at Governor Winthrop’s\nurging overruled Hannah Hackleton’s death sentence for blasphemy. See\nW. Holdsworth, supra, p. 381. The same year, in the case of Elizabeth Seager,\nGovernor Winthrop himself directly overturned a capital sentence, this time\nfor witchcraft, and ordered the defendant freed. See id., pp. 519–20. Seager\nis believed to have been the first convicted witch to have escaped the gallows\nin Connecticut. See id., p. 520. Four years later, a specially appointed court\nreleased another woman who had been sentenced to die for witchcraft. See\nid., pp. 520–21. Katherine Harrison’s case is noteworthy as the first instance\nin which a Connecticut court reversed a jury conviction in a capital case.\nSee id., p. 521.\n   28\n      That such punishments had come to be seen as cruel in Connecticut is\napparent from the case of Polly Rogers, a Native American who petitioned\nthe legislature for redress in 1815 after having been convicted of adultery\nand sentenced to whipping and branding. L. Goodheart, supra, p. 78. ‘‘In\nkeeping with the sensibility of the age,’’ Professor Lawrence B. Goodheart\nrecounts, ‘‘she protested the ‘cruel punishment of being branded with a hot\niron.’ ’’ Id. The legislature granted her request and spared her. Id.\n   Moreover, although Newgate hardly would have met modern standards\nfor the treatment of inmates, records from Connecticut’s preconstitutional\nperiod clearly indicate that the legislature was concerned that prisoners\nnot be treated cruelly. In 1809, the legislature appointed a committee that\nconsidered, and ultimately enacted, the governor’s recommendation that\nthe prisoners in Newgate would benefit from religious instruction. See 1\nCrimes and Misdemeanors, 2d Series (1809) pp. 95a–96a. The following year,\na second committee was appointed to evaluate the condition of the prison’s\ninmates. See 1 Crimes and Misdemeanors, 2d Series (1810) p. 97a. On the\nbasis of the resulting report, the legislature directed Newgate’s overseers\nto provide the prisoners with a more diverse diet and to ensure that suitable\nbathing places were provided. See id., pp. 99d–99e, 99z, 100a. At the same\ntime, the legislature resolved to prohibit ‘‘unnecessary and cruel punish-\nments’’ within the facility. Id., p. 100a. In 1815, just three years before the\nadoption of the state constitution, a legislative committee went even further,\ncondemning the practice of whipping at Newgate as ‘‘incompatible with\n. . . decency and humanity,’’ and beginning to plan for the construction of\na new state prison. 1 Crimes and Misdemeanors, 2d Series (1815) pp. 153a,\n154c; see also 2 Z. Swift, A Digest of the Laws of the State of Connecticut\n(1823) pp. 268–69 (‘‘and though the law invests [jailers] with all the powers\nnecessary for the interest of the commonwealth, yet they are not to behave\nwith the least degree of wanton cruelty to their prisoners’’).\n   29\n      The fact that Swift later repudiated some of his more progressive peno-\nlogical views is of little moment. Swift did not begin to author his Digest\nof the Laws of the State of Connecticut until after he stepped down as\nChief Justice in 1819; P. O’Sullivan, ‘‘Biographies of Connecticut Judges I:\nZephaniah Swift,’’ 19 Conn. B.J. 181, 190–91 (1945); and it was in that work\nthat he embraced a more severe philosophy of punishment.

Id., 451 n.13.\n   30\n      Justice Zarella is simply incorrect, then, when, in his dissenting opinion,\nhe contends that ‘‘[w]hat is striking thing about this case . . . is the lack\nof any suggestion by the legislature . . . that the imposition of the death\npenalty was wrong.’’\n   31\n      Although we look primarily to our state’s preconstitutional traditions\nand the history and intent of the drafters of the 1818 constitution to parse\n\fthe meanings of article first, §§ 8 and 9; see State v. Joyner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">450</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 486–87, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993) (Berdon, J., dissenting); it also may be\nappropriate to consider how the 1818 provisions were interpreted in 1965,\nwhen they were incorporated into the state’s present constitution. See W.\nHorton, The Connecticut State Constitution (2d Ed. 2012) pp. 33–34. By that\ntime, attitudes toward the purpose and permissible scope of punishment in\nConnecticut had, of course, evolved even further, in ways that are too\nnumerous to count. Perhaps the clearest example of this evolution may be\nseen in the state prison in Somers, which replaced the Wethersfield facility\nshortly before the new constitution was adopted. See G. Demeusy, ‘‘State\nDedicates New Prison with Note of Hope for Future,’’ Hartford Courant,\nFebruary 16, 1964, p. 15B; G. Demeusy & J. Tucker, ‘‘400 Convicts Are Moved\nto New Somers Prison,’’ Hartford Courant, November 6, 1963, p. 1. At a\ndedication ceremony in 1964, the new facility was described as ‘‘a symbol\nof progress, a gateway to penal reform . . . .’’ (Internal quotation marks\nomitted.) ‘‘Penal Outlook Hailed at State Prison Ceremony,’’ Hartford\nCourant, February 15, 1964, p. 4. Speaking at the dedication, Warden Freder-\nick G. Reincke hailed the Somers prison as ‘‘the beginning of a new era\n. . . primarily devoted to preparing inmates for adjusting to community\nliving and responsibility when they are released.’’ (Internal quotation marks\nomitted.) Id. According to Reincke, ‘‘[t]he days of revenge imprisonment in\nConnecticut [were] over.’’ Id.\n   The chairman of the prison’s board of directors, Charles Stroh, concurred,\nexplaining that ‘‘we . . . have launched a rehabilitation [facility] that cen-\nters not around retribution and punishment, but the individual training and\ntreatment of inmates.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) G. Demeusy,\nsupra, p. 15B. This new penal philosophy, he explained, reflected an emerging\npublic ‘‘realization that there’s something more to penology than simply\nlocking up the lawbreakers.’’ Id. Stroh further explained: ‘‘There is punish-\nment—but it’s punishment for a purpose and it is accepted by the inmates\nas a part of their rehabilitation . . . .’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\nId. For his part, Governor John Dempsey opined that the new state prison\nwas ‘‘wholly in keeping with modern penology, [and] maintain[ed] Connecti-\ncut’s reputation as a state that is forward-looking and progressive in all\nfields of human endeavor.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. To the\nextent that conceptions of cruel and unusual punishment prevalent at the\ndrafting of the 1965 state constitution are relevant to the Geisler analysis,\nthen, there is no doubt that our state’s understanding of the permissible\nnature and purposes of punishment had undergone a thorough transfor-\nmation.\n   32\n      Connecticut ultimately approved the federal Bill of Rights in 1939, 150\nyears after its submission to the states for ratification in 1789. P. Maier,\nRatification: The People Debate the Constitution, 1787–1788 (2010) p. 459.\n   33\n      The opinions of the dissenting justices reveal the prescience of these\nfears.\n   34\n      In State v.

Those standards are, rather,\nthe substantive test according to which both this court and the federal\ncourts evaluate such claims. The Geisler ‘‘test,’’ by contrast, is merely a\nscheme by which we organize and review, for purposes of state constitutional\nchallenges, the various types of considerations that may bear on any question\nof first impression.\n   39\n      Although Chief Justice Rogers, in her dissenting opinion, suggests that,\nbecause the federal constitution makes express reference to capital offenses,\nit is an open question as to whether the federal courts ever would find\nthe death penalty unconstitutional per se under the evolving standards of\ndecency rubric, we disagree. In Gregg v. Georgia, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109532\"><a href=\"/opinion/109532/gregg-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the\nUnited States Supreme Court made clear that even claims that capital punish-\nment is categorically unconstitutional are to be evaluated according to that\nrubric, and that the constitutional text is not dispositive. See id., 176–87\n(opinion announcing judgment).\n   40\n      The majority specifically stated: ‘‘The first five factors do not support\nthe . . . argument [of the defendant, Michael B. Ross]. In article first, § 8,\nand article first, § 19, our state constitution makes repeated textual refer-\nences to capital offenses and thus expressly sustains the constitutional\nvalidity of such a penalty in appropriate circumstances. Connecticut case\nlaw has recognized the facial constitutionality of the death penalty under\nthe eighth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution. . . .\nFederal constitutional law does not forbid such a statute outright. . . .\nCourts in the overwhelming majority of our sister states have rejected facial\nchallenges to the death penalty under their state constitutions. Finally,\nConnecticut’s history has included a death penalty statute since 1650, when\nit was incorporated into Ludlow’s Code . . . and such a penalty was consid-\nered constitutional at the time of the adoption of the constitution of 1818.’’\n(Citations omitted; footnotes omitted.) State v. Ross, supra, 230 Conn.\n249–50.\n   41\n      We note that the dissenting justices, while criticizing our departure from\nthe court’s discussion of capital punishment in Ross, make no attempt to\ndefend the adequacy of the analysis therein.\n   42\n      In Webb, this court did consider and reject an alternative argument: that\ncapital punishment violates the social compact clause of article first, § 1,\nof the state constitution. State v. Webb, supra, 238 Conn. 406–12.\n   43\n      We do not disagree with Chief Justice Rogers that the last two factors—\nthe laws and practices of other jurisdictions, and the opinions and recom-\nmendations of professional associations-—are of less importance, and we\nagree that those considerations alone would constitute an insufficient basis\nfor deeming a punishment cruel and unusual in the absence of any evidence\nthat it has come to be so in Connecticut. We do, however, disagree with\nChief Justice Rogers’ suggestion in her dissenting opinion that the defendant\nhas asked that we consider the constitutional implications of the adoption\nof P.A. 12-5 in a complete factual and jurisprudential vacuum, ignoring any\nand all other evidence that capital punishment no longer comports with\ncontemporary standards of decency in Connecticut, even insofar as that\nevidence pertains to the defendant’s claim that the death penalty is now\nunconstitutional in light of P.A. 12-5. In fact, in his brief to this court, the\n\fdefendant expressly asked us to consider previous decisions of this court\nthat explored all of these factors in substantial depth.\n    44\n       We previously have permitted citation to extra-record reference materi-\nals as evidence of contemporary societal norms or to advocate for a new\ninterpretation of the state constitution. See, e.g., State v. Rizzo, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> n.81; see also Hall v.

Notice also may be taken in this context of\ntreatises reporting the public history of Connecticut. See 1 B. Holden & J.\nDaly, Connecticut Evidence (1988) § 31, pp. 128–29. More generally, it is\nwell established that an appellate court may take notice of ‘‘legislative facts,’’\nincluding historical sources and scientific studies, ‘‘which help determine\nthe content of law and policy,’’ as distinguished from the ‘‘adjudicative\nfacts,’’ which concern ‘‘the parties and events of a particular case.’’ (Internal\nquotation marks omitted.)

Importantly, although some opponents of P.A. 12-5 chided supporters\nfor what the opponents characterized as the inconsistency of prospectively\nrepealing capital punishment while retaining it for those already on death\nrow, they consistently characterized this dichotomy as a moral inconsistency\nrather than a merely pragmatic decision. See, e.g., 55 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 2012\nSess., pp. 747–48, remarks of Senator Suzio.\n   55\n      Ignoring Senator Kissel’s explanation that members of the legislature\nhave indicated over the course of many years their moral opposition to the\ndeath penalty, Chief Justice Rogers queries ‘‘how Kissel could have known\nthat.’’ Footnote 26 of Chief Justice Rogers’ dissenting opinion. The relevant\nquestion, rather, is on what basis Chief Justice Rogers would purport to\nknow better than a twelve term senator and ranking member of the Judiciary\nCommittee what lies in the hearts and minds of his colleagues.\n   56\n      See 55 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 2012 Sess., pp. 583–84, remarks of Senator Carlo\nLeone; 55 H.R. Proc., Pt. 4, 2012 Sess., pp. 1373–74, remarks of Representative\nJuan R. Candelaria.\n   Chief Justice Rogers also takes out of context public testimony by Profes-\nsor Kevin Barry, which she offers as evidence that support for P.A. 12-5\nwas driven primarily by financial considerations. See footnote 19 of Chief\nJustice Rogers’ dissenting opinion; see also Conn. Joint Standing Committee\nHearings, Judiciary, Pt. 9, 2012 Sess., pp. 2765–66. In fact, in the quoted\ntestimony, Barry is speaking about the decision of the New Mexico legislature\nto repeal that state’s death penalty on a prospective only basis. Id., p.\n2765. Specifically, Barry refers to evidence that New Mexico’s repeal was\nmotivated in large part by that state’s pending budget crisis. Id. Although\nBarry does propose that the state might try to make a similar argument in\nConnecticut, he provides no support for the proposition that cost considera-\ntions were of comparable importance for the legislators who supported P.A.\n12-5. Indeed, his statements amount to little more than a recommended\nlitigation strategy for those who would seek to preserve the death pen-\nalty retroactively.\n   57\n      See, e.g., 55 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 2012 Sess., pp. 781–82, remarks of Senator\nEdith Prague (opposing capital punishment out of moral concern that inno-\ncent not be wrongly executed, but favoring retroactivity out of respect for\nsurvivors of victims of capital felonies committed before 2012); id., p. 662,\nremarks of Senator Andrew W. Roraback (‘‘I have long believed that the\n[s]tate shouldn’t be in the business of taking life. And as strongly as I believe\nthat, I believe even more strongly that the [s]tate shouldn’t be in the business\nof breaking its commitment to victims of crime.’’).\n   58\n      We do not share Chief Justice Rogers’ conviction that those legislators\nwho believed capital punishment to be indecent or unjustified, and yet who\nheld out for a prospective only repeal in order to honor the state’s prior\ncommitments to the families of murder victims, are somehow illogical or\n‘‘morally incoherent . . . .’’ Footnote 22 of Chief Justice Rogers’ dissenting\nopinion. There are, no doubt, opponents of the death penalty whose princi-\npled opposition is so staunch and so unyielding that they would not counte-\nnance its use under any circumstances. We are equally certain, however,\nthat there are people of good faith and clear mind who, although they have\ncome to believe that, on balance, state sanctioned killing is impermissibly\nexcessive, or arbitrary, or subject to error, are not so stridently opposed\nthat their opposition cannot yield to countervailing moral commitments.\nEach day, legislators, no less than judges, must balance conflicting moral\n\fprinciples and commitments: between free expression and national security;\nbetween environmental conservation and the fruits of economic develop-\nment; between a right to life and a freedom of choice. Why Chief Justice\nRogers believes that opposition to the death penalty, alone among principled\nbeliefs, must be uncompromising simply eludes us. See generally K.

See footnote\n28 of Chief Justice Rogers’ dissenting opinion.\n   62\n      It bears noting that senators rejected an amendment crafted to ensure\nthat capital punishment would be retained for those already on death row\nin the event that a court declared P.A. 12-5 unconstitutional. The proposed\namendment provided that, if a court were to conclude that a bifurcated,\nprospective only repeal of the death penalty was unconstitutional, the repeal\nwould be nullified, and the state’s capital felony statutes would revert to\ntheir pre-2012 status. See 55 S.

That conclusion,\nChief Justice Rogers contends, violates what she refers to as the ‘‘constitu-\ntional principle that this court must presume that the legislature has acted\nfor legitimate reasons . . . .’’ Text accompanying footnote 23 of Chief Jus-\ntice Rogers’ dissenting opinion. We have no quarrel with this principle\ngenerally, but Chief Justice Rogers’ reliance on it in the present case is\nmisplaced. First, there is nothing improper about a legislator acting on the\nbasis of political considerations. Moreover, Chief Justice Rogers’ argument\nimproperly conflates equal protection and eighth amendment principles. As\nshe asserts; see text accompanying footnote 93 of Chief Justice Rogers’\ndissenting opinion; when a statutory classification is challenged on equal\nprotection grounds, but the classification does not involve a fundamental\nright or suspect class, such as race or national origin, it will be evaluated\nunder the highly deferential ‘‘rational basis’’ standard of review.

In fact, Governor\nMalloy’s signing statement, in which he makes it abundantly clear that\nhis opposition to capital punishment is principled rather than pragmatic,\nnotwithstanding his stated preference for a prospective only repeal, offers\nperhaps the clearest and most powerful refutation of Chief Justice Rogers’\ninterpretation of P.A. 12-5.

If Chief Justice Rogers truly\nbelieves that we have arrived at this conclusion by ‘‘relying solely on [our]\nown views’’ about capital punishment; footnote 33 of Chief Justice Rogers’\ndissenting opinion; and merely because ‘‘it offends [our own] subjective\nsense of morality,’’ it is only because she herself has refused either to\nconsider or to recognize the import of the words of our elected officials,\nthe actions of our jurors and prosecutors, the story of our history, the path\ntrodden by our sister states, and the overwhelming evidence that our society\nno longer considers the death penalty to be necessary or appropriate.

In fact, the opposite may be true. In the three years prior to Ross’\n2005 execution, an average of 102 murders were committed annually in\nConnecticut, a figure that is actually inflated by virtue of the inclusion of\nsixteen deaths resulting from a single nursing home arson.

By contrast, from 2006\nthrough 2008, an average of 124 murders were committed per annum; id.;\na 22 percent increase.\n   We also note that murder rates actually fell in the wake of the mid-2012\nabolition of the death penalty. The number of reported murders in the state’s\nlargest urban areas fell by more than 33 percent in the first half of 2013, as\ncompared to the first half of 2012. See Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n‘‘Crime in the United States 2013: January-June Preliminary Semiannual\nUniform Crime Report,’’ Table 4, available at http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/\ncjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/preliminary-semiannual-uniform-crime-\n report-january-june-2013/tables/table-4-cuts/table_4_offenses_reported_to_\n\flaw_enforcement_by_state_colorado_through_idaho_2013.xls (last visited\nJuly 27, 2015).

Their principled views, while no less deserving of\nrespect, are simply not relevant to the question before us: whether those\nlegislators who voted to abolish capital punishment only on the condition\nthat it be retained for those already occupying death row did so out of a\nprincipled belief in the appropriateness of the death penalty or, rather, to\nsatisfy a public or private call for vengeance against the perpetrators in the\nCheshire case.\n    109\n        B. Connors, ‘‘Prague: ‘Hang the Animal By His . . .’,’’ NBC Connecticut\n(May 12, 2011), quoting Senator Edith Prague, available at http://\nwww.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Prague-Hang-the-Animal-by-His-\n121670559.html (last visited July 27, 2015).\n    110\n        Because we conclude both that the continued imposition of the death\npenalty in Connecticut following the enactment of P.A. 12-5 offends contem-\nporary standards of decency and that it fails to satisfy any legitimate penolog-\nical objective, we need not determine whether it has come to be so rarely\nimposed that it also violates the state constitutional prohibition on unusual\npunishment. As we discussed; see footnote 16 of this opinion; the United\nStates Supreme Court has at times suggested that the eighth amendment\nmay contain an independent prohibition against punishments that are\n\funusual, even if they are not cruel. Recent scholarship supports this interpre-\ntation and suggests that, especially in light of the enactment of P.A. 12-5,\nthe death penalty in Connecticut has become impermissibly unusual. See\nR. Casale & J. Katz, ‘‘Would Executing Death-Sentenced Prisoners after the\nRepeal of the Death Penalty Be Unusually Cruel under the Eighth Amend-\nment?,’’ 86 Conn. B.J. 329, 341, 344–45 (2012). For example, Professor John\nF. Stinneford has observed that, under the original meaning of unusual\npunishment, ‘‘when a traditional [common-law] punishment falls completely\nout of usage, it loses the presumption of validity that comes with being\nusual,’’ and attempts to reintroduce it would be met with as much or more\nscrutiny as entirely novel punishments. J. Stinneford, ‘‘The Original Meaning\nof ‘Unusual’: The Eighth Amendment as a Bar to Cruel Innovation,’’ 102 Nw.\nU. L. Rev. 1739, 1746, 1813 (2008). This reflects the principle that, ‘‘[a]s\ncourts decide cases year after year and century after century, impractical\nand unjust legal practices fall away like dross, while practical and just ones\nsurvive’’; J. Stinneford, supra, 1775; and may apply with equal force to\npunishments eliminated by legislative reform. See id., 1814. This interpreta-\ntion of the constitutional ban on unusual punishment also is consistent with\nConnecticut common law in the years leading up to the adoption of the\n1818 constitution. See, e.g., State v. Smith, supra, 5 Day (Conn.) 178–79\n(reviewing claim that punishment was new or ‘‘novel, without precedent’’);\nL. Goodheart, supra, pp. 68, 76–77 (in 1808, legislature voted to commute\ndeath sentence of Clarissa Ockry, who otherwise would have been first\nwoman executed in Connecticut for infanticide since 1753).\n   111\n       Although Justice Zarella contends otherwise, we disagree for the rea-\nsons stated in this opinion.\n   112\n       Although it might have been helpful for the defendant himself to review\nthe additional historical information that has come to light over the past\nseveral years, his failure to do so does not preclude our consideration of\ninformation revealed from our own independent research. See part IV A 3\nof this opinion.\n   113\n       See part IV C of this opinion.\n   114\n       To respond that appellate courts simply should refuse to consider or\naddress any questions of legislative fact that have not already been fully\nvetted by the parties at the trial level is to miss the point. When a court\nconsiders a legislative fact, it typically is because that fact is central to a\nquestion of policy the necessary determination of which will broadly impact\npersons who are not parties to the immediate dispute. To turn a blind eye\nto relevant and well established scientific or sociological knowledge that\nthe parties may have overlooked or decided to leave unearthed, whether\nfor strategic or financial reasons, would unjustly and unwisely subject the\npublic at large to the results of an ill-informed decision.\n   115\n       Of course, if the citizens of Connecticut wish to reinstate the death\npenalty, they may always amend the state constitution, as the citizens of\nCalifornia and Massachusetts did, to clarify that the punishment is and will\nremain constitutional notwithstanding any evolution in the state’s standards\nof decency.\n   116\n       See footnote 89 of this opinion.\n\f</pre>",
