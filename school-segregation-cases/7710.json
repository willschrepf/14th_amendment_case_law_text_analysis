This case arises out of an alleged breach of contract and bad-faith denial of Dr. Jack\n\nand Margaret Hoover’s homeowner’s insurance claim against United Services Automobile\n\nAssociation (“USAA”) following Hurricane Katrina (“Katrina”). The trial judge granted\n\fUSAA’s motion for directed verdict as to the Hoovers’ claims for: (1) the unpaid portion of\n\nlosses; (2) mental anguish and emotional distress; and (3) punitive damages. The trial court\n\nfurther determined that there were issues of fact for the jury as to whether the Hoovers’ roof\n\nstructure was damaged, and as to the Hoovers’ claim for additional living expenses (“ALE”).\n\nThe jury found for the Hoovers and returned a verdict of $81,342.97 in compensatory\n\ndamages. The Hoovers appealed and USAA cross-appealed.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n¶2.    The Hoovers presented evidence that they incurred $240,917.56 in costs to repair their\n\nproperty for losses inflicted by Katrina and $1,342.97 for ALE. The Hoovers also claimed\n\nan “additional $80,000 in future cost to replace . . . [the] roof structure.” 1 USAA provided\n\nhomeowners’ insurance for the Hoovers.2 USAA posited that the majority of the Hoovers’\n\nloss occurred on the lower floor of the home and was the result of excluded storm surge.\n\nUSAA limited the “covered loss” to $56,748.17 and made payments totaling that amount\n\nover time. USAA denied that the Hoovers’ roof structure needed to be replaced and that\n\ncoverage extended to ALE.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       At various points, we will refer to the “roof structure.” This is not to be confused\nwith roof shingles. USAA paid to reshingle the roof on both the dwelling and the cabana.\nThe “roof structure” refers to the actual roof framing of the dwelling, which USAA denied\nwas damaged by Katrina.\n       2\n        The pertinent coverage limits were $264,000 for the dwelling, $26,400 for other\nstructures (10% of limit of liability for dwelling), and $52,800 for loss of use.\n\n                                              2\n\f¶3.    On August 11, 2008, the Hoovers filed a complaint against USAA in the Circuit Court\n\nof Jackson County alleging, inter alia, breach of contract and tortious bad-faith breach of\n\ncontract. USAA filed its “Answer and Defenses[,]” and raised, as its seventh affirmative\n\ndefense, that the “damages for which Plaintiffs seek recovery were either caused or\n\ncontributed to by excluded water damage as defined in the policy.”\n\n¶4.    A four-day jury trial was held before the Honorable Frank Vollor. Following the close\n\nof the Hoovers’ case-in-chief, USAA moved for a directed verdict on all claims. The trial\n\ncourt granted USAA’s motion as to the Hoovers’ claims for mental anguish and emotional\n\ndistress.\n\n¶5.    At the close of all evidence, the trial court ruled that “the only evidence present [was]\n\nthat the damage to the lower part of the floor was done by the storm surge[,]” and, thus, did\n\nnot allow that issue to go to the jury. However, the trial court determined that whether the\n\nroof structure was damaged was “still in dispute[,]” and “allow[ed] that [issue] to go to the\n\njury[,]” along with the ALE claim. The jury awarded the Hoovers $81,342.97 in\n\ncompensatory damages.3 Thereafter, the trial court denied the Hoovers’ claim for punitive\n\ndamages. Final judgment was entered on September 2, 2011.\n\n                                           ISSUES\n\n¶6.    On appeal, the Hoovers raise the following issues, restated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n       3\n           The verdict was comprised of $80,000 to repair the damaged roof and $1,324.97 in\nALE.\n\n                                               3\n\f      I.     Whether the trial judge erred by granting directed verdict in favor of\n             USAA regarding the contractual damages in the amount of\n             $240,917.56.\n      II.    Whether the trial judge erred by granting directed verdict in favor of\n             USAA regarding the Hoovers’ mental-anguish and emotional-distress\n             claims.\n      III.   Whether the trial judge erred by granting a directed verdict in favor of\n             USAA regarding the Hoovers’ punitive-damages claims.\n\n¶7.   On cross-appeal, USAA raises the following issues:\n\n      IV.    Whether the trial judge failed to properly apply the Daubert standards\n             to Dr. Ralph Sinno’s testimony that the Hoovers’ roof structure was\n             damaged.\n      V.     Whether the trial judge erred in allowing Sinno to testify as to the cost\n             of replacing the roof structure.\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n      I.     Whether the trial judge erred by granting directed verdict in favor of\n             USAA regarding the contractual damages in the amount of\n             $240,917.56.\n\n¶8.   The standard of review for the trial court’s grant or denial of a motion for directed\n\nverdict is de novo. Braswell v. Stinnett, 99 So. 3d 175, 177-78 (Miss. 2012) (citing\n\nThompson v. Nguyen, 86 So. 3d 232, 236 (Miss. 2012)).\n\n¶9.   In Corban v. United Services Automobile Association, 20 So. 3d 601, 619 (Miss.\n\n2009), this Court unanimously held that:\n\n      [w]ith respect to the “all-risk” coverage of “Coverage A-Dwelling” and\n      “Coverage B-Other Structures,” the Corbans are required to prove a “direct,\n      physical loss to property described.” Thereafter, USAA assumes the burden to\n      prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the causes of the losses are\n      excluded by the policy, in this case, “[flood] damage.” USAA is obliged to\n      indemnify the Corbans for all losses under “Coverage A-Dwelling” and\n      “Coverage B-Other Structures” which USAA cannot establish, by a\n\n\n                                             4\n\f       preponderance of the evidence, to have been caused or concurrently\n       contributed to by “[flood] damage.”\n\n(Emphasis added.) In the case sub judice, several facts are uncontradicted. The Hoovers had\n\na USAA “all-risk” homeowners’ policy that was in effect at the time of Katrina.4 The proof\n\npresented by the Hoovers is that they suffered $240,917.56 in “direct physical loss” to their\n\ndwelling and other structures as a result of Katrina. The Hoovers satisfied the burden\n\nrequired by Corban.5 The Hoovers were entitled to payment for those losses, unless USAA\n\ncould “prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the causes of the losses are excluded\n\nby the policy, in this case, ‘flood damage.’” Id.\n\n¶10.   Nevertheless, at the close of all evidence, the trial court granted a directed verdict for\n\nUSAA as to the unpaid portion of the Hoovers’ dwelling losses. The trial court stated, in\n\npertinent part,\n\n       the proof is overwhelming that the lower part [of the house] was involved in\n       a surge. There’s nothing to contradict that. So the Court finds that the evidence\n       – that’s the only evidence present, that the damage to the lower part of the\n       floor was done by the storm surge, saltwater surge, which I understand a lot of\n       the testimony comes from Dr. Hoover himself . . . . The court thinks the\n       plaintiff should have had to put on something to show it was other than surge.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      The pertinent language of the Hoovers’ USAA homeowners’ policy is identical to\nthe USAA policy considered by this Court in Corban.\n       5\n      In its brief, USAA acknowledged that the Hoovers had met their burden under\nCorban.\n\n                                               5\n\f¶11.   USAA acknowledges the standard set forth in Corban but argues that it met its burden\n\nof proof “through documents, its own investigation, and the cross examination of [Dr.\n\nHoover] that the lower part of the house was damaged by storm surge flooding, not wind.”\n\nUSAA contends that, “at that point, the burden shifted back to the Hoovers to put on some\n\nproof to create an issue of fact,” and the Hoovers failed to meet the burden to put on\n\ncontradictory evidence.\n\n¶12.   In support of its argument that the burden shifted back to the Hoovers, USAA cites\n\nBayle v. Allstate Insurance Co., 615 F. 3d 350 (5th Cir. 2010). In Bayle, a Katrina case, the\n\nFifth Circuit held that if the insurer “make[s] out a prima facie case that the cause of the\n\nuncompensated or under-compensated damage was excluded from coverage[,]” then “the\n\nburden shifts to the insured to present evidence demonstrating there remains a material issue\n\nof fact.” Id. at 359. USAA’s reliance on Bayle is unavailing, as that case applied Louisiana\n\nlaw. Id. USAA cites no authority under Mississippi law for the proposition that the burden\n\nof proof shifts back to the insured.\n\n¶13.   In Broussard v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., 523 F. 3d 618, 627 (5th Cir. 2008),\n\nthe same court noted that “[t]he Mississippi Supreme Court has not explicitly addressed the\n\n‘shifting back’ theory when considering an ‘open peril’ policy.” 6 In Broussard, State Farm\n\nargued, inter alia, that “under the dwelling coverage, once it advance[d] evidence to establish\n\n\n\n       6\n         See Eric M. Holmes, Appleman on Insurance § 192.09 (2d ed. 2008) (“‘Open peril’\ncoverage is . . . typical of coverage for dwellings and other structures on insured property .\n. . .”).\n\n                                              6\n\fits affirmative policy exclusion defenses, the burden shifts back to the Broussards to prove\n\nthat there is an exclusion to the defenses or to segregate covered from non-covered\n\ndamages.” Id. at 626. State Farm’s argument mirrored the one advanced by USAA in this\n\ncase. After a thorough examination of Mississippi caselaw, the Broussard court rejected\n\nState Farm’s “shifting back theory” as the rule in Missisissippi. Id. at 627. Appleman on\n\nInsurance refers to Broussard as “[t]he signature case on allocation of burden of proof for\n\nhurricane damages.” Eric M. Holmes, Appleman on Insurance § 192.09 (2d ed. 2008).\n\n¶14.   In Grace v. Lititz Mutual Insurance Co., 257 So. 2d 217, 219, 224-25 (Miss. 1972)\n\n(citing Commercial Union Insurance Co. v. Byrne, 248 So. 2d 777, 781 (Miss. 1971)), this\n\nCourt stated, “[t]he rule is well established in this state that where the question presented to\n\nthe jury was whether the loss was due to windstorm or water, the entire question of proximate\n\ncause is treated as one of fact independent of the explicit application of any rule of law.”\n\n(Emphasis added.) Broussard interpreted “State Farm’s ‘shifting back’ theory . . . to be the\n\nsort of ‘rule of law’ which would operate in many cases to take the issue of causation away\n\nfrom the jury.” Broussard, 523 F. 3d at 627. The Broussard court stated, “the ultimate\n\nallocation of wind and water damages under the Broussard’s dwelling coverage is a question\n\nof fact for the jury.” Id. This statement is consistent with this Court’s holding in Corban that\n\nthe issue of whether the damage was caused by wind or excluded storm surge is “a question\n\nof fact for the jury.” Corban, 20 So. 3d at 619.\n\n¶15.   The trial court’s finding that the Hoovers “should have put on something to show that\n\nit was other than surge” was erroneous and in conflict with this Court’s prior decisions,\n\n                                               7\n\fincluding Corban. USAA bears the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that\n\nthe loss was caused by, or concurrently contributed to, by an excluded peril. This issue of\n\nfact is one for the jury, and the burden of proof does not shift to the Hoovers.7 Therefore, the\n\ntrial court erred in granting a directed verdict as to the Hoover’s unpaid damages.\n\n       II.    Whether the trial judge erred by granting directed verdict in favor of\n              USAA regarding the Hoovers’ mental-anguish and emotional-distress\n              claims.\n\n¶16.   “[I]nsurers have a duty ‘to perform a prompt and adequate investigation and make a\n\nreasonable, good faith decision based on that investigation[,]” and failure to perform this duty\n\nmay render the insurer liable for extracontractual damages. Broussard, 523 F. 3d 627-28\n\n(quoting Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. McKneely, 862 So. 2d 530, 535 (Miss. 2003)). However,\n\n“[e]xtracontractual damages, such as awards for emotional distress and [mental anguish] . .\n\n. are not warranted where the insurer can demonstrate ‘an arguable, good-faith basis for\n\ndenial of a claim.’” United Serv. Auto. Ass’n v. Lisanby, 47 So. 3d 1172, 1178 (Miss. 2010)\n\n(quoting United Am. Ins. Co. v. Merrill, 978 So. 2d 613, 627)). The “‘plaintiff bears a heavy\n\n\n\n\n       7\n        The dissent articulates a scholarly analysis of federal procedure, yet the “tennis\nmatch” scenario it advances is not the law in this case. Contrary to the dissent’s contention\nthat we conflate the burdens of production and persuasion, Corban addressed both. The\ninsured bears the burden of producing evidence to make out a prima facie case of a “direct,\nphysical loss to property described.” Corban, 20 So. 3d at 619. The insured also bears the\nburden of persuasion on this issue. The insurer bears the burden to produce evidence to\nsupport its affirmative defense “that the causes of the losses are excluded by the policy.” Id.\nThe insurer also bears the burden of persuasion on its affirmative defense. These are the\nrespective burdens under Corban and its progeny which create an issue of fact for the jury.\n\n                                               8\n\fburden’ of proving that the denial of an insurance claim was in bad faith.” Id. (quoting\n\nWindmon v. Marshall, 926 So. 2d 867, 872 (Miss. 2006)).\n\n       The plaintiff's burden in proving a claim for bad faith refusal goes beyond\n       proving mere negligence in performing the investigation. The level of\n       negligence in conducting the investigation must be such that a proper\n       investigation by the insurer would easily adduce evidence showing its defenses\n       to be without merit.\n\nLisanby, 47 So. 3d at 1178 (quoting Windmon, 926 So. 2d at 872).\n\n¶17.   Citing Lisanby, the trial court granted USAA’s motion for directed verdict on the\n\nissue of mental anguish and emotional distress because “[USAA] had an arguable reason for\n\nthe denial of the claim.” The Hoovers argue that the trial court erred in granting directed\n\nverdict because “[USAA] failed to present any evidence that any investigation was conducted\n\nregarding the losses USAA alleged were excluded from coverage.”\n\n¶18.   On September 23, 2005, insurance adjuster Michael Long inspected the Hoovers’\n\nhome. According to Long’s report, “the dwelling sustained approximately 4 f[ee]t of water\n\ninside due to storm surge.” Long’s “estimate include[d] repairs only to damages [he] was\n\nclearly able to determine were due to wind.” Long determined that the roofs on the dwelling\n\nand cabana needed to be replaced, along with fencing and the back-yard playhouse. Long\n\nalso included interior water damage to the ceilings in his estimate. However, Long did not\n\ninclude damage to the pool liner “as it was not clear if wind caused the damage.” Long did\n\nnot establish a reserve for ALE.\n\n¶19.   On September 24, 2005, USAA hired an engineering firm, SEA, Ltd., to inspect the\n\nHoovers’ home. USAA’s request to SEA stated, in pertinent part, “[p]lease inspect and offer\n\n                                             9\n\fa professional opinion regarding causation, i.e., wind vs. flood surge. We need to know if\n\ndirect physical loss by wind contributed to the destruction and/or damage to the building. If\n\nyes, please identify the related building damage.” On October 2, 2005, SEA engineer Richard\n\nSchimizze conducted an inspection and submitted a detailed report to USAA.8 SEA opined\n\nthat\n\n       about 3 [feet] of floodwater had inundated the home. All material damage\n       located below the first-floor ceiling in the home was the result of the\n       floodwater and was clearly not related to the high winds. All damage to the\n       roofs of both structures was directly caused by the high winds of the storm.\n       Water damage at or above the first-floor ceiling in the home was indirectly\n       caused by the high winds that penetrated the enclosure and allowed rainwater\n       to enter the upper portions of the structure . . . . [T]he pool damage was caused\n       by the large volume of floodwater produced by the hurricane surge.\n\n¶20.   Thereafter, Dr. Hoover presented USAA with additional information pertinent to the\n\ncause of his loss that he requested USAA consider. Inter alia, Hoover sent USAA a weather\n\nreport from AccuWeather and the report of Dr. Ralph Sinno, which opined that the Hoovers’\n\nroof structure was damaged by wind, and he continued to seek payment for ALE. On each\n\noccasion, USAA forwarded the information to SEA and requested an updated report. SEA\n\nissued new reports which affirmed its initial opinion as to Hoovers’ damage and disputed Dr.\n\nSinno’s opinion that the roof structure had been damaged.\n\n¶21.   The record supports the trial court’s finding that USAA had an “arguable basis” for\n\ndenying a portion of the Hoovers’ damages. USAA relied on the investigation of its adjusters\n\n\n       8\n       The SEA report is dated January 25, 2006. However, the report indicates that its\nfindings were communicated verbally to Long on October 10, 2005, and to “Bill McNamara\nof USAA” on October 11, 2005.\n\n                                              10\n\fand the reports of SEA in denying certain aspects of the claim which were deemed excluded.\n\nAs such, the trial court did not err in granting a directed verdict on this issue.\n\n       III.   Whether the trial judge erred by granting a directed verdict in favor of\n              USAA regarding the Hoovers’ punitive-damages claims.\n\n¶22.   In order to recover punitive damages, the Hoovers “must show that [USAA] denied\n\nthe claim (1) without an arguable or legitimate basis, either in fact or law, and (2) with malice\n\nor gross negligence in disregard of the insured’s rights.” Broussard, 523 F. 3d at 628\n\n(quoting U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Wigginton, 964 F. 2d 487, 492 (5th Cir. 1992)). The trial\n\ncourt found that USAA had an “arguable basis” for denying part of the Hoovers’ claim. We\n\ncan discern no error by the trial court in granting a directed for USAA on the issue of\n\npunitive damages.\n\n                                         Cross-appeal\n\n       IV.    Whether the trial judge failed to properly apply the Daubert standards\n              to Dr. Ralph Sinno’s testimony that the Hoovers’ roof structure was\n              damaged.\n\n¶23.   This Court has stated:\n\n       [T]he admission of expert testimony is within the sound discretion of the trial\n       judge . . . . Therefore, the decision of a trial judge will stand unless we\n       conclude that the discretion was arbitrary and clearly erroneous, amounting to\n       an abuse of discretion. Mississippi law requires the trial court to ensure that\n       proposed [expert] testimony satisfies Rule 702 . . . . In McLemore, this Court\n       adopted the Daubert/Kumho Tire rule as the standard for admissibility of\n       expert witness testimony.\n\nRebelwood Apartments RP, LP v. English, 48 So. 3d 483, 494 (Miss. 2010) (citing Miss.\n\nTransp. Comm'n v. McLemore, 863 So. 2d 31, 34 (Miss. 2003); Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v.\n\n\n                                               11\n\fCarmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 119 S. Ct. 1167, 143 L.

Rule 702 provides:\n\n       [i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of\n       fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness\n       qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,\n       may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony\n       is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of\n       reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles\n       and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\n\nMiss. R. Evid. 702 (emphasis added).\n\n¶25.   “[A]n expert’s qualification and reliability of testimony are separate questions.”\n\nRebelwood, 48 So. 3d at 494 (citing Bullock v. Lott, 964 So. 2d 1119, 1129 (Miss. 2007)).\n\nOn this issue, USAA’s argument to the trial court and this Court revolves around the\n\n“reliability” of Dr. Sinno’s testimony, and not his qualifications.9 USAA challenged Dr.\n\nSinno’s testimony because he “[had] not done a technical structural inspection of [the]\n\nhouse.” Thus, USAA argues that Dr. Sinno’s testimony failed to meet the requirement of\n\nRule 702 in that it was not “based upon sufficient facts or data” and he did not “apply the\n\nprinciples and methods reliably to the facts of the case.” Miss. R. Evid. 702.\n\n¶26.   Dr. Sinno’s testimony reveals that he did not inspect the Hoovers’ home before\n\nissuing his report that the roof structure had been damaged and would require replacement.\n\n\n       9\n        The trial judge found Dr. Sinno was “eminently qualified” to testify. Dr. Sinno has\nhad a lengthy career in the field, including being a professor of engineering for twenty-four\nyears. He is a fellow with the American Society of Civil Engineering and has spent years\nresearching, testing, and writing on “wind loading.”\n\n                                               12\n\fBut, his testimony clearly exemplifies the basis of his knowledge and subsequent opinion.\n\nDr. Sinno had spent years researching “wind loading,” and in 2005 was the first “in the\n\nworld” to duplicate hurricane wind in the laboratory and study its effect on structures. He\n\ntestified, “everything I am going to talk about today is actually test results, test products, not\n\ntheory . . . .” Dr. Sinno possessed the information regarding wind velocities that the Hoover\n\nhome would have encountered, and based on his research regarding wind loading on\n\nstructures, he was qualified to give his opinion on the effects that winds would have had on\n\nthe Hoovers’ roof structure. Moreover, USAA cross-examined Dr. Sinno regarding his\n\nmethods, his findings, and the fact that he had never inspected the home prior to writing his\n\nreport. USAA also countered Dr. Sinno’s testimony with that of its own expert.\n\n¶27.   Although Dr. Sinno did not inspect the Hoover home prior to issuing his report, he did\n\ninspect it prior to testifying at trial. He testified that the findings of his inspection supported\n\nthe conclusion of his report. Because his report was not admitted as evidence, USAA can\n\nonly claim that his testimony at trial was not based on sufficient facts or data. The fact that\n\nDr. Sinno did inspect the house prior to testifying negates USAA’s argument that his\n\ntestimony lacked a sufficient basis because he failed to inspect. Therefore, the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in allowing Dr. Sinno’s testimony on this issue.\n\n       V.      Whether the trial judge erred in allowing Sinno to testify as to the cost\n               of replacing the roof structure.\n\n¶28.   On this issue, USAA challenges both Dr. Sinno’s qualifications and reliability. First,\n\nUSAA argues that Dr. Sinno is not an expert on the cost to repair residential roofs. On voir\n\n\n                                                13\n\fdire, Dr. Sinno testified that, as an engineering professor, he taught classes in which\n\ncurriculum included construction-cost estimation, itemizing costing and other kinds of\n\ncosting, inter alia. His qualifications as a structural engineer were properly presented to the\n\ntrial court. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion by allowing Dr. Sinno to provide\n\nexpert testimony as to the cost to replace the roof structure.\n\n¶29.   Second, USAA argues that Dr. Sinno did not have a reliable basis based on the facts\n\nof the case to form his opinion as to the cost to replace the roof. Specifically, USAA argues\n\nthat Dr. Sinno “fail[ed] to include essential facts” such as “board feet of lumber, pounds of\n\nnails, man hours,” etc. Dr. Sinno testified that he used a cost-plus estimate based on known\n\nvalues to arrive at his calculations. He assessed that it would cost $40 per square foot to\n\nreplace the roof, and multiplied this by the total square footage of the house. Although this\n\nwas not the method USAA suggests he should have used, Dr. Sinno nonetheless used an\n\naccepted method for estimating the cost to repair the roof. Moreover, USAA cross-examined\n\nDr. Sinno about this method of determining cost. The trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin concluding that Dr. Sinno was qualified to provide expert testimony as to the cost to repair\n\nthe Hoovers’ roof, and that his method was based on sufficient facts to meet the requirements\n\nor Rule 702.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n¶30.   Based on this analysis, the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard and\n\nimproperly shifted the burden of proof to the Hoovers. We reverse the trial court’s grant of\n\na directed verdict as to the unpaid damages, and remand the case for a jury to determine\n\n                                              14\n\fwhether USAA proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the unpaid loss was caused\n\nby excluded storm surge. The trial court did not err in directing a verdict for USAA as to the\n\nHoovers’ claims for mental anguish, emotional distress, and punitive damages. Therefore,\n\non direct appeal, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. The trial court did not err in\n\nadmitting the expert testimony of Dr. Sinno as to whether the roof structure was damaged or\n\nthe cost to repair such damage. Therefore, on cross-appeal, we affirm.\n\n¶31. ON DIRECT APPEAL: AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND\nREMANDED.

The majority incorrectly concludes that the trial judge “improperly shifted the burden\n\nof proof to the Hoovers.” This did not happen. To say that the “burden of proof” never\n\nleaves the party asserting a claim or defense is not to say that the defending party never has\n\na burden.\n\n¶33.   The burden of proof is actually divided into two burdens or parts: The burden to\n\nproduce evidence, and the burden to persuade. The trial of an issue – whether a claim or\n\ndefense – proceeds in three stages. In stage one, the party asserting a claim or defense has\n\nthe burden of producing enough credible evidence to establish a prima facie case for the\n\nclaim or defense.\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f¶34.   Once this burden – which never moves from the party asserting the claim or defense\n\n– is met, the trial of the issue moves to stage two, in which the defending party has the\n\nburden of producing evidence sufficient to create a jury issue. When a defending party fails\n\nto meet this burden – that is, fails to produce evidence sufficient to create a jury issue – the\n\nparty asserting the claim or defense is entitled to a directed verdict on the claim or defense.\n\n¶35.   Finally, during stage three, the party asserting the claim or defense has the burden of\n\npersuading the jury that the evidence supports the claim or defense by the applicable\n\nstandard, whether preponderance of the evidence, clear and convincing evidence, or beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.\n\n¶36.   USAA asserted a defense, claiming that a policy exclusion applied. During stage one,\n\nit certainly produced sufficient evidence to support the defense. During stage two, the\n\nHoovers not only failed to produce evidence sufficient to create a jury issue as to USAA’s\n\ndefense, they failed to produce any evidence at all. Therefore, the issue never made it to\n\nstage three.\n\n¶37.   The trial judge, who clearly recognized that USAA had the burden of proof correctly\n\nobserved that – because USAA had produced sufficient, competent, credible evidence to\n\nsupport its policy exclusion – it had, as a matter of law, met its burden of proof, absent some\n\ncontrary proof from the Hoovers. The trial judge’s position is perfectly supported by the\n\nFifth Circuit’s opinion in Bayle v. Allstate Insurance Co.10\n\n\n\n       10\n            Bayle v. Allstate Ins. Co., 615 F.3d 350, 359 (5th Cir. 2010).\n\n                                               16\n\f¶38.   Had the Hoovers met their burden of production – that is, had they come forward with\n\ncontrary proof – a jury issue would have been created, and the issue would have been\n\nsubmitted to the jury for decision. But the burden of persuasion still would have been on\n\nUSAA. The majority forgets that USAA always had the burden of producing proof sufficient\n\nto establish a prima facie case, and it confuses the Hoovers’ burden of producing evidence\n\nin order to create a jury issue, with USAA’s burden of persuasion.\n\n¶39.   Justice Coleman’s opinion – that the Hoovers’ failure to produce any contrary\n\nevidence properly resulted in a directed verdict on the issue – is exactly correct, under the\n\nfacts of this case. But I wish to point out that there may be cases where the evidence\n\nsupporting an exclusion presented by the insurance company is so thin and lacking in\n\ncredibility that a trial judge would be justified in submitting its credibility to the jury, even\n\nin the absence of contrary evidence. Stated another way, a policyholder may demonstrate\n\nthat a jury question has been created in two ways: (1) by producing contrary evidence, or (2)\n\nby persuading the trial judge that the jury should be allowed to decide whether the insurance\n\ncompany’s uncontradicted evidence is so lacking in credibility that it ought to be rejected.\n\nIn either case, the burden to produce evidence establishing a prima facie case, and the burden\n\nof persuasion remains always with an insurance company as to its affirmative defenses.\n\n       COLEMAN, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n\n       COLEMAN, JUSTICE, DISSENTING:\n\n¶40.   Burden of proof is a broad phrase, and its meaning encompasses at least two subsets\n\n– the burden of persuasion and the burden of production. The majority’s analysis and result\n\n                                               17\n\fwould be correct were the issue in the case the burden of persuasion – which never left\n\nUSAA as to its affirmative defense. However, the burden of production did indeed move to\n\nthe plaintiff once USAA produced competent evidence supporting its affirmative defense.\n\nBecause I believe the majority wrongly conflates the two different burdens in a way that\n\nleads to an incorrect result and statement of the law, I respectfully dissent.\n\n¶41.   There exist at least two categories of burdens of proof, “the device to compel evidence\n\nand the device to deal with uncertainty,” and until the end of the nineteenth century courts\n\nindeed referred to both with the single phrase “burden of proof.” See 21B Charles Alan\n\nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure, Evidence § 5122 (2d ed. 1987).11\n\nHowever, in later decades various terms emerged for them as it became clear that distinction\n\nbetween the two indeed had a difference. Id. “One burden is that of producing evidence,\n\nsatisfactory to the judge, of a particular fact in issue. The second is the burden of persuading\n\nthe trier of fact that the alleged fact is true.” McCormick on Evidence § 336 (Kenneth S.\n\nBroun, et al., eds., 7th ed. 2013).\n\n\n\n       11\n          We often cite with approval Wright and Miller’s encyclopedic work on federal civil\nprocedure. See Indemnity Ins. Co. of North America v. Guidant Mut. Ins. Co., 99 So. 3d\n142, 154 (¶ 34) (Miss. 2012) (citing Wright and Miller for the proposition that oral testimony\nmay be admitted at a hearing on a motion for summary judgment); Jackson Public Sch.\nDist. v. Head, 67 So. 3d 761, 767 (¶ 23) (Miss. 2011) (citing Wright and Miller to support\nholding that, in the context of a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution, any prejudice\nresulting from the delay must be weighed against the preference for a decision on the\nmerits); see also Calvert v. Griggs, 992 So. 2d 627, 631-632 (¶ 10) (Miss. 2008). Finding\na paucity of cases from our own state’s jurisprudence explaining the difference, I now turn\nto their thorough treatment of the history and practical effects of burdens of proof and\npresumptions.\n\n                                              18\n\f¶42.   We ascribe standards of proof to the burden of persuasion, e.g., beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt and by a preponderance of the evidence, because in doing so courts and legislatures\n\ncan match the difficulty of the burden to the importance of any public policies that might be\n\naffected. 21B Fed. Prac. & Proc., Evid. § 5122 (2d ed. 1987). The standards of proof reflect\n\nthat one party – usually the plaintiff but the defendant in most affirmative defenses – must\n\npersuade the trier of fact of the truth of disputed facts to the assigned degree. Id.\n\n¶43.   The burden of production, on the other hand, differs significantly in nature. It “refers\n\nto the obligation of the party to produce enough evidence at trial to justify sending the case\n\nto the jury.” Id. “The party who fails to satisfy [the burden of production] will be sanctioned\n\nby the court’s entry of a directed verdict in favor of her opponent.” Id.; see also McCormick\n\non Evidence § 336 (Kenneth S. Broun, et al., eds., 7th ed. 2013) (“The burden of producing\n\nevidence is a critical mechanism in a jury trial, as it empowers the judge to decide the case\n\nwithout jury consideration when a party fails to sustain the burden.”). Wright and Miller list\n\nthe following distinctions between the burdens of persuasion and production:\n\n       • The burden of production is in the hands of the judge; the jury enforces the\n         burden of persuasion.\n\n       • The sanction for failure to carry the burden of production is a directed\n         verdict for the adversary; the sanction for failure to carry the burden of\n         persuasion is a jury verdict for the opposing party.\n\n       • The judge must instruct the jury on the burden of persuasion; the jury never\n         need hear about the burden of production.\n\n       • The burden of production can arise each time the party with the production\n         burden rests which may be several times during the trial; the burden of\n\n\n                                              19\n\f          persuasion comes into play only once—when the case is submitted to the\n          jury.\n\n       • Since it can only arise once, it is sometimes said that the burden of\n         persuasion never shifts. On the other hand, writers suppose that the burden\n         of production can shift back and forth as the parties take turns introducing\n         evidence. . . .\n\n       • Finally, the two burdens of proof are related in that the burden of production\n         normally falls on the party with the burden of persuasion. On the other\n         hand, unless the burden of production is satisfied, the burden of persuasion\n         will never arise because the judge will take the case from the jury.\n\n21B Fed. Prac. & Proc., Evid. § 5122 (2d ed. 1987) (citations omitted).\n\n¶44.   “It is recognized that as to any given issue the burden of persuasion and the burden\n\nof production of evidence generally both fall on the same party at the beginning of trial, that\n\nthe burden of persuasion does not thereafter shift, but that the burden of production may shift\n\nback and forth as each side produces evidence, takes advantage of presumptions or the like.”\n\nSimpson v. Home Petroleum Corp., 770 F.2d 499, 503 (5th Cir. 1985). “[I]t is everywhere\n\nagreed that the other burden, i.e., the burden of producing evidence . . . , may and often does\n\nshift back and forth between the parties like a tennis ball in play . . . .” Id. (quoting Ray,\n\nTexas Law of Evidence § 46 (3rd ed. 1980)).\n\n¶45.   As noted above, not many Mississippi cases discuss the distinction between the\n\nburdens of production and persuasion, but our courts have not left the tablet wholly blank.\n\nWe have, for example, used the two phrases in a manner consistent with the above discussion\n\nin cases involving will contests. In Clardy v. National Bank of Commerce of Mississippi,\n\n555 So. 2d 64 (Miss. 1989), we wrote:\n\n\n                                              20\n\f       Once the proponent has shouldered his burden of production such that he has\n       made out a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the contestants.\n       What is critical for present purposes is that the burden of persuading the trier\n       of fact on the issues of due execution and testamentary capacity rests on\n       proponent throughout and never shifts to the contestants.\n\nId. at 66. The idea of having two types of burden of proof – one which shifts and the other\n\nwhich cannot – is not wholly new to Mississippi law.12\n\n¶46.   Turning to the case sub judice, I agree with the majority’s analysis as applied to the\n\nburden of persuasion, but I disagree that the burden of production does not shift. In holding\n\nthat Mississippi prohibits burden-shifting, the majority relies upon the following language\n\nfrom Corban v. United Services Automobile Association, 20 So. 3d 601 (Miss. 2009):\n\n       This Court finds that with respect to the “all-risk” coverage of “Coverage\n       A-Dwelling” and “Coverage B-Other Structures,” the Corbans are required to\n       prove a “direct, physical loss to property described.” Thereafter, USAA\n       assumes the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the\n       causes of the losses are excluded by the policy, in this case, “[flood] damage.”\n       USAA is obliged to indemnify the Corbans for all losses under “Coverage\n       A-Dwelling” and “Coverage B-Other Structures” which USAA cannot\n       establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been caused or\n       concurrently contributed to by “[flood] damage.”\n\nId. at 619 (¶ 51). It is clear that the Corban Court, in writing about the burden of proving\n\nfacts by a “preponderance of the evidence” referred to what has come to be known over the\n\npast century or more as the burden of persuasion, discussed above. Standards of proof do not\n\napply to the burden of production. 21B Fed. Prac. & Proc., Evid. § 5122 (2d ed. 1987).\n\n\n       12\n         Accordingly, elucidating the distinctions is not a mere scholarly pursuit based only\non federal civil procedure, but it is a more full explication of something that already exists,\nobscured in the background though it may be, in our state’s jurisprudence and must be fully\nunderstood to reach the correct holding in the case sub judice.\n\n                                              21\n\f¶47.   With respect, the majority again misses the importance of the distinction when it\n\nrefuses to find persuasive the Fifth Circuit’s opinion in Bayle v. Allstate Insurance Co., 615\n\nF.3d 350 (5th Cir. 2010). Clearly, when the Bayle Court wrote that the burden shifted to the\n\ninsured “to present evidence demonstrating there remain[s] a material issue of fact,” Id. at\n\n359 (emphasis added), it wrote of the burden of producing evidence and not the burden of\n\npersuading the finder of fact.\n\n¶48.   The majority incorrectly writes that the argument of State Farm in Broussard v. State\n\nFarm Fire and Casualty Co., 523 F.3d 618 (5th Cir. 2008), mirrored that of USAA here.\n\nIn Broussard, the trial court granted a directed verdict against State Farm, and State Farm\n\nargued that it had produced evidence that created an issue of fact. Id. at 625. State Farm was\n\nnot arguing that it had met its burden of production and that the plaintiffs had failed to\n\nproduce evidence creating an issue of fact, which is USAA’s argument in the instant case.\n\nIn any event, when making its Erie guess regarding the correct burdens of proof, the\n\nBroussard Court relied on “the rule that causation is a fact question for the jury.”\n\nBroussard, 523 F.3d at 627. Accordingly, the Broussard Court concerned itself primarily\n\nwith the burden of persuasion. The jury never concerns itself with the burden of production.\n\n21B Fed. Prac. & Proc., Evid. § 5122 (2d ed. 1987).\n\n¶49.   When the trial judge stated his understanding that “the plaintiff should have to had to\n\nput on something to show it was other than surge,” he was not incorrectly reassigning the\n\nburden of persuasion. He did not say he would require the plaintiffs to convince the jury by\n\na preponderance of the evidence that conflicting evidence showed the damage was caused\n\n                                             22\n\fby something other than surge. Rather, he was correctly observing that when the insurer\n\nprovided credible proof of causation, the burden of production of evidence moved to the\n\nplaintiff to create an issue of fact. DeLaughter v. Womack, 250 Miss. 190, 211-212, 164 So.\n\n2d 762, 771 (1964) (after plaintiff made out prima facie case of negligence, defendants were\n\nrequired to produce evidence to the contrary), overruled on other grounds by Hall v. Hilbun,\n\n466 So. 2d 856, 866 (Miss. 1985); see also McCormick on Evidence § 336 (Kenneth S.\n\nBroun, et al., eds., 7th ed. 2013) (“Clearly, the principal significance of the burden of\n\npersuasion is limited to those cases in which the trier of fact is actually in doubt [as to the\n\ntruth of a disputed fact issue]”). Because the plaintiff failed to produce competent, contrary\n\nevidence, there existed no disputed facts as to which the trier of fact needed to be persuaded\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence. The trial court correctly analyzed that the plaintiffs had\n\nnot done so, that no issues of material fact existed for the jury, and entered judgment in favor\n\nof the insurer as required by law.\n\n¶50.   Although I agree with the majority’s analysis of the other issues raised by the\n\nappellants, pursuant to the above analysis I would affirm the trial court.

This case arises out of an alleged breach of contract and bad-faith denial of Dr. Jack\n\nand Margaret Hoover’s homeowner’s insurance claim against United Services Automobile\n\nAssociation (“USAA”) following Hurricane Katrina (“Katrina”). The trial judge granted\n\fUSAA’s motion for directed verdict as to the Hoovers’ claims for: (1) the unpaid portion of\n\nlosses; (2) mental anguish and emotional distress; and (3) punitive damages. The trial court\n\nfurther determined that there were issues of fact for the jury as to whether the Hoovers’ roof\n\nstructure was damaged, and as to the Hoovers’ claim for additional living expenses (“ALE”).\n\nThe jury found for the Hoovers and returned a verdict of $81,342.97 in compensatory\n\ndamages. The Hoovers appealed and USAA cross-appealed.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n¶2.    The Hoovers presented evidence that they incurred $240,917.56 in costs to repair their\n\nproperty for losses inflicted by Katrina and $1,342.97 for ALE. The Hoovers also claimed\n\nan “additional $80,000 in future cost to replace . . . [the] roof structure.” 1 USAA provided\n\nhomeowners’ insurance for the Hoovers.2 USAA posited that the majority of the Hoovers’\n\nloss occurred on the lower floor of the home and was the result of excluded storm surge.\n\nUSAA limited the “covered loss” to $56,748.17 and made payments totaling that amount\n\nover time. USAA denied that the Hoovers’ roof structure needed to be replaced and that\n\ncoverage extended to ALE.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       At various points, we will refer to the “roof structure.” This is not to be confused\nwith roof shingles. USAA paid to reshingle the roof on both the dwelling and the cabana.\nThe “roof structure” refers to the actual roof framing of the dwelling, which USAA denied\nwas damaged by Katrina.\n       2\n        The pertinent coverage limits were $264,000 for the dwelling, $26,400 for other\nstructures (10% of limit of liability for dwelling), and $52,800 for loss of use.\n\n                                              2\n\f¶3.    On August 11, 2008, the Hoovers filed a complaint against USAA in the Circuit Court\n\nof Jackson County alleging, inter alia, breach of contract and tortious bad-faith breach of\n\ncontract. USAA filed its “Answer and Defenses[,]” and raised, as its seventh affirmative\n\ndefense, that the “damages for which Plaintiffs seek recovery were either caused or\n\ncontributed to by excluded water damage as defined in the policy.”\n\n¶4.    A four-day jury trial was held before the Honorable Frank Vollor. Following the close\n\nof the Hoovers’ case-in-chief, USAA moved for a directed verdict on all claims. The trial\n\ncourt granted USAA’s motion as to the Hoovers’ claims for mental anguish and emotional\n\ndistress.\n\n¶5.    At the close of all evidence, the trial court ruled that “the only evidence present [was]\n\nthat the damage to the lower part of the floor was done by the storm surge[,]” and, thus, did\n\nnot allow that issue to go to the jury. However, the trial court determined that whether the\n\nroof structure was damaged was “still in dispute[,]” and “allow[ed] that [issue] to go to the\n\njury[,]” along with the ALE claim. The jury awarded the Hoovers $81,342.97 in\n\ncompensatory damages.3 Thereafter, the trial court denied the Hoovers’ claim for punitive\n\ndamages. Final judgment was entered on September 2, 2011.\n\n                                           ISSUES\n\n¶6.    On appeal, the Hoovers raise the following issues, restated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n       3\n           The verdict was comprised of $80,000 to repair the damaged roof and $1,324.97 in\nALE.\n\n                                               3\n\f      I.     Whether the trial judge erred by granting directed verdict in favor of\n             USAA regarding the contractual damages in the amount of\n             $240,917.56.\n      II.    Whether the trial judge erred by granting directed verdict in favor of\n             USAA regarding the Hoovers’ mental-anguish and emotional-distress\n             claims.\n      III.   Whether the trial judge erred by granting a directed verdict in favor of\n             USAA regarding the Hoovers’ punitive-damages claims.\n\n¶7.   On cross-appeal, USAA raises the following issues:\n\n      IV.    Whether the trial judge failed to properly apply the Daubert standards\n             to Dr. Ralph Sinno’s testimony that the Hoovers’ roof structure was\n             damaged.\n      V.     Whether the trial judge erred in allowing Sinno to testify as to the cost\n             of replacing the roof structure.\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n      I.     Whether the trial judge erred by granting directed verdict in favor of\n             USAA regarding the contractual damages in the amount of\n             $240,917.56.\n\n¶8.

In Corban v. United Services Automobile Association, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1560116\"><a href=\"/opinion/1560116/corban-v-united-services-auto-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 619 (Miss.\n\n2009), this Court unanimously held that:\n\n      [w]ith respect to the “all-risk” coverage of “Coverage A-Dwelling” and\n      “Coverage B-Other Structures,” the Corbans are required to prove a “direct,\n      physical loss to property described.” Thereafter, USAA assumes the burden to\n      prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the causes of the losses are\n      excluded by the policy, in this case, “[flood] damage.” USAA is obliged to\n      indemnify the Corbans for all losses under “Coverage A-Dwelling” and\n      “Coverage B-Other Structures” which USAA cannot establish, by a\n\n\n                                             4\n\f       preponderance of the evidence, to have been caused or concurrently\n       contributed to by “[flood] damage.”\n\n(Emphasis added.) In the case sub judice, several facts are uncontradicted. The Hoovers had\n\na USAA “all-risk” homeowners’ policy that was in effect at the time of Katrina.4 The proof\n\npresented by the Hoovers is that they suffered $240,917.56 in “direct physical loss” to their\n\ndwelling and other structures as a result of Katrina. The Hoovers satisfied the burden\n\nrequired by Corban.5 The Hoovers were entitled to payment for those losses, unless USAA\n\ncould “prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the causes of the losses are excluded\n\nby the policy, in this case, ‘flood damage.’” Id.\n\n¶10.   Nevertheless, at the close of all evidence, the trial court granted a directed verdict for\n\nUSAA as to the unpaid portion of the Hoovers’ dwelling losses. The trial court stated, in\n\npertinent part,\n\n       the proof is overwhelming that the lower part [of the house] was involved in\n       a surge. There’s nothing to contradict that. So the Court finds that the evidence\n       – that’s the only evidence present, that the damage to the lower part of the\n       floor was done by the storm surge, saltwater surge, which I understand a lot of\n       the testimony comes from Dr. Hoover himself . . . . The court thinks the\n       plaintiff should have had to put on something to show it was other than surge.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      The pertinent language of the Hoovers’ USAA homeowners’ policy is identical to\nthe USAA policy considered by this Court in Corban.\n       5\n      In its brief, USAA acknowledged that the Hoovers had met their burden under\nCorban.\n\n                                               5\n\f¶11.   USAA acknowledges the standard set forth in Corban but argues that it met its burden\n\nof proof “through documents, its own investigation, and the cross examination of [Dr.\n\nHoover] that the lower part of the house was damaged by storm surge flooding, not wind.”\n\nUSAA contends that, “at that point, the burden shifted back to the Hoovers to put on some\n\nproof to create an issue of fact,” and the Hoovers failed to meet the burden to put on\n\ncontradictory evidence.\n\n¶12.   In support of its argument that the burden shifted back to the Hoovers, USAA cites\n\nBayle v. Allstate Insurance Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">615</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2010). In Bayle, a Katrina case, the\n\nFifth Circuit held that if the insurer “make[s] out a prima facie case that the cause of the\n\nuncompensated or under-compensated damage was excluded from coverage[,]” then “the\n\nburden shifts to the insured to present evidence demonstrating there remains a material issue\n\nof fact.” Id. at 359. USAA’s reliance on Bayle is unavailing, as that case applied Louisiana\n\nlaw. Id. USAA cites no authority under Mississippi law for the proposition that the burden\n\nof proof shifts back to the insured.\n\n¶13.   In Broussard v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"60392\"><a href=\"/opinion/60392/broussard-v-state-farm-fire-and-cas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 627 (5th Cir. 2008),\n\nthe same court noted that “[t]he Mississippi Supreme Court has not explicitly addressed the\n\n‘shifting back’ theory when considering an ‘open peril’ policy.” 6 In Broussard, State Farm\n\nargued, inter alia, that “under the dwelling coverage, once it advance[d] evidence to establish\n\n\n\n       6\n         See Eric M. Holmes, Appleman on Insurance § 192.09 (2d ed. 2008) (“‘Open peril’\ncoverage is . . . typical of coverage for dwellings and other structures on insured property .\n. . .”).\n\n                                              6\n\fits affirmative policy exclusion defenses, the burden shifts back to the Broussards to prove\n\nthat there is an exclusion to the defenses or to segregate covered from non-covered\n\ndamages.” Id. at 626. State Farm’s argument mirrored the one advanced by USAA in this\n\ncase. After a thorough examination of Mississippi caselaw, the Broussard court rejected\n\nState Farm’s “shifting back theory” as the rule in Missisissippi. Id. at 627. Appleman on\n\nInsurance refers to Broussard as “[t]he signature case on allocation of burden of proof for\n\nhurricane damages.” Eric M. Holmes, Appleman on Insurance § 192.09 (2d ed. 2008).\n\n¶14.   In Grace v. Lititz Mutual Insurance Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1699413\"><a href=\"/opinion/1699413/grace-v-lititz-mutual-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 219, 224-25 (Miss. 1972)\n\n(citing Commercial Union Insurance Co. v.

Broussard interpreted “State Farm’s ‘shifting back’ theory . . . to be the\n\nsort of ‘rule of law’ which would operate in many cases to take the issue of causation away\n\nfrom the jury.” Broussard, 523 F. 3d at 627. The Broussard court stated, “the ultimate\n\nallocation of wind and water damages under the Broussard’s dwelling coverage is a question\n\nof fact for the jury.” Id. This statement is consistent with this Court’s holding in Corban that\n\nthe issue of whether the damage was caused by wind or excluded storm surge is “a question\n\nof fact for the jury.” Corban, 20 So. 3d at 619.\n\n¶15.   The trial court’s finding that the Hoovers “should have put on something to show that\n\nit was other than surge” was erroneous and in conflict with this Court’s prior decisions,\n\n                                               7\n\fincluding Corban. USAA bears the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that\n\nthe loss was caused by, or concurrently contributed to, by an excluded peril. This issue of\n\nfact is one for the jury, and the burden of proof does not shift to the Hoovers.7 Therefore, the\n\ntrial court erred in granting a directed verdict as to the Hoover’s unpaid damages.\n\n       II.    Whether the trial judge erred by granting directed verdict in favor of\n              USAA regarding the Hoovers’ mental-anguish and emotional-distress\n              claims.\n\n¶16.   “[I]nsurers have a duty ‘to perform a prompt and adequate investigation and make a\n\nreasonable, good faith decision based on that investigation[,]” and failure to perform this duty\n\nmay render the insurer liable for extracontractual damages.

The\ninsured bears the burden of producing evidence to make out a prima facie case of a “direct,\nphysical loss to property described.” Corban, 20 So. 3d at 619. The insured also bears the\nburden of persuasion on this issue. The insurer bears the burden to produce evidence to\nsupport its affirmative defense “that the causes of the losses are excluded by the policy.” Id.\nThe insurer also bears the burden of persuasion on its affirmative defense.

The level of\n       negligence in conducting the investigation must be such that a proper\n       investigation by the insurer would easily adduce evidence showing its defenses\n       to be without merit.\n\nLisanby, 47 So. 3d at 1178 (quoting Windmon, 926 So. 2d at 872).\n\n¶17.   Citing Lisanby, the trial court granted USAA’s motion for directed verdict on the\n\nissue of mental anguish and emotional distress because “[USAA] had an arguable reason for\n\nthe denial of the claim.” The Hoovers argue that the trial court erred in granting directed\n\nverdict because “[USAA] failed to present any evidence that any investigation was conducted\n\nregarding the losses USAA alleged were excluded from coverage.”\n\n¶18.   On September 23, 2005, insurance adjuster Michael Long inspected the Hoovers’\n\nhome. According to Long’s report, “the dwelling sustained approximately 4 f[ee]t of water\n\ninside due to storm surge.” Long’s “estimate include[d] repairs only to damages [he] was\n\nclearly able to determine were due to wind.” Long determined that the roofs on the dwelling\n\nand cabana needed to be replaced, along with fencing and the back-yard playhouse. Long\n\nalso included interior water damage to the ceilings in his estimate. However, Long did not\n\ninclude damage to the pool liner “as it was not clear if wind caused the damage.” Long did\n\nnot establish a reserve for ALE.\n\n¶19.   On September 24, 2005, USAA hired an engineering firm, SEA, Ltd., to inspect the\n\nHoovers’ home. USAA’s request to SEA stated, in pertinent part, “[p]lease inspect and offer\n\n                                             9\n\fa professional opinion regarding causation, i.e., wind vs. flood surge. We need to know if\n\ndirect physical loss by wind contributed to the destruction and/or damage to the building. If\n\nyes, please identify the related building damage.” On October 2, 2005, SEA engineer Richard\n\nSchimizze conducted an inspection and submitted a detailed report to USAA.8 SEA opined\n\nthat\n\n       about 3 [feet] of floodwater had inundated the home. All material damage\n       located below the first-floor ceiling in the home was the result of the\n       floodwater and was clearly not related to the high winds. All damage to the\n       roofs of both structures was directly caused by the high winds of the storm.\n       Water damage at or above the first-floor ceiling in the home was indirectly\n       caused by the high winds that penetrated the enclosure and allowed rainwater\n       to enter the upper portions of the structure . . . . [T]he pool damage was caused\n       by the large volume of floodwater produced by the hurricane surge.\n\n¶20.   Thereafter, Dr. Hoover presented USAA with additional information pertinent to the\n\ncause of his loss that he requested USAA consider. Inter alia, Hoover sent USAA a weather\n\nreport from AccuWeather and the report of Dr. Ralph Sinno, which opined that the Hoovers’\n\nroof structure was damaged by wind, and he continued to seek payment for ALE. On each\n\noccasion, USAA forwarded the information to SEA and requested an updated report. SEA\n\nissued new reports which affirmed its initial opinion as to Hoovers’ damage and disputed Dr.\n\nSinno’s opinion that the roof structure had been damaged.\n\n¶21.   The record supports the trial court’s finding that USAA had an “arguable basis” for\n\ndenying a portion of the Hoovers’ damages. USAA relied on the investigation of its adjusters\n\n\n       8\n       The SEA report is dated January 25, 2006. However, the report indicates that its\nfindings were communicated verbally to Long on October 10, 2005, and to “Bill McNamara\nof USAA” on October 11, 2005.\n\n                                              10\n\fand the reports of SEA in denying certain aspects of the claim which were deemed excluded.\n\nAs such, the trial court did not err in granting a directed verdict on this issue.\n\n       III.   Whether the trial judge erred by granting a directed verdict in favor of\n              USAA regarding the Hoovers’ punitive-damages claims.\n\n¶22.   In order to recover punitive damages, the Hoovers “must show that [USAA] denied\n\nthe claim (1) without an arguable or legitimate basis, either in fact or law, and (2) with malice\n\nor gross negligence in disregard of the insured’s rights.” Broussard, 523 F. 3d at 628\n\n(quoting U.S. Fid. & Guar.

Rule 702 provides:\n\n       [i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of\n       fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness\n       qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,\n       may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony\n       is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of\n       reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles\n       and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\n\nMiss. R. Evid. 702 (emphasis added).\n\n¶25.   “[A]n expert’s qualification and reliability of testimony are separate questions.”\n\nRebelwood, 48 So. 3d at 494 (citing Bullock v. Lott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1709756\"><a href=\"/opinion/1709756/bullock-v-lott/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1119</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1129 (Miss. 2007)).\n\nOn this issue, USAA’s argument to the trial court and this Court revolves around the\n\n“reliability” of Dr. Sinno’s testimony, and not his qualifications.9 USAA challenged Dr.\n\nSinno’s testimony because he “[had] not done a technical structural inspection of [the]\n\nhouse.” Thus, USAA argues that Dr. Sinno’s testimony failed to meet the requirement of\n\nRule 702 in that it was not “based upon sufficient facts or data” and he did not “apply the\n\nprinciples and methods reliably to the facts of the case.” Miss. R. Evid. 702.\n\n¶26.   Dr. Sinno’s testimony reveals that he did not inspect the Hoovers’ home before\n\nissuing his report that the roof structure had been damaged and would require replacement.\n\n\n       9\n        The trial judge found Dr. Sinno was “eminently qualified” to testify. Dr. Sinno has\nhad a lengthy career in the field, including being a professor of engineering for twenty-four\nyears. He is a fellow with the American Society of Civil Engineering and has spent years\nresearching, testing, and writing on “wind loading.”\n\n                                               12\n\fBut, his testimony clearly exemplifies the basis of his knowledge and subsequent opinion.\n\nDr. Sinno had spent years researching “wind loading,” and in 2005 was the first “in the\n\nworld” to duplicate hurricane wind in the laboratory and study its effect on structures. He\n\ntestified, “everything I am going to talk about today is actually test results, test products, not\n\ntheory . . . .” Dr. Sinno possessed the information regarding wind velocities that the Hoover\n\nhome would have encountered, and based on his research regarding wind loading on\n\nstructures, he was qualified to give his opinion on the effects that winds would have had on\n\nthe Hoovers’ roof structure. Moreover, USAA cross-examined Dr. Sinno regarding his\n\nmethods, his findings, and the fact that he had never inspected the home prior to writing his\n\nreport. USAA also countered Dr. Sinno’s testimony with that of its own expert.\n\n¶27.   Although Dr. Sinno did not inspect the Hoover home prior to issuing his report, he did\n\ninspect it prior to testifying at trial. He testified that the findings of his inspection supported\n\nthe conclusion of his report. Because his report was not admitted as evidence, USAA can\n\nonly claim that his testimony at trial was not based on sufficient facts or data. The fact that\n\nDr. Sinno did inspect the house prior to testifying negates USAA’s argument that his\n\ntestimony lacked a sufficient basis because he failed to inspect. Therefore, the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in allowing Dr. Sinno’s testimony on this issue.\n\n       V.      Whether the trial judge erred in allowing Sinno to testify as to the cost\n               of replacing the roof structure.\n\n¶28.   On this issue, USAA challenges both Dr. Sinno’s qualifications and reliability. First,\n\nUSAA argues that Dr. Sinno is not an expert on the cost to repair residential roofs. On voir\n\n\n                                                13\n\fdire, Dr. Sinno testified that, as an engineering professor, he taught classes in which\n\ncurriculum included construction-cost estimation, itemizing costing and other kinds of\n\ncosting, inter alia. His qualifications as a structural engineer were properly presented to the\n\ntrial court. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion by allowing Dr. Sinno to provide\n\nexpert testimony as to the cost to replace the roof structure.\n\n¶29.   Second, USAA argues that Dr. Sinno did not have a reliable basis based on the facts\n\nof the case to form his opinion as to the cost to replace the roof. Specifically, USAA argues\n\nthat Dr. Sinno “fail[ed] to include essential facts” such as “board feet of lumber, pounds of\n\nnails, man hours,” etc. Dr. Sinno testified that he used a cost-plus estimate based on known\n\nvalues to arrive at his calculations. He assessed that it would cost $40 per square foot to\n\nreplace the roof, and multiplied this by the total square footage of the house. Although this\n\nwas not the method USAA suggests he should have used, Dr. Sinno nonetheless used an\n\naccepted method for estimating the cost to repair the roof. Moreover, USAA cross-examined\n\nDr. Sinno about this method of determining cost. The trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin concluding that Dr. Sinno was qualified to provide expert testimony as to the cost to repair\n\nthe Hoovers’ roof, and that his method was based on sufficient facts to meet the requirements\n\nor Rule 702.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n¶30.   Based on this analysis, the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard and\n\nimproperly shifted the burden of proof to the Hoovers. We reverse the trial court’s grant of\n\na directed verdict as to the unpaid damages, and remand the case for a jury to determine\n\n                                              14\n\fwhether USAA proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the unpaid loss was caused\n\nby excluded storm surge. The trial court did not err in directing a verdict for USAA as to the\n\nHoovers’ claims for mental anguish, emotional distress, and punitive damages. Therefore,\n\non direct appeal, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. The trial court did not err in\n\nadmitting the expert testimony of Dr. Sinno as to whether the roof structure was damaged or\n\nthe cost to repair such damage. Therefore, on cross-appeal, we affirm.\n\n¶31. ON DIRECT APPEAL: AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND\nREMANDED.

COLEMAN, J., DISSENTS WITH SEPARATE WRITTEN OPINION\nJOINED BY DICKINSON, P.J. WALLER, C.J., NOT PARTICIPATING.\n\n       DICKINSON, PRESIDING JUSTICE, DISSENTING:\n\n¶32.   The majority incorrectly concludes that the trial judge “improperly shifted the burden\n\nof proof to the Hoovers.” This did not happen. To say that the “burden of proof” never\n\nleaves the party asserting a claim or defense is not to say that the defending party never has\n\na burden.\n\n¶33.   The burden of proof is actually divided into two burdens or parts: The burden to\n\nproduce evidence, and the burden to persuade. The trial of an issue – whether a claim or\n\ndefense – proceeds in three stages. In stage one, the party asserting a claim or defense has\n\nthe burden of producing enough credible evidence to establish a prima facie case for the\n\nclaim or defense.\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f¶34.   Once this burden – which never moves from the party asserting the claim or defense\n\n– is met, the trial of the issue moves to stage two, in which the defending party has the\n\nburden of producing evidence sufficient to create a jury issue. When a defending party fails\n\nto meet this burden – that is, fails to produce evidence sufficient to create a jury issue – the\n\nparty asserting the claim or defense is entitled to a directed verdict on the claim or defense.\n\n¶35.   Finally, during stage three, the party asserting the claim or defense has the burden of\n\npersuading the jury that the evidence supports the claim or defense by the applicable\n\nstandard, whether preponderance of the evidence, clear and convincing evidence, or beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.\n\n¶36.   USAA asserted a defense, claiming that a policy exclusion applied. During stage one,\n\nit certainly produced sufficient evidence to support the defense. During stage two, the\n\nHoovers not only failed to produce evidence sufficient to create a jury issue as to USAA’s\n\ndefense, they failed to produce any evidence at all. Therefore, the issue never made it to\n\nstage three.\n\n¶37.   The trial judge, who clearly recognized that USAA had the burden of proof correctly\n\nobserved that – because USAA had produced sufficient, competent, credible evidence to\n\nsupport its policy exclusion – it had, as a matter of law, met its burden of proof, absent some\n\ncontrary proof from the Hoovers. The trial judge’s position is perfectly supported by the\n\nFifth Circuit’s opinion in Bayle v. Allstate Insurance Co.10\n\n\n\n       10\n            Bayle v. Allstate Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">615</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 359 (5th Cir. 2010).\n\n                                               16\n\f¶38.   Had the Hoovers met their burden of production – that is, had they come forward with\n\ncontrary proof – a jury issue would have been created, and the issue would have been\n\nsubmitted to the jury for decision. But the burden of persuasion still would have been on\n\nUSAA. The majority forgets that USAA always had the burden of producing proof sufficient\n\nto establish a prima facie case, and it confuses the Hoovers’ burden of producing evidence\n\nin order to create a jury issue, with USAA’s burden of persuasion.\n\n¶39.   Justice Coleman’s opinion – that the Hoovers’ failure to produce any contrary\n\nevidence properly resulted in a directed verdict on the issue – is exactly correct, under the\n\nfacts of this case. But I wish to point out that there may be cases where the evidence\n\nsupporting an exclusion presented by the insurance company is so thin and lacking in\n\ncredibility that a trial judge would be justified in submitting its credibility to the jury, even\n\nin the absence of contrary evidence. Stated another way, a policyholder may demonstrate\n\nthat a jury question has been created in two ways: (1) by producing contrary evidence, or (2)\n\nby persuading the trial judge that the jury should be allowed to decide whether the insurance\n\ncompany’s uncontradicted evidence is so lacking in credibility that it ought to be rejected.\n\nIn either case, the burden to produce evidence establishing a prima facie case, and the burden\n\nof persuasion remains always with an insurance company as to its affirmative defenses.\n\n       COLEMAN, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n\n       COLEMAN, JUSTICE, DISSENTING:\n\n¶40.   Burden of proof is a broad phrase, and its meaning encompasses at least two subsets\n\n– the burden of persuasion and the burden of production. The majority’s analysis and result\n\n                                               17\n\fwould be correct were the issue in the case the burden of persuasion – which never left\n\nUSAA as to its affirmative defense. However, the burden of production did indeed move to\n\nthe plaintiff once USAA produced competent evidence supporting its affirmative defense.\n\nBecause I believe the majority wrongly conflates the two different burdens in a way that\n\nleads to an incorrect result and statement of the law, I respectfully dissent.\n\n¶41.   There exist at least two categories of burdens of proof, “the device to compel evidence\n\nand the device to deal with uncertainty,” and until the end of the nineteenth century courts\n\nindeed referred to both with the single phrase “burden of proof.” See 21B Charles Alan\n\nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure, Evidence § 5122 (2d ed. 1987).11\n\nHowever, in later decades various terms emerged for them as it became clear that distinction\n\nbetween the two indeed had a difference. Id. “One burden is that of producing evidence,\n\nsatisfactory to the judge, of a particular fact in issue. The second is the burden of persuading\n\nthe trier of fact that the alleged fact is true.” McCormick on Evidence § 336 (Kenneth S.\n\nBroun, et al., eds., 7th ed. 2013).\n\n\n\n       11\n          We often cite with approval Wright and Miller’s encyclopedic work on federal civil\nprocedure.

Finding\na paucity of cases from our own state’s jurisprudence explaining the difference, I now turn\nto their thorough treatment of the history and practical effects of burdens of proof and\npresumptions.\n\n                                              18\n\f¶42.   We ascribe standards of proof to the burden of persuasion, e.g., beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt and by a preponderance of the evidence, because in doing so courts and legislatures\n\ncan match the difficulty of the burden to the importance of any public policies that might be\n\naffected. 21B Fed. Prac. & Proc., Evid. § 5122 (2d ed. 1987). The standards of proof reflect\n\nthat one party – usually the plaintiff but the defendant in most affirmative defenses – must\n\npersuade the trier of fact of the truth of disputed facts to the assigned degree. Id.\n\n¶43.   The burden of production, on the other hand, differs significantly in nature. It “refers\n\nto the obligation of the party to produce enough evidence at trial to justify sending the case\n\nto the jury.” Id. “The party who fails to satisfy [the burden of production] will be sanctioned\n\nby the court’s entry of a directed verdict in favor of her opponent.” Id.; see also McCormick\n\non Evidence § 336 (Kenneth S. Broun, et al., eds., 7th ed. 2013) (“The burden of producing\n\nevidence is a critical mechanism in a jury trial, as it empowers the judge to decide the case\n\nwithout jury consideration when a party fails to sustain the burden.”). Wright and Miller list\n\nthe following distinctions between the burdens of persuasion and production:\n\n       • The burden of production is in the hands of the judge; the jury enforces the\n         burden of persuasion.\n\n       • The sanction for failure to carry the burden of production is a directed\n         verdict for the adversary; the sanction for failure to carry the burden of\n         persuasion is a jury verdict for the opposing party.\n\n       • The judge must instruct the jury on the burden of persuasion; the jury never\n         need hear about the burden of production.\n\n       • The burden of production can arise each time the party with the production\n         burden rests which may be several times during the trial; the burden of\n\n\n                                              19\n\f          persuasion comes into play only once—when the case is submitted to the\n          jury.\n\n       • Since it can only arise once, it is sometimes said that the burden of\n         persuasion never shifts. On the other hand, writers suppose that the burden\n         of production can shift back and forth as the parties take turns introducing\n         evidence. . . .\n\n       • Finally, the two burdens of proof are related in that the burden of production\n         normally falls on the party with the burden of persuasion. On the other\n         hand, unless the burden of production is satisfied, the burden of persuasion\n         will never arise because the judge will take the case from the jury.\n\n21B Fed. Prac. & Proc., Evid. § 5122 (2d ed. 1987) (citations omitted).\n\n¶44.   “It is recognized that as to any given issue the burden of persuasion and the burden\n\nof production of evidence generally both fall on the same party at the beginning of trial, that\n\nthe burden of persuasion does not thereafter shift, but that the burden of production may shift\n\nback and forth as each side produces evidence, takes advantage of presumptions or the like.”\n\nSimpson v. Home Petroleum Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457087\"><a href=\"/opinion/457087/jerry-k-simpson-v-home-petroleum-corporation-and-home-oil-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">770</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 503 (5th Cir. 1985). “[I]t is everywhere\n\nagreed that the other burden, i.e., the burden of producing evidence . . . , may and often does\n\nshift back and forth between the parties like a tennis ball in play . . . .” Id. (quoting Ray,\n\nTexas Law of Evidence § 46 (3rd ed. 1980)).\n\n¶45.   As noted above, not many Mississippi cases discuss the distinction between the\n\nburdens of production and persuasion, but our courts have not left the tablet wholly blank.\n\nWe have, for example, used the two phrases in a manner consistent with the above discussion\n\nin cases involving will contests. In Clardy v. National Bank of Commerce of Mississippi,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1816966\"><a href=\"/opinion/1816966/clardy-v-national-bank-of-commerce/\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Miss. 1989), we wrote:\n\n\n                                              20\n\f       Once the proponent has shouldered his burden of production such that he has\n       made out a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the contestants.\n       What is critical for present purposes is that the burden of persuading the trier\n       of fact on the issues of due execution and testamentary capacity rests on\n       proponent throughout and never shifts to the contestants.\n\nId. at 66. The idea of having two types of burden of proof – one which shifts and the other\n\nwhich cannot – is not wholly new to Mississippi law.12\n\n¶46.   Turning to the case sub judice, I agree with the majority’s analysis as applied to the\n\nburden of persuasion, but I disagree that the burden of production does not shift. In holding\n\nthat Mississippi prohibits burden-shifting, the majority relies upon the following language\n\nfrom Corban v. United Services Automobile Association, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1560116\"><a href=\"/opinion/1560116/corban-v-united-services-auto-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Miss. 2009):\n\n       This Court finds that with respect to the “all-risk” coverage of “Coverage\n       A-Dwelling” and “Coverage B-Other Structures,” the Corbans are required to\n       prove a “direct, physical loss to property described.” Thereafter, USAA\n       assumes the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the\n       causes of the losses are excluded by the policy, in this case, “[flood] damage.”\n       USAA is obliged to indemnify the Corbans for all losses under “Coverage\n       A-Dwelling” and “Coverage B-Other Structures” which USAA cannot\n       establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been caused or\n       concurrently contributed to by “[flood] damage.”\n\nId. at 619 (¶ 51). It is clear that the Corban Court, in writing about the burden of proving\n\nfacts by a “preponderance of the evidence” referred to what has come to be known over the\n\npast century or more as the burden of persuasion, discussed above. Standards of proof do not\n\napply to the burden of production. 21B Fed. Prac. & Proc., Evid. § 5122 (2d ed. 1987).\n\n\n       12\n         Accordingly, elucidating the distinctions is not a mere scholarly pursuit based only\non federal civil procedure, but it is a more full explication of something that already exists,\nobscured in the background though it may be, in our state’s jurisprudence and must be fully\nunderstood to reach the correct holding in the case sub judice.\n\n                                              21\n\f¶47.   With respect, the majority again misses the importance of the distinction when it\n\nrefuses to find persuasive the Fifth Circuit’s opinion in Bayle v. Allstate Insurance Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">615</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2010). Clearly, when the Bayle Court wrote that the burden shifted to the\n\ninsured “to present evidence demonstrating there remain[s] a material issue of fact,” Id. at\n\n359 (emphasis added), it wrote of the burden of producing evidence and not the burden of\n\npersuading the finder of fact.\n\n¶48.   The majority incorrectly writes that the argument of State Farm in Broussard v. State\n\nFarm Fire and Casualty Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"60392\"><a href=\"/opinion/60392/broussard-v-state-farm-fire-and-cas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2008), mirrored that of USAA here.\n\nIn Broussard, the trial court granted a directed verdict against State Farm, and State Farm\n\nargued that it had produced evidence that created an issue of fact. Id. at 625. State Farm was\n\nnot arguing that it had met its burden of production and that the plaintiffs had failed to\n\nproduce evidence creating an issue of fact, which is USAA’s argument in the instant case.\n\nIn any event, when making its Erie guess regarding the correct burdens of proof, the\n\nBroussard Court relied on “the rule that causation is a fact question for the jury.”\n\nBroussard, 523 F.3d at 627. Accordingly, the Broussard Court concerned itself primarily\n\nwith the burden of persuasion. The jury never concerns itself with the burden of production.\n\n21B Fed. Prac. & Proc., Evid. § 5122 (2d ed. 1987).\n\n¶49.   When the trial judge stated his understanding that “the plaintiff should have to had to\n\nput on something to show it was other than surge,” he was not incorrectly reassigning the\n\nburden of persuasion. He did not say he would require the plaintiffs to convince the jury by\n\na preponderance of the evidence that conflicting evidence showed the damage was caused\n\n                                             22\n\fby something other than surge. Rather, he was correctly observing that when the insurer\n\nprovided credible proof of causation, the burden of production of evidence moved to the\n\nplaintiff to create an issue of fact.

Because the plaintiff failed to produce competent, contrary\n\nevidence, there existed no disputed facts as to which the trier of fact needed to be persuaded\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence. The trial court correctly analyzed that the plaintiffs had\n\nnot done so, that no issues of material fact existed for the jury, and entered judgment in favor\n\nof the insurer as required by law.\n\n¶50.
