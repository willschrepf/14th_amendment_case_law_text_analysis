BAIN,                                   H037452\n                                                 (Santa Clara County\n        Plaintiff and Appellant,                  Super. Ct. No. CV112065)\n\n        v.\n\nTAX REDUCERS, INC.,\n\n        Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n\n        Defendant and appellant Tax Reducers, Inc. (TRI), appeals from a judgment after\na court trial in which the court awarded plaintiff and respondent Harold Bain damages for\nunpaid wages (Lab. Code §§ 202, 203, 1194, & 1194.2)1 and for breach of contract based\non a judicially supervised settlement of Bain‟s wage claim. TRI argues that the court\nerred when it (1) held that Bain‟s statutory wage claims were not barred by the statute of\nlimitations; (2) applied the presumption that every person who performs services is\npresumed to be an employee; and (3) imposed statutory penalties pursuant to both\nsections 203 and 1194.2.\n\n\n\n\n        1\n         All further statutory references are to the Labor Code, unless otherwise stated.\nSections 203 and 1194.2 were amended after Bain left TRI. (Stats 2008, ch. 169, § 2;\nStats 2011, ch. 272, § 2; see Historical and Statutory Notes, 44 West‟s Ann. Lab. Code\n(2011 ed.) foll. § 203, p. 335 & 44B West‟s Ann. Lab. Code (2013 supp.) foll. § 1194.2,\np. 7.) The amendments do not affect our analysis. All further references to sections 203\nand 1194.2 are to the statutory language in effect when Bain left TRI in February 2005.\n\f       Bain filed a cross-appeal challenging the court‟s rulings that James Brooks Griffin,\nTRI‟s president and majority shareholder, could not be held personally liable for Bain‟s\nwage claims.\n       On TRI‟s appeal, we hold that Bain‟s statutory wage claims under sections 202,\n203, and 1194, which are subject to a three-year limitations period, were not time-barred\nbecause the limitations period was equitably tolled while Bain pursued his administrative\nclaim before the Labor Commissioner. We conclude, however, that Bain‟s claim for the\nstatutory penalty for failure to pay minimum wages under section 1194.2 was time-barred\nbecause it is subject to a one-year limitations period and Bain‟s complaint was not filed\nwithin one year of the date the action before the Labor Commissioner became final.\nSince Bain‟s claim for the section 1194.2 penalty was time barred, we hold the trial court\nerred when it imposed that penalty. We do not reach TRI‟s other contentions regarding\nthe section 1194.2 penalty. We also hold that substantial evidence supports the trial\ncourt‟s finding that Bain was an employee under the multi-factor test in S. G. Borello &\nSons, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations (1989) 48 Cal.3d 341 (S. G. Borello) and\nthat there was no prejudicial error in the court‟s use of the presumption of employment.\nAnd we conclude that the trial court did not err in imposing a section 203 penalty for\nTRI‟s failure to timely pay final wages upon Bain‟s resignation.\n       On Bain‟s cross-appeal, we agree with the trial court that Griffin could not be held\npersonally liable for Bain‟s wage claims; thus, the trial court did not err when it denied\nBain‟s motion to amend the complaint to add Griffin as a defendant. Bain has also\nappealed the court‟s orders relating to attorney fees, which we discuss in a separate\nopinion filed concurrently herewith in Case No. H038002.\n       For the reasons stated below, we will modify the judgment to strike the $7,700\nawarded to Bain as a penalty under section 1194.2. As so modified, we will affirm the\njudgment.\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f                                         FACTS2\n\nDescription of TRI\n\n      TRI provides tax preparation and bookkeeping services to individuals and\nbusinesses. James Brooks Griffin has been the president and chief executive officer of\nTRI since 1997; Griffin owns two-thirds of the company‟s shares. TRI had three offices\nin Santa Clara County and decided to expand by purchasing another tax preparation\npractice. In December 2004, TRI purchased a tax preparation and accounting service in\nLos Altos known as Conard and Associates, which was owned by Paul Conard. Harold\nBain worked for Conard from April 2002 until December 31, 2004. Since TRI agreed to\nbring Bain on in the same capacity as he worked for Conard, it is necessary to describe\nBain‟s professional history with Conard as it relates to the question whether Bain was an\nemployee or an independent contractor when he worked for TRI.\n\nBain’s Working Relationship With Conard & Associates\n\n      Before going to work for Conard, Bain worked as an accountant. He attended\ntraining classes in tax preparation offered by the Voluntary Income Tax Assistance\n(VITA) program3 and helped people do their taxes as a VITA volunteer, but he did not\nhave a tax preparation business before working for Conard.\n      Bain did not bring any fee-paying clients with him when he started working for\nConard, but he had a “couple” of friends, whose taxes he had previously done for free,\nwho became Conard‟s clients. Bain did not have tax clients of his own while he worked\nfor Conard or TRI. The only outside “client” Bain had was the Los Altos Masonic\n\n\n      2\n         Except as otherwise noted, the facts are based on evidence presented at trial.\n      3\n         Although the program name suggests the acronym “VITA,” Bain used the\nacronym “VITAN” at trial. We shall use the acronym “VITA,” which is consistent with\nthe program name.\n\n                                            3\n\fTemple Association (LAMTA). Bain did LAMTA‟s tax return as part of his duties as a\nmember of its board.\n       When Bain started working for Conard, they agreed that he would be an\nindependent contractor and that Conard would pay him $1,100 for 32 hours of work per\nweek. If Bain worked less than 32 hours in a week, Conard paid him on an hourly basis,\nbased on the $1,100 weekly rate ($1,100 per week ÷ 32 hours = $34.38 per hour). If Bain\nworked 32 hours or more a week, Conard paid him the $1,100 weekly salary. Initially,\nBain prepared an invoice for Conard and was paid every two weeks. Conard did not\nmake any withholdings from Bain‟s pay and reported Bain‟s income as “non-employee\ncompensation” on a 1099 form. Since Conard issued him a 1099 form, Bain reported his\nincome to the IRS on a Schedule C (Profit or Loss From Business) form. Bain and\nConard did not have a written agreement describing their relationship.\n       While working for Conard, Bain went through the examination and investigation\nprocess necessary to become an “enrolled agent” with the IRS. After obtaining that\ncertificate, Bain was authorized to appear before the IRS. Bain‟s status as an enrolled\nagent did not require that he work as an independent contractor.\n       Bain‟s duties at Conard and Associates evolved over time and eventually included\nsetting up and dissolving corporations, and consulting on and maintaining computer\nnetworks. Bain helped Conard with advertising, pricing, hiring employees, and selecting\nclients; he managed the office when Conard was gone.\n       In the summer of 2004, Bain and Conard attended a seminar on the tax\nimplications of using employees versus independent contractors. During the seminar,\nthey both realized that Bain was actually an employee of Conard and Associates, not an\nindependent contractor. They agreed to continue their relationship as usual until the end\nof 2004 and that Conard would begin withholding taxes and treating Bain as an employee\nbeginning January 1, 2005. On July 9, 2004, Bain stopped giving Conard invoices for his\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\fservices and began reporting his time on the same time sheet used by Conard‟s\nemployees.\n\nBain’s Working Relationship with TRI\n\n       In December 2004, one month before the date Conard had agreed to begin treating\nBain as an employee, Bain and Conard‟s other two employees learned that Conard had\nsold his practice to TRI. They were worried about their jobs, so they asked Bain to\nrepresent them at a meeting with the new owner and to ask whether they would still have\njobs after January 1, 2005.\n       Bain met with Griffin in mid-December 2004. At that meeting, Griffin told Bain\nthey would all have jobs after January 1, 2005, and would be paid the same as before.\nGriffin said he had no interest in terminating the others, but said he was not sure he\nwould be able to retain Bain past tax season because he thought Bain was too expensive.\nBain made a suggestion for increasing revenue to justify keeping him on. Bain and\nGriffin did not discuss whether Bain would be an independent contractor or an employee.\n       After TRI acquired Conard and Associates, Bain and the other former Conard\nemployees continued working in the same office space Conard had occupied. By January\n2, 2005, no one had received a job application from TRI. That day, Bain put together a\npacket consisting of a W-4 form (withholding certificate), an I-9 immigration form\n(Employment Eligibility Verification), and copies of his enrolled agent certificate, his\nsocial security card, and his passport. Bain placed the packet on Griffin‟s desk. Griffin\ndenied receiving those documents.\n       In January 2005, Bain attended at least three meetings with Griffin and other staff\nin which Griffin presented new tax software, demonstrated the software, and gave a\npresentation on TRI, describing the Conard acquisition as a “high end tax preparation\noffice.” Bain went to the same meetings as other staff members, as Griffin told Bain to\nattend all staff meetings.\n\n                                             5\n\f       Griffin testified that tax preparation was the essential function of TRI‟s business.\nBain‟s duties at TRI included preparing tax returns, bookkeeping services for clients,\ncomputer network maintenance, meeting with prospective new clients, researching tax\nquestions, training other staff, attending continuing education meetings, answering\nphones, assembling tax returns, and filing.\n       After they started working for TRI, Griffin instructed Bain and the other former\nConard employees to continue using the same weekly time sheets they had used while\nworking for Conard. On the time sheets, the staff recorded the total number of hours\nworked each day, as well as information about the specific tasks accomplished, for both\ntime that was billable to clients and non-billable time. The billable time entries included\nthe name of the client, the type of task performed, the date, and the amount of time\nattributable to each task. Thus, the time sheets were used both as a time card and to\nrecord information that was used to bill clients. Bain and the other staff members\nrecorded their time daily and turned their time sheets in to Griffin weekly. Bain never\ninvoiced TRI separately for his time. TRI paid the other staff members, but not Bain,\nevery two weeks beginning in mid-January 2005.\n       After TRI acquired Conard and Associates, Bain no longer performed\nmanagement functions; those were assumed by Griffin. Bain testified that Griffin was his\nsupervisor. Griffin testified that he controlled how the Los Altos office operated. In\naddition, all the tax returns Bain prepared were reviewed by TRI‟s night auditor, who\nreviewed the work done by all of TRI‟s tax preparers. After the night auditor reviewed\nBain‟s returns, he left a list of things that needed to be corrected or researched further.\nGriffin told Bain that he had to follow the auditor‟s instructions until he and the auditor\ncame to a mutual resolution of the issues involved.\n       Bain did not operate an independent tax business while working for TRI. He did\nnot maintain a separate office for a tax preparation business, advertise his tax preparation\nservices, have his own website, have his own employees, or buy errors and omissions\n\n                                              6\n\fcoverage. TRI provided Bain with a business card. Bain worked for TRI on TRI‟s\npremises. TRI established the office hours (8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m.) and Griffin told the\nstaff he expected them to be in the office during those times. According to his time\nsheets, Bain generally started work between 7:30 and 8:30 a.m. and left between 4:00 and\n5:30 p.m. During the seven weeks Bain worked for TRI, he took one sick day, plus time\noff for a doctor‟s appointment and for personal business; each time, he discussed the\ntime-off request with Griffin. Bain did not pay for the office space he used at TRI. TRI\ngave Bain a set of keys to the office, just like it did other employees. When expanding\nhis business, Conard did not have a lot of money, so Bain lent him a desk, a chair, a wall\nunit, and a printer stand, which Bain used in his office. Bain continued to use his own\noffice furniture after TRI purchased the practice. Bain purchased his own keyboard and\ncomputer mouse, which he preferred over the ones Conard provided. TRI owned the rest\nof the office furniture, the computers, the photocopier, the filing cabinets, and the phones.\nTRI provided all of the office supplies.\n       TRI controlled which clients Bain saw. Griffin took over at least one individual\nclient that Bain had previously handled; he told Bain that he wanted him to work\nprimarily on corporate and partnership returns and more complex individual returns. TRI\nestablished the rate schedule and billed the clients. However, the tax preparers\ndetermined which rate to charge from the schedule, based on the scope and breadth of the\nservices provided.\n       At the end of January 2005, Bain asked Griffin when he would be paid. On\nFebruary 5, 2005, Griffin left an independent contractor agreement on Bain‟s desk. The\nagreement proposed paying Bain $27.50 per hour (less than what Conard had paid) and\nterminating Bain‟s services on June 30, 2005. Bain believed he was an employee and\nGriffin was trying to change his status from employee to independent contractor. Bain\nfound the agreement unacceptable and returned it to Griffin with a note that stated, “Let‟s\ndo employee status without a ten percent reduction.” Later, Bain and Griffin discussed\n\n                                             7\n\fthe independent contractor agreement. Griffin explained that he got the $27.50 hourly\nrate by dividing Bain‟s weekly rate ($1,100) by 40 hours. Bain explained that his pay\nwas based on a 32-hour week and told Griffin that he was supposed to be an employee,\nnot an independent contractor. Griffin said he would discuss the matter with Conard.\n       Bain resigned from TRI on Friday, February 18, 2005. In his resignation letter,\nBain stated that since TRI had failed to pay him for seven weeks and failed to reimburse\nhim for expenses he had submitted, Bain did not “feel it necessary to give the customary\ntwo week notice.” Bain told Griffin he would remove his belongings from the office by\nSunday, February 20, 2005.\n       Griffin responded to Bain‟s letter in writing on February 19, 2005. Griffin\npresented Bain with a modified independent contractor agreement in which he agreed to\npay Bain $1,100 per week for seven weeks of work. Griffin‟s letter stated that before\nTRI would pay Bain, Bain would have to sign the modified independent contractor\nagreement and to provide information about work in progress, a missing client file, and\nthe segregation of TRI software from Bain‟s personal software. Griffin left the letter and\nthe modified agreement on Bain‟s desk. Bain saw the letter and the agreement on\nFebruary 20, 2005. Bain did not sign the modified agreement because he believed it\nchanged his employment conditions retroactively and restricted his ability to work.\n       On March 1, 2005, Bain filed a claim for his unpaid wages and expenses with the\nCalifornia Labor Commissioner. On March 17, 2005, Bain sent TRI a letter demanding\nhis unpaid wages and expenses. On March 23, 2005, Griffin sent Bain a letter stating that\nTRI‟s offer to pay $7,700 in wages “still stands.” But, Griffin did not tender a check.\nTRI has never paid Bain for his work. Griffin testified he never paid Bain because they\ncould not reach an agreement for him to be paid.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f                                 PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       Because of the statute of limitations issues presented, including the question of\nequitable tolling, we shall describe the complex procedural history of this case.\n\nProceedings Before the Labor Commissioner\n\n       In his complaint before the Labor Commissioner, Bain claimed $7,700 in unpaid\nwages, $157.26 for unpaid expenses, and $6,600 in waiting time penalties ($220 per day\nfor 30 days; § 203), plus interest. Bain represented himself in the proceedings before the\nLabor Commissioner.\n       TRI filed a written response, which alleged that Bain was not entitled to wages or\npenalties because he was never an employee and because his “sole relationship to [TRI]\nwas business to business.” TRI alleged Bain never filled out an employment application\nor W-4 forms and refused to sign an independent contractor agreement. Griffin admitted\nthat TRI had several employees and that Bain was the only one he considered to be\nworking as an independent contractor. TRI argued that even if Bain was an employee,\nthe parties never agreed to an amount to be paid as wages and that Bain was therefore\n“entitled to minimum wage and no more.” TRI contended that Bain was not entitled to\npenalties under section 203 because he was never an employee and had “rebuffed\nmultiple attempts to finalize the contract and get paid.” TRI also argued that it would be\n“unconscionable” to allow Bain to “profit . . . from his intransigence” and urged the\ndepartment to “decline to intervene in this contractual dispute.”\n       The Labor Commissioner conducted a hearing on March 9, 2006, more than a year\nafter Bain filed his claim. Griffin appeared on behalf of TRI at the hearing and gave Bain\na check for $157.26 to cover his business expenses. The hearing officer found that\nalthough TRI considered Bain an independent contractor, Bain did not meet the criteria\nestablished in section 2750.5 for independent contractor status, and concluded that the\n\n\n                                             9\n\fparties had an employer-employee relationship. The hearing officer awarded Bain\n$7,700 “for wages (with lawful deductions),” $805.86 in interest (§ 98.1), and $6,600 in\nwaiting time penalties (§ 203), for a total award of $15,105.86.\n\nFirst Action in the Superior Court (TRI’s Appeal of Labor Commissioner’s Decision)\n\n       TRI retained counsel and appealed the Labor Commissioner‟s decision to the\nsuperior court (Santa Clara County Superior Court Case No. 1-06-CV063080). Although\nlabeled an “appeal,” the proceedings in the superior court are actually a trial de novo, in\nwhich the decision of the Labor Commissioner is not entitled to any weight. (Murphy v.\nKenneth Cole Productions, Inc. (2007) 40 Cal.4th 1094, 1116 (Murphy).) As required by\nsection 98.2, subdivision (b), TRI deposited $15,105.86 (the amount of the Labor\nCommissioner‟s award) with the superior court. Bain retained counsel of his own and the\ncase was initially set for trial on July 24, 2006.\n\n       Efforts to Settle in July 2006\n\n       In July 2006, the parties agreed to settle the case for $9,791, which included\n$7,700 for Bain‟s wage claim, $1,000 for attorney fees, and $1,091 in interest. TRI gave\nnotice of the settlement to the court and the trial date was vacated. Later, however, they\nwere unable to agree on the scope and terms of a written release. The parties disputed\nwhether the settlement included a release of all claims or just the wage claim that was\nadjudicated before the Labor Commissioner. There were additional issues between the\nparties, including a non-competition claim and a defamation claim by Bain, which was\nbased on things Griffin said about Bain after he left TRI. At one point, Bain offered to\nexecute a general release of all claims in exchange for an additional $1,250 and TRI‟s\npromise not to contest his status as an employee in response to inquiries about his\nemployment. TRI never agreed to those terms.\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f       Judicially Supervised Settlement in December 2006\n\n       After settlement failed, the case was re-set for trial on December 11, 2006. On the\nfirst day of trial, the parties settled the case in a judicially supervised proceeding. The\nterms of the settlement were placed on the record, as follows: “Case will be settled by\nthe defendant making a total payment of $17,700. The parties will provide mutual\ngeneral releases including [Civil Code section] 1542 releases to the parties and the\nofficers, employees, attorneys, agent, etc. anyone, anyone acting on behalf of either of the\nparties.” The parties stipulated to an order for the immediate release of the bond. TRI\nagreed to make two payments by January 31, 2007 of $7,700 to Bain and $10,000 to\nBain‟s attorney. The parties agreed that the payments would be made “without deduction\nfor taxes or withholdings. And Mr. Bain will indemnify the company against any tax\nclaims.” TRI agreed that if it is “contacted and requested to confirm Mr. Bain‟s having\nworked there, the company will confirm that Mr. Bain worked with the company in\nJanuary and February of 2005 and that he was paid $1,100 a week.” Both Bain and\nGriffin agreed to the terms of the settlement on the record. The court told TRI how to\nobtain release of the bond money and set the case for a dismissal review hearing on\nFebruary 8, 2007. The court did not retain jurisdiction over the settlement.\n\n       Release of the Bond, Problems With the Written Release, & Dismissal of the\n       Action\n\n       On or about December 29, 2006, the court issued TRI a check for $15,532.34 (the\namount deposited with the court, plus interest). Although TRI expected Bain to sign a\nwritten release as part of the settlement, TRI‟s counsel did not prepare a release any time\nprior to January 31, 2007, the date agreed upon for payment of the settlement proceeds.\nGriffin said he expected Bain‟s counsel to prepare the release, even though the parties\nhad not agreed to that, because Griffin did not want to pay his lawyer to do it.\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f       TRI‟s counsel forwarded a proposed release agreement to Bain‟s counsel in March\n2007 and the parties disputed the language of that release for a number of months. On\nJanuary 10, 2008, Bain‟s counsel prepared a proposed release and forwarded it to TRI‟s\ncounsel. Although Griffin testified that the January 2008 release was consistent with the\nterms of the settlement that had been placed on the record, he stated he never saw that\nrelease. But Griffin testified that he would not have signed the January 2008 release\nbecause it was “invalid” since it required payment by January 31, 2007, a date that had\nlong passed. This became a point of contention between the attorneys. TRI‟s attorney\ndemanded that the term requiring tender of the $17,700 by January 31, 2007 be changed\nto “within 10 days of execution” of the release by Bain. Bain‟s attorney agreed to do so\nif TRI paid Bain interest from January 31, 2007; otherwise, he would file a motion to\nenforce the settlement agreement under Civil Code section 664.6. TRI refused to pay\ninterest, arguing that Bain would not be awarded interest if the court ordered enforcement\nof the settlement agreement.\n       Bain‟s counsel later determined that the case had been dismissed at the dismissal\nreview hearing on February 8, 2007, and that the court no longer had jurisdiction to\nenforce the settlement under Civil Code section 664.6. Bain therefore sought to enforce\nthe settlement by filing a second action in the superior court.\n\nSecond Action in the Superior Court (Bain’s Action to Obtain Monies Owed)\n\n       Pre-trial Proceedings\n\n       Bain filed the instant action on May 7, 2008. The complaint contained causes of\naction to enforce the December 2006 judicially supervised settlement, for breach of\ncontract based on that settlement, for money had and received, to recover wages based on\nviolations of the Labor Code, and for conversion of the bond money. TRI filed a cross-\ncomplaint alleging breach of contract based on the July 2006 settlement.\n\n\n                                             12\n\f       TRI filed three motions at the pleading stage. Its demurrers to the first four causes\nof action in the original complaint were overruled, but its demurrer to the conversion\nclaim was sustained with leave to amend. TRI then responded to Bain‟s first amended\ncomplaint with a special demurrer on the ground of uncertainty and a special motion to\nstrike the causes of action for Labor Code violations and for conversion as a strategic\nlawsuit against public participation (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16), otherwise known as an\nanti-SLAPP motion. (Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53,\n57.) TRI argued that those two causes of action were barred by the litigation privilege\n(Civ. Code, § 47) because they were both based on the release of the bond. Bain opposed\nthe anti-SLAPP motion, arguing that it was “another delay tactic to avoid paying the\n2005 wages and the 2006 settlement.”\n       The court overruled the special demurrer, denied the special motion to strike, and\ndenied both parties‟ requests for attorney fees for the special motion to strike. TRI\nappealed the trial court‟s order on the special motion to strike to this court. We affirmed\nthe trial court‟s order in an unpublished opinion. (Bain v. Tax Reducers, Inc. (May 17,\n2010, H033632).\n       In September 2010, Bain amended his first amended complaint to name Griffin,\nindividually, as a Doe defendant. According to Bain‟s counsel, the amendment was\nprompted by the Supreme Court‟s May 2010 decision in Martinez v. Combs (2010) 49\nCal.4th 35 (Martinez), which Bain‟s counsel contends “re-defin[ed] the term „employer‟\nunder the Labor Code.”\n       The parties engaged in discovery, which generated four discovery motions in the\ntrial court. Each of the parties then sought summary judgment or summary adjudication.\nBain filed a motion for summary adjudication of his cause of action alleging Labor Code\nviolations. TRI sought summary adjudication of two causes of action. It argued that the\ncause of action for Labor Code violations and wages due was barred by the statute of\nlimitations and by Bain‟s election to enforce the settlement agreement in the prior\n\n                                            13\n\flawsuit. TRI asserted that the conversion claim failed because: TRI‟s actions were\nprivileged, Bain consented to release of the bond, Bain never demanded the bond money\nor asked TRI to redeposit it with the court, and Bain was never entitled to that money.\nGriffin filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that he was not personally liable\nfor Bain‟s claims.\n       The trial court denied Bain‟s and TRI”s motions for summary adjudication, but it\ngranted Griffin‟s motion for summary judgment. Regarding Griffin‟s motion, the court\nobserved that Bain had conceded that Griffin was not liable on his first three causes of\naction. The court concluded that Griffin had met his initial burden of demonstrating that\nthere were no triable issues of material fact regarding (1) the claim for Labor Code\nviolations “as [Griffin] was not Bain‟s employer but rather a corporate officer of TRI,”\nand (2) the conversion claim, since the “bond funds were released to TRI and [Griffin]\ndid not personally receive the bond funds at issue.”\n\n       Trial & Statement of Decision\n\n       The court conducted a four-day court trial in April and May 2011. At trial, the\ncourt denied Bain‟s request to amend his complaint to add Griffin as a defendant on the\ntheory that Griffin was individually liable for Bain‟s wages. At trial, Griffin testified that\nhe did not intend to pay Bain absent a court order.\n       The court filed a 21-page statement of decision, which contained findings of fact\nand conclusions of law. The court found that “TRI operated as employer” and “Bain was\nits employee, and [TRI] employed Bain to perform the integral functions of a tax preparer\nfor the business.” The court found that TRI‟s labeling Bain an “independent contractor”\nand Bain‟s receipt of a 1099 form from Conard and his filing of a Schedule C while\nemployed by Conard had no legal effect on his status as an employee. The court\nconcluded that Bain‟s statutory wage claims were governed by the three-year limitations\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fperiod in Code of Civil Procedure section 339 subdivision (1)4 and that the claims were\nnot barred by the statute of limitations because TRI had agreed to pay wages on January\n31, 2007, as part of the December 2006 settlement agreement. Alternatively, the court\nheld that Bain was entitled to rely on the doctrine of equitable tolling because he had\n“consistently pursued his remedies in multiple fora, including trying to resolve the issues\nwithout resort to Court again” and TRI was not prejudiced by the delay. The court found\nthat there was no conversion of the bond funds because Bain had not established that he\nwas entitled to the money when it was released by the court and had not presented any\nevidence that he ever asked TRI to return the money to him or to the court. The court\ndenied relief on TRI‟s cross-complaint for breach of contract, reasoning that there was no\nmeeting of the minds regarding the terms of a settlement agreement at that time and that\nthe December 2006 settlement was an accord and satisfaction of any claims TRI may\nhave had based on the July 2006 negotiations.\n       After trial, the court made two alternative awards from which Bain could choose\nwhen he prepared the judgment. As a first alternative, the court awarded Bain the\nfollowing on his causes of action based on the December 2006 settlement: $7,700 as\nwages; $10,000 as attorney fees; and $7,669.94 as statutory 10 percent interest on both\namounts from January 31, 2007 through May 31, 2011. These awards amounted to a\ntotal of $25,369.94, plus costs of suit. Alternatively, on the fourth cause of action for\nviolations of the Labor Code, the court awarded Bain: $7,700 in unpaid wages (§ 201-\n202), $6,600 in penalties for intentionally withholding wages (§ 203), $7,700 as\nliquidated damages for failure to pay at least minimum wages (§§ 1194, 1194.2), and\n\n\n       4\n         Code of Civil Procedure section 339, subdivision (1) provides that the\nlimitations period for an action based on an oral contract is two years. Although the court\ncited Code of Civil Procedure section 339, subdivision (1), it likely meant Code of Civil\nProcedure section 338, subdivision (a), which provides that the limitations period for an\n“action based on a liability created by statute” is three years. The parties do not address\nthis apparent error in the statement of decision.\n\n                                             15\n\f$3,368.75 in prejudgment interest at the rate of seven percent on $7,700 for February 19,\n2005 through May 28, 2011, for a total of $25,368.75. The court also awarded Bain\nattorney fees and costs.\n       TRI filed objections to the statement of decision, which the court rejected. Bain\nelected the remedy provided by his fourth cause of action and the court entered judgment\nfor Bain on August 15, 2011.\n       Both sides appealed. After the notices of appeal were filed, Bain filed a motion\nfor attorney fees and costs. Bain claimed “Lodestar Fees” totaling $276,235 based on\n470.2 hours of attorney time and 92.75 hours of paralegal time. Bain also argued that he\nwas entitled to “an enhancement factor of 1.5, for a total of $414,352.5 . . . due to [TRI‟s]\ninsistence on overly zealous and vigorous litigation, and re-litigation of certain issues,\nand [its] refusal to settle this matter given the admission that [it] did not pay Bain.”\nGriffin filed a motion for attorney fees based on his successful motion for summary\njudgment. The court‟s order on the attorney fees claims is the subject of a separate\nappeal in Bain v. Tax Reducers, Court of Appeal Case No. H038002.\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\n       TRI argues that the court erred (1) when it held that the action was not barred by\nthe statute of limitations; (2) when it applied the presumption that every person who\nperforms services is presumed to be an employee; and (3) when it imposed statutory\npenalties pursuant to sections 203 and 1194.2. Bain filed a cross-appeal challenging the\ncourt‟s rulings on (1) Griffin‟s motion for summary judgment and (2) Bain‟s motion to\namend his complaint at trial to add Griffin as a defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\f   I. TRI’s Appeal\n\n       A. Statute of Limitations\n\n       TRI contends that the applicable statute of limitations bars Bain‟s recovery of\nmonies owed. Although not expressly stated in TRI‟s opening brief, it appears this\ncontention is limited to Bain‟s fourth cause of action for violations of the Labor Code\narising out of TRI‟s failure to pay wages. TRI‟s opening brief does not argue that the\ncontract-based causes of action to enforce the settlement agreement were time barred.\n       Regarding the wage claims, TRI observes that there was no written employment\ncontract between the parties and argues that the limitations period on an action based on\nan oral contract is two years under Code of Civil Procedure section 339, subdivision (1).5\nAlternatively, TRI argues that Bain‟s claim for unpaid minimum wages is a statutory\nclaim based on section 1194 and that it is therefore governed by the three-year limitations\nperiod in Code of Civil Procedure section 338. Bain filed this action on May 7, 2008.\nTRI argues: “Counting back two years from May 7, 2008, all claims for amounts due on\nan oral contract before May 7, 2006 are barred. Counting back three years . . . , all claims\nbased upon a statute for payments due before May 7, 2005 are barred. Since [Bain]\nclaims he is owed payments that were due no later than February 18, 2005, all of these\nclaims are barred, whether they are „contract payments‟ or „wages.‟ ”\n       The trial court disagreed with TRI‟s analysis. The court held that the “statute of\nlimitations for any violation of the Labor Code regarding wages is three years,” and that\nBain‟s claims were not barred by the statute of limitations because (1) Bain was entitled\nto rely on the doctrine of equitable tolling; and (2) the three-year limitations period began\nto run on January 31, 2007, the date TRI had promised to pay wages under the settlement\n\n       5\n         Code of Civil Procedure section 339, subdivision (1) provides that the\nlimitations period for “[a]n action upon a contract, obligation or liability not founded\nupon an instrument of writing” is “two years.”\n\n                                             17\n\fagreement. TRI challenges each of the court‟s holdings regarding the statute of\nlimitations.\n\n               1. Three-Year Limitations Period for Bain’s Claims Based on Labor\n                  Code Sections 201, 203 and 1194\n\n       We begin by determining the applicable limitations period. Contrary to TRI‟s\nassertion, Bain sought more than unpaid minimum wages (§ 1194) in his fourth cause of\naction for violations of the Labor Code. Bain‟s first amended complaint alleged\nviolations of section 201 (failure to immediately pay wages upon discharge6), section 203\n(penalty for failure to pay wages as required by sections 201 or 202), and sections 1194\nand 1194.2 (failure to pay minimum wages).\n       Generally speaking, a cause of action based on a wage liability created by statute\nmust be commenced within three years after the cause of action has accrued. (Cuadra v.\nMillan (1998) 17 Cal.4th 855, 859 (Cuadra), disapproved on other grounds in Samuels v.\nMix (1999) 22 Cal.4th 1, 16, fn.4; Code Civ. Proc., § 338, subd. (a).) “A cause of action\nfor unpaid wages accrues when the wages first become legally due, i.e., on the regular\npayday for the pay period in which the employee performed the work; when the work is\ncontinuing and the employee is therefore paid periodically (e.g. weekly or monthly) a\nseparate and distinct cause of action accrues on each payday, triggering on each occasion\n       6\n          Section 201 provides in relevant part: “If an employer discharges an employee,\nthe wages earned and unpaid at the time of discharge are due and payable immediately.”\nSection 202 provides in part: “If an employee not having a written contract for a definite\nperiod quits his or her employment, his or her wages shall become due and payable no\nlater than 72 hours thereafter, unless the employee has given 72 hours previous notice of\nhis or her intention to quit, in which case the employee is entitled to his or her wage at the\ntime of quitting.” Although Bain‟s first amended complaint claimed a violation of\nsection 201, it did not mention section 202. Arguably his claim was governed by section\n202, since he resigned from TRI (§ 202) and was not terminated (§ 201). The trial court\nawarded Bain his unpaid wages, citing both sections 201 and 202 and TRI does not\nchallenge that conclusion. Since Bain resigned without giving 72 hours notice, his\nunpaid wages were due within three days after he resigned, or no later than February 21,\n2005. To this day, more than eight years later, TRI has never paid Bain.\n\n                                             18\n\fthe running of a new period of limitations.” (Ibid.) In view of this rule, we agree with\nTRI‟s contention that the trial court erred when it concluded that the limitations period\nbegan to run on January 31, 2007, the date the wage payment was due under the\nDecember 2006 settlement agreement.\n       More specifically, “[a]ctions for final wages not paid as required by sections 201\nand 202 are governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (a), which\nprovides that a three-year statute of limitations applies to „[a]n action upon a liability\ncreated by statute, other than a penalty or forfeiture.‟ ” (Pineda v. Bank of America, N.A.\n(2010) 50 Cal.4th 1389, 1395.) The same three-year limitations period applies to Bain‟s\nclaim for section 203 penalties. (Id. at p. 1398; § 203.) Bain‟s statutory minimum wage\nclaim (§ 1194) is also governed by the three-year limitations period, since it is a liability\ncreated by statute. (See Aubry v. Goldhor (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 399, 404 [section 1194\nclaim for overtime compensation subject to three-year limitations period in Code Civ.\nProc., former § 338, subd. (1), now § 338, subd. (a)].)\n\n              2. One-Year Limitations Period for Bain’s Claim Based on Labor Code\n                 Section 1194.2 (Liquidated Damages)\n\n       However, a different limitations period governs Bain‟s claim for liquidated\ndamages under section 1194.2. In their initial briefing, both parties assert that all of\nBain‟s wage claims, including the claim for liquidated damages under section 1194.2, are\nsubject to a three-year limitations period. We requested supplemental briefing from the\nparties on the question whether Bain‟s section 1194.2 claim is subject to the three-year\nlimitations period for a liability created by statute (Code Civ. Proc., § 338, subd. (a)) or\nthe one-year limitations period for a statutory penalty (Code Civ. Proc., § 340, subd. (a)).\nAs we shall explain, we conclude that the section 1194.2 claim is subject to the one-year\nlimitations period for statutory penalties in Code of Civil Procedure section 340,\nsubdivision (a).\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\f       Section 1194.2 provides in relevant part: “(a) In any action under . . . Section\n1194 to recover wages because of the payment of a wage less than the minimum wage\nfixed by an order of the commission, an employee shall be entitled to recover liquidated\ndamages in an amount equal to the wages unlawfully unpaid and interest thereon.” “The\n„liquidated damages‟ allowed in section 1194.2 are in effect a penalty equal to the\namount of unpaid minimum wages.”7 (Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 48, fn. 8.)\n       The three-year limitations period in Code of Civil Procedure section 338,\nsubdivision (a), applies to an “action upon a liability created by statute, other than a\npenalty or forfeiture.” (Italics added.) Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision\n(a) provides that the limitations period “upon a statute for a penalty” is one year, “except\nif the statute imposing it prescribes a different limitation.” Although both sections 203\nand 1194.2 impose penalties, the court in Pineda concluded that the longer three-year\nlimitations period in Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (a) applies to\nclaims for section 203 penalties since section 203 provides that “[s]uit may be filed for\nthese penalties at any time before the expiration of the statute of limitations on an action\nfor the wages from which the penalties arise” and thereby expressly prescribes a different\nlimitations period. (Pineda, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 1395.)\n       Unlike section 203, nothing in section 1194.2 “prescribes a different limitation[s]”\nperiod or otherwise exempts section 1194.2 from the one-year limitations period in Code\nof Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (a). Absent an express authorization to apply\na different limitations period, we conclude that the one-year limitations period in Code of\nCivil Procedure section 340, subdivision (a) applies to Bain‟s claim for section 1194.2\npenalties.\n\n       7\n          The plain text of section 1194.2 applies to “the payment of a wage” that is less\nthan the current minimum wage. Here, no wage was paid to Bain. But we need not\ndetermine whether section 1194.2 could provide relief under these circumstances\nbecause: (1) the one-year statute of limitations had expired; and (2) the parties do not\nraise this point.\n\n                                             20\n\f              3. Equitable Tolling Applies\n\n       Bain‟s claims accrued no later than February 18, 2005, the last day he worked for\nTRI. Bain filed his complaint on May 7, 2008, more than three years after that date. His\nstatutory wage claims, whether subject to the three-year limitations period or the one-year\nlimitations period, would therefore be barred, unless Bain can demonstrate that the\nlimitations period was equitably tolled.\n       The most recent Supreme Court case to discuss the equitable tolling doctrine is\nMcDonald v. Antelope Valley Community College District (2008) 45 Cal.4th 88\n(McDonald). “Broadly speaking, the doctrine applies „ “[w]hen an injured person has\nseveral legal remedies and, reasonably and in good faith, pursues one.” ‟ [Citations.]\nThus, it may apply where one action stands to lessen the harm that is the subject of a\npotential second action; where administrative remedies must be exhausted before a\nsecond action can proceed; or where a first action, embarked upon in good faith, is found\nto be defective for some reason. [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 100.) “Equitable tolling is a fact\nintensive issue and it is determined based upon evidence. Accordingly, we are compelled\nto affirm the trial court‟s [order based on that] theory if there is substantial evidence to\nsupport its determination.” (Thomas v. Gilliland (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 427, 434\n(Thomas).)\n       In addition, “equitable tolling may extend even to the voluntary pursuit of\nalternate remedies.” (McDonald, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 101.) In Campbell v. Graham-\nArmstrong (1973) 9 Cal.3d 482, 490 the court held that “[t]he exhaustion of\nadministrative remedies will suspend the statute of limitations even though no statute\nmakes it a condition of the right to sue.” In Elkins v. Derby (1974) 12 Cal.3d 410, 414\n(Elkins), the court “rejected the assertion that equitable tolling should be limited to cases\nin which a plaintiff was required to pursue a particular alternate remedy before initiating\nsuit, and instead espoused „the principle that regardless of whether the exhaustion of one\n\n\n                                              21\n\fremedy is a prerequisite to the pursuit of another, if the defendant is not prejudiced\nthereby, the running of the limitations period is tolled.‟ ” (McDonald, at pp. 101-102,\nciting Elkins at p. 414.)\n       In Addison v. State of California (1978) 21 Cal.3d 313, our high court “confirmed\nthat equitable tolling applies equally to the voluntary pursuit of alternate remedies against\npublic defendants.”8 (McDonald, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 102.) The Addison court stated\nthat the equitable tolling rule requires a showing of three elements: “ „timely notice, and\nlack of prejudice, to the defendant, and reasonable and good faith conduct on the part of\nthe plaintiff.‟ ” (McDonald, at p. 102, citing Addison, supra, at p. 319.) Finally, in Jones\nv. Tracy School Dist. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 99, 107-109, the court reversed a summary\njudgment on the ground that equitable tolling may apply to the limitations period for a\nwage discrimination claim (§ 1197.5) while the plaintiff pursued a related claim under the\nfederal Fair Labor Standards Act.\n       Bain had two concurrent remedies to recover his unpaid wages. He could “seek\njudicial relief by filing an ordinary civil action against the employer for breach of\ncontract and/or for the wages prescribed by statute” or he could seek administrative relief\nby filing a wage claim with the Labor Commissioner. (Reynolds v. Bement (2005) 36\nCal.4th 1075, 1084-1085 (Reynolds).) Bain decided to pursue administrative relief and\nfiled his claim with the Labor Commissioner on March 1, 2005, eleven days after he\nresigned from TRI. Although the pursuit of his administrative claim was not a\nprerequisite to filing a judicial action, that does not bar a finding of equitable tolling.\n(McDonald, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 101; Murphy, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 1117.) TRI filed\na written response and, about one year later, in March 2006, the parties went to trial\nbefore a hearing officer for the Labor Commissioner. The Labor Commissioner found\nfor Bain and served its decision and order on the parties on April 21, 2006. On or about\n\n       8\n         This case does not involve a remedy against a public defendant, but it did\ninvolve the filing of a wage claim with the Labor Commissioner.\n\n                                               22\n\fMay 5, 2006, TRI filed its appeal from the Labor Commissioner‟s decision in the trial\ncourt. Such an appeal “is neither a conventional appeal nor review of the Labor\nCommissioner‟s decision, but is rather a de novo trial of the wage dispute.” (Murphy,\nsupra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 1116.) The parties engaged in discovery and the case was set for\ntrial de novo on December 11, 2006; the parties settled on the first day of trial.\n       Substantial evidence supports the trial court‟s conclusion that the equitable tolling\ndoctrine applied. Regarding the first element, the “ „ “timely notice requirement\nessentially means that the first claim must have been filed within the statutory period.\nFurthermore[,] the filing of the first claim must alert the defendant in the second claim of\nthe need to begin investigating the facts which form the basis for the second claim.\nGenerally this means that the defendant in the first claim is the same one being sued in\nthe second.” ‟ ” (McDonald, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 102, fn 2, quoting Collier v. City of\nPasadena (1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 917, 924.) Bain promptly filed his claim with the\nLabor Commissioner 11 days after he resigned, well within the limitations period, and the\ndefendants in both the administrative action and the judicial action were the same.\n       The second element (lack of prejudice to the defendant) “ „ “essentially translates\nto a requirement that the facts of the two claims be identical or at least so similar that the\ndefendant‟s investigation of the first claim will put him in a position to fairly defend the\nsecond.” ‟ ” (McDonald, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 102, fn 2.) Here, both claims were\nalmost identical and involved Bain‟s unpaid wages and whether Bain was an employee or\nan independent contractor. TRI received prompt notice of the wage claim and an\nopportunity to investigate it. TRI filed a written response to the administrative claim and\nparticipated in the trial before the Labor Commissioner. TRI appealed the Labor\nCommissioner‟s decision, conducted discovery, and prepared for the trial de novo.\nGriffin was the only witness for TRI; he appeared at both the administrative hearing\nbefore the Labor Commissioner and for the trial de novo in the superior court. All of this\n\n\n\n                                              23\n\factivity on the administrative claim gave TRI ample opportunity to prepare its defense.\nMoreover, TRI does not argue that it was prejudiced in this regard.\n       The third element “ „ “of good faith and reasonable conduct on the part of the\nplaintiff is less clearly defined in the cases. But in Addison . . . , supra, 21 Cal.3d 313[,]\nthe Supreme Court did stress that the plaintiff filed his second claim a short time after\ntolling ended.” ‟ ” (McDonald, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 102, fn 2, quoting Downs v.\nDepartment of Water & Power (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1100.) TRI does not argue a\nlack of good faith and reasonable conduct by Bain. After the first case was settled, the\ncourt set the matter for hearing on the dismissal calendar on February 8, 2007. Although\na defendant generally prepares a release, TRI did not send Bain a release until March\n2007; the parties disputed the language of that release for several months. In January\n2008, Bain‟s counsel forwarded a proposed release to TRI‟s counsel. Although Griffin\ntestified that Bain‟s release was consistent with the terms of the settlement the parties had\nagreed to on the record, TRI‟s counsel disputed the applicability of certain terms, given\nthe passage of time. Based on their letters, it appears that throughout this time, both\ncounsel believed the court still had jurisdiction to hear a motion to enforce the settlement\n(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6). It is not clear when they learned that the case had been\ndismissed. The attorneys last corresponded about Bain‟s proposed release on January 31,\n2008, and at that time appeared to believe that a motion to enforce was available to them.\nBain filed his civil action on May 7, 2008, a little more than three months later. Given\nBain‟s active pursuit of his administrative claim and his repeated efforts to finalize the\nDecember 2006 settlement, there was sufficient evidence to support the court‟s implied\nfinding that he acted in good faith.\n       The equitable tolling rule suspends the running of the limitations period through\nthe date on which the decision in the first action becomes final. (Elkins, supra, 12\nCal.3d at p. 413, fn. 1.) The first superior court action (TRI‟s appeal of the Labor\nCommissioner‟s decision) was dismissed on February 8, 2007; that order became final 60\n\n                                              24\n\fdays later on April 9, 2007. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.104(a).) Three years from that\ndate is April 9, 2010. Therefore, Bain‟s complaint, filed on May 7, 2008, was timely as\nto his statutory wage claims under sections 201, 202, 203, and 1194 since they are subject\nto a three-year limitations period.9 However, Bain‟s claim for the section 1194.2 penalty,\nwhich is subject to a one-year limitations period, is barred since his complaint was filed\nmore than one year after the decision in the first action became final.\n       TRI argues that equitable tolling does not apply because the doctrine was designed\nto “protect a plaintiff who inadvertently pursues a remedy in the incorrect forum, and as\na result, delays filing in the correct forum until the statute of limitations has expired.”\nTRI contends that since Bain filed his first claim in a correct forum, he cannot rely on\nequitable tolling because he had an adequate legal remedy and used it. TRI relies on\nthree cases: Addison, Elkins and Jones.\n       The plaintiffs in Addison filed a timely tort action against the state and county in\nfederal court alleging violations of state and federal law. After holding that the plaintiffs\ncould not state a claim under federal law, the court dismissed the federal claim and\ndecided not to retain jurisdiction over the state law claims. The plaintiffs then filed their\naction, after the limitations period had run, in state court. But they did so before the\nfederal court filed its dismissal order. Our high court held that the limitations period was\ntolled while the action was pending in federal court. (Addison, supra, 21 Cal.3d at pp.\n315-316.)\n       The plaintiff in Elkins filed a workers‟ compensation action. After the appeals\nboard concluded that he was not entitled to compensation benefits because he was not an\n\n\n       9\n          Non-statutory actions for unpaid wages are subject to the limitations period\ngoverning breach of contract actions generally. Since Bain did not have a written\ncontract of employment, the applicable limitations period would be two years (Code Civ.\nProc., § 339 [oral agreements]). (Cuadra, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 859.) But even if the\ntwo-year limitations period applied, Bain‟s claims would still be timely, because of the\nequitable tolling.\n\n                                              25\n\femployee, the plaintiff filed an untimely civil action against the same defendant. The\ncourt held that the statute of limitations was tolled while the plaintiff pursued his\nworkers‟ compensation remedy. (Elkins, supra, 12 Cal.3d at pp. 412-413.)\n       The plaintiff in Jones filed a wage discrimination claim in state court. The court\nin that case reversed a summary judgment because there were triable issues whether the\nlimitations period on the plaintiff‟s claim was tolled while she pursued her federal\nadministrative remedy. (Jones, supra, 27 Cal.3d at pp. 107-109.)\n       In Addison, Elkins and Jones, the Supreme Court held that equitable tolling applies\n“when an injured person has several formal legal remedies and reasonably and in good\nfaith pursues one.” (Jones, supra, 27 Cal.3d at p. 108.) The test is not whether the first\naction was brought in the correct forum or an incorrect forum as TRI asserts, but whether\nthe person acted reasonably and in good faith. In this case, when faced with a choice of\nforums, Bain reasonably and in good faith pursued his claim before the Labor\nCommissioner. Contrary to TRI‟s assertion, Bain‟s administrative claim was never\nresolved. Although Bain prevailed before the Labor Commissioner, TRI requested a trial\nde novo in the superior court, purported to settle the case, and then refused to complete\nthe settlement. Bain‟s claims were dismissed for reasons that had nothing to do with the\nmerits of his case.\n       Citing Wood v. Elling (1977) 20 Cal.3d 353 (Wood) and Thomas, supra, 95\nCal.App.4th 427, TRI also argues that Bain is not entitled to equitable tolling because “he\nhad his prior timely lawsuit dismissed in February 2007 and then raised the same claims\nin a second lawsuit.” TRI‟s reliance on both cases is misplaced.\n       The plaintiff in Wood sued two individuals and two corporations. Summons was\npromptly served on the individuals, but not the corporations. The corporations were later\ndismissed for delay in service of summons. After obtaining a judgment against the\nindividual defendants, the plaintiff filed a second action in the same court, seeking to\nhold the corporations jointly and severally liable for that judgment on an alter ego theory.\n\n                                              26\n\f(Wood, supra, 20 Cal.3d at pp. 357-358.) The Supreme Court held that when a case is\ndismissed for failure to serve summons or bring the matter to trial within the statutory\ntime limits (former Code Civ. Proc., §§ 581a, 583), the statute of limitations applies as if\nthe prior action had never been brought. (Wood, at p. 360.) The court distinguished\nElkins, reasoning that Wood did not involve a claim that could be brought in two different\nforums and instead involved “a plaintiff‟s failure to diligently pursue the sole avenue of\nlegal recourse available to him.” (Id. at p. 360, fn. 4.)\n       Thomas was a medical malpractice case in which the plaintiff‟s attorney was set\nfor trial in two separate cases on the same day. Rather than pursue other procedural\nremedies, the attorney dismissed Thomas‟s action and re-filed it the same day, reasoning\nthat since the plaintiff filed the first action within three months of discovering the\nmalpractice, “the remaining nine months were tolled during the pendency of the first\ncomplaint and did not commence to run until he dismissed the first action.” (Thomas,\nsupra, 95 Cal.App.4th at p. 430.) The court concluded that equitable tolling did not apply\nbecause “Thomas did not have any alternate remedies. His claim was the single pursuit\nof a medical malpractice action. But even more obviously, Thomas did not act\nreasonably or with any semblance of good faith.” (Id. at p. 434.) Thomas‟s attorney did\nnot advise opposing counsel of the scheduling conflict or request a trial continuance from\nthe court. Instead, he “endeavored to solve the mismanagement of his calendar conflict\nwithout regard to the interests of [the] defendant or the court and contrary to conventional\nprocedures available to him.” (Id. at p. 435.)\n       This case is distinguishable from Wood and Thomas. First, unlike the plaintiffs in\nthose cases, Bain‟s wage claims could be brought in two alternate forums. Second,\nBain‟s claim was not dismissed for failing to serve summons or bring the case to trial\nwithin the statutory deadlines and there was no evidence Bain filed his second action to\nremedy calendar mismanagement or for any other improper purpose. Bain diligently\npursued his claim before the Labor Commissioner and obtained an award in that\n\n                                              27\n\fproceeding. The first lawsuit in the superior court was TRI‟s appeal of the Labor\nCommissioner‟s decision and Bain continued to pursue his claims throughout that appeal.\nThus, the trial court did not err when it found that the limitations period on Bain‟s\njudicial action to recover wages based on violations of Labor Code sections 201, 202,\n203, and 1194 was equitably tolled while Bain pursued his administrative claim before\nthe Labor Commissioner.\n       Finally, TRI argues that even if Bain‟s judicial action was timely, his claim for\nminimum wages under section 1194 was barred, since he did not make a claim under\nsection 1194 in the administrative proceeding. The record contains both Bain‟s “Initial\nReport or Claim” and the “Complaint” he filed with the Labor Commissioner. Both\ndocuments claim unpaid wages without specifying which Labor Code provisions wages\nwere sought under. Bain‟s claim that he was never paid any wages necessarily includes\nthe allegation that he was not paid even minimum wages. In addition, since the appeal of\nthe Labor Commissioner‟s decision was a trial de novo, the trial court had the discretion\nto permit Bain to raise additional related wage claims. (Murphy, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p.\n1115.) We do not have a complete record of the proceedings in the first action in the\nsuperior court (TRI‟s appeal of the Labor Commissioner‟s decision) and therefore do not\nknow whether Bain relied on section 1194 in that case. We conclude that TRI has not\nmet its burden of demonstrating that the section 1194 minimum wage claims were barred.\n\n       B. Presumption of Employment\n\n       TRI next argues that the judgment must be reversed because the court erroneously\nrelied on the presumption that every person who performs services for another is an\nemployee. TRI contends this is “a fundamentally incorrect statement of the law” and that\nin determining whether Bain was an employee or an independent contractor, the court\nshould have followed “the controlling case” of S. G. Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d 341, which\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\frequires the court to consider all of the circumstances and analyze a number of factors,\nthe most important being whether the employer had the right to control the work.\n       Bain argues that even if the court erred in applying the presumption, the error was\nharmless. Bain asserts that TRI does not point to any substantial evidence that he was not\nan employee and argues that even if the presumption did not apply, the only conclusion\nfrom the uncontested facts is that he was an employee.\n       Indeed, the analysis in the court‟s statement of decision begins with the\npresumption that Bain was an employee. On this point, the court cited sections 3357 and\n3353. Section 3357 provides: “Any person rendering service for another, other than as\nan independent contractor, or unless expressly excluded herein, is presumed to be an\nemployee.” This section has been interpreted as creating a presumption that a service\nprovider is presumed to be an employee unless the principal proves otherwise. (Yellow\nCab Cooperative, Inc. v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals. Bd. (1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1288,\n1292-1293.) Section 3353 provides: “ „Independent contractor‟ means any person who\nrenders service for a specified recompense for a specified result, under the control of his\nprincipal as to the result of his work only and not as to the means by which such result is\naccomplished.” “Unless the context otherwise requires,” the definitions in sections 3351\nthrough 3371 apply to Division 4 of the Labor Code, which governs workers‟\ncompensation. (§ 3350.)\n       The trial court also cited Robinson v. George (1940) 16 Cal.2d 238 (Robinson).\nRobinson was a personal injury action in which the plaintiff alleged that a negligent\ndriver (defendant George) was the corporate defendant‟s employee, making the corporate\ndefendant vicariously liable for injuries the plaintiff sustained in a motor vehicle\naccident. (Id. at p. 240.) The Supreme Court held “[t]he rule, . . . , is that the fact that\none is performing work and labor for another is prima facie evidence of employment and\nsuch person is presumed to be a servant in the absence of evidence to the contrary.” (Id.\nat p. 242.) The court also noted that this presumption may be rebutted by evidence that\n\n                                              29\n\fthe alleged employee was an independent contractor. (Ibid.) TRI argues that the court\nerred in relying on Robinson, because the reasoning in Robinson was criticized in\nFillmore v. Irvine (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 649, 659, a decision of the Court of Appeal.\nBut Robinson has never been overruled and we are bound to follow it. (Auto Equity\nSales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455.)\n       In addition, the trial court cited Cristler v. Express Messenger Systems, Inc. (2009)\n171 Cal.App.4th 72 (Cristler), a class action in which the plaintiffs alleged that the\ndefendant parcel delivery company improperly classified them as independent\ncontractors. The plaintiffs in Cristler alleged Labor Code violations, including failure to\npay overtime compensation (§§ 510, 515, 1194), failure to provide properly itemized\nwage statements (§ 226), and failure to compensate for business expenses (§ 2802), as\nwell as claims not based on the Labor Code. (Cristler, at pp. 75-76.) The appellate court\nin Cristler, like the trial court here, began its analysis with the definitions of “employee”\nand “independent contractor” in sections 3351, 3353, and 3357. (Id. at pp. 76-77.) Thus,\nCristler provides authority for applying the definitions in sections 3353 and 3357 to wage\nclaims. (Ibid.)\n       In setting forth its multi-factor test, the S. G. Borello court relied on the traditional\ncommon law test from the Restatement of Agency, the standards for contractor‟s\nlicensees in section 2750.5, and a test applied in other jurisdictions; it noted that many of\nthe factors in those tests overlapped. (S. G. Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d at pp. 351, 354-\n355.) The court stated that the most important factor is “the right to control the manner\nand means of accomplishing the result desired” and that the right to discharge at will,\nwithout cause, is “ „[s]trong evidence in support of an employment relationship.‟ ” (Id. at\np. 350.) Other factors “include (a) whether the one performing services is engaged in a\ndistinct occupation or business; (b) the kind of occupation, with reference to whether, in\nthe locality, the work is usually done under the direction of the principal or by a specialist\nwithout supervision; (c) the skill required in the particular occupation; (d) whether the\n\n                                              30\n\fprincipal or the workman supplies the instrumentalities, tools, and the place of work for\nthe person doing the work; (e) the length of time for which the services are to be\nperformed; (f) the method of payment, whether by the time or by the job; (g) whether or\nnot the work is a part of the regular business of the principal; and (h) whether or not the\nparties believe they are creating the relationship of employer-employee.” (Id. at p. 351.)\nThe trier of fact may also consider: (1) the opportunity for profit or loss; (2) the\ninvestment in equipment or materials required for the task, (3) the employment of\nhelpers; and (4) whether the service rendered is an integral part of the alleged employer‟s\nbusiness.” (Id. at pp. 354-355.) The “individual factors cannot be applied mechanically\nas separate tests; they are intertwined and their weight depends often on particular\ncombinations.‟ ” (Ibid.) “Each service arrangement must be evaluated on its facts, and\nthe dispositive circumstances may vary from case to case.” (Id. at p. 354.) S. G.\nBorello’s “caveats reflect that „[t]he determination of employee or independent-\ncontractor status is one of fact,” which we review under the substantial evidence\nstandard. (Cristler, supra, 171 Cal.App.4th at pp. 77-78.)\n       We are not persuaded that the court erred when it applied a presumption of\nemployment in this case. As we have noted, the Supreme Court has applied the\npresumption in a personal injury case based on the employer‟s vicarious liability.\n(Robinson, supra, 16 Cal.2d at p. 242.) Although the Supreme Court did not specifically\nspeak in terms of a presumption in S. G. Borello, its analysis relied on the “standards” in\nsection 2750.5, which contains a presumption of employment. (S. G. Borello, supra, 48\nCal.3d at p. 354.) And Cristler applied section 3357, which has been construed as a\npresumption of employment, to wage claims similar to those at issue here. (Cristler,\nsupra, 171 Cal.App.4th at pp. 75-76.)\n       But even if it was error for the court to begin its analysis with the presumption, it\nis evident from its factual findings that the court properly analyzed the evidence\naccording to the multi-factor test from S. G. Borello. The court found that TRI controlled\n\n                                             31\n\fBain‟s employment by requiring him to attend staff meetings, to record his hours on the\nsame time sheets as other employees, to perform the same administrative duties as other\nemployees; by deciding which projects Bain worked on and which hours he worked; and\nby having his work audited by its night auditor before it went out. TRI set the fee\nschedule and collected fees from the clients. TRI provided the supplies and equipment,\nexcept for some of Bain‟s furniture, which he had lent to the company. Bain did not have\nany outside clients for whom he performed tax preparation services; all of his services\nwere provided to TRI‟s clients, except for the volunteer work Bain did for LAMTA. TRI\nmarketed Bain and his skills to clients as an employee, not an independent contractor.\nBain was employed on an at-will basis. TRI employed Bain as a tax preparer, which was\nan integral part of TRI‟s business. Bain had not invested in any tax preparation business\nfrom which he could make a profit, he did not market or advertise his tax preparation\nservices, and he never used his own employees or subcontractors to do TRI‟s work. TRI\nalso reimbursed Bain for his client-related expenses and never required Bain to invoice\nTRI for his services.\n       As the trial court noted, that Bain and Conard treated Bain as an independent\ncontractor or that Conard listed Bain as a “consultant” on the profit and loss statement he\nprovided to TRI is not determinative. “The label placed by the parties on their\nrelationship is not dispositive, and subterfuge will not be countenanced.” (S. G. Borello,\nsupra, 48 Cal.3d at p. 349.) Moreover, there was evidence that Bain and Conard were\naware of this rule and intended to treat their relationship as one of employer and\nemployee starting in January 2005, the time that TRI took over the practice. The court\nfound that Bain always thought he was TRI‟s employee and that TRI‟s evidence that the\nparties had agreed Bain would be an independent contractor was not credible. In\naddition, that Conard did not withhold taxes and issued Bain a 1099 is not dispositive;\nsuch conduct is a consequence of their agreement to treat Bain as an independent\n\n\n\n                                            32\n\fcontractor and not a means of proving independent contractor status. (Toyota Motor\nSales U.S.A., Inc. v. Superior Court (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 864, 877.)\n       As set forth in the Facts section of this opinion, there was substantial evidence that\nsupported each of the trial court‟s findings, and the findings support the court‟s\nconclusion that Bain was TRI‟s employee and not an independent contractor. For these\nreasons, we reject TRI‟s contention that the court erred when it began its analysis with\nthe presumption that Bain was an employee and conclude, contrary to TRI‟s assertion,\nthat the court properly applied the multi-factor test from S. G. Borello.\n\n       C. Statutory Penalties\n\n              1. Parties’ Contentions\n\n       TRI argues that the court erred when it awarded Bain both the penalty for failing\nto pay minimum wages (§ 1194.2) and the penalty for failing to timely pay earned wages\nupon resignation (§ 203). TRI argues that there is no legal authority that supports\nimposing both penalties and that the Supreme Court rejected the trial court‟s “expansive”\ninterpretation of section 1194 in Kirby v. Immoos Fire Protection, Inc. (2012) 53\nCal.4th 1244 (Kirby). TRI also contends that if the section 1194.2 penalty applies, the\ncourt miscalculated the amount of the penalty. And TRI argues that the court should not\nhave imposed the section 203 penalty because there was a good faith dispute over\nwhether TRI owed Bain “wages.”\n       Bain argues that TRI waived its challenge to the amount of the section 1194.2\npenalty by failing to object to the statement of decision on that ground, that he is entitled\nto the full amount of his unpaid wages as the section 1194.2 penalty, and that the court\nproperly imposed the section 203 penalty.\n       Since we conclude that Bain‟s claim for the section 1194.2 penalty was barred by\nthe statute of limitations, we shall not address TRI‟s contention that the court erred when\n\n\n                                             33\n\fit imposed both the section 203 penalty and the section 1194.2 penalty or its contention\nthat the court erred in determining the amount of the section 1194.2 penalty. In light of\nour holding, we shall modify the judgment by striking the $7,700 awarded as liquidated\ndamages under section 1194.2, since that claim was time barred. We turn next to the\nquestion whether the court erred in imposing the section 203 penalty in this case.\n\n               2. Propriety of Imposing Section 203 Penalty\n\n       TRI contends the court should not have imposed the section 203 penalty because\nthere was a good faith dispute over whether TRI owed Bain “wages.” Bain contends the\ncourt properly imposed the section 203 penalty because TRI has never disputed that it\nowed Bain $7,700; instead the dispute has always been about how that payment should\nbe characterized. Bain argues that TRI‟s continued refusal to pay is “in bad faith and\noutrageous.”\n       Section 203 provides in relevant part: “If an employer willfully fails to pay,\nwithout abatement or reduction, in accordance with Sections 201, . . . , 202, and . . . , any\nwages of an employee who is discharged or who quits, the wages of the employee shall\ncontinue as a penalty . . . .” (Italics added.) The section 203 penalty is commonly known\nas a “waiting time” penalty. (FEI Enterprises, Inc. v. Yoon (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 790,\n801 (FEI).)\n       “The settled meaning of „willful,‟ as used in section 203, is that an employer has\nintentionally failed or refused to perform an act which was required to be done.\n[Citations.] „[T]he employer‟s refusal to pay need not be based on a deliberate evil\npurpose to defraud workmen of wages which the employer knows to be due.‟ ” (Amaral\nv. Cintas Corp. No. 2 (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1157, 1201 (Amaral), citing Barnhill v.\nRobert Saunders & Co. (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 1, 7-8 (Barnhill) and Davis v. Morris\n(1940) 37 Cal.App.2d 269, 274.)\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\f       As discussed in Amaral, “[i]n Barnhill, [the] court considered whether an\nemployer‟s failure to pay wages is „willful‟ if its legal duty to pay them is unclear at the\ntime of the violation. When the employee in Barnhill was discharged, she owed her\nemployer a balance on a promissory note, which was intended to be repaid in installments\nby payroll deductions. [Citation.] The employer set off the balance due on the\npromissory note against the final wages paid to the employee, and the employee sued to\nrecover her full wages plus waiting time penalties under section 203. [Citation.] The\ntrial court awarded both wages and penalties, but [the appellate court] reversed the\npenalty award. Although ultimately determining the setoff was not permissible, [the\ncourt] noted that the state of the law was not clear at the time the employer withheld\nwages, and several California appellate decisions approved of such setoffs. [Citation.]\n„[G]iven that uncertainty,‟ [the court] reasoned, „[the employer] should not be penalized\nfor believing that setoff was proper and payment of wages not required.‟ [Citation.]\nAccordingly, the employer‟s nonpayment of wages was not willful for purposes of\nsection 203.” (Amaral, supra, 163 Cal.App.4th at p. 1201, citing Barnhill, supra, 125\nCal.App.3d at pp. 4-5, 8-9.)\n       Barnhill‟s holding was memorialized in California Code of Regulations, title 8,\nsection 13520, which states: “A willful failure to pay wages within the meaning of . . .\nSection 203 occurs when an employer intentionally fails to pay wages to an employee\nwhen those wages are due. However, a good faith dispute that any wages are due will\npreclude imposition of waiting time penalties under Section 203. [¶] (a) Good Faith\nDispute. A „good faith dispute‟ that any wages are due occurs when an employer presents\na defense, based in law or fact which, if successful, would preclude any recover[y] on the\npart of the employee. The fact that a defense is ultimately unsuccessful will not preclude\na finding that a good faith dispute did exist. Defenses presented which, under all the\ncircumstances, are unsupported by any evidence, are unreasonable, or are presented in\nbad faith, will preclude a finding of a „good faith dispute.‟ ” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8,\n\n                                             35\n\f§ 13520; Amaral, supra, 163 Cal.App.4th at p. 1201.) “This regulation imposes an\nobjective standard.” (FEI, supra, 194 Cal.App.4th at p. 802.) “The appearance of the\nlanguage „or are presented in bad faith‟ in the list of circumstances precluding a finding\nof a good faith dispute does not render the test a subjective one, but indicates that\nsubjective bad faith may be of evidentiary value in the objective bad faith analysis.” (Id.\nat p. 802, fn. 9.)\n       Nothing requires that a good faith dispute exist at the time the wages are due. The\nregulation defines a good faith dispute in part as a “defense.” “Precisely when the\nemployer formulated such a defense is, . . . beside the point. So long as no other\nevidence suggests the employer acted in bad faith, presentation of a good faith defense,\nbased in law or fact, will negate a finding of willfulness.” (Amaral, supra, 163\nCal.App.4th at p. 1204.)\n       A review of the case law aids our analysis. In Amaral, the trial court found that\nthe employer, Cintas (a uniform supplier), violated a city living wage ordinance (LWO)\nby failing to pay wages at the rate required by the LWO to employees who performed\nwork on the city‟s contracts outside the city. The trial court awarded unpaid wages but\nfound that the existence of a good faith defense precluded imposition of waiting time\npenalties. (Amaral, supra, 163 Cal.App.4th 1170-1171, 1173-1174.) The appellate court\naffirmed. The court explained, “the legal obligations imposed on employers by the LWO\nwere unclear at the time of Cintas‟s violations. As Cintas‟s vigorous defense . . . has\nmade clear, numerous arguments exist concerning the constitutionality of the LWO and\nits proper interpretation. Before the trial court rulings in this case, no court had\npreviously addressed the scope or the validity of the City‟s LWO. Living wage\nordinances such as the one at issue here are a relatively recent phenomenon. Indeed, until\nnow, . . . no California appellate decision has construed the requirements of any . . . living\nwage ordinance, or addressed the constitutional challenges . . . that Cintas has raised.\nAlthough we have rejected Cintas‟s legal arguments about the LWO, these defenses were\n\n                                              36\n\fnot unreasonable or frivolous. On the contrary, they raised complicated issues of first\nimpression” (Id. at p. 1202.) In addition, there was no evidence the employer knew it\nwas required to compensate its production workers at the rates prescribed in the LWO, or\nshowing the company acted in bad faith when it failed to pay such rates.” (Ibid.)\n       In contrast to Barnhill and Amaral, the courts in Armenta v. Osmose, Inc. (2005)\n135 Cal.App.4th 314 (Armenta) and Road Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669 v.\nG & G Fire Sprinklers, Inc. (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 765 (Road Sprinkler), rejected\nclaims that there was a good faith dispute that precluded imposing a section 203 penalty.\nThe employer in Armenta maintained wood utility poles for major utility companies; the\nemployees claimed unpaid wages for time they spent traveling to and from remote\njobsites in company trucks, attending crew meetings, maintaining the trucks, completing\npaperwork, and other tasks the employer referred to as “nonproductive time.” (Armenta,\nat pp. 316-319.) Although the Armenta court observed that California law was unsettled\nregarding the propriety of using “an average hourly wage to determine whether the\nminimum wage law was violated,” that court concluded that the presumption of good\nfaith that this legal uncertainty might have given the employer was outweighed by\nevidence that the employer was in fact aware that its employees were not being fully\ncompensated for their time. (Id. at pp. 325-326.) The court concluded that the trial\ncourt‟s findings that the employer‟s “supervisors created an environment in which the\nforemen were strongly discouraged from recording time spent . . . performing\nnonproductive tasks” and evidence that the workers “raised the issue to supervisors but\nwere told by supervisors and area managers that they would not be compensated for such\ntime” showed that the employer‟s “failure to pay for nonproductive time was intentional\nand willful” and supported imposition of the penalty. (Id. at p. 326.) Applying\nsubstantial evidence review, the appellate court upheld the trial court‟s finding of\nwillfulness. (Id. at pp. 325-327.)\n\n\n\n                                             37\n\f       The same substantial evidence analysis led to the affirmance of section 203\npenalties in Road Sprinkler. The court in Road Sprinkler distinguished Barnhill because\nthe employer‟s legal obligation was clear and substantial evidence supported the lower\ncourt‟s finding that the employer had acted in bad faith. (Road Sprinkler, supra, 102\nCal.App.4th at pp. 781-783.) Thus, any legal mistake the employer claimed to have made\nwas not reasonable and not made in good faith. (Id. at pp. 782-783.)\n       TRI argues that the court erred in imposing the waiting time penalty because at all\ntimes it had a good faith belief that Bain was not an employee. TRI relies on the\nfollowing facts: (1) Conard‟s profit and loss statement listed Bain as a “consultant” and\nshowed that that he was paid without deduction for taxes; (2) Griffin saw the 1099 form\nthat Conard gave Bain for 2004; (3) Griffin believed Bain was an independent contractor\nwhen he gave Bain the independent contractor agreement; and (4) Bain responded to that\ncontract by asking to be treated as an employee. As we have explained, it has long been\nthe rule that neither “[t]he label placed by the parties on their relationship” nor the failure\nto withhold taxes/use of a 1099 form is dispositive. (S. G. Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d at\np. 349; Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc, supra, 220 Cal.App.3d at p. 877.) In addition,\nthe trial court found that Griffin‟s testimony that the parties had agreed Bain would be an\nindependent contractor was not credible. That Bain asked to be treated as an employee\nwhen presented with the independent contractor agreement does not support the\nconclusion that he was an independent contractor before then.\n       TRI relies on the fact that it offered to pay Bain his compensation in February and\nMarch 2005. But those offers were contingent on Bain executing the independent\ncontractor agreement. The requirement that an employer pay earned wages upon\nresignation is unconditional; the employer may not condition the payment of such wages\nin the employee‟s execution of a release or other conduct by the employee. (Singh v.\nSouthland Stone, U.S.A., Inc. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 338, 362-365.) More importantly,\nalthough TRI offered to pay Bain in 2005, it never tendered a check. TRI admits that it\n\n                                              38\n\fhad the financial ability to pay Bain in February 2005. It argues that the only reason it\ndid not pay Bain at that time was a good faith belief that he was an independent\ncontractor, not an employee.\n       There is nothing novel about the rules governing the employee-independent\ncontractor analysis. The analysis in S. G. Borello has been around for two decades.\n(S. G. Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d at pp. 351-355 [1989].) Thus, unlike Amaral and\nBarnhill, this case does not involve an area of the law that is unsettled. There was also\nevidence that upon completing some professional training, Bain and Conard realized that\nthey had misclassified Bain as an independent contractor. A reasonable inference from\nthis evidence is that Griffin, who was also a tax preparer, should have known that Bain\nwas an employee. And whether characterized as an employee or an independent\ncontractor, Bain was entitled to be paid for his work. TRI did not claim that Bain did not\ncomplete his work assignments or provide any other explanation for its refusal to pay\nBain for his services, regardless of the label used. The record and the law support the\ntrial court‟s conclusion that TRI intentionally withheld Bain‟s wages and that it did not\nhave a good faith belief that Bain was not an employee. For these reasons, we conclude\nthe court did not err in imposing the section 203 penalty.\n\n   II. Bain’s Cross-Appeal\n\n       Bain challenges the court‟s rulings that Griffin cannot be held personally liable for\nBain‟s wage claims under the Labor Code. As we have noted, the trial court rejected this\ncontention twice: (1) when it granted Griffin‟s motion for summary judgment; and (2)\nwhen it denied Bain‟s motion to amend his complaint at trial to add Griffin as a\ndefendant. We shall address each ruling separately.\n\n\n\n\n                                             39\n\f       A. Order Granting Griffin’s Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n       In an introductory portion of his brief, Bain states that he is appealing from both\nthe order denying his request to amend at trial and the order on Griffin‟s motion for\nsummary judgment. Although Bain‟s summary of the procedural history mentions\nGriffin‟s motion for summary judgment, the argument portion of his brief does not. Bain\ndoes not discuss the standard of review for a motion for summary judgment or any of the\nevidence or argument presented in Griffin‟s motion for summary judgment.\n       In addition, the record on appeal does not contain copies of Griffin‟s moving\npapers (his points and authorities, separate statement, and the evidence filed in support of\nhis summary judgment motion) or any of Bain‟s papers in opposition to the motion (his\npoints and authorities, separate statement, and evidence). The only documents in the\nrecord relating to Griffin‟s motion for summary judgment are Griffin‟s reply to the\nopposition and the court‟s order on the motion.\n       One of the most fundamental rules of appellate review is that an appealed\njudgment or order is presumed to be correct. “ „All intendments and presumptions are\nindulged to support it on matters as to which the record is silent, and error must be\naffirmatively shown.‟ ” (Denham v. Superior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564; Cahill v.\nSan Diego Gas & Electric Co. (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 939, 956.) The appellant (Bain on\nthe cross-appeal) has the burden of overcoming the presumption of correctness. That\nburden includes providing this court with reasoned argument and citations to authority on\neach point raised. (Niko v. Foreman (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 344, 368; Cahill, supra, at\np. 956.) When the appellant asserts a point but fails to support it with reasoned argument\nand citations to authority, the appellate court may treat it as waived or forfeited, and pass\nit without consideration. (People v. Stanley (1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 793; see, e.g., Taylor\nv. Roseville Toyota, Inc. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 994, 1001, fn. 2 [contention forfeited,\nwhere it is “merely asserted without argument or authority”].) In addition, the appellant\n\n\n                                             40\n\fmust provide this court with an adequate record demonstrating the alleged error. Failure\nto provide an adequate record on an issue requires that the issue be resolved against the\nappellant. (Maria P. v. Riles (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1281, 1295; see e.g., EnPalm, LLC v.\nTeitler Family Trust (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 775 [issue deemed waived where\nappellant failed to support claim by argument, analysis or citation to the record, or to\ninclude any trial proceedings in appellate record].)\n       As set forth above, Bain has failed to provide this court with an adequate record of\nthe proceedings on Griffin‟s summary judgment motion and provides no argument or\nauthority regarding that motion. We therefore conclude that Bain has forfeited any claim\nof error related to the order on Griffin‟s motion for summary judgment.\n\n       B. Order Denying Bain’s Motion to Amend at Trial\n\n       Citing Martinez, Bain argues that the court erred when it denied his motion to\namend because both Griffin and TRI were employers for the purposes of his claim for\nunpaid wages. Relying on the definition of “employer” in Industrial Welfare\nCommission (IWC) wage orders, Bain contends that Griffin was an employer because he\ncontrolled Bain‟s wages, hours, and working conditions, and that Griffin should therefore\nbe held jointly and severally liable with TRI for the judgment.\n       Bain relies on what is commonly referred to as IWC Wage Order No. 4-2001\n(hereafter Wage Order No. 4), which regulates wages, hours, and working conditions in\n“professional, technical, clerical, mechanical, and similar occupations.” (Cal. Code.\nRegs., tit. 8, § 11040, subd. (1); Brinker Restaurant Corp. v. Superior Court (2012) 53\nCal.4th 1004, 1026.) Wage Order No. 4, like all of the industry and occupation wage\norders, defines “employer” as “any person as defined in Section 18 of the Labor Code,\nwho directly or indirectly, or through an agent or any other person, employs or exercises\ncontrol over the wages, hours, or working conditions of any person.” (Cal. Code. Regs.,\ntit. 8, § 11040, subd. (2)(H); Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 59.) Section 18 defines\n\n                                             41\n\f“person” as “any person, association, organization, partnership, business trust, limited\nliability company, or corporation.” Both Griffin and TRI (a corporation) are “persons”\nwho may be employers under Wage Order No. 4.\n       Our Supreme Court first construed the definition of “employer” used in the IWC\nwage orders in Reynolds, supra, 36 Cal.4th 1075. The plaintiff in Reynolds, a former\nemployee of an auto painting company, brought a class action suit to recover unpaid\novertime compensation against the company (a Delaware corporation) and its California\nsubsidiary (also a corporation), alleging violations of Labor Code sections 510 and 1154\nand the applicable wage order. (Id. at pp. 1081-1082.) The plaintiff subsequently added\neight individuals who were officers, directors, and shareholders of the corporations as\ndefendants. (Id. at p. 1083.) The individual defendants demurred, arguing that they were\nnot the plaintiff‟s employers. (Ibid.) Noting that neither section 510 nor section 1194\ndefined the term “ „employer,‟ ” the plaintiff argued that the IWC wage order definition\n(which includes individuals who exercise control over wages, hours, or working\nconditions) applied and that the IWC definition includes corporate control figures like the\nindividual defendants. (Id. at p. 1085.) The court disagreed, explaining that “the plain\nlanguage of [the wage order] defining employer does not expressly impose liability under\nsection 1194 on individual corporate agents. Nor can we infer that the Legislature,\nsimply by amending sections 510 and 1194 several times after the IWC adopted its\nemployer definition, impliedly intended to incorporate that definition into a unified\nremedial scheme comprised of those statutes and the regulations.” (Id. at p. 1086.) The\ncourt applied the common law test of employment and observed that “[u]nder the\ncommon law, corporate agents acting within the scope of their agency are not personally\nliable for the corporate employer‟s failure to pay its employees‟ wages.” (Id. at p. 1087.)\nThe court therefore concluded that the plaintiff could not state a section 1194 violation\nagainst the individual defendants. (Id. at pp. 1087-1088.) The court also held that while\ncorporate directors may be “jointly liable with the corporation and may be joined as\n\n                                            42\n\fdefendants if they personally directed or participated in [] tortious conduct,” the failure to\ncomply with wage laws is not tortious conduct. (Id. at pp. 1089-1090.) In addition, the\nplaintiff did not allege that the individual defendants misappropriated the alleged unpaid\nwages to themselves for their individual advantage. (Id. at p. 1090.)\n       Bain argues that the rule from Reynolds does not apply to Griffin since Reynolds\nwas “found only under common law.” He contends, instead, that he is entitled to rely on\nthe definition of “employer” in Wage Order No. 4, as construed in Martinez, supra, 49\nCal.4th 35, which was decided after Reynolds.\n       In Martinez, the Supreme Court revisited the question of who is an employer for\nthe purpose of an action for unpaid minimum wages (§ 1194). The plaintiffs in Martinez\nwere agricultural workers who sued their employer, a grower, for unpaid minimum\nwages. The named defendants included two produce merchants, through whom the\ngrower sold strawberries, and a field agent for one of the merchants. Based on the\ndefinition of “employer” in the applicable IWC wage order, the plaintiffs argued that the\nproduce merchants, the field agent, and the grower were joint employers and that the\nmerchants and the field agent were therefore liable for the unpaid wages. (Martinez,\nsupra, 49 Cal.4th at pp. 42-43, 48.) The grower had obtained a discharge in bankruptcy.\n(Id. at p. 42.)\n       The Martinez court observed that although section 1194 was enacted in 1913, the\ncourt had only addressed the question of how employment should be defined under\nsection 1194 once, in Reynolds, and that it had never reviewed the concept of joint\nemployment in the context of wage claims brought under state law. (Martinez, supra, 49\nCal.4th at p. 50.) The court stated that Reynolds “spoke too broadly in concluding that\nthe common law defines the employment relationship in actions under section 1194.”\n(Id. at p. 50, fn. 12.) After conducting an extensive examination of section 1194 and the\nIWC wage orders in their “full historical and statutory context,” the court concluded that\nthe wage orders define the employment relationship, and thus who may be held liable as\n\n                                             43\n\fan employer for unpaid wages. (Id. at pp. 52-63.) The court observed that “a worker\nwho sues under section 1194 for unpaid minimum wages actually sues to enforce the\napplicable wage order.” (Martinez, at p. 64.) The court stated, “While the common law\ndefinition of employment plays an important role in the wage orders‟ definition, and . . .\nin actions under section 1194, to apply only the common law definition while ignoring\nthe rest of the IWC‟s broad regulatory definition would substantially impair the\ncommission‟s authority and the effectiveness of its wage orders.” (Id. at p. 65.) The\ncourt held that under the wage orders, “to employ” has three alternative definitions. (Id.\nat pp. 64, 66.) “It means: (a) to exercise control over the wages, hours or working\nconditions, or (b) to suffer or permit to work, or (c) to engage, thereby creating a\ncommon law employment relationship.” (Id. at p. 64.) “This is not to say the common\nlaw plays no role in the IWC‟s definition of the employment relationship. In fact, the\nIWC‟s definition of employment incorporates the common law definition as one\nalternative.” (Ibid.) The court stated that the wage orders‟ definition of “employer,” “is\nbroad enough to reach through straw men and other sham arrangements to impose\nliability for wages on the actual employer.” (Id. at p. 71.) In addition, “one of the\nreasons the IWC defined „employer‟ in terms of exercising control was to reach situations\nin which multiple entities control different aspects of the employment relationship. This\noccurs, for example, when one entity (such as a temporary employment agency) hires and\npays a worker, and another entity supervises the work.” (Id. at p. 76.)\n       But Martinez did not overrule Reynolds, as Bain asserts. To the contrary, the court\nreaffirmed its holding in Reynolds, stating, “The opinion in Reynolds, . . . , properly holds\nthat the IWC‟s definition of „employer‟ does not impose liability on individual corporate\nagents acting within the scope of their agency. [Citation.] The opinion should not be\nread more broadly than that.” (Martinez, 49 Cal.4th at p. 66.) Examining the relationship\nbetween the parties, the Martinez court concluded that the produce merchants were not\njoint employers and were therefore not liable for the plaintiffs‟ unpaid wages. (Id. at\n\n                                             44\n\fp. 71-77.) Addressing the liability of the field agent, the court again reaffirmed Reynolds,\nstating “The claim fails under our holding in Reynolds, . . . , that the IWC‟s definition of\n„employer‟ does not impose liability on individual corporate agents acting within the\nscope of their agency.” (Martinez, at p. 75, citing Reynolds, at p. 1086.)\n       Bain argues that Griffin meets all three alternative definitions of employer from\nMartinez because he controlled Bain‟s hours, working conditions, and whether Bain was\npaid. However, Bain‟s contention ignores the court‟s holdings in Reynolds, which was\nreaffirmed in Martinez, that the wage orders‟ definition of “employer” does not impose\nliability on individual corporate agents acting within the scope of their agency.\n(Martinez, at p. 75.) In this case, there was no evidence that Griffin acted outside the\nscope of his agency as an officer and a shareholder of TRI. There is no allegation or\nevidence that Griffin misappropriated Bain‟s unpaid wages to himself for his individual\nadvantage. (Reynolds, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 1090.) This case is also factually\ndistinguishable from Martinez, because there was no evidence that supported the\nconclusion that Griffin was a joint employer with TRI.\n       Bain‟s reliance on Futrell v. Payday California, Inc. (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1419\nis misplaced. Applying the three-pronged definition from Martinez, the Futrell court\nheld that a payroll processing company that provided payroll services to a producer of\ntelevision commercials was not a joint employer for the purposes of the wage statutes.\nThe payroll company exercised no control over the production company‟s employees,\nincluding their hiring or firing, rate of pay, work hours, or conditions; it did not “suffer”\nor permit the employees to work; and did not engage them in work. (Id. at pp. 1430-\n1435.) Futrell cited Reynolds, stating, “The extension of personal liability to the agents\nof an employer is not reasonably derived from the language and purposes of the Labor\nCode wage statutes.” (Id. at p. 1432; accord Aleksick v. 7-Eleven, Inc. (2012) 205\nCal.App.4th 1176, 1186-1191 [franchisor who provided payroll services to franchisee\nwas not a joint employer for the purposes of the wage statutes].) Moreover, Futrell is\n\n                                              45\n\fdistinguishable on its facts, since Griffin is an officer and shareholder of the corporate\nemployer, not a separate entity that provides services.\n       Following Reynolds and Martinez, we hold that Griffin was not an employer and\ncould not be held personally liable for failing to pay Bain‟s wages. We therefore\nconclude that the court did not err when it denied Bain‟s motion to amend at trial.\n\n                                       DISPOSITION\n\n              The trial court is directed to modify the judgment and strike the $7,700 in\nliquidated damages awarded as a penalty pursuant to section 1194.2. As so modified, the\njudgment is affirmed. Each side is to bear its own costs on appeal.\n\n\n                                    _______________________________\n                                    Márquez, J.\n\n       WE CONCUR:\n\n       ______________________________\n        Elia, Acting P.

No. CV112065)\n\n        v.\n\nTAX REDUCERS, INC.,\n\n        Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n\n        Defendant and appellant Tax Reducers, Inc. (TRI), appeals from a judgment after\na court trial in which the court awarded plaintiff and respondent Harold Bain damages for\nunpaid wages (Lab. Code §§ 202, 203, 1194, & 1194.2)1 and for breach of contract based\non a judicially supervised settlement of Bain‟s wage claim. TRI argues that the court\nerred when it (1) held that Bain‟s statutory wage claims were not barred by the statute of\nlimitations; (2) applied the presumption that every person who performs services is\npresumed to be an employee; and (3) imposed statutory penalties pursuant to both\nsections 203 and 1194.2.\n\n\n\n\n        1\n         All further statutory references are to the Labor Code, unless otherwise stated.\nSections 203 and 1194.2 were amended after Bain left TRI. (Stats 2008, ch. 169, § 2;\nStats 2011, ch. 272, § 2; see Historical and Statutory Notes, 44 West‟s Ann. Lab. Code\n(2011 ed.) foll. § 203, p. 335 & 44B West‟s Ann. Lab. Code (2013 supp.) foll. § 1194.2,\np. 7.) The amendments do not affect our analysis. All further references to sections 203\nand 1194.2 are to the statutory language in effect when Bain left TRI in February 2005.\n\f       Bain filed a cross-appeal challenging the court‟s rulings that James Brooks Griffin,\nTRI‟s president and majority shareholder, could not be held personally liable for Bain‟s\nwage claims.\n       On TRI‟s appeal, we hold that Bain‟s statutory wage claims under sections 202,\n203, and 1194, which are subject to a three-year limitations period, were not time-barred\nbecause the limitations period was equitably tolled while Bain pursued his administrative\nclaim before the Labor Commissioner. We conclude, however, that Bain‟s claim for the\nstatutory penalty for failure to pay minimum wages under section 1194.2 was time-barred\nbecause it is subject to a one-year limitations period and Bain‟s complaint was not filed\nwithin one year of the date the action before the Labor Commissioner became final.\nSince Bain‟s claim for the section 1194.2 penalty was time barred, we hold the trial court\nerred when it imposed that penalty. We do not reach TRI‟s other contentions regarding\nthe section 1194.2 penalty. We also hold that substantial evidence supports the trial\ncourt‟s finding that Bain was an employee under the multi-factor test in S. G. Borello &\nSons, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations (1989) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1431698\"><a href=\"/opinion/1431698/sg-borello-sons-v-department-of-industrial-rel/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (S. G. Borello) and\nthat there was no prejudicial error in the court‟s use of the presumption of employment.\nAnd we conclude that the trial court did not err in imposing a section 203 penalty for\nTRI‟s failure to timely pay final wages upon Bain‟s resignation.\n       On Bain‟s cross-appeal, we agree with the trial court that Griffin could not be held\npersonally liable for Bain‟s wage claims; thus, the trial court did not err when it denied\nBain‟s motion to amend the complaint to add Griffin as a defendant. Bain has also\nappealed the court‟s orders relating to attorney fees, which we discuss in a separate\nopinion filed concurrently herewith in Case No. H038002.\n       For the reasons stated below, we will modify the judgment to strike the $7,700\nawarded to Bain as a penalty under section 1194.2. As so modified, we will affirm the\njudgment.\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f                                         FACTS2\n\nDescription of TRI\n\n      TRI provides tax preparation and bookkeeping services to individuals and\nbusinesses. James Brooks Griffin has been the president and chief executive officer of\nTRI since 1997; Griffin owns two-thirds of the company‟s shares. TRI had three offices\nin Santa Clara County and decided to expand by purchasing another tax preparation\npractice. In December 2004, TRI purchased a tax preparation and accounting service in\nLos Altos known as Conard and Associates, which was owned by Paul Conard. Harold\nBain worked for Conard from April 2002 until December 31, 2004. Since TRI agreed to\nbring Bain on in the same capacity as he worked for Conard, it is necessary to describe\nBain‟s professional history with Conard as it relates to the question whether Bain was an\nemployee or an independent contractor when he worked for TRI.\n\nBain’s Working Relationship With Conard & Associates\n\n      Before going to work for Conard, Bain worked as an accountant. He attended\ntraining classes in tax preparation offered by the Voluntary Income Tax Assistance\n(VITA) program3 and helped people do their taxes as a VITA volunteer, but he did not\nhave a tax preparation business before working for Conard.\n      Bain did not bring any fee-paying clients with him when he started working for\nConard, but he had a “couple” of friends, whose taxes he had previously done for free,\nwho became Conard‟s clients. Bain did not have tax clients of his own while he worked\nfor Conard or TRI. The only outside “client” Bain had was the Los Altos Masonic\n\n\n      2\n         Except as otherwise noted, the facts are based on evidence presented at trial.\n      3\n         Although the program name suggests the acronym “VITA,” Bain used the\nacronym “VITAN” at trial. We shall use the acronym “VITA,” which is consistent with\nthe program name.\n\n                                            3\n\fTemple Association (LAMTA). Bain did LAMTA‟s tax return as part of his duties as a\nmember of its board.\n       When Bain started working for Conard, they agreed that he would be an\nindependent contractor and that Conard would pay him $1,100 for 32 hours of work per\nweek. If Bain worked less than 32 hours in a week, Conard paid him on an hourly basis,\nbased on the $1,100 weekly rate ($1,100 per week ÷ 32 hours = $34.38 per hour). If Bain\nworked 32 hours or more a week, Conard paid him the $1,100 weekly salary. Initially,\nBain prepared an invoice for Conard and was paid every two weeks. Conard did not\nmake any withholdings from Bain‟s pay and reported Bain‟s income as “non-employee\ncompensation” on a 1099 form. Since Conard issued him a 1099 form, Bain reported his\nincome to the IRS on a Schedule C (Profit or Loss From Business) form. Bain and\nConard did not have a written agreement describing their relationship.\n       While working for Conard, Bain went through the examination and investigation\nprocess necessary to become an “enrolled agent” with the IRS. After obtaining that\ncertificate, Bain was authorized to appear before the IRS. Bain‟s status as an enrolled\nagent did not require that he work as an independent contractor.\n       Bain‟s duties at Conard and Associates evolved over time and eventually included\nsetting up and dissolving corporations, and consulting on and maintaining computer\nnetworks. Bain helped Conard with advertising, pricing, hiring employees, and selecting\nclients; he managed the office when Conard was gone.\n       In the summer of 2004, Bain and Conard attended a seminar on the tax\nimplications of using employees versus independent contractors. During the seminar,\nthey both realized that Bain was actually an employee of Conard and Associates, not an\nindependent contractor. They agreed to continue their relationship as usual until the end\nof 2004 and that Conard would begin withholding taxes and treating Bain as an employee\nbeginning January 1, 2005. On July 9, 2004, Bain stopped giving Conard invoices for his\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\fservices and began reporting his time on the same time sheet used by Conard‟s\nemployees.\n\nBain’s Working Relationship with TRI\n\n       In December 2004, one month before the date Conard had agreed to begin treating\nBain as an employee, Bain and Conard‟s other two employees learned that Conard had\nsold his practice to TRI. They were worried about their jobs, so they asked Bain to\nrepresent them at a meeting with the new owner and to ask whether they would still have\njobs after January 1, 2005.\n       Bain met with Griffin in mid-December 2004. At that meeting, Griffin told Bain\nthey would all have jobs after January 1, 2005, and would be paid the same as before.\nGriffin said he had no interest in terminating the others, but said he was not sure he\nwould be able to retain Bain past tax season because he thought Bain was too expensive.\nBain made a suggestion for increasing revenue to justify keeping him on. Bain and\nGriffin did not discuss whether Bain would be an independent contractor or an employee.\n       After TRI acquired Conard and Associates, Bain and the other former Conard\nemployees continued working in the same office space Conard had occupied. By January\n2, 2005, no one had received a job application from TRI. That day, Bain put together a\npacket consisting of a W-4 form (withholding certificate), an I-9 immigration form\n(Employment Eligibility Verification), and copies of his enrolled agent certificate, his\nsocial security card, and his passport. Bain placed the packet on Griffin‟s desk. Griffin\ndenied receiving those documents.\n       In January 2005, Bain attended at least three meetings with Griffin and other staff\nin which Griffin presented new tax software, demonstrated the software, and gave a\npresentation on TRI, describing the Conard acquisition as a “high end tax preparation\noffice.” Bain went to the same meetings as other staff members, as Griffin told Bain to\nattend all staff meetings.\n\n                                             5\n\f       Griffin testified that tax preparation was the essential function of TRI‟s business.\nBain‟s duties at TRI included preparing tax returns, bookkeeping services for clients,\ncomputer network maintenance, meeting with prospective new clients, researching tax\nquestions, training other staff, attending continuing education meetings, answering\nphones, assembling tax returns, and filing.\n       After they started working for TRI, Griffin instructed Bain and the other former\nConard employees to continue using the same weekly time sheets they had used while\nworking for Conard. On the time sheets, the staff recorded the total number of hours\nworked each day, as well as information about the specific tasks accomplished, for both\ntime that was billable to clients and non-billable time. The billable time entries included\nthe name of the client, the type of task performed, the date, and the amount of time\nattributable to each task. Thus, the time sheets were used both as a time card and to\nrecord information that was used to bill clients. Bain and the other staff members\nrecorded their time daily and turned their time sheets in to Griffin weekly. Bain never\ninvoiced TRI separately for his time. TRI paid the other staff members, but not Bain,\nevery two weeks beginning in mid-January 2005.\n       After TRI acquired Conard and Associates, Bain no longer performed\nmanagement functions; those were assumed by Griffin. Bain testified that Griffin was his\nsupervisor. Griffin testified that he controlled how the Los Altos office operated. In\naddition, all the tax returns Bain prepared were reviewed by TRI‟s night auditor, who\nreviewed the work done by all of TRI‟s tax preparers. After the night auditor reviewed\nBain‟s returns, he left a list of things that needed to be corrected or researched further.\nGriffin told Bain that he had to follow the auditor‟s instructions until he and the auditor\ncame to a mutual resolution of the issues involved.\n       Bain did not operate an independent tax business while working for TRI. He did\nnot maintain a separate office for a tax preparation business, advertise his tax preparation\nservices, have his own website, have his own employees, or buy errors and omissions\n\n                                              6\n\fcoverage. TRI provided Bain with a business card. Bain worked for TRI on TRI‟s\npremises. TRI established the office hours (8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m.) and Griffin told the\nstaff he expected them to be in the office during those times. According to his time\nsheets, Bain generally started work between 7:30 and 8:30 a.m. and left between 4:00 and\n5:30 p.m. During the seven weeks Bain worked for TRI, he took one sick day, plus time\noff for a doctor‟s appointment and for personal business; each time, he discussed the\ntime-off request with Griffin. Bain did not pay for the office space he used at TRI. TRI\ngave Bain a set of keys to the office, just like it did other employees. When expanding\nhis business, Conard did not have a lot of money, so Bain lent him a desk, a chair, a wall\nunit, and a printer stand, which Bain used in his office. Bain continued to use his own\noffice furniture after TRI purchased the practice. Bain purchased his own keyboard and\ncomputer mouse, which he preferred over the ones Conard provided. TRI owned the rest\nof the office furniture, the computers, the photocopier, the filing cabinets, and the phones.\nTRI provided all of the office supplies.\n       TRI controlled which clients Bain saw. Griffin took over at least one individual\nclient that Bain had previously handled; he told Bain that he wanted him to work\nprimarily on corporate and partnership returns and more complex individual returns. TRI\nestablished the rate schedule and billed the clients. However, the tax preparers\ndetermined which rate to charge from the schedule, based on the scope and breadth of the\nservices provided.\n       At the end of January 2005, Bain asked Griffin when he would be paid. On\nFebruary 5, 2005, Griffin left an independent contractor agreement on Bain‟s desk. The\nagreement proposed paying Bain $27.50 per hour (less than what Conard had paid) and\nterminating Bain‟s services on June 30, 2005. Bain believed he was an employee and\nGriffin was trying to change his status from employee to independent contractor. Bain\nfound the agreement unacceptable and returned it to Griffin with a note that stated, “Let‟s\ndo employee status without a ten percent reduction.” Later, Bain and Griffin discussed\n\n                                             7\n\fthe independent contractor agreement. Griffin explained that he got the $27.50 hourly\nrate by dividing Bain‟s weekly rate ($1,100) by 40 hours. Bain explained that his pay\nwas based on a 32-hour week and told Griffin that he was supposed to be an employee,\nnot an independent contractor. Griffin said he would discuss the matter with Conard.\n       Bain resigned from TRI on Friday, February 18, 2005. In his resignation letter,\nBain stated that since TRI had failed to pay him for seven weeks and failed to reimburse\nhim for expenses he had submitted, Bain did not “feel it necessary to give the customary\ntwo week notice.” Bain told Griffin he would remove his belongings from the office by\nSunday, February 20, 2005.\n       Griffin responded to Bain‟s letter in writing on February 19, 2005. Griffin\npresented Bain with a modified independent contractor agreement in which he agreed to\npay Bain $1,100 per week for seven weeks of work. Griffin‟s letter stated that before\nTRI would pay Bain, Bain would have to sign the modified independent contractor\nagreement and to provide information about work in progress, a missing client file, and\nthe segregation of TRI software from Bain‟s personal software. Griffin left the letter and\nthe modified agreement on Bain‟s desk. Bain saw the letter and the agreement on\nFebruary 20, 2005. Bain did not sign the modified agreement because he believed it\nchanged his employment conditions retroactively and restricted his ability to work.\n       On March 1, 2005, Bain filed a claim for his unpaid wages and expenses with the\nCalifornia Labor Commissioner. On March 17, 2005, Bain sent TRI a letter demanding\nhis unpaid wages and expenses. On March 23, 2005, Griffin sent Bain a letter stating that\nTRI‟s offer to pay $7,700 in wages “still stands.” But, Griffin did not tender a check.\nTRI has never paid Bain for his work. Griffin testified he never paid Bain because they\ncould not reach an agreement for him to be paid.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f                                 PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       Because of the statute of limitations issues presented, including the question of\nequitable tolling, we shall describe the complex procedural history of this case.\n\nProceedings Before the Labor Commissioner\n\n       In his complaint before the Labor Commissioner, Bain claimed $7,700 in unpaid\nwages, $157.26 for unpaid expenses, and $6,600 in waiting time penalties ($220 per day\nfor 30 days; § 203), plus interest. Bain represented himself in the proceedings before the\nLabor Commissioner.\n       TRI filed a written response, which alleged that Bain was not entitled to wages or\npenalties because he was never an employee and because his “sole relationship to [TRI]\nwas business to business.” TRI alleged Bain never filled out an employment application\nor W-4 forms and refused to sign an independent contractor agreement. Griffin admitted\nthat TRI had several employees and that Bain was the only one he considered to be\nworking as an independent contractor. TRI argued that even if Bain was an employee,\nthe parties never agreed to an amount to be paid as wages and that Bain was therefore\n“entitled to minimum wage and no more.” TRI contended that Bain was not entitled to\npenalties under section 203 because he was never an employee and had “rebuffed\nmultiple attempts to finalize the contract and get paid.” TRI also argued that it would be\n“unconscionable” to allow Bain to “profit . . . from his intransigence” and urged the\ndepartment to “decline to intervene in this contractual dispute.”\n       The Labor Commissioner conducted a hearing on March 9, 2006, more than a year\nafter Bain filed his claim. Griffin appeared on behalf of TRI at the hearing and gave Bain\na check for $157.26 to cover his business expenses. The hearing officer found that\nalthough TRI considered Bain an independent contractor, Bain did not meet the criteria\nestablished in section 2750.5 for independent contractor status, and concluded that the\n\n\n                                             9\n\fparties had an employer-employee relationship. The hearing officer awarded Bain\n$7,700 “for wages (with lawful deductions),” $805.86 in interest (§ 98.1), and $6,600 in\nwaiting time penalties (§ 203), for a total award of $15,105.86.\n\nFirst Action in the Superior Court (TRI’s Appeal of Labor Commissioner’s Decision)\n\n       TRI retained counsel and appealed the Labor Commissioner‟s decision to the\nsuperior court (Santa Clara County Superior Court Case No. 1-06-CV063080). Although\nlabeled an “appeal,” the proceedings in the superior court are actually a trial de novo, in\nwhich the decision of the Labor Commissioner is not entitled to any weight. (Murphy v.\nKenneth Cole Productions, Inc. (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1094</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1116 (Murphy).) As required by\nsection 98.2, subdivision (b), TRI deposited $15,105.86 (the amount of the Labor\nCommissioner‟s award) with the superior court. Bain retained counsel of his own and the\ncase was initially set for trial on July 24, 2006.\n\n       Efforts to Settle in July 2006\n\n       In July 2006, the parties agreed to settle the case for $9,791, which included\n$7,700 for Bain‟s wage claim, $1,000 for attorney fees, and $1,091 in interest. TRI gave\nnotice of the settlement to the court and the trial date was vacated. Later, however, they\nwere unable to agree on the scope and terms of a written release. The parties disputed\nwhether the settlement included a release of all claims or just the wage claim that was\nadjudicated before the Labor Commissioner. There were additional issues between the\nparties, including a non-competition claim and a defamation claim by Bain, which was\nbased on things Griffin said about Bain after he left TRI. At one point, Bain offered to\nexecute a general release of all claims in exchange for an additional $1,250 and TRI‟s\npromise not to contest his status as an employee in response to inquiries about his\nemployment. TRI never agreed to those terms.\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f       Judicially Supervised Settlement in December 2006\n\n       After settlement failed, the case was re-set for trial on December 11, 2006. On the\nfirst day of trial, the parties settled the case in a judicially supervised proceeding. The\nterms of the settlement were placed on the record, as follows: “Case will be settled by\nthe defendant making a total payment of $17,700. The parties will provide mutual\ngeneral releases including [Civil Code section] 1542 releases to the parties and the\nofficers, employees, attorneys, agent, etc. anyone, anyone acting on behalf of either of the\nparties.” The parties stipulated to an order for the immediate release of the bond. TRI\nagreed to make two payments by January 31, 2007 of $7,700 to Bain and $10,000 to\nBain‟s attorney. The parties agreed that the payments would be made “without deduction\nfor taxes or withholdings. And Mr. Bain will indemnify the company against any tax\nclaims.” TRI agreed that if it is “contacted and requested to confirm Mr. Bain‟s having\nworked there, the company will confirm that Mr. Bain worked with the company in\nJanuary and February of 2005 and that he was paid $1,100 a week.” Both Bain and\nGriffin agreed to the terms of the settlement on the record. The court told TRI how to\nobtain release of the bond money and set the case for a dismissal review hearing on\nFebruary 8, 2007. The court did not retain jurisdiction over the settlement.\n\n       Release of the Bond, Problems With the Written Release, & Dismissal of the\n       Action\n\n       On or about December 29, 2006, the court issued TRI a check for $15,532.34 (the\namount deposited with the court, plus interest). Although TRI expected Bain to sign a\nwritten release as part of the settlement, TRI‟s counsel did not prepare a release any time\nprior to January 31, 2007, the date agreed upon for payment of the settlement proceeds.\nGriffin said he expected Bain‟s counsel to prepare the release, even though the parties\nhad not agreed to that, because Griffin did not want to pay his lawyer to do it.\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f       TRI‟s counsel forwarded a proposed release agreement to Bain‟s counsel in March\n2007 and the parties disputed the language of that release for a number of months. On\nJanuary 10, 2008, Bain‟s counsel prepared a proposed release and forwarded it to TRI‟s\ncounsel. Although Griffin testified that the January 2008 release was consistent with the\nterms of the settlement that had been placed on the record, he stated he never saw that\nrelease. But Griffin testified that he would not have signed the January 2008 release\nbecause it was “invalid” since it required payment by January 31, 2007, a date that had\nlong passed. This became a point of contention between the attorneys. TRI‟s attorney\ndemanded that the term requiring tender of the $17,700 by January 31, 2007 be changed\nto “within 10 days of execution” of the release by Bain. Bain‟s attorney agreed to do so\nif TRI paid Bain interest from January 31, 2007; otherwise, he would file a motion to\nenforce the settlement agreement under Civil Code section 664.6. TRI refused to pay\ninterest, arguing that Bain would not be awarded interest if the court ordered enforcement\nof the settlement agreement.\n       Bain‟s counsel later determined that the case had been dismissed at the dismissal\nreview hearing on February 8, 2007, and that the court no longer had jurisdiction to\nenforce the settlement under Civil Code section 664.6. Bain therefore sought to enforce\nthe settlement by filing a second action in the superior court.\n\nSecond Action in the Superior Court (Bain’s Action to Obtain Monies Owed)\n\n       Pre-trial Proceedings\n\n       Bain filed the instant action on May 7, 2008. The complaint contained causes of\naction to enforce the December 2006 judicially supervised settlement, for breach of\ncontract based on that settlement, for money had and received, to recover wages based on\nviolations of the Labor Code, and for conversion of the bond money. TRI filed a cross-\ncomplaint alleging breach of contract based on the July 2006 settlement.\n\n\n                                             12\n\f       TRI filed three motions at the pleading stage. Its demurrers to the first four causes\nof action in the original complaint were overruled, but its demurrer to the conversion\nclaim was sustained with leave to amend. TRI then responded to Bain‟s first amended\ncomplaint with a special demurrer on the ground of uncertainty and a special motion to\nstrike the causes of action for Labor Code violations and for conversion as a strategic\nlawsuit against public participation (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16), otherwise known as an\nanti-SLAPP motion. (Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2519835\"><a href=\"/opinion/2519835/equilon-enterprises-v-consumer-cause-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n57.) TRI argued that those two causes of action were barred by the litigation privilege\n(Civ. Code, § 47) because they were both based on the release of the bond. Bain opposed\nthe anti-SLAPP motion, arguing that it was “another delay tactic to avoid paying the\n2005 wages and the 2006 settlement.”\n       The court overruled the special demurrer, denied the special motion to strike, and\ndenied both parties‟ requests for attorney fees for the special motion to strike. TRI\nappealed the trial court‟s order on the special motion to strike to this court. We affirmed\nthe trial court‟s order in an unpublished opinion. (Bain v. Tax Reducers, Inc. (May 17,\n2010, H033632).\n       In September 2010, Bain amended his first amended complaint to name Griffin,\nindividually, as a Doe defendant. According to Bain‟s counsel, the amendment was\nprompted by the Supreme Court‟s May 2010 decision in Martinez v. Combs (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2630272\"><a href=\"/opinion/2630272/martinez-v-combs/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Martinez), which Bain‟s counsel contends “re-defin[ed] the term „employer‟\nunder the Labor Code.”\n       The parties engaged in discovery, which generated four discovery motions in the\ntrial court. Each of the parties then sought summary judgment or summary adjudication.\nBain filed a motion for summary adjudication of his cause of action alleging Labor Code\nviolations. TRI sought summary adjudication of two causes of action. It argued that the\ncause of action for Labor Code violations and wages due was barred by the statute of\nlimitations and by Bain‟s election to enforce the settlement agreement in the prior\n\n                                            13\n\flawsuit. TRI asserted that the conversion claim failed because: TRI‟s actions were\nprivileged, Bain consented to release of the bond, Bain never demanded the bond money\nor asked TRI to redeposit it with the court, and Bain was never entitled to that money.\nGriffin filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that he was not personally liable\nfor Bain‟s claims.\n       The trial court denied Bain‟s and TRI”s motions for summary adjudication, but it\ngranted Griffin‟s motion for summary judgment. Regarding Griffin‟s motion, the court\nobserved that Bain had conceded that Griffin was not liable on his first three causes of\naction. The court concluded that Griffin had met his initial burden of demonstrating that\nthere were no triable issues of material fact regarding (1) the claim for Labor Code\nviolations “as [Griffin] was not Bain‟s employer but rather a corporate officer of TRI,”\nand (2) the conversion claim, since the “bond funds were released to TRI and [Griffin]\ndid not personally receive the bond funds at issue.”\n\n       Trial & Statement of Decision\n\n       The court conducted a four-day court trial in April and May 2011. At trial, the\ncourt denied Bain‟s request to amend his complaint to add Griffin as a defendant on the\ntheory that Griffin was individually liable for Bain‟s wages. At trial, Griffin testified that\nhe did not intend to pay Bain absent a court order.\n       The court filed a 21-page statement of decision, which contained findings of fact\nand conclusions of law. The court found that “TRI operated as employer” and “Bain was\nits employee, and [TRI] employed Bain to perform the integral functions of a tax preparer\nfor the business.” The court found that TRI‟s labeling Bain an “independent contractor”\nand Bain‟s receipt of a 1099 form from Conard and his filing of a Schedule C while\nemployed by Conard had no legal effect on his status as an employee. The court\nconcluded that Bain‟s statutory wage claims were governed by the three-year limitations\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fperiod in Code of Civil Procedure section 339 subdivision (1)4 and that the claims were\nnot barred by the statute of limitations because TRI had agreed to pay wages on January\n31, 2007, as part of the December 2006 settlement agreement. Alternatively, the court\nheld that Bain was entitled to rely on the doctrine of equitable tolling because he had\n“consistently pursued his remedies in multiple fora, including trying to resolve the issues\nwithout resort to Court again” and TRI was not prejudiced by the delay. The court found\nthat there was no conversion of the bond funds because Bain had not established that he\nwas entitled to the money when it was released by the court and had not presented any\nevidence that he ever asked TRI to return the money to him or to the court. The court\ndenied relief on TRI‟s cross-complaint for breach of contract, reasoning that there was no\nmeeting of the minds regarding the terms of a settlement agreement at that time and that\nthe December 2006 settlement was an accord and satisfaction of any claims TRI may\nhave had based on the July 2006 negotiations.\n       After trial, the court made two alternative awards from which Bain could choose\nwhen he prepared the judgment. As a first alternative, the court awarded Bain the\nfollowing on his causes of action based on the December 2006 settlement: $7,700 as\nwages; $10,000 as attorney fees; and $7,669.94 as statutory 10 percent interest on both\namounts from January 31, 2007 through May 31, 2011. These awards amounted to a\ntotal of $25,369.94, plus costs of suit. Alternatively, on the fourth cause of action for\nviolations of the Labor Code, the court awarded Bain: $7,700 in unpaid wages (§ 201-\n202), $6,600 in penalties for intentionally withholding wages (§ 203), $7,700 as\nliquidated damages for failure to pay at least minimum wages (§§ 1194, 1194.2), and\n\n\n       4\n         Code of Civil Procedure section 339, subdivision (1) provides that the\nlimitations period for an action based on an oral contract is two years. Although the court\ncited Code of Civil Procedure section 339, subdivision (1), it likely meant Code of Civil\nProcedure section 338, subdivision (a), which provides that the limitations period for an\n“action based on a liability created by statute” is three years. The parties do not address\nthis apparent error in the statement of decision.\n\n                                             15\n\f$3,368.75 in prejudgment interest at the rate of seven percent on $7,700 for February 19,\n2005 through May 28, 2011, for a total of $25,368.75. The court also awarded Bain\nattorney fees and costs.\n       TRI filed objections to the statement of decision, which the court rejected. Bain\nelected the remedy provided by his fourth cause of action and the court entered judgment\nfor Bain on August 15, 2011.\n       Both sides appealed. After the notices of appeal were filed, Bain filed a motion\nfor attorney fees and costs. Bain claimed “Lodestar Fees” totaling $276,235 based on\n470.2 hours of attorney time and 92.75 hours of paralegal time. Bain also argued that he\nwas entitled to “an enhancement factor of 1.5, for a total of $414,352.5 . . . due to [TRI‟s]\ninsistence on overly zealous and vigorous litigation, and re-litigation of certain issues,\nand [its] refusal to settle this matter given the admission that [it] did not pay Bain.”\nGriffin filed a motion for attorney fees based on his successful motion for summary\njudgment. The court‟s order on the attorney fees claims is the subject of a separate\nappeal in Bain v. Tax Reducers, Court of Appeal Case No. H038002.\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\n       TRI argues that the court erred (1) when it held that the action was not barred by\nthe statute of limitations; (2) when it applied the presumption that every person who\nperforms services is presumed to be an employee; and (3) when it imposed statutory\npenalties pursuant to sections 203 and 1194.2. Bain filed a cross-appeal challenging the\ncourt‟s rulings on (1) Griffin‟s motion for summary judgment and (2) Bain‟s motion to\namend his complaint at trial to add Griffin as a defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\f   I. TRI’s Appeal\n\n       A. Statute of Limitations\n\n       TRI contends that the applicable statute of limitations bars Bain‟s recovery of\nmonies owed. Although not expressly stated in TRI‟s opening brief, it appears this\ncontention is limited to Bain‟s fourth cause of action for violations of the Labor Code\narising out of TRI‟s failure to pay wages. TRI‟s opening brief does not argue that the\ncontract-based causes of action to enforce the settlement agreement were time barred.\n       Regarding the wage claims, TRI observes that there was no written employment\ncontract between the parties and argues that the limitations period on an action based on\nan oral contract is two years under Code of Civil Procedure section 339, subdivision (1).5\nAlternatively, TRI argues that Bain‟s claim for unpaid minimum wages is a statutory\nclaim based on section 1194 and that it is therefore governed by the three-year limitations\nperiod in Code of Civil Procedure section 338. Bain filed this action on May 7, 2008.\nTRI argues: “Counting back two years from May 7, 2008, all claims for amounts due on\nan oral contract before May 7, 2006 are barred. Counting back three years . . . , all claims\nbased upon a statute for payments due before May 7, 2005 are barred. Since [Bain]\nclaims he is owed payments that were due no later than February 18, 2005, all of these\nclaims are barred, whether they are „contract payments‟ or „wages.‟ ”\n       The trial court disagreed with TRI‟s analysis. The court held that the “statute of\nlimitations for any violation of the Labor Code regarding wages is three years,” and that\nBain‟s claims were not barred by the statute of limitations because (1) Bain was entitled\nto rely on the doctrine of equitable tolling; and (2) the three-year limitations period began\nto run on January 31, 2007, the date TRI had promised to pay wages under the settlement\n\n       5\n         Code of Civil Procedure section 339, subdivision (1) provides that the\nlimitations period for “[a]n action upon a contract, obligation or liability not founded\nupon an instrument of writing” is “two years.”\n\n                                             17\n\fagreement. TRI challenges each of the court‟s holdings regarding the statute of\nlimitations.\n\n               1. Three-Year Limitations Period for Bain’s Claims Based on Labor\n                  Code Sections 201, 203 and 1194\n\n       We begin by determining the applicable limitations period. Contrary to TRI‟s\nassertion, Bain sought more than unpaid minimum wages (§ 1194) in his fourth cause of\naction for violations of the Labor Code. Bain‟s first amended complaint alleged\nviolations of section 201 (failure to immediately pay wages upon discharge6), section 203\n(penalty for failure to pay wages as required by sections 201 or 202), and sections 1194\nand 1194.2 (failure to pay minimum wages).\n       Generally speaking, a cause of action based on a wage liability created by statute\nmust be commenced within three years after the cause of action has accrued.

Proc., § 338, subd. (a).) “A cause of action\nfor unpaid wages accrues when the wages first become legally due, i.e., on the regular\npayday for the pay period in which the employee performed the work; when the work is\ncontinuing and the employee is therefore paid periodically (e.g. weekly or monthly) a\nseparate and distinct cause of action accrues on each payday, triggering on each occasion\n       6\n          Section 201 provides in relevant part: “If an employer discharges an employee,\nthe wages earned and unpaid at the time of discharge are due and payable immediately.”\nSection 202 provides in part: “If an employee not having a written contract for a definite\nperiod quits his or her employment, his or her wages shall become due and payable no\nlater than 72 hours thereafter, unless the employee has given 72 hours previous notice of\nhis or her intention to quit, in which case the employee is entitled to his or her wage at the\ntime of quitting.” Although Bain‟s first amended complaint claimed a violation of\nsection 201, it did not mention section 202. Arguably his claim was governed by section\n202, since he resigned from TRI (§ 202) and was not terminated (§ 201). The trial court\nawarded Bain his unpaid wages, citing both sections 201 and 202 and TRI does not\nchallenge that conclusion. Since Bain resigned without giving 72 hours notice, his\nunpaid wages were due within three days after he resigned, or no later than February 21,\n2005. To this day, more than eight years later, TRI has never paid Bain.\n\n                                             18\n\fthe running of a new period of limitations.” (Ibid.) In view of this rule, we agree with\nTRI‟s contention that the trial court erred when it concluded that the limitations period\nbegan to run on January 31, 2007, the date the wage payment was due under the\nDecember 2006 settlement agreement.\n       More specifically, “[a]ctions for final wages not paid as required by sections 201\nand 202 are governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (a), which\nprovides that a three-year statute of limitations applies to „[a]n action upon a liability\ncreated by statute, other than a penalty or forfeiture.‟ ” (Pineda v.

The same three-year limitations period applies to Bain‟s\nclaim for section 203 penalties. (Id. at p. 1398; § 203.) Bain‟s statutory minimum wage\nclaim (§ 1194) is also governed by the three-year limitations period, since it is a liability\ncreated by statute. (See Aubry v. Goldhor (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2124543\"><a href=\"/opinion/2124543/aubry-v-goldhor/\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(1), now § 338, subd. (a)].)\n\n              2. One-Year Limitations Period for Bain’s Claim Based on Labor Code\n                 Section 1194.2 (Liquidated Damages)\n\n       However, a different limitations period governs Bain‟s claim for liquidated\ndamages under section 1194.2. In their initial briefing, both parties assert that all of\nBain‟s wage claims, including the claim for liquidated damages under section 1194.2, are\nsubject to a three-year limitations period. We requested supplemental briefing from the\nparties on the question whether Bain‟s section 1194.2 claim is subject to the three-year\nlimitations period for a liability created by statute (Code Civ. Proc., § 338, subd. (a)) or\nthe one-year limitations period for a statutory penalty (Code Civ. Proc., § 340, subd. (a)).\nAs we shall explain, we conclude that the section 1194.2 claim is subject to the one-year\nlimitations period for statutory penalties in Code of Civil Procedure section 340,\nsubdivision (a).\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\f       Section 1194.2 provides in relevant part: “(a) In any action under . . . Section\n1194 to recover wages because of the payment of a wage less than the minimum wage\nfixed by an order of the commission, an employee shall be entitled to recover liquidated\ndamages in an amount equal to the wages unlawfully unpaid and interest thereon.” “The\n„liquidated damages‟ allowed in section 1194.2 are in effect a penalty equal to the\namount of unpaid minimum wages.”7 (Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 48, fn. 8.)\n       The three-year limitations period in Code of Civil Procedure section 338,\nsubdivision (a), applies to an “action upon a liability created by statute, other than a\npenalty or forfeiture.” (Italics added.) Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision\n(a) provides that the limitations period “upon a statute for a penalty” is one year, “except\nif the statute imposing it prescribes a different limitation.” Although both sections 203\nand 1194.2 impose penalties, the court in Pineda concluded that the longer three-year\nlimitations period in Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (a) applies to\nclaims for section 203 penalties since section 203 provides that “[s]uit may be filed for\nthese penalties at any time before the expiration of the statute of limitations on an action\nfor the wages from which the penalties arise” and thereby expressly prescribes a different\nlimitations period. (Pineda, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 1395.)\n       Unlike section 203, nothing in section 1194.2 “prescribes a different limitation[s]”\nperiod or otherwise exempts section 1194.2 from the one-year limitations period in Code\nof Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (a). Absent an express authorization to apply\na different limitations period, we conclude that the one-year limitations period in Code of\nCivil Procedure section 340, subdivision (a) applies to Bain‟s claim for section 1194.2\npenalties.\n\n       7\n          The plain text of section 1194.2 applies to “the payment of a wage” that is less\nthan the current minimum wage. Here, no wage was paid to Bain. But we need not\ndetermine whether section 1194.2 could provide relief under these circumstances\nbecause: (1) the one-year statute of limitations had expired; and (2) the parties do not\nraise this point.\n\n                                             20\n\f              3. Equitable Tolling Applies\n\n       Bain‟s claims accrued no later than February 18, 2005, the last day he worked for\nTRI. Bain filed his complaint on May 7, 2008, more than three years after that date. His\nstatutory wage claims, whether subject to the three-year limitations period or the one-year\nlimitations period, would therefore be barred, unless Bain can demonstrate that the\nlimitations period was equitably tolled.\n       The most recent Supreme Court case to discuss the equitable tolling doctrine is\nMcDonald v. Antelope Valley Community College District (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(McDonald). “Broadly speaking, the doctrine applies „ “[w]hen an injured person has\nseveral legal remedies and, reasonably and in good faith, pursues one.” ‟ [Citations.]\nThus, it may apply where one action stands to lessen the harm that is the subject of a\npotential second action; where administrative remedies must be exhausted before a\nsecond action can proceed; or where a first action, embarked upon in good faith, is found\nto be defective for some reason. [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 100.) “Equitable tolling is a fact\nintensive issue and it is determined based upon evidence. Accordingly, we are compelled\nto affirm the trial court‟s [order based on that] theory if there is substantial evidence to\nsupport its determination.” (Thomas v. Gilliland (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2299574\"><a href=\"/opinion/2299574/thomas-v-gilliland/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The Addison court stated\nthat the equitable tolling rule requires a showing of three elements: “ „timely notice, and\nlack of prejudice, to the defendant, and reasonable and good faith conduct on the part of\nthe plaintiff.‟ ” (McDonald, at p. 102, citing Addison, supra, at p. 319.) Finally, in Jones\nv. Tracy School Dist. (1980) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1120027\"><a href=\"/opinion/1120027/jones-v-tracy-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 107-109, the court reversed a summary\njudgment on the ground that equitable tolling may apply to the limitations period for a\nwage discrimination claim (§ 1197.5) while the plaintiff pursued a related claim under the\nfederal Fair Labor Standards Act.\n       Bain had two concurrent remedies to recover his unpaid wages. He could “seek\njudicial relief by filing an ordinary civil action against the employer for breach of\ncontract and/or for the wages prescribed by statute” or he could seek administrative relief\nby filing a wage claim with the Labor Commissioner. (Reynolds v. Bement (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2567023\"><a href=\"/opinion/2567023/reynolds-v-bement/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1075</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1084-1085 (Reynolds).) Bain decided to pursue administrative relief and\nfiled his claim with the Labor Commissioner on March 1, 2005, eleven days after he\nresigned from TRI. Although the pursuit of his administrative claim was not a\nprerequisite to filing a judicial action, that does not bar a finding of equitable tolling.\n(McDonald, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 101; Murphy, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 1117.) TRI filed\na written response and, about one year later, in March 2006, the parties went to trial\nbefore a hearing officer for the Labor Commissioner. The Labor Commissioner found\nfor Bain and served its decision and order on the parties on April 21, 2006. On or about\n\n       8\n         This case does not involve a remedy against a public defendant, but it did\ninvolve the filing of a wage claim with the Labor Commissioner.\n\n                                               22\n\fMay 5, 2006, TRI filed its appeal from the Labor Commissioner‟s decision in the trial\ncourt. Such an appeal “is neither a conventional appeal nor review of the Labor\nCommissioner‟s decision, but is rather a de novo trial of the wage dispute.” (Murphy,\nsupra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 1116.) The parties engaged in discovery and the case was set for\ntrial de novo on December 11, 2006; the parties settled on the first day of trial.\n       Substantial evidence supports the trial court‟s conclusion that the equitable tolling\ndoctrine applied. Regarding the first element, the “ „ “timely notice requirement\nessentially means that the first claim must have been filed within the statutory period.\nFurthermore[,] the filing of the first claim must alert the defendant in the second claim of\nthe need to begin investigating the facts which form the basis for the second claim.\nGenerally this means that the defendant in the first claim is the same one being sued in\nthe second.” ‟ ” (McDonald, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 102, fn 2, quoting Collier v. City of\nPasadena (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2169291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2169291/collier-v-city-of-pasadena/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">917</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 924.) Bain promptly filed his claim with the\nLabor Commissioner 11 days after he resigned, well within the limitations period, and the\ndefendants in both the administrative action and the judicial action were the same.\n       The second element (lack of prejudice to the defendant) “ „ “essentially translates\nto a requirement that the facts of the two claims be identical or at least so similar that the\ndefendant‟s investigation of the first claim will put him in a position to fairly defend the\nsecond.” ‟ ” (McDonald, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 102, fn 2.) Here, both claims were\nalmost identical and involved Bain‟s unpaid wages and whether Bain was an employee or\nan independent contractor. TRI received prompt notice of the wage claim and an\nopportunity to investigate it. TRI filed a written response to the administrative claim and\nparticipated in the trial before the Labor Commissioner. TRI appealed the Labor\nCommissioner‟s decision, conducted discovery, and prepared for the trial de novo.\nGriffin was the only witness for TRI; he appeared at both the administrative hearing\nbefore the Labor Commissioner and for the trial de novo in the superior court. All of this\n\n\n\n                                              23\n\factivity on the administrative claim gave TRI ample opportunity to prepare its defense.\nMoreover, TRI does not argue that it was prejudiced in this regard.\n       The third element “ „ “of good faith and reasonable conduct on the part of the\nplaintiff is less clearly defined in the cases. But in Addison . . . , supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1174698\"><a href=\"/opinion/1174698/addison-v-state-of-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">[,]\nthe Supreme Court did stress that the plaintiff filed his second claim a short time after\ntolling ended.” ‟ ” (McDonald, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 102, fn 2, quoting Downs v.\nDepartment of Water & Power (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2272365\"><a href=\"/opinion/2272365/downs-v-dept-of-water-power-of-city-of-los-angeles/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

After the first case was settled, the\ncourt set the matter for hearing on the dismissal calendar on February 8, 2007. Although\na defendant generally prepares a release, TRI did not send Bain a release until March\n2007; the parties disputed the language of that release for several months. In January\n2008, Bain‟s counsel forwarded a proposed release to TRI‟s counsel. Although Griffin\ntestified that Bain‟s release was consistent with the terms of the settlement the parties had\nagreed to on the record, TRI‟s counsel disputed the applicability of certain terms, given\nthe passage of time. Based on their letters, it appears that throughout this time, both\ncounsel believed the court still had jurisdiction to hear a motion to enforce the settlement\n(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6). It is not clear when they learned that the case had been\ndismissed. The attorneys last corresponded about Bain‟s proposed release on January 31,\n2008, and at that time appeared to believe that a motion to enforce was available to them.\nBain filed his civil action on May 7, 2008, a little more than three months later. Given\nBain‟s active pursuit of his administrative claim and his repeated efforts to finalize the\nDecember 2006 settlement, there was sufficient evidence to support the court‟s implied\nfinding that he acted in good faith.\n       The equitable tolling rule suspends the running of the limitations period through\nthe date on which the decision in the first action becomes final. (Elkins, supra, 12\nCal.3d at p. 413, fn. 1.) The first superior court action (TRI‟s appeal of the Labor\nCommissioner‟s decision) was dismissed on February 8, 2007; that order became final 60\n\n                                              24\n\fdays later on April 9, 2007. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.104(a).) Three years from that\ndate is April 9, 2010. Therefore, Bain‟s complaint, filed on May 7, 2008, was timely as\nto his statutory wage claims under sections 201, 202, 203, and 1194 since they are subject\nto a three-year limitations period.9 However, Bain‟s claim for the section 1194.2 penalty,\nwhich is subject to a one-year limitations period, is barred since his complaint was filed\nmore than one year after the decision in the first action became final.\n       TRI argues that equitable tolling does not apply because the doctrine was designed\nto “protect a plaintiff who inadvertently pursues a remedy in the incorrect forum, and as\na result, delays filing in the correct forum until the statute of limitations has expired.”\nTRI contends that since Bain filed his first claim in a correct forum, he cannot rely on\nequitable tolling because he had an adequate legal remedy and used it. TRI relies on\nthree cases: Addison, Elkins and Jones.\n       The plaintiffs in Addison filed a timely tort action against the state and county in\nfederal court alleging violations of state and federal law. After holding that the plaintiffs\ncould not state a claim under federal law, the court dismissed the federal claim and\ndecided not to retain jurisdiction over the state law claims. The plaintiffs then filed their\naction, after the limitations period had run, in state court. But they did so before the\nfederal court filed its dismissal order. Our high court held that the limitations period was\ntolled while the action was pending in federal court. (Addison, supra, 21 Cal.3d at pp.\n315-316.)\n       The plaintiff in Elkins filed a workers‟ compensation action.

Since Bain did not have a written\ncontract of employment, the applicable limitations period would be two years (Code Civ.\nProc., § 339 [oral agreements]). (Cuadra, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 859.) But even if the\ntwo-year limitations period applied, Bain‟s claims would still be timely, because of the\nequitable tolling.\n\n                                              25\n\femployee, the plaintiff filed an untimely civil action against the same defendant. The\ncourt held that the statute of limitations was tolled while the plaintiff pursued his\nworkers‟ compensation remedy. (Elkins, supra, 12 Cal.3d at pp. 412-413.)\n       The plaintiff in Jones filed a wage discrimination claim in state court. The court\nin that case reversed a summary judgment because there were triable issues whether the\nlimitations period on the plaintiff‟s claim was tolled while she pursued her federal\nadministrative remedy. (Jones, supra, 27 Cal.3d at pp. 107-109.)\n       In Addison, Elkins and Jones, the Supreme Court held that equitable tolling applies\n“when an injured person has several formal legal remedies and reasonably and in good\nfaith pursues one.” (Jones, supra, 27 Cal.3d at p. 108.) The test is not whether the first\naction was brought in the correct forum or an incorrect forum as TRI asserts, but whether\nthe person acted reasonably and in good faith. In this case, when faced with a choice of\nforums, Bain reasonably and in good faith pursued his claim before the Labor\nCommissioner. Contrary to TRI‟s assertion, Bain‟s administrative claim was never\nresolved. Although Bain prevailed before the Labor Commissioner, TRI requested a trial\nde novo in the superior court, purported to settle the case, and then refused to complete\nthe settlement. Bain‟s claims were dismissed for reasons that had nothing to do with the\nmerits of his case.\n       Citing Wood v.

Summons was\npromptly served on the individuals, but not the corporations. The corporations were later\ndismissed for delay in service of summons. After obtaining a judgment against the\nindividual defendants, the plaintiff filed a second action in the same court, seeking to\nhold the corporations jointly and severally liable for that judgment on an alter ego theory.\n\n                                              26\n\f(Wood, supra, 20 Cal.3d at pp. 357-358.) The Supreme Court held that when a case is\ndismissed for failure to serve summons or bring the matter to trial within the statutory\ntime limits (former Code Civ. Proc., §§ 581a, 583), the statute of limitations applies as if\nthe prior action had never been brought. (Wood, at p. 360.) The court distinguished\nElkins, reasoning that Wood did not involve a claim that could be brought in two different\nforums and instead involved “a plaintiff‟s failure to diligently pursue the sole avenue of\nlegal recourse available to him.” (Id. at p. 360, fn. 4.)\n       Thomas was a medical malpractice case in which the plaintiff‟s attorney was set\nfor trial in two separate cases on the same day. Rather than pursue other procedural\nremedies, the attorney dismissed Thomas‟s action and re-filed it the same day, reasoning\nthat since the plaintiff filed the first action within three months of discovering the\nmalpractice, “the remaining nine months were tolled during the pendency of the first\ncomplaint and did not commence to run until he dismissed the first action.” (Thomas,\nsupra, 95 Cal.App.4th at p. 430.) The court concluded that equitable tolling did not apply\nbecause “Thomas did not have any alternate remedies. His claim was the single pursuit\nof a medical malpractice action. But even more obviously, Thomas did not act\nreasonably or with any semblance of good faith.” (Id. at p. 434.) Thomas‟s attorney did\nnot advise opposing counsel of the scheduling conflict or request a trial continuance from\nthe court. Instead, he “endeavored to solve the mismanagement of his calendar conflict\nwithout regard to the interests of [the] defendant or the court and contrary to conventional\nprocedures available to him.” (Id. at p. 435.)\n       This case is distinguishable from Wood and Thomas. First, unlike the plaintiffs in\nthose cases, Bain‟s wage claims could be brought in two alternate forums. Second,\nBain‟s claim was not dismissed for failing to serve summons or bring the case to trial\nwithin the statutory deadlines and there was no evidence Bain filed his second action to\nremedy calendar mismanagement or for any other improper purpose. Bain diligently\npursued his claim before the Labor Commissioner and obtained an award in that\n\n                                              27\n\fproceeding. The first lawsuit in the superior court was TRI‟s appeal of the Labor\nCommissioner‟s decision and Bain continued to pursue his claims throughout that appeal.\nThus, the trial court did not err when it found that the limitations period on Bain‟s\njudicial action to recover wages based on violations of Labor Code sections 201, 202,\n203, and 1194 was equitably tolled while Bain pursued his administrative claim before\nthe Labor Commissioner.\n       Finally, TRI argues that even if Bain‟s judicial action was timely, his claim for\nminimum wages under section 1194 was barred, since he did not make a claim under\nsection 1194 in the administrative proceeding. The record contains both Bain‟s “Initial\nReport or Claim” and the “Complaint” he filed with the Labor Commissioner. Both\ndocuments claim unpaid wages without specifying which Labor Code provisions wages\nwere sought under. Bain‟s claim that he was never paid any wages necessarily includes\nthe allegation that he was not paid even minimum wages. In addition, since the appeal of\nthe Labor Commissioner‟s decision was a trial de novo, the trial court had the discretion\nto permit Bain to raise additional related wage claims. (Murphy, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p.\n1115.) We do not have a complete record of the proceedings in the first action in the\nsuperior court (TRI‟s appeal of the Labor Commissioner‟s decision) and therefore do not\nknow whether Bain relied on section 1194 in that case. We conclude that TRI has not\nmet its burden of demonstrating that the section 1194 minimum wage claims were barred.\n\n       B. Presumption of Employment\n\n       TRI next argues that the judgment must be reversed because the court erroneously\nrelied on the presumption that every person who performs services for another is an\nemployee. TRI contends this is “a fundamentally incorrect statement of the law” and that\nin determining whether Bain was an employee or an independent contractor, the court\nshould have followed “the controlling case” of S. G. Borello, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1431698\"><a href=\"/opinion/1431698/sg-borello-sons-v-department-of-industrial-rel/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\frequires the court to consider all of the circumstances and analyze a number of factors,\nthe most important being whether the employer had the right to control the work.\n       Bain argues that even if the court erred in applying the presumption, the error was\nharmless. Bain asserts that TRI does not point to any substantial evidence that he was not\nan employee and argues that even if the presumption did not apply, the only conclusion\nfrom the uncontested facts is that he was an employee.\n       Indeed, the analysis in the court‟s statement of decision begins with the\npresumption that Bain was an employee. On this point, the court cited sections 3357 and\n3353. Section 3357 provides: “Any person rendering service for another, other than as\nan independent contractor, or unless expressly excluded herein, is presumed to be an\nemployee.” This section has been interpreted as creating a presumption that a service\nprovider is presumed to be an employee unless the principal proves otherwise. (Yellow\nCab Cooperative, Inc. v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals. Bd. (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2164453\"><a href=\"/opinion/2164453/yellow-cab-cooperative-v-workerscomp-app-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Section 3353 provides: “ „Independent contractor‟ means any person who\nrenders service for a specified recompense for a specified result, under the control of his\nprincipal as to the result of his work only and not as to the means by which such result is\naccomplished.” “Unless the context otherwise requires,” the definitions in sections 3351\nthrough 3371 apply to Division 4 of the Labor Code, which governs workers‟\ncompensation. (§ 3350.)\n       The trial court also cited Robinson v. George (1940) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1114865\"><a href=\"/opinion/1114865/robinson-v-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Robinson).\nRobinson was a personal injury action in which the plaintiff alleged that a negligent\ndriver (defendant George) was the corporate defendant‟s employee, making the corporate\ndefendant vicariously liable for injuries the plaintiff sustained in a motor vehicle\naccident. (Id. at p. 240.) The Supreme Court held “[t]he rule, . . . , is that the fact that\none is performing work and labor for another is prima facie evidence of employment and\nsuch person is presumed to be a servant in the absence of evidence to the contrary.” (Id.\nat p. 242.) The court also noted that this presumption may be rebutted by evidence that\n\n                                              29\n\fthe alleged employee was an independent contractor. (Ibid.)

The plaintiffs in Cristler alleged Labor Code violations, including failure to\npay overtime compensation (§§ 510, 515, 1194), failure to provide properly itemized\nwage statements (§ 226), and failure to compensate for business expenses (§ 2802), as\nwell as claims not based on the Labor Code. (Cristler, at pp. 75-76.) The appellate court\nin Cristler, like the trial court here, began its analysis with the definitions of “employee”\nand “independent contractor” in sections 3351, 3353, and 3357. (Id. at pp. 76-77.) Thus,\nCristler provides authority for applying the definitions in sections 3353 and 3357 to wage\nclaims. (Ibid.)\n       In setting forth its multi-factor test, the S. G. Borello court relied on the traditional\ncommon law test from the Restatement of Agency, the standards for contractor‟s\nlicensees in section 2750.5, and a test applied in other jurisdictions; it noted that many of\nthe factors in those tests overlapped. (S. G. Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d at pp. 351, 354-\n355.) The court stated that the most important factor is “the right to control the manner\nand means of accomplishing the result desired” and that the right to discharge at will,\nwithout cause, is “ „[s]trong evidence in support of an employment relationship.‟ ” (Id. at\np. 350.) Other factors “include (a) whether the one performing services is engaged in a\ndistinct occupation or business; (b) the kind of occupation, with reference to whether, in\nthe locality, the work is usually done under the direction of the principal or by a specialist\nwithout supervision; (c) the skill required in the particular occupation; (d) whether the\n\n                                              30\n\fprincipal or the workman supplies the instrumentalities, tools, and the place of work for\nthe person doing the work; (e) the length of time for which the services are to be\nperformed; (f) the method of payment, whether by the time or by the job; (g) whether or\nnot the work is a part of the regular business of the principal; and (h) whether or not the\nparties believe they are creating the relationship of employer-employee.” (Id. at p. 351.)\nThe trier of fact may also consider: (1) the opportunity for profit or loss; (2) the\ninvestment in equipment or materials required for the task, (3) the employment of\nhelpers; and (4) whether the service rendered is an integral part of the alleged employer‟s\nbusiness.” (Id. at pp. 354-355.) The “individual factors cannot be applied mechanically\nas separate tests; they are intertwined and their weight depends often on particular\ncombinations.‟ ” (Ibid.) “Each service arrangement must be evaluated on its facts, and\nthe dispositive circumstances may vary from case to case.” (Id. at p. 354.) S. G.\nBorello’s “caveats reflect that „[t]he determination of employee or independent-\ncontractor status is one of fact,” which we review under the substantial evidence\nstandard. (Cristler, supra, 171 Cal.App.4th at pp. 77-78.)\n       We are not persuaded that the court erred when it applied a presumption of\nemployment in this case. As we have noted, the Supreme Court has applied the\npresumption in a personal injury case based on the employer‟s vicarious liability.\n(Robinson, supra, 16 Cal.2d at p. 242.) Although the Supreme Court did not specifically\nspeak in terms of a presumption in S. G. Borello, its analysis relied on the “standards” in\nsection 2750.5, which contains a presumption of employment. (S. G. Borello, supra, 48\nCal.3d at p. 354.) And Cristler applied section 3357, which has been construed as a\npresumption of employment, to wage claims similar to those at issue here. (Cristler,\nsupra, 171 Cal.App.4th at pp. 75-76.)\n       But even if it was error for the court to begin its analysis with the presumption, it\nis evident from its factual findings that the court properly analyzed the evidence\naccording to the multi-factor test from S. G. Borello. The court found that TRI controlled\n\n                                             31\n\fBain‟s employment by requiring him to attend staff meetings, to record his hours on the\nsame time sheets as other employees, to perform the same administrative duties as other\nemployees; by deciding which projects Bain worked on and which hours he worked; and\nby having his work audited by its night auditor before it went out. TRI set the fee\nschedule and collected fees from the clients. TRI provided the supplies and equipment,\nexcept for some of Bain‟s furniture, which he had lent to the company. Bain did not have\nany outside clients for whom he performed tax preparation services; all of his services\nwere provided to TRI‟s clients, except for the volunteer work Bain did for LAMTA. TRI\nmarketed Bain and his skills to clients as an employee, not an independent contractor.\nBain was employed on an at-will basis. TRI employed Bain as a tax preparer, which was\nan integral part of TRI‟s business. Bain had not invested in any tax preparation business\nfrom which he could make a profit, he did not market or advertise his tax preparation\nservices, and he never used his own employees or subcontractors to do TRI‟s work. TRI\nalso reimbursed Bain for his client-related expenses and never required Bain to invoice\nTRI for his services.\n       As the trial court noted, that Bain and Conard treated Bain as an independent\ncontractor or that Conard listed Bain as a “consultant” on the profit and loss statement he\nprovided to TRI is not determinative. “The label placed by the parties on their\nrelationship is not dispositive, and subterfuge will not be countenanced.” (S. G. Borello,\nsupra, 48 Cal.3d at p. 349.) Moreover, there was evidence that Bain and Conard were\naware of this rule and intended to treat their relationship as one of employer and\nemployee starting in January 2005, the time that TRI took over the practice. The court\nfound that Bain always thought he was TRI‟s employee and that TRI‟s evidence that the\nparties had agreed Bain would be an independent contractor was not credible. In\naddition, that Conard did not withhold taxes and issued Bain a 1099 is not dispositive;\nsuch conduct is a consequence of their agreement to treat Bain as an independent\n\n\n\n                                            32\n\fcontractor and not a means of proving independent contractor status.

For these\nreasons, we reject TRI‟s contention that the court erred when it began its analysis with\nthe presumption that Bain was an employee and conclude, contrary to TRI‟s assertion,\nthat the court properly applied the multi-factor test from S. G. Borello.\n\n       C. Statutory Penalties\n\n              1. Parties’ Contentions\n\n       TRI argues that the court erred when it awarded Bain both the penalty for failing\nto pay minimum wages (§ 1194.2) and the penalty for failing to timely pay earned wages\nupon resignation (§ 203). TRI argues that there is no legal authority that supports\nimposing both penalties and that the Supreme Court rejected the trial court‟s “expansive”\ninterpretation of section 1194 in Kirby v. Immoos Fire Protection, Inc. (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1244</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Kirby). TRI also contends that if the section 1194.2 penalty applies, the\ncourt miscalculated the amount of the penalty. And TRI argues that the court should not\nhave imposed the section 203 penalty because there was a good faith dispute over\nwhether TRI owed Bain “wages.”\n       Bain argues that TRI waived its challenge to the amount of the section 1194.2\npenalty by failing to object to the statement of decision on that ground, that he is entitled\nto the full amount of his unpaid wages as the section 1194.2 penalty, and that the court\nproperly imposed the section 203 penalty.\n       Since we conclude that Bain‟s claim for the section 1194.2 penalty was barred by\nthe statute of limitations, we shall not address TRI‟s contention that the court erred when\n\n\n                                             33\n\fit imposed both the section 203 penalty and the section 1194.2 penalty or its contention\nthat the court erred in determining the amount of the section 1194.2 penalty. In light of\nour holding, we shall modify the judgment by striking the $7,700 awarded as liquidated\ndamages under section 1194.2, since that claim was time barred. We turn next to the\nquestion whether the court erred in imposing the section 203 penalty in this case.\n\n               2. Propriety of Imposing Section 203 Penalty\n\n       TRI contends the court should not have imposed the section 203 penalty because\nthere was a good faith dispute over whether TRI owed Bain “wages.” Bain contends the\ncourt properly imposed the section 203 penalty because TRI has never disputed that it\nowed Bain $7,700; instead the dispute has always been about how that payment should\nbe characterized. Bain argues that TRI‟s continued refusal to pay is “in bad faith and\noutrageous.”\n       Section 203 provides in relevant part: “If an employer willfully fails to pay,\nwithout abatement or reduction, in accordance with Sections 201, . . . , 202, and . . . , any\nwages of an employee who is discharged or who quits, the wages of the employee shall\ncontinue as a penalty . . . .” (Italics added.) The section 203 penalty is commonly known\nas a “waiting time” penalty. (FEI Enterprises, Inc. v.

When the employee in Barnhill was discharged, she owed her\nemployer a balance on a promissory note, which was intended to be repaid in installments\nby payroll deductions. [Citation.] The employer set off the balance due on the\npromissory note against the final wages paid to the employee, and the employee sued to\nrecover her full wages plus waiting time penalties under section 203. [Citation.] The\ntrial court awarded both wages and penalties, but [the appellate court] reversed the\npenalty award. Although ultimately determining the setoff was not permissible, [the\ncourt] noted that the state of the law was not clear at the time the employer withheld\nwages, and several California appellate decisions approved of such setoffs. [Citation.]\n„[G]iven that uncertainty,‟ [the court] reasoned, „[the employer] should not be penalized\nfor believing that setoff was proper and payment of wages not required.‟ [Citation.]\nAccordingly, the employer‟s nonpayment of wages was not willful for purposes of\nsection 203.” (Amaral, supra, 163 Cal.App.4th at p. 1201, citing Barnhill, supra, 125\nCal.App.3d at pp. 4-5, 8-9.)\n       Barnhill‟s holding was memorialized in California Code of Regulations, title 8,\nsection 13520, which states: “A willful failure to pay wages within the meaning of . . .\nSection 203 occurs when an employer intentionally fails to pay wages to an employee\nwhen those wages are due. However, a good faith dispute that any wages are due will\npreclude imposition of waiting time penalties under Section 203. [¶] (a) Good Faith\nDispute. A „good faith dispute‟ that any wages are due occurs when an employer presents\na defense, based in law or fact which, if successful, would preclude any recover[y] on the\npart of the employee. The fact that a defense is ultimately unsuccessful will not preclude\na finding that a good faith dispute did exist. Defenses presented which, under all the\ncircumstances, are unsupported by any evidence, are unreasonable, or are presented in\nbad faith, will preclude a finding of a „good faith dispute.‟ ” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8,\n\n                                             35\n\f§ 13520; Amaral, supra, 163 Cal.App.4th at p. 1201.) “This regulation imposes an\nobjective standard.” (FEI, supra, 194 Cal.App.4th at p. 802.) “The appearance of the\nlanguage „or are presented in bad faith‟ in the list of circumstances precluding a finding\nof a good faith dispute does not render the test a subjective one, but indicates that\nsubjective bad faith may be of evidentiary value in the objective bad faith analysis.” (Id.\nat p. 802, fn. 9.)\n       Nothing requires that a good faith dispute exist at the time the wages are due. The\nregulation defines a good faith dispute in part as a “defense.” “Precisely when the\nemployer formulated such a defense is, . . . beside the point. So long as no other\nevidence suggests the employer acted in bad faith, presentation of a good faith defense,\nbased in law or fact, will negate a finding of willfulness.” (Amaral, supra, 163\nCal.App.4th at p. 1204.)\n       A review of the case law aids our analysis. In Amaral, the trial court found that\nthe employer, Cintas (a uniform supplier), violated a city living wage ordinance (LWO)\nby failing to pay wages at the rate required by the LWO to employees who performed\nwork on the city‟s contracts outside the city. The trial court awarded unpaid wages but\nfound that the existence of a good faith defense precluded imposition of waiting time\npenalties. (Amaral, supra, 163 Cal.App.4th 1170-1171, 1173-1174.) The appellate court\naffirmed. The court explained, “the legal obligations imposed on employers by the LWO\nwere unclear at the time of Cintas‟s violations. As Cintas‟s vigorous defense . . . has\nmade clear, numerous arguments exist concerning the constitutionality of the LWO and\nits proper interpretation. Before the trial court rulings in this case, no court had\npreviously addressed the scope or the validity of the City‟s LWO. Living wage\nordinances such as the one at issue here are a relatively recent phenomenon. Indeed, until\nnow, . . . no California appellate decision has construed the requirements of any . . . living\nwage ordinance, or addressed the constitutional challenges . . . that Cintas has raised.\nAlthough we have rejected Cintas‟s legal arguments about the LWO, these defenses were\n\n                                              36\n\fnot unreasonable or frivolous. On the contrary, they raised complicated issues of first\nimpression” (Id. at p. 1202.) In addition, there was no evidence the employer knew it\nwas required to compensate its production workers at the rates prescribed in the LWO, or\nshowing the company acted in bad faith when it failed to pay such rates.” (Ibid.)\n       In contrast to Barnhill and Amaral, the courts in Armenta v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Road Sprinkler), rejected\nclaims that there was a good faith dispute that precluded imposing a section 203 penalty.\nThe employer in Armenta maintained wood utility poles for major utility companies; the\nemployees claimed unpaid wages for time they spent traveling to and from remote\njobsites in company trucks, attending crew meetings, maintaining the trucks, completing\npaperwork, and other tasks the employer referred to as “nonproductive time.” (Armenta,\nat pp. 316-319.) Although the Armenta court observed that California law was unsettled\nregarding the propriety of using “an average hourly wage to determine whether the\nminimum wage law was violated,” that court concluded that the presumption of good\nfaith that this legal uncertainty might have given the employer was outweighed by\nevidence that the employer was in fact aware that its employees were not being fully\ncompensated for their time. (Id. at pp. 325-326.) The court concluded that the trial\ncourt‟s findings that the employer‟s “supervisors created an environment in which the\nforemen were strongly discouraged from recording time spent . . . performing\nnonproductive tasks” and evidence that the workers “raised the issue to supervisors but\nwere told by supervisors and area managers that they would not be compensated for such\ntime” showed that the employer‟s “failure to pay for nonproductive time was intentional\nand willful” and supported imposition of the penalty. (Id. at p. 326.) Applying\nsubstantial evidence review, the appellate court upheld the trial court‟s finding of\nwillfulness. (Id. at pp. 325-327.)\n\n\n\n                                             37\n\f       The same substantial evidence analysis led to the affirmance of section 203\npenalties in Road Sprinkler. The court in Road Sprinkler distinguished Barnhill because\nthe employer‟s legal obligation was clear and substantial evidence supported the lower\ncourt‟s finding that the employer had acted in bad faith. (Road Sprinkler, supra, 102\nCal.App.4th at pp. 781-783.) Thus, any legal mistake the employer claimed to have made\nwas not reasonable and not made in good faith. (Id. at pp. 782-783.)\n       TRI argues that the court erred in imposing the waiting time penalty because at all\ntimes it had a good faith belief that Bain was not an employee. TRI relies on the\nfollowing facts: (1) Conard‟s profit and loss statement listed Bain as a “consultant” and\nshowed that that he was paid without deduction for taxes; (2) Griffin saw the 1099 form\nthat Conard gave Bain for 2004; (3) Griffin believed Bain was an independent contractor\nwhen he gave Bain the independent contractor agreement; and (4) Bain responded to that\ncontract by asking to be treated as an employee. As we have explained, it has long been\nthe rule that neither “[t]he label placed by the parties on their relationship” nor the failure\nto withhold taxes/use of a 1099 form is dispositive. (S. G. Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d at\np. 349; Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc, supra, 220 Cal.App.3d at p. 877.) In addition,\nthe trial court found that Griffin‟s testimony that the parties had agreed Bain would be an\nindependent contractor was not credible. That Bain asked to be treated as an employee\nwhen presented with the independent contractor agreement does not support the\nconclusion that he was an independent contractor before then.\n       TRI relies on the fact that it offered to pay Bain his compensation in February and\nMarch 2005. But those offers were contingent on Bain executing the independent\ncontractor agreement. The requirement that an employer pay earned wages upon\nresignation is unconditional; the employer may not condition the payment of such wages\nin the employee‟s execution of a release or other conduct by the employee. (Singh v.\nSouthland Stone, U.S.A., Inc. (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 362-365.) More importantly,\nalthough TRI offered to pay Bain in 2005, it never tendered a check. TRI admits that it\n\n                                              38\n\fhad the financial ability to pay Bain in February 2005. It argues that the only reason it\ndid not pay Bain at that time was a good faith belief that he was an independent\ncontractor, not an employee.\n       There is nothing novel about the rules governing the employee-independent\ncontractor analysis. The analysis in S. G. Borello has been around for two decades.\n(S. G. Borello, supra, 48 Cal.3d at pp. 351-355 [1989].) Thus, unlike Amaral and\nBarnhill, this case does not involve an area of the law that is unsettled. There was also\nevidence that upon completing some professional training, Bain and Conard realized that\nthey had misclassified Bain as an independent contractor. A reasonable inference from\nthis evidence is that Griffin, who was also a tax preparer, should have known that Bain\nwas an employee. And whether characterized as an employee or an independent\ncontractor, Bain was entitled to be paid for his work. TRI did not claim that Bain did not\ncomplete his work assignments or provide any other explanation for its refusal to pay\nBain for his services, regardless of the label used. The record and the law support the\ntrial court‟s conclusion that TRI intentionally withheld Bain‟s wages and that it did not\nhave a good faith belief that Bain was not an employee. For these reasons, we conclude\nthe court did not err in imposing the section 203 penalty.\n\n   II. Bain’s Cross-Appeal\n\n       Bain challenges the court‟s rulings that Griffin cannot be held personally liable for\nBain‟s wage claims under the Labor Code. As we have noted, the trial court rejected this\ncontention twice: (1) when it granted Griffin‟s motion for summary judgment; and (2)\nwhen it denied Bain‟s motion to amend his complaint at trial to add Griffin as a\ndefendant. We shall address each ruling separately.\n\n\n\n\n                                             39\n\f       A. Order Granting Griffin’s Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n       In an introductory portion of his brief, Bain states that he is appealing from both\nthe order denying his request to amend at trial and the order on Griffin‟s motion for\nsummary judgment. Although Bain‟s summary of the procedural history mentions\nGriffin‟s motion for summary judgment, the argument portion of his brief does not. Bain\ndoes not discuss the standard of review for a motion for summary judgment or any of the\nevidence or argument presented in Griffin‟s motion for summary judgment.\n       In addition, the record on appeal does not contain copies of Griffin‟s moving\npapers (his points and authorities, separate statement, and the evidence filed in support of\nhis summary judgment motion) or any of Bain‟s papers in opposition to the motion (his\npoints and authorities, separate statement, and evidence). The only documents in the\nrecord relating to Griffin‟s motion for summary judgment are Griffin‟s reply to the\nopposition and the court‟s order on the motion.\n       One of the most fundamental rules of appellate review is that an appealed\njudgment or order is presumed to be correct. “ „All intendments and presumptions are\nindulged to support it on matters as to which the record is silent, and error must be\naffirmatively shown.‟ ” (Denham v.

The appellant (Bain on\nthe cross-appeal) has the burden of overcoming the presumption of correctness. That\nburden includes providing this court with reasoned argument and citations to authority on\neach point raised. (Niko v.

We therefore conclude that Bain has forfeited any claim\nof error related to the order on Griffin‟s motion for summary judgment.\n\n       B. Order Denying Bain’s Motion to Amend at Trial\n\n       Citing Martinez, Bain argues that the court erred when it denied his motion to\namend because both Griffin and TRI were employers for the purposes of his claim for\nunpaid wages. Relying on the definition of “employer” in Industrial Welfare\nCommission (IWC) wage orders, Bain contends that Griffin was an employer because he\ncontrolled Bain‟s wages, hours, and working conditions, and that Griffin should therefore\nbe held jointly and severally liable with TRI for the judgment.\n       Bain relies on what is commonly referred to as IWC Wage Order No. 4-2001\n(hereafter Wage Order No. 4), which regulates wages, hours, and working conditions in\n“professional, technical, clerical, mechanical, and similar occupations.” (Cal. Code.\nRegs., tit. 8, § 11040, subd. (1); Brinker Restaurant Corp. v. Superior Court (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844210\"><a href=\"/opinion/844210/brinker-restaurant-corp-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1026.) Wage Order No. 4, like all of the industry and occupation wage\norders, defines “employer” as “any person as defined in Section 18 of the Labor Code,\nwho directly or indirectly, or through an agent or any other person, employs or exercises\ncontrol over the wages, hours, or working conditions of any person.” (Cal. Code. Regs.,\ntit. 8, § 11040, subd. (2)(H); Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 59.) Section 18 defines\n\n                                             41\n\f“person” as “any person, association, organization, partnership, business trust, limited\nliability company, or corporation.” Both Griffin and TRI (a corporation) are “persons”\nwho may be employers under Wage Order No. 4.\n       Our Supreme Court first construed the definition of “employer” used in the IWC\nwage orders in Reynolds, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2567023\"><a href=\"/opinion/2567023/reynolds-v-bement/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1075</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The plaintiff in Reynolds, a former\nemployee of an auto painting company, brought a class action suit to recover unpaid\novertime compensation against the company (a Delaware corporation) and its California\nsubsidiary (also a corporation), alleging violations of Labor Code sections 510 and 1154\nand the applicable wage order. (Id. at pp. 1081-1082.) The plaintiff subsequently added\neight individuals who were officers, directors, and shareholders of the corporations as\ndefendants. (Id. at p. 1083.) The individual defendants demurred, arguing that they were\nnot the plaintiff‟s employers. (Ibid.) Noting that neither section 510 nor section 1194\ndefined the term “ „employer,‟ ” the plaintiff argued that the IWC wage order definition\n(which includes individuals who exercise control over wages, hours, or working\nconditions) applied and that the IWC definition includes corporate control figures like the\nindividual defendants. (Id. at p. 1085.) The court disagreed, explaining that “the plain\nlanguage of [the wage order] defining employer does not expressly impose liability under\nsection 1194 on individual corporate agents. Nor can we infer that the Legislature,\nsimply by amending sections 510 and 1194 several times after the IWC adopted its\nemployer definition, impliedly intended to incorporate that definition into a unified\nremedial scheme comprised of those statutes and the regulations.” (Id. at p. 1086.) The\ncourt applied the common law test of employment and observed that “[u]nder the\ncommon law, corporate agents acting within the scope of their agency are not personally\nliable for the corporate employer‟s failure to pay its employees‟ wages.” (Id. at p. 1087.)\nThe court therefore concluded that the plaintiff could not state a section 1194 violation\nagainst the individual defendants. (Id. at pp. 1087-1088.) The court also held that while\ncorporate directors may be “jointly liable with the corporation and may be joined as\n\n                                            42\n\fdefendants if they personally directed or participated in [] tortious conduct,” the failure to\ncomply with wage laws is not tortious conduct. (Id. at pp. 1089-1090.) In addition, the\nplaintiff did not allege that the individual defendants misappropriated the alleged unpaid\nwages to themselves for their individual advantage. (Id. at p. 1090.)\n       Bain argues that the rule from Reynolds does not apply to Griffin since Reynolds\nwas “found only under common law.” He contends, instead, that he is entitled to rely on\nthe definition of “employer” in Wage Order No. 4, as construed in Martinez, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2630272\"><a href=\"/opinion/2630272/martinez-v-combs/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which was decided after Reynolds.\n       In Martinez, the Supreme Court revisited the question of who is an employer for\nthe purpose of an action for unpaid minimum wages (§ 1194). The plaintiffs in Martinez\nwere agricultural workers who sued their employer, a grower, for unpaid minimum\nwages. The named defendants included two produce merchants, through whom the\ngrower sold strawberries, and a field agent for one of the merchants. Based on the\ndefinition of “employer” in the applicable IWC wage order, the plaintiffs argued that the\nproduce merchants, the field agent, and the grower were joint employers and that the\nmerchants and the field agent were therefore liable for the unpaid wages. (Martinez,\nsupra, 49 Cal.4th at pp. 42-43, 48.) The grower had obtained a discharge in bankruptcy.\n(Id. at p. 42.)\n       The Martinez court observed that although section 1194 was enacted in 1913, the\ncourt had only addressed the question of how employment should be defined under\nsection 1194 once, in Reynolds, and that it had never reviewed the concept of joint\nemployment in the context of wage claims brought under state law. (Martinez, supra, 49\nCal.4th at p. 50.) The court stated that Reynolds “spoke too broadly in concluding that\nthe common law defines the employment relationship in actions under section 1194.”\n(Id. at p. 50, fn. 12.) After conducting an extensive examination of section 1194 and the\nIWC wage orders in their “full historical and statutory context,” the court concluded that\nthe wage orders define the employment relationship, and thus who may be held liable as\n\n                                             43\n\fan employer for unpaid wages. (Id. at pp. 52-63.) The court observed that “a worker\nwho sues under section 1194 for unpaid minimum wages actually sues to enforce the\napplicable wage order.” (Martinez, at p. 64.) The court stated, “While the common law\ndefinition of employment plays an important role in the wage orders‟ definition, and . . .\nin actions under section 1194, to apply only the common law definition while ignoring\nthe rest of the IWC‟s broad regulatory definition would substantially impair the\ncommission‟s authority and the effectiveness of its wage orders.” (Id. at p. 65.) The\ncourt held that under the wage orders, “to employ” has three alternative definitions. (Id.\nat pp. 64, 66.) “It means: (a) to exercise control over the wages, hours or working\nconditions, or (b) to suffer or permit to work, or (c) to engage, thereby creating a\ncommon law employment relationship.” (Id. at p. 64.) “This is not to say the common\nlaw plays no role in the IWC‟s definition of the employment relationship. In fact, the\nIWC‟s definition of employment incorporates the common law definition as one\nalternative.” (Ibid.) The court stated that the wage orders‟ definition of “employer,” “is\nbroad enough to reach through straw men and other sham arrangements to impose\nliability for wages on the actual employer.” (Id. at p. 71.) In addition, “one of the\nreasons the IWC defined „employer‟ in terms of exercising control was to reach situations\nin which multiple entities control different aspects of the employment relationship. This\noccurs, for example, when one entity (such as a temporary employment agency) hires and\npays a worker, and another entity supervises the work.” (Id. at p. 76.)\n       But Martinez did not overrule Reynolds, as Bain asserts. To the contrary, the court\nreaffirmed its holding in Reynolds, stating, “The opinion in Reynolds, . . . , properly holds\nthat the IWC‟s definition of „employer‟ does not impose liability on individual corporate\nagents acting within the scope of their agency. [Citation.] The opinion should not be\nread more broadly than that.” (Martinez, 49 Cal.4th at p. 66.) Examining the relationship\nbetween the parties, the Martinez court concluded that the produce merchants were not\njoint employers and were therefore not liable for the plaintiffs‟ unpaid wages. (Id. at\n\n                                             44\n\fp. 71-77.) Addressing the liability of the field agent, the court again reaffirmed Reynolds,\nstating “The claim fails under our holding in Reynolds, . . . , that the IWC‟s definition of\n„employer‟ does not impose liability on individual corporate agents acting within the\nscope of their agency.” (Martinez, at p. 75, citing Reynolds, at p. 1086.)\n       Bain argues that Griffin meets all three alternative definitions of employer from\nMartinez because he controlled Bain‟s hours, working conditions, and whether Bain was\npaid. However, Bain‟s contention ignores the court‟s holdings in Reynolds, which was\nreaffirmed in Martinez, that the wage orders‟ definition of “employer” does not impose\nliability on individual corporate agents acting within the scope of their agency.\n(Martinez, at p. 75.) In this case, there was no evidence that Griffin acted outside the\nscope of his agency as an officer and a shareholder of TRI. There is no allegation or\nevidence that Griffin misappropriated Bain‟s unpaid wages to himself for his individual\nadvantage. (Reynolds, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 1090.) This case is also factually\ndistinguishable from Martinez, because there was no evidence that supported the\nconclusion that Griffin was a joint employer with TRI.\n       Bain‟s reliance on Futrell v. Payday California, Inc. (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1419</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\nis misplaced. Applying the three-pronged definition from Martinez, the Futrell court\nheld that a payroll processing company that provided payroll services to a producer of\ntelevision commercials was not a joint employer for the purposes of the wage statutes.\nThe payroll company exercised no control over the production company‟s employees,\nincluding their hiring or firing, rate of pay, work hours, or conditions; it did not “suffer”\nor permit the employees to work; and did not engage them in work. (Id. at pp. 1430-\n1435.) Futrell cited Reynolds, stating, “The extension of personal liability to the agents\nof an employer is not reasonably derived from the language and purposes of the Labor\nCode wage statutes.” (Id. at p. 1432; accord Aleksick v. 7-Eleven, Inc. (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Moreover, Futrell is\n\n                                              45\n\fdistinguishable on its facts, since Griffin is an officer and shareholder of the corporate\nemployer, not a separate entity that provides services.\n       Following Reynolds and Martinez, we hold that Griffin was not an employer and\ncould not be held personally liable for failing to pay Bain‟s wages. We therefore\nconclude that the court did not err when it denied Bain‟s motion to amend at trial.\n\n                                       DISPOSITION\n\n              The trial court is directed to modify the judgment and strike the $7,700 in\nliquidated damages awarded as a penalty pursuant to section 1194.2.
