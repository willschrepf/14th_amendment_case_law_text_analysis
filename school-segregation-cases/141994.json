ECF No. 91.\n\n           Upon consideration of BOP’s Motion, the plaintiff’s Opposition [98] thereto, and the\n\nentire record in this case, 1 the Court will: (1) DENY WITHOUT PREJUDICE BOP’s Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment regarding Royer’s Privacy Act claims; (2) DENY BOP’s motion to dismiss\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction; (3) GRANT BOP’s motion to dismiss Royer’s First Amendment claims\n\n\n1\n    BOP did not file a Reply in support of its motion.\n\ffor failure to state a claim; and (4) DENY BOP’s motion to dismiss Royer’s Due Process claims.\n\nThe Court also DISMISSES Royer’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) claims because he\n\nstates that he will no longer press them. See Pl.’s Mem. Supp. of Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. Dismiss\n\nor for Summ. J. 23–24, ECF No. 98-1 [hereinafter Pl.’s Opp’n].\n\n       The Court does not decide the legality of BOP’s practice of classifying prisoners as\n\n“terrorist inmates” or whether Royer should or should not be deemed a “terrorist inmate.” A\n\nrelated case in this Court considers whether BOP violated the Administrative Procedure Act\n\n(“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq., by failing to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking before\n\nimplementing its “terrorist inmate” classification program. See Am. Compl., Royer v. Fed.\n\nBureau of Prisons, No. 10-cv-1196 (D.D.C. Sept. 9, 2011).\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n       A.      Offense Conduct and Conviction\n\n       Royer is a United States citizen born in Missouri. In 2004, he and ten other men were\n\ncharged in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia with numerous offenses\n\nincluding conspiracy to levy war against the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2384,\n\nconspiracy to provide military support to Al Qaeda, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339B, and\n\nconspiracy to contribute services to the Taliban in violation of 50 U.S.C. § 1705. Ultimately,\n\nRoyer pleaded guilty to two counts: Aiding and Abetting the Use and Discharge of a Firearm\n\nDuring and in Relation to a Crime of Violence (Felony) in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and\n\n924(c)(2), and Aiding and Abetting the Carrying of an Explosive During the Commission of a\n\nFelony in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 811(h)(2). According to Royer, the relevant felony\n\nwas violation of the Neutrality Act, which makes it a crime to “knowingly begin[] . . . or\n\nprovide[] or prepare[] a means for . . . any military or naval expedition . . . against the territory or\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fdominion of any foreign prince or state . . . with whom the United States is at peace.” 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 960. The specific acts supporting Royer’s convictions included his efforts in the summer of\n\n2000 and fall of 2001 to assist several co-conspirators in gaining access to training camps in\n\nPakistan run by Lashkar-e-Taiba 2 (“LET”), a group designated as a foreign terrorist organization\n\n(“FTO”) in December 2001.             While at those camps, his co-conspirators fired semi-automatic\n\npistols and carried a rocket-propelled grenade. Royer was sentenced on April 9, 2004 to two\n\nconsecutive ten-year terms with credit for time served.\n\n        Of relevance to this case, Royer converted to Islam in 1992 and shortly thereafter\n\ntraveled to Bosnia for six months to fight on behalf of the Bosnians in the 1992–1995 war in\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Compl. ¶ 15. While there, Royer trained and fought as part of the\n\n“Abu Zubair” unit against the Serbian army. Id. Although Abu Zubair was never designated a\n\nterrorist organization by the United States, BOP now suggests that it is or has been affiliated with\n\na terrorist organization. Def.’s Stmt. Mat. Facts ¶ 6, ECF No. 91 [hereinafter Def.’s SMF].\n\n        B.        Present Controversy\n\n        As of today, Royer has served approximately nine and a half years of his 20-year\n\nsentence. For the first three and a half years of his incarceration, Royer was housed in the\n\ngeneral prison population. Compl. ¶ 77. However, since December 2006, when Royer was\n\nclassified as a “terrorist inmate,” he has been housed in various locations isolated from the\n\ngeneral population, including the Special Housing Units (“SHUs”) at FCI Allenwood and USP\n\nLewisburg, the Communications Management Unit (“CMU”) at FCI Terre Haute; the SHU at\n\nFCI Greenville; the supermax facility at Florence, Colorado ADX; and currently the CMU at\n\nUSP Marion. Compl. ¶¶ 77, 88–91, 100; Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 1–2; ECF No. 14; ECF No. 104.\n2\n  Spelled in various documents as Laskar-e-Tabia or Lashkar-e Tayyib, LET is the military arm of a group founded\nto organize mujahideen in violent jihad against the Russians in Afghanistan. PSR ¶¶ 22, 42, 93. LET’s primary focus\nafter the Russians left Afghanistan was jihad against the Government of India to oust it from Kashmir. PSR ¶ 22, 93.\n\n                                                         3\n\f       While in the general population, Royer asserts that he had “run of the prison and access\n\nto its facilities.” Compl. ¶ 79. He could run outdoors on a track, enroll in vocational training\n\nand earn a carpentry license, take classes for college credit, and work in the prison factory for\n\npay. Id. He enjoyed up to forty hours of full contact visits per month with his family, Compl. ¶\n\n80, and appears to have had 300 minutes of telephone time per week, Compl. ¶ 96.\n\n       In December 2006, he asserts that BOP determined that certain restrictions would apply\n\nto his confinement for the remainder of his prison term (or about 16.5 years as of that date).\n\nAccording to Royer, the conditions imposed as a result of his “terrorist inmate” classification\n\nrequire that he be housed “in the harshest conditions of confinement in the federal prison\n\nsystem.” Compl. ¶ 106. Specifically, from December 2006 to October 2009, Royer was housed\n\nin the CMU at FCI Terre Haute. Compl. ¶ 91. There, although he was allowed out of his cell, he\n\nwas not permitted to leave the “tight quarters” of the housing unit and was not permitted to have\n\nany contact with the general inmate population. Compl. ¶ 93–94. Royer could only exercise in\n\n“steel cages” and was denied access to college credit courses, jobs, or vocational training.\n\nCompl. ¶ 95. Additionally, Royer had no access to the prison chapel, was permitted group\n\nreligious services only on Fridays, and was not permitted to study religious topics one-on-one\n\nwith other inmates in the CMU. Compl. ¶ 94. He was permitted only one 15-minute phone call\n\nper week, and only on business days between 8:30am and 2:30pm. Compl. ¶ 96. Finally, he was\n\nallowed only two visits per month and these were limited to two-hours each and were required to\n\nbe noncontact, meaning that he must speak with visitors through a telephone, separated by a\n\nconcrete and glass wall.    Compl. ¶ 97.    When Royer was transferred to the SHU at FCI\n\nGreenville after an altercation, the prison imposed the same conditions, even when those were\n\nharsher than those for other SHU inmates. Compl. ¶ 101. After the filing of this complaint,\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fRoyer was transferred to the supermax facility at ADX Florence in or around March 2012, ECF\n\nNo. 14, and then to the CMU at USP Marion in or around November 2012, ECF No. 104.\n\n        Based on his conditions of confinement and his allegation that BOP has relied on\n\ninaccurate information to determine his “terrorist inmate” status, Royer now lodges both\n\nstatutory and Constitutional claims against BOP under the federal Privacy Act, the Fifth\n\nAmendment Due Process clause and the First Amendment. 3\n\n        Royer seeks money damages and equitable relief for the alleged violations of the Privacy\n\nAct. With respect to the alleged constitutional violations, he seeks a declaration that BOP is\n\nviolating his rights to due process, freedom of speech, and freedom of association, and an order\n\nthat BOP lift the conditions and allow contact visits with his family. Finally, he seeks costs and\n\nexpenses. 4 Compl. 36.\n\n        This is the third dispositive motion filed by BOP in this litigation. Royer initially filed\n\nhis claim in the Eastern District of Virginia and, in lieu of an Answer, BOP filed a Motion to\n\nDismiss or for Summary Judgment. ECF No. 23. Specifically, BOP sought summary judgment\n\non the Privacy Act claims and moved to dismiss the constitutional claims for lack of subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. That motion was fully briefed; however, after\n\nrequesting additional briefing from the parties, the court sua sponte held that venue was\n\nimproper in the Eastern District of Virginia and transferred the case to this Court. ECF No. 60.\n\nBOP filed an Answer here, ECF No. 65, and subsequently filed a second Motion to Dismiss or,\n\n\n3\n As already mentioned, the Court now dismisses Royer’s FOIA claims. Certain additional claims have been\npreviously dismissed by the Court. See ECF Nos. 46, 54, 63.\n4\n Similar litigation challenging the constitutionality of these conditions of confinement and the BOP’s failure to\nengage in notice-and-comment rulemaking has been filed by other prisoners classified as terrorist inmates, including\nat least one case pending in this District. See Aref v. Holder, 774 F. Supp. 2d 147 (D.D.C. 2011) (holding that\nplaintiffs had plausibly alleged a procedural due process claim but dismissing the plaintiffs’ claim that defendants\nviolated their First Amendment right to “family integrity” and dismissing plaintiffs’ APA claims as moot because\nBOP had resumed the rulemaking process in 2010).\n\n                                                         5\n\fin the Alternative for Transfer to the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. ECF No.\n\n68. Rather than raising the defenses of lack of subject matter jurisdiction or failure to state a\n\nclaim—and despite the fact that BOP had previously acknowledged that venue was proper here,\n\nDef.’s Resp. to Court’s Order of Sept. 28, 2010, ECF No. 57—BOP argued that Royer’s claims\n\nshould be treated as a disguised habeas claim and that venue was proper in Colorado where he\n\nwas then incarcerated. The Court disagreed and denied without prejudice the Motion to Dismiss\n\nor in the Alternative for Transfer. Mem. & Order, Mar. 29, 2012, ECF No. 83.\n\n         BOP now again seeks summary judgment on Royer’s Privacy Act claims (Counts 1, 2, 4,\n\nand 6–8) and renews its arguments (omitted from the last dispositive motion) that Royer’s\n\nConstitutional claims (Counts 9–10) should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\n\nor failure to state a claim. 5\n\nII.      ANALYSIS\n\n         A.       Motion for Summary Judgment Regarding Privacy Act Claims\n\n                  1.       Legal Standard\n\n         Summary judgment should be granted when “the movant shows that there is no genuine\n\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(a) (emphasis added); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247\n\n(1986). A fact is material if it could affect the outcome of the case. Id. A dispute is genuine if\n\nthe “evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Id.\n\n\n5\n  Because the motion to dismiss was filed after BOP filed its answer, it is technically one for judgment on the\npleadings. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). However, the standards for awarding judgment under a Rule 12(b)(6) motion\nto dismiss and Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings are “virtually identical.” See Haynesworth v.\nMiller, 820 F.2d 1245, 1254 (D.C. Cir. 1987), abrogated on other grounds by Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.S. 250\n(2006); see also Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 1367 (noting that if the defenses of failure to\nstate a claim or lack of subject matter jurisdiction are raised in a Rule 12(c) motion, “presumably the district court\nwill apply the same standards . . . as it would have . . . under Rules 12(b)(1) [or] (6) . . . .”). Thus, the Court will\napply the standard for a motion to dismiss here.\n\n                                                           6\n\fThe “evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn\n\nin his favor.” Id. at 255. The non-movant, however, must establish more than “the existence of\n\na scintilla of evidence” in support of his position, id. at 252, and may not rely solely on\n\nallegations or conclusory statements. Greene v. Dalton, 164 F.3d 671, 675 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\n\n              2.      Privacy Act Generally\n\n       The Privacy Act requires federal agencies maintaining “systems of records” to allow\n\nindividuals to review and request copies of and amendments to records pertaining to them. 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552a(d). The Act also imposes requirements regarding the accuracy and source of\n\ninformation agencies maintain.\n\n       “Systems of records” under the Privacy Act are those under the control of the agency\n\nfrom which “information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying\n\nnumber, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.” Id. § 552a(a)(5). In\n\nresponse to requests for amendment, agencies must either allow an individual to make\n\ncorrections or inform the individual of the reason for the agency’s refusal to amend and\n\nprocedures for seeking review of the refusal. Id. § 551a(d)(2). Agencies must also, “to the\n\ngreatest extent practicable,” collect information “directly from the subject individual when the\n\ninformation may result in adverse determinations about an individual’s rights, benefits, and\n\nprivileges under Federal programs.” Id. § 551a(e)(2). Finally, agencies must “maintain all\n\nrecords which are used by the agency in making any determination about any individual with\n\nsuch accuracy . . . as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the\n\ndetermination.” Id. § 552a(e)(5).\n\n       Judicial review is available when an agency refuses to provide access, copies, or\n\namendments, or fails to maintain accurate records or otherwise comply with the law “in such a\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\fway as to have an adverse effect on an individual.” Id. § 552a(g)(1). Courts may enjoin the\n\nagency from withholding records and order production and amendment of records. Id. §§\n\n552a(g)(2)(A)–(B), 552a(g)(3)(A)–(B). They may assess reasonable attorney fees and costs\n\nagainst the United States. Id. Actual damages are available in suits for failure to maintain\n\naccurate records or failure to comply with other provisions of the law if the agency acted\n\nintentionally or willfully. Id. § 552a(g)(4)(A)–(B).\n\n       Causes of action under the Privacy Act may be brought in the District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Columbia within two years from the date on which the cause of action arises. Id.\n\n§ 552a(g)(5).\n\n       The head of an agency with the principal function of enforcing criminal laws, including\n\ncorrectional agencies, may exempt systems of records from Privacy Act provisions, including\n\nthose provisions related to access, copying, amendment, and maintenance of accuracy of records.\n\nId. § 552a(j).    Federal regulations currently exempt BOP’s Inmate Central Record System\n\n(ICRS) from certain Privacy Act provisions, specifically those related to access to and\n\namendment of records, id. § 552a(d), collection of information directly from individuals, id. §\n\n552a(e)(2), civil remedies, id. § 552(g), and accuracy, id. § 552a(e)(5). See 28 CFR § 16.97.\n\nInmates may instead contest the accuracy and content of records administratively. 28 CFR §§\n\n16.9, 16.45; Letter from Wanda M. Hunt, Chief, FOIA/PA Section, Federal Bureau of Prisons, to\n\nRandall Royer, Aug. 19, 2009, ECF No. 91-1 at 31.\n\n                 3.   Summary Judgment Is Premature\n\n       Royer alleges that BOP knowingly maintained inaccurate records about him, Compl.\n\n¶¶ 132–33 (describing Counts 1–2); that BOP has intentionally and willfully failed to elicit\n\ninformation directly from him, Compl. ¶ 135 (describing Count 4); that it refuses to amend the\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\finaccurate records, Compl. ¶¶ 137–40 (describing Counts 6–7); and that it refuses to provide him\n\nwith access to these records, Compl. ¶¶ 141–47 (describing Counts 8–9). Royer seeks money\n\ndamages and an order that BOP give him access to the relevant records and amend inaccurate\n\nrecords. Compl. 35–36.\n\n        Royer’s Privacy Act claims relate primarily to his assertion that BOP continues to\n\nerroneously characterize Abu Zubair, the Bosnian group with whom he fought in 1994, as a\n\nterrorist organization with ties to Al Qaeda.              Royer’s complaint initially alleged that BOP\n\nobtained this erroneous information from a draft version of his PSR. That draft stated that Royer\n\nhad trained and fought with “Abu Zubar,” PSR ¶ 42, and that “Abu Zubair (known more\n\nformally as Abu Zubair al Madani) was a member of Al Qaeda sent to Bosnia by Bin Laden to\n\nestablish camps for Al Qaeda.” Compl. ¶ 33; Draft PSR ¶ 42. At his sentencing hearing, Royer\n\nobjected to the latter statement and argued that it confused the Bosnian Abu Zubair military\n\ngroup with an individual Al Qaeda member with a similar name who had died several years\n\nbefore Royer’s affiliation with the group. Compl. ¶¶ 15–22; Mem. Op. 3, ECF No. 59. The\n\ngovernment acknowledged the error and the court ordered that the line be stricken from the final\n\nPSR. Id.\n\n        Royer does not contest the accuracy of his final PSR, which is contained in his “Central\n\nFile” in BOP’s Inmate Central Records System. Compl. ¶ 25. However, Royer asserts that BOP\n\nsomehow obtained access to the erroneous information that had been deleted from the draft\n\nPSR. 6 Whatever the source of the information, Royer argues that it remains inaccurate, that BOP\n\nused it to classify him as a terrorist inmate, Compl. ¶¶ 32–41, that BOP has maintained similar\n\ninaccurate records they obtained from “open source reporting,” id. ¶ 39, and that BOP has failed\n6\n  There is much back and forth in the record about whether BOP had the actual draft PSR. However, Royer does\nnot now assert that BOP has the actual document but that BOP somehow obtained the deleted material, perhaps from\nan Addendum to the draft PSR which included Royer’s objection to the statement.\n\n                                                       9\n\fto provide him access to the records, to collect information directly from him, or to respond to\n\nhis requests that the records by amended. Compl. ¶¶ 42–44, 54–76.\n\n       BOP argues that it is “not in possession of the draft PSR as alleged by Plaintiff, nor has\n\nthe Bureau ever had possession of the draft PSR . . . [or] used information from a draft PSR in\n\nthe classification of Plaintiff.” Def.’s SMF ¶ 4 (citing Schiavone Decl. ¶ 6). BOP does not\n\nexplain why, in a letter to Royer, it used language that mirrored the deleted draft PSR language\n\nverbatim. See Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. 11, ECF No. 98-2 at 23 (including a statement that mirrors the\n\ndraft PSR verbatim that “Abu Zubair (known more formally as Abu Zubair al Madani) was a\n\nmember of Al Qaeda sent to Bosnia by Bin Laden to establish camps for Al Qaeda”).\n\n       BOP states that the “[final] PSR includes self-admissions by the Plaintiff to training and\n\nfighting with a group in Bosnia known as ‘Abu Zubair, II’ a group also known as Abu Zubair al\n\nMadani, which according to publicly available information, is associated with Al Qaeda, and\n\nidentified as a FTO.” Def.’s SMF ¶ 6. BOP goes on to list some of the “publicly available\n\nrecords” used to research Abu Zubair.\n\n       There are several problems with BOP’s assertion. First, in the PSR, Royer only admitted\n\nto training with a group known as “Abu Zubar”; the remainder of BOP’s statement appears to be\n\nbased on its own research. See PSR ¶ 42, ECF No. 100. Second, it does not appear that Abu\n\nZubair is now or has ever been listed as an FTO by the United States. See Foreign Terrorist\n\nOrganizations,       U.S.       Dep’t        of        State       (Sept.       28,       2012),\n\nhttp://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm. Third, the public records listed by BOP in\n\nsupport have already been called into question by Judge Brinkema of the Eastern District of\n\nVirginia and BOP has not provided this Court with any explanation for why the records are of\n\nany value. Although Judge Brinkema transferred the case to this Court for lack of venue, her\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\fOpinion is worth quoting at length both because she was the sentencing judge in Royer’s original\n\ncase and because BOP made substantially the same arguments before her that it now makes\n\nbefore this court. Judge Brinkema noted:\n\n        Royer raises some very serious allegations in his Complaint. In fact, in light of\n        arguments advanced by BOP itself, it appears that BOP may in fact be\n        maintaining inaccurate information about Royer, in violation of this Court’s oral\n        order during Royer’s sentencing hearing that Paragraph 42 of his Pre-Sentence\n        Report be stricken as erroneous. Specifically, in its Motion to Dismiss or for\n        Summary Judgment, BOP continues to make reference to the fact that Royer\n        fought with a Bosnian military unit known as “Abu Zubair,” and improperly\n        confuses that group with a now deceased al Qaeda operative by that same name. .\n        . . [T]he BOP . . . allege[s] that the Abu Zubair group with which plaintiff trained\n        and fought in Bosnia “is associated with al Qaeda,” and that “publicly available\n        records” . . . confirm that fact. In particular BOP cites four web sites which it\n        claims contain publicly available records tying the Bosnian Abu Zubair group to\n        terrorism. . . . [T]he link to www.historycommons.org [is] broken and no longer\n        connect[s] to [a] valid web site[]. Other [links], such as the links to a copy of an\n        indictment returned by a grand jury in the Northern District of Illinois and a press\n        release issued by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in that same case, replicate the same\n        confusion between the group Al Zubair and the individual by the same name that\n        gave rise to Royer’s original objection to his draft PSR. Thus, whether the\n        information regarding Abu Zubair was derived from the Addendum to Royer’s\n        PSR or from open source reporting, BOP appears to be perpetuating the exact\n        same error that the government already admitted to making during Royer’s\n        sentencing hearing. The government’s demonstrated inability to learn from its\n        own mistakes - mistakes to which it stipulated in a public hearing before this\n        Court - is a matter of serious concern.\n\nRoyer v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, No. 10-cv-0146, 2010 WL 4827727, at *2–3 (E.D. Va.\n\nNov. 19, 2010).\n\n        For unknown reasons, the government continues to advance the same argument and put\n\nforth the same public sources (including a broken link) in support of its argument, despite having\n\npreviously acknowledged to a federal court that the information is inaccurate. 7                      If the\n\n\n\n7\n These sources continue to include, mysteriously, the home page of the Department of Justice, www.justice.gov.\nThe Court is unsure how citation to the Department’s homepage provides any support for the contention that Abu\nZubair is a terrorist organization with links to Al Qaeda. A search of the Department’s website produced no\nadditional information other than the indictment and press release already provided by the government.\n\n                                                     11\n\fgovernment has new, reliable information suggesting that the group Abu Zubair had ties to\n\nterrorist organizations, such as Al Qaeda, it should provide the Court with that information. 8\n\n        Despite the evidence that the government may be maintaining inaccurate information\n\nlinking Royer to Al Qaeda, the government argues that judicial review and the protections of the\n\nPrivacy Act are unavailable.\n\n        Specifically, BOP argues that the PSR, as a court document, is not within the purview of\n\nthe Privacy Act, “notwithstanding its use or retention by agencies such as BOP.” Def.’s Mem. 2.\n\nThis argument lacks merit. First, since BOP does not even acknowledge that it has the draft\n\nPSR, its potential status as a “court document” is irrelevant. Second, Royer does not assert that\n\nBOP has the actual draft PSR but that it somehow obtained the inaccurate information that had\n\noriginally been included in, and later stricken from, the draft document. The issue is not the\n\nsource of the information, but whether the information BOP continues to use and rely on is\n\ninaccurate.\n\n        BOP also argues that its ICRS system of records has been exempted from the civil\n\nremedy and damages provisions of the Privacy Act and that BOP has no duty to amend allegedly\n\ninaccurate records. Def.’s Mem. 15. BOP thus implicitly suggests that the records at issue are\n\nhoused in the ICRS, though it never states this explicitly. However, Royer does not dispute that\n\nthe ICRS is exempt from the Privacy Act. Pl.’s Opp’n 5. Rather, Royer argues that the records\n\nat issue here are “separate and distinct from the ICRS,” id. (quoting Compl. ¶ 36), and suggests\n\nthat they are part of the Counter Terrorism Unit’s (CTU) electronic database. He asserts that the\n\nCTU is a headquarters-level entity, that it “maintains all of the information it collects in a\n\n\n\n8\n Royer concedes that he previously had ties to LET, an organization later classified as an FTO. The Court does not\ndecide whether this link should qualify Royer as a “terrorist inmate.” However, if the Privacy Act applies, his\nassociation with LET is irrelevant. The issue is whether BOP erroneously links him to Al Qaeda.\n\n                                                       12\n\fdatabase of electronic records” maintained in Martinsburg, West Virginia and that its database is\n\na separate “system of records.” Id. at 7 (citing Tufte Decl. ¶ 11). 9\n\n        The Court need not and cannot resolve here whether the relevant records are housed in\n\nthe CTU database, whether that database constitutes a system of records, and whether that\n\nsystem is separate from the ICRS.              BOP makes no argument regarding whether the CTU\n\ndatabase is a system of records or is separate from ICRS. At this stage, the parties seem to\n\ndispute where the relevant information is housed and therefore whether it is exempt from Privacy\n\nAct provisions. Summary judgment is thus premature. The Court denies BOP’s motion without\n\nprejudice to refile.\n\n        B.       Motion to Dismiss Constitutional Claims for Lack of Subject Matter\n                 Jurisdiction\n\n        Because a lack of jurisdiction over Royer’s constitutional claims would require the Court\n\nto dismiss them, the Court first considers whether it has subject matter jurisdiction. Steel Co. v.\n\nCitizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83 (1998); Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678 (1946). The party\n\nasserting the existence of subject matter jurisdiction bears the burden of proof. Thomson v.\n\nGaskill, 315 U.S. 442 (1942); Walker v. Jones, 733 F.2d 923, 934 (D.C. Cir. 1984). Although in\n\ndeciding a motion to dismiss, all uncontroverted facts in the complaint are to be accepted as true,\n\nwhen determining subject matter jurisdiction, a court is not limited to considering the allegations\n\nof the complaint but has broad discretion to consider extra-pleading materials. Land v. Dollar,\n\n330 U.S. 731, 735 n.4 (1947); Coal. for Underground Expansion v. Mineta, 333 F.3d 193, 198\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2003).\n\n\n9\n  In support, he notes that when he requested all records located in the ICRS that referenced his name in connection\nwith Abu Zubair, the BOP Regional Counsel responded that “no records pertaining to your request, other than your\nPSR, could be located.” See Pl.’s Mem. 8 (citing Ex. 25–26). Based on this, he deduces that BOP records\nsuggesting that he was associated with Abu Zubair and that Abu Zubair was a terrorist organization must be located\nin a system of records other than the ICRS.\n\n                                                        13\n\f         Royer asserts that the Court has federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331,\n\nwhich provides for original jurisdiction over all civil actions “arising under the Constitution,\n\nlaws, or treaties of the U.S.” Compl. ¶ 5. Despite the fact that Royer’s claims clearly arise under\n\nthe constitution, BOP argues that they are precluded by sovereign immunity. 10\n\n         Sovereign immunity is a jurisdictional issue and thus may be raised in a 12(b)(1) motion\n\nto dismiss, a 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings, or later in litigation. Pursuant to the\n\ndoctrine, “[i]t is axiomatic that the United States may not be sued without its consent and that the\n\nexistence of consent is a prerequisite for jurisdiction.” United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206,\n\n212 (1983). A statutory waiver of federal sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed,\n\nsee, e.g., United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U.S. 30, 33–34, 37 (1992), and will not be\n\nimplied, Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996).\n\n         The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) waives the sovereign immunity of the United\n\nStates for non-monetary claims against federal agencies. 5 U.S.C. § 702. Specifically, Section\n\n702 provides that “[a]n action in a court of the United States seeking relief other than money\n\ndamages . . . shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the\n\nUnited States.” This section applies “except to the extent that (1) statutes preclude judicial\n\nreview; or (2) agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701. Section\n\n702 itself also includes a caveat that “[n]othing herein . . . confers authority to grant relief if any\n\nother statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.”\n\n\n10\n   BOP argues that Counts X and XI cannot be brought as “constitutional tort claims” under the rationale of Bivens\nv. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971) (holding that plaintiffs may sue\nfederal officials in their individual capacities for damages for Fourth Amendment violations, even without a\nstatutory cause of action like that provided under 42 U.S.C. § 1983). However, although Royer initially\ncharacterized his claims as Bivens claims, they are in fact for equitable, not monetary relief. It has been over a year\nsince Royer clarified that he did not intend to characterize these as Bivens claims and the Court granted his motion\nto strike those paragraphs of his complaint. Pl.’s Opp’n 41; Mot. to Strike Paragraphs 149 & 152, ECF No. 63\n(granted by Minute Order, Apr. 4, 2011). Thus, the Court need not address BOP’s Bivens arguments.\n\n                                                         14\n\f5 U.S.C. § 702; see also Fornaro v. James, 416 F.3d 63, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (quoting Transohio\n\nSavings Bank v. OTS, 967 F.2d 598, 607 (D.C. Cir. 1993)) (noting that Section 702 excludes\n\nfrom the APA waiver of sovereign immunity any claims “‘expressly or impliedly forbidden by\n\nanother statute’”). Although Section 702 is codified in the APA, it is not limited to suits under\n\nthe APA. Chamber of Commerce v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1329 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\n\n          Royer argues that Section 702 gives the Court authority to hear his constitutional claims.\n\nBOP disagrees, arguing that 18 U.S.C. § 3625 precludes judicial review of decisions regarding\n\nthe imprisonment of a convicted person and designation of the place of imprisonment under 18\n\nU.S.C § 3621. Def.’s Mem. 18 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3625).\n\n          To resolve this dispute, the Court starts from the “strong presumption” that agency action\n\nis reviewable. See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971);\n\nAbbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140 (1967). Pre-APA cases emphasized that “judicial\n\nreview of a final agency action by an aggrieved person will not be cut off unless there is\n\npersuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of Congress.” Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at\n\n140. This was “reinforced by the enactment of the [APA], which embodies” a similar basic\n\npresumption.      Id.   The Supreme Court has held that “only upon a showing of ‘clear and\n\nconvincing evidence’ of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial\n\nreview.” Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 141 (quoting Rusk v. Cort, 369 U.S. 367, 379–80 (1962)).\n\nSuch clear and convincing evidence may include “specific [statutory] language or specific\n\nlegislative history that is a reliable indicator of congressional intent,” Block v. Cmty. Nutrition\n\nInst., 467 U.S. 340, 349 (1984), as well as “the nature of the administrative action involved.” Id.\n\nat 345.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\f       BOP argues that 18 U.S.C. § 3625 provides a statutory exception to the APA waiver of\n\nsovereign immunity. Section 3625 provides that the APA sovereign immunity waiver “do[es]\n\nnot apply to the making of any determination, decision, or order” under 18 U.S.C. §§ 3621–\n\n3626. BOP argues that it made its determination regarding Royer’s conditions of confinement\n\npursuant to 18 USC § 3621, which provides that BOP “shall designate the place of the prisoner’s\n\nimprisonment.” Thus, BOP argues, review of Royer’s constitutional claims is precluded. Def.’s\n\nMem. 18.\n\n       There are several problems with BOP’s argument. As an initial matter, it is not entirely\n\nclear that BOP’s categorization of plaintiff as a “terrorist inmate” was made pursuant to 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3621.    First, this section requires BOP to designate the “place” of an inmate’s\n\nimprisonment, not the conditions of confinement within any given facility. Moreover, Royer\n\nargues, and BOP elsewhere admits, that the decision to classify him as a “terrorist inmate” was\n\nmade at least in part pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4081 (“Classification and treatment of prisoners”).\n\nSee Def.’s Mem. 21–22. The provision negating the APA waiver of sovereign immunity applies\n\nonly to decisions made under 18 U.S.C §§ 3621–3626, and thus, by its terms, not to decisions\n\nmade under § 4081. Perhaps BOP’s decision was made pursuant to both of these statutory\n\nprovisions and perhaps judicial review of a decision made pursuant to both provisions could be\n\nprecluded. The Court need not resolve this question because BOP’s argument fails for other\n\nreasons.\n\n       Even assuming that BOP’s decision was made under 18 U.S.C. § 3621, the Court is not\n\nreviewing the merits of BOP’s decision as to where Royer is housed, but the constitutionality of\n\nthe conditions of confinement it places on him regardless of where he is housed. Colorable\n\nconstitutional claims are precluded from judicial review only where this has been made explicit\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\fby Congress. Here, Congress has precluded review of BOP “determination[s], decision[s], or\n\norder[s]” as to a prisoner’s place of imprisonment.                   However, Congress has not explicitly\n\nprecluded review of constitutional claims based on these or similar decisions.\n\n         The Supreme Court decided a similar issue in Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592 (1988).\n\nThere, the Court held that § 102(c) of the National Security Act precluded judicial review of the\n\nDirector’s employment termination decisions. Webster, 486 U.S. at 601. However, the Court\n\nheld that the National Security Act did not preclude judicial review of constitutional challenges\n\nbased on those same termination decisions. Id. at 603–04 (“[The APA] remove[s] from judicial\n\nreview only those determinations specifically identified by Congress or ‘committed to agency\n\ndiscretion by law.’         Nothing in § 102(c) persuades us that Congress meant to preclude\n\nconsideration of colorable constitutional claims arising out of the actions of the Director pursuant\n\nto that section . . . .”). The Court noted:\n\n         We emphasized in Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361 (1974), that where Congress\n         intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims its intent to do so must\n         be clear. . . . We require this heightened showing in part to avoid the “serious\n         constitutional question” that would arise if a federal statute were construed to\n         deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim.\n\nId. at 603 (internal citations omitted). Thus, although 18 U.S.C. § 3625 may preclude judicial\n\nreview of prison officials’ decisions regarding where a particular prisoner is housed, it does not\n\npreclude review of constitutional challenges arising out of those decisions. 11\n\n\n11\n   Royer argues that sovereign immunity does not bar his claims even in the absence of a § 702 waiver. Specifically,\nhe argues that where Congress has not clearly precluded judicial review of constitutional claims, there is a presumed\nright of equitable relief for constitutional violations. As Justice Harlan noted in his concurring opinion in Bivens,\nthere is a “presumed availability of federal equitable relief” to enforce the Constitution. 403 U.S. at 400 (Harlan, J.,\nconcurring). Similarly, the D.C. Circuit noted in Schnapper v. Foley that “[w]e may also doubt whether, even in the\nabsence of section 702, the Larson case would prevent a court from awarding equitable relief on the basis of\nappellants’ constitutional claims. The Larson Court was at some pains to note that injunctive relief against the\nsovereign could be obtained when the United States or an officer was found to have violated the Constitution . . . .”\n667 F.2d 102, 108 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (emphasis added). Finally, our Circuit has noted that “[t]he court’s power to\nenjoin unconstitutional acts by the government . . . is inherent in the Constitution itself.” Hubbard v. U.S. EPA\nAdm’r, 809 F.2d 1, 11 n.15 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (citing Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803)).\nThis Court need not decide the question because it finds that it has subject matter jurisdiction based on the § 702\n\n                                                          17\n\f         C.       Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim\n\n         BOP moves to dismiss both of Royer’s constitutional claims, arguing that he has failed to\n\nstate a claim. 12 While, procedurally, the standard for the plaintiff’s pleading requirements at the\n\nmotion to dismiss stage are the same for either the Procedural Due Process or First Amendment\n\nclaims, the substantive standards for what must be pled differ, as discussed in more detail below.\n\n         The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule require “a short and plain statement of the\n\nclaim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Rule 8 does not\n\nrequire “‘detailed factual allegations,’” but requires more than “‘labels and conclusions’” or\n\n“‘naked assertion[s].’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v.\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). The complaint must “contain sufficient factual matter,\n\naccepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,’” meaning it must “plead[]\n\nfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable\n\nfor the misconduct alleged.”            Id. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556).                 Factual allegations,\n\nalthough assumed to be true, must still “be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative\n\nlevel.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. The Court need not accept legal conclusions cast as factual\n\nallegations. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.\n\n         With respect to pro se plaintiffs, a complaint is “‘to be liberally construed’ and ‘a pro se\n\ncomplaint, however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal\n\n\nwaiver of sovereign immunity. However, even assuming the Court were wrong on its jurisdictional holding, the\nplaintiff could re-file his complaint to take advantage of the officer suit fiction. Our Circuit has recently reaffirmed\nthe availability of officer suits for allegedly unconstitutional federal actions. See Pollack v. Hogan, 2012 WL\n6216433, *2 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 14, 2012) (“[U]under the so-called Larson–Dugan exception to the general rule [of\nsovereign immunity] . . . ‘suits for specific relief against officers of the sovereign’ allegedly acting . . .\n‘unconstitutionally’ are not barred by sovereign immunity.”).\n12\n  Both BOP and Royer have introduced materials beyond the pleadings. Thus the motion could be treated as a\nmotion for summary judgment and the merits reached. However, to convert a motion to dismiss to a motion for\nsummary judgment the parties should be given a reasonable opportunity to present all material relevant to the\nmotion. The Court will not convert the motion and will only consider the extra-pleading materials with respect to\nthe summary judgment motion and not the motion to dismiss.\n\n                                                          18\n\fpleadings drafted by lawyers.’” Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (quoting Estelle v.\n\nGamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976)); cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(f) (“All pleadings shall be so construed\n\nas to do substantial justice”).\n\n        “[F]ederal courts must take cognizance of the valid constitutional claims of prison\n\ninmates. Prison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the\n\nConstitution.” Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84 (1987) (citing Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S.\n\n396, 405 (1974)). However, courts should also realize that they are “ill equipped to deal with the\n\nincreasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform.” Procunier, 416 U.S. at 405.\n\nAs the Supreme Court noted in Procunier, “the problems of prisons in America are complex . . .\n\nand not readily susceptible of resolution by decree.” Id. at 404–05. “Prison administration is,\n\nmoreover, a task that has been committed to the responsibility of [the legislative and executive]\n\nbranches, and separation of powers concerns counsel a policy of judicial restraint.” Turner, 482\n\nU.S. at 84–85.\n\n        Given the competing considerations at play in prisoners’ rights cases, the Supreme Court\n\nin Turner formulated a test to evaluate the constitutional claims of prisoners that is intended to be\n\n“responsive both to the ‘policy of judicial restraint regarding prisoner complaints and [to] the\n\nneed to protect constitutional rights.’” 482 U.S. at 85. There, the Supreme Court held that four\n\nfactors are relevant to whether a prison regulation affecting a constitutional right surviving\n\nincarceration withstands constitutional challenge:\n\n        whether the regulation has a ‘valid, rational connection’ to a legitimate\n        governmental interest; whether alternative means are open to inmates to exercise\n        the asserted right; what impact an accommodation of the right would have on\n        guards and inmates and prison resources; and whether there are ‘ready\n        alternatives’ to the regulation.\n\nOverton v. Bazetta, 539 U.S. 126, 132 (2003) (quoting Turner, 482 U.S. at 89–91)).\n\n                 1.     Royer Has Failed to State a First Amendment Claim\n                                                 19\n\f       Royer invokes the First Amendment to challenge restrictions on his contacts and\n\ncommunications with his family. Royer argues that his freedom of speech and association have\n\nbeen infringed, though his claim seems ultimately to be a freedom of association claim.\n\n       Specifically, Royer points out that, in contrast to the forty hours of full contact visits per\n\nmonth enjoyed by general population inmates, Compl. ¶ 80, BOP has limited him to two, two-\n\nhour noncontact visits per month.      If his family visits, he must talk with them through a\n\ntelephone, separated by a wall of concrete, glass, and bars. Compl. ¶ 107. Royer also notes that\n\nwhile inmates in the general population enjoy 300 minutes of telephone time per week, he has\n\nbeen limited to one 15-minute call per week and may only place it on business days between\n\n8:30am and 2:30pm. As a result, he has been effectively precluded from speaking with his\n\nschool-age children for months at a time. Compl. ¶ 96. Finally, Royer points to the “total,\n\npermanent” nature of the ban on physical contact with his family as evidence of the lack of a\n\nrational relationship between BOP’s goals and its policy.\n\n       According to Royer’s complaint, BOP has imposed these limitations because they need to\n\nmonitor his communications. However, Royer argues that the limits do not bear a rational\n\nrelation to a legitimate government interest, or that the limits are an exaggerated response to any\n\nsuch interest. Compl. ¶ 151. BOP responds that inmates do “not retain rights inconsistent with\n\nproper incarceration,” Def.’s Mem. 22, and that “freedom of association is among the rights least\n\ncompatible with incarceration,” id. at 23. Again, BOP argues that prison administrators must be\n\nable to exercise their judgment as to the appropriate means of furthering penological goals. Id.\n\n       The Supreme Court has acknowledged that “the Constitution protects ‘certain kinds of\n\nhighly personal relationships.’” Overton, 539 U.S. at 131 (quoting Roberts v. United States\n\nJaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 618 (1984)). “[O]utside the prison context, there is some discussion in\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\f[Supreme Court] cases of a right to maintain certain familial relationships, including association\n\namong members of an immediate family and association between grandchildren and\n\ngrandparents.” Id. (citing Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494 (1977) (plurality opinion);\n\nMeyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923)).\n\n       However, the Court has also stated that “freedom of association is among the rights least\n\ncompatible with incarceration . . . . Some curtailment of that freedom must be expected in the\n\nprison context.” Overton, 539 U.S. at 131 (citing Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor\n\nUnion, Inc., 433 U.S. 119, 125–26 (1977); Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460 (1983)). In Jones, the\n\nCourt stated:\n\n       First Amendment associational rights . . . must give way to the reasonable\n       considerations of penal management. . . . [N]umerous associational rights are\n       necessarily curtailed by the realities of confinement. They may be curtailed\n       whenever the institution’s officials, in the exercise of their informed discretion,\n       reasonably conclude that such associations, whether through group meetings or\n       otherwise, possess the likelihood of disruption to prison order or stability, or\n       otherwise interfere with the legitimate penological objectives of the prison\n       environment.\n\n433 U.S. at 132.\n\n       In fact, the Supreme Court, applying the Turner reasonableness test, appears to have\n\nalready upheld regulations substantially similar to those Royer challenges. In Overton, the Court\n\nreversed a Sixth Circuit decision which had invalidated Michigan prison regulations pertaining to\n\nnoncontact visits. 539 U.S. at 131, 137. In addition to limiting the highest security risk inmates\n\nto noncontact visits, the regulations limited the number of total visitors an inmate could receive\n\nand restricted child visitors. Id. at 129–30. The regulations also provided that an inmate who\n\nhad committed multiple substance abuse violations while in jail could not receive any visitors\n\nother than attorneys or clergy members for a minimum of two years. Id. at 130. Although the\n\nCourt did not discuss at length the impact that a prohibition on physical contact has on inmates\n\n\n                                               21\n\fand their families, the Court found that the regulations met the Turner standard in that the\n\nregulation had a valid, rational connection to a legitimate government interest, alternative means\n\nwere available to inmates to exercise the asserted right, accommodating the right would cause a\n\nsignificant reallocation of resources and would impair the prison’s ability to protect all\n\nindividuals inside the prison walls, and no ready alternatives undermined the reasonableness of\n\nthe regulations. Id. at 132–36.\n\n        Although Overton thus appears directly on point, the Court now applies the Turner\n\nfactors to determine whether the federal practice challenged here is reasonable.\n\n        Applying the first Turner factor, there certainly appears to be a valid, rational connection\n\nbetween the rules applied to so-called “terrorist inmates” and a legitimate government interest. 13\n\nThe Supreme Court in Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576 (1984), noted many of the security\n\nchallenges posed by contact visits:\n\n        Contact visits invite a host of security problems. They open the institution to the\n        introduction of drugs, weapons, and other contraband. Visitors can easily conceal\n        guns, knives, drugs, or other contraband in countless ways and pass them to an\n        inmate unnoticed by even the most vigilant observers. And these items can readily\n        be slipped from the clothing of an innocent child, or transferred by other visitors\n        permitted close contact with inmates.\n\nId. at 586.\n\n        Here, Royer concedes that at least one basis for BOP’s practice is the interest in\n\nmonitoring his communications. Compl. ¶ 109. In his Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, he\n\nconcedes that “monitoring inmates’ communication is, in the abstract, a legitimate penological\n\n\n13\n  The Court assumes, for the sake of this First Amendment analysis, the legality of the government’s “terrorist\ninmate” classification scheme and the accuracy of Royer’s classification. Royer separately challenges the\ngovernment’s failure to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking prior to implementing this scheme. Royer also\nseparately challenges, as discussed in more detail below, whether the scheme complies with procedural due process\nrequirements. The question before the Court with respect to Royer’s First Amendment challenge is whether,\nassuming the legality of the BOP’s classification of him as a “terrorist inmate,” the resulting conditions of his\nconfinement violate his First Amendment rights.\n\n                                                       22\n\fgoal” though he contests the legitimacy of monitoring him to a greater extent than other inmates.\n\nPl.’s Opp’n 56. In his complaint, he also quotes BOP regulations which state that control units\n\nsuch as the CMUs are “intended to place into a separate unit those inmates who are unable to\n\nfunction in a less restrictive environment without being a threat to others or to the orderly\n\noperation of the institution.” Additionally, although he notes that the majority of the inmates\n\nsubject to the same conditions are Muslims (40 of the 60 current or former CMU Terre Haute\n\ninmates according to his complaint), he does not assert that BOP has implemented these\n\nregulations in bad faith or for the purpose of discriminating against a particular religious group.\n\nSee Compl. ¶ 92. Thus, there appear to be at least two legitimate government interests at stake:\n\nthe need to monitor inmate communications and the need to isolate inmates that might pose a\n\nthreat to others or to the orderly operation of the institution.\n\n        Royer argues BOP has failed to put forward the “legitimate government interest” it seeks\n\nto further and that thus, it would be inappropriate to evaluate this factor or to decide the larger\n\nquestion on a motion to dismiss. Indeed, Royer is correct that BOP’s only justification for its\n\npractice appears to be that “prison administrators must be able to reasonably exercise their\n\njudgment as to the appropriate means of furthering penological goals.”          Nevertheless, the\n\nSupreme Court has said that the “burden . . . is not on the [government] to prove the validity of\n\nprison regulations but on the prisoner to disprove it.” Overton, 539 U.S. at 132 (citing Jones,\n\n433 U.S. at 128). This is particularly the case at the pleading stage where Royer must present\n\nfacts that plausibly state a claim. Given the state of the caselaw regarding prisoners’ first\n\namendment and visitation rights, Royer has not plausibly alleged here that there is no legitimate\n\ngovernment interest at stake, and in fact, has conceded that there is at least one legitimate\n\ngovernment interest. Thus, the Court now turns to the remainder of the Turner factors.\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\f        The second Turner factor considers “whether alternative means are open to inmates to\n\nexercise the asserted right.” Here, Royer acknowledges that, although he is prohibited from\n\nhaving contact visits with his family, he still retains the right to have noncontact visits, to make\n\nphone calls during business hours, and to write letters. Nevertheless, he argues that “there is no\n\nsubstitute for physical contact with loved ones” and that his wife would not have divorced him if\n\nBOP had not prohibited contact visits. Compl. ¶¶ 80, 117. He also asserts that phone calls are\n\nnot a viable alternative for speaking with his children because the calls are limited to business\n\nhours when the children are typically in school. Thus, he states, the “‘alternatives’ are so\n\nrestrictive . . . that they are rendered inadequate.” Pl.’s Opp’n 61.\n\n        However, although the Court must accept the facts asserted as true, it need not accept\n\nRoyer’s legal conclusions as to what constitutes “alternative means”. The Supreme Court has\n\nidentified alternative means of associating to include sending letters, making phone calls, and\n\neven sending messages through others who are allowed to visit. Overton, 539 U.S. at 135.\n\n“Alternatives to visitation need not be ideal . . . they need only be available.” Id. Thus, Royer\n\nhas failed to plausibly allege that no alternatives exist.\n\n        The third Turner consideration is the impact that accommodation of the asserted right\n\nwould have on guards, other inmates, and prison resources. On this point, Royer merely asserts\n\nthat there would be no “ripple effect” from accommodating his demands and that such\n\naccommodation would by “eas[y] and simpl[e].” Pl.’s Opp’n 62. However, Royer provides no\n\nfacts to support this assertion. The Court assumes that prison officials, in order to effectively\n\nmonitor Royer’s communications during these visits, would need to institute more stringent\n\nsearch procedures of Royer and his visitors prior to each visit and would need to have more staff\n\non hand to monitor the interactions between Royer and his visitors.\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\f        Finally, the Court considers whether there are “ready alternatives” which undermine the\n\nreasonableness of the regulations. On this point, Royer argues that BOP could meet its goal of\n\nmonitoring his visits at “no extra cost or risk to other inmates,” Pl.’s Opp’n 63, because BOP has\n\nalready “installed multiple cameras and hypersensitive microphones . . . [a]nd its officers\n\nthoroughly and expertly strip search all inmates both before and after contact visits.” Compl. ¶\n\n111. However, the Supreme Court has emphasized that the inquiry regarding this factor is not\n\nwhether prisons have imposed the least restrictive regulation but “whether the prisoner has\n\npointed to some obvious regulatory alternative that fully accommodates the asserted right while\n\nnot imposing more than a de minimis cost to the valid penological goal.” Overton, 539 U.S. at\n\n136. Increasing the number of inmates who must be strip searched before and after each contact\n\nvisit would surely increase the cost of visitation and divert attention from other priorities.\n\nMoreover, although Royer asserts that BOP has cameras and “hypersensitive” microphones, it is\n\nnot self-evident that this would obviate all security concerns that might arise from contact visits,\n\nsuch as the covert passing of notes, hand signals, or whispered conversations. As a result, Royer\n\nhas not sufficiently pled this factor either.\n\n        In summary, the Court has little trouble concluding that the restrictions on contact visits\n\nand phone calls survive Royer’s First Amendment freedom of association challenge. A more\n\ndifficult question is whether the alleged permanence of the restrictions raises additional\n\nconcerns. For example, in Overton, although the Court upheld a two-year ban on visitation from\n\nanyone other than clergy members and attorneys, the Court noted that it might reach a different\n\nconclusion regarding a “de facto permanent ban on all visitation for certain inmates.” 539 U.S.\n\nat 134; see also Beard v. Banks, 548 U.S. 521, 535 (2006) (“[A]s in Overton, we agree that ‘the\n\nrestriction [denying newspapers, magazines, and photographs to specially dangerous and\n\n\n\n                                                25\n\frecalcitrant inmates] is severe,’ and ‘if faced with evidence that [it were] a de facto permanent\n\nban . . . we might reach a different conclusion in a challenge to a particular application of the\n\nregulation.’”).\n\n        However, even though Royer’s complaint alleges that the restrictions applicable to him\n\nare to last for the duration of his incarceration, they do not involve a complete ban on visitation\n\nor communication, but rather a ban on contact visits and a limit on the number of visit and phone\n\ncalls and time of day. Moreover, the Court in Overton upheld regulations that appeared to\n\nimpose an indefinite ban on contact visits for inmates classified as the highest security risks. Id.\n\nat 130. Finally, other courts have stated that “there is no inherent, absolute constitutional right to\n\ncontact visits with prisoners,” Bazzetta v. McGinnis, 124 F.3d 774, 779 (6th Cir. 1997),\n\nsupplemented 133 F.3d 382 (6th Cir. 1998), and our Circuit has even upheld a permanent ban on\n\nall visitation between an incarcerated man and his wife, Robinson v. Palmer, 841 F.2d 1151,\n\n1156 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (holding that permanent ban on visitation between spouses after wife was\n\ncaught attempting to smuggle marijuana into prison reasonably furthered legitimate government\n\nobjective). 14\n\n        Thus, the Court finds that the restrictions on Royer’s communication and interaction with\n\nhis family, despite appearing to be indefinite, satisfy the requirements of the First Amendment\n\nand the test the Supreme Court has set forth for inmates’ constitutional challenges.\n\n                  2.      Procedural Due Process Claim\n\n        The Fifth Amendment provides that no person shall be “deprived of life, liberty or\n\nproperty, without due process of law.” U.S. Const. amend. V. “The touchstone of due process is\n\n14\n  Bans on contact visits have also been upheld under the Due Process clauses. In Block v. Rutherford, the Supreme\nCourt upheld, under the Fourteenth Amendment, a ban on noncontact visits for pre-trial detainees. 468 U.S. 576,\n588 (1984) (concluding the ban was a reasonable, nonpunitive response to legitimate security concerns). In Aref v.\nHolder, Judge Urbina of this court dismissed Substantive Due Process claims by other “terrorist inmates” that the\nsame restrictions at issue here violated their First Amendment right to “family integrity.” 774 F. Supp. at 162–63.\n\n                                                        26\n\fprotection of the individual against arbitrary action of government.” Wolff v. McDonnell, 418\n\nU.S. 539, 558 (1974) (citing Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U.S. 114, 123 (1889)).\n\n         The due process clause has both substantive and procedural aspects and only procedural\n\ndue process appears to be at issue here. 15 “Procedural due process imposes constraints on\n\ngovernmental decisions which deprive individuals of ‘liberty’ or ‘property’ interests within the\n\nmeaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment.” Mathews v.\n\nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976). “The fundamental requirement of due process is the\n\nopportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.” Mathews, 424 U.S.\n\nat 333 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, to state a procedural due process claim, a\n\nplaintiff must plead that a life, liberty, or property interest was at stake, that government action\n\nresulted in a deprivation or infringement of that interest, and that the plaintiff did not receive the\n\nprocess he was due.\n\n         As with other prisoners’ rights cases, unique concerns arise in the context of prisoners’\n\ndue process claims because a prisoner has already been deprived of much of his liberty through\n\nthe process of criminal conviction and incarceration.                  However, prisoners are “not wholly\n\nstripped of constitutional protections” upon conviction and retain Due Process protections\n\nagainst arbitrary deprivations of liberty. Hatch v. Dist. of Columbia, 184 F.3d 846, 849 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1999) (citing Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555 (1974)).\n\n15\n  The Supreme Court’s substantive due process cases interpret the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments’ guarantee of\ndue process to forbid the government from infringing “certain ‘fundamental’ liberty interests at all, no matter what\nprocess is provided, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.” Reno v.\nFlores, 507 U.S. 292, 301–02 (1993) (citations omitted). The Supreme Court has considered some substantive due\nprocess claims to prison regulations. See, e.g., Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990) (holding that treatment\nof prisoner against his will with antipsychotic drugs did not violate substantive due process if the prisoner was\ndangerous to himself or others and treatment was in his interest). In so doing, the Court utilized the Turner test to\nevaluate the constitutionality of the regulations at issue. See also Aref v. Holder, 774 F. Supp. 2d 147, 162–63\n(D.D.C. 2011) (applying Turner test to determine whether the plaintiffs’ had sufficiently alleged their substantive\ndue process claim). However, the appropriate test for procedural due process challenges is not the Turner test, but\nthe more typical procedural due process inquiry of whether the government has deprived plaintiff of a liberty interest\nwithout adequate process. See Harper, 494 U.S. at 228; see also Aref, 774 F. Supp. 2d at 163–67.\n\n                                                         27\n\f                       a.      Royer Has Sufficiently Alleged a Liberty Interest\n\n       Some liberty interests flow from the Due Process Clause itself. See Washington v.\n\nHarper, 494 U.S. 210, 221–22 (1990) (recognizing that a prisoner has a “significant liberty\n\ninterest in avoiding unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs under the Due Process\n\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment”). Other liberty interests may be created by state or\n\nfederal laws or practices regulating the terms or conditions of a prisoner’s confinement. See\n\nSandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 483–84; Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at 221. Royer asserts that his\n\nliberty interest flows from the latter source. Compl. ¶¶ 2, 86–87, 148.\n\n       In Sandin v. Conner, the Supreme Court considered whether an inmate’s placement in\n\ndisciplinary segregation for 30 days implicated a state-created liberty interest. 515 U.S. 472.\n\nThe Court held that it did not, finding that the conditions substantially mirrored those in similar,\n\ndiscretionary confinement such as administrative segregation. Id. at 486–87. In summarizing its\n\nholding, the Court noted that state-created liberty interests “will be generally limited to freedom\n\nfrom restraint which, while not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give\n\nrise to protection by the Due Process Clause of its own force, nonetheless imposes atypical and\n\nsignificant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id. at 484.\n\n       However, the Supreme Court has not yet defined what constitutes the “ordinary incidents\n\nof prison life” or, in other words, against what baseline courts should evaluate conditions of\n\nconfinement to determine whether they are atypical and significant. See Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at\n\n223 (describing the lack of agreement among the Courts of Appeals on the issue as well).\n\nNevertheless, the D.C. Circuit has considered the question and this Court relies on its analysis.\n\n       In Hatch v. Dist. of Columbia, the D.C. Circuit considered whether placement of an\n\ninmate in disciplinary and administrative segregation for seven months implicated Due Process.\n\n\n\n                                                 28\n\f184 F.3d 846. During these seven months, the plaintiff was “[c]onfined to his cell for twenty-\n\nthree and a half hours per day on weekdays and all forty-eight hours on weekend[s],” “had no\n\noutdoor recreation,” and “was not allowed to work or visit the library, gym, health clinic,\n\npsychological services, mailroom, clothing and bedding exchange, or culinary unit.” Id. at 848.\n\nHe was denied access to legal phone calls for ninety days. Id. The circuit court reversed the\n\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment for the government and remanded for further fact-\n\nfinding. The court concluded that the “ordinary incidents of prison life” should be evaluated in\n\nrelation to the “most restrictive confinement conditions that prison officials, exercising their\n\nadministrative authority to ensure institutional safety and good order, routinely impose on\n\ninmates serving similar sentences.” Id. at 856. The analysis requires a “factual determination of\n\nthe most restrictive conditions prison officials ‘ordinarily’ or ‘routinely’ impose” on prisoners\n\nserving similar sentences. 16 Id. at 857 (emphasis added). 17\n\n          In Hatch, the Circuit concluded that administrative segregation was an “ordinary\n\nincident” of life at the prison and should thus be included as part of the baseline for determining\n\nwhether the segregative confinement implicated a constitutionally protected liberty interest. Id.\n\nat 856.\n\n          However, the court noted, in addition to considering the nature of the deprivation in\n\nrelation to this baseline, that courts must also consider the length of the deprivation and whether\n\nthe segregation was within the range of what would be expected in light of the length of the\n\nsentence the prisoner is serving. Id. Because the possibility of transfer to another prison is one\n\n\n16\n  The Circuit did not explicitly define what constitutes a “similar sentences” but did emphasize the need for courts\nto consider the length of the sentence.\n17\n  While Sandin and Hatch dealt with Fourteenth Amendment Due Process claims and state prisons, there appears\nno reason why the analysis should not apply to Fifth Amendment Due Process claims and federal prisons. Indeed,\nother circuits have applied Sandin to due process claims against federal officials. See, e.g., Magluta v. Samples, 375\nF.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2004); Jordan v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 191 Fed. Appx. 639 (10th Cir. 2006) (unpublished).\n\n                                                         29\n\fof the ordinary incidents of prison life, the baseline need not be limited to conditions at the\n\nparticular prison in which the inmate is confined. However, neither need it be so broad as to\n\nconsider conditions in any prison nationwide, including those “especially restrictive” prisons\n\nwhere “all inmates are locked down almost the entire day.” Id. at 856–57.\n\n        BOP disputes Royer’s argument that his classification imposes an “atypical and\n\nsignificant hardship” and that it is outside what a prisoner may “reasonably expect to encounter\n\nas a result of his or her conviction in accordance with due process.” Def.’s Mem. 19.\n\n        Royer suggests that the required fact-specific inquiry is not possible or appropriate at the\n\nmotion to dismiss stage. Pl.’s Opp’n 36. The Court agrees that at this stage, it need not\n\ndetermine whether Royer’s conditions of confinement actually are harsh and atypical in\n\ncomparison with administrative segregation and other conditions ordinarily and routinely\n\nimposed. Rather, the Court need only determine whether the complaint contains sufficient\n\nfactual matter, accepted as true, to plausibly state a claim that the conditions are harsh and\n\natypical and thus implicate a liberty interest.       “Determining whether a complaint states a\n\nplausible claim for relief will . . . be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to\n\ndraw on its judicial experience and common sense.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679; see also Marion v.\n\nColumbia Correction Inst., 559 F.3d 693, 699 (7th Cir. 2009) (reversing the dismissal of a\n\nprisoner’s due process claim because, without a factual record, the court could not determine\n\nwhether the actual conditions of the plaintiff’s confinement resulted in the implication of a\n\nliberty interest).\n\n        The Court holds that Royer has plausibly alleged harsh and atypical conditions. First, as\n\ndetailed above, Royer’s complaint alleges that he has been segregated from the general\n\npopulation for over six years and that during this time he has been subject to restrictions on the\n\n\n\n                                                 30\n\frecreational, religious, and educational opportunities normally available to prison inmates.\n\nRoyer’s contacts with his family have been limited to one 15-minute phone call per week during\n\nbusiness hours, when his school-age children are in school. Finally, he is limited to two, two-\n\nhour noncontact visits per month. It is true that Royer’s complaint does not specifically outline\n\nthe “most restrictive confinement conditions that prison officials, exercising their administrative\n\nauthority to ensure institutional safety and good order, routinely impose on inmates serving\n\nsimilar sentences.” However, Royer did note that while in the SHU at FCI Greenville, he was\n\n“isolated to a greater extent than is typical for the SHU,” that he was not allowed to exercise in\n\nthe recreation cages at the same time as other SHU inmates, that staff placed sandbags in front of\n\nhis cell door, and that unlike other SHU inmates, he was not permitted to have contact visits.\n\nCompl. ¶ 101. He also asserted that BOP had permanently imposed upon designated “terrorist\n\ninmates” the “harshest conditions of confinement in the federal prison system.” Compl. ¶ 106.\n\n        Even assuming that the conditions alleged by Royer are no more restrictive than the most\n\nrestrictive conditions normally imposed, for example in administrative segregation, Royer’s\n\ncomplaint plausibly alleges that they are “harsh and atypical” because of their duration. In\n\nnumerous parts of his complaint, he alleges that the conditions are permanent and are intended to\n\nremain in place for the duration of his 20-year sentence, or for a total of about 16.5 years. See\n\nWilkinson, 545 U.S. at 224 (noting that conditions in a supermax facility “likely would apply to\n\nmost solitary confinement” but that unlike solitary confinement generally, placement in a\n\nsupermax facility is indefinite, and relying on this in part to find that conditions were “harsh and\n\natypical”). 18\n\n\n\n18\n  Judge Urbina also found that the conditions to which “terrorist inmates” are subject plausibly could “constitute an\natypical and significant hardship” although he appears to have used conditions in the general population as the\nbaseline for comparison. See Aref, 774 F. Supp. 2d at 165–66.\n\n                                                        31\n\f       BOP launches several additional arguments in support of its motion to dismiss that the\n\nCourt does not find persuasive. First, it argues that the Attorney General has discretion to\n\n“designate the institution of an inmate’s confinement.” Def.’s Mem. 19. While this is true, see\n\nMeachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 225 (1976) (confinement in another State is “within the normal\n\nlimits or range of custody which the conviction has authorized the State to impose”); Olim v.\n\nWakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 247 (1983) (“[I]t is neither unreasonable nor unusual for an inmate to\n\nserve practically his entire sentence in a State other than the one in which he was convicted and\n\nsentenced . . . .”), Royer does not challenge the location of his confinement. Instead he argues\n\nthat the “the atypical conditions of confinement are applied to [him] regardless of” where he is\n\nconfined.   Compl. ¶ 86.      Next, BOP argues that its regulations concerning classification,\n\ndesignation, and transfer do not limit its discretion so as to create a legitimate expectation that a\n\nprisoner will be assigned to a particular facility. Def.’s Mem. 20. However, this is no longer the\n\nappropriate inquiry for determining whether a prisoner has liberty interest. The Supreme Court\n\nin Sandin “abandon[ed] the approach” to prisoner due process claims of “search[ing] for a\n\nnegative implication from mandatory language in prisoner regulations.” 515 U.S. at 483 & n.5.\n\nInstead the Court adopted the “atypical and significant hardship” test discussed above.\n\n       Thus, the Court believes that Royer has stated a plausible claim that his classification as a\n\n“terrorist inmate” and the associated, indefinite conditions of confinement, are harsh and atypical\n\nand thus implicate a liberty interest.\n\n                       b.      Royer Has Sufficiently Alleged Denial of Process Due\n\n       Due process requirements are “flexible and call[] for such procedural protections as the\n\nparticular situation demands . . . .” Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at 224 (internal quotation marks\n\n\n\n\n                                                 32\n\fomitted). Thus, in determining what process is due, courts rely not on rigid rules, but on the\n\nframework articulated in Mathews v. Eldridge. Under Mathews, courts consider three factors:\n\n       First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the\n       risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and\n       the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and\n       finally, the Government’s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal\n       and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural\n       requirement would entail.\n\n424 U.S. at 335.\n\n       The first Mathews factor, the private interest at stake, is to be evaluated “within the\n\ncontext of the prison system and its attendant curtailment of liberties.” Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at\n\n225. “[T]he procedural protections to which [prisoners] are entitled are more limited than in\n\ncases where the right at stake is the right to be free from confinement at all.” Id. The second\n\nfactor looks to the risk of erroneous deprivation through the procedures used and the value of any\n\nadditional safeguards. The Supreme Court has stated that notice of the factual basis for the\n\ngovernment’s decision and a “fair opportunity for rebuttal” are “among the most important\n\nprocedural mechanisms for purposes of avoiding erroneous deprivations.” Id. at 226. The third\n\nfactor, the government’s interest and burden of additional procedures, is a “dominant\n\nconsideration” in the context of prison management. Id. at 227. The government must ensure\n\nthe safety of guards and other prison personnel, other inmates, and the public. It must be able to\n\nprevent prison violence.    In the case of inmates who purportedly have links to terrorist\n\norganizations, the danger to the public is all the greater. Finally, the simple issue of time and\n\nmoney and the resources necessary to put in place additional procedures are relevant.\n\n       Hewitt v. Helms specifies the minimum procedures for placing an inmate in segregative\n\nconditions if he has a liberty interest in avoiding such segregation. See Hatch, 184 F.3d at 852\n\n(describing Hewitt’s minimum procedures). Those procedures include “some notice of the\n\n\n                                                33\n\fcharges against him and an opportunity to present his views to the prison official charged with\n\ndeciding whether to transfer him to administrative segregation.”         Hewitt 459 U.S. at 476.\n\n“Although a hearing need not occur prior to confinement in administrative segregation, it ‘must\n\noccur within a reasonable time following an inmate’s transfer.’” Hatch, 184 F.3d at 852 (quoting\n\nHewitt, 459 U.S. at 476 n.8.\n\n       The Court need not linger over the balance of these factors and the exact process required\n\nbecause the complaint plausibly alleges that any process provided by BOP was inadequate.\n\nRoyer alleges that he was taken from his cell “without warning” and only provided with an\n\n“Administrative Detention Order” stating that he was being moved to the SHU because he was\n\n“pending classification.” Compl. ¶ 88. Royer was apparently told at some point (or learned) that\n\nhe had been classified as a “terrorist inmate,” Compl. ¶¶ 81, 101, though it is unclear when or\n\nhow this occurred. Royer states that he was never provided with a hearing, with notice of the\n\ncriteria for release from the conditions, or with notice of the projected date for release from those\n\nconditions. Compl. ¶ 105.\n\n       Given these allegations, it is unclear that the prison ever directly provided him with\n\nnotice of the reasons for his segregation and it appears that he has had no opportunity for a\n\nhearing. Thus, his complaint plausibly alleges that he was denied due process.\n\nI.     CONCLUSION\n\n       In summary, the Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE BOP’s Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment regarding Royer’s Privacy Act claims. The Court finds that it has subject matter\n\njurisdiction to consider Royer’s constitutional claims and thus DENIES BOP’s motion to dismiss\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction. With respect to those constitutional claims, the Court GRANTS BOP’s\n\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fmotion to dismiss the First Amendment claim for failure to state a claim and DENIES BOP’s\n\nmotion to dismiss Royer’s Due Process claims.\n\n       Signed by Royce C.

ECF No. 91.\n\n           Upon consideration of BOP’s Motion, the plaintiff’s Opposition [98] thereto, and the\n\nentire record in this case, 1 the Court will: (1) DENY WITHOUT PREJUDICE BOP’s Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment regarding Royer’s Privacy Act claims; (2) DENY BOP’s motion to dismiss\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction; (3) GRANT BOP’s motion to dismiss Royer’s First Amendment claims\n\n\n1\n    BOP did not file a Reply in support of its motion.\n\ffor failure to state a claim; and (4) DENY BOP’s motion to dismiss Royer’s Due Process claims.\n\nThe Court also DISMISSES Royer’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) claims because he\n\nstates that he will no longer press them. See Pl.’s Mem. Supp. of Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. Dismiss\n\nor for Summ. J. 23–24, ECF No. 98-1 [hereinafter Pl.’s Opp’n].\n\n       The Court does not decide the legality of BOP’s practice of classifying prisoners as\n\n“terrorist inmates” or whether Royer should or should not be deemed a “terrorist inmate.” A\n\nrelated case in this Court considers whether BOP violated the Administrative Procedure Act\n\n(“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq., by failing to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking before\n\nimplementing its “terrorist inmate” classification program. See Am. Compl., Royer v. Fed.\n\nBureau of Prisons, No. 10-cv-1196 (D.D.C. Sept. 9, 2011).\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n       A.      Offense Conduct and Conviction\n\n       Royer is a United States citizen born in Missouri. In 2004, he and ten other men were\n\ncharged in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia with numerous offenses\n\nincluding conspiracy to levy war against the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2384,\n\nconspiracy to provide military support to Al Qaeda, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339B, and\n\nconspiracy to contribute services to the Taliban in violation of 50 U.S.C. § 1705. Ultimately,\n\nRoyer pleaded guilty to two counts: Aiding and Abetting the Use and Discharge of a Firearm\n\nDuring and in Relation to a Crime of Violence (Felony) in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and\n\n924(c)(2), and Aiding and Abetting the Carrying of an Explosive During the Commission of a\n\nFelony in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 811(h)(2). According to Royer, the relevant felony\n\nwas violation of the Neutrality Act, which makes it a crime to “knowingly begin[] . . . or\n\nprovide[] or prepare[] a means for . . . any military or naval expedition . . . against the territory or\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fdominion of any foreign prince or state . . . with whom the United States is at peace.” 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 960. The specific acts supporting Royer’s convictions included his efforts in the summer of\n\n2000 and fall of 2001 to assist several co-conspirators in gaining access to training camps in\n\nPakistan run by Lashkar-e-Taiba 2 (“LET”), a group designated as a foreign terrorist organization\n\n(“FTO”) in December 2001.             While at those camps, his co-conspirators fired semi-automatic\n\npistols and carried a rocket-propelled grenade. Royer was sentenced on April 9, 2004 to two\n\nconsecutive ten-year terms with credit for time served.\n\n        Of relevance to this case, Royer converted to Islam in 1992 and shortly thereafter\n\ntraveled to Bosnia for six months to fight on behalf of the Bosnians in the 1992–1995 war in\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Compl. ¶ 15. While there, Royer trained and fought as part of the\n\n“Abu Zubair” unit against the Serbian army. Id. Although Abu Zubair was never designated a\n\nterrorist organization by the United States, BOP now suggests that it is or has been affiliated with\n\na terrorist organization. Def.’s Stmt. Mat. Facts ¶ 6, ECF No. 91 [hereinafter Def.’s SMF].\n\n        B.        Present Controversy\n\n        As of today, Royer has served approximately nine and a half years of his 20-year\n\nsentence. For the first three and a half years of his incarceration, Royer was housed in the\n\ngeneral prison population. Compl. ¶ 77. However, since December 2006, when Royer was\n\nclassified as a “terrorist inmate,” he has been housed in various locations isolated from the\n\ngeneral population, including the Special Housing Units (“SHUs”) at FCI Allenwood and USP\n\nLewisburg, the Communications Management Unit (“CMU”) at FCI Terre Haute; the SHU at\n\nFCI Greenville; the supermax facility at Florence, Colorado ADX; and currently the CMU at\n\nUSP Marion. Compl. ¶¶ 77, 88–91, 100; Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 1–2; ECF No. 14; ECF No. 104.\n2\n  Spelled in various documents as Laskar-e-Tabia or Lashkar-e Tayyib, LET is the military arm of a group founded\nto organize mujahideen in violent jihad against the Russians in Afghanistan. PSR ¶¶ 22, 42, 93. LET’s primary focus\nafter the Russians left Afghanistan was jihad against the Government of India to oust it from Kashmir. PSR ¶ 22, 93.\n\n                                                         3\n\f       While in the general population, Royer asserts that he had “run of the prison and access\n\nto its facilities.” Compl. ¶ 79. He could run outdoors on a track, enroll in vocational training\n\nand earn a carpentry license, take classes for college credit, and work in the prison factory for\n\npay. Id. He enjoyed up to forty hours of full contact visits per month with his family, Compl. ¶\n\n80, and appears to have had 300 minutes of telephone time per week, Compl. ¶ 96.\n\n       In December 2006, he asserts that BOP determined that certain restrictions would apply\n\nto his confinement for the remainder of his prison term (or about 16.5 years as of that date).\n\nAccording to Royer, the conditions imposed as a result of his “terrorist inmate” classification\n\nrequire that he be housed “in the harshest conditions of confinement in the federal prison\n\nsystem.” Compl. ¶ 106. Specifically, from December 2006 to October 2009, Royer was housed\n\nin the CMU at FCI Terre Haute. Compl. ¶ 91. There, although he was allowed out of his cell, he\n\nwas not permitted to leave the “tight quarters” of the housing unit and was not permitted to have\n\nany contact with the general inmate population. Compl. ¶ 93–94. Royer could only exercise in\n\n“steel cages” and was denied access to college credit courses, jobs, or vocational training.\n\nCompl. ¶ 95. Additionally, Royer had no access to the prison chapel, was permitted group\n\nreligious services only on Fridays, and was not permitted to study religious topics one-on-one\n\nwith other inmates in the CMU. Compl. ¶ 94. He was permitted only one 15-minute phone call\n\nper week, and only on business days between 8:30am and 2:30pm. Compl. ¶ 96. Finally, he was\n\nallowed only two visits per month and these were limited to two-hours each and were required to\n\nbe noncontact, meaning that he must speak with visitors through a telephone, separated by a\n\nconcrete and glass wall.    Compl. ¶ 97.    When Royer was transferred to the SHU at FCI\n\nGreenville after an altercation, the prison imposed the same conditions, even when those were\n\nharsher than those for other SHU inmates. Compl. ¶ 101. After the filing of this complaint,\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fRoyer was transferred to the supermax facility at ADX Florence in or around March 2012, ECF\n\nNo. 14, and then to the CMU at USP Marion in or around November 2012, ECF No. 104.\n\n        Based on his conditions of confinement and his allegation that BOP has relied on\n\ninaccurate information to determine his “terrorist inmate” status, Royer now lodges both\n\nstatutory and Constitutional claims against BOP under the federal Privacy Act, the Fifth\n\nAmendment Due Process clause and the First Amendment. 3\n\n        Royer seeks money damages and equitable relief for the alleged violations of the Privacy\n\nAct. With respect to the alleged constitutional violations, he seeks a declaration that BOP is\n\nviolating his rights to due process, freedom of speech, and freedom of association, and an order\n\nthat BOP lift the conditions and allow contact visits with his family. Finally, he seeks costs and\n\nexpenses. 4 Compl. 36.\n\n        This is the third dispositive motion filed by BOP in this litigation. Royer initially filed\n\nhis claim in the Eastern District of Virginia and, in lieu of an Answer, BOP filed a Motion to\n\nDismiss or for Summary Judgment. ECF No. 23. Specifically, BOP sought summary judgment\n\non the Privacy Act claims and moved to dismiss the constitutional claims for lack of subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. That motion was fully briefed; however, after\n\nrequesting additional briefing from the parties, the court sua sponte held that venue was\n\nimproper in the Eastern District of Virginia and transferred the case to this Court. ECF No. 60.\n\nBOP filed an Answer here, ECF No. 65, and subsequently filed a second Motion to Dismiss or,\n\n\n3\n As already mentioned, the Court now dismisses Royer’s FOIA claims. Certain additional claims have been\npreviously dismissed by the Court. See ECF Nos. 46, 54, 63.\n4\n Similar litigation challenging the constitutionality of these conditions of confinement and the BOP’s failure to\nengage in notice-and-comment rulemaking has been filed by other prisoners classified as terrorist inmates, including\nat least one case pending in this District. See Aref v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2476204\"><a href=\"/opinion/2476204/aref-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

ECF No.\n\n68. Rather than raising the defenses of lack of subject matter jurisdiction or failure to state a\n\nclaim—and despite the fact that BOP had previously acknowledged that venue was proper here,\n\nDef.’s Resp. to Court’s Order of Sept. 28, 2010, ECF No. 57—BOP argued that Royer’s claims\n\nshould be treated as a disguised habeas claim and that venue was proper in Colorado where he\n\nwas then incarcerated. The Court disagreed and denied without prejudice the Motion to Dismiss\n\nor in the Alternative for Transfer. Mem. & Order, Mar. 29, 2012, ECF No. 83.\n\n         BOP now again seeks summary judgment on Royer’s Privacy Act claims (Counts 1, 2, 4,\n\nand 6–8) and renews its arguments (omitted from the last dispositive motion) that Royer’s\n\nConstitutional claims (Counts 9–10) should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\n\nor failure to state a claim. 5\n\nII.      ANALYSIS\n\n         A.       Motion for Summary Judgment Regarding Privacy Act Claims\n\n                  1.       Legal Standard\n\n         Summary judgment should be granted when “the movant shows that there is no genuine\n\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(a) (emphasis added); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247\n\n(1986). A fact is material if it could affect the outcome of the case. Id. A dispute is genuine if\n\nthe “evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Id.\n\n\n5\n  Because the motion to dismiss was filed after BOP filed its answer, it is technically one for judgment on the\npleadings. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). However, the standards for awarding judgment under a Rule 12(b)(6) motion\nto dismiss and Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings are “virtually identical.” See Haynesworth v.\nMiller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489887\"><a href=\"/opinion/489887/josiah-haynesworth-and-fred-hancock-v-frank-p-miller-chief-law/\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1245</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1254 (D.C.

Cir. 1999).\n\n              2.      Privacy Act Generally\n\n       The Privacy Act requires federal agencies maintaining “systems of records” to allow\n\nindividuals to review and request copies of and amendments to records pertaining to them. 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552a(d). The Act also imposes requirements regarding the accuracy and source of\n\ninformation agencies maintain.\n\n       “Systems of records” under the Privacy Act are those under the control of the agency\n\nfrom which “information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying\n\nnumber, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.” Id. § 552a(a)(5). In\n\nresponse to requests for amendment, agencies must either allow an individual to make\n\ncorrections or inform the individual of the reason for the agency’s refusal to amend and\n\nprocedures for seeking review of the refusal. Id. § 551a(d)(2). Agencies must also, “to the\n\ngreatest extent practicable,” collect information “directly from the subject individual when the\n\ninformation may result in adverse determinations about an individual’s rights, benefits, and\n\nprivileges under Federal programs.” Id. § 551a(e)(2). Finally, agencies must “maintain all\n\nrecords which are used by the agency in making any determination about any individual with\n\nsuch accuracy . . . as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the\n\ndetermination.” Id. § 552a(e)(5).\n\n       Judicial review is available when an agency refuses to provide access, copies, or\n\namendments, or fails to maintain accurate records or otherwise comply with the law “in such a\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\fway as to have an adverse effect on an individual.” Id. § 552a(g)(1). Courts may enjoin the\n\nagency from withholding records and order production and amendment of records. Id. §§\n\n552a(g)(2)(A)–(B), 552a(g)(3)(A)–(B). They may assess reasonable attorney fees and costs\n\nagainst the United States. Id. Actual damages are available in suits for failure to maintain\n\naccurate records or failure to comply with other provisions of the law if the agency acted\n\nintentionally or willfully. Id. § 552a(g)(4)(A)–(B).\n\n       Causes of action under the Privacy Act may be brought in the District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Columbia within two years from the date on which the cause of action arises. Id.\n\n§ 552a(g)(5).\n\n       The head of an agency with the principal function of enforcing criminal laws, including\n\ncorrectional agencies, may exempt systems of records from Privacy Act provisions, including\n\nthose provisions related to access, copying, amendment, and maintenance of accuracy of records.\n\nId. § 552a(j).    Federal regulations currently exempt BOP’s Inmate Central Record System\n\n(ICRS) from certain Privacy Act provisions, specifically those related to access to and\n\namendment of records, id. § 552a(d), collection of information directly from individuals, id. §\n\n552a(e)(2), civil remedies, id. § 552(g), and accuracy, id. § 552a(e)(5). See 28 CFR § 16.97.\n\nInmates may instead contest the accuracy and content of records administratively. 28 CFR §§\n\n16.9, 16.45; Letter from Wanda M. Hunt, Chief, FOIA/PA Section, Federal Bureau of Prisons, to\n\nRandall Royer, Aug. 19, 2009, ECF No. 91-1 at 31.\n\n                 3.   Summary Judgment Is Premature\n\n       Royer alleges that BOP knowingly maintained inaccurate records about him, Compl.\n\n¶¶ 132–33 (describing Counts 1–2); that BOP has intentionally and willfully failed to elicit\n\ninformation directly from him, Compl. ¶ 135 (describing Count 4); that it refuses to amend the\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\finaccurate records, Compl. ¶¶ 137–40 (describing Counts 6–7); and that it refuses to provide him\n\nwith access to these records, Compl. ¶¶ 141–47 (describing Counts 8–9). Royer seeks money\n\ndamages and an order that BOP give him access to the relevant records and amend inaccurate\n\nrecords. Compl. 35–36.\n\n        Royer’s Privacy Act claims relate primarily to his assertion that BOP continues to\n\nerroneously characterize Abu Zubair, the Bosnian group with whom he fought in 1994, as a\n\nterrorist organization with ties to Al Qaeda.              Royer’s complaint initially alleged that BOP\n\nobtained this erroneous information from a draft version of his PSR. That draft stated that Royer\n\nhad trained and fought with “Abu Zubar,” PSR ¶ 42, and that “Abu Zubair (known more\n\nformally as Abu Zubair al Madani) was a member of Al Qaeda sent to Bosnia by Bin Laden to\n\nestablish camps for Al Qaeda.” Compl. ¶ 33; Draft PSR ¶ 42. At his sentencing hearing, Royer\n\nobjected to the latter statement and argued that it confused the Bosnian Abu Zubair military\n\ngroup with an individual Al Qaeda member with a similar name who had died several years\n\nbefore Royer’s affiliation with the group. Compl. ¶¶ 15–22; Mem. Op. 3, ECF No. 59. The\n\ngovernment acknowledged the error and the court ordered that the line be stricken from the final\n\nPSR. Id.\n\n        Royer does not contest the accuracy of his final PSR, which is contained in his “Central\n\nFile” in BOP’s Inmate Central Records System. Compl. ¶ 25. However, Royer asserts that BOP\n\nsomehow obtained access to the erroneous information that had been deleted from the draft\n\nPSR. 6 Whatever the source of the information, Royer argues that it remains inaccurate, that BOP\n\nused it to classify him as a terrorist inmate, Compl. ¶¶ 32–41, that BOP has maintained similar\n\ninaccurate records they obtained from “open source reporting,” id. ¶ 39, and that BOP has failed\n6\n  There is much back and forth in the record about whether BOP had the actual draft PSR. However, Royer does\nnot now assert that BOP has the actual document but that BOP somehow obtained the deleted material, perhaps from\nan Addendum to the draft PSR which included Royer’s objection to the statement.\n\n                                                       9\n\fto provide him access to the records, to collect information directly from him, or to respond to\n\nhis requests that the records by amended. Compl. ¶¶ 42–44, 54–76.\n\n       BOP argues that it is “not in possession of the draft PSR as alleged by Plaintiff, nor has\n\nthe Bureau ever had possession of the draft PSR . . . [or] used information from a draft PSR in\n\nthe classification of Plaintiff.” Def.’s SMF ¶ 4 (citing Schiavone Decl. ¶ 6). BOP does not\n\nexplain why, in a letter to Royer, it used language that mirrored the deleted draft PSR language\n\nverbatim. See Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. 11, ECF No. 98-2 at 23 (including a statement that mirrors the\n\ndraft PSR verbatim that “Abu Zubair (known more formally as Abu Zubair al Madani) was a\n\nmember of Al Qaeda sent to Bosnia by Bin Laden to establish camps for Al Qaeda”).\n\n       BOP states that the “[final] PSR includes self-admissions by the Plaintiff to training and\n\nfighting with a group in Bosnia known as ‘Abu Zubair, II’ a group also known as Abu Zubair al\n\nMadani, which according to publicly available information, is associated with Al Qaeda, and\n\nidentified as a FTO.” Def.’s SMF ¶ 6. BOP goes on to list some of the “publicly available\n\nrecords” used to research Abu Zubair.\n\n       There are several problems with BOP’s assertion. First, in the PSR, Royer only admitted\n\nto training with a group known as “Abu Zubar”; the remainder of BOP’s statement appears to be\n\nbased on its own research. See PSR ¶ 42, ECF No. 100. Second, it does not appear that Abu\n\nZubair is now or has ever been listed as an FTO by the United States. See Foreign Terrorist\n\nOrganizations,       U.S.       Dep’t        of        State       (Sept.       28,       2012),\n\nhttp://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm. Third, the public records listed by BOP in\n\nsupport have already been called into question by Judge Brinkema of the Eastern District of\n\nVirginia and BOP has not provided this Court with any explanation for why the records are of\n\nany value. Although Judge Brinkema transferred the case to this Court for lack of venue, her\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\fOpinion is worth quoting at length both because she was the sentencing judge in Royer’s original\n\ncase and because BOP made substantially the same arguments before her that it now makes\n\nbefore this court. Judge Brinkema noted:\n\n        Royer raises some very serious allegations in his Complaint. In fact, in light of\n        arguments advanced by BOP itself, it appears that BOP may in fact be\n        maintaining inaccurate information about Royer, in violation of this Court’s oral\n        order during Royer’s sentencing hearing that Paragraph 42 of his Pre-Sentence\n        Report be stricken as erroneous. Specifically, in its Motion to Dismiss or for\n        Summary Judgment, BOP continues to make reference to the fact that Royer\n        fought with a Bosnian military unit known as “Abu Zubair,” and improperly\n        confuses that group with a now deceased al Qaeda operative by that same name. .\n        . . [T]he BOP . . . allege[s] that the Abu Zubair group with which plaintiff trained\n        and fought in Bosnia “is associated with al Qaeda,” and that “publicly available\n        records” . . . confirm that fact. In particular BOP cites four web sites which it\n        claims contain publicly available records tying the Bosnian Abu Zubair group to\n        terrorism. . . . [T]he link to www.historycommons.org [is] broken and no longer\n        connect[s] to [a] valid web site[]. Other [links], such as the links to a copy of an\n        indictment returned by a grand jury in the Northern District of Illinois and a press\n        release issued by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in that same case, replicate the same\n        confusion between the group Al Zubair and the individual by the same name that\n        gave rise to Royer’s original objection to his draft PSR. Thus, whether the\n        information regarding Abu Zubair was derived from the Addendum to Royer’s\n        PSR or from open source reporting, BOP appears to be perpetuating the exact\n        same error that the government already admitted to making during Royer’s\n        sentencing hearing. The government’s demonstrated inability to learn from its\n        own mistakes - mistakes to which it stipulated in a public hearing before this\n        Court - is a matter of serious concern.\n\nRoyer v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, No. 10-cv-0146, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4827727</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2–3 (E.D. Va.\n\nNov. 19, 2010).\n\n        For unknown reasons, the government continues to advance the same argument and put\n\nforth the same public sources (including a broken link) in support of its argument, despite having\n\npreviously acknowledged to a federal court that the information is inaccurate. 7                      If the\n\n\n\n7\n These sources continue to include, mysteriously, the home page of the Department of Justice, www.justice.gov.\nThe Court is unsure how citation to the Department’s homepage provides any support for the contention that Abu\nZubair is a terrorist organization with links to Al Qaeda. A search of the Department’s website produced no\nadditional information other than the indictment and press release already provided by the government.\n\n                                                     11\n\fgovernment has new, reliable information suggesting that the group Abu Zubair had ties to\n\nterrorist organizations, such as Al Qaeda, it should provide the Court with that information. 8\n\n        Despite the evidence that the government may be maintaining inaccurate information\n\nlinking Royer to Al Qaeda, the government argues that judicial review and the protections of the\n\nPrivacy Act are unavailable.\n\n        Specifically, BOP argues that the PSR, as a court document, is not within the purview of\n\nthe Privacy Act, “notwithstanding its use or retention by agencies such as BOP.” Def.’s Mem. 2.\n\nThis argument lacks merit. First, since BOP does not even acknowledge that it has the draft\n\nPSR, its potential status as a “court document” is irrelevant. Second, Royer does not assert that\n\nBOP has the actual draft PSR but that it somehow obtained the inaccurate information that had\n\noriginally been included in, and later stricken from, the draft document. The issue is not the\n\nsource of the information, but whether the information BOP continues to use and rely on is\n\ninaccurate.\n\n        BOP also argues that its ICRS system of records has been exempted from the civil\n\nremedy and damages provisions of the Privacy Act and that BOP has no duty to amend allegedly\n\ninaccurate records. Def.’s Mem. 15. BOP thus implicitly suggests that the records at issue are\n\nhoused in the ICRS, though it never states this explicitly. However, Royer does not dispute that\n\nthe ICRS is exempt from the Privacy Act. Pl.’s Opp’n 5. Rather, Royer argues that the records\n\nat issue here are “separate and distinct from the ICRS,” id. (quoting Compl. ¶ 36), and suggests\n\nthat they are part of the Counter Terrorism Unit’s (CTU) electronic database. He asserts that the\n\nCTU is a headquarters-level entity, that it “maintains all of the information it collects in a\n\n\n\n8\n Royer concedes that he previously had ties to LET, an organization later classified as an FTO. The Court does not\ndecide whether this link should qualify Royer as a “terrorist inmate.” However, if the Privacy Act applies, his\nassociation with LET is irrelevant. The issue is whether BOP erroneously links him to Al Qaeda.\n\n                                                       12\n\fdatabase of electronic records” maintained in Martinsburg, West Virginia and that its database is\n\na separate “system of records.” Id. at 7 (citing Tufte Decl. ¶ 11). 9\n\n        The Court need not and cannot resolve here whether the relevant records are housed in\n\nthe CTU database, whether that database constitutes a system of records, and whether that\n\nsystem is separate from the ICRS.              BOP makes no argument regarding whether the CTU\n\ndatabase is a system of records or is separate from ICRS. At this stage, the parties seem to\n\ndispute where the relevant information is housed and therefore whether it is exempt from Privacy\n\nAct provisions. Summary judgment is thus premature. The Court denies BOP’s motion without\n\nprejudice to refile.\n\n        B.       Motion to Dismiss Constitutional Claims for Lack of Subject Matter\n                 Jurisdiction\n\n        Because a lack of jurisdiction over Royer’s constitutional claims would require the Court\n\nto dismiss them, the Court first considers whether it has subject matter jurisdiction.

Based on this, he deduces that BOP records\nsuggesting that he was associated with Abu Zubair and that Abu Zubair was a terrorist organization must be located\nin a system of records other than the ICRS.\n\n                                                        13\n\f         Royer asserts that the Court has federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331,\n\nwhich provides for original jurisdiction over all civil actions “arising under the Constitution,\n\nlaws, or treaties of the U.S.” Compl. ¶ 5.

Section 3625 provides that the APA sovereign immunity waiver “do[es]\n\nnot apply to the making of any determination, decision, or order” under 18 U.S.C. §§ 3621–\n\n3626. BOP argues that it made its determination regarding Royer’s conditions of confinement\n\npursuant to 18 USC § 3621, which provides that BOP “shall designate the place of the prisoner’s\n\nimprisonment.” Thus, BOP argues, review of Royer’s constitutional claims is precluded. Def.’s\n\nMem. 18.\n\n       There are several problems with BOP’s argument. As an initial matter, it is not entirely\n\nclear that BOP’s categorization of plaintiff as a “terrorist inmate” was made pursuant to 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3621.    First, this section requires BOP to designate the “place” of an inmate’s\n\nimprisonment, not the conditions of confinement within any given facility. Moreover, Royer\n\nargues, and BOP elsewhere admits, that the decision to classify him as a “terrorist inmate” was\n\nmade at least in part pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4081 (“Classification and treatment of prisoners”).\n\nSee Def.’s Mem. 21–22. The provision negating the APA waiver of sovereign immunity applies\n\nonly to decisions made under 18 U.S.C §§ 3621–3626, and thus, by its terms, not to decisions\n\nmade under § 4081. Perhaps BOP’s decision was made pursuant to both of these statutory\n\nprovisions and perhaps judicial review of a decision made pursuant to both provisions could be\n\nprecluded. The Court need not resolve this question because BOP’s argument fails for other\n\nreasons.\n\n       Even assuming that BOP’s decision was made under 18 U.S.C. § 3621, the Court is not\n\nreviewing the merits of BOP’s decision as to where Royer is housed, but the constitutionality of\n\nthe conditions of confinement it places on him regardless of where he is housed. Colorable\n\nconstitutional claims are precluded from judicial review only where this has been made explicit\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\fby Congress. Here, Congress has precluded review of BOP “determination[s], decision[s], or\n\norder[s]” as to a prisoner’s place of imprisonment.                   However, Congress has not explicitly\n\nprecluded review of constitutional claims based on these or similar decisions.\n\n         The Supreme Court decided a similar issue in Webster v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112097\"><a href=\"/opinion/112097/webster-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988).\n\nThere, the Court held that § 102(c) of the National Security Act precluded judicial review of the\n\nDirector’s employment termination decisions. Webster, 486 U.S. at 601. However, the Court\n\nheld that the National Security Act did not preclude judicial review of constitutional challenges\n\nbased on those same termination decisions. Id. at 603–04 (“[The APA] remove[s] from judicial\n\nreview only those determinations specifically identified by Congress or ‘committed to agency\n\ndiscretion by law.’         Nothing in § 102(c) persuades us that Congress meant to preclude\n\nconsideration of colorable constitutional claims arising out of the actions of the Director pursuant\n\nto that section . . . .”). The Court noted:\n\n         We emphasized in Johnson v. Robison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108980\"><a href=\"/opinion/108980/johnson-v-robison/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1974), that where Congress\n         intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims its intent to do so must\n         be clear. . . . We require this heightened showing in part to avoid the “serious\n         constitutional question” that would arise if a federal statute were construed to\n         deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim.\n\nId. at 603 (internal citations omitted). Thus, although 18 U.S.C. § 3625 may preclude judicial\n\nreview of prison officials’ decisions regarding where a particular prisoner is housed, it does not\n\npreclude review of constitutional challenges arising out of those decisions. 11\n\n\n11\n   Royer argues that sovereign immunity does not bar his claims even in the absence of a § 702 waiver. Specifically,\nhe argues that where Congress has not clearly precluded judicial review of constitutional claims, there is a presumed\nright of equitable relief for constitutional violations. As Justice Harlan noted in his concurring opinion in Bivens,\nthere is a “presumed availability of federal equitable relief” to enforce the Constitution. 403 U.S. at 400 (Harlan, J.,\nconcurring). Similarly, the D.C. Circuit noted in Schnapper v. Foley that “[w]e may also doubt whether, even in the\nabsence of section 702, the Larson case would prevent a court from awarding equitable relief on the basis of\nappellants’ constitutional claims. The Larson Court was at some pains to note that injunctive relief against the\nsovereign could be obtained when the United States or an officer was found to have violated the Constitution . . . .”\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398192\"><a href=\"/opinion/398192/m-b-schnapper-public-affairs-press-a-corporation-of-the-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 108 n.2 (D.C.

Royer argues that his freedom of speech and association have\n\nbeen infringed, though his claim seems ultimately to be a freedom of association claim.\n\n       Specifically, Royer points out that, in contrast to the forty hours of full contact visits per\n\nmonth enjoyed by general population inmates, Compl. ¶ 80, BOP has limited him to two, two-\n\nhour noncontact visits per month.      If his family visits, he must talk with them through a\n\ntelephone, separated by a wall of concrete, glass, and bars. Compl. ¶ 107. Royer also notes that\n\nwhile inmates in the general population enjoy 300 minutes of telephone time per week, he has\n\nbeen limited to one 15-minute call per week and may only place it on business days between\n\n8:30am and 2:30pm. As a result, he has been effectively precluded from speaking with his\n\nschool-age children for months at a time. Compl. ¶ 96. Finally, Royer points to the “total,\n\npermanent” nature of the ban on physical contact with his family as evidence of the lack of a\n\nrational relationship between BOP’s goals and its policy.\n\n       According to Royer’s complaint, BOP has imposed these limitations because they need to\n\nmonitor his communications. However, Royer argues that the limits do not bear a rational\n\nrelation to a legitimate government interest, or that the limits are an exaggerated response to any\n\nsuch interest. Compl. ¶ 151. BOP responds that inmates do “not retain rights inconsistent with\n\nproper incarceration,” Def.’s Mem. 22, and that “freedom of association is among the rights least\n\ncompatible with incarceration,” id. at 23. Again, BOP argues that prison administrators must be\n\nable to exercise their judgment as to the appropriate means of furthering penological goals. Id.\n\n       The Supreme Court has acknowledged that “the Constitution protects ‘certain kinds of\n\nhighly personal relationships.’” Overton, 539 U.S. at 131 (quoting Roberts v.

In Jones, the\n\nCourt stated:\n\n       First Amendment associational rights . . . must give way to the reasonable\n       considerations of penal management. . . . [N]umerous associational rights are\n       necessarily curtailed by the realities of confinement. They may be curtailed\n       whenever the institution’s officials, in the exercise of their informed discretion,\n       reasonably conclude that such associations, whether through group meetings or\n       otherwise, possess the likelihood of disruption to prison order or stability, or\n       otherwise interfere with the legitimate penological objectives of the prison\n       environment.\n\n433 U.S. at 132.\n\n       In fact, the Supreme Court, applying the Turner reasonableness test, appears to have\n\nalready upheld regulations substantially similar to those Royer challenges. In Overton, the Court\n\nreversed a Sixth Circuit decision which had invalidated Michigan prison regulations pertaining to\n\nnoncontact visits. 539 U.S. at 131, 137. In addition to limiting the highest security risk inmates\n\nto noncontact visits, the regulations limited the number of total visitors an inmate could receive\n\nand restricted child visitors. Id. at 129–30. The regulations also provided that an inmate who\n\nhad committed multiple substance abuse violations while in jail could not receive any visitors\n\nother than attorneys or clergy members for a minimum of two years. Id. at 130. Although the\n\nCourt did not discuss at length the impact that a prohibition on physical contact has on inmates\n\n\n                                               21\n\fand their families, the Court found that the regulations met the Turner standard in that the\n\nregulation had a valid, rational connection to a legitimate government interest, alternative means\n\nwere available to inmates to exercise the asserted right, accommodating the right would cause a\n\nsignificant reallocation of resources and would impair the prison’s ability to protect all\n\nindividuals inside the prison walls, and no ready alternatives undermined the reasonableness of\n\nthe regulations. Id. at 132–36.\n\n        Although Overton thus appears directly on point, the Court now applies the Turner\n\nfactors to determine whether the federal practice challenged here is reasonable.\n\n        Applying the first Turner factor, there certainly appears to be a valid, rational connection\n\nbetween the rules applied to so-called “terrorist inmates” and a legitimate government interest. 13\n\nThe Supreme Court in Block v. Rutherford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111254\"><a href=\"/opinion/111254/block-v-rutherford/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), noted many of the security\n\nchallenges posed by contact visits:\n\n        Contact visits invite a host of security problems. They open the institution to the\n        introduction of drugs, weapons, and other contraband. Visitors can easily conceal\n        guns, knives, drugs, or other contraband in countless ways and pass them to an\n        inmate unnoticed by even the most vigilant observers. And these items can readily\n        be slipped from the clothing of an innocent child, or transferred by other visitors\n        permitted close contact with inmates.\n\nId. at 586.\n\n        Here, Royer concedes that at least one basis for BOP’s practice is the interest in\n\nmonitoring his communications. Compl. ¶ 109. In his Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, he\n\nconcedes that “monitoring inmates’ communication is, in the abstract, a legitimate penological\n\n\n13\n  The Court assumes, for the sake of this First Amendment analysis, the legality of the government’s “terrorist\ninmate” classification scheme and the accuracy of Royer’s classification. Royer separately challenges the\ngovernment’s failure to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking prior to implementing this scheme. Royer also\nseparately challenges, as discussed in more detail below, whether the scheme complies with procedural due process\nrequirements. The question before the Court with respect to Royer’s First Amendment challenge is whether,\nassuming the legality of the BOP’s classification of him as a “terrorist inmate,” the resulting conditions of his\nconfinement violate his First Amendment rights.\n\n                                                       22\n\fgoal” though he contests the legitimacy of monitoring him to a greater extent than other inmates.\n\nPl.’s Opp’n 56. In his complaint, he also quotes BOP regulations which state that control units\n\nsuch as the CMUs are “intended to place into a separate unit those inmates who are unable to\n\nfunction in a less restrictive environment without being a threat to others or to the orderly\n\noperation of the institution.” Additionally, although he notes that the majority of the inmates\n\nsubject to the same conditions are Muslims (40 of the 60 current or former CMU Terre Haute\n\ninmates according to his complaint), he does not assert that BOP has implemented these\n\nregulations in bad faith or for the purpose of discriminating against a particular religious group.\n\nSee Compl. ¶ 92. Thus, there appear to be at least two legitimate government interests at stake:\n\nthe need to monitor inmate communications and the need to isolate inmates that might pose a\n\nthreat to others or to the orderly operation of the institution.\n\n        Royer argues BOP has failed to put forward the “legitimate government interest” it seeks\n\nto further and that thus, it would be inappropriate to evaluate this factor or to decide the larger\n\nquestion on a motion to dismiss. Indeed, Royer is correct that BOP’s only justification for its\n\npractice appears to be that “prison administrators must be able to reasonably exercise their\n\njudgment as to the appropriate means of furthering penological goals.”          Nevertheless, the\n\nSupreme Court has said that the “burden . . . is not on the [government] to prove the validity of\n\nprison regulations but on the prisoner to disprove it.” Overton, 539 U.S. at 132 (citing Jones,\n\n433 U.S. at 128). This is particularly the case at the pleading stage where Royer must present\n\nfacts that plausibly state a claim. Given the state of the caselaw regarding prisoners’ first\n\namendment and visitation rights, Royer has not plausibly alleged here that there is no legitimate\n\ngovernment interest at stake, and in fact, has conceded that there is at least one legitimate\n\ngovernment interest. Thus, the Court now turns to the remainder of the Turner factors.\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\f        The second Turner factor considers “whether alternative means are open to inmates to\n\nexercise the asserted right.” Here, Royer acknowledges that, although he is prohibited from\n\nhaving contact visits with his family, he still retains the right to have noncontact visits, to make\n\nphone calls during business hours, and to write letters. Nevertheless, he argues that “there is no\n\nsubstitute for physical contact with loved ones” and that his wife would not have divorced him if\n\nBOP had not prohibited contact visits. Compl. ¶¶ 80, 117. He also asserts that phone calls are\n\nnot a viable alternative for speaking with his children because the calls are limited to business\n\nhours when the children are typically in school. Thus, he states, the “‘alternatives’ are so\n\nrestrictive . . . that they are rendered inadequate.” Pl.’s Opp’n 61.\n\n        However, although the Court must accept the facts asserted as true, it need not accept\n\nRoyer’s legal conclusions as to what constitutes “alternative means”. The Supreme Court has\n\nidentified alternative means of associating to include sending letters, making phone calls, and\n\neven sending messages through others who are allowed to visit. Overton, 539 U.S. at 135.\n\n“Alternatives to visitation need not be ideal . . . they need only be available.” Id. Thus, Royer\n\nhas failed to plausibly allege that no alternatives exist.\n\n        The third Turner consideration is the impact that accommodation of the asserted right\n\nwould have on guards, other inmates, and prison resources. On this point, Royer merely asserts\n\nthat there would be no “ripple effect” from accommodating his demands and that such\n\naccommodation would by “eas[y] and simpl[e].” Pl.’s Opp’n 62. However, Royer provides no\n\nfacts to support this assertion. The Court assumes that prison officials, in order to effectively\n\nmonitor Royer’s communications during these visits, would need to institute more stringent\n\nsearch procedures of Royer and his visitors prior to each visit and would need to have more staff\n\non hand to monitor the interactions between Royer and his visitors.\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\f        Finally, the Court considers whether there are “ready alternatives” which undermine the\n\nreasonableness of the regulations. On this point, Royer argues that BOP could meet its goal of\n\nmonitoring his visits at “no extra cost or risk to other inmates,” Pl.’s Opp’n 63, because BOP has\n\nalready “installed multiple cameras and hypersensitive microphones . . . [a]nd its officers\n\nthoroughly and expertly strip search all inmates both before and after contact visits.” Compl. ¶\n\n111. However, the Supreme Court has emphasized that the inquiry regarding this factor is not\n\nwhether prisons have imposed the least restrictive regulation but “whether the prisoner has\n\npointed to some obvious regulatory alternative that fully accommodates the asserted right while\n\nnot imposing more than a de minimis cost to the valid penological goal.” Overton, 539 U.S. at\n\n136. Increasing the number of inmates who must be strip searched before and after each contact\n\nvisit would surely increase the cost of visitation and divert attention from other priorities.\n\nMoreover, although Royer asserts that BOP has cameras and “hypersensitive” microphones, it is\n\nnot self-evident that this would obviate all security concerns that might arise from contact visits,\n\nsuch as the covert passing of notes, hand signals, or whispered conversations. As a result, Royer\n\nhas not sufficiently pled this factor either.\n\n        In summary, the Court has little trouble concluding that the restrictions on contact visits\n\nand phone calls survive Royer’s First Amendment freedom of association challenge. A more\n\ndifficult question is whether the alleged permanence of the restrictions raises additional\n\nconcerns. For example, in Overton, although the Court upheld a two-year ban on visitation from\n\nanyone other than clergy members and attorneys, the Court noted that it might reach a different\n\nconclusion regarding a “de facto permanent ban on all visitation for certain inmates.” 539 U.S.\n\nat 134; see also Beard v. Banks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145626\"><a href=\"/opinion/145626/beard-v-banks/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 535 (2006) (“[A]s in Overton, we agree that ‘the\n\nrestriction [denying newspapers, magazines, and photographs to specially dangerous and\n\n\n\n                                                25\n\frecalcitrant inmates] is severe,’ and ‘if faced with evidence that [it were] a de facto permanent\n\nban . . . we might reach a different conclusion in a challenge to a particular application of the\n\nregulation.’”).\n\n        However, even though Royer’s complaint alleges that the restrictions applicable to him\n\nare to last for the duration of his incarceration, they do not involve a complete ban on visitation\n\nor communication, but rather a ban on contact visits and a limit on the number of visit and phone\n\ncalls and time of day.

Id. at 486–87. In summarizing its\n\nholding, the Court noted that state-created liberty interests “will be generally limited to freedom\n\nfrom restraint which, while not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give\n\nrise to protection by the Due Process Clause of its own force, nonetheless imposes atypical and\n\nsignificant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id. at 484.\n\n       However, the Supreme Court has not yet defined what constitutes the “ordinary incidents\n\nof prison life” or, in other words, against what baseline courts should evaluate conditions of\n\nconfinement to determine whether they are atypical and significant. See Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at\n\n223 (describing the lack of agreement among the Courts of Appeals on the issue as well).\n\nNevertheless, the D.C. Circuit has considered the question and this Court relies on its analysis.\n\n       In Hatch v. Dist. of Columbia, the D.C. Circuit considered whether placement of an\n\ninmate in disciplinary and administrative segregation for seven months implicated Due Process.\n\n\n\n                                                 28\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765309\"><a href=\"/opinion/765309/donald-j-hatch-v-district-of-columbiaappellees/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. During these seven months, the plaintiff was “[c]onfined to his cell for twenty-\n\nthree and a half hours per day on weekdays and all forty-eight hours on weekend[s],” “had no\n\noutdoor recreation,” and “was not allowed to work or visit the library, gym, health clinic,\n\npsychological services, mailroom, clothing and bedding exchange, or culinary unit.” Id. at 848.\n\nHe was denied access to legal phone calls for ninety days. Id. The circuit court reversed the\n\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment for the government and remanded for further fact-\n\nfinding. The court concluded that the “ordinary incidents of prison life” should be evaluated in\n\nrelation to the “most restrictive confinement conditions that prison officials, exercising their\n\nadministrative authority to ensure institutional safety and good order, routinely impose on\n\ninmates serving similar sentences.” Id. at 856. The analysis requires a “factual determination of\n\nthe most restrictive conditions prison officials ‘ordinarily’ or ‘routinely’ impose” on prisoners\n\nserving similar sentences. 16 Id. at 857 (emphasis added). 17\n\n          In Hatch, the Circuit concluded that administrative segregation was an “ordinary\n\nincident” of life at the prison and should thus be included as part of the baseline for determining\n\nwhether the segregative confinement implicated a constitutionally protected liberty interest. Id.\n\nat 856.\n\n          However, the court noted, in addition to considering the nature of the deprivation in\n\nrelation to this baseline, that courts must also consider the length of the deprivation and whether\n\nthe segregation was within the range of what would be expected in light of the length of the\n\nsentence the prisoner is serving. Id. Because the possibility of transfer to another prison is one\n\n\n16\n  The Circuit did not explicitly define what constitutes a “similar sentences” but did emphasize the need for courts\nto consider the length of the sentence.\n17\n  While Sandin and Hatch dealt with Fourteenth Amendment Due Process claims and state prisons, there appears\nno reason why the analysis should not apply to Fifth Amendment Due Process claims and federal prisons. Indeed,\nother circuits have applied Sandin to due process claims against federal officials. See, e.g., Magluta v.

Rather, the Court need only determine whether the complaint contains sufficient\n\nfactual matter, accepted as true, to plausibly state a claim that the conditions are harsh and\n\natypical and thus implicate a liberty interest.       “Determining whether a complaint states a\n\nplausible claim for relief will . . . be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to\n\ndraw on its judicial experience and common sense.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679; see also Marion v.\n\nColumbia Correction Inst., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1388965\"><a href=\"/opinion/1388965/marion-v-columbia-correction-inst/\"><span class=\"volume\">559</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 699 (7th Cir. 2009) (reversing the dismissal of a\n\nprisoner’s due process claim because, without a factual record, the court could not determine\n\nwhether the actual conditions of the plaintiff’s confinement resulted in the implication of a\n\nliberty interest).\n\n        The Court holds that Royer has plausibly alleged harsh and atypical conditions. First, as\n\ndetailed above, Royer’s complaint alleges that he has been segregated from the general\n\npopulation for over six years and that during this time he has been subject to restrictions on the\n\n\n\n                                                 30\n\frecreational, religious, and educational opportunities normally available to prison inmates.\n\nRoyer’s contacts with his family have been limited to one 15-minute phone call per week during\n\nbusiness hours, when his school-age children are in school. Finally, he is limited to two, two-\n\nhour noncontact visits per month. It is true that Royer’s complaint does not specifically outline\n\nthe “most restrictive confinement conditions that prison officials, exercising their administrative\n\nauthority to ensure institutional safety and good order, routinely impose on inmates serving\n\nsimilar sentences.” However, Royer did note that while in the SHU at FCI Greenville, he was\n\n“isolated to a greater extent than is typical for the SHU,” that he was not allowed to exercise in\n\nthe recreation cages at the same time as other SHU inmates, that staff placed sandbags in front of\n\nhis cell door, and that unlike other SHU inmates, he was not permitted to have contact visits.\n\nCompl. ¶ 101. He also asserted that BOP had permanently imposed upon designated “terrorist\n\ninmates” the “harshest conditions of confinement in the federal prison system.” Compl. ¶ 106.\n\n        Even assuming that the conditions alleged by Royer are no more restrictive than the most\n\nrestrictive conditions normally imposed, for example in administrative segregation, Royer’s\n\ncomplaint plausibly alleges that they are “harsh and atypical” because of their duration. In\n\nnumerous parts of his complaint, he alleges that the conditions are permanent and are intended to\n\nremain in place for the duration of his 20-year sentence, or for a total of about 16.5 years. See\n\nWilkinson, 545 U.S. at 224 (noting that conditions in a supermax facility “likely would apply to\n\nmost solitary confinement” but that unlike solitary confinement generally, placement in a\n\nsupermax facility is indefinite, and relying on this in part to find that conditions were “harsh and\n\natypical”). 18\n\n\n\n18\n  Judge Urbina also found that the conditions to which “terrorist inmates” are subject plausibly could “constitute an\natypical and significant hardship” although he appears to have used conditions in the general population as the\nbaseline for comparison.

Next, BOP argues that its regulations concerning classification,\n\ndesignation, and transfer do not limit its discretion so as to create a legitimate expectation that a\n\nprisoner will be assigned to a particular facility. Def.’s Mem. 20. However, this is no longer the\n\nappropriate inquiry for determining whether a prisoner has liberty interest.

Royer Has Sufficiently Alleged Denial of Process Due\n\n       Due process requirements are “flexible and call[] for such procedural protections as the\n\nparticular situation demands . . . .” Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at 224 (internal quotation marks\n\n\n\n\n                                                 32\n\fomitted). Thus, in determining what process is due, courts rely not on rigid rules, but on the\n\nframework articulated in Mathews v. Eldridge. Under Mathews, courts consider three factors:\n\n       First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the\n       risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and\n       the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and\n       finally, the Government’s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal\n       and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural\n       requirement would entail.\n\n424 U.S. at 335.\n\n       The first Mathews factor, the private interest at stake, is to be evaluated “within the\n\ncontext of the prison system and its attendant curtailment of liberties.” Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at\n\n225. “[T]he procedural protections to which [prisoners] are entitled are more limited than in\n\ncases where the right at stake is the right to be free from confinement at all.” Id. The second\n\nfactor looks to the risk of erroneous deprivation through the procedures used and the value of any\n\nadditional safeguards. The Supreme Court has stated that notice of the factual basis for the\n\ngovernment’s decision and a “fair opportunity for rebuttal” are “among the most important\n\nprocedural mechanisms for purposes of avoiding erroneous deprivations.” Id. at 226. The third\n\nfactor, the government’s interest and burden of additional procedures, is a “dominant\n\nconsideration” in the context of prison management. Id. at 227. The government must ensure\n\nthe safety of guards and other prison personnel, other inmates, and the public. It must be able to\n\nprevent prison violence.    In the case of inmates who purportedly have links to terrorist\n\norganizations, the danger to the public is all the greater. Finally, the simple issue of time and\n\nmoney and the resources necessary to put in place additional procedures are relevant.\n\n       Hewitt v. Helms specifies the minimum procedures for placing an inmate in segregative\n\nconditions if he has a liberty interest in avoiding such segregation. See Hatch, 184 F.3d at 852\n\n(describing Hewitt’s minimum procedures). Those procedures include “some notice of the\n\n\n                                                33\n\fcharges against him and an opportunity to present his views to the prison official charged with\n\ndeciding whether to transfer him to administrative segregation.”         Hewitt 459 U.S. at 476.\n\n“Although a hearing need not occur prior to confinement in administrative segregation, it ‘must\n\noccur within a reasonable time following an inmate’s transfer.’” Hatch, 184 F.3d at 852 (quoting\n\nHewitt, 459 U.S. at 476 n.8.\n\n       The Court need not linger over the balance of these factors and the exact process required\n\nbecause the complaint plausibly alleges that any process provided by BOP was inadequate.\n\nRoyer alleges that he was taken from his cell “without warning” and only provided with an\n\n“Administrative Detention Order” stating that he was being moved to the SHU because he was\n\n“pending classification.” Compl. ¶ 88. Royer was apparently told at some point (or learned) that\n\nhe had been classified as a “terrorist inmate,” Compl. ¶¶ 81, 101, though it is unclear when or\n\nhow this occurred. Royer states that he was never provided with a hearing, with notice of the\n\ncriteria for release from the conditions, or with notice of the projected date for release from those\n\nconditions. Compl. ¶ 105.\n\n       Given these allegations, it is unclear that the prison ever directly provided him with\n\nnotice of the reasons for his segregation and it appears that he has had no opportunity for a\n\nhearing. Thus, his complaint plausibly alleges that he was denied due process.\n\nI.     CONCLUSION\n\n       In summary, the Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE BOP’s Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment regarding Royer’s Privacy Act claims. The Court finds that it has subject matter\n\njurisdiction to consider Royer’s constitutional claims and thus DENIES BOP’s motion to dismiss\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction. With respect to those constitutional claims, the Court GRANTS BOP’s\n\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fmotion to dismiss the First Amendment claim for failure to state a claim and DENIES BOP’s\n\nmotion to dismiss Royer’s Due Process claims.\n\n       Signed by Royce C. Lamberth, Chief Judge, on March 28, 2013.\n\n\n\n\n                                                35\n\f</pre>",
