CLARK and Barbara Brown, Plaintiffs-Appellants,\n\n                                     v.\n\n   CALHOUN COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI, et al., Defendants-Appellees.\n\n                              May 24, 1994.\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of Mississippi.\n\nBefore POLITZ, Chief Judge, and KING and DAVIS, Circuit Judges.\n\n     W. EUGENE DAVIS, Circuit Judge:\n\n     Plaintiffs   challenge    the    redistricting      plan   for    Calhoun\n\nCounty, Mississippi under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act.                   The\n\ndistrict court agreed with defendants that the black population in\n\nCalhoun County was not sufficiently geographically compact to form\n\na majority-black district.      Because the court's findings in this\n\nregard are not sufficiently particularized, we vacate and remand\n\nfor further findings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                     I.\n\n     Plaintiffs, James H. Clark and Barbara Brown, are black\n\nresidents and registered voters in Calhoun County, Mississippi.\n\nThey challenge the county's election districts under § 2 of the\n\nVoting   Rights   Act.    County          supervisors,    county      election\n\ncommissioners, and members of the board of education are elected\n\nfrom the five election districts in Calhoun County.                The named\n\ndefendants are:   Calhoun County;          the Calhoun County Democratic\n\nExecutive Committee;     the Calhoun County Republican Executive\n\n                                     1\n\fCommittee;   and the Calhoun County Election Commission.\n\n      In February 1991, following the release of the 1990 Census,\n\nthe Calhoun County Board of Supervisors engaged Three Rivers\n\nDevelopment and Planning District of Pontotoc, Mississippi (\"Three\n\nRivers\") to develop a redistricting plan for the county.          At the\n\nsame time, the Board of Supervisors appointed a 10-member biracial\n\ncommittee (made up of one black citizen and one white citizen from\n\neach election district) \"to act as a supervisory committee to the\n\nsaid Three Rivers ... and to assist in dissemination of information\n\nto the public.\"\n\n      The biracial committee met with Three Rivers in March 1991,\n\nand   approved    one   of   the   planning   company's   proposals   for\n\nredistricting.     After a televised public hearing during which a\n\nrepresentative of Three Rivers explained the need for redistricting\n\nand the changes being suggested, the Board of Supervisors adopted\n\nthe plan approved by the biracial committee.         The plan then was\n\nsubmitted to the Justice Department for preclearance pursuant to §\n\n5 of the Voting Rights Act.        In July 1991, the Justice Department\n\nadvised the county that the Attorney General had no objections to\n\nthe plan.\n\n      Plaintiffs filed suit on August 7, 1991, alleging that the\n\nredistricting plan violated § 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,\n\nas amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1973, and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth\n\nAmendments to the United States Constitution.1        Plaintiffs argued\n\n      1\n      This appeal only raises issues under § 2 of the Voting\nRights Act and does not involve plaintiffs' constitutional\nclaims.\n\n                                      2\n\fthat the redistricting plan should have included a majority-black\n\ndistrict given that black citizens comprise 27.017 of the general\n\npopulation and 23.477 of the voting-age population of Calhoun\n\nCounty. Under the redistricting plan, the largest concentration of\n\nblack citizens is in District 4, where they comprise 427 of the\n\npopulation (see Appendix A).   In support of their case, plaintiffs\n\nprepared a hypothetical districting plan which included a district\n\nwith a 74.97 black majority (see Appendix B).\n\n     A three-day bench trial was held in November 1992.   At trial,\n\nit was established that no black candidate has been elected in this\n\ncentury in Calhoun County as supervisor, justice court judge,\n\nconstable, sheriff, circuit clerk, chancery clerk, tax assessor,\n\nsuperintendent of education, school board member, coroner, county\n\nattorney, state senator, or state representative.     The evidence\n\nalso showed that, since 1980, twelve black candidates have run\n\nunsuccessfully for justice court judge, constable, sheriff, and\n\nschool board member.   The only black candidate to be elected to\n\ncounty-wide office during this time was Sheila Steen, who ran\n\nunopposed for Election Commissioner of District 3.\n\n     Plaintiffs' expert in racial bloc voting, Cheri McKinless,\n\ntestified that racial polarization exists in Calhoun County.   She\n\ntestified that, in black versus white elections, black citizens\n\nvote as a bloc for the black candidate, and white citizens tend to\n\nvote for the white candidate.     According to Ms. McKinless, for\n\nblack citizens to elect their preferred candidate to county-wide\n\noffice, they must comprise a majority of the voting-age population\n\n\n                                 3\n\fin a given district.         Ms. McKinless asserted that:                \"if the black\n\ncandidate is getting no support from the white population, there is\n\nno way a black candidate can be elected under the current system.\"\n\nIn response, defendants showed that three black candidates had been\n\nelected     to    the    Board   of      Aldermen        for   Bruce,    the    largest\n\nmunicipality in Calhoun County, and that one black candidate had\n\nbeen    elected     to    the    Board     of     Aldermen      for     Vardaman,     the\n\nfourth-largest municipality in the county.\n\n       After considering the evidence presented, the district court\n\nconcluded    that       plaintiffs    had       failed    to   establish       that   the\n\nredistricting plan violated § 2 of the Voting Rights Act.                             See\n\nClark v. Calhoun County, 813 F.Supp. 1189, 1202 (N.D.Miss.1993).\n\nThe court's ruling was bottomed primarily on its conclusion that\n\n\"plaintiffs have not proved that a geographically compact black\n\nmajority district can be created.\"                Id.     Alternatively, the court\n\nheld that a § 2 violation had not been established under the\n\n\"totality of circumstances.\"             Id.    On appeal, plaintiffs challenge\n\nboth of these conclusions;            we consider their arguments below.\n\n                                          II.\n\n                                           A.\n\n       Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, as amended, provides that:\n\n\"No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard,\n\npractice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or\n\npolitical subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or\n\nabridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to\n\nvote on account of race or color....\"                      42 U.S.C. 1973(a).          To\n\n\n                                            4\n\festablish a § 2 violation, members of the protected class must\n\ndemonstrate that, based on the totality of circumstances, they\n\n\"have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to\n\nparticipate in the political process and to elect representatives\n\nof their choice.\"     42 U.S.C. 1973(b).\n\n     In Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 48-51, 106 S.Ct. 2752,\n\n2765-67, 92 L.Ed.2d 25 (1986), the Supreme Court held that a\n\nplaintiff   must    demonstrate   three    \"preconditions\"   in   order   to\n\nestablish that an at-large voting scheme dilutes minority voting\n\nstrength and therefore violates § 2.              The minority group must\n\ndemonstrate that:     (1) it is sufficiently large and geographically\n\ncompact to constitute a majority in a single-member district;             (2)\n\nit is politically cohesive;         and (3) the white majority votes\n\nsufficiently as a bloc to enable it—in the absence of special\n\ncircumstances—usually      to     defeat    the     minority's    preferred\n\ncandidates.   Id.     The Supreme Court recently held that the same\n\npreconditions apply to challenges to single-member districts.             See\n\nGrowe v. Emison, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. 1075, 1084-\n\n85, 122 L.Ed.2d 388 (1993).\n\n     In this case, the district court found that plaintiffs had\n\nfailed to establish the first Gingles precondition, reasoning that:\n\n     Although plaintiffs have proved that the black population of\n     Calhoun County is sufficiently large enough to constitute a\n     majority in one district, they have failed to prove that this\n     same minority group is geographically compact.          Under\n     plaintiffs' proposed plan, blacks from three separate and\n     distinct municipalities, each having diverse interests, were\n     extracted to form District 1.      This exercise results in\n     extreme gerrymandering, plaintiff's proposed black district\n     having been \"drawn in an unusual or illogical manner to\n     enhance the voting power of a particular ... voting bloc at\n\n                                     5\n\f     the expense of other individuals or groups who would be\n     elected or help elect the candidates of their choice.\"\n     Magnolia Bar Association, Inc. v. Lee, 793 F.Supp. 1386, 1396\n     n. 11 (S.D.Miss.1992)....    In this court's opinion, under\n     plaintiffs' proposal, the voting strength of blacks not\n     included in District 1 would be diluted to such an extent that\n     they would have less opportunity to participate in the\n     political process and to elect members of their choice.\n\n813 F.Supp. at 1197-98.\n\n      We note initially that the district court's suggestion that\n\nthe formation of plaintiffs' proposed district would dilute the\n\nvoting strength of black citizens in the remaining districts does\n\nnot support its conclusion that the black population in Calhoun\n\nCounty is not sufficiently geographically compact.             Whenever a\n\nmajority-black district is created to remedy a § 2 violation, the\n\nnumber of black voters in the other districts must necessarily be\n\nreduced.      Indeed,   without   this   phenomenon,   no   majority-black\n\ndistricts would ever be created.         Because the record in this case\n\nreflects no loss of influence that is not found in every § 2 case,\n\nthe district court erred in finding that the loss of influence\n\nsupported its conclusion that the black population in Calhoun\n\nCounty was not sufficiently geographically compact.\n\n     We address next the district court's concerns about the shape\n\nor configuration of the proposed district.             The first Gingles\n\nprecondition does not require some aesthetic ideal of compactness,\n\nbut simply that the black population be sufficiently compact to\n\nconstitute a majority in a single-member district.           See, e.g., De\n\nGrandy   v.   Wetherell,   815    F.Supp.    1550,   1569   (N.D.Fla.1992)\n\n(three-judge court) (\"compactness is not an aesthetic concept\"),\n\nprob. juris. noted, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1249, 122 L.Ed.2d 648\n\n                                     6\n\f(1993).     Moreover, plaintiffs' proposed district is not cast in\n\nstone.        It   was   simply   presented   to   demonstrate   that   a\n\nmajority-black district is feasible in Calhoun County.           If a § 2\n\nviolation is found, the county will be given the first opportunity\n\nto develop a remedial plan.       See Westwego Citizens for Better Gov't\n\nv. City of Westwego, 946 F.2d 1109, 1124 (5th Cir.1991) (\"Westwego\n\nIII\").\n\n         Defendants argue that the Supreme Court's decision in Shaw v.\n\nReno, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993),\n\nsupports the district court's finding that plaintiffs have not\n\nestablished the first Gingles precondition.         In Shaw, the Court\n\nheld that plaintiffs state a claim under the Equal Protection\n\nClause, and trigger strict scrutiny, by alleging that a voting\n\nscheme is \"so extremely irregular on its face that it rationally\n\ncan be viewed only as an effort to segregate the races for purposes\n\nof voting, without regard for traditional districting principles\n\nand without sufficiently compelling justification.\"       Id., --- U.S.\n\nat ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2824.       However, the proposed district in this\n\ncase (see Appendix B) is not nearly as bizarre as the district\n\nunder consideration in Shaw.       We therefore need not decide whether\n\na bizarrely-shaped district which would enable plaintiffs to state\n\na claim under the Equal Protection Clause would necessarily flunk\n\nthe Gingles compactness test.2\n\n     2\n      The district court, of course, retains supervision over the\nfinal configuration of the districting plan. See Westwego III,\n946 F.2d at 1124. As such, the court should ensure that any\nremedial plan is \"consistent with the spirit of Shaw.\" Jeffers\nv. Tucker, --- F.Supp. ----, ----, 1994 WL 71471, at *6\n\n                                      7\n\f       The district court also found that the black population in\n\nCalhoun County was not sufficiently geographically compact because:\n\n\"Under plaintiffs' proposed plan, blacks from three separate and\n\ndistinct     municipalities,      each   having    diverse      interests,   were\n\nextracted to form [plaintiffs' proposed majority-black district].\"\n\nA   number    of    courts    have   concluded     that   the    first   Gingles\n\nprecondition is not satisfied if the proposed district does not\n\nretain a natural sense of community such that it can be effectively\n\nrepresented.       See, e.g., East Jefferson Coalition for Leadership &\n\nDev. v. Parish of Jefferson, 691 F.Supp. 991, 1007 (E.D.La.1988).\n\nHowever, we cannot properly review the district court's finding\n\nbecause it failed to explain the nature of the \"diverse interests\"\n\nand why they are so significant that plaintiffs' proposed district\n\ncould not be effectively represented.             We therefore are compelled\n\nto vacate the district court's judgment and remand to allow the\n\ncourt to make further findings on the compactness issue.\n\n      If the court finds, upon reconsideration, that the black\n\npopulation in Calhoun County is sufficiently compact, it should\n\nthen make definitive findings on the second and third Gingles\n\nfactors—the political cohesiveness of the black community and the\n\nability of the white majority usually to defeat the minority's\n\npreferred candidate.         As the district court correctly noted, these\n\ntwo factors are ordinarily established through evidence of racially\n\n\n(E.D.Ark.1994) (three-judge court). The court should make sure\nthat any remedial plan is narrowly tailored to correct any § 2\nviolation found to exist in Calhoun County. See Hays v. State of\nLouisiana, 839 F.Supp. 1188, 1206-09 (W.D.La.1993) (three-judge\ncourt), appeal filed, 62 U.S.L.W. 3670 (Mar. 28, 1994).\n\n                                         8\n\fpolarized voting.       See Westwego Citizens for Better Gov't v. City\n\nof Westwego, 872 F.2d 1201, 1207 (5th Cir.1989) (\"Westwego I \").\n\nDespite       recognizing     that   plaintiffs       presented   uncontradicted\n\nstatistical evidence that racially polarized voting exists in\n\nCalhoun County, the district court found that:\n\n            By limiting the analysis of racial bloc voting to the\n       twelve black candidates suggested by plaintiffs, there can be\n       no conclusion except that racial bloc voting did exist in\n       Calhoun County.     Although the steady increase in black\n       officeholders    in    the   County    cannot   remove    the\n       statistically-based conclusion presented by plaintiffs, it\n       clearly evidences, together with other evidence presented by\n       defendants, that racial polarization and racial bloc voting\n       are steadily but surely coming to an end in Calhoun County.\n\n813 F.Supp. at 1198.\n\n        The district court, of course, is not obliged to accept\n\nplaintiffs' statistical evidence as conclusive on the question of\n\nwhether racially polarized voting exists in Calhoun County.                     See\n\nTeague v. Attala County, 17 F.3d 796, 798 (5th Cir.1994). However,\n\nwhen    the     statistics    are    the       principal   evidence   offered    by\n\nplaintiffs       and   when    the   statistics       have   at   least   surface\n\nplausibility, the district court must ensure that it thoroughly\n\ndiscusses its reasons for rejecting that evidence.                 See id.\n\n       Moreover, the evidence presented by defendants in response to\n\nplaintiffs' statistical evidence has limited relevance. First, the\n\nelection of Ms. Steen to the county election commission was in an\n\nuncontested race that occurred while this litigation was pending.\n\nAs the Supreme Court noted in Gingles, the election of some black\n\ncandidates does not negate a § 2 claim and does not establish that\n\npolarized voting does not exist.               478 U.S. at 57, 75-76, 106 S.Ct.\n\n\n                                           9\n\fat 2769-70, 2779-80.            The Court noted that this was particularly\n\ntrue when the election was unopposed and occurred after litigation\n\nhad been initiated.            Id.,   see also Carrollton Branch of NAACP v.\n\nStallings, 829 F.2d 1547, 1560 (11th Cir.1987) (\"proof that the\n\nelection of a minority candidate to political office occurred after\n\ninitiation of a lawsuit could be a factor mitigating against a\n\nfinding of increased minority electoral success\"), cert. denied,\n\n485 U.S. 936, 108 S.Ct. 1111, 99 L.Ed.2d 272 (1988).\n\n     Second, the municipal elections in Bruce and Vardaman do not\n\ndemonstrate that black citizens have an equal opportunity to elect\n\ntheir preferred candidates to county-wide offices.                   As we have\n\npreviously held, \"elections involving the particular office at\n\nissue    will     be    more    relevant    than    elections   involving      other\n\noffices.\"        Magnolia Bar Ass'n v. Lee, 994 F.2d 1143, 1149 (5th\n\nCir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 555, 126 L.Ed.2d 456\n\n(1993);     see also Rangel v. Morales, 8 F.3d 242, 245-46 (5th\n\nCir.1993).       Thus, in analyzing voting patterns in Calhoun County,\n\nthe district court should accord greater weight to the virtual\n\nabsence of black electoral success in county-wide elections as\n\nopposed to their limited electoral success in municipal elections.\n\n     In summary, because the district court's findings as to the\n\nfirst Gingles precondition are not sufficiently particularized, we\n\nvacate the court's judgment and remand for further findings on this\n\nissue.      If    the    court    finds    that    this   precondition   has    been\n\nsatisfied, it should then make definitive findings regarding the\n\nevidence of racially polarized voting in Calhoun County.\n\n\n                                           10\n\f                                     B.\n\n     Considering our remarks above remanding this case for further\n\nfindings on the Gingles factors and given the key role that\n\nracially polarized voting plays in the totality of circumstances\n\ninquiry, see Westwego III, 946 F.2d at 1120, we also vacate the\n\ndistrict court's alternative holding bottomed on the totality of\n\ncircumstances.        After   reconsidering      the   evidence   of   racially\n\npolarized    voting   in   the   context    of   the   Gingles    factors,   the\n\ndistrict court should then reconsider its findings with respect to\n\nthe totality of circumstances.             As the Third Circuit recently\n\nexplained:\n\n     it will be only the very unusual case in which the plaintiffs\n     can establish the existence of the three Gingles factors but\n     still have failed to establish a violation of § 2 under the\n     totality of circumstances.

County supervisors, county election commissioners, and members of the board of education are elected from the five election districts in Calhoun County.  The named defendants are:  Calhoun County;  the Calhoun County Democratic Executive Committee;  the Calhoun County Republican Executive Committee;  and the Calhoun County Election Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1991, following the release of the 1990 Census, the Calhoun County Board of Supervisors engaged Three Rivers Development and Planning District of Pontotoc, Mississippi (\"Three Rivers\") to develop a redistricting plan for the county.  At the same time, the Board of Supervisors appointed a 10-member biracial committee (made up of one black citizen and one white citizen from each election district) \"to act as a supervisory committee to the said Three Rivers ... and to assist in dissemination of information to the public.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The biracial committee met with Three Rivers in March 1991, and approved one of the planning company's proposals for redistricting.  After a televised public hearing during which a representative of Three Rivers explained the need for redistricting and the changes being suggested, the Board of Supervisors adopted the plan approved by the biracial committee.  The plan then was submitted to the Justice Department for preclearance pursuant to Sec. 5 of the Voting Rights Act.  In July 1991, the Justice Department advised the county that the Attorney General had no objections to the plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs filed suit on August 7, 1991, alleging that the redistricting plan violated Sec. 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973, and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Plaintiffs argued that the redistricting plan should have included a majority-black district given that black citizens comprise 27.01% of the general population and 23.47% of the voting-age population of Calhoun County.  Under the redistricting plan, the largest concentration of black citizens is in District 4, where they comprise 42% of the population (see Appendix A).  In support of their case, plaintiffs prepared a hypothetical districting plan which included a district with a 74.9% black majority (see Appendix B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A three-day bench trial was held in November 1992.  At trial, it was established that no black candidate has been elected in this century in Calhoun County as supervisor, justice court judge, constable, sheriff, circuit clerk, chancery clerk, tax assessor, superintendent of education, school board member, coroner, county attorney, state senator, or state representative.  The evidence also showed that, since 1980, twelve black candidates have run unsuccessfully for justice court judge, constable, sheriff, and school board member.  The only black candidate to be elected to county-wide office during this time was Sheila Steen, who ran unopposed for Election Commissioner of District 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' expert in racial bloc voting, Cheri McKinless, testified that racial polarization exists in Calhoun County.  She testified that, in black versus white elections, black citizens vote as a bloc for the black candidate, and white citizens tend to vote for the white candidate.  According to Ms. McKinless, for black citizens to elect their preferred candidate to county-wide office, they must comprise a majority of the voting-age population in a given district.  Ms. McKinless asserted that:  \"if the black candidate is getting no support from the white population, there is no way a black candidate can be elected under the current system.\"   In response, defendants showed that three black candidates had been elected to the Board of Aldermen for Bruce, the largest municipality in Calhoun County, and that one black candidate had been elected to the Board of Aldermen for Vardaman, the fourth-largest municipality in the county.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering the evidence presented, the district court concluded that plaintiffs had failed to establish that the redistricting plan violated Sec. 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  See Clark v. Calhoun County, 813 F.Supp. 1189, 1202 (N.D.Miss.1993).  The court's ruling was bottomed primarily on its conclusion that \"plaintiffs have not proved that a geographically compact black majority district can be created.\"  Id.  Alternatively, the court held that a Sec. 2 violation had not been established under the \"totality of circumstances.\"  Id.  On appeal, plaintiffs challenge both of these conclusions;  we consider their arguments below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, as amended, provides that:  \"No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color....\"  42 U.S.C. 1973(a).  To establish a Sec. 2 violation, members of the protected class must demonstrate that, based on the totality of circumstances, they \"have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\"  42 U.S.C. 1973(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 48-51, 106 S.Ct. 2752, 2765-67, 92 L.Ed.2d 25 (1986), the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff must demonstrate three \"preconditions\" in order to establish that an at-large voting scheme dilutes minority voting strength and therefore violates Sec. 2.  The minority group must demonstrate that:  (1) it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district; (2) it is politically cohesive;  and (3) the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it--in the absence of special circumstances--usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidates.  Id.  The Supreme Court recently held that the same preconditions apply to challenges to single-member districts.  See Growe v. Emison, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. 1075, 1084-85, 122 L.Ed.2d 388 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court found that plaintiffs had failed to establish the first Gingles precondition, reasoning that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Although plaintiffs have proved that the black population of Calhoun County is sufficiently large enough to constitute a majority in one district, they have failed to prove that this same minority group is geographically compact.  Under plaintiffs' proposed plan, blacks from three separate and distinct municipalities, each having diverse interests, were extracted to form District 1.  This exercise results in extreme gerrymandering, plaintiff's proposed black district having been \"drawn in an unusual or illogical manner to enhance the voting power of a particular ... voting bloc at the expense of other individuals or groups who would be elected or help elect the candidates of their choice.\"  Magnolia Bar Association, Inc. v. Lee, 793 F.Supp. 1386, 1396 n. 11 (S.D.Miss.1992)....   In this court's opinion, under plaintiffs' proposal, the voting strength of blacks not included in District 1 would be diluted to such an extent that they would have less opportunity to participate in the political process and to elect members of their choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">813 F.Supp. at 1197-98.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note initially that the district court's suggestion that the formation of plaintiffs' proposed district would dilute the voting strength of black citizens in the remaining districts does not support its conclusion that the black population in Calhoun County is not sufficiently geographically compact.  Whenever a majority-black district is created to remedy a Sec. 2 violation, the number of black voters in the other districts must necessarily be reduced.  Indeed, without this phenomenon, no majority-black districts would ever be created.  Because the record in this case reflects no loss of influence that is not found in every Sec. 2 case, the district court erred in finding that the loss of influence supported its conclusion that the black population in Calhoun County was not sufficiently geographically compact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address next the district court's concerns about the shape or configuration of the proposed district.  The first Gingles precondition does not require some aesthetic ideal of compactness, but simply that the black population be sufficiently compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district.  See, e.g., De Grandy v. Wetherell, 815 F.Supp. 1550, 1569 (N.D.Fla.1992) (three-judge court) (\"compactness is not an aesthetic concept\"), prob. juris. noted, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1249, 122 L.Ed.2d 648 (1993).  Moreover, plaintiffs' proposed district is not cast in stone.  It was simply presented to demonstrate that a majority-black district is feasible in Calhoun County.  If a Sec. 2 violation is found, the county will be given the first opportunity to develop a remedial plan.  See Westwego Citizens for Better Gov't v. City of Westwego, 946 F.2d 1109, 1124 (5th Cir.1991) (\"Westwego III\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the Supreme Court's decision in Shaw v. Reno, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993), supports the district court's finding that plaintiffs have not established the first Gingles precondition.  In Shaw, the Court held that plaintiffs state a claim under the Equal Protection Clause, and trigger strict scrutiny, by alleging that a voting scheme is \"so extremely irregular on its face that it rationally can be viewed only as an effort to segregate the races for purposes of voting, without regard for traditional districting principles and without sufficiently compelling justification.\"  Id., --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2824.   However, the proposed district in this case (see Appendix B) is not nearly as bizarre as the district under consideration in Shaw.   We therefore need not decide whether a bizarrely-shaped district which would enable plaintiffs to state a claim under the Equal Protection Clause would necessarily flunk the Gingles compactness test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also found that the black population in Calhoun County was not sufficiently geographically compact because:  \"Under plaintiffs' proposed plan, blacks from three separate and distinct municipalities, each having diverse interests, were extracted to form [plaintiffs' proposed majority-black district].\"  A number of courts have concluded that the first Gingles precondition is not satisfied if the proposed district does not retain a natural sense of community such that it can be effectively represented.  See, e.g., East Jefferson Coalition for Leadership &amp; Dev. v. Parish of Jefferson, 691 F.Supp. 991, 1007 (E.D.La.1988).  However, we cannot properly review the district court's finding because it failed to explain the nature of the \"diverse interests\" and why they are so significant that plaintiffs' proposed district could not be effectively represented.  We therefore are compelled to vacate the district court's judgment and remand to allow the court to make further findings on the compactness issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the court finds, upon reconsideration, that the black population in Calhoun County is sufficiently compact, it should then make definitive findings on the second and third Gingles factors--the political cohesiveness of the black community and the ability of the white majority usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.  As the district court correctly noted, these two factors are ordinarily established through evidence of racially polarized voting.  See Westwego Citizens for Better Gov't v. City of Westwego, 872 F.2d 1201, 1207 (5th Cir.1989) (\"Westwego I \").   Despite recognizing that plaintiffs presented uncontradicted statistical evidence that racially polarized voting exists in Calhoun County, the district court found that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By limiting the analysis of racial bloc voting to the twelve black candidates suggested by plaintiffs, there can be no conclusion except that racial bloc voting did exist in Calhoun County.  Although the steady increase in black officeholders in the County cannot remove the statistically-based conclusion presented by plaintiffs, it clearly evidences, together with other evidence presented by defendants, that racial polarization and racial bloc voting are steadily but surely coming to an end in Calhoun County.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">813 F.Supp. at 1198.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, of course, is not obliged to accept plaintiffs' statistical evidence as conclusive on the question of whether racially polarized voting exists in Calhoun County.  See Teague v. Attala County, 17 F.3d 796, 798 (5th Cir.1994).  However, when the statistics are the principal evidence offered by plaintiffs and when the statistics have at least surface plausibility, the district court must ensure that it thoroughly discusses its reasons for rejecting that evidence.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the evidence presented by defendants in response to plaintiffs' statistical evidence has limited relevance.  First, the election of Ms. Steen to the county election commission was in an uncontested race that occurred while this litigation was pending.  As the Supreme Court noted in Gingles, the election of some black candidates does not negate a Sec. 2 claim and does not establish that polarized voting does not exist.  478 U.S. at 57, 75-76, 106 S.Ct. at 2769-70, 2779-80.   The Court noted that this was particularly true when the election was unopposed and occurred after litigation had been initiated.  Id.,  see also Carrollton Branch of NAACP v. Stallings, 829 F.2d 1547, 1560 (11th Cir.1987) (\"proof that the election of a minority candidate to political office occurred after initiation of a lawsuit could be a factor mitigating against a finding of increased minority electoral success\"), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 936, 108 S.Ct. 1111, 99 L.Ed.2d 272 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the municipal elections in Bruce and Vardaman do not demonstrate that black citizens have an equal opportunity to elect their preferred candidates to county-wide offices.  As we have previously held, \"elections involving the particular office at issue will be more relevant than elections involving other offices.\"  Magnolia Bar Ass'n v. Lee, 994 F.2d 1143, 1149 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 555, 126 L.Ed.2d 456 (1993);  see also Rangel v. Morales, 8 F.3d 242, 245-46 (5th Cir.1993).  Thus, in analyzing voting patterns in Calhoun County, the district court should accord greater weight to the virtual absence of black electoral success in county-wide elections as opposed to their limited electoral success in municipal elections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, because the district court's findings as to the first Gingles precondition are not sufficiently particularized, we vacate the court's judgment and remand for further findings on this issue.  If the court finds that this precondition has been satisfied, it should then make definitive findings regarding the evidence of racially polarized voting in Calhoun County.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering our remarks above remanding this case for further findings on the Gingles factors and given the key role that racially polarized voting plays in the totality of circumstances inquiry, see Westwego III, 946 F.2d at 1120, we also vacate the district court's alternative holding bottomed on the totality of circumstances.  After reconsidering the evidence of racially polarized voting in the context of the Gingles factors, the district court should then reconsider its findings with respect to the totality of circumstances.  As the Third Circuit recently explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>it will be only the very unusual case in which the plaintiffs can establish the existence of the three Gingles factors but still have failed to establish a violation of Sec. 2 under the totality of circumstances.  In such cases, the district court must explain with particularity why it has concluded, under the particular facts of that case, that an electoral system that routinely results in white voters voting as a bloc to defeat the candidate of choice of a politically cohesive minority group is not violative of Sec. 2 of the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jenkins v.

After a televised public hearing during which a representative of Three Rivers explained the need for redistricting and the changes being suggested, the Board of Supervisors adopted the plan approved by the biracial committee.  The plan then was submitted to the Justice Department for preclearance pursuant to Sec. 5 of the Voting Rights Act.  In July 1991, the Justice Department advised the county that the Attorney General had no objections to the plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs filed suit on August 7, 1991, alleging that the redistricting plan violated Sec. 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973, and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Plaintiffs argued that the redistricting plan should have included a majority-black district given that black citizens comprise 27.01% of the general population and 23.47% of the voting-age population of Calhoun County.  Under the redistricting plan, the largest concentration of black citizens is in District 4, where they comprise 42% of the population (see Appendix A).  In support of their case, plaintiffs prepared a hypothetical districting plan which included a district with a 74.9% black majority (see Appendix B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A three-day bench trial was held in November 1992.  At trial, it was established that no black candidate has been elected in this century in Calhoun County as supervisor, justice court judge, constable, sheriff, circuit clerk, chancery clerk, tax assessor, superintendent of education, school board member, coroner, county attorney, state senator, or state representative.  The evidence also showed that, since 1980, twelve black candidates have run unsuccessfully for justice court judge, constable, sheriff, and school board member.  The only black candidate to be elected to county-wide office during this time was Sheila Steen, who ran unopposed for Election Commissioner of District 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' expert in racial bloc voting, Cheri McKinless, testified that racial polarization exists in Calhoun County.  She testified that, in black versus white elections, black citizens vote as a bloc for the black candidate, and white citizens tend to vote for the white candidate.  According to Ms. McKinless, for black citizens to elect their preferred candidate to county-wide office, they must comprise a majority of the voting-age population in a given district.  Ms. McKinless asserted that:  \"if the black candidate is getting no support from the white population, there is no way a black candidate can be elected under the current system.\"   In response, defendants showed that three black candidates had been elected to the Board of Aldermen for Bruce, the largest municipality in Calhoun County, and that one black candidate had been elected to the Board of Aldermen for Vardaman, the fourth-largest municipality in the county.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering the evidence presented, the district court concluded that plaintiffs had failed to establish that the redistricting plan violated Sec. 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1189</span></span>, 1202 (N.D.Miss.1993).  The court's ruling was bottomed primarily on its conclusion that \"plaintiffs have not proved that a geographically compact black majority district can be created.\"  Id.  Alternatively, the court held that a Sec. 2 violation had not been established under the \"totality of circumstances.\"  Id.

To establish a Sec. 2 violation, members of the protected class must demonstrate that, based on the totality of circumstances, they \"have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\"  42 U.S.C. 1973(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Thornburg v.

The minority group must demonstrate that:  (1) it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district; (2) it is politically cohesive;  and (3) the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it--in the absence of special circumstances--usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidates.  Id.  The Supreme Court recently held that the same preconditions apply to challenges to single-member districts.  See Growe v. Emison, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112818\"><a href=\"/opinion/112818/growe-v-emison/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under plaintiffs' proposed plan, blacks from three separate and distinct municipalities, each having diverse interests, were extracted to form District 1.  This exercise results in extreme gerrymandering, plaintiff's proposed black district having been \"drawn in an unusual or illogical manner to enhance the voting power of a particular ... voting bloc at the expense of other individuals or groups who would be elected or help elect the candidates of their choice.\"  Magnolia Bar Association, Inc. v. Lee, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1386</span></span>, 1396 n. 11 (S.D.Miss.1992)....   In this court's opinion, under plaintiffs' proposal, the voting strength of blacks not included in District 1 would be diluted to such an extent that they would have less opportunity to participate in the political process and to elect members of their choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">813 F.Supp. at 1197-98.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note initially that the district court's suggestion that the formation of plaintiffs' proposed district would dilute the voting strength of black citizens in the remaining districts does not support its conclusion that the black population in Calhoun County is not sufficiently geographically compact.  Whenever a majority-black district is created to remedy a Sec. 2 violation, the number of black voters in the other districts must necessarily be reduced.  Indeed, without this phenomenon, no majority-black districts would ever be created.  Because the record in this case reflects no loss of influence that is not found in every Sec. 2 case, the district court erred in finding that the loss of influence supported its conclusion that the black population in Calhoun County was not sufficiently geographically compact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address next the district court's concerns about the shape or configuration of the proposed district.  The first Gingles precondition does not require some aesthetic ideal of compactness, but simply that the black population be sufficiently compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district.  See, e.g., De Grandy v. Wetherell, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1550</span></span>, 1569 (N.D.Fla.1992) (three-judge court) (\"compactness is not an aesthetic concept\"), prob. juris. noted, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></span> (1993).  Moreover, plaintiffs' proposed district is not cast in stone.  It was simply presented to demonstrate that a majority-black district is feasible in Calhoun County.  If a Sec. 2 violation is found, the county will be given the first opportunity to develop a remedial plan.  See Westwego Citizens for Better Gov't v. City of Westwego, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570045\"><a href=\"/opinion/570045/westwego-citizens-for-better-government-v-city-of-westwego/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1109</span></a></span>, 1124 (5th Cir.1991) (\"Westwego III\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the Supreme Court's decision in Shaw v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span> (1993), supports the district court's finding that plaintiffs have not established the first Gingles precondition.  In Shaw, the Court held that plaintiffs state a claim under the Equal Protection Clause, and trigger strict scrutiny, by alleging that a voting scheme is \"so extremely irregular on its face that it rationally can be viewed only as an effort to segregate the races for purposes of voting, without regard for traditional districting principles and without sufficiently compelling justification.\"  Id., --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2824.   However, the proposed district in this case (see Appendix B) is not nearly as bizarre as the district under consideration in Shaw.   We therefore need not decide whether a bizarrely-shaped district which would enable plaintiffs to state a claim under the Equal Protection Clause would necessarily flunk the Gingles compactness test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also found that the black population in Calhoun County was not sufficiently geographically compact because:  \"Under plaintiffs' proposed plan, blacks from three separate and distinct municipalities, each having diverse interests, were extracted to form [plaintiffs' proposed majority-black district].\"  A number of courts have concluded that the first Gingles precondition is not satisfied if the proposed district does not retain a natural sense of community such that it can be effectively represented.  See, e.g., East Jefferson Coalition for Leadership &amp; Dev. v. Parish of Jefferson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1813582\"><a href=\"/opinion/1813582/east-jefferson-coalition-v-jefferson-parish/\"><span class=\"volume\">691</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span>, 1007 (E.D.La.1988).  However, we cannot properly review the district court's finding because it failed to explain the nature of the \"diverse interests\" and why they are so significant that plaintiffs' proposed district could not be effectively represented.  We therefore are compelled to vacate the district court's judgment and remand to allow the court to make further findings on the compactness issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the court finds, upon reconsideration, that the black population in Calhoun County is sufficiently compact, it should then make definitive findings on the second and third Gingles factors--the political cohesiveness of the black community and the ability of the white majority usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.  As the district court correctly noted, these two factors are ordinarily established through evidence of racially polarized voting.  See Westwego Citizens for Better Gov't v. City of Westwego, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521914\"><a href=\"/opinion/521914/westwego-citizens-for-better-government-v-city-of-westwego-a-municipal/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1201</span></a></span>, 1207 (5th Cir.1989) (\"Westwego I \").   Despite recognizing that plaintiffs presented uncontradicted statistical evidence that racially polarized voting exists in Calhoun County, the district court found that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By limiting the analysis of racial bloc voting to the twelve black candidates suggested by plaintiffs, there can be no conclusion except that racial bloc voting did exist in Calhoun County.  Although the steady increase in black officeholders in the County cannot remove the statistically-based conclusion presented by plaintiffs, it clearly evidences, together with other evidence presented by defendants, that racial polarization and racial bloc voting are steadily but surely coming to an end in Calhoun County.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">813 F.Supp. at 1198.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, of course, is not obliged to accept plaintiffs' statistical evidence as conclusive on the question of whether racially polarized voting exists in Calhoun County.  See Teague v. Attala County, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6347\"><a href=\"/opinion/6347/teague-v-attala-county-miss/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></a></span>, 798 (5th Cir.1994).  However, when the statistics are the principal evidence offered by plaintiffs and when the statistics have at least surface plausibility, the district court must ensure that it thoroughly discusses its reasons for rejecting that evidence.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the evidence presented by defendants in response to plaintiffs' statistical evidence has limited relevance.  First, the election of Ms. Steen to the county election commission was in an uncontested race that occurred while this litigation was pending.  As the Supreme Court noted in Gingles, the election of some black candidates does not negate a Sec. 2 claim and does not establish that polarized voting does not exist.  478 U.S. at 57, 75-76, 106 S.Ct. at 2769-70, 2779-80.   The Court noted that this was particularly true when the election was unopposed and occurred after litigation had been initiated.  Id.,  see also Carrollton Branch of NAACP v.

Thus, in analyzing voting patterns in Calhoun County, the district court should accord greater weight to the virtual absence of black electoral success in county-wide elections as opposed to their limited electoral success in municipal elections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, because the district court's findings as to the first Gingles precondition are not sufficiently particularized, we vacate the court's judgment and remand for further findings on this issue.  If the court finds that this precondition has been satisfied, it should then make definitive findings regarding the evidence of racially polarized voting in Calhoun County.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering our remarks above remanding this case for further findings on the Gingles factors and given the key role that racially polarized voting plays in the totality of circumstances inquiry, see Westwego III, 946 F.2d at 1120, we also vacate the district court's alternative holding bottomed on the totality of circumstances.  After reconsidering the evidence of racially polarized voting in the context of the Gingles factors, the district court should then reconsider its findings with respect to the totality of circumstances.  As the Third Circuit recently explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>it will be only the very unusual case in which the plaintiffs can establish the existence of the three Gingles factors but still have failed to establish a violation of Sec. 2 under the totality of circumstances.  In such cases, the district court must explain with particularity why it has concluded, under the particular facts of that case, that an electoral system that routinely results in white voters voting as a bloc to defeat the candidate of choice of a politically cohesive minority group is not violative of Sec. 2 of the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jenkins v.
