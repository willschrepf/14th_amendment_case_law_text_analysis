In four issues, the State contends the district court's judgment must be reversed\r\nbecause: (1) Seton's action for declaratory judgment was moot or alternatively Seton's request for\r\ndeclaratory judgment was barred by sovereign immunity; (2) the State was entitled to injunctive\r\nrelief in addition to the assessment of a civil penalty against Seton; (3) the court's assessment of the\r\nminimum penalty constituted an abuse of discretion; and (4) the failure to award the State reasonable\r\nattorney's fees and costs constituted an abuse of discretion.  We will affirm in part and reverse and\r\nremand in part.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tSeton is a licensed health maintenance organization (\"HMO\") providing health\r\nbenefits plans, claims administration, and claims payment for member groups throughout central\r\nTexas.  Under Chapter 108 of the Texas Health and Safety Code (\"the Code\"), Seton must file a\r\nverified annual Health Plan Employer Data Information Set (\"HEDIS\") report with the Council.  <em>See\r\n</em>Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code §§ 108.009, .010 (West 2001); <em>see also </em>25 Tex. Admin. Code § 1301.33\r\n(West 2002) (Texas Health Care Information Council, Health Care Information).  The HEDIS report\r\nmust include data on the number of members served by the HMO, the demographics of the services\r\nprovided, aggregate claims information, and related information for the specified reporting period. \r\nThe Code provides for a civil penalty for failure to file an annual HEDIS report: \"A person who fails\r\nto supply available data under Sections 108.009 and 108.010 is liable for a civil penalty of not less\r\nthan $1,000 or more than $10,000 for each act of violation.\"  Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code\r\n§ 108.014(b).  Seton's 1999 report was due to be filed with the Council by June 15, 2000.  Seton did\r\nnot file its report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn January 10, 2001, Seton was notified by a letter from the Attorney General (the\r\n\"Johnsonius letter\") that it had failed to file the 1999 HEDIS report and that \"demand is hereby made\r\nfor the amount of $153,000 in civil penalties.\"  The letter also stated that if Seton did not make the\r\npayment to the Council, the Attorney General \"will file a lawsuit against Seton . . . for no less than\r\nthe amount of $153,000 . . . .\"<sup> (1)</sup>  Seton conceded the failure to file, but disputed the amount of the\r\npenalty.  Seton took the position that $10,000 per report was the maximum penalty for failure to file\r\nthe annual HEDIS report.  The State responded that it interpreted \"each act of violation\" in section\r\n108.014 of the Code to mean each day of violation.<sup> (2)</sup>  In the months following its receipt of the\r\nJohnsonius letter, Seton made a number of attempts to pay a civil penalty that it believed comported\r\nwith the statute.  In each instance, the State rejected the offer and stated that it intended to file a\r\nlawsuit to collect a penalty of no less than $153,000.  During one exchange, after rejecting Seton's\r\noffer to pay a $12,500 penalty, the Attorney General stated that \"little remains but to see how the\r\nCourts will interpret the Statute.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn March 2001, Seton filed a declaratory judgment action against the Council and the\r\nAttorney General to construe the statute pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure\r\nAct (\"the APA\") and Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (\"the UDJA\").  Tex. Gov't Code Ann.\r\n§ 2001.038 (West 2000); Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.003 (West 1997).  Seton sought\r\na declaration that $10,000 per report is the maximum civil penalty that may be assessed under the\r\nCode for failure to file the annual HEDIS report.  Seton also sought to recover its attorney's fees and\r\ncosts incurred in obtaining the requested relief.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn April 13, 2001, the Attorney General sent a letter (the \"withdrawal letter\") to\r\nSeton stating that the Johnsonius letter was \"withdrawn\" and that it \"was not intended as an\r\nassessment of civil penalties\" because that power \"is vested in our courts.\"  In July, the Council\r\ncounterclaimed against Seton, seeking to have the district court: (1) permanently enjoin Seton from\r\nviolating the Code by ordering it to submit HEDIS reports for the years 1999 and 2000 and each\r\nsubsequent year thereafter;<sup> (3)</sup> (2) order that Seton be assessed \"civil penalties not to exceed $10,000\r\nfor each act of violation for its failure to submit HEDIS data\" for 1999 and 2000; and (3) order Seton\r\nto pay the Council's costs and attorney's fees.  Seton and the State then filed cross-motions for\r\nsummary judgment.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe State argued in its motion for summary judgment that Seton's claim for\r\ndeclaratory relief was moot once the Attorney General had withdrawn the Johnsonius letter and\r\nbecause it was \"neither requesting the assessment by [the district court] of penalties in excess of\r\n$10,000 per violation, nor is there a threat to [Seton] that [the State] will do so in the future.\"  Seton\r\ncontended that the district court had jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief because, while\r\nacknowledging that \"no current controversy\" existed between itself and the State on the issue of the\r\nmaximum civil penalty for the two years in question, it still had \"reason to fear that [the Council]\r\nmay in the future attempt to assess penalties in excess of the maximum allowed by the regulation.\" \r\nFollowing a hearing and submission of briefs, the district court rendered a final declaration and\r\njudgment whereby it: (1) declared $10,000 per report to be the maximum penalty for failure to file\r\nan annual HEDIS report required by statute and the Council's rules; (2) assessed penalties against\r\nSeton of $1,000 for failure to file a 1999 report and $1,000 for failure to file a 2000 report; (3)\r\nordered the State to pay Seton $15,000 in attorney's fees for obtaining the declaratory judgment; and\r\n(4) dismissed with prejudice the Council's counterclaim, thereby denying injunctive relief.  This\r\nappeal followed.  </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>STANDARD OF REVIEW</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tSummary judgment is proper if there exists no genuine issue as to any material fact\r\nand the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c); <em>Gibbs v.\r\nGeneral Motors Inc</em>., 450 S.W.2d 827, 828 (Tex. 1970).  <span>The standards for reviewing a summary\r\njudgment are well established: (1) the movant for summary judgment has the burden of showing that\r\nno genuine issue of material fact exists and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; (2) in\r\ndeciding whether there is a disputed material fact issue precluding summary judgment, evidence\r\nfavorable to the non-movant will be taken as true; and (3) every reasonable inference must be\r\nindulged in favor of the non-movant and any doubts resolved in its favor.  <em>Nixon v. Mr</em>.<em> Prop.\r\nMngmt. Co.</em>, 690 S.W.2d 546, 548-49 (Tex. 1985).</span><span>  </span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHere, the parties asserted that there were no disputed material issues.  Because all\r\nparties filed motions for summary judgment, one of which was granted and the other denied, we\r\nmust review the summary judgment evidence presented by both sides, determine all questions\r\npresented, and render such judgment as the trial court should have rendered.<em>  See Holy Cross Church\r\nof God in Christ v. Wolf</em>, 44 S.W.3d 562, 566 (Tex. 2001); <em>Vanliner Ins. Co. v. Tex. Workers' Comp.\r\nComm'n</em>, 999 S.W.2d 575, 577 (Tex. App.--Austin 1999, no pet.) (citing <em>Commissioners Court v.\r\nAgan</em>, 940 S.W.2d 77, 81 (Tex. 1997)).</span><span>  Each party must carry its own burden as the movant and,\r\nin response to the other party's motion, as the non-movant.  <em>Gaut v. Amarillo Eco. Dev. Corp.</em>, 921\r\nS.W.2d 884, 887 (Tex. App.--Austin 1996, no writ) (citing <em>James v. Hitchcock Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>,\r\n742 S.W.2d 701, 703 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, writ denied)).  The prevailing party\r\nbears the burden of establishing that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  <em>Gaut</em>, 921 S.W.2d\r\nat 887 (citing <em>Guynes v. Galveston Co.</em>, 861 S.W.2d 861, 862 (Tex. 1993)). </span><span> </span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its final judgment, the district court held that \"there is no material fact question on\r\nany of the parties' disputes.\"  When a trial court's order granting summary judgment does not specify\r\nthe grounds relied upon, the reviewing court must affirm the summary judgment if any of the\r\nsummary judgment grounds are meritorious.  <em>FM Properties Operating Co. v. City of Austin</em>, 22\r\nS.W.3d 868, 872-73 (Tex. 2000) (citing <em>Star-Telegram, Inc. v. Doe</em>, 915 S.W.2d 471, 473 (Tex.\r\n1995)).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><em>Mootness</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its first issue, the State contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction over\r\nSeton's request for declaratory judgment because no live controversy existed at the time the court\r\nrendered a decision.  We disagree.  A declaratory judgment action may be used, among other things, \r\nto determine \"any question of construction or validity arising under\" a statute.  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp;\r\nRem. Code Ann. § 37.004(a) (West 1997); <em>see also Frasier v. Yanes</em>, 9 S.W.3d 422, 427 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Austin 1999, no pet.).  In the words of the supreme court, a declaratory judgment proceeding\r\nis \"an additional remedy and does not supplant any existing remedy, but is intended as a speedy and\r\neffective remedy for the determination of the rights of the parties when a real controversy has arisen\r\nand even before the wrong has actually been committed.\"  <em>Cobb v. Harrington</em>, 190 S.W.2d 709, 713\r\n(Tex. 1945).</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA declaratory judgment is appropriate when a justiciable controversy exists as to the\r\nrights and status of the parties and the controversy will be resolved by the declaration sought.\r\n<em>Bonham State Bank v. Beadle</em>, 907 S.W.2d 465, 467 (Tex. 1995); <em>Texas Dept. of Pub. Safety v.\r\nMoore</em>, 985 S.W.2d 149, 153 (Tex. App.--Austin 1998, no pet.).  A declaratory judgment action\r\ndoes not vest a court with the power to pass upon hypothetical or contingent situations, or to\r\ndetermine questions not then essential to the decision of an actual controversy, although such\r\nquestions may in the future require adjudication.  <em>Firemen's Ins. Co. v. Burch</em>, 442 S.W.2d 331, 333\r\n(Tex. 1968).  A controversy is considered justiciable, however, if there exists a real and substantial\r\ncontroversy involving a genuine conflict of tangible interests and not merely a theoretical dispute. \r\n<em>Beadle</em>, 907 S.W.2d at 467; <em>City of Austin v. L.S. Ranch, Ltd.</em>, 970 S.W.2d 750, 754 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Austin 1998, no pet.).  Otherwise, the judgment amounts to no more than an advisory\r\nopinion, which the district court does not have power to render.  <em>Lone Starr Multi Theatres, Inc. v.\r\nState</em>, 922 S.W.2d 295, 297 (Tex. App.--Austin 1996, no writ).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe mootness doctrine dictates that courts avoid rendering advisory opinions by only\r\ndeciding cases that present a \"live\" controversy at the time of the decision.  <em>Camarena v. Texas\r\nEmployment Comm'n</em>, 754 S.W.2d 149, 151 (Tex. 1988).  A case becomes moot when: (1) it appears\r\nthat one seeks to obtain a judgment on some controversy, when in reality none exists; or (2) when\r\none seeks a judgment on some matter which, when rendered for any reason, cannot have any\r\npractical legal effect on a then-existing controversy.  <em>Scholl v. Firemen's &amp; Policemen's Civil Serv.\r\nComm'n</em>, 520 S.W.2d 470, 471 (Tex. Civ. App.--Corpus Christi 1975, no writ) (actions requested\r\nin suit for declaratory and injunctive relief were taken so no controversy remained).  Cases may\r\nbecome moot when allegedly wrongful behavior has passed and could not be expected to recur. <em>\r\nSecurities &amp; Exch. Comm'n v. Medical Comm. for Human Rights</em>, 404 U.S. 403, 406 (1972); <em>see also\r\nReyna v. City of Weslaco</em>, 944 S.W.2d 657, 662 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1997, no writ).  \tThe State argues that the controversy between these parties became moot when the\r\nAttorney General withdrew the Johnsonius letter and conceded that the Attorney General and the\r\nCouncil lacked the power to assess civil penalties because the Johnsonius letter was \"the crux of the\r\ncontroversy between the parties in this lawsuit and the sole basis of the trial court's supposed\r\njurisdiction over Seton's request for declaratory relief.\"  According to the State, because the Attorney\r\nGeneral's admissions in the withdrawal letter constituted judicial admissions which \"conclusively\r\nended any conflict between the parties,\" the district court's declaration that section 108.014 of the\r\nCode allows for a $10,000 maximum penalty for failure to file an annual HEDIS report therefore\r\namounted to an unconstitutional advisory opinion.  <em>See National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Jones</em>,\r\n1 S.W.3d 83, 86 (Tex. 1999) (noting mootness \"prohibition is rooted in the separation of powers\r\ndoctrine in the Texas and United States Constitutions\").  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span><span><span></span><span></span></span><span>This argument fails because the State attributes too broad an effect to the statements\r\nmade by the Attorney General in the withdrawal letter.  The withdrawal letter merely stated that the\r\nJohnsonius letter \"was not intended as an assessment of civil penalties\" because that power \"is\r\nvested in our courts.\"  </span><span>When Seton sought a declaration that $10,000 is the maximum penalty for\r\nfailure to file an annual HEDIS report, it did so</span><span> with the State's implicit threat that \"little remains\r\nbut to see how the Courts will interpret the Statute.\"</span><span>  </span><span>An actual controversy remained because, to the\r\nextent that the State still intended Seton to pay a penalty, the State would have to pursue litigation. \r\nThe withdrawal letter did not concede that the State had misinterpreted section 108.014 nor did it\r\nstate that a daily penalty or other time sensitive interpretation of the statute would not be urged by\r\nthe State when it sought a civil penalty by a court.  The Johnsonius letter was withdrawn by the\r\nAttorney General several months before the Council counterclaimed, and at a time when Seton's\r\nsituation was not so hypothetical or contingent as to moot its need to obtain a declaratory judgment\r\nconstruing the statute and the rule in dispute. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tContrary to the State's contention, we cannot hold that the withdrawal letter clearly\r\nconstituted a binding judicial admission as to the interpretation of the penalty provision such that the\r\ndispute became moot.  Judicial admissions, for example an admission in the pleadings on which the\r\ncase is being tried, an agreed statement of facts in the case, or a formal declaration in court, are\r\nconclusive on the party making the admission.  By contrast, ordinary admissions may be contradicted\r\nor explained.  <em>Mendoza v. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Ins. Underwriters, Inc.</em>, 606 S.W.2d 692, 694 (Tex.\r\n1980).  Here, the withdrawal letter was not a formal statement made during the course of the judicial\r\nproceeding that would remove all dispute over the statute's interpretation from the field of\r\ncontroversy; rather, it was an ordinary or extrajudicial admission that the State could later contradict\r\nor explain.  Furthermore, the admissions made in the withdrawal letter by the Attorney General\r\nconcerned a question of law and therefore would not necessarily bind the Council or the State to any\r\nparticular interpretation of the Code, especially with respect to maximum penalties.  <em>See </em>Tex. Gov't\r\nCode § 402.004 (West 1998);<sup> (4)</sup> <em>see also State v. Keeton Packing Co.</em>, 487 S.W.2d 775, 780 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Amarillo 1972, writ ref'd n.r.e.).<sup> (5)</sup>  Thus, even after the Attorney General withdrew the\r\nJohnsonius letter, the Council could still determine that seeking a greater assessment penalty against\r\nSeton was a proper course of action.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State further contends that the Council's counterclaim conceded Seton's\r\ninterpretation of the Code, thus causing Seton's declaratory judgment claim to become moot.  The\r\ncounterclaim sought an order that Seton \"pay civil penalties not to exceed $10,000 for each act of\r\nviolation for its failure to submit HEDIS data to [the Council] for 1999 and 2000 in violation of [the\r\nCode].\"  In its motion for summary judgment, the State alleged \"the maximum is $10,000 for each\r\nact of violation\" and that it was \"neither requesting the assessment by this Court of penalties in\r\nexcess of $10,000 per violation, nor is there a threat to [Seton] that [the State] will do so in the\r\nfuture.\"  According to the State, these statements constituted judicial admissions that ended any\r\nremaining controversy over the penalty provision's interpretation.  </span><span>The allegations do not, however,\r\nassert what the State construes to be an act of violation.  Previously, the State had taken the position\r\nthat each day the report remained unfiled constituted an act of violation for which a penalty could\r\nbe assessed.  We do not view the statements made in the State's counterclaim and summary\r\njudgment motion as constituting a judicial admission so as to conclusively establish that the Attorney\r\nGeneral and the Council had misinterpreted the Code and taken wrongful action based on that\r\ninterpretation.  <em>See Starks v. Houston</em>, 448 S.W.2d 698, 699-700 (Tex. Civ. App.--Houston [1st\r\nDist.] 1969, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  The pleadings request an assessment of $10,000 per violation and the\r\nmotion says the State seeks a maximum of that amount and is not seeking a greater amount.  Read\r\ntogether, however, one could argue that this is only the maximum the State seeks in these instances. \r\nThe State does not allege an admission that the statute provides only for $10,000 maximum per\r\nfailure to file each annual report and no greater penalty can be assessed.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThus, although Seton acknowledges that the immediate controversy forming the\r\ninitial crux of its declaratory judgment action has ceased, it asserts that at the time of the district\r\ncourt's decision the threat remained that the Council could reinstate its policy of assessing an\r\nexcessive penalty based on an erroneous construction of the statute.<sup> (6)</sup>  This Court has held that under\r\nsome circumstances a party is not required to wait until an agency attempts to enforce a rule against\r\nthe party before seeking declaratory relief.  <em>See Public Util. Comm'n of Texas v. City of Austin</em>, 728\r\nS.W.2d 907, 910 (Tex. App.--Austin 1987, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (citing <em>State Bd. of Ins. v. Deffebach</em>,\r\n631 S.W.2d 794, 797 (Tex. App.--Austin 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e.)).  We believe a similar approach\r\napplies here. </span><span> Despite the State's voluntary abandonment of its effort to collect a $153,000 penalty,\r\nthe record shows that throughout the pendency of the case, the Council never took any extrajudicial\r\naction to abandon its earlier construction of the statute.  </span><span>Nor does the record establish that a complete\r\nresolution has been reached between Seton and the Council regarding the maximum civil penalties. \r\n<em>See Texas Educ. Agency v. Leeper</em>, 893 S.W.2d 432, 441 (Tex. 1994) (holding case not moot where\r\nevidence does not adequately show plaintiffs and defendants agree on when home schooled children\r\nare exempt from compulsory attendance law).</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis Court dealt with a similar situation in <em>Del Valle Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Lopez</em>, 863\r\nS.W.2d 507 (Tex. App.--Austin 1993, writ denied).  There, we held that the appellees' declaratory\r\njudgment action was not moot even though the appellant voluntarily abandoned an at-large electoral\r\nsystem after the appellees challenged its constitutionality.  <em>Id.</em> at 511.  We stated:  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>Without a declaration by the court or an admission by Del Valle that the at-large\r\nsystem was unconstitutional, Del Valle was free to return to the at-large system.\r\nTherefore, because Del Valle refused to admit that the at-large system was\r\nunconstitutional, a declaration by the court that the system was unconstitutional was\r\nessential to Appellees' purpose: the elimination of the at-large system and the\r\nsubstitution of a single-member system. </span><span></span><span> <br>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span><em>Id. </em></span><span></span><span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span><span> </span><span>We conclude that the district court had jurisdiction to issue the declaratory judgment because the\r\ncontroversy was not moot and construction of the statute is a question of law.  As in <em>Del Valle</em>, the\r\nchallenged action is a stance on a question of law that has been voluntarily abandoned without any\r\nbinding admission or extrajudicial action that would prevent a recurrence of the challenged action. \r\n<em>See Del Valle Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 863 S.W.2d at 511; <em>see also </em></span><span><em>Reyna</em>, 944 S.W.2d at 662.</span><span>  </span><span>The\r\njudgment declared that $10,000 is the maximum penalty that may be imposed under the statute or\r\nagency rule for failure to file a HEDIS report.  The State had not expressly admitted this.  Thus, we\r\ncannot say that the district court's construction of the statute</span><span> had no practical effect or that it\r\namounted to no more than an advisory opinion on a question that \"would be purely academic\" so that\r\n\"we would have had a considerable amount of judicial wheel spinning for nothing.\"  </span><span><em>Firemen's Ins.</em></span><span>,\r\n442 S.W.2d at 333.  And because neither the withdrawal letter by the Attorney General, the\r\nCouncil's counterclaim, nor the State's summary judgment motion effectively prevented the Council\r\nfrom threatening Seton with an excessive penalty in the future, we hold that the district court did not\r\nerr in issuing the declaratory judgment.<sup> (7)</sup> </span><span><span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em></em></strong></span><span><strong><em>Sovereign Immunity <span></span></em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State alternatively contends that Seton's declaratory judgment action is barred </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>by sovereign immunity.  According to the State, because neither the APA nor the UDJA by their\r\nexpress terms waives the sovereign immunity of the State and its agencies, Seton is prohibited from\r\nbringing a cause of action against the Council or the Attorney General.  We disagree.  State agencies\r\nenjoy immunity from suit under the doctrine of sovereign immunity.  <em>See Texas S. Univ. v. Federal\r\nSign</em>, 951 S.W.2d 401, 405 (Tex. 1997).  However, the UDJA waives this immunity when a party\r\nseeks a court's construction of a statute or rule.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccording to the Supreme Court:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>The DJA expressly provides that persons may challenge ordinances or statutes, and\r\nthat governmental entities must be joined or notified. Governmental entities joined\r\nas parties may be bound by a court's declaration on their ordinances or statutes. The\r\nAct thus contemplates that governmental entities may be--indeed, must be--joined\r\nin suits to construe their legislative pronouncements. These provisions provide the\r\ncontext for the Act's authorization, in § 37.009, of attorney fee awards. We conclude\r\nthat by authorizing declaratory judgment actions to construe the legislative\r\nenactments of governmental entities and authorizing awards of attorney fees, the DJA\r\nnecessarily waives governmental immunity for such awards. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Leeper</em>, 893 S.W.2d at 446; <em>see also City of LaPorte v. Barfield</em>, 898 S.W.2d 288, 297 (Tex. 1995);\r\n<em>Texas Workers' Comp. Comm'n v. Texas Builders Ins. Co.</em>, 994 S.W.2d 902, 909 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Austin 1999, pet. denied).  Seton's action sought </span><span>a declaration that $10,000 per report is the\r\nmaximum civil penalty that may be assessed under the Code for failure to file a HEDIS annual\r\nreport.  Seton also sought to recover its attorney's fees and costs incurred in obtaining the requested\r\nrelief.  In any event, the Council counterclaimed against Seton for assessment of penalties under\r\nsection 108.014(b) of the Code.  In the course of that proceeding, Seton was entitled to seek the\r\ncourt's interpretation of the statute in question.  Because Seton seeks </span><span>construction of a statute, we\r\noverrule the State's first issue.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em></em></strong></span><span><strong><em>Abuse of Discretion</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its third issue, the State contends the district court erred in assessing against Seton\r\nonly the minimum penalty of $1,000 for failure to file each of the 1999 and 2000 reports.  The State\r\nargues that the district court abused its discretion because \"Seton's violation was willfully and\r\nknowingly in contravention of the statute and agency rules . . . .\"  A trial court abuses its discretion\r\nwhen it acts in an unreasonable and arbitrary manner, or without reference to any guiding rules or\r\nprinciples.  <em>Downer v. Aquamarine Operators</em>, <em>Inc.</em>, 701 S.W.2d 238, 241-42 (Tex. 1985).  This\r\nCourt may not reverse for abuse of discretion merely because we disagree with the decision of the\r\ntrial court.  <em>Id.</em>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccording to the State, the district court penalized Seton's \"flagrant violation of the\r\nmandatory reporting requirements\" with no more than a \"mere slap on the hand,\" therefore defeating\r\nthe \"well-settled\" principle that civil penalties are imposed as punishment rather than compensation\r\nto the injured party.  In support of this proposition that the State characterizes as \"well-established,\"\r\nwe are directed to <em>Whorton v. Nevitt</em>, 42 S.W.2d 1056, 1057 (Tex. Civ. App.--Waco 1931, no writ.)\r\n(\"The term [penalty] involves the idea of punishment.\").  We do not find this case to be particularly\r\ninstructive; it involved only the question of whether an action to recover double the amount of\r\nusurious interest was an action for a debt or for a penalty.  <em>See id.  </em>It does not provide a rule or\r\nprinciple by which the district court was to be guided in assessing a penalty against Seton.  Nor does\r\nsection 108.014, by its terms, provide any guidance.  It merely provides that a court is not to assess\r\nless than $1,000 or more than $10,000 per filing violation.  The court has discretion to assess a\r\npenalty within the prescribed range of punishment.  It did so.  We are unwilling to say that the\r\ndistrict court abused its discretion in assessing an amount within the range prescribed by the\r\nlegislature.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFurthermore, the State's reliance on Seton's alleged willful and intentional violation\r\nis misplaced.  Section 108.014(b) does not explicitly ascribe any culpable mental state as a factor to\r\nbe considered by the court in assessing the penalty.  However, the preceding provision does.  Section\r\n108.014(a) states: \"A person who knowingly or negligently releases data in violation of this chapter\r\nis liable for a civil penalty of not more than $10,000.\"  Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. § 108.014(a). \r\nIf the legislature intended a more severe punishment for a willful and knowing failure to supply the\r\ndata in section 108.014(b), as the State suggests, it could expressly provide for that as it did in section\r\n108.014(a).  Thus, the district court need not base the assessment of a penalty on the willful intent\r\nwith which Seton violated the Code.  Rather, as Seton suggests, the district court may have been\r\ninfluenced by the State's earlier demand for an excessive penalty and by its refusal to accept Seton's\r\nrepeated offers to tender a statutory penalty.  The record does not reflect that the district court clearly\r\nabused its discretion.  We overrule the State's third issue.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>Permanent Injunction</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State contends in its second issue that the district court erred by denying the\r\nState's request for a permanent injunction in addition to civil penalties because the summary\r\njudgment evidence entitles it to judgment as a matter of law.  The State sought summary judgment\r\nto permanently enjoin Seton from violating the Code by ordering it to submit HEDIS reports for the\r\nyears 1999 and 2000 and each subsequent year thereafter.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe grant or refusal of a permanent injunction is ordinarily within the trial court's\r\nsound discretion.  On appeal, review of the trial court's decision is limited to the question of whether\r\nthe court's refusal to grant injunctive relief constituted a clear abuse of discretion.  <em>South Texas\r\nCollege of Law v. Texas Higher Educ. Coordinating Bd.</em>,<em> </em>40 S.W.3d 130, 139 (Tex. App.--Austin\r\n2000, pet. denied); <em>Risk Managers Int'l, Inc. v. State</em>, 858 S.W.2d 567, 568-70 (Tex. App.--Austin\r\n1993, writ denied); <em>Priest v. Texas Animal Health Comm'n</em>, 780 S.W.2d 874, 875 (Tex. App.--Dallas\r\n1989, no writ).  In this case, the standard of review becomes somewhat more complex because the\r\nState's request for injunctive relief was dismissed with prejudice pursuant to the district court's grant\r\nof Seton's cross motion for summary judgment and denial of the State's summary judgment motion. \r\n<em>See Jim Rutherford Invs., Inc. v. Terramar Beach Cmty. Ass'n</em>, 25 S.W.3d 845, 848 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet. denied).  With the standards of review for injunctive relief and\r\nfor summary judgment in mind, we must consider all the summary judgment evidence to determine\r\nwhether the trial court clearly abused its discretion by denying the permanent injunction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn appeal, the State argues that the only question before this Court is whether the \r\nState established its right to injunctive relief.  It contends that it did so because the APA expressly\r\nprovides that a state agency may request the Attorney General to seek injunctive relief when it appears\r\nthat a person is violating, failing, or refusing to comply with an agency rule.  The State cites section\r\n2001.202 of the Texas Government Code, which provides:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><span>The attorney general, on the request of a state agency to which it appears that a\r\nperson is violating, about to violate, or failing or refusing to comply with a final\r\norder or decision or an agency rule, may bring an action in a district court\r\nauthorized to exercise judicial review of the final order or decision or the rule\r\nto:</span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <ul>\r\n    <li><span>enjoin or restrain the continuation or commencement of the violation; or</span></li>\r\n    <li><span>compel compliance with the final order or decision or the rule.</span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  </ul>\r\n  <li><span>The action authorized by this section is in addition to any other remedy provided\r\nby law.</span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br></ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.202 (West 2000).  The State argues that because the legislature did\r\nnot explicitly limit the relief in chapter 108 of the Code to civil penalties, this Court \"should assume\r\nthat the legislature intended section 2001.202 to be applicable to proceedings under the Act.\" Seton\r\nargued in its response to the State's summary judgment motion that because the legislature provided\r\na remedy in the form of a civil penalty and did not provide for injunctive relief in the Code, the civil\r\npenalty provided in section 108.014 constitutes an exclusive remedy for its failure to file. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe have not located a reported case that applies section 2001.202 of the APA to a\r\nsituation where violation of the underlying regulatory statute expressly provides a civil penalty.  It\r\nhas been specifically determined that a \"person who fails to supply available data under Sections\r\n108.009 and 108.010 is liable for a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 or more than $10,000 for\r\neach act of violation.\"  Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code § 108.014(b).<sup> (8)</sup>  Nowhere does the Code expressly\r\ngrant the State authority to seek injunctive relief.  Arguably, we may presume that the failure to\r\nprovide for injunctive relief in the Code reflects a legislative purpose.  <em>See City of Austin v. Quick</em>,\r\n930 S.W.2d 678, 687 (Tex. App.--Austin 1996), <em>aff'd</em>, 7 S.W.3d 109 (Tex. 1999).  We cannot say\r\nthat the punishment provided, without the added remedy of an injunction, completely frustrates\r\nlegislative intent.  These concerns should be properly addressed to the legislative branch.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAssuming the remedies are cumulative, however, the issue remains whether the State\r\nshowed it was entitled to the additional relief as a matter of law so that by failing to order this relief\r\nthe trial court clearly abused its discretion.  The State does not suggest that section 2001.202 was\r\nmeant to supplant the traditional elements of proof necessary to obtain injunctive relief; therefore,\r\neven if section 2001.202 allows for a permanent injunction in this case, we cannot say that the State\r\nestablished as a matter of law its entitlement to a permanent injunction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOrdinarily, a party requesting injunctive relief must show the existence of a wrongful\r\nact, the existence of imminent harm; the existence of irreparable injury; and the absence of an\r\nadequate remedy at law.  <em>Jim Rutherford Inv.</em>, 25 S.W.3d at 849; <em>Priest</em>, 780 S.W.2d at 874. \r\nGenerally, the purpose of injunctive relief is to halt wrongful acts that are threatened or in the course\r\nof accomplishment, rather than to grant relief against past actionable wrongs or to prevent the\r\ncommission of wrongs not imminently threatened.  <em>Texas Employment Comm'n v. Martinez</em>, 545\r\nS.W.2d 876, 877 (Tex. Civ. App.--El Paso 1976, no writ).  In support of its motion for summary\r\njudgment, the State submitted several affidavits, including one by the executive director of the\r\nCouncil, which showed that Seton was required to file an annual HEDIS report with the Council but\r\nfailed to meet the reporting deadlines in 1999 and 2000, and offering  estimated costs associated with\r\ncompiling the report ranging from a low of $62,666 to a high of $700,000.  In its response, Seton did\r\nnot dispute these facts; rather, Seton argued in part that this evidence failed to prove irreparable harm\r\nto the State and failed to prove that the civil penalty did not constitute an adequate remedy at law. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn appeal, the State makes the same arguments.  In effect, the State contends that\r\nbecause both forms of relief are authorized and may be ordered, the trial court clearly abused its\r\ndiscretion by not ordering them both.  It relies primarily upon the argument that it costs less for Seton\r\nto pay the penalty than to file the report, thus additional punishment is justified.  Even assuming the\r\nState's proof of possible comparative costs may be true, that does not prove the State must be\r\ngranted injunctive relief or conclusively prove that the court had no discretion to refuse injunctive\r\nrelief.  The district court assessed a civil penalty against Seton as provided by statute for its failure\r\nto file HEDIS reports in 1999 and 2000.  The penalty was within the range authorized by statute. \r\nUnderstandably, the State disagreed with the amount and wanted the additional relief it requested. \r\nHowever, we cannot say that the State has shown that the civil penalty ordered does not provide an\r\nadequate remedy at law or is inconsistent with legislative intent.\tOnly where the summary judgment evidence is such that it demonstrates that the\r\ndenial of relief would be a clear abuse of discretion may a permanent mandatory injunction be\r\nentered in response to a summary judgment motion.  Moreover, \"an injunction will not lie to prevent\r\nan alleged threatened act, the commission of which is speculative and the injury from which is purely\r\nconjectural.\"  <em>Markel v. World Flight, Inc.</em>, 938 S.W.2d 74, 80 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1996, no\r\nwrit).  Summary judgment proof merely suggesting that Seton <em>may</em> year after year deliberately refuse\r\nto file the report and instead pay the fine because of a cost-benefit analysis does not constitute\r\nimminent harm, nor is it enough to prove as a matter of law that the State has suffered irreparable\r\ninjury.  Rather, the State's proof only shows that, except for Seton, all of the other HMOs filed\r\nHEDIS reports <em>despite</em> the costs and deadlines.  Furthermore, given that the State can seek an\r\nassessment of a statutory penalty for Seton's possible future violations, we cannot say that the State\r\nhas an inadequate legal remedy.  The State's summary judgment evidence thus fails to prove that its\r\nright to the extraordinary remedy of a permanent mandatory injunction is so clear and compelling\r\nas to constitute an abuse of discretion on the part of the district court.  We hold that the State failed\r\nto establish as a matter of law its entitlement to a permanent injunction, and therefore overrule the\r\nState's second issue.  </span><span><strong><em><span></span></em></strong></span><span><strong><em><span></span></em></strong></span><span><strong><em><span></span><span></span></em></strong></span><span><strong><em></em></strong></span><span><strong><em><span></span></em></strong></span><span><strong><em></em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>State's Attorney's Fees</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its final issue, the State contends that the district court erred in failing to award its\r\nattorney's fees under the government code, section 402.006(c), which states: \"In a case in which the\r\nstate is entitled to recover a penalty or damages the attorney general is entitled, on behalf of the state,\r\nto reasonable attorney's fees and court costs.\"  Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 402.006(c) (West 1998). \r\nTo pursue civil penalties under the Code, the State must institute legal action.  Here, the State sought\r\nan assessment of the civil penalty against Seton by way of counterclaim, which the trial court\r\ndismissed with prejudice.  Nevertheless, the district court assessed Seton $1,000 for failure to file\r\neach of the 1999 and 2000 reports.  </span><span>Looking at the plain language of the statute, we believe that the\r\nlegislature provided for the recovery of attorney's fees any time the State recovers a penalty or tort\r\ndamages, and we have so held. <em> See State v. Triax Oil &amp; Gas</em>, <em>Inc.</em>, 966 S.W.2d 123, 127 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Austin 1998, no pet.) (awarding attorney's fees under section 402.006 where State recovered\r\ncivil penalty); <em>see also Merchants Fast Motor Lines</em>, <em>Inc.</em> v. <em>State</em>, 917 S.W.2d 518, 524 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Waco 1996, writ denied) (awarding attorney's fees under section 402.006 where State\r\nrecovered tort damages).<em> </em> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSeton argues that, despite the clear directive of section 402.006, the State should be\r\nprecluded from an award of attorney's fees because in this instance the \"uncontroverted summary\r\njudgment evidence conclusively established that suit was not necessary to recover a civil penalty.\" \r\nAlthough this may be true, this contention is not dispositive because Seton offers no legal grounds\r\nas its support.  An appellee's brief must conform to the requirements of rule 38.1 of the Texas Rules\r\nof Appellate Procedure, including rule 38.1(h).  Tex. R. App. P. 38.2(a)(1); 38.1(h).  Seton also\r\nsuggests that the district court could not award reasonable attorney's fees because the State's\r\nsummary judgment evidence did not segregate the amount spent exclusively in seeking the civil\r\npenalty.  We reject this argument on the grounds that section 402.006 and the cases interpreting it\r\ndo not require this segregation.  The State recovered a civil penalty from Seton and, by statute, is\r\nentitled to attorney's fees. </span><span> Because the record does not make clear to this Court the basis for the\r\ndistrict court's failure to award attorney's fees to the State, the issue is remanded to the district court\r\nfor the limited purpose of considering the State's request for reasonable attorney's fees and court\r\ncosts under section 402.006 of the government code.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe hold the district court did not err in granting Seton's declaratory judgment claim </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>and in denying the State's request for injunctive relief.  We also hold that the district court did not \r\nabuse its discretion in assessing the minimum statutory penalty against Seton for its failure to file\r\nthe HEDIS reports but that the district court did err in not properly considering attorney's fees for\r\nthe State's recovery of the penalty under section 402.006 of the government code.  Accordingly, we\r\naffirm the district court's declaration that $10,000 is the maximum penalty allowed for failure to file\r\nan annual HEDIS report; we affirm the portion of the judgment granting Seton's summary judgment\r\nand dismissing the State's permanent injunction counterclaim; we affirm the assessment of $1,000\r\nagainst Seton for each unfiled HEDIS report; we remand the issue of the State's entitlement to\r\nreasonable attorney's fees to the district court for consideration of same in accordance with this\r\nopinion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t__________________________________________</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMarilyn Aboussie, Chief Justice </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Before Chief Justice Aboussie, Justices Patterson and Puryear</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>    Opinion by Chief Justice Aboussie; Justice Patterson concurs</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>    Dissenting Opinion by Justice Puryear</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Affirmed in Part; Reversed and Remanded in Part</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Filed:   December 19, 2002</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Publish<span>\r\n<p>1.   According to the Code, the \"attorney general, at the request of the council, shall enforce\r\nthis chapter.\"  Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. § 108.014(c) (West 2001).  Also, a \"civil penalty\r\nrecovered in a suit instituted by the attorney general under this chapter shall be deposited in the\r\ngeneral revenue fund to the credit of the health care information account.\"  <em>Id</em>. § 108.014(d).  \r\n</p><p>2.   Kay Johnsonius, Assistant Attorney General, told counsel for Seton that the State had\r\ncalculated the penalty by determining that Seton's 1999 report was 153 days late, which, at $1,000\r\nper day, amounted to a $153,000 civil penalty. \r\n</p><p>3.   Seton's 2000 HEDIS data was due to be filed with the Council on June 15, 2001; it was\r\noverdue by the date the Council filed its counterclaim.\r\n</p><p>4.   Section 402.004 provides that \"an admission, agreement, or waiver made by the attorney\r\ngeneral in an action or suit to which the state is a party does not prejudice the rights of the state.\" \r\nTex. Gov't Code Ann. § 402.004 (West 1998).\r\n</p><p>5.   In <em>State v. Keeton Packing Co.</em>, 487 S.W.2d 775, 780 (Tex. Civ. App.--Amarillo 1972,\r\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.), the court applied the predecessor of section 402.004 of the Government Code.  The\r\ncourt held that any admission in a letter by the Attorney General, to the effect that the State Highway\r\nCommission had no further need for the excess land and that it was his opinion that consideration\r\nfor the deed had failed, was not binding on the State: \"Whether or not land is further needed by the\r\nState Highway Commission is left for the determination of that body and is not within the\r\ndiscretionary powers of the attorney general.\"  <em>Id.  </em>The Attorney General argues that because it is a\r\nparty to the litigation, its admissions bind the parties.  But the admission of one co-defendant does\r\nnot bind another co-defendant.\r\n</p><p>6.   In its response and cross motion for summary judgment, Seton admitted that the\r\ncontroversy giving rise to its declaratory judgment action had ended: \"Plaintiff acknowledges that\r\nno current controversy exists between itself and the State on the issue of the maximum civil penalty\r\nfor 1999 and 2000 . . . .\"  Seton argues, however, that it fears the Council will \"in the future attempt\r\nto assess penalties in excess of the maximum allowed by the regulation\" because the Council\r\n\"remains free to interpret the statute differently and to seek penalties of more than $10,000 in the\r\nfuture.\"\r\n</p><p>7.   In a sub-issue, the State contends that the district court abused its discretion in awarding\r\nattorney's fees to Seton when it lacked the power to grant declaratory relief.  Because we hold that\r\nthe district court had that power, we need not address this argument.\r\n</p><p>8.   The agency rule provides that \"[f]ailure to timely report verified HEDIS data is punishable\r\nby a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 nor more than $10,000 for each violation as set forth in\r\nHealth and Safety Code, § 108.014.\"  25 Tex.

In four issues, the State contends the district court's judgment must be reversed\r\nbecause: (1) Seton's action for declaratory judgment was moot or alternatively Seton's request for\r\ndeclaratory judgment was barred by sovereign immunity; (2) the State was entitled to injunctive\r\nrelief in addition to the assessment of a civil penalty against Seton; (3) the court's assessment of the\r\nminimum penalty constituted an abuse of discretion; and (4) the failure to award the State reasonable\r\nattorney's fees and costs constituted an abuse of discretion.  We will affirm in part and reverse and\r\nremand in part.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tSeton is a licensed health maintenance organization (\"HMO\") providing health\r\nbenefits plans, claims administration, and claims payment for member groups throughout central\r\nTexas.  Under Chapter 108 of the Texas Health and Safety Code (\"the Code\"), Seton must file a\r\nverified annual Health Plan Employer Data Information Set (\"HEDIS\") report with the Council.  <em>See\r\n</em>Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code §§ 108.009, .010 (West 2001); <em>see also </em>25 Tex. Admin. Code § 1301.33\r\n(West 2002) (Texas Health Care Information Council, Health Care Information).  The HEDIS report\r\nmust include data on the number of members served by the HMO, the demographics of the services\r\nprovided, aggregate claims information, and related information for the specified reporting period. \r\nThe Code provides for a civil penalty for failure to file an annual HEDIS report: \"A person who fails\r\nto supply available data under Sections 108.009 and 108.010 is liable for a civil penalty of not less\r\nthan $1,000 or more than $10,000 for each act of violation.\"  Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code\r\n§ 108.014(b).  Seton's 1999 report was due to be filed with the Council by June 15, 2000.  Seton did\r\nnot file its report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn January 10, 2001, Seton was notified by a letter from the Attorney General (the\r\n\"Johnsonius letter\") that it had failed to file the 1999 HEDIS report and that \"demand is hereby made\r\nfor the amount of $153,000 in civil penalties.\"  The letter also stated that if Seton did not make the\r\npayment to the Council, the Attorney General \"will file a lawsuit against Seton . . . for no less than\r\nthe amount of $153,000 . . . .\"<sup> (1)</sup>  Seton conceded the failure to file, but disputed the amount of the\r\npenalty.  Seton took the position that $10,000 per report was the maximum penalty for failure to file\r\nthe annual HEDIS report.  The State responded that it interpreted \"each act of violation\" in section\r\n108.014 of the Code to mean each day of violation.<sup> (2)</sup>  In the months following its receipt of the\r\nJohnsonius letter, Seton made a number of attempts to pay a civil penalty that it believed comported\r\nwith the statute.  In each instance, the State rejected the offer and stated that it intended to file a\r\nlawsuit to collect a penalty of no less than $153,000.  During one exchange, after rejecting Seton's\r\noffer to pay a $12,500 penalty, the Attorney General stated that \"little remains but to see how the\r\nCourts will interpret the Statute.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn March 2001, Seton filed a declaratory judgment action against the Council and the\r\nAttorney General to construe the statute pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure\r\nAct (\"the APA\") and Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (\"the UDJA\").  Tex. Gov't Code Ann.\r\n§ 2001.038 (West 2000); Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.003 (West 1997).  Seton sought\r\na declaration that $10,000 per report is the maximum civil penalty that may be assessed under the\r\nCode for failure to file the annual HEDIS report.  Seton also sought to recover its attorney's fees and\r\ncosts incurred in obtaining the requested relief.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn April 13, 2001, the Attorney General sent a letter (the \"withdrawal letter\") to\r\nSeton stating that the Johnsonius letter was \"withdrawn\" and that it \"was not intended as an\r\nassessment of civil penalties\" because that power \"is vested in our courts.\"  In July, the Council\r\ncounterclaimed against Seton, seeking to have the district court: (1) permanently enjoin Seton from\r\nviolating the Code by ordering it to submit HEDIS reports for the years 1999 and 2000 and each\r\nsubsequent year thereafter;<sup> (3)</sup> (2) order that Seton be assessed \"civil penalties not to exceed $10,000\r\nfor each act of violation for its failure to submit HEDIS data\" for 1999 and 2000; and (3) order Seton\r\nto pay the Council's costs and attorney's fees.  Seton and the State then filed cross-motions for\r\nsummary judgment.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe State argued in its motion for summary judgment that Seton's claim for\r\ndeclaratory relief was moot once the Attorney General had withdrawn the Johnsonius letter and\r\nbecause it was \"neither requesting the assessment by [the district court] of penalties in excess of\r\n$10,000 per violation, nor is there a threat to [Seton] that [the State] will do so in the future.\"  Seton\r\ncontended that the district court had jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief because, while\r\nacknowledging that \"no current controversy\" existed between itself and the State on the issue of the\r\nmaximum civil penalty for the two years in question, it still had \"reason to fear that [the Council]\r\nmay in the future attempt to assess penalties in excess of the maximum allowed by the regulation.\" \r\nFollowing a hearing and submission of briefs, the district court rendered a final declaration and\r\njudgment whereby it: (1) declared $10,000 per report to be the maximum penalty for failure to file\r\nan annual HEDIS report required by statute and the Council's rules; (2) assessed penalties against\r\nSeton of $1,000 for failure to file a 1999 report and $1,000 for failure to file a 2000 report; (3)\r\nordered the State to pay Seton $15,000 in attorney's fees for obtaining the declaratory judgment; and\r\n(4) dismissed with prejudice the Council's counterclaim, thereby denying injunctive relief.  This\r\nappeal followed.  </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>STANDARD OF REVIEW</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tSummary judgment is proper if there exists no genuine issue as to any material fact\r\nand the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

A declaratory judgment action\r\ndoes not vest a court with the power to pass upon hypothetical or contingent situations, or to\r\ndetermine questions not then essential to the decision of an actual controversy, although such\r\nquestions may in the future require adjudication.  <em>Firemen's Ins.

App.--Corpus Christi 1997, no writ).  \tThe State argues that the controversy between these parties became moot when the\r\nAttorney General withdrew the Johnsonius letter and conceded that the Attorney General and the\r\nCouncil lacked the power to assess civil penalties because the Johnsonius letter was \"the crux of the\r\ncontroversy between the parties in this lawsuit and the sole basis of the trial court's supposed\r\njurisdiction over Seton's request for declaratory relief.\"  According to the State, because the Attorney\r\nGeneral's admissions in the withdrawal letter constituted judicial admissions which \"conclusively\r\nended any conflict between the parties,\" the district court's declaration that section 108.014 of the\r\nCode allows for a $10,000 maximum penalty for failure to file an annual HEDIS report therefore\r\namounted to an unconstitutional advisory opinion.  <em>See National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Jones</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1788876\"><a href=\"/opinion/1788876/national-collegiate-athletic-assn-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 86 (Tex. 1999) (noting mootness \"prohibition is rooted in the separation of powers\r\ndoctrine in the Texas and United States Constitutions\").  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span><span><span></span><span></span></span><span>This argument fails because the State attributes too broad an effect to the statements\r\nmade by the Attorney General in the withdrawal letter.  The withdrawal letter merely stated that the\r\nJohnsonius letter \"was not intended as an assessment of civil penalties\" because that power \"is\r\nvested in our courts.\"  </span><span>When Seton sought a declaration that $10,000 is the maximum penalty for\r\nfailure to file an annual HEDIS report, it did so</span><span> with the State's implicit threat that \"little remains\r\nbut to see how the Courts will interpret the Statute.\"</span><span>  </span><span>An actual controversy remained because, to the\r\nextent that the State still intended Seton to pay a penalty, the State would have to pursue litigation. \r\nThe withdrawal letter did not concede that the State had misinterpreted section 108.014 nor did it\r\nstate that a daily penalty or other time sensitive interpretation of the statute would not be urged by\r\nthe State when it sought a civil penalty by a court.  The Johnsonius letter was withdrawn by the\r\nAttorney General several months before the Council counterclaimed, and at a time when Seton's\r\nsituation was not so hypothetical or contingent as to moot its need to obtain a declaratory judgment\r\nconstruing the statute and the rule in dispute. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tContrary to the State's contention, we cannot hold that the withdrawal letter clearly\r\nconstituted a binding judicial admission as to the interpretation of the penalty provision such that the\r\ndispute became moot.  Judicial admissions, for example an admission in the pleadings on which the\r\ncase is being tried, an agreed statement of facts in the case, or a formal declaration in court, are\r\nconclusive on the party making the admission.  By contrast, ordinary admissions may be contradicted\r\nor explained.  <em>Mendoza v. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Ins. Underwriters, Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1732261\"><a href=\"/opinion/1732261/mendoza-v-fidelity-guar-ins-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></a></span>, 694 (Tex.\r\n1980).  Here, the withdrawal letter was not a formal statement made during the course of the judicial\r\nproceeding that would remove all dispute over the statute's interpretation from the field of\r\ncontroversy; rather, it was an ordinary or extrajudicial admission that the State could later contradict\r\nor explain.  Furthermore, the admissions made in the withdrawal letter by the Attorney General\r\nconcerned a question of law and therefore would not necessarily bind the Council or the State to any\r\nparticular interpretation of the Code, especially with respect to maximum penalties.  <em>See </em>Tex. Gov't\r\nCode § 402.004 (West 1998);<sup> (4)</sup> <em>see also State v. Keeton Packing Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1713040\"><a href=\"/opinion/1713040/state-v-keeton-packing-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>, 780 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Amarillo 1972, writ ref'd n.r.e.).<sup> (5)</sup>  Thus, even after the Attorney General withdrew the\r\nJohnsonius letter, the Council could still determine that seeking a greater assessment penalty against\r\nSeton was a proper course of action.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State further contends that the Council's counterclaim conceded Seton's\r\ninterpretation of the Code, thus causing Seton's declaratory judgment claim to become moot.  The\r\ncounterclaim sought an order that Seton \"pay civil penalties not to exceed $10,000 for each act of\r\nviolation for its failure to submit HEDIS data to [the Council] for 1999 and 2000 in violation of [the\r\nCode].\"  In its motion for summary judgment, the State alleged \"the maximum is $10,000 for each\r\nact of violation\" and that it was \"neither requesting the assessment by this Court of penalties in\r\nexcess of $10,000 per violation, nor is there a threat to [Seton] that [the State] will do so in the\r\nfuture.\"  According to the State, these statements constituted judicial admissions that ended any\r\nremaining controversy over the penalty provision's interpretation.  </span><span>The allegations do not, however,\r\nassert what the State construes to be an act of violation.  Previously, the State had taken the position\r\nthat each day the report remained unfiled constituted an act of violation for which a penalty could\r\nbe assessed.  We do not view the statements made in the State's counterclaim and summary\r\njudgment motion as constituting a judicial admission so as to conclusively establish that the Attorney\r\nGeneral and the Council had misinterpreted the Code and taken wrongful action based on that\r\ninterpretation.  <em>See Starks v. Houston</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1779431\"><a href=\"/opinion/1779431/starks-v-city-of-houston/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 699-700 (Tex. Civ. App.--Houston [1st\r\nDist.] 1969, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  The pleadings request an assessment of $10,000 per violation and the\r\nmotion says the State seeks a maximum of that amount and is not seeking a greater amount.  Read\r\ntogether, however, one could argue that this is only the maximum the State seeks in these instances. \r\nThe State does not allege an admission that the statute provides only for $10,000 maximum per\r\nfailure to file each annual report and no greater penalty can be assessed.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThus, although Seton acknowledges that the immediate controversy forming the\r\ninitial crux of its declaratory judgment action has ceased, it asserts that at the time of the district\r\ncourt's decision the threat remained that the Council could reinstate its policy of assessing an\r\nexcessive penalty based on an erroneous construction of the statute.<sup> (6)</sup>  This Court has held that under\r\nsome circumstances a party is not required to wait until an agency attempts to enforce a rule against\r\nthe party before seeking declaratory relief.  <em>See Public Util.

According to the State, because neither the APA nor the UDJA by their\r\nexpress terms waives the sovereign immunity of the State and its agencies, Seton is prohibited from\r\nbringing a cause of action against the Council or the Attorney General.

Seton's action sought </span><span>a declaration that $10,000 per report is the\r\nmaximum civil penalty that may be assessed under the Code for failure to file a HEDIS annual\r\nreport.  Seton also sought to recover its attorney's fees and costs incurred in obtaining the requested\r\nrelief.  In any event, the Council counterclaimed against Seton for assessment of penalties under\r\nsection 108.014(b) of the Code.  In the course of that proceeding, Seton was entitled to seek the\r\ncourt's interpretation of the statute in question.  Because Seton seeks </span><span>construction of a statute, we\r\noverrule the State's first issue.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em></em></strong></span><span><strong><em>Abuse of Discretion</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its third issue, the State contends the district court erred in assessing against Seton\r\nonly the minimum penalty of $1,000 for failure to file each of the 1999 and 2000 reports.  The State\r\nargues that the district court abused its discretion because \"Seton's violation was willfully and\r\nknowingly in contravention of the statute and agency rules . . . .\"  A trial court abuses its discretion\r\nwhen it acts in an unreasonable and arbitrary manner, or without reference to any guiding rules or\r\nprinciples.  <em>Downer v. Aquamarine Operators</em>, <em>Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2436853\"><a href=\"/opinion/2436853/downer-v-aquamarine-operators-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">701</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, 241-42 (Tex. 1985).  This\r\nCourt may not reverse for abuse of discretion merely because we disagree with the decision of the\r\ntrial court.  <em>Id.</em>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccording to the State, the district court penalized Seton's \"flagrant violation of the\r\nmandatory reporting requirements\" with no more than a \"mere slap on the hand,\" therefore defeating\r\nthe \"well-settled\" principle that civil penalties are imposed as punishment rather than compensation\r\nto the injured party.  In support of this proposition that the State characterizes as \"well-established,\"\r\nwe are directed to <em>Whorton v. Nevitt</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1056</span></span>, 1057 (Tex. Civ. App.--Waco 1931, no writ.)\r\n(\"The term [penalty] involves the idea of punishment.\").  We do not find this case to be particularly\r\ninstructive; it involved only the question of whether an action to recover double the amount of\r\nusurious interest was an action for a debt or for a penalty.  <em>See id.  </em>It does not provide a rule or\r\nprinciple by which the district court was to be guided in assessing a penalty against Seton.  Nor does\r\nsection 108.014, by its terms, provide any guidance.  It merely provides that a court is not to assess\r\nless than $1,000 or more than $10,000 per filing violation.  The court has discretion to assess a\r\npenalty within the prescribed range of punishment.  It did so.  We are unwilling to say that the\r\ndistrict court abused its discretion in assessing an amount within the range prescribed by the\r\nlegislature.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFurthermore, the State's reliance on Seton's alleged willful and intentional violation\r\nis misplaced.  Section 108.014(b) does not explicitly ascribe any culpable mental state as a factor to\r\nbe considered by the court in assessing the penalty.  However, the preceding provision does.  Section\r\n108.014(a) states: \"A person who knowingly or negligently releases data in violation of this chapter\r\nis liable for a civil penalty of not more than $10,000.\"  Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. § 108.014(a). \r\nIf the legislature intended a more severe punishment for a willful and knowing failure to supply the\r\ndata in section 108.014(b), as the State suggests, it could expressly provide for that as it did in section\r\n108.014(a).  Thus, the district court need not base the assessment of a penalty on the willful intent\r\nwith which Seton violated the Code.  Rather, as Seton suggests, the district court may have been\r\ninfluenced by the State's earlier demand for an excessive penalty and by its refusal to accept Seton's\r\nrepeated offers to tender a statutory penalty.  The record does not reflect that the district court clearly\r\nabused its discretion.  We overrule the State's third issue.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>Permanent Injunction</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State contends in its second issue that the district court erred by denying the\r\nState's request for a permanent injunction in addition to civil penalties because the summary\r\njudgment evidence entitles it to judgment as a matter of law.  The State sought summary judgment\r\nto permanently enjoin Seton from violating the Code by ordering it to submit HEDIS reports for the\r\nyears 1999 and 2000 and each subsequent year thereafter.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe grant or refusal of a permanent injunction is ordinarily within the trial court's\r\nsound discretion.  On appeal, review of the trial court's decision is limited to the question of whether\r\nthe court's refusal to grant injunctive relief constituted a clear abuse of discretion.  <em>South Texas\r\nCollege of Law v.

In this case, the standard of review becomes somewhat more complex because the\r\nState's request for injunctive relief was dismissed with prejudice pursuant to the district court's grant\r\nof Seton's cross motion for summary judgment and denial of the State's summary judgment motion. \r\n<em>See Jim Rutherford Invs., Inc. v.

With the standards of review for injunctive relief and\r\nfor summary judgment in mind, we must consider all the summary judgment evidence to determine\r\nwhether the trial court clearly abused its discretion by denying the permanent injunction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn appeal, the State argues that the only question before this Court is whether the \r\nState established its right to injunctive relief.  It contends that it did so because the APA expressly\r\nprovides that a state agency may request the Attorney General to seek injunctive relief when it appears\r\nthat a person is violating, failing, or refusing to comply with an agency rule.  The State cites section\r\n2001.202 of the Texas Government Code, which provides:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><span>The attorney general, on the request of a state agency to which it appears that a\r\nperson is violating, about to violate, or failing or refusing to comply with a final\r\norder or decision or an agency rule, may bring an action in a district court\r\nauthorized to exercise judicial review of the final order or decision or the rule\r\nto:</span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <ul>\r\n    <li><span>enjoin or restrain the continuation or commencement of the violation; or</span></li>\r\n    <li><span>compel compliance with the final order or decision or the rule.</span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  </ul>\r\n  <li><span>The action authorized by this section is in addition to any other remedy provided\r\nby law.</span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br></ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.202 (West 2000).  The State argues that because the legislature did\r\nnot explicitly limit the relief in chapter 108 of the Code to civil penalties, this Court \"should assume\r\nthat the legislature intended section 2001.202 to be applicable to proceedings under the Act.\" Seton\r\nargued in its response to the State's summary judgment motion that because the legislature provided\r\na remedy in the form of a civil penalty and did not provide for injunctive relief in the Code, the civil\r\npenalty provided in section 108.014 constitutes an exclusive remedy for its failure to file. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe have not located a reported case that applies section 2001.202 of the APA to a\r\nsituation where violation of the underlying regulatory statute expressly provides a civil penalty.  It\r\nhas been specifically determined that a \"person who fails to supply available data under Sections\r\n108.009 and 108.010 is liable for a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 or more than $10,000 for\r\neach act of violation.\"  Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code § 108.014(b).<sup> (8)</sup>  Nowhere does the Code expressly\r\ngrant the State authority to seek injunctive relief.  Arguably, we may presume that the failure to\r\nprovide for injunctive relief in the Code reflects a legislative purpose.  <em>See City of Austin v.

We cannot say\r\nthat the punishment provided, without the added remedy of an injunction, completely frustrates\r\nlegislative intent.  These concerns should be properly addressed to the legislative branch.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAssuming the remedies are cumulative, however, the issue remains whether the State\r\nshowed it was entitled to the additional relief as a matter of law so that by failing to order this relief\r\nthe trial court clearly abused its discretion.  The State does not suggest that section 2001.202 was\r\nmeant to supplant the traditional elements of proof necessary to obtain injunctive relief; therefore,\r\neven if section 2001.202 allows for a permanent injunction in this case, we cannot say that the State\r\nestablished as a matter of law its entitlement to a permanent injunction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOrdinarily, a party requesting injunctive relief must show the existence of a wrongful\r\nact, the existence of imminent harm; the existence of irreparable injury; and the absence of an\r\nadequate remedy at law.  <em>Jim Rutherford Inv.</em>, 25 S.W.3d at 849; <em>Priest</em>, 780 S.W.2d at 874. \r\nGenerally, the purpose of injunctive relief is to halt wrongful acts that are threatened or in the course\r\nof accomplishment, rather than to grant relief against past actionable wrongs or to prevent the\r\ncommission of wrongs not imminently threatened.  <em>Texas Employment Comm'n v. Martinez</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2408168\"><a href=\"/opinion/2408168/texas-employment-commission-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span>, 877 (Tex. Civ. App.--El Paso 1976, no writ).  In support of its motion for summary\r\njudgment, the State submitted several affidavits, including one by the executive director of the\r\nCouncil, which showed that Seton was required to file an annual HEDIS report with the Council but\r\nfailed to meet the reporting deadlines in 1999 and 2000, and offering  estimated costs associated with\r\ncompiling the report ranging from a low of $62,666 to a high of $700,000.  In its response, Seton did\r\nnot dispute these facts; rather, Seton argued in part that this evidence failed to prove irreparable harm\r\nto the State and failed to prove that the civil penalty did not constitute an adequate remedy at law. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn appeal, the State makes the same arguments.  In effect, the State contends that\r\nbecause both forms of relief are authorized and may be ordered, the trial court clearly abused its\r\ndiscretion by not ordering them both.  It relies primarily upon the argument that it costs less for Seton\r\nto pay the penalty than to file the report, thus additional punishment is justified.  Even assuming the\r\nState's proof of possible comparative costs may be true, that does not prove the State must be\r\ngranted injunctive relief or conclusively prove that the court had no discretion to refuse injunctive\r\nrelief.  The district court assessed a civil penalty against Seton as provided by statute for its failure\r\nto file HEDIS reports in 1999 and 2000.  The penalty was within the range authorized by statute. \r\nUnderstandably, the State disagreed with the amount and wanted the additional relief it requested. \r\nHowever, we cannot say that the State has shown that the civil penalty ordered does not provide an\r\nadequate remedy at law or is inconsistent with legislative intent.\tOnly where the summary judgment evidence is such that it demonstrates that the\r\ndenial of relief would be a clear abuse of discretion may a permanent mandatory injunction be\r\nentered in response to a summary judgment motion.  Moreover, \"an injunction will not lie to prevent\r\nan alleged threatened act, the commission of which is speculative and the injury from which is purely\r\nconjectural.\"  <em>Markel v. World Flight, Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2369667\"><a href=\"/opinion/2369667/markel-v-world-flight-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 80 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1996, no\r\nwrit).  Summary judgment proof merely suggesting that Seton <em>may</em> year after year deliberately refuse\r\nto file the report and instead pay the fine because of a cost-benefit analysis does not constitute\r\nimminent harm, nor is it enough to prove as a matter of law that the State has suffered irreparable\r\ninjury.  Rather, the State's proof only shows that, except for Seton, all of the other HMOs filed\r\nHEDIS reports <em>despite</em> the costs and deadlines.  Furthermore, given that the State can seek an\r\nassessment of a statutory penalty for Seton's possible future violations, we cannot say that the State\r\nhas an inadequate legal remedy.  The State's summary judgment evidence thus fails to prove that its\r\nright to the extraordinary remedy of a permanent mandatory injunction is so clear and compelling\r\nas to constitute an abuse of discretion on the part of the district court.  We hold that the State failed\r\nto establish as a matter of law its entitlement to a permanent injunction, and therefore overrule the\r\nState's second issue.  </span><span><strong><em><span></span></em></strong></span><span><strong><em><span></span></em></strong></span><span><strong><em><span></span><span></span></em></strong></span><span><strong><em></em></strong></span><span><strong><em><span></span></em></strong></span><span><strong><em></em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>State's Attorney's Fees</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its final issue, the State contends that the district court erred in failing to award its\r\nattorney's fees under the government code, section 402.006(c), which states: \"In a case in which the\r\nstate is entitled to recover a penalty or damages the attorney general is entitled, on behalf of the state,\r\nto reasonable attorney's fees and court costs.\"  Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 402.006(c) (West 1998). \r\nTo pursue civil penalties under the Code, the State must institute legal action.  Here, the State sought\r\nan assessment of the civil penalty against Seton by way of counterclaim, which the trial court\r\ndismissed with prejudice.  Nevertheless, the district court assessed Seton $1,000 for failure to file\r\neach of the 1999 and 2000 reports.  </span><span>Looking at the plain language of the statute, we believe that the\r\nlegislature provided for the recovery of attorney's fees any time the State recovers a penalty or tort\r\ndamages, and we have so held. <em> See State v.

An appellee's brief must conform to the requirements of rule 38.1 of the Texas Rules\r\nof Appellate Procedure, including rule 38.1(h).  Tex. R. App. P. 38.2(a)(1); 38.1(h).  Seton also\r\nsuggests that the district court could not award reasonable attorney's fees because the State's\r\nsummary judgment evidence did not segregate the amount spent exclusively in seeking the civil\r\npenalty.  We reject this argument on the grounds that section 402.006 and the cases interpreting it\r\ndo not require this segregation.  The State recovered a civil penalty from Seton and, by statute, is\r\nentitled to attorney's fees. </span><span> Because the record does not make clear to this Court the basis for the\r\ndistrict court's failure to award attorney's fees to the State, the issue is remanded to the district court\r\nfor the limited purpose of considering the State's request for reasonable attorney's fees and court\r\ncosts under section 402.006 of the government code.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe hold the district court did not err in granting Seton's declaratory judgment claim </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>and in denying the State's request for injunctive relief.  We also hold that the district court did not \r\nabuse its discretion in assessing the minimum statutory penalty against Seton for its failure to file\r\nthe HEDIS reports but that the district court did err in not properly considering attorney's fees for\r\nthe State's recovery of the penalty under section 402.006 of the government code.  Accordingly, we\r\naffirm the district court's declaration that $10,000 is the maximum penalty allowed for failure to file\r\nan annual HEDIS report; we affirm the portion of the judgment granting Seton's summary judgment\r\nand dismissing the State's permanent injunction counterclaim; we affirm the assessment of $1,000\r\nagainst Seton for each unfiled HEDIS report; we remand the issue of the State's entitlement to\r\nreasonable attorney's fees to the district court for consideration of same in accordance with this\r\nopinion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t__________________________________________</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMarilyn Aboussie, Chief Justice </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Before Chief Justice Aboussie, Justices Patterson and Puryear</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>    Opinion by Chief Justice Aboussie; Justice Patterson concurs</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>    Dissenting Opinion by Justice Puryear</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Affirmed in Part; Reversed and Remanded in Part</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Filed:   December 19, 2002</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Publish<span>\r\n<p>1.   According to the Code, the \"attorney general, at the request of the council, shall enforce\r\nthis chapter.\"  Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. § 108.014(c) (West 2001).  Also, a \"civil penalty\r\nrecovered in a suit instituted by the attorney general under this chapter shall be deposited in the\r\ngeneral revenue fund to the credit of the health care information account.\"  <em>Id</em>. § 108.014(d).  \r\n</p><p>2.   Kay Johnsonius, Assistant Attorney General, told counsel for Seton that the State had\r\ncalculated the penalty by determining that Seton's 1999 report was 153 days late, which, at $1,000\r\nper day, amounted to a $153,000 civil penalty. \r\n</p><p>3.   Seton's 2000 HEDIS data was due to be filed with the Council on June 15, 2001; it was\r\noverdue by the date the Council filed its counterclaim.\r\n</p><p>4.   Section 402.004 provides that \"an admission, agreement, or waiver made by the attorney\r\ngeneral in an action or suit to which the state is a party does not prejudice the rights of the state.\" \r\nTex. Gov't Code Ann. § 402.004 (West 1998).\r\n</p><p>5.   In <em>State v. Keeton Packing Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1713040\"><a href=\"/opinion/1713040/state-v-keeton-packing-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>, 780 (Tex. Civ. App.--Amarillo 1972,\r\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.), the court applied the predecessor of section 402.004 of the Government Code.  The\r\ncourt held that any admission in a letter by the Attorney General, to the effect that the State Highway\r\nCommission had no further need for the excess land and that it was his opinion that consideration\r\nfor the deed had failed, was not binding on the State: \"Whether or not land is further needed by the\r\nState Highway Commission is left for the determination of that body and is not within the\r\ndiscretionary powers of the attorney general.\"  <em>Id.  </em>The Attorney General argues that because it is a\r\nparty to the litigation, its admissions bind the parties.  But the admission of one co-defendant does\r\nnot bind another co-defendant.\r\n</p><p>6.   In its response and cross motion for summary judgment, Seton admitted that the\r\ncontroversy giving rise to its declaratory judgment action had ended: \"Plaintiff acknowledges that\r\nno current controversy exists between itself and the State on the issue of the maximum civil penalty\r\nfor 1999 and 2000 . . . .\"  Seton argues, however, that it fears the Council will \"in the future attempt\r\nto assess penalties in excess of the maximum allowed by the regulation\" because the Council\r\n\"remains free to interpret the statute differently and to seek penalties of more than $10,000 in the\r\nfuture.\"\r\n</p><p>7.   In a sub-issue, the State contends that the district court abused its discretion in awarding\r\nattorney's fees to Seton when it lacked the power to grant declaratory relief.  Because we hold that\r\nthe district court had that power, we need not address this argument.\r\n</p><p>8.   The agency rule provides that \"[f]ailure to timely report verified HEDIS data is punishable\r\nby a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 nor more than $10,000 for each violation as set forth in\r\nHealth and Safety Code, § 108.014.\"  25 Tex. Admin. Code § 1301.35 (West 2002) (Texas Health\r\nCare Information Council, Health Care Information).</p></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
