SOUTHWICK, Circuit Judge:\n      In 1965, Plaintiffs sued Tangipahoa Parish School Board, seeking\ndesegregation of the school district.       Since then, numerous remedial\ninjunctions have been issued in pursuit of the ultimate goal: full unitary status\nand dismissal of the case. In 2008, the district court granted the parties’ joint\nmotion to create the position of Chief Desegregation Implementation Officer.\nThe terms of the injunction do not require the district court to approve the\nSchool Board’s candidate for the job.        Nevertheless, the School Board\npreviously submitted some candidates for consideration. The district court\n\f    Case: 15-31119      Document: 00514085584    Page: 2   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-31119\nrejected the School Board’s latest proposed candidate, approving instead the\ncandidate supported by Plaintiffs and the Court Compliance Officer. The\nSchool Board appealed the district court’s original order and the denial of the\nRule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment. We AFFIRM.\n\n\n               FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      Plaintiffs sued Tangipahoa Parish School Board in 1965, claiming equal-\nprotection violations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 that stemmed from systematic\nsegregation. The district court first issued an injunction in 1967 but has since\nissued several remedial injunctions with the goal of achieving the school\ndistrict’s full unitary status.\n      In 2008, the parties jointly moved the district court to create the position\nof Chief Desegregation Implementation Officer (“CDIO”). According to the\nSchool Board, the purpose of the position is “to further the ability of the Board\nto efficiently and proactively meet its desegregation obligations.” The CDIO is\nthus responsible for “coordinat[ing] and oversee[ing] all aspects of the\nimplementation of the court’s orders[.]” The CDIO reports directly to the\nschool superintendent and the Court Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who works\nindependently of the school district to ensure compliance with the court’s\norders and to coordinate and monitor the parties’ actions. The CDIO position\nis not intended to detract from the CCO’s responsibilities. Instead, the CDIO\nworks beneath the CCO to “make ongoing reports and provide all information\nas requested[.]” According to the original injunction, a candidate must possess\na master’s or doctorate degree with emphasis on organizational leadership to\nbe considered for the CDIO position.        The CDIO serves a term of twelve\nconsecutive months as a “full-time, year round” employee.\n      The parties attached a list of the CDIO’s duties and responsibilities to\ntheir joint motion. It provides the CDIO is intended to supervise “[p]ersonnel\n                                        2\n\f    Case: 15-31119      Document: 00514085584      Page: 3   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-31119\nbelow the level of Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent involved in\nimplementation     of   [the]   Consent       Judgment.”     The   CDIO’s     listed\nresponsibilities are numerous and include coordinating academic transfers,\ncommunity-involvement programs, and drop-out-prevention programs.\n      No court order defines the CDIO selection-and-approval process. Nor\ndoes any court order require the district court to approve the School Board’s\nrecommended candidate for CDIO. Nevertheless, the School Board has sought\napproval for some prior appointees.\n      In July 2015, then-CDIO Lionel Jackson announced his intention to\nremain on sick leave until his retirement in December 2015. For two months,\nthe School Board assigned the CDIO’s duties to appropriate staff members\nwhile searching for a new CDIO. In his annual report filed with the district\ncourt, the CCO recommended Andrew Jackson for the CDIO position. Jackson\nis a local minister who holds a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice and\nformerly served as principal of a local residential facility for juvenile\ndelinquents. The School Board considered Jackson, but it ultimately named\nLawrence Thompson as acting CDIO. Thompson holds a master’s degree, has\nserved as a principal in the district, and had served as the district’s Chief\nWelfare and Attendance Officer until he retired in 2010.\n      In August 2015, the School Board filed two motions in the district court,\nseeking (1) approval of Thompson as CDIO, and (2) elimination of the CDIO\nposition, or, alternatively, revision of the CDIO job description. Plaintiffs\nopposed Thompson’s appointment, asserting that Jackson would be a better\nchoice because he is an unbiased outsider who “has the backing of the Black\ncommunity” and the CCO. The district court denied the opposed motions and\nappointed Jackson. The School Board timely noticed its interlocutory appeal.\n      After the original appeal was docketed, the School Board filed a motion\nfor indicative ruling in the district court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n                                          3\n\f    Case: 15-31119      Document: 00514085584     Page: 4   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                   No. 15-31119\n62.1, arguing the court should reconsider its decision because Jackson has\nvarious conflicts of interest that render him unsuitable to serve as CDIO.\nAmong other things, the School Board discovered that Jackson was once\nmarried to the daughter of a named Plaintiff and had a child with her before\ntheir divorce in 1975.      The Plaintiffs opposed the motion on procedural\ngrounds.      The district court granted the motion, holding that the new\nallegations regarding Jackson’s familial ties to the Plaintiffs merited\nreconsideration of the order appointing Jackson as CDIO. Under Federal Rule\nof Appellate Procedure 12.1(a), this court was given notice of the district court’s\norder.\n         Responding to that notice, we remanded the case “for the limited purpose\nof allowing the district court to rule on the matter identified in its indicative\norder.” We also instructed the district court to “make additional findings to\nexplain its appointment of Mr. Jackson instead of Mr. Thompson.” On remand,\nthe district court styled its order as responding to a Rule 60(b) motion for relief\nfrom judgment. It held that none of the alleged conflicts of interest were\nsufficient to justify overturning its prior order appointing Jackson as CDIO. It\nfurther justified its selection of Jackson by noting his work experience,\ncommunity involvement, and personal reputation. The School Board then\namended its notice of appeal to encompass both the original order appointing\nJackson and the district court’s order on the Rule 60(b) motion.\n\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n         The School Board originally appealed the district court’s appointment\norder, which we review for an abuse of discretion because it was a modification\nof an injunction. See Moses v. Washington Par. Sch. Bd., 379 F.3d 319, 327\n(5th Cir. 2004). The School Board also appeals the district court’s denial of a\nRule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment. We review such denials for an\n                                         4\n\f      Case: 15-31119   Document: 00514085584      Page: 5   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-31119\nabuse of discretion also. Diaz v. Stephens, 731 F.3d 370, 374 (5th Cir. 2013).\nIt is not enough that granting the motion may have been permissible; instead,\ndenial of relief “must have been so unwarranted as to constitute an abuse of\ndiscretion.” Id. Although “the district court’s ruling is entitled to deference,”\nquestions of law underlying its decision are reviewed de novo. Frew v. Janek,\n820 F.3d 715, 719 (5th Cir. 2016).\n       We address the contentions in two parts. First, we discuss the original\nappeal concerning the district court’s modification of the injunction through\nthe appointment of Jackson as CDIO. Second, we address the district court’s\ndenial of the Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment.\n       As a threshold matter, we note the Plaintiffs as appellees failed to file an\ninitial appellate brief or a letter brief in response to the district court’s\nsupplemental order. Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 31, “[t]he\nappellee must serve and file a brief within 30 days after the appellant’s brief\nis served.” Subsection (c) provides that any “appellee who fails to file a brief\nwill not be heard at oral argument unless the court grants permission[.]” We\nagree with a nonprecedential opinion that the rule nonetheless permits\naffirmance when appellees fail to file a brief. See SPSL Opobo Liberia, Inc. v.\nMarine Worldwide Servs., Inc., 454 F. App’x 303, 305 (5th Cir. 2011).\n\n\n I.    Modification of the Injunction\n       The School Board initially brought an interlocutory appeal from what it\nclaims was a modification of an injunction. If the order merely interpreted the\ninjunction, we have no jurisdiction. In re Seabulk Offshore, Ltd., 158 F.3d 897,\n899 (5th Cir. 1998). There is jurisdiction, though, when the district court\nmodifies an existing injunction. See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).\n       To decide the nature of this order, “[w]e look beyond the terms used by\nthe parties and the district court to the substance of the action.” Seabulk, 158\n                                         5\n\f    Case: 15-31119    Document: 00514085584     Page: 6   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 15-31119\nF.3d at 899.    A district court interprets an injunction by enforcing the\ninjunction according to its terms or establishing “procedures for enforcement\nwithout changing the command of the injunction.” In re Deepwater Horizon,\n793 F.3d 479, 491 (5th Cir. 2015). Modification, on the other hand, requires\nthat the injunction be altered by the court in some way. Id.\n      The district court explicitly denied the School Board’s motion to modify\nthe CDIO’s job description. The substance of the action was a modification, as\nit appointed a candidate who was not qualified under the injunction. The\ninjunction required the CDIO to possess a master’s or doctorate degree.\nJackson only possessed a bachelor’s degree. Further, the district court rejected\nthe School Board’s recommended appointee in favor of another candidate even\nthough the original order creating the CDIO position is silent about the court’s\nrole in the selection and approval of the person. Thus, the district court’s\nactions were modifications of the terms of the injunction. That means we have\njurisdiction. See Seabulk, 158 F.3d at 899.\n      In its original appeal, the School Board argued that the district court\nabused its discretion by (1) modifying the academic qualifications for the CDIO;\n(2) modifying the selection-and-approval procedure for the CDIO; and (3)\nrelying on the Plaintiffs’ and the CCO’s recommendation in appointing Jackson\nas CDIO. The third argument collapses into the first two because it merely\nsupports the contentions about how the district court abused its discretion in\ndeparting from the terms of the injunction. Academic qualifications and the\nprocess for selection and approval are thus our focus.\n      Federal courts have broad equitable powers to fashion remedial\nmeasures designed to eliminate school segregation. Milliken v. Bradley, 433\nU.S. 267, 279–80 (1977). The district court may “adjust remedies in a feasible\nand practical way to eliminate the conditions or redress the injuries caused by\nunlawful action.” Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 487 (1992). If injunctive\n                                       6\n\f    Case: 15-31119    Document: 00514085584       Page: 7   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 15-31119\nrelief is “to be enforced with fairness and precision,” it must be flexible. Id.\nAccordingly, “sound judicial discretion may call for the modification of the\nterms of an injunctive decree if the circumstances, whether of law or fact,\nobtaining at the time of its issuance have changed, or new ones have since\narisen.” Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 437 (1976). A\nschool district, though, is “entitled to a rather precise statement of its\nobligations under a desegregation decree.” Board of Educ. of Oklahoma City\nPub. Schs. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 246 (1991).\n      We look first at the modification of the CDIO’s academic qualifications.\nThe terms of the injunction, proposed by joint motion of the parties in 2008,\nrequired a CDIO candidate to possess a master’s or doctorate degree with\nemphasis on organizational leadership. All of the previous CDIOs satisfied the\nacademic-qualifications requirement. Similarly, the School Board’s candidate,\nLawrence Thompson, holds a master’s degree and is a former educator and\nadministrator in the district. These qualifications are necessary, the School\nBoard asserts, because “the CDIO is required to perform a broad spectrum of\nduties involving multiple academic disciplines and institutional procedures,\nthe knowledge of which is particularly acquired via the requisite academic\ndegree as well as lengthy educational experience.” In contrast, Jackson “holds\nno [degree] in education or in educational administration.”\n      The district court rejected the academically qualified candidate in favor\nof Jackson. On remand, following its grant of the School Board’s motion for\nindicative ruling, the district court offered additional explanation for its\ndecision. First, Jackson was the preferred candidate of the Plaintiffs and the\nCCO, while Thompson “did not have the support of the African American\ncommunity.” Second, Jackson was not a former school-system employee, which\nbrings “a level of independence and impartiality” to the CDIO position that\nmight better serve the school district’s ultimate purpose. Jackson is also a\n                                       7\n\f    Case: 15-31119    Document: 00514085584     Page: 8   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 15-31119\nleader in a local church and a well-respected member of the community.\nFinally, he proved his administrative ability during “sixteen years managing\nan organization dedicated to helping at-risk youth.” This summary seems to\nmean the district court found Jackson to be more qualified than Thompson\neven without the requisite degree.\n      There are several principles pertinent to our analysis. First, consent\ndecrees are contractual in nature, so parties may fairly expect such orders to\nbe enforced as both a contract and a judicial decree. Frew ex rel. Frew v.\nHawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 437 (2004). As a judicial decree, such injunctions are\n“subject to the rules generally applicable to other judgments and decrees,” id.,\nincluding modification, see id. at 441. Further, individuals and entities subject\nto injunctions must have fair notice of the terms of the injunction and any\nmodifications that take place. See W. Water Mgmt., Inc. v. Brown, 40 F.3d 105,\n109 (5th Cir. 1994); Alabama Nursing Home Ass’n v. Harris, 617 F.2d 385,\n387–88 (5th Cir. 1980). Upon proper notice, the district court may modify the\nterms of an injunction sua sponte. W. Water, 40 F.3d at 109.\n      Despite the fact that the parties jointly agreed to the initial terms, the\ncourt utilized its flexible authority to modify the decree when faced with\nchanged circumstances. See Spangler, 427 U.S. at 437. Although Thompson\nsatisfied the stated requirements for the CDIO position, the district court\nfound that Jackson was more qualified through life experience and community\ninvolvement. The parties were on notice of a possible modification at least\nthrough the CCO’s earlier annual report suggesting the court name Jackson.\nThe School Board was not “unprepared” to defend its selection of Thompson.\nSee W. Water, 40 F.3d at 109. Modification of the academic-qualifications\nrequirement was not an abuse of discretion.\n      The School Board next argues that the district court improperly modified\nthe process for selecting and approving a CDIO. The record reveals, though,\n                                       8\n\f      Case: 15-31119     Document: 00514085584    Page: 9   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                   No. 15-31119\nthat there had been prior referral of final approval of a CDIO to the court. For\nexample, the School Board sought the court’s approval when the first CDIO\nwas replaced, then failed to do so for the CDIO immediately thereafter. Since\nthe position was created in 2008, the School Board sought court approval for\nthree out of four candidates.\n       The same principles articulated earlier apply here. The district court\nhad the authority to modify the terms of the injunction when faced with\nchanged circumstances. See Spangler, 427 U.S. at 437. As previously noted,\nthe district court found Jackson to be more qualified than Thompson and\nrejected the School Board’s recommendation. Further, the School Board was\nclearly on notice of the district court’s prior involvement, having approached\nthe court for approval of a CDIO candidate at least three times. See W. Water,\n40 F.3d at 109. The district court did not abuse its discretion in modifying the\nselection-and-approval process.\n\n\nII.       Denial of Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from Judgment\n          In its Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment, the School Board\nargued that Jackson has several conflicts of interest rendering him unfit to\nserve as CDIO. The first was that Jackson had been married to “Catherine\nMoore (the alleged daughter of M.C. Moore and sister of named class\nrepresentative Joyce Marie Moore), with whom he has one child.” The second\nwas due to evidence the School Board obtained “of a certificate of marriage\nbetween one Jessie Jackson, Jr. (allegedly a relation to Andrew Jackson) and\nJoyce Marie Moore (the daughter of M.C. Moore and on whose behalf he filed\nsuit).”     Finally, the School Board claims Jackson is involved with a local\nMinisterial Alliance, which may inhibit the impartial exercise of judgment.\n          In response, Plaintiffs admit that Jackson was married to Catherine\nMoore from 1969 to 1975. Plaintiffs also acknowledge that Jackson and Moore\n                                         9\n\f    Case: 15-31119       Document: 00514085584    Page: 10   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                   No. 15-31119\nhave a daughter together who is related to the plaintiffs. Regardless, they\ncontend the School Board has not shown from these facts that any conflict of\ninterest “would interfere with Mr. Jackson fairly performing his duties as a\nCDIO.” As to the other claimed disqualifying relationship, Plaintiffs argue\nthat even if someone named Jessie Jackson once married Joyce Marie Moore,\nthe School Board offered no evidence to show that he and the CDIO Jackson\nare related.\n      The district court found that Jackson’s familial ties were insufficient to\nwarrant reversal of its earlier appointment order.           It acknowledged the\nexistence of the marriage relationship between Andrew Jackson and Catherine\nMoore but determined the relationship created neither an actual conflict nor\nthe appearance of impropriety.         It further noted the lack of evidence\nestablishing a relationship between Andrew and Jessie Jackson. “Without\nevidence that these two individuals are actually related,” it held, “this Court\ncannot find that there is a relationship that could reasonably implicate a\nconflict of interest.”\n      A district court does not abuse its discretion by making a decision after\nthe parties present little or no evidence of a particular fact. See, e.g., Shaffer\nv. Williams, 794 F.2d 1030, 1033–34 (5th Cir. 1986). At most, there is an\nadmission that Andrew Jackson and Catherine Moore were once married and\nhad a child together who is related to the named Plaintiffs. The marriage was\nin the distant past, and the School Board did not show an actual conflict arising\nfrom Jackson’s daughter. The district court did not rule based on “an erroneous\nview of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.” See\nCooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 405 (1990).\n      As to Jackson’s affiliation with the Ministerial Alliance, the district court\nconcluded this argument could not be reconsidered at this point. The district\ncourt understood that the issue had been addressed when the School Board\n                                        10\n\f   Case: 15-31119     Document: 00514085584     Page: 11   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 15-31119\nfirst moved for approval of Lawrence Thompson as CDIO. It appears, though,\nthat Jackson’s affiliation with the Ministerial Alliance was not raised as an\nissue at that time. The memorandum in support of that motion contained no\nreference to the Ministerial Alliance, and Jackson is only mentioned in a brief\nfootnote. The argument is a new one.\n      According to a newspaper article the School Board offered as an exhibit,\nthe Ministerial Alliance is an interdenominational organization “with the goal\nof raising all people of th[e] area politically, economically and socially.”\nJackson is the vice president of the Alliance and also serves as “the pastor of a\nmajor congregation in Tangipahoa Parish[.]” In his capacity as vice president\nof the Alliance, Jackson has revealed his intent to “emphasize political\ninvolvement.” In its supplemental brief, the School Board identified this as a\nconflict of interest because Jackson allegedly “revealed that he was acting on\nbehalf of [the Alliance] regarding the desegregation case — the same\ndesegregation case for which he was appointed to serve as CDIO and act on\nbehalf of the Board.” The School Board introduced into evidence an email\nshowing that Jackson had at least twice acted in his capacity as vice president\nof the Ministerial Alliance to conduct meetings and engage in correspondence\nregarding the School Board’s desegregation plan.\n      As with the alleged marital conflicts, the School Board has failed to\nproduce evidence establishing how the Ministerial Alliance affiliation has\npreviously or might potentially generate a conflict. We conclude Jackson’s role\nwith the Ministerial Alliance does not justify holding the district court abused\nits discretion in appointing Jackson as CDIO.\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       11\n\f",

SOUTHWICK, Circuit Judge:\n      In 1965, Plaintiffs sued Tangipahoa Parish School Board, seeking\ndesegregation of the school district.       Since then, numerous remedial\ninjunctions have been issued in pursuit of the ultimate goal: full unitary status\nand dismissal of the case. In 2008, the district court granted the parties’ joint\nmotion to create the position of Chief Desegregation Implementation Officer.\nThe terms of the injunction do not require the district court to approve the\nSchool Board’s candidate for the job.        Nevertheless, the School Board\npreviously submitted some candidates for consideration. The district court\n\f    Case: 15-31119      Document: 00514085584    Page: 2   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-31119\nrejected the School Board’s latest proposed candidate, approving instead the\ncandidate supported by Plaintiffs and the Court Compliance Officer. The\nSchool Board appealed the district court’s original order and the denial of the\nRule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment. We AFFIRM.\n\n\n               FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      Plaintiffs sued Tangipahoa Parish School Board in 1965, claiming equal-\nprotection violations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 that stemmed from systematic\nsegregation. The district court first issued an injunction in 1967 but has since\nissued several remedial injunctions with the goal of achieving the school\ndistrict’s full unitary status.\n      In 2008, the parties jointly moved the district court to create the position\nof Chief Desegregation Implementation Officer (“CDIO”). According to the\nSchool Board, the purpose of the position is “to further the ability of the Board\nto efficiently and proactively meet its desegregation obligations.” The CDIO is\nthus responsible for “coordinat[ing] and oversee[ing] all aspects of the\nimplementation of the court’s orders[.]” The CDIO reports directly to the\nschool superintendent and the Court Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who works\nindependently of the school district to ensure compliance with the court’s\norders and to coordinate and monitor the parties’ actions. The CDIO position\nis not intended to detract from the CCO’s responsibilities. Instead, the CDIO\nworks beneath the CCO to “make ongoing reports and provide all information\nas requested[.]” According to the original injunction, a candidate must possess\na master’s or doctorate degree with emphasis on organizational leadership to\nbe considered for the CDIO position.        The CDIO serves a term of twelve\nconsecutive months as a “full-time, year round” employee.\n      The parties attached a list of the CDIO’s duties and responsibilities to\ntheir joint motion. It provides the CDIO is intended to supervise “[p]ersonnel\n                                        2\n\f    Case: 15-31119      Document: 00514085584      Page: 3   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-31119\nbelow the level of Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent involved in\nimplementation     of   [the]   Consent       Judgment.”     The   CDIO’s     listed\nresponsibilities are numerous and include coordinating academic transfers,\ncommunity-involvement programs, and drop-out-prevention programs.\n      No court order defines the CDIO selection-and-approval process. Nor\ndoes any court order require the district court to approve the School Board’s\nrecommended candidate for CDIO. Nevertheless, the School Board has sought\napproval for some prior appointees.\n      In July 2015, then-CDIO Lionel Jackson announced his intention to\nremain on sick leave until his retirement in December 2015. For two months,\nthe School Board assigned the CDIO’s duties to appropriate staff members\nwhile searching for a new CDIO. In his annual report filed with the district\ncourt, the CCO recommended Andrew Jackson for the CDIO position. Jackson\nis a local minister who holds a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice and\nformerly served as principal of a local residential facility for juvenile\ndelinquents. The School Board considered Jackson, but it ultimately named\nLawrence Thompson as acting CDIO. Thompson holds a master’s degree, has\nserved as a principal in the district, and had served as the district’s Chief\nWelfare and Attendance Officer until he retired in 2010.\n      In August 2015, the School Board filed two motions in the district court,\nseeking (1) approval of Thompson as CDIO, and (2) elimination of the CDIO\nposition, or, alternatively, revision of the CDIO job description. Plaintiffs\nopposed Thompson’s appointment, asserting that Jackson would be a better\nchoice because he is an unbiased outsider who “has the backing of the Black\ncommunity” and the CCO. The district court denied the opposed motions and\nappointed Jackson. The School Board timely noticed its interlocutory appeal.\n      After the original appeal was docketed, the School Board filed a motion\nfor indicative ruling in the district court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n                                          3\n\f    Case: 15-31119      Document: 00514085584     Page: 4   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                   No. 15-31119\n62.1, arguing the court should reconsider its decision because Jackson has\nvarious conflicts of interest that render him unsuitable to serve as CDIO.\nAmong other things, the School Board discovered that Jackson was once\nmarried to the daughter of a named Plaintiff and had a child with her before\ntheir divorce in 1975.      The Plaintiffs opposed the motion on procedural\ngrounds.      The district court granted the motion, holding that the new\nallegations regarding Jackson’s familial ties to the Plaintiffs merited\nreconsideration of the order appointing Jackson as CDIO. Under Federal Rule\nof Appellate Procedure 12.1(a), this court was given notice of the district court’s\norder.\n         Responding to that notice, we remanded the case “for the limited purpose\nof allowing the district court to rule on the matter identified in its indicative\norder.” We also instructed the district court to “make additional findings to\nexplain its appointment of Mr. Jackson instead of Mr. Thompson.” On remand,\nthe district court styled its order as responding to a Rule 60(b) motion for relief\nfrom judgment. It held that none of the alleged conflicts of interest were\nsufficient to justify overturning its prior order appointing Jackson as CDIO. It\nfurther justified its selection of Jackson by noting his work experience,\ncommunity involvement, and personal reputation. The School Board then\namended its notice of appeal to encompass both the original order appointing\nJackson and the district court’s order on the Rule 60(b) motion.\n\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n         The School Board originally appealed the district court’s appointment\norder, which we review for an abuse of discretion because it was a modification\nof an injunction. See Moses v. Washington Par. Sch. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"35997\"><a href=\"/opinion/35997/moses-v-wash-prsh-sch-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 327\n(5th Cir. 2004). The School Board also appeals the district court’s denial of a\nRule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment. We review such denials for an\n                                         4\n\f      Case: 15-31119   Document: 00514085584      Page: 5   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-31119\nabuse of discretion also.

Although “the district court’s ruling is entitled to deference,”\nquestions of law underlying its decision are reviewed de novo. Frew v. Janek,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 719 (5th Cir. 2016).\n       We address the contentions in two parts. First, we discuss the original\nappeal concerning the district court’s modification of the injunction through\nthe appointment of Jackson as CDIO. Second, we address the district court’s\ndenial of the Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment.\n       As a threshold matter, we note the Plaintiffs as appellees failed to file an\ninitial appellate brief or a letter brief in response to the district court’s\nsupplemental order. Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 31, “[t]he\nappellee must serve and file a brief within 30 days after the appellant’s brief\nis served.” Subsection (c) provides that any “appellee who fails to file a brief\nwill not be heard at oral argument unless the court grants permission[.]” We\nagree with a nonprecedential opinion that the rule nonetheless permits\naffirmance when appellees fail to file a brief. See SPSL Opobo Liberia, Inc. v.\nMarine Worldwide Servs., Inc., 454 F. App’x 303, 305 (5th Cir. 2011).\n\n\n I.    Modification of the Injunction\n       The School Board initially brought an interlocutory appeal from what it\nclaims was a modification of an injunction. If the order merely interpreted the\ninjunction, we have no jurisdiction. In re Seabulk Offshore, Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758681\"><a href=\"/opinion/758681/in-the-matter-of-seabulk-offshore-limited-as-owner-andor-operator-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n899 (5th Cir. 1998). There is jurisdiction, though, when the district court\nmodifies an existing injunction. See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).\n       To decide the nature of this order, “[w]e look beyond the terms used by\nthe parties and the district court to the substance of the action.” Seabulk, 158\n                                         5\n\f    Case: 15-31119    Document: 00514085584     Page: 6   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 15-31119\nF.3d at 899.    A district court interprets an injunction by enforcing the\ninjunction according to its terms or establishing “procedures for enforcement\nwithout changing the command of the injunction.” In re Deepwater Horizon,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 491 (5th Cir. 2015). Modification, on the other hand, requires\nthat the injunction be altered by the court in some way. Id.\n      The district court explicitly denied the School Board’s motion to modify\nthe CDIO’s job description. The substance of the action was a modification, as\nit appointed a candidate who was not qualified under the injunction. The\ninjunction required the CDIO to possess a master’s or doctorate degree.\nJackson only possessed a bachelor’s degree. Further, the district court rejected\nthe School Board’s recommended appointee in favor of another candidate even\nthough the original order creating the CDIO position is silent about the court’s\nrole in the selection and approval of the person. Thus, the district court’s\nactions were modifications of the terms of the injunction. That means we have\njurisdiction. See Seabulk, 158 F.3d at 899.\n      In its original appeal, the School Board argued that the district court\nabused its discretion by (1) modifying the academic qualifications for the CDIO;\n(2) modifying the selection-and-approval procedure for the CDIO; and (3)\nrelying on the Plaintiffs’ and the CCO’s recommendation in appointing Jackson\nas CDIO. The third argument collapses into the first two because it merely\nsupports the contentions about how the district court abused its discretion in\ndeparting from the terms of the injunction. Academic qualifications and the\nprocess for selection and approval are thus our focus.\n      Federal courts have broad equitable powers to fashion remedial\nmeasures designed to eliminate school segregation.

A\nschool district, though, is “entitled to a rather precise statement of its\nobligations under a desegregation decree.” Board of Educ. of Oklahoma City\nPub. Schs. v.

All of the previous CDIOs satisfied the\nacademic-qualifications requirement. Similarly, the School Board’s candidate,\nLawrence Thompson, holds a master’s degree and is a former educator and\nadministrator in the district. These qualifications are necessary, the School\nBoard asserts, because “the CDIO is required to perform a broad spectrum of\nduties involving multiple academic disciplines and institutional procedures,\nthe knowledge of which is particularly acquired via the requisite academic\ndegree as well as lengthy educational experience.” In contrast, Jackson “holds\nno [degree] in education or in educational administration.”\n      The district court rejected the academically qualified candidate in favor\nof Jackson. On remand, following its grant of the School Board’s motion for\nindicative ruling, the district court offered additional explanation for its\ndecision. First, Jackson was the preferred candidate of the Plaintiffs and the\nCCO, while Thompson “did not have the support of the African American\ncommunity.” Second, Jackson was not a former school-system employee, which\nbrings “a level of independence and impartiality” to the CDIO position that\nmight better serve the school district’s ultimate purpose. Jackson is also a\n                                       7\n\f    Case: 15-31119    Document: 00514085584     Page: 8   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 15-31119\nleader in a local church and a well-respected member of the community.\nFinally, he proved his administrative ability during “sixteen years managing\nan organization dedicated to helping at-risk youth.” This summary seems to\nmean the district court found Jackson to be more qualified than Thompson\neven without the requisite degree.\n      There are several principles pertinent to our analysis. First, consent\ndecrees are contractual in nature, so parties may fairly expect such orders to\nbe enforced as both a contract and a judicial decree. Frew ex rel. Frew v.\nHawkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131155\"><a href=\"/opinion/131155/frew-v-hawkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437 (2004). As a judicial decree, such injunctions are\n“subject to the rules generally applicable to other judgments and decrees,” id.,\nincluding modification, see id. at 441. Further, individuals and entities subject\nto injunctions must have fair notice of the terms of the injunction and any\nmodifications that take place. See W. Water Mgmt., Inc. v.

Upon proper notice, the district court may modify the\nterms of an injunction sua sponte. W. Water, 40 F.3d at 109.\n      Despite the fact that the parties jointly agreed to the initial terms, the\ncourt utilized its flexible authority to modify the decree when faced with\nchanged circumstances. See Spangler, 427 U.S. at 437. Although Thompson\nsatisfied the stated requirements for the CDIO position, the district court\nfound that Jackson was more qualified through life experience and community\ninvolvement. The parties were on notice of a possible modification at least\nthrough the CCO’s earlier annual report suggesting the court name Jackson.\nThe School Board was not “unprepared” to defend its selection of Thompson.\nSee W. Water, 40 F.3d at 109. Modification of the academic-qualifications\nrequirement was not an abuse of discretion.\n      The School Board next argues that the district court improperly modified\nthe process for selecting and approving a CDIO. The record reveals, though,\n                                       8\n\f      Case: 15-31119     Document: 00514085584    Page: 9   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                   No. 15-31119\nthat there had been prior referral of final approval of a CDIO to the court. For\nexample, the School Board sought the court’s approval when the first CDIO\nwas replaced, then failed to do so for the CDIO immediately thereafter. Since\nthe position was created in 2008, the School Board sought court approval for\nthree out of four candidates.\n       The same principles articulated earlier apply here. The district court\nhad the authority to modify the terms of the injunction when faced with\nchanged circumstances. See Spangler, 427 U.S. at 437. As previously noted,\nthe district court found Jackson to be more qualified than Thompson and\nrejected the School Board’s recommendation. Further, the School Board was\nclearly on notice of the district court’s prior involvement, having approached\nthe court for approval of a CDIO candidate at least three times. See W. Water,\n40 F.3d at 109. The district court did not abuse its discretion in modifying the\nselection-and-approval process.\n\n\nII.       Denial of Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from Judgment\n          In its Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment, the School Board\nargued that Jackson has several conflicts of interest rendering him unfit to\nserve as CDIO. The first was that Jackson had been married to “Catherine\nMoore (the alleged daughter of M.C. Moore and sister of named class\nrepresentative Joyce Marie Moore), with whom he has one child.” The second\nwas due to evidence the School Board obtained “of a certificate of marriage\nbetween one Jessie Jackson, Jr. (allegedly a relation to Andrew Jackson) and\nJoyce Marie Moore (the daughter of M.C. Moore and on whose behalf he filed\nsuit).”     Finally, the School Board claims Jackson is involved with a local\nMinisterial Alliance, which may inhibit the impartial exercise of judgment.\n          In response, Plaintiffs admit that Jackson was married to Catherine\nMoore from 1969 to 1975. Plaintiffs also acknowledge that Jackson and Moore\n                                         9\n\f    Case: 15-31119       Document: 00514085584    Page: 10   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                   No. 15-31119\nhave a daughter together who is related to the plaintiffs. Regardless, they\ncontend the School Board has not shown from these facts that any conflict of\ninterest “would interfere with Mr. Jackson fairly performing his duties as a\nCDIO.” As to the other claimed disqualifying relationship, Plaintiffs argue\nthat even if someone named Jessie Jackson once married Joyce Marie Moore,\nthe School Board offered no evidence to show that he and the CDIO Jackson\nare related.\n      The district court found that Jackson’s familial ties were insufficient to\nwarrant reversal of its earlier appointment order.           It acknowledged the\nexistence of the marriage relationship between Andrew Jackson and Catherine\nMoore but determined the relationship created neither an actual conflict nor\nthe appearance of impropriety.         It further noted the lack of evidence\nestablishing a relationship between Andrew and Jessie Jackson. “Without\nevidence that these two individuals are actually related,” it held, “this Court\ncannot find that there is a relationship that could reasonably implicate a\nconflict of interest.”\n      A district court does not abuse its discretion by making a decision after\nthe parties present little or no evidence of a particular fact. See, e.g., Shaffer\nv. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"472599\"><a href=\"/opinion/472599/philip-craig-shaffer-v-max-williams-us-companies-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">794</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1030</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1033–34 (5th Cir. 1986). At most, there is an\nadmission that Andrew Jackson and Catherine Moore were once married and\nhad a child together who is related to the named Plaintiffs. The marriage was\nin the distant past, and the School Board did not show an actual conflict arising\nfrom Jackson’s daughter. The district court did not rule based on “an erroneous\nview of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.” See\nCooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112457\"><a href=\"/opinion/112457/cooter-gell-v-hartmarx-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 405 (1990).\n      As to Jackson’s affiliation with the Ministerial Alliance, the district court\nconcluded this argument could not be reconsidered at this point. The district\ncourt understood that the issue had been addressed when the School Board\n                                        10\n\f   Case: 15-31119     Document: 00514085584     Page: 11   Date Filed: 07/24/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 15-31119\nfirst moved for approval of Lawrence Thompson as CDIO. It appears, though,\nthat Jackson’s affiliation with the Ministerial Alliance was not raised as an\nissue at that time. The memorandum in support of that motion contained no\nreference to the Ministerial Alliance, and Jackson is only mentioned in a brief\nfootnote. The argument is a new one.\n      According to a newspaper article the School Board offered as an exhibit,\nthe Ministerial Alliance is an interdenominational organization “with the goal\nof raising all people of th[e] area politically, economically and socially.”\nJackson is the vice president of the Alliance and also serves as “the pastor of a\nmajor congregation in Tangipahoa Parish[.]” In his capacity as vice president\nof the Alliance, Jackson has revealed his intent to “emphasize political\ninvolvement.” In its supplemental brief, the School Board identified this as a\nconflict of interest because Jackson allegedly “revealed that he was acting on\nbehalf of [the Alliance] regarding the desegregation case — the same\ndesegregation case for which he was appointed to serve as CDIO and act on\nbehalf of the Board.” The School Board introduced into evidence an email\nshowing that Jackson had at least twice acted in his capacity as vice president\nof the Ministerial Alliance to conduct meetings and engage in correspondence\nregarding the School Board’s desegregation plan.\n      As with the alleged marital conflicts, the School Board has failed to\nproduce evidence establishing how the Ministerial Alliance affiliation has\npreviously or might potentially generate a conflict. We conclude Jackson’s role\nwith the Ministerial Alliance does not justify holding the district court abused\nits discretion in appointing Jackson as CDIO.\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       11\n\f</pre>",
