The district court dismissed Mr. White’s amended complaint and denied\n\nhis various motions, including one for an injunction regarding medical care, but it\n\npermitted him to file a second amended complaint addressing the adequacy of\n\nmedical care he has received while in custody. Mr. White now challenges the\n\n\n\n\n      *\n             After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has\ndecided unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the\ndetermination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G).\nThe case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.\n\n      This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the\ndoctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited,\nhowever, for its persuasive value consistent with Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 32.1 and Tenth Circuit Rule 32.1.\n      1\n             Because Mr. White appears pro se, we afford his filings a liberal\nconstruction. See Garza v. Davis, 596 F.3d 1198, 1201 n.2 (10th Cir. 2010); Yang\nv. Archuleta, 525 F.3d 925, 927 n.1 (10th Cir. 2008).\n\n                                          2\n\fdistrict court’s denial of injunctive relief, 2 requests a certificate of appealability\n\n(“COA”), and seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (“IFP”) on appeal.\n\nExercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), we affirm the district\n\ncourt’s denial of injunctive relief, dismiss Mr. White’s application for a COA,\n\nand deny leave to proceed IFP.\n\n                                            I\n\n      Mr. White is presently incarcerated within the KDOC, where he is serving a\n\nsentence for murder in the first degree. He alleges numerous health impediments,\n\nincluding “carcinoma . . . , diagnosis of chronic Bipolar 1 disorder, and physical\n\nimpairment [brought on by a] leg injury.” R. at 57 (Am. Compl., filed Feb. 18,\n\n2014). In addition, he asserts that he has been “committed” to various\n\ncorrectional mental-health facilities for “chronic care.” Id.\n\n      In January 2014, Mr. White filed a lawsuit in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Kansas. On initial screening pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915A(a), the district court ordered Mr. White to submit an amended complaint\n\ncontaining specific facts to support each of his claims.\n\n\n\n      2\n              In his notice of appeal, Mr. White indicated that he also sought to\nchallenge rulings other than the district court’s denial of injunctive relief. We\nmay only exercise jurisdiction over final orders, see 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and certain\ninterlocutory and collateral orders—notably, including orders denying motions for\npreliminary injunctions, see id. § 1292(a); Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b); Cohen v.\nBeneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546 (1949). These additional rulings\nfall outside the scope of our appellate jurisdiction, so we do not address them.\n\n                                            3\n\f      Mr. White did file an amended complaint in February 2014. The specific\n\nclaims advanced in his amended complaint were: (1) that Defendants violated his\n\nrights under the ADA and the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\n\nConstitution by “discrimination and lack of enforcement and/or making policy to\n\nprotect prisoners it has deemed as mentally ill,” R. at 60; (2) that his\n\nconstitutional rights were violated when another prisoner stole his property; (3)\n\nthat KDOC officials were deliberately indifferent to prisoners, and recklessly and\n\nmaliciously harassed them; (4) that KDOC officials were deliberately indifferent\n\nto him by failing to identify officers who allegedly assaulted him during a March\n\n2013 cell extraction; (5) that he received inadequate medical care for injuries he\n\nsustained during that cell extraction and experienced cruel conditions when “held\n\nin isolation” afterward, id. at 62; and (6) that Defendants violated his\n\nconstitutional rights by failing to expedite his administrative grievances. 3\n\n      Approximately one week after submitting his amended complaint, Mr.\n\nWhite filed a document styled “Injunction for Medical Relief,” claiming\n\n“excruciating” and “chronic” ankle and leg pain and asking the district court to\n\n      3\n              Liberally construing the language of the amended complaint, as\ngermane here, Mr. White appears to be seeking injunctive relief from the\nindividual Defendants in their official capacities. This category of action has a\nsolid footing in the law. See Roe No. 2 v. Ogden, 253 F.3d 1225, 1233 (10th Cir.\n2001) (“An individual may bring an ADA or § 1983 action against a state official\nin federal court for injunctive relief . . . .”); see also Branson Sch. Dist. RE-82 v.\nRomer, 161 F.3d 619, 631 (10th Cir. 1998) (“[A] suit against a state official in his\nor her official capacity seeking prospective injunctive relief is not . . . a suit\nagainst the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes.”).\n\n                                           4\n\forder Secretary Roberts, as principal administrator of KDOC, to refer him to a\n\n“doctor of specialized medical care.” Id. at 94–95 (Inj. Mot., filed Feb. 26,\n\n2014); see id. at 97 (Ex. A to Inj. Mot.) (“The Principal Administrator should\n\nhave provided me with a doctor for treatment and pain relief.”).\n\n      The district court ruled on all of Mr. White’s claims for relief in a single\n\norder on September 16, 2014, and did not enter final judgment. As relevant here,\n\nit concluded that Mr. White’s claims under the ADA (and, liberally construed,\n\nunder the Rehabilitation Act as well) failed to state a claim for relief. It likewise\n\nfound that Mr. White’s remaining claims, construed as arising under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983, should be dismissed with one exception: his claim asserting inadequate\n\nmedical care following his March 2013 cell-extraction injuries. With regard to\n\nthat claim, the court granted Mr. White an additional opportunity to amend his\n\ncomplaint to explain the alleged constitutional violation and his theory of\n\ncausation. The court set a deadline of October 16, 2014, to present a second\n\namended complaint concerning only the claim of constitutionally insufficient\n\nmedical care, noting that failure to amend would subject that claim to dismissal.\n\nFurther, ostensibly in light of its conclusion that Mr. White had deficiently\n\npleaded his medical-care claim, the court denied his motion for injunctive relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\f      Mr. White did not file a second amended complaint. Instead, on September\n\n30, 2014, he filed a notice of interlocutory appeal. His briefing before us is\n\nstyled as a “combined opening brief and application for a certificate of\n\nappealability.” 4 Aplt. Combined Opening Br. at 1 (capitalization altered).\n\n                                          II\n\n                                          A\n\n      Liberally construing Mr. White’s “Injunction for Medical Relief” as a\n\nmotion for a preliminary injunction, we review the district court’s denial of such\n\nrelief for an abuse of discretion. See Little v. Jones, 607 F.3d 1245, 1250 (10th\n\nCir. 2010). This standard generally militates in favor of affirmance. See RoDa\n\nDrilling Co. v. Siegal, 552 F.3d 1203, 1208 (10th Cir. 2009) (noting that the\n\nhurdle to demonstrate an abuse of discretion is “high”). Indeed, we have\n\nexplained that “[a]n abuse of discretion occurs only when the trial court bases its\n\ndecision on an erroneous conclusion of law or where there is no rational basis in\n\nthe evidence for the ruling.” Wilderness Workshop v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt.,\n\n531 F.3d 1220, 1223–24 (10th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted); see\n\nWinnebago Tribe of Neb. v. Stovall, 341 F.3d 1202, 1205–06 (10th Cir. 2003)\n\n(“We have previously described abuse of discretion as an arbitrary, capricious,\n\nwhimsical, or manifestly unreasonable judgment.” (internal quotation marks\n\n      4\n             In his opening brief, Mr. White also asks us to appoint him counsel.\nBecause we affirm the district court, under the circumstances of this case, we\ndeny this request as moot.\n\n                                          6\n\fomitted)). In our review, “we consider the merits of the case only as they affect\n\nth[e court’s] exercise of discretion,” and we “examine the district court’s legal\n\ndeterminations de novo[] and its underlying factual findings for clear error.”\n\nAtt’y Gen. of Okla. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 565 F.3d 769, 776 (10th Cir. 2009).\n\n                                          B\n\n      The relief requested in Mr. White’s preliminary-injunction motion is an\n\norder directing Secretary Roberts to exercise his power as head of KDOC to\n\n“give[] [Mr. White] relief from” chronic pain by referring him to a “speciali[st]”\n\nphysician to “diagnose and treat” his claimed leg and ankle injuries. R. at 94–95.\n\nStated otherwise, Mr. White asked the district court to remedy a perceived\n\nconstitutional injury by ordering Secretary Roberts, as the official in charge of\n\nKDOC, to ensure that the course of medical treatment Mr. White considered\n\nappropriate was provided to him. That purported constitutional injury implicates\n\na § 1983 claim of deliberate indifference to Mr. White’s serious medical needs in\n\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment. See Boutwell v. Keating, 399 F.3d 1203,\n\n1208 (10th Cir. 2005) (“[A] § 1983 action is a proper remedy for a state prisoner\n\nwho is making a constitutional challenge to the conditions of his prison life . . . .”\n\n(quoting Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 499 (1973)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)).\n\n      A movant seeking a preliminary injunction to remedy such an alleged\n\nconstitutional violation must establish “four factors: (1) a likelihood of success on\n\n                                          7\n\fthe merits [of his described claim]; (2) a likelihood that [he] will suffer\n\nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of\n\nequities tips in [his] favor; and (4) that the injunction is in the public interest.”\n\nRoDa Drilling Co., 552 F.3d at 1208; see Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council,\n\nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). The first of these factors—likelihood of success on\n\nthe merits—resolves the instant appeal; accordingly, we confine our analysis to\n\nthat issue. Cf. Republican Party of N.M. v. King, 741 F.3d 1089, 1092 (10th Cir.\n\n2013) (resolving disposition of the injunction at the first step of our traditional\n\ntest). Because we find it exceedingly unlikely that Mr. White could prevail on the\n\nmerits of his Eighth Amendment claim, we conclude that the first factor is not\n\nsatisfied. Consequently, there was no legally cognizable predicate for the\n\nissuance of an injunction.\n\n      Based on the allegations in Mr. White’s amended complaint, it is clear that\n\nhis claimed physical injuries date back to March 1, 2013, when he was scheduled\n\nto begin serving fourteen days in administrative segregation for a disciplinary\n\nviolation. By his own admission, Mr. White was forcibly removed from his cell\n\nafter he refused two meals and dove under a bed to avoid the correctional officers\n\nentering his cell. He has said that an officer “grabbed [his] left leg” to extract\n\nhim from underneath the bed, where he “was wedged in pretty tight[ly].” R. at\n\n70.\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f      Mr. White’s amended complaint also states that no prison employee\n\nexamined his leg and ankle when he visited the medical clinic after the cell\n\nextraction, and that he “ha[s] been unable to find out . . . who denied [him]\n\nmedical care for” these ailments. Id. at 71. His allegations of physical injury\n\notherwise bear on the purported failure of Secretary Roberts, as KDOC’s principal\n\nadministrator, to heed approximately twelve requests for pain relief—presumably\n\nby sending a physician Mr. White’s way, or by directing prison employees to\n\nprescribe specific analgesics. Yet, Mr. White has averred, he was permitted to\n\nsee “a nurse or nurse practitioner,” and he received Tylenol and Meloxicam (i.e.,\n\nanother anti-inflammatory medication) to treat his pain. Id. at 79.\n\n      Absent from all of the foregoing averments is any identification by Mr.\n\nWhite of a KDOC employee who knowingly disregarded an excessive risk to his\n\nhealth. See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 845–46 (1994); Blackmon v.\n\nSutton, 734 F.3d 1237, 1244 (10th Cir. 2013). That glaring deficiency forecloses\n\nhim from enunciating a proper claim of Eighth Amendment deliberate\n\nindifference, which has a subjective component under which a plaintiff must show\n\nthat an official (a) was “aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn\n\nthat a substantial risk of serious harm exist[ed]” and (b) drew the inference. Self\n\nv. Crum, 439 F.3d 1227, 1231 (10th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Specifically, Mr. White’s generalized allegations of dissatisfaction with the\n\nprison medical team’s prescribed course of treatment—viz., the nurses’ and nurse\n\n                                          9\n\fpractitioners’ dispensation of two anti-inflammatory medications for pain relief,\n\nand the fact that providers other than a pain-medicine physician examined\n\nhim—do not signal a likelihood of success on the merits of an Eighth Amendment\n\n§ 1983 claim. It is well-settled in this circuit that basic disagreements with\n\nmedical professionals and complaints of failure to be referred to a specialist do\n\nnot satisfy the subjective aspect of a deliberate-indifference claim. See, e.g., Self,\n\n439 F.3d at 1232; Oxendine v. Kaplan, 241 F.3d 1272, 1277 n.7 (10th Cir. 2001);\n\nLedoux v. Davies, 961 F.2d 1536, 1537 (10th Cir. 1992); Ramos v. Lamm, 639\n\nF.2d 559, 575 (10th Cir. 1980).\n\n      Likewise, binding § 1983 medical-care jurisprudence demonstrates that\n\nmere negligent treatment of Mr. White’s alleged injuries by KDOC\n\nemployees—which Mr. White may be asserting, under a reasonable construction\n\nof his amended complaint’s averments—is insufficient to prove the state of mind\n\nthat will give rise to a cognizable constitutional violation. See Farmer, 511 U.S.\n\nat 835; Blackmon, 734 F.3d at 1244–45. Consequently, because Mr. White’s\n\nstatements do not satisfy this mandatory subjective component of our deliberate-\n\nindifference test, it is apparent that they do not demonstrate a likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits with regard to demonstrating a constitutional violation.\n\n      With no reasonable likelihood of prevailing on a claim that any KDOC\n\nemployee had the requisite state of mind to constitute deliberate indifference, we\n\ncannot say that Mr. White has identified a true ongoing constitutional violation\n\n                                          10\n\fupon which a preliminary injunction could be predicated. In other words, we find\n\nthat Mr. White lacks any legal basis to demand that the district court order\n\nSecretary Roberts, acting on behalf of KDOC, to remedy the problem Mr. White\n\nperceives. And we therefore reiterate our view that, due to Mr. White’s failure to\n\nsatisfy the threshold element of our preliminary-injunction test, the district\n\ncourt’s denial of injunctive relief was not infected by any clear legal error. It\n\nfollows ineluctably that the court did not abuse its discretion; we therefore affirm.\n\n                                          C\n\n      Turning to the additional requests lodged by Mr. White in this appeal, we\n\nnote that his request for a COA is not properly before us. A COA is necessary\n\nwhen a litigant wishes to appeal from “the final order in a habeas corpus\n\nproceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a\n\nState court.” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1)(A); see Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322,\n\n335–36 (2003) (“Before an appeal may be entertained, a prisoner who was denied\n\nhabeas relief in the district court must first seek and obtain a COA . . . .”\n\n(emphasis added)). However, because Mr. White’s case is not a habeas\n\nproceeding, it is not subject to the same COA constraints. We therefore dismiss\n\nhis application because no COA is necessary for the determination of this appeal.\n\n      Finally, we address Mr. White’s motion for leave to proceed IFP. We\n\nconclude that Mr. White has not offered any “reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on\n\nthe law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal.” Watkins v. Leyba,\n\n                                          11\n\f543 F.3d 624, 627 (10th Cir. 2008) (emphasis added) (quoting McIntosh v. U.S.\n\nParole Comm’n, 115 F.3d 809, 812 (10th Cir. 1997)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). As a result, we find that he is not entitled to IFP status on appeal and\n\ndeny his motion.\n\n                                         III\n\n      We AFFIRM the district court’s denial of injunctive relief, DISMISS Mr.\n\nWhite’s application for a COA, and DENY leave to proceed IFP. We remind Mr.\n\nWhite that he must continue making payments until the entire balance of his\n\nappellate filing fee is paid.\n\n\n\n                                               Entered for the Court\n\n\n                                               JEROME A.

The specific\n\nclaims advanced in his amended complaint were: (1) that Defendants violated his\n\nrights under the ADA and the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\n\nConstitution by “discrimination and lack of enforcement and/or making policy to\n\nprotect prisoners it has deemed as mentally ill,” R. at 60; (2) that his\n\nconstitutional rights were violated when another prisoner stole his property; (3)\n\nthat KDOC officials were deliberately indifferent to prisoners, and recklessly and\n\nmaliciously harassed them; (4) that KDOC officials were deliberately indifferent\n\nto him by failing to identify officers who allegedly assaulted him during a March\n\n2013 cell extraction; (5) that he received inadequate medical care for injuries he\n\nsustained during that cell extraction and experienced cruel conditions when “held\n\nin isolation” afterward, id. at 62; and (6) that Defendants violated his\n\nconstitutional rights by failing to expedite his administrative grievances. 3\n\n      Approximately one week after submitting his amended complaint, Mr.\n\nWhite filed a document styled “Injunction for Medical Relief,” claiming\n\n“excruciating” and “chronic” ankle and leg pain and asking the district court to\n\n      3\n              Liberally construing the language of the amended complaint, as\ngermane here, Mr. White appears to be seeking injunctive relief from the\nindividual Defendants in their official capacities.

As relevant here,\n\nit concluded that Mr. White’s claims under the ADA (and, liberally construed,\n\nunder the Rehabilitation Act as well) failed to state a claim for relief. It likewise\n\nfound that Mr. White’s remaining claims, construed as arising under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983, should be dismissed with one exception: his claim asserting inadequate\n\nmedical care following his March 2013 cell-extraction injuries. With regard to\n\nthat claim, the court granted Mr. White an additional opportunity to amend his\n\ncomplaint to explain the alleged constitutional violation and his theory of\n\ncausation. The court set a deadline of October 16, 2014, to present a second\n\namended complaint concerning only the claim of constitutionally insufficient\n\nmedical care, noting that failure to amend would subject that claim to dismissal.\n\nFurther, ostensibly in light of its conclusion that Mr. White had deficiently\n\npleaded his medical-care claim, the court denied his motion for injunctive relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\f      Mr. White did not file a second amended complaint.

The first of these factors—likelihood of success on\n\nthe merits—resolves the instant appeal; accordingly, we confine our analysis to\n\nthat issue. Cf. Republican Party of N.M. v. King, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">741</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1089</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1092 (10th Cir.\n\n2013) (resolving disposition of the injunction at the first step of our traditional\n\ntest). Because we find it exceedingly unlikely that Mr. White could prevail on the\n\nmerits of his Eighth Amendment claim, we conclude that the first factor is not\n\nsatisfied. Consequently, there was no legally cognizable predicate for the\n\nissuance of an injunction.\n\n      Based on the allegations in Mr. White’s amended complaint, it is clear that\n\nhis claimed physical injuries date back to March 1, 2013, when he was scheduled\n\nto begin serving fourteen days in administrative segregation for a disciplinary\n\nviolation. By his own admission, Mr. White was forcibly removed from his cell\n\nafter he refused two meals and dove under a bed to avoid the correctional officers\n\nentering his cell. He has said that an officer “grabbed [his] left leg” to extract\n\nhim from underneath the bed, where he “was wedged in pretty tight[ly].” R. at\n\n70.\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f      Mr. White’s amended complaint also states that no prison employee\n\nexamined his leg and ankle when he visited the medical clinic after the cell\n\nextraction, and that he “ha[s] been unable to find out . . . who denied [him]\n\nmedical care for” these ailments. Id. at 71. His allegations of physical injury\n\notherwise bear on the purported failure of Secretary Roberts, as KDOC’s principal\n\nadministrator, to heed approximately twelve requests for pain relief—presumably\n\nby sending a physician Mr. White’s way, or by directing prison employees to\n\nprescribe specific analgesics. Yet, Mr. White has averred, he was permitted to\n\nsee “a nurse or nurse practitioner,” and he received Tylenol and Meloxicam (i.e.,\n\nanother anti-inflammatory medication) to treat his pain. Id. at 79.\n\n      Absent from all of the foregoing averments is any identification by Mr.\n\nWhite of a KDOC employee who knowingly disregarded an excessive risk to his\n\nhealth. See Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 845–46 (1994); Blackmon v.\n\nSutton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">734</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1237</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1244 (10th Cir. 2013). That glaring deficiency forecloses\n\nhim from enunciating a proper claim of Eighth Amendment deliberate\n\nindifference, which has a subjective component under which a plaintiff must show\n\nthat an official (a) was “aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn\n\nthat a substantial risk of serious harm exist[ed]” and (b) drew the inference.

It is well-settled in this circuit that basic disagreements with\n\nmedical professionals and complaints of failure to be referred to a specialist do\n\nnot satisfy the subjective aspect of a deliberate-indifference claim. See, e.g., Self,\n\n439 F.3d at 1232; Oxendine v. Kaplan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"160826\"><a href=\"/opinion/160826/oxendine-v-kaplan/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1272</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1277 n.7 (10th Cir. 2001);\n\nLedoux v.

See Farmer, 511 U.S.\n\nat 835; Blackmon, 734 F.3d at 1244–45. Consequently, because Mr. White’s\n\nstatements do not satisfy this mandatory subjective component of our deliberate-\n\nindifference test, it is apparent that they do not demonstrate a likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits with regard to demonstrating a constitutional violation.\n\n      With no reasonable likelihood of prevailing on a claim that any KDOC\n\nemployee had the requisite state of mind to constitute deliberate indifference, we\n\ncannot say that Mr. White has identified a true ongoing constitutional violation\n\n                                          10\n\fupon which a preliminary injunction could be predicated. In other words, we find\n\nthat Mr. White lacks any legal basis to demand that the district court order\n\nSecretary Roberts, acting on behalf of KDOC, to remedy the problem Mr. White\n\nperceives. And we therefore reiterate our view that, due to Mr. White’s failure to\n\nsatisfy the threshold element of our preliminary-injunction test, the district\n\ncourt’s denial of injunctive relief was not infected by any clear legal error. It\n\nfollows ineluctably that the court did not abuse its discretion; we therefore affirm.\n\n                                          C\n\n      Turning to the additional requests lodged by Mr. White in this appeal, we\n\nnote that his request for a COA is not properly before us. A COA is necessary\n\nwhen a litigant wishes to appeal from “the final order in a habeas corpus\n\nproceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a\n\nState court.” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1)(A); see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122258\"><a href=\"/opinion/122258/miller-el-v-cockrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n335–36 (2003) (“Before an appeal may be entertained, a prisoner who was denied\n\nhabeas relief in the district court must first seek and obtain a COA . . . .”\n\n(emphasis added)). However, because Mr. White’s case is not a habeas\n\nproceeding, it is not subject to the same COA constraints. We therefore dismiss\n\nhis application because no COA is necessary for the determination of this appeal.\n\n      Finally, we address Mr. White’s motion for leave to proceed IFP. We\n\nconclude that Mr. White has not offered any “reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on\n\nthe law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal.” Watkins v.
