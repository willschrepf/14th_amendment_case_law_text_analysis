Penal Code Ann. §§ 12.42(d), 22.01(b)(2)(A) (West 2011). Appellant\nchallenges his conviction in eight issues. In his first two issues, appellant argues\nthat the trial court’s admission of the State’s pretrial motion to revoke appellant’s\njail communication privileges and the order granting the motion violated his\n\ffundamental right to a fair trial because the decision (1) established the trial\njudge’s partiality, and (2) constituted an improper judicial comment on the weight\nof the evidence tainting his presumption of innocence. We overrule both issues\nbecause appellant has not shown that the trial court’s ruling violated his\nfundamental right to an impartial judge or tainted his presumption of innocence. In\nhis third issue, appellant argues the trial court’s admission of the motion and order\nviolated his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights.                  We overrule this issue\nbecause the motion and order were non-testimonial hearsay covered by a firmly\nrooted hearsay exception.\n\n       Appellant asserts in his fourth issue that the trial court erred when it refused\nto allow him to stipulate to the prior convictions. We overrule this issue because\nappellant failed to preserve it for appellate review. In his fifth and sixth issues,\nappellant contends the trial court twice abused its discretion when it admitted\nhearsay evidence. We overrule both issues because the challenged evidence is\ncovered by exceptions to the hearsay rule. Appellant next argues that his trial\ncounsel was ineffective due to an alleged failure to object to extraneous offense\nevidence. Because appellant has not shown that his counsel’s performance was\ndeficient, we overrule this issue. In his eighth issue, appellant asks this court to\nmodify his judgment of conviction by deleting the deadly weapon finding.\nBecause a corrected judgment removing the deadly weapon finding is included in a\nsupplemental clerk’s record, we conclude this issue is moot.1\n\n       In a cross-issue, the State asks this Court to modify appellant’s judgment of\nconviction to reflect the fact that appellant pled true to both punishment\n\n       1\n         Appellant, who is represented by appointed counsel on appeal, filed two pro se briefs in\nthis Court. Because appellant does not have a right to hybrid representation, we do not address\nthe arguments raised in those briefs. Scheanette v. State, 144 S.W.3d 503, 505 n.2 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2004).\n\n                                               2\n\fenhancement paragraphs in the indictment and that the trial court found the\nenhanced paragraphs true.     We sustain this issue, modify the judgment as\nrequested, and affirm the judgment as modified.\n\n                                  BACKGROUND\n\n      Cynthia Todd, the complainant, is the wife or former wife of appellant.\nTodd lived in her mother’s house with her two children by appellant. According to\nTodd, her mother had forbidden appellant from being at the house. Late one\nevening, Todd discovered appellant reaching his arm over a gate in an attempt to\ngain entry into the house’s backyard. Appellant was yelling while attempting to\nopen the gate. In an effort to keep appellant out of the backyard, Todd got a\ngarden hoe from her garage and hit appellant’s arm. After appellant complained\nthat Todd had broken his arm, she opened the gate to help him. Appellant then\ncame into the backyard. Seeing appellant was not injured, Todd and appellant\nbegan arguing. Todd then went into the house, leaving appellant on the back patio.\nAppellant then told Todd that he was having chest pains. Once again believing\nappellant, Todd opened the house door. Appellant grabbed Todd by the neck and\npushed her into a china cabinet inside the house. Appellant then went down a\nhallway and into one of the home’s bedrooms where he remained until the next\nday. Todd stayed in the house because she was concerned appellant would wreck\nthe house if she left.\n\n      The next morning, Todd asked appellant to leave the house. Todd was\nconcerned because her mother was due to arrive at the house in the early afternoon.\nAppellant refused to leave and proceeded to move his work tools from the house’s\ngarage out onto the driveway. Noticing that appellant had left the garage, Todd\ntried to shut the garage door. Appellant saw what Todd was trying to do and\nturned to re-enter the garage, causing the door to hit him in the back. Todd later\n\n                                        3\n\fsaw appellant trying to get into her van. Thinking he was trying to break the back\nwindow of the van, Todd jumped on appellant’s back. Appellant threw Todd off\nof his back, hurting her elbow.\n\n      Ronald Tarvin was driving down the street where Todd lived when he saw a\nman and woman screaming at each other. As he drove by, he saw the man hit the\nwoman and then push her headfirst into the side of a minivan parked in the\ndriveway. Tarvin called the police. Tarvin testified during appellant’s trial but\nwas unable to identify the man he saw hitting the woman.\n\n      Deputy Constable James Cessna was dispatched to investigate a report that\nan assault was in progress. Todd was the only person Cessna saw when he arrived\nat the scene about two minutes later. According to Cessna, Todd was crying,\nbreathing heavily, and appeared very scared. Cessna observed small lacerations on\nTodd’s right forearm. Todd told Cessna that appellant had thrown her into a\nvehicle. Todd also reported that she felt pain as a result of being thrown into the\nvehicle. Todd told Cessna that there had been a shoving match as well. Cessna\ncalled an ambulance for Todd, but she refused treatment once it arrived.\n\n      After talking to Todd, Deputy Cessna found appellant in a neighbor’s\nbackyard. Cessna detained appellant, handcuffed him, and then escorted him to the\nbackseat of his patrol car. Appellant shouted at Todd while he was being escorted\nto the car. After Cessna completed his investigation, he told appellant he was\nunder arrest. Appellant then told Cessna that his chest hurt and he needed an\nambulance. Cessna called an ambulance for appellant and the EMT’s checked\nappellant. After consulting with the EMT’s, Cessna transported appellant to jail.\n\n      At the completion of a one-day trial, the jury found appellant guilty.\nAppellant elected to have the trial court determine his punishment and at the end of\n\n\n                                         4\n\fthe punishment phase of the trial, the trial court sentenced him to 25 years in\nprison. This appeal followed.\n\n                                     ANALYSIS\n\nI.    Appellant has not established that the trial court’s admission of the\n      State’s motion to revoke appellant’s communication privileges and the\n      order granting the motion demonstrated a lack of impartiality.\n      During trial, appellant cross-examined Todd regarding communications\nbetween herself and appellant.      Appellant initiated most, but not all, of the\ncommunications. Appellant’s communications included telephone calls from jail,\nletters, and the mailing of numerous blank non-prosecution affidavits to Todd.\nTodd testified that she eventually filled out one of the affidavits. She went on to\ntestify that she did not have the affidavit notarized before sending it back to\nappellant. Todd further testified that after she sent appellant the unsworn affidavit,\nappellant stopped sending her blank affidavits. Appellant continued sending her\nother mail, however.\n\n      During a break in Todd’s testimony, the State notified the trial court that it\nintended to introduce into evidence a certified copy of the motion seeking to\nsuspend appellant’s jail communication privileges and the trial court’s order\ngranting the motion. After Todd completed her testimony, the State offered the\nmotion and order. Appellant objected that “[t]hese things cut both ways.” The\ntrial court responded that appellant could argue that point, observed that the exhibit\nwas a certified document, and then noted appellant’s objection. Appellant then\nobjected that there was “nobody to cross-examine on the document.” The trial\ncourt replied “[b]ut you can argue it.”\n\n      The motion provides:\n\n             Comes now the State of Texas by and through its Assistant\n\n                                          5\n\f      District Attorney and files this Motion to Order the Sheriff of Harris\n      County to segregate and revoke the Defendant’s ability to\n      communicate, either by phone, e-mail, or letter, outside the Harris\n      County Jail. The State makes this Motion for the witnesses’ safety\n      and to prevent any intimidation of said witnesses. The State moves\n      that the following Defendant be prevented from making phone calls,\n      sending e-mails, or writing letters:\n      (I)   SCOTT SANTSCHI, SPN #01960256\n             The State moves that the above Defendant’s phone call and\n      writing privileges be suspended during the pendency of this case due\n      to the Defendant’s continued violation of the “no contact” order that\n      has been granted in relation to this prosecution.\n      The order granting the motion provides:\n\n            Having considered the State’s Motion to order the Sheriff of\n      Harris County Texas to suspend the following Defendant’s telephone\n      and writing privileges against the following Defendant:\n      (I) SCOTT SANTSCHI, SPN #01960256\n\n      The Court finds that, due to the Defendant’s violation of the no\n      contact order, that the State’s Motion be GRANTED.\n            The Court hereby ORDERS that the Sheriff of Harris County\n      and all its agents to suspend the Defendant’s phone, e-mail and\n      writing privileges during the pendency of this case.\n\n      In his first two issues, appellant argues that the trial court’s judicial act of\nadmitting the State’s motion and the resulting order into evidence demonstrated\njudicial partiality and amounted to an improper comment on the weight of the\nevidence. Appellant, who did not object to the trial court’s admission of the\nmotion and order on either ground, goes on to argue that the trial court’s action\nconstitutes fundamental, structural error requiring no contemporaneous objection\nand no harm analysis. We address each contention in turn.\n\n      As a general rule, in order to preserve a complaint for appellate review, the\n\n                                          6\n\fclaimed error must have been presented in the trial court, thereby providing the\ncourt an opportunity to correct any error during the trial. See Tex. R. App. P.\n33.1(a); Luu v. State, 440 S.W.3d 123, 128 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n2013, no pet.). Absent an objection, a defendant waives error unless the alleged\nerror is fundamental—that is, it creates egregious harm. Luu, 440 S.W.3d at 128\n(citing Powell v. State, 252 S.W.3d 742, 744 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n2008, no pet.)). Egregious harm is such harm that a defendant has not had a fair\nand impartial trial. Powell, 252 S.W.2d at 744.\n\n      We need not decide whether appellant was required to object to the trial\ncourt’s action. Even had appellant objected, the trial court would not have abused\nits discretion in overruling the objection because the record contains no clear\nshowing of bias or partiality by the trial court. Luu, 440 S.W.3d at 128 (citing\nBrumit v. State, 206 S.W.3d 639, 645 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006)).\n\n      A defendant has a fundamental constitutional right to an impartial judge. Id.\nA judge should not act as an advocate or an adversary for any party. Id. To\nreverse a judgment on the ground of improper judicial conduct, we must find (1)\njudicial impropriety was actually committed, and (2) probable prejudice to the\ncomplaining party. Id. Absent a clear showing of bias, a trial court’s actions will\nbe presumed correct. Brumit, 206 S.W.3d at 645. The scope of our review is the\nentire record. Luu, 440 S.W.3d at 129.\n\n      Appellant bases his argument that the trial court was biased against him\nentirely on one evidentiary ruling: the admission of the State’s motion to revoke\nhis communication privileges and the resulting order. In appellant’s view, the trial\ncourt, when it admitted the motion and order, signaled the jury that she had already\npassed judgment on appellant. Judicial rulings almost never constitute a valid\nbasis for a bias or partiality challenge, however. Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S.\n\n                                         7\n\f540, 555 (1994). These rulings “can only in the rarest circumstances evidence the\ndegree of favoritism or antagonism required” to make a fair trial impossible. Id.\nAppellant has cited no case law for the proposition that a trial judge’s act of\nadmitting relevant evidence sufficed to show bias.2 Additionally, the motion and\norder addressed only appellant’s communication privileges while in jail awaiting\ntrial. They did not mention the charge against appellant or the State’s evidence\nagainst appellant, nor did they express the trial court’s opinion on appellant’s guilt\nor innocence. We hold that appellant has not made a clear showing that the trial\ncourt was biased against him and overrule his first issue. See Celis v. State, 354\nS.W.3d 7, 24–25 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi), aff’d 416 S.W.3d 419 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2013) (rejecting bias argument based in part on trial court’s evidentiary\nrulings).\n\nII.    Appellant has not established that the trial court’s admission of exhibits\n       functioned as an improper comment on the weight of the evidence that\n       tainted his presumption of innocence.\n       Appellant contends in his second issue that the trial court commented on the\nweight of the evidence by admitting three different types of documents into\nevidence, thereby tainting his presumption of innocence in front of the jury.\nAppellant specifically complains about the admission of blank affidavits of non-\nprosecution, envelopes appellant addressed and mailed to Todd, and the previously\nmentioned motion to suspend appellant’s communication privileges and\nsubsequent order.         Conceding he did not object to the admission of these\ndocuments on this basis, appellant asserts the error is fundamental error requiring\nno contemporaneous objection.3\n\n\n       2\n         Appellant did not object in the trial court to the admission of the motion and order based\non lack of relevance.\n       3\n           Although he does not cite Gordon v. State, appellant appears to rely on the principle\n                                                8\n\f       Appellant cites no authority for the proposition that a trial court’s act of\nadmitting documents into evidence can constitute an improper comment on the\nweight of the evidence, much less one that taints a defendant’s presumption of\ninnocence. Appellant instead relies on Blue v. State, 41 S.W.3d 129, 131 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2000), which addressed a trial court’s comment to the venire that the\ndefendant had attempted to enter into a plea bargain with the State and that the trial\ncourt would have preferred a guilty plea. A plurality of the Court of Criminal\nAppeals determined that this comment vitiated the presumption of innocence\nbefore the venire, constituted fundamental error, and therefore required no\nobjection. Id. at 132–33.\n\n       The Court of Criminal Appeals has determined that the Blue decision has no\nprecedential value, but it can be considered for any persuasive value it might have.\nUnkart v. State, 400 S.W.3d 94, 101 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). We conclude Blue\ndoes not support a reversal in this case because the circumstances in the present\ncase differ dramatically from those in Blue.\n\n       In the present case, the trial court exercised its discretion to admit evidence\nthe State offered in response to appellant’s cross-examination of Todd. The trial\ncourt made no comments in front of the jury regarding the evidence, it merely\nadmitted the documents into evidence in response to the State’s offer. This ruling\nis far different from the comments made by the trial judge in Blue that he would\nprefer the defendant to plead guilty. 41 S.W.3d at 130. We hold that the trial\ncourt’s act of admitting the evidence at issue here did not impermissibly tread on\nappellant’s presumption of innocence. See Jasper v. State, 61 S.W.3d 413, 421\nstated therein that “while there appears to be no explicitly stated rule or approach, courts tend to\ndetermine whether or not the trial court’s comments impermissibly tread upon a defendant’s\npresumption of innocence. If so, then no objection is necessary, and there is error; if not, then\nthere is no error regardless of whether appellant objected.” 191 S.W.3d 721, 726 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2006, no pet.).\n\n                                                 9\n\f(Tex. Crim. App. 2001) (rejecting contention trial court’s exercise of discretion to\nmaintain control and expedite trial negatively impacted defendant’s presumption of\ninnocence); Edmondson v. State, No. 14-14-00537-CR, 2015 WL 1735775, at *3\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] April 14, 2015, no pet.) (mem. op., not\ndesignated for publication) (rejecting argument that trial court’s comments\nimpermissibly tread upon defendant’s presumption of innocence because\ndefendant’s counsel had “opened the door to testimony about revocation of\n[defendant’s] probation.”). We overrule appellant’s second issue.\n\nIII.   The trial court’s admission of the State’s motion to revoke appellant’s\n       communication privileges and the order granting the motion did not\n       violate appellant’s confrontation rights.\n       In his third issue, appellant complains that the trial court’s admission of the\nmotion to suspend his communication privileges and the order granting the motion\nviolated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. The motion and order are\nquoted above. The State responds that the trial court’s admission of certified\ncopies of these court records did not violate appellant’s confrontation rights\nbecause they are non-testimonial. We agree with the State.\n\n       The Sixth Amendment provides that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused\nshall have the right to be confronted by the witnesses against him. U.S. Const.\namend. VI. In Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 51, (2004), the Supreme\nCourt of the United States held that the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation\napplies not only to in-court testimony, but also to out-of-court statements that are\ntestimonial in nature. Wood v. State, 299 S.W.3d 200, 207 (Tex. App.—Austin\n2009, pet. ref’d) (citing Crawford, 541 U.S. at 51). The Confrontation Clause\nforbids the admission of testimonial hearsay unless the declarant is unavailable to\ntestify and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.\nId. Crawford did not extend this protection to non-testimonial hearsay. Ford v.\n                                          10\n\fState, 179 S.W.3d 203, 209 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. ref’d).\nWhether a particular out-of-court statement is testimonial is a question of law. Lee\nv. State, 418 S.W.3d 892, 895–96 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, pet.\nref’d).\n\n          Admission of evidence that falls within a firmly rooted exception to the\nhearsay rule does not violate the Confrontation Clause. Ford, 179 S.W.3d at 209.\nThe public records exception applies to records of public offices or agencies\nsetting forth the activities of the agency. Id. This is a firmly rooted exception to\nthe hearsay rule. Id. We conclude the trial court’s admission of the certified copy\nof the State’s motion and the trial court’s order did not violate appellant’s Sixth\nAmendment right to confront the witnesses against him because the records are\nnon-testimonial hearsay.        See id. (holding defendant’s disciplinary records\ncontaining “sterile recitations of [defendant’s] offenses and the punishments he\nreceived for those offenses” were non-testimonial and fell within a well-recognized\nhearsay exception); see also Grant v. State, 218 S.W.3d 225, 232 n.3 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. ref’d) (concluding that “[o]ur holding in Ford”\ngoverns admission of “[t]he portions of [school] records simply listing the alleged\ndisciplinary infraction, the punishment received, the dates of the offenses or\npunishments, and the names of the school authorities involved”). We overrule\nappellant’s third issue.\n\nIV.       Appellant failed to preserve his fourth issue for appellate review.\n\n          In his fourth issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred when it\nallegedly refused to allow him to stipulate to his prior conviction for assault of a\nfamily member. The State asserts appellant failed to preserve this issue because he\nfailed to bring his desire to stipulate to the trial court’s attention. We agree with\nthe State.\n\n                                           11\n\f       If a defendant stipulates to prior offenses used as jurisdictional\nenhancements, a trial court should not permit the admission of evidence of the\nprior convictions during the guilt/innocence phase because the danger of unfair\nprejudice from the introduction of such evidence substantially outweighs its\nprobative value. Hernandez v. State, 109 S.W.3d 491, 494 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2003). As a prerequisite to presenting a complaint for appellate review, the record\nmust show that the complaint was made to the trial court by a timely request,\nobjection, or motion. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1). Having reviewed the record, we\nhave not found any indication appellant (1) made an unequivocal request to the\ntrial court to stipulate to his prior assault conviction; (2) sought a ruling from the\ntrial court on whether he could stipulate to the prior conviction; or (3) objected to\nthe State’s evidence of his prior conviction on this basis.4 There is also nothing in\nthe record showing that the trial court made a ruling denying appellant the\nopportunity to stipulate to the prior conviction. We therefore conclude appellant\nfailed to preserve his fourth issue for appellate review, and we overrule that issue.\n\nV.     The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted evidence\n       over appellant’s hearsay objection.\n       In his fifth and sixth issues, appellant contends the trial court abused its\ndiscretion when it admitted two different items of evidence over his hearsay\nobjection. First, he challenges the admission of Deputy Cessna’s testimony that\nTodd told him appellant threw her into a vehicle and that she felt pain as a result.\nSecond, appellant complains about the admission of the business records of the\n\n\n\n       4\n          Appellant cites to a statement by his counsel that if the State’s fingerprint expert\ntestified appellant’s fingerprint matched the print from the prior conviction, appellant would\nstipulate to that fact. But counsel clarified that he “d[id]n’t have a problem with [testimony\nabout] the jurisdictional – the jury already knows about the jurisdictional allegation. So there are\nno issues.”\n\n                                                12\n\fWest I-10 Fire Department, which sent an ambulance to the scene in response to\nCessna’s requests.\n\n      A.     Standard of review and applicable law\n\n      We review a trial court’s decision to admit evidence for an abuse of\ndiscretion. Zuliani v. State, 97 S.W.3d 589, 595 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). A trial\ncourt abuses its discretion only if “the trial judge’s decision was so clearly wrong\nas to lie outside that zone within which reasonable persons might disagree.” Cantu\nv. State, 842 S.W.2d 667, 682 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992).            If the trial court’s\nevidentiary ruling was correct on any theory of law applicable to that ruling, we\nmust affirm the ruling. Gomez v. State, 380 S.W.3d 830, 836 n.9 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2012, pet. ref’d) (citing De La Paz v. State, 279 S.W.3d 336,\n344 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009).\n\n      The Texas Rules of Evidence define hearsay as a statement, other than one\nmade by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered into evidence\nto prove the truth of the matter asserted. Tex. R. Evid. 801(d). Although hearsay\nis generally inadmissible, Rule 802 provides that inadmissible hearsay admitted\nwithout objection may not be denied probative value merely because it is hearsay.\nTex. R. Evid. 802.\n\n      A record of an act, event, condition, opinion, or diagnosis—commonly\ncalled a “business record”—is admissible hearsay if: (1) the record was made at or\nnear the time by—or from information transmitted by—someone with knowledge;\n(2) the record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity;\n(3) making the record was a regular practice of that activity; (4) all of these\nconditions are shown by the testimony, affidavit, or unsworn declaration of the\ncustodian or another qualified witness; and (5) the opponent fails to demonstrate\nthat the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation\n                                         13\n\findicate a lack of trustworthiness. Tex. R. Evid. 803(6). “Business” includes\nevery kind of regularly organized activity whether or not conducted for profit. Id.\n\nB.     Appellant did not preserve his fifth issue for appellate review.\n       In his fifth issue, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion\nwhen it admitted Deputy Cessna’s testimony that Todd told him she felt pain after\nappellant threw her into a vehicle. Appellant asserts that he lodged a hearsay\nobjection to the testimony. Having reviewed the record, we disagree. To preserve\nerror, a party must object every time the allegedly inadmissible testimony is\noffered.    Ethington v. State, 819 S.W.2d 854, 858 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).\nAppellant did not object to the State’s question regarding Todd feeling pain, or to\nCessna’s answer that she did. Rather, he objected only to the State’s previous\nquestion regarding what Todd told Cessna about what happened. Appellant’s\nfailure to object to the pain question and answer waives any hearsay challenge to\nthe challenged testimony. Id. We overrule appellant’s fifth issue.\n\n       C.     The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it overruled\n              appellant’s hearsay objection to the fire department records.\n       Appellant complains in his sixth issue that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion when it overruled his hearsay objection to the admission of the West I-\n10 Fire Department records. Appellant objected at trial that the entire collection of\nrecords at issue was inadmissible hearsay and could not be admitted through\nDeputy Cessna.\n\n       As just discussed, records of regularly conducted business activity are\nadmissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. Tex. R. Evid. 803(6).5 Because the\n\n       5\n         See also Lee v. State, 779 S.W.2d 913, 917 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1989, pet.\nref’d) (“Rules 803(6) and 902(10) operate together to permit a party to introduce admissible\nbusiness records without the testimony of a ‘live’ witness.”). Appellant did not complain in the\ntrial court and does not complain on appeal that the requirements for self-authentication\n                                              14\n\frecords and the accompanying records affidavit meet the requirements of Rule\n803(6), we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the\nrecords over appellant’s hearsay objection. To the extent appellant argues on\nappeal that the records were inadmissible because they contained hearsay within\nhearsay, he did not make this objection in the trial court and has not preserved that\nargument for appellate review. Ponce v. State, 89 S.W.3d 110, 120 n.8 (Tex.\nApp.—Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.). We overrule appellant’s sixth issue.\n\nVI.   Appellant has not shown that his trial counsel performed deficiently by\n      failing to make certain objections.\n      Appellant contends in his seventh issue that his trial counsel rendered\nineffective assistance by failing to object, properly object, or request an instruction\nto disregard a part of the State’s opening statement, certain portions of trial\ntestimony, and a single exhibit. The State responds that appellant has not shown\nthat his trial counsel’s performance was deficient. We agree with the State.\n\n      A.     Standard of review and applicable law\n\n      We review a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under the two-\npronged standard of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).\nAppellant must first establish that counsel’s performance was deficient. Id. This\nrequires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not\nfunctioning as the “counsel” the Sixth Amendment guarantees.               Id.   Second,\nappellant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. Id.\nThis requires showing that counsel’s errors were so serious as to deprive the\ndefendant of a fair trial. Id.\n\n      Appellant has the burden to prove ineffective assistance of counsel by a\n\ncontained in Rule 902(10) were not met. His only objection was that the records themselves\nwere hearsay.\n\n                                           15\n\fpreponderance of the evidence. Thompson v. State, 9 S.W.3d 808, 813 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 1999).     To defeat the strong presumption of reasonable professional\nassistance, any allegation of ineffectiveness must be firmly founded in the record,\nand the record must affirmatively demonstrate the alleged ineffectiveness.\nMcFarland v. State, 928 S.W.2d 482, 500 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).\n\n      An appellate court looks to the totality of the representation, rather than an\nisolated act or omission, in evaluating the effectiveness of counsel. Ex Parte\nFelton, 815 S.W.2d 733, 735 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991). Although it is possible that\na single egregious error by counsel can constitute ineffective assistance, Texas\ncourts have been hesitant to “designate any error as per se ineffective assistance of\ncounsel as a matter of law.” Thompson, 9 S.W.3d at 813 (quoting Jackson v. State,\n766 S.W.2d 504, 508 (Tex. Crim. App. 1985)). An appellate court should be\nespecially hesitant to declare counsel ineffective based upon a single alleged\nmiscalculation during what amounts to otherwise satisfactory representation,\nespecially when the record provides no discernible explanation of the motivation\nbehind counsel’s actions—whether those actions were of strategic design or the\nresult of negligent conduct.    Id. at 814.   Ordinarily, counsel should have an\nopportunity to explain his or her actions or inactions before being held ineffective.\nRylander v. State, 101 S.W.3d 107, 111 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003).\n\n      Appellant’s claim is based on an omission: his counsel’s failure to object,\nproperly object, or request an instruction to disregard certain witness testimony and\nexhibits. The record is silent as to why appellant’s trial counsel acted the way he\ndid because appellant did not file a motion for new trial. To satisfy the first prong\nof Strickland on a silent record, it must be apparent “that counsel’s performance\nfell below an objective standard of reasonableness as a matter of law, and that no\nreasonable trial strategy could justify trial counsel’s acts or omissions, regardless\n\n                                         16\n\fof his or her subjective reasoning.” Lopez v. State, 343 S.W.3d 137, 143 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2011); see also Goodspeed v. State, 187 S.W.3d 390, 392 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2005) (conduct “so outrageous that no competent attorney would have\nengaged in it”). As we explain below, this is not such a case, as it is possible the\nalleged omissions by appellant’s trial counsel were based on a reasonable trial\nstrategy.\n\n      B.     Appellant has not shown that the record is sufficient to overcome\n             the presumption of competence.\n      Appellant complains that the jury heard six times about extraneous acts by\nappellant as a result of his trial counsel’s deficient performance. See Tex. R. Evid.\n404(b). We address each contention in turn.\n\n      Appellant first complains about his trial counsel’s failure to object to the\nState’s comment during its opening statement that Deputy Cessna is “going to tell\nyou that he knows [appellant] and Cynthia Todd.” Even if we assume that the\nState’s comment was objectionable, we conclude on this record that appellant has\nnot overcome the strong presumption that his counsel’s failure to object fell within\nthe wide range of reasonable professional assistance.       It is possible that trial\ncounsel was motivated by a reasonable trial strategy to not object to this comment\nby the State because he did not want to draw additional, potentially negative,\nattention to the ambiguous comment. See Orellana v. State, 489 S.W.3d 537, 550\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2016, pet. ref’d).\n\n      Appellant next complains about his trial counsel’s alleged failure to object\nproperly to a statement found in the fire department records that “enforcement\nstates this is fairly normal behavior for [appellant]. They have a prior history of—”\nDespite appellant’s contention otherwise, his trial counsel did object to this\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\fstatement and the trial court redacted the challenged phrase before it was sent back\nto the jury.\n\n       In his third complaint, appellant argues that his trial counsel’s failure to\nrequest an instruction to disregard Todd’s testimony that appellant “was paroled\nout to my address” constitutes deficient performance. Appellant’s trial counsel did\nobject to this testimony by Todd and the trial court sustained the objection.\nAppellant is correct, however, that his trial counsel did not ask the trial court to\ninstruct the jury to disregard the testimony. Appellant also complains about his\ntrial counsel’s failure to request an instruction to disregard Todd’s testimony that\nappellant had dented her garage door on a different date by running his truck\nthrough the garage.     We conclude appellant’s trial counsel could have been\nmotivated by a reasonable trial strategy in both situations as he did not want to call\nadditional attention to challenged testimony. See Agbogwe v. State, 414 S.W.3d\n820, 838 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2013, no pet.) (concluding failure to\nrequest limiting instruction after trial court sustained objection could have been\nmotivated by reasonable trial strategy to prevent further attention being drawn to\nobjectionable testimony).\n\n       Appellant’s fifth complaint concerns his trial counsel’s alleged failure to\nrequest an instruction to disregard Todd’s testimony: “It’s been too long ago.\nThere’s been too many fights.” Appellant misapprehends the record. His trial\ncounsel did object to this testimony, and the trial court sustained the objection and\ninstructed the jury to disregard the testimony in response to trial counsel’s request.\nTrial counsel did exactly what appellant suggests on appeal he should have done;\nthere was no deficient performance.\n\n       Finally, appellant complains that his trial counsel’s performance was\ndeficient because of the admission of the State’s motion to suspend his\n\n                                         18\n\fcommunication privileges and the order granting the motion. Appellant’s trial\ncounsel objected to the admission of these two documents. Appellant offers no\nspecific argument on appeal as to how his trial counsel’s performance regarding\nthese documents was deficient.6\n\n       In sum, appellant has not met his burden to show that his counsel’s\nperformance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. On this record,\ntherefore, we conclude appellant has failed to prove his claim of ineffective\nassistance under Strickland. We overrule appellant’s seventh issue.\n\nVII. The judgment of conviction should be modified to reflect the correct\n     enhancements.\n       In a cross-issue on appeal, the State asks this Court to modify the corrected\nJudgment of Conviction by Jury dated August 26, 2015 to reflect that appellant\npled true to both punishment-enhancement paragraphs and the fact that the trial\ncourt found the enhancement paragraphs true. A court of appeals may modify a\ntrial court’s judgment to correct an error when the matter has been called to the\ncourt’s attention by any source. Barfield v. State, 464 S.W.3d 67, 84 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2015, pet. ref’d).             Because the record establishes that\nappellant pled true to both punishment-enhancement paragraphs and that the trial\ncourt found both paragraphs true, we modify the trial court’s judgment\naccordingly. Id.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          Appellant’s argument, in its entirety, states: “In each case, appellant’s trial counsel\neither did not properly object or did not request an instruction that the jury disregard the\nevidence. There can be no strategic reasoning for this failure to object or failure to request an\ninstruction.”\n\n                                               19\n\f                                   CONCLUSION\n\n      Having overruled all issues raised by appellant in this appeal, we affirm the\ntrial court’s corrected judgment as modified.\n\n\n\n\n                                      /s/       J.

Penal Code Ann. §§ 12.42(d), 22.01(b)(2)(A) (West 2011). Appellant\nchallenges his conviction in eight issues. In his first two issues, appellant argues\nthat the trial court’s admission of the State’s pretrial motion to revoke appellant’s\njail communication privileges and the order granting the motion violated his\n\ffundamental right to a fair trial because the decision (1) established the trial\njudge’s partiality, and (2) constituted an improper judicial comment on the weight\nof the evidence tainting his presumption of innocence. We overrule both issues\nbecause appellant has not shown that the trial court’s ruling violated his\nfundamental right to an impartial judge or tainted his presumption of innocence. In\nhis third issue, appellant argues the trial court’s admission of the motion and order\nviolated his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights.                  We overrule this issue\nbecause the motion and order were non-testimonial hearsay covered by a firmly\nrooted hearsay exception.\n\n       Appellant asserts in his fourth issue that the trial court erred when it refused\nto allow him to stipulate to the prior convictions. We overrule this issue because\nappellant failed to preserve it for appellate review. In his fifth and sixth issues,\nappellant contends the trial court twice abused its discretion when it admitted\nhearsay evidence. We overrule both issues because the challenged evidence is\ncovered by exceptions to the hearsay rule. Appellant next argues that his trial\ncounsel was ineffective due to an alleged failure to object to extraneous offense\nevidence. Because appellant has not shown that his counsel’s performance was\ndeficient, we overrule this issue. In his eighth issue, appellant asks this court to\nmodify his judgment of conviction by deleting the deadly weapon finding.\nBecause a corrected judgment removing the deadly weapon finding is included in a\nsupplemental clerk’s record, we conclude this issue is moot.1\n\n       In a cross-issue, the State asks this Court to modify appellant’s judgment of\nconviction to reflect the fact that appellant pled true to both punishment\n\n       1\n         Appellant, who is represented by appointed counsel on appeal, filed two pro se briefs in\nthis Court. Because appellant does not have a right to hybrid representation, we do not address\nthe arguments raised in those briefs. Scheanette v.

We sustain this issue, modify the judgment as\nrequested, and affirm the judgment as modified.\n\n                                  BACKGROUND\n\n      Cynthia Todd, the complainant, is the wife or former wife of appellant.\nTodd lived in her mother’s house with her two children by appellant. According to\nTodd, her mother had forbidden appellant from being at the house. Late one\nevening, Todd discovered appellant reaching his arm over a gate in an attempt to\ngain entry into the house’s backyard. Appellant was yelling while attempting to\nopen the gate. In an effort to keep appellant out of the backyard, Todd got a\ngarden hoe from her garage and hit appellant’s arm. After appellant complained\nthat Todd had broken his arm, she opened the gate to help him. Appellant then\ncame into the backyard. Seeing appellant was not injured, Todd and appellant\nbegan arguing. Todd then went into the house, leaving appellant on the back patio.\nAppellant then told Todd that he was having chest pains. Once again believing\nappellant, Todd opened the house door. Appellant grabbed Todd by the neck and\npushed her into a china cabinet inside the house. Appellant then went down a\nhallway and into one of the home’s bedrooms where he remained until the next\nday. Todd stayed in the house because she was concerned appellant would wreck\nthe house if she left.\n\n      The next morning, Todd asked appellant to leave the house. Todd was\nconcerned because her mother was due to arrive at the house in the early afternoon.\nAppellant refused to leave and proceeded to move his work tools from the house’s\ngarage out onto the driveway. Noticing that appellant had left the garage, Todd\ntried to shut the garage door. Appellant saw what Todd was trying to do and\nturned to re-enter the garage, causing the door to hit him in the back. Todd later\n\n                                        3\n\fsaw appellant trying to get into her van. Thinking he was trying to break the back\nwindow of the van, Todd jumped on appellant’s back. Appellant threw Todd off\nof his back, hurting her elbow.\n\n      Ronald Tarvin was driving down the street where Todd lived when he saw a\nman and woman screaming at each other. As he drove by, he saw the man hit the\nwoman and then push her headfirst into the side of a minivan parked in the\ndriveway. Tarvin called the police. Tarvin testified during appellant’s trial but\nwas unable to identify the man he saw hitting the woman.\n\n      Deputy Constable James Cessna was dispatched to investigate a report that\nan assault was in progress. Todd was the only person Cessna saw when he arrived\nat the scene about two minutes later. According to Cessna, Todd was crying,\nbreathing heavily, and appeared very scared. Cessna observed small lacerations on\nTodd’s right forearm. Todd told Cessna that appellant had thrown her into a\nvehicle. Todd also reported that she felt pain as a result of being thrown into the\nvehicle. Todd told Cessna that there had been a shoving match as well. Cessna\ncalled an ambulance for Todd, but she refused treatment once it arrived.\n\n      After talking to Todd, Deputy Cessna found appellant in a neighbor’s\nbackyard. Cessna detained appellant, handcuffed him, and then escorted him to the\nbackseat of his patrol car. Appellant shouted at Todd while he was being escorted\nto the car. After Cessna completed his investigation, he told appellant he was\nunder arrest. Appellant then told Cessna that his chest hurt and he needed an\nambulance. Cessna called an ambulance for appellant and the EMT’s checked\nappellant. After consulting with the EMT’s, Cessna transported appellant to jail.\n\n      At the completion of a one-day trial, the jury found appellant guilty.\nAppellant elected to have the trial court determine his punishment and at the end of\n\n\n                                         4\n\fthe punishment phase of the trial, the trial court sentenced him to 25 years in\nprison. This appeal followed.\n\n                                     ANALYSIS\n\nI.    Appellant has not established that the trial court’s admission of the\n      State’s motion to revoke appellant’s communication privileges and the\n      order granting the motion demonstrated a lack of impartiality.\n      During trial, appellant cross-examined Todd regarding communications\nbetween herself and appellant.      Appellant initiated most, but not all, of the\ncommunications. Appellant’s communications included telephone calls from jail,\nletters, and the mailing of numerous blank non-prosecution affidavits to Todd.\nTodd testified that she eventually filled out one of the affidavits. She went on to\ntestify that she did not have the affidavit notarized before sending it back to\nappellant. Todd further testified that after she sent appellant the unsworn affidavit,\nappellant stopped sending her blank affidavits. Appellant continued sending her\nother mail, however.\n\n      During a break in Todd’s testimony, the State notified the trial court that it\nintended to introduce into evidence a certified copy of the motion seeking to\nsuspend appellant’s jail communication privileges and the trial court’s order\ngranting the motion. After Todd completed her testimony, the State offered the\nmotion and order. Appellant objected that “[t]hese things cut both ways.” The\ntrial court responded that appellant could argue that point, observed that the exhibit\nwas a certified document, and then noted appellant’s objection. Appellant then\nobjected that there was “nobody to cross-examine on the document.” The trial\ncourt replied “[b]ut you can argue it.”\n\n      The motion provides:\n\n             Comes now the State of Texas by and through its Assistant\n\n                                          5\n\f      District Attorney and files this Motion to Order the Sheriff of Harris\n      County to segregate and revoke the Defendant’s ability to\n      communicate, either by phone, e-mail, or letter, outside the Harris\n      County Jail. The State makes this Motion for the witnesses’ safety\n      and to prevent any intimidation of said witnesses. The State moves\n      that the following Defendant be prevented from making phone calls,\n      sending e-mails, or writing letters:\n      (I)   SCOTT SANTSCHI, SPN #01960256\n             The State moves that the above Defendant’s phone call and\n      writing privileges be suspended during the pendency of this case due\n      to the Defendant’s continued violation of the “no contact” order that\n      has been granted in relation to this prosecution.\n      The order granting the motion provides:\n\n            Having considered the State’s Motion to order the Sheriff of\n      Harris County Texas to suspend the following Defendant’s telephone\n      and writing privileges against the following Defendant:\n      (I) SCOTT SANTSCHI, SPN #01960256\n\n      The Court finds that, due to the Defendant’s violation of the no\n      contact order, that the State’s Motion be GRANTED.\n            The Court hereby ORDERS that the Sheriff of Harris County\n      and all its agents to suspend the Defendant’s phone, e-mail and\n      writing privileges during the pendency of this case.\n\n      In his first two issues, appellant argues that the trial court’s judicial act of\nadmitting the State’s motion and the resulting order into evidence demonstrated\njudicial partiality and amounted to an improper comment on the weight of the\nevidence. Appellant, who did not object to the trial court’s admission of the\nmotion and order on either ground, goes on to argue that the trial court’s action\nconstitutes fundamental, structural error requiring no contemporaneous objection\nand no harm analysis.

In appellant’s view, the trial\ncourt, when it admitted the motion and order, signaled the jury that she had already\npassed judgment on appellant. Judicial rulings almost never constitute a valid\nbasis for a bias or partiality challenge, however. Liteky v.

Appellant has not established that the trial court’s admission of exhibits\n       functioned as an improper comment on the weight of the evidence that\n       tainted his presumption of innocence.\n       Appellant contends in his second issue that the trial court commented on the\nweight of the evidence by admitting three different types of documents into\nevidence, thereby tainting his presumption of innocence in front of the jury.\nAppellant specifically complains about the admission of blank affidavits of non-\nprosecution, envelopes appellant addressed and mailed to Todd, and the previously\nmentioned motion to suspend appellant’s communication privileges and\nsubsequent order.         Conceding he did not object to the admission of these\ndocuments on this basis, appellant asserts the error is fundamental error requiring\nno contemporaneous objection.3\n\n\n       2\n         Appellant did not object in the trial court to the admission of the motion and order based\non lack of relevance.\n       3\n           Although he does not cite Gordon v.

The trial\ncourt made no comments in front of the jury regarding the evidence, it merely\nadmitted the documents into evidence in response to the State’s offer. This ruling\nis far different from the comments made by the trial judge in Blue that he would\nprefer the defendant to plead guilty. 41 S.W.3d at 130.

We therefore conclude appellant\nfailed to preserve his fourth issue for appellate review, and we overrule that issue.\n\nV.     The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted evidence\n       over appellant’s hearsay objection.\n       In his fifth and sixth issues, appellant contends the trial court abused its\ndiscretion when it admitted two different items of evidence over his hearsay\nobjection. First, he challenges the admission of Deputy Cessna’s testimony that\nTodd told him appellant threw her into a vehicle and that she felt pain as a result.\nSecond, appellant complains about the admission of the business records of the\n\n\n\n       4\n          Appellant cites to a statement by his counsel that if the State’s fingerprint expert\ntestified appellant’s fingerprint matched the print from the prior conviction, appellant would\nstipulate to that fact.

An appellate court should be\nespecially hesitant to declare counsel ineffective based upon a single alleged\nmiscalculation during what amounts to otherwise satisfactory representation,\nespecially when the record provides no discernible explanation of the motivation\nbehind counsel’s actions—whether those actions were of strategic design or the\nresult of negligent conduct.    Id. at 814.   Ordinarily, counsel should have an\nopportunity to explain his or her actions or inactions before being held ineffective.\nRylander v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1634900\"><a href=\"/opinion/1634900/rylander-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 111 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003).\n\n      Appellant’s claim is based on an omission: his counsel’s failure to object,\nproperly object, or request an instruction to disregard certain witness testimony and\nexhibits. The record is silent as to why appellant’s trial counsel acted the way he\ndid because appellant did not file a motion for new trial. To satisfy the first prong\nof Strickland on a silent record, it must be apparent “that counsel’s performance\nfell below an objective standard of reasonableness as a matter of law, and that no\nreasonable trial strategy could justify trial counsel’s acts or omissions, regardless\n\n                                         16\n\fof his or her subjective reasoning.” Lopez v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2542207\"><a href=\"/opinion/2542207/lopez-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 143 (Tex.\nCrim.

State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2102530\"><a href=\"/opinion/2102530/goodspeed-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 392 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2005) (conduct “so outrageous that no competent attorney would have\nengaged in it”). As we explain below, this is not such a case, as it is possible the\nalleged omissions by appellant’s trial counsel were based on a reasonable trial\nstrategy.\n\n      B.     Appellant has not shown that the record is sufficient to overcome\n             the presumption of competence.\n      Appellant complains that the jury heard six times about extraneous acts by\nappellant as a result of his trial counsel’s deficient performance. See Tex. R. Evid.\n404(b). We address each contention in turn.\n\n      Appellant first complains about his trial counsel’s failure to object to the\nState’s comment during its opening statement that Deputy Cessna is “going to tell\nyou that he knows [appellant] and Cynthia Todd.” Even if we assume that the\nState’s comment was objectionable, we conclude on this record that appellant has\nnot overcome the strong presumption that his counsel’s failure to object fell within\nthe wide range of reasonable professional assistance.       It is possible that trial\ncounsel was motivated by a reasonable trial strategy to not object to this comment\nby the State because he did not want to draw additional, potentially negative,\nattention to the ambiguous comment. See Orellana v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 550\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2016, pet. ref’d).\n\n      Appellant next complains about his trial counsel’s alleged failure to object\nproperly to a statement found in the fire department records that “enforcement\nstates this is fairly normal behavior for [appellant]. They have a prior history of—”\nDespite appellant’s contention otherwise, his trial counsel did object to this\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\fstatement and the trial court redacted the challenged phrase before it was sent back\nto the jury.\n\n       In his third complaint, appellant argues that his trial counsel’s failure to\nrequest an instruction to disregard Todd’s testimony that appellant “was paroled\nout to my address” constitutes deficient performance. Appellant’s trial counsel did\nobject to this testimony by Todd and the trial court sustained the objection.\nAppellant is correct, however, that his trial counsel did not ask the trial court to\ninstruct the jury to disregard the testimony. Appellant also complains about his\ntrial counsel’s failure to request an instruction to disregard Todd’s testimony that\nappellant had dented her garage door on a different date by running his truck\nthrough the garage.     We conclude appellant’s trial counsel could have been\nmotivated by a reasonable trial strategy in both situations as he did not want to call\nadditional attention to challenged testimony. See Agbogwe v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">820</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 838 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2013, no pet.) (concluding failure to\nrequest limiting instruction after trial court sustained objection could have been\nmotivated by reasonable trial strategy to prevent further attention being drawn to\nobjectionable testimony).\n\n       Appellant’s fifth complaint concerns his trial counsel’s alleged failure to\nrequest an instruction to disregard Todd’s testimony: “It’s been too long ago.\nThere’s been too many fights.” Appellant misapprehends the record. His trial\ncounsel did object to this testimony, and the trial court sustained the objection and\ninstructed the jury to disregard the testimony in response to trial counsel’s request.\nTrial counsel did exactly what appellant suggests on appeal he should have done;\nthere was no deficient performance.\n\n       Finally, appellant complains that his trial counsel’s performance was\ndeficient because of the admission of the State’s motion to suspend his\n\n                                         18\n\fcommunication privileges and the order granting the motion. Appellant’s trial\ncounsel objected to the admission of these two documents. Appellant offers no\nspecific argument on appeal as to how his trial counsel’s performance regarding\nthese documents was deficient.6\n\n       In sum, appellant has not met his burden to show that his counsel’s\nperformance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. On this record,\ntherefore, we conclude appellant has failed to prove his claim of ineffective\nassistance under Strickland. We overrule appellant’s seventh issue.\n\nVII. The judgment of conviction should be modified to reflect the correct\n     enhancements.\n       In a cross-issue on appeal, the State asks this Court to modify the corrected\nJudgment of Conviction by Jury dated August 26, 2015 to reflect that appellant\npled true to both punishment-enhancement paragraphs and the fact that the trial\ncourt found the enhancement paragraphs true. A court of appeals may modify a\ntrial court’s judgment to correct an error when the matter has been called to the\ncourt’s attention by any source. Barfield v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2015, pet. ref’d).             Because the record establishes that\nappellant pled true to both punishment-enhancement paragraphs and that the trial\ncourt found both paragraphs true, we modify the trial court’s judgment\naccordingly. Id.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          Appellant’s argument, in its entirety, states: “In each case, appellant’s trial counsel\neither did not properly object or did not request an instruction that the jury disregard the\nevidence. There can be no strategic reasoning for this failure to object or failure to request an\ninstruction.”\n\n                                               19\n\f                                   CONCLUSION\n\n      Having overruled all issues raised by appellant in this appeal, we affirm the\ntrial court’s corrected judgment as modified.\n\n\n\n\n                                      /s/       J.
