From 2008 to 2012, Kevin Stuckey\nworked as a sales manager for the auto-parts retailer Auto-\nZone, Inc. During his four years with the company, Stuckey\nwas transferred between Chicago-area stores several times.\nNone of these transfers entailed any loss in pay, benefits, or\njob responsibilities. In July 2012 he was transferred again,\n\f2                                                 No. 15-3201\n\nthis time from a store on Kedzie Avenue that serves a largely\nHispanic clientele. This transfer, too, involved no reduction\nin his pay or responsibilities.\n    Stuckey never reported for work at his new assignment.\nInstead he filed a complaint with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission accusing AutoZone of racial\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VII. Stuckey is black; he\nclaimed that AutoZone transferred him out of the Kedzie\nlocation in an effort to make it a “predominantly Hispanic”\nstore.\n     The EEOC filed suit on Stuckey’s behalf alleging that the\ntransfer violated 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(2), an infrequently\nlitigated provision in Title VII that makes it unlawful for an\nemployer “to limit, segregate, or classify his employees … in\nany way which would deprive or tend to deprive any indi-\nvidual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely\naffect his status as an employee, because of such individual’s\nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” The district\njudge granted summary judgment for AutoZone, holding\nthat the transfer was not an adverse employment action.\n    The EEOC contests this conclusion, arguing that the stat-\nute doesn’t require the claimant to prove that the challenged\naction adversely affected his employment opportunities or\nstatus. That reading cannot be squared with the plain statu-\ntory text. We affirm.\n                       I. Background\n    Stuckey began working for AutoZone as a salesperson in\nJanuary 2008 and was originally assigned to a store located\nat the intersection of Ogden Avenue and Pulaski Road in\nChicago. He worked there for about eight months, received a\n\fNo. 15-3201                                                 3\n\nraise, and then was transferred to the AutoZone store locat-\ned at 4416 S. Kedzie Avenue at the same pay, benefits, and\njob responsibilities. He worked at the Kedzie store for about\n18 months, received another raise, and was promoted to\nsales manager with a more substantial increase in pay and\nresponsibilities. In May or June of 2010, he was transferred\nto another Chicago store and a few weeks later was trans-\nferred again. In May 2011 AutoZone returned Stuckey to the\nKedzie store. None of these transfers entailed any reduction\nin his pay, benefits, or job responsibilities.\n    The Kedzie store is located in an area largely populated\nby Hispanics, and the clientele at the store reflects the sur-\nrounding neighborhood. Robert Harris was AutoZone’s\ndistrict manager responsible for overseeing the Kedzie store\n(and about a dozen others). Harris is black; he is the\ndecision-maker behind Stuckey’s many transfers, including\nthe one at the center of this case.\n   When Stuckey returned to the Kedzie store in 2011, his\nimmediate supervisor was Vernon Harrington, the store\nmanager. Harrington is also black. It’s undisputed that\nStuckey and Harrington did not get along. But the parties\ndisagree about whether Stuckey asked to be transferred out\nof the Kedzie store because of this discord. Harris and\nHarrington testified in their depositions that he did. Stuckey\nadmitted only that he and Harrington did not get along well;\nhe did not recall asking for a transfer.\n    More specifically, Harrington testified that Stuckey was\nfrustrated and wanted to transfer out of the Kedzie store\nbecause he couldn’t communicate well with the customers.\nIn fact, Harrington said that Stuckey was upset that he was\nnot being transferred from the Kedzie store quickly enough.\n\f4                                                 No. 15-3201\n\nTo expedite the matter, Harrington contacted Tina\nCleveland, a human resources manager at AutoZone, to tell\nher that Stuckey wanted a transfer.\n   In the meantime, Harrington contacted Harris to let him\nknow that he’d had to discipline Stuckey a few times and\nthat Stuckey didn’t respond well. Apparently this was meant\nto move the transfer decision along. Harrington was under\nthe impression that one of the reasons Stuckey could not be\ntransferred right away was that attendance problems made\nhim temporarily ineligible. He also understood that Harris\ndidn’t have anywhere else to place him just then.\n    In any event, the transfer decision came in July 2012.\nHarrington told Stuckey that he was being transferred to a\nstore located at 103rd Street and South Michigan Avenue.\nHarris explained the reasons for the transfer this way: “[T]he\n[new] store had a need,” and “[Stuckey] was wanting to\ngo … . [He] and his store manager couldn’t see eye to eye.\nAnd [the new store] was closer to [Stuckey’s] home, so I felt\nhe would be the best one for that store … .” Stuckey recalls\nthe event differently. He testified that when he called Harris\nto ask why he was being transferred, Harris replied that he\nwas trying to “keep [the Kedzie store] predominantly\nHispanic” and also that the “sales are down, he was basical-\nly trying to get the sales back up to where they’re supposed\nto be at.”\n    Like the earlier transfers, this one entailed no reduction\nin pay, benefits, or job responsibilities. Moreover, as Stuckey\nindicated in his EEOC complaint (and admitted in his depo-\nsition), he actually “didn’t mind” being transferred from the\nKedzie store. He also acknowledged that Harris never made\nany comments about his race or the race of any other Auto-\n\fNo. 15-3201                                                 5\n\nZone employee. Finally, he acknowledged that the new store\nwas closer to the home address listed in his personnel file.\n(Apparently he no longer lived at that address but had not\nupdated his file.)\n   Rather than accept the transfer, Stuckey chose to aban-\ndon his job; he did not report for work at his new assign-\nment. Instead he filed a charge with the EEOC claiming that\nAutoZone discriminated against him because of his race in\nviolation of Title VII.\n    The EEOC filed this suit on his behalf alleging that the\ntransfer violated § 2000e-2(a)(2), which makes it unlawful for\nan employer to segregate his workforce by race “in any way\nwhich would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of\nemployment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his\nstatus as an employee.” Following discovery, AutoZone\nmoved for summary judgment, arguing that the record\nconclusively established that the transfer (1) was not an act\nof intentional segregation of its workforce by race and\n(2) did not adversely affect Stuckey’s employment status.\nThe district judge accepted the second argument and held\nthat the undisputed evidence showed that Stuckey did not\nsuffer an adverse employment action. The judge entered\nsummary judgment for AutoZone.\n    For completeness we note a few additional undisputed\nfactual points. During and shortly after these events, several\nblack employees voluntarily transferred out of the Kedzie\nstore specifically because of the language barrier with cus-\ntomers, and some Hispanic employees were promoted or\nnewly hired. On the other hand, after Stuckey quit, Auto-\nZone also hired new black employees to work at the Kedzie\n\f6                                                   No. 15-3201\n\nstore and promoted some who were already employed\nthere.\n                          II. Discussion\n   Title VII’s principal provision targeting discrimination in\nthe workplace states:\n       (a) Employer practices\n           It shall be an unlawful employment prac-\n       tice for an employer—\n          (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge\n       any individual, or otherwise to discriminate\n       against any individual with respect to his\n       compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\n       of employment, because of such individual’s\n       race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or\n           (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his em-\n       ployees or applicants for employment in any\n       way which would deprive or tend to deprive\n       any individual of employment opportunities or\n       otherwise adversely affect his status as an em-\n       ployee, because of such individual’s race, color,\n       religion, sex, or national origin.\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a).\n    Most Title VII litigation involves the first subsection. This\ncase involves the second. Though not often litigated, the\nterms of subsection (a)(2) are straightforward enough:\nEmployers may not “limit, segregate, or classify” their\nemployees by race (or another listed characteristic) “in any\nway which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual\nof employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect”\n\fNo. 15-3201                                                    7\n\nhis employment. The EEOC alleges that AutoZone violated\nthis provision by transferring Stuckey for the purpose of\ncreating a predominantly Hispanic workforce at its Kedzie\nstore.\n    We assume for the sake of argument that the evidentiary\nrecord, viewed in Stuckey’s favor, reveals a material factual\ndispute about whether AutoZone intentionally segregated\nStuckey because of his race, as the EEOC maintains. We\nnote, however, that the factual support for a finding of\nintentional segregation is limited to Stuckey’s assertion that\nHarris told him that the reason for the transfer was to create\na “predominantly Hispanic” store at the Kedzie location.\nHarris denied saying this, and no other evidence corrobo-\nrates this rationale for the transfer. Giving Stuckey’s version\nthe benefit of the doubt, as we’re required to do, we move\ndirectly to the question that was ultimately decisive in the\ndistrict court: Did the EEOC present sufficient evidence from\nwhich a reasonable jury could conclude that the transfer\nadversely affected Stuckey’s employment?\n    The answer is “no.” The evidence is undisputed that the\nJuly 2012 transfer was purely lateral, like the others before it,\nand entailed no reduction in pay, benefits, or job responsibil-\nities. Nor did it otherwise alter his conditions of employ-\nment in a detrimental way.\n    The EEOC responds to this factual difficulty with a novel\nlegal argument. The agency argues that a subsection (a)(2)\nclaimant, unlike a subsection (a)(1) claimant, is not required\nto prove that the challenged action adversely affected his\nemployment opportunities or had a tendency to do so. As\nthe EEOC reads the statute, any action to limit, segregate, or\nclassify employees because of race automatically violates\n\f8                                                  No. 15-3201\n\n§ 2000e-2(a)(2). On this understanding, it’s not necessary for\nthe plaintiff to produce evidence that the challenged action\ndeprived or tended to deprive him of employment opportu-\nnities or otherwise adversely affected his employment\nstatus. Those effects, according to the EEOC, are inherent in\nthe act and need not be proved.\n    This argument eliminates much of the statutory text. Or\nmore precisely, it leaves much of the statutory text with no\nmeaningful work to do. If it’s not necessary to show that the\nchallenged employment action “deprive[d] or tend[ed] to\ndeprive” the employee of employment opportunities “or\notherwise adversely affect[ed] his status as an employee,”\nwhat is the point of this statutory language? We read\n§ 2000e-2(a)(2) to require case-specific proof that the chal-\nlenged employment action had these effects.\n    The EEOC relies on two of our cases—Chaney v. Plainfield\nCenter, 612 F.3d 908 (7th Cir. 2010), and Kyles v. J.K. Guardian\nSecurity Services, Inc., 222 F.3d 289 (7th Cir. 2000)—but\nneither supports the agency’s interpretation of subsec-\ntion (a)(2). Chaney did not involve subsection (a)(2) at all.\nThat case centered on Title VII’s exception for bona fide\noccupational qualifications. Chaney was a challenge to a\nnursing home’s practice of honoring the racial preferences of\nits residents when assigning nursing assistants to care for\nthem. A black nursing assistant sued, alleging that this\npractice, along with frequent racially tinged comments and\nepithets by her white coworkers, subjected her to a hostile\nwork environment in violation of § 2000e-2(a)(1). 612 F.3d at\n910–12. We rejected the nursing home’s position that the\nrace-matching policy was a bona fide occupational qualifica-\ntion and allowed the hostile-environment claim to proceed.\n\fNo. 15-3201                                                    9\n\nId. at 912–15. None of this has any bearing on the proper\ninterpretation of § 2000e-2(a)(2).\n    The EEOC’s reliance on Kyles is likewise misplaced. The\nquestion in Kyles was whether job testers had standing to sue\nfor violation of § 2000e-2(a)(2). There, suit was brought by\ntwo black job testers who worked for Chicago’s Legal Assis-\ntance Foundation on a project to expose employment dis-\ncrimination by pairing with white job testers and posing as\njob applicants at private employers in the area. 222 F.3d at\n292–94. The two black testers were turned down for a job as\na receptionist in favor of the white tester. Id. They sued the\nemployer under § 2000e-2(a)(2), but the district court dis-\nmissed the suit for lack of standing. The judge held that\nbecause they were only hypothetical job applicants, they\nsuffered no injury that could support Article III standing.\n    We reversed, noting that “[w]hen a job applicant is not\nconsidered for a job simply because she is African-American,\nshe has been limited, segregated, or classified in a way that\nwould tend to deprive not only her, but any other individual\nwho happens to be a person of color, of employment oppor-\ntunities.” Id. at 298. “The fact that [the plaintiff job testers]\nhad no interest in actually working for the company certain-\nly speaks to the nature and extent of their injuries as well as\nthe appropriate relief.” Id. at 300. “But it does not rule out\nthe prospect that they were injured. We have long recognized\nthat humiliation, embarrassment, and like injuries—the very\ntype of injuries that [the plaintiffs] allege they suffered—\nconstitute cognizable and compensable harms stemming\nfrom discrimination.” Id.\n   Our analysis of the standing question raised in Kyles does\nnot support the EEOC’s interpretation of subsection (a)(2).\n\f10                                                  No. 15-3201\n\nWe held only that the job testers alleged an injury sufficient\nto support Article III standing to sue. Nothing in that hold-\ning relieves a claimant in a § 2000e-2(a)(2) suit of the obliga-\ntion to prove that the challenged job action deprived him of\nemployment opportunities or otherwise adversely affected\nhis employment status.\n    We note in closing that § 2000e-2(a)(2) makes it unlawful\nto segregate employees by race even if that action has only a\ntendency to deprive a person of employment opportunities.\nIn that sense subsection (a)(2) does cast a wider net than\nsubsection (a)(1), which speaks more concretely in terms of\nactions that “discriminate against any individual.” See Minor\nv. Centocor, Inc., 457 F.3d 632, 634 (7th Cir. 2006) (explaining\nthat the requirement of an “adverse employment action” in a\nclaim for violation of § 2000e-2(a)(1) is a proxy for “discrimi-\nnation”). So we reject AutoZone’s argument, accepted by the\ndistrict judge, that the lack of an “adverse employment\naction” defeats a suit under § 2000e-2(a)(2). But the broader\nscope of subsection (a)(2) doesn’t help the EEOC’s case. No\nevidence suggests that the July 2012 transfer even tended to\ndeprive Stuckey of any job opportunity.\n    It’s well established that a purely lateral job transfer does\nnot normally give rise to Title VII liability under subsec-\ntion (a)(1) because it does not constitute a materially adverse\nemployment action. See Herrnreiter v. Chicago Hous. Auth.,\n315 F.3d 742, 744 (7th Cir. 2002) (“[A] purely lateral transfer,\nthat is, a transfer that does not involve a demotion in form or\nsubstance … [,] cannot rise to the level of a materially ad-\nverse employment action. A transfer involving no reduction\nin pay and no more than a minor change in working condi-\ntions will not do, either.”) (quotation marks omitted); Lucero\n\fNo. 15-3201                                                   11\n\nv. Nettle Creek Sch. Corp., 566 F.3d 720, 730–31 (7th Cir. 2009).\nThe result is the same in this suit under subsection (a)(2).\nThe evidence does not permit a reasonable jury to find that\nStuckey’s lateral transfer deprived or even tended to deprive\nhim of any employment opportunity or otherwise adversely\naffected his employment status. Indeed, at oral argument the\nEEOC disclaimed any interest in an opportunity to present\nsuch evidence, resting its entire case on the argument that no\nsuch evidence is required. For the reasons we’ve explained,\nthat’s an incorrect reading of the statute. The district judge\nproperly entered summary judgment for AutoZone.\n                                                      AFFIRMED.\n\f",

Stuckey\nadmitted only that he and Harrington did not get along well;\nhe did not recall asking for a transfer.\n    More specifically, Harrington testified that Stuckey was\nfrustrated and wanted to transfer out of the Kedzie store\nbecause he couldn’t communicate well with the customers.\nIn fact, Harrington said that Stuckey was upset that he was\nnot being transferred from the Kedzie store quickly enough.\n\f4                                                 No. 15-3201\n\nTo expedite the matter, Harrington contacted Tina\nCleveland, a human resources manager at AutoZone, to tell\nher that Stuckey wanted a transfer.\n   In the meantime, Harrington contacted Harris to let him\nknow that he’d had to discipline Stuckey a few times and\nthat Stuckey didn’t respond well. Apparently this was meant\nto move the transfer decision along. Harrington was under\nthe impression that one of the reasons Stuckey could not be\ntransferred right away was that attendance problems made\nhim temporarily ineligible. He also understood that Harris\ndidn’t have anywhere else to place him just then.\n    In any event, the transfer decision came in July 2012.\nHarrington told Stuckey that he was being transferred to a\nstore located at 103rd Street and South Michigan Avenue.\nHarris explained the reasons for the transfer this way: “[T]he\n[new] store had a need,” and “[Stuckey] was wanting to\ngo … . [He] and his store manager couldn’t see eye to eye.\nAnd [the new store] was closer to [Stuckey’s] home, so I felt\nhe would be the best one for that store … .” Stuckey recalls\nthe event differently. He testified that when he called Harris\nto ask why he was being transferred, Harris replied that he\nwas trying to “keep [the Kedzie store] predominantly\nHispanic” and also that the “sales are down, he was basical-\nly trying to get the sales back up to where they’re supposed\nto be at.”\n    Like the earlier transfers, this one entailed no reduction\nin pay, benefits, or job responsibilities. Moreover, as Stuckey\nindicated in his EEOC complaint (and admitted in his depo-\nsition), he actually “didn’t mind” being transferred from the\nKedzie store. He also acknowledged that Harris never made\nany comments about his race or the race of any other Auto-\n\fNo. 15-3201                                                 5\n\nZone employee. Finally, he acknowledged that the new store\nwas closer to the home address listed in his personnel file.\n(Apparently he no longer lived at that address but had not\nupdated his file.)\n   Rather than accept the transfer, Stuckey chose to aban-\ndon his job; he did not report for work at his new assign-\nment. Instead he filed a charge with the EEOC claiming that\nAutoZone discriminated against him because of his race in\nviolation of Title VII.\n    The EEOC filed this suit on his behalf alleging that the\ntransfer violated § 2000e-2(a)(2), which makes it unlawful for\nan employer to segregate his workforce by race “in any way\nwhich would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of\nemployment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his\nstatus as an employee.” Following discovery, AutoZone\nmoved for summary judgment, arguing that the record\nconclusively established that the transfer (1) was not an act\nof intentional segregation of its workforce by race and\n(2) did not adversely affect Stuckey’s employment status.\nThe district judge accepted the second argument and held\nthat the undisputed evidence showed that Stuckey did not\nsuffer an adverse employment action. The judge entered\nsummary judgment for AutoZone.\n    For completeness we note a few additional undisputed\nfactual points. During and shortly after these events, several\nblack employees voluntarily transferred out of the Kedzie\nstore specifically because of the language barrier with cus-\ntomers, and some Hispanic employees were promoted or\nnewly hired. On the other hand, after Stuckey quit, Auto-\nZone also hired new black employees to work at the Kedzie\n\f6                                                   No. 15-3201\n\nstore and promoted some who were already employed\nthere.\n                          II. Discussion\n   Title VII’s principal provision targeting discrimination in\nthe workplace states:\n       (a) Employer practices\n           It shall be an unlawful employment prac-\n       tice for an employer—\n          (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge\n       any individual, or otherwise to discriminate\n       against any individual with respect to his\n       compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\n       of employment, because of such individual’s\n       race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or\n           (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his em-\n       ployees or applicants for employment in any\n       way which would deprive or tend to deprive\n       any individual of employment opportunities or\n       otherwise adversely affect his status as an em-\n       ployee, because of such individual’s race, color,\n       religion, sex, or national origin.\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a).\n    Most Title VII litigation involves the first subsection. This\ncase involves the second. Though not often litigated, the\nterms of subsection (a)(2) are straightforward enough:\nEmployers may not “limit, segregate, or classify” their\nemployees by race (or another listed characteristic) “in any\nway which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual\nof employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect”\n\fNo. 15-3201                                                    7\n\nhis employment. The EEOC alleges that AutoZone violated\nthis provision by transferring Stuckey for the purpose of\ncreating a predominantly Hispanic workforce at its Kedzie\nstore.\n    We assume for the sake of argument that the evidentiary\nrecord, viewed in Stuckey’s favor, reveals a material factual\ndispute about whether AutoZone intentionally segregated\nStuckey because of his race, as the EEOC maintains. We\nnote, however, that the factual support for a finding of\nintentional segregation is limited to Stuckey’s assertion that\nHarris told him that the reason for the transfer was to create\na “predominantly Hispanic” store at the Kedzie location.\nHarris denied saying this, and no other evidence corrobo-\nrates this rationale for the transfer. Giving Stuckey’s version\nthe benefit of the doubt, as we’re required to do, we move\ndirectly to the question that was ultimately decisive in the\ndistrict court: Did the EEOC present sufficient evidence from\nwhich a reasonable jury could conclude that the transfer\nadversely affected Stuckey’s employment?\n    The answer is “no.” The evidence is undisputed that the\nJuly 2012 transfer was purely lateral, like the others before it,\nand entailed no reduction in pay, benefits, or job responsibil-\nities. Nor did it otherwise alter his conditions of employ-\nment in a detrimental way.\n    The EEOC responds to this factual difficulty with a novel\nlegal argument. The agency argues that a subsection (a)(2)\nclaimant, unlike a subsection (a)(1) claimant, is not required\nto prove that the challenged action adversely affected his\nemployment opportunities or had a tendency to do so. As\nthe EEOC reads the statute, any action to limit, segregate, or\nclassify employees because of race automatically violates\n\f8                                                  No. 15-3201\n\n§ 2000e-2(a)(2). On this understanding, it’s not necessary for\nthe plaintiff to produce evidence that the challenged action\ndeprived or tended to deprive him of employment opportu-\nnities or otherwise adversely affected his employment\nstatus. Those effects, according to the EEOC, are inherent in\nthe act and need not be proved.\n    This argument eliminates much of the statutory text. Or\nmore precisely, it leaves much of the statutory text with no\nmeaningful work to do. If it’s not necessary to show that the\nchallenged employment action “deprive[d] or tend[ed] to\ndeprive” the employee of employment opportunities “or\notherwise adversely affect[ed] his status as an employee,”\nwhat is the point of this statutory language? We read\n§ 2000e-2(a)(2) to require case-specific proof that the chal-\nlenged employment action had these effects.\n    The EEOC relies on two of our cases—Chaney v. Plainfield\nCenter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"151080\"><a href=\"/opinion/151080/chaney-v-plainfield-healthcare-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2010), and Kyles v. J.K. Guardian\nSecurity Services, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769860\"><a href=\"/opinion/769860/kyra-kyles-and-lolita-pierce-v-jk-guardian-security-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2000)—but\nneither supports the agency’s interpretation of subsec-\ntion (a)(2). Chaney did not involve subsection (a)(2) at all.\nThat case centered on Title VII’s exception for bona fide\noccupational qualifications. Chaney was a challenge to a\nnursing home’s practice of honoring the racial preferences of\nits residents when assigning nursing assistants to care for\nthem. A black nursing assistant sued, alleging that this\npractice, along with frequent racially tinged comments and\nepithets by her white coworkers, subjected her to a hostile\nwork environment in violation of § 2000e-2(a)(1). 612 F.3d at\n910–12. We rejected the nursing home’s position that the\nrace-matching policy was a bona fide occupational qualifica-\ntion and allowed the hostile-environment claim to proceed.\n\fNo. 15-3201                                                    9\n\nId. at 912–15. None of this has any bearing on the proper\ninterpretation of § 2000e-2(a)(2).\n    The EEOC’s reliance on Kyles is likewise misplaced. The\nquestion in Kyles was whether job testers had standing to sue\nfor violation of § 2000e-2(a)(2). There, suit was brought by\ntwo black job testers who worked for Chicago’s Legal Assis-\ntance Foundation on a project to expose employment dis-\ncrimination by pairing with white job testers and posing as\njob applicants at private employers in the area. 222 F.3d at\n292–94. The two black testers were turned down for a job as\na receptionist in favor of the white tester. Id. They sued the\nemployer under § 2000e-2(a)(2), but the district court dis-\nmissed the suit for lack of standing. The judge held that\nbecause they were only hypothetical job applicants, they\nsuffered no injury that could support Article III standing.\n    We reversed, noting that “[w]hen a job applicant is not\nconsidered for a job simply because she is African-American,\nshe has been limited, segregated, or classified in a way that\nwould tend to deprive not only her, but any other individual\nwho happens to be a person of color, of employment oppor-\ntunities.” Id. at 298. “The fact that [the plaintiff job testers]\nhad no interest in actually working for the company certain-\nly speaks to the nature and extent of their injuries as well as\nthe appropriate relief.” Id. at 300. “But it does not rule out\nthe prospect that they were injured. We have long recognized\nthat humiliation, embarrassment, and like injuries—the very\ntype of injuries that [the plaintiffs] allege they suffered—\nconstitute cognizable and compensable harms stemming\nfrom discrimination.” Id.\n   Our analysis of the standing question raised in Kyles does\nnot support the EEOC’s interpretation of subsection (a)(2).\n\f10                                                  No. 15-3201\n\nWe held only that the job testers alleged an injury sufficient\nto support Article III standing to sue. Nothing in that hold-\ning relieves a claimant in a § 2000e-2(a)(2) suit of the obliga-\ntion to prove that the challenged job action deprived him of\nemployment opportunities or otherwise adversely affected\nhis employment status.\n    We note in closing that § 2000e-2(a)(2) makes it unlawful\nto segregate employees by race even if that action has only a\ntendency to deprive a person of employment opportunities.\nIn that sense subsection (a)(2) does cast a wider net than\nsubsection (a)(1), which speaks more concretely in terms of\nactions that “discriminate against any individual.” See Minor\nv. Centocor, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 634 (7th Cir. 2006) (explaining\nthat the requirement of an “adverse employment action” in a\nclaim for violation of § 2000e-2(a)(1) is a proxy for “discrimi-\nnation”). So we reject AutoZone’s argument, accepted by the\ndistrict judge, that the lack of an “adverse employment\naction” defeats a suit under § 2000e-2(a)(2). But the broader\nscope of subsection (a)(2) doesn’t help the EEOC’s case. No\nevidence suggests that the July 2012 transfer even tended to\ndeprive Stuckey of any job opportunity.\n    It’s well established that a purely lateral job transfer does\nnot normally give rise to Title VII liability under subsec-\ntion (a)(1) because it does not constitute a materially adverse\nemployment action. See Herrnreiter v. Chicago Hous. Auth.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780401\"><a href=\"/opinion/780401/siegfried-herrnreiter-v-chicago-housing-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 744 (7th Cir. 2002) (“[A] purely lateral transfer,\nthat is, a transfer that does not involve a demotion in form or\nsubstance … [,] cannot rise to the level of a materially ad-\nverse employment action.

Indeed, at oral argument the\nEEOC disclaimed any interest in an opportunity to present\nsuch evidence, resting its entire case on the argument that no\nsuch evidence is required. For the reasons we’ve explained,\nthat’s an incorrect reading of the statute.
