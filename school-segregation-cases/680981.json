The district court\ndismissed Palacios’s federal habeas petition as time-barred, concluding that it\nwas untimely filed and that Palacios was not entitled to equitable tolling.

The Texas Court of Appeals for the Thirteenth Judicial District\naffirmed his conviction on direct appeal, Palacios v. State, No. 13-07-171-CR, 2008\nWL 4433209 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi July 17, 2008, pet. ref’d) (mem. op., not\ndesignated for publication), and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (“TCCA”)\ndenied his petition for discretionary review, In re Palacios, No. 1092-08, 2008 Tex.\nCrim. App. LEXIS 1488 (Tex. Crim. App. Nov. 26, 2008). Palacios did not petition\nfor a writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court.\n      On April 6, 2010, Palacios filed a state habeas petition with the Texas\nDistrict Court for the 319th Judicial District. That court found that there were\n“no controverted, unresolved fact issues material to the disposition” of the\npetition, and that there was “no need for expansion of the record by an\nevidentiary hearing.” It then addressed Palacios’s four asserted grounds for\nrelief, found them lacking, and recommended that the petition “be DENIED in\nits entirety.” Following that recommendation, the TCCA denied the petition\nwithout written order on January 26, 2011.\n      On February 25, 2011, Palacios filed a federal habeas petition in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The Texas\nAttorney General’s Office moved for summary judgment, reasoning that because\nthe petition was filed after the expiration of AEDPA’s one-year limitation period,\n\n                                         2\n\f     Case: 11-41080       Document: 00512313292          Page: 3     Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41080\n\nand Palacios was not entitled to statutory or equitable tolling, the petition was\ntime-barred. The district court, adopting the report and recommendation of a\nmagistrate judge, granted the motion, but did not immediately enter final\njudgment for the government. Palacios filed a timely notice of appeal in the\ndistrict court, and a timely application for a COA with this court. Five months\nafter its summary judgment ruling, the district court entered final judgment\ndismissing with prejudice the habeas petition. Within 30 days of final judgment,\nPalacios filed pro se a motion for new trial or, in the alternative, to alter or\namend the judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a) and (e)\n(the “Rule 59 motion”).1 On May 7, 2012, this court granted a COA on whether\n“the district court erred in refusing to equitably toll the limitation period and in\ndetermining that Palacios had failed to pursue his state remedies diligently.”\nIn light of the COA grant, the district court entered an order staying its ruling\non the Rule 59 motion “until after the appeal is decided.” By operation of\nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure (“FRAP”) 4(a)(4)(B)(i),2 the stay placed the\nappeal in jurisdictional limbo: a notice of appeal filed before a timely filed Rule\n59 motion is sufficient to bring the underlying case to the court of appeals but\n“is, in effect, suspended until the motion is disposed of, whereupon, the\npreviously filed notice effectively places jurisdiction in the court of appeals.” See\nRoss v. Marshall, 426 F.3d 745, 752 n.13 (5th Cir. 2005) (quoting Fed. R. App.\nP. 4 Advisory Committee’s note); see also Simmons v. Reliance Standard Life Ins.\nCo., 310 F.3d 865, 868–69 n.2 (5th Cir. 2002) (suggesting that a stay does not\n\n       1\n        The district court advised Palacios that “hybrid representation is not permitted,” and\nwarned him that “[a]ny future pro se pleadings filed while petitioner is represented by\ncounsel will be struck,” but elected not to strike the Rule 59 motion “because of the unusual\nprocedural posture of the case.”\n       2\n        “If a party files a notice of appeal after the court announces or enters a judgment—but\nbefore it disposes of any motion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)—the notice becomes effective to\nappeal a judgment or order, in whole or in part, when the order disposing of the last such\nremaining motion is entered.” Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(i).\n\n                                              3\n\f    Case: 11-41080      Document: 00512313292      Page: 4    Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 11-41080\n\n“dispose of” a motion for the purposes of FRAP 4(a)(4)(B)(i)). When notified that\nhis Rule 59 motion was holding up his appeal, Palacios moved to voluntarily\ndismiss it. The district court granted the motion to dismiss, rendering effective\nPalacios’s notice of appeal and placing appellate jurisdiction in this court.\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      The standard of review governing a district court’s equitable tolling\ndecision depends on the basis on which it is grounded. If the district court\nexercises its discretion to deny equitable tolling, review is for abuse of discretion,\nHenderson v. Thaler, 626 F.3d 773, 779 (5th Cir. 2010); if the district court\ndenies equitable tolling as a matter of law, review is de novo, Mathis v. Thaler,\n616 F.3d 461, 474 n.14 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing Fisher v. Johnson, 174 F.3d 710,\n713 n.9 (5th Cir. 1999)). We begin by assessing the basis for the district court’s\nequitable tolling ruling.\n      The district court referred the government’s motion for summary judgment\nto a magistrate judge, who issued a memorandum and recommendation\nrecommending that the government’s motion be granted and Palacios’s habeas\npetition be dismissed with prejudice as time-barred. The magistrate judge\nrecommended denying equitable tolling on the basis of its judgment that\nPalacios had not shown that he had reasonably relied on his attorney’s alleged\nmisrepresentation that he had filed the state habeas petition. The magistrate\njudge cited United States v. Riggs, 314 F.3d 796, 799 (5th Cir. 2003), for the\nproposition that an attorney’s intentional deceit warrants equitable tolling only\nif the petitioner reasonably relied on the misrepresentation. Although the\nmagistrate judge expressed that Palacios did not support his allegation of\nmisrepresentation with competent evidence, and that he “could have filed a\nbare-bones petition and supplemented it with his documents when he obtained\nthem,” the magistrate judge did not appear to base the recommended denial of\nequitable tolling on those grounds.\n\n                                          4\n\f     Case: 11-41080        Document: 00512313292           Page: 5      Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                         No. 11-41080\n\n       The district court “adopt[ed] as its own the findings and conclusions of the\nMagistrate Judge[,] as supplemented” in an order addressing Palacios’s\nobjections. In that order, the district court made findings that (1) “Petitioner’s\nevidence did not affirmatively establish that Petitioner’s attorney made a false\nrepresentation of fact,” (2) there was “sufficient evidence to show that Petitioner\nwas aware that his state court writ had not been filed” as of January 29, 2010,\na date it deemed “sufficiently in advance of his February 24, 2010 deadline to\nallow him to take action to preserve his federal rights,” and (3) “the time\nbetween January 29, 2010 and February 24, 2010 was . . . . sufficient time to\nensure that the writ was filed.” Without specifying whether its equitable tolling\nruling was grounded in law or discretion, the district court granted the\ngovernment’s motion for summary judgment.\n       Though we question one legal basis on which the district court’s equitable\ntolling ruling appeared to rest,3 we may nonetheless affirm its dismissal of\nPalacios’s habeas petition if dismissal is justified by another ground supported\nby the record.

Ct. 912, 923 (2012) (commenting that evidence of abandonment “would suffice\nto establish extraordinary circumstances beyond [a petitioner’s] control” (citing Holland v.\nFlorida, 130 S. Ct. 2549 (2010))); see also Manning v. Epps, 688 F.3d 177, 184 n.2 (5th Cir. 2012),\ncert denied, __ U.S. __, 133 S. Ct. 1633 (2013) (“[A]ttorney abandonment can qualify as an\nextraordinary circumstance for equitable tolling purposes.” (citing Maples, 132 S. Ct. at 924)).\n\n                                                5\n\f     Case: 11-41080        Document: 00512313292           Page: 6     Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 11-41080\n\nconclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.”\n28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(A). Palacios’s conviction became final, and his limitation\nperiod began to run, on February 24, 2009, the date on which the 90-day period\nin which to seek review with the United States Supreme Court expired.4 See\nRoberts v. Cockrell, 319 F.3d 690, 694 (5th Cir. 2003) (citing 28 U.S.C. §\n2244(d)(1)(A)). Palacios filed his state habeas petition on April 6, 2010, and his\nfederal habeas petition on February 25, 2011. Because his state habeas petition\nwas not filed within the one-year period, it did not statutorily toll the limitation\nclock. Scott v. Johnson, 227 F.3d 260, 263 (5th Cir. 2000) (citing § 2244(d)(2)).\nAccordingly, his AEDPA limitation period expired on February 24, 2010, unless\nit was equitably tolled.\n       To obtain the benefit of equitable tolling, Palacios must establish that (1)\nhe pursued habeas relief with “reasonable diligence,” and (2) some\n“extraordinary circumstances” stood in his way and “prevented” timely filing.\nManning, 688 F.3d at 183 (citing Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2562). We begin—and\nin this case, end—with the diligence requirement.\n       “The diligence required for equitable tolling purposes is reasonable\ndiligence, not maximum feasible diligence.” Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2565 (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted). Whether diligence is “reasonable” is an\n“equitable, often fact-intensive inquiry” in which courts are instructed to avoid\n“mechanical rules” and instead to “draw upon decisions made in other similar\ncases for guidance.” Id. at 2563, 2565 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAccordingly, we proceed by reciting the relevant facts, comparing the diligence\nshown by Palacios to the diligence shown by petitioners in similar\n\n\n\n       4\n         For the first time on appeal, Palacios disputes this calculation, arguing that the period\nbegan to run on March 15, 2009, 90 days after he purportedly received notice of the denial of his\npetition for discretionary review. By conceding this point below, Palacios waived the right to\ndispute it on appeal, Black v. N. Panola Sch. Dist., 461 F.3d 584, 592 (5th Cir. 2006).\n\n                                                6\n\f     Case: 11-41080        Document: 00512313292          Page: 7     Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                         No. 11-41080\n\ncircumstances, and then exercising our review judgment as to whether, under\nthe circumstances, Palacios demonstrated reasonable diligence.\n       A.     Facts bearing upon reasonable diligence inquiry\n       Palacios     highlights     the    following     record      facts   and    allegations\ndemonstrating his diligence: (1) Palacios hired Attorney Stephen McMains to file\nhis state habeas petition and represent him in state habeas proceedings on\nSeptember 14, 2009, five months before the expiration of the limitation period;\n(2) Palacios informed McMains by letter of the filing deadline at the time of his\nhiring; (3) Aida Cortez, Palacios’s wife, contacted McMains by phone and\ntraveled to McMains’s home and office to follow up with him about the status of\nthe habeas application; (4) when McMains was unresponsive, Cortez filed a\ngrievance against him with the Texas State Bar, and Palacios reminded him by\nletter of the expiration of the AEDPA one-year limitation period, directed him\nagain to file the state habeas petition, and gave him ten days to respond; (5)\nwhen McMains did not respond within the ten-day period, Palacios discharged\nMcMains by letter and requested “original copies [of court documents] and all my\ntranscripts as soon as possible”; (6) on the day Palacios purportedly received his\nfile back, he filed his state habeas application pro se.5\n       The Texas Attorney General’s Office responds by emphasizing the\nfollowing record facts which, it contends, indicate that Palacios “slept on his\nrights”: (1) Palacios waited to hire McMains for ten months after the denial of\nhis petition for discretionary review and seven months after his AEDPA\nlimitation period began to run; (2) Palacios discharged McMains on February 11,\n2010, 13 days before the expiration of the AEDPA limitation period, but did not\n\n\n       5\n         During oral argument, counsel for petitioner stated that Palacios did not receive his\nfile back “until March . . . after March 4th, well after the February 25th deadline.” The precise\ndate on which Palacios received his file back has not been documented or litigated. We will\nassume arguendo that Palacios received his file back on April 6, 2010, the date he filed his\nstate habeas petition.\n\n                                               7\n\f    Case: 11-41080     Document: 00512313292      Page: 8    Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41080\n\nfile a state habeas petition until April 6, 2010, more than a month after the\ndeadline; and (3) Palacios waited until February 25, 2011, 30 days after the\nTCCA’s denial of his state habeas petition, to file his federal habeas petition.\n      B.    Analysis\n      Of the many considerations bearing upon the reasonable diligence\nanalysis, three are most pertinent here: (1) Palacios waited seven months after\nlearning of the denial of his petition for discretionary review to hire an attorney,\n(2) after hiring McMains, Palacios directed him to file the petition, reminded him\nof the filing deadline, and inquired into the filing status, and (3) after firing\nMcMains with two weeks remaining on his AEDPA limitation period, aware that\nthe period was about to expire, Palacios did not file a state habeas petition or a\nprotective federal habeas petition within that period.\n            1.     Seven-month delay\n      Our first consideration on review is whether Palacios’s seven-month delay\nin hiring an attorney shows a lack of reasonable diligence.\n      We have held that state prisoners who were aware that their state post-\nconviction proceedings were no longer pending and waited to file federal habeas\npetitions between four and six months after the AEDPA limitation period began\nto run did not exercise reasonable diligence. See Melancon v. Kaylo, 259 F.3d\n401, 408 (5th Cir. 2001) (holding that petitioner had not shown reasonable\ndiligence because he “waited more than four months to file his federal habeas\npetition”); Coleman v. Johnson, 184 F.3d 398, 403 (5th Cir. 1999) (per curiam)\n(holding that petitioner had not shown reasonable diligence because he “did not\nfile his § 2254 petition until approximately six months after learning of the\ndenial of his state postconviction application,” and “d[id] not explain the\nsix-month delay between being notified about his state application and filing his\nfederal petition”); Koumjian v. Thaler, 484 F. App’x 966, 969–70 (5th Cir. 2012)\n(per curiam) (unpublished) (holding that petitioner had not shown reasonable\n\n                                         8\n\f    Case: 11-41080     Document: 00512313292      Page: 9   Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41080\n\ndiligence because his delay in filing “exceed[ed] four and a half months”).\nPalacios does not distinguish these cases or identify countervailing precedent.\n      It could be argued that it follows a fortiori that Palacios, who did not hire\nan attorney, much less file a habeas petition, until seven months after learning\nof the denial of his petition for discretionary review, would similarly be unable\nto demonstrate reasonable diligence. But to hold that the reasonable diligence\noutcome here is dictated by Melancon, Coleman, and Koumjian would be to\nsuggest a bright-line rule that a prisoner does not exercise reasonable diligence\nif he does not hire an attorney within four months of the date his AEDPA\nlimitation period begins to run. Such a ruling would be in tension with our\nprevious observation that “equitable tolling does not lend itself to bright-line\nrules,” Fisher, 174 F.3d at 713, and the Supreme Court’s recent guidance that\nequitable tolling decisions “must be made on a case-by-case basis,” Holland, 130\nS. Ct. at 2563. Accordingly, we adhere to Melancon, Coleman, and Koumjian\nand factor them into our equitable tolling analysis, with awareness that the\n“specific circumstances” of this case could “warrant special treatment.” Holland,\n130 S. Ct. at 2563; see also Williams v. Thaler, 400 F. App’x 886, 890–91 (5th Cir.\n2010) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citing equitable tolling caselaw and noting:\n“Though we are guided by this precedent, we are mindful of the dangers of\ncreating a rule regarding the specific timeframe in which a petitioner must\ninquire regarding the status of his state habeas application in order to\ndemonstrate diligence. Rather, the circumstances of each case, taken together,\nmust determine whether a particular petitioner was diligent in pursuing his\nclaims and, therefore, entitled to equitable tolling.”).\n            2.     Diligence after hiring McMains\n      Our second consideration on review is whether Palacios exercised\nreasonable diligence after hiring McMains, which we assess by comparing the\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f    Case: 11-41080     Document: 00512313292      Page: 10   Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41080\n\ndiligence exercised by Palacios to the diligence exercised by petitioners faced with\ncomparable instances of attorney abandonment. Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2563.\n      Recent decisions addressing the equitable tolling ramifications of attorney\nabandonment are illustrative. In Holland, the Supreme Court concluded that\npetitioner had shown reasonable diligence by: “wr[iting] his attorney numerous\nletters seeking crucial information and providing direction”; “repeatedly\ncontact[ing] the state courts, their clerks, and the Florida State Bar Association\nin an effort to have [his attorney]—the central impediment to the pursuit of his\nlegal remedy—removed from his case; and “prepar[ing] his own habeas petition\npro se and promptly fil[ing] it with the District Court” on “the very day that [he]\ndiscovered that his AEDPA clock had expired due to [his attorney’s] failings.” Id.\nat 2565. We recently applied Holland’s teachings in Manning v. Epps, 688 F.3d\n177 (5th Cir. 2012), and Arita v. Cain, 500 F. App’x 352 (5th Cir. 2012) (per\ncuriam). In Manning, we concluded that a petitioner had not shown reasonable\ndiligence because, for a period of 19 months after he knew his conviction had\nbecome final, he relied on his appointed attorneys to file his habeas petition\nwithout directing them to file the petition or inquiring into its status. 688 F.3d\nat 184–86. In Arita, we concluded that a petitioner had not shown reasonable\ndiligence because he “never instructed [counsel] to file a [state or] federal habeas\npetition”; did not discharge non-responsive counsel until seven months after the\nfiling deadline had passed; waited more than a month to file his state habeas\npetition after hiring new counsel; and did not file a “protective” federal habeas\npetition preserving his federal remedies until his state remedies had been\nexhausted. 500 F. App’x at 353–55. These cases establish that “petitioners\nseeking to establish due diligence must exercise diligence even when they receive\ninadequate legal representation,” Manning, 688 F.3d at 185, and serve as\nguideposts for what constitutes reasonable diligence in the face of attorney\nabandonment.\n\n                                        10\n\f    Case: 11-41080     Document: 00512313292       Page: 11    Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 11-41080\n\n      Assuming arguendo that Cortez’s efforts on Palacios’s behalf may be\nattributed to Palacios, an issue not briefed by the parties, we perceive that\nPalacios’s diligence after hiring McMains is on par with Holland’s: both\npetitioners wrote their attorneys “numerous letters seeking crucial information\nand providing direction,” and, when their attorneys were unresponsive, filed\ngrievances with the state bar association, discharged their attorneys, and\npromptly prepared pro se habeas petitions. 130 S. Ct. at 2565. Moreover, unlike\nManning and Arita, Palacios unambiguously directed McMains to file the\npetition, and discharged him before the filing deadline when it became apparent\nhe was not going to perform the sole task for which he had been hired.\nAccordingly, “draw[ing] upon decisions made in other similar cases for\nguidance,” Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2563, and assuming without deciding that\nCortez’s efforts are factored into the analysis, we conclude that, after hiring\nMcMains, Palacios exercised reasonable diligence in pursuing state post-\nconviction relief.\n             3.      Protective federal habeas petition\n      Whether Palacios exercised reasonable diligence in pursuing federal post-\nconviction relief is a closer call. Palacios filed his federal habeas petition within\n30 days of the TCCA’s denial of his state habeas petition, but did so one year\nafter his AEDPA limitation period expired. Palacios could have prevented its\nexpiration by timely filing a “protective” federal habeas petition. Our third\nconsideration is whether Palacios’s failure to do so shows a lack of reasonable\ndiligence.\n      In Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408, 416 (2005), the Supreme Court\nnoted that one option for prisoners unsure whether their state habeas petitions\nhave been or will be timely filed is to file “a ‘protective’ petition in federal court\nand [to] ask[] the federal court to stay and abey the federal habeas proceedings\nuntil state remedies are exhausted.” The Supreme Court did not indicate\n\n                                         11\n\f    Case: 11-41080     Document: 00512313292       Page: 12    Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 11-41080\n\nwhether a prisoner’s failure to file a protective petition alone demonstrates a\nlack of reasonable diligence, a question this court has since raised but declined\nto resolve. See Madden v. Thaler, No. 11-10690, 2013 WL 1319349, at *6 (5th\nCir. Apr. 3, 2013) (per curiam) (unpublished) (stating that the court “need not\ndecide . . . whether a prisoner must file a protective petition to establish that he\nwas acting with the requisite diligence”); Howland v. Quarterman, 507 F.3d 840,\n846 (5th Cir. 2007) (“We expressly decline to determine whether a ‘protective’\npetition is necessary [to get the benefit of equitable tolling].”), abrogated on other\ngrounds by Campbell v. State, 320 S.W.3d 338 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n      In keeping with our disinclination to create bright-line rules constraining\nour equitable tolling analysis, we decline to hold that the failure to file a\nprotective petition alone prevents a prisoner from receiving equitable tolling.\nWe note, additionally, that Palacios’s failure to file a protective federal habeas\npetition is mitigated by (1) the limited time period—13 days—in which he had\nto file it, and (2) the allegation that he lacked access to his file until after the\nexpiration of the AEDPA limitation period. Under the circumstances, Palacios’s\nfailure to file a protective federal habeas petition weighs against, but is not\ndispositive of, the reasonable diligence inquiry.\n      C.     Balancing\n      Acknowledging it is a close case, we affirm the district court’s judgment\nthat Palacios is not entitled to equitable tolling on the basis that he failed to\nexercise reasonable diligence. Weighed heavily in our analysis is Palacios’s\nlengthy, unexcused delay in hiring an attorney. We grant that it may take time\nfor a state prisoner without full access to phones and internet to find, meet with,\nand retain an attorney. We allow also that it may be proper for us to exempt\nfrom consideration time spent by prisoners in administrative segregation and\nmedical and psychiatric wards. See, e.g., Fisher, 174 F.3d at 715 (“We have\nrecognized the possibility that mental incompetency might support equitable\n\n                                         12\n\f    Case: 11-41080        Document: 00512313292           Page: 13      Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 11-41080\n\ntolling of a limitation period. Combined with forced confinement and medication,\nno access to legal materials, and the temporary loss of one’s glasses, a pro se\npetitioner such as Fisher simply cannot pursue his legal rights during such a\nperiod.”) (citation omitted).         But Palacios took seven months to retain an\nattorney—more than half of the limitation period—and, notably, does not offer\na reason for the delay. Moreover, after having discharged his attorney with two\nweeks remaining on his AEDPA limitation period—giving him a chance to meet\nthe deadline notwithstanding his attorney’s alleged misconduct—he did not file\na protective federal habeas petition to preserve his federal remedies. The\ndistrict court found that, under the circumstances, two weeks was enough time\n“to allow [Palacios] to take action to preserve his federal rights.” We agree. In\nshort, though Palacios demonstrated reasonable diligence during the latter half\nof the limitation period, it was not enough to make up for his earlier and\nsubsequent delay.6\n                                      CONCLUSION\n       The district court’s dismissal of Palacios’s federal habeas petition is\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          Having so concluded, we decline to decide whether his attorney’s alleged\nmisrepresentation and abandonment qualifies as an “extraordinary circumstance,” and\nwhether it “prevented” timely filing. See Manning, 688 F.3d at 184–90 (“assum[ing] without\ndeciding” that the “extraordinary circumstance” prong is satisfied); Arita, 500 F. App’x at 354\n(“We need not decide whether Williams’s conduct was merely negligent or, to the contrary,\nsufficiently egregious to be considered rare and extraordinary; Arita is not entitled to equitable\ntolling anyway, because he failed to pursue his rights diligently.”). We trust that the\nallegations of attorney misconduct raised in this appeal have been investigated and resolved\nby the Texas Office of the Chief Disciplinary Counsel, to whom petitioner’s grievance was\naddressed.\n\n                                               13\n\f",

App. LEXIS 1488 (Tex. Crim. App. Nov. 26, 2008). Palacios did not petition\nfor a writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court.\n      On April 6, 2010, Palacios filed a state habeas petition with the Texas\nDistrict Court for the 319th Judicial District. That court found that there were\n“no controverted, unresolved fact issues material to the disposition” of the\npetition, and that there was “no need for expansion of the record by an\nevidentiary hearing.” It then addressed Palacios’s four asserted grounds for\nrelief, found them lacking, and recommended that the petition “be DENIED in\nits entirety.” Following that recommendation, the TCCA denied the petition\nwithout written order on January 26, 2011.\n      On February 25, 2011, Palacios filed a federal habeas petition in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The Texas\nAttorney General’s Office moved for summary judgment, reasoning that because\nthe petition was filed after the expiration of AEDPA’s one-year limitation period,\n\n                                         2\n\f     Case: 11-41080       Document: 00512313292          Page: 3     Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41080\n\nand Palacios was not entitled to statutory or equitable tolling, the petition was\ntime-barred. The district court, adopting the report and recommendation of a\nmagistrate judge, granted the motion, but did not immediately enter final\njudgment for the government. Palacios filed a timely notice of appeal in the\ndistrict court, and a timely application for a COA with this court. Five months\nafter its summary judgment ruling, the district court entered final judgment\ndismissing with prejudice the habeas petition. Within 30 days of final judgment,\nPalacios filed pro se a motion for new trial or, in the alternative, to alter or\namend the judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a) and (e)\n(the “Rule 59 motion”).1 On May 7, 2012, this court granted a COA on whether\n“the district court erred in refusing to equitably toll the limitation period and in\ndetermining that Palacios had failed to pursue his state remedies diligently.”\nIn light of the COA grant, the district court entered an order staying its ruling\non the Rule 59 motion “until after the appeal is decided.” By operation of\nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure (“FRAP”) 4(a)(4)(B)(i),2 the stay placed the\nappeal in jurisdictional limbo: a notice of appeal filed before a timely filed Rule\n59 motion is sufficient to bring the underlying case to the court of appeals but\n“is, in effect, suspended until the motion is disposed of, whereupon, the\npreviously filed notice effectively places jurisdiction in the court of appeals.” See\nRoss v.

The magistrate judge\nrecommended denying equitable tolling on the basis of its judgment that\nPalacios had not shown that he had reasonably relied on his attorney’s alleged\nmisrepresentation that he had filed the state habeas petition. The magistrate\njudge cited United States v. Riggs, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">314</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 799 (5th Cir. 2003), for the\nproposition that an attorney’s intentional deceit warrants equitable tolling only\nif the petitioner reasonably relied on the misrepresentation. Although the\nmagistrate judge expressed that Palacios did not support his allegation of\nmisrepresentation with competent evidence, and that he “could have filed a\nbare-bones petition and supplemented it with his documents when he obtained\nthem,” the magistrate judge did not appear to base the recommended denial of\nequitable tolling on those grounds.\n\n                                          4\n\f     Case: 11-41080        Document: 00512313292           Page: 5      Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                         No. 11-41080\n\n       The district court “adopt[ed] as its own the findings and conclusions of the\nMagistrate Judge[,] as supplemented” in an order addressing Palacios’s\nobjections. In that order, the district court made findings that (1) “Petitioner’s\nevidence did not affirmatively establish that Petitioner’s attorney made a false\nrepresentation of fact,” (2) there was “sufficient evidence to show that Petitioner\nwas aware that his state court writ had not been filed” as of January 29, 2010,\na date it deemed “sufficiently in advance of his February 24, 2010 deadline to\nallow him to take action to preserve his federal rights,” and (3) “the time\nbetween January 29, 2010 and February 24, 2010 was . . . . sufficient time to\nensure that the writ was filed.” Without specifying whether its equitable tolling\nruling was grounded in law or discretion, the district court granted the\ngovernment’s motion for summary judgment.\n       Though we question one legal basis on which the district court’s equitable\ntolling ruling appeared to rest,3 we may nonetheless affirm its dismissal of\nPalacios’s habeas petition if dismissal is justified by another ground supported\nby the record.

Facts bearing upon reasonable diligence inquiry\n       Palacios     highlights     the    following     record      facts   and    allegations\ndemonstrating his diligence: (1) Palacios hired Attorney Stephen McMains to file\nhis state habeas petition and represent him in state habeas proceedings on\nSeptember 14, 2009, five months before the expiration of the limitation period;\n(2) Palacios informed McMains by letter of the filing deadline at the time of his\nhiring; (3) Aida Cortez, Palacios’s wife, contacted McMains by phone and\ntraveled to McMains’s home and office to follow up with him about the status of\nthe habeas application; (4) when McMains was unresponsive, Cortez filed a\ngrievance against him with the Texas State Bar, and Palacios reminded him by\nletter of the expiration of the AEDPA one-year limitation period, directed him\nagain to file the state habeas petition, and gave him ten days to respond; (5)\nwhen McMains did not respond within the ten-day period, Palacios discharged\nMcMains by letter and requested “original copies [of court documents] and all my\ntranscripts as soon as possible”; (6) on the day Palacios purportedly received his\nfile back, he filed his state habeas application pro se.5\n       The Texas Attorney General’s Office responds by emphasizing the\nfollowing record facts which, it contends, indicate that Palacios “slept on his\nrights”: (1) Palacios waited to hire McMains for ten months after the denial of\nhis petition for discretionary review and seven months after his AEDPA\nlimitation period began to run; (2) Palacios discharged McMains on February 11,\n2010, 13 days before the expiration of the AEDPA limitation period, but did not\n\n\n       5\n         During oral argument, counsel for petitioner stated that Palacios did not receive his\nfile back “until March . . . after March 4th, well after the February 25th deadline.” The precise\ndate on which Palacios received his file back has not been documented or litigated. We will\nassume arguendo that Palacios received his file back on April 6, 2010, the date he filed his\nstate habeas petition.\n\n                                               7\n\f    Case: 11-41080     Document: 00512313292      Page: 8    Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41080\n\nfile a state habeas petition until April 6, 2010, more than a month after the\ndeadline; and (3) Palacios waited until February 25, 2011, 30 days after the\nTCCA’s denial of his state habeas petition, to file his federal habeas petition.\n      B.    Analysis\n      Of the many considerations bearing upon the reasonable diligence\nanalysis, three are most pertinent here: (1) Palacios waited seven months after\nlearning of the denial of his petition for discretionary review to hire an attorney,\n(2) after hiring McMains, Palacios directed him to file the petition, reminded him\nof the filing deadline, and inquired into the filing status, and (3) after firing\nMcMains with two weeks remaining on his AEDPA limitation period, aware that\nthe period was about to expire, Palacios did not file a state habeas petition or a\nprotective federal habeas petition within that period.\n            1.     Seven-month delay\n      Our first consideration on review is whether Palacios’s seven-month delay\nin hiring an attorney shows a lack of reasonable diligence.\n      We have held that state prisoners who were aware that their state post-\nconviction proceedings were no longer pending and waited to file federal habeas\npetitions between four and six months after the AEDPA limitation period began\nto run did not exercise reasonable diligence. See Melancon v. Kaylo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"24808\"><a href=\"/opinion/24808/melancon-v-kaylo/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 408 (5th Cir. 2001) (holding that petitioner had not shown reasonable\ndiligence because he “waited more than four months to file his federal habeas\npetition”); Coleman v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"18262\"><a href=\"/opinion/18262/coleman-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 403 (5th Cir. 1999) (per curiam)\n(holding that petitioner had not shown reasonable diligence because he “did not\nfile his § 2254 petition until approximately six months after learning of the\ndenial of his state postconviction application,” and “d[id] not explain the\nsix-month delay between being notified about his state application and filing his\nfederal petition”); Koumjian v. Thaler, 484 F. App’x 966, 969–70 (5th Cir. 2012)\n(per curiam) (unpublished) (holding that petitioner had not shown reasonable\n\n                                         8\n\f    Case: 11-41080     Document: 00512313292      Page: 9   Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41080\n\ndiligence because his delay in filing “exceed[ed] four and a half months”).\nPalacios does not distinguish these cases or identify countervailing precedent.\n      It could be argued that it follows a fortiori that Palacios, who did not hire\nan attorney, much less file a habeas petition, until seven months after learning\nof the denial of his petition for discretionary review, would similarly be unable\nto demonstrate reasonable diligence. But to hold that the reasonable diligence\noutcome here is dictated by Melancon, Coleman, and Koumjian would be to\nsuggest a bright-line rule that a prisoner does not exercise reasonable diligence\nif he does not hire an attorney within four months of the date his AEDPA\nlimitation period begins to run. Such a ruling would be in tension with our\nprevious observation that “equitable tolling does not lend itself to bright-line\nrules,” Fisher, 174 F.3d at 713, and the Supreme Court’s recent guidance that\nequitable tolling decisions “must be made on a case-by-case basis,” Holland, 130\nS. Ct. at 2563. Accordingly, we adhere to Melancon, Coleman, and Koumjian\nand factor them into our equitable tolling analysis, with awareness that the\n“specific circumstances” of this case could “warrant special treatment.” Holland,\n130 S. Ct. at 2563; see also Williams v. Thaler, 400 F. App’x 886, 890–91 (5th Cir.\n2010) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citing equitable tolling caselaw and noting:\n“Though we are guided by this precedent, we are mindful of the dangers of\ncreating a rule regarding the specific timeframe in which a petitioner must\ninquire regarding the status of his state habeas application in order to\ndemonstrate diligence. Rather, the circumstances of each case, taken together,\nmust determine whether a particular petitioner was diligent in pursuing his\nclaims and, therefore, entitled to equitable tolling.”).\n            2.     Diligence after hiring McMains\n      Our second consideration on review is whether Palacios exercised\nreasonable diligence after hiring McMains, which we assess by comparing the\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f    Case: 11-41080     Document: 00512313292      Page: 10   Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41080\n\ndiligence exercised by Palacios to the diligence exercised by petitioners faced with\ncomparable instances of attorney abandonment. Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2563.\n      Recent decisions addressing the equitable tolling ramifications of attorney\nabandonment are illustrative. In Holland, the Supreme Court concluded that\npetitioner had shown reasonable diligence by: “wr[iting] his attorney numerous\nletters seeking crucial information and providing direction”; “repeatedly\ncontact[ing] the state courts, their clerks, and the Florida State Bar Association\nin an effort to have [his attorney]—the central impediment to the pursuit of his\nlegal remedy—removed from his case; and “prepar[ing] his own habeas petition\npro se and promptly fil[ing] it with the District Court” on “the very day that [he]\ndiscovered that his AEDPA clock had expired due to [his attorney’s] failings.” Id.\nat 2565. We recently applied Holland’s teachings in Manning v. Epps, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">688</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">177</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2012), and Arita v. Cain, 500 F. App’x 352 (5th Cir. 2012) (per\ncuriam). In Manning, we concluded that a petitioner had not shown reasonable\ndiligence because, for a period of 19 months after he knew his conviction had\nbecome final, he relied on his appointed attorneys to file his habeas petition\nwithout directing them to file the petition or inquiring into its status. 688 F.3d\nat 184–86. In Arita, we concluded that a petitioner had not shown reasonable\ndiligence because he “never instructed [counsel] to file a [state or] federal habeas\npetition”; did not discharge non-responsive counsel until seven months after the\nfiling deadline had passed; waited more than a month to file his state habeas\npetition after hiring new counsel; and did not file a “protective” federal habeas\npetition preserving his federal remedies until his state remedies had been\nexhausted. 500 F. App’x at 353–55. These cases establish that “petitioners\nseeking to establish due diligence must exercise diligence even when they receive\ninadequate legal representation,” Manning, 688 F.3d at 185, and serve as\nguideposts for what constitutes reasonable diligence in the face of attorney\nabandonment.\n\n                                        10\n\f    Case: 11-41080     Document: 00512313292       Page: 11    Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 11-41080\n\n      Assuming arguendo that Cortez’s efforts on Palacios’s behalf may be\nattributed to Palacios, an issue not briefed by the parties, we perceive that\nPalacios’s diligence after hiring McMains is on par with Holland’s: both\npetitioners wrote their attorneys “numerous letters seeking crucial information\nand providing direction,” and, when their attorneys were unresponsive, filed\ngrievances with the state bar association, discharged their attorneys, and\npromptly prepared pro se habeas petitions. 130 S. Ct. at 2565. Moreover, unlike\nManning and Arita, Palacios unambiguously directed McMains to file the\npetition, and discharged him before the filing deadline when it became apparent\nhe was not going to perform the sole task for which he had been hired.\nAccordingly, “draw[ing] upon decisions made in other similar cases for\nguidance,” Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2563, and assuming without deciding that\nCortez’s efforts are factored into the analysis, we conclude that, after hiring\nMcMains, Palacios exercised reasonable diligence in pursuing state post-\nconviction relief.\n             3.      Protective federal habeas petition\n      Whether Palacios exercised reasonable diligence in pursuing federal post-\nconviction relief is a closer call. Palacios filed his federal habeas petition within\n30 days of the TCCA’s denial of his state habeas petition, but did so one year\nafter his AEDPA limitation period expired. Palacios could have prevented its\nexpiration by timely filing a “protective” federal habeas petition. Our third\nconsideration is whether Palacios’s failure to do so shows a lack of reasonable\ndiligence.\n      In Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142891\"><a href=\"/opinion/142891/pace-v-diguglielmo/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 416 (2005), the Supreme Court\nnoted that one option for prisoners unsure whether their state habeas petitions\nhave been or will be timely filed is to file “a ‘protective’ petition in federal court\nand [to] ask[] the federal court to stay and abey the federal habeas proceedings\nuntil state remedies are exhausted.” The Supreme Court did not indicate\n\n                                         11\n\f    Case: 11-41080     Document: 00512313292       Page: 12    Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 11-41080\n\nwhether a prisoner’s failure to file a protective petition alone demonstrates a\nlack of reasonable diligence, a question this court has since raised but declined\nto resolve. See Madden v. Thaler, No. 11-10690, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1319349</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6 (5th\nCir. Apr. 3, 2013) (per curiam) (unpublished) (stating that the court “need not\ndecide . . . whether a prisoner must file a protective petition to establish that he\nwas acting with the requisite diligence”); Howland v. Quarterman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1435067\"><a href=\"/opinion/1435067/howland-v-quarterman/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">840</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n846 (5th Cir. 2007) (“We expressly decline to determine whether a ‘protective’\npetition is necessary [to get the benefit of equitable tolling].”), abrogated on other\ngrounds by Campbell v.

Crim. App. 2010).\n      In keeping with our disinclination to create bright-line rules constraining\nour equitable tolling analysis, we decline to hold that the failure to file a\nprotective petition alone prevents a prisoner from receiving equitable tolling.\nWe note, additionally, that Palacios’s failure to file a protective federal habeas\npetition is mitigated by (1) the limited time period—13 days—in which he had\nto file it, and (2) the allegation that he lacked access to his file until after the\nexpiration of the AEDPA limitation period. Under the circumstances, Palacios’s\nfailure to file a protective federal habeas petition weighs against, but is not\ndispositive of, the reasonable diligence inquiry.\n      C.     Balancing\n      Acknowledging it is a close case, we affirm the district court’s judgment\nthat Palacios is not entitled to equitable tolling on the basis that he failed to\nexercise reasonable diligence. Weighed heavily in our analysis is Palacios’s\nlengthy, unexcused delay in hiring an attorney. We grant that it may take time\nfor a state prisoner without full access to phones and internet to find, meet with,\nand retain an attorney. We allow also that it may be proper for us to exempt\nfrom consideration time spent by prisoners in administrative segregation and\nmedical and psychiatric wards. See, e.g., Fisher, 174 F.3d at 715 (“We have\nrecognized the possibility that mental incompetency might support equitable\n\n                                         12\n\f    Case: 11-41080        Document: 00512313292           Page: 13      Date Filed: 07/18/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 11-41080\n\ntolling of a limitation period. Combined with forced confinement and medication,\nno access to legal materials, and the temporary loss of one’s glasses, a pro se\npetitioner such as Fisher simply cannot pursue his legal rights during such a\nperiod.”) (citation omitted).         But Palacios took seven months to retain an\nattorney—more than half of the limitation period—and, notably, does not offer\na reason for the delay. Moreover, after having discharged his attorney with two\nweeks remaining on his AEDPA limitation period—giving him a chance to meet\nthe deadline notwithstanding his attorney’s alleged misconduct—he did not file\na protective federal habeas petition to preserve his federal remedies. The\ndistrict court found that, under the circumstances, two weeks was enough time\n“to allow [Palacios] to take action to preserve his federal rights.” We agree. In\nshort, though Palacios demonstrated reasonable diligence during the latter half\nof the limitation period, it was not enough to make up for his earlier and\nsubsequent delay.6\n                                      CONCLUSION\n       The district court’s dismissal of Palacios’s federal habeas petition is\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          Having so concluded, we decline to decide whether his attorney’s alleged\nmisrepresentation and abandonment qualifies as an “extraordinary circumstance,” and\nwhether it “prevented” timely filing. See Manning, 688 F.3d at 184–90 (“assum[ing] without\ndeciding” that the “extraordinary circumstance” prong is satisfied); Arita, 500 F. App’x at 354\n(“We need not decide whether Williams’s conduct was merely negligent or, to the contrary,\nsufficiently egregious to be considered rare and extraordinary; Arita is not entitled to equitable\ntolling anyway, because he failed to pursue his rights diligently.”). We trust that the\nallegations of attorney misconduct raised in this appeal have been investigated and resolved\nby the Texas Office of the Chief Disciplinary Counsel, to whom petitioner’s grievance was\naddressed.\n\n                                               13\n\f</pre>",
