The Section\n\n7 claim was resolved on summary judgment, with the district court concluding\n\nthat the defendant officials responsible for overseeing New Mexico’s Human\n\nServices Department (HSD) violated the NVRA by failing to provide voter\n\nregistration forms to those applicants for public assistance who left the Section 7-\n\nmandated declination form blank. The Section 5 claim, which alleged that New\n\nMexico’s motor vehicle authority offices failed to provide necessary voter\n\nregistration services, was resolved by written settlement agreement. Although\n\ntwo of the settling agencies reimbursed plaintiffs for a portion of the attorneys’\n\nfees and expenses plaintiffs incurred in litigating the Section 5 claim, the New\n\nMexico Secretary of State refused to contribute. Plaintiffs subsequently sought\n\nand were granted attorneys’ fees and expenses related to the Section 5 claim\n\nagainst the Secretary of State.\n\n      In Appeal No. 11-2063, defendants appeal from the district court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment on the Section 7 claim. In Appeal No. 11-2084, the Secretary\n\nof State appeals from the district court’s order granting plaintiffs’ application for\n\nattorneys’ fees and expenses arising out of the Section 5 claim. Exercising\n\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we affirm the district court in all\n\nregards.\n\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f                                   I. Background\n\n                                 Appeal No. 11-2063\n\n      Generally speaking, Section 7 of the NVRA requires state public assistance\n\noffices to be designated as voter registration agencies and, in turn, to distribute\n\nwith each application for public assistance a mail voter registration application\n\nform, unless the applicant, in writing, declines to register to vote.\n\n      It is undisputed that HSD qualifies as a state public assistance office under\n\nthe NVRA. More specifically, HSD administers public assistance programs in\n\nNew Mexico, including the Food Stamp Program, Temporary Assistance to Needy\n\nFamilies, and Medicaid. In accordance with the NVRA, the State of New Mexico\n\n“has designated HSD as a voter registration agency pursuant to the NVRA.” Aplt.\n\nApp. at 152.\n\n      HSD does not attach voter registration applications “to applications for\n\npublic assistance, recertification or renewal applications, or change of address\n\nforms.” Id. Nor does HSD automatically distribute voter registration applications\n\nto all applicants for HSD-related benefits. “Instead, HSD includes, as part of\n\nmost of its benefit application forms, a section that it refers to as a ‘declination\n\nprovision.’” Id. The declination provision, which is typically included as a\n\nseparately designated section in the middle of a multi-page benefits application\n\nform, provides as follows:\n\n      If YOU are NOT registered to vote where you live now, would\n\n                                           5\n\f      you like to register to vote here today? (Please check one) G YES\n      G NO\n\n      IF YOU DO NOT CHECK EITHER BOX, YOU WILL BE\n      CONSIDERED TO HAVE DECIDED NOT TO REGISTER TO\n      VOTE AT THIS TIME.\n\n      The NATIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION ACT provides you\n      with the opportunity to register to vote at this location. If you would\n      like help in filling out a voter registration application form, we will\n      help you. The decision whether to seek or accept help is yours. You\n      may fill out the application form in private. IMPORTANT:\n      Applying to register or declining to register to vote WILL NOT\n      AFFECT the amount of assistance that you will be provided by\n      this agency.\n\n      Signature                                           Date\n\n      CONFIDENTIALITY: Whether you decide to register to vote or\n      not, your decision will remain confidential. IF YOU BELIEVE\n      THAT SOMEONE HAS INTERFERED with your right to\n      register or to decline to register to vote, or your right to privacy\n      in deciding whether to register or in applying to register to vote,\n      or your right to choose your own political party or other political\n      preference, you may file a complaint with the Office of the\n      Secretary of State, 419 State Capital, Santa Fe, NM, 87503,\n      (phone: 1-800-477-3632.)\n\nId. at 153 (emphasis in original).\n\n      Prior to this lawsuit, HSD’s policy, which it believed was compliant with\n\nSection 7 of the NVRA, was to provide a benefits applicant with a voter\n\nregistration application form only if he or she checked “YES” on the declination\n\nprovision or verbally indicated that he or she would like to register to vote. As a\n\nresult, HSD did not provide voter registration application forms to benefits\n\napplicants who left the declination provision blank and who did not otherwise\n\n                                         6\n\frespond “yes” if a verbal inquiry regarding voter registration was made by an\n\nHSD employee.\n\n      On July 9, 2009, four New Mexico residents — including Roanna Begay —\n\nand the nonprofit organization Association of Community Organizations for\n\nReform Now (ACORN) initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint against six\n\nNew Mexico state officials, four of whom were responsible for overseeing HSD\n\n(the remaining two officials were associated with New Mexico’s Taxation and\n\nRevenue Department and its associated Motor Vehicle Division and are not part\n\nof Appeal No. 11-2063). The complaint, in pertinent part, sought declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief to redress ongoing violations of HSD’s obligations under Section\n\n7 of the NVRA.\n\n      Through subsequent pleadings, Shawna Allers became the sole plaintiff\n\nasserting the Section 7 claim. Plaintiffs were granted leave to file a first amended\n\ncomplaint substituting Allers for Roanna Begay as the individual plaintiff to bring\n\nthe NVRA Section 7 against HSD. Then, the district court granted the parties’\n\nstipulated motion to dismiss ACORN from the case. The parties noted in their\n\nstipulation that “ACORN ha[d] closed its offices in New Mexico and no longer\n\nplan[ned] to provide voter registration assistance in the state,” and thus was “not\n\nan appropriate Plaintiff in th[e] case.” Id. at 28.\n\n      Allers moved for partial summary judgment against defendants on her\n\nclaims that HSD had violated Section 7 of the NVRA. In that motion, Allers\n\n                                           7\n\fasserted that “HSD’s . . . policy regarding the distribution of voter registration\n\napplications [wa]s deficient because it fail[ed] to require HSD employees to\n\ndistribute a voter registration application to all persons who appear[ed] at HSD\n\noffices to apply for public assistance benefits, recertify or renew their benefits, or\n\nsubmit a change of address, who d[id] not check either ‘yes’ or the ‘no’ box on\n\nHSD’s voter information (‘declination’) form.” Id. at 33.\n\n      The district court subsequently granted Allers’ motion for partial summary\n\njudgment. The district court concluded that “Section 7 [of the NVRA] requires\n\nthat [HSD’s] clients be provided with a mail voter registration form unless they\n\naffirmatively decline, in writing.” Id. at 161. In turn, the district court concluded\n\nthat “HSD’s . . . declination form and policy d[id] not meet this requirement.” Id.\n\n      Following the grant of partial summary judgment, Allers and defendants\n\nfiled a joint motion asking the district court to sign and enter their proposed\n\nconsent order. The proposed consent order “establish[ed] specific procedures that\n\nHSD w[ould] follow for distributing voter registration applications, and for\n\nproviding assistance to clients in completing these forms.” Id. “The proposed\n\norder also require[d] that HSD employees who interact with public assistance\n\nclients receive voter registration training, that HSD and the Secretary of State\n\ncollect and maintain voter registration data to track their implementation of the\n\norder, and that HSD and the Secretary of State undertake a variety of measures to\n\nmonitor compliance with the terms of the order.” Id. In addition, the proposed\n\n                                           8\n\fconsent order preserved defendants’ right to appeal the district court’s grant of\n\nAllers’ motion for partial summary judgment.\n\n         The district court granted the joint motion and entered the proposed consent\n\norder. The defendants have filed a timely notice of appeal from the consent\n\norder.\n\n                                  Appeal No. 11-2084\n\n         The other three individual plaintiffs in the case — Cecilia Valdez, Graciela\n\nGrajeda, and Jessie Rodriguez — asserted claims under Section 5 of the NVRA\n\nagainst the officials responsible for overseeing New Mexico’s Taxation and\n\nRevenue Department (TRD) and its associated Motor Vehicle Division (MVD).\n\nSection 5 of the NVRA provides, in pertinent part, that “[e]ach State motor\n\nvehicle driver’s license application . . . submitted to the appropriate State motor\n\nvehicle authority under State law shall serve as an application for voter\n\nregistration with respect to elections for Federal office . . . .” 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1973gg-3(a)(1). The complaint in this case alleged that, “[d]espite the clear\n\nobligations under Section 5 of the NVRA, New Mexico’s motor vehicle authority\n\noffices routinely fail[ed] to provide any voter registration services at all, much\n\nless the integrated application process required by law.” Aplt. App. at 3.\n\n         On July 1, 2010, the parties entered into a written settlement agreement\n\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\fresolving the Section 5 claims. 1 The settlement agreement required the Office of\n\nthe Secretary of State, TRD, and local TRD and MVD offices to implement\n\ncertain staffing structures, including the Secretary of State’s designation of a new\n\nstaff position called the “State NVRA Coordinator.” Id. at 80. The settlement\n\nagreement also contained a section entitled “ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND\n\nEXPENSES” that provided as follows:\n\n       Plaintiffs shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and\n       litigation expenses. The parties shall confer in good faith to resolve\n       the amount and payment of attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses.\n       If the parties are unable to reach agreement with respect to attorneys’\n       fees for Plaintiffs’ TRD claim within thirty days of the execution of\n       this Agreement, the Plaintiffs shall submit their attorneys’ fee\n       application for that claim to Judge Herrera no later than forty-five\n       days after execution of this Agreement.\n\nId. at 90.\n\n       The plaintiffs subsequently resolved their claims for attorneys’ fees and\n\nlitigation expenses against TRD and MVD for a total of $200,000. The Secretary\n\nof State, however, refused to pay any portion of the requested fees and expenses.\n\nConsequently, plaintiffs filed with the district court an application for attorneys’\n\nfees and expenses from the Secretary of State. The application sought to recover\n\n$67,585.66 comprised of “the following: 1) the balance of the attorneys’ fee\n\n\n       1\n         The parties to the settlement agreement included the three individual\nplaintiffs and defendants Mary Herrera, the New Mexico Secretary of State, Rick\nHomans, the Secretary of TRD, and Michael Sandoval, the Director of MVD.\nNew Mexico’s current Secretary of State, Dianna Duran, was substituted as the\nnamed party after the settlement agreement was entered into.\n\n                                         10\n\flodestar regarding the Section 5 claim; 2) the time expended preparing the . . .\n\napplication; and 3) a pro rata share of travel time at 50 percent of the hourly\n\nrates.” Id. at 97. The application noted that “[t]he lodestar fees claimed” against\n\nthe Secretary of State “simply represent[ed] the difference between the total\n\nSection 5 lodestar and the TRD/MVD settlement.” Id. The application further\n\nnoted that although “the TRD/MVD settlement covered not only lodestar hours\n\nbut also expenses related to the Section 5 claim,” plaintiffs “ha[d] elected to treat\n\nthe entire $200,000 TRD/MVD settlement amount as applying toward the\n\nlodestar, [thereby] directly reducing the lodestar amount claimed against the\n\nSecretary of State.” Id. at 98 n.5. According to the application and supporting\n\ndocuments, the fees and expenses incurred in preparing the application totaled\n\n$23,115.\n\n      The Secretary of State opposed the application, arguing that plaintiffs\n\n“ha[d] already [resolved] their fee request on th[e] [Section 5] claim and c[ould\n\nnot] meet the ‘prevailing party’ threshold necessary for such an award” against\n\nthe Secretary of State. Id. at 329. More specifically, the Secretary of State\n\nargued that plaintiffs, “by segregating their fees by claim and not by defendant,”\n\nand by accepting payment from TRD/MVD, “ha[d] settled their attorneys’ fees\n\nclaim for all of their Section 5 work.” Id. at 330. “Any other outcome,” the\n\nSecretary of State argued, “beg[ged] absurd results because it untether[ed] the fee\n\nrequest from its bedrock basis - the lodestar.” Id. at 332. Alternatively, the\n\n                                          11\n\fSecretary of State argued that plaintiffs were not prevailing parties because\n\n“[p]laintiffs and the [Secretary of State] st[oo]d in precisely the same legal\n\nrelationship to one another after entry of the settlement as before.” Id. at 335.\n\nMoreover, the Secretary of State argued, she had done nothing to violate the\n\nNVRA. Id. at 335-36. Lastly, the Secretary of State argued that plaintiffs’\n\napplication failed to substantiate, through a lodestar calculation, the amount they\n\nhad requested. Id. at 336.\n\n      In their reply brief, plaintiffs asserted that the Secretary of State and the\n\nother two defendants had, under the terms of the settlement agreement, “agreed to\n\npay Plaintiffs’ reasonable attorneys’ fees.” Id. at 350. Plaintiffs in turn argued\n\nthat, because the amount paid by TRD/MVD was “less than the lodestar amount\n\nowed to Plaintiffs,” the Secretary of State “[wa]s liable to Plaintiffs for the\n\nunpaid amount.” Id. As for the Secretary of State’s assertion that plaintiffs had\n\nfailed to establish that they were prevailing parties or that the Secretary of State\n\nhad violated the NVRA, the plaintiffs noted that the Secretary of State had, under\n\nthe terms of the settlement agreement, agreed that she was liable for fees and\n\nexpenses, and that plaintiffs were thus relieved from having to establish anything\n\nfurther. Finally, plaintiffs argued, they “already ha[d] fully substantiated their\n\nlodestar calculation of the amount requested for attorneys’ fees, both in their\n\ninitial” application and the supporting exhibits thereto. Id. at 350-51.\n\n      The district court granted plaintiffs’ application for attorneys’ fees and\n\n                                          12\n\fexpenses. In doing so, the district court noted that “[p]laintiffs’ attorneys\n\nexpended a total of 910 hours litigating the Section 5 claim, not including travel\n\ntime,” all of which were “documented in declarations and meticulous, highly-\n\ndetailed time records attached to their fee application.” Id. at 380. The district\n\ncourt further noted that although plaintiffs’ attorneys “almost exclusively\n\npractic[ed] out of state,” they sought “fees based on local rates rather than their\n\nusual, much higher, customary rates.” Id. The total lodestar calculation\n\nassociated with the Section 5 claim, the district court noted, was $241,147.38, and\n\n“[t]he $41,174.38 that Plaintiffs s[ought] from the [Secretary of State]\n\nrepresent[ed] the difference between the total Section 5 lodestar and the\n\nTRD/MVD settlement.” Id. at 381. Indeed, the court noted, plaintiffs’\n\n“methodology appear[ed] to result in a lower amount claimed against the\n\n[Secretary of State] than could validly be claimed” because the amount paid by\n\nTRD/MVD “covered not only lodestar hours, but also expenses, but Plaintiffs\n\nha[d] elected to treat the entire $200,000 . . . amount as applying toward the\n\nlodestar amount, which directly reduce[d] the lodestar amount claimed against the\n\n[Secretary of State].” Id. n.4. As for the amount sought by plaintiffs for\n\npreparing the fee application, the district court concluded it was “not excessive,”\n\n“given the complexity of the litigation involved, the number of attorneys from\n\nmany different firms working together on the issues, and the thoroughness of the\n\npackage that Plaintiffs submitted.” Id.\n\n                                          13\n\f      The district court rejected each of the arguments urged by the Secretary of\n\nState in opposition to plaintiffs’ application. To begin with, the district court\n\ncharacterized as “incorrect” the Secretary of State’s assertion that plaintiffs,\n\naccepting payment from TRD/MVD, “gave up their rights to any further\n\nremuneration from the” Secretary of State. Id. at 382. Instead, the district court\n\nconcluded, TRD/MVD’s payment “only terminated TRD/MVD’s obligations to\n\npay attorneys’ fees and costs,” and left the Secretary of State’s obligation intact.\n\nId. at 383. Moreover, the district court concluded, “Plaintiffs were not made\n\nwhole on their fee request when they accepted TRD/MVD’s offer.” Id. (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted). The district court also concluded that “the\n\namount sought by Plaintiffs [from the Secretary of State] [wa]s eminently\n\nreasonable,” and far less than “the full lodestar amount that they ha[d]\n\ndocumented ($256,054.25) as well as documented litigation expenses\n\n($32,615.24), reduced by the $200,000 payment from TRD/MVD.” Id. at 384. In\n\nother words, the district court concluded, plaintiffs would have been justified in\n\nseeking from the Secretary of State an award “of $88,669.49, rather than the\n\n$41,174.38 that they s[ought].” Id.\n\n      The district court in turn rejected the Secretary of State’s assertions that\n\nplaintiffs were not a “prevailing party” under the NVRA because they did not\n\nobtain an enforceable judgment on the merits, and that the settlement agreement\n\ncould not confer prevailing party status on plaintiffs because it was not subject to\n\n                                          14\n\fjudicial approval. In doing so, the district court noted that the settlement\n\nagreement “specifically provide[d] that all Defendants [we]re liable to Plaintiffs\n\nfor ‘reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses.’” Id. at 385. “This\n\nagreement,” the district court noted, “d[id] not rely on a finding that Plaintiffs\n\n[we]re a ‘prevailing party’ for NVRA purposes to create liability for attorneys’\n\nfees and litigation costs; such liability [wa]s [instead] established on the face of\n\nthe Settlement Agreement.” Id. The district court further noted that, under Tenth\n\nCircuit precedent, “a court’s decision on the merits [wa]s not required for a\n\nplaintiff to recover fees and costs as a prevailing party,” and that in this case,\n\n“Plaintiffs’ suit resulted in significant changes in how New Mexico\n\nimplement[ed] Section 5 of the NVRA, and [plaintiffs thus] would rightfully be\n\nconsidered a prevailing party.” Id. Relatedly, the district court rejected the\n\nSecretary of State’s assertion that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that she\n\nviolated the NVRA in any way. The district court noted that it “ha[d] explicitly\n\nrejected the [Secretary of State’s] argument that, as the ‘chief election official’\n\nfor New Mexico, she d[id] not bear any responsibility for the state’s failure to\n\ncomply with the NVRA,” and that, in any event, the settlement agreement did not\n\n“condition her liability [for fees and costs] on any offer of proof by Plaintiffs that\n\nshe violated the NVRA.” Id. at 386.\n\n      Lastly, the district court rejected the Secretary of State’s assertion that the\n\namount sought against her from plaintiffs was unjustified. The district court\n\n                                           15\n\femphasized that the settlement agreement “d[id] not subdivide or partition\n\nPlaintiffs’ Section 5 claim, nor d[id] it subdivide the work performed in litigating\n\nand settling the claim for purposes of allocating fees,” and instead “expressly\n\nprovide[d] that both the [Secretary] and the TRD/MVD Defendants [we]re\n\nresponsible for paying reasonable attorneys’ fees to Plaintiffs.” Id. at 386. “Had\n\nthe [Secretary of State] intended to limit her liability for fees to those hours\n\nworked directly with respect to her counsel,” the district court concluded, “she\n\ncould have attempted to negotiate such a provision in the Settlement Agreement.”\n\nId. at 386-87. In any event, the district court concluded, “[t]he absence of a fee\n\npartition within the Settlement Agreement [wa]s reasonable, because Plaintiffs’\n\nSection 5 claim involve[d] a common core of facts that required Plaintiffs to\n\nobtain information from, and assess the conduct of, several Defendants, each of\n\nwhom bore some responsibility for the alleged violations.” Id. at 387. And, the\n\ndistrict court concluded, even assuming, for purposes of argument, that “degree of\n\nsuccess [wa]s relevant, Plaintiffs ha[d] demonstrated significant success against\n\nthe [Secretary of State] as a result of their settlement.” Id.\n\n      The Secretary of State appealed from the district court’s order granting\n\nplaintiffs’ application for fees and expenses.\n\n                                     II. Analysis\n\n                                 Appeal No. 11-2063\n\n      In Appeal No. 11-2063, the HSD-related defendants challenge the district\n\n                                          16\n\fcourt’s grant of partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiff Allers on her\n\nclaims under Section 7 of the NVRA. According to defendants, the district court\n\nmisconstrued the provisions of Section 7. Alternatively, defendants assert that\n\nplaintiffs’ counsel should be estopped from taking a position before the district\n\ncourt in this case that is inconsistent with the position they took before a federal\n\ndistrict court in Indiana in a similar Section 7 case.\n\n      a) Standard of review\n\n      “We review summary judgment decisions de novo, applying the same legal\n\nstandard as the district court.” Tuckel v. Grover, 660 F.3d 1249, 1251 (10th Cir.\n\n2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Summary judgment is appropriate\n\nwhen “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n      b) The district court’s construction of Section 7\n\n      Section 7 of the NVRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-5, is entitled “Voter\n\nregistration agencies.” As an initial matter, Section 7 generally requires “[e]ach\n\nState [to] designate agencies for the registration of voters in elections for Federal\n\noffice,” and in particular to “designate as voter registration agencies . . . all\n\noffices in the State that provide public assistance” or “State-funded programs\n\nprimarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities.” 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1973gg-5(a)(1) & (a)(2). Section 7 in turn requires each designated voter\n\nregistration agency to provide the following three services:\n\n                                           17\n\f      (i) Distribution of mail voter registration application forms . . . .\n      (ii) Assistance to applicants in completing voter registration\n      application forms, unless the applicant refuses such assistance.\n      (iii) Acceptance of completed voter registration application forms for\n      transmittal to the appropriate State election official.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-5(a)(4)(A).\n\n      If a designated voter registration agency “is an office that provides service\n\nor assistance in addition to conducting voter registration,” Section 7 outlines in\n\ndetail how that agency is to fulfill its three general duties. Specifically, Section 7\n\nrequires that agency to\n\n         (A) distribute with each application for such service or assistance,\n      and with each recertification, renewal, or change of address form\n      relating to such service or assistance—\n                (I) the mail voter registration application form described in\n             section 1973gg-7(a)(2) of this title . . . or\n                (ii) the office’s own form if it is equivalent to the form\n             described in section 19733gg-7(a)(2) of this title,\n      unless the applicant, in writing, declines to register to vote;\n\n         (B) provide a form that includes—\n               (I) the question, “If you are not registered to vote where\n            you live now, would you like to apply to register to vote here\n            today?”;\n               (ii) if the agency provides public assistance, the statement,\n            “Applying to register or declining to register to vote will not\n            affect the amount of assistance that you will be provided by\n            this agency.”;\n               (iii) boxes for the applicant to check to indicate whether the\n            applicant would like to register or declines to register to vote\n            (failure to check either box being deemed to constitute a\n            declination to register for purposes of subparagraph (C)),\n            together with the statement (in close proximity to the boxes\n            and in prominent type), “IF YOU DO NOT CHECK EITHER\n            BOX, YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE DECIDED\n            NOT TO REGISTER TO VOTE AT THIS TIME.”;\n\n                                          18\n\f                (iv) the statement, “If you would like help in filling out the\n             voter registration application form, we will help you. The\n             decision whether to seek or accept help is yours. You may fill\n             out the application in private.”; and\n                (v) the statement, “If you believe that someone has\n             interfered with your right to register or to decline to register to\n             vote, your right to privacy in deciding whether to register or in\n             applying to register to vote, or your right to choose your own\n             political party or other political preference, you may file a\n             complaint with __________.”, the blank being filled by the\n             name, address, and telephone number of the appropriate\n             official to whom such a complaint should be addressed; and\n\n         (C) provide to each applicant who does not decline to register to\n      vote the same degree of assistance with regard to the completion of\n      the registration application form as is provided by the office with\n      regard to the completion of its own forms, unless the applicant\n      refuses such assistance.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-5(a)(6).\n\n      In this case, it is undisputed that HSD provides public assistance, has been\n\ndesignated by the State of New Mexico as a voter registration agency under\n\nSection 7, and is therefore subject to the obligations outlined above. It is further\n\nundisputed that HSD, in attempting to comply with those obligations, has adopted\n\na policy and practice of providing voter registration forms only to those\n\napplicants who check the “YES” box on the declination form mandated by Section\n\n7 (§ 1973gg-5(a)(6)(B)) or orally request a voter registration form. In other\n\nwords, HSD has interpreted Section 7 as requiring an applicant to “opt in” to\n\nreceiving a voter registration form, and, consequently, HSD does not provide\n\nvoter registration forms to those applicants who check “NO” on the declination\n\n\n                                          19\n\fform or leave the declination form blank (i.e., do not check either the “YES” or\n\n“NO” box on the declination form). At issue in this appeal is whether HSD’s\n\npolicy and practice of not providing voter registration forms to applicants who\n\nleave the declination form blank violates HSD’s obligations under Section 7.\n\n      HSD’s policy and practice appears to be based largely, if not exclusively,\n\non the provisions of § 1973gg-5(a)(6)(B). Subsection (B), as noted above,\n\noutlines the information that must be included in the declination form given by\n\nHSD to its applicants for services and assistance. In pertinent part, it requires the\n\ndeclination form to include “boxes for the applicant to check to indicate whether\n\nthe applicant would like to register or declines to register to vote, . . . together\n\nwith the statement (in close proximity to the boxes and prominent type), ‘IF YOU\n\nDO NOT CHECK EITHER BOX, YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE\n\nDECIDED NOT TO REGISTER TO VOTE AT THIS TIME.’” 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1973gg-5(a)(6)(B)(iii). HSD argues that this capitalized written admonition to\n\napplicants means that if an applicant does not check either the “YES” or “NO”\n\nbox on the declination form, the applicant must be deemed to have decided not to\n\nvote, and in turn HSD is relieved of its obligation to provide that applicant with a\n\nvoter registration form.\n\n      HSD’s position is directly rebutted by the language of § 1973gg-5(a)(6)(A).\n\nSubsection (A), as noted, requires a designated voter registration agency to\n\nprovide an applicant with a voter registration form “unless the applicant, in\n\n                                           20\n\fwriting, declines to register to vote.” Although neither subsection (A) nor any\n\nother subsection of the statute expressly defines the key phrase “in writing,” it is\n\ncommonly defined to mean “[t]he state or condition of having been written or\n\npenned; written form.” Oxford English Dictionary, Online Edition, Sept. 2011,\n\nhttp://www.oed.com/view/Entry/230775?rskey=bbJo54&result=2&isAdvanced\n\n=false#eid14009491 (last visited January 25, 2012). Thus, subsection (A) must be\n\ninterpreted as requiring a designated voter registration agency to provide an\n\napplicant with a voter registration form unless the applicant declines, in written\n\nform, to register to vote. As applied to the facts presented in this case, subsection\n\n(A) thus requires HSD to provide a benefits applicant with a voter registration\n\nform unless that applicant specifically checks the “NO” box on the declination\n\nform provided by HSD. In other words, an applicant’s failure to check either the\n\n“YES” or “NO” box on the declination form does not constitute a declination “in\n\nwriting.” Thus, in sum, subsection (A) requires an applicant to affirmatively, by\n\nway of writing, “opt out” of receiving a voter registration form.\n\n      HSD argues, however, that the phrase “in writing,” as employed in\n\nsubsection (A), is “essentially define[d]” by subsection (B) to include either a\n\ncheck in the “NO” box on the declination form “or by leaving the [declination]\n\nform blank.” Aplt. Br. at 11. The problem with HSD’s argument is three-fold.\n\nFirst, HSD’s proposed interpretation of the phrase “in writing” is clearly at odds\n\nwith the ordinary meaning of that phrase, and there is no express indication by\n\n                                          21\n\fCongress that it intended for the phrase, as used in Section 7, “to carry a\n\nspecialized—and indeed, unusual—meaning.” See Hamilton v. Lanning, 130 S.\n\nCt. 2464, 2474 (2010). Consequently, there is no legitimate basis for us to adopt\n\nthe definition suggested by HSD. Second, HSD’s proposed interpretation of the\n\nphrase “in writing” renders superfluous the portion of the written admonition in\n\nsubsection (B) that states, “AT THIS TIME.” Although HSD’s position is that an\n\napplicant’s failure to check either the “YES” or “NO” box must be interpreted as\n\na decision by the applicant not to register to vote at all, the phrase “AT THIS\n\nTIME” means that the failure must instead be interpreted simply as a decision by\n\nthe applicant not to register to vote at that time, i.e., at the time they are present\n\nin one of HSD’s offices seeking services or assistance. As plaintiffs suggest, it\n\nis conceivable that an applicant who chooses not to register to vote “at that time”\n\nmight still be interested in receiving a mail voter registration form and completing\n\nit at another time and/or location. And third, Congress made clear, by way of the\n\nlanguage contained in the first parenthetical in subsection (B)(iii), that an\n\napplicant’s failure to check either box on the declination form must only be\n\n“deemed to constitute a declination to register for purposes of subparagraph (C),”\n\ni.e., it relieves the agency from its duty to provide the applicant with assistance in\n\ncompleting a voter registration form. Had Congress intended for an applicant’s\n\nfailure to check either box to also relieve the agency of its obligation under\n\nsubsection (A) to provide a voter registration form, it presumably would have said\n\n                                           22\n\fso.\n\n      At oral argument, HSD asserted for the first time that the interpretation\n\nadopted by the district court created tension between the provisions of subsections\n\n(B)(iii) and (B)(iv). From a jurisprudential standpoint, we are under no obligation\n\nto consider this argument. See, e.g., Corder v. Lewis Palmer Sch. Dist. No. 38,\n\n566 F.3d 1219, 1235 n.8 (10th Cir. 2011) (“An argument made for the first time at\n\noral argument . . . will not be considered.”). And, in any event, we find no merit\n\nto it. Subsection (B)(iii) requires the declination form to advise an applicant of\n\nthe effect of not checking either box on the form: they will be considered to have\n\ndecided not to register to vote at that time. Subsection (B)(iv), in turn, requires\n\nthe declination form to advise an applicant that if they “would like help in filling\n\nout the voter registration application form,” the agency “will help” them. It also\n\nrequires the declination form to advise the applicant that “[t]he decision whether\n\nto seek or accept help is [theirs],” and that they “may fill out the [voter\n\nregistration] application in private.” As we see it, the statements required by\n\nthese two subsections effectively and harmoniously notify an applicant that their\n\nfailure to check either box on the declination form will be considered a decision\n\nnot to register to vote at that time, and thus not to seek help from the agency in\n\ncompleting the voter registration form.\n\n      We thus conclude, in sum, that when the provisions of § 1973gg-5(a)(6) are\n\nconsidered together, the most reasonable interpretation is the one urged by\n\n                                          23\n\fplaintiff Allers and adopted by the district court. 2 If an applicant is passive, i.e.,\n\ndoes not check either the “YES” or “NO” box on the declination form and thereby\n\nindicate his or her intent in writing, HSD must, in accordance with the mandate of\n\nsubsection (A), still provide him or her with a voter registration form, but is\n\nrelieved from providing the applicant with assistance in completing that form. 3\n\nOn the other hand, if an applicant checks the “NO” box on the information form,\n\nhe or she would be deemed to have declined, in writing, the opportunity to receive\n\na voter registration form, and HSD would thus be relieved, under the language of\n\nsubsection (A), from providing the applicant with a voter registration form.\n\n      c) Estoppel\n\n      Defendants argue, in the alternative, that the district court’s entry of partial\n\nsummary judgment in favor of plaintiff Allers should be reversed “on the grounds\n\nthat [plaintiff’s] counsel can no longer maintain the position that HSD’s policy is\n\noutside the bounds of the NVRA.” Aplt. Br. at 8. More specifically, defendants\n\nargue that, “[i]n order to protect judicial integrity, [plaintiff’s] counsel should be\n\nestopped from continuing to argue before this Court that the policy at issue is\n\n      2\n        We note that the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of\nJustice filed an amicus brief agreeing with plaintiffs’ interpretation.\n      3\n        Subsection (C), as noted, requires a designated voter registration agency\nto “provide to each applicant who does not decline to register” assistance in\ncompleting the voter registration form. The parenthetical language in subsection\n(B) must therefore be interpreted to mean that, when an applicant fails to check\neither box on the information form, the agency is relieved of its obligation to\nprovide assistance to that applicant in completing a voter registration form.\n\n                                           24\n\fillegal, when they have submitted the same policy to another federal court [in\n\nIndiana] for approval on the grounds that the policy is fair, reasonable, and\n\nadequate.” Id.\n\n      We reject defendants’ arguments. Generally speaking, the doctrine of\n\njudicial estoppel “applies when, among other things, a party has succeeded in\n\npersuading a court to accept that party’s earlier position, so that judicial\n\nacceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the\n\nperception that either the first or the second court was misled.” Reed Elsevier,\n\nInc. v. Muchnick, 130 S. Ct. 1237, 1249 (2010) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). Thus, “one of the elements of this doctrine is that the party against\n\nwhom estoppel is asserted must have prevailed on the basis of his contradictory\n\nposition in the prior proceeding.” Webb v. ABF Freight Sys., Inc., 155 F.3d\n\n1230, 1242 n.16 (10th Cir. 1998). Here, however, it is uncontroverted that\n\nplaintiff Allers was not a party to the Indiana case cited by defendants, and thus\n\ntook no position in that case. Consequently, the doctrine simply does not apply in\n\nthis case. To be sure, Allers’ counsel in the instant case represented the plaintiff\n\nin the Indiana case, i.e., the Indiana State Conference of the NAACP. But, under\n\ncontrolling precedent, that fact simply has no relevance in determining whether\n\nthe doctrine of judicial estoppel applies in this case. Judicial estoppel does not\n\nbind counsel, when representing a variety of parties, to always take the same\n\nposition on a question.\n\n                                          25\n\f      Finally, it is not entirely clear that the position taken by the plaintiffs and\n\ntheir counsel in the Indiana case is inconsistent with the position taken by Allers\n\nin this case. Under the terms of the settlement agreement in the Indiana case,\n\nemployees of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration are required,\n\nwhen dealing with an applicant for services, to first offer the applicant a voter\n\nregistration application and offer assistance to the client in completing that\n\napplication. If the applicant does not want to register to vote, the employee then\n\nasks the applicant to complete a “notice/declination” form. Aplt. Br., Attachment\n\nE at 5. If the applicant declines to complete the notice/declination form, the\n\nemployee notes on the form that the client declined to complete the form. Thus,\n\narguably, the requirement of a declination “in writing” is always satisfied under\n\nthese standards: either the applicant directly completes the notice/declination\n\nform, or the employee, having spoken with the applicant, effectively acts on his\n\nor her behalf to complete the form.\n\n                                 Appeal No. 11-2084\n\n      In Appeal No. 11-2084, the Secretary of State appeals from the district\n\ncourt’s order granting plaintiffs’ application for fees and expenses arising out of\n\nthe litigation of their NVRA Section 5 claim. Generally speaking, “we review de\n\nnovo the legal analysis providing the basis for the award . . . of attorney fees,”\n\nand “review for abuse of discretion the amount of a fee or cost award.” ClearOne\n\nCommc’ns, Inc. v. Bowers, 643 F.3d 735, 777 (10th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation\n\n                                          26\n\fmarks omitted). To the extent the issues raised on appeal by the Secretary\n\nimplicate the construction of the parties’ settlement agreement, we must apply\n\nstate contract law in resolving those issues. Shoels v. Klebold, 375 F.3d 1054,\n\n1060 (10th Cir. 2004).\n\n      a) Plaintiffs’ failure to segregate fees on a defendant-by-defendant basis\n\n      The Secretary of State first argues that, “because [plaintiffs] did not\n\nsegregate or seek fees on a defendant-by-defendant basis but instead chose to\n\nsegregate and seek fees on a claim-by-claim basis, [plaintiffs resolved] their\n\nSection 5 fee claim in its entirety by accepting $200,000 from TRD in payment of\n\nthose fees.” Aplt. Br. at 5. We agree with district court, however, that this\n\nargument is incorrect.\n\n      It is undisputed that plaintiffs, the Secretary of State, TRD, and MVD\n\nentered into a written settlement agreement resolving plaintiffs’ Section 5 claims.\n\nUnder the terms of that settlement agreement, the parties agreed that plaintiffs\n\nwere entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses from\n\nall of the defendants. TRD and MVD subsequently agreed with plaintiffs to\n\nresolve their liability under the settlement agreement by paying plaintiffs.\n\nBecause the Secretary of State had no involvement in the resolution between\n\nplaintiffs and TRD/MVD, the only arguable way that she could benefit from it\n\nwould have been if the amount paid by TRD/MVD to plaintiffs was essentially\n\nequal to the total reasonable fees and expenses plaintiffs incurred in litigating\n\n                                          27\n\ftheir Section 5 claim. But the record on appeal firmly establishes that this was\n\nnot the case. As the district court noted, “[p]laintiffs’ [fee] calculations resulted\n\nin a lodestar for the Section 5 claims of $256,054.25 at the New Mexico rate[s]\n\n($564,542.10 at their customary rates), with litigation expenses of $32,615.24.”\n\nAplt. App. at 384. Thus, it was reasonable for the district court to hold the\n\nSecretary of State responsible for the difference between the lodestar amount\n\nclaimed by plaintiffs and the amount paid to plaintiffs by TRD/MVD. 4\n\n      As for the Secretary of State’s complaint that plaintiffs failed to segregate\n\ntheir fee request by defendant, rather than by claim, the district court aptly noted\n\nthat, “[h]ad the [Secretary of State] intended to limit her liability for fees to those\n\nhours worked directly with respect to her counsel, she could have attempted to\n\nnegotiate such a provision in the Settlement Agreement.” Id. at 386-87. Because\n\nshe failed to do so, the settlement agreement cannot reasonably be interpreted as\n\nrequiring plaintiffs to segregate their fee request by defendant.\n\n      b) Inadequate lodestar justification for award\n\n      In her second issue on appeal, the Secretary of State argues that, “because\n\n[plaintiffs] did not segregate their fees on a defendant-by-defendant basis,\n\n\n\n      4\n        Although the Secretary of State raises concerns about what would have\nhappened had TRD/MVD paid plaintiffs a much lower figure, leaving her to pay\nthe bulk of plaintiffs’ fees and expenses, that is a hypothetical situation that is not\nbefore us. Under the actual facts presented in this case, the Secretary of State\nbenefitted substantially from the payment made by TRD/MVD.\n\n                                          28\n\f[plaintiffs] failed to provide an adequate lodestar justification for the $41,174.38\n\nthey sought from [the Secretary].” Aplt. Br. at 5. As discussed above, however,\n\nnothing in the parties’ settlement agreement required plaintiffs to segregate their\n\nfees on this basis. The district court concluded, and the Secretary of State does\n\nnot dispute, that “[t]he absence of [such] a fee partition within the Settlement\n\nAgreement [wa]s reasonable[] because Plaintiffs’ Section 5 claim involve[d] a\n\ncommon core of facts that required Plaintiffs to obtain information from, and\n\nassess the conduct of, several Defendants, each of whom bore some responsibility\n\nfor the alleged violations.” Aplt. App. at 387. Moreover, the district court noted\n\nthat the Secretary of State “d[id] not appear to challenge the reasonableness of the\n\nnumber of hours Plaintiffs’ counsel worked to litigate and settle the Section 5\n\nclaim,” and the Secretary of State does not dispute this point on appeal.\n\nRelatedly, the district court expressly found that plaintiffs utilized “a valid\n\nmethod of allocating hours among claims, and . . . ha[d] substantiated such hours\n\nthrough clear documentation.” Id. Thus, in short, the Secretary of State’s\n\n“inadequate lodestar justification” argument is not justified by the terms of the\n\nparties’ settlement agreement, nor does it find any factual support in the record on\n\nappeal.\n\n      c) Whether plaintiffs were a “prevailing party”\n\n      In her third issue on appeal, the Secretary of State argues that “the District\n\nCourt erred in determining that [plaintiffs] were a ‘prevailing party’ for attorneys’\n\n                                          29\n\ffees purposes because the settlement agreement [wa]s not sufficiently similar to a\n\nconsent decree.” Aplt. Br. at 6. Citing Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit case\n\nlaw, the Secretary of State argues that a settlement does not confer prevailing\n\nparty status on a plaintiff unless the district court overseeing the case (1)\n\nincorporates the settlement into an order, (2) signs or otherwise provides written\n\napproval of the settlement’s terms, or (3) retains jurisdiction to enforce\n\nperformance of the obligations assumed by the parties. In turn, the Secretary of\n\nState argues that because none of those factors were present in this case, the\n\nplaintiffs cannot be considered prevailing parties and thus were not entitled to an\n\naward of fees and expenses.\n\n      We reject the Secretary of State’s arguments. At no time did the district\n\ncourt deem plaintiffs “prevailing parties” in this litigation. Indeed, the district\n\ncourt concluded it was unnecessary for plaintiffs to establish their status as\n\nprevailing parties because the Secretary and the other two defendants had\n\nexpressly agreed, under the terms of the written settlement agreement, to pay\n\nplaintiffs their reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses associated with litigating\n\ntheir Section 5 claims. In light of the Secretary of State’s agreement in this\n\nregard, which amounted to a private contractual matter, there was no need for\n\nplaintiffs to satisfy the typical requirements for obtaining fees and expenses.\n\nNotably, the Secretary of State has failed to cite to a single case holding\n\notherwise.\n\n                                          30\n\f      d) Fees for preparation of fee application\n\n      In her fourth and final issue on appeal, the Secretary of State contends that\n\n“the District Court erred by awarding $23,115 in connection with [plaintiffs’]\n\npreparation of their fee [application].” Aplt. Br. at 6. “Not only [wa]s that\n\namount a disproportionate percentage of the total fee award,” the Secretary of\n\nState argues, “but it [wa]s unjustifiable in light of the fact that [plaintiffs] did not\n\nsubmit a fee petition reasonably confined to work performed against [the\n\nSecretary of State].” Id.\n\n      In opposing the plaintiffs’ fee application in the district court, the Secretary\n\nof State argued that plaintiffs were not entitled to any fees in connection with the\n\npreparation of their fee application. But the Secretary of State’s basis for this\n\nargument was that plaintiffs had otherwise failed to establish their entitlement to\n\nfees in connection with their Section 5 claims. The Secretary of State did not\n\nargue, as she does now, that the fees associated with the application were “a\n\ndisproportionate percentage of the total fee award.” Thus, the district court did\n\nnot address this argument.\n\n      The general rule in this circuit is that, “[a]bsent extraordinary\n\ncircumstances, we will not consider arguments raised for the first time on\n\nappeal.” Koch v. City of Del City, 660 F.3d 1228, 1237 n.4 (10th Cir. 2011)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Because the Secretary of State “points us to\n\nno extraordinary circumstances warranting consideration of this newly asserted\n\n                                           31\n\fclaim on appeal,” it is unnecessary for us to consider it.\n\n                                         III.\n\n      In Appeal No. 11-2063, we AFFIRM the district court’s grant of partial\n\nsummary judgment in favor of plaintiff Allers. In Appeal No. 11-2084, we\n\nAFFIRM the district court’s grant of plaintiffs’ application for fees and expenses\n\nfrom the New Mexico Secretary of State.\n\n\n\n\n                                          32\n\f",

The Section\n\n7 claim was resolved on summary judgment, with the district court concluding\n\nthat the defendant officials responsible for overseeing New Mexico’s Human\n\nServices Department (HSD) violated the NVRA by failing to provide voter\n\nregistration forms to those applicants for public assistance who left the Section 7-\n\nmandated declination form blank. The Section 5 claim, which alleged that New\n\nMexico’s motor vehicle authority offices failed to provide necessary voter\n\nregistration services, was resolved by written settlement agreement. Although\n\ntwo of the settling agencies reimbursed plaintiffs for a portion of the attorneys’\n\nfees and expenses plaintiffs incurred in litigating the Section 5 claim, the New\n\nMexico Secretary of State refused to contribute. Plaintiffs subsequently sought\n\nand were granted attorneys’ fees and expenses related to the Section 5 claim\n\nagainst the Secretary of State.\n\n      In Appeal No. 11-2063, defendants appeal from the district court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment on the Section 7 claim. In Appeal No. 11-2084, the Secretary\n\nof State appeals from the district court’s order granting plaintiffs’ application for\n\nattorneys’ fees and expenses arising out of the Section 5 claim. Exercising\n\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we affirm the district court in all\n\nregards.\n\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f                                   I. Background\n\n                                 Appeal No. 11-2063\n\n      Generally speaking, Section 7 of the NVRA requires state public assistance\n\noffices to be designated as voter registration agencies and, in turn, to distribute\n\nwith each application for public assistance a mail voter registration application\n\nform, unless the applicant, in writing, declines to register to vote.\n\n      It is undisputed that HSD qualifies as a state public assistance office under\n\nthe NVRA. More specifically, HSD administers public assistance programs in\n\nNew Mexico, including the Food Stamp Program, Temporary Assistance to Needy\n\nFamilies, and Medicaid. In accordance with the NVRA, the State of New Mexico\n\n“has designated HSD as a voter registration agency pursuant to the NVRA.” Aplt.\n\nApp. at 152.\n\n      HSD does not attach voter registration applications “to applications for\n\npublic assistance, recertification or renewal applications, or change of address\n\nforms.” Id. Nor does HSD automatically distribute voter registration applications\n\nto all applicants for HSD-related benefits. “Instead, HSD includes, as part of\n\nmost of its benefit application forms, a section that it refers to as a ‘declination\n\nprovision.’” Id. The declination provision, which is typically included as a\n\nseparately designated section in the middle of a multi-page benefits application\n\nform, provides as follows:\n\n      If YOU are NOT registered to vote where you live now, would\n\n                                           5\n\f      you like to register to vote here today? (Please check one) G YES\n      G NO\n\n      IF YOU DO NOT CHECK EITHER BOX, YOU WILL BE\n      CONSIDERED TO HAVE DECIDED NOT TO REGISTER TO\n      VOTE AT THIS TIME.\n\n      The NATIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION ACT provides you\n      with the opportunity to register to vote at this location. If you would\n      like help in filling out a voter registration application form, we will\n      help you. The decision whether to seek or accept help is yours. You\n      may fill out the application form in private. IMPORTANT:\n      Applying to register or declining to register to vote WILL NOT\n      AFFECT the amount of assistance that you will be provided by\n      this agency.\n\n      Signature                                           Date\n\n      CONFIDENTIALITY: Whether you decide to register to vote or\n      not, your decision will remain confidential. IF YOU BELIEVE\n      THAT SOMEONE HAS INTERFERED with your right to\n      register or to decline to register to vote, or your right to privacy\n      in deciding whether to register or in applying to register to vote,\n      or your right to choose your own political party or other political\n      preference, you may file a complaint with the Office of the\n      Secretary of State, 419 State Capital, Santa Fe, NM, 87503,\n      (phone: 1-800-477-3632.)\n\nId. at 153 (emphasis in original).\n\n      Prior to this lawsuit, HSD’s policy, which it believed was compliant with\n\nSection 7 of the NVRA, was to provide a benefits applicant with a voter\n\nregistration application form only if he or she checked “YES” on the declination\n\nprovision or verbally indicated that he or she would like to register to vote. As a\n\nresult, HSD did not provide voter registration application forms to benefits\n\napplicants who left the declination provision blank and who did not otherwise\n\n                                         6\n\frespond “yes” if a verbal inquiry regarding voter registration was made by an\n\nHSD employee.\n\n      On July 9, 2009, four New Mexico residents — including Roanna Begay —\n\nand the nonprofit organization Association of Community Organizations for\n\nReform Now (ACORN) initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint against six\n\nNew Mexico state officials, four of whom were responsible for overseeing HSD\n\n(the remaining two officials were associated with New Mexico’s Taxation and\n\nRevenue Department and its associated Motor Vehicle Division and are not part\n\nof Appeal No. 11-2063). The complaint, in pertinent part, sought declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief to redress ongoing violations of HSD’s obligations under Section\n\n7 of the NVRA.\n\n      Through subsequent pleadings, Shawna Allers became the sole plaintiff\n\nasserting the Section 7 claim. Plaintiffs were granted leave to file a first amended\n\ncomplaint substituting Allers for Roanna Begay as the individual plaintiff to bring\n\nthe NVRA Section 7 against HSD. Then, the district court granted the parties’\n\nstipulated motion to dismiss ACORN from the case. The parties noted in their\n\nstipulation that “ACORN ha[d] closed its offices in New Mexico and no longer\n\nplan[ned] to provide voter registration assistance in the state,” and thus was “not\n\nan appropriate Plaintiff in th[e] case.” Id. at 28.\n\n      Allers moved for partial summary judgment against defendants on her\n\nclaims that HSD had violated Section 7 of the NVRA. In that motion, Allers\n\n                                           7\n\fasserted that “HSD’s . . . policy regarding the distribution of voter registration\n\napplications [wa]s deficient because it fail[ed] to require HSD employees to\n\ndistribute a voter registration application to all persons who appear[ed] at HSD\n\noffices to apply for public assistance benefits, recertify or renew their benefits, or\n\nsubmit a change of address, who d[id] not check either ‘yes’ or the ‘no’ box on\n\nHSD’s voter information (‘declination’) form.” Id. at 33.\n\n      The district court subsequently granted Allers’ motion for partial summary\n\njudgment. The district court concluded that “Section 7 [of the NVRA] requires\n\nthat [HSD’s] clients be provided with a mail voter registration form unless they\n\naffirmatively decline, in writing.” Id. at 161. In turn, the district court concluded\n\nthat “HSD’s . . . declination form and policy d[id] not meet this requirement.” Id.\n\n      Following the grant of partial summary judgment, Allers and defendants\n\nfiled a joint motion asking the district court to sign and enter their proposed\n\nconsent order. The proposed consent order “establish[ed] specific procedures that\n\nHSD w[ould] follow for distributing voter registration applications, and for\n\nproviding assistance to clients in completing these forms.” Id. “The proposed\n\norder also require[d] that HSD employees who interact with public assistance\n\nclients receive voter registration training, that HSD and the Secretary of State\n\ncollect and maintain voter registration data to track their implementation of the\n\norder, and that HSD and the Secretary of State undertake a variety of measures to\n\nmonitor compliance with the terms of the order.” Id. In addition, the proposed\n\n                                           8\n\fconsent order preserved defendants’ right to appeal the district court’s grant of\n\nAllers’ motion for partial summary judgment.\n\n         The district court granted the joint motion and entered the proposed consent\n\norder. The defendants have filed a timely notice of appeal from the consent\n\norder.\n\n                                  Appeal No. 11-2084\n\n         The other three individual plaintiffs in the case — Cecilia Valdez, Graciela\n\nGrajeda, and Jessie Rodriguez — asserted claims under Section 5 of the NVRA\n\nagainst the officials responsible for overseeing New Mexico’s Taxation and\n\nRevenue Department (TRD) and its associated Motor Vehicle Division (MVD).\n\nSection 5 of the NVRA provides, in pertinent part, that “[e]ach State motor\n\nvehicle driver’s license application . . . submitted to the appropriate State motor\n\nvehicle authority under State law shall serve as an application for voter\n\nregistration with respect to elections for Federal office . . . .” 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1973gg-3(a)(1). The complaint in this case alleged that, “[d]espite the clear\n\nobligations under Section 5 of the NVRA, New Mexico’s motor vehicle authority\n\noffices routinely fail[ed] to provide any voter registration services at all, much\n\nless the integrated application process required by law.” Aplt. App. at 3.\n\n         On July 1, 2010, the parties entered into a written settlement agreement\n\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\fresolving the Section 5 claims. 1 The settlement agreement required the Office of\n\nthe Secretary of State, TRD, and local TRD and MVD offices to implement\n\ncertain staffing structures, including the Secretary of State’s designation of a new\n\nstaff position called the “State NVRA Coordinator.” Id. at 80. The settlement\n\nagreement also contained a section entitled “ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND\n\nEXPENSES” that provided as follows:\n\n       Plaintiffs shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and\n       litigation expenses. The parties shall confer in good faith to resolve\n       the amount and payment of attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses.\n       If the parties are unable to reach agreement with respect to attorneys’\n       fees for Plaintiffs’ TRD claim within thirty days of the execution of\n       this Agreement, the Plaintiffs shall submit their attorneys’ fee\n       application for that claim to Judge Herrera no later than forty-five\n       days after execution of this Agreement.\n\nId. at 90.\n\n       The plaintiffs subsequently resolved their claims for attorneys’ fees and\n\nlitigation expenses against TRD and MVD for a total of $200,000. The Secretary\n\nof State, however, refused to pay any portion of the requested fees and expenses.\n\nConsequently, plaintiffs filed with the district court an application for attorneys’\n\nfees and expenses from the Secretary of State. The application sought to recover\n\n$67,585.66 comprised of “the following: 1) the balance of the attorneys’ fee\n\n\n       1\n         The parties to the settlement agreement included the three individual\nplaintiffs and defendants Mary Herrera, the New Mexico Secretary of State, Rick\nHomans, the Secretary of TRD, and Michael Sandoval, the Director of MVD.\nNew Mexico’s current Secretary of State, Dianna Duran, was substituted as the\nnamed party after the settlement agreement was entered into.\n\n                                         10\n\flodestar regarding the Section 5 claim; 2) the time expended preparing the . . .\n\napplication; and 3) a pro rata share of travel time at 50 percent of the hourly\n\nrates.” Id. at 97. The application noted that “[t]he lodestar fees claimed” against\n\nthe Secretary of State “simply represent[ed] the difference between the total\n\nSection 5 lodestar and the TRD/MVD settlement.” Id. The application further\n\nnoted that although “the TRD/MVD settlement covered not only lodestar hours\n\nbut also expenses related to the Section 5 claim,” plaintiffs “ha[d] elected to treat\n\nthe entire $200,000 TRD/MVD settlement amount as applying toward the\n\nlodestar, [thereby] directly reducing the lodestar amount claimed against the\n\nSecretary of State.” Id. at 98 n.5. According to the application and supporting\n\ndocuments, the fees and expenses incurred in preparing the application totaled\n\n$23,115.\n\n      The Secretary of State opposed the application, arguing that plaintiffs\n\n“ha[d] already [resolved] their fee request on th[e] [Section 5] claim and c[ould\n\nnot] meet the ‘prevailing party’ threshold necessary for such an award” against\n\nthe Secretary of State. Id. at 329. More specifically, the Secretary of State\n\nargued that plaintiffs, “by segregating their fees by claim and not by defendant,”\n\nand by accepting payment from TRD/MVD, “ha[d] settled their attorneys’ fees\n\nclaim for all of their Section 5 work.” Id. at 330. “Any other outcome,” the\n\nSecretary of State argued, “beg[ged] absurd results because it untether[ed] the fee\n\nrequest from its bedrock basis - the lodestar.” Id. at 332. Alternatively, the\n\n                                          11\n\fSecretary of State argued that plaintiffs were not prevailing parties because\n\n“[p]laintiffs and the [Secretary of State] st[oo]d in precisely the same legal\n\nrelationship to one another after entry of the settlement as before.” Id. at 335.\n\nMoreover, the Secretary of State argued, she had done nothing to violate the\n\nNVRA. Id. at 335-36. Lastly, the Secretary of State argued that plaintiffs’\n\napplication failed to substantiate, through a lodestar calculation, the amount they\n\nhad requested. Id. at 336.\n\n      In their reply brief, plaintiffs asserted that the Secretary of State and the\n\nother two defendants had, under the terms of the settlement agreement, “agreed to\n\npay Plaintiffs’ reasonable attorneys’ fees.” Id. at 350. Plaintiffs in turn argued\n\nthat, because the amount paid by TRD/MVD was “less than the lodestar amount\n\nowed to Plaintiffs,” the Secretary of State “[wa]s liable to Plaintiffs for the\n\nunpaid amount.” Id. As for the Secretary of State’s assertion that plaintiffs had\n\nfailed to establish that they were prevailing parties or that the Secretary of State\n\nhad violated the NVRA, the plaintiffs noted that the Secretary of State had, under\n\nthe terms of the settlement agreement, agreed that she was liable for fees and\n\nexpenses, and that plaintiffs were thus relieved from having to establish anything\n\nfurther. Finally, plaintiffs argued, they “already ha[d] fully substantiated their\n\nlodestar calculation of the amount requested for attorneys’ fees, both in their\n\ninitial” application and the supporting exhibits thereto. Id. at 350-51.\n\n      The district court granted plaintiffs’ application for attorneys’ fees and\n\n                                          12\n\fexpenses. In doing so, the district court noted that “[p]laintiffs’ attorneys\n\nexpended a total of 910 hours litigating the Section 5 claim, not including travel\n\ntime,” all of which were “documented in declarations and meticulous, highly-\n\ndetailed time records attached to their fee application.” Id. at 380. The district\n\ncourt further noted that although plaintiffs’ attorneys “almost exclusively\n\npractic[ed] out of state,” they sought “fees based on local rates rather than their\n\nusual, much higher, customary rates.” Id. The total lodestar calculation\n\nassociated with the Section 5 claim, the district court noted, was $241,147.38, and\n\n“[t]he $41,174.38 that Plaintiffs s[ought] from the [Secretary of State]\n\nrepresent[ed] the difference between the total Section 5 lodestar and the\n\nTRD/MVD settlement.” Id. at 381. Indeed, the court noted, plaintiffs’\n\n“methodology appear[ed] to result in a lower amount claimed against the\n\n[Secretary of State] than could validly be claimed” because the amount paid by\n\nTRD/MVD “covered not only lodestar hours, but also expenses, but Plaintiffs\n\nha[d] elected to treat the entire $200,000 . . . amount as applying toward the\n\nlodestar amount, which directly reduce[d] the lodestar amount claimed against the\n\n[Secretary of State].” Id. n.4. As for the amount sought by plaintiffs for\n\npreparing the fee application, the district court concluded it was “not excessive,”\n\n“given the complexity of the litigation involved, the number of attorneys from\n\nmany different firms working together on the issues, and the thoroughness of the\n\npackage that Plaintiffs submitted.” Id.\n\n                                          13\n\f      The district court rejected each of the arguments urged by the Secretary of\n\nState in opposition to plaintiffs’ application. To begin with, the district court\n\ncharacterized as “incorrect” the Secretary of State’s assertion that plaintiffs,\n\naccepting payment from TRD/MVD, “gave up their rights to any further\n\nremuneration from the” Secretary of State. Id. at 382. Instead, the district court\n\nconcluded, TRD/MVD’s payment “only terminated TRD/MVD’s obligations to\n\npay attorneys’ fees and costs,” and left the Secretary of State’s obligation intact.\n\nId. at 383. Moreover, the district court concluded, “Plaintiffs were not made\n\nwhole on their fee request when they accepted TRD/MVD’s offer.” Id. (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted). The district court also concluded that “the\n\namount sought by Plaintiffs [from the Secretary of State] [wa]s eminently\n\nreasonable,” and far less than “the full lodestar amount that they ha[d]\n\ndocumented ($256,054.25) as well as documented litigation expenses\n\n($32,615.24), reduced by the $200,000 payment from TRD/MVD.” Id. at 384. In\n\nother words, the district court concluded, plaintiffs would have been justified in\n\nseeking from the Secretary of State an award “of $88,669.49, rather than the\n\n$41,174.38 that they s[ought].” Id.\n\n      The district court in turn rejected the Secretary of State’s assertions that\n\nplaintiffs were not a “prevailing party” under the NVRA because they did not\n\nobtain an enforceable judgment on the merits, and that the settlement agreement\n\ncould not confer prevailing party status on plaintiffs because it was not subject to\n\n                                          14\n\fjudicial approval. In doing so, the district court noted that the settlement\n\nagreement “specifically provide[d] that all Defendants [we]re liable to Plaintiffs\n\nfor ‘reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses.’” Id. at 385. “This\n\nagreement,” the district court noted, “d[id] not rely on a finding that Plaintiffs\n\n[we]re a ‘prevailing party’ for NVRA purposes to create liability for attorneys’\n\nfees and litigation costs; such liability [wa]s [instead] established on the face of\n\nthe Settlement Agreement.” Id. The district court further noted that, under Tenth\n\nCircuit precedent, “a court’s decision on the merits [wa]s not required for a\n\nplaintiff to recover fees and costs as a prevailing party,” and that in this case,\n\n“Plaintiffs’ suit resulted in significant changes in how New Mexico\n\nimplement[ed] Section 5 of the NVRA, and [plaintiffs thus] would rightfully be\n\nconsidered a prevailing party.” Id. Relatedly, the district court rejected the\n\nSecretary of State’s assertion that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that she\n\nviolated the NVRA in any way. The district court noted that it “ha[d] explicitly\n\nrejected the [Secretary of State’s] argument that, as the ‘chief election official’\n\nfor New Mexico, she d[id] not bear any responsibility for the state’s failure to\n\ncomply with the NVRA,” and that, in any event, the settlement agreement did not\n\n“condition her liability [for fees and costs] on any offer of proof by Plaintiffs that\n\nshe violated the NVRA.” Id. at 386.\n\n      Lastly, the district court rejected the Secretary of State’s assertion that the\n\namount sought against her from plaintiffs was unjustified. The district court\n\n                                           15\n\femphasized that the settlement agreement “d[id] not subdivide or partition\n\nPlaintiffs’ Section 5 claim, nor d[id] it subdivide the work performed in litigating\n\nand settling the claim for purposes of allocating fees,” and instead “expressly\n\nprovide[d] that both the [Secretary] and the TRD/MVD Defendants [we]re\n\nresponsible for paying reasonable attorneys’ fees to Plaintiffs.” Id. at 386. “Had\n\nthe [Secretary of State] intended to limit her liability for fees to those hours\n\nworked directly with respect to her counsel,” the district court concluded, “she\n\ncould have attempted to negotiate such a provision in the Settlement Agreement.”\n\nId. at 386-87. In any event, the district court concluded, “[t]he absence of a fee\n\npartition within the Settlement Agreement [wa]s reasonable, because Plaintiffs’\n\nSection 5 claim involve[d] a common core of facts that required Plaintiffs to\n\nobtain information from, and assess the conduct of, several Defendants, each of\n\nwhom bore some responsibility for the alleged violations.” Id. at 387. And, the\n\ndistrict court concluded, even assuming, for purposes of argument, that “degree of\n\nsuccess [wa]s relevant, Plaintiffs ha[d] demonstrated significant success against\n\nthe [Secretary of State] as a result of their settlement.” Id.\n\n      The Secretary of State appealed from the district court’s order granting\n\nplaintiffs’ application for fees and expenses.\n\n                                     II. Analysis\n\n                                 Appeal No. 11-2063\n\n      In Appeal No. 11-2063, the HSD-related defendants challenge the district\n\n                                          16\n\fcourt’s grant of partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiff Allers on her\n\nclaims under Section 7 of the NVRA. According to defendants, the district court\n\nmisconstrued the provisions of Section 7. Alternatively, defendants assert that\n\nplaintiffs’ counsel should be estopped from taking a position before the district\n\ncourt in this case that is inconsistent with the position they took before a federal\n\ndistrict court in Indiana in a similar Section 7 case.\n\n      a) Standard of review\n\n      “We review summary judgment decisions de novo, applying the same legal\n\nstandard as the district court.” Tuckel v. Grover, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"616879\"><a href=\"/opinion/616879/tuckel-v-grover/\"><span class=\"volume\">660</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1249</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1251 (10th Cir.\n\n2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Summary judgment is appropriate\n\nwhen “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n      b) The district court’s construction of Section 7\n\n      Section 7 of the NVRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-5, is entitled “Voter\n\nregistration agencies.” As an initial matter, Section 7 generally requires “[e]ach\n\nState [to] designate agencies for the registration of voters in elections for Federal\n\noffice,” and in particular to “designate as voter registration agencies . . . all\n\noffices in the State that provide public assistance” or “State-funded programs\n\nprimarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities.” 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1973gg-5(a)(1) & (a)(2). Section 7 in turn requires each designated voter\n\nregistration agency to provide the following three services:\n\n                                           17\n\f      (i) Distribution of mail voter registration application forms . . . .\n      (ii) Assistance to applicants in completing voter registration\n      application forms, unless the applicant refuses such assistance.\n      (iii) Acceptance of completed voter registration application forms for\n      transmittal to the appropriate State election official.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-5(a)(4)(A).\n\n      If a designated voter registration agency “is an office that provides service\n\nor assistance in addition to conducting voter registration,” Section 7 outlines in\n\ndetail how that agency is to fulfill its three general duties. Specifically, Section 7\n\nrequires that agency to\n\n         (A) distribute with each application for such service or assistance,\n      and with each recertification, renewal, or change of address form\n      relating to such service or assistance—\n                (I) the mail voter registration application form described in\n             section 1973gg-7(a)(2) of this title . . . or\n                (ii) the office’s own form if it is equivalent to the form\n             described in section 19733gg-7(a)(2) of this title,\n      unless the applicant, in writing, declines to register to vote;\n\n         (B) provide a form that includes—\n               (I) the question, “If you are not registered to vote where\n            you live now, would you like to apply to register to vote here\n            today?”;\n               (ii) if the agency provides public assistance, the statement,\n            “Applying to register or declining to register to vote will not\n            affect the amount of assistance that you will be provided by\n            this agency.”;\n               (iii) boxes for the applicant to check to indicate whether the\n            applicant would like to register or declines to register to vote\n            (failure to check either box being deemed to constitute a\n            declination to register for purposes of subparagraph (C)),\n            together with the statement (in close proximity to the boxes\n            and in prominent type), “IF YOU DO NOT CHECK EITHER\n            BOX, YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE DECIDED\n            NOT TO REGISTER TO VOTE AT THIS TIME.”;\n\n                                          18\n\f                (iv) the statement, “If you would like help in filling out the\n             voter registration application form, we will help you. The\n             decision whether to seek or accept help is yours. You may fill\n             out the application in private.”; and\n                (v) the statement, “If you believe that someone has\n             interfered with your right to register or to decline to register to\n             vote, your right to privacy in deciding whether to register or in\n             applying to register to vote, or your right to choose your own\n             political party or other political preference, you may file a\n             complaint with __________.”, the blank being filled by the\n             name, address, and telephone number of the appropriate\n             official to whom such a complaint should be addressed; and\n\n         (C) provide to each applicant who does not decline to register to\n      vote the same degree of assistance with regard to the completion of\n      the registration application form as is provided by the office with\n      regard to the completion of its own forms, unless the applicant\n      refuses such assistance.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-5(a)(6).\n\n      In this case, it is undisputed that HSD provides public assistance, has been\n\ndesignated by the State of New Mexico as a voter registration agency under\n\nSection 7, and is therefore subject to the obligations outlined above. It is further\n\nundisputed that HSD, in attempting to comply with those obligations, has adopted\n\na policy and practice of providing voter registration forms only to those\n\napplicants who check the “YES” box on the declination form mandated by Section\n\n7 (§ 1973gg-5(a)(6)(B)) or orally request a voter registration form. In other\n\nwords, HSD has interpreted Section 7 as requiring an applicant to “opt in” to\n\nreceiving a voter registration form, and, consequently, HSD does not provide\n\nvoter registration forms to those applicants who check “NO” on the declination\n\n\n                                          19\n\fform or leave the declination form blank (i.e., do not check either the “YES” or\n\n“NO” box on the declination form). At issue in this appeal is whether HSD’s\n\npolicy and practice of not providing voter registration forms to applicants who\n\nleave the declination form blank violates HSD’s obligations under Section 7.\n\n      HSD’s policy and practice appears to be based largely, if not exclusively,\n\non the provisions of § 1973gg-5(a)(6)(B). Subsection (B), as noted above,\n\noutlines the information that must be included in the declination form given by\n\nHSD to its applicants for services and assistance. In pertinent part, it requires the\n\ndeclination form to include “boxes for the applicant to check to indicate whether\n\nthe applicant would like to register or declines to register to vote, . . . together\n\nwith the statement (in close proximity to the boxes and prominent type), ‘IF YOU\n\nDO NOT CHECK EITHER BOX, YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE\n\nDECIDED NOT TO REGISTER TO VOTE AT THIS TIME.’” 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1973gg-5(a)(6)(B)(iii). HSD argues that this capitalized written admonition to\n\napplicants means that if an applicant does not check either the “YES” or “NO”\n\nbox on the declination form, the applicant must be deemed to have decided not to\n\nvote, and in turn HSD is relieved of its obligation to provide that applicant with a\n\nvoter registration form.\n\n      HSD’s position is directly rebutted by the language of § 1973gg-5(a)(6)(A).\n\nSubsection (A), as noted, requires a designated voter registration agency to\n\nprovide an applicant with a voter registration form “unless the applicant, in\n\n                                           20\n\fwriting, declines to register to vote.” Although neither subsection (A) nor any\n\nother subsection of the statute expressly defines the key phrase “in writing,” it is\n\ncommonly defined to mean “[t]he state or condition of having been written or\n\npenned; written form.” Oxford English Dictionary, Online Edition, Sept. 2011,\n\nhttp://www.oed.com/view/Entry/230775?rskey=bbJo54&result=2&isAdvanced\n\n=false#eid14009491 (last visited January 25, 2012). Thus, subsection (A) must be\n\ninterpreted as requiring a designated voter registration agency to provide an\n\napplicant with a voter registration form unless the applicant declines, in written\n\nform, to register to vote. As applied to the facts presented in this case, subsection\n\n(A) thus requires HSD to provide a benefits applicant with a voter registration\n\nform unless that applicant specifically checks the “NO” box on the declination\n\nform provided by HSD. In other words, an applicant’s failure to check either the\n\n“YES” or “NO” box on the declination form does not constitute a declination “in\n\nwriting.” Thus, in sum, subsection (A) requires an applicant to affirmatively, by\n\nway of writing, “opt out” of receiving a voter registration form.\n\n      HSD argues, however, that the phrase “in writing,” as employed in\n\nsubsection (A), is “essentially define[d]” by subsection (B) to include either a\n\ncheck in the “NO” box on the declination form “or by leaving the [declination]\n\nform blank.” Aplt. Br. at 11. The problem with HSD’s argument is three-fold.\n\nFirst, HSD’s proposed interpretation of the phrase “in writing” is clearly at odds\n\nwith the ordinary meaning of that phrase, and there is no express indication by\n\n                                          21\n\fCongress that it intended for the phrase, as used in Section 7, “to carry a\n\nspecialized—and indeed, unusual—meaning.” See Hamilton v. Lanning, 130 S.\n\nCt. 2464, 2474 (2010). Consequently, there is no legitimate basis for us to adopt\n\nthe definition suggested by HSD. Second, HSD’s proposed interpretation of the\n\nphrase “in writing” renders superfluous the portion of the written admonition in\n\nsubsection (B) that states, “AT THIS TIME.” Although HSD’s position is that an\n\napplicant’s failure to check either the “YES” or “NO” box must be interpreted as\n\na decision by the applicant not to register to vote at all, the phrase “AT THIS\n\nTIME” means that the failure must instead be interpreted simply as a decision by\n\nthe applicant not to register to vote at that time, i.e., at the time they are present\n\nin one of HSD’s offices seeking services or assistance. As plaintiffs suggest, it\n\nis conceivable that an applicant who chooses not to register to vote “at that time”\n\nmight still be interested in receiving a mail voter registration form and completing\n\nit at another time and/or location. And third, Congress made clear, by way of the\n\nlanguage contained in the first parenthetical in subsection (B)(iii), that an\n\napplicant’s failure to check either box on the declination form must only be\n\n“deemed to constitute a declination to register for purposes of subparagraph (C),”\n\ni.e., it relieves the agency from its duty to provide the applicant with assistance in\n\ncompleting a voter registration form. Had Congress intended for an applicant’s\n\nfailure to check either box to also relieve the agency of its obligation under\n\nsubsection (A) to provide a voter registration form, it presumably would have said\n\n                                           22\n\fso.\n\n      At oral argument, HSD asserted for the first time that the interpretation\n\nadopted by the district court created tension between the provisions of subsections\n\n(B)(iii) and (B)(iv). From a jurisprudential standpoint, we are under no obligation\n\nto consider this argument. See, e.g., Corder v. Lewis Palmer Sch. Dist. No. 38,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1219</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1235 n.8 (10th Cir. 2011) (“An argument made for the first time at\n\noral argument . . . will not be considered.”). And, in any event, we find no merit\n\nto it. Subsection (B)(iii) requires the declination form to advise an applicant of\n\nthe effect of not checking either box on the form: they will be considered to have\n\ndecided not to register to vote at that time. Subsection (B)(iv), in turn, requires\n\nthe declination form to advise an applicant that if they “would like help in filling\n\nout the voter registration application form,” the agency “will help” them. It also\n\nrequires the declination form to advise the applicant that “[t]he decision whether\n\nto seek or accept help is [theirs],” and that they “may fill out the [voter\n\nregistration] application in private.” As we see it, the statements required by\n\nthese two subsections effectively and harmoniously notify an applicant that their\n\nfailure to check either box on the declination form will be considered a decision\n\nnot to register to vote at that time, and thus not to seek help from the agency in\n\ncompleting the voter registration form.\n\n      We thus conclude, in sum, that when the provisions of § 1973gg-5(a)(6) are\n\nconsidered together, the most reasonable interpretation is the one urged by\n\n                                          23\n\fplaintiff Allers and adopted by the district court. 2 If an applicant is passive, i.e.,\n\ndoes not check either the “YES” or “NO” box on the declination form and thereby\n\nindicate his or her intent in writing, HSD must, in accordance with the mandate of\n\nsubsection (A), still provide him or her with a voter registration form, but is\n\nrelieved from providing the applicant with assistance in completing that form. 3\n\nOn the other hand, if an applicant checks the “NO” box on the information form,\n\nhe or she would be deemed to have declined, in writing, the opportunity to receive\n\na voter registration form, and HSD would thus be relieved, under the language of\n\nsubsection (A), from providing the applicant with a voter registration form.\n\n      c) Estoppel\n\n      Defendants argue, in the alternative, that the district court’s entry of partial\n\nsummary judgment in favor of plaintiff Allers should be reversed “on the grounds\n\nthat [plaintiff’s] counsel can no longer maintain the position that HSD’s policy is\n\noutside the bounds of the NVRA.” Aplt. Br. at 8. More specifically, defendants\n\nargue that, “[i]n order to protect judicial integrity, [plaintiff’s] counsel should be\n\nestopped from continuing to argue before this Court that the policy at issue is\n\n      2\n        We note that the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of\nJustice filed an amicus brief agreeing with plaintiffs’ interpretation.\n      3\n        Subsection (C), as noted, requires a designated voter registration agency\nto “provide to each applicant who does not decline to register” assistance in\ncompleting the voter registration form. The parenthetical language in subsection\n(B) must therefore be interpreted to mean that, when an applicant fails to check\neither box on the information form, the agency is relieved of its obligation to\nprovide assistance to that applicant in completing a voter registration form.\n\n                                           24\n\fillegal, when they have submitted the same policy to another federal court [in\n\nIndiana] for approval on the grounds that the policy is fair, reasonable, and\n\nadequate.” Id.\n\n      We reject defendants’ arguments. Generally speaking, the doctrine of\n\njudicial estoppel “applies when, among other things, a party has succeeded in\n\npersuading a court to accept that party’s earlier position, so that judicial\n\nacceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the\n\nperception that either the first or the second court was misled.” Reed Elsevier,\n\nInc. v. Muchnick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1731\"><a href=\"/opinion/1731/reed-elsevier-inc-v-muchnick/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1249 (2010) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). Thus, “one of the elements of this doctrine is that the party against\n\nwhom estoppel is asserted must have prevailed on the basis of his contradictory\n\nposition in the prior proceeding.” Webb v. ABF Freight Sys., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757860\"><a href=\"/opinion/757860/rick-webb-v-abf-freight-system-inc-a-corporation-and-teamsters-local/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1242 n.16 (10th Cir. 1998). Here, however, it is uncontroverted that\n\nplaintiff Allers was not a party to the Indiana case cited by defendants, and thus\n\ntook no position in that case. Consequently, the doctrine simply does not apply in\n\nthis case. To be sure, Allers’ counsel in the instant case represented the plaintiff\n\nin the Indiana case, i.e., the Indiana State Conference of the NAACP. But, under\n\ncontrolling precedent, that fact simply has no relevance in determining whether\n\nthe doctrine of judicial estoppel applies in this case. Judicial estoppel does not\n\nbind counsel, when representing a variety of parties, to always take the same\n\nposition on a question.\n\n                                          25\n\f      Finally, it is not entirely clear that the position taken by the plaintiffs and\n\ntheir counsel in the Indiana case is inconsistent with the position taken by Allers\n\nin this case. Under the terms of the settlement agreement in the Indiana case,\n\nemployees of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration are required,\n\nwhen dealing with an applicant for services, to first offer the applicant a voter\n\nregistration application and offer assistance to the client in completing that\n\napplication. If the applicant does not want to register to vote, the employee then\n\nasks the applicant to complete a “notice/declination” form. Aplt. Br., Attachment\n\nE at 5. If the applicant declines to complete the notice/declination form, the\n\nemployee notes on the form that the client declined to complete the form. Thus,\n\narguably, the requirement of a declination “in writing” is always satisfied under\n\nthese standards: either the applicant directly completes the notice/declination\n\nform, or the employee, having spoken with the applicant, effectively acts on his\n\nor her behalf to complete the form.\n\n                                 Appeal No. 11-2084\n\n      In Appeal No. 11-2084, the Secretary of State appeals from the district\n\ncourt’s order granting plaintiffs’ application for fees and expenses arising out of\n\nthe litigation of their NVRA Section 5 claim. Generally speaking, “we review de\n\nnovo the legal analysis providing the basis for the award . . . of attorney fees,”\n\nand “review for abuse of discretion the amount of a fee or cost award.” ClearOne\n\nCommc’ns, Inc. v.

To the extent the issues raised on appeal by the Secretary\n\nimplicate the construction of the parties’ settlement agreement, we must apply\n\nstate contract law in resolving those issues. Shoels v. Klebold, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786970\"><a href=\"/opinion/786970/no-03-1295/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1060 (10th Cir. 2004).\n\n      a) Plaintiffs’ failure to segregate fees on a defendant-by-defendant basis\n\n      The Secretary of State first argues that, “because [plaintiffs] did not\n\nsegregate or seek fees on a defendant-by-defendant basis but instead chose to\n\nsegregate and seek fees on a claim-by-claim basis, [plaintiffs resolved] their\n\nSection 5 fee claim in its entirety by accepting $200,000 from TRD in payment of\n\nthose fees.” Aplt. Br. at 5. We agree with district court, however, that this\n\nargument is incorrect.\n\n      It is undisputed that plaintiffs, the Secretary of State, TRD, and MVD\n\nentered into a written settlement agreement resolving plaintiffs’ Section 5 claims.\n\nUnder the terms of that settlement agreement, the parties agreed that plaintiffs\n\nwere entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses from\n\nall of the defendants. TRD and MVD subsequently agreed with plaintiffs to\n\nresolve their liability under the settlement agreement by paying plaintiffs.\n\nBecause the Secretary of State had no involvement in the resolution between\n\nplaintiffs and TRD/MVD, the only arguable way that she could benefit from it\n\nwould have been if the amount paid by TRD/MVD to plaintiffs was essentially\n\nequal to the total reasonable fees and expenses plaintiffs incurred in litigating\n\n                                          27\n\ftheir Section 5 claim. But the record on appeal firmly establishes that this was\n\nnot the case. As the district court noted, “[p]laintiffs’ [fee] calculations resulted\n\nin a lodestar for the Section 5 claims of $256,054.25 at the New Mexico rate[s]\n\n($564,542.10 at their customary rates), with litigation expenses of $32,615.24.”\n\nAplt. App. at 384. Thus, it was reasonable for the district court to hold the\n\nSecretary of State responsible for the difference between the lodestar amount\n\nclaimed by plaintiffs and the amount paid to plaintiffs by TRD/MVD. 4\n\n      As for the Secretary of State’s complaint that plaintiffs failed to segregate\n\ntheir fee request by defendant, rather than by claim, the district court aptly noted\n\nthat, “[h]ad the [Secretary of State] intended to limit her liability for fees to those\n\nhours worked directly with respect to her counsel, she could have attempted to\n\nnegotiate such a provision in the Settlement Agreement.” Id. at 386-87. Because\n\nshe failed to do so, the settlement agreement cannot reasonably be interpreted as\n\nrequiring plaintiffs to segregate their fee request by defendant.\n\n      b) Inadequate lodestar justification for award\n\n      In her second issue on appeal, the Secretary of State argues that, “because\n\n[plaintiffs] did not segregate their fees on a defendant-by-defendant basis,\n\n\n\n      4\n        Although the Secretary of State raises concerns about what would have\nhappened had TRD/MVD paid plaintiffs a much lower figure, leaving her to pay\nthe bulk of plaintiffs’ fees and expenses, that is a hypothetical situation that is not\nbefore us. Under the actual facts presented in this case, the Secretary of State\nbenefitted substantially from the payment made by TRD/MVD.\n\n                                          28\n\f[plaintiffs] failed to provide an adequate lodestar justification for the $41,174.38\n\nthey sought from [the Secretary].” Aplt. Br. at 5. As discussed above, however,\n\nnothing in the parties’ settlement agreement required plaintiffs to segregate their\n\nfees on this basis. The district court concluded, and the Secretary of State does\n\nnot dispute, that “[t]he absence of [such] a fee partition within the Settlement\n\nAgreement [wa]s reasonable[] because Plaintiffs’ Section 5 claim involve[d] a\n\ncommon core of facts that required Plaintiffs to obtain information from, and\n\nassess the conduct of, several Defendants, each of whom bore some responsibility\n\nfor the alleged violations.” Aplt. App. at 387. Moreover, the district court noted\n\nthat the Secretary of State “d[id] not appear to challenge the reasonableness of the\n\nnumber of hours Plaintiffs’ counsel worked to litigate and settle the Section 5\n\nclaim,” and the Secretary of State does not dispute this point on appeal.\n\nRelatedly, the district court expressly found that plaintiffs utilized “a valid\n\nmethod of allocating hours among claims, and . . . ha[d] substantiated such hours\n\nthrough clear documentation.” Id. Thus, in short, the Secretary of State’s\n\n“inadequate lodestar justification” argument is not justified by the terms of the\n\nparties’ settlement agreement, nor does it find any factual support in the record on\n\nappeal.\n\n      c) Whether plaintiffs were a “prevailing party”\n\n      In her third issue on appeal, the Secretary of State argues that “the District\n\nCourt erred in determining that [plaintiffs] were a ‘prevailing party’ for attorneys’\n\n                                          29\n\ffees purposes because the settlement agreement [wa]s not sufficiently similar to a\n\nconsent decree.” Aplt. Br. at 6. Citing Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit case\n\nlaw, the Secretary of State argues that a settlement does not confer prevailing\n\nparty status on a plaintiff unless the district court overseeing the case (1)\n\nincorporates the settlement into an order, (2) signs or otherwise provides written\n\napproval of the settlement’s terms, or (3) retains jurisdiction to enforce\n\nperformance of the obligations assumed by the parties. In turn, the Secretary of\n\nState argues that because none of those factors were present in this case, the\n\nplaintiffs cannot be considered prevailing parties and thus were not entitled to an\n\naward of fees and expenses.\n\n      We reject the Secretary of State’s arguments. At no time did the district\n\ncourt deem plaintiffs “prevailing parties” in this litigation. Indeed, the district\n\ncourt concluded it was unnecessary for plaintiffs to establish their status as\n\nprevailing parties because the Secretary and the other two defendants had\n\nexpressly agreed, under the terms of the written settlement agreement, to pay\n\nplaintiffs their reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses associated with litigating\n\ntheir Section 5 claims. In light of the Secretary of State’s agreement in this\n\nregard, which amounted to a private contractual matter, there was no need for\n\nplaintiffs to satisfy the typical requirements for obtaining fees and expenses.\n\nNotably, the Secretary of State has failed to cite to a single case holding\n\notherwise.\n\n                                          30\n\f      d) Fees for preparation of fee application\n\n      In her fourth and final issue on appeal, the Secretary of State contends that\n\n“the District Court erred by awarding $23,115 in connection with [plaintiffs’]\n\npreparation of their fee [application].” Aplt. Br. at 6. “Not only [wa]s that\n\namount a disproportionate percentage of the total fee award,” the Secretary of\n\nState argues, “but it [wa]s unjustifiable in light of the fact that [plaintiffs] did not\n\nsubmit a fee petition reasonably confined to work performed against [the\n\nSecretary of State].” Id.\n\n      In opposing the plaintiffs’ fee application in the district court, the Secretary\n\nof State argued that plaintiffs were not entitled to any fees in connection with the\n\npreparation of their fee application. But the Secretary of State’s basis for this\n\nargument was that plaintiffs had otherwise failed to establish their entitlement to\n\nfees in connection with their Section 5 claims. The Secretary of State did not\n\nargue, as she does now, that the fees associated with the application were “a\n\ndisproportionate percentage of the total fee award.” Thus, the district court did\n\nnot address this argument.\n\n      The general rule in this circuit is that, “[a]bsent extraordinary\n\ncircumstances, we will not consider arguments raised for the first time on\n\nappeal.” Koch v. City of Del City, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"616534\"><a href=\"/opinion/616534/koch-v-city-of-del-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">660</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1237 n.4 (10th Cir. 2011)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Because the Secretary of State “points us to\n\nno extraordinary circumstances warranting consideration of this newly asserted\n\n                                           31\n\fclaim on appeal,” it is unnecessary for us to consider it.\n\n                                         III.\n\n      In Appeal No. 11-2063, we AFFIRM the district court’s grant of partial\n\nsummary judgment in favor of plaintiff Allers. In Appeal No. 11-2084, we\n\nAFFIRM the district court’s grant of plaintiffs’ application for fees and expenses\n\nfrom the New Mexico Secretary of State.\n\n\n\n\n                                          32\n\f</pre>",
