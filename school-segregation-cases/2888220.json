During the\n\n                                4\n\fcourse of the proceedings, plaintiff Michael Bowers met an\nuntimely death and his mother Kathleen Bowers has been\nsubstituted for him. As a matter of convenience, throughout this\nopinion the plaintiff-appellant will be referred to simply as\n“Bowers.” In this consolidated appeal, Bowers alleges the\nDistrict Court abused its discretion by entering preclusion\nsanctions against her based on its finding that she and her\nattorneys committed discovery violations in bad faith. She\nfurther argues the District Court erred when it granted the\nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment, which relied in\nlarge part on the preclusion sanctions imposed. Attorneys for\nBowers each appeal separately from the sanctions order with\nrespect to their reputations, arguing the District Court’s failure\nto provide them with notice and an opportunity to be heard on\nthe issue amounted to a violation of procedural due process.\nFinally, the University of Iowa cross appeals from orders\ndismissing its motions asserting Eleventh Amendment immunity\nto Bowers’ claims. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we\nwill reverse the District Court on its grant of summary\njudgment, and, in part, on its order of preclusion sanctions\nagainst Bowers and her attorneys, and find that the University\nof Iowa is an arm of the state for purposes of Eleventh\nAmendment immunity but that Congress validly abrogated\nsovereign immunity under Title II of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act.\n                      I. BACKGROUND\nA.     Factual History\n        This protracted dispute, spanning nearly a decade thus\nfar, has yielded eleven prior opinions, ten by the District Court\nand one by our own. See Bowers v. NCAA, 974 F. Supp. 459\n\n                                5\n\f(D.N.J. 1997) (“Bowers I”); Bowers v. NCAA, 9 F. Supp. 2d 460\n(D.N.J. 1998) (“Bowers II”); Bowers v. NCAA, 118 F.

NCAA, 171 F. Supp. 2d 389 (D.N.J. Nov. 7, 2001)\n(“Bowers VIII”), rev’d in part by Bowers v. NCAA, 346 F.3d 402\n(3d Cir. 2003); Bowers v. NCAA, 188 F. Supp. 2d 473 (D.N.J.\n2002) (“Bowers IX”), rev’d in part, remanded by Bowers, 346\nF.3d 402; Bowers v. NCAA, No. 97-2600 (D.N.J. filed\nMarch 21, 2005) (“Bowers X”) (dismissing the case). The\nunderlying facts and events giving rise to the claims in this case\nare thus well documented.\n        Michael Bowers was a talented high school athlete with\na learning disability. This learning disability was identified\nearly on in his schooling as a “perceptual impairment” affecting\nhis ability to achieve in spite of intellectual ability and\ninterfering with his reading and writing skills.1 Pursuant to the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 42 U.S.C.\n\n\n       1\n        Bowers’ IQ testing placed him in the above-average\nrange; however, his specific learning disability affected his\norganization and processing skills. These deficiencies meant\nBowers needed extra time to take tests, required help with study\nhabits and organizational skills, and performed better in small\ngroup settings. Of the 24 classes Bowers took in high school,\nonly three were in a regular academic setting.\n\n                                6\n\f§§ 1400 et seq., Bowers had an Individualized Education\nProgram (“IEP”) prepared for him by a team of state-certified\npsychologists and professional educators. Bowers’ IEP\nprovided for him to take the majority of his classes in a special\neducation setting, and allowed him to take untimed standardized\ntests.\n        Bowers’ difficulties in the classroom contrasted sharply\nwith his prowess on the gridiron. As a high school football\nplayer in Palmyra, New Jersey, Bowers was recognized locally\nand regionally for his athletic achievements.2 At some point\nbetween his junior and senior years, these achievements began\nto attract attention more widely from recruiters for prestigious\ncollege football programs around the country. Numerous\nschools, including the University of Iowa and Temple\nUniversity (“Temple”), the two university Defendants in this\ncase, contacted Bowers to explore the possibility of recruiting\nhim. Throughout the recruiting process, Bowers received\nhundreds of recruitment-related letters and phone calls and was\npersonally visited by numerous college recruiters. The\ninstitutions expressing an interest in Bowers were members of\nthe National Collegiate Athletic Association (“NCAA”), the\npremier governing body of intercollegiate athletics in the United\nStates.\n      The NCAA includes over 1,200 educational institutions\ngrouped into different divisions determining the “scope of the\n\n       2\n        Bowers lettered three years as a varsity football player,\nwas first team “All Freedom Team” (conference wide team), and\nwas first team “All South Jersey” and second team “All South\nJersey” his junior and senior seasons respectively.\n\n                               7\n\fathletic program, the level of competition, and the amount of\nfinancial aid distributable through its athletic program.” Bowers\nII, 9 F. Supp. 2d at 467. One of the NCAA’s primary functions\nwith respect to high school athletes is to determine whether an\nincoming college freshman will be academically eligible to\nparticipate in intercollegiate athletics. The NCAA has described\nthe academic eligibility requirements as “designed to assure\nproper emphasis on educational objectives, to promote\ncompetitive equity among institutions and to prevent\nexploitation of student athletes.” Bowers I, 974 F. Supp. at 466.\n        The eligibility determination depends on several factors,\nincluding whether the athlete graduated from high school, the\nathlete’s high school grade point average (“GPA”) in thirteen\nrequired “core courses,” and the athlete’s Scholastic Aptitude\nTest (“SAT”) scores. The NCAA’s definition of core courses\nspecifically excludes special education classes taught below the\nhigh school’s regular academic instruction level. (NCAA Bylaw\n14.3.1.3). NCAA bylaws do provide, however, that special\neducation courses for the learning disabled may satisfy the core\ncourse requirement if the student’s high school principal submits\na written statement to the NCAA indicating that students in such\nclasses are expected to acquire the same knowledge, both\nquantitatively and qualitatively, as students in other core\ncourses. (NCAA Bylaw 14.3.1.3.4). NCAA bylaws also\nprovide for a waiver of eligibility requirements if the applicant\nsubmits objective evidence that demonstrates “circumstances in\nwhich a student’s overall academic record warrants the waiver\nof the normal application of the requirements.” (NCAA Bylaw\n14.3.1.7). The NCAA contracts with ACT, Inc. to run the\nNCAA Initial-Eligibility Clearinghouse\n(“ACT/Clearinghouse”), which, as its name suggests,\n\n                               8\n\fdetermines whether potential student athletes are initially\neligible to participate in college sports pursuant to NCAA\nregulations. ACT/Clearinghouse reviews applications submitted\nby prospective athletes and places an athlete into one of three\ncategories: (a) qualifier, (b) partial qualifier, or (c) nonqualifier.\n        On September 13, 1995, Bowers submitted his\napplication to ACT/Clearinghouse and after a series of\ncorrespondences with Bowers’ high school throughout the\n1995-96 school year, ACT/Clearinghouse issued its final\ncertification report officially determining that Bowers was a\nnonqualifier for two primary reasons: (1) his special education\ncourses did not satisfy the NCAA’s core course requirement;\nand (2) he took an untimed SAT exam, and his application\nlacked documentation required to accept such untimed\nstandardized test scores. Bowers II, 9 F. Supp. 2d at 469.\nBowers alleges that this designation as a nonqualifier had\nextremely severe negative consequences.           He lost the\nopportunity to receive an athletic scholarship, and was\nprohibited from practicing with or competing for any Division\nI or II football team his freshman year.3 Even before Bowers\nwas designated as a nonqualifier, Bowers alleges that\nDefendants University of Iowa and Temple discriminated\nagainst him upon learning of his special education curriculum,\nanticipating that he would be designated a nonqualifier by the\nNCAA as a result of that curriculum. Id. at 469-70. After\n\n\n       3\n        Nonqualifier status also prohibits a student athlete from\nhaving any contact with an institutions’s athletic team, including\nattending team meetings, access to the training staff, weight\nroom activities, and team meals.\n\n                                  9\n\fBowers was officially designated as such, all recruiting efforts\nended. Id. at 470.\n       Bowers nonetheless enrolled as a commuter student at\nTemple for the Fall 1996 semester. He did not take any classes\nat that time, however, because he was scheduled to undergo\nback surgery. Bowers did begin taking classes in the Spring\n1997 semester, however, and did very well, making the Dean’s\nList with a 3.63 GPA. Despite these promising developments,\nby the Fall 1997 semester, Bowers’ academic and personal life\nhad apparently begun to deteriorate. His grades declined during\nthe Fall 1997 semester and he began treatment for depression,\ntaking antidepressant medication prescribed by his family\nphysician. In addition, by this time Bowers had begun abusing\npainkillers such as Percocet, Hydrocodone, and Tylenol with\ncodeine that had originally been prescribed to him between Fall\n1996 and 1997 to manage pain associated with a back injury.\nBy the Spring 1998 semester, he had stopped attending classes.\nAlthough he enrolled for classes in the Fall 1998 semester,\nBowers did not attend them and eventually dropped out of\nschool altogether.\n       From the Fall of 1998 until mid-2001, Bowers was in and\nout of drug treatment and mental health programs and, in April\n1999, was hospitalized after attempting to commit suicide. In\n2002, however, Bowers showed some signs of recovery. He\nmatriculated at American International College for the Spring\n2002 semester, earned good grades, and participated in the\nspring football conditioning program in anticipation of joining\nthe team for the fall semester. Sadly, any recovery efforts ended\nabruptly on June 2, 2002, when Bowers, home from school for\nthe summer, died of an apparent drug overdose.\n\n                               10\n\fB.     Procedural History\n       While we have already explored the prior proceedings in\nthis case at some length in a previous appeal, 346 F.3d 402 at\n408-10, we are obliged to once again carefully wade into the\nthicket to disentangle the issues before us. To be thorough, we\nreview the entire proceedings; for the sake of brevity and clarity,\nhowever, we describe in detail only those aspects of the prior\nproceedings immediately relevant to our analysis.\n       On May 23, 1997, following his Spring 1997 semester at\nTemple, Bowers filed a complaint in the United States District\nCourt for the District of New Jersey alleging, inter alia, that the\nNCAA and ACT/Clearinghouse had violated Titles II and III of\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), 42\nU.S.C. §§ 12132, 12182, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), in their treatment of him. After\nthe District Court denied Bowers’ motion for a preliminary\ninjunction, Bowers I, 974 F. Supp. 459, he filed an amended\ncomplaint joining Temple, the University of Iowa, and\nAmerican International College as defendants and adding state\nlaw claims under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination\n(“NJLAD”), N.J. Stat. Ann. §§ 10:5-1 ! 10:5-49.\n       Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, or in the\nalternative, a motion for summary judgment. The District Court\ndismissed the ADA claim against ACT/Clearinghouse because\nthere was no evidence that it owned, leased, or operated a place\nof public accommodation, as required under Title III.4 Bowers\n\n\n       4\n        Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12181 et seq.,\nprohibits discrimination against the disabled in the full and equal\n\n                                11\n\fII, 9 F. Supp. 2d at 481-83 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a)). It\nalso dismissed a Sherman Act claim against all of the\nDefendants on the basis of our opinion in Smith v. NCAA, 139\nF.3d 180 (3d Cir. 1998), in which we held that “eligibility rules\nare not related to the NCAA’s commercial or business\nactivities” because “rather than intending to provide the NCAA\nwith a commercial advantage, the eligibility rules primarily seek\nto ensure fair competition in intercollegiate athletics.” Id. at\n185. The District Court denied the motion in all other respects.\n        Thereafter, the parties engaged in discovery. Defendants\nthen filed a motion for summary judgment. In a lengthy\npublished opinion dated November 2, 2000, the Court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of ACT/Clearinghouse on Bowers’\nRehabilitation Act claim, finding that the record was clear that\nACT/Clearinghouse did not receive federal funds. Bowers III,\n118 F. Supp. 2d 494. The District Court also granted summary\njudgment in favor of ACT/Clearinghouse on Bowers’ breach of\ncontract claim.5 It denied summary judgment in all other\nrespects. In doing so, the Court rejected the argument of\nTemple and the University of Iowa that they had stopped\nrecruiting Bowers for nondiscriminatory reasons, i.e., because\nhe was undersized and not skilled enough to be a Division I\n\n\n\n\nenjoyment of public accommodations, 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a),\nand public transportation services, 42 U.S.C. § 12184(a).\n       5\n        The last remaining claim against ACT/Clearinghouse\nunder the NJLAD was dismissed on August 6, 2001. Bowers\nVII, 151 F. Supp. 2d at 543.\n\n                               12\n\flineman, finding that there were material issues of fact as to why\nthe schools stopped recruiting him. Id. at 512-13.\n        On February 2, 2001, the District Court granted the\nNCAA’s motion for reconsideration and granted summary\njudgment in favor of the NCAA and American International\nCollege on Bowers’ Title III ADA claim. Bowers IV, 130 F.\nSupp. 2d 610. The Court concluded that Bowers was not\nentitled to injunctive relief because NCAA rules permitted\npartial qualifiers to gain a fourth year of eligibility.6 As a result,\nsince Bowers no longer had standing to seek injunctive relief –\nthe only form of relief available under Title III – the Court\ndismissed his claim. Id. at 614.7 A few days later, the District\nCourt issued an opinion and order allowing Bowers to file a\nsecond amended complaint to: (1) clarify that he sought non-\ninjunctive relief against Temple and the University of Iowa\nunder the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA; and (2) to add three\nstate law claims against the University of Iowa for promissory\nestoppel, equitable estoppel, and fraud. Bowers V, 2001 WL\n1850089, at *3. The claims against the University of Iowa were\n\n\n       6\n        Consequently, Bowers’ period of potential eligibility\nwas not any shorter than the period would have been had he\nbeen deemed an initial qualifier. Bowers’ inability to gain a\nfourth year of eligibility was the sole basis upon which the\nDistrict Court had previously determined that Bowers had\nstanding to seek injunctive relief. Id. at 614.\n       7\n       The Court also dismissed any claims for injunctive relief\nthat Bowers could otherwise assert against the Defendants under\nthe Rehabilitation Act. Id.\n\n                                 13\n\fpermitted to be added without prejudice to enable the University\nto develop an evidentiary record to support its argument that it\nwas an “arm of the state” and thus entitled to Eleventh\nAmendment immunity. Following that discovery, on July 3,\n2001, the District Court issued a decision finding that the\nUniversity of Iowa was not an arm of the state and not entitled\nto sovereign immunity. Bowers VI, 2001 WL 1772801.\n       Another matter had arisen in the case involving third-\nparty contribution. After the District Court’s November 2000\nsummary judgment order, Temple filed a third-party complaint\nseeking contribution for any monetary liability it might have to\nBowers from Delaware State University (“Delaware State”),\nUniversity of Massachusetts-Amherst (“UMass-Amherst”), and\nUniversity of Memphis (“Memphis”), schools that also had\nallegedly recruited Bowers. The third-party defendants brought\nmotions to dismiss the complaint, arguing: (1) neither Title II\nof the ADA nor Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\ncontemplate an award for contribution; (2) the universities had\nEleventh Amendment immunity; and (3) Congress’s purported\nabrogation and waiver of immunity in Title II of the ADA was\nunconstitutional.\n       On November 7, 2001, the District Court ruled on the\nthird-party motions. Bowers VIII, 171 F. Supp. 2d 389. It\ngranted in part and denied in part Memphis’s motion, finding\nthat Memphis was an arm of the State of Tennessee for Eleventh\nAmendment purposes and so Temple’s contribution claim under\nthe NJLAD state law claim against Memphis was barred by the\ndoctrine of sovereign immunity. However, as to the federal\nclaims, it found (1) there is a right of contribution under Title II\nof the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,\n\n                                14\n\f(2) Congress validly abrogated Tennessee’s Eleventh\nAmendment immunity under Title II of the ADA, and\n(3) Tennessee waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity under\nthe Rehabilitation Act by accepting federal funds. The District\nCourt did not make any other dispositive rulings on Eleventh\nAmendment issues, but instead ordered UMass-Amherst and\nDelaware State to submit additional briefing on these issues and\ngranted Temple an opportunity to reply to this briefing.\n        Following briefing, the District Court subsequently held\nthat: (1) Eleventh Amendment immunity barred Temple’s\nclaims for contribution against UMass-Amherst pursuant to\nNJLAD; (2) UMass-Amherst was not immune from contribution\nclaims asserted under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act;\n(3) dismissal without prejudice was warranted with respect to\nclaims for contribution under the NJLAD against Delaware\nState; (4) a stay pending Memphis’s appeal from denial of\nsovereign immunity defenses was mandated; and (5) a\ncertification for immediate, interlocutory appeal was warranted\nwith respect to the Court’s determination that a general right of\ncontribution existed under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.\nBowers IX, 188 F. Supp. 2d 473.\n        On appeal, we did not reach the Eleventh Amendment\nissue, but rather concluded that there was not a right to\ncontribution under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and\nTitle II of the ADA. 346 F.3d at 433. Even more importantly,\nfor purposes of our present appeal, we rejected the University of\nIowa’s argument that we had pendent appellate jurisdiction to\nconsider its untimely appeal of the District Court’s Eleventh\nAmendment ruling. Id. at 412. We noted, however, that we\nlikely would have to consider the Eleventh Amendment\n\n                               15\n\fargument eventually, but not until after a final judgment. Id.\nn.8.\n        The District Court had stayed all matters while the case\nwas on appeal.8 When the case returned from appeal, the parties\nthereafter engaged in further discovery heading toward a\ncontemplated October 2004 trial date. On May 3, 2004, the\nparties entered into a confidentiality stipulation and protective\norder for plaintiff to disclose Michael Bowers’ medical records.9\nOn May 11, 2004, the scheduled date of Kathleen Bowers’\ndeposition, attorneys for Bowers provided to Defendants for the\nfirst time some of Michael Bowers’ medical records. Because\nthese records showed for the first time that he had a preexisting\ndrug condition that was not disclosed to Defendants, the District\nCourt entered a series of orders directing Michael Bowers’\nmedical providers to release all of his medical records. Upon\nrelease of these records, the full extent of Bowers’ substance\nabuse and substance abuse treatment became apparent.\n\n\n       8\n         During that period, two significant events occurred.\nFirst, as already related, Michael Bowers died on June 2, 2002,\nas a result of an apparent cocaine and heroin overdose. This was\nthe first indication to Defendants that Bowers had any kind of\ndrug problem. Second, the original district judge retired from\nthe bench. The case was reassigned to District Judge Simandle,\nwho inherited the procedural morass at the eleventh hour and\nwas confronted with the difficult question of how to deal with\nthe consequences of Bowers’ non-disclosures.\n       9\n       At this point in the dispute, the NCAA, Temple, and the\nUniversity of Iowa remained as Defendants.\n\n                               16\n\fThereafter, on October 15, 2004, Temple moved for sanctions,\narguing that the case should be dismissed with prejudice as a\nsanction for Bowers’ concealment of substance abuse and\nsubstance abuse treatment. It also moved for summary\njudgment, arguing that Bowers was not a qualified individual\nwith a disability as a result of his drug use. The NCAA and the\nUniversity of Iowa joined the motions.\n       The parties did not dispute that Bowers and attorneys for\nBowers had failed to disclose information regarding Michael\nBowers’ substance abuse and his depression to Defendants until\nMay 2004, nearly two years following his death. However,\nattorneys for Bowers argued that the discovery requests were\nnarrow and they were therefore not required to seasonably\namend them under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(e)(2) to\ndisclose treatment for alcoholism or depression. The District\nCourt rejected this argument, and determined that Bowers’\nfailure to disclose the information in a timely fashion was a\nwillful one, in bad faith, and that it irreparably prejudiced\nTemple’s ability to prepare a defense to Bowers’ claims.\nBowers X, No. 97-2600 (D.N.J. March 21, 2005).\n       The District Court further concluded that evidence of\nMichael Bowers’ drug use was relevant not only to the issue of\ndamages, but also to questions of liability. Consequently, the\nDistrict Court entered a sanctions order pursuant to Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure 37(c)(1) and 37(b)(2)(B). This\nsanctions order impaired Bowers’ case in critical fashion. First,\nit precluded her from using any previously concealed\ninformation to support her claim that Defendants were liable for\nMichael Bowers’ drug abuse and depression. Second, they\nprecluded her from opposing Defendants’ claim that Michael\n\n                               17\n\fBowers’ drug abuse rendered him unqualified to participate in\nintercollegiate athletics at all relevant times, which as a practical\nmatter meant Defendants would be immune from liability.10 See\nOrder granting Motion for Joinder, granting Motion for\nSanctions & granting Motion for Summary Judgment,\nNo. 97-2600 (Simandle, J.) (March 21, 2005).\n       The District Court then considered Temple’s renewed\nmotion for summary judgment in light of the sanctions it\nimposed and concluded that Bowers was not a “qualified\nindividual with a disability” under the ADA nor “otherwise\nqualified” under the Rehabilitation Act because his “drug use\nmade him ineligible to compete for Temple or any other\nschool.” Bowers X, No. 97-2600, at 37-38. The Court granted\nthe motion for joinder of the remaining Defendants and\ndismissed Bowers’ case against all Defendants. The District\nCourt did not reach the University of Iowa’s motion for\nreconsideration on Eleventh Amendment grounds, dismissing\nthe claim as moot.\n      Four parties filed timely appeals. Bowers filed an appeal\nfrom: (1) the March 21, 2005 Order granting defendant\nTemple’s motion for sanctions against Bowers and Defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment; and (2) the June 8, 1998 order\n\n       10\n          To bring a claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must\ndemonstrate she was “otherwise qualified” at the time of the\nallegedly unlawful discrimination. By precluding her from\nchallenging Defendants’ assertion that Michael Bowers was\n“unqualified” at the time of the allegedly unlawful\ndiscrimination, the sanctions thus effectively crippled Bowers’\nability to establish a necessary element of her claim.\n\n                                 18\n\fwhich dismissed with prejudice her Sherman Act claims with\nrespect to all Defendants.11 Bowers’ attorneys, Barbara E.\nRansom and Richard L. Bazelon, each separately filed an appeal\nfrom the sanctions portion of the March 21, 2005 order. Finally,\nthe University of Iowa filed a cross-appeal from: (1) the\nMarch 21, 2005 order of the District Court dismissing as moot\nits renewed motion for summary judgment based on sovereign\n\n\n       11\n         Bowers has waived this portion of her appeal, failing to\nformally present or even mention in passing the District Court’s\ndismissal of her Sherman Act claims as an issue in her brief.\nSee Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28; see also Canady v.\nCrestar Mortgage Corp., 109 F.3d 969, 973-74 (4th Cir. 1997)\n(finding issue specified in notice of appeal but not mentioned in\nappellate brief was deemed waived); Williams v. Chater, 87\nF.3d 702, 706 (5th Cir. 1996) (holding issues raised in notice of\nappeal but not briefed are deemed waived); Cumberland Farms,\nInc. v. Montague Econ. Dev. and Indus. Corp., 78 F.3d 10, 12\nn.1 (1st Cir. 1996) (holding appellant waived issue raised in\nnotice of appeal when it was not referred to in brief); Tilson v.\nForrest City Police Dep’t, 28 F.3d 802, 806 n.8 (8th Cir. 1994)\n(holding appellant waived issues that it raised in notice of appeal\nbut failed to brief on appeal). However, we note that even if this\nissue were not waived, our decision in Smith, 139 F.3d at 185\n(“[E]ligibility rules are not related to the NCAA’s commercial\nor business activities” because “rather than intending to provide\nthe NCAA with a commercial advantage, the eligibility rules\nprimarily seek to ensure fair competition in intercollegiate\nathletics.”), clearly precludes Bowers from sustaining Sherman\nAct claims in this case.\n\n                                19\n\fimmunity; and (2) the July 3, 2001 order denying it immunity\nfrom Bowers’ ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and NJLAD claims.\n       The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n§§ 1331, 1337, 1343, and 42 U.S.C. §§ 12133, 12188, based on\nthe federal claims asserted by Bowers. The District Court had\nsupplemental jurisdiction over Bowers’ state-law claims,\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. We have jurisdiction under 28\nU.S.C. § 1291 to hear this appeal from the final order of the\nDistrict Court entering summary judgment on all claims.\n                       II. ANALYSIS\nA.     The District Court’s Grant of Summary Judgment\n       We begin our analysis with the issue of summary\njudgment because our disposition of this issue will help clarify\nour subsequent discussion of the preclusion sanctions ordered in\nthis case. Our standard of review on an appeal from a grant of\nsummary judgment is plenary, Dowling v. City of Phila., 855\nF.2d 136, 141 (3d Cir. 1988), applying the same standard the\nDistrict Court was required to apply. Olson v. Gen. Elec.\nAstrospace, 101 F.3d 947, 951 (3d Cir. 1996) (citations\nomitted). That standard is provided by Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 56(c), which directs that summary judgment may be\ngranted only when “there is no genuine issue as to any material\nfact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\nmatter of law.” In following this directive, we must take the\nfacts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\nBowers, and draw all reasonable inferences in her favor.\nMcCarthy v. Recordex Serv., Inc., 80 F.3d 842, 847 (3d Cir.\n1996).\n\n\n\n                              20\n\f       The District Court’s summary judgment analysis in this\ncase was fundamentally flawed in that it failed to focus on the\ncorrect time frame with respect to Defendants’ liability. We\nhave clearly stated that the determination of whether a person\nwas a “qualified individual with a disability” for the purposes of\nan ADA claim12 is not made from the time the lawsuit was filed\nor any other later time period, but from the point at which the\nalleged discriminatory decision was made. Turner v. Hershey\nChocolate U.S., 440 F.3d 604, 611 (3d Cir. 2006); Gaul v.\nLucent Techs., 134 F.3d 576, 580; see also Bates v. Long Island\nR.R. Co., 997 F.2d 1028, 1035 (2d Cir. 1993). In this case, the\nallegedly discriminatory conduct occurred over the course of the\nFall 1995-96 school year, during which time Bowers was\ndeemed to be a nonqualifier and the defendant universities in\nthis case allegedly stopped recruiting him for that reason.13\n\n       12\n         Although the language of the ADA and Rehabilitation\nAct differs, the standards for determining liability under the two\nstatutes are identical. McDonald v. Pa. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare,\n62 F.3d 92, 94 (3d Cir. 1995) (“Whether suit is filed under the\nRehabilitation Act or under the Disabilities Act, the substantive\nstandards for determining liability are the same.”) (citation\nomitted). Similarly, we have held that the NJLAD relies on the\nsame analytical framework as the ADA. Gaul v. Lucent Techs.,\nInc., 134 F.3d 576, 580 (3d Cir. 1998).\n       13\n           The NCAA itself recognized that the relevant time\nframe for determining whether Bowers was qualified to be a\nDivision I football player was 1995-96. See Letter from NCAA\nCounsel to U.S. Magistrate Judge Rosen (May 26, 2004) (“The\nissue . . . is whether there was disability discrimination . . . that\n\n                                 21\n\f        The District Court had previously correctly identified\nBowers’ claims as stemming from alleged unlawful\ndiscrimination taking place in 1995-96. In its November 2000\nsummary judgment opinion, Bowers III, 118 F. Supp. 2d 494,\nthe District Court recognized that the case turned on whether\nBowers was discriminated against in 1995-96, when Bowers\nwas a high-school senior and then a college freshman. Id. at 499\n(“Bowers has . . . sued Temple University, the University of\nIowa, and American International College for discrimination on\nthe ground that these schools stopped recruiting Bowers to play\nfootball when they concluded that his learning disability would\nlikely result in the NCAA declaring him a non-qualifier.”); id.\n(“Bowers alleges that the NCAA discriminated against him\nbecause of his disability in declaring him ineligible to participate\nin intercollegiate athletics as a college freshman.”).\n        Situating Bowers’ claims in Fall 1995-96 and taking all\nreasonable inferences in Bowers’ favor as the nonmoving party,\nwe find there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\nBowers was a “qualified individual with a disability” or\n“otherwise qualified,” under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act,\nrespectively. Furthermore, Michael Bowers’ drug abuse does\nnot preclude Bowers’ claims. The evidence of any substance\nabuse in 1995-96 is minimal. Bowers apparently tried marijuana\nfor the first time in 1991 at age 13 but appeared to use the drug\ninfrequently. His last reported marijuana use was in July 1998,\nat which point he reported he had shared a “joint” five times\n\n\n\noccurred in 1995-1996, when under the NCAA rules Bowers\nwas deemed a ‘non-qualifier.’”) (emphasis in original).\n\n                                22\n\fover the past year.14 There is no evidence that Bowers was\ntaking any other illicit drugs in 1995-96. Bowers told\ncounselors at Seabrook House that drugs did not become a\nproblem for him until 1998. Dr. Carol Roberts, an expert\nretained by Bowers, stated in her report that: “In describing his\nown plunge into depression and addiction, Michael told me that\nin high school he had stayed away from drugs because he\nneeded to be in top physical condition to play sports. He\ngraduated in 1996, and at the end of 1998 while he was at\nTemple, he tried snorting cocaine with a friend.” The record\ndoes indicate that Bowers began taking painkillers in Fall 1996.\nHowever, while Bowers acknowledged that he eventually\nbecame addicted to these painkillers, he began taking them on\nprescription, and after he was already denied initial eligibility\nand after recruiting efforts has ceased. Furthermore, there is no\nindication that he would have failed an NCAA drug test for\ningesting prescription drugs. See NCAA policy 31.2.3.2.\n       All of the substance abuse evidence cited by the District\nCourt, with the exception of the inconclusive marijuana-use\nevidence, pertained to the use of those substances after 1995-96,\nat which point Bowers’ substance abuse was irrelevant for\npurposes of establishing liability in this case. In addition,\nDefendants’ argument that Bowers was unqualified at the\nrelevant time frame as a result of his drug abuse rests on the\nerroneous assumption that Defendants could have used evidence\n\n\n       14\n          Temple’s own counsel admitted at oral argument that\nthere was no evidence that Michael Bowers used marijuana in\nhis last year of high school, when he was seeking initial\neligibility. (App. 275).\n\n                               23\n\fof Bowers’ drug abuse as an after-the-fact justification for their\nallegedly discriminatory conduct. It is clear that the Defendants\nwere completely unaware of Bowers’ drug abuse at the time the\nallegedly unlawful discrimination took place in 1995-96 as well\nas during the time Bowers was at Temple. Indeed, that fact is\nthe very source of the controversy with respect to the sanctions\nin this case. In turn, the Defendants “could not have been\nmotivated by knowledge [they] did not have,” McKennon v.\nNashville Banner Publishing Co., 513 U.S. 352, 360 (1995), and\nthus cannot now claim that Bowers was deemed a nonqualifier\nbecause of his drug abuse. See also Mardell v. Harleysville Life\nIns. Co., 65 F.3d 1072 (3d Cir. 1995) (applying McKennon in\nunlawful discrimination context and holding after-acquired\nevidence of misconduct is relevant to damages but does not bar\nliability).\n       Thus, taking all reasonable inferences in Bowers’ favor,\nwe find genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether\nBowers was a “qualified individual with a disability” at the\nrelevant time period for establishing liability. The Defendants\nare therefore not entitled to judgment as a matter of law and,\naccordingly, we will reverse the District Court’s grant of\nsummary judgment.\nB.     The District Court’s Imposition of Preclusion Sanctions\n        Because we have concluded that the District Court’s\nsummary judgment analysis was erroneous for reasons\nindependent of the order of sanctions in this case, we need not\nreview the sanctions order under the standard set forth in Poulis\nv. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 747 F.2d 863 (3d Cir. 1984)\n(setting forth a test to determine when a trial court’s dismissal\nof a case pursuant to preclusion sanctions constitutes an abuse\n\n                               24\n\fof discretion).15 In this case, unlike in Poulis, the District Court\ndid not specifically impose dismissal of the case as a sanction.\nThus, based on our summary judgment ruling, even if the\nsanctions orders were entirely upheld, this would not result in a\nde facto dismissal of the case. However, we find that certain\naspects of the District Court’s preclusion sanctions analysis rest\non the same erroneous assumption as its summary judgment\nanalysis – namely, that Bowers’ alleged drug abuse was relevant\nfor purposes of determining liability in 1995-96. For this\nreason, as well as others discussed more fully below, we reverse,\nin part, the sanctions imposed.\n       The decision to impose sanctions for discovery violations\nand any determination as to what sanctions are appropriate are\nmatters generally entrusted to the discretion of the district court.\nNational Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, 427 U.S.\n639 (1976) (per curiam). We therefore review a district court’s\ndecision to impose preclusion sanctions for abuse of discretion.\nNewman v. GHS Osteopathic, Inc., 60 F.3d 153, 156 (3d Cir.\n1995). While this standard of review is deferential, a district\n\n\n       15\n         In Poulis, we set forth six factors to be balanced in\ndeciding whether to dismiss a case as a sanction: (1) the extent\nof the party’s personal responsibility; (2) the prejudice to the\nadversary caused by the failure to meet scheduling orders and\nrespond to discovery; (3) a history of dilatoriness; (4) whether\nthe conduct of the party or the attorney was willful or in bad\nfaith; (5) the effectiveness of sanctions other than dismissal,\nwhich entails an analysis of alternative sanctions; and (6) the\nmeritoriousness of the claim or defense. Poulis v. State Farm\nFire & Cas. Co., 747 F.2d 863, 868 (3d Cir. 1984).\n\n                                25\n\fcourt abuses its discretion in imposing sanctions when it\n“base[s] its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a\nclearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.” Cooter & Gell\nv. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 405 (1990).\n      The District Court found that Bowers and her attorneys\nhad failed to fulfill their duty under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 26(e) to supplement responses to discovery requests\nthroughout the course of litigation.16 More specifically, it found\n\n\n       16\n         Rule 26(e) provides as follows:\n       (e) Supplementation of Disclosures and\n       Responses. A party who has made a disclosure\n       under subdivision (a) or responded to a request\n       for discovery with a disclosure or response is\n       under a duty to supplement or correct the\n       disclosure or response to include information\n       thereafter acquired if ordered by the court or in\n       the following circumstances:\n       (1) A party is under a duty to supplement at\n       appropriate intervals its disclosures under\n       subdivision (a) if the party learns that in some\n       material respect the information disclosed is\n       incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or\n       corrective information has not otherwise been\n       made known to the other parties during the\n       discovery process or in writing. . . .\n       (2) A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a\n       prior response to an interrogatory, request for\n       production, or request for admission if the party\n       learns that the response is in some material\n\n                               26\n\fthat Bowers and her attorneys had willfully and in bad faith\nconcealed from defense counsel evidence of Bowers’ escalating\nsubstance abuse and substance abuse treatment. Therefore, in\norder to review this finding, it will be necessary to revisit the\nhistory of Bowers’ substance abuse and depression treatment.\nAs the District Court correctly perceived, “the history of\nPlaintiff's drug use is complex and convoluted but nevertheless\ncentral to the issues [in this case].” Bowers X, No. 97-2600, at\n9.\n        Bowers tried marijuana for the first time in 1991 at age\n13. It is unclear from the record how often he used it thereafter,\nbut his last reported use, as already stated, infra, was in July\n1998, at which point his use of that substance appeared to be\nintermittent. Between September 1996 and March 1997, after\nhurting his back lifting weights, Bowers was prescribed at least\nnineteen different painkillers, including Percocet, Hydrocodone,\nand Tylenol with codeine, to which he would eventually become\naddicted. By August 1998, Bowers had begun using heroin and\ncocaine. Approximately two months later, in October of the\nsame year, he first began to seek help for his substance abuse,\nentering an intensive two-week inpatient drug rehabilitation\nprogram at Seabrook House. Located in Bridgeton, New Jersey,\nSeabrook House is a prominent inpatient drug and alcohol\nrehabilitation center.\n\n\n      respect incomplete or incorrect and if the\n      additional or corrective information has not\n      otherwise been made known to the other parties\n      during the discovery process or in writing.\nFed. R. of Civ. P. 26(e).\n\n                               27\n\f        Following his inpatient program at Seabrook House,\nBowers attended a daily outpatient drug treatment program, also\nadministered by Seabrook House at a separate facility in Cherry\nHill, N.J.. This program included therapy sessions with a non-\nphysician drug counselor and a drug treatment program with a\nphysician, Dr. Lance Gooberman, who, from June 4, 1999 until\nBowers’ death, treated him for his drug addiction with an\nexperimental drug treatment program. Bowers also received\ninpatient treatment at Rancocas Hospital for bipolar disorder and\npolysubstance abuse from November 5, 1999 to November 26,\n1999. In addition, Dr. Alan Rosenweig treated Bowers for\ndepression and anxiety from December 7, 1999 to May 29,\n2001, during which time Bowers was hospitalized after\nattempting to commit suicide. Bowers then underwent inpatient\ndrug treatment on at least two more occasions at two separate\nfacilities – at Bergen Regional Medical Center from March 10,\n2000 to March 14, 2000, and at Zurbrugg Hospital in October\n2000, followed by daily outpatient treatment from October 2000\nuntil December 2001.\n       On August 7, 1998, Defendants served a set of\ninterrogatories on Bowers, including Interrogatory 15, which\nasked Bowers to “[i]dentify all physicians or physical therapists\nwho have treated or evaluated you from September 1, 1996\nthrough the present date” and to “describe in detail the reason\nfor that treatment.” On October 28, 1998, in response to\nInterrogatory 15, Bowers identified two physicians who treated\nhim during that time frame: Dr. Zeon Switenko (his family\nphysician) and Dr. Benjamin Smolenski (an orthopedist).\nBowers, who had just completed his two-week inpatient stay at\nSeabrook, did not mention that stay or indicate that any\nphysicians treated him during his time there. Nor did he\n\n                               28\n\fsupplement his answer to Interrogatory 15 at any time\nthroughout the course of the litigation to reference, at the very\nleast, Drs. Gooberman and Rosenweig.17\n        Interrogatory 19 of the August 7, 1998 interrogatories\nrequested that Bowers, “with respect to damages . . . describe in\ndetail each element of that relief; state all facts that provide the\nbasis of that relief, including the amount, if any; and identify all\ndocuments relating or referring to each component of that relief,\n. . . and identify every individual with knowledge of the facts\nrelating to those alleged damages or other relief.” Bowers\nresponded to Interrogatory 19 (under an objection), stating that\nhe sought consequential damages for loss of scholarship and loss\nof career opportunities in the amount of $150,000.00, and\ncompensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional\ndistress in the amount of $500,000.00. Additionally, Bowers\nstated that he could not compute punitive damages at that stage\nin the discovery process. Bowers did not identify any of the\nphysicians who had treated him as “individuals with knowledge\nof the facts relating to those alleged damages or other relief.”\nDefendants’ First Request for Production of Documents also\nserved on August 7, 1998, requested that Bowers produce “[a]ll\ndocuments identified in your answers to the interrogatories of all\ndefendants in this litigation.” Bowers did not produce any\ndocuments related to his treatment for substance abuse.\n\n\n       17\n         The standard instructions to the interrogatories stated\nthat the interrogatories were “continuing and any information\nsecured subsequent to the filing of [the] answers, which would\nhave been includable in the answers had it been known or\navailable, is to be supplied by supplemental answers.”\n\n                                29\n\f        Bowers testified at his November 30, 1998 deposition\nthat he became depressed after he was denied initial eligibility\nby ACT/Clearinghouse, and that he was prescribed two\nantidepressant medications by his physician, Dr. Switenko.\nBowers was then asked: “Other than Dr. Switenko has any\nother physician treated you for depression?” Bowers answered\n“No.” He was then asked if he had “ever seen another physician\nother than Dr. Switenko for treatment of anxiety?” Bowers\nanswered “No” to that question as well. At his January 11, 1999\ndeposition, Bowers also denied receiving any treatment for\ndepression since November 1998. Bowers did not disclose his\nstay at Seabrook or any subsequent treatment. Bowers also\ntestified in his March 1999 deposition that he was unaware why\nhe did not take any exams in the Fall 1998 semester, despite the\nfact that he had been recently discharged from inpatient drug\ntreatment at Seabrook.\n        As already stated, Defendants claim that Bowers willfully\nfailed to comply with discovery requests in violation of Rule\n26(e). Important to note, however, is that the discovery requests\nin this case did not request information regarding Bowers’ drug\nand alcohol addiction. Neither did Defendants make any\nexplicit request for Bowers’ medical records until March 15,\n2004. Consequently, we believe there is some merit to Bowers’\nargument that she had no duty to turn over that information prior\nto an explicit request. We recognize that modern discovery\nrules, particularly Rules 26 and 37, were enacted to prevent civil\ntrials in the federal courts from being “carried on in the dark.”\nHickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 500 (1947); see United States\nv. Procter & Gamble Co., 356 U.S. 677, 682-83 (1958)\n(“Modern instruments of discovery . . . together with pretrial\nprocedures make trial less a game of blind man’s bluff and more\n\n                               30\n\fa fair contest . . . .”). However, we agree with Bowers that the\nduty of supplementation under Rule26(e)(2) “does not require\nthat a party volunteer information that was not encompassed\nwithin the scope of an earlier discovery request.” Polec v.\nNorthwestern Airlines, Inc., 86 F.3d 498, 539 (6th Cir. 1996).\n       However, the interrogatories do plainly request\ninformation on “all physicians or physical therapists that have\ntreated [Michael Bowers].” The District Court was clearly\ncorrect in finding that the failure by Bowers and attorneys for\nBowers to turn over information regarding his subsequent\ntreatments with physicians for drug addiction from Fall 1998\nuntil his death was willful and in bad faith. Bowers did not\ndisclose any of the doctors that treated him at Seabrook, Bergen\nRegional Medical Center, or Zurbrugg Hospital. Nor did he\ndisclose that he had been treated by Drs. Gooberman and\nRosenweig. It is simply inconceivable that Bowers and counsel\nfor Bowers could not have recognized their obligation to\ndisclose treatment by these physicians given the clarity of\nDefendants’ discovery request for the information on “all\nphysicians.”\n       Moreover, the disclosure of this treatment clearly would\nhave led to discoverable information. It is virtually certain that\nDefendants would have learned of Bowers’ drug use had he\ndisclosed his treatment with Dr. Gooberman. Dr. Gooberman\nwas well-known for prescribing a controversial subcutaneous\n“pellet treatment” program for patients suffering from severe\nheroin addictions. In fact, Gooberman’s office letterhead states\nclearly that he specializes in “addiction medicine.” While\nBowers is correct that Defendants did not explicitly ask for\nmedical records or information about possible drug addiction,\n\n                               31\n\fhad Bowers complied with her discovery obligations,\nDefendants might have learned about Bowers’ drug use as early\nas October 1998. Indeed, following that crucial thread of\ninformation, Defendants would have been able to uncover\nBowers’ past drug use prior to his death and depose him on the\nsubject.18 Instead, that opportunity eluded them for four years\nas Bowers failed to disclose his course of substance abuse\ntreatment with multiple physicians. Allowing any information\nregarding Bowers’ substance abuse to be introduced\nposthumously by Bowers for her own advantage would thus be\npatently unfair to Defendants, who were clearly blind-sided by\nthat evidence. As a result, we find the District Court did not\nabuse its discretion in issuing preclusion sanctions with respect\nto Bowers’ drug use.\n        However, we find it was an abuse of discretion for the\nDistrict Court to preclude Bowers from introducing any\nevidence of his depression. Unlike Bowers’ drug problems,\nwhich would have been readily revealed had he disclosed his\ntreatment with Dr. Gooberman, Defendants were not blind-sided\nby evidence that Bowers had suffered from depression. Bowers\nwas forthright about his depression from the outset. Bowers’\ninitial Rule 26 disclosures requested “punitive damages for the\n\n\n       18\n         We reluctantly agree with Bowers that there is scant\nevidence in the record as to whether Michael Bowers was\ntreated by any physicians at Seabrook, Bergen Medical Center,\nor Zurbrugg Hospital. However, we find it difficult to imagine\nthat Bowers was not treated by a single physician during his\nmultiple inpatient hospital stays, including one for an attempted\nsuicide.\n\n                               32\n\fpain and suffering that [sic] the trauma of not being able to\nachieve his goal to play college football and the advantages that\nensue therefrom . . . .” Bowers responded to Defendants’\ninterrogatory requests that he sought consequential damages\nfrom loss of scholarship and career opportunities in the amount\nof $150,000.00, and compensatory damages for pain and\nsuffering and emotional distress in the amount of $500,000.00.\nTemple recognized this damage claim to be based upon Bowers’\ndepression, noting that in Bowers’ Rule 26 disclosures\n“[p]rincipally, he claimed to have been suffering from\ndepression.” Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. for Sanctions of\nDef. Temple University at 3. Defendants’ consolidated brief\nfurther acknowledges that Defendants were previously aware of\nBowers’ depression. Consol. Br. for Appellees at 14 (“Bowers\nlimited his emotional distress claims solely to depression from\nnot being able to play NCAA Division I football.”). Defendants\nalso recognized in their consolidated brief that they had\n“focused on [Bowers’] claim of depression during his\nJanuary 11, 1999 deposition,” and that “depression was the only\nemotional harm he identified under repeated questioning.” Id.\nat 15, 18.\n       While Bowers’ depression certainly may have become\naggravated by and intertwined with his drug abuse at some\npoint, we believe the two can be disentangled for purposes of\nestablishing damages in this case. Indeed, Bowers’ depression\nhas been a centerpiece of his claims for damages from the\ninception of this case, long before the clear onset of any\nsubstance abuse problems. Consequently, we conclude the\nDistrict Court’s blanket preclusion of evidence related to\ndepression reflects a “clearly erroneous assessment of the\nevidence in record” and was thus an abuse of discretion. Cooter\n\n                               33\n\f& Gell, 496 U.S. at 405. We will therefore affirm the sanctions\norder of the District Court only insofar as it precludes Bowers,\nin proving damages, from using evidence of his drug abuse and\ndrug abuse-related depression.\n        Furthermore, we reverse the sanctions order insofar as it\nprecludes Bowers from opposing Defendants’ claim that\nMichael Bowers’ drug abuse rendered him unqualified to\nparticipate in a program of intercollegiate athletics at all relevant\ntimes. That aspect of the sanctions order, again, reflects a\nfailure on the part of the District Court to correctly focus on the\ntime frame of 1995-96 as the relevant time period for evaluating\nthe claims in this case. As elaborated more fully in our\ndiscussion of the District Court’s summary judgment analysis,\ninfra Part II.A, 1995-96 is the time period in which the NCAA\nallegedly unlawfully discriminated against Bowers by denying\nhim initial eligibility. This is also the time period during which\nBowers alleges the university Defendants participated in that\nallegedly unlawful discrimination. This is therefore the relevant\ntime frame for purposes of establishing liability.\n        The District Court’s failure to focus on this period led to\na clearly erroneous assessment of the relevance of Bowers’ post-\n1995-96 drug abuse and concealment of that abuse. The Court\nconcluded that “evidence of record thus shows that Michael\nBowers’ pattern of substance abuse involving painkillers, heroin\nand other drugs, originally hidden, precluded his participation in\nintercollegiate athletics at all relevant times.” Bowers X, No.\n97-2600, at 41. However, at the relevant time for purposes of\nestablishing Defendants’ liability, 1995-96, the record is devoid\nof any evidence that Bowers was addicted to painkillers or had\nbegun using cocaine and heroin. There is no evidence that this\n\n                                 34\n\fdrug abuse began until after the relevant time period – after\nBowers had been denied initial eligibility and after the\nuniversity Defendants had stopped recruiting him.19 Thus, the\nDistrict Court’s conclusion that Bowers’ drug abuse was\nrelevant to the issue of liability is clearly erroneous and we\nreverse that part of its order precluding Bowers from opposing\nDefendants’ claim that Michael Bowers’ drug abuse rendered\nhim presumptively unqualified in Fall 1995-96.\nC.     Separate Appeal of Attorneys for Bowers with Respect\n       to Sanctions Order\n       As a threshold matter, we must determine whether\nattorneys for Bowers have standing to appeal the sanctions order\nin this case. Standing is the “irreducible constitutional\nminimum” necessary to make a justiciable “case” or\n“controversy” under Article III, § 2. Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). The sanctions order in this\ncase clearly granted Temple’s sanctions motion against Bowers,\nbut did not impose any additional monetary or disciplinary\n\n       19\n          In addition, the Defendants’ argument that they were\nsubstantially prejudiced by this concealment with respect to\ndefending against liability is undermined by the logic of\nMcKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co., 513 U.S. 352,\n360 (1995) (finding employer could not have been motivated by\nknowledge it did not have and claim that an employee was fired\nfor a nondiscriminatory reason), and Mardell v. Harleysville Life\nIns. Co., 65 F.3d 1072 (3d Cir. 1995) (applying McKennon in\nunlawful discrimination context and holding after-acquired\nevidence of misconduct is relevant to damages but does not bar\nliability).\n\n                               35\n\fsanctions on Bowers’ attorneys beyond factual findings and\nlanguage in the actual order that the conduct of those attorneys\nmerited sanctions. Defendants argue that because the District\nCourt did not impose any monetary penalty directly against\ncounsel, but rather limited the sanction to precluding plaintiff\nfrom introducing and challenging certain evidence that was\nwithheld under Rule 37, attorneys for Bowers have not suffered\na cognizable “injury” to establish Article III standing. Id.\n       We have previously stated that “an attorney subjected to\na sanction may appeal.” Bartels v. Sports Arena Employees\nLocal 137, 838 F.2d 101, 104 (3d Cir. 1988). However, a\nreview of the case law on this question reveals some\ndisagreement among the courts of appeals as to whether and\nwhen a court’s statement in a judicial opinion amounts to a\nsanction “affecting an attorney’s professional reputation” and\nthus “impos[ing] a legally sufficient injury to support appellate\njurisdiction.” Butler v. Biocore Med. Techs., Inc., 348 F.3d\n1163, 1167-68 (10th Cir. 2003). Most courts agree that mere\njudicial criticism is insufficient to constitute a sanction. United\nStates v. Talao, 222 F.3d 1133, 1138 (9th Cir. 2000); Williams\nv. United States, 156 F.3d 86, 90 (1st Cir. 1998); Bolte v. Home\nIns. Co., 744 F.2d 572, 573 (7th Cir. 1984).\n       In addition, courts are in near complete agreement that an\norder rising to the level of a public reprimand is a sanction. See\nBank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.S. 250, 263 (1988)\n(noting ability to issue a formal reprimand of attorney for\nviolating Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure); Talao, 222 F.3d\nat 1138 (equating formal finding with public reprimand and\nsanction); Williams, 156 F.3d at 91, 92 (“Words alone may\nsuffice [as sanctions] if they are expressly identified as a\n\n                                36\n\freprimand.”); Walker v. City of Mesquite, Tx., 129 F.3d 831, 832\n(5th Cir. 1997) (finding appealable sanction where attorneys\nwere “reprimanded sternly and found guilty of blatant\nmisconduct”); United States v. Horn, 29 F.3d 754, 758 n.1 (1st\nCir. 1994); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(2) (providing, inter\nalia, that sanctions may consist of “directives of a nonmonetary\nnature”). The reason for the courts’ consensus is that a public\nreprimand carries with it the formal censure of the court and\nmay, in many cases, have more of an adverse effect upon an\nattorney than a minimal monetary sanction. See, e.g., Precision\nSpecialty Metals, Inc. v. United States, 315 F.3d 1346, 1353\n(Fed. Cir. 2003). Only the Seventh Circuit has clearly held that\na public reprimand not accompanied by a monetary sanction is\nnon-appealable. Clark Equip. Co. v. Lift Parts Mfg. Co., Inc.,\n972 F.2d 817, 820 (7th Cir. 1992) (“[W]e have already decided\nthat an attorney may not appeal from an order that finds\nmisconduct but does not result in monetary liability, despite the\npotential reputational effects.”).\n        There is more substantial disagreement among the courts,\nhowever, as to whether a factual finding in an opinion that an\nattorney has engaged in improper conduct is in itself a sanction,\nor whether the court must enter an explicit order that the conduct\nis sanctionable. Compare Precision Specialty Metals, Inc., 315\nF.3d at 1353 (stating fact that reprimand not explicitly contained\nin separate order was not determinative in whether the court has\nentered a formal reprimand), and Walker, 129 F.3d at 832\n(factual finding of misconduct alone sufficient to constitute\nsanction), and Sullivan v. Comm. on Admissions and\nGrievances, 395 F.2d 954, 956 (D.C. Cir. 1967) (same), with\nWeissman v. Quail Lodge, Inc., 179 F.3d 1194, 1199 (9th Cir.\n1999) (stating that a factual finding in an opinion that “merely\n\n                               37\n\fserves to justify the imposition of a sanction is not an\nindependent sanction”); Williams, 156 F.3d at 90 (same); The\nBaker Group, L.C. v. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Ry. Co.,\n451 F.3d 484 (8th Cir. 2006).20 We need not examine that\ndichotomy in great detail in this case because both the order and\nopinion issued by the District Court in this case explicitly stated\nthat the Court was sanctioning not only Bowers but also her\nattorneys.\n        The sanctions order entered by the District Court states,\nin pertinent part, as follows:\n       It is this 21st day of March, 2005 hereby\n\n\n       20\n          The First Circuit’s approach (adopted by the Ninth) in\ndetermining whether nonmonetary verbal admonitions constitute\na sanction focuses on whether the judicial criticism is expressly\ndesignated in the order as a formal reprimand:\n        Let us be perfectly clear. Sanctions are not\n        limited to monetary imposts. Words alone may\n        suffice if they are expressly identified as a\n        reprimand. But critical comments made in the\n        course of a trial court’s wonted functions – say,\n        factfinding or opinion writing, do not constitute a\n        sanction and provide no independent basis for an\n        appeal.\nWilliams v. United States, 156 F.3d 86, 92 (1st Cir. 1998); see\nalso Weissman v. Quail Lodge, Inc., 179 F.3d 1194 (9th Cir.\n1999) (stating that a disparaging comment that merely serves to\njustify the imposition of a sanctions order is not an independent\nsanction).\n\n                                38\n\f       ORDERED that Defendant Temple University’s\n       motion for sanctions against Plaintiff and\n       Plaintiff’s counsel Barbara E. Ransom, Esq. and\n       Richard L. Bazelon, Esq. [Docket Item No. 301-1]\n       shall be, and hereby is, GRANTED;\nOrder granting Motion for Joinder, granting Motion for\nSanctions & granting Motion for Summary Judgment, No.\n97-2600 (March 21, 2005) (emphasis added).\n        In addition, on several occasions in its opinion, the\nDistrict Court made findings that these attorneys wilfully failed\nto disclose information to Defendants in bad faith, concluding\nthat “the actions of Plaintiff’s counsel rise above a mere lack of\ndue diligence, to the level of bad faith.” Bowers X, No.\n97-2600, at 32.\n       We find the weight of authority supports a finding that\nthe repeated, explicit public reprimand of the attorneys in this\ncase constitutes an appealable sanction. See Young v. City of\nProvidence, 404 F.3d 33, 38 (1st Cir. 2005) (finding a sanction\nwhere the district court explicitly imposed “the sanction of\npublic reprimand”); Precision Specialty Metals, Inc., 315 F.3d\nat 1352-53. In similar cases, courts have concluded that express\nfindings that a party violated a particular rule of civil procedure\nconstituted a sanction. See Young, 404 F.3d at 38 (finding\nsanction where the district court stated that attorney violated\nRule 11); Precision Specialty Metals, Inc., 315 F.3d at 1352-53\n(same); Butler, 348 F.3d at 1168 (explicit finding that attorney\nviolated state ethical rule was a sanction); Talao, 222 F.3d at\n1138 (same); Walker, 129 F.3d at 832 (same). The order here\nclearly rose above mere judicial criticism. The District Court\nconcluded not only that the attorneys violated Rule 26(e), but\n\n                                39\n\falso entered a public reprimand by explicitly granting the\nsanctions motion against Bowers’ attorneys. For these reasons,\nwe agree with attorneys for Bowers that the sanctions order in\nthis case is an appealable order.\n        We also agree that the District Court violated the\nprocedural due process rights of attorneys for Bowers in this\ncase. “Whenever the district court imposes sanctions on an\nattorney, it must at a minimum, afford the attorney notice and\nopportunity to be heard.” Weissman, 179 F.3d at 1198 (finding\nthat the district court violated attorney’s due process rights by\nfailing to give him notice and an opportunity to be heard prior\nto sanctioning him); see also In re Ruffalo, 390 U.S. 544, 550\n(1968) (stating that attorneys subject to disciplinary proceedings\nare entitled to procedural due process protections, including fair\nnotice of charges). It is clear that attorneys for Bowers had no\nnotice whatsoever that the District Court was contemplating\nentering sanctions against them prior to the hearing on Temple’s\nmotion. Temple’s original sanctions motion requested sanctions\nagainst plaintiff, not plaintiff’s counsel,21 and the purpose of the\nhearing was to determine whether sanctions imposed against\nplaintiff were warranted. Until the District Court’s opinion and\norder was filed, attorneys for Bowers had no idea that the Court\nwas even considering levying sanctions against them. Under\nthese facts, the District Court violated these attorneys’ rights to\nprocedural due process.\n       Accordingly, we reverse the sanctions order of the\nDistrict Court issued against attorneys for Bowers and remand\n\n       21\n         The sanctions motion stated that Temple “hereby moves\nfor sanctions against plaintiff Kathleen Bowers.”\n\n                                40\n\fto give the attorneys an opportunity to be heard before any\nfurther sanction is entered.\nD.     The University of Iowa’s Eleventh Amendment\n       Sovereign Immunity Challenge22\n        At the outset, we must state that it is clear that the\nUniversity of Iowa is not entitled to Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity as to its Rehabilitation Act claims. The University of\nIowa’s argument with respect to that claim has been foreclosed\nby our decision in Koslow v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\n302 F.3d 161, 168-76 (3d Cir. 2002), in which we held that a\nstate program or activity that accepts federal funds waives its\nEleventh Amendment immunity to Rehabilitation Act claims.\nIn this case, the University of Iowa clearly “concedes it and its\nstudents receive federal funds for purposes of Section 504.” Br.\n\n       22\n         We should clarify that Temple does not raise this issue.\nWe also note that in our previous dismissal of the University of\nIowa’s appeal from the District Court’s order of July 3, 2001,\nwe reserved judgment on the University of Iowa’s immunity\nclaims. Bowers v. NCAA, 346 F.3d 402, 412 n.8 (3d Cir. 2003).\nSpecifically, we recognized that “depending on the future course\nof this litigation we may have to entertain Iowa’s Eleventh\nAmendment arguments following final judgment.” Id. The\nDistrict Court’s March 21, 2005 order is a final judgment for\npurposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and we exercise jurisdiction\naccordingly. However, as the District Court’s opinion and order\nof March 21, 2005, did not address the University of Iowa’s\nsovereign immunity claim on the merits, we consider the Court’s\nJuly 3, 2001 decision on the merits as a touchstone for our own\nanalysis.\n\n                               41\n\ffor Appellee/Cross Appellant University of Iowa at 6. Thus,\neven if the University is an arm of the state, it has waived its\nEleventh Amendment immunity for Rehabilitation Act claims,\nand Bowers’ Rehabilitation Act claim will remain. As a result,\nwe will focus our analysis on the issue of whether the University\nof Iowa is an “arm of the state” of Iowa for the remaining state\nlaw claims and the Title II ADA claim.\n        The Eleventh Amendment to the United States\nConstitution provides: “The Judicial power of the United States\nshall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,\ncommenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by\nCitizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any\nForeign State.” U.S. Const. amend. XI. Although the language\nof the Eleventh Amendment refers only to “States,” the Supreme\nCourt has held that the immunity extends to entities that are\nconsidered arms of the state. See Regents of the Univ. of\nCalifornia v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425, 429 (1997); Pennhurst State\nSchool & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 101 (1984).\n        A state entity is properly characterized as an arm of the\nstate and thus “entitled to immunity from suit in a federal court\nunder the eleventh amendment when a judgment against it\n‘would have essentially the same practical consequences as a\njudgment against the State itself.’” Fitchik v. N.J. Transit Rail\nOperations, Inc., 873 F.2d 655, 659 (3d Cir. 1989) (quoting\nLake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency,\n440 U.S. 391, 401 (1979)). We have adopted a three-part test to\napply in order to determine whether an entity is an arm of the\nstate for Eleventh Amendment purposes. That test examines the\nfollowing three elements: (1) whether the payment of the\njudgment would come from the state; (2) what status the entity\n\n                               42\n\fhas under state law; and (3) what degree of autonomy the entity\nhas. Febres v. Camden Bd. of Educ., 445 F.3d 227, 229 (3d Cir.\n2006) (citing Fitchik, 873 F.2d at 659).23\n         In the past, we have afforded some prominence to the\nfirst factor, the so-called “funding prong,” i.e., whether payment\ncomes from the state treasury. Fitchik, 873 F.2d at 659\n(“Although no single Urbano factor is dispositive, the most\nimportant is whether any judgment would be paid from the state\ntreasury.”) (citing Urbano v. Bd. of Managers, 415 F.2d 247 (3d\nCir.1969)) . More recently, however, in Benn v. First Judicial\nDist. of Pa., 426 F.3d 233 (3d Cir. 2005), we held that “we can\nno longer ascribe primacy to the first factor,” concluding that it\nwas relegated “to the status of one factor co-equal with others in\nthe immunity analysis.” Id. at 239-40.24 Accordingly, each of\n\n\n       23\n         We refer to these three factors as the “Fitchik factors.”\n       24\n          That holding was necessitated by the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Regents of the University of California v. Doe, in\nwhich the Court stated that whether an entity is an arm of the\nstate for Eleventh Amendment purposes is not merely a\n“formalistic question of ultimately financial liability.” 519 U.S.\n425, 431 (1997). The relevant inquiry is “the entity’s potential\nlegal liability, rather than its ability or inability to require a third\nparty to reimburse it, or to discharge the liability in the first\ninstance.” Id. See also Fed. Mar. Comm’n v. S.C. State Ports\nAuth., 535 U.S. 743, 765 (2002) (“While state sovereign\nimmunity serves the important function of shielding state\ntreasuries . . . the doctrine’s central purpose is to accord the\nStates the respect owed them as joint sovereigns.”).\n\n                                  43\n\fthe factors must be considered equally in this case in assessing\nwhether the University of Iowa is an arm of the state for\nEleventh Amendment purposes.25\n        Whether a public university is entitled to Eleventh\nAmendment immunity is a fact-intensive review that calls for\nindividualized determinations. Although we have held in the\npast that the Pennsylvania System of Higher Education was\nentitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, Skehan v. State\nSystem of Higher Educ., 815 F.2d 244 (3d Cir. 1987), we have\nalso held that Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, was\nnot. Kovats v. Rutgers, The State Univ., 822 F.2d 1303, 1312\n(3d Cir. 1987). With this in mind, we proceed to examine each\nof the Fitchik factors with respect to the particular relationship\nbetween the State of Iowa and the University of Iowa.\n       1.     The State of Iowa is not obligated to pay a\n              judgment against the University\n        The funding prong of Fitchik requires us to determine\nwhether the payment of any judgment against the University of\nIowa would come from the public treasury of the State of Iowa,\ni.e., whether the State is legally liable to pay the judgment. See\nRegents of the Univ. of Ca. v. Doe, 519 U.S. at 431. In making\nthis determination, we “consider as a critical factor whether any\njudgment rendered against the entity would ultimately come out\nof state funds.” Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 668 (1974).\nThe District Court determined that the first factor weighed\n\n\n       25\n         The party asserting that it is entitled to sovereign\nimmunity has the burden of production and persuasion. Christy\nv. Pa. Turnpike Comm’n, 54 F.3d 1140, 1144 (3d Cir. 1995).\n\n                               44\n\fagainst affording the University immunity because: (1) the State\nof Iowa was not the predominant source of the funds for the\nUniversity, as only 21% of the University’s funding came from\nthe State; (2) the State did not proclaim itself legally obligated\nto assume responsibility for the University; and (3) the\nUniversity maintained its own funding sources independent\nfrom the state treasury. Bowers VI, 2001 WL 1772801, at *3.\n        The University argues that it will be required to pay\nindirectly any judgment against it because the State of Iowa will\nbe required to increase appropriations to the University to\ncompensate for the judgment. The appropriate question to ask,\nhowever, is whether the State is obligated to pay or reimburse\nthe University for its debts. See, e.g., Hess v. Port Authority\nTrans-Hudson Corp., 513 U.S. 30, 51 (1994) (“If the\nexpenditures of the enterprise exceed receipts, is the State in fact\nobligated to bear and pay the resulting indebtedness of the\nenterprise?”). As we recently explained in Febres in rejecting\na similar indirect liability argument, if a State is not under a\nlegal obligation to satisfy a judgment, then any increase in\nexpenditures in the face of an adverse judgment is considered a\nvoluntary or discretionary subsidy not entitled to Eleventh\nAmendment protections. Febres, 445 F.3d at 234. See also\nFitchik, 873 F.2d at 661 (noting that New Jersey law provided\nthat any increase in transit agency’s state appropriation as a\nresult of a judgment against the agency was deemed\ndiscretionary action by the State); Kovats, 822 F.2d at 1309\n(stating that under state law, Rutgers retained sole discretion\n\n\n\n\n                                45\n\fover its accounts and New Jersey law explicitly insulated itself\nfrom any liability on obligations running against Rutgers).26\n        The University of Iowa argued before the District Court\nthat Iowa Code § 8.32 demonstrates that the State of Iowa is\nobligated to pay for any outlay of funds necessary to pay\nBowers’ judgment. That section states that “[a]ll appropriations\nmade to any department or establishment of the government as\nreceive or collect moneys available for expenditure by them\nunder present laws, are declared to be in addition to such\nrepayment receipts, and such appropriations are to be available\nas and to the extent that such receipts are insufficient to meet the\ncosts of administration, operation, and maintenance, or public\nimprovements of such departments.” Iowa Code § 8.32.\nTranslating this code into plainer English, the University of\nIowa has argued that § 8.32 merely reveals that state\nappropriations are available to meet expenditures when the\nreceipts are insufficient. The District Court, however,\ndetermined that the code section does “not reveal an obligation\non the part of the state beyond that which has already been\nappropriated” because the section “merely establishes that the\n\n\n       26\n         Our focus can be distinguished from Brine v. Univ. of\nIowa, 90 F.3d 271, 275 (8th Cir. 1996) (holding University of\nIowa entitled to immunity) and Van Pilsum v. Iowa State Univ.\nof Sci. and Tech., 863 F. Supp. 935 (S.D. Iowa 1994) (holding\nIowa State entitled to immunity), in which the courts considered\nthe effect of a judgment on the state treasury, including whether\nit would cause the State to increase expenditures. As we follow\na different approach, those cases are inapposite with respect to\nthe funding prong.\n\n                                46\n\fstate appropriations previously allocated are available after an\nentity has exhausted the revenues it receives from non-state\nsources.” Bowers VI, 2001 WL 1772801, at *3. We find that\ninterpretation is plausible, although the code section is not\nentirely clear. However, we do not believe any further tortured\nparsing of the language of § 8.32 will be productive and we\nresist “convert[ing] the inquiry into a formalistic question of\nultimate financial liability.” Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Doe,\n519 U.S. at 431.\n       Therefore, while we find the first Fitchik funding factor\nmay tilt the scale against immunity because statutory language\ndoes not clearly obligate the State of Iowa to pay the\nUniversity’s debts, it is certainly not dispositive of the ultimate\noutcome in our analysis.\n       2.      The University is considered an arm of the state\n               under Iowa state law\n        The second Fitchik factor requires that we focus on\nwhether the State itself considers the entity an arm of the state.\nUnder the second factor, we look to how state law treats the\nentity generally; whether the entity can sue or be sued in its own\nright, whether the entity is separately incorporated, and whether\nthe entity is immune from state taxation. Febres, 445 F.3d at\n230.\n        This second factor clearly weighs in favor of immunity.\nThe University was created under the Iowa state constitution, it\nis the only constitutionally created university in the State, and it\n\n\n\n\n                                47\n\fhas not been separately incorporated by the State.27 The Iowa\nConstitution further provides that the “educational and school\nfunds and lands[] shall be under the control and management of\nthe General Assembly of this State.” Iowa Const. Art. IX, 2d.\n§ 1. University real estate is owned in the State’s name and the\nUniversity is unable to buy or transfer real estate without the\nexpress permission of a State Executive Council. Iowa Code\n§ 262.9. Most importantly, Iowa state law considers the\nUniversity to be a state agency. Sindlinger v. Iowa St. Bd. of\nRegents, 503 N.W. 2d 387 (Iowa 1993). Compare Febres, 445\nF.3d at 233 (noting that N.J. state law generally treated school\nboards as separate political subdivisions) with Benn, 426 F.3d at\n233 (stating that under the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s\ninterpretation of the state constitution, county judicial districts\nare state entities).\n       In addition, although the University may bring suit in its\nown name, it may do so only through the State Attorney\nGeneral’s Office, which also is obligated to defend the\nUniversity from suit. Iowa Code § 13.2. Furthermore, unlike\nNew Jersey’s tort claims act, which applies to New Jersey\ncounties and municipalities as well, see Fitchik, 873 F.2d at 663,\nIowa has separate tort claims acts for the State (Iowa Code ch.\n699) and political subdivisions (Iowa Code ch. 670).\n\n\n\n       27\n         Article IX, Section 11 of the Iowa Constitution states\nthat “The State University shall be established at one place\nwithout branches at any other place, and the University fund\nshall be applied to that Institution and no else.” Iowa Const.\nArt. IX, § 11.\n\n                                48\n\f       These facts sufficiently establish that the University of\nIowa is considered an arm of the state by the State of Iowa.\n       3.     The University’s autonomy is constrained by state\n              authority\n        The final Fitchik factor focuses on the degree of\nindependence from state control an entity exercises. The Board\nof Regents of the University of Iowa is tightly constrained by\nstate authority. The Board of Regents, which governs the\nUniversity of Iowa and all other state universities, consists of\nnine members, each appointed by the governor for a six-year\nterm (with the restriction that no more than five may be from the\nsame political party). Iowa Code. § 262.1, .2, .7. The governor\nof Iowa is entitled to remove a member of the board for cause\nwith the approval of a majority of the senate, Iowa Code\n§ 262.5, and the governor may suspend a board member when\nthe general assembly is not in session. Iowa Code § 262.5.\nBoard expenses are reimbursed by the state director of revenue,\nIowa Code § 262.29, who must report to the governor the\namount paid in services and expenses of officers and employees\nof the board. Iowa Code § 262.22. The Board’s powers are\nfurther regulated by Iowa Code § 262.9, which governs, inter\nalia, the Board’s procurement specifications of certain types of\nmaterials (e.g., the department of natural resources must review\nthe Board’s procurement specifications to ensure that the Board\npurchases recyclable materials and soybean-based inks), the\nUniversity’s acquisition and disposal of real estate, the\nUniversity’s ability to accept and administer trusts, and the\nnumber of University meetings and locations that may be held.\nThe Board may only acquire or transfer real estate with the\napproval of the State Executive Council, which consists of the\n\n                               49\n\fGovernor, State Auditor, State Treasurer, Secretary of State, and\nSecretary of Agriculture. Iowa Code § 262.9(7). Contra\nFitchik, 873 F.2d at 663 (noting that under New Jersey law the\nNew Jersey Transit was able to purchase and sell property\nwithout any state governmental oversight). The Board is\nauthorized to secure patents and copyrights from students,\ninstructors and officials, but they must become the property of\nthe State. Iowa Code § 262.9(11). Biennially, the Board is\nrequired to give an expenditures report to the governor and the\nlegislature and to submit a biennial budget. Iowa Code\n§ 262.26. In addition, the University is required to hire a budget\nanalyst to serve as a liaison between the State Department of\nManagement and the University in preparing the budget, Iowa\nCode § 8.29, and is required to report monthly expenditures and\nreceipts of funds to the state director of revenue and finance.\n       In light of these facts, is it apparent that the University of\nIowa is tightly controlled by the State of Iowa.28 Therefore, we\nfind the autonomy factor weighs in favor of Eleventh\nAmendment immunity.\n       4.      Weighing the factors\n       Summing up, the first Fitchik factor weighs slightly\nagainst immunity, while the second and third factors weigh\n\n\n       28\n        By contrast, in Kovats, the New Jersey governor had the\npower to appoint some of the board members to Rutgers, and\nthere were only two limitations on the board’s operation of\nUniversity: the board had to comply with (1) state budget\nappropriations; and (2) with state laws and regulations. Kovats,\n822 F.2d at 1312.\n\n                                 50\n\fheavily in favor of immunity. The District Court placed great\nemphasis on the funding prong in accordance with our pre-Doe\njurisprudence. Under current precedent, however, we are\nrequired to consider each of the factors equally when\ndetermining whether an entity is entitled to Eleventh\nAmendment immunity. Benn, 426 F.3d at 233.\n       In this case, we believe the overwhelming degree of state\ninvolvement in the University of Iowa warrants a finding that\nthe University is an arm of the state. While the State of Iowa is\nnot clearly obligated by statute to increase expenditures to the\nUniversity as a result of an adverse judgment, there is a high\ndegree of state involvement in the affairs of the Board of\nRegents and the University in general. In addition, under Iowa\nlaw the University is clearly considered an arm of the State.\nAccordingly, we find that the University of Iowa is entitled to\nEleventh Amendment immunity with respect to Bowers’ state\nlaw tort claims.\nE.     Congress validly abrogated Eleventh Amendment\n       immunity under Title II of the Americans with\n       Disabilities Act.\n        Having determined that the University of Iowa is entitled\nto sovereign immunity, we are required to consider the\napplicability of that doctrine to Title II of the ADA. The United\nStates, as intervenor, reminds us that judicial restraint requires\nus to “avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the\nnecessity of deciding them.” Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery\nProtective Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439, 445 (1988). In order to avoid\nthe constitutional question in this case, the United States\nsuggests we in effect prune away Bowers’ Title II claim, as\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides nearly identical\n\n                               51\n\fprotection. While we do not disagree that the protections\nafforded by Title II and Section 504 are substantially similar, see\nDoe v. Cty. of Centre, 242 F.3d 437, 447 (3d Cir. 2001), we do\nnot believe that prudence in the form of constitutional avoidance\nwarrants abrogating Bowers’ right to bring a claim under Title\nII. As our reversal of the District Court’s order of summary\njudgment has revived Bowers’ Title II claim, we are squarely\npresented with the constitutional question regarding that\nstatute’s purported abrogation of sovereign immunity. Thus,\nprudential concerns notwithstanding, we feel obliged to enter the\nfray. Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis,\nJ., concurring) (passing on a constitutional question is “a\nnecessity in the determination of [a] real, earnest, and vital\ncontroversy between individuals”).\n        In order for Congress to validly abrogate state sovereign\nimmunity, Congress must: (1) unequivocally express its intent\nto abrogate that immunity; and (2) act pursuant to a valid grant\nof constitutional authority. Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 528\nU.S. 62, 73 (2000). The first prong of this test is easily satisfied\nin this case, as Title II of the ADA provides that “[a] State shall\nnot be immune under the eleventh amendment to the\nConstitution of the United States from an action in [a] Federal\nor State court of competent jurisdiction for a violation.” 42\nU.S.C. § 12101(b)(4); see generally Board of Trustees of Univ.\nof Ala. v. Garrett 531 U.S. 356 (2001) (finding that the above\nstatutory provision was an unequivocal expression of\nCongressional intent to abrogate state sovereign immunity under\nTitle II). Our task then in this case is to determine whether\nCongress exceeded its authority under § 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment in purporting to abrogate state sovereign immunity\nunder Title II of the ADA with respect to public education.\n\n                                52\n\f        “Congress can abrogate a State’s sovereign immunity\nwhen it does so pursuant to a valid exercise of power under § 5\nof the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce the substantive\nguarantees of that Amendment.” Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S.\n509, 518 (2004). Under this “broad enforcement power,” id.,\nCongress may “enact so-called prophylactic legislation that\nproscribes facially constitutional conduct, in order to prevent\nand deter unconstitutional conduct.” Nevada Dept. of Human\nResources v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 727-28 (2003) (concluding\nthat the Family Medical Leave Act is a valid exercise of\nCongress’s § 5 power to combat unconstitutional sex\ndiscrimination). “When Congress seeks to remedy or prevent\nunconstitutional discrimination, § 5 authorizes it to enact\nprophylactic legislation proscribing practices that are\ndiscriminatory in effect, if not in intent, to carry out the basic\nobjectives of the Equal Protection Clause.” Lane, 541 U.S. at\n520. Thus, Congress’s § 5 authority can sweep in conduct that\nmay possibly be constitutional. See City of Boerne v. Flores,\n521 U.S. 507, 518 (1997) (“Legislation which deters or\nremedies constitutional violations can fall within the sweep of\nCongress’ enforcement power even if in the process it prohibits\nconduct which is not itself unconstitutional and intrudes into the\n‘legislative spheres of autonomy previously reserved to the\nStates.’”) (citation omitted).\n        Although Congressional authority under § 5 is broad, it\nis not unlimited. Lane, 541 U.S. at 520. The key limitation is\nthat Congressional action must not work “a substantial change\nin the governing law.” City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519. In this\nrespect, the Supreme Court has established a “congruence and\nproportionality” test: “Section 5 legislation is valid if it exhibits\n‘a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be\n\n                                 53\n\fprevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.’”\nLane, 541 U.S. at 520 (quoting City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 520).\nThe Court has enacted a three-step inquiry to determine whether\na particular statute satisfies the congruence and proportionality\ntest, which requires the parties to identify: (1) with some\nprecision the constitutional right at issue; (2) whether Congress\nidentified a history and pattern of unconstitutional\ndiscrimination by the States against the disabled; and\n(3) whether the rights and remedies created by the statute are\ncongruent and proportional to the constitutional rights it\npurports to enforce and the record of constitutional violations\nadduced by Congress. Garrett, 531 U.S. at 365, 368, 372-73.\n        For example, the purported abrogation of Title I of the\nADA failed that test in Garrett, in which the Court held that\nthere was not a pattern of constitutional violations with respect\nto public employment. Congressional findings had focused on\ndiscrimination in the private sector, and Title I’s broad remedial\nscheme was insufficiently targeted to remedy unconstitutional\ndiscrimination in public employment. See id. at 368-374. Thus,\nthe Court in Garrett held that the Eleventh Amendment bars\nsuits seeking money damages for state violations of Title I of the\nADA. The Court explicitly left open the question of whether\nsimilar suits could be brought for money damages under Title II\nof the ADA.29\n\n\n       29\n        The Court has also sustained other challenges to overly\nbroad and disproportional legislation that went beyond the scope\nof § 5. City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 532 (1997)\n(finding that Congress exceeded its § 5 authority in enacting\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993); Florida Prepaid\n\n                               54\n\f        That question was answered, to some degree, in Lane,\n541 U.S. 509. Lane involved a suit by two paraplegic plaintiffs\nwho claimed that they were denied access to the state courts by\nreason of their disabilities. In that case, the Court explained that\nTitle II was enacted “against a backdrop of pervasive unequal\ntreatment in the administration of state services and programs,\nincluding systematic deprivations of fundamental rights.” Id. at\n524. The Court referenced the numerous hearings held by\nCongress in connection with enacting the ADA, which revealed\n“that many individuals, in many States across the country, were\nbeing excluded from courthouses and court proceedings by\nreason of their disabilities.” Id. at 527. This evidence led\nCongress to make an explicit finding that disability-based\ndiscrimination persisted in access to public services and public\nfacilities. Id. at 529.\n        The Court then reviewed whether Title II was valid § 5\nlegislation with respect to the class of cases implicating the\naccessibility of judicial services.30 As to that conduct, the Court\nconcluded that Title II was a congruent and proportional\nresponse to remedy discrimination against disabled individuals\n\n\nPostsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527\nU.S. 627 (1999) (concluding that the Patent Remedy Act\nimplicated Article I concerns, not enforcement of the guarantees\nof the Fourteenth Amendment).\n       30\n         The Court reviewed the congruence and proportionality\nof Title II as applied to access to judicial services, not the\ncongruence and proportionality of Title II as a whole. Lane, 541\nU.S. at 531.\n\n                                55\n\fin the administration of judicial services. Congress chose a\nlimited remedy to enforce Title II with respect to access to the\ncourts. States are required to take “reasonable measures” to\nremove architectural and other barriers to accessibility, and, in\nthe case of older facilities in which structural changes would be\nmore difficult, states are able to adopt a variety of less costly\nmeasures to ensure access to judicial services. Id. at 532. As a\nresult, the Court concluded that Title II’s affirmative obligation\nto accommodate persons with disabilities in the administration\nof justice was a reasonable prophylactic measure targeted to a\nlegitimate end.\n       Lane, however, revealed disagreement amongst members\nof the Court as to whether Title II may subject States to money\ndamages for conduct that may in fact be constitutional. While\nthe majority opinion recognizes that Congress’s prophylactic\npowers under § 5 may proscribe some conduct that is facially\nconstitutional to “prevent and deter unconstitutional conduct,”\nLane, 541 U.S. at 529, the dissenting Justices forcefully argued\nthat Congress’s § 5 powers extend only to remedy actual\nconstitutional violations. See id. at 547 (Rehnquist, C.J.,\ndissenting), 559 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (“Nothing in § 5 allows\nCongress to go beyond the provisions of the Fourteenth\nAmendment to proscribe, prevent, or “remedy,” conduct that\ndoes not itself violate any provision of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.”) (emphasis in original). But see Constantine v.\nThe Rectors and Visitors of George Mason Univ., 411 F.3d 474,\n490 (4th Cir. 2005) (“[T]he question is not whether Title II\nexceeds the boundaries of the Fourteenth Amendment, but by\nhow much.”) (emphasis in original).\n\n\n\n                               56\n\f        This dispute was held in abeyance in the Court’s decision\nin United States v. Georgia, 126 S. Ct. 877 (2006). In Georgia,\na disabled inmate in a state prison brought a pro se action under\nTitle II of the ADA seeking money damages. The inmate\nalleged that he was confined within a small cell 23 to 24 hours\nper day, that he was unable to turn his wheelchair around in his\ncell, and that he was not afforded adequate facilities to use the\ntoilet and shower without assistance, which often was denied.\nIn addition, he claimed that he was denied a number of essential\nprison services as a result of his disability. Id. at 879. The\nCourt examined whether Title II of the ADA validly abrogated\nstate sovereign immunity with respect to the inmate’s claims. It\nnoted that the same conduct allegedly established the inmate’s\nclaims under both the Eighth Amendment and Title II. In this\nrespect, the Court agreed that “insofar as Title II creates a\nprivate cause of action for damages against the States for\nconduct that actually violates the Fourteenth Amendment,\nTitle II validly abrogates state sovereign immunity.” Id. at 882\n(emphasis in original). Because it was unclear as to what extent\nthe conduct underlying the inmate’s constitutional claims also\nviolated Title II, the Court ordered the case remanded back to\nthe District Court for the inmate to amend his complaint. Id. at\n882. The Court directed the lower court to (1) identify which\naspects of the State’s alleged conduct violated Title II;\n(2) identify to what extent such misconduct also violated the\nFourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct\nviolated Title II but did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment,\ndetermine whether Congress’s purported abrogation of\nsovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless\nvalid. Id.\n\n\n\n                               57\n\f       Thus, we are required to determine in the first instance if\nany aspect of the University’s alleged conduct forms the basis\nfor a Title II claim.31 In this case, the University allegedly\nviolated Title II when it refused to offer Bowers a scholarship on\nthe basis that he would not meet NCAA initial eligibility\nstandards. Title II prohibits a “qualified individual with a\ndisability” from being “excluded from participation in or be\ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a\npublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such\nentity” because of the individual’s disability. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12132. Bowers argues that the University of Iowa\ndiscriminated against him because of his learning disability: but\nfor the fact that his learning disability precluded him from\ntaking the requisite number of core classes in high school, he\nwould have been given a scholarship by the University. Bowers\nthus essentially states a claim under Title II that he was denied\naccess to a program at a public education institution because of\nhis disability.32\n\n       31\n         In Georgia, the Court remanded to the District Court for\nthis determination. 126 S. Ct. at 882. However, given the\nprocedural posture of this case, we find we are well situated to\nmake this determination ourselves. See Toledo v. Sanchez, 454\nF.3d 24, 32 n.2 (1st Cir. 2006) (“[A]s this analysis simply\nrequires a legal determination under the standard set out in Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and because a remand would further prolong\nthe lengthy course of this litigation, we will address these\nquestions.”).\n       32\n       To succeed on a claim under Title II, Bowers must\ndemonstrate: (1) he is a qualified individual; (2) with a\n\n                               58\n\f       Under Georgia, we are required next to determine\nwhether the alleged misconduct in this case, denying a student\nathlete eligibility to participate in intercollegiate athletics, also\nviolates the Fourteenth Amendment. Clearly, since the Supreme\nCourt has held that there is no fundamental right to public\neducation, San Antonio Indep. School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411\nU.S. 1, 35 (1973), there is no fundamental right to participate in\nintercollegiate athletics, a component of public education.\nLikewise, the Supreme Court has held that the disabled are not\na suspect class for purposes of an equal protection challenge.\nCity of Cleburne v. City of Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S.\n432, 439 (1985).33 Accordingly, we apply rational basis review\nto the Defendants’ application of the NCAA rule to Bowers.\nThe NCAA rule (and the universities’ adoption and application\nof the NCAA rule) easily passes muster under rational basis\nreview as the rule is designed to ensure that incoming student\nathletes can handle the rigors of college academia while\nengaging in intercollegiate athletics. See Bowers I, 974 F. Supp.\nat 461 (noting the NCAA’s view that the requirements “are\n\n\ndisability; (3) he was excluded from participation in or denied\nthe benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public\nentity, or was subjected to discrimination by any such entity;\n(4) by reason of his disability. Bowers III, 118 F. Supp. 2d at\n510.\n       33\n        In the context of public education, the due process\nclause may be implicated if a student is suspended or expelled\nwithout notice or an opportunity to be heard. See Goss v. Lopez,\n419 U.S. 565, 574 (1975). In this case, however, Bowers’\nclaims do not raise any procedural due process concerns.\n\n                                 59\n\fdesigned to assure proper emphasis on educational objectives,\nto promote competitive equity among institutions and to prevent\nexploitation of student athletes”). The NCAA rule – requiring\nstudent athletes to participate in certain basic core classes in\nhigh school – is rationally related to the end it attempts to\nachieve – ensuring that incoming student athletes are prepared\nto balance academics and athletics. The rule does not target\ndisabled individuals per se, but rather also targets those student\nathletes who have failed to satisfy their core course requirements\nfor other reasons, including sheer lack of effort. Consequently,\nthe rule does not create a caste system in which learning\ndisabled students can never qualify as student athletes. See City\nof Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 450 (finding that zoning legislation\nfailed rational basis review because it demonstrated irrational\nprejudice directed solely against the mentally retarded). Thus,\nthe NCAA rule and the university Defendants’ application of\nthat rule do not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. See also\nToledo, 454 F.3d at 33-34 (finding that a university’s actions in\nfailing to accommodate disabled student by allowing him, inter\nalia, to arrive late to class and to extend deadlines for work, did\nnot establish constitutional violations).\n        Having determined that the alleged misconduct in this\ncase states a claim for violation of Title II but not the Fourteenth\nAmendment, we arrive at the final step of Georgia’s tripartite\ntest. This step requires to determine whether Congress’s\npurported abrogation of state sovereign immunity is nevertheless\nvalid.34 The right at issue in this case, as in Lane, is the right to\n\n\n       34\n         As already stated, in making this determination we seek\nto identify: (1) with some precision the constitutional right at\n\n                                 60\n\fbe free from irrational disability discrimination. Lane, 541 U.S.\nat 522. The Court in Lane concluded that Congress had clearly\nidentified a history and pattern of disability discrimination with\nrespect to public services. Id. at 526.35 Therefore there is only\n\n\nissue; (2) whether Congress identified a history and pattern of\nunconstitutional discrimination by the States against the disabled\nwith respect to public services; and (3) whether the rights and\nremedies created by the statute are congruent and proportional\nto the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record\nof constitutional violations adduced by Congress. Garrett, 531\nU.S. at 365, 368, 372-73.\n       35\n         The Court considered evidence of disability\ndiscrimination in a variety of public services, not just limited to\naccess to the courts. See Lane, 541 U.S. at 523-26 (referencing\nvoting, serving as jurors, unjustified commitment, abuse and\nneglect of young persons committed to state mental hospitals,\nand irrational discrimination in zoning decisions). The Court\nconcluded that there was a documented “pattern of unequal\ntreatment in the administration of a wide range of public\nservices, programs, and activities, including the penal system,\npublic education, and voting.” Id. at 525 (emphasis added).\nSubsequent decisions of the courts of appeals have recognized\nthat the second prong of the Boerne test was conclusively\nestablished with respect to Title II by the Lane Court. See\nCochran v. Pinchak, 401 F.3d 184, 191 (3d Cir. 2005); see also\nConstantine v. The Rectors and Visitors of George Mason\nUniversity, 411 F.3d 474, 487 (4th Cir. 2005) (“After Lane it is\nsettled that Title II was enacted in response to a pattern of\nunconstitutional disability discrimination by States and nonstate\n\n                                61\n\fgovernment entities with respect to the provision of public\nservices.”); Assoc. for Disabled Americans, Inc. v. Fla. Int’l\nUniv., 405 F.3d 954, 958 (11th Cir. 2005). But see Toledo, 454\nF.3d at 35 (“We believe the sounder approach is to focus the\nentire City of Boerne test on the particular conduct of state\nconduct at issue.”).\n        Disability discrimination has clearly been identified in\nthe context of public education. As the Government documents\nextensively in its brief, there had been a long and sad history of\ndiscrimination against students with learning disabilities prior to\nthe adoption of Title II of the ADA. (See Gov’ts Br. at 23-34.)\nSee also Lane, 541 U.S. at 525 n.12 (citing examples of state-\nsanctioned public school discrimination); State ex rel. Beattie v.\nBd. of Educ. of City of Antigo, 172 N.W. 153 (Wis. 1919)\n(justifying the exclusion of a child with cerebral palsy from\npublic school because he would “produc[e] a depressing and\nnauseating effect” on other children). In concluding that\nCongress was justified in enacting Title II with respect to public\neducation, the First Circuit stated the following:\n        In sum, the thirty years preceding the enactment\n        of the ADA evidence a widespread pattern of\n        states unconstitutionally excluding disabled\n        children from public education and irrationally\n        discriminating against disabled students within\n        schools. Faced with this record of persistent\n        unconstitutional state action, coupled with the\n        inability of earlier federal legislation to solve this\n        “difficult and intractable problem,” Congress was\n        justified in enacting prophylactic § 5 legislation in\n        response.\n\n                                62\n\fone difficult issue left at this point in the inquiry: the congruence\nand proportionality of Title II with respect to public education.\n        We agree with the United States that “[a]s applied to\neducation, Title II is a congruent and proportional means of\npreventing and remedying the unconstitutional discrimination\nthat Congress found to exist both in education and in other areas\nof governmental services, many of which implicate fundamental\nrights.” Br. for the United States at 36-37. The remedy chosen\nby Congress in Title II in the area of public education is a\nnarrow one: access to education. Qualified individuals with a\ndisability may not be excluded from participating in public\neducation on the basis of their disability. Thus, states are free to\nenact a myriad of laws relating to public education, including\nlaws that may negatively impact disabled students, so long as\nthose laws do not discriminate against students because of their\ndisabilities. Congress enacted Title II against the backdrop of\nour regrettable national history in educating students with\ndisabilities. See infra note 35. As pointed out correctly by the\nUnited States in its brief, our national history in educating\nstudents with disabilities leaves much to be desired. In many\npast instances, States have made educational decisions on the\nbasis of irrational misconceptions and stereotypes held about\ndisabled students. See Gov’ts Br. at 27-32 (documenting\nvarious instances of exclusion and segregation of disabled\nstudents). Given this regrettable past history, Title II is a\njustifiable prophylactic measure to avoid the risk of\nunconstitutional treatment of disabled students.\n\n\n\nToledo, 454 F.3d at 39 (citing Hibbs, 538 U.S. at 735).\n\n                                 63\n\f        Reported cases from the courts of appeals since the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Georgia have likewise found that\nCongressional abrogation of sovereign immunity with respect to\npublic education was valid. As the Fourth Circuit observed in\nConstantine, Congress limited the scope of Title II in several\nrespects. First, the statute only protects “qualified individuals\nwith a disability.” Second, Title II permits States to limit\nparticipation in their programs and activities for all other lawful\nreasons. Third, Title II only requires States to make “reasonable\nmodifications” to accommodate the disabled, thus protecting the\nStates from having to compromise essential eligibility criteria\nfor public programs. Finally, States are able to make available\nother accommodations if structural modifications of physical\nstructures are too burdensome. 411 F.3d at 488-89. For those\nreasons, and against the backdrop of discrimination against\ndisabled students, the Constantine court concluded that Title II\nwas valid legislation as applied to public education. Id. at 490.\nSee also Toledo, 454 F.3d at 40 (“Title II’s prophylactic\nmeasures are justified by the persistent pattern of exclusion and\nirrational treatment of disabled students in public education,\ncoupled with the gravity of the harm worked by such\ndiscrimination.”); Assoc. for Disabled Americans, Inc., 405 F.3d\nat 959 (“Discrimination against disabled students in education\naffects disabled persons’ future ability to exercise and\nparticipate in the most basic rights and responsibilities of\ncitizenship, such as voting and participation in public programs\nand services. The relief available under Title II of the ADA is\ncongruent and proportional to the injury and the means adopted\nto remedy the injury.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                64\n\f       Accordingly, we join several sister circuits in holding that\nCongress acted within its Constitutional authority in abrogating\nsovereign immunity under Title II of the ADA.\n                      III. CONCLUSION\n        We agree with the District Court that this case has\nbecome an ongoing saga. With this opinion, we have\ncontributed yet another episode to the saga, but it has not been\nour intention to thicken the plot. With that in mind, we observe\nthat a central question has yet to be resolved: whether the\nDefendants, in their treatment of Michael Bowers, in fact\nviolated anti-discrimination law. Consequently, we will reverse\nthe order of summary judgment and remand this matter to the\nDistrict Court for treatment in accordance with the rulings stated\nherein.\n\n\n\n\n                                65\n\f",

During the\n\n                                4\n\fcourse of the proceedings, plaintiff Michael Bowers met an\nuntimely death and his mother Kathleen Bowers has been\nsubstituted for him. As a matter of convenience, throughout this\nopinion the plaintiff-appellant will be referred to simply as\n“Bowers.” In this consolidated appeal, Bowers alleges the\nDistrict Court abused its discretion by entering preclusion\nsanctions against her based on its finding that she and her\nattorneys committed discovery violations in bad faith. She\nfurther argues the District Court erred when it granted the\nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment, which relied in\nlarge part on the preclusion sanctions imposed. Attorneys for\nBowers each appeal separately from the sanctions order with\nrespect to their reputations, arguing the District Court’s failure\nto provide them with notice and an opportunity to be heard on\nthe issue amounted to a violation of procedural due process.\nFinally, the University of Iowa cross appeals from orders\ndismissing its motions asserting Eleventh Amendment immunity\nto Bowers’ claims. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we\nwill reverse the District Court on its grant of summary\njudgment, and, in part, on its order of preclusion sanctions\nagainst Bowers and her attorneys, and find that the University\nof Iowa is an arm of the state for purposes of Eleventh\nAmendment immunity but that Congress validly abrogated\nsovereign immunity under Title II of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act.\n                      I.

NCAA, No. 97-2600 (D.N.J. filed\nMarch 21, 2005) (“Bowers X”) (dismissing the case). The\nunderlying facts and events giving rise to the claims in this case\nare thus well documented.\n        Michael Bowers was a talented high school athlete with\na learning disability. This learning disability was identified\nearly on in his schooling as a “perceptual impairment” affecting\nhis ability to achieve in spite of intellectual ability and\ninterfering with his reading and writing skills.1 Pursuant to the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 42 U.S.C.\n\n\n       1\n        Bowers’ IQ testing placed him in the above-average\nrange; however, his specific learning disability affected his\norganization and processing skills. These deficiencies meant\nBowers needed extra time to take tests, required help with study\nhabits and organizational skills, and performed better in small\ngroup settings. Of the 24 classes Bowers took in high school,\nonly three were in a regular academic setting.\n\n                                6\n\f§§ 1400 et seq., Bowers had an Individualized Education\nProgram (“IEP”) prepared for him by a team of state-certified\npsychologists and professional educators. Bowers’ IEP\nprovided for him to take the majority of his classes in a special\neducation setting, and allowed him to take untimed standardized\ntests.\n        Bowers’ difficulties in the classroom contrasted sharply\nwith his prowess on the gridiron. As a high school football\nplayer in Palmyra, New Jersey, Bowers was recognized locally\nand regionally for his athletic achievements.2 At some point\nbetween his junior and senior years, these achievements began\nto attract attention more widely from recruiters for prestigious\ncollege football programs around the country. Numerous\nschools, including the University of Iowa and Temple\nUniversity (“Temple”), the two university Defendants in this\ncase, contacted Bowers to explore the possibility of recruiting\nhim. Throughout the recruiting process, Bowers received\nhundreds of recruitment-related letters and phone calls and was\npersonally visited by numerous college recruiters. The\ninstitutions expressing an interest in Bowers were members of\nthe National Collegiate Athletic Association (“NCAA”), the\npremier governing body of intercollegiate athletics in the United\nStates.\n      The NCAA includes over 1,200 educational institutions\ngrouped into different divisions determining the “scope of the\n\n       2\n        Bowers lettered three years as a varsity football player,\nwas first team “All Freedom Team” (conference wide team), and\nwas first team “All South Jersey” and second team “All South\nJersey” his junior and senior seasons respectively.\n\n                               7\n\fathletic program, the level of competition, and the amount of\nfinancial aid distributable through its athletic program.” Bowers\nII, 9 F. Supp. 2d at 467. One of the NCAA’s primary functions\nwith respect to high school athletes is to determine whether an\nincoming college freshman will be academically eligible to\nparticipate in intercollegiate athletics. The NCAA has described\nthe academic eligibility requirements as “designed to assure\nproper emphasis on educational objectives, to promote\ncompetitive equity among institutions and to prevent\nexploitation of student athletes.” Bowers I, 974 F. Supp. at 466.\n        The eligibility determination depends on several factors,\nincluding whether the athlete graduated from high school, the\nathlete’s high school grade point average (“GPA”) in thirteen\nrequired “core courses,” and the athlete’s Scholastic Aptitude\nTest (“SAT”) scores. The NCAA’s definition of core courses\nspecifically excludes special education classes taught below the\nhigh school’s regular academic instruction level. (NCAA Bylaw\n14.3.1.3). NCAA bylaws do provide, however, that special\neducation courses for the learning disabled may satisfy the core\ncourse requirement if the student’s high school principal submits\na written statement to the NCAA indicating that students in such\nclasses are expected to acquire the same knowledge, both\nquantitatively and qualitatively, as students in other core\ncourses. (NCAA Bylaw 14.3.1.3.4). NCAA bylaws also\nprovide for a waiver of eligibility requirements if the applicant\nsubmits objective evidence that demonstrates “circumstances in\nwhich a student’s overall academic record warrants the waiver\nof the normal application of the requirements.” (NCAA Bylaw\n14.3.1.7). The NCAA contracts with ACT, Inc. to run the\nNCAA Initial-Eligibility Clearinghouse\n(“ACT/Clearinghouse”), which, as its name suggests,\n\n                               8\n\fdetermines whether potential student athletes are initially\neligible to participate in college sports pursuant to NCAA\nregulations. ACT/Clearinghouse reviews applications submitted\nby prospective athletes and places an athlete into one of three\ncategories: (a) qualifier, (b) partial qualifier, or (c) nonqualifier.\n        On September 13, 1995, Bowers submitted his\napplication to ACT/Clearinghouse and after a series of\ncorrespondences with Bowers’ high school throughout the\n1995-96 school year, ACT/Clearinghouse issued its final\ncertification report officially determining that Bowers was a\nnonqualifier for two primary reasons: (1) his special education\ncourses did not satisfy the NCAA’s core course requirement;\nand (2) he took an untimed SAT exam, and his application\nlacked documentation required to accept such untimed\nstandardized test scores. Bowers II, 9 F. Supp. 2d at 469.\nBowers alleges that this designation as a nonqualifier had\nextremely severe negative consequences.           He lost the\nopportunity to receive an athletic scholarship, and was\nprohibited from practicing with or competing for any Division\nI or II football team his freshman year.3 Even before Bowers\nwas designated as a nonqualifier, Bowers alleges that\nDefendants University of Iowa and Temple discriminated\nagainst him upon learning of his special education curriculum,\nanticipating that he would be designated a nonqualifier by the\nNCAA as a result of that curriculum. Id. at 469-70. After\n\n\n       3\n        Nonqualifier status also prohibits a student athlete from\nhaving any contact with an institutions’s athletic team, including\nattending team meetings, access to the training staff, weight\nroom activities, and team meals.\n\n                                  9\n\fBowers was officially designated as such, all recruiting efforts\nended. Id. at 470.\n       Bowers nonetheless enrolled as a commuter student at\nTemple for the Fall 1996 semester. He did not take any classes\nat that time, however, because he was scheduled to undergo\nback surgery. Bowers did begin taking classes in the Spring\n1997 semester, however, and did very well, making the Dean’s\nList with a 3.63 GPA. Despite these promising developments,\nby the Fall 1997 semester, Bowers’ academic and personal life\nhad apparently begun to deteriorate. His grades declined during\nthe Fall 1997 semester and he began treatment for depression,\ntaking antidepressant medication prescribed by his family\nphysician. In addition, by this time Bowers had begun abusing\npainkillers such as Percocet, Hydrocodone, and Tylenol with\ncodeine that had originally been prescribed to him between Fall\n1996 and 1997 to manage pain associated with a back injury.\nBy the Spring 1998 semester, he had stopped attending classes.\nAlthough he enrolled for classes in the Fall 1998 semester,\nBowers did not attend them and eventually dropped out of\nschool altogether.\n       From the Fall of 1998 until mid-2001, Bowers was in and\nout of drug treatment and mental health programs and, in April\n1999, was hospitalized after attempting to commit suicide. In\n2002, however, Bowers showed some signs of recovery. He\nmatriculated at American International College for the Spring\n2002 semester, earned good grades, and participated in the\nspring football conditioning program in anticipation of joining\nthe team for the fall semester. Sadly, any recovery efforts ended\nabruptly on June 2, 2002, when Bowers, home from school for\nthe summer, died of an apparent drug overdose.\n\n                               10\n\fB.     Procedural History\n       While we have already explored the prior proceedings in\nthis case at some length in a previous appeal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783836\"><a href=\"/opinion/783836/michael-bowers-v-the-national-collegiate-athletic-association-as-an/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at\n408-10, we are obliged to once again carefully wade into the\nthicket to disentangle the issues before us. To be thorough, we\nreview the entire proceedings; for the sake of brevity and clarity,\nhowever, we describe in detail only those aspects of the prior\nproceedings immediately relevant to our analysis.\n       On May 23, 1997, following his Spring 1997 semester at\nTemple, Bowers filed a complaint in the United States District\nCourt for the District of New Jersey alleging, inter alia, that the\nNCAA and ACT/Clearinghouse had violated Titles II and III of\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), 42\nU.S.C. §§ 12132, 12182, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), in their treatment of him. After\nthe District Court denied Bowers’ motion for a preliminary\ninjunction, Bowers I, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1451158\"><a href=\"/opinion/1451158/bowers-v-national-collegiate-athletic-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Stat. Ann. §§ 10:5-1 ! 10:5-49.\n       Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, or in the\nalternative, a motion for summary judgment. The District Court\ndismissed the ADA claim against ACT/Clearinghouse because\nthere was no evidence that it owned, leased, or operated a place\nof public accommodation, as required under Title III.4 Bowers\n\n\n       4\n        Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12181 et seq.,\nprohibits discrimination against the disabled in the full and equal\n\n                                11\n\fII, 9 F.

The District Court denied the motion in all other respects.\n        Thereafter, the parties engaged in discovery. Defendants\nthen filed a motion for summary judgment. In a lengthy\npublished opinion dated November 2, 2000, the Court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of ACT/Clearinghouse on Bowers’\nRehabilitation Act claim, finding that the record was clear that\nACT/Clearinghouse did not receive federal funds. Bowers III,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2358432\"><a href=\"/opinion/2358432/bowers-v-national-collegiate-athletic-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The District Court also granted summary\njudgment in favor of ACT/Clearinghouse on Bowers’ breach of\ncontract claim.5 It denied summary judgment in all other\nrespects. In doing so, the Court rejected the argument of\nTemple and the University of Iowa that they had stopped\nrecruiting Bowers for nondiscriminatory reasons, i.e., because\nhe was undersized and not skilled enough to be a Division I\n\n\n\n\nenjoyment of public accommodations, 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a),\nand public transportation services, 42 U.S.C. § 12184(a).\n       5\n        The last remaining claim against ACT/Clearinghouse\nunder the NJLAD was dismissed on August 6, 2001. Bowers\nVII, 151 F. Supp. 2d at 543.\n\n                               12\n\flineman, finding that there were material issues of fact as to why\nthe schools stopped recruiting him. Id. at 512-13.\n        On February 2, 2001, the District Court granted the\nNCAA’s motion for reconsideration and granted summary\njudgment in favor of the NCAA and American International\nCollege on Bowers’ Title III ADA claim. Bowers IV, 130 F.\nSupp. 2d 610. The Court concluded that Bowers was not\nentitled to injunctive relief because NCAA rules permitted\npartial qualifiers to gain a fourth year of eligibility.6 As a result,\nsince Bowers no longer had standing to seek injunctive relief –\nthe only form of relief available under Title III – the Court\ndismissed his claim. Id. at 614.7 A few days later, the District\nCourt issued an opinion and order allowing Bowers to file a\nsecond amended complaint to: (1) clarify that he sought non-\ninjunctive relief against Temple and the University of Iowa\nunder the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA; and (2) to add three\nstate law claims against the University of Iowa for promissory\nestoppel, equitable estoppel, and fraud. Bowers V, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1850089</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3. The claims against the University of Iowa were\n\n\n       6\n        Consequently, Bowers’ period of potential eligibility\nwas not any shorter than the period would have been had he\nbeen deemed an initial qualifier. Bowers’ inability to gain a\nfourth year of eligibility was the sole basis upon which the\nDistrict Court had previously determined that Bowers had\nstanding to seek injunctive relief. Id. at 614.\n       7\n       The Court also dismissed any claims for injunctive relief\nthat Bowers could otherwise assert against the Defendants under\nthe Rehabilitation Act. Id.\n\n                                 13\n\fpermitted to be added without prejudice to enable the University\nto develop an evidentiary record to support its argument that it\nwas an “arm of the state” and thus entitled to Eleventh\nAmendment immunity. Following that discovery, on July 3,\n2001, the District Court issued a decision finding that the\nUniversity of Iowa was not an arm of the state and not entitled\nto sovereign immunity. Bowers VI, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1772801</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n       Another matter had arisen in the case involving third-\nparty contribution. After the District Court’s November 2000\nsummary judgment order, Temple filed a third-party complaint\nseeking contribution for any monetary liability it might have to\nBowers from Delaware State University (“Delaware State”),\nUniversity of Massachusetts-Amherst (“UMass-Amherst”), and\nUniversity of Memphis (“Memphis”), schools that also had\nallegedly recruited Bowers. The third-party defendants brought\nmotions to dismiss the complaint, arguing: (1) neither Title II\nof the ADA nor Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\ncontemplate an award for contribution; (2) the universities had\nEleventh Amendment immunity; and (3) Congress’s purported\nabrogation and waiver of immunity in Title II of the ADA was\nunconstitutional.\n       On November 7, 2001, the District Court ruled on the\nthird-party motions. Bowers VIII, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2488335\"><a href=\"/opinion/2488335/bowers-v-national-collegiate-athletic-assn-act/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. It\ngranted in part and denied in part Memphis’s motion, finding\nthat Memphis was an arm of the State of Tennessee for Eleventh\nAmendment purposes and so Temple’s contribution claim under\nthe NJLAD state law claim against Memphis was barred by the\ndoctrine of sovereign immunity. However, as to the federal\nclaims, it found (1) there is a right of contribution under Title II\nof the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,\n\n                                14\n\f(2) Congress validly abrogated Tennessee’s Eleventh\nAmendment immunity under Title II of the ADA, and\n(3) Tennessee waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity under\nthe Rehabilitation Act by accepting federal funds. The District\nCourt did not make any other dispositive rulings on Eleventh\nAmendment issues, but instead ordered UMass-Amherst and\nDelaware State to submit additional briefing on these issues and\ngranted Temple an opportunity to reply to this briefing.\n        Following briefing, the District Court subsequently held\nthat: (1) Eleventh Amendment immunity barred Temple’s\nclaims for contribution against UMass-Amherst pursuant to\nNJLAD; (2) UMass-Amherst was not immune from contribution\nclaims asserted under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act;\n(3) dismissal without prejudice was warranted with respect to\nclaims for contribution under the NJLAD against Delaware\nState; (4) a stay pending Memphis’s appeal from denial of\nsovereign immunity defenses was mandated; and (5) a\ncertification for immediate, interlocutory appeal was warranted\nwith respect to the Court’s determination that a general right of\ncontribution existed under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.\nBowers IX, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2577028\"><a href=\"/opinion/2577028/bowers-v-national-collegiate-athletic-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n        On appeal, we did not reach the Eleventh Amendment\nissue, but rather concluded that there was not a right to\ncontribution under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and\nTitle II of the ADA. 346 F.3d at 433. Even more importantly,\nfor purposes of our present appeal, we rejected the University of\nIowa’s argument that we had pendent appellate jurisdiction to\nconsider its untimely appeal of the District Court’s Eleventh\nAmendment ruling. Id. at 412. We noted, however, that we\nlikely would have to consider the Eleventh Amendment\n\n                               15\n\fargument eventually, but not until after a final judgment. Id.\nn.8.\n        The District Court had stayed all matters while the case\nwas on appeal.8 When the case returned from appeal, the parties\nthereafter engaged in further discovery heading toward a\ncontemplated October 2004 trial date. On May 3, 2004, the\nparties entered into a confidentiality stipulation and protective\norder for plaintiff to disclose Michael Bowers’ medical records.9\nOn May 11, 2004, the scheduled date of Kathleen Bowers’\ndeposition, attorneys for Bowers provided to Defendants for the\nfirst time some of Michael Bowers’ medical records. Because\nthese records showed for the first time that he had a preexisting\ndrug condition that was not disclosed to Defendants, the District\nCourt entered a series of orders directing Michael Bowers’\nmedical providers to release all of his medical records. Upon\nrelease of these records, the full extent of Bowers’ substance\nabuse and substance abuse treatment became apparent.\n\n\n       8\n         During that period, two significant events occurred.\nFirst, as already related, Michael Bowers died on June 2, 2002,\nas a result of an apparent cocaine and heroin overdose. This was\nthe first indication to Defendants that Bowers had any kind of\ndrug problem. Second, the original district judge retired from\nthe bench. The case was reassigned to District Judge Simandle,\nwho inherited the procedural morass at the eleventh hour and\nwas confronted with the difficult question of how to deal with\nthe consequences of Bowers’ non-disclosures.\n       9\n       At this point in the dispute, the NCAA, Temple, and the\nUniversity of Iowa remained as Defendants.\n\n                               16\n\fThereafter, on October 15, 2004, Temple moved for sanctions,\narguing that the case should be dismissed with prejudice as a\nsanction for Bowers’ concealment of substance abuse and\nsubstance abuse treatment. It also moved for summary\njudgment, arguing that Bowers was not a qualified individual\nwith a disability as a result of his drug use. The NCAA and the\nUniversity of Iowa joined the motions.\n       The parties did not dispute that Bowers and attorneys for\nBowers had failed to disclose information regarding Michael\nBowers’ substance abuse and his depression to Defendants until\nMay 2004, nearly two years following his death. However,\nattorneys for Bowers argued that the discovery requests were\nnarrow and they were therefore not required to seasonably\namend them under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(e)(2) to\ndisclose treatment for alcoholism or depression. The District\nCourt rejected this argument, and determined that Bowers’\nfailure to disclose the information in a timely fashion was a\nwillful one, in bad faith, and that it irreparably prejudiced\nTemple’s ability to prepare a defense to Bowers’ claims.\nBowers X, No. 97-2600 (D.N.J. March 21, 2005).\n       The District Court further concluded that evidence of\nMichael Bowers’ drug use was relevant not only to the issue of\ndamages, but also to questions of liability. Consequently, the\nDistrict Court entered a sanctions order pursuant to Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure 37(c)(1) and 37(b)(2)(B). This\nsanctions order impaired Bowers’ case in critical fashion. First,\nit precluded her from using any previously concealed\ninformation to support her claim that Defendants were liable for\nMichael Bowers’ drug abuse and depression. Second, they\nprecluded her from opposing Defendants’ claim that Michael\n\n                               17\n\fBowers’ drug abuse rendered him unqualified to participate in\nintercollegiate athletics at all relevant times, which as a practical\nmatter meant Defendants would be immune from liability.10 See\nOrder granting Motion for Joinder, granting Motion for\nSanctions & granting Motion for Summary Judgment,\nNo. 97-2600 (Simandle, J.) (March 21, 2005).\n       The District Court then considered Temple’s renewed\nmotion for summary judgment in light of the sanctions it\nimposed and concluded that Bowers was not a “qualified\nindividual with a disability” under the ADA nor “otherwise\nqualified” under the Rehabilitation Act because his “drug use\nmade him ineligible to compete for Temple or any other\nschool.” Bowers X, No. 97-2600, at 37-38. The Court granted\nthe motion for joinder of the remaining Defendants and\ndismissed Bowers’ case against all Defendants. The District\nCourt did not reach the University of Iowa’s motion for\nreconsideration on Eleventh Amendment grounds, dismissing\nthe claim as moot.\n      Four parties filed timely appeals. Bowers filed an appeal\nfrom: (1) the March 21, 2005 Order granting defendant\nTemple’s motion for sanctions against Bowers and Defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment; and (2) the June 8, 1998 order\n\n       10\n          To bring a claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must\ndemonstrate she was “otherwise qualified” at the time of the\nallegedly unlawful discrimination. By precluding her from\nchallenging Defendants’ assertion that Michael Bowers was\n“unqualified” at the time of the allegedly unlawful\ndiscrimination, the sanctions thus effectively crippled Bowers’\nability to establish a necessary element of her claim.\n\n                                 18\n\fwhich dismissed with prejudice her Sherman Act claims with\nrespect to all Defendants.11 Bowers’ attorneys, Barbara E.\nRansom and Richard L. Bazelon, each separately filed an appeal\nfrom the sanctions portion of the March 21, 2005 order. Finally,\nthe University of Iowa filed a cross-appeal from: (1) the\nMarch 21, 2005 order of the District Court dismissing as moot\nits renewed motion for summary judgment based on sovereign\n\n\n       11\n         Bowers has waived this portion of her appeal, failing to\nformally present or even mention in passing the District Court’s\ndismissal of her Sherman Act claims as an issue in her brief.\nSee Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28; see also Canady v.\nCrestar Mortgage Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"738517\"><a href=\"/opinion/738517/johnnie-a-canady-nancy-canady-v-crestar-mortgage-corporation-johnnie-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">969</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 973-74 (4th Cir. 1997)\n(finding issue specified in notice of appeal but not mentioned in\nappellate brief was deemed waived); Williams v.

Id. at 499\n(“Bowers has . . . sued Temple University, the University of\nIowa, and American International College for discrimination on\nthe ground that these schools stopped recruiting Bowers to play\nfootball when they concluded that his learning disability would\nlikely result in the NCAA declaring him a non-qualifier.”); id.\n(“Bowers alleges that the NCAA discriminated against him\nbecause of his disability in declaring him ineligible to participate\nin intercollegiate athletics as a college freshman.”).\n        Situating Bowers’ claims in Fall 1995-96 and taking all\nreasonable inferences in Bowers’ favor as the nonmoving party,\nwe find there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\nBowers was a “qualified individual with a disability” or\n“otherwise qualified,” under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act,\nrespectively. Furthermore, Michael Bowers’ drug abuse does\nnot preclude Bowers’ claims. The evidence of any substance\nabuse in 1995-96 is minimal. Bowers apparently tried marijuana\nfor the first time in 1991 at age 13 but appeared to use the drug\ninfrequently. His last reported marijuana use was in July 1998,\nat which point he reported he had shared a “joint” five times\n\n\n\noccurred in 1995-1996, when under the NCAA rules Bowers\nwas deemed a ‘non-qualifier.’”) (emphasis in original).\n\n                                22\n\fover the past year.14 There is no evidence that Bowers was\ntaking any other illicit drugs in 1995-96. Bowers told\ncounselors at Seabrook House that drugs did not become a\nproblem for him until 1998. Dr. Carol Roberts, an expert\nretained by Bowers, stated in her report that: “In describing his\nown plunge into depression and addiction, Michael told me that\nin high school he had stayed away from drugs because he\nneeded to be in top physical condition to play sports. He\ngraduated in 1996, and at the end of 1998 while he was at\nTemple, he tried snorting cocaine with a friend.” The record\ndoes indicate that Bowers began taking painkillers in Fall 1996.\nHowever, while Bowers acknowledged that he eventually\nbecame addicted to these painkillers, he began taking them on\nprescription, and after he was already denied initial eligibility\nand after recruiting efforts has ceased. Furthermore, there is no\nindication that he would have failed an NCAA drug test for\ningesting prescription drugs. See NCAA policy 31.2.3.2.\n       All of the substance abuse evidence cited by the District\nCourt, with the exception of the inconclusive marijuana-use\nevidence, pertained to the use of those substances after 1995-96,\nat which point Bowers’ substance abuse was irrelevant for\npurposes of establishing liability in this case.

Therefore, in\norder to review this finding, it will be necessary to revisit the\nhistory of Bowers’ substance abuse and depression treatment.\nAs the District Court correctly perceived, “the history of\nPlaintiff's drug use is complex and convoluted but nevertheless\ncentral to the issues [in this case].” Bowers X, No. 97-2600, at\n9.\n        Bowers tried marijuana for the first time in 1991 at age\n13. It is unclear from the record how often he used it thereafter,\nbut his last reported use, as already stated, infra, was in July\n1998, at which point his use of that substance appeared to be\nintermittent. Between September 1996 and March 1997, after\nhurting his back lifting weights, Bowers was prescribed at least\nnineteen different painkillers, including Percocet, Hydrocodone,\nand Tylenol with codeine, to which he would eventually become\naddicted. By August 1998, Bowers had begun using heroin and\ncocaine. Approximately two months later, in October of the\nsame year, he first began to seek help for his substance abuse,\nentering an intensive two-week inpatient drug rehabilitation\nprogram at Seabrook House. Located in Bridgeton, New Jersey,\nSeabrook House is a prominent inpatient drug and alcohol\nrehabilitation center.\n\n\n      respect incomplete or incorrect and if the\n      additional or corrective information has not\n      otherwise been made known to the other parties\n      during the discovery process or in writing.\nFed. R. of Civ. P. 26(e).\n\n                               27\n\f        Following his inpatient program at Seabrook House,\nBowers attended a daily outpatient drug treatment program, also\nadministered by Seabrook House at a separate facility in Cherry\nHill, N.J.. This program included therapy sessions with a non-\nphysician drug counselor and a drug treatment program with a\nphysician, Dr. Lance Gooberman, who, from June 4, 1999 until\nBowers’ death, treated him for his drug addiction with an\nexperimental drug treatment program. Bowers also received\ninpatient treatment at Rancocas Hospital for bipolar disorder and\npolysubstance abuse from November 5, 1999 to November 26,\n1999. In addition, Dr. Alan Rosenweig treated Bowers for\ndepression and anxiety from December 7, 1999 to May 29,\n2001, during which time Bowers was hospitalized after\nattempting to commit suicide. Bowers then underwent inpatient\ndrug treatment on at least two more occasions at two separate\nfacilities – at Bergen Regional Medical Center from March 10,\n2000 to March 14, 2000, and at Zurbrugg Hospital in October\n2000, followed by daily outpatient treatment from October 2000\nuntil December 2001.\n       On August 7, 1998, Defendants served a set of\ninterrogatories on Bowers, including Interrogatory 15, which\nasked Bowers to “[i]dentify all physicians or physical therapists\nwho have treated or evaluated you from September 1, 1996\nthrough the present date” and to “describe in detail the reason\nfor that treatment.” On October 28, 1998, in response to\nInterrogatory 15, Bowers identified two physicians who treated\nhim during that time frame: Dr. Zeon Switenko (his family\nphysician) and Dr. Benjamin Smolenski (an orthopedist).\nBowers, who had just completed his two-week inpatient stay at\nSeabrook, did not mention that stay or indicate that any\nphysicians treated him during his time there. Nor did he\n\n                               28\n\fsupplement his answer to Interrogatory 15 at any time\nthroughout the course of the litigation to reference, at the very\nleast, Drs. Gooberman and Rosenweig.17\n        Interrogatory 19 of the August 7, 1998 interrogatories\nrequested that Bowers, “with respect to damages . . . describe in\ndetail each element of that relief; state all facts that provide the\nbasis of that relief, including the amount, if any; and identify all\ndocuments relating or referring to each component of that relief,\n. . . and identify every individual with knowledge of the facts\nrelating to those alleged damages or other relief.” Bowers\nresponded to Interrogatory 19 (under an objection), stating that\nhe sought consequential damages for loss of scholarship and loss\nof career opportunities in the amount of $150,000.00, and\ncompensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional\ndistress in the amount of $500,000.00. Additionally, Bowers\nstated that he could not compute punitive damages at that stage\nin the discovery process. Bowers did not identify any of the\nphysicians who had treated him as “individuals with knowledge\nof the facts relating to those alleged damages or other relief.”\nDefendants’ First Request for Production of Documents also\nserved on August 7, 1998, requested that Bowers produce “[a]ll\ndocuments identified in your answers to the interrogatories of all\ndefendants in this litigation.” Bowers did not produce any\ndocuments related to his treatment for substance abuse.\n\n\n       17\n         The standard instructions to the interrogatories stated\nthat the interrogatories were “continuing and any information\nsecured subsequent to the filing of [the] answers, which would\nhave been includable in the answers had it been known or\navailable, is to be supplied by supplemental answers.”\n\n                                29\n\f        Bowers testified at his November 30, 1998 deposition\nthat he became depressed after he was denied initial eligibility\nby ACT/Clearinghouse, and that he was prescribed two\nantidepressant medications by his physician, Dr. Switenko.\nBowers was then asked: “Other than Dr. Switenko has any\nother physician treated you for depression?” Bowers answered\n“No.” He was then asked if he had “ever seen another physician\nother than Dr. Switenko for treatment of anxiety?” Bowers\nanswered “No” to that question as well. At his January 11, 1999\ndeposition, Bowers also denied receiving any treatment for\ndepression since November 1998. Bowers did not disclose his\nstay at Seabrook or any subsequent treatment. Bowers also\ntestified in his March 1999 deposition that he was unaware why\nhe did not take any exams in the Fall 1998 semester, despite the\nfact that he had been recently discharged from inpatient drug\ntreatment at Seabrook.\n        As already stated, Defendants claim that Bowers willfully\nfailed to comply with discovery requests in violation of Rule\n26(e). Important to note, however, is that the discovery requests\nin this case did not request information regarding Bowers’ drug\nand alcohol addiction. Neither did Defendants make any\nexplicit request for Bowers’ medical records until March 15,\n2004. Consequently, we believe there is some merit to Bowers’\nargument that she had no duty to turn over that information prior\nto an explicit request. We recognize that modern discovery\nrules, particularly Rules 26 and 37, were enacted to prevent civil\ntrials in the federal courts from being “carried on in the dark.”\nHickman v.

Bowers did not\ndisclose any of the doctors that treated him at Seabrook, Bergen\nRegional Medical Center, or Zurbrugg Hospital. Nor did he\ndisclose that he had been treated by Drs. Gooberman and\nRosenweig. It is simply inconceivable that Bowers and counsel\nfor Bowers could not have recognized their obligation to\ndisclose treatment by these physicians given the clarity of\nDefendants’ discovery request for the information on “all\nphysicians.”\n       Moreover, the disclosure of this treatment clearly would\nhave led to discoverable information. It is virtually certain that\nDefendants would have learned of Bowers’ drug use had he\ndisclosed his treatment with Dr. Gooberman. Dr. Gooberman\nwas well-known for prescribing a controversial subcutaneous\n“pellet treatment” program for patients suffering from severe\nheroin addictions. In fact, Gooberman’s office letterhead states\nclearly that he specializes in “addiction medicine.” While\nBowers is correct that Defendants did not explicitly ask for\nmedical records or information about possible drug addiction,\n\n                               31\n\fhad Bowers complied with her discovery obligations,\nDefendants might have learned about Bowers’ drug use as early\nas October 1998. Indeed, following that crucial thread of\ninformation, Defendants would have been able to uncover\nBowers’ past drug use prior to his death and depose him on the\nsubject.18 Instead, that opportunity eluded them for four years\nas Bowers failed to disclose his course of substance abuse\ntreatment with multiple physicians. Allowing any information\nregarding Bowers’ substance abuse to be introduced\nposthumously by Bowers for her own advantage would thus be\npatently unfair to Defendants, who were clearly blind-sided by\nthat evidence. As a result, we find the District Court did not\nabuse its discretion in issuing preclusion sanctions with respect\nto Bowers’ drug use.\n        However, we find it was an abuse of discretion for the\nDistrict Court to preclude Bowers from introducing any\nevidence of his depression. Unlike Bowers’ drug problems,\nwhich would have been readily revealed had he disclosed his\ntreatment with Dr. Gooberman, Defendants were not blind-sided\nby evidence that Bowers had suffered from depression. Bowers\nwas forthright about his depression from the outset. Bowers’\ninitial Rule 26 disclosures requested “punitive damages for the\n\n\n       18\n         We reluctantly agree with Bowers that there is scant\nevidence in the record as to whether Michael Bowers was\ntreated by any physicians at Seabrook, Bergen Medical Center,\nor Zurbrugg Hospital. However, we find it difficult to imagine\nthat Bowers was not treated by a single physician during his\nmultiple inpatient hospital stays, including one for an attempted\nsuicide.\n\n                               32\n\fpain and suffering that [sic] the trauma of not being able to\nachieve his goal to play college football and the advantages that\nensue therefrom . . . .” Bowers responded to Defendants’\ninterrogatory requests that he sought consequential damages\nfrom loss of scholarship and career opportunities in the amount\nof $150,000.00, and compensatory damages for pain and\nsuffering and emotional distress in the amount of $500,000.00.\nTemple recognized this damage claim to be based upon Bowers’\ndepression, noting that in Bowers’ Rule 26 disclosures\n“[p]rincipally, he claimed to have been suffering from\ndepression.” Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. for Sanctions of\nDef.

Br. for Appellees at 14 (“Bowers\nlimited his emotional distress claims solely to depression from\nnot being able to play NCAA Division I football.”). Defendants\nalso recognized in their consolidated brief that they had\n“focused on [Bowers’] claim of depression during his\nJanuary 11, 1999 deposition,” and that “depression was the only\nemotional harm he identified under repeated questioning.” Id.\nat 15, 18.\n       While Bowers’ depression certainly may have become\naggravated by and intertwined with his drug abuse at some\npoint, we believe the two can be disentangled for purposes of\nestablishing damages in this case. Indeed, Bowers’ depression\nhas been a centerpiece of his claims for damages from the\ninception of this case, long before the clear onset of any\nsubstance abuse problems. Consequently, we conclude the\nDistrict Court’s blanket preclusion of evidence related to\ndepression reflects a “clearly erroneous assessment of the\nevidence in record” and was thus an abuse of discretion. Cooter\n\n                               33\n\f& Gell, 496 U.S. at 405. We will therefore affirm the sanctions\norder of the District Court only insofar as it precludes Bowers,\nin proving damages, from using evidence of his drug abuse and\ndrug abuse-related depression.\n        Furthermore, we reverse the sanctions order insofar as it\nprecludes Bowers from opposing Defendants’ claim that\nMichael Bowers’ drug abuse rendered him unqualified to\nparticipate in a program of intercollegiate athletics at all relevant\ntimes. That aspect of the sanctions order, again, reflects a\nfailure on the part of the District Court to correctly focus on the\ntime frame of 1995-96 as the relevant time period for evaluating\nthe claims in this case. As elaborated more fully in our\ndiscussion of the District Court’s summary judgment analysis,\ninfra Part II.A, 1995-96 is the time period in which the NCAA\nallegedly unlawfully discriminated against Bowers by denying\nhim initial eligibility. This is also the time period during which\nBowers alleges the university Defendants participated in that\nallegedly unlawful discrimination. This is therefore the relevant\ntime frame for purposes of establishing liability.\n        The District Court’s failure to focus on this period led to\na clearly erroneous assessment of the relevance of Bowers’ post-\n1995-96 drug abuse and concealment of that abuse. The Court\nconcluded that “evidence of record thus shows that Michael\nBowers’ pattern of substance abuse involving painkillers, heroin\nand other drugs, originally hidden, precluded his participation in\nintercollegiate athletics at all relevant times.” Bowers X, No.\n97-2600, at 41. However, at the relevant time for purposes of\nestablishing Defendants’ liability, 1995-96, the record is devoid\nof any evidence that Bowers was addicted to painkillers or had\nbegun using cocaine and heroin. There is no evidence that this\n\n                                 34\n\fdrug abuse began until after the relevant time period – after\nBowers had been denied initial eligibility and after the\nuniversity Defendants had stopped recruiting him.19 Thus, the\nDistrict Court’s conclusion that Bowers’ drug abuse was\nrelevant to the issue of liability is clearly erroneous and we\nreverse that part of its order precluding Bowers from opposing\nDefendants’ claim that Michael Bowers’ drug abuse rendered\nhim presumptively unqualified in Fall 1995-96.\nC.     Separate Appeal of Attorneys for Bowers with Respect\n       to Sanctions Order\n       As a threshold matter, we must determine whether\nattorneys for Bowers have standing to appeal the sanctions order\nin this case.

In similar cases, courts have concluded that express\nfindings that a party violated a particular rule of civil procedure\nconstituted a sanction. See Young, 404 F.3d at 38 (finding\nsanction where the district court stated that attorney violated\nRule 11); Precision Specialty Metals, Inc., 315 F.3d at 1352-53\n(same); Butler, 348 F.3d at 1168 (explicit finding that attorney\nviolated state ethical rule was a sanction); Talao, 222 F.3d at\n1138 (same); Walker, 129 F.3d at 832 (same). The order here\nclearly rose above mere judicial criticism. The District Court\nconcluded not only that the attorneys violated Rule 26(e), but\n\n                                39\n\falso entered a public reprimand by explicitly granting the\nsanctions motion against Bowers’ attorneys. For these reasons,\nwe agree with attorneys for Bowers that the sanctions order in\nthis case is an appealable order.\n        We also agree that the District Court violated the\nprocedural due process rights of attorneys for Bowers in this\ncase. “Whenever the district court imposes sanctions on an\nattorney, it must at a minimum, afford the attorney notice and\nopportunity to be heard.” Weissman, 179 F.3d at 1198 (finding\nthat the district court violated attorney’s due process rights by\nfailing to give him notice and an opportunity to be heard prior\nto sanctioning him); see also In re Ruffalo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107654\"><a href=\"/opinion/107654/in-re-ruffalo/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 550\n(1968) (stating that attorneys subject to disciplinary proceedings\nare entitled to procedural due process protections, including fair\nnotice of charges). It is clear that attorneys for Bowers had no\nnotice whatsoever that the District Court was contemplating\nentering sanctions against them prior to the hearing on Temple’s\nmotion. Temple’s original sanctions motion requested sanctions\nagainst plaintiff, not plaintiff’s counsel,21 and the purpose of the\nhearing was to determine whether sanctions imposed against\nplaintiff were warranted. Until the District Court’s opinion and\norder was filed, attorneys for Bowers had no idea that the Court\nwas even considering levying sanctions against them. Under\nthese facts, the District Court violated these attorneys’ rights to\nprocedural due process.\n       Accordingly, we reverse the sanctions order of the\nDistrict Court issued against attorneys for Bowers and remand\n\n       21\n         The sanctions motion stated that Temple “hereby moves\nfor sanctions against plaintiff Kathleen Bowers.”\n\n                                40\n\fto give the attorneys an opportunity to be heard before any\nfurther sanction is entered.\nD.     The University of Iowa’s Eleventh Amendment\n       Sovereign Immunity Challenge22\n        At the outset, we must state that it is clear that the\nUniversity of Iowa is not entitled to Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity as to its Rehabilitation Act claims. The University of\nIowa’s argument with respect to that claim has been foreclosed\nby our decision in Koslow v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778995\"><a href=\"/opinion/778995/george-koslow-v-commonwealth-of-pennsylvania-dba-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168-76 (3d Cir. 2002), in which we held that a\nstate program or activity that accepts federal funds waives its\nEleventh Amendment immunity to Rehabilitation Act claims.\nIn this case, the University of Iowa clearly “concedes it and its\nstudents receive federal funds for purposes of Section 504.” Br.\n\n       22\n         We should clarify that Temple does not raise this issue.\nWe also note that in our previous dismissal of the University of\nIowa’s appeal from the District Court’s order of July 3, 2001,\nwe reserved judgment on the University of Iowa’s immunity\nclaims. Bowers v. NCAA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783836\"><a href=\"/opinion/783836/michael-bowers-v-the-national-collegiate-athletic-association-as-an/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 412 n.8 (3d Cir. 2003).\nSpecifically, we recognized that “depending on the future course\nof this litigation we may have to entertain Iowa’s Eleventh\nAmendment arguments following final judgment.” Id.

However, as the District Court’s opinion and order\nof March 21, 2005, did not address the University of Iowa’s\nsovereign immunity claim on the merits, we consider the Court’s\nJuly 3, 2001 decision on the merits as a touchstone for our own\nanalysis.\n\n                               41\n\ffor Appellee/Cross Appellant University of Iowa at 6. Thus,\neven if the University is an arm of the state, it has waived its\nEleventh Amendment immunity for Rehabilitation Act claims,\nand Bowers’ Rehabilitation Act claim will remain. As a result,\nwe will focus our analysis on the issue of whether the University\nof Iowa is an “arm of the state” of Iowa for the remaining state\nlaw claims and the Title II ADA claim.\n        The Eleventh Amendment to the United States\nConstitution provides: “The Judicial power of the United States\nshall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,\ncommenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by\nCitizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any\nForeign State.” U.S. Const. amend.

The State of Iowa is not obligated to pay a\n              judgment against the University\n        The funding prong of Fitchik requires us to determine\nwhether the payment of any judgment against the University of\nIowa would come from the public treasury of the State of Iowa,\ni.e., whether the State is legally liable to pay the judgment. See\nRegents of the Univ. of Ca. v. Doe, 519 U.S. at 431.

The appropriate question to ask,\nhowever, is whether the State is obligated to pay or reimburse\nthe University for its debts. See, e.g., Hess v.

As we recently explained in Febres in rejecting\na similar indirect liability argument, if a State is not under a\nlegal obligation to satisfy a judgment, then any increase in\nexpenditures in the face of an adverse judgment is considered a\nvoluntary or discretionary subsidy not entitled to Eleventh\nAmendment protections. Febres, 445 F.3d at 234. See also\nFitchik, 873 F.2d at 661 (noting that New Jersey law provided\nthat any increase in transit agency’s state appropriation as a\nresult of a judgment against the agency was deemed\ndiscretionary action by the State); Kovats, 822 F.2d at 1309\n(stating that under state law, Rutgers retained sole discretion\n\n\n\n\n                                45\n\fover its accounts and New Jersey law explicitly insulated itself\nfrom any liability on obligations running against Rutgers).26\n        The University of Iowa argued before the District Court\nthat Iowa Code § 8.32 demonstrates that the State of Iowa is\nobligated to pay for any outlay of funds necessary to pay\nBowers’ judgment. That section states that “[a]ll appropriations\nmade to any department or establishment of the government as\nreceive or collect moneys available for expenditure by them\nunder present laws, are declared to be in addition to such\nrepayment receipts, and such appropriations are to be available\nas and to the extent that such receipts are insufficient to meet the\ncosts of administration, operation, and maintenance, or public\nimprovements of such departments.” Iowa Code § 8.32.\nTranslating this code into plainer English, the University of\nIowa has argued that § 8.32 merely reveals that state\nappropriations are available to meet expenditures when the\nreceipts are insufficient. The District Court, however,\ndetermined that the code section does “not reveal an obligation\non the part of the state beyond that which has already been\nappropriated” because the section “merely establishes that the\n\n\n       26\n         Our focus can be distinguished from Brine v.

We find that\ninterpretation is plausible, although the code section is not\nentirely clear. However, we do not believe any further tortured\nparsing of the language of § 8.32 will be productive and we\nresist “convert[ing] the inquiry into a formalistic question of\nultimate financial liability.” Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Doe,\n519 U.S. at 431.\n       Therefore, while we find the first Fitchik funding factor\nmay tilt the scale against immunity because statutory language\ndoes not clearly obligate the State of Iowa to pay the\nUniversity’s debts, it is certainly not dispositive of the ultimate\noutcome in our analysis.\n       2.      The University is considered an arm of the state\n               under Iowa state law\n        The second Fitchik factor requires that we focus on\nwhether the State itself considers the entity an arm of the state.\nUnder the second factor, we look to how state law treats the\nentity generally; whether the entity can sue or be sued in its own\nright, whether the entity is separately incorporated, and whether\nthe entity is immune from state taxation. Febres, 445 F.3d at\n230.\n        This second factor clearly weighs in favor of immunity.\nThe University was created under the Iowa state constitution, it\nis the only constitutionally created university in the State, and it\n\n\n\n\n                                47\n\fhas not been separately incorporated by the State.27 The Iowa\nConstitution further provides that the “educational and school\nfunds and lands[] shall be under the control and management of\nthe General Assembly of this State.” Iowa Const.

Compare Febres, 445\nF.3d at 233 (noting that N.J. state law generally treated school\nboards as separate political subdivisions) with Benn, 426 F.3d at\n233 (stating that under the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s\ninterpretation of the state constitution, county judicial districts\nare state entities).\n       In addition, although the University may bring suit in its\nown name, it may do so only through the State Attorney\nGeneral’s Office, which also is obligated to defend the\nUniversity from suit. Iowa Code § 13.2. Furthermore, unlike\nNew Jersey’s tort claims act, which applies to New Jersey\ncounties and municipalities as well, see Fitchik, 873 F.2d at 663,\nIowa has separate tort claims acts for the State (Iowa Code ch.\n699) and political subdivisions (Iowa Code ch. 670).\n\n\n\n       27\n         Article IX, Section 11 of the Iowa Constitution states\nthat “The State University shall be established at one place\nwithout branches at any other place, and the University fund\nshall be applied to that Institution and no else.” Iowa Const.\nArt. IX, § 11.\n\n                                48\n\f       These facts sufficiently establish that the University of\nIowa is considered an arm of the state by the State of Iowa.\n       3.     The University’s autonomy is constrained by state\n              authority\n        The final Fitchik factor focuses on the degree of\nindependence from state control an entity exercises. The Board\nof Regents of the University of Iowa is tightly constrained by\nstate authority. The Board of Regents, which governs the\nUniversity of Iowa and all other state universities, consists of\nnine members, each appointed by the governor for a six-year\nterm (with the restriction that no more than five may be from the\nsame political party). Iowa Code. § 262.1, .2, .7. The governor\nof Iowa is entitled to remove a member of the board for cause\nwith the approval of a majority of the senate, Iowa Code\n§ 262.5, and the governor may suspend a board member when\nthe general assembly is not in session. Iowa Code § 262.5.\nBoard expenses are reimbursed by the state director of revenue,\nIowa Code § 262.29, who must report to the governor the\namount paid in services and expenses of officers and employees\nof the board. Iowa Code § 262.22. The Board’s powers are\nfurther regulated by Iowa Code § 262.9, which governs, inter\nalia, the Board’s procurement specifications of certain types of\nmaterials (e.g., the department of natural resources must review\nthe Board’s procurement specifications to ensure that the Board\npurchases recyclable materials and soybean-based inks), the\nUniversity’s acquisition and disposal of real estate, the\nUniversity’s ability to accept and administer trusts, and the\nnumber of University meetings and locations that may be held.\nThe Board may only acquire or transfer real estate with the\napproval of the State Executive Council, which consists of the\n\n                               49\n\fGovernor, State Auditor, State Treasurer, Secretary of State, and\nSecretary of Agriculture. Iowa Code § 262.9(7). Contra\nFitchik, 873 F.2d at 663 (noting that under New Jersey law the\nNew Jersey Transit was able to purchase and sell property\nwithout any state governmental oversight). The Board is\nauthorized to secure patents and copyrights from students,\ninstructors and officials, but they must become the property of\nthe State. Iowa Code § 262.9(11). Biennially, the Board is\nrequired to give an expenditures report to the governor and the\nlegislature and to submit a biennial budget. Iowa Code\n§ 262.26. In addition, the University is required to hire a budget\nanalyst to serve as a liaison between the State Department of\nManagement and the University in preparing the budget, Iowa\nCode § 8.29, and is required to report monthly expenditures and\nreceipts of funds to the state director of revenue and finance.\n       In light of these facts, is it apparent that the University of\nIowa is tightly controlled by the State of Iowa.28 Therefore, we\nfind the autonomy factor weighs in favor of Eleventh\nAmendment immunity.\n       4.      Weighing the factors\n       Summing up, the first Fitchik factor weighs slightly\nagainst immunity, while the second and third factors weigh\n\n\n       28\n        By contrast, in Kovats, the New Jersey governor had the\npower to appoint some of the board members to Rutgers, and\nthere were only two limitations on the board’s operation of\nUniversity: the board had to comply with (1) state budget\nappropriations; and (2) with state laws and regulations. Kovats,\n822 F.2d at 1312.\n\n                                 50\n\fheavily in favor of immunity. The District Court placed great\nemphasis on the funding prong in accordance with our pre-Doe\njurisprudence. Under current precedent, however, we are\nrequired to consider each of the factors equally when\ndetermining whether an entity is entitled to Eleventh\nAmendment immunity. Benn, 426 F.3d at 233.\n       In this case, we believe the overwhelming degree of state\ninvolvement in the University of Iowa warrants a finding that\nthe University is an arm of the state. While the State of Iowa is\nnot clearly obligated by statute to increase expenditures to the\nUniversity as a result of an adverse judgment, there is a high\ndegree of state involvement in the affairs of the Board of\nRegents and the University in general. In addition, under Iowa\nlaw the University is clearly considered an arm of the State.\nAccordingly, we find that the University of Iowa is entitled to\nEleventh Amendment immunity with respect to Bowers’ state\nlaw tort claims.\nE.     Congress validly abrogated Eleventh Amendment\n       immunity under Title II of the Americans with\n       Disabilities Act.\n        Having determined that the University of Iowa is entitled\nto sovereign immunity, we are required to consider the\napplicability of that doctrine to Title II of the ADA. The United\nStates, as intervenor, reminds us that judicial restraint requires\nus to “avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the\nnecessity of deciding them.” Lyng v. Nw.

In order to avoid\nthe constitutional question in this case, the United States\nsuggests we in effect prune away Bowers’ Title II claim, as\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides nearly identical\n\n                               51\n\fprotection.

As our reversal of the District Court’s order of summary\njudgment has revived Bowers’ Title II claim, we are squarely\npresented with the constitutional question regarding that\nstatute’s purported abrogation of sovereign immunity. Thus,\nprudential concerns notwithstanding, we feel obliged to enter the\nfray. Ashwander v.

The first prong of this test is easily satisfied\nin this case, as Title II of the ADA provides that “[a] State shall\nnot be immune under the eleventh amendment to the\nConstitution of the United States from an action in [a] Federal\nor State court of competent jurisdiction for a violation.” 42\nU.S.C. § 12101(b)(4); see generally Board of Trustees of Univ.\nof Ala. v.

Lane, 541 U.S. at 520. The key limitation is\nthat Congressional action must not work “a substantial change\nin the governing law.” City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519. In this\nrespect, the Supreme Court has established a “congruence and\nproportionality” test: “Section 5 legislation is valid if it exhibits\n‘a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be\n\n                                 53\n\fprevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.’”\nLane, 541 U.S. at 520 (quoting City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 520).\nThe Court has enacted a three-step inquiry to determine whether\na particular statute satisfies the congruence and proportionality\ntest, which requires the parties to identify: (1) with some\nprecision the constitutional right at issue; (2) whether Congress\nidentified a history and pattern of unconstitutional\ndiscrimination by the States against the disabled; and\n(3) whether the rights and remedies created by the statute are\ncongruent and proportional to the constitutional rights it\npurports to enforce and the record of constitutional violations\nadduced by Congress. Garrett, 531 U.S. at 365, 368, 372-73.\n        For example, the purported abrogation of Title I of the\nADA failed that test in Garrett, in which the Court held that\nthere was not a pattern of constitutional violations with respect\nto public employment. Congressional findings had focused on\ndiscrimination in the private sector, and Title I’s broad remedial\nscheme was insufficiently targeted to remedy unconstitutional\ndiscrimination in public employment. See id. at 368-374. Thus,\nthe Court in Garrett held that the Eleventh Amendment bars\nsuits seeking money damages for state violations of Title I of the\nADA. The Court explicitly left open the question of whether\nsimilar suits could be brought for money damages under Title II\nof the ADA.29\n\n\n       29\n        The Court has also sustained other challenges to overly\nbroad and disproportional legislation that went beyond the scope\nof § 5.

Congress chose a\nlimited remedy to enforce Title II with respect to access to the\ncourts. States are required to take “reasonable measures” to\nremove architectural and other barriers to accessibility, and, in\nthe case of older facilities in which structural changes would be\nmore difficult, states are able to adopt a variety of less costly\nmeasures to ensure access to judicial services. Id. at 532. As a\nresult, the Court concluded that Title II’s affirmative obligation\nto accommodate persons with disabilities in the administration\nof justice was a reasonable prophylactic measure targeted to a\nlegitimate end.\n       Lane, however, revealed disagreement amongst members\nof the Court as to whether Title II may subject States to money\ndamages for conduct that may in fact be constitutional. While\nthe majority opinion recognizes that Congress’s prophylactic\npowers under § 5 may proscribe some conduct that is facially\nconstitutional to “prevent and deter unconstitutional conduct,”\nLane, 541 U.S. at 529, the dissenting Justices forcefully argued\nthat Congress’s § 5 powers extend only to remedy actual\nconstitutional violations. See id. at 547 (Rehnquist, C.J.,\ndissenting), 559 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (“Nothing in § 5 allows\nCongress to go beyond the provisions of the Fourteenth\nAmendment to proscribe, prevent, or “remedy,” conduct that\ndoes not itself violate any provision of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.”) (emphasis in original).

In Georgia,\na disabled inmate in a state prison brought a pro se action under\nTitle II of the ADA seeking money damages. The inmate\nalleged that he was confined within a small cell 23 to 24 hours\nper day, that he was unable to turn his wheelchair around in his\ncell, and that he was not afforded adequate facilities to use the\ntoilet and shower without assistance, which often was denied.\nIn addition, he claimed that he was denied a number of essential\nprison services as a result of his disability. Id. at 879. The\nCourt examined whether Title II of the ADA validly abrogated\nstate sovereign immunity with respect to the inmate’s claims. It\nnoted that the same conduct allegedly established the inmate’s\nclaims under both the Eighth Amendment and Title II. In this\nrespect, the Court agreed that “insofar as Title II creates a\nprivate cause of action for damages against the States for\nconduct that actually violates the Fourteenth Amendment,\nTitle II validly abrogates state sovereign immunity.” Id. at 882\n(emphasis in original). Because it was unclear as to what extent\nthe conduct underlying the inmate’s constitutional claims also\nviolated Title II, the Court ordered the case remanded back to\nthe District Court for the inmate to amend his complaint. Id. at\n882. The Court directed the lower court to (1) identify which\naspects of the State’s alleged conduct violated Title II;\n(2) identify to what extent such misconduct also violated the\nFourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct\nviolated Title II but did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment,\ndetermine whether Congress’s purported abrogation of\nsovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless\nvalid. Id.\n\n\n\n                               57\n\f       Thus, we are required to determine in the first instance if\nany aspect of the University’s alleged conduct forms the basis\nfor a Title II claim.31 In this case, the University allegedly\nviolated Title II when it refused to offer Bowers a scholarship on\nthe basis that he would not meet NCAA initial eligibility\nstandards. Title II prohibits a “qualified individual with a\ndisability” from being “excluded from participation in or be\ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a\npublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such\nentity” because of the individual’s disability. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12132. Bowers argues that the University of Iowa\ndiscriminated against him because of his learning disability: but\nfor the fact that his learning disability precluded him from\ntaking the requisite number of core classes in high school, he\nwould have been given a scholarship by the University. Bowers\nthus essentially states a claim under Title II that he was denied\naccess to a program at a public education institution because of\nhis disability.32\n\n       31\n         In Georgia, the Court remanded to the District Court for\nthis determination. 126 S. Ct. at 882. However, given the\nprocedural posture of this case, we find we are well situated to\nmake this determination ourselves. See Toledo v. Sanchez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202306\"><a href=\"/opinion/202306/toledo-v-sanchez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32 n.2 (1st Cir. 2006) (“[A]s this analysis simply\nrequires a legal determination under the standard set out in Fed.\nR.

Clearly, since the Supreme\nCourt has held that there is no fundamental right to public\neducation, San Antonio Indep. School Dist. v.

See Bowers I, 974 F. Supp.\nat 461 (noting the NCAA’s view that the requirements “are\n\n\ndisability; (3) he was excluded from participation in or denied\nthe benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public\nentity, or was subjected to discrimination by any such entity;\n(4) by reason of his disability.

The NCAA rule – requiring\nstudent athletes to participate in certain basic core classes in\nhigh school – is rationally related to the end it attempts to\nachieve – ensuring that incoming student athletes are prepared\nto balance academics and athletics. The rule does not target\ndisabled individuals per se, but rather also targets those student\nathletes who have failed to satisfy their core course requirements\nfor other reasons, including sheer lack of effort. Consequently,\nthe rule does not create a caste system in which learning\ndisabled students can never qualify as student athletes. See City\nof Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 450 (finding that zoning legislation\nfailed rational basis review because it demonstrated irrational\nprejudice directed solely against the mentally retarded). Thus,\nthe NCAA rule and the university Defendants’ application of\nthat rule do not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. See also\nToledo, 454 F.3d at 33-34 (finding that a university’s actions in\nfailing to accommodate disabled student by allowing him, inter\nalia, to arrive late to class and to extend deadlines for work, did\nnot establish constitutional violations).\n        Having determined that the alleged misconduct in this\ncase states a claim for violation of Title II but not the Fourteenth\nAmendment, we arrive at the final step of Georgia’s tripartite\ntest. This step requires to determine whether Congress’s\npurported abrogation of state sovereign immunity is nevertheless\nvalid.34 The right at issue in this case, as in Lane, is the right to\n\n\n       34\n         As already stated, in making this determination we seek\nto identify: (1) with some precision the constitutional right at\n\n                                 60\n\fbe free from irrational disability discrimination. Lane, 541 U.S.\nat 522. The Court in Lane concluded that Congress had clearly\nidentified a history and pattern of disability discrimination with\nrespect to public services. Id. at 526.35 Therefore there is only\n\n\nissue; (2) whether Congress identified a history and pattern of\nunconstitutional discrimination by the States against the disabled\nwith respect to public services; and (3) whether the rights and\nremedies created by the statute are congruent and proportional\nto the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record\nof constitutional violations adduced by Congress. Garrett, 531\nU.S. at 365, 368, 372-73.\n       35\n         The Court considered evidence of disability\ndiscrimination in a variety of public services, not just limited to\naccess to the courts. See Lane, 541 U.S. at 523-26 (referencing\nvoting, serving as jurors, unjustified commitment, abuse and\nneglect of young persons committed to state mental hospitals,\nand irrational discrimination in zoning decisions). The Court\nconcluded that there was a documented “pattern of unequal\ntreatment in the administration of a wide range of public\nservices, programs, and activities, including the penal system,\npublic education, and voting.” Id. at 525 (emphasis added).\nSubsequent decisions of the courts of appeals have recognized\nthat the second prong of the Boerne test was conclusively\nestablished with respect to Title II by the Lane Court.

In concluding that\nCongress was justified in enacting Title II with respect to public\neducation, the First Circuit stated the following:\n        In sum, the thirty years preceding the enactment\n        of the ADA evidence a widespread pattern of\n        states unconstitutionally excluding disabled\n        children from public education and irrationally\n        discriminating against disabled students within\n        schools. Faced with this record of persistent\n        unconstitutional state action, coupled with the\n        inability of earlier federal legislation to solve this\n        “difficult and intractable problem,” Congress was\n        justified in enacting prophylactic § 5 legislation in\n        response.\n\n                                62\n\fone difficult issue left at this point in the inquiry: the congruence\nand proportionality of Title II with respect to public education.\n        We agree with the United States that “[a]s applied to\neducation, Title II is a congruent and proportional means of\npreventing and remedying the unconstitutional discrimination\nthat Congress found to exist both in education and in other areas\nof governmental services, many of which implicate fundamental\nrights.” Br. for the United States at 36-37. The remedy chosen\nby Congress in Title II in the area of public education is a\nnarrow one: access to education. Qualified individuals with a\ndisability may not be excluded from participating in public\neducation on the basis of their disability. Thus, states are free to\nenact a myriad of laws relating to public education, including\nlaws that may negatively impact disabled students, so long as\nthose laws do not discriminate against students because of their\ndisabilities. Congress enacted Title II against the backdrop of\nour regrettable national history in educating students with\ndisabilities. See infra note 35. As pointed out correctly by the\nUnited States in its brief, our national history in educating\nstudents with disabilities leaves much to be desired. In many\npast instances, States have made educational decisions on the\nbasis of irrational misconceptions and stereotypes held about\ndisabled students. See Gov’ts Br. at 27-32 (documenting\nvarious instances of exclusion and segregation of disabled\nstudents). Given this regrettable past history, Title II is a\njustifiable prophylactic measure to avoid the risk of\nunconstitutional treatment of disabled students.\n\n\n\nToledo, 454 F.3d at 39 (citing Hibbs, 538 U.S. at 735).\n\n                                 63\n\f        Reported cases from the courts of appeals since the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Georgia have likewise found that\nCongressional abrogation of sovereign immunity with respect to\npublic education was valid. As the Fourth Circuit observed in\nConstantine, Congress limited the scope of Title II in several\nrespects. First, the statute only protects “qualified individuals\nwith a disability.” Second, Title II permits States to limit\nparticipation in their programs and activities for all other lawful\nreasons. Third, Title II only requires States to make “reasonable\nmodifications” to accommodate the disabled, thus protecting the\nStates from having to compromise essential eligibility criteria\nfor public programs. Finally, States are able to make available\nother accommodations if structural modifications of physical\nstructures are too burdensome. 411 F.3d at 488-89. For those\nreasons, and against the backdrop of discrimination against\ndisabled students, the Constantine court concluded that Title II\nwas valid legislation as applied to public education. Id. at 490.\nSee also Toledo, 454 F.3d at 40 (“Title II’s prophylactic\nmeasures are justified by the persistent pattern of exclusion and\nirrational treatment of disabled students in public education,\ncoupled with the gravity of the harm worked by such\ndiscrimination.”); Assoc. for Disabled Americans, Inc., 405 F.3d\nat 959 (“Discrimination against disabled students in education\naffects disabled persons’ future ability to exercise and\nparticipate in the most basic rights and responsibilities of\ncitizenship, such as voting and participation in public programs\nand services. The relief available under Title II of the ADA is\ncongruent and proportional to the injury and the means adopted\nto remedy the injury.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                64\n\f       Accordingly, we join several sister circuits in holding that\nCongress acted within its Constitutional authority in abrogating\nsovereign immunity under Title II of the ADA.\n                      III. CONCLUSION\n        We agree with the District Court that this case has\nbecome an ongoing saga. With this opinion, we have\ncontributed yet another episode to the saga, but it has not been\nour intention to thicken the plot. With that in mind, we observe\nthat a central question has yet to be resolved: whether the\nDefendants, in their treatment of Michael Bowers, in fact\nviolated anti-discrimination law. Consequently, we will reverse\nthe order of summary judgment and remand this matter to the\nDistrict Court for treatment in accordance with the rulings stated\nherein.\n\n\n\n\n                                65\n\f</pre>",
