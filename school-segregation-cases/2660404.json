Marchetti for Plaintiffs and Respondents.\n\f       Explorer 1 Ambulance & Medical Services, LLC (Explorer 1) and Sultan\nMohamed (Mohamed) (collectively appellants) appeal from a judgment following a court\ntrial against appellants and in favor of respondents Tayler Kirner (Kirner), Brian Richard\n(Richard), and Damien Stickler (Stickler) (collectively respondents) on respondents’\nclaims against appellants for wage and hour violations.\n       Appellants argue that substantial evidence does not support the trial court’s\ndecisions that Mohamed is Explorer 1’s alter ego and that Kirner and Richard had no\nagreement or understanding to exclude sleep time from 24-hour shifts. In addition,\nappellants argue that the trial court made an error of law in awarding penalties under\nLabor Code section 558.1\n       We find that the award of penalties under section 558 must be reversed and\nremanded for further consideration in the trial court. We affirm the judgment in all other\nrespects.\n                              FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n       Mohamed formed Explorer 1 in 2009. He initially capitalized the venture with\n$500,000. The following year, he contributed an additional $30,000 in capital, and\nsubsequently continued to capitalize the company by loaning it approximately $2 million\nfor property, equipment, payroll and supplies. Mohamed has been Explorer 1’s sole\nmember and manager since its inception.\n       Kirner, Richard, and Stickler worked as emergency medical technicians (EMTs),\ndriving ambulances for appellants. Kirner worked from April 1, 2011, through\nSeptember 6, 2012. Richard worked from June 2011 through June 2012. Stickler\nworked from July 2011 through October 2011.\n       Respondents did not use a time clock, did not keep track of meal breaks, and were\nnot paid for overtime. There were no scheduled breaks. There was no method used to\nkeep track of hours worked or sleep time. Respondents worked either a “day car shift,”\nwhich would last from 1 hour to 16 hours, or a 24-hour shift. Respondents were also\n\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Labor Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\n                                             2\n\frequired to work special events, and unless the event occurred during a regularly\nscheduled shift, respondents would be required to volunteer their time at these events.\nMohamed told respondents that if they did not volunteer at the event, they would be\nterminated from employment. Respondents were never paid overtime, no matter how\nmany hours they worked in a day or in a week. Respondents believed they should be\npaid overtime, however when they approached Mohamed about this issue, he informed\nrespondents that they could leave the job.\n       Respondents were paid every two weeks. When respondents brought to\nMohamed’s attention that their actual hours worked were different from what their pay\nreflected, they were told, “there’s the door.” Respondents did not have an understanding\nof how Mohamed came up with the number of hours for which he paid them.\nRespondents did not sign any written agreement regarding how they were to be paid\nwhen they worked a 24-hour shift, nor did they enter an oral agreement regarding how\nthey were to be paid when they worked a 24-hour shift. They never agreed that they\nwould not be paid for time that they were sleeping or not running calls.2\n       Every week, respondents and other employees signed time sheets. However, the\nhours actually worked did not match the hours recorded on the time sheet. If respondents\never questioned the discrepancy between the hours they actually worked and the hours on\nthe time sheet, Mohamed would state, “If you don’t like your job, there’s the door.”\nWhen Kirner refused to sign the time sheet, Mohamed withheld Kirner’s pay until he\nsigned. Kirner testified he was afraid he would not find employment elsewhere, so he\ncontinued to accept the insufficient payments. Kirner stated, “I signed each and every\ntime. I had a family to take care of.” Richard also testified that he accepted the\ninsufficient pay, stating: “having some income is better than having no income at all.”\n\n\n\n\n2       Mohamed contradicted the testimony of respondents, stating that he had informed\nthem that he would pay 13 hours out of a 24-hour shift. Mohamed testified that he\nmemorialized this policy in writing with a document referred to as a shift schedule. The\nshift schedule was not signed by any party.\n\n                                             3\n\f        When Kirner questioned the accuracy of the forms he was signing, Mohamed\nsometimes stated that he would put the missing pay on the following week’s paycheck.\nHowever, the missing pay was never provided. When Kirner pointed out that he was\nworking hours that were not even reflected on the master time sheet, Mohamed told him,\n“Those were volunteer times.”\n        The trial court noted its concern that there was no accurate record of the hours\nworked by respondents. Although the master time sheets were produced, there were gaps\nin the records during the relevant time frame. The records produced were missing May to\nJuly 2011, half of August 2011, all of September 2011, most of October 2011, the last\nhalf of November 2011, all of December 2011, half of January 2012, the last half of\nMarch 2012, all of April 2012, part of May 2012, all of June 2012, and all but the last\nthree days of July 2012. Appellants also failed to produce dispatch records or other\nreports that would show what dates and times respondents were dispatched out on calls.\nAppellants stated they had destroyed the records and had no other records to produce.\n        Respondents’ duties included transporting patients; maintaining the station and\nbuilding; running errands; and watching Mohamed’s children. Mohamed used the\ncompany supervisor’s truck as his own personal vehicle. Mohamed also sent Stickler to\nthe grocery store to purchase groceries for Mohamed’s family. Respondents were\nrequired to do mechanical work on Mohamed’s personal vehicles, pick up Mohamed’s\npersonal dry cleaning, and drive Mohamed to the utility company so that he could pay his\npersonal bills. Kirner moved Mohamed’s personal belongings to a storage unit.\nMohamed’s father, who was homeless, would reside at the ambulance station for periods\nof a week to a month, or sometimes for just an occasional day. When Mohamed was\nunable to get in touch with his father, he would send employees to search for him during\ntheir shift.\n        Mohamed testified that he is the owner of Explorer 1, but has never been\nemployed by Explorer 1. He has never collected a paycheck from Explorer 1. Explorer 1\nhas always operated at a loss. Explorer 1 did not pay taxes for 2010, 2011 or 2013\nbecause of the losses for those years. Mohamed loaned Explorer 1 about $2 million of\n\n\n                                              4\n\fhis personal money. Mohamed pays his wife a salary to work as a clerk for Explorer 1,\nand she covers the personal bills and rent for the family. Mohamed testified that he\nbelieved he filed an operating agreement for Explorer 1 with the Secretary of State,\nhowever none was produced in this action.\n                               PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       On December 31, 2012, respondents filed their complaint against appellants for:\n(1) failure to pay overtime compensation in violation of sections 510, 1194, and 1198; (2)\nfailure to pay wages; (3) waiting time penalties under section 203; (4) violation of section\n226, subdivision (a); (5) civil penalty for Labor Code violations pursuant to section 558;\n(6) unfair business practices under Business & Professions Code section 17200, et seq.;\n(7) conversion under Civil Code section 3336; and (8) unjust enrichment under Civil\nCode section 3426.3.\n       Appellants filed an answer on April 18, 2013.\n       The matter proceeded to a bench trial, which commenced on January 7, 2014. On\nJanuary 14, 2014, the court announced its decision on the record. The court found that no\nwritten or verbal agreement for respondents to receive less than pay for the full 24 hours\nof a 24-hour shift was proved in this case. The shift scheduling document, which\ndescribed the 24-hour shift, was not signed by any party.\n       The court held that alter ego was established by the evidence. In support of this\nfinding, the court noted that its decision was based principally on the evidence that the\nbusiness was operating at a loss from the beginning and was not filing tax returns.\n       The trial court found for respondents on their claims for: (1) failure to pay\novertime compensation; (2) failure to pay wages; (3) waiting time penalties; (4) violation\nof section 226, subdivision (a) (requiring employers to provide accurate itemized\nstatements in writing showing hours worked, gross wages, deductions, and net pay,\namong other things); (5) civil penalty for violation of section 558 (providing for a civil\npenalty against any employer who violates a section of that chapter or any provision\nregulating hours and days of work in any order of the Industrial Welfare Commission\n(IWC)); and (6) issued an injunction under Business & Professions Code section 17200.\n\n\n                                              5\n\fThe court found in favor of appellants on respondents’ claims for conversion and unjust\nenrichment.\n       The trial court’s awards were based on respondents’ computations. Kirner was\nawarded $65,517.50 in unpaid wages and overtime; $6,480 in section 203 penalties;\n$3,550 in section 226 penalties; and $3,550 in section 558 penalties.\n       Richard was awarded $43,062.50 in unpaid wages and overtime; $9,450 in section\n203 penalties; $2,450 in section 226 penalties; and $2,450 in section 558 penalties.\n       Stickler was awarded $11,320 in unpaid wages and overtime; $9,000 in section\n203 penalties; $550 in section 226 penalties; and $550 in section 558 penalties.\n       On April 16, 2014, the trial court amended the judgment to include an award in\nrespondents’ favor of $85,181.50 in attorney fees and $7,756.41 in costs.\n       Appellants filed their notice of appeal on April 15, 2014.\n                                       DISCUSSION\nI. Alter ego finding\n       Appellants’ first argument is that the trial court’s finding of alter ego liability is\nnot supported by substantial evidence.\n       A. Standard of review\n       Under the substantial evidence standard, “the power of an appellate court begins\nand ends with the determination as to whether, on the entire record, there is substantial\nevidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, which will support the determination, and when\ntwo or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts, a reviewing court is\nwithout power to substitute its deductions for those of the trial court. If such substantial\nevidence be found, it is of no consequence that the trial court believing other evidence, or\ndrawing other reasonable inferences, might have reached a contrary conclusion.\n[Citations.]” (Bowers v. Bernards (1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 870, 873-874 (Bowers).)\n       However, substantial evidence must be “‘of ponderable legal significance.” (Kuhn\nv. Department of General Services (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1627, 1633.) It must be\nreasonable, credible, and of solid value. (Ibid.) “The ultimate determination is whether a\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\freasonable trier of fact could have found for the respondent based on the whole record.\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n       B. The doctrine of alter ego\n       “Ordinarily, a corporation is regarded as a legal entity, separate and distinct from\nits stockholders, officers and directors, with separate and distinct liabilities and\nobligations. [Citations.]” (Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 83\nCal.App.4th 523, 538 (Sonora).) However, the corporate identity may be disregarded,\nand the corporate veil pierced, “where an abuse of the corporate privilege justifies\nholding the equitable ownership of a corporation liable for the actions of the corporation.\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.) Thus, under the alter ego doctrine, “when the corporate form is used\nto perpetrate a fraud, circumvent a statute, or accomplish some other wrongful or\ninequitable purpose, the courts will ignore the corporate entity and deem the\ncorporation’s acts to be those of the persons or organizations actually controlling the\ncorporation, in most instances the equitable owners. [Citations.]” (Ibid.)\n       Two conditions must be met before the alter ego doctrine will be invoked: “First,\nthere must be such unity of interest and ownership between the corporation and its\nequitable owner that the separate personalities of the corporation and the shareholder do\nnot in reality exist. Second, there must be an inequitable result if the acts in question are\ntreated as those of the corporation alone. [Citations.]” (Sonora, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at\np. 538.) “Alter ego is an extreme remedy, sparingly used. [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 539.)\n       Numerous factors may be considered in deciding whether to apply the doctrine of\nalter ego. As set forth in Associated Vendors, Inc. v. Oakland Meat Co. (1962) 210\nCal.App.2d 825, 838-840 (Associated Vendors), among the factors to be considered are:\n               “Commingling of funds and other assets, failure to segregate funds\n       of the separate entities, and the unauthorized diversion of corporate funds\n       or assets to other than corporate uses [citations]; the treatment by an\n       individual of the assets of the corporation as his own [citations]; the failure\n       to obtain authority to issue stock or to subscribe to or issue the same\n       [citations]; the holding out by an individual that he is personally liable for\n       the debts of the corporation [citations]; the failure to maintain minutes or\n       adequate corporate records, and the confusion of the records of the separate\n\n\n                                               7\n\f       entities [citations]; the identical equitable ownership in the two entities; the\n       identification of the equitable owners thereof with the domination and\n       control of the two entities; identification of the directors and officers of the\n       two entities in the responsible supervision and management; sole ownership\n       of all of the stock in a corporation by one individual or the members of a\n       family [citations]; the use of the same office or business location; the\n       employment of the same employees and/or attorney [citations]; the failure\n       to adequately capitalize a corporation; the total absence of corporate assets,\n       and undercapitalization [citations]; the use of a corporation as a mere shell,\n       instrumentality or conduit for a single venture or the business of an\n       individual or another corporation [citations]; the concealment and\n       misrepresentation of the identity of the responsible ownership, management\n       and financial interest, or concealment of personal business activities\n       [citations]; the disregard of legal formalities and the failure to maintain\n       arm’s length relationships among related entities [citations]; the use of the\n       corporate entity to procure labor, services or merchandise for another\n       person or entity [citations]; the diversion of assets from a corporation by or\n       to a stockholder or other person or entity, to the detriment of creditors, or\n       the manipulation of assets and liabilities between entities so as to\n       concentrate the assets in one and the liabilities in another [citations]; the\n       contracting with another with intent to avoid performance by use of a\n       corporate entity as a shield against personal liability, or the use of a\n       corporation as a subterfuge of illegal transactions [citations]; and the\n       formation and use of a corporation to transfer to it the existing liability of\n       another person or entity [citations].”\n\n       “No one characteristic governs, but the courts must look at all the circumstances to\ndetermine whether the doctrine should be applied. [Citation.]” (Sonora, supra, 83\nCal.App.4th at p. 539.)\n       C. The evidence supports the trial court’s alter ego determination\n       The evidence showed that several of the factors listed above were present during\nthe time of respondents’ employment. Mohamed diverted corporate assets for his\npersonal use, such as using the company supervisor’s truck as his own personal vehicle;\nusing company employees to do personal errands such as shop for groceries, watch his\nchildren, run his personal errands, and perform maintenance on his personal vehicles. In\naddition, Mohamed used the business address for personal reasons when he permitted his\nfather to stay there for extended periods of time.\n\n\n                                              8\n\f          There was also evidence that Mohamed failed to maintain adequate and customary\nrecords for Explorer 1. No operating agreement or statements of information were\nproduced in the trial court. In addition, insufficient records of employee hours and pay\nwere maintained.\n          There was also evidence of commingling of funds between Mohamed’s own\npersonal funds and the company’s funds. Although Mohamed managed the company, he\nnever paid himself any wages, and he covered the company’s losses personally, paying\nfor property, equipment, payroll and supplies. In addition, the station out of which\nExplorer 1 operates is owned half by Mohamed and half by the company, although\nMohamed testified that the company pays the full mortgage.3 Mohamed testified that\nExplorer 1 pays rent to Mohamed, and he in turn lends that money back to the company.\nMohamed has never received income from the company and it has never been profitable.\nIn sum, as the trial court noted, Explorer 1 has never operated as a viable entity. Instead,\nMohamed operates Explorer 1 as a personal business. Mohamed exercised domination\nand control of Explorer 1 and its employees, in particular by asserting his sole discretion\nas to how many hours to pay each employee, regardless of how many hours the employee\nactually worked.\n          This evidence supports the trial court’s determination that Mohamed was the alter\nego of Explorer 1, and that the doctrine should apply to pierce the corporate veil in this\ncase.\n          Appellants argue that the trial court made two errors in applying the alter ego\ndoctrine: first, it imposed alter ego liability on Mohamed merely because it found\nExplorer 1 to be undercapitalized; and (2) it confused undercapitalization with operating\nlosses.\n          We reject Mohamed’s claims. Initially, we note that the trial court did not rely\nexclusively on undercapitalization in imposing alter ego liability. The court indicated\norally that its decision was based “principally” on the facts that the court raised during\n\n3     However, Mohamed later testified that the full mortgage is automatically\nwithdrawn from his personal account.\n\n                                                9\n\fargument. During argument, the court noted that the business was operating at a loss\nfrom the beginning; that the business did not file tax returns; and that the business was\nnever profitable. The court’s use of the term “principally” suggests that, while these\nfinancial factors were a large part of its decision, they were not the only factors it\nconsidered.4\n       In addition, the trial court did not specifically discuss undercapitalization but\ninstead focused on the fact that the business was consistently operating at a loss. This\nsuggests the court was also taking into consideration the practical consequences of\nExplorer 1’s poor financial condition, such as the commingling of funds that was going\non between Mohamed and Explorer 1 and Mohamed’s assumption of Explorer 1’s\nliabilities for debts such as payroll and equipment. The unhealthy financial condition of\nExplorer 1 -- which the trial court properly considered -- was closely linked with other\nfactors which were also properly considered in determining alter ego.5\n       Appellants also object to the trial court’s consideration of three other factors: (1)\nthat Explorer 1 did not offer a written operating agreement; (2) that Explorer 1 did not\nfile tax returns; and (3) that Mohamed was not an employee of the company, but\nnonetheless managed its affairs. Appellants argue that none of these factors support an\nalter ego finding.\n       While there was testimony that Explorer 1 did not provide an operating agreement,\nappellants cite no place in the record where the trial court specifically emphasized a\n\n4      We are not required to rely on the trial court’s comments from the bench during\noral argument to ascertain the court’s reasoning. In a non-jury trial, the appellant was\npermitted to preserve the court’s reasoning in a statement of decision pursuant to Code of\nCivil Procedure section 632. (Slavin v. Borinstein (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 713, 718.)\nThere is no statement of decision in the record. “In the absence of a statement of\ndecision, the appellate court will presume that the trial court made all factual findings\nnecessary to support the judgment for which substantial evidence exists in the record.\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n\n5       Appellants do not point to evidence in the record showing any confusion on the\npart of the trial court as to the difference between undercapitalization and operating loss,\ntherefore we decline to address this argument.\n\n                                              10\n\fconcern over this fact. However, assuming the trial court did consider Explorer 1’s lack\nof an operating agreement, we find that such consideration did not constitute error.\nFailure to maintain adequate corporate records is a legitimate consideration in making a\ndetermination of alter ego. (Associated Vendors, supra, 210 Cal.App.2d at pp. 838-840.)\nAppellants point out that an oral operating agreement is sufficient under former\nCorporations Code section 17001, however they point to no testimony suggesting that\nsuch an oral operating agreement existed. Under the circumstances, the trial court was\nentitled to consider the lack of an operating agreement as evidence of alter ego. As\nrespondents pointed out in closing argument, Mohamed was commingling his assets. He\nwas meeting payroll by funding the operation with his own money. While he ran the\nwhole operation, he had no official title and did not pay himself. He essentially ran the\ncompany as he liked, without an operating agreement. The trial court’s consideration of\nthis evidence was proper.\n       Appellants next attack the trial court’s consideration of Explorer 1’s failure to file\ntax returns. As a single-member limited liability company (LLC), appellants argue,\nExplorer 1 is disregarded for tax purposes and is not required to file tax returns.\nAppellants cite 26 Code of Federal Regulations part 301.7701-3(b)(ii) (2015), which\nstates that a domestic entity may elect to be “[d]isregarded as an entity separate from its\nowner if it has a single owner.” While this regulation permits a single-member LLC to\nelect to be disregarded as a separate entity, it does not suggest that doing so may not be\nconsidered as evidence of alter ego liability. In fact, Mohamed’s failure to segregate the\nfinances of Explorer 1 from his own was a factor the trial court was permitted to consider\nin making its determination of alter ego. (Associated Vendors, supra, 210 Cal.App.2d at\npp. 838-840.)\n       As to Mohamed’s status as an individual who was not employed by Explorer 1,\nappellants cite former Corporations Code section 17157, subdivision (b)(2), which stated\nthat “Every manager is an agent of the limited liability company for the purpose of its\nbusiness or affairs.” (Added Stats. 1994, ch. 1200, § 27; amended Stats. 2012, ch. 419,\n§ 19, repealed Jan. 1, 2014.) Again, nothing in this section suggests it was improper for\n\n\n                                             11\n\fthe trial court to consider Mohamed’s lack of employment by the company in making its\ndetermination of alter ego. The fact that Mohamed managed the daily affairs of the\ncompany without accepting any pay suggests that he was treating the assets and\nemployees of the company as his own, which was a factor the court was entitled to\nconsider. (Associated Vendors, supra, 210 Cal.App.2d at pp. 838-840.)\n       Appellants list evidence that contradicts the evidence presented in favor of a\nfinding of alter ego. However, where there is “substantial evidence, contradicted or\nuncontradicted, which will support the determination, and when two or more inferences\ncan reasonably be deduced from the facts, a reviewing court is without power to\nsubstitute its deductions for those of the trial court.” (Bowers, supra, 150 Cal.App.3d at\npp. 873-874.) Substantial evidence exists in the record to support the trial court’s finding\nthat application of the alter ego doctrine was proper in this case.6\nII. Agreement to exclude sleep time from 24-hour shifts\n       Appellants next argue that the trial court erred in making its factual finding that\nKirner and Richard had no agreement or understanding to exclude sleep time from 24-\nhour shifts. Again, the substantial evidence standard applies.\n\n\n\n\n6       In their reply brief, appellants raise the argument that there was no evidence to\nsupport the idea that recognizing Explorer 1 as a distinct entity would create an\ninequitable result or injustice. (See Sonora, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at p. 538 [before\napplication of the alter ego doctrine, the fact finder must find that “there [will] be an\ninequitable result if the acts in question are treated as those of the corporation alone”].)\n“[W]e need not consider new issues raised for the first time in a reply brief in the absence\nof good cause.” (In re Marriage of Ackerman (2006) 146 Cal.App.4th 191, 214.)\nAppellants have failed to show good cause. However, we note that in the context of an\nalter ego finding, inequity or injustice may be shown when “‘“there is such a unity of\ninterest and ownership that the individuality, or separateness, of such person and\ncorporation has ceased, and that the facts are such that an adherence to the fiction of the\nseparate existence of the corporation would, under the particular circumstances, sanction\na fraud or promote injustice.”’ [Citations.]” (Associated Vendors, supra, 210 Cal.App.2d\nat p. 837.) Substantial evidence, discussed throughout this opinion, was found in the\nrecord to support the trial court’s implied finding that such circumstances were present.\n\n                                             12\n\f      A. Applicable law\n      Section 1173 authorizes the IWC to promulgate orders regulating wages, hours\nand working conditions throughout the state. (§ 1173; Monzon v. Schaefer Ambulance\nService, Inc. (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 16, 29 (Monzon).) The IWC has promulgated wage\norder No. 9, codified in California Code of Regulations, title 8, section 11090 (wage\norder No. 9).\n      Subdivision 2(G) of wage order No. 9 states that “‘Hours worked’ means the time\nduring which an employee is subject to the control of an employer, and includes all the\ntime the employee is suffered or permitted to work, whether or not required to do so.”\n      Subdivision 3(A)(1) of wage order No. 9 states:\n             “The following overtime provisions are applicable to employees 18\n      years of age or over and to employees 16 or 17 years of age who are not\n      required by law to attend school and are not otherwise prohibited by law\n      from engaging in the subject work. Such employees shall not be employed\n      more than eight (8) hours in any workday or more than 40 hours in any\n      workweek unless the employee receives one and one-half (1 ½) times such\n      employee’s regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 hours in the\n      workweek. Eight (8) hours of labor constitutes a day’s work. Employment\n      beyond eight (8) hours in any workday or more than six (6) days in any\n      workweek is permissible provided the employee is compensated for such\n      overtime at not less than:\n\n             “(a) One and one-half (1 ½) times the employee’s regular rate of\n      pay for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours up to and including 12\n      hours in any workday, and for the first eight (8) hours worked on the\n      seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a workweek; and\n\n             “(b) Double the employee’s regular rate of pay for all hours worked\n      in excess of 12 hours in any workday and for all hours worked in excess of\n      eight (8) hours on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a\n      workweek.”\n\n      Subdivision 3(K) of wage order No. 9 states:\n             “The daily overtime provision of subsection (A) above shall not\n      apply to ambulance drivers and attendants scheduled for 24-hour shifts of\n      duty who have agreed in writing to exclude from daily time worked not\n      more than three (3) meal periods of not more than one (1) hour each and a\n\n\n                                            13\n\f       regularly scheduled uninterrupted sleeping period of not more than eight (8)\n       hours. The employer shall provide adequate dormitory and kitchen\n       facilities for employees on such a schedule.”\n\n       Thus, the language of wage order No. 9 suggests that any agreement for\nambulance drivers to receive less than 24 hours pay must be in writing. However, in\nMonzon, this court held that “it is permissible for an employer and ambulance drivers and\nattendants to enter into an agreement, which need not be written, to exclude up to eight\nhours of sleep time from work or compensable time on twenty-four-hour shifts if\nadequate sleeping facilities are provided by the employer and the employee has the\nopportunity to get at least five hours of uninterrupted sleep.” (Monzon, supra, 224\nCal.App.3d at p. 46.)\n       The court further held that “since an agreement to exclude sleep time from\ncompensable time is an exception to the requirement that employees be paid for ‘hours\nworked,’ it is the burden of the employer to prove that an agreement exists and what the\nterms of the agreement are.” (Monzon, supra, 224 Cal.App.3d at p. 46.)\n       Justice Johnson wrote a separate concurring and dissenting opinion in Monzon,\narguing in part that the California regulation provides, in no uncertain terms, that any\nexclusion of sleep and mealtime from “hours worked” must be in the form of a written\nagreement. (Monzon, supra, 224 Cal.App.3d at p. 50.)\n       B. Substantial evidence supports the trial court’s decision that no agreement --\nwritten or verbal -- to receive less than 24 hours pay existed\n       The trial court acknowledged that Monzon indicates that a verbal agreement to\nreceive less than 24 hours pay, if proved, would be sufficient. However, the trial court\nfound that no verbal agreement was proved in this case.\n       Appellants argue that the trial court’s decision was not supported by substantial\nevidence. Appellants point out that Kirner and Richard signed weekly time sheets on\nnumerous occasions reflecting their understanding that they would be paid 16 hours for a\n24-hour shift. Appellants also point out that Kirner and Richard acknowledged in writing\nthat (1) they had reviewed the hours in those timesheets, and (2) the resulting payment\n\n\n                                             14\n\fwas accurate and correct. Appellants claim that this evidence shows that Kirner and\nRichard clearly understood their pay arrangement.\n        However, contrary evidence existed in the record. Each of the respondents\ntestified that there was no agreement or understanding regarding their pay for 24-hour\nshifts. The trial court clearly weighed and considered the evidence on both sides of this\nissue. The court stated: “We have three plaintiffs testifying against one defendant. The\ndefendant says they looked at, read, and agreed to the shift scheduling documents that are\nnot signed. We got [sic] plaintiffs that said they did not. We also got [sic] Mr. Bowers\nwho said that he did not agree. So I think that on the scale and by the standard that I have\nto measure the evidence, I would like to find for the plaintiffs.”\n        In addition, as respondents point out, Mohamed’s own actions undermine his\nclaim that he had an agreement to pay respondents less than 24 hours for a 24-hour shift.\nUnder the terms of the purported agreement, set forth in the unsigned shift scheduling\ndocument, Mohamed stated that he agreed to pay respondents 13 hours out of a 24-hour\nshift. However, the evidence showed that the amount that respondents were paid for the\n24-hour shifts was random, reflecting no consistent pattern. They were paid anywhere\nfrom 13 to 24 hours for the shifts, depending on how much “incentive” pay Mohamed\nelected to pay them.\n        The time sheets also do not provide evidence of a written or oral agreement\nregarding pay for 24-hour shifts. Respondents testified that they were forced to sign the\nsheets or lose their jobs. When they did question the accuracy of the time sheets,\nMohamed would inform respondents that if they didn’t like it, they could leave. Such\ncoercion does not constitute the type of agreement or understanding required under the\nlaw.7\n\n7      We note that in Monzon “[t]he deposition testimony of each employee\ndemonstrated that he understood that he would not be paid for eight hours of\nuninterrupted sleep.” (Monzon, supra, 224 Cal.App.3d at p. 24.) Here, there was no\ntestimony suggesting that respondents had any idea how Mohamed came up with the\nnumber of hours for which he paid them. Respondents testified that there were no\nscheduled breaks, and there was no way to keep track of hours worked or sleep time.\n\n                                             15\n\f       In sum, substantial evidence supports the trial court’s decision that no written or\noral agreement existed between appellants and respondents regarding payment of less\nthan 24 hours for a 24-hour shift.8\nIII. Section 558 penalties\n       Appellants argue that the trial court erred in awarding penalties under section 558.\nAppellants argue that the statute is only enforceable via investigation and citation by “the\nLabor Commissioner” (§ 558, subd. (b)), and that a private plaintiff cannot bring a claim\nfor penalties under section 558 unless he utilizes the procedures in the Labor Code\nPrivate Attorneys General Act (PAGA) (§ 2698 et seq.). Appellants claim that because\nrespondents never utilized the procedures under PAGA, or even alleged in their\ncomplaint that they did so, the trial court erred in awarding penalties under section 558.\n       A. Applicable law\n       Section 558 provides for civil penalties for an employer who violates “a section of\nthis chapter or any provision regulating hours and days of work in any order of the\nIndustrial Welfare Commission.” (§ 558, subd. (a).) However, the statute specifies that\nit is enforceable by investigation and citation by the Labor Commissioner. (§ 558, subd.\n(b).) Thus, on the face of the statute, there is no private right of action for penalties under\nsection 558.\n\n\nRespondents were never paid overtime, no matter how many hours they worked in a day\nor in a week. Respondents testified that they never agreed that they would not get paid\nfor time that they were sleeping or not running calls.\n\n8      Because we have determined that the evidence supports the trial court’s decision\nthat no agreement or understanding existed between respondents and appellants to\nexclude sleep time from 24-hour shifts, we need not reach the question of whether\nrespondents were given the opportunity to receive, or usually received, five hours of\nuninterrupted sleep. (See Monzon, supra, 224 Cal.App.3d at p. 46 [“it is permissible for\nan employer and ambulance drivers and attendants to enter into an agreement, which\nneed not be written, to exclude up to eight hours of sleep time from work or compensable\ntime on twenty-four-hour shifts if adequate sleeping facilities are provided by the\nemployer and the employee has the opportunity to get at least five hours of uninterrupted\nsleep”].)\n\n\n                                              16\n\f       However, PAGA, which became effective January 1, 2004, allows employees to\n“bring a civil action to collect civil penalties for Labor Code violations previously only\navailable in enforcement actions initiated by the state’s labor law enforcement agencies.\n[Citations.]” (Caliber Bodyworks, Inc. v. Superior Court (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 365,\n374 (Caliber), fn. omitted.) Section 2699.5 specifically identifies the Labor Code\nprovisions enforceable under PAGA. Those provisions include sections 203, 226,\nsubdivision (a), 510, 1194, and 1198, violations of which were alleged in the first four\ncauses of action in respondents’ complaint.9 (§ 2699.5.)\n       “The Act was amended shortly after its effective date . . . to, among other things,\nrequire exhaustion of administrative procedures before an action may be filed to allow\nthe [Labor and Workforce Development Agency] the initial opportunity to investigate\nand cite employers for Labor Code violations.” (Caliber, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at p.\n375, fn. omitted.) Section 2699.3, subdivision (a), provides the administrative procedures\nthat must be followed before an aggrieved employee may file a civil action to recover\ncivil penalties under section 2699 for violations of any of the Labor Code provisions\nidentified in section 2699.5:\n               “(a) A civil action by an aggrieved employee . . . alleging a\n       violation of any provision listed in Section 2699.5 shall commence only\n       after the following requirements have been met:\n\n              “(1) The aggrieved employee or representative shall give written\n       notice by certified mail to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency\n       and the employer of the specific provisions of this code alleged to have\n       been violated, including the facts and theories to support the alleged\n       violation.\n\n9      While section 558 is not specifically identified in section 2699.5, respondents’\ncomplaint alleged substantive violations of the above-referenced statutory provisions\nwhich are named in section 2699.5. “[I]t is the request for civil penalties for an alleged\nviolation of a substantive statutory provision listed in section 2699.5” that triggers the\nemployee’s right to bring an action under PAGA. (Caliber, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at p.\n379, fn. 15.) Respondents’ fifth cause of action for civil penalties under section 558\nsought civil penalties for violations of substantive provisions which are named in section\n2699.5. Thus, the PAGA is applicable to respondents’ request for penalties under section\n558. (Caliber, at p. 379 & fn. 15.)\n\n                                             17\n\f              “(2)(A) The agency shall notify the employer and the aggrieved\n       employee or representative by certified mail that it does not intend to\n       investigate the alleged violation within 30 calendar days of the postmark\n       date of the notice received pursuant to paragraph (1). Upon receipt of that\n       notice or if no notice is provided within 33 calendar days of the postmark\n       date of the notice given pursuant to paragraph (1), the aggrieved employee\n       may commence a civil action pursuant to Section 2699.\n\n(§ 2699.3, subd. (a)(1) & (2)(A).)\n       B. Forfeiture\n       We first address respondents’ claim that appellants have forfeited their right to\nraise the issue of whether respondents exhausted their administrative remedies, as\nrequired under PAGA. Respondents argue that an appellant cannot assert a new theory of\ndefense on appeal. (Citing Bardis v. Oates (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1, 13, fn. 6\n[defendants’ claim that certain markups were permissible due to a quantum meruit theory\ncould not be urged on appeal because it was not raised in the trial court].) Appellants\nalso argue that an appellant who permitted a case to be tried on the assumption that the\ncomplaint stated a cause of action may be precluded from challenging the sufficiency of\nthe complaint for the first time on appeal. (Citing Nelson v. Department of Alcoholic\nBeverage Control (1959) 166 Cal.App.2d 783, 788 [accusation failed to state that the\nalleged acts occurred on the licensed premises, however such allegations were essentially\nin the accusation and the appellant at no time complained of the deficiency].)\n       Where exhaustion of administrative remedies is required, it is a jurisdictional\nprerequisite to the filing of a complaint. (Campbell v. Regents of University of California\n(2005) 35 Cal.4th 311, 321.) Exhaustion of administrative remedies “‘is not a matter of\njudicial discretion, but is a fundamental rule of procedure . . . binding upon all courts.’\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.) However, recent case law has suggested that a defendant waives the\ndefense of exhaustion by failing to timely assert it in the trial court. (Mokler v. County of\nOrange (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 121, 135 (Mokler); Green v. City of Oceanside (1987)\n194 Cal.App.3d 212, 239 (Green).) The rationale presented in these cases is that\nexhaustion is a “judicially created rule of procedure, which the courts should not allow a\n\n\n                                              18\n\fparty to use inequitably.” (Mokler, supra, at p. 134.) “As Green observed, ‘We think it\nwould be grossly unfair to allow a defendant to ignore this potential procedural defense at\na time when facts and memories were fresh and put a plaintiff to the time and expense of\na full trial, knowing it could assert the failure to exhaust administrative remedies if it\nreceived an adverse jury verdict. The exhaustion doctrine is simply a “procedural\nprerequisite” [citation] the City decided to forego. . . .’ [Citation.]” (Mokler, at pp. 134-\n135.)\n        While Mokler and Green make it clear that we may apply the waiver doctrine to a\nclaim of failure to exhaust administrative remedies, we find that under the circumstances\nof this case, application of the doctrine here is inappropriate. While it is true that\nrespondents never raised the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies, the question\nof whether respondents were asserting PAGA claims was directly raised by the judge\nduring trial. The court had before it the respondents’ complaint, and asked directly: “Are\nthere PAGA claims?” Respondents’ counsel responded, “No PAGA.”\n        Respondents’ counsel’s affirmative representation in open court that there were no\nPAGA claims in this case carried with it an implicit representation that exhaustion of\nadministrative remedies was not an issue. While this response was likely an error rather\nthan a deliberate attempt to mislead the court and the parties, it is also likely that the\nparties would be in different positions on appeal if respondents’ counsel had answered\nthe question accurately. Under the circumstances, we find that respondents are estopped\nfrom arguing that appellants waived the exhaustion argument by not raising it in the trial\ncourt. Respondents’ erroneous response to the trial court’s direct question could easily\nhave misled not only the court but the appellants into thinking that exhaustion was\nunnecessary in this case. Respondents may not provide inaccurate information regarding\nthe prerequisites for their claims, then argue waiver of any claims regarding those\nprerequisites. Under the circumstances, we find that appellants have not forfeited this\nissue, and it must be decided on the merits.\n\n\n\n\n                                               19\n\f       C. Reconsideration of section 558 penalties by the trial court is appropriate\n       Respondents’ counsel’s misstatement in court caused the trial court to award\nsection 558 penalties without consideration of whether respondents had exhausted their\nadministrative remedies. On appeal, respondents dispute that they failed to utilize the\nprocedures required under PAGA. While respondents’ representation to the trial court\nthat no PAGA claims were being made suggests that they did not avail themselves of\nthose procedures, there remains some factual ambiguity as to whether or not respondents\ncomplied with PAGA prior to bringing their section 558 claim. We cannot make such a\nfactual determination on appeal.\n       In addition, respondents concede on appeal that the statute of limitations for\nsection 558 is one year (see Code Civ. Proc., § 340, subd. (a)), and thus that they were\nawarded more penalties than they should have been under the statute.10\n       Finally, appellants argue that the trial court erroneously awarded heightened\n“subsequent violation” penalties. Section 558, subdivision (a)(1), provides that for an\ninitial violation, the civil penalty shall be $50 for each underpaid employee for the pay\nperiod for which the employee was underpaid; and for each subsequent violation, the\ncivil penalty shall be $100 for each underpaid employee for the pay period for which the\nemployee was underpaid. (§ 558, subd. (a)(1) & (2).) “Until the employer has been\nnotified that it is violating a Labor Code provision . . . , the employer cannot be presumed\nto be aware that its continuing underpayment of employees is a ‘violation’ subject to\npenalties.” (Amaral v. Cintas Corp. No. 2 (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1157, 1208-1209.)\n“However, after the employer has learned its conduct violates the Labor Code, the\nemployer is on notice that any future violations will be punished just the same as\n\n\n10     Appellants argue that because the complaint was filed on December 31, 2012,\nrespondents could only recover penalties for pay periods occurring on or after December\n31, 2011. Because Stickler’s employment ended in October 2011, appellants argue, he\nshould not have received any penalties at all. Kirner could only recover penalties for pay\nperiods occurring between December 31, 2011 and September 6, 2012, and Richard\ncould only recover penalties for pay periods occurring between December 31, 2011 and\nJune 2012, when his employment ended.\n\n                                            20\n\fviolations that are willful or intentional -- i.e., they will be punished at twice the rate of\npenalties that could have been imposed or that were imposed for the initial violation.”\n(Id. at p. 1209.)\n       Appellants argue that there is no evidence in the record that they ever received\nnotice from a court or commissioner that they were in violation of the Labor Code. Thus,\nthe heightened “subsequent violation” penalties were erroneous.\n       Under the circumstances, we must reverse and remand the award of section 558\npenalties to the trial court for reconsideration. The trial court should consider: (1)\nwhether respondents complied with the exhaustion requirements of PAGA in order to\nproperly claim an award of penalties under section 558; and, if so, (2) the appropriate\namount of such penalties, taking into consideration the relevant statute of limitations; and\n(3) whether notice of the initial violations was provided to appellants, justifying\nheightened subsequent violation penalties.\n                                       DISPOSITION\n       The portion of the judgment regarding penalties awarded under section 558 is\nreversed and remanded with instructions to the trial court to reconsider the award in view\nof this opinion. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects. Respondents are awarded\ntheir costs of appeal.\n       NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTS.\n\n\n\n                                                    ____________________________, J.\n                                                    CHAVEZ\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n__________________________, P.

Marchetti for Plaintiffs and Respondents.\n\f       Explorer 1 Ambulance & Medical Services, LLC (Explorer 1) and Sultan\nMohamed (Mohamed) (collectively appellants) appeal from a judgment following a court\ntrial against appellants and in favor of respondents Tayler Kirner (Kirner), Brian Richard\n(Richard), and Damien Stickler (Stickler) (collectively respondents) on respondents’\nclaims against appellants for wage and hour violations.\n       Appellants argue that substantial evidence does not support the trial court’s\ndecisions that Mohamed is Explorer 1’s alter ego and that Kirner and Richard had no\nagreement or understanding to exclude sleep time from 24-hour shifts. In addition,\nappellants argue that the trial court made an error of law in awarding penalties under\nLabor Code section 558.1\n       We find that the award of penalties under section 558 must be reversed and\nremanded for further consideration in the trial court. We affirm the judgment in all other\nrespects.\n                              FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n       Mohamed formed Explorer 1 in 2009. He initially capitalized the venture with\n$500,000. The following year, he contributed an additional $30,000 in capital, and\nsubsequently continued to capitalize the company by loaning it approximately $2 million\nfor property, equipment, payroll and supplies. Mohamed has been Explorer 1’s sole\nmember and manager since its inception.\n       Kirner, Richard, and Stickler worked as emergency medical technicians (EMTs),\ndriving ambulances for appellants. Kirner worked from April 1, 2011, through\nSeptember 6, 2012. Richard worked from June 2011 through June 2012. Stickler\nworked from July 2011 through October 2011.\n       Respondents did not use a time clock, did not keep track of meal breaks, and were\nnot paid for overtime. There were no scheduled breaks. There was no method used to\nkeep track of hours worked or sleep time. Respondents worked either a “day car shift,”\nwhich would last from 1 hour to 16 hours, or a 24-hour shift. Respondents were also\n\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Labor Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\n                                             2\n\frequired to work special events, and unless the event occurred during a regularly\nscheduled shift, respondents would be required to volunteer their time at these events.\nMohamed told respondents that if they did not volunteer at the event, they would be\nterminated from employment. Respondents were never paid overtime, no matter how\nmany hours they worked in a day or in a week. Respondents believed they should be\npaid overtime, however when they approached Mohamed about this issue, he informed\nrespondents that they could leave the job.\n       Respondents were paid every two weeks. When respondents brought to\nMohamed’s attention that their actual hours worked were different from what their pay\nreflected, they were told, “there’s the door.” Respondents did not have an understanding\nof how Mohamed came up with the number of hours for which he paid them.\nRespondents did not sign any written agreement regarding how they were to be paid\nwhen they worked a 24-hour shift, nor did they enter an oral agreement regarding how\nthey were to be paid when they worked a 24-hour shift. They never agreed that they\nwould not be paid for time that they were sleeping or not running calls.2\n       Every week, respondents and other employees signed time sheets. However, the\nhours actually worked did not match the hours recorded on the time sheet. If respondents\never questioned the discrepancy between the hours they actually worked and the hours on\nthe time sheet, Mohamed would state, “If you don’t like your job, there’s the door.”\nWhen Kirner refused to sign the time sheet, Mohamed withheld Kirner’s pay until he\nsigned. Kirner testified he was afraid he would not find employment elsewhere, so he\ncontinued to accept the insufficient payments. Kirner stated, “I signed each and every\ntime. I had a family to take care of.” Richard also testified that he accepted the\ninsufficient pay, stating: “having some income is better than having no income at all.”\n\n\n\n\n2       Mohamed contradicted the testimony of respondents, stating that he had informed\nthem that he would pay 13 hours out of a 24-hour shift. Mohamed testified that he\nmemorialized this policy in writing with a document referred to as a shift schedule. The\nshift schedule was not signed by any party.\n\n                                             3\n\f        When Kirner questioned the accuracy of the forms he was signing, Mohamed\nsometimes stated that he would put the missing pay on the following week’s paycheck.\nHowever, the missing pay was never provided. When Kirner pointed out that he was\nworking hours that were not even reflected on the master time sheet, Mohamed told him,\n“Those were volunteer times.”\n        The trial court noted its concern that there was no accurate record of the hours\nworked by respondents. Although the master time sheets were produced, there were gaps\nin the records during the relevant time frame. The records produced were missing May to\nJuly 2011, half of August 2011, all of September 2011, most of October 2011, the last\nhalf of November 2011, all of December 2011, half of January 2012, the last half of\nMarch 2012, all of April 2012, part of May 2012, all of June 2012, and all but the last\nthree days of July 2012. Appellants also failed to produce dispatch records or other\nreports that would show what dates and times respondents were dispatched out on calls.\nAppellants stated they had destroyed the records and had no other records to produce.\n        Respondents’ duties included transporting patients; maintaining the station and\nbuilding; running errands; and watching Mohamed’s children. Mohamed used the\ncompany supervisor’s truck as his own personal vehicle. Mohamed also sent Stickler to\nthe grocery store to purchase groceries for Mohamed’s family. Respondents were\nrequired to do mechanical work on Mohamed’s personal vehicles, pick up Mohamed’s\npersonal dry cleaning, and drive Mohamed to the utility company so that he could pay his\npersonal bills. Kirner moved Mohamed’s personal belongings to a storage unit.\nMohamed’s father, who was homeless, would reside at the ambulance station for periods\nof a week to a month, or sometimes for just an occasional day. When Mohamed was\nunable to get in touch with his father, he would send employees to search for him during\ntheir shift.\n        Mohamed testified that he is the owner of Explorer 1, but has never been\nemployed by Explorer 1. He has never collected a paycheck from Explorer 1. Explorer 1\nhas always operated at a loss. Explorer 1 did not pay taxes for 2010, 2011 or 2013\nbecause of the losses for those years. Mohamed loaned Explorer 1 about $2 million of\n\n\n                                              4\n\fhis personal money. Mohamed pays his wife a salary to work as a clerk for Explorer 1,\nand she covers the personal bills and rent for the family. Mohamed testified that he\nbelieved he filed an operating agreement for Explorer 1 with the Secretary of State,\nhowever none was produced in this action.\n                               PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       On December 31, 2012, respondents filed their complaint against appellants for:\n(1) failure to pay overtime compensation in violation of sections 510, 1194, and 1198; (2)\nfailure to pay wages; (3) waiting time penalties under section 203; (4) violation of section\n226, subdivision (a); (5) civil penalty for Labor Code violations pursuant to section 558;\n(6) unfair business practices under Business & Professions Code section 17200, et seq.;\n(7) conversion under Civil Code section 3336; and (8) unjust enrichment under Civil\nCode section 3426.3.\n       Appellants filed an answer on April 18, 2013.\n       The matter proceeded to a bench trial, which commenced on January 7, 2014. On\nJanuary 14, 2014, the court announced its decision on the record. The court found that no\nwritten or verbal agreement for respondents to receive less than pay for the full 24 hours\nof a 24-hour shift was proved in this case. The shift scheduling document, which\ndescribed the 24-hour shift, was not signed by any party.\n       The court held that alter ego was established by the evidence. In support of this\nfinding, the court noted that its decision was based principally on the evidence that the\nbusiness was operating at a loss from the beginning and was not filing tax returns.\n       The trial court found for respondents on their claims for: (1) failure to pay\novertime compensation; (2) failure to pay wages; (3) waiting time penalties; (4) violation\nof section 226, subdivision (a) (requiring employers to provide accurate itemized\nstatements in writing showing hours worked, gross wages, deductions, and net pay,\namong other things); (5) civil penalty for violation of section 558 (providing for a civil\npenalty against any employer who violates a section of that chapter or any provision\nregulating hours and days of work in any order of the Industrial Welfare Commission\n(IWC)); and (6) issued an injunction under Business & Professions Code section 17200.\n\n\n                                              5\n\fThe court found in favor of appellants on respondents’ claims for conversion and unjust\nenrichment.\n       The trial court’s awards were based on respondents’ computations. Kirner was\nawarded $65,517.50 in unpaid wages and overtime; $6,480 in section 203 penalties;\n$3,550 in section 226 penalties; and $3,550 in section 558 penalties.\n       Richard was awarded $43,062.50 in unpaid wages and overtime; $9,450 in section\n203 penalties; $2,450 in section 226 penalties; and $2,450 in section 558 penalties.\n       Stickler was awarded $11,320 in unpaid wages and overtime; $9,000 in section\n203 penalties; $550 in section 226 penalties; and $550 in section 558 penalties.\n       On April 16, 2014, the trial court amended the judgment to include an award in\nrespondents’ favor of $85,181.50 in attorney fees and $7,756.41 in costs.\n       Appellants filed their notice of appeal on April 15, 2014.\n                                       DISCUSSION\nI. Alter ego finding\n       Appellants’ first argument is that the trial court’s finding of alter ego liability is\nnot supported by substantial evidence.\n       A. Standard of review\n       Under the substantial evidence standard, “the power of an appellate court begins\nand ends with the determination as to whether, on the entire record, there is substantial\nevidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, which will support the determination, and when\ntwo or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts, a reviewing court is\nwithout power to substitute its deductions for those of the trial court. If such substantial\nevidence be found, it is of no consequence that the trial court believing other evidence, or\ndrawing other reasonable inferences, might have reached a contrary conclusion.\n[Citations.]” (Bowers v. Bernards (1984) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2121404\"><a href=\"/opinion/2121404/bowers-v-bernards/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 873-874 (Bowers).)\n       However, substantial evidence must be “‘of ponderable legal significance.” (Kuhn\nv. Department of General Services (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2246467\"><a href=\"/opinion/2246467/kuhn-v-department-of-general-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1627</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1633.) It must be\nreasonable, credible, and of solid value. (Ibid.) “The ultimate determination is whether a\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\freasonable trier of fact could have found for the respondent based on the whole record.\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n       B. The doctrine of alter ego\n       “Ordinarily, a corporation is regarded as a legal entity, separate and distinct from\nits stockholders, officers and directors, with separate and distinct liabilities and\nobligations. [Citations.]” (Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2250866\"><a href=\"/opinion/2250866/sonora-diamond-corp-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538 (Sonora).) However, the corporate identity may be disregarded,\nand the corporate veil pierced, “where an abuse of the corporate privilege justifies\nholding the equitable ownership of a corporation liable for the actions of the corporation.\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.) Thus, under the alter ego doctrine, “when the corporate form is used\nto perpetrate a fraud, circumvent a statute, or accomplish some other wrongful or\ninequitable purpose, the courts will ignore the corporate entity and deem the\ncorporation’s acts to be those of the persons or organizations actually controlling the\ncorporation, in most instances the equitable owners. [Citations.]” (Ibid.)\n       Two conditions must be met before the alter ego doctrine will be invoked: “First,\nthere must be such unity of interest and ownership between the corporation and its\nequitable owner that the separate personalities of the corporation and the shareholder do\nnot in reality exist. Second, there must be an inequitable result if the acts in question are\ntreated as those of the corporation alone. [Citations.]” (Sonora, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at\np. 538.) “Alter ego is an extreme remedy, sparingly used. [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 539.)\n       Numerous factors may be considered in deciding whether to apply the doctrine of\nalter ego. As set forth in Associated Vendors, Inc. v. Oakland Meat Co. (1962) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2211258\"><a href=\"/opinion/2211258/associated-vendors-inc-v-oakland-meat-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

[Citation.]” (Sonora, supra, 83\nCal.App.4th at p. 539.)\n       C. The evidence supports the trial court’s alter ego determination\n       The evidence showed that several of the factors listed above were present during\nthe time of respondents’ employment. Mohamed diverted corporate assets for his\npersonal use, such as using the company supervisor’s truck as his own personal vehicle;\nusing company employees to do personal errands such as shop for groceries, watch his\nchildren, run his personal errands, and perform maintenance on his personal vehicles. In\naddition, Mohamed used the business address for personal reasons when he permitted his\nfather to stay there for extended periods of time.\n\n\n                                              8\n\f          There was also evidence that Mohamed failed to maintain adequate and customary\nrecords for Explorer 1. No operating agreement or statements of information were\nproduced in the trial court. In addition, insufficient records of employee hours and pay\nwere maintained.\n          There was also evidence of commingling of funds between Mohamed’s own\npersonal funds and the company’s funds. Although Mohamed managed the company, he\nnever paid himself any wages, and he covered the company’s losses personally, paying\nfor property, equipment, payroll and supplies. In addition, the station out of which\nExplorer 1 operates is owned half by Mohamed and half by the company, although\nMohamed testified that the company pays the full mortgage.3 Mohamed testified that\nExplorer 1 pays rent to Mohamed, and he in turn lends that money back to the company.\nMohamed has never received income from the company and it has never been profitable.\nIn sum, as the trial court noted, Explorer 1 has never operated as a viable entity. Instead,\nMohamed operates Explorer 1 as a personal business. Mohamed exercised domination\nand control of Explorer 1 and its employees, in particular by asserting his sole discretion\nas to how many hours to pay each employee, regardless of how many hours the employee\nactually worked.\n          This evidence supports the trial court’s determination that Mohamed was the alter\nego of Explorer 1, and that the doctrine should apply to pierce the corporate veil in this\ncase.\n          Appellants argue that the trial court made two errors in applying the alter ego\ndoctrine: first, it imposed alter ego liability on Mohamed merely because it found\nExplorer 1 to be undercapitalized; and (2) it confused undercapitalization with operating\nlosses.\n          We reject Mohamed’s claims. Initially, we note that the trial court did not rely\nexclusively on undercapitalization in imposing alter ego liability. The court indicated\norally that its decision was based “principally” on the facts that the court raised during\n\n3     However, Mohamed later testified that the full mortgage is automatically\nwithdrawn from his personal account.\n\n                                                9\n\fargument. During argument, the court noted that the business was operating at a loss\nfrom the beginning; that the business did not file tax returns; and that the business was\nnever profitable. The court’s use of the term “principally” suggests that, while these\nfinancial factors were a large part of its decision, they were not the only factors it\nconsidered.4\n       In addition, the trial court did not specifically discuss undercapitalization but\ninstead focused on the fact that the business was consistently operating at a loss. This\nsuggests the court was also taking into consideration the practical consequences of\nExplorer 1’s poor financial condition, such as the commingling of funds that was going\non between Mohamed and Explorer 1 and Mohamed’s assumption of Explorer 1’s\nliabilities for debts such as payroll and equipment. The unhealthy financial condition of\nExplorer 1 -- which the trial court properly considered -- was closely linked with other\nfactors which were also properly considered in determining alter ego.5\n       Appellants also object to the trial court’s consideration of three other factors: (1)\nthat Explorer 1 did not offer a written operating agreement; (2) that Explorer 1 did not\nfile tax returns; and (3) that Mohamed was not an employee of the company, but\nnonetheless managed its affairs. Appellants argue that none of these factors support an\nalter ego finding.\n       While there was testimony that Explorer 1 did not provide an operating agreement,\nappellants cite no place in the record where the trial court specifically emphasized a\n\n4      We are not required to rely on the trial court’s comments from the bench during\noral argument to ascertain the court’s reasoning. In a non-jury trial, the appellant was\npermitted to preserve the court’s reasoning in a statement of decision pursuant to Code of\nCivil Procedure section 632. (Slavin v. Borinstein (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2291536\"><a href=\"/opinion/2291536/slavin-v-borinstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 718.)\nThere is no statement of decision in the record. “In the absence of a statement of\ndecision, the appellate court will presume that the trial court made all factual findings\nnecessary to support the judgment for which substantial evidence exists in the record.\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n\n5       Appellants do not point to evidence in the record showing any confusion on the\npart of the trial court as to the difference between undercapitalization and operating loss,\ntherefore we decline to address this argument.\n\n                                              10\n\fconcern over this fact. However, assuming the trial court did consider Explorer 1’s lack\nof an operating agreement, we find that such consideration did not constitute error.\nFailure to maintain adequate corporate records is a legitimate consideration in making a\ndetermination of alter ego. (Associated Vendors, supra, 210 Cal.App.2d at pp. 838-840.)\nAppellants point out that an oral operating agreement is sufficient under former\nCorporations Code section 17001, however they point to no testimony suggesting that\nsuch an oral operating agreement existed. Under the circumstances, the trial court was\nentitled to consider the lack of an operating agreement as evidence of alter ego. As\nrespondents pointed out in closing argument, Mohamed was commingling his assets. He\nwas meeting payroll by funding the operation with his own money. While he ran the\nwhole operation, he had no official title and did not pay himself. He essentially ran the\ncompany as he liked, without an operating agreement. The trial court’s consideration of\nthis evidence was proper.\n       Appellants next attack the trial court’s consideration of Explorer 1’s failure to file\ntax returns. As a single-member limited liability company (LLC), appellants argue,\nExplorer 1 is disregarded for tax purposes and is not required to file tax returns.\nAppellants cite 26 Code of Federal Regulations part 301.7701-3(b)(ii) (2015), which\nstates that a domestic entity may elect to be “[d]isregarded as an entity separate from its\nowner if it has a single owner.” While this regulation permits a single-member LLC to\nelect to be disregarded as a separate entity, it does not suggest that doing so may not be\nconsidered as evidence of alter ego liability. In fact, Mohamed’s failure to segregate the\nfinances of Explorer 1 from his own was a factor the trial court was permitted to consider\nin making its determination of alter ego. (Associated Vendors, supra, 210 Cal.App.2d at\npp. 838-840.)\n       As to Mohamed’s status as an individual who was not employed by Explorer 1,\nappellants cite former Corporations Code section 17157, subdivision (b)(2), which stated\nthat “Every manager is an agent of the limited liability company for the purpose of its\nbusiness or affairs.” (Added Stats. 1994, ch. 1200, § 27; amended Stats. 2012, ch. 419,\n§ 19, repealed Jan. 1, 2014.) Again, nothing in this section suggests it was improper for\n\n\n                                             11\n\fthe trial court to consider Mohamed’s lack of employment by the company in making its\ndetermination of alter ego. The fact that Mohamed managed the daily affairs of the\ncompany without accepting any pay suggests that he was treating the assets and\nemployees of the company as his own, which was a factor the court was entitled to\nconsider. (Associated Vendors, supra, 210 Cal.App.2d at pp. 838-840.)\n       Appellants list evidence that contradicts the evidence presented in favor of a\nfinding of alter ego. However, where there is “substantial evidence, contradicted or\nuncontradicted, which will support the determination, and when two or more inferences\ncan reasonably be deduced from the facts, a reviewing court is without power to\nsubstitute its deductions for those of the trial court.” (Bowers, supra, 150 Cal.App.3d at\npp. 873-874.) Substantial evidence exists in the record to support the trial court’s finding\nthat application of the alter ego doctrine was proper in this case.6\nII. Agreement to exclude sleep time from 24-hour shifts\n       Appellants next argue that the trial court erred in making its factual finding that\nKirner and Richard had no agreement or understanding to exclude sleep time from 24-\nhour shifts. Again, the substantial evidence standard applies.\n\n\n\n\n6       In their reply brief, appellants raise the argument that there was no evidence to\nsupport the idea that recognizing Explorer 1 as a distinct entity would create an\ninequitable result or injustice. (See Sonora, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at p. 538 [before\napplication of the alter ego doctrine, the fact finder must find that “there [will] be an\ninequitable result if the acts in question are treated as those of the corporation alone”].)\n“[W]e need not consider new issues raised for the first time in a reply brief in the absence\nof good cause.” (In re Marriage of Ackerman (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2293041\"><a href=\"/opinion/2293041/in-re-marriage-of-ackerman/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 214.)\nAppellants have failed to show good cause. However, we note that in the context of an\nalter ego finding, inequity or injustice may be shown when “‘“there is such a unity of\ninterest and ownership that the individuality, or separateness, of such person and\ncorporation has ceased, and that the facts are such that an adherence to the fiction of the\nseparate existence of the corporation would, under the particular circumstances, sanction\na fraud or promote injustice.”’ [Citations.]” (Associated Vendors, supra, 210 Cal.App.2d\nat p. 837.) Substantial evidence, discussed throughout this opinion, was found in the\nrecord to support the trial court’s implied finding that such circumstances were present.\n\n                                             12\n\f      A. Applicable law\n      Section 1173 authorizes the IWC to promulgate orders regulating wages, hours\nand working conditions throughout the state. (§ 1173; Monzon v. Schaefer Ambulance\nService, Inc. (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2127953\"><a href=\"/opinion/2127953/monzon-v-schaefer-ambulance-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 29 (Monzon).) The IWC has promulgated wage\norder No. 9, codified in California Code of Regulations, title 8, section 11090 (wage\norder No. 9).\n      Subdivision 2(G) of wage order No. 9 states that “‘Hours worked’ means the time\nduring which an employee is subject to the control of an employer, and includes all the\ntime the employee is suffered or permitted to work, whether or not required to do so.”\n      Subdivision 3(A)(1) of wage order No. 9 states:\n             “The following overtime provisions are applicable to employees 18\n      years of age or over and to employees 16 or 17 years of age who are not\n      required by law to attend school and are not otherwise prohibited by law\n      from engaging in the subject work. Such employees shall not be employed\n      more than eight (8) hours in any workday or more than 40 hours in any\n      workweek unless the employee receives one and one-half (1 ½) times such\n      employee’s regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 hours in the\n      workweek. Eight (8) hours of labor constitutes a day’s work. Employment\n      beyond eight (8) hours in any workday or more than six (6) days in any\n      workweek is permissible provided the employee is compensated for such\n      overtime at not less than:\n\n             “(a) One and one-half (1 ½) times the employee’s regular rate of\n      pay for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours up to and including 12\n      hours in any workday, and for the first eight (8) hours worked on the\n      seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a workweek; and\n\n             “(b) Double the employee’s regular rate of pay for all hours worked\n      in excess of 12 hours in any workday and for all hours worked in excess of\n      eight (8) hours on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a\n      workweek.”\n\n      Subdivision 3(K) of wage order No. 9 states:\n             “The daily overtime provision of subsection (A) above shall not\n      apply to ambulance drivers and attendants scheduled for 24-hour shifts of\n      duty who have agreed in writing to exclude from daily time worked not\n      more than three (3) meal periods of not more than one (1) hour each and a\n\n\n                                            13\n\f       regularly scheduled uninterrupted sleeping period of not more than eight (8)\n       hours. The employer shall provide adequate dormitory and kitchen\n       facilities for employees on such a schedule.”\n\n       Thus, the language of wage order No. 9 suggests that any agreement for\nambulance drivers to receive less than 24 hours pay must be in writing. However, in\nMonzon, this court held that “it is permissible for an employer and ambulance drivers and\nattendants to enter into an agreement, which need not be written, to exclude up to eight\nhours of sleep time from work or compensable time on twenty-four-hour shifts if\nadequate sleeping facilities are provided by the employer and the employee has the\nopportunity to get at least five hours of uninterrupted sleep.” (Monzon, supra, 224\nCal.App.3d at p. 46.)\n       The court further held that “since an agreement to exclude sleep time from\ncompensable time is an exception to the requirement that employees be paid for ‘hours\nworked,’ it is the burden of the employer to prove that an agreement exists and what the\nterms of the agreement are.” (Monzon, supra, 224 Cal.App.3d at p. 46.)\n       Justice Johnson wrote a separate concurring and dissenting opinion in Monzon,\narguing in part that the California regulation provides, in no uncertain terms, that any\nexclusion of sleep and mealtime from “hours worked” must be in the form of a written\nagreement. (Monzon, supra, 224 Cal.App.3d at p. 50.)\n       B. Substantial evidence supports the trial court’s decision that no agreement --\nwritten or verbal -- to receive less than 24 hours pay existed\n       The trial court acknowledged that Monzon indicates that a verbal agreement to\nreceive less than 24 hours pay, if proved, would be sufficient. However, the trial court\nfound that no verbal agreement was proved in this case.\n       Appellants argue that the trial court’s decision was not supported by substantial\nevidence. Appellants point out that Kirner and Richard signed weekly time sheets on\nnumerous occasions reflecting their understanding that they would be paid 16 hours for a\n24-hour shift. Appellants also point out that Kirner and Richard acknowledged in writing\nthat (1) they had reviewed the hours in those timesheets, and (2) the resulting payment\n\n\n                                             14\n\fwas accurate and correct. Appellants claim that this evidence shows that Kirner and\nRichard clearly understood their pay arrangement.\n        However, contrary evidence existed in the record. Each of the respondents\ntestified that there was no agreement or understanding regarding their pay for 24-hour\nshifts. The trial court clearly weighed and considered the evidence on both sides of this\nissue. The court stated: “We have three plaintiffs testifying against one defendant. The\ndefendant says they looked at, read, and agreed to the shift scheduling documents that are\nnot signed. We got [sic] plaintiffs that said they did not. We also got [sic] Mr. Bowers\nwho said that he did not agree. So I think that on the scale and by the standard that I have\nto measure the evidence, I would like to find for the plaintiffs.”\n        In addition, as respondents point out, Mohamed’s own actions undermine his\nclaim that he had an agreement to pay respondents less than 24 hours for a 24-hour shift.\nUnder the terms of the purported agreement, set forth in the unsigned shift scheduling\ndocument, Mohamed stated that he agreed to pay respondents 13 hours out of a 24-hour\nshift. However, the evidence showed that the amount that respondents were paid for the\n24-hour shifts was random, reflecting no consistent pattern. They were paid anywhere\nfrom 13 to 24 hours for the shifts, depending on how much “incentive” pay Mohamed\nelected to pay them.\n        The time sheets also do not provide evidence of a written or oral agreement\nregarding pay for 24-hour shifts. Respondents testified that they were forced to sign the\nsheets or lose their jobs. When they did question the accuracy of the time sheets,\nMohamed would inform respondents that if they didn’t like it, they could leave. Such\ncoercion does not constitute the type of agreement or understanding required under the\nlaw.7\n\n7      We note that in Monzon “[t]he deposition testimony of each employee\ndemonstrated that he understood that he would not be paid for eight hours of\nuninterrupted sleep.” (Monzon, supra, 224 Cal.App.3d at p. 24.) Here, there was no\ntestimony suggesting that respondents had any idea how Mohamed came up with the\nnumber of hours for which he paid them. Respondents testified that there were no\nscheduled breaks, and there was no way to keep track of hours worked or sleep time.\n\n                                             15\n\f       In sum, substantial evidence supports the trial court’s decision that no written or\noral agreement existed between appellants and respondents regarding payment of less\nthan 24 hours for a 24-hour shift.8\nIII. Section 558 penalties\n       Appellants argue that the trial court erred in awarding penalties under section 558.\nAppellants argue that the statute is only enforceable via investigation and citation by “the\nLabor Commissioner” (§ 558, subd. (b)), and that a private plaintiff cannot bring a claim\nfor penalties under section 558 unless he utilizes the procedures in the Labor Code\nPrivate Attorneys General Act (PAGA) (§ 2698 et seq.). Appellants claim that because\nrespondents never utilized the procedures under PAGA, or even alleged in their\ncomplaint that they did so, the trial court erred in awarding penalties under section 558.\n       A. Applicable law\n       Section 558 provides for civil penalties for an employer who violates “a section of\nthis chapter or any provision regulating hours and days of work in any order of the\nIndustrial Welfare Commission.” (§ 558, subd. (a).) However, the statute specifies that\nit is enforceable by investigation and citation by the Labor Commissioner. (§ 558, subd.\n(b).) Thus, on the face of the statute, there is no private right of action for penalties under\nsection 558.\n\n\nRespondents were never paid overtime, no matter how many hours they worked in a day\nor in a week. Respondents testified that they never agreed that they would not get paid\nfor time that they were sleeping or not running calls.\n\n8      Because we have determined that the evidence supports the trial court’s decision\nthat no agreement or understanding existed between respondents and appellants to\nexclude sleep time from 24-hour shifts, we need not reach the question of whether\nrespondents were given the opportunity to receive, or usually received, five hours of\nuninterrupted sleep. (See Monzon, supra, 224 Cal.App.3d at p. 46 [“it is permissible for\nan employer and ambulance drivers and attendants to enter into an agreement, which\nneed not be written, to exclude up to eight hours of sleep time from work or compensable\ntime on twenty-four-hour shifts if adequate sleeping facilities are provided by the\nemployer and the employee has the opportunity to get at least five hours of uninterrupted\nsleep”].)\n\n\n                                              16\n\f       However, PAGA, which became effective January 1, 2004, allows employees to\n“bring a civil action to collect civil penalties for Labor Code violations previously only\navailable in enforcement actions initiated by the state’s labor law enforcement agencies.\n[Citations.]” (Caliber Bodyworks, Inc. v. Superior Court (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n374 (Caliber), fn. omitted.) Section 2699.5 specifically identifies the Labor Code\nprovisions enforceable under PAGA. Those provisions include sections 203, 226,\nsubdivision (a), 510, 1194, and 1198, violations of which were alleged in the first four\ncauses of action in respondents’ complaint.9 (§ 2699.5.)\n       “The Act was amended shortly after its effective date . . . to, among other things,\nrequire exhaustion of administrative procedures before an action may be filed to allow\nthe [Labor and Workforce Development Agency] the initial opportunity to investigate\nand cite employers for Labor Code violations.” (Caliber, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at p.\n375, fn. omitted.) Section 2699.3, subdivision (a), provides the administrative procedures\nthat must be followed before an aggrieved employee may file a civil action to recover\ncivil penalties under section 2699 for violations of any of the Labor Code provisions\nidentified in section 2699.5:\n               “(a) A civil action by an aggrieved employee . . . alleging a\n       violation of any provision listed in Section 2699.5 shall commence only\n       after the following requirements have been met:\n\n              “(1) The aggrieved employee or representative shall give written\n       notice by certified mail to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency\n       and the employer of the specific provisions of this code alleged to have\n       been violated, including the facts and theories to support the alleged\n       violation.\n\n9      While section 558 is not specifically identified in section 2699.5, respondents’\ncomplaint alleged substantive violations of the above-referenced statutory provisions\nwhich are named in section 2699.5. “[I]t is the request for civil penalties for an alleged\nviolation of a substantive statutory provision listed in section 2699.5” that triggers the\nemployee’s right to bring an action under PAGA. (Caliber, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at p.\n379, fn. 15.) Respondents’ fifth cause of action for civil penalties under section 558\nsought civil penalties for violations of substantive provisions which are named in section\n2699.5. Thus, the PAGA is applicable to respondents’ request for penalties under section\n558. (Caliber, at p. 379 & fn. 15.)\n\n                                             17\n\f              “(2)(A) The agency shall notify the employer and the aggrieved\n       employee or representative by certified mail that it does not intend to\n       investigate the alleged violation within 30 calendar days of the postmark\n       date of the notice received pursuant to paragraph (1). Upon receipt of that\n       notice or if no notice is provided within 33 calendar days of the postmark\n       date of the notice given pursuant to paragraph (1), the aggrieved employee\n       may commence a civil action pursuant to Section 2699.\n\n(§ 2699.3, subd. (a)(1) & (2)(A).)\n       B. Forfeiture\n       We first address respondents’ claim that appellants have forfeited their right to\nraise the issue of whether respondents exhausted their administrative remedies, as\nrequired under PAGA. Respondents argue that an appellant cannot assert a new theory of\ndefense on appeal. (Citing Bardis v. Oates (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2292160\"><a href=\"/opinion/2292160/bardis-v-oates/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Appellants\nalso argue that an appellant who permitted a case to be tried on the assumption that the\ncomplaint stated a cause of action may be precluded from challenging the sufficiency of\nthe complaint for the first time on appeal. (Citing Nelson v. Department of Alcoholic\nBeverage Control (1959) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1299257\"><a href=\"/opinion/1299257/nelson-v-dept-alcoholic-bev-control/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(Campbell v. Regents of University of California\n(2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2508480\"><a href=\"/opinion/2508480/campbell-v-regents-of-univ-of-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">311</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 321.) Exhaustion of administrative remedies “‘is not a matter of\njudicial discretion, but is a fundamental rule of procedure . . . binding upon all courts.’\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.) However, recent case law has suggested that a defendant waives the\ndefense of exhaustion by failing to timely assert it in the trial court. (Mokler v. County of\nOrange (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2255358\"><a href=\"/opinion/2255358/mokler-v-county-of-orange/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 135 (Mokler); Green v. City of Oceanside (1987)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2151457\"><a href=\"/opinion/2151457/green-v-city-of-oceanside/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 239 (Green).) The rationale presented in these cases is that\nexhaustion is a “judicially created rule of procedure, which the courts should not allow a\n\n\n                                              18\n\fparty to use inequitably.” (Mokler, supra, at p. 134.) “As Green observed, ‘We think it\nwould be grossly unfair to allow a defendant to ignore this potential procedural defense at\na time when facts and memories were fresh and put a plaintiff to the time and expense of\na full trial, knowing it could assert the failure to exhaust administrative remedies if it\nreceived an adverse jury verdict. The exhaustion doctrine is simply a “procedural\nprerequisite” [citation] the City decided to forego. . . .’ [Citation.]” (Mokler, at pp. 134-\n135.)\n        While Mokler and Green make it clear that we may apply the waiver doctrine to a\nclaim of failure to exhaust administrative remedies, we find that under the circumstances\nof this case, application of the doctrine here is inappropriate. While it is true that\nrespondents never raised the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies, the question\nof whether respondents were asserting PAGA claims was directly raised by the judge\nduring trial. The court had before it the respondents’ complaint, and asked directly: “Are\nthere PAGA claims?” Respondents’ counsel responded, “No PAGA.”\n        Respondents’ counsel’s affirmative representation in open court that there were no\nPAGA claims in this case carried with it an implicit representation that exhaustion of\nadministrative remedies was not an issue. While this response was likely an error rather\nthan a deliberate attempt to mislead the court and the parties, it is also likely that the\nparties would be in different positions on appeal if respondents’ counsel had answered\nthe question accurately. Under the circumstances, we find that respondents are estopped\nfrom arguing that appellants waived the exhaustion argument by not raising it in the trial\ncourt. Respondents’ erroneous response to the trial court’s direct question could easily\nhave misled not only the court but the appellants into thinking that exhaustion was\nunnecessary in this case. Respondents may not provide inaccurate information regarding\nthe prerequisites for their claims, then argue waiver of any claims regarding those\nprerequisites. Under the circumstances, we find that appellants have not forfeited this\nissue, and it must be decided on the merits.\n\n\n\n\n                                               19\n\f       C. Reconsideration of section 558 penalties by the trial court is appropriate\n       Respondents’ counsel’s misstatement in court caused the trial court to award\nsection 558 penalties without consideration of whether respondents had exhausted their\nadministrative remedies. On appeal, respondents dispute that they failed to utilize the\nprocedures required under PAGA. While respondents’ representation to the trial court\nthat no PAGA claims were being made suggests that they did not avail themselves of\nthose procedures, there remains some factual ambiguity as to whether or not respondents\ncomplied with PAGA prior to bringing their section 558 claim. We cannot make such a\nfactual determination on appeal.\n       In addition, respondents concede on appeal that the statute of limitations for\nsection 558 is one year (see Code Civ. Proc., § 340, subd. (a)), and thus that they were\nawarded more penalties than they should have been under the statute.10\n       Finally, appellants argue that the trial court erroneously awarded heightened\n“subsequent violation” penalties. Section 558, subdivision (a)(1), provides that for an\ninitial violation, the civil penalty shall be $50 for each underpaid employee for the pay\nperiod for which the employee was underpaid; and for each subsequent violation, the\ncivil penalty shall be $100 for each underpaid employee for the pay period for which the\nemployee was underpaid. (§ 558, subd. (a)(1) & (2).) “Until the employer has been\nnotified that it is violating a Labor Code provision . . . , the employer cannot be presumed\nto be aware that its continuing underpayment of employees is a ‘violation’ subject to\npenalties.” (Amaral v. Cintas Corp. No. 2 (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2265791\"><a href=\"/opinion/2265791/amaral-v-cintas-corp-no-2/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1157</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1208-1209.)\n“However, after the employer has learned its conduct violates the Labor Code, the\nemployer is on notice that any future violations will be punished just the same as\n\n\n10     Appellants argue that because the complaint was filed on December 31, 2012,\nrespondents could only recover penalties for pay periods occurring on or after December\n31, 2011. Because Stickler’s employment ended in October 2011, appellants argue, he\nshould not have received any penalties at all. Kirner could only recover penalties for pay\nperiods occurring between December 31, 2011 and September 6, 2012, and Richard\ncould only recover penalties for pay periods occurring between December 31, 2011 and\nJune 2012, when his employment ended.\n\n                                            20\n\fviolations that are willful or intentional -- i.e., they will be punished at twice the rate of\npenalties that could have been imposed or that were imposed for the initial violation.”\n(Id. at p. 1209.)\n       Appellants argue that there is no evidence in the record that they ever received\nnotice from a court or commissioner that they were in violation of the Labor Code. Thus,\nthe heightened “subsequent violation” penalties were erroneous.\n       Under the circumstances, we must reverse and remand the award of section 558\npenalties to the trial court for reconsideration. The trial court should consider: (1)\nwhether respondents complied with the exhaustion requirements of PAGA in order to\nproperly claim an award of penalties under section 558; and, if so, (2) the appropriate\namount of such penalties, taking into consideration the relevant statute of limitations; and\n(3) whether notice of the initial violations was provided to appellants, justifying\nheightened subsequent violation penalties.\n                                       DISPOSITION\n       The portion of the judgment regarding penalties awarded under section 558 is\nreversed and remanded with instructions to the trial court to reconsider the award in view\nof this opinion.
