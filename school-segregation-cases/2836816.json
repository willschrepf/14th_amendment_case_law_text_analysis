This case, which has a procedural history\n\nspanning more than thirty years, involves a civil-rights action brought by Michigan prisoners alleging\n\nunconstitutional conditions of confinement. The subjects of this consolidated appeal are two orders\n\nentered by the district court on March 31, 2009, and September 10, 2009, which relate respectively\n\nto the injunctive relief ordered in November 2006 and the plaintiffs’ motion to add four new class\n\nrepresentatives. With respect to the March 31, 2009 order, we AFFIRM the district court’s\n\ntermination of the relief granted in November 2006. We hold that we lack jurisdiction to consider\n\nthe September 10, 2009 order, however, because the district court denied without prejudice the\n\n\n\n\n       *\n         The Honorable Daniel M. Friedman, United States Circuit Judge for the Federal Circuit,\nsitting by designation.\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\nmotion to add new named plaintiffs, and the district court has not yet considered the merits of the\n\nmotion in the first instance.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n        In 1980, Everett Hadix and ten other prisoners brought a class action in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on behalf of all prisoners incarcerated at the State\n\nPrison of Southern Michigan, Central Complex (“SPSM-CC”) against various state prison officials.\n\nBrought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the complaint alleged unconstitutional conditions of\n\nconfinement. In 1985, the parties entered into a comprehensive Consent Decree, which was later\n\napproved by the district court, addressing various aspects of prison life, including safety, sanitation,\n\nhygiene, and protection from harm. The Consent Decree stated that its provisions were “intended\n\nby the parties to assure the constitutionality of the conditions under which prisoners are incarcerated\n\nat SPSM-CC,” although the decree contained neither an admission of liability on the part of the state\n\nprison officials nor any findings of constitutional violations. Joint Appendix (“J.A.”) in No. 09-1424\n\nat 392 (Consent Decree).\n\n        Section II.B. of the Consent Decree addresses mental-health issues inside the SPSM. The\n\nmandates of these provisions were officially terminated on January 8, 2001, but, in response to the\n\ntragic death of an inmate suffering from mental-health problems in 2006, the district court reopened\n\nseveral aspects of the mental-health-care provisions of the Consent Decree in November 2006.\n\nSpecifically, the district court reopened section II.B., “limited to the provisions of [the November\n\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\n2006] Order and Preliminary Injunction.” R. 2187 (November 13, 2006 D. Ct. Order at 1). The\n\ndistrict court ordered that the defendants comply with the following:\n\n        •       “immediately cease and desist from the practice of using any form of punitive\n                mechanical restraints within Hadix facilities, and [] timely develop practices,\n                protocols and policies to enforce this limitation”;\n\n        •       “immediately work to develop a staffing plan for adequate psychiatric and\n                psychological staffing at Hadix facilities to ensure that routine and emergent\n                psychiatric and psychological services are provided in a timely way”;\n\n        •       “immediately work to provide daily psychologist or psychiatrist rounds in the\n                segregation unit at the Hadix facilities”; and\n\n        •       “immediately work to develop protocols for the coordination of mental health\n                and medical staff, and [] require weekly conferences of the two disciplines\n                which shall include . . . the treatment of prisoners in the segregation unit, and\n                which shall include necessary training to prevent staff and administrative\n                indifference to the provision of care . . . .”\n\nId. at 1–3 (emphasis removed). The district court also permitted the plaintiffs to undertake\n\n“discovery as to mental health care in advance of a final injunctive hearing.” Id.\n\n        In ordering this preliminary injunctive relief, the district court was mindful of the\n\nrequirements of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), which permits injunctive relief relating\n\nto prison conditions only if the district court finds that such relief is necessary to correct a violation\n\nof a federal right:\n\n        Prospective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions shall extend\n        no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular\n        plaintiff or plaintiffs. The court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief\n        unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than\n        necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means\n        necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right. The court shall give\n\n\n                                                    3\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\n        substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a\n        criminal justice system caused by the relief.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A). In the November 2006 order, the district court found that the use of\n\nmechanical restraints, the inadequate mental-health-professional staffing levels, the lack of daily\n\nrounds by a psychologist, and the absence of a protocol for coordination of the medical and mental-\n\nhealth staff constituted deliberate indifference, in violation of the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and\n\nUnusual Punishments Clause.\n\n        After the November 2006 injunction was entered, this court heard several appeals in this case\n\nrelating to the injunctive relief and other matters. See Hadix v. Caruso, 297 F. App’x 504, 2008 WL\n\n4659809 (6th Cir. 2008) (unpublished opinion); Hadix v. Caruso, 248 F. App’x 678, 2007 WL\n\n2753026 (6th Cir. 2007) (unpublished opinion). The parties also filed two motions in the district\n\ncourt in anticipation of a hearing on permanent injunctive relief. The defendants filed a motion to\n\nterminate the injunctive relief granted in November 2006, R. 2684, and the plaintiffs filed a motion\n\nfor further injunctive relief, R. 2757. Ultimately, the district court ruled in favor of the defendants\n\non both motions, R.2903 (March 31, 2009 D. Ct. Op.), prompting the plaintiffs’ appeal in No. 09-\n\n1424. Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a motion to add four new class representatives because the\n\nprevious—and sole remaining—named plaintiff was no longer a member of the Hadix class due to\n\nthe fact that the facility at which he resided was determined to be no longer a Hadix facility. R.2915.\n\nThe district court denied this motion without prejudice in an unnumbered docket entry on September\n\n4, 2009, “pending outcome of the current appeal.” In response to the plaintiffs’ motion for\n\nreconsideration of this order, R.2947, the district court stated that the motion for reconsideration was\n\n                                                   4\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\ndenied without prejudice because “it is prudent to await the decision of the Court of Appeals, so that\n\nall parties will have the benefit of that ruling before addressing the issues raised by Plaintiff’s motion\n\n. . .,” R. 2949 at 1. The plaintiffs’ appeal from this denial of reconsideration constitutes the second\n\npart of this appeal, No. 09-2255.\n\n       II. The Termination Of Relief Relating To The Mental-Health-Care Provisions\n\n        The plaintiffs-appellants’ appeal of the district court’s March 31, 2009 opinion and order\n\naddresses both the district court’s decision to terminate the limited, preliminary injunctive relief it\n\ngranted in November 2006, and the district court’s decision not to grant any new, additional\n\ninjunctive relief. We have jurisdiction to consider this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a). In\n\naddition, we review “decision[s] to grant or deny a preliminary or permanent injunction” for abuse\n\nof discretion. Kallstrom v. City of Columbus, 136 F.3d 1055, 1067 (6th Cir. 1998). “In determining\n\nwhether the district court abused its discretion, we review the district court’s findings of fact for clear\n\nerror and its legal conclusions de novo.” Hadix v. Johnson, 182 F.3d 400, 404 (6th Cir. 1999)\n\n(quoting Sandison v. Mich. High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 64 F.3d 1026, 1030 (6th Cir. 1995)). We will\n\noverrule “the district court’s weighing and balancing of the equities . . . only in the rarest of cases.”\n\nId. (quoting Six Clinics Holding Corp., II v. Cafcomp Sys., Inc., 119 F.3d 393, 400 (6th Cir. 1997)).\n\n        In addition to requiring the existence of a violation of a federal right before a district court\n\nmay grant injunctive relief in a conditions-of-confinement case, the PLRA contains several other\n\nprovisions providing for immediate termination of injunctive relief improperly granted and\n\n\n\n\n                                                    5\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\naddressing the ability of the plaintiffs to keep in effect relief previously granted. These provisions\n\nremain focused on the existence of a violation of a federal right:\n\n        (2) Immediate termination of prospective relief.—In any civil action with respect to\n        prison conditions, a defendant or intervener shall be entitled to the immediate\n        termination of any prospective relief if the relief was approved or granted in the\n        absence of a finding by the court that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further\n        than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive\n        means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\n\n        (3) Limitation.—Prospective relief shall not terminate if the court makes written\n        findings based on the record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a\n        current and ongoing violation of the Federal right, extends no further than necessary\n        to correct the violation of the Federal right, and that the prospective relief is narrowly\n        drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(2)–(3). Under this standard, the defendants could obtain termination of the\n\nrelief granted in the 2006 injunction if they convinced the district court that there was no longer a\n\n“current and ongoing” constitutional violation. On the other hand, the plaintiffs could prevent the\n\ntermination of the 2006 injunctive relief if the district court found that there was still a “current and\n\nongoing” constitutional violation, and that “the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least\n\nintrusive means to correct the violation.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3).\n\n        The district court heard testimony from both sides over seven days of hearings in April, May,\n\nJune, and August of 2008, after which it issued a decision holding that there were no longer any\n\nconstitutional violations in relation to the provision of mental-health care, that the plaintiffs had not\n\nshown any violations of the Consent Decree when seeking new injunctive relief, and that the state\n\nhad complied with the requirements of the 2006 injunction. R.2903 (March 31, 2009 D. Ct. Op.).\n\n\n\n                                                    6\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\nThe district court therefore terminated all relief relating to mental-health care, resulting in the\n\ncomplete termination of section II.B. of the Consent Decree.1\n\n        With respect to the termination of relief already in effect from November 2006, the plaintiffs\n\nassert that the district court erred by applying the wrong standard for an Eighth Amendment\n\ndeliberate-indifference violation and by failing to make certain necessary findings of fact under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a). The plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in not\n\nmodifying the Consent Decree, and in making clearly erroneous findings regarding the defendants’\n\nefforts to comply with the 2006 injunction. With respect to the district court’s refusal to grant\n\nadditional prospective relief, apart from that granted in November 2006, the plaintiffs assert that the\n\ndistrict court again applied the wrong standard for deliberate indifference and failed to modify the\n\nConsent Decree or otherwise to find a breach of the Consent Decree by the defendants. For the\n\nreasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\nA. The District Court’s Conclusion That There Is No Eighth Amendment Violation\n\n        A claim of deliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment contains two components,\n\none objective and one subjective. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994); Comstock v.\n\nMcCrary, 273 F.3d 693, 702 (6th Cir. 2001). The objective component requires that the plaintiff\n\nshow a deprivation that is “sufficiently serious,” one that “pos[es] a substantial risk of serious harm.”\n\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 834. The subjective component requires that the plaintiff show that the prison\n\n\n        1\n        We note, however, that several portions of the Consent Decree—apart from the mental-\nhealth provisions of section II.B.—remain open. Therefore, the termination of the mental-health\nprovisions will not, in and of itself, end the entire case.\n\n                                                   7\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\nofficials had a “sufficiently culpable state of mind,” specifically that “the official knows of and\n\ndisregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from\n\nwhich the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also\n\ndraw the inference.” Id. at 834, 837.\n\n        The plaintiffs claim that Farmer indicates that proof of the subjective component is not\n\nnecessary when a party is seeking only injunctive relief, and that a previous opinion of this court in\n\nthis litigation removes that requirement completely. Plaintiffs Br. in No. 09-1424 at 34–36 (citing\n\nHadix v. Johnson, 367 F.3d 513, 526 (6th Cir. 2004)). We need not reach this issue, however,\n\nbecause, for the reasons that follow, even if the plaintiffs are correct that proof of only the objective\n\ncomponent was necessary, we would affirm on the basis of the district court’s conclusion that there\n\nis no longer a “current and ongoing” constitutional violation.\n\n        First, it is important to put the injunctive relief at issue here in context. The November 2006\n\nreopening of the Consent Decree was a “limited” one from the beginning, R. 2187 (November 13,\n\n2006 D. Ct. Order at 1), requiring only “specific, measurable steps carefully tied to the original\n\nConsent Decree,” R.2903 (March 31, 2009 D. Ct. Op. at 6). Furthermore, as part of the November\n\n2006 order, the district court also permitted the plaintiffs to undertake discovery “as to mental health\n\ncare,” saving for a later date the question of whether permanent injunctive relief would be granted,\n\nR.2187 (November 13, 2006 D. Ct. Order at 1–2). “[T]hus,” the November 2006 order “limit[ed]\n\nthe potential duration as well as the scope of the re-opening.” R.2903 (March 31, 2009 D. Ct. Op.\n\nat 6). As mentioned above, the district court ultimately held seven days of hearings through the\n\n\n                                                   8\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\nspring and summer of 2008 on whether to grant permanent relief related to the mental-health\n\nprovisions of the Consent Decree.\n\n        In its March 31, 2009 opinion on the plaintiffs’ motion for additional relief and the\n\ndefendants’ motion to terminate the November 2006 injunctive relief, the district court engaged in\n\nan extensive discussion of the testimony it heard in the seven days of hearings. In doing so, it made\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the issue of compliance with the terms of the\n\npreliminary injunction. Looking to the four specific issues identified in November 2006—the use\n\nof mechanical restraints, mental-health-care staffing, daily rounds, and coordination of medical and\n\nmental-health staff—the district court concluded that the defendants had complied with each of the\n\nfour parts of the November 2006 order granting a limited re-opening of the Consent Decree.\n\n        Had the district court concluded its analysis there, we would be forced to find error. As we\n\nhave noted earlier in the course of this litigation:\n\n        the relevant inquiry is not whether the defendants are in compliance with the consent\n        decree; instead, pursuant to the PLRA, the district court must determine if the\n        consent decree is currently necessary. To fulfill its statutory duty, the district court\n        must make written findings as to whether “prospective relief remains necessary to\n        correct a current and ongoing violation of the Federal right, extends no further than\n        necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and that the prospective relief\n        is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.”\n        § 3626(b)(3). If the court finds that the current conditions at SPSM-CC do not\n        violate the Constitution, then it should terminate the consent decree, regardless of\n        whether the objectives of the consent decree have been achieved. If, on the other\n        hand, the court finds that constitutional violations persist, then it should retain\n        jurisdiction to enforce compliance with the consent decree, provided that the\n        prospective relief set forth in the decree is necessary, narrowly drawn, and the least\n        intrusive means to correct the violations.\n\n\n\n                                                   9\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\nHadix v. Johnson, 228 F.3d 662, 673 (6th Cir. 2000) (emphasis in original). The district court did\n\nnot end its consideration of the necessity of injunctive relief with these findings of fact, however.\n\nInstead, the district court proceeded to consider the issue left open in the November 2006 order:\n\nwhether, with the benefit of having conducted a full evidentiary hearing, a “[g]eneral [r]e-opening”\n\nof the mental-health-care provisions was appropriate. R.2903 (March 31, 2009 D. Ct. Op. at 13).\n\nIn this regard, the district court’s findings that the defendants had complied with the terms of the\n\nNovember 2006 preliminary injunction were relevant to its consideration of whether a current or\n\nongoing constitutional violation warranted further injunctive relief.\n\n       The district court ultimately concluded that “Plaintiffs have failed to establish by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that Defendants are violating the Consent Decree provisions\n\ngoverning mental health care, or that any asserted violations of the Consent Decree are of\n\nconstitutional proportions.” R.2903 (March 31, 2009 D. Ct. Op. at 14). In reaching this conclusion,\n\nthe district court found credible the report and testimony of one of the defendants’ experts in\n\npsychiatry, Dr. Jeffrey L. Metzner. Id. at 16–17. Dr. Metzner “reviewed a wide range of documents\n\nmaterial to the Court’s November 2006 and May 2007 orders; visited Hadix facilities; met with key\n\nmental health, medical and administrative staff; observed mental health rounds; [and] attended a case\n\nmanagement meeting.” Id. at 16. Noting several ways in which “Dr. Metzner’s report describes\n\nsubstantial improvements in Defendants’ provision of mental health care,” the district court agreed\n\nwith Dr. Metzner’s conclusion that the defendants’ plan to respond to the district court’s orders\n\n“satisfactorily addresses the Court’s stated concerns.” Id. at 17.\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\n        The district court also relied upon the testimony of two other defense witnesses. First, it\n\nfound credible the testimony of Jared Baker, “a limited license psychologist who conducted rounds\n\nin the [segregation unit] over a period of several months.” R.2903 (March 31, 2009 D. Ct. Op. at\n\n18). In the district court’s view, “Mr. Baker’s on-the-ground experience and practical perspective\n\noffer especially valuable insight into the provision of mental health care in the [segregation unit].\n\nMr. Baker described receiving meaningful supervision throughout his rounding experience.” Id. He\n\nalso “described prompt and confidential evaluations of inmates newly-assigned to the [segregation\n\nunit].” Id. at 19.\n\n        Second, the district court found credible the testimony of Craig Crawford, the Unit Chief for\n\nthe Outpatient Mental Health Team. “His responses [to questions about particular inmates] reflected\n\na degree of knowledge and concern that went well beyond mere trial preparation.” Id. The district\n\ncourt described him as “deeply committed to his patients.” Id. “Regardless of whether Mr.\n\nCrawford, or any other mental health professional always made exactly the best possible call, Mr.\n\nCrawford’s testimony showed the very opposite of deliberate indifference.” Id. at 20.\n\n        The plaintiffs argue that the intake-screening process at the Hadix facilities, which is\n\ndesigned to identify prisoners with mental-health needs as they enter the prison, is grossly\n\ninadequate, such that it constitutes deliberate indifference to the prisoners’ mental-health needs. The\n\nplaintiffs point to two relevant factors in the intake-screening process that, in their view, have an\n\nimpact on the prospects of a prisoner with mental-health-care needs: (1) “the identity of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\npsychiatrist who is randomly assigned to evaluate the prisoner,” and (2) “whether the prisoner arrives\n\nwith an existing prescription for psychotropic medications.” Plaintiffs Br. in No. 09-1424 at 40.\n\n        With respect to the importance of the identity of the psychiatrist, the plaintiffs presented\n\nevidence that “discrepancies in the performance of [the prison’s] psychiatrists” undermine the\n\neffectiveness of the defendants’ “bridge order,” which ensures that prisoners coming into a Hadix\n\nfacility while taking mental-health medication receive an examination by a mental-health practitioner\n\nupon entrance to the SPSM. Id. at 9–14. To support the conclusion that these discrepancies pose\n\na substantial risk of harm, the plaintiffs point to the testimony of their expert in psychiatry, Dr. Terry\n\nKupers, and their expert in psychology, Dr. Robert R. Walsh. Id. at 41 (citing R.2787 (Testimony\n\nof Dr. Terry Kupers at 291–92) and R.2815 (Testimony of Dr. Robert R. Walsh at 675–76)). The\n\ndistrict court, however, found neither expert’s testimony helpful. In particular, the district court\n\nbelieved that Dr. Kupers’s testimony is “ultimately largely beside the point.” R.2903 (March 31,\n\n2009 D. Ct. Op. at 21). In the district court’s view:\n\n        Dr. Kupers identified many things the Defendants could do better. Indeed, Dr.\n        Kupers often appeared to be an advocate for “best practices” care, which is laudable\n        and sensible, but quite different than showing deliberate indifference. Indeed, when\n        pressed by the Court on this point, the most Dr. Kupers could ultimately conclude\n        was that there exists some unquantifiable risk of future harm if Defendants fail to\n        adopt his recommendations. But this falls far short of the deliberate indifference\n        standard. The Court heard in Dr. Kupers’s testimony further evidence of the\n        complexity of caring for the mentally ill in prison, but not evidence of deliberate\n        indifference. The Court also notes that Dr. Kupers, in contrast to Defendants’ expert,\n        had no real experience in actually making operational decisions within a prison\n        setting.\n\nId. As for Dr. Walsh, the district court found him similarly unpersuasive:\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\n       Dr. Walsh’s testimony, though sincere and helpful, is not especially germane to the\n       present situation. His testimony tended to focus on the practices and protocols that\n       existed under his leadership [when he was the administrator of psychological services\n       for the Jackson Clinical Complex] and subsequent changes in those practices and\n       protocols. His testimony offered much more insight into the past than into the\n       current situation. Moreover, like Dr. Kupers, his testimony focused more on\n       Defendants’ alleged failure to adopt “best practices,” not on alleged systematic,\n       deliberate indifference. The Court could not base any finding of deliberate\n       indifference on the testimony of Dr. Walsh.\n\nId. at 22. In addition, the district court was not persuaded that the evidence of discrepancies in the\n\nintake-screening process establishes a constitutional violation; the district court believed that “[a]t\n\nmost, this evidence identifies possible limited cases of questionable diagnosis or treatment. But that\n\ndoes not amount to deliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment. The Bridge Order ensures\n\nthat psychotropic medication will continue at least until a mental health professional has an\n\nopportunity to make a professional judgment of the prisoner patient’s needs.” Id. at 18.\n\n       We see no clear error in these factual findings; we are not left with the “definite and firm\n\nconviction that a mistake has been committed.” Indmar Prods. Co. v. Comm’r, 444 F.3d 771,\n\n777–78 (6th Cir. 2006). Indeed, “[w]hen findings are based on determinations regarding the\n\ncredibility of witnesses, Rule 52(a) demands even greater deference to the trial court’s findings[.]”\n\nAnderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985).\n\n       The district court considered and rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that the “risks presented\n\nby sudden discontinuations of psychotropic medication for prisoners coming into a Hadix facility”\n\nprovided a basis for a finding of deliberate indifference. R.2903 (March 31, 2009 D. Ct. Op. at 17).\n\nIn particular, the district court found that the defendants’ implementation of the bridge order\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\n“promises a meaningful reduction in abrupt, potentially dangerous interruptions in psychiatric\n\nmedications.” Id. at 17. In support of this finding, the district court noted the testimony of Diana\n\nChilders, who “indicated that a policy akin to the Bridge Order would have been helpful under the\n\ncircumstances her son experienced.” Id. “All parties appear to agree that the Bridge Order is a\n\nsignificant step forward in improving mental health care in Hadix facilities.” Id. We see no clear\n\nerror in these findings.\n\n        Given all of these factual findings by the district court, we do not believe that there was an\n\nobjective risk of serious harm in violation of the Eighth Amendment with respect to the intake-\n\nscreening process at the Hadix facilities. We therefore reject the plaintiffs’ argument to the contrary.\n\n        The plaintiffs further argue that an objectively intolerable risk of serious harm exists due to\n\ndelays experienced by prisoners in need of mental-health treatment. To this end, they point to the\n\ndelay in providing one delusional patient (who was refusing a CT scan for a suspicious mass in his\n\npelvis) access to a psychologist and a psychiatrist. It took five days for this patient to be seen by a\n\npsychologist and sixteen days to be seen by a psychiatrist. The plaintiffs also point to the minutes\n\nof a staff meeting in 2008 which noted that staff members acknowledged that there existed\n\n“fail[ures] to identify mental illness and suicidality. Numerous instances of a failure to see patients\n\ntimely. Very long waiting list.” Plaintiffs Br. in No. 09-1424 at 16 (quoting J.A. in No. 09-1424 at\n\n1086–87). Furthermore, the plaintiffs point to testimony from Dr. Kupers that he found “[m]any\n\nexamples” of unsupervised limited-license staff members serving as “gatekeepers” to psychiatrists.\n\nR.2787 (Testimony of Dr. Terry Kupers at 307). Dr. Kupers also stated his belief that limited-license\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\nstaff members had inadequate supervision. Id. at 308. Lastly, the plaintiffs point out that when Dr.\n\nKupers was asked if he thought that “the level of delay in access to mental health services is\n\nexposing prisoners to a substantial danger of serious harm,” Dr. Kupers responded, “Absolutely it\n\nis.” Id. at 296.\n\n         We do not believe that this evidence requires reversal of the district court’s determination\n\nthat there was no longer a current and ongoing constitutional violation. With respect to Dr. Kupers,\n\nas mentioned above, the district court did not find his testimony to be persuasive in establishing\n\ndeliberate indifference. The district court noted, for example, that Dr. Kupers’s beliefs as to what\n\nconstituted “best practices” do not necessarily establish deliberate indifference. Rather, “[t]he Court\n\nheard in Dr. Kupers’s testimony further evidence of the complexity of caring for the mentally ill in\n\nprison.” R.2903 (March 31, 2009 D. Ct. Op. at 21). Additionally, the five- and sixteen-day time\n\nspan before services were provided to the patient who was refusing a CT scan and the staff-meeting\n\nminutes from 2008 are insufficient, in our view, to warrant a judgment that the defendants have been\n\ndeliberately indifferent to prisoners’ serious medical needs, especially in light of the district court’s\n\nfinding that great improvements have been made with respect to mental-health-care staffing, the\n\nprovision of daily rounds, and the coordination of mental-health and medical staff, id. at 10–13,\n\nalong with the district court’s confidence in the testimony of Metzner, Baker, and Crawford, id. at\n\n18–21.\n\n         We therefore see no basis on which to reverse the district court’s determination that there was\n\nno longer a current and ongoing violation of the Eighth Amendment in the provision of mental-\n\n\n                                                   15\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\nhealth services at the Hadix facilities. We cannot say that the district court’s conclusions regarding\n\nan objectively “substantial risk of serious harm,” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834, were in error.2\n\nB. The Plaintiffs’ Remaining Arguments\n\n        Given our agreement with the district court’s determination that there is no longer any\n\nconstitutional violation with respect to the provision of mental-health care in the Hadix facilities, our\n\nconsideration of the plaintiffs’ remaining arguments becomes simpler. First, the plaintiffs argue that\n\nthe district court erred in failing to make certain findings of fact under Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 52(a). We see no merit in this argument. The district court made numerous findings of\n\nfact throughout its opinion, as discussed above, and these, we have determined, provided a sufficient\n\nbasis for the district court’s legal conclusion—which we affirm today—that there was no longer an\n\nongoing violation of the Eighth Amendment with respect to the provision of mental-health services\n\nin the Hadix facilities at the time of the district court’s judgment.\n\n        Second, in light of our determination that the district court did not err in concluding that there\n\nwas no longer an ongoing violation of the Eighth Amendment, we need not address the plaintiffs’\n\nargument that the district court erred in failing to modify or find a breach of the Consent Decree.\n\n\n        2\n        We also do not adopt the plaintiffs’ argument that an Eighth Amendment violation has\noccurred due to “Defendants’ practice of allowing limited-license psychologists to stop referrals to\npsychiatrists.” Plaintiffs Br. in No. 09-1424 at 44. Although the plaintiffs have pointed to the\ntestimony of Dr. Kupers that, in his view, limited-license psychologists and other mental-health staff\nmembers require much closer supervision than they currently receive, id. at 17, 19 (citing J.A. in No.\n09-1424 at 903, 904, 907, 908, 914), we are not convinced that this constitutes an objectively\nintolerable risk of harm in the circumstances of this case. Dr. Kupers’s testimony relates to “best\npractices” care, which, as the district court found, does not establish deliberate indifference in\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.\n\n                                                   16\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\nThe PLRA precludes the grant or continuation of injunctive relief in the absence of a finding of a\n\nconstitutional violation. Finally, because the district court determined that there is no “current and\n\nongoing” constitutional violation, we need not address the plaintiffs’ argument that the district court\n\nmade clearly erroneous findings of fact regarding the defendants’ efforts to comply with the 2006\n\ninjunction.\n\nC. Conclusion\n\n       For these reasons, we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that there was\n\nno longer a “current and ongoing” violation of the Eighth Amendment. We therefore affirm the\n\ndistrict court’s termination of all injunctive relief related to the mental-health provisions of the\n\nConsent Decree.\n\n                III. The Denial Of The Motion To Add New Named Plaintiffs\n\n       The appeal in No. 09-2255 relates to the district court’s denial of the plaintiffs’ motion to add\n\nfour new class representatives, invoking Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24, governing intervention.\n\nThe need to add these new named plaintiffs arose from the fact that the district court determined in\n\nits March 31, 2009 order that the facility in which the sole remaining named plaintiff resided, the\n\nRyan Correctional Facility, no longer constituted a Hadix facility, leaving no named Hadix class\n\nmembers. The district court denied without prejudice the motion to add new named plaintiffs in an\n\nunnumbered docket entry on September 4, 2009, “pending outcome of the current appeal.” The\n\ndistrict court also denied the plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, R.2947, on the ground that if the\n\nU.S. Court of Appeals upholds the district court’s March 31, 2009, order in Sixth Circuit Appeal No.\n\n\n                                                  17\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\n09-1424, the scope of the remaining class may be impacted, thereby affecting the propriety of\n\nintervention. R. 2949 (September 10, 2009 D. Ct. Order). More specifically, the district court stated\n\nthat the motion for reconsideration was denied because “it is prudent to await the decision of the\n\nCourt of Appeals, so that all parties will have the benefit of that ruling before addressing the issues\n\nraised by Plaintiff’s motion . . . .” Id.\n\n        The district court therefore did not consider on the merits the requirements of Rule 24, opting\n\ninstead to deny the motion without prejudice to refiling. This decision, however, is not a “final\n\ndecision” under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 because it does not “end[] the litigation on the merits.”\n\nCunningham v. Hamilton County, 527 U.S. 198, 204 (1999). It also does not fall within the\n\ncollateral order doctrine, a “practical construction” of section 1291, because it does not “conclusively\n\ndetermine the disputed question” of whether the individuals named in the motion may be added as\n\nnew named plaintiffs. Will v. Hallock, 546 U.S. 345, 349–50 (2006); see also Moldowan v. City of\n\nWarren, 578 F.3d 351, 368 (6th Cir. 2009). Indeed, the district court expressly contemplated the\n\npossibility of “renewal of the motion following the ruling and mandate of the Court of Appeals.”\n\nR.2949. Lastly, the decision below does not present issues that are “inextricably intertwined with\n\nan independently appealable issue,” see Turi v. Main Street Adoption Services, LLP, --- F.3d ----, No.\n\n09-2229, 2011 WL 744154, at *4 (6th Cir. March 4, 2011), and it does not fall within the narrow set\n\nof appealable orders listed in 28 U.S.C. § 1292. As a result, we lack jurisdiction to review the\n\ndistrict court’s denial without prejudice of the plaintiffs’ motion to add new named plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\n                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n        For these reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court terminating all injunctive\n\nrelief relating to the mental-health provisions of the Consent Decree. We also hold that we lack\n\njurisdiction to consider the district court’s denial without prejudice of the motion to add new named\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\f",

This case, which has a procedural history\n\nspanning more than thirty years, involves a civil-rights action brought by Michigan prisoners alleging\n\nunconstitutional conditions of confinement. The subjects of this consolidated appeal are two orders\n\nentered by the district court on March 31, 2009, and September 10, 2009, which relate respectively\n\nto the injunctive relief ordered in November 2006 and the plaintiffs’ motion to add four new class\n\nrepresentatives. With respect to the March 31, 2009 order, we AFFIRM the district court’s\n\ntermination of the relief granted in November 2006. We hold that we lack jurisdiction to consider\n\nthe September 10, 2009 order, however, because the district court denied without prejudice the\n\n\n\n\n       *\n         The Honorable Daniel M. Friedman, United States Circuit Judge for the Federal Circuit,\nsitting by designation.\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\nmotion to add new named plaintiffs, and the district court has not yet considered the merits of the\n\nmotion in the first instance.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n        In 1980, Everett Hadix and ten other prisoners brought a class action in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on behalf of all prisoners incarcerated at the State\n\nPrison of Southern Michigan, Central Complex (“SPSM-CC”) against various state prison officials.\n\nBrought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the complaint alleged unconstitutional conditions of\n\nconfinement. In 1985, the parties entered into a comprehensive Consent Decree, which was later\n\napproved by the district court, addressing various aspects of prison life, including safety, sanitation,\n\nhygiene, and protection from harm. The Consent Decree stated that its provisions were “intended\n\nby the parties to assure the constitutionality of the conditions under which prisoners are incarcerated\n\nat SPSM-CC,” although the decree contained neither an admission of liability on the part of the state\n\nprison officials nor any findings of constitutional violations. Joint Appendix (“J.A.”) in No. 09-1424\n\nat 392 (Consent Decree).\n\n        Section II.B. of the Consent Decree addresses mental-health issues inside the SPSM. The\n\nmandates of these provisions were officially terminated on January 8, 2001, but, in response to the\n\ntragic death of an inmate suffering from mental-health problems in 2006, the district court reopened\n\nseveral aspects of the mental-health-care provisions of the Consent Decree in November 2006.\n\nSpecifically, the district court reopened section II.B., “limited to the provisions of [the November\n\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\n2006] Order and Preliminary Injunction.” R. 2187 (November 13, 2006 D. Ct. Order at 1). The\n\ndistrict court ordered that the defendants comply with the following:\n\n        •       “immediately cease and desist from the practice of using any form of punitive\n                mechanical restraints within Hadix facilities, and [] timely develop practices,\n                protocols and policies to enforce this limitation”;\n\n        •       “immediately work to develop a staffing plan for adequate psychiatric and\n                psychological staffing at Hadix facilities to ensure that routine and emergent\n                psychiatric and psychological services are provided in a timely way”;\n\n        •       “immediately work to provide daily psychologist or psychiatrist rounds in the\n                segregation unit at the Hadix facilities”; and\n\n        •       “immediately work to develop protocols for the coordination of mental health\n                and medical staff, and [] require weekly conferences of the two disciplines\n                which shall include . . . the treatment of prisoners in the segregation unit, and\n                which shall include necessary training to prevent staff and administrative\n                indifference to the provision of care . . . .”\n\nId. at 1–3 (emphasis removed). The district court also permitted the plaintiffs to undertake\n\n“discovery as to mental health care in advance of a final injunctive hearing.” Id.\n\n        In ordering this preliminary injunctive relief, the district court was mindful of the\n\nrequirements of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), which permits injunctive relief relating\n\nto prison conditions only if the district court finds that such relief is necessary to correct a violation\n\nof a federal right:\n\n        Prospective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions shall extend\n        no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular\n        plaintiff or plaintiffs. The court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief\n        unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than\n        necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means\n        necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right. The court shall give\n\n\n                                                    3\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v.

In the November 2006 order, the district court found that the use of\n\nmechanical restraints, the inadequate mental-health-professional staffing levels, the lack of daily\n\nrounds by a psychologist, and the absence of a protocol for coordination of the medical and mental-\n\nhealth staff constituted deliberate indifference, in violation of the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and\n\nUnusual Punishments Clause.\n\n        After the November 2006 injunction was entered, this court heard several appeals in this case\n\nrelating to the injunctive relief and other matters.

The parties also filed two motions in the district\n\ncourt in anticipation of a hearing on permanent injunctive relief. The defendants filed a motion to\n\nterminate the injunctive relief granted in November 2006, R. 2684, and the plaintiffs filed a motion\n\nfor further injunctive relief, R. 2757. Ultimately, the district court ruled in favor of the defendants\n\non both motions, R.2903 (March 31, 2009 D. Ct. Op.), prompting the plaintiffs’ appeal in No. 09-\n\n1424. Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a motion to add four new class representatives because the\n\nprevious—and sole remaining—named plaintiff was no longer a member of the Hadix class due to\n\nthe fact that the facility at which he resided was determined to be no longer a Hadix facility. R.2915.\n\nThe district court denied this motion without prejudice in an unnumbered docket entry on September\n\n4, 2009, “pending outcome of the current appeal.” In response to the plaintiffs’ motion for\n\nreconsideration of this order, R.2947, the district court stated that the motion for reconsideration was\n\n                                                   4\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v.

Caruso et al.\n\n\naddressing the ability of the plaintiffs to keep in effect relief previously granted. These provisions\n\nremain focused on the existence of a violation of a federal right:\n\n        (2) Immediate termination of prospective relief.—In any civil action with respect to\n        prison conditions, a defendant or intervener shall be entitled to the immediate\n        termination of any prospective relief if the relief was approved or granted in the\n        absence of a finding by the court that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further\n        than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive\n        means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\n\n        (3) Limitation.—Prospective relief shall not terminate if the court makes written\n        findings based on the record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a\n        current and ongoing violation of the Federal right, extends no further than necessary\n        to correct the violation of the Federal right, and that the prospective relief is narrowly\n        drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(2)–(3). Under this standard, the defendants could obtain termination of the\n\nrelief granted in the 2006 injunction if they convinced the district court that there was no longer a\n\n“current and ongoing” constitutional violation. On the other hand, the plaintiffs could prevent the\n\ntermination of the 2006 injunctive relief if the district court found that there was still a “current and\n\nongoing” constitutional violation, and that “the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least\n\nintrusive means to correct the violation.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3).\n\n        The district court heard testimony from both sides over seven days of hearings in April, May,\n\nJune, and August of 2008, after which it issued a decision holding that there were no longer any\n\nconstitutional violations in relation to the provision of mental-health care, that the plaintiffs had not\n\nshown any violations of the Consent Decree when seeking new injunctive relief, and that the state\n\nhad complied with the requirements of the 2006 injunction. R.2903 (March 31, 2009 D. Ct. Op.).\n\n\n\n                                                    6\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\nThe district court therefore terminated all relief relating to mental-health care, resulting in the\n\ncomplete termination of section II.B. of the Consent Decree.1\n\n        With respect to the termination of relief already in effect from November 2006, the plaintiffs\n\nassert that the district court erred by applying the wrong standard for an Eighth Amendment\n\ndeliberate-indifference violation and by failing to make certain necessary findings of fact under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a). The plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in not\n\nmodifying the Consent Decree, and in making clearly erroneous findings regarding the defendants’\n\nefforts to comply with the 2006 injunction. With respect to the district court’s refusal to grant\n\nadditional prospective relief, apart from that granted in November 2006, the plaintiffs assert that the\n\ndistrict court again applied the wrong standard for deliberate indifference and failed to modify the\n\nConsent Decree or otherwise to find a breach of the Consent Decree by the defendants. For the\n\nreasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\nA. The District Court’s Conclusion That There Is No Eighth Amendment Violation\n\n        A claim of deliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment contains two components,\n\none objective and one subjective. Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 834 (1994); Comstock v.\n\nMcCrary, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775805\"><a href=\"/opinion/775805/carolyn-comstock-v-norris-mccrary-v-s-thyagarajan-and-david-howell/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 702 (6th Cir. 2001). The objective component requires that the plaintiff\n\nshow a deprivation that is “sufficiently serious,” one that “pos[es] a substantial risk of serious harm.”\n\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 834. The subjective component requires that the plaintiff show that the prison\n\n\n        1\n        We note, however, that several portions of the Consent Decree—apart from the mental-\nhealth provisions of section II.B.—remain open. Therefore, the termination of the mental-health\nprovisions will not, in and of itself, end the entire case.\n\n                                                   7\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\nofficials had a “sufficiently culpable state of mind,” specifically that “the official knows of and\n\ndisregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from\n\nwhich the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also\n\ndraw the inference.” Id. at 834, 837.\n\n        The plaintiffs claim that Farmer indicates that proof of the subjective component is not\n\nnecessary when a party is seeking only injunctive relief, and that a previous opinion of this court in\n\nthis litigation removes that requirement completely. Plaintiffs Br. in No. 09-1424 at 34–36 (citing\n\nHadix v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786086\"><a href=\"/opinion/786086/everett-hadix-v-perry-m-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 526 (6th Cir. 2004)). We need not reach this issue, however,\n\nbecause, for the reasons that follow, even if the plaintiffs are correct that proof of only the objective\n\ncomponent was necessary, we would affirm on the basis of the district court’s conclusion that there\n\nis no longer a “current and ongoing” constitutional violation.\n\n        First, it is important to put the injunctive relief at issue here in context. The November 2006\n\nreopening of the Consent Decree was a “limited” one from the beginning, R. 2187 (November 13,\n\n2006 D. Ct. Order at 1), requiring only “specific, measurable steps carefully tied to the original\n\nConsent Decree,” R.2903 (March 31, 2009 D. Ct. Op. at 6). Furthermore, as part of the November\n\n2006 order, the district court also permitted the plaintiffs to undertake discovery “as to mental health\n\ncare,” saving for a later date the question of whether permanent injunctive relief would be granted,\n\nR.2187 (November 13, 2006 D. Ct. Order at 1–2). “[T]hus,” the November 2006 order “limit[ed]\n\nthe potential duration as well as the scope of the re-opening.” R.2903 (March 31, 2009 D. Ct. Op.\n\nat 6). As mentioned above, the district court ultimately held seven days of hearings through the\n\n\n                                                   8\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\nspring and summer of 2008 on whether to grant permanent relief related to the mental-health\n\nprovisions of the Consent Decree.\n\n        In its March 31, 2009 opinion on the plaintiffs’ motion for additional relief and the\n\ndefendants’ motion to terminate the November 2006 injunctive relief, the district court engaged in\n\nan extensive discussion of the testimony it heard in the seven days of hearings. In doing so, it made\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the issue of compliance with the terms of the\n\npreliminary injunction. Looking to the four specific issues identified in November 2006—the use\n\nof mechanical restraints, mental-health-care staffing, daily rounds, and coordination of medical and\n\nmental-health staff—the district court concluded that the defendants had complied with each of the\n\nfour parts of the November 2006 order granting a limited re-opening of the Consent Decree.\n\n        Had the district court concluded its analysis there, we would be forced to find error. As we\n\nhave noted earlier in the course of this litigation:\n\n        the relevant inquiry is not whether the defendants are in compliance with the consent\n        decree; instead, pursuant to the PLRA, the district court must determine if the\n        consent decree is currently necessary. To fulfill its statutory duty, the district court\n        must make written findings as to whether “prospective relief remains necessary to\n        correct a current and ongoing violation of the Federal right, extends no further than\n        necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and that the prospective relief\n        is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.”\n        § 3626(b)(3). If the court finds that the current conditions at SPSM-CC do not\n        violate the Constitution, then it should terminate the consent decree, regardless of\n        whether the objectives of the consent decree have been achieved. If, on the other\n        hand, the court finds that constitutional violations persist, then it should retain\n        jurisdiction to enforce compliance with the consent decree, provided that the\n        prospective relief set forth in the decree is necessary, narrowly drawn, and the least\n        intrusive means to correct the violations.\n\n\n\n                                                   9\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\nHadix v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770643\"><a href=\"/opinion/770643/everett-hadix-plaintiffs-appelleescross-appellants-v-perry-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 673 (6th Cir. 2000) (emphasis in original). The district court did\n\nnot end its consideration of the necessity of injunctive relief with these findings of fact, however.\n\nInstead, the district court proceeded to consider the issue left open in the November 2006 order:\n\nwhether, with the benefit of having conducted a full evidentiary hearing, a “[g]eneral [r]e-opening”\n\nof the mental-health-care provisions was appropriate. R.2903 (March 31, 2009 D. Ct. Op. at 13).\n\nIn this regard, the district court’s findings that the defendants had complied with the terms of the\n\nNovember 2006 preliminary injunction were relevant to its consideration of whether a current or\n\nongoing constitutional violation warranted further injunctive relief.\n\n       The district court ultimately concluded that “Plaintiffs have failed to establish by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that Defendants are violating the Consent Decree provisions\n\ngoverning mental health care, or that any asserted violations of the Consent Decree are of\n\nconstitutional proportions.” R.2903 (March 31, 2009 D. Ct. Op. at 14). In reaching this conclusion,\n\nthe district court found credible the report and testimony of one of the defendants’ experts in\n\npsychiatry, Dr. Jeffrey L. Metzner. Id. at 16–17. Dr. Metzner “reviewed a wide range of documents\n\nmaterial to the Court’s November 2006 and May 2007 orders; visited Hadix facilities; met with key\n\nmental health, medical and administrative staff; observed mental health rounds; [and] attended a case\n\nmanagement meeting.” Id. at 16. Noting several ways in which “Dr. Metzner’s report describes\n\nsubstantial improvements in Defendants’ provision of mental health care,” the district court agreed\n\nwith Dr. Metzner’s conclusion that the defendants’ plan to respond to the district court’s orders\n\n“satisfactorily addresses the Court’s stated concerns.” Id. at 17.\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\n        The district court also relied upon the testimony of two other defense witnesses. First, it\n\nfound credible the testimony of Jared Baker, “a limited license psychologist who conducted rounds\n\nin the [segregation unit] over a period of several months.” R.2903 (March 31, 2009 D. Ct. Op. at\n\n18). In the district court’s view, “Mr. Baker’s on-the-ground experience and practical perspective\n\noffer especially valuable insight into the provision of mental health care in the [segregation unit].\n\nMr. Baker described receiving meaningful supervision throughout his rounding experience.” Id. He\n\nalso “described prompt and confidential evaluations of inmates newly-assigned to the [segregation\n\nunit].” Id. at 19.\n\n        Second, the district court found credible the testimony of Craig Crawford, the Unit Chief for\n\nthe Outpatient Mental Health Team. “His responses [to questions about particular inmates] reflected\n\na degree of knowledge and concern that went well beyond mere trial preparation.” Id. The district\n\ncourt described him as “deeply committed to his patients.” Id. “Regardless of whether Mr.\n\nCrawford, or any other mental health professional always made exactly the best possible call, Mr.\n\nCrawford’s testimony showed the very opposite of deliberate indifference.” Id. at 20.\n\n        The plaintiffs argue that the intake-screening process at the Hadix facilities, which is\n\ndesigned to identify prisoners with mental-health needs as they enter the prison, is grossly\n\ninadequate, such that it constitutes deliberate indifference to the prisoners’ mental-health needs. The\n\nplaintiffs point to two relevant factors in the intake-screening process that, in their view, have an\n\nimpact on the prospects of a prisoner with mental-health-care needs: (1) “the identity of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\npsychiatrist who is randomly assigned to evaluate the prisoner,” and (2) “whether the prisoner arrives\n\nwith an existing prescription for psychotropic medications.” Plaintiffs Br. in No. 09-1424 at 40.\n\n        With respect to the importance of the identity of the psychiatrist, the plaintiffs presented\n\nevidence that “discrepancies in the performance of [the prison’s] psychiatrists” undermine the\n\neffectiveness of the defendants’ “bridge order,” which ensures that prisoners coming into a Hadix\n\nfacility while taking mental-health medication receive an examination by a mental-health practitioner\n\nupon entrance to the SPSM. Id. at 9–14. To support the conclusion that these discrepancies pose\n\na substantial risk of harm, the plaintiffs point to the testimony of their expert in psychiatry, Dr. Terry\n\nKupers, and their expert in psychology, Dr. Robert R. Walsh. Id. at 41 (citing R.2787 (Testimony\n\nof Dr. Terry Kupers at 291–92) and R.2815 (Testimony of Dr. Robert R. Walsh at 675–76)). The\n\ndistrict court, however, found neither expert’s testimony helpful. In particular, the district court\n\nbelieved that Dr. Kupers’s testimony is “ultimately largely beside the point.” R.2903 (March 31,\n\n2009 D. Ct. Op. at 21). In the district court’s view:\n\n        Dr. Kupers identified many things the Defendants could do better. Indeed, Dr.\n        Kupers often appeared to be an advocate for “best practices” care, which is laudable\n        and sensible, but quite different than showing deliberate indifference. Indeed, when\n        pressed by the Court on this point, the most Dr. Kupers could ultimately conclude\n        was that there exists some unquantifiable risk of future harm if Defendants fail to\n        adopt his recommendations. But this falls far short of the deliberate indifference\n        standard. The Court heard in Dr. Kupers’s testimony further evidence of the\n        complexity of caring for the mentally ill in prison, but not evidence of deliberate\n        indifference. The Court also notes that Dr. Kupers, in contrast to Defendants’ expert,\n        had no real experience in actually making operational decisions within a prison\n        setting.\n\nId. As for Dr. Walsh, the district court found him similarly unpersuasive:\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\n       Dr. Walsh’s testimony, though sincere and helpful, is not especially germane to the\n       present situation. His testimony tended to focus on the practices and protocols that\n       existed under his leadership [when he was the administrator of psychological services\n       for the Jackson Clinical Complex] and subsequent changes in those practices and\n       protocols. His testimony offered much more insight into the past than into the\n       current situation. Moreover, like Dr. Kupers, his testimony focused more on\n       Defendants’ alleged failure to adopt “best practices,” not on alleged systematic,\n       deliberate indifference. The Court could not base any finding of deliberate\n       indifference on the testimony of Dr. Walsh.\n\nId. at 22. In addition, the district court was not persuaded that the evidence of discrepancies in the\n\nintake-screening process establishes a constitutional violation; the district court believed that “[a]t\n\nmost, this evidence identifies possible limited cases of questionable diagnosis or treatment. But that\n\ndoes not amount to deliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment. The Bridge Order ensures\n\nthat psychotropic medication will continue at least until a mental health professional has an\n\nopportunity to make a professional judgment of the prisoner patient’s needs.” Id. at 18.\n\n       We see no clear error in these factual findings; we are not left with the “definite and firm\n\nconviction that a mistake has been committed.” Indmar Prods.

Op. at 17).\n\nIn particular, the district court found that the defendants’ implementation of the bridge order\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\n“promises a meaningful reduction in abrupt, potentially dangerous interruptions in psychiatric\n\nmedications.” Id. at 17. In support of this finding, the district court noted the testimony of Diana\n\nChilders, who “indicated that a policy akin to the Bridge Order would have been helpful under the\n\ncircumstances her son experienced.” Id. “All parties appear to agree that the Bridge Order is a\n\nsignificant step forward in improving mental health care in Hadix facilities.” Id. We see no clear\n\nerror in these findings.\n\n        Given all of these factual findings by the district court, we do not believe that there was an\n\nobjective risk of serious harm in violation of the Eighth Amendment with respect to the intake-\n\nscreening process at the Hadix facilities. We therefore reject the plaintiffs’ argument to the contrary.\n\n        The plaintiffs further argue that an objectively intolerable risk of serious harm exists due to\n\ndelays experienced by prisoners in need of mental-health treatment. To this end, they point to the\n\ndelay in providing one delusional patient (who was refusing a CT scan for a suspicious mass in his\n\npelvis) access to a psychologist and a psychiatrist. It took five days for this patient to be seen by a\n\npsychologist and sixteen days to be seen by a psychiatrist. The plaintiffs also point to the minutes\n\nof a staff meeting in 2008 which noted that staff members acknowledged that there existed\n\n“fail[ures] to identify mental illness and suicidality. Numerous instances of a failure to see patients\n\ntimely. Very long waiting list.” Plaintiffs Br. in No. 09-1424 at 16 (quoting J.A. in No. 09-1424 at\n\n1086–87). Furthermore, the plaintiffs point to testimony from Dr. Kupers that he found “[m]any\n\nexamples” of unsupervised limited-license staff members serving as “gatekeepers” to psychiatrists.\n\nR.2787 (Testimony of Dr. Terry Kupers at 307). Dr. Kupers also stated his belief that limited-license\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\nstaff members had inadequate supervision. Id. at 308. Lastly, the plaintiffs point out that when Dr.\n\nKupers was asked if he thought that “the level of delay in access to mental health services is\n\nexposing prisoners to a substantial danger of serious harm,” Dr. Kupers responded, “Absolutely it\n\nis.” Id. at 296.\n\n         We do not believe that this evidence requires reversal of the district court’s determination\n\nthat there was no longer a current and ongoing constitutional violation. With respect to Dr. Kupers,\n\nas mentioned above, the district court did not find his testimony to be persuasive in establishing\n\ndeliberate indifference. The district court noted, for example, that Dr. Kupers’s beliefs as to what\n\nconstituted “best practices” do not necessarily establish deliberate indifference. Rather, “[t]he Court\n\nheard in Dr. Kupers’s testimony further evidence of the complexity of caring for the mentally ill in\n\nprison.” R.2903 (March 31, 2009 D. Ct. Op. at 21). Additionally, the five- and sixteen-day time\n\nspan before services were provided to the patient who was refusing a CT scan and the staff-meeting\n\nminutes from 2008 are insufficient, in our view, to warrant a judgment that the defendants have been\n\ndeliberately indifferent to prisoners’ serious medical needs, especially in light of the district court’s\n\nfinding that great improvements have been made with respect to mental-health-care staffing, the\n\nprovision of daily rounds, and the coordination of mental-health and medical staff, id. at 10–13,\n\nalong with the district court’s confidence in the testimony of Metzner, Baker, and Crawford, id. at\n\n18–21.\n\n         We therefore see no basis on which to reverse the district court’s determination that there was\n\nno longer a current and ongoing violation of the Eighth Amendment in the provision of mental-\n\n\n                                                   15\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\nhealth services at the Hadix facilities. We cannot say that the district court’s conclusions regarding\n\nan objectively “substantial risk of serious harm,” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834, were in error.2\n\nB. The Plaintiffs’ Remaining Arguments\n\n        Given our agreement with the district court’s determination that there is no longer any\n\nconstitutional violation with respect to the provision of mental-health care in the Hadix facilities, our\n\nconsideration of the plaintiffs’ remaining arguments becomes simpler. First, the plaintiffs argue that\n\nthe district court erred in failing to make certain findings of fact under Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 52(a). We see no merit in this argument. The district court made numerous findings of\n\nfact throughout its opinion, as discussed above, and these, we have determined, provided a sufficient\n\nbasis for the district court’s legal conclusion—which we affirm today—that there was no longer an\n\nongoing violation of the Eighth Amendment with respect to the provision of mental-health services\n\nin the Hadix facilities at the time of the district court’s judgment.\n\n        Second, in light of our determination that the district court did not err in concluding that there\n\nwas no longer an ongoing violation of the Eighth Amendment, we need not address the plaintiffs’\n\nargument that the district court erred in failing to modify or find a breach of the Consent Decree.\n\n\n        2\n        We also do not adopt the plaintiffs’ argument that an Eighth Amendment violation has\noccurred due to “Defendants’ practice of allowing limited-license psychologists to stop referrals to\npsychiatrists.” Plaintiffs Br. in No. 09-1424 at 44. Although the plaintiffs have pointed to the\ntestimony of Dr. Kupers that, in his view, limited-license psychologists and other mental-health staff\nmembers require much closer supervision than they currently receive, id. at 17, 19 (citing J.A. in No.\n09-1424 at 903, 904, 907, 908, 914), we are not convinced that this constitutes an objectively\nintolerable risk of harm in the circumstances of this case. Dr. Kupers’s testimony relates to “best\npractices” care, which, as the district court found, does not establish deliberate indifference in\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.\n\n                                                   16\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\nThe PLRA precludes the grant or continuation of injunctive relief in the absence of a finding of a\n\nconstitutional violation. Finally, because the district court determined that there is no “current and\n\nongoing” constitutional violation, we need not address the plaintiffs’ argument that the district court\n\nmade clearly erroneous findings of fact regarding the defendants’ efforts to comply with the 2006\n\ninjunction.\n\nC. Conclusion\n\n       For these reasons, we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that there was\n\nno longer a “current and ongoing” violation of the Eighth Amendment. We therefore affirm the\n\ndistrict court’s termination of all injunctive relief related to the mental-health provisions of the\n\nConsent Decree.\n\n                III. The Denial Of The Motion To Add New Named Plaintiffs\n\n       The appeal in No. 09-2255 relates to the district court’s denial of the plaintiffs’ motion to add\n\nfour new class representatives, invoking Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24, governing intervention.\n\nThe need to add these new named plaintiffs arose from the fact that the district court determined in\n\nits March 31, 2009 order that the facility in which the sole remaining named plaintiff resided, the\n\nRyan Correctional Facility, no longer constituted a Hadix facility, leaving no named Hadix class\n\nmembers. The district court denied without prejudice the motion to add new named plaintiffs in an\n\nunnumbered docket entry on September 4, 2009, “pending outcome of the current appeal.” The\n\ndistrict court also denied the plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, R.2947, on the ground that if the\n\nU.S. Court of Appeals upholds the district court’s March 31, 2009, order in Sixth Circuit Appeal No.\n\n\n                                                  17\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\n09-1424, the scope of the remaining class may be impacted, thereby affecting the propriety of\n\nintervention. R. 2949 (September 10, 2009 D. Ct. Order). More specifically, the district court stated\n\nthat the motion for reconsideration was denied because “it is prudent to await the decision of the\n\nCourt of Appeals, so that all parties will have the benefit of that ruling before addressing the issues\n\nraised by Plaintiff’s motion . . . .” Id.\n\n        The district court therefore did not consider on the merits the requirements of Rule 24, opting\n\ninstead to deny the motion without prejudice to refiling. This decision, however, is not a “final\n\ndecision” under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 because it does not “end[] the litigation on the merits.”\n\nCunningham v. Hamilton County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118304\"><a href=\"/opinion/118304/cunningham-v-hamilton-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 204 (1999). It also does not fall within the\n\ncollateral order doctrine, a “practical construction” of section 1291, because it does not “conclusively\n\ndetermine the disputed question” of whether the individuals named in the motion may be added as\n\nnew named plaintiffs. Will v. Hallock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145689\"><a href=\"/opinion/145689/will-v-hallock/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 349–50 (2006); see also Moldowan v. City of\n\nWarren, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">578</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 368 (6th Cir. 2009). Indeed, the district court expressly contemplated the\n\npossibility of “renewal of the motion following the ruling and mandate of the Court of Appeals.”\n\nR.2949. Lastly, the decision below does not present issues that are “inextricably intertwined with\n\nan independently appealable issue,” see Turi v. Main Street Adoption Services, LLP, --- F.3d ----, No.\n\n09-2229, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">744154</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (6th Cir. March 4, 2011), and it does not fall within the narrow set\n\nof appealable orders listed in 28 U.S.C. § 1292. As a result, we lack jurisdiction to review the\n\ndistrict court’s denial without prejudice of the plaintiffs’ motion to add new named plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fNos. 09-1424, 09-2255\nHadix et al. v. Caruso et al.\n\n\n                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n        For these reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court terminating all injunctive\n\nrelief relating to the mental-health provisions of the Consent Decree. We also hold that we lack\n\njurisdiction to consider the district court’s denial without prejudice of the motion to add new named\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\f</pre>",
