For the following reasons, we affirm.\n                           FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n\n\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f   Case: 10-11254    Document: 00511787980      Page: 2   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\n      Greer, who uses a wheelchair for mobility as a result of a spinal cord\ninjury, attended her son’s junior varsity football game at RISD’s Berkner B\nstadium, located at Berkner High School in Richardson, Texas, on October 4,\n2007. After entering the stadium, Greer realized that the only way to access the\nstadium’s bleacher seating was by climbing a flight of stairs. Unable to access\nthe stadium’s bleachers, Greer maneuvered her wheelchair to an accessible\npaved area adjacent to the bleachers where she watched the football game\nthrough a chain link fence that surrounds the field while her husband watched\nthe game from the bleachers. From her viewpoint, Greer claims she was only\nable to observe roughly 15% of the game due to her view being blocked by\nfootball players standing on the sideline. She also claims the area, while\naccessible by a wheelchair, was slightly sloped, which required her to hold on to\nthe fence to avoid slowly rolling backwards. It is not disputed that Greer was\nable to access other aspects of the stadium, including being able to park at the\nstadium, navigate from the parking lot to the stadium, buy a ticket to the game,\nand buy a hot dog and beverage at the concession stand.\n      On February 1, 2008, Greer sued RISD, claiming that it discriminated\nagainst her by excluding her from participation in the benefits, programs and\nactivities of a governmental entity receiving federal assistance, in violation of\nTitle II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\n29 U.S.C. §§ 794 and 794a. The basis of Greer’s original complaint focused solely\non her exclusion from the bleachers at Berkner B stadium.\n      The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment in December 2008.\nAt a motion hearing on March 4, 2009, the district court granted leave for RISD\nto amend its answer to assert the affirmative defense of “undue burden” with\nrespect to making accessibility modifications to the Berkner B stadium and\nreopened discovery as to that limited issue. On July 9, 2009, the Court granted\nGreer leave to file a Second Amended Complaint, in which she expanded her\n\n                                        2\n\f   Case: 10-11254      Document: 00511787980   Page: 3   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nclaims to include accessibility allegations regarding other aspects of the Berkner\nB stadium including restroom access, curb cuts, ramp access to a public right of\nway, and access to the track surrounding the football field. RISD then filed a\nThird Amended Answer on July 17, 2009.\n      Both parties again filed cross-motions for summary judgment on August\n3, 2009, and Greer also filed a motion to extend discovery and allow subsequent\nbriefing on RISD’s defense that modifications to the Berkner B stadium would\nrepresent an undue burden. The district court granted Greer’s motion and\nextended the case deadlines once again.\n      On February 1, 2010, the parties filed their third and final cross-motions\nfor summary judgment. Greer also filed a Motion to Strike Undue Burden\nDefense and for Sanctions on April 21, 2010, claiming RISD’s undue burden\ndefense was asserted in bad faith. Greer’s motion argued that RISD never had\na factual basis for asserting the undue burden defense because it never produced\nevidence that it had conducted the three-part analysis required under 28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.150(a)(3).\n      The district court granted RISD’s motion for summary judgment in part\non August 2, 2010, finding that Greer failed to present a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination under Section II of the ADA. Greer v. Richardson Indep. Sch.\nDist., 752 F. Supp. 2d 746, 754 (N.D. Tex. 2010) (“Greer I”). In addition, the\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in part to Greer on her allegation that\na ramp installed at the stadium did not comply with ADA Accessibility\nGuidelines for Buildings and Facilities (“ADAAG”) requirements, id. at 758,\ndenied Greer’s motion to strike and for sanctions, id., and reserved judgment on\nGreer’s claim of parking lot accessibility pending additional briefing from the\nparties. Id. at 757.\n      On August 12, 2010, the parties submitted a Joint Stipulation, agreeing\non the number of parking spaces available at Berkner B but disagreeing as to\n\n                                        3\n\f   Case: 10-11254   Document: 00511787980      Page: 4   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nwhether the accessible spaces comply with the ADAAG. Also on August 12,\n2010, RISD filed a Motion for Reconsideration as to the grant of summary\njudgment in favor of Greer on the ramp, claiming there was summary judgment\nevidence proving the ramp’s compliance with the ADAAG. Greer filed a Motion\nfor Findings of Fact on August 20, 2010, requesting the district court explain its\ndenial of her motion to strike and for sanctions. The district court issued an\norder a week later in response to Greer’s motion, explaining that RISD did not\nassert the undue burden defense in bad faith and that the court allowed RISD\nto assert the defense “in light of the scattershot allegations [Greer] pled in her\nComplaint” in case it became necessary to determine the issue pending the\nresolution of the summary judgment motions. Finally, RISD filed a supplemental\nbrief on September 2, 2010, arguing that this court’s then-newly-decided opinion\non panel rehearing in Frame v. City of Arlington, 616 F.3d 476 (5th Cir. 2010),\nvacated by 632 F.3d 177 (5th Cir. 2011), controlled.\n      The district court disposed of all pending motions and claims on November\n12, 2010 in favor of RISD, granting its motion for reconsideration regarding the\nramp and subsequently granting summary judgment in favor of RISD on the\nissues of the ramp and the accessible parking spaces in light of Frame. Greer v.\nRichardson Indep. Sch. Dist., 752 F. Supp. 2d 759, 762–63 (N.D. Tex. 2010)\n(“Greer II”).\n      Greer appeals the district court’s rulings on summary judgment and on the\ndenial of sanctions. Greer argues the district court improperly weighed evidence\nin granting summary judgment in favor of RISD and that it erred by failing to\nfind as a matter of law that relegating disabled patrons to a non-accessible area\nof the stadium is discriminatory. Greer also challenges the district court’s\nreversal of its own decision regarding the accessible ramp in light of Frame and\ncontinues to assert her claim that RISD should be sanctioned for raising the\nundue burden defense.\n\n                                        4\n\f   Case: 10-11254        Document: 00511787980          Page: 5     Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                        No. 10-11254\n\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal\nstandard as the district court. Int’l Fid. Ins. Co. v. Sweet Little Mex. Corp., 665\nF.3d 671, 679 (5th Cir. 2011). Summary judgment should be rendered if the\nrecord demonstrates that “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact\nand the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a).\nWe view all disputed facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\nInt’l Fid. Ins. Co., 665 F.3d at 679. We review the district court’s ruling\nregarding sanctions for abuse of discretion. Whitehead v. Food Max of Miss., Inc.,\n332 F.3d 796, 803 (5th Cir. 2003). Under this deferential standard, “an abuse of\ndiscretion only occurs where no reasonable person could take the view adopted\nby the trial court.” Friends for Am. Free Enter. Ass’n v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,\n284 F.3d 575, 578 (5th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation omitted).\n                                       DISCUSSION\nA. ADA and Existing Structures\n       Title II of the ADA states that “no qualified individual with a disability\nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied\nthe benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be\nsubjected to discrimination by any such entity.”1 42 U.S.C. § 12132; see also 28\nC.F.R. § 35.130(a) (“No qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis\n\n\n\n       1\n           Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides nearly identical language. “No\notherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, . . . , shall, solely by\nreason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of,\nor be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial\nassistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Because the language and standards are virtually identical\nfor Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, we consider Greer’s claims\nunder both statutes concurrently but will refer only to the ADA for brevity. See 28 C.F.R. pt.\n35, app. B (“Because title II of the ADA essentially extends the antidiscrimination prohibition\nembodied in section 504 to all actions of State and local governments, the standards adopted\nin this part are generally the same as those required under section 504 for federally assisted\nprograms.”).\n\n                                                5\n\f   Case: 10-11254      Document: 00511787980         Page: 6    Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                      No. 10-11254\n\nof disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the\nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to\ndiscrimination by any public entity”). The implementation of Title II and the\nconstruction and access requirements, as it pertains to ensuring public facilities\nare accessible to individuals with disabilities, are articulated in the ADAAG\nregulations. These regulations provide the minimum technical requirements for\nADA compliance for newly constructed facilities and for alterations made to\nexisting facilities. 28 C.F.R. pt. 36 app. A.2 There is no dispute that RISD is a\ngovernmental entity of the State of Texas and is subject to the requirements of\nthe ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the relevant implementing regulations.\n       When enacting the ADA, Congress acknowledged that some public entities\noperating then-existing buildings and structures would be unable to comply with\nall technical aspects of the new ADAAG regulations.                    Accordingly, the\nregulations promulgated by the United States Attorney General to implement\nthe requirements of Title II differentiate between structures built prior to the\nAct taking effect in January 1992 (“existing facilities”) and facilities built or\naltered after January 1992. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 531–32 (2004); 28\nC.F.R. § 35.104. The accessibility requirements for existing facilities are less\nstringent and more flexible than for new facilities. “[I]n the case of older\nfacilities, for which structural change is likely to be more difficult, a public entity\nmay comply with Title II by adopting a variety of less costly measures, including\nrelocating services to alternative, accessible sites and assigning aides to assist\npersons with disabilities in accessing services.” Lane, 541 U.S. at 532. It is\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          The Rehabilitation Act has a set of standards nearly identical to the ADAAG called\nthe Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (“UFAS”). 41 C.F.R. pt. 101–19.6, app. A. Public\nentities subject to Title II may comply with either set of standards when constructing a new\nfacility or altering an existing facility. 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(c).\n\n                                             6\n\f   Case: 10-11254        Document: 00511787980           Page: 7      Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                         No. 10-11254\n\nundisputed that RISD’s Berkner B stadium, built in 1968, qualifies as an\nexisting structure.\n         When considering ADA compliance for such existing structures, the\ntouchstone is thus not the facility’s technical compliance with the ADAAG, but\nis instead “program accessibility.” “A public entity shall operate each service,\nprogram, or activity so that the service, program, or activity, when viewed in its\nentirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.” 28\nC.F.R. § 35.150(a). Making a program or activity accessible under this standard\ndoes not require a public entity to make all of its existing facilities accessible to\ndisabled individuals nor does it require a public entity to take an action that\nwould place an undue burden on the entity. Id. at (a)(1), (3). Furthermore, the\nregulations do not provide any objective criteria for evaluating program\naccessibility.      While an existing facility’s compliance with the ADAAG\nregulations may be informative, program accessibility is ultimately a subjective\ndetermination by viewing the program or activity at issue in its entirety and not\nsolely by evaluating individual elements of the facility where the program is\nheld.3\n\n\n         3\n           While there is little precedent in this circuit regarding the application of the ADAAG\nto existing facilities, we note that courts in various other circuits have refused to strictly apply\nADAAG requirements to existing facilities but instead rely on the ADAAG for guidance. See,\ne.g., Chaffin v. Kan. State Fair Bd., 348 F.3d 850, 861 (10th Cir. 2003) (“[W]hen determining\nthe compliance of existing facilities with the ADA under program accessibility, courts must\nlook at the accessibility of the facilities as a whole, not at individual elements.”) (citation and\ninternal quotation omitted); Parker v. Universidad de P.R., 225 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2000) (“Title\nII’s emphasis on ‘program accessibility’ rather than ‘facilities accessibility’ was intended to\nensure broad access to public services, while, at the same time, providing public entities with\nthe flexibility to choose how best to make access available.”); Ass’n for Disabled Ams. v. City\nof Orlando, 153 F. Supp. 2d 1310, 1322 (M.D. Fla. 2001) (“Title II, the regulations\nimplementing it, and the (admittedly sparse) case law interpreting it, do not require that\nfacilities built prior to 1992 comply with the stringent technical standards imposed on facilities\nbuilt after 1992.”); Access Now, Inc. v. S. Fla. Stadium Corp., 161 F. Supp. 2d 1357, 1368 (S.D.\nFla. 2001); Pascuiti v. N.Y. Yankees, 87 F. Supp. 2d 221, 226 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (“[E]ven though\nonly new construction and alterations must comply with the [ADAAG] Standards, those\nStandards nevertheless provide valuable guidance . . . . Deviation from the standards is\n\n                                                 7\n\f   Case: 10-11254       Document: 00511787980         Page: 8     Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                       No. 10-11254\n\nB. Greer’s Prima Facie Case\n       To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, Greer\nmust demonstrate: (1) that she is a qualified individual within the meaning of\nthe ADA; (2) that she was excluded from participation in, or was denied benefits\nof, services, programs, or activities for which RISD is responsible; and (3) that\nsuch exclusion or discrimination is because of her disability. Melton v. Dall. Area\nRapid Transit, 391 F.3d 669, 671–72 (5th Cir. 2004). If Greer makes a prima\nfacie case, RISD may assert an affirmative defense by showing that the\nrequested actions would constitute an undue financial or administrative burden.\n28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a)(3).\n       We note that disability discrimination differs from racial discrimination\nin the constitutional sense. Melton, 391 F.3d at 672.4 To determine whether\nRISD discriminated against Greer on the basis of her disability, we rely on the\nlanguage      of   the     ADA      itself   and     its   applicable       definition     of\ndiscrimination—whether the junior varsity football game at Berkner B was an\naccessible program at an existing facility. If the football game is not readily\naccessible to someone with a disability, Greer may have stated a prima facie case\nof discrimination. On the other hand, if it is apparent that RISD provides\nsufficient program access to football games held at Berkner B, Greer has failed\nto establish a prima facie case and the district court was correct in denying\nGreer’s summary judgment motion.\n       The parties do not dispute that Greer satisfies elements one and three in\nestablishing a prima facie case: she is a qualified individual under the ADA and\n\n\nrelevant but not determinative; it is one consideration from which the court may conclude that\nnoncompliance impedes access.”).\n       4\n         Greer fails to recognize this difference and attempts to equate her situation with a\nblack spectator forced to watch the game from an area separated from the general public\nbleacher seating. Reply Brief for Appellant at 12–13. This is a flawed analogy and evidences\na misunderstanding of disability discrimination claims under the ADA.\n\n                                              8\n\f   Case: 10-11254    Document: 00511787980      Page: 9   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nany alleged exclusion or discrimination was a result of her disability—her\ninability to access the Berkner B bleachers while in a wheelchair. As a result,\nthe primary question before this court is whether the district court properly\nfound that Greer failed to satisfy element two, and thus failed to present a prima\nfacie case, by showing that there was insufficient program access when she\nattended the football game at Berkner B.\n      Establishing    exactly   what   constitutes    sufficient   access   to   the\n“program”—watching her son’s football game—was a primary concern of the\ndistrict court and continues to be a matter of debate on appeal. The following\nexchange between the district court and Greer’s counsel at the hearing on the\nparties’ cross-motions for summary judgment is instructive.\n      The district court:\n      That the key issue with respect to this subject, as the plaintiff would\n      characterize it, is that [providing alternative accessible viewing\n      areas] doesn’t do because it’s not just watching the game that\n      matters, which Ms. Greer, or others, seated in one of those areas\n      could do, but it is the experience of watching the game with the\n      other fans.\n      Greer’s counsel in response:\n      But to the extent that the basic argument is that are you entitled to\n      keep the disabled out of the general seating area versus not, then I\n      would agree that that is a fair assessment of one of the central\n      issues before the Court.”\n      In light of the prior proceedings and the parties’ briefs, we understand\nGreer’s general contention to be this: “program access” is more than just the\nability to watch the football game at the Berkner B stadium. Instead program\naccess requires that a disabled individual such as Greer not only be able to\nwatch the game but also experience the game from the general admission public\nbleachers so as to not be separated from other attendees.\n\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\f  Case: 10-11254       Document: 00511787980         Page: 10     Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                      No. 10-11254\n\n       There is an aspect of Greer’s segregation argument that rings true as\nnoted by the district court during its hearing on the cross-motions for summary\njudgment. It would likely not be permissible for a public entity such as RISD to\nclaim it provides program access if it required disabled individuals to sit alone\nin an area far removed from her companions and other attendees, such as behind\nthe goal posts at the end of the field, when all other attendees were seated along\nthe sidelines. Yet we need not determine where that line exists here—how far\naway is too far away—because, as the photos in the record show, all of the\naccessible seating offered by RISD is either immediately adjacent to or in front\nof the bleacher seating for the general public.\n       However, we disagree with Greer’s suggestion that any separation from\nthe general public seating area is ipso facto discrimination and we do not agree\nwith Greer’s argument that she was denied program access at the Berkner B\nstadium. Like the district court, we note that much of Greer’s argument focuses\non “the actual state of ADAAG compliance at the facility” and conflates these\nobservations about facility deviations from ADAAG standards, which are\napplicable to newly constructed or modified facilities, with RISD’s obligation to\nprovide program access at an existing facility.5\n       In making these arguments, Greer attempts to completely nullify the\n“program access” standard of review by asserting that, based on RISD’s\nadmission that the bleachers are not accessible and therefore wheelchair-bound\nvisitors to Berkner B are provided alternate seating areas, RISD must prove that\n\n\n       5\n          The basis for much of the confusion appears to be Greer’s insistence throughout the\nlitigation to apply a strict, technical definition of “accessible” as defined in the ADAAG to\nmean compliance with the ADAAG standards. She fails to appreciate that the word\n“accessible” was used throughout the litigation to discuss whether events at Berkner B were\naccessible in the context of “program accessibility,” as opposed to accessible under the\ntechnical limits of the ADAAG. See, e.g., Greer I, 752 F. Supp. 2d at 754 (“Greer’s own\ntestimony shows that events at Berkner B Field as a whole are accessible to wheelchair-bound\nindividuals.”) (emphasis added).\n\n                                             10\n\f  Case: 10-11254     Document: 00511787980       Page: 11   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                   No. 10-11254\n\nmodifying the stadium seating would constitute an undue financial burden in\norder for RISD to avoid summary judgment. This however is not an accurate\ninterpretation of the law. As an operator of an existing facility, RISD need only\nshow that the program offered at Berkner B, when viewed in its entirety, is\nreadily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. 28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.150(a). Thus, despite Greer’s protests that RISD’s repeated statements that\nit “is not legally obligated to provide bleacher access for a mobility-impaired\nindividual who has designated accessible seating available in an alternate area”\nare incorrect, RISD’s statement is a valid interpretation of the law. As an\nexisting facility, RISD’s duty is to provide program access to events at Berkner\nB, which may be achieved without providing access to the bleachers.\n      Furthermore, Greer’s argument that “Keeping the disabled out of the\npublic seating—without any justification—is a denial of program access on its\nface,” Reply Br. 10, would render the “program access” standard meaningless.\nUnder such a reading, a public entity would be required in all cases to modify\nexisting facilities whenever the general public seating area was not wheelchair\naccessible or ADAAG compliant. Yet this is precisely what the program access\nstandard for existing facilities was meant to avoid by allowing public entities to\nensure that disabled individuals can readily access the program at the facility\nbut not necessarily all aspects of the facility itself.\n      As an example of conflating program access with facility access, Greer\nasserts in her opening brief that “The undisputed expert testimony in the case\nis that the [track] surface is not accessible” as an alternative seating area and\nsupports the statement with citations to the record. However, the cited portions\nof the record consist of only two items: (1) a portion of her expert’s report\nclaiming that the surface would not comply with current ADAAG standards (but\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f  Case: 10-11254        Document: 00511787980          Page: 12     Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                        No. 10-11254\n\nlacking any objective measurements in support of the claim),6 and (2) a RISD\nrepresentative’s response to a deposition question from Greer’s counsel in which\nthe individual simply answers “I don’t know” to whether the track would have\nto meet ADAAG new construction standards for an accessible surface.7 Despite\nGreer’s arguments, the focus of the district court’s finding, and our review,\nremains on the accessibility of the program and not technical compliance with\nADAAG in an existing facility. And on this point, we agree with the district\ncourt that RISD provided program access at Berkner B stadium.\n       Laid bare, Greer’s claims in her motion for summary judgment consist only\nof her own statements of dissatisfaction from her experience at one football game\nat Berkner B and her expert’s report that opines on various deviations of\nBerkner B’s structural elements from current ADAAG requirements for new or\nmodified facilities. Many of the observations in the expert report do not relate\nto whether RISD provides program access to disabled individuals attending\n\n       6\n       While Greer repeatedly cites her expert’s report that states the track surface does not\ncomply with ADAAG, her expert subsequently testified that he “d[idn’t] have any idea”\nwhether a wheelchair could roll on the track surface. Greer I, 752 F. Supp. 2d at 755.\n       7\n          We note that this type of borderline misrepresentation has been present throughout\nthe case. The district court, upon recommendation of a magistrate judge, awarded attorneys’\nfees to RISD due to Greer’s counsels’ reckless arguments in her motion for summary judgment.\nSee Greer v. Richardson Indep. School Dist., No. 3:08-CV-0160-M, 2011 WL 3555851, at *2\n(N.D. Tex. Apr. 12, 2011), adopted as modified by 2011 WL 3555779 (N.D. Tex. Aug 11, 2011)\n(“Plaintiff’s counsel sought to misdirect the Court with respect to this [undue burden] defense\nby arguing that Defendant’s expert witness, Michael Longanecker, ‘agreed that the facilities\nat Berkner B Field were not accessible.’ The District Court called this argument ‘misleading\nat worst’ and ‘consistently confus[ing]’ at best and held that Longanecker’s testimony ‘clearly\nstates that specific elements of Berkner B Field did not comply with [ADAAG], but that the\nprogram as a whole is nevertheless accessible.’”).\n        Greer’s counsel continues to push the limits in their briefs before this court. For\nexample, Greer’s opening brief states, in part: “The undisputed facts show that there is no way\nto view the program, service, or activity at Berkner in its entirety as readily accessible to and\nusable by individuals with disabilities, when there is nothing readily accessible to and usable\nat Berkner stadium.” Brief for Appellant at 25–26. Greer’s own testimony belies the statement\nthat “nothing is readily accessible” as Greer testified that she was able to park at the stadium,\npurchase a ticket, enter the stadium, make a purchase at the concession stand, and watch at\nleast a portion of the game.\n\n                                               12\n\f  Case: 10-11254    Document: 00511787980     Page: 13    Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nevents at Berkner B and others are inapposite because Greer failed to offer\nevidence that the allegedly non-compliant structures in or around the Berkner\nB stadium have been modified since the ADA was enacted in 1992 and thus may\nbe required to comply with the ADAAG requirements. Additionally, Greer has\nfailed to demonstrate how minor deviations from the ADAAG requirements in\nvarious parts of the stadium identified by her expert, such as a quarter-inch\nvariance in “maximum beveled slope” on one designated wheelchair viewing area\nor bathroom mirrors that are mounted seven inches too high, prevent her or\nother disabled individuals from accessing the program at Berkner B, i.e.,\nwatching a football game.\n      Instead, the district court was correct that, based on the evidence offered\nby RISD in support of its motion for summary judgment and not contradicted by\nGreer, Berkner B stadium provides program accessibility when viewed in its\nentirety. RISD provided sworn statements from two individuals that use\nwheelchairs when they attend events at Berkner B, both of whom stated that\nthey had no issues attending events. Greer I, 752 F. Supp. 2d at 754–55. Greer\nherself admitted she was able to access the parking lot, navigate into the\nstadium, buy a ticket, make a purchase from the concession stand, and view a\nportion of the game.\n      Nonetheless, as Greer points out, “seeing the program is the entire reason\nfor going.” Most attendees at a high school football game, particularly parents\nof students playing in the game, are not going to the stadium for the quality of\nthe hot dogs at the concession stand. Thus, being able to do things such as\nbuying a ticket and visiting the concession stand would not be sufficient to\nprovide program access if she was unable to view the actual football game.\n      Even taking as true Greer’s claim that she was only able to see 15% of the\ngame from her vantage point next to the bleachers, the problem with Greer’s\nsingle experience is that it appears to be, at least in part, a product of her own\n\n                                       13\n\f  Case: 10-11254       Document: 00511787980          Page: 14      Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                       No. 10-11254\n\nchoices and was strongly contradicted by RISD’s evidence. She acknowledges\nthat she never asked if she could be accommodated by sitting somewhere else in\nthe stadium, such as the track that surrounds the football field, that would have\nprovided an unobstructed view.8 She did not ask anyone at the stadium if her\nhusband or friends could be accommodated by being provided chairs to sit next\nto her. She admits she did not even attempt to use the women’s restroom and\nthus has no basis for her claim that the restroom is not accessible other than her\nexpert’s findings that certain aspects of the restrooms do not meet ADAAG\nrequirements for newly constructed facilities.\n       Moreover, this was a single experience for Greer in contrast to the sworn\nstatements by other disabled individuals who have attended numerous events\nat Berkner B without issues. Had she returned to the stadium several times and\nroutinely not been provided suitable seating despite attempting to seek out event\nstaff or asking for better accommodations, her prima facie claim might ring true.\nHowever, based on the record before this court, she has not returned to Berkner\nB stadium and thus her claims are tied to her single experience at the facility.\n       By pointing out Greer’s failure to make any inquiry regarding more\nsuitable accommodations, we do not imply that the burden is or should be on\ndisabled individuals to actively request accessible accommodations in all\nsituations.9 As this court, and courts in other circuits have held, there is a\ncommon sense aspect to determining whether a public entity has provided\naccommodations for a disabled individual, part of which requires the public\n\n       8\n          Greer was asked during her deposition, “Did you ask anyone whether there were\nother places to set up?” She answered, “No, and I shouldn’t have to.” She was also asked “Did\nyou ask [the person selling tickets at the entrance to the stadium] about accessibility when you\ngot there?” Greer answered: “No, because I was right at the gate. I didn’t really experience\nanything until I got past that gentleman.”\n       9\n          In an employment context, there is a general responsibility for an individual with a\ndisability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed. Taylor v. Principal Fin.\nGrp., Inc., 93 F.3d 155, 165 (5th Cir. 1996).\n\n                                              14\n\f  Case: 10-11254    Document: 00511787980      Page: 15   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nentity be made aware of the inadequacy of the accommodations provided. See\nE.E.O.C. v. Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., 570 F.3d 606, 621 (5th Cir. 2009);\nRobertson v. Las Animas Cnty. Sheriff’s Dep’t, 500 F.3d 1185, 1196 (10th Cir.\n2007) (“This is a ‘duty dictated by common sense lest a disabled [individual] keep\nhis disability a secret and sue later for failure to accommodate.’”) (alteration in\noriginal) (quoting Beck v. Univ. of Wis. Bd. of Regents, 75 F.3d 1130, 1134 (7th\nCir.1996)). However, a disabled person’s failure to expressly “request” an\naccommodation is not fatal to an ADA claim where the defendant otherwise had\nknowledge of the individual’s disability and needs but took no action. See McCoy\nv. Texas Dep’t of Criminal Justice, No. C-05-370, 2006 WL 2331055, at *7–8 (S.D.\nTex. Aug. 9, 2006) (collecting cases from multiple circuits). Taken together,\nthere is a balance to be struck between a disabled individual’s need to request\naccommodations when limitations are not obvious or apparent and a public\nentity’s duty to provide accommodations without further notice or a request. Id.\n      Under the facts here, when a disabled individual such as Greer attends\none event at a venue she was otherwise unfamiliar with, that person does not by\ndefault gain a prima facie case of discrimination under Title II merely because\nshe is dissatisfied with her seating location and makes no effort to ask the\nvenue’s staff as to where alternative accessible seating is located or if she and\nher family can be accommodated. By Greer’s own admission, she was able to\naccess all aspects of the stadium she attempted to use during her visit—the\nparking lot, the sidewalks, the ticket booth, the concession stand, and one of the\nseveral accessible seating areas. Her argument focuses on her inability to see\nthe whole game from her viewing point for the game without giving RISD any\nopportunity to reaccommodate her or her companions such that she could have\na better viewpoint. Considering the size and types of events held at Berkner B,\nsuch as football games and track meets, it is unclear how RISD officials would\nbe able to develop a universal accessibility plan that would always satisfy the\n\n                                        15\n\f  Case: 10-11254    Document: 00511787980      Page: 16   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nviewing preferences for disabled individuals other than by what they have\nalready done—providing several alternative accessible seating areas. Stated\ndifferently, simply asking a few questions of the event venue’s staff for more\nsuitable accommodations is likely to be more effective and consistent with case\nlaw than remaining silent and resorting to a Title II discrimination claim in the\nfederal court system.\n      Even setting aside whether Greer sought out any accommodations, her\nsingle experience at Berkner B does not reflect RISD’s accessibility policies or\nthe uncontroverted experiences of other disabled individuals that have regularly\nattended events at Berkner B. RISD’s stated policy, uncontroverted by Greer,\nstates: “The District provides accessible parking, an accessible entrance,\nemployees who are available to assist patrons who desire assistance, and an\nability for all patrons, including individuals with disabilities, to participate in\nor view the events and programs at the Berkner B Field. Patrons of the Berkner\nB Field, including individuals with disabilities and their companions, are\nprovided seating on the track, behind the fence, or any other accessible area so\nthat they can participate in or view the events and programs.” The testimony\nfrom two regular attendees of events at Berkner B reinforce the veracity of\nRISD’s policy, as both individuals testified that they have always been provided\naccessible seating with their companions, often on the track, and that neither\nattendee had difficulties accessing any of the Berkner B facilities, including\nnavigating on the track surface in their wheelchairs. One of the two individuals\neven noted that a seat on the track provides a better view than a seat in the\nbleachers. Greer I, 752 F. Supp. 2d at 754–55.\n      While Greer decries the district court’s reliance on such statements as an\nimproper weighing of evidence at the summary judgment stage, we disagree\nwith Greer’s characterization. The parties had simultaneously submitted cross-\nmotions for summary judgment. Thus, what at first glance may appear to be a\n\n                                        16\n\f  Case: 10-11254    Document: 00511787980     Page: 17    Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nweighing of evidence is actually a sequential analysis of each party’s motion.\nAlthough the district court announced its decision on each party’s respective\nmotion in a single paragraph, the motions were considered separately. Id. at\n755–56.\n      First, the district court denied Greer’s motion, finding that she had not\npresented a prima facie case of discrimination. Second, the court granted RISD’s\nmotion, on the basis of evidence it offered, finding that events at Berkner B are\naccessible to wheelchair-bound individuals based on Greer’s own testimony and\nsworn testimony of other wheelchair-bound individuals that regularly attend\nevents at the stadium. Though not highlighted explicitly in the district court’s\nopinion, Greer, as the nonmoving party in response to RISD’s motion, needed to\ncome forward with affidavits or other similar evidence to show that a genuine\nissue of material fact exists with respect to program access. See Matsushita Elec.\nIndus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986).\n      In responding to RISD’s motion, Greer relied only on her own single\nexperience and an expert report focused on facility access and failed to produce\nany countervailing evidence to show that a genuine issue of material fact existed\nwith respect to program access. She offered no contradicting evidence about\nprogram access at Berkner B such as being refused more agreeable accessible\nseating such as the track. She made no attempt to use the track and thus has no\nbasis to claim she was unable to access it or that the surface prevents RISD from\ndesignating the track as an alternative viewing area. She did not ask if her\nhusband and friends could be seated near her. She did not request to speak with\na stadium staff member to voice a complaint about the accessible seating or\nrequest additional accommodations or an alternate seating location. This was\nnot a weighing of evidence by the district court—Greer simply had no contrary\nevidence to dispute RISD’s summary judgment evidence that it provided\nprogram access to disabled individuals who successfully and regularly attended\n\n                                       17\n\f  Case: 10-11254    Document: 00511787980      Page: 18   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nevents, including football games, at Berkner B, nor did she present evidence that\na genuine issue of fact exists as to whether track access to watch football games\nat Berkner B fails the program accessibility test.        Under Greer’s argued\napproach, if district courts were required to find that a genuine issue of material\nfact existed in every case where the plaintiff simply asserted that his or her\nexperience was different than sworn testimony or evidence offered by the\ndefendant, every plaintiff could generate a genuine issue of “material” fact. This\nis not, and cannot be, the rule—in responding to a defendant’s motion for\nsummary judgment, a plaintiff “must do more than simply show that there is\nsome metaphysical doubt as to the material facts” and “must come forward with\nspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.” Matsushita Elec.\nIndus. Co., Ltd., 475 U.S. at 586 (internal quotation and citation omitted)\n(emphasis in original).\n      In summary, what the district court, and now this court, is presented with\nare Greer’s allegations that her experience watching a football game at Berkner\nB was unsatisfactory in her opinion. While unfortunate, this is not sufficient to\npresent a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the program access\nstandard and the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of RISD\nwas correct.\nC. Greer’s Motion for Sanctions\n      Greer also contends the district court erred by failing to grant her motion\nfor sanctions against RISD based on the school district’s failure to produce a\nspecific document defined by 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(a)(3) that explained the reasons\nmaking alterations to the stadium would result in an undue financial burden.\n      Under the highly deferential abuse of discretion standard, we cannot say\nthe district court erred in denying Greer’s motion. The district court’s order in\nresponse to Greer’s motion for findings of fact on her motion for sanctions set\nforth six logical and well-reasoned findings for denying the motion for sanctions.\n\n                                        18\n\f  Case: 10-11254    Document: 00511787980      Page: 19    Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nIn summary and most notably, the court noted that it allowed RISD to assert the\nundue burden affirmative defense “in light of the scattershot allegations [Greer]\npled in her Complaint, and the potential issues with regard to [Greer]’s standing\nto assert many of her claims under the [ADA],” that the undue burden defense\nwas not asserted in bad faith, and that consideration of the defense was mooted\nwhen Greer failed to meet her prima facie burden for an ADA discrimination\nclaim. Greer v. Richardson Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 3:08-CV-160-M (N.D. Tex. Aug.\n27, 2010) (Order regarding Plaintiff’s Motion for Findings of Fact on Plaintiff’s\nMotion to Strike Undue Burden Defense and for Sanctions).\n      While Greer strenuously argues that RISD failed to show that any undue\nburden analysis was ever made and thus RISD and its counsel asserted a\ndefense that had no evidentiary basis in fact, we disagree. As RISD notes, there\nis little case law on point as to what is required to satisfy the requirement under\n28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a)(3), which states:\n      In those circumstances where personnel of the public entity believe\n      that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the service,\n      program, or activity or would result in undue financial and\n      administrative burdens, a public entity has the burden of proving\n      that compliance with § 35.150(a) of this part would result in such\n      alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in\n      such alteration or burdens must be made by the head of a public\n      entity or his or her designee after considering all resources available\n      for use in the funding and operation of the service, program, or\n      activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the\n      reasons for reaching that conclusion.\n      Greer focuses on what she claims is RISD’s failure to demonstrate that any\nundue burden analysis was ever made as evidenced by RISD’s failure to produce\na “written statement” pursuant to § 35.150(a)(3). This argument however\nfocuses too narrowly on subsection (a)(3). Subsection (a)(3) is subordinate to the\ngeneral subsection (a) language that a public entity must conduct the undue\nburden analysis only in the event that, in order to provide program accessibility,\n\n\n                                        19\n\f  Case: 10-11254    Document: 00511787980      Page: 20   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nthe entity would be required to make a fundamental alteration in the nature of\nthe program.\n      Here, RISD had a nonfrivolous argument that it already provided program\naccess to events at Berkner B stadium and thus did not believe it was required\nto take any actions that would fundamentally alter the facility or the programs\noffered at Berkner B. RISD produced evidence about its evaluation of Berkner\nB’s facilities and the budgeting process used to allocate funds for upgrades or\nmodifications to all of the school district facilities, explaining that available\nfunds had been allocated first to student instruction facilities and the district’s\n“A” stadiums which serve varsity athletic events and are more heavily attended.\nUnder this reasonable belief and a plain reading of § 35.150(a) and (a)(3), it is\nnot clear that RISD was required to make a decision evidenced by a written\nstatement as envisioned under subsection (a)(3). To the extent that Greer’s new\nallegations in her second and third amended complaints filed in the midst of this\nlitigation drew that belief into question, RISD provided substantial discovery\nmaterials related to the analyses the school district performed when evaluating\nwhat modifications would be made to facilities in the district and how budgetary\nfunds would be allocated, by priority, to modification projects. Given these facts,\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion when it found RISD did not assert\nthe undue burden defense in bad faith.\nD. Application of Frame v. City of Arlington\n      While disposing of most of Greer’s claims on summary judgment in favor\nof RISD, the district court reserved two issues with respect to whether the\nBerkner B parking lot contained a sufficient number of accessible parking spaces\nand whether a wheelchair ramp from the parking lot to a sidewalk serving an\nadjacent street was ADA compliant. Following this court’s opinion pursuant to\na panel rehearing in Frame v. City of Arlington, 616 F.3d 476 (5th Cir. 2010)\n(“Frame II”), vacated and reh’g en banc granted, 632 F.3d 177 (5th Cir. 2011), the\n\n                                        20\n\f  Case: 10-11254   Document: 00511787980       Page: 21   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n                                 No. 10-11254\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of RISD on both remaining\nissues. Greer II, 752 F. Supp. 2d at 762–63.\n      In her opening brief filed in March 2011, Greer argued the district court\nmisinterpreted the opinion in Frame II and thus improperly granted summary\njudgment to RISD. After briefing was complete, this court issued an en banc\ndecision, Frame v. City of Arlington, 657 F.3d 215 (5th Cir. 2011) (en banc)\n(“Frame III”). At the direction of the court, the parties filed letter briefs to\naddress how the en banc decision in Frame may affect our review of the district\ncourt’s decision on the issue of the parking lot and the ramp.\n      Frame III reversed the panel’s opinion in Frame II that a private right of\naction regarding a non-compliant sidewalk only existed in the context that the\nsidewalk was a gateway to some other service, program, or activity. Frame II at\n488–90. Instead, the en banc court held that a non-compliant newly constructed\nsidewalk itself provided a private right of action under Title II without regard\nto the proximity of the sidewalk to the public service or program. Frame III at\n235. While the district court considered the parking spaces and ramp in the\ncontext of the gateway analysis, Greer II at 763, Frame III nonetheless does not\nchange the outcome here.\n      The parking lot and the ramp have both been modified or constructed after\n1992 and thus do not fall within the more flexible guidelines for existing\nfacilities. Instead, the ADAAG guidelines apply. The record establishes that the\nparking lot servicing the Berkner B stadium contains six accessible parking\nspaces, which complies with ADAAG guidelines for the number of accessible\nspaces. Additionally, the modifications to the parking lot, including allocation\nand placement of accessible parking spots, and the construction of the\nwheelchair ramp were completed pursuant to an inspection by a Registered\nAccessibility Specialist, which demonstrates compliance with the Texas\nAccessibility Standards (“TAS”). The TAS have been certified and approved by\n\n                                      21\n\f  Case: 10-11254   Document: 00511787980     Page: 22   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n                                No. 10-11254\n\nthe Department of Justice as being equivalent to the ADAAG.

For the following reasons, we affirm.\n                           FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n\n\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f   Case: 10-11254    Document: 00511787980      Page: 2   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\n      Greer, who uses a wheelchair for mobility as a result of a spinal cord\ninjury, attended her son’s junior varsity football game at RISD’s Berkner B\nstadium, located at Berkner High School in Richardson, Texas, on October 4,\n2007. After entering the stadium, Greer realized that the only way to access the\nstadium’s bleacher seating was by climbing a flight of stairs. Unable to access\nthe stadium’s bleachers, Greer maneuvered her wheelchair to an accessible\npaved area adjacent to the bleachers where she watched the football game\nthrough a chain link fence that surrounds the field while her husband watched\nthe game from the bleachers. From her viewpoint, Greer claims she was only\nable to observe roughly 15% of the game due to her view being blocked by\nfootball players standing on the sideline. She also claims the area, while\naccessible by a wheelchair, was slightly sloped, which required her to hold on to\nthe fence to avoid slowly rolling backwards. It is not disputed that Greer was\nable to access other aspects of the stadium, including being able to park at the\nstadium, navigate from the parking lot to the stadium, buy a ticket to the game,\nand buy a hot dog and beverage at the concession stand.\n      On February 1, 2008, Greer sued RISD, claiming that it discriminated\nagainst her by excluding her from participation in the benefits, programs and\nactivities of a governmental entity receiving federal assistance, in violation of\nTitle II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\n29 U.S.C. §§ 794 and 794a. The basis of Greer’s original complaint focused solely\non her exclusion from the bleachers at Berkner B stadium.\n      The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment in December 2008.\nAt a motion hearing on March 4, 2009, the district court granted leave for RISD\nto amend its answer to assert the affirmative defense of “undue burden” with\nrespect to making accessibility modifications to the Berkner B stadium and\nreopened discovery as to that limited issue. On July 9, 2009, the Court granted\nGreer leave to file a Second Amended Complaint, in which she expanded her\n\n                                        2\n\f   Case: 10-11254      Document: 00511787980   Page: 3   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nclaims to include accessibility allegations regarding other aspects of the Berkner\nB stadium including restroom access, curb cuts, ramp access to a public right of\nway, and access to the track surrounding the football field. RISD then filed a\nThird Amended Answer on July 17, 2009.\n      Both parties again filed cross-motions for summary judgment on August\n3, 2009, and Greer also filed a motion to extend discovery and allow subsequent\nbriefing on RISD’s defense that modifications to the Berkner B stadium would\nrepresent an undue burden. The district court granted Greer’s motion and\nextended the case deadlines once again.\n      On February 1, 2010, the parties filed their third and final cross-motions\nfor summary judgment. Greer also filed a Motion to Strike Undue Burden\nDefense and for Sanctions on April 21, 2010, claiming RISD’s undue burden\ndefense was asserted in bad faith. Greer’s motion argued that RISD never had\na factual basis for asserting the undue burden defense because it never produced\nevidence that it had conducted the three-part analysis required under 28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.150(a)(3).\n      The district court granted RISD’s motion for summary judgment in part\non August 2, 2010, finding that Greer failed to present a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination under Section II of the ADA.

ADA and Existing Structures\n       Title II of the ADA states that “no qualified individual with a disability\nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied\nthe benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be\nsubjected to discrimination by any such entity.”1 42 U.S.C. § 12132; see also 28\nC.F.R. § 35.130(a) (“No qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis\n\n\n\n       1\n           Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides nearly identical language. “No\notherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, . . . , shall, solely by\nreason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of,\nor be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial\nassistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Because the language and standards are virtually identical\nfor Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, we consider Greer’s claims\nunder both statutes concurrently but will refer only to the ADA for brevity. See 28 C.F.R. pt.\n35, app. B (“Because title II of the ADA essentially extends the antidiscrimination prohibition\nembodied in section 504 to all actions of State and local governments, the standards adopted\nin this part are generally the same as those required under section 504 for federally assisted\nprograms.”).\n\n                                                5\n\f   Case: 10-11254      Document: 00511787980         Page: 6    Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                      No. 10-11254\n\nof disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the\nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to\ndiscrimination by any public entity”). The implementation of Title II and the\nconstruction and access requirements, as it pertains to ensuring public facilities\nare accessible to individuals with disabilities, are articulated in the ADAAG\nregulations. These regulations provide the minimum technical requirements for\nADA compliance for newly constructed facilities and for alterations made to\nexisting facilities. 28 C.F.R. pt. 36 app. A.2 There is no dispute that RISD is a\ngovernmental entity of the State of Texas and is subject to the requirements of\nthe ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the relevant implementing regulations.\n       When enacting the ADA, Congress acknowledged that some public entities\noperating then-existing buildings and structures would be unable to comply with\nall technical aspects of the new ADAAG regulations.                    Accordingly, the\nregulations promulgated by the United States Attorney General to implement\nthe requirements of Title II differentiate between structures built prior to the\nAct taking effect in January 1992 (“existing facilities”) and facilities built or\naltered after January 1992.

The accessibility requirements for existing facilities are less\nstringent and more flexible than for new facilities. “[I]n the case of older\nfacilities, for which structural change is likely to be more difficult, a public entity\nmay comply with Title II by adopting a variety of less costly measures, including\nrelocating services to alternative, accessible sites and assigning aides to assist\npersons with disabilities in accessing services.” Lane, 541 U.S. at 532. It is\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          The Rehabilitation Act has a set of standards nearly identical to the ADAAG called\nthe Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (“UFAS”). 41 C.F.R. pt. 101–19.6, app. A. Public\nentities subject to Title II may comply with either set of standards when constructing a new\nfacility or altering an existing facility. 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(c).\n\n                                             6\n\f   Case: 10-11254        Document: 00511787980           Page: 7      Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                         No. 10-11254\n\nundisputed that RISD’s Berkner B stadium, built in 1968, qualifies as an\nexisting structure.\n         When considering ADA compliance for such existing structures, the\ntouchstone is thus not the facility’s technical compliance with the ADAAG, but\nis instead “program accessibility.” “A public entity shall operate each service,\nprogram, or activity so that the service, program, or activity, when viewed in its\nentirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.” 28\nC.F.R. § 35.150(a). Making a program or activity accessible under this standard\ndoes not require a public entity to make all of its existing facilities accessible to\ndisabled individuals nor does it require a public entity to take an action that\nwould place an undue burden on the entity. Id. at (a)(1), (3). Furthermore, the\nregulations do not provide any objective criteria for evaluating program\naccessibility.      While an existing facility’s compliance with the ADAAG\nregulations may be informative, program accessibility is ultimately a subjective\ndetermination by viewing the program or activity at issue in its entirety and not\nsolely by evaluating individual elements of the facility where the program is\nheld.3\n\n\n         3\n           While there is little precedent in this circuit regarding the application of the ADAAG\nto existing facilities, we note that courts in various other circuits have refused to strictly apply\nADAAG requirements to existing facilities but instead rely on the ADAAG for guidance.

Melton, 391 F.3d at 672.4 To determine whether\nRISD discriminated against Greer on the basis of her disability, we rely on the\nlanguage      of   the     ADA      itself   and     its   applicable       definition     of\ndiscrimination—whether the junior varsity football game at Berkner B was an\naccessible program at an existing facility. If the football game is not readily\naccessible to someone with a disability, Greer may have stated a prima facie case\nof discrimination. On the other hand, if it is apparent that RISD provides\nsufficient program access to football games held at Berkner B, Greer has failed\nto establish a prima facie case and the district court was correct in denying\nGreer’s summary judgment motion.\n       The parties do not dispute that Greer satisfies elements one and three in\nestablishing a prima facie case: she is a qualified individual under the ADA and\n\n\nrelevant but not determinative; it is one consideration from which the court may conclude that\nnoncompliance impedes access.”).\n       4\n         Greer fails to recognize this difference and attempts to equate her situation with a\nblack spectator forced to watch the game from an area separated from the general public\nbleacher seating. Reply Brief for Appellant at 12–13. This is a flawed analogy and evidences\na misunderstanding of disability discrimination claims under the ADA.\n\n                                              8\n\f   Case: 10-11254    Document: 00511787980      Page: 9   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nany alleged exclusion or discrimination was a result of her disability—her\ninability to access the Berkner B bleachers while in a wheelchair. As a result,\nthe primary question before this court is whether the district court properly\nfound that Greer failed to satisfy element two, and thus failed to present a prima\nfacie case, by showing that there was insufficient program access when she\nattended the football game at Berkner B.\n      Establishing    exactly   what   constitutes    sufficient   access   to   the\n“program”—watching her son’s football game—was a primary concern of the\ndistrict court and continues to be a matter of debate on appeal. The following\nexchange between the district court and Greer’s counsel at the hearing on the\nparties’ cross-motions for summary judgment is instructive.\n      The district court:\n      That the key issue with respect to this subject, as the plaintiff would\n      characterize it, is that [providing alternative accessible viewing\n      areas] doesn’t do because it’s not just watching the game that\n      matters, which Ms. Greer, or others, seated in one of those areas\n      could do, but it is the experience of watching the game with the\n      other fans.\n      Greer’s counsel in response:\n      But to the extent that the basic argument is that are you entitled to\n      keep the disabled out of the general seating area versus not, then I\n      would agree that that is a fair assessment of one of the central\n      issues before the Court.”\n      In light of the prior proceedings and the parties’ briefs, we understand\nGreer’s general contention to be this: “program access” is more than just the\nability to watch the football game at the Berkner B stadium. Instead program\naccess requires that a disabled individual such as Greer not only be able to\nwatch the game but also experience the game from the general admission public\nbleachers so as to not be separated from other attendees.\n\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\f  Case: 10-11254       Document: 00511787980         Page: 10     Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                      No. 10-11254\n\n       There is an aspect of Greer’s segregation argument that rings true as\nnoted by the district court during its hearing on the cross-motions for summary\njudgment. It would likely not be permissible for a public entity such as RISD to\nclaim it provides program access if it required disabled individuals to sit alone\nin an area far removed from her companions and other attendees, such as behind\nthe goal posts at the end of the field, when all other attendees were seated along\nthe sidelines. Yet we need not determine where that line exists here—how far\naway is too far away—because, as the photos in the record show, all of the\naccessible seating offered by RISD is either immediately adjacent to or in front\nof the bleacher seating for the general public.\n       However, we disagree with Greer’s suggestion that any separation from\nthe general public seating area is ipso facto discrimination and we do not agree\nwith Greer’s argument that she was denied program access at the Berkner B\nstadium. Like the district court, we note that much of Greer’s argument focuses\non “the actual state of ADAAG compliance at the facility” and conflates these\nobservations about facility deviations from ADAAG standards, which are\napplicable to newly constructed or modified facilities, with RISD’s obligation to\nprovide program access at an existing facility.5\n       In making these arguments, Greer attempts to completely nullify the\n“program access” standard of review by asserting that, based on RISD’s\nadmission that the bleachers are not accessible and therefore wheelchair-bound\nvisitors to Berkner B are provided alternate seating areas, RISD must prove that\n\n\n       5\n          The basis for much of the confusion appears to be Greer’s insistence throughout the\nlitigation to apply a strict, technical definition of “accessible” as defined in the ADAAG to\nmean compliance with the ADAAG standards. She fails to appreciate that the word\n“accessible” was used throughout the litigation to discuss whether events at Berkner B were\naccessible in the context of “program accessibility,” as opposed to accessible under the\ntechnical limits of the ADAAG. See, e.g., Greer I, 752 F. Supp. 2d at 754 (“Greer’s own\ntestimony shows that events at Berkner B Field as a whole are accessible to wheelchair-bound\nindividuals.”) (emphasis added).\n\n                                             10\n\f  Case: 10-11254     Document: 00511787980       Page: 11   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                   No. 10-11254\n\nmodifying the stadium seating would constitute an undue financial burden in\norder for RISD to avoid summary judgment. This however is not an accurate\ninterpretation of the law. As an operator of an existing facility, RISD need only\nshow that the program offered at Berkner B, when viewed in its entirety, is\nreadily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. 28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.150(a). Thus, despite Greer’s protests that RISD’s repeated statements that\nit “is not legally obligated to provide bleacher access for a mobility-impaired\nindividual who has designated accessible seating available in an alternate area”\nare incorrect, RISD’s statement is a valid interpretation of the law. As an\nexisting facility, RISD’s duty is to provide program access to events at Berkner\nB, which may be achieved without providing access to the bleachers.\n      Furthermore, Greer’s argument that “Keeping the disabled out of the\npublic seating—without any justification—is a denial of program access on its\nface,” Reply Br. 10, would render the “program access” standard meaningless.\nUnder such a reading, a public entity would be required in all cases to modify\nexisting facilities whenever the general public seating area was not wheelchair\naccessible or ADAAG compliant. Yet this is precisely what the program access\nstandard for existing facilities was meant to avoid by allowing public entities to\nensure that disabled individuals can readily access the program at the facility\nbut not necessarily all aspects of the facility itself.\n      As an example of conflating program access with facility access, Greer\nasserts in her opening brief that “The undisputed expert testimony in the case\nis that the [track] surface is not accessible” as an alternative seating area and\nsupports the statement with citations to the record. However, the cited portions\nof the record consist of only two items: (1) a portion of her expert’s report\nclaiming that the surface would not comply with current ADAAG standards (but\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f  Case: 10-11254        Document: 00511787980          Page: 12     Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                        No. 10-11254\n\nlacking any objective measurements in support of the claim),6 and (2) a RISD\nrepresentative’s response to a deposition question from Greer’s counsel in which\nthe individual simply answers “I don’t know” to whether the track would have\nto meet ADAAG new construction standards for an accessible surface.7 Despite\nGreer’s arguments, the focus of the district court’s finding, and our review,\nremains on the accessibility of the program and not technical compliance with\nADAAG in an existing facility. And on this point, we agree with the district\ncourt that RISD provided program access at Berkner B stadium.\n       Laid bare, Greer’s claims in her motion for summary judgment consist only\nof her own statements of dissatisfaction from her experience at one football game\nat Berkner B and her expert’s report that opines on various deviations of\nBerkner B’s structural elements from current ADAAG requirements for new or\nmodified facilities. Many of the observations in the expert report do not relate\nto whether RISD provides program access to disabled individuals attending\n\n       6\n       While Greer repeatedly cites her expert’s report that states the track surface does not\ncomply with ADAAG, her expert subsequently testified that he “d[idn’t] have any idea”\nwhether a wheelchair could roll on the track surface. Greer I, 752 F. Supp. 2d at 755.\n       7\n          We note that this type of borderline misrepresentation has been present throughout\nthe case. The district court, upon recommendation of a magistrate judge, awarded attorneys’\nfees to RISD due to Greer’s counsels’ reckless arguments in her motion for summary judgment.\nSee Greer v.

For\nexample, Greer’s opening brief states, in part: “The undisputed facts show that there is no way\nto view the program, service, or activity at Berkner in its entirety as readily accessible to and\nusable by individuals with disabilities, when there is nothing readily accessible to and usable\nat Berkner stadium.” Brief for Appellant at 25–26. Greer’s own testimony belies the statement\nthat “nothing is readily accessible” as Greer testified that she was able to park at the stadium,\npurchase a ticket, enter the stadium, make a purchase at the concession stand, and watch at\nleast a portion of the game.\n\n                                               12\n\f  Case: 10-11254    Document: 00511787980     Page: 13    Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nevents at Berkner B and others are inapposite because Greer failed to offer\nevidence that the allegedly non-compliant structures in or around the Berkner\nB stadium have been modified since the ADA was enacted in 1992 and thus may\nbe required to comply with the ADAAG requirements. Additionally, Greer has\nfailed to demonstrate how minor deviations from the ADAAG requirements in\nvarious parts of the stadium identified by her expert, such as a quarter-inch\nvariance in “maximum beveled slope” on one designated wheelchair viewing area\nor bathroom mirrors that are mounted seven inches too high, prevent her or\nother disabled individuals from accessing the program at Berkner B, i.e.,\nwatching a football game.\n      Instead, the district court was correct that, based on the evidence offered\nby RISD in support of its motion for summary judgment and not contradicted by\nGreer, Berkner B stadium provides program accessibility when viewed in its\nentirety. RISD provided sworn statements from two individuals that use\nwheelchairs when they attend events at Berkner B, both of whom stated that\nthey had no issues attending events. Greer I, 752 F. Supp. 2d at 754–55. Greer\nherself admitted she was able to access the parking lot, navigate into the\nstadium, buy a ticket, make a purchase from the concession stand, and view a\nportion of the game.\n      Nonetheless, as Greer points out, “seeing the program is the entire reason\nfor going.” Most attendees at a high school football game, particularly parents\nof students playing in the game, are not going to the stadium for the quality of\nthe hot dogs at the concession stand. Thus, being able to do things such as\nbuying a ticket and visiting the concession stand would not be sufficient to\nprovide program access if she was unable to view the actual football game.\n      Even taking as true Greer’s claim that she was only able to see 15% of the\ngame from her vantage point next to the bleachers, the problem with Greer’s\nsingle experience is that it appears to be, at least in part, a product of her own\n\n                                       13\n\f  Case: 10-11254       Document: 00511787980          Page: 14      Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n\n                                       No. 10-11254\n\nchoices and was strongly contradicted by RISD’s evidence. She acknowledges\nthat she never asked if she could be accommodated by sitting somewhere else in\nthe stadium, such as the track that surrounds the football field, that would have\nprovided an unobstructed view.8 She did not ask anyone at the stadium if her\nhusband or friends could be accommodated by being provided chairs to sit next\nto her. She admits she did not even attempt to use the women’s restroom and\nthus has no basis for her claim that the restroom is not accessible other than her\nexpert’s findings that certain aspects of the restrooms do not meet ADAAG\nrequirements for newly constructed facilities.\n       Moreover, this was a single experience for Greer in contrast to the sworn\nstatements by other disabled individuals who have attended numerous events\nat Berkner B without issues. Had she returned to the stadium several times and\nroutinely not been provided suitable seating despite attempting to seek out event\nstaff or asking for better accommodations, her prima facie claim might ring true.\nHowever, based on the record before this court, she has not returned to Berkner\nB stadium and thus her claims are tied to her single experience at the facility.\n       By pointing out Greer’s failure to make any inquiry regarding more\nsuitable accommodations, we do not imply that the burden is or should be on\ndisabled individuals to actively request accessible accommodations in all\nsituations.9 As this court, and courts in other circuits have held, there is a\ncommon sense aspect to determining whether a public entity has provided\naccommodations for a disabled individual, part of which requires the public\n\n       8\n          Greer was asked during her deposition, “Did you ask anyone whether there were\nother places to set up?” She answered, “No, and I shouldn’t have to.” She was also asked “Did\nyou ask [the person selling tickets at the entrance to the stadium] about accessibility when you\ngot there?” Greer answered: “No, because I was right at the gate. I didn’t really experience\nanything until I got past that gentleman.”\n       9\n          In an employment context, there is a general responsibility for an individual with a\ndisability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed.

Aug. 9, 2006) (collecting cases from multiple circuits). Taken together,\nthere is a balance to be struck between a disabled individual’s need to request\naccommodations when limitations are not obvious or apparent and a public\nentity’s duty to provide accommodations without further notice or a request. Id.\n      Under the facts here, when a disabled individual such as Greer attends\none event at a venue she was otherwise unfamiliar with, that person does not by\ndefault gain a prima facie case of discrimination under Title II merely because\nshe is dissatisfied with her seating location and makes no effort to ask the\nvenue’s staff as to where alternative accessible seating is located or if she and\nher family can be accommodated. By Greer’s own admission, she was able to\naccess all aspects of the stadium she attempted to use during her visit—the\nparking lot, the sidewalks, the ticket booth, the concession stand, and one of the\nseveral accessible seating areas. Her argument focuses on her inability to see\nthe whole game from her viewing point for the game without giving RISD any\nopportunity to reaccommodate her or her companions such that she could have\na better viewpoint. Considering the size and types of events held at Berkner B,\nsuch as football games and track meets, it is unclear how RISD officials would\nbe able to develop a universal accessibility plan that would always satisfy the\n\n                                        15\n\f  Case: 10-11254    Document: 00511787980      Page: 16   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nviewing preferences for disabled individuals other than by what they have\nalready done—providing several alternative accessible seating areas. Stated\ndifferently, simply asking a few questions of the event venue’s staff for more\nsuitable accommodations is likely to be more effective and consistent with case\nlaw than remaining silent and resorting to a Title II discrimination claim in the\nfederal court system.\n      Even setting aside whether Greer sought out any accommodations, her\nsingle experience at Berkner B does not reflect RISD’s accessibility policies or\nthe uncontroverted experiences of other disabled individuals that have regularly\nattended events at Berkner B. RISD’s stated policy, uncontroverted by Greer,\nstates: “The District provides accessible parking, an accessible entrance,\nemployees who are available to assist patrons who desire assistance, and an\nability for all patrons, including individuals with disabilities, to participate in\nor view the events and programs at the Berkner B Field. Patrons of the Berkner\nB Field, including individuals with disabilities and their companions, are\nprovided seating on the track, behind the fence, or any other accessible area so\nthat they can participate in or view the events and programs.” The testimony\nfrom two regular attendees of events at Berkner B reinforce the veracity of\nRISD’s policy, as both individuals testified that they have always been provided\naccessible seating with their companions, often on the track, and that neither\nattendee had difficulties accessing any of the Berkner B facilities, including\nnavigating on the track surface in their wheelchairs. One of the two individuals\neven noted that a seat on the track provides a better view than a seat in the\nbleachers. Greer I, 752 F. Supp. 2d at 754–55.\n      While Greer decries the district court’s reliance on such statements as an\nimproper weighing of evidence at the summary judgment stage, we disagree\nwith Greer’s characterization. The parties had simultaneously submitted cross-\nmotions for summary judgment. Thus, what at first glance may appear to be a\n\n                                        16\n\f  Case: 10-11254    Document: 00511787980     Page: 17    Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nweighing of evidence is actually a sequential analysis of each party’s motion.\nAlthough the district court announced its decision on each party’s respective\nmotion in a single paragraph, the motions were considered separately. Id. at\n755–56.\n      First, the district court denied Greer’s motion, finding that she had not\npresented a prima facie case of discrimination. Second, the court granted RISD’s\nmotion, on the basis of evidence it offered, finding that events at Berkner B are\naccessible to wheelchair-bound individuals based on Greer’s own testimony and\nsworn testimony of other wheelchair-bound individuals that regularly attend\nevents at the stadium. Though not highlighted explicitly in the district court’s\nopinion, Greer, as the nonmoving party in response to RISD’s motion, needed to\ncome forward with affidavits or other similar evidence to show that a genuine\nissue of material fact exists with respect to program access. See Matsushita Elec.\nIndus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111620\"><a href=\"/opinion/111620/matsushita-electric-industrial-co-ltd-v-zenith-radio-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 586 (1986).\n      In responding to RISD’s motion, Greer relied only on her own single\nexperience and an expert report focused on facility access and failed to produce\nany countervailing evidence to show that a genuine issue of material fact existed\nwith respect to program access. She offered no contradicting evidence about\nprogram access at Berkner B such as being refused more agreeable accessible\nseating such as the track. She made no attempt to use the track and thus has no\nbasis to claim she was unable to access it or that the surface prevents RISD from\ndesignating the track as an alternative viewing area. She did not ask if her\nhusband and friends could be seated near her. She did not request to speak with\na stadium staff member to voice a complaint about the accessible seating or\nrequest additional accommodations or an alternate seating location. This was\nnot a weighing of evidence by the district court—Greer simply had no contrary\nevidence to dispute RISD’s summary judgment evidence that it provided\nprogram access to disabled individuals who successfully and regularly attended\n\n                                       17\n\f  Case: 10-11254    Document: 00511787980      Page: 18   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nevents, including football games, at Berkner B, nor did she present evidence that\na genuine issue of fact exists as to whether track access to watch football games\nat Berkner B fails the program accessibility test.        Under Greer’s argued\napproach, if district courts were required to find that a genuine issue of material\nfact existed in every case where the plaintiff simply asserted that his or her\nexperience was different than sworn testimony or evidence offered by the\ndefendant, every plaintiff could generate a genuine issue of “material” fact. This\nis not, and cannot be, the rule—in responding to a defendant’s motion for\nsummary judgment, a plaintiff “must do more than simply show that there is\nsome metaphysical doubt as to the material facts” and “must come forward with\nspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.” Matsushita Elec.\nIndus. Co., Ltd., 475 U.S. at 586 (internal quotation and citation omitted)\n(emphasis in original).\n      In summary, what the district court, and now this court, is presented with\nare Greer’s allegations that her experience watching a football game at Berkner\nB was unsatisfactory in her opinion. While unfortunate, this is not sufficient to\npresent a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the program access\nstandard and the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of RISD\nwas correct.\nC. Greer’s Motion for Sanctions\n      Greer also contends the district court erred by failing to grant her motion\nfor sanctions against RISD based on the school district’s failure to produce a\nspecific document defined by 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(a)(3) that explained the reasons\nmaking alterations to the stadium would result in an undue financial burden.\n      Under the highly deferential abuse of discretion standard, we cannot say\nthe district court erred in denying Greer’s motion. The district court’s order in\nresponse to Greer’s motion for findings of fact on her motion for sanctions set\nforth six logical and well-reasoned findings for denying the motion for sanctions.\n\n                                        18\n\f  Case: 10-11254    Document: 00511787980      Page: 19    Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nIn summary and most notably, the court noted that it allowed RISD to assert the\nundue burden affirmative defense “in light of the scattershot allegations [Greer]\npled in her Complaint, and the potential issues with regard to [Greer]’s standing\nto assert many of her claims under the [ADA],” that the undue burden defense\nwas not asserted in bad faith, and that consideration of the defense was mooted\nwhen Greer failed to meet her prima facie burden for an ADA discrimination\nclaim. Greer v. Richardson Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 3:08-CV-160-M (N.D. Tex. Aug.\n27, 2010) (Order regarding Plaintiff’s Motion for Findings of Fact on Plaintiff’s\nMotion to Strike Undue Burden Defense and for Sanctions).\n      While Greer strenuously argues that RISD failed to show that any undue\nburden analysis was ever made and thus RISD and its counsel asserted a\ndefense that had no evidentiary basis in fact, we disagree. As RISD notes, there\nis little case law on point as to what is required to satisfy the requirement under\n28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a)(3), which states:\n      In those circumstances where personnel of the public entity believe\n      that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the service,\n      program, or activity or would result in undue financial and\n      administrative burdens, a public entity has the burden of proving\n      that compliance with § 35.150(a) of this part would result in such\n      alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in\n      such alteration or burdens must be made by the head of a public\n      entity or his or her designee after considering all resources available\n      for use in the funding and operation of the service, program, or\n      activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the\n      reasons for reaching that conclusion.\n      Greer focuses on what she claims is RISD’s failure to demonstrate that any\nundue burden analysis was ever made as evidenced by RISD’s failure to produce\na “written statement” pursuant to § 35.150(a)(3). This argument however\nfocuses too narrowly on subsection (a)(3). Subsection (a)(3) is subordinate to the\ngeneral subsection (a) language that a public entity must conduct the undue\nburden analysis only in the event that, in order to provide program accessibility,\n\n\n                                        19\n\f  Case: 10-11254    Document: 00511787980      Page: 20   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n                                  No. 10-11254\n\nthe entity would be required to make a fundamental alteration in the nature of\nthe program.\n      Here, RISD had a nonfrivolous argument that it already provided program\naccess to events at Berkner B stadium and thus did not believe it was required\nto take any actions that would fundamentally alter the facility or the programs\noffered at Berkner B. RISD produced evidence about its evaluation of Berkner\nB’s facilities and the budgeting process used to allocate funds for upgrades or\nmodifications to all of the school district facilities, explaining that available\nfunds had been allocated first to student instruction facilities and the district’s\n“A” stadiums which serve varsity athletic events and are more heavily attended.\nUnder this reasonable belief and a plain reading of § 35.150(a) and (a)(3), it is\nnot clear that RISD was required to make a decision evidenced by a written\nstatement as envisioned under subsection (a)(3). To the extent that Greer’s new\nallegations in her second and third amended complaints filed in the midst of this\nlitigation drew that belief into question, RISD provided substantial discovery\nmaterials related to the analyses the school district performed when evaluating\nwhat modifications would be made to facilities in the district and how budgetary\nfunds would be allocated, by priority, to modification projects. Given these facts,\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion when it found RISD did not assert\nthe undue burden defense in bad faith.\nD. Application of Frame v. City of Arlington\n      While disposing of most of Greer’s claims on summary judgment in favor\nof RISD, the district court reserved two issues with respect to whether the\nBerkner B parking lot contained a sufficient number of accessible parking spaces\nand whether a wheelchair ramp from the parking lot to a sidewalk serving an\nadjacent street was ADA compliant.

Greer II, 752 F. Supp. 2d at 762–63.\n      In her opening brief filed in March 2011, Greer argued the district court\nmisinterpreted the opinion in Frame II and thus improperly granted summary\njudgment to RISD. After briefing was complete, this court issued an en banc\ndecision, Frame v. City of Arlington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"183771\"><a href=\"/opinion/183771/frame-v-city-of-arlington/\"><span class=\"volume\">657</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2011) (en banc)\n(“Frame III”). At the direction of the court, the parties filed letter briefs to\naddress how the en banc decision in Frame may affect our review of the district\ncourt’s decision on the issue of the parking lot and the ramp.\n      Frame III reversed the panel’s opinion in Frame II that a private right of\naction regarding a non-compliant sidewalk only existed in the context that the\nsidewalk was a gateway to some other service, program, or activity. Frame II at\n488–90. Instead, the en banc court held that a non-compliant newly constructed\nsidewalk itself provided a private right of action under Title II without regard\nto the proximity of the sidewalk to the public service or program. Frame III at\n235. While the district court considered the parking spaces and ramp in the\ncontext of the gateway analysis, Greer II at 763, Frame III nonetheless does not\nchange the outcome here.\n      The parking lot and the ramp have both been modified or constructed after\n1992 and thus do not fall within the more flexible guidelines for existing\nfacilities. Instead, the ADAAG guidelines apply. The record establishes that the\nparking lot servicing the Berkner B stadium contains six accessible parking\nspaces, which complies with ADAAG guidelines for the number of accessible\nspaces. Additionally, the modifications to the parking lot, including allocation\nand placement of accessible parking spots, and the construction of the\nwheelchair ramp were completed pursuant to an inspection by a Registered\nAccessibility Specialist, which demonstrates compliance with the Texas\nAccessibility Standards (“TAS”). The TAS have been certified and approved by\n\n                                      21\n\f  Case: 10-11254   Document: 00511787980     Page: 22   Date Filed: 03/14/2012\n\n\n                                No. 10-11254\n\nthe Department of Justice as being equivalent to the ADAAG.

The TAS received equivalency certification on September 23, 1996.”).\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor\nof RISD on these two issues. Rockwell v.
