Because we\nconclude that exclusionary conduct, such as the exclusive\ndealing and bundled rebates proven here, can sustain a\nverdict under § 2 against a monopolist and because we find\nno other reversible error, we will affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n                    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n  3M, which manufactures Scotch tape for home and office\nuse, dominated the United States transparent tape market\nwith a market share above 90% until the early 1990s. It\nhas conceded that it has a monopoly in that market.\nLePage’s,1 founded in 1876, has sold a variety of office\n\n1. The plaintiffs in this action are LePage’s Incorporated and LePage’s\nManagement Company, L.L.C. Inasmuch as we can discern no\ndistinction between their interests, we refer to them jointly as LePage’s.\n\f                                     4\n\n\nproducts and, around 1980, decided to sell “second brand”\nand private label transparent tape, i.e., tape sold under the\nretailer’s name rather than under the name of the\nmanufacturer. By 1992, LePage’s sold 88% of private label\ntape sales in the United States, which represented but a\nsmall portion of the transparent tape market. Private label\ntape sold at a lower price to the retailer and the customer\nthan branded tape.\n  Distribution   patterns   and     consumer    acceptance\naccounted for a shift of some tape sales from branded tape\nto private label tape. With the rapid growth of office\nsuperstores, such as Staples and Office Depot, and mass\nmerchandisers, such as Wal-Mart and Kmart, distribution\npatterns for second brand and private label tape changed\nas many of the large retailers wanted to use their “brand\nnames” to sell stationery products, including transparent\ntape. 3M also entered the private label business during the\nearly 1990s and sold its own second brand under the name\n“Highland.”\n   LePage’s claims that, in response to the growth of this\ncompetitive market, 3M engaged in a series of related,\nanticompetitive acts aimed at restricting the availability of\nlower-priced transparent tape to consumers. It also claims\nthat 3M devised programs that prevented LePage’s and the\nother domestic company in the business, Tesa Tuck, Inc.,\nfrom gaining or maintaining large volume sales and that 3M\nmaintained its monopoly by stifling growth of private label\ntape and by coordinating efforts aimed at large distributors\nto keep retail prices for Scotch tape high.2 LePage’s claims\nthat it barely was surviving at the time of trial and that it\nsuffered large operating losses from 1996 through 1999.\n  LePage’s brought this antitrust action asserting that 3M\nused its monopoly over its Scotch tape brand to gain a\ncompetitive advantage in the private label tape portion of\nthe transparent tape market in the United States through\nthe use of 3M’s multi-tiered “bundled rebate” structure,\n\n2. It appears that at least at the times material to this action, there were\nno other domestic manufacturers of transparent tape. There were,\nhowever, foreign manufacturers but they did not play a significant role\nin the domestic market and 3M does not contend otherwise.\n\f                                  5\n\n\nwhich offered higher rebates when customers purchased\nproducts in a number of 3M’s different product lines.\nLePage’s also alleges that 3M offered to some of LePage’s\ncustomers large lump-sum cash payments, promotional\nallowances and other cash incentives to encourage them to\nenter into exclusive dealing arrangements with 3M.\n   LePage’s asserted claims for unlawful agreements in\nrestraint of trade under § 1 of the Sherman Act,\nmonopolization and attempted monopolization under § 2 of\nthe Sherman Act, and exclusive dealing under § 3 of the\nClayton Act. After a nine week trial, the jury returned its\nverdict for LePage’s on both its monopolization and\nattempted monopolization claims under § 2 of the Sherman\nAct, and assessed damages of $22,828,899 on each. It\nfound in 3M’s favor on LePage’s claims under § 1 of the\nSherman Act and § 3 of the Clayton Act. 3M filed its\nmotions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial,\narguing that its rebate and discount programs and the\nother conduct of which LePage’s complained did not\nconstitute the basis for a valid antitrust claim as a matter\nof law and that, in any event, the court’s charge to the jury\nwas insufficiently specific and LePage’s damages proof was\nspeculative.3 The District Court granted 3M’s motion for\njudgment as a matter of law on LePage’s “attempted\nmaintenance of monopoly power” claim but denied 3M’s\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law in all other respects\nand denied its motion for new trial. LePage’s Inc. v. 3M, No.\nCIV. A.97-3983, 2000 WL 280350 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 14, 2000).\nThe Court subsequently entered a judgment for trebled\ndamages of $68,486,697 to which interest was to be added.\nLePage’s filed a cross appeal on the District Court’s\njudgment dismissing its attempted maintenance of\nmonopoly power claim.\n  On appeal, the panel of this court before which this case\nwas originally argued reversed the District Court’s\njudgment on LePage’s § 2 claim by a divided vote. LePage’s\nInc. v. 3M, Nos. 00-1368 and 00-1473 (3d Cir. Jan. 14,\n2002). This court granted LePage’s motion for rehearing en\n\n3. 3M unsuccessfully had moved for a judgment as a matter of law at the\nclose of LePage’s case and after the close of the entire case.\n\f                             6\n\n\nbanc and, pursuant to its practice, vacated the panel\nopinion. LePage’s Inc. v. 3M, Nos. 00-1368 and 00-1473 (3d\nCir. Feb. 25, 2002) (order vacating panel opinion). The\nappeal was then orally argued before the court en banc.\n\n                            II.\n\n     JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  The District Court had jurisdiction over this case\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1337(a) because\nLePage’s brought these claims under the Sherman and\nClayton Acts. We have jurisdiction over this appeal\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n   We exercise plenary review over an order granting or\ndenying a motion for judgment as a matter of law. Shade v.\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 154 F.3d 143, 149 (3d Cir.\n1998). When, as here, a defendant makes such a motion, a\ncourt should grant it “only if, viewing the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the nonmovant and giving it the\nadvantage of every fair and reasonable inference, there is\ninsufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could\nfind liability.” Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d\n1153, 1166 (3d Cir. 1993). Thus, we review the evidence on\nthe appeal in the light most favorable to LePage’s. As the\nhistorical facts are not in sharp dispute, and our opinion\nturns largely on legal determinations, we review questions\nof law underlying the jury verdict on a plenary basis. Bloom\nv. Consolidated Rail Corp., 41 F.3d 911, 913 (3d Cir. 1994).\n   Our review of a jury’s verdict is limited to determining\nwhether some evidence in the record supports the jury’s\nverdict. See Swineford v. Snyder County, 15 F.3d 1258,\n1265 (3d Cir. 1994) (“A jury verdict will not be overturned\nunless the record is critically deficient of that quantum of\nevidence from which a jury could have rationally reached\nits verdict.”).\n\f                                  7\n\n\n                                 III.\n\nMONOPOLIZATION — APPLICABLE LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n  Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides:\n       Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to\n     monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other\n     person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade\n     or commerce among the several States, or with foreign\n     nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on\n     conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not\n     exceeding $10,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other\n     person, $350,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding\n     three years, or by both said punishments, in the\n     discretion of the court.\n15 U.S.C. § 2 (2002). A private party may sue for damages\nfor violation of this provision and recover threefold the\ndamages and counsel fees. Id. § 15.\n   Because this section is in sweeping language, suggesting\nthe breadth of its coverage, we look to the Supreme Court\ndecisions for elucidation of the standard to be used in cases\nalleging monopolization. Elucidation came in United States\nv. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563 (1966), where the Court\ndeclared that a defendant company which possesses\nmonopoly power in the relevant market will be found in\nviolation of § 2 of the Sherman Act if the defendant willfully\nacquired or maintained that power. Id. at 570-71.\n  In this case, the parties agreed that the relevant product\nmarket is transparent tape and the relevant geographic\nmarket is the United States.4 Moreover, as to the issue of\nmonopoly power, as we noted above, 3M concedes it\npossesses monopoly power in the United States transparent\ntape market, with a 90% market share. In fact, the evidence\nshowed that the household penetration of 3M’s Scotch-\n\n4. Although 3M originally challenged LePage’s selection of the United\nStates as the relevant geographic market, the District Court held that\nLePage’s had introduced sufficient evidence from which the jury could\nproperly find that the relevant geographic market is the United States\nand 3M does not challenge that market definition on appeal.\n\f                                8\n\n\nbrand tape is virtually 100%. Therefore we need not dwell\non the oft-contested issue of market power. See Robert\nPitofsky, New Definitions of Relevant Market and the\nAssault on Antitrust, 90 Colum. L. Rev. 1805, 1807 (1990)\n(“In monopoly enforcement under section 2 of the Sherman\nAct, the pivotal inquiry is almost always whether the\nchallenged party has substantial market power in its\nrelevant market.”).\n  The sole remaining issue and our focus on this appeal is\nwhether 3M took steps to maintain that power in a manner\nthat violated § 2 of the Sherman Act. A monopolist willfully\nacquires or maintains monopoly power when it competes on\nsome basis other than the merits. See Aspen Skiing Co. v.\nAspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 605 n.32\n(1985).\n   LePage’s argues that 3M willfully maintained its\nmonopoly in the transparent tape market through\nexclusionary conduct, primarily by bundling its rebates and\nentering into contracts that expressly or effectively required\ndealing virtually exclusively with 3M, which LePage’s\ncharacterizes as de facto exclusive. 3M does not argue that\nit did not engage in this conduct. It agrees that it offered\nbundled rebates and entered into some exclusive dealing\ncontracts, although it argues that only the few contracts\nthat are expressly exclusive may be considered as such.\nInstead, 3M argues that its conduct was legal as a matter\nof law because it never priced its transparent tape below its\ncost.5\n   This is the most significant legal issue in this case\nbecause it underlies 3M’s argument. In its brief, 3M states\n“[a]bove-cost pricing cannot give rise to an antitrust offense\nas a matter of law, since it is the very conduct that the\nantitrust laws wish to promote in the interest of making\nconsumers better off.” Appellant’s Br. at 30. For this\nproposition it relies on the Supreme Court’s decision in\nBrooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,\n509 U.S. 209, 222 (1993). It is an argument 3M repeated\nfrequently during its oral argument before the en banc\n\n5. 3M states that its pricing was above its costs however costs are\ncalculated, and LePage’s has not contested 3M’s assertion.\n\f                                  9\n\n\ncourt. Counsel stated, “if the big guy is selling above cost,\nit has done nothing which offends the Sherman Act . . . .”\nTr. of Oral Argument, Oct. 30, 2002, at 11. This was the\ntheory upon which 3M’s counsel responded to all the\nquestions from the court. When asked whether its theory is\nthat because no one contended that 3M sold below its cost,\nthat is “the end of the story,” its counsel responded, “[w]ith\nthe exception of the inconsequential express contract,\nabsolutely.” Id.\n  It is therefore necessary for us, at the outset, to examine\nwhether we must accept 3M’s legal theory that after Brooke\nGroup, no conduct by a monopolist who sells its product\nabove cost — no matter how exclusionary the conduct —\ncan constitute monopolization in violation of § 2 of the\nSherman Act. The history of the interpretation of § 2 of the\nSherman Act demonstrates the lack of foundation for 3M’s\npremise.\n  Although § 2 of the Sherman Act may have received less\njudicial and scholarly attention than several of the other\nmore frequently invoked antitrust provisions, the Supreme\nCourt, in a series of decisions, has made clear the type of\nconduct that will be held to constitute monopolization in\nviolation of § 2.\n  The modern era begins with the decision by Judge\nLearned Hand in United States v. Aluminum Co. of America,\n148 F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945) (“Alcoa”). Because four\nmembers of the Supreme Court were disqualified, the\nSupreme Court was required to apply the provision of the\nExpediting Act, Section 29 of Title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed.,\ncurrently 28 U.S.C. § 2109, to certify the case to the three\nmost senior judges of the relevant circuit.6 Under the\nstatute, the decision of that court was “final and\nconclusive,” thus equating it to a decision of the Supreme\nCourt.\n  At the time in question, Alcoa was the sole domestic\nproducer of aluminum and thus had a monopoly that the\n\n6. The three most senior judges of the circuit were, fortuitously, the\nlegendary panel of Judges Learned Hand, Thomas Swan, and Augustus\nHand.\n\f                             10\n\n\nGovernment sought to disband. In the opinion on liability,\nthe court enunciated certain principles that remain fully\napplicable today. One such principle is that it does not\nfollow that a company that has a monopoly has\n“monopolized” the market because “it may not have\nachieved monopoly; monopoly may have been thrust upon\nit.” Id. at 429. As the court explained, “persons may\nunwittingly find themselves in possession of a monopoly,\nautomatically so to say: that is, without having intended\neither to put an end to existing competition, or to prevent\ncompetition from arising when none had existed; they may\nbecome monopolists by force of accident.” Id. at 429-30. On\nthe other hand, the court then quoted Justice Cardozo’s\nstatement in United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106,\n116 (1932), that “size carries with it an opportunity for\nabuse that is not to be ignored when the opportunity is\nproved to have been utilized in the past.” Alcoa, 148 F.2d\nat 430.\n   The court determined that Alcoa, which controlled over\n90% of the aluminum market, had utilized its size for\nabuse. The court, noting that there had been at least “one\nor two abortive attempts” by others to enter the industry,\nconcluded that Alcoa “effectively anticipated and forestalled\nall competition, and succeeded in holding the field alone.”\nId. at 430. Finding Alcoa in violation of § 2, the court\ncontinued:\n    Nothing compelled it to keep doubling and redoubling\n    its capacity before others entered the field. It insists\n    that it never excluded competitors; but we can think of\n    no more effective exclusion than progressively to\n    embrace each new opportunity as it opened, and to\n    face every newcomer with new capacity already geared\n    into a great organization, having the advantage of\n    experience, trade connections and the elite of\n    personnel.\nId. at 431.\n  One year later, in American Tobacco Co. v. United States,\n328 U.S. 781 (1946), the Supreme Court endorsed the\nAlcoa decision when upholding a jury verdict finding a § 2\nviolation. The government brought a criminal action against\n\f                              11\n\n\nvarious tobacco companies that between 1931 and 1939\naccounted at all times for more than 68%, and usually for\nmore than 75%, of the nation’s domestic cigarette\nproduction. Defendants were convicted and fined after the\njury found they had violated §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act\nby conspiring to control the price of leaf tobacco, to acquire\nless expensive supplies of tobacco they did not need in\norder to deprive rival manufacturers of cheaper brands, to\ncontrol cigarette prices, and to force cigarette distributors\nto treat rival brands less favorably.\n   The court of appeals affirmed, finding the verdicts to be\nsupported by sufficient evidence. The Supreme Court\ngranted the tobacco companies’ petitions for certiorari only\nas to their § 2 claims, seeking to answer the specific\nquestion “whether actual exclusion of competitors is\nnecessary to the crime of monopolization under § 2 of the\nSherman Act.” Id. at 784. Answering that question in the\nnegative, the Court stated that “[n]either proof of exertion of\nthe power to exclude nor proof of actual exclusion of\nexisting or potential competitors is essential to sustain a\ncharge of monopolization under the Sherman Act.” Id. at\n810. Furthermore, and importantly, the Court explicitly\n“welcome[d] this opportunity to endorse” certain passages\nfrom Judge Hand’s opinion. Id. at 813.\n    Of particular relevance, the American Tobacco Court\nendorsed Judge Hand’s understanding of the Sherman Act,\nnamely that the Act contemplated the notion that\n“ ‘unchallenged economic power deadens initiative’ ” and\n“ ‘that immunity from competition is a narcotic, and rivalry\nis a stimulant, to industrial progress.’ ” Id. (quoting Alcoa,\n148 F.2d at 427). It further quoted Alcoa for the previously\nmentioned propositions that monopolies can be “thrust”\nupon entities rather than achieved and that specific intent\nunder § 2 was not required “ ‘for no monopolist monopolizes\nunconscious of what he is doing.’ ” Id. at 813-14 (quoting\nAlcoa, 148 F.2d at 432).\n  Section 2 of the Sherman Act was next considered by the\nSupreme Court in Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342\nU.S. 143 (1951). The United States had brought a civil suit\nagainst the publisher of the Lorain Journal, the only\nbusiness disseminating news and advertising in the town of\n\f                             12\n\n\nLorain, Ohio, alleging that it attempted to monopolize in\nviolation of § 2 of the Sherman Act because it refused to sell\nadvertising to persons that patronized the small radio\nstation that was established in a nearby community. The\nSupreme Court held that although a trader has discretion\nas to the parties with whom he will deal “[i]n the absence\nof any purpose to create or maintain a monopoly,” id. at\n155 (quoting United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300,\n307 (1919)), the action of the Journal constituted a\npurposeful means of regaining its previous monopoly over\nthe mass dissemination of news and advertising. Id.\nBecause this was an attempt to monopolize in violation of\n§ 2, the Court approved the entry of an injunction ordering\nthe Journal to print the advertisements of the customers of\nthe radio station.\n  Thereafter, in United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S.\n563 (1966), the Supreme Court reiterated that monopoly\npower alone is not necessarily unlawful. The Court\nsummarized its prior cases, stating that § 2 of the Sherman\nAct required two elements: “(1) the possession of monopoly\npower in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition\nor maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth\nor development as a consequence of a superior product,\nbusiness acumen, or historic accident.” 384 U.S. at 570-71.\n   In Grinnell, the United States filed a civil suit against\nseveral companies that offered central station protective\nservices, such as fire and burglary protective devices,\nalleging violations of §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.\nReferring to the two-pronged test under § 2, the Court\nfound that both prongs had been satisfied. Not only did the\ncompanies have monopoly power (87% of the accredited\ncentral station service business), but also they largely\nachieved this power through the aid of pricing practices,\nacquisitions of competitors, and noncompetition covenants,\nall of which were deemed to be “unlawful and exclusionary\npractices.” Id. at 576.\n  The Court’s later decision in Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen\nHighlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585 (1985), is even more\npertinent to the case before us. In Aspen Skiing, a case that\nalso reached the Court only on the § 2 violation, Ski Co.,\nthe owner of three of the four major downhill skiing\n\f                              13\n\n\nfacilities in Aspen, Colorado, discontinued its prior practice\nof cooperating with the owner of the fourth facility by\nissuing an interchangeable 6-day pass that could be used\non any of the four facilities. It replaced that pass with a 3-\narea, 6-day ticket featuring only its mountains. It offered\nthe plaintiff, Highlands, owner of the fourth facility,\nreinstatement of the 4-area ticket only if Highlands would\naccept a fixed percentage of the revenue that was\nconsiderably below Highlands’ historical average based on\nusage. Ski Co. took additional actions that made it\nextremely difficult for Highlands to market its own\nmultiarea package to replace the joint offering, and\nHighlands’ share of the market declined along with its\nrevenues from associated skiing services. The jury found\nthat Ski Co. possessed monopoly power and awarded\nHighlands a substantial money judgment as treble\ndamages. The court of appeals affirmed, holding there was\nsufficient basis in Ski Co.’s actions to demonstrate an\nabuse of its monopoly power.\n   In the Supreme Court, Ski Co. argued “that even a firm\nwith monopoly power has no duty to engage in joint\nmarketing with a competitor, that a violation of § 2 cannot\nbe established without evidence of substantial exclusionary\nconduct, and that none of its activities can be characterized\nas exclusionary.” Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. at 600. The\nSupreme Court agreed with the legal proposition, but\nreferred to its earlier opinion in Lorain Journal where it held\nthat a monopolist’s right to refuse to deal was not\nunqualified. Id. at 600-01. After reviewing all the\ncircumstances, it affirmed the judgment for Highlands in a\nunanimous opinion. It held that the jury had ample basis\nto reject Ski Co.’s business justification defense and noted\nthat Ski Co. failed to offer any efficiency justification\nwhatever for its pattern of conduct. Id. at 608. The Court\nstated, “[a]lthough Ski Co.’s pattern of conduct may not\nhave been as ‘bold, relentless, and predatory’ as the\npublisher’s actions in Lorain Journal, the record in this case\ncomfortably supports an inference that the monopolist\nmade a deliberate effort to discourage its customers from\ndoing business with its smaller rival.” Id. at 610 (quoting\nLorain Journal, 342 U.S. at 149 (citation omitted)).\n\f                             14\n\n\n   In a significant passage about the conduct that\nconstitutes monopolization in violation of § 2, the Court\nstated that when the issue is monopolization rather than\nan attempt to monopolize, “evidence of intent is merely\nrelevant to the question whether the challenged conduct is\nfairly characterized as ‘exclusionary’ or ‘anticompetitive’ —\nto use the words in the trial court’s instructions — or\n‘predatory,’ to use a word that scholars seem to favor.” Id.\nat 602. The Court continued, “[w]hichever label is used,\nthere is agreement on the proposition that ‘no monopolist\nmonopolizes unconscious of what he is doing.’ ” Id. (quoting\nAlcoa, 148 F.2d at 432).\n   In Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc., 504\nU.S. 451(1992), 18 independent service organizations\n(“ISO’s”) that serviced Kodak copying and micrographic\nequipment brought an antitrust action against Kodak for its\npolicies that sought to limit the availability of Kodak parts\nto ISO’s. They alleged Kodak’s policies were unlawful under\nboth §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The Supreme Court\nconsidered the issues under the two provisions separately.\nIn its analysis under § 2, the Court first held that Kodak’s\ncontrol of nearly 100% of the parts market and 80% to 95%\nof the service market was sufficient to support a claim of\nmonopoly power (an issue that is conceded here). As to the\nissue whether Kodak adopted its parts and service policies\nas part of a scheme of willful acquisition or maintenance of\nmonopoly power, the Court stated that there was evidence\nthat Kodak “took exclusionary action to maintain its parts\nmonopoly and used its control over parts to strengthen its\nmonopoly share of the Kodak service market.” Id. at 483.\nThus, Kodak could escape liability under § 2 only if it could\nexplain its actions on the basis of valid business reasons,\nan issue as to which there were factual questions which\nmade the district court’s grant of summary judgment for\nKodak inappropriate. Id.\n  This extensive review of the Supreme Court’s § 2\ndecisions is set forth to provide the background under\nwhich we must evaluate 3M’s contention that it was\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law on the basis of the\ndecision in Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson\nTobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209 (1993), a decision that was\n\f                                    15\n\n\nprimarily concerned with the Robinson-Patman Act, not § 2\nof the Sherman Act. In Brooke Group, Liggett, a cigarette\nmanufacturer responsible for the “innovative development”\nof generic cigarettes, claimed that Brown & Williamson,\nwhich introduced its own line of generic cigarettes, “cut\nprices on generic cigarettes below cost and offered\ndiscriminatory volume rebates to wholesalers to force\nLiggett to raise its own generic cigarette prices and\nintroduce oligopoly pricing in the economy segment [of the\nnational cigarette market].” Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 212.\nIt filed a Robinson-Patman action on the basis of these\nallegations. Brown & Williamson’s deep price discounts or\nrebates were concededly discriminatory, not cost justified,\nand resulted in substantial loss to it. The Supreme Court\nmajority held that the defendant was entitled to judgment\nas a matter of law because there was no evidence of injury\nto competition. Id. at 243. The Court also held that the\nevidence did not show that Brown & Williamson’s alleged\nscheme “was likely to result in oligopolistic price\ncoordination and sustained supracompetitive pricing in the\ngeneric segment of the national cigarette market. Without\nthis, Brown & Williamson had no reasonable prospect of\nrecouping its predatory losses and could not inflict the\ninjury to competition the antitrust laws prohibit.” Id.7\n   Unlike 3M, Brown & Williamson was part of an oligopoly,\nsix manufacturers whose prices for cigarettes “increased in\nlockstep” and who “reaped the benefits of prices above a\ncompetitive level.” Id. at 213. Brown & Williamson had 12%\nof the oligopolistic market. Its conduct and pricing were at\nall times necessarily constrained by the presence of\ncompetitors who could, and did, react to its conduct by\nundertaking similar price cuts or pricing behavior.8\n\n7. In contrast, the District Court here noted that 3M had conceded that\nit “ ‘could later recoup the profits it has forsaken on Scotch tape and\nprivate label tape by selling more higher priced Scotch tape . . . if there\nwould be no competition by others in the private label tape segment\nwhen 3M abandoned that part of the market to sell only higher-priced\nScotch tape.’ ” Le Page’s, 2000 WL 280350, at *7 (quoting Defendant’s\nMem. at 30).\n8. The Brooke Group opinions, both for the majority and the dissent,\ndiscuss the responses by members of the oligopoly to the introduction of\ndiscounted cigarettes. Id. at 239-40; id. at 247-48 (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting).\n\f                                  16\n\n\n  Assuming arguendo that Brooke Group should be read for\nthe proposition that a company’s pricing action is legal if its\nprices are not below its costs, nothing in the decision\nsuggests that its discussion of the issue is applicable to a\nmonopolist with its unconstrained market power. Moreover,\nLePage’s, unlike the plaintiff in Brooke Group, does not\nmake a predatory pricing claim. 3M is a monopolist; a\nmonopolist is not free to take certain actions that a\ncompany in a competitive (or even oligopolistic) market may\ntake, because there is no market constraint on a\nmonopolist’s behavior. See, e.g., Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. at\n601-04.\n   Nothing in any of the Supreme Court’s opinions in the\ndecade since the Brooke Group decision suggested that the\nopinion overturned decades of Supreme Court precedent\nthat evaluated a monopolist’s liability under § 2 by\nexamining its exclusionary, i.e., predatory, conduct. Brooke\nGroup has been cited only four times by the Supreme\nCourt, three times in cases that were not even antitrust\ncases for propositions patently inapplicable here.9 In the\nonly antitrust case of the four, NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, Inc.,\n525 U.S. 128, 137 (1998), the Court considered whether\nthe per se rule applicable to group boycotts under § 1 of the\nSherman Act should be applied “where a single buyer\nfavors one seller over another, albeit for an improper\nreason.” Id. at 133. Holding that the rule of reason applies,\nthe Court quoted Brooke Group for the proposition that\n“[e]ven an act of pure malice by one business competitor\nagainst another does not, without more, state a claim\nunder the federal anti-trust laws.” Id. at 137 (quoting\nBrooke Group, 509 U.S. at 225). The opinion does not\ndiscuss, much less adopt, the proposition that a monopolist\ndoes not violate § 2 unless it sells below cost. Thus, nothing\n\n9. Brooke Group is cited in Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 570\n(1995), for the statutory construction rule that identical words used in\ndifferent parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning;\nin Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 300 n.3 (1999), a federal habeas\ncase, by Justice Souter in his partial concurrence/partial dissent, in\ndiscussing the term “reasonable probability;” and in Weisgram v. Marley\nCo., 528 U.S. 440, 454 (2000), in connection with discussing the weight\nto be given an expert opinion.\n\f                              17\n\n\nthat the Supreme Court has written since Brooke Group\ndilutes the Court’s consistent holdings that a monopolist\nwill be found to violate § 2 of the Sherman Act if it engages\nin exclusionary or predatory conduct without a valid\nbusiness justification.\n\n                             IV.\n\n    MONOPOLIZATION — EXCLUSIONARY CONDUCT\n\n                              A.\n\n                     Illustrative Cases\n  Before turning to consider LePage’s allegation that 3M\nengaged in exclusionary or anticompetitive conduct and the\nevidence it produced, we consider the type of conduct § 2\nencompasses.\n  As one court of appeals has stated: “ ‘Anticompetitive\nconduct’ can come in too many different forms, and is too\ndependent upon context, for any court or commentator ever\nto have enumerated all the varieties.” Caribbean Broad.\nSys., Ltd. v. Cable & Wireless PLC, 148 F.3d 1080, 1087\n(D.C. Cir. 1998) (reversing in part the district court’s\ndismissal of complaint and holding that radio station’s\nclaim that defendants made misrepresentations to\nadvertisers and the government in order to protect its\nmonopoly stated § 2 Sherman Act claim).\n  Numerous cases hold that the enforcement of the legal\nmonopoly provided by a patent procured through fraud may\nviolate § 2. Walker Process Equip., Inc. v. Food Mach. &\nChem. Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 174 (1965); see also Medtronic\nAVE, Inc. v. Boston Scientific Corp., No. CIV. A. 98-478-SLR,\n2001 WL 652016 (D. Del. Mar. 30, 2001) (patentee could\nhave violated § 2 by bringing infringement action on patent\nprocured by fraud). Predatory pricing by a monopolist can\nprovide a basis for § 2 liability. See U.S. Philips Corp. v.\nWindmere Corp., 861 F.2d 695 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (reversing\ndistrict court’s directed verdict and ordering new trial on § 2\nclaims due to evidence that company had 90% of rotary\n\f                              18\n\n\nelectric shaver market, existence of substantial entry\nbarriers, and company had drastically reduced prices to\neliminate potential competitors). A monopolist’s denial to\ncompetitors of access to its “essential” goods, services or\nresources has been held to violate § 2. See Otter Tail Power\nCo. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366 (1973) (finding § 2\nviolation where monopolist utility company refused to sell\nwholesale to municipalities and refused to transfer\ncompetitors’ power over its lines); see also Fishman v.\nEstate of Wirtz, 807 F.2d 520 (7th Cir. 1986) (finding\ncorporation liable under § 2 for refusing to lease Chicago\nStadium to plaintiff, a potential buyer of the Chicago Bulls\nbasketball team, after determining Stadium to be essential\nto professional basketball in Chicago area). An arbitrary\nrefusal to deal by a monopolist may constitute a § 2\nviolation. See Byars v. Bluff City News Co., Inc., 609 F.2d\n843 (6th Cir. 1979) (remanding case to district court for\nfact-finding to determine whether defendant possessed\nmonopoly power and unlawfully refused to deal in violation\nof § 2). Even unfair tortious conduct unrelated to a\nmonopolist’s pricing policies has been held to violate § 2.\nSee Int’l Travel Arrangers, Inc. v. Western Airlines, Inc., 623\nF.2d 1255 (8th Cir. 1980) (upholding treble damages\nantitrust award against airline with monopoly power after\nfinding sufficient evidence that airline placed false,\ndeceptive, and misleading advertisements discouraging\npublic patronage of travel group charters).\n   A recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Sixth Circuit, Conwood Co., L.P. v. U.S. Tobacco Co.,\n290 F.3d 768 (6th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 123 S. Ct. 876,\n154 L.Ed. 2d 850 (2003), presents a good illustration of the\ntype of exclusionary conduct that will support a § 2\nviolation. That court upheld the jury’s award to plaintiff\nConwood of $350 million, which trebled was $1.05 billion,\nagainst United States Tobacco Company (“USTC”) because\nof USTC’s monopolization. USTC was the sole manufacturer\nof moist snuff until the 1970’s when Conwood, Swisher,\nand Swedish Match, other moist snuff manufacturers,\nentered the moist snuff market. Not unexpectedly, USTC’s\n100% market share declined and it took the action that\nformed the basis of Conwood’s complaint against USTC\n\f                             19\n\n\nalleging, inter alia, unlawful monopolization in violation of\n§ 2 of the Sherman Act.\n  The evidence that the district court and the court of\nappeals held proved that USTC systematically tried to\nexclude competition from the moist snuff market included\nthe following: USTC (1) removed and destroyed or discarded\nracks that displayed moist snuff products in the stores\nwhile placing Conwood products in USTC racks in an\nattempt to bury Conwood’s products; (2) trained its\n“operatives to take advantage of inattentive store clerks\nwith various ‘ruses’ such as obtaining nominal permission\nto reorganize or neaten the moist snuff section” in an effort\nto destroy Conwood racks; (3) misused its position as\ncategory manager (manages product groups and business\nunits and customizes them on a store by store basis) by\nproviding misleading information to retailers in an effort to\ndupe them into carrying USTC products and to discontinue\ncarrying Conwood products; and (4) entered into exclusive\nagreements with retailers in an effort to exclude rivals’\nproducts. Id. at 783.\n   On appeal, USTC — like 3M — did not challenge that it\nhad monopoly power and agreed that the relevant product\nwas moist snuff and the geographic market was nationwide.\nId. at 782-83. Instead, USTC contended that Conwood had\nfailed to establish that USTC’s power was acquired or\nmaintained by exclusionary practices rather than by its\nlegitimate business practices and superior product. Id. at\n783. Both the district court and the court of appeals\nrejected USTC’s argument, finding that there was sufficient\nevidence for a jury to find willful maintenance by USTC of\nmonopoly power by engaging in exclusionary practices in\nviolation of § 2 of the Sherman Act. Id. at 788.\n   Similarly, 3M sought to meet the competition that\nLePage’s threatened by exclusionary conduct that consisted\nof rebate programs and exclusive dealing arrangements\ndesigned to drive LePage’s and any other viable competitor\nfrom the transparent tape market.\n\f                             20\n\n\n                             B.\n\n                     Bundled Rebates\n  In considering LePage’s conduct that led to the jury’s\nultimate verdict, we note that the jury had before it\nevidence of the full panoply of 3M’s exclusionary conduct,\nincluding both the exclusive dealing arrangements and the\nbundled rebates which could reasonably have been viewed\nas effectuating exclusive dealing arrangements because of\nthe way in which they were structured.\n   Through a program denominated Executive Growth Fund\n(“EGF ”) and thereafter Partnership Growth Fund (“PGF ”),\n3M offered many of LePage’s major customers substantial\nrebates to induce them to eliminate or reduce their\npurchases of tape from LePage’s. Rather than competing by\noffering volume discounts which are concededly legal and\noften reflect cost savings, 3M’s rebate programs offered\ndiscounts to certain customers conditioned on purchases\nspanning six of 3M’s diverse product lines. The product\nlines covered by the rebate program were: Health Care\nProducts, Home Care Products, Home Improvement\nProducts, Stationery Products (including transparent tape),\nRetail Auto Products, and Leisure Time. Sealed App. at\n2979. In addition to bundling the rebates, both of 3M’s\nrebate programs set customer-specific target growth rates\nin each product line. The size of the rebate was linked to\nthe number of product lines in which targets were met, and\nthe number of targets met by the buyer determined the\nrebate it would receive on all of its purchases. If a customer\nfailed to meet the target for any one product, its failure\nwould cause it to lose the rebate across the line. This\ncreated a substantial incentive for each customer to meet\nthe targets across all product lines to maximize its rebates.\n  The rebates were considerable, not “modest” as 3M\nstates. Appellant’s Br. at 15. For example, Kmart, which\nhad constituted 10% of LePage’s business, received\n$926,287 in 1997, Sealed App. at 2980, and in 1996 Wal-\nMart received more than $1.5 million, Sam’s Club received\n$666,620, and Target received $482,001. Sealed App. at\n2773. Just as significant as the amounts received is the\n\f                              21\n\n\npowerful incentive they provided to customers to purchase\n3M tape rather than LePage’s in order not to forego the\nmaximum rebate 3M offered. The penalty would have been\n$264,000 for Sam’s Club, $450,000 for Kmart, and\n$200,000 to $310,000 for American Stores.\n  3M does not deny that it offered these programs although\nit gives different reasons for the discounts to each\ncustomer. Instead it argues that they were no more\nexclusive than procompetitive lawful discount programs.\nAnd, as it responds to each of LePage’s allegations, it\nreturns to its central premise “that it is not unlawful to\nlower one’s prices so long as they remain above cost.”\nAppellant’s Br. at 36 (citing Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 222).\n  However, one of the leading treatises discussing the\ninherent anticompetitive effect of bundled rebates, even if\nthey are priced above cost, notes that “the great majority of\nbundled rebate programs yield aggregate prices above cost.\nRather than analogizing them to predatory pricing, they are\nbest compared with tying, whose foreclosure effects are\nsimilar. Indeed, the ‘package discount’ is often a close\nanalogy.” Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust\nLaw ¶ 794, at 83 (Supp. 2002).\n   The treatise then discusses the anticompetitive effect as\nfollows:\n      The anticompetitive feature of package discounting is\n      the strong incentive it gives buyers to take increasing\n      amounts or even all of a product in order to take\n      advantage of a discount aggregated across multiple\n      products. In the anticompetitive case, which we\n      presume is in the minority, the defendant rewards the\n      customer for buying its product B rather than the\n      plaintiff ’s B, not because defendant’s B is better or\n      even cheaper. Rather, the customer buys the\n      defendant’s B in order to receive a greater discount on\n      A, which the plaintiff does not produce. In that case\n      the rival can compete in B only by giving the customer\n      a price that compensates it for the foregone A discount.\nId.\n  The authors then conclude:\n\f                              22\n\n\n    Depending on       the number of products that are\n    aggregated and     the customer’s relative purchases of\n    each, even an       equally efficient rival may find it\n    impossible to      compensate for lost discounts on\n    products that it   does not produce.\nId. at 83-84.\n   The principal anticompetitive effect of bundled rebates as\noffered by 3M is that when offered by a monopolist they\nmay foreclose portions of the market to a potential\ncompetitor who does not manufacture an equally diverse\ngroup of products and who therefore cannot make a\ncomparable offer. We recognized this in our decision in\nSmithKline Corp. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 575 F.2d 1056 (3d Cir.\n1978), where we held that conduct substantially identical to\n3M’s was anticompetitive and sustained the finding of a\nviolation of § 2. SmithKline is of interest not because the\npanel decision is binding on the en banc court but because\nthe reasoning regarding the practice of bundled rebates is\nequally applicable here. The defendant in SmithKline, Eli\nLilly & Company, the pharmaceutical manufacturer, sold\nthree of its cephalosporins to hospitals under the trade\nnames Kefzol, Keflin and Keflex. Cephalosporins are broad\nspectrum antibiotics that were at that time indispensable to\nhospital pharmacies. Lilly had a monopoly on both Keflin\nand Keflex because of its patents. However, those drugs\nfaced competition from the generic drug cefazolin which\nLilly sold under the trade name Kefzol and which plaintiff\nSmithKline sold under the trade name Ancef.\n   Lilly’s profits on the patented Keflin were far higher than\nthose it received from its sales of Kefzol where its pricing\nwas constrained by the existence of SmithKline. To preserve\nits market position in Keflin and discourage sales of Ancef\nand even of its own Kefzol, id. at 1061, Lilly instituted a\nrebate program that provided a 3% bonus rebate for\nhospitals that purchased specified quantities of any three of\nLilly’s five cephalosporins. SmithKline brought a § 2\nmonopolization claim, alleging that Lilly used these multi-\nline volume rebates to maintain its monopoly over the\nhospital market for cephalosporins.\n The district court (Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, later a\nmember of this court) found that Lilly’s pricing policy\n\f                              23\n\n\nviolated § 2. SmithKline Corp. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 427 F. Supp.\n1089 (E.D. Pa. 1976). We affirmed by a unanimous\ndecision. Although customers were not forced to select\nwhich cephalosporins they purchased from Lilly, we\nrecognized that the effect of the rebate program was to\ninduce hospitals to conjoin their purchases of Kefzol with\nKeflin and Keflex, Lilly’s “leading sellers.” SmithKline, 575\nF.2d at 1061. As we stated, “[a]lthough eligibility for the 3%\nbonus rebate was based on the purchase of specified\nquantities of any three of Lilly’s cephalosporins, in reality it\nmeant the combined purchases of Kefzol and the leading\nsellers, Keflin and Keflex.” Id. The gravamen of Lilly’s § 2\nviolation was that Lilly linked a product on which it faced\ncompetition with products on which it faced no\ncompetition. Id. at 1065.\n  The effect of the 3% bundled rebate was magnified by the\nvolume of Lilly products sold, so that “in order to offer a\nrebate of the same net dollar amount as Lilly’s, SmithKline\nhad to offer purchasers of Ancef rebates of some 16% to\nhospitals of average size, and 35% to larger volume\nhospitals.” Id. at 1062. Lilly’s rebate structure combining\nKefzol with Keflin and Keflex “insulat[ed] Kefzol from true\nprice competition with [its competitor] Ancef.” Id. at 1065.\n  LePage’s private-label and second-tier tapes are, as Kefzol\nand Ancef were in relation to Keflin, less expensive but\notherwise of similar quality to Scotch-brand tape. Indeed,\nbefore 3M instituted its rebate program, LePage’s had\nbegun to enjoy a small but rapidly expanding toehold in the\ntransparent tape market. 3M’s incentive was thus the same\nas Lilly’s in SmithKline: to preserve the market position of\nScotch-brand tape by discouraging widespread acceptance\nof the cheaper, but substantially similar, tape produced by\nLePage’s.\n   3M bundled its rebates for Scotch-brand tape with other\nproducts it sold in much the same way that Lilly bundled\nits rebates for Kefzol with Keflin and Keflex. In both cases,\nthe bundled rebates reflected an exploitation of the seller’s\nmonopoly power. Just as “[cephalosporins] [were] carried in\n. . . virtually every general hospital in the country,”\nSmithKline, 575 F.2d at 1062, the evidence in this case\n\f                             24\n\n\nshows that Scotch-brand tape is indispensable to any\nretailer in the transparent tape market.\n  Our analysis of § 2 of the Sherman Act in SmithKline is\ninstructive here where the facts are comparable. Speaking\nthrough Judge Aldisert, we said:\n      With Lilly’s cephalosporins subject to no serious\n    price competition from other sellers, with the barriers\n    to entering the market substantial, and with the\n    prospects of new competition extremely uncertain, we\n    are confronted with a factual complex in which Lilly\n    has the awesome power of a monopolist. Although it\n    enjoyed the status of a legal monopolist when it was\n    engaged in the manufacture and sale of its original\n    patented products, that status changed when it\n    instituted its [bundled rebate program]. The goal of\n    that plan was to associate Lilly’s legal monopolistic\n    practices with an illegal activity that directly affected\n    the price, supply, and demand of Kefzol and Ancef.\n    Were it not for the [bundled rebate program], the price,\n    supply, and demand of Kefzol and Ancef would have\n    been determined by the economic laws of a competitive\n    market. [Lilly’s bundled rebate program] blatantly\n    revised those economic laws and made Lilly a\n    transgressor under § 2 of the Sherman Act.\nId. at 1065.\n  The effect of 3M’s rebates were even more powerfully\nmagnified than those in SmithKline because 3M’s rebates\nrequired purchases bridging 3M’s extensive product lines.\nIn some cases, these magnified rebates to a particular\ncustomer were as much as half of LePage’s entire prior tape\nsales to that customer. For example, LePage’s sales to\nSam’s Club in 1993 totaled $1,078,484, while 3M’s 1996\nrebate to Sam’s Club was $666,620. Similarly, LePage’s\n1992 sales to Kmart were $2,482,756; 3M’s 1997 rebate to\nKmart was $926,287. The jury could reasonably find that\n3M used its monopoly in transparent tape, backed by its\nconsiderable catalog of products, to squeeze out LePage’s.\n3M’s conduct was at least as anticompetitive as the\nconduct which this court held violated § 2 in SmithKline.\n\f                                   25\n\n\n                                   C.\n\n                         Exclusive Dealing\n  The second prong of LePage’s claim of exclusionary\nconduct by 3M was its actions in entering into exclusive\ndealing contracts with large customers. 3M acknowledges\nonly the expressly exclusive dealing contracts with Venture\nand Pamida which conditioned discounts on exclusivity. It\nminimizes these because they represent only a small\nportion of the market. However, LePage’s claims that 3M\nmade payments to many of the larger customers that were\ndesigned to achieve sole-source supplier status.\n  3M argues that because the jury found for it on LePage’s\nclaims under § 1 of the Sherman Act and § 3 of the Clayton\nAct, these payments should not be relevant to the § 2\nanalysis. The law is to the contrary.10 Even though\nexclusivity arrangements are often analyzed under § 1, such\nexclusionary conduct may also be an element in a § 2\nclaim. U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v. Healthsource, Inc., 986 F.2d\n589, 593 (1st Cir. 1993) (observing that exclusivity may\nalso “play a role . . . as an element in attempted or actual\nmonopolization”).\n  3M also disclaims as exclusive dealing any arrangement\nthat contained no express exclusivity requirement. Once\nagain the law is to the contrary. No less an authority than\nthe United States Supreme Court has so stated. In Tampa\nElec. Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 327 (1961), a\ncase that dealt with § 3 of the Clayton Act rather than § 2\nof the Sherman Act, the Court took cognizance of\n\n10. The jury’s finding against LePage’s on its exclusive dealing claim\nunder § 1 of the Sherman Act and § 3 of the Clayton Act does not\npreclude the application of evidence of 3M’s exclusive dealing to support\nLePage’s § 2 claim. See, e.g., Barr Labs., Inc. v. Abbott Labs., 978 F.2d\n98, 110-12 (3d Cir. 1992) (considering § 2 of the Sherman Act claims\nafter rejecting claims based on the same evidence under § 1 of the\nSherman Act and § 3 of the Clayton Act); SmithKline, 427 F. Supp. at\n1092, aff ’d, 575 F.2d 1056 (imposing § 2 Sherman Act liability for\nexclusionary conduct, after rejecting an exclusive dealing claim under § 3\nof the Clayton Act).\n\f                                     26\n\n\narrangements which, albeit not expressly exclusive,\neffectively foreclosed the business of competitors.11\n   LePage’s introduced powerful evidence that could have\nled the jury to believe that rebates and discounts to Kmart,\nStaples, Sam’s Club, National Office Buyers and “UDI” were\ndesigned to induce them to award business to 3M to the\nexclusion of LePage’s. Many of LePage’s former customers\nrefused even to meet with LePage’s sales representatives. A\nbuyer for Kmart, LePage’s largest customer which\naccounted for 10% of its business, told LePage’s: “I can’t\ntalk to you about tape products for the next three years”\nand “don’t bring me anything 3M makes.” App. at 302-03,\n964. Kmart switched to 3M following 3M’s offer of a $1\nmillion “growth” reward which the jury could have\nunderstood to require that 3M be its sole supplier.\nSimilarly, Staples was offered an extra 1% bonus rebate if\nit gave LePage’s business to 3M. 3M argues that LePage’s\ndid not try hard enough to retain Kmart, its customer for\n20 years, but there was evidence to the contrary.12 In any\n\n11. If the dissent’s citation to FTC v. Motion Picture Advertising Serv. Co.,\n344 U.S. 392 (1953), suggests that a one year exclusive dealing contract\nshould be considered as per se legal under § 2, that is not supported by\na reading of the decision. In that case, the FTC had appealed from a\ndecision of the Fifth Circuit holding that exclusive contracts are not\nunfair methods of competition. The Supreme Court reversed, supporting\nthe FTC’s decision that the exclusive contracts of the respondent (a\nproducer and distributor of advertising motion pictures), unreasonably\nrestrain competition and tend to monopoly. It was the respondent who\nargued that exclusive contracts of a duration in excess of a year are\nnecessary for the conduct of the business of the distributors. This\nargument was rejected by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court’s\ndecision did not suggest that exclusive dealing arrangements entered\ninto by a monopolist (which the respondent in that case was not),\ntogether with other exclusionary action, did not violate § 2 of the\nSherman Act.\n12. At trial, LePage’s presented the testimony of James Kowieski, its\nformer senior vice president of sales, who described LePage’s efforts\nfollowing Kmart’s rejection of its bid. LePage’s made a desperate second\nsales presentation attended by its president, App. at 957 (“I felt it was\nvery critical to our company’s success or failure, so I insured that Mr.\nLes Baggett, our president, attended the meeting with me.”), where\nLePage’s vainly offered additional price concessions, App. at 959 (“We\nwent through the cost savings, the benefits, and we came up with some,\nagain, price concessions, and some programs of a special buy once a\nyear, because, I mean, as far as we were concerned, we were on our last\nleg.”).\n\f                               27\n\n\nevent, the purpose and effect of 3M’s payments to the\nretailers were issues for the jury which, by its verdict,\nrejected 3M’s arguments.\n  The foreclosure of markets through exclusive dealing\ncontracts is of concern under the antitrust laws. As one of\nthe leading treatises states:\n    unilaterally imposed quantity discounts can foreclose\n    the opportunities of rivals when a dealer can obtain its\n    best discount only by dealing exclusively with the\n    dominant firm. For example, discounts might be\n    cumulated over lengthy periods of time, such as a\n    calendar year, when no obvious economies result.\n3A Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law\n¶ 768b2, at 148 (2d Ed. 2002); see also 11 Herbert\nHovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 1807a, at 115-16 (1998)\n(quantity discounts may foreclose a substantial portion of\nthe market). Discounts conditioned on exclusivity are\n“problematic” “when the defendant is a dominant firm in a\nposition to force manufacturers to make an all-or-nothing\nchoice.” Id. at 117 n.7 (citing LePage’s, 1997 WL 734005\n(E.D. Pa. 1997)).\n  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia relied\non the evidence of foreclosure of markets in reaching its\ndecision on liability in United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253\nF.3d 34, 69 (D.C. Cir. 2001). In that case, the court of\nappeals concluded that Microsoft, a monopolist in the\noperating system market, foreclosed rivals in the browser\nmarket from a “substantial percentage of the available\nopportunities for browser distribution” through the use of\nexclusive contracts with key distributors. Id. at 70-71.\nMicrosoft kept usage of its competitor’s browser below “the\ncritical level necessary for [its rival] to pose a real threat to\nMicrosoft’s monopoly.” Id. at 71. The Microsoft opinion does\nnot specify what percentage of the browser market\nMicrosoft locked up — merely that, in one of the two\nprimary distribution channels for browsers, Microsoft had\nexclusive arrangements with most of the top distributors.\nId. at 70-71. Significantly, the Microsoft court observed that\nMicrosoft’s exclusionary conduct violated § 2 “even though\nthe contracts foreclose less than the roughly 40% or 50%\n\f                             28\n\n\nshare usually required in order to establish a § 1 violation.”\nId. at 70.\n  One noted antitrust scholar has written:\n      We might thus interpret the Microsoft holding as\n    follows: Conduct that intentionally, significantly, and\n    without business justification excludes a potential\n    competitor from outlets (even though not in the\n    relevant market), where access to those outlets is a\n    necessary though not sufficient condition to waging a\n    challenge to a monopolist and fear of the challenge\n    prompts the conduct, is “anticompetitive.”\nEleanor M. Fox, What Is Harm to Competition? Exclusionary\nPractices and Anticompetitive Effect, 70 Antitrust L. J. 371,\n390 (2002).\n   LePage’s produced evidence that the foreclosure caused\nby exclusive dealing practices was magnified by 3M’s\ndiscount practices, as some of 3M’s rebates were “all-or-\nnothing” discounts, leading customers to maximize their\ndiscounts by dealing exclusively with the dominant market\nplayer, 3M, to avoid being severely penalized financially for\nfailing to meet their quota in a single product line. Only by\ndealing exclusively with 3M in as many product lines as\npossible could customers enjoy the substantial discounts.\nAccordingly, the jury could reasonably find that 3M’s\nexclusionary conduct violated § 2.\n\n                             V.\n\n               ANTICOMPETITIVE EFFECT\n  It has been LePage’s position in pursuing its § 2 claim\nthat 3M’s exclusionary “tactics foreclosed the competitive\nprocess by preventing rivals from competing to gain (or\nmaintain) a presence in the market.” Appellee’s Br. at 45-\n46. When a monopolist’s actions are designed to prevent\none or more new or potential competitors from gaining a\nfoothold in the market by exclusionary, i.e. predatory,\nconduct, its success in that goal is not only injurious to the\npotential competitor but also to competition in general. It\nhas been recognized, albeit in a somewhat different context,\n\f                                   29\n\n\nthat even the foreclosure of “one significant competitor”\nfrom the market may lead to higher prices and reduced\noutput. Roland Mach. Co. v. Dresser Indus., Inc., 749 F.2d\n380, 394 (7th Cir. 1984).\n  The Microsoft court treated exclusionary conduct by a\nmonopolist as more likely to be anticompetitive than\nordinary § 1 exclusionary conduct. The inquiry in Microsoft\nwas whether the monopolist’s conduct excluded a\ncompetitor (Netscape) from the essential facilities that\nwould permit it to achieve the efficiencies of scale necessary\nto threaten the monopoly. 253 F.3d at 70-71.13 In Microsoft,\nthe court of appeals determined that Microsoft had\nforeclosed enough distribution links to undermine the\nsurvival of Netscape as a viable competitor. Id. at 71.\n  Similarly, in this case, the jury could have reasonably\nfound that 3M’s exclusionary conduct cut LePage’s off from\nkey retail pipelines necessary to permit it to compete\nprofitably.14 It was only after LePage’s entry into the market\nthat 3M introduced the bundled rebates programs. If 3M\nwere successful in eliminating competition from LePage’s\nsecond-tier or private-label tape, 3M could exercise its\nmonopoly power unchallenged, as Tesa Tuck was no longer\nin the market.\n  The District Court, recognizing that “this case presents a\nunique bundled rebate program that the jury found had an\n\n13. In one of the two distribution channels available for browsers,\nMicrosoft had locked up almost all the high volume distributors.\nMicrosoft, 253 F.3d at 70-71. In the seminal Terminal Railroad case, an\nassociation of railroad operators locked up the cheapest route across the\nMississippi river, the sole railroad bridge crossing at St. Louis. United\nStates v. Terminal R.R. Ass’n, 224 U.S. 383 (1912). The Supreme Court\ndetermined that the defendant’s agreement to provide access to the\nbridge to other railroads on discriminatory terms violated § 1 of the\nSherman Act.\n14. In the transparent tape market, superstores like Kmart and Wal-Mart\nprovide a crucial facility to any manufacturer—they supply high volume\nsales with the concomitant substantially reduced distribution costs. By\nwielding its monopoly power in transparent tape and its vast array of\nproduct lines, 3M foreclosed LePage’s from that critical bridge to\nconsumers that superstores provide, namely, cheap, high volume supply\nlines.\n\f                             30\n\n\nanti-competitive effect,” Le Page’s, 2000 WL 280350, at *5,\ndenied 3M’s motion for judgment as a matter of law\n(“JMOL”), stating:\n    Plaintiff introduced evidence that Scotch is a monopoly\n    product, and that 3M’s bundled rebate programs\n    caused distributors to displace Le Page’s entirely, or in\n    some cases, drastically reduce purchases from Le\n    Page’s. Tr. Vol. 30 at 105-106; Vol. 27 at 30. Under\n    3M’s rebate programs, 3M set overall growth targets for\n    unrelated product lines. In the distributors’ view, 3M\n    set these targets in a manner which forced the\n    distributor to either drop any non-Scotch products, or\n    lose the maximum rebate. PX 24 at 3M 48136. Thus, in\n    order to qualify for the maximum rebate under the\n    EGF/PGF programs, the record shows that most\n    customers diverted private label business to 3M at\n    3M’s suggestion. Tr. Vol. 28 at 74-75; PX23, 28, 32,\n    34, 715. Similarly, under the newer Brand Mix rebate\n    program, 3M set higher rebates for tape sales which\n    produced a shift from private label tape to branded\n    tape. Tr. Vol. 31 at 79. PX 393 at 534906.\n      Furthermore,     Plaintiff introduced   evidence    of\n    customized rebate programs that similarly caused\n    distributors to forego purchasing from Le Page’s if they\n    wished to obtain rebates on 3M’s products. Specifically,\n    the trial record establishes that 3M offered Kmart a\n    customized growth rebate and Market Development\n    Funds payment. In order to reach the $15 million sales\n    target and qualify for the $1 million rebate, however,\n    Kmart had to increase its consumer stationary\n    purchases by $5.5 million. Kmart substantially\n    achieved this “growth” by dropping Le Page’s and\n    another private label manufacturer, Tesa. PX 51 at 3M\n    102175, PX 121 at 156838. Likewise, 3M customized a\n    program with Staples that provided for an extra 1%\n    bonus rebate on Scotch tape sales “if Le Page’s\n    business is given to 3M.” PX 98 at 3M 149794. Finally,\n    3M provided a similar discount on Scotch tape to\n    Venture Stores “based on the contingency of Venture\n    dropping private label.” PX 712 at 3M 450738. Thus,\n    the jury could have reasonably concluded that 3M’s\n\f                             31\n\n\n    customers were forced to forego purchasing Le Page’s\n    private label tape in order to obtain the rebates on\n    Scotch tape.\nId. (emphasis added).\n   In the same opinion, the District Court found that\n“[LePage’s] introduced substantial evidence that the anti-\ncompetitive effects of 3M’s rebate programs caused Le\nPage’s losses.” Id. at *7. The jury was capable of calculating\nfrom the evidence the amount of rebate a customer of 3M\nwould lose if it failed to meet 3M’s quota of sales in even\none of the bundled products. The discount that LePage’s\nwould have had to provide to match the discounts offered\nby 3M through its bundled rebates can be measured by the\ndiscounts 3M gave or offered. For example, LePage’s points\nout that in 1993 Sam’s Club would have stood to lose\n$264,900, Sealed App. at 1166, and Kmart $450,000 for\nfailure to meet one of 3M’s growth targets in a single\nproduct line. Sealed App. at 1110. Moreover, the effect of\n3M’s rebates on LePage’s earnings, if LePage’s had\nattempted to match 3M’s discounts, can be calculated by\ncomparing the discount that LePage’s would have been\nrequired to provide. That amount would represent the\nimpact of 3M’s bundled rebates on LePage’s ability to\ncompete, and that is what is relevant under § 2 of the\nSherman Act.\n   The impact of 3M’s discounts was apparent from the\nchart introduced by LePage’s showing that LePage’s\nearnings as a percentage of sales plummeted to below zero\n—to negative 10%—during 3M’s rebate program. App. at\n7037; see also App. at 7044 (documenting LePage’s healthy\noperating income from 1990 to 1993, rapidly declining\noperating income from 1993 to 1995, and large operating\nlosses suffered from 1996 through 1999). Demand for\nLePage’s tape, especially its private-label tape, decreased\nsignificantly following the introduction of 3M’s rebates.\n Although 3M claims that customers participating in its\nrebate programs continued to purchase tape from LePage’s,\nthe evidence does not support this contention. Many\ndistributors dropped LePage’s entirely.\n  Prior to the introduction of 3M’s rebate program, LePage’s\n\f                                   32\n\n\nsales had been skyrocketing. Its sales to Staples increased\nby 440% from 1990 to 1993. Following the introduction of\n3M’s rebate program which bundled its private-label tape\nwith its other products, 3M’s private-label tape sales\nincreased 478% from 1992 to 1997.15 LePage’s in turn lost\na proportional amount of sales. It lost key large volume\ncustomers, such as Kmart, Staples, American Drugstores,\nOffice Max, and Sam’s Club. Other large customers, like\nWal-Mart, drastically cut back their purchases.\n   As a result, LePage’s manufacturing process became less\nefficient and its profit margins declined. In transparent tape\nmanufacturing, large volume customers are essential to\nachieving efficiencies of scale. As 3M concedes, “ ‘large\ncustomers were extremely important to [LePage’s], to\neveryone.’ . . . Large volumes . . . permitted ‘long runs,’\nmaking the manufacturing process more economical and\npredictable.” Appellant Br. at 10 (quoting trial testimony of\nLes Baggett, LePage’s former president and CEO) (citation\nomitted).\n   There was a comparable effect on LePage’s share of the\ntransparent tape market. In the agreed upon relevant\nmarket for transparent tape in the United States, LePage’s\nmarket share dropped 35% from 1992 to 1997. In 1992,\nLePage’s net sales constituted 14.44% of the total\ntransparent tape market. By 1997, LePage’s sales had\nfallen to 9.35%. Sealed App. at 489. Finally, in March of\n1997, LePage’s was forced to close one of its two plants.\nThat same year, the only other domestic transparent tape\nmanufacturer, Tesa Tuck, Inc., bowed out of the\ntransparent tape business entirely in the United States.\nHad 3M continued with its program it could have\neventually forced LePage’s out of the market.\n  The relevant inquiry is the anticompetitive effect of 3M’s\nexclusionary practices considered together. As the Supreme\nCourt recognized in Cont’l Ore Co. v. Union Carbide &\nCarbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699 (1962), the courts must\nlook to the monopolist’s conduct taken as a whole rather\nthan considering each aspect in isolation. The Court stated,\n\n15. In 1992, 3M’s private-label tape sales were $1,142,000. By 1997, its\nprivate-label tape sales had increased to $5,464,222. Sealed App. at 489.\n\f                             33\n\n\n“ ‘in a case like the one before us [alleging § 1 and § 2\nviolations], the duty of the jury was to look at the whole\npicture and not merely at the individual figures in it.’ ” Id.\n(citation omitted). See also City of Anaheim v. S. Cal. Edison\nCo., 955 F.2d 1373, 1376 (9th Cir. 1992) (“[I]t would not be\nproper to focus on specific individual acts of an accused\nmonopolist while refusing to consider their overall combined\neffect. . . We are dealing with what has been called the\n‘synergistic effect’ of the mixture of the elements.”)\n(emphasis added). This court, when considering the\nanticompetitive effect of a defendant’s conduct under the\nSherman Act, has looked to the increase in the defendant’s\nmarket share, the effects of foreclosure on the market,\nbenefits to customers and the defendant, and the extent to\nwhich customers felt they were precluded from dealing with\nother manufacturers. Barr, 978 F.2d at 110-11.\n   The effect of 3M’s conduct in strengthening its monopoly\nposition by destroying competition by LePage’s in second-\ntier tape is most apparent when 3M’s various activities are\nconsidered as a whole. The anticompetitive effect of 3M’s\nexclusive dealing arrangements, whether explicit or\ninferred, cannot be separated from the effect of its bundled\nrebates. 3M’s bundling of its products via its rebate\nprograms reinforced the exclusionary effect of those\nprograms.\n  3M’s exclusionary conduct not only impeded LePage’s\nability to compete, but also it harmed competition itself, a\nsine qua non for a § 2 violation. LePage’s presented powerful\nevidence that competition itself was harmed by 3M’s\nactions. The District Court recognized this in its opinion,\nwhen it said:\n    The jury could reasonably infer that 3M’s planned\n    elimination of the lower priced private label tape, as\n    well as the lower priced Highland brand, would\n    channel consumer selection to the higher priced Scotch\n    brand and lead to higher profits for 3M. Indeed,\n    Defendant concedes that “3M could later recoup the\n    profits it has forsaken on Scotch tape and private label\n    tape by selling more higher priced Scotch tape . . . if\n    there would be no competition by others in the private\n\f                              34\n\n\n    label tape segment when 3M abandoned that part of\n    the market to sell only higher-priced Scotch tape.”\nLe Page’s, 2000 WL 280350, at *7.\n   3M could effectuate such a plan because there was no\nease of entry. See Advo, Inc. v. Phila. Newspapers, Inc., 51\nF.3d 1191, 1200 (3d Cir. 1995) (commenting that ease of\nentry would prevent monopolist’s predatory pricing scheme\nfrom succeeding); see also Edward A. Snyder & Thomas E.\nKauper, Misuses of the Antitrust Laws: The Competitor\nPlaintiff, 90 Mich. L. Rev. 551, 564 (1991) (finding “barriers\nto entry” to be one of two necessary conditions for\nexclusionary conduct, the other being “market power”).\n  The District Court found that there was “substantial\nevidence at trial that significant entry barriers prevent\ncompetitors from entering the . . . tape market in the\nUnited States. Thus, this case presents a situation in which\na monopolist remains unchecked in the market.” Le Page’s,\n2000 WL 280350, at *7. In the time period at issue here,\nthere has never been a competitor that has genuinely\nchallenged 3M’s monopoly and it never lost a significant\ntransparent tape account to a foreign competitor.\n  There was evidence from which the jury could have\ndetermined that 3M intended to force LePage’s from the\nmarket, and then cease or severely curtail its own private-\nlabel and second-tier tape lines. For example, by 1996, 3M\nhad begun to offer incentives to some customers to increase\npurchases of its higher priced Scotch-brand tapes over its\nown second-tier brand. The Supreme Court has made clear\nthat intent is relevant to proving monopolization, Aspen\nSkiing, 472 U.S. at 602, and attempt to monopolize, Lorain\nJournal, 342 U.S. at 154-55.\n  3M’s interest in raising prices is well-documented in the\nrecord. In internal memoranda introduced into evidence by\nLePage’s, 3M executives boasted that the large retailers like\nOffice Max and Staples had no choice but to adhere to 3M’s\ndemands. See Sealed App. at 2585 (“Either they take the\n[price] increase . . . or we hold orders . . . .”); see also\nSealed App. at 2571 (3M’s directive when Staples objected\nto price increase was “orders will be held if pricing is not up\nto date on 1/1/98”). LePage’s expert testified that the price\n\f                             35\n\n\nof Scotch-brand tape increased since 1994, after 3M\ninstituted its rebate program. App. at 3246-47. In its\nopinion, the District Court cited the deposition testimony of\na 3M employee acknowledging that the payment of the\nrebates after the end of the year discouraged passing the\nrebate on to the ultimate customers. App. at 2092. The\nDistrict Court thus observed, “the record amply reflects\nthat 3M’s rebate programs did not benefit the ultimate\nconsumer.” Le Page’s, 2000 WL 280350, at *7.\n  As the foregoing review of the evidence makes clear, there\nwas sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude the long-\nterm effects of 3M’s conduct were anticompetitive. We must\ntherefore uphold its verdict on liability unless 3M has\nshown adequate business justification for its practices.\n\n                             VI.\n\n          BUSINESS REASONS JUSTIFICATION\n  It remains to consider whether defendant’s actions were\ncarried out for “valid business reasons,” the only recognized\njustification for monopolizing. See, e.g., Eastman Kodak,\n504 U.S. at 483. However, a defendant’s assertion that it\nacted in furtherance of its economic interests does not\nconstitute the type of business justification that is an\nacceptable defense to § 2 monopolization. Paraphrasing one\ncorporate executive’s well publicized statement, whatever is\ngood for 3M is not necessarily permissible under § 2 of the\nSherman Act. As one court of appeals has explained:\n    In general, a business justification is valid if it relates\n    directly or indirectly to the enhancement of consumer\n    welfare. Thus, pursuit of efficiency and quality control\n    might be legitimate competitive reasons . . . , while the\n    desire to maintain a monopoly market share or thwart\n    the entry of competitors would not.\nData Gen. Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 36 F.3d\n1147, 1183 (1st Cir. 1994) (citing Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S.\nat 483; Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. at 608-11).\n  It can be assumed that a monopolist seeks to further its\neconomic interests and does so when it engages in\n\f                             36\n\n\nexclusionary conduct. Thus, for example, exclusionary\npractice has been defined as “a method by which a firm . . .\ntrades a part of its monopoly profits, at least temporarily,\nfor a larger market share, by making it unprofitable for\nother sellers to compete with it.” Richard A. Posner,\nAntitrust Law: An Economic Perspective 28 (1976). Once a\nmonopolist achieves its goal by excluding potential\ncompetitors, it can then increase the price of its product to\nthe point at which it will maximize its profit. This price is\ninvariably higher than the price determined in a competitive\nmarket. That is one of the principal reasons why\nmonopolization violates the antitrust laws. The fact that 3M\nacted to benefit its own economic interests is hardly a\nreason to overturn the jury’s finding that it violated § 2 of\nthe Sherman Act.\n   The defendant bears the burden of “persuad[ing] the jury\nthat its conduct was justified by any normal business\npurpose.” Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. at 608. Although 3M\nalludes to its customers’ desire to have single invoices and\nsingle shipments in defense of its bundled rebates, 3M cites\nto no testimony or evidence in the 55 volume appendix that\nwould support any actual economic efficiencies in having\nsingle invoices and/or single shipments. It is highly\nunlikely that 3M shipped transparent tape along with retail\nauto products or home improvement products to customers\nsuch as Staples or that, if it did, the savings stemming from\nthe joint shipment approaches the millions of dollars 3M\nreturned to customers in bundled rebates.\n  There is considerable evidence in the record that 3M\nentered the private-label market only to “kill it.” See, e.g.,\nSealed App. at 809 (statement by 3M executive in internal\nmemorandum that “I don’t want private label 3M products\nto be successful in the office supply business, its\ndistribution or our consumers/end users”). That is\nprecisely what § 2 of the Sherman Act prohibits by covering\nconduct that maintains a monopoly. Maintaining a\nmonopoly is not the type of valid business reason that will\nexcuse exclusionary conduct. 3M’s business justification\ndefense was presented to the jury, and it rejected the claim.\nThe jury’s verdict reflects its view that 3M’s exclusionary\nconduct, which made it difficult for LePage’s to compete on\nthe merits, had no legitimate business justification.\n\f                                   37\n\n\n                                  VII.\n\n                              DAMAGES\n  As an alternative to its argument that it is entitled to\nJMOL on liability, 3M claims that it is entitled to a new trial\ndue to the District Court’s error in sustaining LePage’s\ndamages award. It gives two reasons. First, it contends that\nthe damage theory proffered by Terry Musika, LePage’s\ndamages expert, was based on improper assumptions and\nshould have been excluded.16 Second, 3M argues that\nMusika’s theory failed to disaggregate the damages based\non lawful versus unlawful conduct by 3M.\n   We review the District Court’s decision to admit or\nexclude expert testimony for abuse of discretion. Kumho\nTire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 152 (1999).\nFurthermore, we review de novo LePage’s damages evidence\nto determine whether as a matter of law it can support the\njury’s verdict. Stelwagon Mfg. Co. v. Tarmac Roofing Sys.,\nInc., 63 F.3d 1267, 1271 (3d Cir. 1995).\n  To determine the amount of profits LePage’s lost between\n1993 and 2000 due to 3M’s antitrust violations, Musika\nconstructed a “lost market share” model. Appellant’s Br. at\n72. Musika first calculated the total United States\ntransparent tape sales during the damages period, using\nactual financial data from 1992 to 1997 and projecting total\nsales from 1998 to 2000. Next, he determined how those\nsales would be divided between branded and private-label\nparts of the market, projecting a 1% shift each year from\nbranded to private-label tape sales. In arriving at 1%,\nMusika considered the actual growth in private-label tape\nsales, the actual growth rate of all private-label products\n\n16. 3M does not challenge Musika’s expert qualifications. Nonetheless,\nwe note that he holds a master’s degree in public finance, is a former\npartner at a major accounting firm, and at the time of trial was President\nand CEO of a business consulting firm. Furthermore, Musika frequently\nhas served as a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee, as an expert for\nvarious government agencies, including the Department of Justice and\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, and as an expert witness in\ncomplex cases, including five antitrust cases.\n\f                             38\n\n\n(i.e. not just tape), the growth rate of large customers, and\n3M’s internal projections.\n   After determining the size of both segments of the\nmarket, Musika estimated LePage’s share of the market,\npredicting that LePage’s would have retained its 3.5% share\nof the branded-label segment and its 88% share of the\nprivate-label segment. He opined that LePage’s share of the\noverall market for transparent tape would have increased\nfrom 14.44% in 1992 to 21.2% in 2000 but for 3M’s\nunlawful conduct. Finally, Musika subtracted LePage’s\nactual sales from his projected sales to determine LePage’s\nlost sales due to 3M’s unlawful conduct. He calculated\nLePage’s projected profit margin by looking at LePage’s\nactual profit margin for each year and adjusting it to show\ndeclining prices and LePage’s consequential decreasing\nefficiency due to decreasing sales. Based on those\nadjustments, LePage’s profit margin decreased every year\nduring the damages period. Musika concluded that but for\n3M’s unlawful conduct, LePage’s would have earned an\nextra $36 million dollars.\n  Importantly, 3M does not challenge Musika’s basic\napproach to calculating damages, conceding that “an expert\nmay construct a reasonable offense-free world as a\nyardstick for measuring what, hypothetically, would have\nhappened ‘but for’ the defendant’s unlawful activities.”\nAppellant’s Reply Br. at 37(citing Callahan v. A.E.V., Inc.,\n182 F.3d 237, 254-58 (3d Cir. 1999); Rossi v. Standard\nRoofing, Inc., 156 F.3d 452, 484-87 (3d Cir. 1998)).\n  Instead, 3M’s motion for judgment as a matter of law\nattacked Musika’s underlying assumptions, the primary\nassumption being that 3M did not want to succeed in the\nprivate-label segment as it did not want to harm its high-\nmargin sales of Scotch brand. The District Court rejected\n3M’s objections to LePage’s damages claims, stating that\n“the record . . . demonstrates that Mr. Musika’s\nassumptions were grounded in the past performances of\nScotch, Highland and Le Page’s tapes, as well as 3M’s own\ninternal projections for future growth.” LePage’s, 2000 WL\n280350, at *8.\n  The credibility of LePage’s and 3M’s experts was for the\njury to determine. Inter Med. Supplies, Ltd. v. EBI Med.\n\f                              39\n\n\nSys., Inc., 181 F.3d 446, 462-63 (3d Cir. 1999). Musika was\nextensively cross-examined and 3M presented testimony\nfrom its own damages expert who predicted more\nconservative losses to LePage’s. In the end, the jury found\nMusika to be credible. 3M’s disappointment as to the jury’s\nfinding of credibility does not constitute an abuse of\ndiscretion by the District Court in allowing Musika’s\ntestimony.\n  3M next argues that Musika improperly failed to\ndisaggregate damages, thereby providing the jury with no\nmechanism to discern damages arising from 3M’s lawful\nconduct or other facts from damages arising from 3M’s\nunlawful conduct. According to 3M, this resulted in\nimpermissible guesswork and speculation on the part of the\njury.\n  In Bonjorno v. Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp., 752 F.2d\n802, 812 (3d Cir. 1984), this court stated that “[i]n\nconstructing a hypothetical world free of the defendants’\nexclusionary activities, the plaintiffs are given some latitude\nin calculating damages, so long as their theory is not wholly\nspeculative.” Id. Once a jury has found that the unlawful\nactivity caused the antitrust injury, the damages may be\ndetermined without strict proof of what act caused the\ninjury, as long as the damages are not based on\nspeculation or guesswork. Id. at 813. The Bonjorno court\nnoted that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible,\nto segregate and attribute a fixed amount of damages to\nany one act as the theory was not that any one act in itself\nwas unlawful, but that all the acts taken together showed\na § 2 violation. Id.\n   Similarly, 3M’s actions, taken as a whole, were found to\nviolate § 2, thus making the disaggregation that 3M speaks\nof to be unnecessary, if not impossible. In any event, we fail\nto see how the jury engaged in speculation or guesswork.\nThe District Court clearly charged the jury to disregard\nlosses not caused by 3M: “You may not calculate damages\nbased only on speculation or guessing . . . . You may not\naward damages for injuries or losses caused by other\nfactors.” App. at 5689. We find no evidence that the jury\nfailed reasonably to follow these instructions.\n\f                             40\n\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, we will not disturb the jury’s\ndamages award to LePage’s.\n\n                            VIII.\n\n                   JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n   3M also argues that it should be awarded a new trial\nbecause of allegedly improper jury instructions. In the\nabsence of a misstatement of law, jury instructions are\nreviewed for abuse of discretion. Bhaya v. Westinghouse\nElectric Corp., 922 F.2d 184, 191 (3d Cir. 1990). Because\nthe District Court provided the jury with meticulous\ninstructions, methodically explaining this area of the law in\na manner understandable to lay persons, we conclude that\nit did not abuse its discretion.\n The District Court, in instructing the jury on Count I,\nwhich   encompassed     LePage’s   claim    of  unlawful\nmaintenance of monopoly power under § 2, explained:\n    Count I in this case is unlawful maintenance of\n    monopoly power.\n      LePage’s alleges that it was injured by 3M’s unlawful\n    monopolization in the United States market for\n    invisible and transparent tape for home and office use.\n      To win on their claim of monopolization, LePage’s\n    must prove each of the following elements by a\n    preponderance of the evidence.\n     First, that 3M had monopoly power in the relevant\n    market.\n      Secondly, that 3M willfully maintained that power\n    through predatory or exclusionary conduct. . . .\n      And thirdly, that LePage’s was injured in its business\n    or property because of 3M’s restrictive or exclusionary\n    conduct.\nApp. at 5663-64.\n  3M complains that the District Court failed to provide\nguidance that would instruct the jury how to distinguish\n\f                              41\n\n\nbetween unlawful predation and lawful conduct. However,\nin explaining LePage’s maintenance of monopoly claim, the\nDistrict Court told the jury that in order to find for\nLePage’s, it would have to find by a preponderance of the\nevidence that 3M willfully maintained its monopoly power\nthrough exclusionary or predatory conduct. App. at 5663.\nIt then summarized those of 3M’s actions that LePage’s\ncontended were unlawfully exclusionary or predatory,\nincluding 3M’s rebate program, market development fund,\nits efforts to control, reduce or eliminate private-label tape,\nand its efforts to raise the price consumers pay for Scotch\ntape. Thereafter, the judge provided the jury with the\nfollowing factors to determine whether 3M’s conduct was\neither exclusionary or predatory: “its effect on its\ncompetitors, such as LePage’s, its impact on consumers,\nand whether it has impaired competition, in an\nunnecessarily restrictive way.” App. at 5670.\n  Relevant portions of the charge were as follows:\n    The law directs itself not against conduct which is\n    competitive, even severely so, but rather against\n    conduct which tends to destroy competition itself.\nApp. at 5655.\n    LePage’s must prove that 3M willfully maintained\n    monopoly power by predatory or exclusionary conduct,\n    rather than by supplying better products or services, or\n    by exercising superior business judgment, or just by\n    chance. So willful maintenance of monopoly power,\n    that’s an element LePage’s has to prove.\nApp. at 5668.\n    To prove that 3M acted willfully, LePage’s must prove\n    either that 3M engaged in predatory or exclusionary\n    acts or practices, with the conscious objective of\n    furthering the dominance of 3M in the relevant market,\n    or that this was the necessary direct consequence of\n    3M’s conduct or business arrangement.\nApp. at 5668.\n    I’m now giving you what LePage’s contentions are as to\n    what 3M did or did not do, that constituted predatory\n\f                             42\n\n\n    or exclusionary conduct. Number one, 3M’s rebate\n    program, such as the EGF, executive growth fund, or\n    the PGF, the partnership growth fund, and the brand\n    mix program. Number two, 3M’s market development\n    fund called the MDS in some of the testimony, and\n    other payments to customers conditioned on customers\n    achieving certain sales goals or growth targets. Third,\n    3M’s efforts to control, or reduce, or eliminate private\n    label tape. Four, 3M’s efforts to switch customers to\n    3M’s more expensive branded tape, and Five, 3M’s\n    efforts to raise the price consumers pay for Scotch\n    tape. LePage’s claims that all of these things that I’ve\n    just gone through was predatory or exclusionary\n    conduct. Now, 3M denies in every respect that these\n    actions were predatory or exclusionary. 3M contends\n    that these actions were, in fact, pro-competitive.\nApp. at 5668-69.\n    Exclusionary    conduct    and     predatory      conduct\n    comprehends, at the most, behavior that not only, one,\n    tends to impair the opportunities of its rivals, but also,\n    number two, either does not further competition on the\n    merits, or does so in an unnecessarily restrictive way.\n    If 3M has been attempting to exclude rivals on some\n    basis other than efficiency, you may characterize the\n    behavior as predatory.\nApp. at 5670.\n    However, you may not find that a competent, willfully\n    maintained monopoly power, if that company has\n    maintained that power, solely through the exercise of\n    superior foresight or skill in industry, or because of\n    economic or technological efficiencies, or because of\n    size, or because of changes in customer and consumer\n    preferences, or simply because the market is so limited\n    that it is impossible to efficiently produce the product,\n    except by a plan large enough to supply the whole\n    demand.\nApp. at 5670-71.\n    Now with respect to Count 1, unlawfully maintaining\n    monopoly power, mere possession of monopoly power,\n    if lawfully acquired, does not violate the antitrust laws.\n\f                             43\n\n\nApp. at 5671.\n    In determining whether there has been an unlawful\n    exercise of monopoly power, you must bear in mind\n    that a company has not acted unlawfully simply\n    because it has engaged in ordinary competitive\n    behavior that would have been an effective means of\n    competition if it were engaged in by a firm without\n    monopoly power, or simply because it is a large\n    company and a very efficient one.\nApp. at 5672.\n  The trial court further noted that if the jury found the\nevidence to be insufficient to prove any of the elements, it\nhad to find for 3M and against LePage’s. It was careful to\nnote that intense business competition was not considered\npredatory or exclusionary, explaining:\n    The acts or practices that result in the maintenance of\n    monopoly power must represent something other than\n    the conduct of business that is part of the normal\n    competitive process or even extraordinary commercial\n    success. [3M] must represent conduct that has made it\n    very difficult or impossible for competitors to engage in\n    fair competition.\nApp. at 5671.\n  The District Court closely followed the ABA sample\ninstructions when instructing the jury as to predatory and\nexclusionary    conduct,    including    its   instructions\ndistinguishing between procompetitive and anticompetitive\nconduct. See ABA, Sample Jury Instructions in Civil\nAntitrust Cases C-20 to C-21 (1999 Ed.). Furthermore, the\njury instructions were a modified version of those given in\nAspen Skiing, which the Supreme Court did not find\nobjectionable. 472 U.S. at 596-97.\n   3M contends that the District Court was obligated to take\ninto account the decision in Brooke Group when crafting its\njury instructions. As we have explained, Brooke Group\ninvolved claims of predatory pricing, a claim LePage’s never\nalleged against 3M. It follows that the District Court need\nnot have, indeed should not have, instructed the jury as to\nclaims not at issue in the case.\n\f                             44\n\n\n  The jury was given the following questions on Count I:\n    (1) Do you find that LePage’s has proven, by a\n    preponderance of the evidence, that the relevant\n    market is invisible and transparent tape for home and\n    office use in the United States?\n    (2) Do you find that LePage’s has proven, by a\n    preponderance of the evidence, that 3M unlawfully\n    maintained monopoly power as defined under the\n    instructions for Count I?; [and]\n    (2.1) Do you find that LePage’s has proven, as a matter\n    of fact and with a fair degree of certainty, that 3M’s\n    unlawful maintenance of monopoly power injured\n    LePage’s business or property as defined in these\n    instructions?\nApp. at 6523. The jury answered “yes” to each of the three\nquestions. It awarded LePage’s more than $22 million\nbefore trebling.\n  The District Court gave the jury a thorough, clear charge\nas to the § 2 claim. Based on its sound instructions, the\njury decided that LePage’s had met its evidentiary burden\nas to its § 2 claim. Nothing in the jury charge constitutes\nreversible error.\n\n                             IX.\n\n                      CROSS APPEAL\n\n             ATTEMPTED MONOPOLIZATION\n   LePage’s cross appeals from the District Court’s order\ngranting judgment as a matter of law to 3M on LePage’s\nclaim that 3M illegally attempted to maintain its monopoly.\nIn overturning the jury’s verdict for LePage’s on this claim,\nthe District Court stated that “ ‘an attempted maintenance\nof monopoly power’ ” is “inherently illogical.” LePage’s, 2000\nWL 280350, at *2.\n  LePage’s argues that the courts and commentators have\nrepeatedly found that defendants can be guilty of both\n\f                             45\n\n\nmonopolization and attempted monopolization claims\narising out of the same conduct. See, e.g., Am. Tobacco Co.,\n328 U.S. at 783 (affirming judgment that defendants were\nguilty of monopolization and attempted monopolization);\nEarl Kintner, 2 Federal Antitrust Law § 13.1 n.5 (1980). It\nemphasizes that in Lorain Journal, the Supreme Court\nupheld a § 2 attempted monopolization judgment against\nthe defendant newspaper, holding that “a single newspaper,\nalready enjoying a substantial monopoly in its area, violates\nthe ‘attempt to monopolize’ clause of § 2 when it uses its\nmonopoly to destroy threatened competition.” 342 U.S. at\n154.\n   We need not consider the correctness of the District\nCourt’s ruling on the attempted monopolization claim\nbecause we uphold its decision on the monopolization\nclaim. The jury returned the same amount of damages on\nboth claims and LePage’s concedes that under those\ncircumstances discussion of the attempted monopolization\nis unnecessary.\n\n                             X.\n\n                       CONCLUSION\n   Section 2, the provision of the antitrust laws designed to\ncurb the excesses of monopolists and near-monopolists, is\nthe equivalent in our economic sphere of the guarantees of\nfree and unhampered elections in the political sphere. Just\nas democracy can thrive only in a free political system\nunhindered by outside forces, so also can market\ncapitalism survive only if those with market power are kept\nin check. That is the goal of the antitrust laws.\n  The jury heard the evidence and the contentions of the\nparties, accepting some and rejecting others. There was\nample evidence that 3M used its market power over\ntransparent tape, backed by its considerable catalog of\nproducts, to entrench its monopoly to the detriment of\nLePage’s, its only serious competitor, in violation of § 2 of\nthe Sherman Act. We find no reversible error. Accordingly,\nwe will affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\f46\n\n\n     Volume 2 of 2\n\f                             48\n\n\nGREENBERG, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n   I respectfully dissent as I would reverse the district\ncourt’s order denying the motion for judgment as a matter\nof law on the monopolization claim but affirm on LePage’s’s\ncross-appeal from the motion granting 3M a judgment as a\nmatter of law on the attempted maintenance of monopoly\nclaim. While I recognize that the majority opinion describes\nthe factual background of this case, I nevertheless also will\nset forth its background as I believe that a more specific\nexposition of the facts leads to a conclusion that LePage’s’s\ncase should not have survived 3M’s motion for a judgment\nas a matter of law.\n  As the majority indicates, 3M dominated the United\nStates transparent tape market with a market share above\n90% until the early 1990s. LePage’s around 1980 decided\nto sell “second brand” and private label tape, i.e., tape sold\nunder the retailer’s, rather than the manufacturer’s name,\nan endeavor successful to the extent that LePage’s captured\n88% of private label tape sales in the United States by\n1992. Moreover, growth of “second brand” and private label\ntape accounted for a shift of some tape sales from branded\ntape to private label tape so the size of the private label\ntape business expanded. In the circumstances, not\nsurprisingly, during the early 1990s, 3M also entered the\nprivate label tape business.\n  As the majority notes, LePage’s claims that, in response\nto the growth of this competitive market, 3M engaged in a\nseries of related, anticompetitive acts aimed at restricting\nthe availability of lower-priced transparent tape to\nconsumers. In particular, it asserts that 3M devised\nprograms that prevented LePage’s and the other domestic\ncompany in the business, Tesa Tuck, Inc., from gaining or\nmaintaining large volume sales and that 3M maintained its\nmonopoly by stifling growth of private label tape and by\ncoordinating efforts aimed at large distributors to keep\nretail prices for Scotch tape high. LePage’s barely was\nsurviving at the time of trial and suffered large operating\nlosses from 1996 through 1999.\n  This case centers on 3M’s rebate programs that,\nbeginning in 1993, involved offers by 3M of “package” or\n\f                             49\n\n\n“bundled” discounts for various items ranging from home\ncare and leisure products to audio/visual and stationery\nproducts. Customers could earn rebates by purchasing, in\naddition to transparent tape, a variety of products sold by\n3M’s stationery division, such as Post-It Notes and\npackaging products. There is no doubt but that these\nprograms created incentives for retailers to purchase more\n3M products and enabled them to have single invoices,\nsingle shipments and uniform pricing programs for various\n3M products. 3M linked the size of the rebates to the\nnumber of product lines in which the customers met the\ntargets, an aggregate number that determined the rebate\npercentage the customer would receive on all of its 3M\npurchases across all product lines. Therefore, if customers\nfailed to meet growth targets in multiple categories, they did\nnot receive any rebate, and if they failed to meet the target\nin one product line, 3M reduced their rebates substantially.\nThese requirements are at the crux of the controversy here,\nas LePage’s claims that customers could not meet these\ngrowth targets without eliminating it as a supplier of\ntransparent tape.\n   In practice, as 3M’s rebate program evolved, it offered\nthree different types of rebates: Executive Growth Fund,\nPartnership Growth Fund and Brand Mix Rebates. 3M\ndeveloped a “test program” called Executive Growth Fund\n(“EGF ”) for a small number of retailers, 11 in 1993 and 15\nin 1994. Under EGF, 3M negotiated volume and growth\ntargets for each customer’s purchases from the six 3M\nconsumer product divisions involved in the EGF program.\nA customer meeting the target in three or more divisions\nearned a volume rebate of between 0.2-1.25% of total sales.\n  Beginning in 1995, 3M undertook to end the EGF test\nprogram and institute a rebate program called Partnership\nGrowth Fund (“PGF ”) for the same six 3M consumer\nproducts divisions. Under this program, 3M established\nuniform growth targets applicable to all participants.\nCustomers who increased their purchases from at least two\ndivisions by $1.00 and increased their total purchases by at\nleast 12% over the previous year qualified for the rebate,\nwhich ranged from 0.5% to 2%, depending on the number\nof divisions (between two to five divisions) in which the\n\f                             50\n\n\ncustomer increased its purchases and the total volume of\npurchases.\n   In 1996 and 1997, 3M offered price incentives called\nBrand Mix Rebates to two tape customers, Office Depot and\nStaples, to increase purchases of Scotch brand tapes. 3M\nimposed a minimum purchase level for tape set at the level\nof Office Depot’s and Staples’s purchases the previous year\nwith “growth” factored in. To obtain a higher rebate, these\ntwo customers could increase their percentage of Scotch\npurchases relative to certain lower-priced orders.\n  The evidence at trial focused on the parties’ dealings with\na limited number of customers and demonstrated that\nLePage’s’s problems were attributed to a number of factors,\nnot merely 3M’s rebate programs. Thus, I describe this\nevidence at length.\n\n                         Wal-Mart\n   Before 1992, Wal-Mart bought private label tape only\nfrom LePage’s but, in August 1992, decided to buy private\nlabel tape from 3M as well. In response, LePage’s lowered\nits prices and increased its sales to Wal-Mart. In 1997, Wal-\nMart stopped buying private label tape but offered\nLePage’s’s branded tape as its “second tier” offering. In\n1998, however, Wal-Mart told LePage’s that it was going to\nswitch to a tape program from 3M. LePage’s’s president\nthen visited Wal-Mart following which it changed its plans\nand retained LePage’s as a supplier. Afterwards, Wal-Mart\ndesigned a test comparing LePage’s’s brand against a 3M\nScotch utility tape to determine who would win Wal-Mart’s\n“second tier” tape business. LePage’s added more inches\n(approximately 20% more) to its rolls of tape and won the\ntest. 3M continued, however, to sell Scotch brand tapes to\nWal-Mart, and LePage’s saw its sales to Wal-Mart decline to\napproximately $2,000,000 annually by the time of trial.\nLePage’s claims that Wal-Mart cut back on its tape\npurchases to qualify for 3M’s bundled rebate of $1,468,835\nin 1995.\n\n                           Kmart\n Kmart accounted for 10% of LePage’s’s annual tape sales\nwhen LePage’s lost its business to 3M in 1993. Kmart\n\f                             51\n\n\nasked its suppliers, including 3M, to provide a single bid on\nits entire private label tape business for the following year.\nLePage’s’s president believed, however, that Kmart was “too\nlazy to make a change,” and that it would “never put their\neggs in one basket” by giving all its business to 3M.\nLePage’s offered the same price it had offered the previous\nyear but also offered a volume rebate. 3M offered a lower\nprice and won the bid. Kmart asked for rebates and\n“market development” funds as part of the private label\ntape bid process. 3M offered $200,000 for promotional\nactivities and a $300,000 volume rebate if Kmart purchased\n$10,000,000 of 3M’s Stationery Division products.\n   LePage’s claims that 3M offered Kmart $1,000,000 to\neliminate LePage’s and Tesa as suppliers and to make 3M\nits sole tape supplier. LePage’s points to a 3M document\noutlining 3M’s goal for Kmart to exceed $15,000,000 in 3M\npurchases with the reward being that Kmart would receive\n$75,000 in each of the first two quarters and $100,000 in\nthe last two quarters for promotional activities and would\nreceive $650,000 as a volume rebate if the sales exceeded\n$15,000,000. If the sales were less, 3M would decrease the\nrebate accordingly, e.g., a $400,000 rebate for $13,000,000\nof sales. LePage’s claims that, as a practical matter, Kmart\nhad to eliminate LePage’s and Tesa to reach the growth 3M\nrequired in order to qualify for the rebate. LePage’s asserts\nthat, despite its efforts to regain the private label business\nfrom Kmart, one Kmart buyer told it that he could not talk\nto LePage’s about tape products for the next three years.\n\n                           Staples\n   Staples had been a LePage’s customer for several years.\nFrom 1990 to 1993, LePage’s increased its sales to Staples\nby 440%, growing from $357,000 to $1,954,000. In 1994,\nStaples considered reducing suppliers and asked LePage’s\nand 3M for their best offers in 1994. LePage’s assumed that\nif 3M did make a good offer, LePage’s would have a chance\nto make a better proposal. LePage’s did not make its lowest\noffer, and 3M won the account. When LePage’s went back\nto Staples with a new price, it was told that the decision\nhad been made. LePage’s claims that 3M offered an extra\n1% bonus rebate on Scotch products if Staples eliminated\n\f                            52\n\n\nLePage’s as a supplier (a “growth” rebate that only could be\nmet by converting all of Staple’s private label business to\n3M). 3M paid Staples an advertising allowance in four\npayments totalling $1,000,000 in 1995 and gave it\n$500,000 in free merchandise delivered during Staples’s\nfiscal year 1994. 3M refers to a “$1.5 million settlement”\nwith Staples and refers to multiple payments for different\npurposes. LePage’s, however, implies that these payments\nbore some connection to Staples’s award of its second-tier\ntape business to 3M.\n\n                        Office Max\n   In 1998, after a dispute between Office Max and LePage’s,\nOffice Max accepted 3M’s offer that matched but did not\nbeat LePage’s’s price. LePage’s objected to 3M’s matching\nwhatever price LePage’s offered, and also objected to 3M’s\n“clout” payment. Office Max required its suppliers to make\npayments to help advertise the Office Max name, and\nLePage’s had paid this “clout” payment in the years\nprevious to 1998 when it refused to pay it because of its\ndispute with Office Max. Nevertheless, the buyer for Office\nMax testified that its decision to give its business to 3M\nwas not related to its pricing and rebate program but rather\nto the consistency of its service.\n\n                        Walgreens\n  Walgreens had purchased private label tape from\nLePage’s from 1992 until 1998, when it decided to import\ntape from Taiwan. LePage’s’s chief executive officer\nacknowledged that LePage’s did not lose the account due to\n3M’s activities.\n\n                     American Stores\n  Until 1995, LePage’s’s sales of private label tape to\nAmerican Stores exceeded $1,000,000 annually. According\nto LePage’s, a month after American Stores decided that it\nwould try to maximize 3M’s PGF rebate, it shifted its tape\nbusiness to 3M. In 1995, American Stores decided to stop\nbuying LePage’s tape, principally because of quality\n\f                             53\n\n\nconcerns. In a letter to James Kowieski, Senior Vice\nPresident of Sales at LePage’s, Kevin Winsauer, the\nmanager of the private label department at American,\nwrote: “After much deliberation comparing the pros and\ncons of LePage’s program and 3M’s program, I have decided\nto award the business to 3M. 3M’s proposal was very\ncompetitive and I am sure LePage’s would meet their costs\nto retain the business. However, the decision to move to 3M\nis primarily based on Quality.” SJA 2050-51 (emphasis in\noriginal). When American Stores decided to purchase from\n3M, it was not participating in any rebate programs, and\nWinsauer testified that he was not aware that there were\nrebate programs. He also testified that even without the\nvolume incentive programs, 3M’s price was still slightly\nlower than LePage’s’s.\n\n           Dollar General, CVS, and Sam’s Club\n   LePage’s lost Dollar General’s private label business to a\nforeign supplier but later won the business back. According\nto LePage’s’s president, Dollar General used the bid for\nimported tape to leverage a price reduction from LePage’s.\n3M bid on the CVS account, but LePage’s retained CVS as\na customer by lowering its prices and increasing its rebate.\nAt Sam’s Club, LePage’s tape had been selling well when its\nbuyers were directed by senior management to “maximize”\nall purchases from 3M to maximize the EGF/PGF rebate.\nSubsequently, Sam’s Club stopped purchasing from\nLePage’s.\n\n           Other distributors and buying groups\n  LePage’s claimed that 3M’s pricing practices prevented or\nhindered it from selling private label tape to certain\ncompanies: (1) Costco. Costco, however, never has sold\nprivate label tape. (2) Office Depot. Office Depot also never\nhas sold private label tape. LePage’s tried to convince Office\nDepot to buy private label tape in 1991 or 1992 (before 3M\nimplemented the rebate programs), but Office Depot\ndecided to continue purchasing 3M brand tape. (3) Pamida\nand Venture Stores. LePage’s claimed that 3M offered these\nstores discounts conditioned on exclusivity, thereby\n\f                            54\n\n\npreventing LePage’s from selling private label tape to them.\nLePage’s lost Venture Stores’ business in 1989, five years\nbefore 3M provided the discount at issue. (4) Office Buying\nGroups. 3M offered an optional 0.3% price discount to\ncertain buying groups if they exclusively promoted certain\n3M products in their catalogs. If the buying group carried\na lower value brand alternative to 3M’s main brand (its\nsecond line), then the group would receive a lower annual\nvolume rebate. LePage’s viewed these kind of contract\nprovisions as a “penalty” that coerced buying group\nmembers to purchase tape only from 3M. For example, if a\nbuying group promoted the products of a competitor, it lost\nrebates for purchases in three categories of products. 3M\nargues that LePage’s could have offered its own discount or\nrebate but instead refused in one instance to pay the\nstandard promotional fee charged suppliers for inclusion in\na catalog.\n   Notwithstanding the evidence which demonstrates that\nLePage’s lost business for reasons that could not possibly\nbe attributable to any unlawful conduct by 3M, it argues\nthat 3M willfully maintained its monopoly through a\n“monopoly broth” of anticompetitive and predatory conduct.\nI would reject LePage’s’s argument as I agree with 3M that\nLePage’s simply did not establish that 3M’s conduct was\nillegal, as LePage’s did not demonstrate that 3M’s pricing\nwas below cost (a point that is not in dispute) and, in the\nabsence of such proof, the record does not supply any other\nbasis on which we can uphold the judgment.\n   There are two elements of a monopolization claim under\nsection 2 of the Sherman Act: “(1) the possession of\nmonopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful\nacquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished\nfrom growth or development as a consequence of a superior\nproduct, business acumen, or historic accident.” United\nStates v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 86 S.Ct.\n1698, 1704 (1966). Willful maintenance involves using\nanticompetitive conduct to “foreclose competition, to gain a\ncompetitive advantage, or to destroy a competitor.” Eastman\nKodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., 504 U.S. 451, 482-83,\n112 S.Ct. 2072, 2090 (1992) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). LePage’s contends that 3M’s bundled rebates were\n\f                             55\n\n\nanticompetitive and predatory. It also argues that 3M’s\nother practices, such as exclusionary contracts and the\ntiming of its rebates, were also anticompetitive and\npredatory. I discuss these claims in the order I have stated\nthem.\n  LePage’s primarily complains of 3M’s use of bundled\nrebates. While, as the majority recognizes, we have held\nthat rebates on volume purchases are lawful, see Advo, Inc.\nv. Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., 51 F.3d 1191, 1203 (3d\nCir. 1995), LePage’s seeks to avoid that principle by\npointing out that 3M offered higher rebates if customers\nmet their target growth rate in different product categories,\nin effect linking the sale of private label tape with the sale\nof other products, such as Scotch tape, which customers\nhad to buy from 3M. Thus, LePage’s explains:\n    3M understood that, as a practical matter, every\n    retailer in the country had to carry Scotch-brand tape\n    . . . . It therefore decided to structure its rebates into\n    bundles that linked that product with the product\n    segment in which it did face competition from LePage’s\n    (second-line tape) . . . . To increase the leverage on the\n    targeted segment, 3M further linked rebates on\n    transparent tape with those for many other products\n    . . . . The rival would have to ‘compensate’ the\n    customer for the amount of rebate it would lose not\n    only on the large volume of Scotch-brand tape it had to\n    buy, but also for rebates on many other products\n    purchased from 3M.\nBr. of Appellee at 40.\n  In making its argument LePage’s relies in part on\nSmithKline Corp. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 575 F.2d 1056 (3d Cir.\n1978), which, as the majority notes, does not bind this en\nbanc court but nevertheless can have precedential value. In\nSmithKline, Eli Lilly & Co. had two products, Keflin and\nKeflex, on which it faced no competition, and one product,\nKefzol, on which it faced competition from SmithKline’s\nproduct, Ancef. See id. at 1061. Lilly offered a higher rebate\nof 3% to companies that purchased specified quantities of\nany three (which, practically speaking, meant combined\npurchases of Kefzol, Keflin and Keflex) of Lilly’s\n\f                                    56\n\n\ncephalosporin products. See id. “Although hospitals were\nfree to purchase SmithKline’s Ancef with their Keflin and\nKeflex orders with Lilly, thus avoiding the penalties of a tie-\nin sale,[1] the practical effect of that decision would be to\ndeny the Ancef purchaser the 3% bonus rebate on all its\ncephalosporin products.” Id. at 1061-62 (internal footnote\nadded). Because of Lilly’s volume advantage, to offer a\nrebate of the same net dollar amount as Lilly’s, SmithKline\nwould have had to offer companies rebates ranging from\n16% for average size hospitals to 35% for larger volume\nhospitals for their purchase of Ancef. See id. at 1062.\n   We concluded that Lilly willfully acquired and maintained\nmonopoly power by linking products on which it faced no\ncompetition (Keflin and Keflex) with a competitive product,\nresulting in the sale of all three products on a non-\ncompetitive basis in what otherwise would have been a\ncompetitive market between Ancef and Kefzol. See id. at\n1065. Moreover, this arrangement would force SmithKline\nto pay rebates on one product equal to rebates paid by Lilly\nbased on sales volume of three products. See id. Expert\ntestimony and the evidence on pricing showed that in the\ncircumstances SmithKline’s prospects for continuing in the\nAncef market were poor.\n   LePage’s argues that it does not have to show that 3M’s\npackage discounts could prevent an equally efficient firm\nfrom matching or beating 3M’s package discounts. In its\nbrief, LePage’s contends that its expert economist explained\nthat 3M’s programs and cash payments have the same\nanticompetitive impact regardless of the cost structure of\nthe rival suppliers or their efficiency relative to that of 3M.\nSee Br. of Appellee at 43. LePage’s alleges that the relative\nefficiency or cost structure of the competitor simply affects\n\n1. 3M also avoids the penalties of a tie-in sale, because its customers\nwere free to purchase its Scotch tape by itself. To prove an illegal tie-in,\na plaintiff must establish that the agreement to sell one product was\nconditioned on the purchase of a different or tied product; the seller “has\nsufficient economic power with respect to the tying product to\nappreciably restrain free competition in the market for the tied product\nand a ‘not insubstantial’ amount of interstate commerce is affected.”\nNorthern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 6, 78 S.Ct. 514, 518\n(1958).\n\f                             57\n\n\nhow long it would take 3M to foreclose the rival from\nobtaining the volume of business necessary to survive. See\nid. “Competition is harmed just the same by the loss of the\nonly existing competitive constraints on 3M in a market\nwith high entry barriers.” Id. The district court stated that\nLePage’s introduced substantial evidence that the\nanticompetitive effects of 3M’s rebate program caused its\nlosses. See LePage’s Inc. v. 3M, No. Civ. A. 97-3983, 2000\nWL 280350, at *7-8 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 14, 2000). The majority\nfinds that “3M’s conduct was at least as anticompetitive as\nthe conduct which [we] held violated § 2 in SmithKline.”\nMaj. Op. at 24.\n  I disagree with the majority’s use of SmithKline.\nSmithKline showed that it could not compete by explaining\nhow much it would have had to lower prices for both small\nand big customers to do so. SmithKline ascertained the\nrebates that Lilly was giving to customers on all three\nproducts and calculated how much it would have had to\nlower the price of its product if the rebates were all\nattributed to the one competitive product. In contrast,\nLePage’s did not even attempt to show that it could not\ncompete by calculating the discount that it would have had\nto provide in order to match the discounts offered by 3M\nthrough its bundled rebates, and thus its brief does not\npoint to evidence along such lines.\n   While I recognize that it is obvious from the size of 3M’s\nrebates as compared to LePage’s’s sales that Lepage’s would\nhave had to make substantial reductions in prices to match\nthe rebates 3M paid to particular customers, Lepage’s did\nnot show the amount by which it lowered its prices in\nactual monetary figures or by percentage to compete with\n3M and how its profitability thus was decreased. Rather,\nLePage’s merely maintains, through the use of an expert,\nthat it would have had to cut its prices drastically to\ncompete and thus would have gone out of business.\nFurthermore, it is critically important to recognize that\nLePage’s had 67% of the private label business at the time\nof the trial. Thus, notwithstanding 3M’s rebates, LePage’s\nwas able to retain most of the private label business. In the\ncircumstances, it is ironical that LePage’s complains of\n3M’s use of monopoly power as the undisputed fact is that\n\f                                  58\n\n\nLePage’s, not 3M, was the dominant supplier of private\nlabel tape both before and after 3M initiated its rebate\nprograms. Indeed, the record suggests that inasmuch as\nLePage’s could not make a profit with a 67% share of the\nprivate label sales, it must have needed to be essentially the\nexclusive supplier of such tape for its business to be\nprofitable as it in fact was when it had an 88% share of the\nprivate label tape sales business.\n   Although I am not evaluating the expert’s method of\ncalculating damages as I would not reach the damages\nissue, I emphasize that simply pointing to an expert to\nsupport the contention that the company would have gone\nout of business, without providing even the most basic\npricing information, is insufficient. “Expert testimony is\nuseful as a guide to interpreting market facts, but it is not\na substitute for them.” Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown &\nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 242, 113 S.Ct.\n2578, 2598 (1993); see also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v.\nZenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 594 n.19, 106 S.Ct.\n1348, 1360 n.19 (1986); Advo, 51 F.3d at 1198-99; Virgin\nAtlantic Airways Ltd. v. British Airways PLC, 69 F. Supp. 2d\n571, 579 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (“[A]n expert’s opinion is not a\nsubstitute for a plaintiff ’s obligation to provide evidence of\nfacts that support the applicability of the expert’s opinion to\nthe case.”), aff ’d, 257 F.3d 256 (2d Cir. 2001). Without\nsuch pricing information, it is difficult even to begin to\nestimate how much of the market share LePage’s lost was\ndue to 3M’s bundled rebates. In fact, the evidence that I\ndescribed above conclusively demonstrates that LePage’s\nlost private sale tape business for reasons not related to\n3M’s rebates. Furthermore, some experts have questioned\nthe validity of attributing all the rebates to the one\ncompetitive product in situations such as these.2 I do not\n\n2. One court has mentioned a hypothetical situation where a low-cost\nshampoo maker could not match a competitor’s package discount for\nshampoo and conditioner even though both products were priced above\ntheir respective costs. See Ortho Diagnostic Sys., Inc. v. Abbott Labs.,\nInc., 920 F. Supp. 455, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). In that case, the court\nsuggested that the bundled price could be unlawful under section 2 even\nthough neither item in the package was priced below cost. If the entire\npackage discount were attributed to the one product where the two\n\f                                   59\n\n\nneed, however, to decide the validity of that method of\ncalculation, as LePage’s does not even attempt to meet that\nless strict test by calculating how much it would have had\nto lower its prices to match the rebates, even if they all\nwere aggregated and attributed to private label tape.3\n   LePage’s also has not satisfied the stricter tests devised\nby other courts considering bundled rebates in situations\nsuch as that here. In a case brought by a manufacturer of\nproducts used in screening blood supply for viruses, Ortho\nDiagnostic Systems, Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., 920 F.\nSupp. 455 (S.D.N.Y. 1996), the district court held, inter\nalia, that the defendant’s discount pricing of products in\npackages did not violate the Sherman Act. The defendant,\nAbbott Laboratories, manufactured all five of the commonly\nused tests to screen the blood supply for viruses. Ortho\n\nparties compete, the low-cost shampoo maker could not lower its prices\non the product enough to match the total discount without selling below\nits cost. See id. at 467-69. Commentators, however, suggests that this\nanalysis is incorrect. See III PHILLIP E. AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP,\nANTITRUST LAW: AN ANALYSIS OF ANTITRUST PRINCIPLES AND THEIR APPLICATION\n¶ 749, at 467 n.6 (rev. ed. 1996).\n  One aspect of this method of calculation worth noting is that the\nvolume of the products ordered has a drastic effect on how much the\ncompetitor would have to lower its prices to compete. For example,\nsuppose in a similar rebate program, a company was the only producer\nof products A and B but faced competition in C. If a customer orders 100\nunits each of A, B, and C at a price of $1.00 each, a 3% rebate would\nbe $9.00 (3% of the total of $300.00). If the rebate on all three products\nwere attributed to product C, then the competitor would have to lower its\nprice to $0.91 in order to compete with it. The results would be starkly\ndifferent, however, if a customer orders 100 units of A and B but only\nneeds 10 units of C. Then the 3% rebate on the total purchase amount\nof $210.00 would be $6.30. If the rebate was attributed solely to product\nC, then a competitor would have to lower its price to $.37 on product C\nin order to match the company’s price.\n3. The closest LePage’s comes to supplying such information in its brief\nis its statement that “LePage’s made repeated efforts to save its tape\nbusiness with Staples, reducing its prices to 1990 levels, and then\nreducing them again, to keep its plant open and people working.” Br. of\nAppellee at 11. This is not close enough. Of course, Lepage’s’s prices\noverall were low enough for it to have 67% of the private label business.\n\f                             60\n\n\nclaimed that Abbott violated sections 1 and 2 of the\nSherman Act by contracting with the Council of Community\nBlood Centers to give those members advantageous pricing\nif they purchased a package of four or five tests from\nAbbott, thereby using its monopoly position in some of the\ntests to foreclose or impair competition by Ortho in the sale\nof those tests available from both companies. See id. at\n458. The district court stated that to prevail on a\nmonopolization claim in “a case in which a monopolist (1)\nfaces competition on only part of a complementary group of\nproducts, (2) offers the products both as a package and\nindividually, and (3) effectively forces its competitors to\nabsorb the differential between the bundled and unbundled\nprices of the product in which the monopolist has market\npower,” the plaintiff must allege and prove “either that (a)\nthe monopolist has priced below its average variable cost or\n(b) the plaintiff is at least as efficient a producer of the\ncompetitive product as the defendant, but that the\ndefendant’s pricing makes it unprofitable for the plaintiff to\ncontinue to produce.” Id. at 469.\n  Holding that the discount package pricing did not violate\nthe Sherman Act, the Ortho court explained that any other\nrule would involve too substantial a risk that the antitrust\nlaws would be used to protect an inefficient competitor\nagainst price competition that would benefit consumers.\nSee id. at 469-70 (“The antitrust laws were not intended,\nand may not be used, to require businesses to price their\nproducts at unreasonably high prices (which penalize the\nconsumer) so that less efficient competitors can stay in\nbusiness.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  In this case, as the majority acknowledges, LePage’s now\ndoes not contend that 3M priced its products below average\nvariable cost, an allegation which, if made, in any event\nwould be difficult to prove. See Advo, 51 F.3d at 1198-99.\nMoreover, LePage’s’s economist conceded that LePage’s is\nnot as efficient a tape producer as 3M. Thus, in this case\nsection 2 of the Sherman Act is being used to protect an\ninefficient producer from a competitor not using predatory\npricing but rather selling above cost. While the majority\ncontends that Brooke Group, a case on which 3M heavily\nrelies, is distinguishable as none of the defendants there\n\f                              61\n\n\nhad a monopoly in the market, the fact remains that the\nCourt in describing section 2 of the Sherman Act said flat\nout in Brooke Group that “a plaintiff seeking to establish\ncompetitive injury from a rival’s low prices must prove that\nthe prices complained of are below an appropriate measure\nof its rival’s costs.” Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 222, 113\nS.Ct. at 2587. LePage’s simply did not do this.\n   I realize that the majority indicates that “LePage’s unlike\nthe plaintiff in Brooke Group, does not make a predatory\npricing claim.” Maj. Op. at 16. But that circumstance\nweakens rather than strengthens LePage’s’s position as it\nmerely confirms the lawfulness of 3M’s conduct.\nFurthermore, the circumstance that 3M is not dealing in an\noligopolistic market should not matter as the harm that\nLePage’s claims to have suffered from the bundled rebates\nwould be no less if inflicted by multiple competitors.\nMoreover, monopolist or not, 3M, even in the absence of\nLePage’s and Tesa from the private label business, would\nnot be the only supplier of private lable tape for there are\nforeign suppliers as is demonstrated plainly by the evidence\nthat both Walgreens and Dollar General dealt with such\nsuppliers.\n   Contrary to the majority’s view, this is not a situation in\nwhich there is no business justification for 3M’s actions.\nThis point is important inasmuch as it is difficult to\ndistinguish legitimate competition from exclusionary\nconduct that harms competition, see United States v.\nMicrosoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 58 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied,\n534 U.S. 952, 122 S.Ct. 350 (2001), and some cases\nsuggest that when a company acts against its economic\ninterests and there is no valid business justification for its\nactions, then it is a good sign that its acts were intended to\neliminate competition.\n   For example, Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing\nCorp., 472 U.S. 585, 608, 105 S.Ct. 2847, 2860 (1985),\ndiscussed by the majority, sets forth the lack of a valid\nbusiness reason as a basis for finding liability. In that case,\nthe Court affirmed a jury verdict for the plaintiff under\nsection 2 of the Sherman Act where the defendant\nmonopolist had stopped cooperating with the plaintiff to\noffer a multi-venue skiing package for Aspen skiers. The\n\f                              62\n\n\nCourt held that because the defendant had acted contrary\nto its economic interests, by losing business and\ncustomers, there was no other rationale for its conduct\nexcept that it wished to eliminate the plaintiff as a\ncompetitor. See id. at 608, 105 S.Ct. at 2860; see also\nEastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 483, 112 S.Ct. at 2091\n(exclusionary conduct properly is condemned if valid\nbusiness reasons do not justify conduct that tends to\nimpair the opportunities of a monopolist’s rivals or if a valid\nasserted purpose would be served fully by less restrictive\nmeans).\n  On the other hand, in Concord Boat Corp. v. Brunswick\nCorp., 207 F.3d 1039, 1043, 1063 (8th Cir.), cert. denied,\n531 U.S. 979, 121 S.Ct. 428 (2000), where boat builders\nbrought an antitrust action against a stern drive engine\nmanufacturer, the court held, inter alia, that the evidence\nwas insufficient to find that the engine manufacturer’s\ndiscount programs restrained trade and monopolized the\nmarket. Brunswick offered a higher percentage discount\nwhen boat builders bought a higher percentage of their\nengines from it, but there was no allegation that its pricing\nwas below cost. See id. at 1044, 1062. In Concord Boat the\ndistrict court cited the district court opinion in this case\nwhen 3M filed its motion to dismiss. See LePage’s Inc. v.\n3M, No. Civ. A. 97-3983, 1997 WL 734005 (E.D. Pa. Nov.\n14, 1997). The Concord Boat district court agreed with the\nplaintiff that it was not the price (above cost or not) that\nwas relevant but the “strings” attached to the price and\nthat the district court here was correct to distinguish\nBrooke Group since there were no “strings” attached\n(bundled rebates) in Brooke Group. In Concord Boat, the\n“strings” attached were the exclusivity provisions. See\nConcord Boat Corp. v. Brunswick Corp., 21 F. Supp. 2d 923,\n930 (E.D. Ark. 1998).\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, however,\ndisagreed with the district court in Concord Boat. The court\nof appeals opinion reflected an application of Brooke\nGroup’s strong stance favoring vigorous price competition\nand expressing skepticism of the ability of a court to\nseparate anticompetitive from procompetitive actions when\nit comes to above-cost strategic pricing. See Concord Boat,\n\f                             63\n\n\n207 F.3d at 1061. More importantly, the court perceived\nthat Brooke Group should be considered even with claims\nbased on pricing with strings. See id. “If a firm has\ndiscounted prices to a level that remains above the firm’s\naverage variable cost, the plaintiff must overcome a strong\npresumption of legality by showing other factors indicating\nthat the price charged is anticompetitive.” Id. (citing Morgan\nv. Ponder, 892 F.2d 1355, 1360 (8th Cir. 1989)) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The court stated that a section 2\ndefendant’s proffered business justification is the most\nimportant factor in determining whether its challenged\nconduct is not competition on the merits. See id. at 1062.\nThe court distinguished cases such as SmithKline and\nOrtho where products were bundled since they involved two\nmarkets. See id. Of course, here we are dealing with a\nsingle market.\n   Unlike the situation of the defendant in Aspen, 3M’s\npricing structure and bundled rebates were not contrary to\nits economic interests, as they likely increased its sales. In\nfact, that is exactly what LePage’s is complaining about.\nFurthermore, other than the obvious reasons such as\nincreasing bulk sales, market share and customer loyalty,\nthere are several other potential “procompetitive” or valid\nbusiness reasons for 3M’s pricing structure and bundled\nrebates: efficiency in having single invoices, single\nshipments and uniform pricing programs for various\nproducts. Moreover, the record demonstrates that, with the\nbiggest customers, 3M’s rebates were not eliminating the\ncompetitive process, as LePage’s still was able to retain\nsome customers through negotiation, and even though it\nlost other customers, the losses were attributable to their\nswitching to foreign suppliers or changing suppliers\nbecause of quality or service without regard to the rebates.\nFurthermore, overall LePage’s was quite successful in\nholding its share of the private label sales as it had 67% of\nthe business at the time of the trial.\n  In sum, I conclude that as a matter of law 3M did not\nviolate section 2 of the Sherman Act by reason of its\nbundled rebates even though its practices harmed its\ncompetitors. The majority decision which upholds the\ncontrary verdict risks curtailing price competition and a\n\f                             64\n\n\nmethod of pricing beneficial to customers because the\nbundled rebates effectively lowered their costs. I regard this\nresult as a significant mistake which cannot be justified by\na fear that somehow 3M will raise prices unreasonably\nlater. In this regard I reiterate that in addition to LePage’s\nthere are foreign suppliers of transparent tape so that with\nor without LePage’s there will be constraints on 3M’s\npricing.\n   LePage’s also claims that, through a variety of other\nallegedly anticompetitive actions, 3M prevented LePage’s\nfrom competing. LePage’s asserts that 3M foreclosed\ncompetition by directly purchasing sole-supplier status.\nThere was some dispute as to whether the contracts were\nconditioned on 3M being the sole supplier, and 3M claims\nthat there are only two customers for which there is any\nevidence of a sole supplier agreement. I recognize, however,\nthat although most of 3M’s contracts with customers were\nnot conditioned on exclusivity, practically speaking some\ncustomers dropped LePage’s as a supplier to maximize the\nrebates that 3M was offering. Moreover, United Shoe\nMachinery Corp. v. United States, 258 U.S. 451, 458, 42\nS.Ct. 363, 365 (1922), explained that a contract that does\nnot contain specific agreements not to use the products of\na competitor still will come within the Clayton Act as to\nexclusivity if its practical effect is to prevent such use.\n   Even assuming, however, that 3M did have exclusive\ncontracts with some of the customers, LePage’s has not\ndemonstrated that 3M acted illegally, as one-year exclusive\ncontracts have been held to be reasonable and not unduly\nrestrictive. See Fed. Trade Comm’n v. Motion Picture Adver.\nServ. Co., 344 U.S. 392, 395-96, 73 S.Ct. 361, 363-64\n(1953) (holding that evidence sustained the Commission’s\nfinding    that   the   distributor’s   exclusive  screening\nagreements with theater operators unreasonably restrained\ncompetition, but stating that the Commission had found\nthat the term of one-year exclusive contracts had become a\nstandard practice and would not be an undue restraint on\ncompetition). See also Advo, 51 F.3d at 1204. In Tampa\nElectric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 327, 81\nS.Ct. 623, 627-28 (1961), the Court stated that even if in\npractical application a contract is found to be an exclusive-\n\f                                    65\n\n\ndealing arrangement, it does not violate section 3 of the\nClayton Act unless the court believes it probable that\nperformance of the contract will foreclose competition in a\nsubstantial share of the line of commerce affected. Using\nthat standard, although LePage’s’s market share in private\nlabel tape has fallen from 88% to 67%, it has not been\nestablished that, as a result of the allegedly exclusive\ncontracts, competition was foreclosed in a substantial share\nof the line of commerce affected. Indeed, in view of\nLePage’s’s two-thirds share of the private label business, its\nattack on exclusivity agreements is attenuated.\n   There appear to be very few cases supporting liability\nbased on section 2 of the Sherman Act for exclusive\ndealing, as some cases suggest that if, as is the case here\nunder the jury’s findings, there is no liability under section\n3 of the Clayton Act, it is more difficult to find liability\nunder the Sherman Act since its scope is more restricted.4\nIn any event, the record shows only two allegedly exclusive\ncontracts (with the Venture and Pamida stores), and\n“[b]ecause an exclusive deal affecting a small fraction of a\nmarket clearly cannot have the requisite harmful effect\nupon competition, the requirement of a significant degree of\nforeclosure serves a useful screening function.” Microsoft,\n253 F.3d at 69. The Microsoft court explained that although\nexclusive contracts are commonplace, particularly in the\nfield of distribution, in certain circumstances the use of\nexclusive contracts may give rise to a section 2 violation\neven though the contracts foreclose less than the roughly\n40 to 50% share usually required to establish a section 1\nviolation. See id. at 69-70. In this case, it cannot be\nconcluded that the two contracts with Venture and Pamida\nwere responsible for the total drop in LePage’s’s market\nshare. Furthermore, even if all 3M’s contracts were\nconsidered exclusive, LePage’s’s total drop in market share\nwas only 21%, and some of this loss was shown in the\nrecord to be due to quality or service consistency concerns,\nas well as foreign competition, rather than to 3M’s tactics.\n\n4. It is more common for charges of exclusive dealing to be brought\nunder section 1 of the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act, which the jury\nfound that 3M did not violate. See, e.g., Barr Labs., Inc. v. Abbott Labs.,\n978 F.2d 98, 110 (3d Cir. 1992).\n\f                             66\n\n\nTherefore, there was not enough foreclosure of the market\nto have an anticompetitive effect.\n  LePage’s also claims that by calculating the rebates only\nonce a year, 3M made it more difficult for a purchaser to\npass on the savings to its customers, thereby making it\nharder for companies to switch suppliers and keeping retail\nprices and margins high. As I discussed above, one-year\ncontracts may be considered standard, and even if they\nmake it more unlikely that rebates are passed on in the\nform of lower retail prices, the discounts could be applied\ntowards lowering retail prices the following year or towards\nother costs by companies that are factored into the retail\nprices (such as advertising). In the circumstances, I am\nsatisfied that this conduct does not qualify as predatory or\nanticompetitive so as to establish liability under section 2\nof the Sherman Act.\n   LePage’s also alleges that 3M entered the retail private\nlabel tape portion of the market to destroy the market and\nthereby increase its sales of branded tape, but the case law\ndoes not support liability under section 2 for this type of\naction. In Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 215, 113 S.Ct. at\n2584, Liggett/Brooke Group alleged that Brown &\nWilliamson Tobacco Corporation (“B&W”) sold generic\ncigarettes in order to decrease losses of sales in its branded\ncigarettes. B&W sold generic cigarettes at the same list\nprice as Liggett but also offered large volume rebates to\ncertain wholesalers so they would buy their generic\ncigarettes from B&W. See id. at 216, 113 S.Ct. at 2584.\nB&W wanted to take a larger part of the generic market\nfrom Liggett and drive Liggett to raise prices on generic\ncigarettes, which B&W would match, thereby encouraging\nconsumers to switch back to branded cigarettes. See id. at\n216-17, 113 S.Ct. at 2584. The Court held that because\nB&W had no reasonable prospect of recouping its predatory\nlosses and could not inflict the injury to competition that\nantitrust laws prohibit, it did not violate the Robinson-\nPatman Act or the Sherman Act. See id. at 243, 113 S.Ct.\nat 2598. In this case, however, 3M did not use below\naverage variable cost pricing (LePage’s does not charge\npredatory pricing) and therefore 3M did not have predatory\ncosts to recoup.\n\f                                 67\n\n\n   I recognize that LePage’s attempts to distinguish Brooke\nGroup on the ground that “3M used other techniques [i.e.,\ntechniques other than predatory pricing] to extinguish the\nprivate-label category subjecting itself to different legal\nstandards,” Br. of Appellee at 55, but I nevertheless cannot\naccept LePage’s’s argument on this point. While LePage’s\ndoes not contend that 3M engaged in predatory pricing, it\ndoes contend that the goal of 3M’s other conduct was “to\nextinguish the private-label category, subjecting itself to\ndifferent legal standards” than those applicable in Brooke\nGroup. See id. Moreover, though 3M denies that it was\nattempting to eliminate the private label category of\ntransparent tape, the record supports a finding that it had\nthat intent. I am satisfied, however, that its efforts to\neliminate the private label aspect of the transparent tape\nmarket are not unlawful as, “examined without reference to\nits effects on competitors,” it is evident that in view of 3M’s\ndominance in brand tape, that it was rational for it to want\nthe sale of tape to be concentrated in that category of the\nmarket. See Stearns Airport Equip. Co. v. FMC Corp., 170\nF.3d 518, 523 (5th Cir. 1999). Thus, we should not uphold\nthe verdict on that basis.\n  Accordingly, I conclude that 3M’s actions in the record,\nincluding the bundled rebates and other elements of the\n“monopoly broth,” were not anticompetitive and predatory\nas to violate section 2 of the Sherman Act.5 Thus, I would\nreverse the judgment of the district court and remand the\ncase for entry of judgment in favor of 3M. Judge Scirica and\nJudge Alito join in this opinion.\n\nA True Copy:\n        Teste:\n\n                      Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n                                  for the Third Circuit\n\n\n\n\n5. While I do not discuss the point I agree with the district court’s\ndisposition of the attempted maintenance of monopoly claim.\n\f",

Because we\nconclude that exclusionary conduct, such as the exclusive\ndealing and bundled rebates proven here, can sustain a\nverdict under § 2 against a monopolist and because we find\nno other reversible error, we will affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n                    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n  3M, which manufactures Scotch tape for home and office\nuse, dominated the United States transparent tape market\nwith a market share above 90% until the early 1990s. It\nhas conceded that it has a monopoly in that market.\nLePage’s,1 founded in 1876, has sold a variety of office\n\n1. The plaintiffs in this action are LePage’s Incorporated and LePage’s\nManagement Company, L.L.C. Inasmuch as we can discern no\ndistinction between their interests, we refer to them jointly as LePage’s.\n\f                                     4\n\n\nproducts and, around 1980, decided to sell “second brand”\nand private label transparent tape, i.e., tape sold under the\nretailer’s name rather than under the name of the\nmanufacturer. By 1992, LePage’s sold 88% of private label\ntape sales in the United States, which represented but a\nsmall portion of the transparent tape market. Private label\ntape sold at a lower price to the retailer and the customer\nthan branded tape.\n  Distribution   patterns   and     consumer    acceptance\naccounted for a shift of some tape sales from branded tape\nto private label tape. With the rapid growth of office\nsuperstores, such as Staples and Office Depot, and mass\nmerchandisers, such as Wal-Mart and Kmart, distribution\npatterns for second brand and private label tape changed\nas many of the large retailers wanted to use their “brand\nnames” to sell stationery products, including transparent\ntape. 3M also entered the private label business during the\nearly 1990s and sold its own second brand under the name\n“Highland.”\n   LePage’s claims that, in response to the growth of this\ncompetitive market, 3M engaged in a series of related,\nanticompetitive acts aimed at restricting the availability of\nlower-priced transparent tape to consumers. It also claims\nthat 3M devised programs that prevented LePage’s and the\nother domestic company in the business, Tesa Tuck, Inc.,\nfrom gaining or maintaining large volume sales and that 3M\nmaintained its monopoly by stifling growth of private label\ntape and by coordinating efforts aimed at large distributors\nto keep retail prices for Scotch tape high.2 LePage’s claims\nthat it barely was surviving at the time of trial and that it\nsuffered large operating losses from 1996 through 1999.\n  LePage’s brought this antitrust action asserting that 3M\nused its monopoly over its Scotch tape brand to gain a\ncompetitive advantage in the private label tape portion of\nthe transparent tape market in the United States through\nthe use of 3M’s multi-tiered “bundled rebate” structure,\n\n2. It appears that at least at the times material to this action, there were\nno other domestic manufacturers of transparent tape. There were,\nhowever, foreign manufacturers but they did not play a significant role\nin the domestic market and 3M does not contend otherwise.\n\f                                  5\n\n\nwhich offered higher rebates when customers purchased\nproducts in a number of 3M’s different product lines.\nLePage’s also alleges that 3M offered to some of LePage’s\ncustomers large lump-sum cash payments, promotional\nallowances and other cash incentives to encourage them to\nenter into exclusive dealing arrangements with 3M.\n   LePage’s asserted claims for unlawful agreements in\nrestraint of trade under § 1 of the Sherman Act,\nmonopolization and attempted monopolization under § 2 of\nthe Sherman Act, and exclusive dealing under § 3 of the\nClayton Act. After a nine week trial, the jury returned its\nverdict for LePage’s on both its monopolization and\nattempted monopolization claims under § 2 of the Sherman\nAct, and assessed damages of $22,828,899 on each. It\nfound in 3M’s favor on LePage’s claims under § 1 of the\nSherman Act and § 3 of the Clayton Act. 3M filed its\nmotions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial,\narguing that its rebate and discount programs and the\nother conduct of which LePage’s complained did not\nconstitute the basis for a valid antitrust claim as a matter\nof law and that, in any event, the court’s charge to the jury\nwas insufficiently specific and LePage’s damages proof was\nspeculative.3 The District Court granted 3M’s motion for\njudgment as a matter of law on LePage’s “attempted\nmaintenance of monopoly power” claim but denied 3M’s\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law in all other respects\nand denied its motion for new trial.

Id. at 570-71.\n  In this case, the parties agreed that the relevant product\nmarket is transparent tape and the relevant geographic\nmarket is the United States.4 Moreover, as to the issue of\nmonopoly power, as we noted above, 3M concedes it\npossesses monopoly power in the United States transparent\ntape market, with a 90% market share. In fact, the evidence\nshowed that the household penetration of 3M’s Scotch-\n\n4. Although 3M originally challenged LePage’s selection of the United\nStates as the relevant geographic market, the District Court held that\nLePage’s had introduced sufficient evidence from which the jury could\nproperly find that the relevant geographic market is the United States\nand 3M does not challenge that market definition on appeal.\n\f                                8\n\n\nbrand tape is virtually 100%. Therefore we need not dwell\non the oft-contested issue of market power. See Robert\nPitofsky, New Definitions of Relevant Market and the\nAssault on Antitrust, 90 Colum. L. Rev. 1805, 1807 (1990)\n(“In monopoly enforcement under section 2 of the Sherman\nAct, the pivotal inquiry is almost always whether the\nchallenged party has substantial market power in its\nrelevant market.”).\n  The sole remaining issue and our focus on this appeal is\nwhether 3M took steps to maintain that power in a manner\nthat violated § 2 of the Sherman Act. A monopolist willfully\nacquires or maintains monopoly power when it competes on\nsome basis other than the merits. See Aspen Skiing Co. v.\nAspen Highlands Skiing Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111483\"><a href=\"/opinion/111483/aspen-skiing-co-v-aspen-highlands-skiing-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 605 n.32\n(1985).\n   LePage’s argues that 3M willfully maintained its\nmonopoly in the transparent tape market through\nexclusionary conduct, primarily by bundling its rebates and\nentering into contracts that expressly or effectively required\ndealing virtually exclusively with 3M, which LePage’s\ncharacterizes as de facto exclusive. 3M does not argue that\nit did not engage in this conduct. It agrees that it offered\nbundled rebates and entered into some exclusive dealing\ncontracts, although it argues that only the few contracts\nthat are expressly exclusive may be considered as such.\nInstead, 3M argues that its conduct was legal as a matter\nof law because it never priced its transparent tape below its\ncost.5\n   This is the most significant legal issue in this case\nbecause it underlies 3M’s argument. In its brief, 3M states\n“[a]bove-cost pricing cannot give rise to an antitrust offense\nas a matter of law, since it is the very conduct that the\nantitrust laws wish to promote in the interest of making\nconsumers better off.” Appellant’s Br. at 30. For this\nproposition it relies on the Supreme Court’s decision in\nBrooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112893\"><a href=\"/opinion/112893/brooke-group-ltd-v-brown-williamson-tobacco-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 222 (1993). It is an argument 3M repeated\nfrequently during its oral argument before the en banc\n\n5. 3M states that its pricing was above its costs however costs are\ncalculated, and LePage’s has not contested 3M’s assertion.\n\f                                  9\n\n\ncourt.

This was the\ntheory upon which 3M’s counsel responded to all the\nquestions from the court. When asked whether its theory is\nthat because no one contended that 3M sold below its cost,\nthat is “the end of the story,” its counsel responded, “[w]ith\nthe exception of the inconsequential express contract,\nabsolutely.” Id.\n  It is therefore necessary for us, at the outset, to examine\nwhether we must accept 3M’s legal theory that after Brooke\nGroup, no conduct by a monopolist who sells its product\nabove cost — no matter how exclusionary the conduct —\ncan constitute monopolization in violation of § 2 of the\nSherman Act. The history of the interpretation of § 2 of the\nSherman Act demonstrates the lack of foundation for 3M’s\npremise.\n  Although § 2 of the Sherman Act may have received less\njudicial and scholarly attention than several of the other\nmore frequently invoked antitrust provisions, the Supreme\nCourt, in a series of decisions, has made clear the type of\nconduct that will be held to constitute monopolization in\nviolation of § 2.\n  The modern era begins with the decision by Judge\nLearned Hand in United States v. Aluminum Co. of America,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1503668\"><a href=\"/opinion/1503668/united-states-v-aluminum-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">416</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1945) (“Alcoa”). Because four\nmembers of the Supreme Court were disqualified, the\nSupreme Court was required to apply the provision of the\nExpediting Act, Section 29 of Title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed.,\ncurrently 28 U.S.C. § 2109, to certify the case to the three\nmost senior judges of the relevant circuit.6 Under the\nstatute, the decision of that court was “final and\nconclusive,” thus equating it to a decision of the Supreme\nCourt.\n  At the time in question, Alcoa was the sole domestic\nproducer of aluminum and thus had a monopoly that the\n\n6. The three most senior judges of the circuit were, fortuitously, the\nlegendary panel of Judges Learned Hand, Thomas Swan, and Augustus\nHand.\n\f                             10\n\n\nGovernment sought to disband. In the opinion on liability,\nthe court enunciated certain principles that remain fully\napplicable today. One such principle is that it does not\nfollow that a company that has a monopoly has\n“monopolized” the market because “it may not have\nachieved monopoly; monopoly may have been thrust upon\nit.” Id. at 429. As the court explained, “persons may\nunwittingly find themselves in possession of a monopoly,\nautomatically so to say: that is, without having intended\neither to put an end to existing competition, or to prevent\ncompetition from arising when none had existed; they may\nbecome monopolists by force of accident.” Id. at 429-30. On\nthe other hand, the court then quoted Justice Cardozo’s\nstatement in United States v. Swift & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101912\"><a href=\"/opinion/101912/united-states-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n116 (1932), that “size carries with it an opportunity for\nabuse that is not to be ignored when the opportunity is\nproved to have been utilized in the past.” Alcoa, 148 F.2d\nat 430.\n   The court determined that Alcoa, which controlled over\n90% of the aluminum market, had utilized its size for\nabuse. The court, noting that there had been at least “one\nor two abortive attempts” by others to enter the industry,\nconcluded that Alcoa “effectively anticipated and forestalled\nall competition, and succeeded in holding the field alone.”\nId. at 430. Finding Alcoa in violation of § 2, the court\ncontinued:\n    Nothing compelled it to keep doubling and redoubling\n    its capacity before others entered the field. It insists\n    that it never excluded competitors; but we can think of\n    no more effective exclusion than progressively to\n    embrace each new opportunity as it opened, and to\n    face every newcomer with new capacity already geared\n    into a great organization, having the advantage of\n    experience, trade connections and the elite of\n    personnel.\nId. at 431.\n  One year later, in American Tobacco Co. v. United States,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104322\"><a href=\"/opinion/104322/american-tobacco-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1946), the Supreme Court endorsed the\nAlcoa decision when upholding a jury verdict finding a § 2\nviolation. The government brought a criminal action against\n\f                              11\n\n\nvarious tobacco companies that between 1931 and 1939\naccounted at all times for more than 68%, and usually for\nmore than 75%, of the nation’s domestic cigarette\nproduction. Defendants were convicted and fined after the\njury found they had violated §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act\nby conspiring to control the price of leaf tobacco, to acquire\nless expensive supplies of tobacco they did not need in\norder to deprive rival manufacturers of cheaper brands, to\ncontrol cigarette prices, and to force cigarette distributors\nto treat rival brands less favorably.\n   The court of appeals affirmed, finding the verdicts to be\nsupported by sufficient evidence. The Supreme Court\ngranted the tobacco companies’ petitions for certiorari only\nas to their § 2 claims, seeking to answer the specific\nquestion “whether actual exclusion of competitors is\nnecessary to the crime of monopolization under § 2 of the\nSherman Act.” Id. at 784. Answering that question in the\nnegative, the Court stated that “[n]either proof of exertion of\nthe power to exclude nor proof of actual exclusion of\nexisting or potential competitors is essential to sustain a\ncharge of monopolization under the Sherman Act.” Id. at\n810. Furthermore, and importantly, the Court explicitly\n“welcome[d] this opportunity to endorse” certain passages\nfrom Judge Hand’s opinion. Id. at 813.\n    Of particular relevance, the American Tobacco Court\nendorsed Judge Hand’s understanding of the Sherman Act,\nnamely that the Act contemplated the notion that\n“ ‘unchallenged economic power deadens initiative’ ” and\n“ ‘that immunity from competition is a narcotic, and rivalry\nis a stimulant, to industrial progress.’ ” Id. (quoting Alcoa,\n148 F.2d at 427). It further quoted Alcoa for the previously\nmentioned propositions that monopolies can be “thrust”\nupon entities rather than achieved and that specific intent\nunder § 2 was not required “ ‘for no monopolist monopolizes\nunconscious of what he is doing.’ ” Id. at 813-14 (quoting\nAlcoa, 148 F.2d at 432).\n  Section 2 of the Sherman Act was next considered by the\nSupreme Court in Lorain Journal Co. v.

The\nSupreme Court held that although a trader has discretion\nas to the parties with whom he will deal “[i]n the absence\nof any purpose to create or maintain a monopoly,” id. at\n155 (quoting United States v.

The Court\nsummarized its prior cases, stating that § 2 of the Sherman\nAct required two elements: “(1) the possession of monopoly\npower in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition\nor maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth\nor development as a consequence of a superior product,\nbusiness acumen, or historic accident.” 384 U.S. at 570-71.\n   In Grinnell, the United States filed a civil suit against\nseveral companies that offered central station protective\nservices, such as fire and burglary protective devices,\nalleging violations of §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.\nReferring to the two-pronged test under § 2, the Court\nfound that both prongs had been satisfied. Not only did the\ncompanies have monopoly power (87% of the accredited\ncentral station service business), but also they largely\nachieved this power through the aid of pricing practices,\nacquisitions of competitors, and noncompetition covenants,\nall of which were deemed to be “unlawful and exclusionary\npractices.” Id. at 576.\n  The Court’s later decision in Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen\nHighlands Skiing Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111483\"><a href=\"/opinion/111483/aspen-skiing-co-v-aspen-highlands-skiing-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985), is even more\npertinent to the case before us. In Aspen Skiing, a case that\nalso reached the Court only on the § 2 violation, Ski Co.,\nthe owner of three of the four major downhill skiing\n\f                              13\n\n\nfacilities in Aspen, Colorado, discontinued its prior practice\nof cooperating with the owner of the fourth facility by\nissuing an interchangeable 6-day pass that could be used\non any of the four facilities. It replaced that pass with a 3-\narea, 6-day ticket featuring only its mountains. It offered\nthe plaintiff, Highlands, owner of the fourth facility,\nreinstatement of the 4-area ticket only if Highlands would\naccept a fixed percentage of the revenue that was\nconsiderably below Highlands’ historical average based on\nusage. Ski Co. took additional actions that made it\nextremely difficult for Highlands to market its own\nmultiarea package to replace the joint offering, and\nHighlands’ share of the market declined along with its\nrevenues from associated skiing services. The jury found\nthat Ski Co. possessed monopoly power and awarded\nHighlands a substantial money judgment as treble\ndamages. The court of appeals affirmed, holding there was\nsufficient basis in Ski Co.’s actions to demonstrate an\nabuse of its monopoly power.\n   In the Supreme Court, Ski Co. argued “that even a firm\nwith monopoly power has no duty to engage in joint\nmarketing with a competitor, that a violation of § 2 cannot\nbe established without evidence of substantial exclusionary\nconduct, and that none of its activities can be characterized\nas exclusionary.” Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. at 600. The\nSupreme Court agreed with the legal proposition, but\nreferred to its earlier opinion in Lorain Journal where it held\nthat a monopolist’s right to refuse to deal was not\nunqualified. Id. at 600-01. After reviewing all the\ncircumstances, it affirmed the judgment for Highlands in a\nunanimous opinion. It held that the jury had ample basis\nto reject Ski Co.’s business justification defense and noted\nthat Ski Co. failed to offer any efficiency justification\nwhatever for its pattern of conduct. Id. at 608. The Court\nstated, “[a]lthough Ski Co.’s pattern of conduct may not\nhave been as ‘bold, relentless, and predatory’ as the\npublisher’s actions in Lorain Journal, the record in this case\ncomfortably supports an inference that the monopolist\nmade a deliberate effort to discourage its customers from\ndoing business with its smaller rival.” Id. at 610 (quoting\nLorain Journal, 342 U.S. at 149 (citation omitted)).\n\f                             14\n\n\n   In a significant passage about the conduct that\nconstitutes monopolization in violation of § 2, the Court\nstated that when the issue is monopolization rather than\nan attempt to monopolize, “evidence of intent is merely\nrelevant to the question whether the challenged conduct is\nfairly characterized as ‘exclusionary’ or ‘anticompetitive’ —\nto use the words in the trial court’s instructions — or\n‘predatory,’ to use a word that scholars seem to favor.” Id.\nat 602. The Court continued, “[w]hichever label is used,\nthere is agreement on the proposition that ‘no monopolist\nmonopolizes unconscious of what he is doing.’ ” Id.

They alleged Kodak’s policies were unlawful under\nboth §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The Supreme Court\nconsidered the issues under the two provisions separately.\nIn its analysis under § 2, the Court first held that Kodak’s\ncontrol of nearly 100% of the parts market and 80% to 95%\nof the service market was sufficient to support a claim of\nmonopoly power (an issue that is conceded here). As to the\nissue whether Kodak adopted its parts and service policies\nas part of a scheme of willful acquisition or maintenance of\nmonopoly power, the Court stated that there was evidence\nthat Kodak “took exclusionary action to maintain its parts\nmonopoly and used its control over parts to strengthen its\nmonopoly share of the Kodak service market.” Id. at 483.\nThus, Kodak could escape liability under § 2 only if it could\nexplain its actions on the basis of valid business reasons,\nan issue as to which there were factual questions which\nmade the district court’s grant of summary judgment for\nKodak inappropriate. Id.\n  This extensive review of the Supreme Court’s § 2\ndecisions is set forth to provide the background under\nwhich we must evaluate 3M’s contention that it was\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law on the basis of the\ndecision in Brooke Group Ltd. v.

In Brooke Group, Liggett, a cigarette\nmanufacturer responsible for the “innovative development”\nof generic cigarettes, claimed that Brown & Williamson,\nwhich introduced its own line of generic cigarettes, “cut\nprices on generic cigarettes below cost and offered\ndiscriminatory volume rebates to wholesalers to force\nLiggett to raise its own generic cigarette prices and\nintroduce oligopoly pricing in the economy segment [of the\nnational cigarette market].” Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 212.\nIt filed a Robinson-Patman action on the basis of these\nallegations. Brown & Williamson’s deep price discounts or\nrebates were concededly discriminatory, not cost justified,\nand resulted in substantial loss to it. The Supreme Court\nmajority held that the defendant was entitled to judgment\nas a matter of law because there was no evidence of injury\nto competition. Id. at 243. The Court also held that the\nevidence did not show that Brown & Williamson’s alleged\nscheme “was likely to result in oligopolistic price\ncoordination and sustained supracompetitive pricing in the\ngeneric segment of the national cigarette market. Without\nthis, Brown & Williamson had no reasonable prospect of\nrecouping its predatory losses and could not inflict the\ninjury to competition the antitrust laws prohibit.” Id.7\n   Unlike 3M, Brown & Williamson was part of an oligopoly,\nsix manufacturers whose prices for cigarettes “increased in\nlockstep” and who “reaped the benefits of prices above a\ncompetitive level.” Id. at 213. Brown & Williamson had 12%\nof the oligopolistic market. Its conduct and pricing were at\nall times necessarily constrained by the presence of\ncompetitors who could, and did, react to its conduct by\nundertaking similar price cuts or pricing behavior.8\n\n7. In contrast, the District Court here noted that 3M had conceded that\nit “ ‘could later recoup the profits it has forsaken on Scotch tape and\nprivate label tape by selling more higher priced Scotch tape . . . if there\nwould be no competition by others in the private label tape segment\nwhen 3M abandoned that part of the market to sell only higher-priced\nScotch tape.’ ” Le Page’s, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">280350</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (quoting Defendant’s\nMem. at 30).\n8. The Brooke Group opinions, both for the majority and the dissent,\ndiscuss the responses by members of the oligopoly to the introduction of\ndiscounted cigarettes. Id. at 239-40; id. at 247-48 (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting).\n\f                                  16\n\n\n  Assuming arguendo that Brooke Group should be read for\nthe proposition that a company’s pricing action is legal if its\nprices are not below its costs, nothing in the decision\nsuggests that its discussion of the issue is applicable to a\nmonopolist with its unconstrained market power. Moreover,\nLePage’s, unlike the plaintiff in Brooke Group, does not\nmake a predatory pricing claim. 3M is a monopolist; a\nmonopolist is not free to take certain actions that a\ncompany in a competitive (or even oligopolistic) market may\ntake, because there is no market constraint on a\nmonopolist’s behavior. See, e.g., Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. at\n601-04.\n   Nothing in any of the Supreme Court’s opinions in the\ndecade since the Brooke Group decision suggested that the\nopinion overturned decades of Supreme Court precedent\nthat evaluated a monopolist’s liability under § 2 by\nexamining its exclusionary, i.e., predatory, conduct.

That court upheld the jury’s award to plaintiff\nConwood of $350 million, which trebled was $1.05 billion,\nagainst United States Tobacco Company (“USTC”) because\nof USTC’s monopolization. USTC was the sole manufacturer\nof moist snuff until the 1970’s when Conwood, Swisher,\nand Swedish Match, other moist snuff manufacturers,\nentered the moist snuff market. Not unexpectedly, USTC’s\n100% market share declined and it took the action that\nformed the basis of Conwood’s complaint against USTC\n\f                             19\n\n\nalleging, inter alia, unlawful monopolization in violation of\n§ 2 of the Sherman Act.\n  The evidence that the district court and the court of\nappeals held proved that USTC systematically tried to\nexclude competition from the moist snuff market included\nthe following: USTC (1) removed and destroyed or discarded\nracks that displayed moist snuff products in the stores\nwhile placing Conwood products in USTC racks in an\nattempt to bury Conwood’s products; (2) trained its\n“operatives to take advantage of inattentive store clerks\nwith various ‘ruses’ such as obtaining nominal permission\nto reorganize or neaten the moist snuff section” in an effort\nto destroy Conwood racks; (3) misused its position as\ncategory manager (manages product groups and business\nunits and customizes them on a store by store basis) by\nproviding misleading information to retailers in an effort to\ndupe them into carrying USTC products and to discontinue\ncarrying Conwood products; and (4) entered into exclusive\nagreements with retailers in an effort to exclude rivals’\nproducts. Id. at 783.\n   On appeal, USTC — like 3M — did not challenge that it\nhad monopoly power and agreed that the relevant product\nwas moist snuff and the geographic market was nationwide.\nId. at 782-83. Instead, USTC contended that Conwood had\nfailed to establish that USTC’s power was acquired or\nmaintained by exclusionary practices rather than by its\nlegitimate business practices and superior product. Id. at\n783. Both the district court and the court of appeals\nrejected USTC’s argument, finding that there was sufficient\nevidence for a jury to find willful maintenance by USTC of\nmonopoly power by engaging in exclusionary practices in\nviolation of § 2 of the Sherman Act. Id. at 788.\n   Similarly, 3M sought to meet the competition that\nLePage’s threatened by exclusionary conduct that consisted\nof rebate programs and exclusive dealing arrangements\ndesigned to drive LePage’s and any other viable competitor\nfrom the transparent tape market.\n\f                             20\n\n\n                             B.\n\n                     Bundled Rebates\n  In considering LePage’s conduct that led to the jury’s\nultimate verdict, we note that the jury had before it\nevidence of the full panoply of 3M’s exclusionary conduct,\nincluding both the exclusive dealing arrangements and the\nbundled rebates which could reasonably have been viewed\nas effectuating exclusive dealing arrangements because of\nthe way in which they were structured.\n   Through a program denominated Executive Growth Fund\n(“EGF ”) and thereafter Partnership Growth Fund (“PGF ”),\n3M offered many of LePage’s major customers substantial\nrebates to induce them to eliminate or reduce their\npurchases of tape from LePage’s. Rather than competing by\noffering volume discounts which are concededly legal and\noften reflect cost savings, 3M’s rebate programs offered\ndiscounts to certain customers conditioned on purchases\nspanning six of 3M’s diverse product lines. The product\nlines covered by the rebate program were: Health Care\nProducts, Home Care Products, Home Improvement\nProducts, Stationery Products (including transparent tape),\nRetail Auto Products, and Leisure Time. Sealed App. at\n2979. In addition to bundling the rebates, both of 3M’s\nrebate programs set customer-specific target growth rates\nin each product line. The size of the rebate was linked to\nthe number of product lines in which targets were met, and\nthe number of targets met by the buyer determined the\nrebate it would receive on all of its purchases. If a customer\nfailed to meet the target for any one product, its failure\nwould cause it to lose the rebate across the line. This\ncreated a substantial incentive for each customer to meet\nthe targets across all product lines to maximize its rebates.\n  The rebates were considerable, not “modest” as 3M\nstates. Appellant’s Br. at 15. For example, Kmart, which\nhad constituted 10% of LePage’s business, received\n$926,287 in 1997, Sealed App. at 2980, and in 1996 Wal-\nMart received more than $1.5 million, Sam’s Club received\n$666,620, and Target received $482,001. Sealed App. at\n2773. Just as significant as the amounts received is the\n\f                              21\n\n\npowerful incentive they provided to customers to purchase\n3M tape rather than LePage’s in order not to forego the\nmaximum rebate 3M offered. The penalty would have been\n$264,000 for Sam’s Club, $450,000 for Kmart, and\n$200,000 to $310,000 for American Stores.\n  3M does not deny that it offered these programs although\nit gives different reasons for the discounts to each\ncustomer. Instead it argues that they were no more\nexclusive than procompetitive lawful discount programs.\nAnd, as it responds to each of LePage’s allegations, it\nreturns to its central premise “that it is not unlawful to\nlower one’s prices so long as they remain above cost.”\nAppellant’s Br. at 36 (citing Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 222).\n  However, one of the leading treatises discussing the\ninherent anticompetitive effect of bundled rebates, even if\nthey are priced above cost, notes that “the great majority of\nbundled rebate programs yield aggregate prices above cost.\nRather than analogizing them to predatory pricing, they are\nbest compared with tying, whose foreclosure effects are\nsimilar. Indeed, the ‘package discount’ is often a close\nanalogy.” Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust\nLaw ¶ 794, at 83 (Supp. 2002).\n   The treatise then discusses the anticompetitive effect as\nfollows:\n      The anticompetitive feature of package discounting is\n      the strong incentive it gives buyers to take increasing\n      amounts or even all of a product in order to take\n      advantage of a discount aggregated across multiple\n      products. In the anticompetitive case, which we\n      presume is in the minority, the defendant rewards the\n      customer for buying its product B rather than the\n      plaintiff ’s B, not because defendant’s B is better or\n      even cheaper. Rather, the customer buys the\n      defendant’s B in order to receive a greater discount on\n      A, which the plaintiff does not produce. In that case\n      the rival can compete in B only by giving the customer\n      a price that compensates it for the foregone A discount.\nId.\n  The authors then conclude:\n\f                              22\n\n\n    Depending on       the number of products that are\n    aggregated and     the customer’s relative purchases of\n    each, even an       equally efficient rival may find it\n    impossible to      compensate for lost discounts on\n    products that it   does not produce.\nId. at 83-84.\n   The principal anticompetitive effect of bundled rebates as\noffered by 3M is that when offered by a monopolist they\nmay foreclose portions of the market to a potential\ncompetitor who does not manufacture an equally diverse\ngroup of products and who therefore cannot make a\ncomparable offer. We recognized this in our decision in\nSmithKline Corp. v. Eli Lilly & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"355677\"><a href=\"/opinion/355677/smithkline-corporation-v-eli-lilly-and-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1056</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir.\n1978), where we held that conduct substantially identical to\n3M’s was anticompetitive and sustained the finding of a\nviolation of § 2. SmithKline is of interest not because the\npanel decision is binding on the en banc court but because\nthe reasoning regarding the practice of bundled rebates is\nequally applicable here. The defendant in SmithKline, Eli\nLilly & Company, the pharmaceutical manufacturer, sold\nthree of its cephalosporins to hospitals under the trade\nnames Kefzol, Keflin and Keflex. Cephalosporins are broad\nspectrum antibiotics that were at that time indispensable to\nhospital pharmacies. Lilly had a monopoly on both Keflin\nand Keflex because of its patents. However, those drugs\nfaced competition from the generic drug cefazolin which\nLilly sold under the trade name Kefzol and which plaintiff\nSmithKline sold under the trade name Ancef.\n   Lilly’s profits on the patented Keflin were far higher than\nthose it received from its sales of Kefzol where its pricing\nwas constrained by the existence of SmithKline. To preserve\nits market position in Keflin and discourage sales of Ancef\nand even of its own Kefzol, id. at 1061, Lilly instituted a\nrebate program that provided a 3% bonus rebate for\nhospitals that purchased specified quantities of any three of\nLilly’s five cephalosporins. SmithKline brought a § 2\nmonopolization claim, alleging that Lilly used these multi-\nline volume rebates to maintain its monopoly over the\nhospital market for cephalosporins.\n The district court (Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, later a\nmember of this court) found that Lilly’s pricing policy\n\f                              23\n\n\nviolated § 2. SmithKline Corp. v. Eli Lilly & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1482339\"><a href=\"/opinion/1482339/smithkline-corp-v-eli-lilly-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1089</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (E.D. Pa. 1976). We affirmed by a unanimous\ndecision. Although customers were not forced to select\nwhich cephalosporins they purchased from Lilly, we\nrecognized that the effect of the rebate program was to\ninduce hospitals to conjoin their purchases of Kefzol with\nKeflin and Keflex, Lilly’s “leading sellers.” SmithKline, 575\nF.2d at 1061. As we stated, “[a]lthough eligibility for the 3%\nbonus rebate was based on the purchase of specified\nquantities of any three of Lilly’s cephalosporins, in reality it\nmeant the combined purchases of Kefzol and the leading\nsellers, Keflin and Keflex.” Id. The gravamen of Lilly’s § 2\nviolation was that Lilly linked a product on which it faced\ncompetition with products on which it faced no\ncompetition. Id. at 1065.\n  The effect of the 3% bundled rebate was magnified by the\nvolume of Lilly products sold, so that “in order to offer a\nrebate of the same net dollar amount as Lilly’s, SmithKline\nhad to offer purchasers of Ancef rebates of some 16% to\nhospitals of average size, and 35% to larger volume\nhospitals.” Id. at 1062. Lilly’s rebate structure combining\nKefzol with Keflin and Keflex “insulat[ed] Kefzol from true\nprice competition with [its competitor] Ancef.” Id. at 1065.\n  LePage’s private-label and second-tier tapes are, as Kefzol\nand Ancef were in relation to Keflin, less expensive but\notherwise of similar quality to Scotch-brand tape. Indeed,\nbefore 3M instituted its rebate program, LePage’s had\nbegun to enjoy a small but rapidly expanding toehold in the\ntransparent tape market. 3M’s incentive was thus the same\nas Lilly’s in SmithKline: to preserve the market position of\nScotch-brand tape by discouraging widespread acceptance\nof the cheaper, but substantially similar, tape produced by\nLePage’s.\n   3M bundled its rebates for Scotch-brand tape with other\nproducts it sold in much the same way that Lilly bundled\nits rebates for Kefzol with Keflin and Keflex. In both cases,\nthe bundled rebates reflected an exploitation of the seller’s\nmonopoly power. Just as “[cephalosporins] [were] carried in\n. . . virtually every general hospital in the country,”\nSmithKline, 575 F.2d at 1062, the evidence in this case\n\f                             24\n\n\nshows that Scotch-brand tape is indispensable to any\nretailer in the transparent tape market.\n  Our analysis of § 2 of the Sherman Act in SmithKline is\ninstructive here where the facts are comparable. Speaking\nthrough Judge Aldisert, we said:\n      With Lilly’s cephalosporins subject to no serious\n    price competition from other sellers, with the barriers\n    to entering the market substantial, and with the\n    prospects of new competition extremely uncertain, we\n    are confronted with a factual complex in which Lilly\n    has the awesome power of a monopolist. Although it\n    enjoyed the status of a legal monopolist when it was\n    engaged in the manufacture and sale of its original\n    patented products, that status changed when it\n    instituted its [bundled rebate program]. The goal of\n    that plan was to associate Lilly’s legal monopolistic\n    practices with an illegal activity that directly affected\n    the price, supply, and demand of Kefzol and Ancef.\n    Were it not for the [bundled rebate program], the price,\n    supply, and demand of Kefzol and Ancef would have\n    been determined by the economic laws of a competitive\n    market. [Lilly’s bundled rebate program] blatantly\n    revised those economic laws and made Lilly a\n    transgressor under § 2 of the Sherman Act.\nId. at 1065.\n  The effect of 3M’s rebates were even more powerfully\nmagnified than those in SmithKline because 3M’s rebates\nrequired purchases bridging 3M’s extensive product lines.\nIn some cases, these magnified rebates to a particular\ncustomer were as much as half of LePage’s entire prior tape\nsales to that customer. For example, LePage’s sales to\nSam’s Club in 1993 totaled $1,078,484, while 3M’s 1996\nrebate to Sam’s Club was $666,620. Similarly, LePage’s\n1992 sales to Kmart were $2,482,756; 3M’s 1997 rebate to\nKmart was $926,287. The jury could reasonably find that\n3M used its monopoly in transparent tape, backed by its\nconsiderable catalog of products, to squeeze out LePage’s.\n3M’s conduct was at least as anticompetitive as the\nconduct which this court held violated § 2 in SmithKline.\n\f                                   25\n\n\n                                   C.\n\n                         Exclusive Dealing\n  The second prong of LePage’s claim of exclusionary\nconduct by 3M was its actions in entering into exclusive\ndealing contracts with large customers. 3M acknowledges\nonly the expressly exclusive dealing contracts with Venture\nand Pamida which conditioned discounts on exclusivity. It\nminimizes these because they represent only a small\nportion of the market. However, LePage’s claims that 3M\nmade payments to many of the larger customers that were\ndesigned to achieve sole-source supplier status.\n  3M argues that because the jury found for it on LePage’s\nclaims under § 1 of the Sherman Act and § 3 of the Clayton\nAct, these payments should not be relevant to the § 2\nanalysis. The law is to the contrary.10 Even though\nexclusivity arrangements are often analyzed under § 1, such\nexclusionary conduct may also be an element in a § 2\nclaim. U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v.

In that case, the FTC had appealed from a\ndecision of the Fifth Circuit holding that exclusive contracts are not\nunfair methods of competition. The Supreme Court reversed, supporting\nthe FTC’s decision that the exclusive contracts of the respondent (a\nproducer and distributor of advertising motion pictures), unreasonably\nrestrain competition and tend to monopoly. It was the respondent who\nargued that exclusive contracts of a duration in excess of a year are\nnecessary for the conduct of the business of the distributors. This\nargument was rejected by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court’s\ndecision did not suggest that exclusive dealing arrangements entered\ninto by a monopolist (which the respondent in that case was not),\ntogether with other exclusionary action, did not violate § 2 of the\nSherman Act.\n12. At trial, LePage’s presented the testimony of James Kowieski, its\nformer senior vice president of sales, who described LePage’s efforts\nfollowing Kmart’s rejection of its bid. LePage’s made a desperate second\nsales presentation attended by its president, App. at 957 (“I felt it was\nvery critical to our company’s success or failure, so I insured that Mr.\nLes Baggett, our president, attended the meeting with me.”), where\nLePage’s vainly offered additional price concessions, App. at 959 (“We\nwent through the cost savings, the benefits, and we came up with some,\nagain, price concessions, and some programs of a special buy once a\nyear, because, I mean, as far as we were concerned, we were on our last\nleg.”).\n\f                               27\n\n\nevent, the purpose and effect of 3M’s payments to the\nretailers were issues for the jury which, by its verdict,\nrejected 3M’s arguments.\n  The foreclosure of markets through exclusive dealing\ncontracts is of concern under the antitrust laws. As one of\nthe leading treatises states:\n    unilaterally imposed quantity discounts can foreclose\n    the opportunities of rivals when a dealer can obtain its\n    best discount only by dealing exclusively with the\n    dominant firm. For example, discounts might be\n    cumulated over lengthy periods of time, such as a\n    calendar year, when no obvious economies result.\n3A Phillip E.

In that case, the court of\nappeals concluded that Microsoft, a monopolist in the\noperating system market, foreclosed rivals in the browser\nmarket from a “substantial percentage of the available\nopportunities for browser distribution” through the use of\nexclusive contracts with key distributors. Id. at 70-71.\nMicrosoft kept usage of its competitor’s browser below “the\ncritical level necessary for [its rival] to pose a real threat to\nMicrosoft’s monopoly.” Id. at 71. The Microsoft opinion does\nnot specify what percentage of the browser market\nMicrosoft locked up — merely that, in one of the two\nprimary distribution channels for browsers, Microsoft had\nexclusive arrangements with most of the top distributors.\nId. at 70-71. Significantly, the Microsoft court observed that\nMicrosoft’s exclusionary conduct violated § 2 “even though\nthe contracts foreclose less than the roughly 40% or 50%\n\f                             28\n\n\nshare usually required in order to establish a § 1 violation.”\nId. at 70.\n  One noted antitrust scholar has written:\n      We might thus interpret the Microsoft holding as\n    follows: Conduct that intentionally, significantly, and\n    without business justification excludes a potential\n    competitor from outlets (even though not in the\n    relevant market), where access to those outlets is a\n    necessary though not sufficient condition to waging a\n    challenge to a monopolist and fear of the challenge\n    prompts the conduct, is “anticompetitive.”\nEleanor M. Fox, What Is Harm to Competition? Exclusionary\nPractices and Anticompetitive Effect, 70 Antitrust L. J. 371,\n390 (2002).\n   LePage’s produced evidence that the foreclosure caused\nby exclusive dealing practices was magnified by 3M’s\ndiscount practices, as some of 3M’s rebates were “all-or-\nnothing” discounts, leading customers to maximize their\ndiscounts by dealing exclusively with the dominant market\nplayer, 3M, to avoid being severely penalized financially for\nfailing to meet their quota in a single product line. Only by\ndealing exclusively with 3M in as many product lines as\npossible could customers enjoy the substantial discounts.\nAccordingly, the jury could reasonably find that 3M’s\nexclusionary conduct violated § 2.\n\n                             V.\n\n               ANTICOMPETITIVE EFFECT\n  It has been LePage’s position in pursuing its § 2 claim\nthat 3M’s exclusionary “tactics foreclosed the competitive\nprocess by preventing rivals from competing to gain (or\nmaintain) a presence in the market.” Appellee’s Br. at 45-\n46. When a monopolist’s actions are designed to prevent\none or more new or potential competitors from gaining a\nfoothold in the market by exclusionary, i.e. predatory,\nconduct, its success in that goal is not only injurious to the\npotential competitor but also to competition in general.

Tr. Vol. 30 at 105-106; Vol. 27 at 30. Under\n    3M’s rebate programs, 3M set overall growth targets for\n    unrelated product lines. In the distributors’ view, 3M\n    set these targets in a manner which forced the\n    distributor to either drop any non-Scotch products, or\n    lose the maximum rebate. PX 24 at 3M 48136. Thus, in\n    order to qualify for the maximum rebate under the\n    EGF/PGF programs, the record shows that most\n    customers diverted private label business to 3M at\n    3M’s suggestion. Tr. Vol. 28 at 74-75; PX23, 28, 32,\n    34, 715. Similarly, under the newer Brand Mix rebate\n    program, 3M set higher rebates for tape sales which\n    produced a shift from private label tape to branded\n    tape. Tr. Vol. 31 at 79. PX 393 at 534906.\n      Furthermore,     Plaintiff introduced   evidence    of\n    customized rebate programs that similarly caused\n    distributors to forego purchasing from Le Page’s if they\n    wished to obtain rebates on 3M’s products. Specifically,\n    the trial record establishes that 3M offered Kmart a\n    customized growth rebate and Market Development\n    Funds payment. In order to reach the $15 million sales\n    target and qualify for the $1 million rebate, however,\n    Kmart had to increase its consumer stationary\n    purchases by $5.5 million. Kmart substantially\n    achieved this “growth” by dropping Le Page’s and\n    another private label manufacturer, Tesa. PX 51 at 3M\n    102175, PX 121 at 156838. Likewise, 3M customized a\n    program with Staples that provided for an extra 1%\n    bonus rebate on Scotch tape sales “if Le Page’s\n    business is given to 3M.” PX 98 at 3M 149794. Finally,\n    3M provided a similar discount on Scotch tape to\n    Venture Stores “based on the contingency of Venture\n    dropping private label.” PX 712 at 3M 450738. Thus,\n    the jury could have reasonably concluded that 3M’s\n\f                             31\n\n\n    customers were forced to forego purchasing Le Page’s\n    private label tape in order to obtain the rebates on\n    Scotch tape.\nId. (emphasis added).\n   In the same opinion, the District Court found that\n“[LePage’s] introduced substantial evidence that the anti-\ncompetitive effects of 3M’s rebate programs caused Le\nPage’s losses.” Id. at *7. The jury was capable of calculating\nfrom the evidence the amount of rebate a customer of 3M\nwould lose if it failed to meet 3M’s quota of sales in even\none of the bundled products. The discount that LePage’s\nwould have had to provide to match the discounts offered\nby 3M through its bundled rebates can be measured by the\ndiscounts 3M gave or offered. For example, LePage’s points\nout that in 1993 Sam’s Club would have stood to lose\n$264,900, Sealed App. at 1166, and Kmart $450,000 for\nfailure to meet one of 3M’s growth targets in a single\nproduct line. Sealed App. at 1110. Moreover, the effect of\n3M’s rebates on LePage’s earnings, if LePage’s had\nattempted to match 3M’s discounts, can be calculated by\ncomparing the discount that LePage’s would have been\nrequired to provide. That amount would represent the\nimpact of 3M’s bundled rebates on LePage’s ability to\ncompete, and that is what is relevant under § 2 of the\nSherman Act.\n   The impact of 3M’s discounts was apparent from the\nchart introduced by LePage’s showing that LePage’s\nearnings as a percentage of sales plummeted to below zero\n—to negative 10%—during 3M’s rebate program. App. at\n7037; see also App. at 7044 (documenting LePage’s healthy\noperating income from 1990 to 1993, rapidly declining\noperating income from 1993 to 1995, and large operating\nlosses suffered from 1996 through 1999). Demand for\nLePage’s tape, especially its private-label tape, decreased\nsignificantly following the introduction of 3M’s rebates.\n Although 3M claims that customers participating in its\nrebate programs continued to purchase tape from LePage’s,\nthe evidence does not support this contention. Many\ndistributors dropped LePage’s entirely.\n  Prior to the introduction of 3M’s rebate program, LePage’s\n\f                                   32\n\n\nsales had been skyrocketing. Its sales to Staples increased\nby 440% from 1990 to 1993. Following the introduction of\n3M’s rebate program which bundled its private-label tape\nwith its other products, 3M’s private-label tape sales\nincreased 478% from 1992 to 1997.15 LePage’s in turn lost\na proportional amount of sales. It lost key large volume\ncustomers, such as Kmart, Staples, American Drugstores,\nOffice Max, and Sam’s Club. Other large customers, like\nWal-Mart, drastically cut back their purchases.\n   As a result, LePage’s manufacturing process became less\nefficient and its profit margins declined. In transparent tape\nmanufacturing, large volume customers are essential to\nachieving efficiencies of scale. As 3M concedes, “ ‘large\ncustomers were extremely important to [LePage’s], to\neveryone.’ . . . Large volumes . . . permitted ‘long runs,’\nmaking the manufacturing process more economical and\npredictable.” Appellant Br. at 10 (quoting trial testimony of\nLes Baggett, LePage’s former president and CEO) (citation\nomitted).\n   There was a comparable effect on LePage’s share of the\ntransparent tape market. In the agreed upon relevant\nmarket for transparent tape in the United States, LePage’s\nmarket share dropped 35% from 1992 to 1997. In 1992,\nLePage’s net sales constituted 14.44% of the total\ntransparent tape market. By 1997, LePage’s sales had\nfallen to 9.35%. Sealed App. at 489. Finally, in March of\n1997, LePage’s was forced to close one of its two plants.\nThat same year, the only other domestic transparent tape\nmanufacturer, Tesa Tuck, Inc., bowed out of the\ntransparent tape business entirely in the United States.\nHad 3M continued with its program it could have\neventually forced LePage’s out of the market.\n  The relevant inquiry is the anticompetitive effect of 3M’s\nexclusionary practices considered together.

This court, when considering the\nanticompetitive effect of a defendant’s conduct under the\nSherman Act, has looked to the increase in the defendant’s\nmarket share, the effects of foreclosure on the market,\nbenefits to customers and the defendant, and the extent to\nwhich customers felt they were precluded from dealing with\nother manufacturers. Barr, 978 F.2d at 110-11.\n   The effect of 3M’s conduct in strengthening its monopoly\nposition by destroying competition by LePage’s in second-\ntier tape is most apparent when 3M’s various activities are\nconsidered as a whole. The anticompetitive effect of 3M’s\nexclusive dealing arrangements, whether explicit or\ninferred, cannot be separated from the effect of its bundled\nrebates. 3M’s bundling of its products via its rebate\nprograms reinforced the exclusionary effect of those\nprograms.\n  3M’s exclusionary conduct not only impeded LePage’s\nability to compete, but also it harmed competition itself, a\nsine qua non for a § 2 violation.

In the time period at issue here,\nthere has never been a competitor that has genuinely\nchallenged 3M’s monopoly and it never lost a significant\ntransparent tape account to a foreign competitor.\n  There was evidence from which the jury could have\ndetermined that 3M intended to force LePage’s from the\nmarket, and then cease or severely curtail its own private-\nlabel and second-tier tape lines. For example, by 1996, 3M\nhad begun to offer incentives to some customers to increase\npurchases of its higher priced Scotch-brand tapes over its\nown second-tier brand. The Supreme Court has made clear\nthat intent is relevant to proving monopolization, Aspen\nSkiing, 472 U.S. at 602, and attempt to monopolize, Lorain\nJournal, 342 U.S. at 154-55.\n  3M’s interest in raising prices is well-documented in the\nrecord. In internal memoranda introduced into evidence by\nLePage’s, 3M executives boasted that the large retailers like\nOffice Max and Staples had no choice but to adhere to 3M’s\ndemands. See Sealed App. at 2585 (“Either they take the\n[price] increase . . . or we hold orders . . . .”); see also\nSealed App. at 2571 (3M’s directive when Staples objected\nto price increase was “orders will be held if pricing is not up\nto date on 1/1/98”). LePage’s expert testified that the price\n\f                             35\n\n\nof Scotch-brand tape increased since 1994, after 3M\ninstituted its rebate program. App. at 3246-47. In its\nopinion, the District Court cited the deposition testimony of\na 3M employee acknowledging that the payment of the\nrebates after the end of the year discouraged passing the\nrebate on to the ultimate customers. App. at 2092. The\nDistrict Court thus observed, “the record amply reflects\nthat 3M’s rebate programs did not benefit the ultimate\nconsumer.” Le Page’s, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">280350</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7.\n  As the foregoing review of the evidence makes clear, there\nwas sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude the long-\nterm effects of 3M’s conduct were anticompetitive. We must\ntherefore uphold its verdict on liability unless 3M has\nshown adequate business justification for its practices.\n\n                             VI.\n\n          BUSINESS REASONS JUSTIFICATION\n  It remains to consider whether defendant’s actions were\ncarried out for “valid business reasons,” the only recognized\njustification for monopolizing. See, e.g., Eastman Kodak,\n504 U.S. at 483. However, a defendant’s assertion that it\nacted in furtherance of its economic interests does not\nconstitute the type of business justification that is an\nacceptable defense to § 2 monopolization. Paraphrasing one\ncorporate executive’s well publicized statement, whatever is\ngood for 3M is not necessarily permissible under § 2 of the\nSherman Act. As one court of appeals has explained:\n    In general, a business justification is valid if it relates\n    directly or indirectly to the enhancement of consumer\n    welfare. Thus, pursuit of efficiency and quality control\n    might be legitimate competitive reasons . . . , while the\n    desire to maintain a monopoly market share or thwart\n    the entry of competitors would not.\nData Gen.

Thus, for example, exclusionary\npractice has been defined as “a method by which a firm . . .\ntrades a part of its monopoly profits, at least temporarily,\nfor a larger market share, by making it unprofitable for\nother sellers to compete with it.” Richard A. Posner,\nAntitrust Law: An Economic Perspective 28 (1976). Once a\nmonopolist achieves its goal by excluding potential\ncompetitors, it can then increase the price of its product to\nthe point at which it will maximize its profit. This price is\ninvariably higher than the price determined in a competitive\nmarket. That is one of the principal reasons why\nmonopolization violates the antitrust laws. The fact that 3M\nacted to benefit its own economic interests is hardly a\nreason to overturn the jury’s finding that it violated § 2 of\nthe Sherman Act.\n   The defendant bears the burden of “persuad[ing] the jury\nthat its conduct was justified by any normal business\npurpose.” Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. at 608. Although 3M\nalludes to its customers’ desire to have single invoices and\nsingle shipments in defense of its bundled rebates, 3M cites\nto no testimony or evidence in the 55 volume appendix that\nwould support any actual economic efficiencies in having\nsingle invoices and/or single shipments. It is highly\nunlikely that 3M shipped transparent tape along with retail\nauto products or home improvement products to customers\nsuch as Staples or that, if it did, the savings stemming from\nthe joint shipment approaches the millions of dollars 3M\nreturned to customers in bundled rebates.\n  There is considerable evidence in the record that 3M\nentered the private-label market only to “kill it.” See, e.g.,\nSealed App. at 809 (statement by 3M executive in internal\nmemorandum that “I don’t want private label 3M products\nto be successful in the office supply business, its\ndistribution or our consumers/end users”). That is\nprecisely what § 2 of the Sherman Act prohibits by covering\nconduct that maintains a monopoly. Maintaining a\nmonopoly is not the type of valid business reason that will\nexcuse exclusionary conduct. 3M’s business justification\ndefense was presented to the jury, and it rejected the claim.\nThe jury’s verdict reflects its view that 3M’s exclusionary\nconduct, which made it difficult for LePage’s to compete on\nthe merits, had no legitimate business justification.\n\f                                   37\n\n\n                                  VII.\n\n                              DAMAGES\n  As an alternative to its argument that it is entitled to\nJMOL on liability, 3M claims that it is entitled to a new trial\ndue to the District Court’s error in sustaining LePage’s\ndamages award. It gives two reasons. First, it contends that\nthe damage theory proffered by Terry Musika, LePage’s\ndamages expert, was based on improper assumptions and\nshould have been excluded.16 Second, 3M argues that\nMusika’s theory failed to disaggregate the damages based\non lawful versus unlawful conduct by 3M.\n   We review the District Court’s decision to admit or\nexclude expert testimony for abuse of discretion.

Appellant’s Br. at\n72. Musika first calculated the total United States\ntransparent tape sales during the damages period, using\nactual financial data from 1992 to 1997 and projecting total\nsales from 1998 to 2000. Next, he determined how those\nsales would be divided between branded and private-label\nparts of the market, projecting a 1% shift each year from\nbranded to private-label tape sales. In arriving at 1%,\nMusika considered the actual growth in private-label tape\nsales, the actual growth rate of all private-label products\n\n16. 3M does not challenge Musika’s expert qualifications. Nonetheless,\nwe note that he holds a master’s degree in public finance, is a former\npartner at a major accounting firm, and at the time of trial was President\nand CEO of a business consulting firm. Furthermore, Musika frequently\nhas served as a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee, as an expert for\nvarious government agencies, including the Department of Justice and\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, and as an expert witness in\ncomplex cases, including five antitrust cases.\n\f                             38\n\n\n(i.e. not just tape), the growth rate of large customers, and\n3M’s internal projections.\n   After determining the size of both segments of the\nmarket, Musika estimated LePage’s share of the market,\npredicting that LePage’s would have retained its 3.5% share\nof the branded-label segment and its 88% share of the\nprivate-label segment. He opined that LePage’s share of the\noverall market for transparent tape would have increased\nfrom 14.44% in 1992 to 21.2% in 2000 but for 3M’s\nunlawful conduct. Finally, Musika subtracted LePage’s\nactual sales from his projected sales to determine LePage’s\nlost sales due to 3M’s unlawful conduct. He calculated\nLePage’s projected profit margin by looking at LePage’s\nactual profit margin for each year and adjusting it to show\ndeclining prices and LePage’s consequential decreasing\nefficiency due to decreasing sales. Based on those\nadjustments, LePage’s profit margin decreased every year\nduring the damages period. Musika concluded that but for\n3M’s unlawful conduct, LePage’s would have earned an\nextra $36 million dollars.\n  Importantly, 3M does not challenge Musika’s basic\napproach to calculating damages, conceding that “an expert\nmay construct a reasonable offense-free world as a\nyardstick for measuring what, hypothetically, would have\nhappened ‘but for’ the defendant’s unlawful activities.”\nAppellant’s Reply Br. at 37(citing Callahan v.

The District Court rejected\n3M’s objections to LePage’s damages claims, stating that\n“the record . . . demonstrates that Mr. Musika’s\nassumptions were grounded in the past performances of\nScotch, Highland and Le Page’s tapes, as well as 3M’s own\ninternal projections for future growth.” LePage’s, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">280350</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8.\n  The credibility of LePage’s and 3M’s experts was for the\njury to determine.

Once a jury has found that the unlawful\nactivity caused the antitrust injury, the damages may be\ndetermined without strict proof of what act caused the\ninjury, as long as the damages are not based on\nspeculation or guesswork. Id. at 813. The Bonjorno court\nnoted that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible,\nto segregate and attribute a fixed amount of damages to\nany one act as the theory was not that any one act in itself\nwas unlawful, but that all the acts taken together showed\na § 2 violation. Id.\n   Similarly, 3M’s actions, taken as a whole, were found to\nviolate § 2, thus making the disaggregation that 3M speaks\nof to be unnecessary, if not impossible. In any event, we fail\nto see how the jury engaged in speculation or guesswork.\nThe District Court clearly charged the jury to disregard\nlosses not caused by 3M: “You may not calculate damages\nbased only on speculation or guessing . . . . You may not\naward damages for injuries or losses caused by other\nfactors.” App. at 5689.

In the\nabsence of a misstatement of law, jury instructions are\nreviewed for abuse of discretion. Bhaya v. Westinghouse\nElectric Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 191 (3d Cir. 1990). Because\nthe District Court provided the jury with meticulous\ninstructions, methodically explaining this area of the law in\na manner understandable to lay persons, we conclude that\nit did not abuse its discretion.\n The District Court, in instructing the jury on Count I,\nwhich   encompassed     LePage’s   claim    of  unlawful\nmaintenance of monopoly power under § 2, explained:\n    Count I in this case is unlawful maintenance of\n    monopoly power.\n      LePage’s alleges that it was injured by 3M’s unlawful\n    monopolization in the United States market for\n    invisible and transparent tape for home and office use.\n      To win on their claim of monopolization, LePage’s\n    must prove each of the following elements by a\n    preponderance of the evidence.\n     First, that 3M had monopoly power in the relevant\n    market.\n      Secondly, that 3M willfully maintained that power\n    through predatory or exclusionary conduct. . . .\n      And thirdly, that LePage’s was injured in its business\n    or property because of 3M’s restrictive or exclusionary\n    conduct.\nApp. at 5663-64.\n  3M complains that the District Court failed to provide\nguidance that would instruct the jury how to distinguish\n\f                              41\n\n\nbetween unlawful predation and lawful conduct. However,\nin explaining LePage’s maintenance of monopoly claim, the\nDistrict Court told the jury that in order to find for\nLePage’s, it would have to find by a preponderance of the\nevidence that 3M willfully maintained its monopoly power\nthrough exclusionary or predatory conduct. App. at 5663.\nIt then summarized those of 3M’s actions that LePage’s\ncontended were unlawfully exclusionary or predatory,\nincluding 3M’s rebate program, market development fund,\nits efforts to control, reduce or eliminate private-label tape,\nand its efforts to raise the price consumers pay for Scotch\ntape. Thereafter, the judge provided the jury with the\nfollowing factors to determine whether 3M’s conduct was\neither exclusionary or predatory: “its effect on its\ncompetitors, such as LePage’s, its impact on consumers,\nand whether it has impaired competition, in an\nunnecessarily restrictive way.” App. at 5670.\n  Relevant portions of the charge were as follows:\n    The law directs itself not against conduct which is\n    competitive, even severely so, but rather against\n    conduct which tends to destroy competition itself.\nApp. at 5655.\n    LePage’s must prove that 3M willfully maintained\n    monopoly power by predatory or exclusionary conduct,\n    rather than by supplying better products or services, or\n    by exercising superior business judgment, or just by\n    chance. So willful maintenance of monopoly power,\n    that’s an element LePage’s has to prove.\nApp. at 5668.\n    To prove that 3M acted willfully, LePage’s must prove\n    either that 3M engaged in predatory or exclusionary\n    acts or practices, with the conscious objective of\n    furthering the dominance of 3M in the relevant market,\n    or that this was the necessary direct consequence of\n    3M’s conduct or business arrangement.\nApp. at 5668.\n    I’m now giving you what LePage’s contentions are as to\n    what 3M did or did not do, that constituted predatory\n\f                             42\n\n\n    or exclusionary conduct. Number one, 3M’s rebate\n    program, such as the EGF, executive growth fund, or\n    the PGF, the partnership growth fund, and the brand\n    mix program. Number two, 3M’s market development\n    fund called the MDS in some of the testimony, and\n    other payments to customers conditioned on customers\n    achieving certain sales goals or growth targets. Third,\n    3M’s efforts to control, or reduce, or eliminate private\n    label tape. Four, 3M’s efforts to switch customers to\n    3M’s more expensive branded tape, and Five, 3M’s\n    efforts to raise the price consumers pay for Scotch\n    tape. LePage’s claims that all of these things that I’ve\n    just gone through was predatory or exclusionary\n    conduct. Now, 3M denies in every respect that these\n    actions were predatory or exclusionary. 3M contends\n    that these actions were, in fact, pro-competitive.\nApp. at 5668-69.\n    Exclusionary    conduct    and     predatory      conduct\n    comprehends, at the most, behavior that not only, one,\n    tends to impair the opportunities of its rivals, but also,\n    number two, either does not further competition on the\n    merits, or does so in an unnecessarily restrictive way.\n    If 3M has been attempting to exclude rivals on some\n    basis other than efficiency, you may characterize the\n    behavior as predatory.\nApp. at 5670.\n    However, you may not find that a competent, willfully\n    maintained monopoly power, if that company has\n    maintained that power, solely through the exercise of\n    superior foresight or skill in industry, or because of\n    economic or technological efficiencies, or because of\n    size, or because of changes in customer and consumer\n    preferences, or simply because the market is so limited\n    that it is impossible to efficiently produce the product,\n    except by a plan large enough to supply the whole\n    demand.\nApp. at 5670-71.\n    Now with respect to Count 1, unlawfully maintaining\n    monopoly power, mere possession of monopoly power,\n    if lawfully acquired, does not violate the antitrust laws.\n\f                             43\n\n\nApp. at 5671.\n    In determining whether there has been an unlawful\n    exercise of monopoly power, you must bear in mind\n    that a company has not acted unlawfully simply\n    because it has engaged in ordinary competitive\n    behavior that would have been an effective means of\n    competition if it were engaged in by a firm without\n    monopoly power, or simply because it is a large\n    company and a very efficient one.\nApp. at 5672.\n  The trial court further noted that if the jury found the\nevidence to be insufficient to prove any of the elements, it\nhad to find for 3M and against LePage’s. It was careful to\nnote that intense business competition was not considered\npredatory or exclusionary, explaining:\n    The acts or practices that result in the maintenance of\n    monopoly power must represent something other than\n    the conduct of business that is part of the normal\n    competitive process or even extraordinary commercial\n    success. [3M] must represent conduct that has made it\n    very difficult or impossible for competitors to engage in\n    fair competition.\nApp. at 5671.\n  The District Court closely followed the ABA sample\ninstructions when instructing the jury as to predatory and\nexclusionary    conduct,    including    its   instructions\ndistinguishing between procompetitive and anticompetitive\nconduct. See ABA, Sample Jury Instructions in Civil\nAntitrust Cases C-20 to C-21 (1999 Ed.). Furthermore, the\njury instructions were a modified version of those given in\nAspen Skiing, which the Supreme Court did not find\nobjectionable. 472 U.S. at 596-97.\n   3M contends that the District Court was obligated to take\ninto account the decision in Brooke Group when crafting its\njury instructions. As we have explained, Brooke Group\ninvolved claims of predatory pricing, a claim LePage’s never\nalleged against 3M. It follows that the District Court need\nnot have, indeed should not have, instructed the jury as to\nclaims not at issue in the case.\n\f                             44\n\n\n  The jury was given the following questions on Count I:\n    (1) Do you find that LePage’s has proven, by a\n    preponderance of the evidence, that the relevant\n    market is invisible and transparent tape for home and\n    office use in the United States?\n    (2) Do you find that LePage’s has proven, by a\n    preponderance of the evidence, that 3M unlawfully\n    maintained monopoly power as defined under the\n    instructions for Count I?; [and]\n    (2.1) Do you find that LePage’s has proven, as a matter\n    of fact and with a fair degree of certainty, that 3M’s\n    unlawful maintenance of monopoly power injured\n    LePage’s business or property as defined in these\n    instructions?\nApp. at 6523. The jury answered “yes” to each of the three\nquestions. It awarded LePage’s more than $22 million\nbefore trebling.\n  The District Court gave the jury a thorough, clear charge\nas to the § 2 claim. Based on its sound instructions, the\njury decided that LePage’s had met its evidentiary burden\nas to its § 2 claim. Nothing in the jury charge constitutes\nreversible error.\n\n                             IX.\n\n                      CROSS APPEAL\n\n             ATTEMPTED MONOPOLIZATION\n   LePage’s cross appeals from the District Court’s order\ngranting judgment as a matter of law to 3M on LePage’s\nclaim that 3M illegally attempted to maintain its monopoly.\nIn overturning the jury’s verdict for LePage’s on this claim,\nthe District Court stated that “ ‘an attempted maintenance\nof monopoly power’ ” is “inherently illogical.” LePage’s, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">280350</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2.\n  LePage’s argues that the courts and commentators have\nrepeatedly found that defendants can be guilty of both\n\f                             45\n\n\nmonopolization and attempted monopolization claims\narising out of the same conduct.

It\nemphasizes that in Lorain Journal, the Supreme Court\nupheld a § 2 attempted monopolization judgment against\nthe defendant newspaper, holding that “a single newspaper,\nalready enjoying a substantial monopoly in its area, violates\nthe ‘attempt to monopolize’ clause of § 2 when it uses its\nmonopoly to destroy threatened competition.” 342 U.S. at\n154.\n   We need not consider the correctness of the District\nCourt’s ruling on the attempted monopolization claim\nbecause we uphold its decision on the monopolization\nclaim. The jury returned the same amount of damages on\nboth claims and LePage’s concedes that under those\ncircumstances discussion of the attempted monopolization\nis unnecessary.\n\n                             X.\n\n                       CONCLUSION\n   Section 2, the provision of the antitrust laws designed to\ncurb the excesses of monopolists and near-monopolists, is\nthe equivalent in our economic sphere of the guarantees of\nfree and unhampered elections in the political sphere. Just\nas democracy can thrive only in a free political system\nunhindered by outside forces, so also can market\ncapitalism survive only if those with market power are kept\nin check. That is the goal of the antitrust laws.\n  The jury heard the evidence and the contentions of the\nparties, accepting some and rejecting others. There was\nample evidence that 3M used its market power over\ntransparent tape, backed by its considerable catalog of\nproducts, to entrench its monopoly to the detriment of\nLePage’s, its only serious competitor, in violation of § 2 of\nthe Sherman Act. We find no reversible error. Accordingly,\nwe will affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\f46\n\n\n     Volume 2 of 2\n\f                             48\n\n\nGREENBERG, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n   I respectfully dissent as I would reverse the district\ncourt’s order denying the motion for judgment as a matter\nof law on the monopolization claim but affirm on LePage’s’s\ncross-appeal from the motion granting 3M a judgment as a\nmatter of law on the attempted maintenance of monopoly\nclaim. While I recognize that the majority opinion describes\nthe factual background of this case, I nevertheless also will\nset forth its background as I believe that a more specific\nexposition of the facts leads to a conclusion that LePage’s’s\ncase should not have survived 3M’s motion for a judgment\nas a matter of law.\n  As the majority indicates, 3M dominated the United\nStates transparent tape market with a market share above\n90% until the early 1990s. LePage’s around 1980 decided\nto sell “second brand” and private label tape, i.e., tape sold\nunder the retailer’s, rather than the manufacturer’s name,\nan endeavor successful to the extent that LePage’s captured\n88% of private label tape sales in the United States by\n1992. Moreover, growth of “second brand” and private label\ntape accounted for a shift of some tape sales from branded\ntape to private label tape so the size of the private label\ntape business expanded. In the circumstances, not\nsurprisingly, during the early 1990s, 3M also entered the\nprivate label tape business.\n  As the majority notes, LePage’s claims that, in response\nto the growth of this competitive market, 3M engaged in a\nseries of related, anticompetitive acts aimed at restricting\nthe availability of lower-priced transparent tape to\nconsumers. In particular, it asserts that 3M devised\nprograms that prevented LePage’s and the other domestic\ncompany in the business, Tesa Tuck, Inc., from gaining or\nmaintaining large volume sales and that 3M maintained its\nmonopoly by stifling growth of private label tape and by\ncoordinating efforts aimed at large distributors to keep\nretail prices for Scotch tape high. LePage’s barely was\nsurviving at the time of trial and suffered large operating\nlosses from 1996 through 1999.\n  This case centers on 3M’s rebate programs that,\nbeginning in 1993, involved offers by 3M of “package” or\n\f                             49\n\n\n“bundled” discounts for various items ranging from home\ncare and leisure products to audio/visual and stationery\nproducts. Customers could earn rebates by purchasing, in\naddition to transparent tape, a variety of products sold by\n3M’s stationery division, such as Post-It Notes and\npackaging products. There is no doubt but that these\nprograms created incentives for retailers to purchase more\n3M products and enabled them to have single invoices,\nsingle shipments and uniform pricing programs for various\n3M products. 3M linked the size of the rebates to the\nnumber of product lines in which the customers met the\ntargets, an aggregate number that determined the rebate\npercentage the customer would receive on all of its 3M\npurchases across all product lines. Therefore, if customers\nfailed to meet growth targets in multiple categories, they did\nnot receive any rebate, and if they failed to meet the target\nin one product line, 3M reduced their rebates substantially.\nThese requirements are at the crux of the controversy here,\nas LePage’s claims that customers could not meet these\ngrowth targets without eliminating it as a supplier of\ntransparent tape.\n   In practice, as 3M’s rebate program evolved, it offered\nthree different types of rebates: Executive Growth Fund,\nPartnership Growth Fund and Brand Mix Rebates. 3M\ndeveloped a “test program” called Executive Growth Fund\n(“EGF ”) for a small number of retailers, 11 in 1993 and 15\nin 1994. Under EGF, 3M negotiated volume and growth\ntargets for each customer’s purchases from the six 3M\nconsumer product divisions involved in the EGF program.\nA customer meeting the target in three or more divisions\nearned a volume rebate of between 0.2-1.25% of total sales.\n  Beginning in 1995, 3M undertook to end the EGF test\nprogram and institute a rebate program called Partnership\nGrowth Fund (“PGF ”) for the same six 3M consumer\nproducts divisions. Under this program, 3M established\nuniform growth targets applicable to all participants.\nCustomers who increased their purchases from at least two\ndivisions by $1.00 and increased their total purchases by at\nleast 12% over the previous year qualified for the rebate,\nwhich ranged from 0.5% to 2%, depending on the number\nof divisions (between two to five divisions) in which the\n\f                             50\n\n\ncustomer increased its purchases and the total volume of\npurchases.\n   In 1996 and 1997, 3M offered price incentives called\nBrand Mix Rebates to two tape customers, Office Depot and\nStaples, to increase purchases of Scotch brand tapes. 3M\nimposed a minimum purchase level for tape set at the level\nof Office Depot’s and Staples’s purchases the previous year\nwith “growth” factored in. To obtain a higher rebate, these\ntwo customers could increase their percentage of Scotch\npurchases relative to certain lower-priced orders.\n  The evidence at trial focused on the parties’ dealings with\na limited number of customers and demonstrated that\nLePage’s’s problems were attributed to a number of factors,\nnot merely 3M’s rebate programs. Thus, I describe this\nevidence at length.\n\n                         Wal-Mart\n   Before 1992, Wal-Mart bought private label tape only\nfrom LePage’s but, in August 1992, decided to buy private\nlabel tape from 3M as well. In response, LePage’s lowered\nits prices and increased its sales to Wal-Mart. In 1997, Wal-\nMart stopped buying private label tape but offered\nLePage’s’s branded tape as its “second tier” offering. In\n1998, however, Wal-Mart told LePage’s that it was going to\nswitch to a tape program from 3M. LePage’s’s president\nthen visited Wal-Mart following which it changed its plans\nand retained LePage’s as a supplier. Afterwards, Wal-Mart\ndesigned a test comparing LePage’s’s brand against a 3M\nScotch utility tape to determine who would win Wal-Mart’s\n“second tier” tape business. LePage’s added more inches\n(approximately 20% more) to its rolls of tape and won the\ntest. 3M continued, however, to sell Scotch brand tapes to\nWal-Mart, and LePage’s saw its sales to Wal-Mart decline to\napproximately $2,000,000 annually by the time of trial.\nLePage’s claims that Wal-Mart cut back on its tape\npurchases to qualify for 3M’s bundled rebate of $1,468,835\nin 1995.\n\n                           Kmart\n Kmart accounted for 10% of LePage’s’s annual tape sales\nwhen LePage’s lost its business to 3M in 1993. Kmart\n\f                             51\n\n\nasked its suppliers, including 3M, to provide a single bid on\nits entire private label tape business for the following year.\nLePage’s’s president believed, however, that Kmart was “too\nlazy to make a change,” and that it would “never put their\neggs in one basket” by giving all its business to 3M.\nLePage’s offered the same price it had offered the previous\nyear but also offered a volume rebate. 3M offered a lower\nprice and won the bid. Kmart asked for rebates and\n“market development” funds as part of the private label\ntape bid process. 3M offered $200,000 for promotional\nactivities and a $300,000 volume rebate if Kmart purchased\n$10,000,000 of 3M’s Stationery Division products.\n   LePage’s claims that 3M offered Kmart $1,000,000 to\neliminate LePage’s and Tesa as suppliers and to make 3M\nits sole tape supplier. LePage’s points to a 3M document\noutlining 3M’s goal for Kmart to exceed $15,000,000 in 3M\npurchases with the reward being that Kmart would receive\n$75,000 in each of the first two quarters and $100,000 in\nthe last two quarters for promotional activities and would\nreceive $650,000 as a volume rebate if the sales exceeded\n$15,000,000. If the sales were less, 3M would decrease the\nrebate accordingly, e.g., a $400,000 rebate for $13,000,000\nof sales. LePage’s claims that, as a practical matter, Kmart\nhad to eliminate LePage’s and Tesa to reach the growth 3M\nrequired in order to qualify for the rebate. LePage’s asserts\nthat, despite its efforts to regain the private label business\nfrom Kmart, one Kmart buyer told it that he could not talk\nto LePage’s about tape products for the next three years.\n\n                           Staples\n   Staples had been a LePage’s customer for several years.\nFrom 1990 to 1993, LePage’s increased its sales to Staples\nby 440%, growing from $357,000 to $1,954,000. In 1994,\nStaples considered reducing suppliers and asked LePage’s\nand 3M for their best offers in 1994. LePage’s assumed that\nif 3M did make a good offer, LePage’s would have a chance\nto make a better proposal. LePage’s did not make its lowest\noffer, and 3M won the account. When LePage’s went back\nto Staples with a new price, it was told that the decision\nhad been made. LePage’s claims that 3M offered an extra\n1% bonus rebate on Scotch products if Staples eliminated\n\f                            52\n\n\nLePage’s as a supplier (a “growth” rebate that only could be\nmet by converting all of Staple’s private label business to\n3M). 3M paid Staples an advertising allowance in four\npayments totalling $1,000,000 in 1995 and gave it\n$500,000 in free merchandise delivered during Staples’s\nfiscal year 1994. 3M refers to a “$1.5 million settlement”\nwith Staples and refers to multiple payments for different\npurposes. LePage’s, however, implies that these payments\nbore some connection to Staples’s award of its second-tier\ntape business to 3M.\n\n                        Office Max\n   In 1998, after a dispute between Office Max and LePage’s,\nOffice Max accepted 3M’s offer that matched but did not\nbeat LePage’s’s price. LePage’s objected to 3M’s matching\nwhatever price LePage’s offered, and also objected to 3M’s\n“clout” payment. Office Max required its suppliers to make\npayments to help advertise the Office Max name, and\nLePage’s had paid this “clout” payment in the years\nprevious to 1998 when it refused to pay it because of its\ndispute with Office Max. Nevertheless, the buyer for Office\nMax testified that its decision to give its business to 3M\nwas not related to its pricing and rebate program but rather\nto the consistency of its service.\n\n                        Walgreens\n  Walgreens had purchased private label tape from\nLePage’s from 1992 until 1998, when it decided to import\ntape from Taiwan. LePage’s’s chief executive officer\nacknowledged that LePage’s did not lose the account due to\n3M’s activities.\n\n                     American Stores\n  Until 1995, LePage’s’s sales of private label tape to\nAmerican Stores exceeded $1,000,000 annually. According\nto LePage’s, a month after American Stores decided that it\nwould try to maximize 3M’s PGF rebate, it shifted its tape\nbusiness to 3M. In 1995, American Stores decided to stop\nbuying LePage’s tape, principally because of quality\n\f                             53\n\n\nconcerns. In a letter to James Kowieski, Senior Vice\nPresident of Sales at LePage’s, Kevin Winsauer, the\nmanager of the private label department at American,\nwrote: “After much deliberation comparing the pros and\ncons of LePage’s program and 3M’s program, I have decided\nto award the business to 3M. 3M’s proposal was very\ncompetitive and I am sure LePage’s would meet their costs\nto retain the business. However, the decision to move to 3M\nis primarily based on Quality.” SJA 2050-51 (emphasis in\noriginal). When American Stores decided to purchase from\n3M, it was not participating in any rebate programs, and\nWinsauer testified that he was not aware that there were\nrebate programs. He also testified that even without the\nvolume incentive programs, 3M’s price was still slightly\nlower than LePage’s’s.\n\n           Dollar General, CVS, and Sam’s Club\n   LePage’s lost Dollar General’s private label business to a\nforeign supplier but later won the business back. According\nto LePage’s’s president, Dollar General used the bid for\nimported tape to leverage a price reduction from LePage’s.\n3M bid on the CVS account, but LePage’s retained CVS as\na customer by lowering its prices and increasing its rebate.\nAt Sam’s Club, LePage’s tape had been selling well when its\nbuyers were directed by senior management to “maximize”\nall purchases from 3M to maximize the EGF/PGF rebate.\nSubsequently, Sam’s Club stopped purchasing from\nLePage’s.\n\n           Other distributors and buying groups\n  LePage’s claimed that 3M’s pricing practices prevented or\nhindered it from selling private label tape to certain\ncompanies: (1) Costco. Costco, however, never has sold\nprivate label tape. (2) Office Depot. Office Depot also never\nhas sold private label tape. LePage’s tried to convince Office\nDepot to buy private label tape in 1991 or 1992 (before 3M\nimplemented the rebate programs), but Office Depot\ndecided to continue purchasing 3M brand tape. (3) Pamida\nand Venture Stores. LePage’s claimed that 3M offered these\nstores discounts conditioned on exclusivity, thereby\n\f                            54\n\n\npreventing LePage’s from selling private label tape to them.\nLePage’s lost Venture Stores’ business in 1989, five years\nbefore 3M provided the discount at issue. (4) Office Buying\nGroups. 3M offered an optional 0.3% price discount to\ncertain buying groups if they exclusively promoted certain\n3M products in their catalogs. If the buying group carried\na lower value brand alternative to 3M’s main brand (its\nsecond line), then the group would receive a lower annual\nvolume rebate. LePage’s viewed these kind of contract\nprovisions as a “penalty” that coerced buying group\nmembers to purchase tape only from 3M. For example, if a\nbuying group promoted the products of a competitor, it lost\nrebates for purchases in three categories of products. 3M\nargues that LePage’s could have offered its own discount or\nrebate but instead refused in one instance to pay the\nstandard promotional fee charged suppliers for inclusion in\na catalog.\n   Notwithstanding the evidence which demonstrates that\nLePage’s lost business for reasons that could not possibly\nbe attributable to any unlawful conduct by 3M, it argues\nthat 3M willfully maintained its monopoly through a\n“monopoly broth” of anticompetitive and predatory conduct.\nI would reject LePage’s’s argument as I agree with 3M that\nLePage’s simply did not establish that 3M’s conduct was\nillegal, as LePage’s did not demonstrate that 3M’s pricing\nwas below cost (a point that is not in dispute) and, in the\nabsence of such proof, the record does not supply any other\nbasis on which we can uphold the judgment.\n   There are two elements of a monopolization claim under\nsection 2 of the Sherman Act: “(1) the possession of\nmonopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful\nacquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished\nfrom growth or development as a consequence of a superior\nproduct, business acumen, or historic accident.” United\nStates v.

It also argues that 3M’s\nother practices, such as exclusionary contracts and the\ntiming of its rebates, were also anticompetitive and\npredatory. I discuss these claims in the order I have stated\nthem.\n  LePage’s primarily complains of 3M’s use of bundled\nrebates. While, as the majority recognizes, we have held\nthat rebates on volume purchases are lawful, see Advo, Inc.\nv. Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"693382\"><a href=\"/opinion/693382/advo-inc-v-philadelphia-newspapers-inc-dba-philadelphia-inquirer/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1203 (3d\nCir. 1995), LePage’s seeks to avoid that principle by\npointing out that 3M offered higher rebates if customers\nmet their target growth rate in different product categories,\nin effect linking the sale of private label tape with the sale\nof other products, such as Scotch tape, which customers\nhad to buy from 3M. Thus, LePage’s explains:\n    3M understood that, as a practical matter, every\n    retailer in the country had to carry Scotch-brand tape\n    . . . . It therefore decided to structure its rebates into\n    bundles that linked that product with the product\n    segment in which it did face competition from LePage’s\n    (second-line tape) . . . . To increase the leverage on the\n    targeted segment, 3M further linked rebates on\n    transparent tape with those for many other products\n    . . . . The rival would have to ‘compensate’ the\n    customer for the amount of rebate it would lose not\n    only on the large volume of Scotch-brand tape it had to\n    buy, but also for rebates on many other products\n    purchased from 3M.\nBr. of Appellee at 40.\n  In making its argument LePage’s relies in part on\nSmithKline Corp. v. Eli Lilly & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"355677\"><a href=\"/opinion/355677/smithkline-corporation-v-eli-lilly-and-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1056</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir.\n1978), which, as the majority notes, does not bind this en\nbanc court but nevertheless can have precedential value. In\nSmithKline, Eli Lilly & Co. had two products, Keflin and\nKeflex, on which it faced no competition, and one product,\nKefzol, on which it faced competition from SmithKline’s\nproduct, Ancef. See id. at 1061. Lilly offered a higher rebate\nof 3% to companies that purchased specified quantities of\nany three (which, practically speaking, meant combined\npurchases of Kefzol, Keflin and Keflex) of Lilly’s\n\f                                    56\n\n\ncephalosporin products. See id. “Although hospitals were\nfree to purchase SmithKline’s Ancef with their Keflin and\nKeflex orders with Lilly, thus avoiding the penalties of a tie-\nin sale,[1] the practical effect of that decision would be to\ndeny the Ancef purchaser the 3% bonus rebate on all its\ncephalosporin products.” Id. at 1061-62 (internal footnote\nadded). Because of Lilly’s volume advantage, to offer a\nrebate of the same net dollar amount as Lilly’s, SmithKline\nwould have had to offer companies rebates ranging from\n16% for average size hospitals to 35% for larger volume\nhospitals for their purchase of Ancef. See id. at 1062.\n   We concluded that Lilly willfully acquired and maintained\nmonopoly power by linking products on which it faced no\ncompetition (Keflin and Keflex) with a competitive product,\nresulting in the sale of all three products on a non-\ncompetitive basis in what otherwise would have been a\ncompetitive market between Ancef and Kefzol. See id. at\n1065. Moreover, this arrangement would force SmithKline\nto pay rebates on one product equal to rebates paid by Lilly\nbased on sales volume of three products. See id. Expert\ntestimony and the evidence on pricing showed that in the\ncircumstances SmithKline’s prospects for continuing in the\nAncef market were poor.\n   LePage’s argues that it does not have to show that 3M’s\npackage discounts could prevent an equally efficient firm\nfrom matching or beating 3M’s package discounts. In its\nbrief, LePage’s contends that its expert economist explained\nthat 3M’s programs and cash payments have the same\nanticompetitive impact regardless of the cost structure of\nthe rival suppliers or their efficiency relative to that of 3M.\nSee Br. of Appellee at 43. LePage’s alleges that the relative\nefficiency or cost structure of the competitor simply affects\n\n1. 3M also avoids the penalties of a tie-in sale, because its customers\nwere free to purchase its Scotch tape by itself. To prove an illegal tie-in,\na plaintiff must establish that the agreement to sell one product was\nconditioned on the purchase of a different or tied product; the seller “has\nsufficient economic power with respect to the tying product to\nappreciably restrain free competition in the market for the tied product\nand a ‘not insubstantial’ amount of interstate commerce is affected.”\nNorthern Pac.

The district court stated that\nLePage’s introduced substantial evidence that the\nanticompetitive effects of 3M’s rebate program caused its\nlosses. See LePage’s Inc. v. 3M, No. Civ. A. 97-3983, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">280350</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7-8 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 14, 2000). The majority\nfinds that “3M’s conduct was at least as anticompetitive as\nthe conduct which [we] held violated § 2 in SmithKline.”\nMaj. Op. at 24.\n  I disagree with the majority’s use of SmithKline.\nSmithKline showed that it could not compete by explaining\nhow much it would have had to lower prices for both small\nand big customers to do so. SmithKline ascertained the\nrebates that Lilly was giving to customers on all three\nproducts and calculated how much it would have had to\nlower the price of its product if the rebates were all\nattributed to the one competitive product. In contrast,\nLePage’s did not even attempt to show that it could not\ncompete by calculating the discount that it would have had\nto provide in order to match the discounts offered by 3M\nthrough its bundled rebates, and thus its brief does not\npoint to evidence along such lines.\n   While I recognize that it is obvious from the size of 3M’s\nrebates as compared to LePage’s’s sales that Lepage’s would\nhave had to make substantial reductions in prices to match\nthe rebates 3M paid to particular customers, Lepage’s did\nnot show the amount by which it lowered its prices in\nactual monetary figures or by percentage to compete with\n3M and how its profitability thus was decreased. Rather,\nLePage’s merely maintains, through the use of an expert,\nthat it would have had to cut its prices drastically to\ncompete and thus would have gone out of business.\nFurthermore, it is critically important to recognize that\nLePage’s had 67% of the private label business at the time\nof the trial. Thus, notwithstanding 3M’s rebates, LePage’s\nwas able to retain most of the private label business. In the\ncircumstances, it is ironical that LePage’s complains of\n3M’s use of monopoly power as the undisputed fact is that\n\f                                  58\n\n\nLePage’s, not 3M, was the dominant supplier of private\nlabel tape both before and after 3M initiated its rebate\nprograms. Indeed, the record suggests that inasmuch as\nLePage’s could not make a profit with a 67% share of the\nprivate label sales, it must have needed to be essentially the\nexclusive supplier of such tape for its business to be\nprofitable as it in fact was when it had an 88% share of the\nprivate label tape sales business.\n   Although I am not evaluating the expert’s method of\ncalculating damages as I would not reach the damages\nissue, I emphasize that simply pointing to an expert to\nsupport the contention that the company would have gone\nout of business, without providing even the most basic\npricing information, is insufficient. “Expert testimony is\nuseful as a guide to interpreting market facts, but it is not\na substitute for them.” Brooke Group Ltd. v.

Without\nsuch pricing information, it is difficult even to begin to\nestimate how much of the market share LePage’s lost was\ndue to 3M’s bundled rebates. In fact, the evidence that I\ndescribed above conclusively demonstrates that LePage’s\nlost private sale tape business for reasons not related to\n3M’s rebates. Furthermore, some experts have questioned\nthe validity of attributing all the rebates to the one\ncompetitive product in situations such as these.2 I do not\n\n2. One court has mentioned a hypothetical situation where a low-cost\nshampoo maker could not match a competitor’s package discount for\nshampoo and conditioner even though both products were priced above\ntheir respective costs. See Ortho Diagnostic Sys., Inc. v. Abbott Labs.,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1461530\"><a href=\"/opinion/1461530/ortho-diagnostic-systems-v-abbott-laboratories/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). In that case, the court\nsuggested that the bundled price could be unlawful under section 2 even\nthough neither item in the package was priced below cost. If the entire\npackage discount were attributed to the one product where the two\n\f                                   59\n\n\nneed, however, to decide the validity of that method of\ncalculation, as LePage’s does not even attempt to meet that\nless strict test by calculating how much it would have had\nto lower its prices to match the rebates, even if they all\nwere aggregated and attributed to private label tape.3\n   LePage’s also has not satisfied the stricter tests devised\nby other courts considering bundled rebates in situations\nsuch as that here. In a case brought by a manufacturer of\nproducts used in screening blood supply for viruses, Ortho\nDiagnostic Systems, Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., 920 F.\nSupp. 455 (S.D.N.Y. 1996), the district court held, inter\nalia, that the defendant’s discount pricing of products in\npackages did not violate the Sherman Act. The defendant,\nAbbott Laboratories, manufactured all five of the commonly\nused tests to screen the blood supply for viruses. Ortho\n\nparties compete, the low-cost shampoo maker could not lower its prices\non the product enough to match the total discount without selling below\nits cost. See id. at 467-69. Commentators, however, suggests that this\nanalysis is incorrect. See III PHILLIP E. AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP,\nANTITRUST LAW: AN ANALYSIS OF ANTITRUST PRINCIPLES AND THEIR APPLICATION\n¶ 749, at 467 n.6 (rev. ed. 1996).\n  One aspect of this method of calculation worth noting is that the\nvolume of the products ordered has a drastic effect on how much the\ncompetitor would have to lower its prices to compete. For example,\nsuppose in a similar rebate program, a company was the only producer\nof products A and B but faced competition in C. If a customer orders 100\nunits each of A, B, and C at a price of $1.00 each, a 3% rebate would\nbe $9.00 (3% of the total of $300.00). If the rebate on all three products\nwere attributed to product C, then the competitor would have to lower its\nprice to $0.91 in order to compete with it. The results would be starkly\ndifferent, however, if a customer orders 100 units of A and B but only\nneeds 10 units of C. Then the 3% rebate on the total purchase amount\nof $210.00 would be $6.30. If the rebate was attributed solely to product\nC, then a competitor would have to lower its price to $.37 on product C\nin order to match the company’s price.\n3. The closest LePage’s comes to supplying such information in its brief\nis its statement that “LePage’s made repeated efforts to save its tape\nbusiness with Staples, reducing its prices to 1990 levels, and then\nreducing them again, to keep its plant open and people working.” Br. of\nAppellee at 11. This is not close enough. Of course, Lepage’s’s prices\noverall were low enough for it to have 67% of the private label business.\n\f                             60\n\n\nclaimed that Abbott violated sections 1 and 2 of the\nSherman Act by contracting with the Council of Community\nBlood Centers to give those members advantageous pricing\nif they purchased a package of four or five tests from\nAbbott, thereby using its monopoly position in some of the\ntests to foreclose or impair competition by Ortho in the sale\nof those tests available from both companies. See id. at\n458. The district court stated that to prevail on a\nmonopolization claim in “a case in which a monopolist (1)\nfaces competition on only part of a complementary group of\nproducts, (2) offers the products both as a package and\nindividually, and (3) effectively forces its competitors to\nabsorb the differential between the bundled and unbundled\nprices of the product in which the monopolist has market\npower,” the plaintiff must allege and prove “either that (a)\nthe monopolist has priced below its average variable cost or\n(b) the plaintiff is at least as efficient a producer of the\ncompetitive product as the defendant, but that the\ndefendant’s pricing makes it unprofitable for the plaintiff to\ncontinue to produce.” Id. at 469.\n  Holding that the discount package pricing did not violate\nthe Sherman Act, the Ortho court explained that any other\nrule would involve too substantial a risk that the antitrust\nlaws would be used to protect an inefficient competitor\nagainst price competition that would benefit consumers.\nSee id. at 469-70 (“The antitrust laws were not intended,\nand may not be used, to require businesses to price their\nproducts at unreasonably high prices (which penalize the\nconsumer) so that less efficient competitors can stay in\nbusiness.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  In this case, as the majority acknowledges, LePage’s now\ndoes not contend that 3M priced its products below average\nvariable cost, an allegation which, if made, in any event\nwould be difficult to prove. See Advo, 51 F.3d at 1198-99.\nMoreover, LePage’s’s economist conceded that LePage’s is\nnot as efficient a tape producer as 3M. Thus, in this case\nsection 2 of the Sherman Act is being used to protect an\ninefficient producer from a competitor not using predatory\npricing but rather selling above cost. While the majority\ncontends that Brooke Group, a case on which 3M heavily\nrelies, is distinguishable as none of the defendants there\n\f                              61\n\n\nhad a monopoly in the market, the fact remains that the\nCourt in describing section 2 of the Sherman Act said flat\nout in Brooke Group that “a plaintiff seeking to establish\ncompetitive injury from a rival’s low prices must prove that\nthe prices complained of are below an appropriate measure\nof its rival’s costs.” Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 222, 113\nS.Ct. at 2587. LePage’s simply did not do this.\n   I realize that the majority indicates that “LePage’s unlike\nthe plaintiff in Brooke Group, does not make a predatory\npricing claim.” Maj. Op. at 16. But that circumstance\nweakens rather than strengthens LePage’s’s position as it\nmerely confirms the lawfulness of 3M’s conduct.\nFurthermore, the circumstance that 3M is not dealing in an\noligopolistic market should not matter as the harm that\nLePage’s claims to have suffered from the bundled rebates\nwould be no less if inflicted by multiple competitors.\nMoreover, monopolist or not, 3M, even in the absence of\nLePage’s and Tesa from the private label business, would\nnot be the only supplier of private lable tape for there are\nforeign suppliers as is demonstrated plainly by the evidence\nthat both Walgreens and Dollar General dealt with such\nsuppliers.\n   Contrary to the majority’s view, this is not a situation in\nwhich there is no business justification for 3M’s actions.\nThis point is important inasmuch as it is difficult to\ndistinguish legitimate competition from exclusionary\nconduct that harms competition, see United States v.\nMicrosoft Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185418\"><a href=\"/opinion/185418/united-states-v-microsoft-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58 (D.C.

In Concord Boat, the\n“strings” attached were the exclusivity provisions. See\nConcord Boat Corp. v.

Ark. 1998).\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, however,\ndisagreed with the district court in Concord Boat. The court\nof appeals opinion reflected an application of Brooke\nGroup’s strong stance favoring vigorous price competition\nand expressing skepticism of the ability of a court to\nseparate anticompetitive from procompetitive actions when\nit comes to above-cost strategic pricing. See Concord Boat,\n\f                             63\n\n\n207 F.3d at 1061. More importantly, the court perceived\nthat Brooke Group should be considered even with claims\nbased on pricing with strings. See id. “If a firm has\ndiscounted prices to a level that remains above the firm’s\naverage variable cost, the plaintiff must overcome a strong\npresumption of legality by showing other factors indicating\nthat the price charged is anticompetitive.” Id.

The court stated that a section 2\ndefendant’s proffered business justification is the most\nimportant factor in determining whether its challenged\nconduct is not competition on the merits. See id. at 1062.\nThe court distinguished cases such as SmithKline and\nOrtho where products were bundled since they involved two\nmarkets. See id. Of course, here we are dealing with a\nsingle market.\n   Unlike the situation of the defendant in Aspen, 3M’s\npricing structure and bundled rebates were not contrary to\nits economic interests, as they likely increased its sales. In\nfact, that is exactly what LePage’s is complaining about.\nFurthermore, other than the obvious reasons such as\nincreasing bulk sales, market share and customer loyalty,\nthere are several other potential “procompetitive” or valid\nbusiness reasons for 3M’s pricing structure and bundled\nrebates: efficiency in having single invoices, single\nshipments and uniform pricing programs for various\nproducts. Moreover, the record demonstrates that, with the\nbiggest customers, 3M’s rebates were not eliminating the\ncompetitive process, as LePage’s still was able to retain\nsome customers through negotiation, and even though it\nlost other customers, the losses were attributable to their\nswitching to foreign suppliers or changing suppliers\nbecause of quality or service without regard to the rebates.\nFurthermore, overall LePage’s was quite successful in\nholding its share of the private label sales as it had 67% of\nthe business at the time of the trial.\n  In sum, I conclude that as a matter of law 3M did not\nviolate section 2 of the Sherman Act by reason of its\nbundled rebates even though its practices harmed its\ncompetitors. The majority decision which upholds the\ncontrary verdict risks curtailing price competition and a\n\f                             64\n\n\nmethod of pricing beneficial to customers because the\nbundled rebates effectively lowered their costs. I regard this\nresult as a significant mistake which cannot be justified by\na fear that somehow 3M will raise prices unreasonably\nlater. In this regard I reiterate that in addition to LePage’s\nthere are foreign suppliers of transparent tape so that with\nor without LePage’s there will be constraints on 3M’s\npricing.\n   LePage’s also claims that, through a variety of other\nallegedly anticompetitive actions, 3M prevented LePage’s\nfrom competing. LePage’s asserts that 3M foreclosed\ncompetition by directly purchasing sole-supplier status.\nThere was some dispute as to whether the contracts were\nconditioned on 3M being the sole supplier, and 3M claims\nthat there are only two customers for which there is any\nevidence of a sole supplier agreement. I recognize, however,\nthat although most of 3M’s contracts with customers were\nnot conditioned on exclusivity, practically speaking some\ncustomers dropped LePage’s as a supplier to maximize the\nrebates that 3M was offering.

Using\nthat standard, although LePage’s’s market share in private\nlabel tape has fallen from 88% to 67%, it has not been\nestablished that, as a result of the allegedly exclusive\ncontracts, competition was foreclosed in a substantial share\nof the line of commerce affected. Indeed, in view of\nLePage’s’s two-thirds share of the private label business, its\nattack on exclusivity agreements is attenuated.\n   There appear to be very few cases supporting liability\nbased on section 2 of the Sherman Act for exclusive\ndealing, as some cases suggest that if, as is the case here\nunder the jury’s findings, there is no liability under section\n3 of the Clayton Act, it is more difficult to find liability\nunder the Sherman Act since its scope is more restricted.4\nIn any event, the record shows only two allegedly exclusive\ncontracts (with the Venture and Pamida stores), and\n“[b]ecause an exclusive deal affecting a small fraction of a\nmarket clearly cannot have the requisite harmful effect\nupon competition, the requirement of a significant degree of\nforeclosure serves a useful screening function.” Microsoft,\n253 F.3d at 69. The Microsoft court explained that although\nexclusive contracts are commonplace, particularly in the\nfield of distribution, in certain circumstances the use of\nexclusive contracts may give rise to a section 2 violation\neven though the contracts foreclose less than the roughly\n40 to 50% share usually required to establish a section 1\nviolation. See id. at 69-70. In this case, it cannot be\nconcluded that the two contracts with Venture and Pamida\nwere responsible for the total drop in LePage’s’s market\nshare. Furthermore, even if all 3M’s contracts were\nconsidered exclusive, LePage’s’s total drop in market share\nwas only 21%, and some of this loss was shown in the\nrecord to be due to quality or service consistency concerns,\nas well as foreign competition, rather than to 3M’s tactics.\n\n4. It is more common for charges of exclusive dealing to be brought\nunder section 1 of the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act, which the jury\nfound that 3M did not violate. See, e.g., Barr Labs., Inc. v. Abbott Labs.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593306\"><a href=\"/opinion/593306/barr-laboratories-inc-v-abbott-laboratories/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 110 (3d Cir. 1992).\n\f                             66\n\n\nTherefore, there was not enough foreclosure of the market\nto have an anticompetitive effect.\n  LePage’s also claims that by calculating the rebates only\nonce a year, 3M made it more difficult for a purchaser to\npass on the savings to its customers, thereby making it\nharder for companies to switch suppliers and keeping retail\nprices and margins high. As I discussed above, one-year\ncontracts may be considered standard, and even if they\nmake it more unlikely that rebates are passed on in the\nform of lower retail prices, the discounts could be applied\ntowards lowering retail prices the following year or towards\nother costs by companies that are factored into the retail\nprices (such as advertising). In the circumstances, I am\nsatisfied that this conduct does not qualify as predatory or\nanticompetitive so as to establish liability under section 2\nof the Sherman Act.\n   LePage’s also alleges that 3M entered the retail private\nlabel tape portion of the market to destroy the market and\nthereby increase its sales of branded tape, but the case law\ndoes not support liability under section 2 for this type of\naction. In Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 215, 113 S.Ct. at\n2584, Liggett/Brooke Group alleged that Brown &\nWilliamson Tobacco Corporation (“B&W”) sold generic\ncigarettes in order to decrease losses of sales in its branded\ncigarettes. B&W sold generic cigarettes at the same list\nprice as Liggett but also offered large volume rebates to\ncertain wholesalers so they would buy their generic\ncigarettes from B&W. See id. at 216, 113 S.Ct. at 2584.\nB&W wanted to take a larger part of the generic market\nfrom Liggett and drive Liggett to raise prices on generic\ncigarettes, which B&W would match, thereby encouraging\nconsumers to switch back to branded cigarettes. See id. at\n216-17, 113 S.Ct. at 2584. The Court held that because\nB&W had no reasonable prospect of recouping its predatory\nlosses and could not inflict the injury to competition that\nantitrust laws prohibit, it did not violate the Robinson-\nPatman Act or the Sherman Act. See id. at 243, 113 S.Ct.\nat 2598. In this case, however, 3M did not use below\naverage variable cost pricing (LePage’s does not charge\npredatory pricing) and therefore 3M did not have predatory\ncosts to recoup.\n\f                                 67\n\n\n   I recognize that LePage’s attempts to distinguish Brooke\nGroup on the ground that “3M used other techniques [i.e.,\ntechniques other than predatory pricing] to extinguish the\nprivate-label category subjecting itself to different legal\nstandards,” Br. of Appellee at 55, but I nevertheless cannot\naccept LePage’s’s argument on this point. While LePage’s\ndoes not contend that 3M engaged in predatory pricing, it\ndoes contend that the goal of 3M’s other conduct was “to\nextinguish the private-label category, subjecting itself to\ndifferent legal standards” than those applicable in Brooke\nGroup. See id. Moreover, though 3M denies that it was\nattempting to eliminate the private label category of\ntransparent tape, the record supports a finding that it had\nthat intent. I am satisfied, however, that its efforts to\neliminate the private label aspect of the transparent tape\nmarket are not unlawful as, “examined without reference to\nits effects on competitors,” it is evident that in view of 3M’s\ndominance in brand tape, that it was rational for it to want\nthe sale of tape to be concentrated in that category of the\nmarket. See Stearns Airport Equip. Co. v. FMC Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"17234\"><a href=\"/opinion/17234/stearns-airport-v-fmc-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 523 (5th Cir. 1999). Thus, we should not uphold\nthe verdict on that basis.\n  Accordingly, I conclude that 3M’s actions in the record,\nincluding the bundled rebates and other elements of the\n“monopoly broth,” were not anticompetitive and predatory\nas to violate section 2 of the Sherman Act.5 Thus, I would\nreverse the judgment of the district court and remand the\ncase for entry of judgment in favor of 3M. Judge Scirica and\nJudge Alito join in this opinion.\n\nA True Copy:\n        Teste:\n\n                      Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n                                  for the Third Circuit\n\n\n\n\n5. While I do not discuss the point I agree with the district court’s\ndisposition of the attempted maintenance of monopoly claim.\n\f</pre>",
