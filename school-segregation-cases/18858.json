(Fujitsu) appeals from the denial of its petition to\ncompel arbitration of a dispute that arose with plaintiff Lyons Magnus, Inc. (Lyons).\nLyons had retained Fujitsu to install and implement ―Enterprise Resource Planning‖ (or\nERP) business software produced and sold by SAP America, Inc. (SAP). The software\npackage included a special module known as ―Tradespend Management‖ (Tradespend)\ndeveloped by Vistex, Inc. (Vistex) for use in SAP‘s ERP software. During the software\nimplementation process, a controversy arose regarding the proper timing to implement\nportions of Tradespend. Significant delays and other problems followed, and Lyons\neventually filed a complaint in the trial court against Fujitsu, SAP and Vistex alleging\nvarious theories of tort and contract liability. Meanwhile, Fujitsu commenced an\narbitration proceeding against Lyons only. The contract between Fujitsu and Lyons\nprovided for arbitration of disputes, but SAP and Vistex were not subject to that\nprovision and they were unwilling to arbitrate.\n       Fujitsu filed a petition to compel Lyons to arbitrate under Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 1281.2.1 Lyons opposed the petition and also sought to enjoin or stay the\narbitration proceedings. Lyons argued that if the arbitration were allowed to proceed in\nthe absence of all of the parties, there was a substantial risk of conflicting rulings. The\ntrial court agreed with Lyons‘s assessment and denied the petition to compel arbitration\nbased on section 1281.2, subdivision (c). Under that subdivision, a petition may be\ndenied if ―[a] party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action\n… with a third party, arising out of the same transaction or series of related transactions\nand there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.‖ Fujitsu\nargues on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion because, allegedly, conflicting\nrulings could not possibly have occurred. Fujitsu, however, falls short of demonstrating\n\n1     Unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the Code of Civil\nProcedure.\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\fthat premise. Moreover, we conclude the trial court‘s decision was well within its\nreasonable discretion under the circumstances. Accordingly, the order is affirmed.\n                        FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n         Fujitsu was a provider of information technology products and services. Fujitsu\nwas designated by SAP as one of its global technology partners and had collaborated with\nSAP in installing and customizing SAP software for over three decades. SAP‘s software\nproducts included ERP software. The purpose of ERP software was to improve business\noperations by streamlining existing processes and improving visibility into business\noperations using a unified suite of software applications that are integrated into existing\nbusiness software systems.\n         In 2009, Lyons decided it would update its information technology by obtaining\nERP software. After reviewing the available versions of such software on the market,\nLyons decided to purchase ERP software from SAP. In Lyons‘s perspective, one feature\nthat set SAP‘s ERP software apart from others was its inclusion of Tradespend by Vistex.\nTradespend was a special software module that dealt with customer discounts and\nrebates, which represented an important portion of Lyons‘s business.\n         Having decided to purchase SAP‘s ERP software, it was necessary for Lyons to\ndetermine which company should be hired to implement the software. SAP\nrecommended Fujitsu as a company that had the qualified personnel and experience\nnecessary to implement all aspects of the ERP software. On August 25, 2009, Lyons and\nFujitsu entered into a master agreement for the supply of equipment, software and\nservices (the Master Agreement), pursuant to which Fujitsu was to provide professional\ntechnology consulting services to install and implement the SAP ERP software for\nLyons.\n         Since SAP ERP software must be individually tailored to specific business\noperations and integrated into existing systems, the implementation of the software can\nbe extremely involved and complex. Fujitsu and Lyons agreed that the implementation\n\n                                             3.\n\fprocess would occur in accordance with a three-phase schedule set forth in a statement of\nwork, which was an attachment to the Master Agreement. The phases were described as\nphases 1A, 1B, and 1C. During each phase, only certain software modules or\napplications were to be implemented at that time, as set forth in the statement of work.\n       Fujitsu began implementing phase 1A in October 2009, and that phase was\nsuccessfully completed ahead of schedule. However, difficulties began to arise during\nthe next phase—phase 1B—of the implementation process. There were disagreements\nover how soon Fujitsu should implement portions of Vistex‘s Tradespend module.\nApparently, Vistex‘s employees strongly disagreed with Fujitsu‘s employees on that\nissue. The disagreements reached a level of discord that Vistex employees allegedly\nthreatened Fujitsu staff while the latter attempted to implement Tradespend. The\ncontroversy led to substantial delays and, according to Lyons, other problems or defects\nwere encountered as well.\nLawsuit in Superior Court\n       On September 21, 2011, Lyons filed its lawsuit in the trial court naming Fujitsu,\nSAP and Vistex as defendants. The complaint stated general allegations common to all\ncauses of action, which we briefly summarize here. SAP and Fujitsu expressly\nrepresented to Lyons that Fujitsu was qualified and able to provide Lyons with the\nservices needed to successfully implement the SAP ERP, including the Tradespend\nmodule developed by Vistex. In reliance on said representations, Lyons entered into the\nMaster Agreement with Fujitsu to implement the SAP ERP software. Allegedly, as soon\nas Fujitsu sent individuals to Lyons‘s facility to implement the software, it became\napparent that there were problems and Fujitsu was having difficulty completing the\nimplementation of Tradespend. In particular, a conflict allegedly developed in regard to\nthe implementation of Tradespend, resulting in Vistex staff threatening Fujitsu staff and\nindividuals leaving the Lyons‘s implementation. According to Lyons‘s complaint, after\n\n\n\n                                            4.\n\fsubstantial delays and other problems persisted, it became apparent to Lyons that Fujitsu\nwas not going to complete the implementation of the software.\n       Based on these and other allegations, the complaint alleged breach of contract\nclaims against Fujitsu and SAP, including a first cause of action for rescission and a ninth\ncause of action for breach of contract. The complaint also contained a number of causes\nof action premised on alleged tortious conduct, including a second cause of action for\nfraud–intentional misrepresentation against Fujitsu and SAP; a third cause of action for\nfraud–intentional concealment against Fujitsu and SAP; a fourth cause of action for\nviolation of Business and Professions Code section 17200 against Fujitsu and SAP; a\nfifth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation against Fujitsu and SAP; a sixth\ncause of action for conspiracy to defraud against ―all‖ defendants (i.e., Fujitsu, SAP and\nVistex); a seventh cause of action for intentional interference with contract against\nVistex; and an eighth cause of action for negligent interference with prospective\neconomic relations against Vistex.\nArbitration Proceedings\n       In the Master Agreement between Fujitsu and Lyons, it provided that ―[a]ny\ncontroversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled before one\narbitrator by binding arbitration in Santa Clara County, California under the auspices of\nthe American Arbitration Association (‗AAA‘) .…‖ On November 29, 2011, Fujitsu\ninitiated arbitration proceedings by filing a demand for arbitration (the Demand) with the\nAAA.2 The Demand stated Fujitsu‘s single cause of action against Lyons for breach of\ncontract. According to the Demand, Lyons failed to pay Fujitsu for a substantial portion\nof the work it had performed under the Master Agreement. Furthermore, the Demand\nalleged Lyons began insisting that certain software modules be installed in the second\n\n2       Fujitsu was formally served with Lyons‘s complaint and summons about one week\nlater, on December 8, 2011.\n\n\n\n                                             5.\n\fphase of implementation, even though such work was (allegedly) not scheduled to be\ndone until the last phase in the statement of work. Lyons refused to cooperate with\nFujitsu in developing a revised statement of work to provide for such changes or\nmodifications using a formal change-order process. Instead, Lyons simply demanded\nsuch changes and then, later, ceased paying Fujitsu. Fujitsu continued to complete\nphase 1B for approximately two months and offered proposals to accommodate Lyons‘s\nchanges. When it became apparent that Lyons would not cooperate or pay amounts\nowed, the contract was terminated. The total amount that Lyons allegedly owed Fujitsu\nwas approximately $1.2 million for services performed on phase 1B of the software\nimplementation.\nTrial Court Proceedings\n       On December 21, 2011, Lyons filed a motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin\nor stay the arbitration proceedings initiated by Fujitsu. The motion was made on the\nground that Lyons‘s claims against Fujitsu were intertwined with related claims against\nthird parties SAP and Vistex, and it was therefore necessary for all of the claims to be\nadjudicated together with all of the parties in a single action in the superior court in order\nto avoid inconsistent findings of fact or law. For this reason, Lyons asked the trial court\nto enjoin or stay the arbitration proceedings.\n       On January 9, 2012, Fujitsu filed its petition to compel Lyons to arbitrate before\nthe AAA and to stay the pending litigation under section 1281.2. The petition argued that\nLyons should be ordered to arbitrate all disputes between it and Fujitsu in accordance\nwith the agreement to arbitrate set forth in the Master Agreement. Fujitsu further argued\nthat Lyons‘s claims against third parties SAP and Vistex could be adjudicated afterwards,\nseparately and efficiently, without any risk of conflicting rulings. Both SAP and Vistex\nfiled joinders in Fujitsu‘s petition to compel arbitration and stay the litigation because\nthey preferred that Fujitsu and Lyons arbitrate in advance of the trial court litigation,\nsince it might help to resolve or simplify the issues in the litigation.\n\n                                               6.\n\f         On February 8, 2012, Lyons filed its opposition to the petition to compel\narbitration. The opposition reiterated Lyons‘s position that because its pending lawsuit\ninvolved third parties (SAP and Vistex) against whom Lyons asserted causes of action\nthat were related to and intertwined with its dispute against Fujitsu, the only way to avoid\nthe risk of conflicting rulings was to have the entire controversy, including the claims\nagainst SAP and Vistex, heard in a single forum in the trial court. Accordingly, under\nsection 1281.2, subdivision (c), Lyons urged the trial court to deny Fujitsu‘s petition.\n         Fujitsu‘s petition to compel arbitration and Lyons‘s motion to enjoin or stay\narbitration were both heard together on February 23, 2012. Following oral argument, the\ntrial court took the petition and motion under submission.\n         On March 8, 2012, the trial court heard and decided a demurrer filed by SAP to\nLyons‘s complaint. SAP‘s demurrer to the first cause of action (for rescission) was\nsustained on the ground that the cause of action was duplicative of the cause of action for\nbreach of contract pled in the complaint. Similarly, SAP‘s demurrer to the sixth cause of\naction (for civil conspiracy) was sustained on the ground that civil conspiracy was not an\nindependent cause of action separate from the tort causes of action alleged in the\ncomplaint. The trial court did not hold that no basis for conspiracy liability existed, but\nonly that it was not a stand-alone or independent cause of action.\n         On March 28, 2012, the trial court issued its written order deciding Fujitsu‘s\npetition to compel arbitration and Lyons‘s motion to enjoin or stay the arbitration. The\ntrial court agreed with Lyons‘s position that there was a risk of inconsistent rulings if the\narbitration proceeded and so it denied Fujitsu‘s petition to compel arbitration and granted\nLyons‘s motion to enjoin arbitration. The trial court relied on the discretion conferred on\nit by section 1281.2, subdivision (c), to the effect that a court ―may refuse to compel\narbitration where a controversy affects claims by other parties not bound by the\narbitration agreement and arbitration risks conflicting rulings on common issues of law or\nfact.‖\n\n                                              7.\n\f       In its written order, the trial court summarized a scenario in which conflicting\nrulings might occur: ―Were the case to proceed to arbitration first, Fujitsu could claim\nthat it is not at fault for any of the problems that occurred, and that the fault, if any, lies\nwith SAP and/or Vistex (or others). [Thus], the arbitrator could reasonably conclude that\nFujitsu is not responsible, but non-parties SAP and/or Vistex are. [Lyons] receives no\naward, as SAP and Vistex are non-parties to the arbitration (and have contended\nexplicitly that they are not bound by the arbitrator‘s findings). [¶] Lyons then proceeds\nto trial against SAP and/or Vistex, who then ‗point the finger‘ at Fujitsu, which has\nalready been absolved of liability by the arbitrator. The jury agrees that Fujitsu is the\nliable party, and absolves SAP and Vistex of liability. Lyons winds up with no recovery,\ndue to these inconsistent findings, after two complex proceedings and their associated\ncosts. Undoubtedly, other inconsistent scenarios can be imagined depending upon one‘s\nassumptions as to the likely outcomes.[3]‖\n       Following entry of the above order, Fujitsu timely filed its notice of appeal.\n                                        DISCUSSION\nI.     Standard of Review\n       An order denying a petition to compel arbitration under section 1281.2,\nsubdivision (c), is reviewed for abuse of discretion. (Lindemann v. Hume (2012) 204\nCal.App.4th 556, 565 (Lindemann).) Under this standard, the trial court‘s discretionary\nruling will not be disturbed unless it ―exceed[ed] the bounds of reason.‖ (Henry v.\n\n\n\n3       The trial court added, in a footnote: ―One could also posit that Fujitsu defeats\nLyons‘[s] claims against it and largely prevails on its affirmative claims for amounts\nowed by Lyons in the arbitration; however, the arbitrator apportions some fault to absent\nparties SAP and/or Vistex. Lyons would then be compelled to pursue its claims against\nSAP and/or Vistex in a subsequent court trial in order to seek indemnification unavailable\nin the arbitration forum. The possible inconsistencies inherent in adjudication of two\nseparate proceedings are only limited by one‘s legal imagination.‖\n\n\n\n                                                8.\n\fAlcove Investment, Inc. (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 94, 101; Fitzhugh v. Granada Healthcare\n& Rehabilitation Center, LLC (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 469, 475 (Fitzhugh).)\nII.    Overview of Section 1281.2, Subdivision (c)\n       Section 1281.2, subdivision (c), provides that a petition to compel arbitration may\nbe denied if ―‗[a] party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court\naction or special proceeding with a third party, arising out of the same transaction or\nseries of related transactions and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common\nissue of law or fact.‘‖ In such cases, the trial court may in its discretion refuse to enforce\nthe arbitration agreement ―so that all issues between all parties are resolved in the judicial\nproceeding.‖ (Metis Development LLC v. Bohacek (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 679, 691\n(Metis) [paraphrasing § 1281.2, subd. (c)].)4 ―‗Section 1281.2[, subdivision ](c)\naddresses the peculiar situation that arises when a controversy also affects claims by or\nagainst other parties not bound by the arbitration agreement. The … provision giv[es] the\ncourt discretion not to enforce the arbitration agreement under such circumstances—in\norder to avoid potential inconsistency in outcome as well as duplication of effort .…‘‖\n(Cronus Investments, Inc. v. Concierge Services (2005) 35 Cal.4th 376, 393 [holding the\nprovision comports with policies favoring arbitration under federal law].)\n       ―While there is a strong public policy in favor of arbitration, there is an ‗equally\ncompelling argument that the Legislature has also authorized trial courts to refuse\nenforcement of an arbitration agreement [or stay the arbitration] when, as here, there is a\n\n\n4      Several alternatives are available under the statute where the possibility of\nconflicting rulings is found. The court ―(1) may refuse to enforce the arbitration\nagreement and may order intervention or joinder of all parties in a single action or special\nproceeding; (2) may order intervention or joinder as to all or only certain issues; (3) may\norder arbitration among the parties who have agreed to arbitration and stay the pending\ncourt action or special proceeding pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding; or\n(4) may stay arbitration pending the outcome of the court action or special proceeding.‖\n(§ 1281.2, subd. (c).)\n\n\n\n                                              9.\n\fpossibility of conflicting rulings. ([Code Civ. Proc.,] § 1281.2, subd. (c).)‘ [Citation.]‖\n(Fitzhugh, supra, 150 Cal.App.4th at p. 475.) That was precisely what the Legislature\nintended in enacting subdivision (c) of section 1281.2. (Whaley v. Sony Computer\nEntertainment America, Inc. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 479, 488 (Whaley).) Thus, a\ncontractual right to arbitrate ―may have to yield if there is an issue of law or fact common\nto the arbitration and a pending action or proceeding with a third party and there is a\npossibility of conflicting rulings thereon.‖ (Mercury Ins. Group v. Superior Court (1998)\n19 Cal.4th 332, 348.)\n       ―The issue to be addressed under section 1281.2, subdivision (c), … is not whether\ninconsistent rulings are inevitable but whether they are possible if arbitration is ordered.‖\n(Lindemann, supra, 204 Cal.App.4th at p. 567, italics added.) An evidentiary showing is\nnot necessary to establish this defense to enforcement of arbitration; the trial court may\nrely on the allegations in the relevant pleadings to decide whether a possibility of\ninconsistent rulings would exist. (Abaya v. Spanish Ranch I, L.P. (2010) 189\nCal.App.4th 1490, 1498-1499.)\nIII.   No Abuse of Discretion\n        A.    Trial Court Properly Found a Risk of Conflicting Rulings\n       In the matter before us, Lyons‘s pending civil action in the trial court was not\nlimited to the two parties to the arbitration agreement (Lyons and Fujitsu), but included\nclaims against third parties (SAP and Vistex) relating to the same transaction or series of\nrelated transactions (the purchase and implementation of SAP ERP software). Therefore,\nthe application of section 1281.2, subdivision (c), turned on the question of whether there\nwas ―a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact‖ if the\narbitration proceeded. (§ 1281, subd. (c); see Metis, supra, 200 Cal.App.4th at p. 691.)\n       One common issue was whether Fujitsu failed to adequately perform the software\nimplementation services as required under the Master Agreement. Certainly, it would be\nrelevant to each of the claims, regardless of the forum, whether Fujitsu adequately\n\n                                             10.\n\fperformed such services and satisfied its material obligations under that contract. Among\nother things, the matter of Lyons‘s damages, or at least the extent of Lyons‘s damages, if\nany, would appear to depend in large measure on this issue. Nevertheless, we think a\nbetter way of articulating the gist of the common issues would be in terms of causation:\nThat is, what was the cause, legally and factually, of the problems and delays in the\nimplementation of the software that led to Lyons‘s alleged damages? Deciding what\npersons and conduct caused the alleged events would be a relevant issue in both forums.\nAnd the issue could be resolved in a number of ways, as highlighted by the following\nseries of questions: Were the problems and delays (or some portion thereof) caused by\ninadequate performance by Fujitsu of the software implementation process constituting a\nbreach of contract? Were the problems and delays (or some portion thereof) due to\nVistex‘s alleged interference with Fujitsu‘s performance? Did the problems and delays\noccur because SAP and Fujitsu fraudulently represented to Lyons that Fujitsu could\nadequately perform the required implementation services? Was there a combination of\nsome or all of the above causes? And, as indicated presently below, these overlapping\nand intertwined issues clearly allow for the possibility of conflicting rulings.\n       The trial court appears to have analyzed the nature of the common issues in a\nsimilar fashion. As noted, in holding there was a possibility for conflicting rulings, the\ntrial court described the following potential scenario: ―Were the case to proceed to\narbitration first, Fujitsu could claim that it is not at fault for any of the problems that\noccurred, and that the fault, if any, lies with SAP and/or Vistex (or others). ]Thus], the\narbitrator could reasonably conclude that Fujitsu is not responsible, but non-parties SAP\nand/or Vistex are. [Lyons] receives no award, as SAP and Vistex are non-parties to the\narbitration (and have contended explicitly that they are not bound by the arbitrator‘s\nfindings). [¶] Lyons then proceeds to trial against SAP and/or Vistex, who then ‗point\nthe finger‘ at Fujitsu, which has already been absolved of liability by the arbitrator. The\njury agrees that Fujitsu is the liable party, and absolves SAP and Vistex of liability.\n\n                                              11.\n\fLyons winds up with no recovery, due to these inconsistent findings, after two complex\nproceedings and their associated costs.‖ Although the word ―fault‖ is perhaps technically\ninapt, at least to the extent a breach of contract was allegedly concerned, the thrust of the\ntrial court‘s explanation is correct.\n       Fujitsu insists that if arbitration were allowed to proceed, the issues would remain\ndistinct from the issues in the court action and that no conflicting rulings would result.\nWe disagree. As discussed above, common issues appear to be so intertwined and\ninterrelated that conflicting rulings are a real possibility, as ably explained in the trial\ncourt‘s order. While there may be scenarios in which this would not occur, the standard\nis not that conflicting rulings are inevitable, but only that they are possible. (Lindemann,\nsupra, 204 Cal.App.4th at p. 567.) Moreover, the question before us—as the reviewing\ncourt—is whether the trial court‘s order denying arbitration amounted to a clear abuse of\ndiscretion by going beyond the bounds of reason under the circumstances. Fujitsu has\nfailed to demonstrate that such was the case here. In Lindemann, where a similar\nargument was raised, the Court of Appeal stated: ―Although the … defendants attempt to\nportray the issues in this case as discrete and segregable, we cannot say the trial court‘s\ncontrary conclusion exceeded the bounds of reason.‖ (Id. at p. 568.) We, likewise,\ncannot say on this record that the trial court‘s decision exceeded the bounds of reason.\n       Finally, Fujitsu makes the novel argument that because certain appellate cases\nengaged in (or noted that the trial court engaged in) a thorough or careful factual analysis\nof the issue of whether or not arbitration should be denied under section 1281.2,\nsubdivision (c) (see, e.g., Best Interiors, Inc. v. Millie & Severson, Inc. (2008) 161\nCal.App.4th 1320, 1329-1330; Whaley, supra, 121 Cal.App.4th at pp. 481-484, 488;\nLindemann, supra, 204 Cal.App.4th at p. 568; Birl v. Heritage Care, LLC (2009) 172\nCal.App.4th 1313, 1319), a similarly detailed level of analysis is required on all such\nmotions. Allegedly, the trial court‘s analysis here did not meet that heightened level of\nscrutiny or thoroughness. We reject this line of argument for several reasons. First, the\n\n                                              12.\n\ftrial court‘s order indicates the court did undertake a careful and reasoned analysis, and\nFujitsu has failed to demonstrate otherwise. Second, to the extent Fujitsu is trying to\nimpose an evidentiary requirement, the argument is misplaced because ―courts have\nroutinely relied on the allegations contained in the operative pleading to determine\nwhether there is the possibility of conflicting rulings within the meaning of\nsection 1281.2, subdivision (c).‖ (Abaya v. Spanish Ranch I, L.P., supra, 189\nCal.App.4th at p. 1499.) Third, none of the cases cited by Fujitsu specifically addressed\nthe issue of whether a particular level of detailed analysis was a requirement in such\ncases. Appellate opinions are not authority for issues that were not considered therein.\n(Ginns v. Savage (1964) 61 Cal.2d 520, 524, fn. 2; See’s Candy Shops, Inc. v. Superior\nCourt (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 889, 907.) Fujitsu mistakes or has lost sight of the real\nissue on appeal, which is whether the trial court abused its discretion on the record before\nus. As discussed herein, Fujitsu has failed to show that such an abuse of discretion\noccurred.\n        B.    Trial Court’s Order Did Not Contravene Policy Favoring Arbitration\n       Fujitsu contends the trial court‘s ruling contravened the strong public policy\nfavoring arbitration. (See Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 9.) Again, we\ndisagree. Although the law indeed favors arbitration, the Legislature has expressed\nanother public policy in section 1281.2, subdivision (c), that arbitration may be denied in\nthose situations where the conditions delineated in that subdivision are found to exist.\n―While there is a strong public policy in favor of arbitration, there is an ‗equally\ncompelling argument that the Legislature has also authorized trial courts to refuse\nenforcement of an arbitration agreement [or stay the arbitration] when, as here, there is a\npossibility of conflicting rulings. ([Code Civ. Proc.,] § 1281.2, subd. (c).)‘ [Citation.]‖\n(Fitzhugh, supra, 150 Cal.App.4th at p. 475.) That was the case here. Moreover, the\nSupreme Court has made it clear that a trial court‘s authority to deny arbitration under\nsection 1281.2, subdivision (c), is consistent with a broad public policy to encourage\n\n                                             13.\n\farbitration because it avoids the pitfall of potential inconsistent rulings and duplication of\neffort that might otherwise be thrust upon a party to an arbitration agreement in the\npeculiar situation described in subdivision (c). (Cronus Investments, Inc. v. Concierge\nServices, supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 393 [holding that § 1281.2, subd. (c), does not conflict\nwith strong policy of federal law to promote contractual arbitration].) For all of these\nreasons, we reject Fujitsu‘s contention that the trial court‘s order violated the public\npolicy favoring arbitration.\n       C.     Demurrer Ruling Did Not Mandate a Different Result\n       Fujitsu suggests that because the trial court sustained SAP‘s demurrer to the sixth\ncause of action for civil conspiracy, it eliminated any grounds for concluding there were\ncommon issues of law or fact. Fujitsu has failed to provide adequate legal discussion and\nauthority to support the argument that conspiracy claims were necessary to finding a\ncommon issue; therefore, we treat that perfunctory claim as abandoned. (People v.\nStanley (1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 793; People v. Gionis (1995) 9 Cal.4th 1196, 1214, fn. 11;\nLandry v. Berryessa Union School Dist. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 691, 699-700; Golden\nDay Schools, Inc. v. Department of Education (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 681, 695, fn. 9.) In\nany event, Fujitsu has misinterpreted the effect of the demurrer ruling. On March 8,\n2012, three weeks prior to its ruling on the petition to compel arbitration, the trial court\nheard and decided a demurrer filed by SAP to Lyons‘s complaint. SAP‘s demurrer to the\nsixth cause of action (for civil conspiracy) was sustained without leave on the sole ground\nthat civil conspiracy is not an independent cause of action. That is, conspiracy could not\nbe alleged as though it were a new or additional cause of action distinct from the\nunderlying tort causes of action alleged in the complaint. Contrary to Fujitsu‘s claim, the\ntrial court did not hold that no basis for conspiracy liability existed under the allegations,\nbut only that it was not an additional or independent cause of action.\n\n\n\n\n                                              14.\n\f       D.     Trial Court’s Order and Analysis Were Sufficient\n       Fujitsu argues the trial court‘s statement of decision was insufficient because it did\nnot address each of the alternatives available under section 1281.2, subdivision (c). (See\nfn. 4, ante [stating the options available to the trial court under § 1281.2, subd. (c)].) To\nsupport this argument, Fujitsu relies on Metis. In Metis, the trial court denied a petition\nto compel arbitration and then refused a timely request to prepare a statement of decision.\nThe trial court‘s brief written order in that case merely stated the bare conclusion that the\npetitioner waived its right to arbitrate under section 1281.2, subdivision (a), and that there\nwas a risk of inconsistent rulings under section 1281.2, subdivision (c). No explanation\nwas provided. (Metis, supra, 200 Cal.App.4th at pp. 685-686, 691-693.) The petitioner\nappealed and the Court of Appeal held: (1) a statement of decision was required and\n(2) the trial court‘s order was inadequate. (Id. at pp. 689-693.) As to the order itself, the\nCourt of Appeal lamented, ―we are given no idea by the court‘s order‖ what the common\nissues were. (Id. at pp. 691-692.) In addition, the Court of Appeal stated that the trial\ncourt‘s order should have indicated why the existence of the potential for conflicting\nrulings ―should lead to the denial of arbitration, rather than one of the other alternatives\nset forth in the statute.‖ (Id. at p. 690.) We believe the latter comment is best understood\nin light of the complete absence of any contextual information or explanation in the order\nunder consideration there.\n       In any event, our case is plainly distinguishable from Metis. Here, the trial court‘s\norder (entitled decision and order after hearing) adequately set forth the legal and factual\nbasis for its ruling (§ 632), including a discussion of the significant potential for\nconflicting rulings. The order expressly recited the alternatives available under\nsection 1281.2, subdivision (c). It elaborated on why adjudicating the issues in two\nseparate or consecutive proceedings would not be best—i.e., that approach would create a\npotential for conflicting rulings. Moreover, just before the order stated the conclusion\nthat arbitration was being denied, it quoted with approval the language of a recent case\n\n                                              15.\n\fthat had affirmed the denial of arbitration pursuant to section 1281.2, subdivision (c).\nThe quoted language, taken from Lindemann, stated in essence that the denial of\narbitration in that case was being affirmed because (1) there was a possibility of\nconflicting rulings if arbitration was ordered and (2) it was reasonable for the trial court\nto conclude that ―the entire case should be resolved in a single litigation.‖ (Lindemann,\nsupra, 204 Cal.App.4th at p. 568.) The quoted language, set forth where it was in the\norder‘s discussion, clearly reflected that the trial court was following that same rationale\nhere. In context and read as a whole, we believe the order adequately reflected that\narbitration was being denied (that is, that outcome was being selected over the other\nalternatives) because there was a possibility of conflicting rulings if arbitration was\nordered and, further, the joinder of all the parties in a single litigation was a reasonable\nand appropriate means of avoiding the conflicting rulings and efficiently resolving the\nentire controversy. Accordingly, Fujitsu‘s argument that the trial court‘s order was\ninsufficient is unavailing.5\n       E.     Enjoining the Arbitration\n       We have held the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Fujitsu‘s\npetition to compel arbitration. The trial court‘s order not only denied Fujitsu‘s petition, it\nalso granted Lyons‘s concurrent motion for a preliminary injunction to stop Fujitsu‘s\nalready initiated arbitration proceedings from going forward. Fujitsu argues the trial\ncourt did not engage in the traditional balancing of all the equities prior to issuing the\npreliminary injunction. The argument is misplaced because the proper analysis to be\n\n\n5      Additionally, Fujitsu has not shown by citation to the record that it objected to the\nsufficiency of the statement of decision in the trial court, and there is nothing in the court\nregister to show that any such objection or request for clarification was ever made.\nWhere there is a failure to properly object in the trial court, the matter is waived. (In re\nMarriage of Arceneaux (1990) 51 Cal.3d 1130, 1132, 1138.) We conclude waiver\nconstitutes an alternative basis for rejecting Fujitsu‘s challenge on this issue.\n\n\n\n                                              16.\n\fundertaken by the trial court was under section 1281.2, subdivision (c), which the trial\ncourt adequately performed. The several options in that statute included the denial of a\npetition to compel arbitration, which in this case functioned as the practical equivalent of\nstopping the arbitration from going forward. (See, e.g., Melchor Investment Co. v. Rolm\nSystems (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 587, 591-592 [order denying a preliminary injunction\nagainst arbitration is tantamount to an order compelling arbitration]; International Film\nInvestors v. Arbitration Tribunal of Directors Guild (1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 699, 704 [―a\njudgment denying such petition is the practical equivalent of an order to compel\narbitration‖].) Whether or not a separate order enjoining the arbitration was necessary or\nmerely superfluous, Lyons plainly requested that order as a defense to allowing the\narbitration commenced by Fujitsu with the AAA from proceeding in light of the problem\nof conflicting rulings. (See Southeast Resource Recovery v. Montenay Intern. (9th Cir.\n1992) 973 F.2d 711, 713 [applying California law, noting that an action for injunction\nagainst arbitration is essentially a defense to a petition to compel arbitration].) The\nproper analysis, therefore, was pursuant to section 1281.2, subdivision (c). Fujitsu has\nfailed to show any abuse of discretion or any prejudice in regard to the preliminary\ninjunction.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The order of the trial court is affirmed. Costs on appeal are awarded to Lyons.\n\n\n                                                                  _____________________\n                                                                                 Kane, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\n_____________________\nWiseman, Acting P.J.\n\n _____________________\nDetjen, J.\n\n\n\n                                             17.\n\f",

(Fujitsu) appeals from the denial of its petition to\ncompel arbitration of a dispute that arose with plaintiff Lyons Magnus, Inc. (Lyons).\nLyons had retained Fujitsu to install and implement ―Enterprise Resource Planning‖ (or\nERP) business software produced and sold by SAP America, Inc. (SAP). The software\npackage included a special module known as ―Tradespend Management‖ (Tradespend)\ndeveloped by Vistex, Inc. (Vistex) for use in SAP‘s ERP software. During the software\nimplementation process, a controversy arose regarding the proper timing to implement\nportions of Tradespend. Significant delays and other problems followed, and Lyons\neventually filed a complaint in the trial court against Fujitsu, SAP and Vistex alleging\nvarious theories of tort and contract liability. Meanwhile, Fujitsu commenced an\narbitration proceeding against Lyons only. The contract between Fujitsu and Lyons\nprovided for arbitration of disputes, but SAP and Vistex were not subject to that\nprovision and they were unwilling to arbitrate.\n       Fujitsu filed a petition to compel Lyons to arbitrate under Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 1281.2.1 Lyons opposed the petition and also sought to enjoin or stay the\narbitration proceedings. Lyons argued that if the arbitration were allowed to proceed in\nthe absence of all of the parties, there was a substantial risk of conflicting rulings. The\ntrial court agreed with Lyons‘s assessment and denied the petition to compel arbitration\nbased on section 1281.2, subdivision (c). Under that subdivision, a petition may be\ndenied if ―[a] party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action\n… with a third party, arising out of the same transaction or series of related transactions\nand there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.‖ Fujitsu\nargues on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion because, allegedly, conflicting\nrulings could not possibly have occurred. Fujitsu, however, falls short of demonstrating\n\n1     Unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the Code of Civil\nProcedure.\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\fthat premise. Moreover, we conclude the trial court‘s decision was well within its\nreasonable discretion under the circumstances. Accordingly, the order is affirmed.\n                        FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n         Fujitsu was a provider of information technology products and services. Fujitsu\nwas designated by SAP as one of its global technology partners and had collaborated with\nSAP in installing and customizing SAP software for over three decades. SAP‘s software\nproducts included ERP software. The purpose of ERP software was to improve business\noperations by streamlining existing processes and improving visibility into business\noperations using a unified suite of software applications that are integrated into existing\nbusiness software systems.\n         In 2009, Lyons decided it would update its information technology by obtaining\nERP software. After reviewing the available versions of such software on the market,\nLyons decided to purchase ERP software from SAP. In Lyons‘s perspective, one feature\nthat set SAP‘s ERP software apart from others was its inclusion of Tradespend by Vistex.\nTradespend was a special software module that dealt with customer discounts and\nrebates, which represented an important portion of Lyons‘s business.\n         Having decided to purchase SAP‘s ERP software, it was necessary for Lyons to\ndetermine which company should be hired to implement the software. SAP\nrecommended Fujitsu as a company that had the qualified personnel and experience\nnecessary to implement all aspects of the ERP software. On August 25, 2009, Lyons and\nFujitsu entered into a master agreement for the supply of equipment, software and\nservices (the Master Agreement), pursuant to which Fujitsu was to provide professional\ntechnology consulting services to install and implement the SAP ERP software for\nLyons.\n         Since SAP ERP software must be individually tailored to specific business\noperations and integrated into existing systems, the implementation of the software can\nbe extremely involved and complex. Fujitsu and Lyons agreed that the implementation\n\n                                             3.\n\fprocess would occur in accordance with a three-phase schedule set forth in a statement of\nwork, which was an attachment to the Master Agreement. The phases were described as\nphases 1A, 1B, and 1C. During each phase, only certain software modules or\napplications were to be implemented at that time, as set forth in the statement of work.\n       Fujitsu began implementing phase 1A in October 2009, and that phase was\nsuccessfully completed ahead of schedule. However, difficulties began to arise during\nthe next phase—phase 1B—of the implementation process. There were disagreements\nover how soon Fujitsu should implement portions of Vistex‘s Tradespend module.\nApparently, Vistex‘s employees strongly disagreed with Fujitsu‘s employees on that\nissue. The disagreements reached a level of discord that Vistex employees allegedly\nthreatened Fujitsu staff while the latter attempted to implement Tradespend. The\ncontroversy led to substantial delays and, according to Lyons, other problems or defects\nwere encountered as well.\nLawsuit in Superior Court\n       On September 21, 2011, Lyons filed its lawsuit in the trial court naming Fujitsu,\nSAP and Vistex as defendants. The complaint stated general allegations common to all\ncauses of action, which we briefly summarize here. SAP and Fujitsu expressly\nrepresented to Lyons that Fujitsu was qualified and able to provide Lyons with the\nservices needed to successfully implement the SAP ERP, including the Tradespend\nmodule developed by Vistex. In reliance on said representations, Lyons entered into the\nMaster Agreement with Fujitsu to implement the SAP ERP software. Allegedly, as soon\nas Fujitsu sent individuals to Lyons‘s facility to implement the software, it became\napparent that there were problems and Fujitsu was having difficulty completing the\nimplementation of Tradespend. In particular, a conflict allegedly developed in regard to\nthe implementation of Tradespend, resulting in Vistex staff threatening Fujitsu staff and\nindividuals leaving the Lyons‘s implementation. According to Lyons‘s complaint, after\n\n\n\n                                            4.\n\fsubstantial delays and other problems persisted, it became apparent to Lyons that Fujitsu\nwas not going to complete the implementation of the software.\n       Based on these and other allegations, the complaint alleged breach of contract\nclaims against Fujitsu and SAP, including a first cause of action for rescission and a ninth\ncause of action for breach of contract. The complaint also contained a number of causes\nof action premised on alleged tortious conduct, including a second cause of action for\nfraud–intentional misrepresentation against Fujitsu and SAP; a third cause of action for\nfraud–intentional concealment against Fujitsu and SAP; a fourth cause of action for\nviolation of Business and Professions Code section 17200 against Fujitsu and SAP; a\nfifth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation against Fujitsu and SAP; a sixth\ncause of action for conspiracy to defraud against ―all‖ defendants (i.e., Fujitsu, SAP and\nVistex); a seventh cause of action for intentional interference with contract against\nVistex; and an eighth cause of action for negligent interference with prospective\neconomic relations against Vistex.\nArbitration Proceedings\n       In the Master Agreement between Fujitsu and Lyons, it provided that ―[a]ny\ncontroversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled before one\narbitrator by binding arbitration in Santa Clara County, California under the auspices of\nthe American Arbitration Association (‗AAA‘) .…‖ On November 29, 2011, Fujitsu\ninitiated arbitration proceedings by filing a demand for arbitration (the Demand) with the\nAAA.2 The Demand stated Fujitsu‘s single cause of action against Lyons for breach of\ncontract. According to the Demand, Lyons failed to pay Fujitsu for a substantial portion\nof the work it had performed under the Master Agreement. Furthermore, the Demand\nalleged Lyons began insisting that certain software modules be installed in the second\n\n2       Fujitsu was formally served with Lyons‘s complaint and summons about one week\nlater, on December 8, 2011.\n\n\n\n                                             5.\n\fphase of implementation, even though such work was (allegedly) not scheduled to be\ndone until the last phase in the statement of work. Lyons refused to cooperate with\nFujitsu in developing a revised statement of work to provide for such changes or\nmodifications using a formal change-order process. Instead, Lyons simply demanded\nsuch changes and then, later, ceased paying Fujitsu. Fujitsu continued to complete\nphase 1B for approximately two months and offered proposals to accommodate Lyons‘s\nchanges. When it became apparent that Lyons would not cooperate or pay amounts\nowed, the contract was terminated. The total amount that Lyons allegedly owed Fujitsu\nwas approximately $1.2 million for services performed on phase 1B of the software\nimplementation.\nTrial Court Proceedings\n       On December 21, 2011, Lyons filed a motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin\nor stay the arbitration proceedings initiated by Fujitsu. The motion was made on the\nground that Lyons‘s claims against Fujitsu were intertwined with related claims against\nthird parties SAP and Vistex, and it was therefore necessary for all of the claims to be\nadjudicated together with all of the parties in a single action in the superior court in order\nto avoid inconsistent findings of fact or law. For this reason, Lyons asked the trial court\nto enjoin or stay the arbitration proceedings.\n       On January 9, 2012, Fujitsu filed its petition to compel Lyons to arbitrate before\nthe AAA and to stay the pending litigation under section 1281.2. The petition argued that\nLyons should be ordered to arbitrate all disputes between it and Fujitsu in accordance\nwith the agreement to arbitrate set forth in the Master Agreement. Fujitsu further argued\nthat Lyons‘s claims against third parties SAP and Vistex could be adjudicated afterwards,\nseparately and efficiently, without any risk of conflicting rulings. Both SAP and Vistex\nfiled joinders in Fujitsu‘s petition to compel arbitration and stay the litigation because\nthey preferred that Fujitsu and Lyons arbitrate in advance of the trial court litigation,\nsince it might help to resolve or simplify the issues in the litigation.\n\n                                               6.\n\f         On February 8, 2012, Lyons filed its opposition to the petition to compel\narbitration. The opposition reiterated Lyons‘s position that because its pending lawsuit\ninvolved third parties (SAP and Vistex) against whom Lyons asserted causes of action\nthat were related to and intertwined with its dispute against Fujitsu, the only way to avoid\nthe risk of conflicting rulings was to have the entire controversy, including the claims\nagainst SAP and Vistex, heard in a single forum in the trial court. Accordingly, under\nsection 1281.2, subdivision (c), Lyons urged the trial court to deny Fujitsu‘s petition.\n         Fujitsu‘s petition to compel arbitration and Lyons‘s motion to enjoin or stay\narbitration were both heard together on February 23, 2012. Following oral argument, the\ntrial court took the petition and motion under submission.\n         On March 8, 2012, the trial court heard and decided a demurrer filed by SAP to\nLyons‘s complaint. SAP‘s demurrer to the first cause of action (for rescission) was\nsustained on the ground that the cause of action was duplicative of the cause of action for\nbreach of contract pled in the complaint. Similarly, SAP‘s demurrer to the sixth cause of\naction (for civil conspiracy) was sustained on the ground that civil conspiracy was not an\nindependent cause of action separate from the tort causes of action alleged in the\ncomplaint. The trial court did not hold that no basis for conspiracy liability existed, but\nonly that it was not a stand-alone or independent cause of action.\n         On March 28, 2012, the trial court issued its written order deciding Fujitsu‘s\npetition to compel arbitration and Lyons‘s motion to enjoin or stay the arbitration. The\ntrial court agreed with Lyons‘s position that there was a risk of inconsistent rulings if the\narbitration proceeded and so it denied Fujitsu‘s petition to compel arbitration and granted\nLyons‘s motion to enjoin arbitration. The trial court relied on the discretion conferred on\nit by section 1281.2, subdivision (c), to the effect that a court ―may refuse to compel\narbitration where a controversy affects claims by other parties not bound by the\narbitration agreement and arbitration risks conflicting rulings on common issues of law or\nfact.‖\n\n                                              7.\n\f       In its written order, the trial court summarized a scenario in which conflicting\nrulings might occur: ―Were the case to proceed to arbitration first, Fujitsu could claim\nthat it is not at fault for any of the problems that occurred, and that the fault, if any, lies\nwith SAP and/or Vistex (or others). [Thus], the arbitrator could reasonably conclude that\nFujitsu is not responsible, but non-parties SAP and/or Vistex are. [Lyons] receives no\naward, as SAP and Vistex are non-parties to the arbitration (and have contended\nexplicitly that they are not bound by the arbitrator‘s findings). [¶] Lyons then proceeds\nto trial against SAP and/or Vistex, who then ‗point the finger‘ at Fujitsu, which has\nalready been absolved of liability by the arbitrator. The jury agrees that Fujitsu is the\nliable party, and absolves SAP and Vistex of liability.

An evidentiary showing is\nnot necessary to establish this defense to enforcement of arbitration; the trial court may\nrely on the allegations in the relevant pleadings to decide whether a possibility of\ninconsistent rulings would exist.

Trial Court Properly Found a Risk of Conflicting Rulings\n       In the matter before us, Lyons‘s pending civil action in the trial court was not\nlimited to the two parties to the arbitration agreement (Lyons and Fujitsu), but included\nclaims against third parties (SAP and Vistex) relating to the same transaction or series of\nrelated transactions (the purchase and implementation of SAP ERP software). Therefore,\nthe application of section 1281.2, subdivision (c), turned on the question of whether there\nwas ―a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact‖ if the\narbitration proceeded. (§ 1281, subd. (c); see Metis, supra, 200 Cal.App.4th at p. 691.)\n       One common issue was whether Fujitsu failed to adequately perform the software\nimplementation services as required under the Master Agreement. Certainly, it would be\nrelevant to each of the claims, regardless of the forum, whether Fujitsu adequately\n\n                                             10.\n\fperformed such services and satisfied its material obligations under that contract. Among\nother things, the matter of Lyons‘s damages, or at least the extent of Lyons‘s damages, if\nany, would appear to depend in large measure on this issue. Nevertheless, we think a\nbetter way of articulating the gist of the common issues would be in terms of causation:\nThat is, what was the cause, legally and factually, of the problems and delays in the\nimplementation of the software that led to Lyons‘s alleged damages? Deciding what\npersons and conduct caused the alleged events would be a relevant issue in both forums.\nAnd the issue could be resolved in a number of ways, as highlighted by the following\nseries of questions: Were the problems and delays (or some portion thereof) caused by\ninadequate performance by Fujitsu of the software implementation process constituting a\nbreach of contract? Were the problems and delays (or some portion thereof) due to\nVistex‘s alleged interference with Fujitsu‘s performance? Did the problems and delays\noccur because SAP and Fujitsu fraudulently represented to Lyons that Fujitsu could\nadequately perform the required implementation services? Was there a combination of\nsome or all of the above causes? And, as indicated presently below, these overlapping\nand intertwined issues clearly allow for the possibility of conflicting rulings.\n       The trial court appears to have analyzed the nature of the common issues in a\nsimilar fashion. As noted, in holding there was a possibility for conflicting rulings, the\ntrial court described the following potential scenario: ―Were the case to proceed to\narbitration first, Fujitsu could claim that it is not at fault for any of the problems that\noccurred, and that the fault, if any, lies with SAP and/or Vistex (or others). ]Thus], the\narbitrator could reasonably conclude that Fujitsu is not responsible, but non-parties SAP\nand/or Vistex are. [Lyons] receives no award, as SAP and Vistex are non-parties to the\narbitration (and have contended explicitly that they are not bound by the arbitrator‘s\nfindings). [¶] Lyons then proceeds to trial against SAP and/or Vistex, who then ‗point\nthe finger‘ at Fujitsu, which has already been absolved of liability by the arbitrator. The\njury agrees that Fujitsu is the liable party, and absolves SAP and Vistex of liability.\n\n                                              11.\n\fLyons winds up with no recovery, due to these inconsistent findings, after two complex\nproceedings and their associated costs.‖ Although the word ―fault‖ is perhaps technically\ninapt, at least to the extent a breach of contract was allegedly concerned, the thrust of the\ntrial court‘s explanation is correct.\n       Fujitsu insists that if arbitration were allowed to proceed, the issues would remain\ndistinct from the issues in the court action and that no conflicting rulings would result.\nWe disagree. As discussed above, common issues appear to be so intertwined and\ninterrelated that conflicting rulings are a real possibility, as ably explained in the trial\ncourt‘s order. While there may be scenarios in which this would not occur, the standard\nis not that conflicting rulings are inevitable, but only that they are possible. (Lindemann,\nsupra, 204 Cal.App.4th at p. 567.) Moreover, the question before us—as the reviewing\ncourt—is whether the trial court‘s order denying arbitration amounted to a clear abuse of\ndiscretion by going beyond the bounds of reason under the circumstances. Fujitsu has\nfailed to demonstrate that such was the case here. In Lindemann, where a similar\nargument was raised, the Court of Appeal stated: ―Although the … defendants attempt to\nportray the issues in this case as discrete and segregable, we cannot say the trial court‘s\ncontrary conclusion exceeded the bounds of reason.‖ (Id. at p. 568.) We, likewise,\ncannot say on this record that the trial court‘s decision exceeded the bounds of reason.\n       Finally, Fujitsu makes the novel argument that because certain appellate cases\nengaged in (or noted that the trial court engaged in) a thorough or careful factual analysis\nof the issue of whether or not arbitration should be denied under section 1281.2,\nsubdivision (c) (see, e.g., Best Interiors, Inc. v. Millie & Severson, Inc. (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2304283\"><a href=\"/opinion/2304283/best-interiors-inc-v-millie-and-severson-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1313</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1319), a similarly detailed level of analysis is required on all such\nmotions. Allegedly, the trial court‘s analysis here did not meet that heightened level of\nscrutiny or thoroughness. We reject this line of argument for several reasons. First, the\n\n                                              12.\n\ftrial court‘s order indicates the court did undertake a careful and reasoned analysis, and\nFujitsu has failed to demonstrate otherwise. Second, to the extent Fujitsu is trying to\nimpose an evidentiary requirement, the argument is misplaced because ―courts have\nroutinely relied on the allegations contained in the operative pleading to determine\nwhether there is the possibility of conflicting rulings within the meaning of\nsection 1281.2, subdivision (c).‖ (Abaya v. Spanish Ranch I, L.P., supra, 189\nCal.App.4th at p. 1499.) Third, none of the cases cited by Fujitsu specifically addressed\nthe issue of whether a particular level of detailed analysis was a requirement in such\ncases. Appellate opinions are not authority for issues that were not considered therein.\n(Ginns v. Savage (1964) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 524, fn. 2; See’s Candy Shops, Inc. v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 907.) Fujitsu mistakes or has lost sight of the real\nissue on appeal, which is whether the trial court abused its discretion on the record before\nus. As discussed herein, Fujitsu has failed to show that such an abuse of discretion\noccurred.\n        B.    Trial Court’s Order Did Not Contravene Policy Favoring Arbitration\n       Fujitsu contends the trial court‘s ruling contravened the strong public policy\nfavoring arbitration. (See Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182211/moncharsh-v-heily-blase/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9.) Again, we\ndisagree. Although the law indeed favors arbitration, the Legislature has expressed\nanother public policy in section 1281.2, subdivision (c), that arbitration may be denied in\nthose situations where the conditions delineated in that subdivision are found to exist.\n―While there is a strong public policy in favor of arbitration, there is an ‗equally\ncompelling argument that the Legislature has also authorized trial courts to refuse\nenforcement of an arbitration agreement [or stay the arbitration] when, as here, there is a\npossibility of conflicting rulings. ([Code Civ. Proc.,] § 1281.2, subd. (c).)‘ [Citation.]‖\n(Fitzhugh, supra, 150 Cal.App.4th at p. 475.) That was the case here. Moreover, the\nSupreme Court has made it clear that a trial court‘s authority to deny arbitration under\nsection 1281.2, subdivision (c), is consistent with a broad public policy to encourage\n\n                                             13.\n\farbitration because it avoids the pitfall of potential inconsistent rulings and duplication of\neffort that might otherwise be thrust upon a party to an arbitration agreement in the\npeculiar situation described in subdivision (c). (Cronus Investments, Inc. v. Concierge\nServices, supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 393 [holding that § 1281.2, subd. (c), does not conflict\nwith strong policy of federal law to promote contractual arbitration].) For all of these\nreasons, we reject Fujitsu‘s contention that the trial court‘s order violated the public\npolicy favoring arbitration.\n       C.     Demurrer Ruling Did Not Mandate a Different Result\n       Fujitsu suggests that because the trial court sustained SAP‘s demurrer to the sixth\ncause of action for civil conspiracy, it eliminated any grounds for concluding there were\ncommon issues of law or fact. Fujitsu has failed to provide adequate legal discussion and\nauthority to support the argument that conspiracy claims were necessary to finding a\ncommon issue; therefore, we treat that perfunctory claim as abandoned. (People v.\nStanley (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1213708\"><a href=\"/opinion/1213708/people-v-stanley/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 793; People v.

On March 8,\n2012, three weeks prior to its ruling on the petition to compel arbitration, the trial court\nheard and decided a demurrer filed by SAP to Lyons‘s complaint. SAP‘s demurrer to the\nsixth cause of action (for civil conspiracy) was sustained without leave on the sole ground\nthat civil conspiracy is not an independent cause of action. That is, conspiracy could not\nbe alleged as though it were a new or additional cause of action distinct from the\nunderlying tort causes of action alleged in the complaint. Contrary to Fujitsu‘s claim, the\ntrial court did not hold that no basis for conspiracy liability existed under the allegations,\nbut only that it was not an additional or independent cause of action.\n\n\n\n\n                                              14.\n\f       D.     Trial Court’s Order and Analysis Were Sufficient\n       Fujitsu argues the trial court‘s statement of decision was insufficient because it did\nnot address each of the alternatives available under section 1281.2, subdivision (c). (See\nfn. 4, ante [stating the options available to the trial court under § 1281.2, subd. (c)].) To\nsupport this argument, Fujitsu relies on Metis. In Metis, the trial court denied a petition\nto compel arbitration and then refused a timely request to prepare a statement of decision.\nThe trial court‘s brief written order in that case merely stated the bare conclusion that the\npetitioner waived its right to arbitrate under section 1281.2, subdivision (a), and that there\nwas a risk of inconsistent rulings under section 1281.2, subdivision (c). No explanation\nwas provided. (Metis, supra, 200 Cal.App.4th at pp. 685-686, 691-693.) The petitioner\nappealed and the Court of Appeal held: (1) a statement of decision was required and\n(2) the trial court‘s order was inadequate. (Id. at pp. 689-693.) As to the order itself, the\nCourt of Appeal lamented, ―we are given no idea by the court‘s order‖ what the common\nissues were. (Id. at pp. 691-692.) In addition, the Court of Appeal stated that the trial\ncourt‘s order should have indicated why the existence of the potential for conflicting\nrulings ―should lead to the denial of arbitration, rather than one of the other alternatives\nset forth in the statute.‖ (Id. at p. 690.) We believe the latter comment is best understood\nin light of the complete absence of any contextual information or explanation in the order\nunder consideration there.\n       In any event, our case is plainly distinguishable from Metis. Here, the trial court‘s\norder (entitled decision and order after hearing) adequately set forth the legal and factual\nbasis for its ruling (§ 632), including a discussion of the significant potential for\nconflicting rulings. The order expressly recited the alternatives available under\nsection 1281.2, subdivision (c). It elaborated on why adjudicating the issues in two\nseparate or consecutive proceedings would not be best—i.e., that approach would create a\npotential for conflicting rulings. Moreover, just before the order stated the conclusion\nthat arbitration was being denied, it quoted with approval the language of a recent case\n\n                                              15.\n\fthat had affirmed the denial of arbitration pursuant to section 1281.2, subdivision (c).\nThe quoted language, taken from Lindemann, stated in essence that the denial of\narbitration in that case was being affirmed because (1) there was a possibility of\nconflicting rulings if arbitration was ordered and (2) it was reasonable for the trial court\nto conclude that ―the entire case should be resolved in a single litigation.‖ (Lindemann,\nsupra, 204 Cal.App.4th at p. 568.) The quoted language, set forth where it was in the\norder‘s discussion, clearly reflected that the trial court was following that same rationale\nhere. In context and read as a whole, we believe the order adequately reflected that\narbitration was being denied (that is, that outcome was being selected over the other\nalternatives) because there was a possibility of conflicting rulings if arbitration was\nordered and, further, the joinder of all the parties in a single litigation was a reasonable\nand appropriate means of avoiding the conflicting rulings and efficiently resolving the\nentire controversy. Accordingly, Fujitsu‘s argument that the trial court‘s order was\ninsufficient is unavailing.5\n       E.     Enjoining the Arbitration\n       We have held the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Fujitsu‘s\npetition to compel arbitration. The trial court‘s order not only denied Fujitsu‘s petition, it\nalso granted Lyons‘s concurrent motion for a preliminary injunction to stop Fujitsu‘s\nalready initiated arbitration proceedings from going forward. Fujitsu argues the trial\ncourt did not engage in the traditional balancing of all the equities prior to issuing the\npreliminary injunction. The argument is misplaced because the proper analysis to be\n\n\n5      Additionally, Fujitsu has not shown by citation to the record that it objected to the\nsufficiency of the statement of decision in the trial court, and there is nothing in the court\nregister to show that any such objection or request for clarification was ever made.\nWhere there is a failure to properly object in the trial court, the matter is waived. (In re\nMarriage of Arceneaux (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2612381\"><a href=\"/opinion/2612381/in-re-marriage-of-arceneaux/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1132, 1138.) We conclude waiver\nconstitutes an alternative basis for rejecting Fujitsu‘s challenge on this issue.\n\n\n\n                                              16.\n\fundertaken by the trial court was under section 1281.2, subdivision (c), which the trial\ncourt adequately performed. The several options in that statute included the denial of a\npetition to compel arbitration, which in this case functioned as the practical equivalent of\nstopping the arbitration from going forward. (See, e.g., Melchor Investment Co. v. Rolm\nSystems (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2273245\"><a href=\"/opinion/2273245/melchor-investment-co-v-rolm-systems/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Whether or not a separate order enjoining the arbitration was necessary or\nmerely superfluous, Lyons plainly requested that order as a defense to allowing the\narbitration commenced by Fujitsu with the AAA from proceeding in light of the problem\nof conflicting rulings.
