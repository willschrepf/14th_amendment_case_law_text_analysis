Truth alleges violations of the Equal Access Act (the\nAct), the First Amendment rights of free speech and expres-\nsive association, the Free Exercise Clause, the Establishment\nClause, and the Equal Protection Clause. We have jurisdiction\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We affirm.\n\f10442           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n                               I.\n\n   This appeal arises from Truth’s attempt to form a student\nclub at Kentridge High School (Kentridge), which is part of\nthe Kent School District. Under the relevant policies at Ken-\ntridge, “[u]nchartered clubs are not permitted to exist.” To\nobtain a charter, students must submit a proposed charter to\nthe Associated Student Body (ASB) Council and secure\napproval.\n\n   Beginning in the fall semester of 2001, appellants Undis,\nthen a junior, and Stewart, then a sophomore, attempted to\nform a Bible club at Kentridge. Undis and Stewart submitted\na “Club Charter Application” (first charter) for official recog-\nnition as an ASB organization in September 2001. This first\ncharter indicated that the club’s name was to be “Truth” and\nthat the purpose of the organization was to “have a Bible\nstudy to encourage and help become better people with good\nmorals.” Under the section “Membership Criteria,” the first\ncharter indicated that the group was to be “[o]pen to anyone.”\nThe charter also proposed that it would designate a “quote of\nthe week for announcement” and “once a month decorate\n[the] school with a theme.”\n\n   The ASB Council discussed Truth’s first charter at a Sep-\ntember 2001 meeting, and several students objected to char-\ntering Truth. The ASB Council decided to consult with the\nAssistant Principal, appellee Eric Anderson. Anderson and\nappellee Mike Albrecht, Principal of Kentridge, later told\nUndis that they would speak with the school’s attorney\nregarding the legality of granting Truth ASB recognition.\nAlbrecht stated that “the problem with the September 2001\nproposal was that it involved broadcasting a weekly Bible\nquote over the school’s public address system and monthly\ndecoration of the school in a biblical theme.”\n\n  No action was taken on the first charter for the remainder\nof the 2001-02 school year. During that time, Undis asked\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT            10443\nAnderson to make a decision on Truth’s application on at\nleast ten occasions, to no avail. Sometime in the spring semes-\nter of 2002, all ASB clubs were instructed to resubmit their\ncharters. The record does not reveal any further activity on\nTruth’s application during the summer and fall semesters of\n2002.\n\n   During this period, we decided Prince v. Jacoby, which\ninvolved a request by a Bible club for ASB recognition in a\ndifferent Washington school district. 303 F.3d 1074 (9th Cir.\n2002). On January 7, 2003, an attorney for Truth, Robert\nTyler, wrote to Albrecht stating that it was “constitutionally\nimperative that [Kentridge] grant [appellants’] proposed Bible\nClub treatment and rights equal to all other noncurriculum\nclubs.” The letter also insisted that Kentridge “immediately\nadhere to the requirements of the Equal Access Act and the\nFirst Amendment,” and threatened litigation if Kentridge did\nnot comply.\n\n   On January 30, 2003, Tyler sent a second letter to Michael\nHarrington, counsel for the Kent School District. Tyler\nrequested the forms required to establish an ASB club, and\nthreatened litigation if Truth’s charter was not approved by\nFebruary 4.\n\n   On February 2, as requested by Anderson, Undis and Stew-\nart submitted a new application (second charter). The second\ncharter removed the quote-of-the-week and monthly theme\ndecoration provisions of the first charter. The club’s stated\npurpose was now to “provid[e] a biblically-based club for\nthose students interested in growing in their relationship with\nJesus Christ.” Although membership would be open to all stu-\ndents, the second charter restricted voting membership to\n“members professing belief in the Bible and in Jesus Christ.”\nOfficers would also be required to “believe in and be commit-\nted to biblical principles.”\n\n  After a third letter to Harrington from Tyler, the second\ncharter was discussed at an ASB Council meeting on March\n\f10444           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n27. Some students expressed disapproval of the club’s name,\nsuggesting that it “implies that every other religion at Ken-\ntridge is a lie.” Some council members also expressed con-\ncerns that granting the charter would violate “[c]hurch and\nstate” and that the voting membership should be open to\neveryone. Additionally, members suggested that students\ncould go to “Young Life,” a non-ASB recognized organiza-\ntion that met on Kentridge’s campus after school hours. The\nminutes of the March 27 meeting reveal that the question of\nwhether to approve the second charter was discussed for\ntwenty minutes. No vote was taken.\n\n   The second charter was next addressed at an ASB Council\nmeeting on April 1. After a brief clarification on the role of\nthe advisor for the club, the minutes show that Anderson\nstated that if the ASB Council voted to approve the charter,\nhe would consult the District’s attorneys and Kentridge would\nmake a final decision on approving the charter. The Counsel\nvoted eleven to six against approval of Truth’s second charter.\n\n   On April 3, Truth filed a complaint in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Washington, alleg-\ning that defendants had violated the Act, as well as the First\nAmendment rights of free speech and expressive association,\nthe Free Exercise Clause, the Establishment Clause, and the\nEqual Protection Clause. Truth sought injunctive and declara-\ntory relief as well as nominal damages.\n\n   On April 9, Anderson sent Stewart a letter informing her of\nher right to resubmit Truth’s application for ASB club recog-\nnition: “As was discussed at the ASB meeting on March 28th,\nby making minor changes to Article[s] I and III of the pro-\nposed Constitution for your club, you will address the points\nraised.” Article I sets forth the name of the club and Article\nIII contains the voting membership and officer restrictions.\nAnderson advised Stewart to “be prepared to resubmit by the\nApril 25th ASB Meeting.” Under the Kentridge ASB Consti-\ntution, “[a]ny rejected charters must be resubmitted within\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             10445\ntwo weeks of rejection with the required changes made or the\ncharter shall be permanently rejected.”\n\n   Stewart and Undis submitted the third charter on April 24.\nThe third charter maintains the proposed name “Truth.” How-\never, it divides the membership into three categories: voting\nmembers, non-voting members, and attendees. Meetings are\nopen to everyone. But the “privilege of membership is contin-\ngent upon the member complying in good faith with Christian\ncharacter, Christian speech, Christian behavior and Christian\nconduct as generally described in the Bible.” The charter\napplication also lists a “true desire to . . . grow in a relation-\nship with Jesus Christ” under the “Membership Criteria”\nheading. In order to be a voting member or officer, students\nare required to sign a “statement of faith.” The statement of\nfaith requires the person to affirm that he or she believes “the\nBible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative\nWord of God.” A member must also pledge that he or she\nbelieves “that salvation is an undeserved gift from God,” and\nthat only by “acceptance of Jesus Christ as my personal Sav-\nior, through His death on the cross for my sins, is my faith\nmade real.” Other than the ability to call oneself a “member,”\nthere is no difference between the rights of non-voting mem-\nbers and attendees.\n\n   The third charter was discussed at the April 25 ASB Coun-\ncil meeting. The ASB Council again objected to the name,\nselectivity provisions, and the presence of religion in school.\nThe council voted nineteen to zero to deny approval of the\ncharter, with one member undecided. The minutes give four\nreasons why the charter was not accepted: 1) “Name,” 2)\n“Pledge to vote,” 3) “Segregating,” 4) “Religious club in\nschool.”\n\n   On May 6, Tyler wrote to the Kent School District’s coun-\nsel stating that it was his “understanding from the ASB Con-\nstitution that this rejection by the ASB is the final decision.”\nThe letter also provided that Tyler “was unable to locate any\n\f10446            TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nrights to appeal the decision of the ASB,” but that if there\nwere “a right to appeal the decision of the ASB,” he asked\nthat the letter “serve as a formal request for appeal.”\n\n   Anderson advised Undis and Stewart in a May 12 letter\n“that pursuant to Kent School District Policy 2340, [they had]\nthe ability to discuss this matter with Mr. Albrecht,” and men-\ntioned the possibility of discussions with the District superin-\ntendent or the ombudservices office. Although Tyler’s May 6\nletter would appear to have invoked these processes, no fur-\nther action was taken by the District. Policy 2340 concerns\n“religious related activities or practices.” The policy does not\nrefer to ASB recognition, and the ASB Constitution does not\nrefer to this policy as providing an avenue for an appeal of the\nDistrict’s decisions, which are otherwise “final.”\n\n  Although Undis and Stewart have both graduated from\nKentridge, they have indicated that another student, Lindsay\nThomas, is prepared to assume leadership of the club if the\ncharter is approved.\n\n   The Kent School District has three policies relevant to this\nappeal. First, Policy 3210 provides that “[t]he district will\nprovide equal educational opportunity and treatment for all\nstudents in all aspects of the academic and activities program.\nEqual opportunity and treatment is provided without regard to\nrace, creed, color, national origin, sex, marital status, previous\narrest . . . , incarceration, or physical, sensory or mental dis-\nabilities.” The district court held that inclusion of “creed”\nindicates that discrimination based upon religion is prohibited.\nThat ruling has not been challenged on appeal.\n\n  Second, Policy 2153 provides for “noncurriculum-related,\nnon ASB student groups,” which groups the principal shall\napprove provided they meet several additional requirements.\nThe policy does not accord ASB privileges to Policy 2153\ngroups. The District states that Truth “is free to operate as a\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT              10447\nprivate Policy 2153 group,” but argues that Truth was prop-\nerly denied ASB recognition.\n\n   Third, Policy 2340P regulates “religious related activities\nor practices,” and provides guidelines for schools addressing\nreligious holidays, symbols, ceremonies, topics, activities, and\nbeliefs. This policy also provides that “[s]tudents, parents, and\nemployees who are aggrieved by practices or activities con-\nducted in the school or district may seek resolution of their\nconcern first with the building principal, then with the district\nsuperintendent or designee, or use ombudservices, which is\navailable through the Legal Services Department.”\n\n   Washington State also has a relevant non-discrimination\nlaw, which the District relies on to justify its denial of ASB\nrecognition for Truth. Washington Revised Code § 49.60.215\n(West 2006) provides that:\n\n    It shall be an unfair practice for any person or the\n    person’s agent or employee to commit an act which\n    directly or indirectly results in any distinction,\n    restriction, or discrimination, . . . or the refusing or\n    withholding from any person the admission, patron-\n    age, custom, presence, frequenting, dwelling, stay-\n    ing, or lodging in any place of public resort,\n    accommodation, assemblage, or amusement, except\n    for conditions and limitations established by law and\n    applicable to all persons, regardless of race, creed,\n    color, national origin, sexual orientation, sex, the\n    presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disabil-\n    ity, or the use of a trained dog guide or service ani-\n    mal by a disabled person.\n\nThe District has argued that these non-discrimination policies\nrequire it to deny ASB recognition to Truth.\n\n   As of April 3, 2003, there were thirty ASB-recognized\nclubs at Kentridge. There is no evidence of any Policy 2153\n\f10448            TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\ngroups at Kentridge. While the record does not contain the\ncharters of all the clubs, it appears that many of them have\nselective membership criteria, restricting membership based\non both beliefs and conduct. Indeed, each charter application\ncontains a section for “Membership Criteria.”\n\n   The Earth Corps, for example, requires members to show\n“interest and dedication toward environmental issues.” Simi-\nlarly, the Key Club requires that members be “interested in\nservice, qualified scholastically, of good character, possessing\nleadership potential . . . [and] willing to perform at least fifty\nhours of . . . service.” The Gay-Straight Alliance requires that\nstudents “must be willing to work towards the goals of the\nclub” to be members. These goals include “bring[ing]\nGLBTQ [Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgendered, and Ques-\ntioning] issues into the open, while working to decrease\nhomophobia.” Other goals include “changing stereotypes”\nand “fight[ing] heterosexism and other forms of oppression.”\nThe National Honor Society selects its members based on\n“outstanding scholarship, character, leadership, and service,”\nand requires them to “behave in a courteous and respectful\nmanner, refraining from language and actions that might bring\ndiscredit upon themselves.” It also requires members to\nrefrain from using or possessing alcohol or illegal substances.\nParticipation in school sports requires maintaining a certain\ngrade point average and attendance record, not using drugs or\nalcohol, and complying with the “sports code.” Finally, a\nMen’s Honor Club and a Girls Honor Club also operate at\nKentridge as ASB-recognized groups. Each club has gender-\nexclusive membership.\n\n   The district court entered summary judgment on all of\nTruth’s claims under Monell v. Department of Social Services,\n436 U.S. 658 (1978), with the exception of the Act claim. The\ncourt held that the requirements of municipal liability under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 were not satisfied, and therefore entered\nsummary judgment in favor of the District. It also held that\nthe actions against the individual defendants in their official\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             10449\ncapacities were functionally equivalent to suits directly\nagainst the municipality, and therefore Truth’s claims against\nthem failed.\n\n   The district court ruled on the merits of the Act and some\nof the First Amendment claims, addressing the latter as an\nalternate holding if its Monell ruling were to be reversed. It\nheld that the restrictions on general membership in the third\ncharter constituted a legitimate basis for denying the third\ncharter and that these claims therefore failed.\n\n   The district court did not rule on the remaining claims\nbased on its belief that “Plaintiffs’ cursory Equal Protection\nClause, Establishment Clause, and Free Exercise Clause argu-\nments are all subsumed within their First Amendment argu-\nment.” The district court also did not address the District’s\nargument that granting ASB recognition to Truth would vio-\nlate the Establishment Clause.\n\n  On appeal, both sides agree that only the third charter is\nbefore us. Truth makes this concession even though this\naction was filed before the third charter and its complaint only\naddresses the denial of its second charter.\n\n   This appeal requires us to review many determinations by\nthe district court. As to each issue, we review de novo. We\nreview a district court’s summary judgment de novo. See\nBuono v. Norton, 371 F.3d 543, 545 (9th Cir. 2004). In deter-\nmining whether summary judgment was appropriate, we view\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to Truth, the non-\nmoving party. See Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of Med., 363 F.3d\n916, 922 (9th Cir. 2004). “We may affirm on any ground sup-\nported by the record.” Id. We also review de novo the district\ncourt’s Monell rulings, see Doe v. Lebbos, 348 F.3d 820, 825\n(9th Cir. 2003), its “decision regarding the scope of a consti-\ntutional right,” see United States v. Napier, 436 F.3d 1133,\n1135-36 (9th Cir. 2006), and its interpretation of the Act, see\nSEC v. McCarthy, 322 F.3d 650, 654 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\f10450           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n                              II.\n\n   Before addressing the merits, we consider our jurisdiction.\nThe District argues that Truth lacks standing under City of Los\nAngeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983), because Truth has\nfailed to meet the “likelihood of recurrence” requirement. The\nDistrict asserts that Truth “cannot say the ASB or the District\nwill always deny another Club application or even the same\napplication.”\n\n  [1] In order to establish Article III standing,\n\n    a plaintiff must show (1) it has suffered an “injury in\n    fact” that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b)\n    actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical;\n    (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged\n    action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as\n    opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be\n    redressed by a favorable decision.\n\nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc., 528\nU.S. 167, 180-81 (2000). Although the District has not made\nany arguments regarding these specific factors, we have an\nindependent obligation to address whether we have subject-\nmatter jurisdiction. See Dittman v. California, 191 F.3d 1020,\n1025 (9th Cir. 1999). “[A]t the summary judgment stage the\nplaintiffs need not establish that they in fact have standing,\nbut only that there is a genuine question of material fact as to\nthe standing elements.” Cent. Delta Water Agency v. United\nStates, 306 F.3d 938, 947 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n   [2] With respect to injunctive relief, the Supreme Court has\nalso required that a plaintiff show that “he is realistically\nthreatened by a repetition of [the violation].” Lyons, 461 U.S.\nat 109. “The plaintiff need only establish that there is a rea-\nsonable expectation that his conduct will recur, triggering the\nalleged harm; he need not show that such recurrence is proba-\nble.” Jones v. City of Los Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118, 1127 (9th\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT              10451\nCir. 2006), citing Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 318 & n.6\n(1988). While we have extended this requirement to declara-\ntory relief, see Gest v. Bradbury, 443 F.3d 1177, 1181 (9th\nCir. 2006), it does not apply to monetary damages, see Lyons,\n461 U.S. at 105. The District’s standing argument therefore\ndoes not implicate Truth’s standing to seek nominal damages.\n\n   The District asserts that the Establishment Clause, state\nlaw, and its own non-discrimination policies mandate that it\ndeny ASB recognition to Truth. If the District believes that\nthree independent and binding legal authorities compel it to\ndeny Truth’s application, we do not see how the District\nmight approve the same or a similar charter request in the\nfuture.\n\n   [3] The District’s written non-discrimination policies also\nsupport Truth’s standing arguments. We have held that plain-\ntiffs “may demonstrate that an injury is likely to recur by\nshowing that the defendant had . . . a written policy, and that\nthe injury ‘stems from’ that policy. Where the harm alleged\nis directly traceable to a written policy there is an implicit\nlikelihood of its repetition in the immediate future.” Fortyune\nv. Am. Multi-Cinema, Inc., 364 F.3d 1075, 1081 (9th Cir.\n2004) (internal quotations and alterations omitted). Here, the\nharm is traceable to the District’s policies, which the District\nhas argued compel it to deny ASB recognition to Truth.\n\n   Additionally, despite Tyler’s request that the District treat\nhis letter as a “formal request for appeal,” the District took no\naction. This is evidence that another charter request is likely\nto meet the same fate as the previous three. Finally, the Dis-\ntrict has provided nothing beyond its own speculation that the\noutcome might be different if Truth submitted a fourth char-\nter. The legal positions it has taken in this litigation strongly\nsuggest that no similar applications will ever be approved.\n\n   [4] Under these circumstances, we conclude that Truth has\nestablished at least a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\f10452            TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nwhether there is a reasonable expectation that the alleged\ninjury will recur. Therefore, Truth has standing to seek each\nof its requested forms of relief.\n\n   The District also suggests that this dispute is not ripe for\nreview, and that we thus lack jurisdiction, because Truth did\nnot bring the dispute to the Kent School District Board or\nSuperintendent through Policy 2340P. The District is wrong.\nThe Supreme Court has explicitly held that exhaustion is not\nrequired for claims brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See Stef-\nfel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 472-73 (1974). Exhaustion\ncannot be dispositive under a ripeness analysis; otherwise\nripeness doctrine would impose a de facto exhaustion require-\nment, in violation of Steffel. Thus, the alleged failure to\nexhaust administrative remedies may be at most only a factor\nin the ripeness analysis.\n\n   [5] Nevertheless, it appears that Truth did exhaust the for-\nmal appeal system. Tyler’s May 6 letter to the District’s coun-\nsel asked that the letter “serve as a formal request for appeal.”\nThe District has not provided any reason why this notification\nwas not sufficient to trigger its appeals process, and no reason\nis apparent in the record. The District’s failure to take any\naction as a result of this request does not indicate that Truth\nfailed to bring the matter to the attention of the District. Under\nthese circumstances, there is at least a genuine issue of mate-\nrial fact as to whether Truth exhausted the District’s grievance\nprocedures.\n\n   Nearly every other factor suggests that this case is ripe for\ndecision. Under the Kentridge ASB Constitution, “[a]ny\nrejected charters must be resubmitted within two weeks of\nrejection with the required changes made or the charter shall\nbe permanently rejected.” The ASB Constitution does not\nprovide for any additional review, nor does it suggest that the\nASB Council’s decision lacked finality.\n\n  Furthermore, there is no doubt that the effects of the denial\nof Truth’s charter have been felt in a concrete way by the\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT              10453\nappellants. Truth’s members have experienced three denials\nof their applications, as well as protracted delays in obtaining\nany action from the ASB Council and District. The harm that\nTruth has complained of does not “rest[ ] upon contingent\nfuture events” or ones that “may not occur at all.” Texas v.\nUnited States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998). Instead, Truth com-\nplains of discrete events that have already occurred.\n\n   [6] Finally, “in evaluating ripeness, courts assess both the\nfitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to\nthe parties of withholding court consideration.” Ass’n of Am.\nMed. Colls. v. United States, 217 F.3d 770, 779-80 (9th Cir.\n2000) (internal quotation omitted). We conclude the hardship\nto Truth in denying adjudication outweighs the hardship to the\nDistrict in deciding this appeal. Truth’s application for ASB\nrecognition languished for nearly sixteen months without any\nsignificant action being taken, and the ASB process appears\nto have stalled until Truth obtained counsel and threatened to\nsue. More than five years have passed since the submission of\nthe first charter, and declining to decide this appeal now\nwould present a significant hardship to appellants.\n\n   [7] By contrast, the hardship to the District is significantly\nless severe. The District has been aware of Truth’s arguments\nfor a long time and has had ample opportunity to take correc-\ntive action or change its policies, if it so desired. Its legal\npositions on appeal show that it does not believe any remedial\naction is appropriate and that it believes the denial of ASB\nrecognition was proper. We therefore conclude that this case\nis ripe for decision.\n\n                              III.\n\n  [8] We must also consider the district court’s ruling that the\nrequirements of Monell are not met. Monell permits section\n1983 actions against municipalities, but requires plaintiffs to\nshow that their injuries resulted from “execution of a govern-\nment’s policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or\n\f10454           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nby those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent\nofficial policy.” 436 U.S. at 694. Monell’s requirements do\nnot apply where the plaintiffs only seek prospective relief,\nwhich is the case here. See Chaloux v. Killeen, 886 F.2d 247,\n250-51 (9th Cir. 1989). The District acknowledges the con-\ntrolling effect of Chaloux, but argues that it should be over-\nruled because it “rests on shaky grounds.”\n\n  [9] It is well established in our circuit that while\n\n    a three judge panel normally cannot overrule a deci-\n    sion of a prior panel on a controlling question of law,\n    we may overrule prior circuit authority without tak-\n    ing the case en banc when an intervening Supreme\n    Court decision undermines an existing precedent of\n    the Ninth Circuit, and both cases are closely on\n    point.\n\nGalbraith v. County of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119, 1123 (9th\nCir. 2002) (internal citation and quotations omitted). The Dis-\ntrict argues that two Supreme Court cases, Board of County\nCommissioners of Bryan County v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397\n(1997), and McMillian v. Monroe County, 520 U.S. 781\n(1997), show that the “Supreme Court has re-emphasized the\nimportance and vitality of the doctrine that requires a munici-\npal policy as a precondition to a lawsuit under § 1983.” Nei-\nther of these cases addresses whether Monell applies to\nactions only seeking prospective relief. We have no authority\nto overrule Chaloux. Chaloux applies, and the district court’s\nMonell ruling is reversed.\n\n                              IV.\n\n  Relying on its non-discrimination policies, the District\npoints to three aspects of Truth’s third charter that justify its\ndecision to deny the club ASB recognition: 1) the general\nmembership restrictions, 2) the leadership and voting mem-\nbership restrictions, and 3) the name “Truth.” We address the\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             10455\nfirst of these, holding that Truth’s general membership restric-\ntions violate the District’s non-discrimination policies and are\nnot protected by either the Act or the First Amendment.\n\n                               A.\n\n   [10] States have the constitutional authority to enact legis-\nlation prohibiting invidious discrimination. See Roberts v.\nUnited States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 624-26 (1984) (review-\ning the history of state anti-discrimination laws and observing\nthat a “State enjoys broad authority to create rights of public\naccess on behalf of its citizens”). Truth asserts that it does not\ndiscriminate based on religion in violation of the plain lan-\nguage of the District’s policies, but rather imposes a code of\nconduct not unlike those of other approved ASB clubs. Even\nassuming that non-Christians would be able to comply with\nTruth’s view of “Christian character, Christian speech, Chris-\ntian behavior and Christian conduct,” we hold that the\nrequirement that members possess a “true desire to . . . grow\nin a relationship with Jesus Christ” inherently excludes non-\nChristians.\n\n   [11] Having determined that the third charter violates the\nDistrict’s non-discrimination policies, we are led to hold that\nthe District’s denial of ASB recognition on this account is\nconsistent with the Act. The Act requires federally-funded\nschools that have created a limited open forum to grant reli-\ngious clubs benefits and privileges afforded to all other non-\ncurriculum clubs. See Bd. of Educ. of the Westside Cmty.\nSchs. v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 235-36 (1990); Prince, 303\nF.3d at 1081 (“[T]he term ‘equal access’ means what the\nSupreme Court said in Widmar [v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263,\n267-71 (1981)]: religiously-oriented student activities must be\nallowed under the same terms and conditions as other extra-\ncurricular activities . . . .”). Prince held that the rights pro-\ntected under the Act include equal access to the funding and\npublic communication techniques associated with recognition\nas an ASB group. 303 F.3d at 1084-90.\n\f10456           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n   Truth now requests an exemption from school policies reg-\nulating Truth’s conduct, arguing that its rights under the Act\nwould be violated were it not granted such an exemption. In\ninterpreting the Act, we begin with its plain language. “Where\nthe intent of Congress has been expressed in reasonably plain\nterms, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclu-\nsive.” Id. at 1079 (internal quotations and citation omitted).\nWhere there may be uncertainty, however, we rely on the\nSupreme Court’s direction that the Act is to be “interpreted\nbroadly,” Mergens, 496 U.S. at 239, as well as cases deciding\nanalogous issues under the First Amendment. Cf. Hsu v. Ros-\nlyn Union Free Sch. Dist. No. 3, 85 F.3d 839, 855-56 (2d Cir.\n1996) (adopting similar approach).\n\n   [12] By its plain terms, the Act prevents only denials of\naccess or fair opportunity or discrimination “on the basis of\nthe religious, political, philosophical, or other content of the\nspeech at [a club’s] meetings.” 20 U.S.C. § 4071(a). There-\nfore, once it is established that the secondary school receives\nfederal funds and has created a limited open forum, the club\nmust demonstrate two additional elements to prevail: 1) a\ndenial of equal access, or fair opportunity, or discrimination;\n2) that is based on the “content of the speech” at its meetings.\n\n   [13] The District has denied Truth ASB status not because\nof the religious “content of the speech,” but rather because of\nits discriminatory membership criteria. The Act does not\ndefine “content of the speech,” but that phrase has a particular\nmeaning in First Amendment jurisprudence. We have held\nthat “whether a statute is content neutral or content based is\nsomething that can be determined on the face of it; if the stat-\nute describes speech by content then it is content based.”\nMenotti v. City of Seattle, 409 F.3d 1113, 1129 (9th Cir. 2005)\n(quotations and citation omitted). Similarly, a “restriction on\nexpressive activity is content-neutral if it is . . . based on a\nnon-pretextual reason divorced from the content of the mes-\nsage attempted to be conveyed.” Id. (quotations and citation\nomitted).\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             10457\n   The Act, through which Congress extended the reasoning\nof the Supreme Court’s 1981 decision in Widmar v. Vincent\nto secondary schools, see Mergens, 496 U.S. at 235, tracks\nWidmar’s emphasis on discrimination based on the content of\nthe plaintiff’s speech. Widmar struck down a state universi-\nty’s regulation prohibiting the use of university buildings or\ngrounds “for purposes of religious worship or religious teach-\ning.” 454 U.S. at 265. Widmar thus precluded a university’s\n“discriminatory exclusion from a public forum based on the\nreligious content of a group’s intended speech,” 454 U.S. at\n269-70, but not its “right to exclude . . . First Amendment\nactivities that violate reasonable campus rules,” id. at 277.\nLikewise, the Act prevents a school’s unreasonable limitation\non the conduct of a club to the extent the limitation is justified\nwith reference to the expressive content of the regulated con-\nduct. Cf. Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791\n(1989) (“Government regulation of expressive activity is con-\ntent neutral so long as it is justified without reference to the\ncontent of the regulated speech” (internal quotations and cita-\ntion omitted)).\n\n   [14] Congress could have written the Act to protect reli-\ngious clubs against any burden on their activities, but did not.\nFor example, when Congress passed the Religious Land Use\nand Institutionalized Persons Act, it not only prohibited dis-\ncrimination against religious groups as such but also limited\ngovernments’ abilities to impose even neutral, nondiscrimina-\ntory policies against them:\n\n    No government shall impose or implement a land\n    use regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial\n    burden on the religious exercise of a person, includ-\n    ing a religious assembly or institution, unless the\n    government demonstrates that imposition of the bur-\n    den on that person, assembly, or institution—\n\n         (A) is in furtherance of a compelling gov-\n         ernmental interest; and\n\f10458           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n         (B) is the least restrictive means of further-\n         ing that compelling governmental interest.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000cc(a)(1). Thus, Congress knows how to draft\na statute placing otherwise content-neutral laws of general\napplicability that incidentally burden a First Amendment\nactivity under the same judicial scrutiny as laws specifically\ntargeting the religious content of a group’s expression. See\nGuru Nanak Sikh Soc’y of Yuba City v. County of Sutter, 456\nF.3d 978, 985-86 (9th Cir. 2006). That is not the case here.\nThe Act clearly allows exclusions that are not “content”-\nbased.\n\n   [15] The Act’s legislative history strengthens our conclu-\nsion that it prohibits only content-based restrictions on reli-\ngious groups. The legislative history focuses on Congress’s\nintent to end school districts’ previous practice of treating\nreligious groups inequitably and forbidding them from meet-\ning on campus. See S. Rep. 98-357, at 6, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n2348, 2352 (1984) (“Despite Widmar, many school adminis-\ntrators across the country are prohibiting voluntary, student-\ninitiated religious speech as an extracurricular activity.”); id.\nat 15, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2361 (“[S]chool authorities\nacross the country are banishing religious clubs from campus\nor placing such onerous restrictions on them that meetings\nbecome almost impossible.”). The Senate Report recognized\nthe possibility that religious groups like Truth might claim\nthat content-neutral policies regulating club membership vio-\nlate the Act, and disclaimed any such intent:\n\n    At the same time, the guarantee of equal access does\n    not require special treatment for religious groups.\n    Religious groups are accorded only the same rights\n    and privileges as are granted to other student groups.\n    In practice, however, this means that not all student\n    groups would receive exactly the same privileges.\n    There could be many neutral and impartial time,\n    place, and manner restrictions placed on the use of\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             10459\n    school facilities which might produce situations in\n    which some voluntary groups would not receive pre-\n    cisely the same access received by others. . . . The\n    access determination could not be made, however,\n    on the basis that the nature of the activity was reli-\n    gious.\n\nId. at 39, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2385. The District’s non-\ndiscrimination policies are not time, place or manner restric-\ntions. But like such restrictions, the policies are content-\nneutral. This strongly suggests that Congress did not intend\nthe Act to apply to non-discrimination policies.\n\n   [16] The parties do not dispute that the Kent School District\nreceives federal funding, or that Kentridge has created a lim-\nited open forum for extracurricular student groups. The Dis-\ntrict contests, however, whether the Act’s guarantee of equal\naccess, fair opportunity, and non-discrimination protects\nTruth’s freedom to exclude those who do not share Christian\nvalues from its general membership. On their face, the Dis-\ntrict’s non-discrimination policies do not preclude or discrimi-\nnate against religious speech. Indeed, there are two other\nBible clubs at Kentridge that have received ASB recognition\nand do not share Truth’s general membership restrictions.\nTruth also has not shown that the District justifies its non-\ndiscrimination policies with reference to the content of a mes-\nsage Truth’s discriminatory conduct may attempt to convey.\nThe policies are content-neutral. Therefore, to the extent they\nproscribe Truth’s discriminatory general membership restric-\ntions, the policies do not implicate any rights that Truth might\nenjoy under the Act.\n\n   Our reasoning is in some tension with that of the Second\nCircuit, which has focused on the term “speech” in the Act\nrather than the content-neutrality (or lack thereof) of school\npolicies. See Hsu, 85 F.3d at 856 (rejecting argument that Act\nwas not implicated because “the School did not base its quali-\nfied recognition of the Club on what would be said at the Club\n\f10460           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nmeetings, but on what could be characterized as the Club’s\n‘act’ of excluding non-Christians from leadership”); id. at 859\n(Act triggered “when an after-school religious club excludes\npeople of other religions from conducting its meetings . . . to\nprotect the expressive content of the meetings”). However, the\nargument that the Act does not extend to content-neutral regu-\nlations, which we have concluded is correct, was not squarely\naddressed in Hsu.\n\n  Truth has also made a cursory argument that the District\nviolated the Act by allowing other groups to impose codes of\nconduct and other selective membership criteria, while deny-\ning it an equal opportunity to do the same. With respect to\nmost of these other groups, we can reject Truth’s premise\nbecause the groups do not discriminate on a basis specifically\nenumerated by the non-discrimination policies.\n\n   It is true that the Men’s and Girls Honor Clubs are more\ndifficult to distinguish, as they employ gender-restrictive\nmembership criteria. However, the record is devoid of any\ninformation on the approval processes for these clubs and the\nrationale given for the apparent exemption from the Kent\nSchool District’s non-discrimination policies. Nor has Truth\nalleged that the District has a policy of granting exemptions,\nand that this policy was unequally applied to Truth. Under\nthese circumstances, we conclude that Truth has failed to\nmeet its burden of showing that the District violated the Act.\n\n  [17] Because the Act did not bar the District from denying\nASB recognition to Truth on account of the general member-\nship restrictions in its third charter, we affirm the district\ncourt’s summary judgment on Truth’s claim under the Act.\n\n                              B.\n\n   We next address whether, and if so how, the First Amend-\nment may apply where a school denies ASB recognition to a\nstudent club based on its membership criteria. Roberts sug-\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT              10461\ngests that a First Amendment claim arising from such a denial\nmay fall into one of two categories. See 468 U.S.at 622-23.\nAlthough these categories of claims may implicate different\nlevels of review, we need not decide which test applies as\nTruth has failed to show that the denial of ASB recognition\nbased on its general membership restrictions burdens a First\nAmendment interest, which is a threshold inquiry under either\ntest.\n\n   Healy v. James typifies the first category of First Amend-\nment claim. 408 U.S. 169 (1972). There, the president of a\nstate college denied official recognition to a group of students\nwho desired to form a local chapter of Students for a Demo-\ncratic Society (SDS), an organization that, in the Supreme\nCourt’s view, had been a “catalytic force” behind “civil dis-\nobedience on some campuses, accompanied by the seizure of\nbuildings, vandalism, and arson.” Id. at 170-71. The students\nsued the college president, among others, asserting that the\ndenial of official recognition violated the First Amendment.\nId. at 177. The Court held that the Second Circuit erred by\ndiscounting the existence of a cognizable First Amendment\nassociational interest, id. at 181-82, 184, but also stated that\nif the district court on remand found that there was evidence\nto support the conclusion that a local SDS chapter posed “a\nsubstantial threat of material disruption,” then the president’s\ndecision to deny official recognition should be affirmed, id. at\n189.\n\n   “Associational activities,” held the Court, “need not be tol-\nerated where they infringe reasonable campus rules, interrupt\nclasses, or substantially interfere with the opportunity of other\nstudents to obtain an education.” Id. The Court did not con-\ndemn incidental infringements on the students’ associational\nrights, so long as the school’s reason for denying official rec-\nognition was “directed at the organizations’s activities, rather\nthan its philosophy.” Id. at 188.\n\n  Healy observed that “the critical line for First Amendment\npurposes must be drawn between advocacy, which is entitled\n\f10462           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nto full protection, and action, which is not.” Id. at 192. This\ndistinction permits schools to regulate student conduct, even\nif it incidentally affects student expression:\n\n    Just as in the community at large, reasonable regula-\n    tions with respect to the time, the place, and the\n    manner in which student groups conduct their\n    speech-related activities must be respected. A col-\n    lege administration may impose a requirement, such\n    as may have been imposed in this case, that a group\n    seeking official recognition affirm in advance its\n    willingness to adhere to reasonable campus law.\n    Such a requirement does not impose an impermissi-\n    ble condition on the students’ associational rights.\n    Their freedom to speak out, to assemble, or to peti-\n    tion for changes in school rules is in no sense\n    infringed. It merely constitutes an agreement to con-\n    form with reasonable standards respecting conduct.\n    This is a minimal requirement, in the interest of the\n    entire academic community, of any group seeking\n    the privilege of official recognition.\n\nId. at 192-93. The Court “conclude[d] that the benefits of par-\nticipation in the internal life of the college community may be\ndenied to any group that reserves the right to violate any valid\ncampus rule with which it disagrees.” Id. at 193-94.\n\n  To determine whether a campus rule that incidentally bur-\ndens expressive rights is permissible under the First Amend-\nment, Healy calls for applying the four-part test of United\nStates v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968). Healy, 408 U.S. at\n189 n.20. In O’Brien, the government prosecuted an individ-\nual for burning his draft card, which the Court assumed to be\nexpressive conduct. 391 U.S. at 376. The Court held that gov-\nernment regulation of expressive conduct is permissible\n\n    if it is within the constitutional power of the Govern-\n    ment; if it furthers an important or substantial gov-\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             10463\n    ernmental interest; if the governmental interest is\n    unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and\n    if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amend-\n    ment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the\n    furtherance of that interest.\n\nId. at 377.\n\n   [18] Accordingly, for the O’Brien test to apply, the govern-\nment regulation must incidentally affect expressive conduct.\nTruth has not established that its policy of excluding persons\nwho do not share Christian values from its general member-\nship has any expressive content, let alone that this policy\ncommunicates a message consistent with the views of the\nclub’s organizers. Truth has thus failed to show the required\nincidental infringement of a First Amendment interest.\n\n   By contrast, a claim falling in the second Roberts category\nis one where a regulation imposes a Hobson’s Choice on the\norganization: include unwanted members or disband. Such\n“forced-inclusion” claims have come in two varieties. First,\nan organization may challenge a state law that forces it to\naccept leaders or voting members who do not hold views con-\nsistent with the original members. California Democratic\nParty v. Jones, for instance, held that a state primary law vio-\nlated the First Amendment because it forced “political parties\nto associate with — to have their nominees, and hence their\npositions, determined by — those who, at best, have refused\nto affiliate with the party, and, at worst, have expressly affili-\nated with a rival.” 530 U.S. 567, 577 (2000). Similarly, Dem-\nocratic Party of the United States v. Wisconsin ex rel. La\nFollette overturned, on First Amendment grounds, a state law\nthat effectively required the National Democratic Party, in\nviolation of the party’s rules, to allow non-party members to\nparticipate in the selection of the party’s presidential nominee.\n450 U.S. 107, 125-26 (1981) (La Follette).\n\n   Second, an organization may challenge a regulation that\nforces it to accept as members individuals whose very mem-\n\f10464           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nbership in the organization would force it to communicate a\nmessage inconsistent with the views of the organization’s\noriginal members. Leading this line of cases is Roberts, where\nthe Court upheld against a First Amendment challenge a state\nlaw requiring the Jaycees to admit women as voting members.\n468 U.S. at 628-29. The Court did so in part because the “Jay-\ncees already invites women to share the group’s views and\nphilosophy and to participate in much of its training and com-\nmunity activities.” Id. at 627. In the Court’s view, any claim\nthat their admission “will impair a symbolic message con-\nveyed by the very fact that women are not permitted to vote\nis attenuated at best.” Id.\n\n   By contrast, Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and\nBisexual Group of Boston held that a state law violated the\nFirst Amendment because it required parade organizers to\nallow a gay, lesbian, and bisexual contingent to march in the\nparade. 515 U.S. 557, 559 (1995). The Court emphasized that\nthe contingent’s mere presence behind the organizer’s banner\nconflicted with the organizer’s “particular point of view.” Id.\nat 575.\n\n    The Court reached a similar conclusion in Boy Scouts of\nAmerica v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 653 (2000). There, the Court\nheld that a state non-discrimination law requiring the Boy\nScouts to admit a gay-rights activist violated the First Amend-\nment because it “force[d] the organization to send a message\n. . . that [it] accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate form\nof behavior.” Id. Significantly, this message conflicted with\nthe “sincerely” held views of the organization. Id. Most\nrecently, Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional\nRights, Inc. upheld the Solomon Amendment against a Dale\nchallenge on the ground that the military recruiters required\nto be admitted to law schools “come onto campus for the lim-\nited purpose of trying to hire students — not to become mem-\nbers of the school’s expressive association.” 126 S.Ct. 1297,\n1312 (2006).\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             10465\n   In both of these forced-inclusion scenarios, the Court has\napplied strict scrutiny, asking whether the organization’s free-\ndom of expressive association “could be overridden by regu-\nlations adopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelated\nto the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through\nmeans significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.”\nDale, 530 U.S. at 648 (internal quotations and citation omit-\nted); see also Jones, 530 U.S. at 582; Roberts, 468 U.S. at\n623-26; La Follette, 450 U.S. at 125-26.\n\n  [19] The First Amendment interest implicated by the first\nkind of forced-inclusion case is not present here. The general\nmembers do not control the club’s Bible study and prayer\nfunctions. They do not lead the club in its activities. They\ncannot vote.\n\n   Truth has also not shown that the First Amendment interest\nimplicated by the second kind of forced-inclusion case is\npresent here. This case is not like Hurley or Dale. In Hurley,\nthe gay, lesbian, and bisexual contingent wanted to be an\nequal participant in the organization’s parade. In Dale, the\ngay-rights activist wanted to be a leader of the organization.\nHere, by contrast, those who merely seek general membership\nstatus do not seek to participate on equal footing with Truth’s\nvoting members or leaders. The concern that people outside\nthe club will construe the non-Christian conduct of general\nmembers as conduct endorsed by Truth has therefore not been\nproven here to the same extent that it was demonstrated in\nHurley and Dale. On this record, outside observers would not\nreceive, from the admission of individuals that Truth wishes\nto exclude from its general membership, any message that\nconflicts with the club’s views. Moreover, Truth states in its\nbrief that the admission of non-Christians as general members\nwould be unproblematic. While this statement does not\nresolve the issue before us — namely, whether the admission\nof individuals who do not meet Truth’s general membership\ncriteria (a category distinct from non-Christians) would con-\nvey a message in conflict with the club’s views — it does fur-\n\f10466           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nther suggest that general membership status is not a\nsignificant measure of the club’s expressive purposes.\n\n   In Christian Legal Society v. Walker, 453 F.3d 853, 857,\n861-84 (7th Cir. 2006), the Seventh Circuit applied the\nforced-inclusion cases to a similar set of facts. Truth, how-\never, has not shown the infringement of a cognizable First\nAmendment interest with respect to the District’s denial of\nASB recognition on account of the general membership\nrestrictions. Therefore, we will not express any opinion here\non whether the Seventh Circuit employed the appropriate\nlegal framework.\n\n   [20] We thus affirm the district court’s summary judgment\non the First Amendment claim. We need not address whether\nthe District violated the Act or the First Amendment by deny-\ning ASB recognition due to the voting membership and lead-\nership restrictions. Nor do we address whether the\nEstablishment Clause requires the District to deny Truth ASB\nrecognition.\n\n                              V.\n\n   We next discuss Truth’s First Amendment Free Exercise\nClause claim. Truth contends that the strict scrutiny standard\nof Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963), applies, while the\nDistrict appears to argue for application of the rational basis\ntest of Employment Division, Department of Human\nResources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990).\n\n   Ordinarily, “the rational basis test applies in ascertaining\nwhether a neutral law of general applicability violates the\nright to free exercise of religion even though the law inciden-\ntally burdens a particular religious belief or practice.” San\nJose Christian Coll. v. City of Morgan Hill, 360 F.3d 1024,\n1031 (9th Cir. 2004) (alterations and internal quotations omit-\nted). “In Smith, [however,] the Supreme Court stated that free\nexercise claims implicating other constitutional protections,\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT              10467\nsuch as free speech, could qualify for [Sherbert] strict scrutiny\nreview even if the challenged law is neutral and generally\napplicable.” Am. Family Ass’n v. City & County of San Fran-\ncisco, 277 F.3d 1114, 1124 (9th Cir. 2002). In order to make\nout such a hybrid claim, “a ‘free exercise plaintiff must make\nout a colorable claim that a companion right has been violat-\ned.’ ” Id., quoting Miller v. Reed, 176 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th\nCir. 1999).\n\n   [21] We have held that Truth’s First Amendment argument\nwith respect to the general membership restrictions is not col-\norable. Accordingly, rational basis review applies to the\ngroup’s Free Exercise claim. Although the district court did\nnot distinctly address this claim, we need not remand because\nit is clear that the claim is meritless. See In re Pintlar Corp.,\n133 F.3d 1141, 1145 (9th Cir. 1998) (“Remand is not neces-\nsary where the issue has been fully briefed on appeal, the\nrecord is clear and remand would impose needless additional\nexpense and delay” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The\nDistrict had a rational basis for drafting and implementing its\nnon-discrimination policies, namely its legitimate aim of pre-\nventing students from being subjected to unequal treatment on\naccount of their religion. See Roberts, 468 U.S. at 623 (refer-\nring to the state’s “compelling interest in eradicating discrimi-\nnation”).\n\n   [22] Truth’s Equal Protection and Establishment Clause\nclaims are given only brief treatment by Truth and rely on the\nsame premise: that the unequal treatment of Truth’s charter\napplication violates the applicable clause of the Constitution.\nWe need not reach the merits of this argument because we can\nreject the premise. Truth was not accorded unequal treatment,\nbecause the denial of its third charter was justified under the\nFirst Amendment and the Act based upon its general member-\nship restrictions. This denial represented a neutral application\nof the Kent School District’s non-discrimination policies and\ntherefore did not constitute unequal treatment.\n\f10468            TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n   The District has also argued that the ASB has free speech\nrights that would be violated if it were compelled to recognize\nTruth as an ASB organization. The ASB is not a party to this\nappeal and there is no indication that the District has authori-\nzation from the ASB to assert any such First Amendment\nclaims. We conclude that the District lacks prudential stand-\ning to assert the ASB’s free speech rights. See Kowalski v.\nTesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 129 (2004) (“[A] party generally must\nassert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his\nclaim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.”\n(internal quotations omitted)).\n\n                               VI.\n\n   [23] It is prudent to address only those issues necessary for\nour decision on the third charter application. We hold only\nthat the District did not violate the Act or Truth’s First\nAmendment rights by requiring Truth to remove its general\nmembership provision. Because the denial of Truth’s third\ncharter was permissible on this basis, we need go no further\nto affirm the summary judgment.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\f",

Truth alleges violations of the Equal Access Act (the\nAct), the First Amendment rights of free speech and expres-\nsive association, the Free Exercise Clause, the Establishment\nClause, and the Equal Protection Clause. We have jurisdiction\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We affirm.\n\f10442           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n                               I.\n\n   This appeal arises from Truth’s attempt to form a student\nclub at Kentridge High School (Kentridge), which is part of\nthe Kent School District. Under the relevant policies at Ken-\ntridge, “[u]nchartered clubs are not permitted to exist.” To\nobtain a charter, students must submit a proposed charter to\nthe Associated Student Body (ASB) Council and secure\napproval.\n\n   Beginning in the fall semester of 2001, appellants Undis,\nthen a junior, and Stewart, then a sophomore, attempted to\nform a Bible club at Kentridge. Undis and Stewart submitted\na “Club Charter Application” (first charter) for official recog-\nnition as an ASB organization in September 2001. This first\ncharter indicated that the club’s name was to be “Truth” and\nthat the purpose of the organization was to “have a Bible\nstudy to encourage and help become better people with good\nmorals.” Under the section “Membership Criteria,” the first\ncharter indicated that the group was to be “[o]pen to anyone.”\nThe charter also proposed that it would designate a “quote of\nthe week for announcement” and “once a month decorate\n[the] school with a theme.”\n\n   The ASB Council discussed Truth’s first charter at a Sep-\ntember 2001 meeting, and several students objected to char-\ntering Truth. The ASB Council decided to consult with the\nAssistant Principal, appellee Eric Anderson. Anderson and\nappellee Mike Albrecht, Principal of Kentridge, later told\nUndis that they would speak with the school’s attorney\nregarding the legality of granting Truth ASB recognition.\nAlbrecht stated that “the problem with the September 2001\nproposal was that it involved broadcasting a weekly Bible\nquote over the school’s public address system and monthly\ndecoration of the school in a biblical theme.”\n\n  No action was taken on the first charter for the remainder\nof the 2001-02 school year. During that time, Undis asked\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT            10443\nAnderson to make a decision on Truth’s application on at\nleast ten occasions, to no avail. Sometime in the spring semes-\nter of 2002, all ASB clubs were instructed to resubmit their\ncharters. The record does not reveal any further activity on\nTruth’s application during the summer and fall semesters of\n2002.\n\n   During this period, we decided Prince v. Jacoby, which\ninvolved a request by a Bible club for ASB recognition in a\ndifferent Washington school district. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779156\"><a href=\"/opinion/779156/tausha-prince-a-minor-by-and-through-her-parents-james-prince-kimberly/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1074</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.\n2002). On January 7, 2003, an attorney for Truth, Robert\nTyler, wrote to Albrecht stating that it was “constitutionally\nimperative that [Kentridge] grant [appellants’] proposed Bible\nClub treatment and rights equal to all other noncurriculum\nclubs.” The letter also insisted that Kentridge “immediately\nadhere to the requirements of the Equal Access Act and the\nFirst Amendment,” and threatened litigation if Kentridge did\nnot comply.\n\n   On January 30, 2003, Tyler sent a second letter to Michael\nHarrington, counsel for the Kent School District. Tyler\nrequested the forms required to establish an ASB club, and\nthreatened litigation if Truth’s charter was not approved by\nFebruary 4.\n\n   On February 2, as requested by Anderson, Undis and Stew-\nart submitted a new application (second charter). The second\ncharter removed the quote-of-the-week and monthly theme\ndecoration provisions of the first charter. The club’s stated\npurpose was now to “provid[e] a biblically-based club for\nthose students interested in growing in their relationship with\nJesus Christ.” Although membership would be open to all stu-\ndents, the second charter restricted voting membership to\n“members professing belief in the Bible and in Jesus Christ.”\nOfficers would also be required to “believe in and be commit-\nted to biblical principles.”\n\n  After a third letter to Harrington from Tyler, the second\ncharter was discussed at an ASB Council meeting on March\n\f10444           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n27. Some students expressed disapproval of the club’s name,\nsuggesting that it “implies that every other religion at Ken-\ntridge is a lie.” Some council members also expressed con-\ncerns that granting the charter would violate “[c]hurch and\nstate” and that the voting membership should be open to\neveryone. Additionally, members suggested that students\ncould go to “Young Life,” a non-ASB recognized organiza-\ntion that met on Kentridge’s campus after school hours. The\nminutes of the March 27 meeting reveal that the question of\nwhether to approve the second charter was discussed for\ntwenty minutes. No vote was taken.\n\n   The second charter was next addressed at an ASB Council\nmeeting on April 1. After a brief clarification on the role of\nthe advisor for the club, the minutes show that Anderson\nstated that if the ASB Council voted to approve the charter,\nhe would consult the District’s attorneys and Kentridge would\nmake a final decision on approving the charter. The Counsel\nvoted eleven to six against approval of Truth’s second charter.\n\n   On April 3, Truth filed a complaint in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Washington, alleg-\ning that defendants had violated the Act, as well as the First\nAmendment rights of free speech and expressive association,\nthe Free Exercise Clause, the Establishment Clause, and the\nEqual Protection Clause. Truth sought injunctive and declara-\ntory relief as well as nominal damages.\n\n   On April 9, Anderson sent Stewart a letter informing her of\nher right to resubmit Truth’s application for ASB club recog-\nnition: “As was discussed at the ASB meeting on March 28th,\nby making minor changes to Article[s] I and III of the pro-\nposed Constitution for your club, you will address the points\nraised.” Article I sets forth the name of the club and Article\nIII contains the voting membership and officer restrictions.\nAnderson advised Stewart to “be prepared to resubmit by the\nApril 25th ASB Meeting.” Under the Kentridge ASB Consti-\ntution, “[a]ny rejected charters must be resubmitted within\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             10445\ntwo weeks of rejection with the required changes made or the\ncharter shall be permanently rejected.”\n\n   Stewart and Undis submitted the third charter on April 24.\nThe third charter maintains the proposed name “Truth.” How-\never, it divides the membership into three categories: voting\nmembers, non-voting members, and attendees. Meetings are\nopen to everyone. But the “privilege of membership is contin-\ngent upon the member complying in good faith with Christian\ncharacter, Christian speech, Christian behavior and Christian\nconduct as generally described in the Bible.” The charter\napplication also lists a “true desire to . . . grow in a relation-\nship with Jesus Christ” under the “Membership Criteria”\nheading. In order to be a voting member or officer, students\nare required to sign a “statement of faith.” The statement of\nfaith requires the person to affirm that he or she believes “the\nBible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative\nWord of God.” A member must also pledge that he or she\nbelieves “that salvation is an undeserved gift from God,” and\nthat only by “acceptance of Jesus Christ as my personal Sav-\nior, through His death on the cross for my sins, is my faith\nmade real.” Other than the ability to call oneself a “member,”\nthere is no difference between the rights of non-voting mem-\nbers and attendees.\n\n   The third charter was discussed at the April 25 ASB Coun-\ncil meeting. The ASB Council again objected to the name,\nselectivity provisions, and the presence of religion in school.\nThe council voted nineteen to zero to deny approval of the\ncharter, with one member undecided. The minutes give four\nreasons why the charter was not accepted: 1) “Name,” 2)\n“Pledge to vote,” 3) “Segregating,” 4) “Religious club in\nschool.”\n\n   On May 6, Tyler wrote to the Kent School District’s coun-\nsel stating that it was his “understanding from the ASB Con-\nstitution that this rejection by the ASB is the final decision.”\nThe letter also provided that Tyler “was unable to locate any\n\f10446            TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nrights to appeal the decision of the ASB,” but that if there\nwere “a right to appeal the decision of the ASB,” he asked\nthat the letter “serve as a formal request for appeal.”\n\n   Anderson advised Undis and Stewart in a May 12 letter\n“that pursuant to Kent School District Policy 2340, [they had]\nthe ability to discuss this matter with Mr. Albrecht,” and men-\ntioned the possibility of discussions with the District superin-\ntendent or the ombudservices office. Although Tyler’s May 6\nletter would appear to have invoked these processes, no fur-\nther action was taken by the District. Policy 2340 concerns\n“religious related activities or practices.” The policy does not\nrefer to ASB recognition, and the ASB Constitution does not\nrefer to this policy as providing an avenue for an appeal of the\nDistrict’s decisions, which are otherwise “final.”\n\n  Although Undis and Stewart have both graduated from\nKentridge, they have indicated that another student, Lindsay\nThomas, is prepared to assume leadership of the club if the\ncharter is approved.\n\n   The Kent School District has three policies relevant to this\nappeal. First, Policy 3210 provides that “[t]he district will\nprovide equal educational opportunity and treatment for all\nstudents in all aspects of the academic and activities program.\nEqual opportunity and treatment is provided without regard to\nrace, creed, color, national origin, sex, marital status, previous\narrest . . . , incarceration, or physical, sensory or mental dis-\nabilities.” The district court held that inclusion of “creed”\nindicates that discrimination based upon religion is prohibited.\nThat ruling has not been challenged on appeal.\n\n  Second, Policy 2153 provides for “noncurriculum-related,\nnon ASB student groups,” which groups the principal shall\napprove provided they meet several additional requirements.\nThe policy does not accord ASB privileges to Policy 2153\ngroups. The District states that Truth “is free to operate as a\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT              10447\nprivate Policy 2153 group,” but argues that Truth was prop-\nerly denied ASB recognition.\n\n   Third, Policy 2340P regulates “religious related activities\nor practices,” and provides guidelines for schools addressing\nreligious holidays, symbols, ceremonies, topics, activities, and\nbeliefs. This policy also provides that “[s]tudents, parents, and\nemployees who are aggrieved by practices or activities con-\nducted in the school or district may seek resolution of their\nconcern first with the building principal, then with the district\nsuperintendent or designee, or use ombudservices, which is\navailable through the Legal Services Department.”\n\n   Washington State also has a relevant non-discrimination\nlaw, which the District relies on to justify its denial of ASB\nrecognition for Truth. Washington Revised Code § 49.60.215\n(West 2006) provides that:\n\n    It shall be an unfair practice for any person or the\n    person’s agent or employee to commit an act which\n    directly or indirectly results in any distinction,\n    restriction, or discrimination, . . . or the refusing or\n    withholding from any person the admission, patron-\n    age, custom, presence, frequenting, dwelling, stay-\n    ing, or lodging in any place of public resort,\n    accommodation, assemblage, or amusement, except\n    for conditions and limitations established by law and\n    applicable to all persons, regardless of race, creed,\n    color, national origin, sexual orientation, sex, the\n    presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disabil-\n    ity, or the use of a trained dog guide or service ani-\n    mal by a disabled person.\n\nThe District has argued that these non-discrimination policies\nrequire it to deny ASB recognition to Truth.\n\n   As of April 3, 2003, there were thirty ASB-recognized\nclubs at Kentridge. There is no evidence of any Policy 2153\n\f10448            TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\ngroups at Kentridge. While the record does not contain the\ncharters of all the clubs, it appears that many of them have\nselective membership criteria, restricting membership based\non both beliefs and conduct. Indeed, each charter application\ncontains a section for “Membership Criteria.”\n\n   The Earth Corps, for example, requires members to show\n“interest and dedication toward environmental issues.” Simi-\nlarly, the Key Club requires that members be “interested in\nservice, qualified scholastically, of good character, possessing\nleadership potential . . . [and] willing to perform at least fifty\nhours of . . . service.” The Gay-Straight Alliance requires that\nstudents “must be willing to work towards the goals of the\nclub” to be members. These goals include “bring[ing]\nGLBTQ [Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgendered, and Ques-\ntioning] issues into the open, while working to decrease\nhomophobia.” Other goals include “changing stereotypes”\nand “fight[ing] heterosexism and other forms of oppression.”\nThe National Honor Society selects its members based on\n“outstanding scholarship, character, leadership, and service,”\nand requires them to “behave in a courteous and respectful\nmanner, refraining from language and actions that might bring\ndiscredit upon themselves.” It also requires members to\nrefrain from using or possessing alcohol or illegal substances.\nParticipation in school sports requires maintaining a certain\ngrade point average and attendance record, not using drugs or\nalcohol, and complying with the “sports code.” Finally, a\nMen’s Honor Club and a Girls Honor Club also operate at\nKentridge as ASB-recognized groups. Each club has gender-\nexclusive membership.\n\n   The district court entered summary judgment on all of\nTruth’s claims under Monell v. Department of Social Services,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978), with the exception of the Act claim. The\ncourt held that the requirements of municipal liability under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 were not satisfied, and therefore entered\nsummary judgment in favor of the District. It also held that\nthe actions against the individual defendants in their official\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             10449\ncapacities were functionally equivalent to suits directly\nagainst the municipality, and therefore Truth’s claims against\nthem failed.\n\n   The district court ruled on the merits of the Act and some\nof the First Amendment claims, addressing the latter as an\nalternate holding if its Monell ruling were to be reversed. It\nheld that the restrictions on general membership in the third\ncharter constituted a legitimate basis for denying the third\ncharter and that these claims therefore failed.\n\n   The district court did not rule on the remaining claims\nbased on its belief that “Plaintiffs’ cursory Equal Protection\nClause, Establishment Clause, and Free Exercise Clause argu-\nments are all subsumed within their First Amendment argu-\nment.” The district court also did not address the District’s\nargument that granting ASB recognition to Truth would vio-\nlate the Establishment Clause.\n\n  On appeal, both sides agree that only the third charter is\nbefore us. Truth makes this concession even though this\naction was filed before the third charter and its complaint only\naddresses the denial of its second charter.\n\n   This appeal requires us to review many determinations by\nthe district court. As to each issue, we review de novo. We\nreview a district court’s summary judgment de novo. See\nBuono v.

KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n                              II.\n\n   Before addressing the merits, we consider our jurisdiction.\nThe District argues that Truth lacks standing under City of Los\nAngeles v. Lyons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110916\"><a href=\"/opinion/110916/los-angeles-v-lyons/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983), because Truth has\nfailed to meet the “likelihood of recurrence” requirement. The\nDistrict asserts that Truth “cannot say the ASB or the District\nwill always deny another Club application or even the same\napplication.”\n\n  [1] In order to establish Article III standing,\n\n    a plaintiff must show (1) it has suffered an “injury in\n    fact” that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b)\n    actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical;\n    (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged\n    action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as\n    opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be\n    redressed by a favorable decision.\n\nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v.

The District’s standing argument therefore\ndoes not implicate Truth’s standing to seek nominal damages.\n\n   The District asserts that the Establishment Clause, state\nlaw, and its own non-discrimination policies mandate that it\ndeny ASB recognition to Truth. If the District believes that\nthree independent and binding legal authorities compel it to\ndeny Truth’s application, we do not see how the District\nmight approve the same or a similar charter request in the\nfuture.\n\n   [3] The District’s written non-discrimination policies also\nsupport Truth’s standing arguments. We have held that plain-\ntiffs “may demonstrate that an injury is likely to recur by\nshowing that the defendant had . . . a written policy, and that\nthe injury ‘stems from’ that policy. Where the harm alleged\nis directly traceable to a written policy there is an implicit\nlikelihood of its repetition in the immediate future.” Fortyune\nv. Am.

Here, the\nharm is traceable to the District’s policies, which the District\nhas argued compel it to deny ASB recognition to Truth.\n\n   Additionally, despite Tyler’s request that the District treat\nhis letter as a “formal request for appeal,” the District took no\naction. This is evidence that another charter request is likely\nto meet the same fate as the previous three. Finally, the Dis-\ntrict has provided nothing beyond its own speculation that the\noutcome might be different if Truth submitted a fourth char-\nter. The legal positions it has taken in this litigation strongly\nsuggest that no similar applications will ever be approved.\n\n   [4] Under these circumstances, we conclude that Truth has\nestablished at least a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\f10452            TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nwhether there is a reasonable expectation that the alleged\ninjury will recur. Therefore, Truth has standing to seek each\nof its requested forms of relief.\n\n   The District also suggests that this dispute is not ripe for\nreview, and that we thus lack jurisdiction, because Truth did\nnot bring the dispute to the Kent School District Board or\nSuperintendent through Policy 2340P. The District is wrong.\nThe Supreme Court has explicitly held that exhaustion is not\nrequired for claims brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See Stef-\nfel v. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108985\"><a href=\"/opinion/108985/steffel-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472-73 (1974). Exhaustion\ncannot be dispositive under a ripeness analysis; otherwise\nripeness doctrine would impose a de facto exhaustion require-\nment, in violation of Steffel. Thus, the alleged failure to\nexhaust administrative remedies may be at most only a factor\nin the ripeness analysis.\n\n   [5] Nevertheless, it appears that Truth did exhaust the for-\nmal appeal system. Tyler’s May 6 letter to the District’s coun-\nsel asked that the letter “serve as a formal request for appeal.”\nThe District has not provided any reason why this notification\nwas not sufficient to trigger its appeals process, and no reason\nis apparent in the record. The District’s failure to take any\naction as a result of this request does not indicate that Truth\nfailed to bring the matter to the attention of the District. Under\nthese circumstances, there is at least a genuine issue of mate-\nrial fact as to whether Truth exhausted the District’s grievance\nprocedures.\n\n   Nearly every other factor suggests that this case is ripe for\ndecision. Under the Kentridge ASB Constitution, “[a]ny\nrejected charters must be resubmitted within two weeks of\nrejection with the required changes made or the charter shall\nbe permanently rejected.” The ASB Constitution does not\nprovide for any additional review, nor does it suggest that the\nASB Council’s decision lacked finality.\n\n  Furthermore, there is no doubt that the effects of the denial\nof Truth’s charter have been felt in a concrete way by the\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT              10453\nappellants. Truth’s members have experienced three denials\nof their applications, as well as protracted delays in obtaining\nany action from the ASB Council and District. The harm that\nTruth has complained of does not “rest[ ] upon contingent\nfuture events” or ones that “may not occur at all.” Texas v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118190\"><a href=\"/opinion/118190/texas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 300 (1998). Instead, Truth com-\nplains of discrete events that have already occurred.\n\n   [6] Finally, “in evaluating ripeness, courts assess both the\nfitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to\nthe parties of withholding court consideration.” Ass’n of Am.\nMed. Colls. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769309\"><a href=\"/opinion/769309/association-of-american-medical-colleges-american-medical-association-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 779-80 (9th Cir.\n2000) (internal quotation omitted). We conclude the hardship\nto Truth in denying adjudication outweighs the hardship to the\nDistrict in deciding this appeal. Truth’s application for ASB\nrecognition languished for nearly sixteen months without any\nsignificant action being taken, and the ASB process appears\nto have stalled until Truth obtained counsel and threatened to\nsue. More than five years have passed since the submission of\nthe first charter, and declining to decide this appeal now\nwould present a significant hardship to appellants.\n\n   [7] By contrast, the hardship to the District is significantly\nless severe. The District has been aware of Truth’s arguments\nfor a long time and has had ample opportunity to take correc-\ntive action or change its policies, if it so desired. Its legal\npositions on appeal show that it does not believe any remedial\naction is appropriate and that it believes the denial of ASB\nrecognition was proper. We therefore conclude that this case\nis ripe for decision.\n\n                              III.\n\n  [8] We must also consider the district court’s ruling that the\nrequirements of Monell are not met. Monell permits section\n1983 actions against municipalities, but requires plaintiffs to\nshow that their injuries resulted from “execution of a govern-\nment’s policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or\n\f10454           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nby those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent\nofficial policy.” 436 U.S. at 694. Monell’s requirements do\nnot apply where the plaintiffs only seek prospective relief,\nwhich is the case here. See Chaloux v. Killeen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529825\"><a href=\"/opinion/529825/marie-chaloux-nancy-morgan-and-clarence-paine-individually-and-on-behalf/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n250-51 (9th Cir. 1989). The District acknowledges the con-\ntrolling effect of Chaloux, but argues that it should be over-\nruled because it “rests on shaky grounds.”\n\n  [9] It is well established in our circuit that while\n\n    a three judge panel normally cannot overrule a deci-\n    sion of a prior panel on a controlling question of law,\n    we may overrule prior circuit authority without tak-\n    ing the case en banc when an intervening Supreme\n    Court decision undermines an existing precedent of\n    the Ninth Circuit, and both cases are closely on\n    point.\n\nGalbraith v.

We have no authority\nto overrule Chaloux. Chaloux applies, and the district court’s\nMonell ruling is reversed.\n\n                              IV.\n\n  Relying on its non-discrimination policies, the District\npoints to three aspects of Truth’s third charter that justify its\ndecision to deny the club ASB recognition: 1) the general\nmembership restrictions, 2) the leadership and voting mem-\nbership restrictions, and 3) the name “Truth.” We address the\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             10455\nfirst of these, holding that Truth’s general membership restric-\ntions violate the District’s non-discrimination policies and are\nnot protected by either the Act or the First Amendment.\n\n                               A.\n\n   [10] States have the constitutional authority to enact legis-\nlation prohibiting invidious discrimination. See Roberts v.\nUnited States Jaycees, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111255\"><a href=\"/opinion/111255/roberts-v-united-states-jaycees/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 624-26 (1984) (review-\ning the history of state anti-discrimination laws and observing\nthat a “State enjoys broad authority to create rights of public\naccess on behalf of its citizens”). Truth asserts that it does not\ndiscriminate based on religion in violation of the plain lan-\nguage of the District’s policies, but rather imposes a code of\nconduct not unlike those of other approved ASB clubs. Even\nassuming that non-Christians would be able to comply with\nTruth’s view of “Christian character, Christian speech, Chris-\ntian behavior and Christian conduct,” we hold that the\nrequirement that members possess a “true desire to . . . grow\nin a relationship with Jesus Christ” inherently excludes non-\nChristians.\n\n   [11] Having determined that the third charter violates the\nDistrict’s non-discrimination policies, we are led to hold that\nthe District’s denial of ASB recognition on this account is\nconsistent with the Act. The Act requires federally-funded\nschools that have created a limited open forum to grant reli-\ngious clubs benefits and privileges afforded to all other non-\ncurriculum clubs.

KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n   Truth now requests an exemption from school policies reg-\nulating Truth’s conduct, arguing that its rights under the Act\nwould be violated were it not granted such an exemption. In\ninterpreting the Act, we begin with its plain language. “Where\nthe intent of Congress has been expressed in reasonably plain\nterms, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclu-\nsive.” Id. at 1079 (internal quotations and citation omitted).\nWhere there may be uncertainty, however, we rely on the\nSupreme Court’s direction that the Act is to be “interpreted\nbroadly,” Mergens, 496 U.S. at 239, as well as cases deciding\nanalogous issues under the First Amendment. Cf. Hsu v. Ros-\nlyn Union Free Sch. Dist. No. 3, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"719595\"><a href=\"/opinion/719595/emily-hsu-and-timothy-hsu-by-and-through-their-next-friend-dr-chin-ching/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 855-56 (2d Cir.\n1996) (adopting similar approach).\n\n   [12] By its plain terms, the Act prevents only denials of\naccess or fair opportunity or discrimination “on the basis of\nthe religious, political, philosophical, or other content of the\nspeech at [a club’s] meetings.” 20 U.S.C. § 4071(a). There-\nfore, once it is established that the secondary school receives\nfederal funds and has created a limited open forum, the club\nmust demonstrate two additional elements to prevail: 1) a\ndenial of equal access, or fair opportunity, or discrimination;\n2) that is based on the “content of the speech” at its meetings.\n\n   [13] The District has denied Truth ASB status not because\nof the religious “content of the speech,” but rather because of\nits discriminatory membership criteria. The Act does not\ndefine “content of the speech,” but that phrase has a particular\nmeaning in First Amendment jurisprudence. We have held\nthat “whether a statute is content neutral or content based is\nsomething that can be determined on the face of it; if the stat-\nute describes speech by content then it is content based.”\nMenotti v. City of Seattle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790471\"><a href=\"/opinion/790471/victor-menotti-thomas-sellman-todd-stedl-doug-skove-v-city-of-seattle-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1129 (9th Cir. 2005)\n(quotations and citation omitted). Similarly, a “restriction on\nexpressive activity is content-neutral if it is . . . based on a\nnon-pretextual reason divorced from the content of the mes-\nsage attempted to be conveyed.” Id. (quotations and citation\nomitted).\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             10457\n   The Act, through which Congress extended the reasoning\nof the Supreme Court’s 1981 decision in Widmar v. Vincent\nto secondary schools, see Mergens, 496 U.S. at 235, tracks\nWidmar’s emphasis on discrimination based on the content of\nthe plaintiff’s speech. Widmar struck down a state universi-\nty’s regulation prohibiting the use of university buildings or\ngrounds “for purposes of religious worship or religious teach-\ning.” 454 U.S. at 265. Widmar thus precluded a university’s\n“discriminatory exclusion from a public forum based on the\nreligious content of a group’s intended speech,” 454 U.S. at\n269-70, but not its “right to exclude . . . First Amendment\nactivities that violate reasonable campus rules,” id. at 277.\nLikewise, the Act prevents a school’s unreasonable limitation\non the conduct of a club to the extent the limitation is justified\nwith reference to the expressive content of the regulated con-\nduct. Cf. Ward v. Rock Against Racism, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112315\"><a href=\"/opinion/112315/ward-v-rock-against-racism/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 791\n(1989) (“Government regulation of expressive activity is con-\ntent neutral so long as it is justified without reference to the\ncontent of the regulated speech” (internal quotations and cita-\ntion omitted)).\n\n   [14] Congress could have written the Act to protect reli-\ngious clubs against any burden on their activities, but did not.\nFor example, when Congress passed the Religious Land Use\nand Institutionalized Persons Act, it not only prohibited dis-\ncrimination against religious groups as such but also limited\ngovernments’ abilities to impose even neutral, nondiscrimina-\ntory policies against them:\n\n    No government shall impose or implement a land\n    use regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial\n    burden on the religious exercise of a person, includ-\n    ing a religious assembly or institution, unless the\n    government demonstrates that imposition of the bur-\n    den on that person, assembly, or institution—\n\n         (A) is in furtherance of a compelling gov-\n         ernmental interest; and\n\f10458           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n         (B) is the least restrictive means of further-\n         ing that compelling governmental interest.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000cc(a)(1). Thus, Congress knows how to draft\na statute placing otherwise content-neutral laws of general\napplicability that incidentally burden a First Amendment\nactivity under the same judicial scrutiny as laws specifically\ntargeting the religious content of a group’s expression. See\nGuru Nanak Sikh Soc’y of Yuba City v. County of Sutter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795229\"><a href=\"/opinion/795229/guru-nanak-sikh-society-of-yuba-city-v-county-of-sutter-casey-kroon-dennis/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">978</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 985-86 (9th Cir. 2006). That is not the case here.\nThe Act clearly allows exclusions that are not “content”-\nbased.\n\n   [15] The Act’s legislative history strengthens our conclu-\nsion that it prohibits only content-based restrictions on reli-\ngious groups. The legislative history focuses on Congress’s\nintent to end school districts’ previous practice of treating\nreligious groups inequitably and forbidding them from meet-\ning on campus. See S. Rep. 98-357, at 6, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n2348, 2352 (1984) (“Despite Widmar, many school adminis-\ntrators across the country are prohibiting voluntary, student-\ninitiated religious speech as an extracurricular activity.”); id.\nat 15, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2361 (“[S]chool authorities\nacross the country are banishing religious clubs from campus\nor placing such onerous restrictions on them that meetings\nbecome almost impossible.”). The Senate Report recognized\nthe possibility that religious groups like Truth might claim\nthat content-neutral policies regulating club membership vio-\nlate the Act, and disclaimed any such intent:\n\n    At the same time, the guarantee of equal access does\n    not require special treatment for religious groups.\n    Religious groups are accorded only the same rights\n    and privileges as are granted to other student groups.\n    In practice, however, this means that not all student\n    groups would receive exactly the same privileges.\n    There could be many neutral and impartial time,\n    place, and manner restrictions placed on the use of\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             10459\n    school facilities which might produce situations in\n    which some voluntary groups would not receive pre-\n    cisely the same access received by others. . . . The\n    access determination could not be made, however,\n    on the basis that the nature of the activity was reli-\n    gious.\n\nId. at 39, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2385. The District’s non-\ndiscrimination policies are not time, place or manner restric-\ntions. But like such restrictions, the policies are content-\nneutral. This strongly suggests that Congress did not intend\nthe Act to apply to non-discrimination policies.\n\n   [16] The parties do not dispute that the Kent School District\nreceives federal funding, or that Kentridge has created a lim-\nited open forum for extracurricular student groups. The Dis-\ntrict contests, however, whether the Act’s guarantee of equal\naccess, fair opportunity, and non-discrimination protects\nTruth’s freedom to exclude those who do not share Christian\nvalues from its general membership. On their face, the Dis-\ntrict’s non-discrimination policies do not preclude or discrimi-\nnate against religious speech. Indeed, there are two other\nBible clubs at Kentridge that have received ASB recognition\nand do not share Truth’s general membership restrictions.\nTruth also has not shown that the District justifies its non-\ndiscrimination policies with reference to the content of a mes-\nsage Truth’s discriminatory conduct may attempt to convey.\nThe policies are content-neutral. Therefore, to the extent they\nproscribe Truth’s discriminatory general membership restric-\ntions, the policies do not implicate any rights that Truth might\nenjoy under the Act.\n\n   Our reasoning is in some tension with that of the Second\nCircuit, which has focused on the term “speech” in the Act\nrather than the content-neutrality (or lack thereof) of school\npolicies. See Hsu, 85 F.3d at 856 (rejecting argument that Act\nwas not implicated because “the School did not base its quali-\nfied recognition of the Club on what would be said at the Club\n\f10460           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nmeetings, but on what could be characterized as the Club’s\n‘act’ of excluding non-Christians from leadership”); id. at 859\n(Act triggered “when an after-school religious club excludes\npeople of other religions from conducting its meetings . . . to\nprotect the expressive content of the meetings”). However, the\nargument that the Act does not extend to content-neutral regu-\nlations, which we have concluded is correct, was not squarely\naddressed in Hsu.\n\n  Truth has also made a cursory argument that the District\nviolated the Act by allowing other groups to impose codes of\nconduct and other selective membership criteria, while deny-\ning it an equal opportunity to do the same. With respect to\nmost of these other groups, we can reject Truth’s premise\nbecause the groups do not discriminate on a basis specifically\nenumerated by the non-discrimination policies.\n\n   It is true that the Men’s and Girls Honor Clubs are more\ndifficult to distinguish, as they employ gender-restrictive\nmembership criteria. However, the record is devoid of any\ninformation on the approval processes for these clubs and the\nrationale given for the apparent exemption from the Kent\nSchool District’s non-discrimination policies. Nor has Truth\nalleged that the District has a policy of granting exemptions,\nand that this policy was unequally applied to Truth. Under\nthese circumstances, we conclude that Truth has failed to\nmeet its burden of showing that the District violated the Act.\n\n  [17] Because the Act did not bar the District from denying\nASB recognition to Truth on account of the general member-\nship restrictions in its third charter, we affirm the district\ncourt’s summary judgment on Truth’s claim under the Act.\n\n                              B.\n\n   We next address whether, and if so how, the First Amend-\nment may apply where a school denies ASB recognition to a\nstudent club based on its membership criteria. Roberts sug-\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT              10461\ngests that a First Amendment claim arising from such a denial\nmay fall into one of two categories. See 468 U.S.at 622-23.\nAlthough these categories of claims may implicate different\nlevels of review, we need not decide which test applies as\nTruth has failed to show that the denial of ASB recognition\nbased on its general membership restrictions burdens a First\nAmendment interest, which is a threshold inquiry under either\ntest.\n\n   Healy v. James typifies the first category of First Amend-\nment claim. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108600\"><a href=\"/opinion/108600/healy-v-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972). There, the president of a\nstate college denied official recognition to a group of students\nwho desired to form a local chapter of Students for a Demo-\ncratic Society (SDS), an organization that, in the Supreme\nCourt’s view, had been a “catalytic force” behind “civil dis-\nobedience on some campuses, accompanied by the seizure of\nbuildings, vandalism, and arson.” Id. at 170-71. The students\nsued the college president, among others, asserting that the\ndenial of official recognition violated the First Amendment.\nId. at 177. The Court held that the Second Circuit erred by\ndiscounting the existence of a cognizable First Amendment\nassociational interest, id. at 181-82, 184, but also stated that\nif the district court on remand found that there was evidence\nto support the conclusion that a local SDS chapter posed “a\nsubstantial threat of material disruption,” then the president’s\ndecision to deny official recognition should be affirmed, id. at\n189.\n\n   “Associational activities,” held the Court, “need not be tol-\nerated where they infringe reasonable campus rules, interrupt\nclasses, or substantially interfere with the opportunity of other\nstudents to obtain an education.” Id. The Court did not con-\ndemn incidental infringements on the students’ associational\nrights, so long as the school’s reason for denying official rec-\nognition was “directed at the organizations’s activities, rather\nthan its philosophy.” Id. at 188.\n\n  Healy observed that “the critical line for First Amendment\npurposes must be drawn between advocacy, which is entitled\n\f10462           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nto full protection, and action, which is not.” Id. at 192. This\ndistinction permits schools to regulate student conduct, even\nif it incidentally affects student expression:\n\n    Just as in the community at large, reasonable regula-\n    tions with respect to the time, the place, and the\n    manner in which student groups conduct their\n    speech-related activities must be respected. A col-\n    lege administration may impose a requirement, such\n    as may have been imposed in this case, that a group\n    seeking official recognition affirm in advance its\n    willingness to adhere to reasonable campus law.\n    Such a requirement does not impose an impermissi-\n    ble condition on the students’ associational rights.\n    Their freedom to speak out, to assemble, or to peti-\n    tion for changes in school rules is in no sense\n    infringed. It merely constitutes an agreement to con-\n    form with reasonable standards respecting conduct.\n    This is a minimal requirement, in the interest of the\n    entire academic community, of any group seeking\n    the privilege of official recognition.\n\nId. at 192-93. The Court “conclude[d] that the benefits of par-\nticipation in the internal life of the college community may be\ndenied to any group that reserves the right to violate any valid\ncampus rule with which it disagrees.” Id. at 193-94.\n\n  To determine whether a campus rule that incidentally bur-\ndens expressive rights is permissible under the First Amend-\nment, Healy calls for applying the four-part test of United\nStates v. O’Brien, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107701\"><a href=\"/opinion/107701/united-states-v-obrien/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1968). Healy, 408 U.S. at\n189 n.20. In O’Brien, the government prosecuted an individ-\nual for burning his draft card, which the Court assumed to be\nexpressive conduct. 391 U.S. at 376. The Court held that gov-\nernment regulation of expressive conduct is permissible\n\n    if it is within the constitutional power of the Govern-\n    ment; if it furthers an important or substantial gov-\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             10463\n    ernmental interest; if the governmental interest is\n    unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and\n    if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amend-\n    ment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the\n    furtherance of that interest.\n\nId. at 377.\n\n   [18] Accordingly, for the O’Brien test to apply, the govern-\nment regulation must incidentally affect expressive conduct.\nTruth has not established that its policy of excluding persons\nwho do not share Christian values from its general member-\nship has any expressive content, let alone that this policy\ncommunicates a message consistent with the views of the\nclub’s organizers. Truth has thus failed to show the required\nincidental infringement of a First Amendment interest.\n\n   By contrast, a claim falling in the second Roberts category\nis one where a regulation imposes a Hobson’s Choice on the\norganization: include unwanted members or disband. Such\n“forced-inclusion” claims have come in two varieties. First,\nan organization may challenge a state law that forces it to\naccept leaders or voting members who do not hold views con-\nsistent with the original members. California Democratic\nParty v. Jones, for instance, held that a state primary law vio-\nlated the First Amendment because it forced “political parties\nto associate with — to have their nominees, and hence their\npositions, determined by — those who, at best, have refused\nto affiliate with the party, and, at worst, have expressly affili-\nated with a rival.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118382\"><a href=\"/opinion/118382/california-democratic-party-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 577 (2000). Similarly, Dem-\nocratic Party of the United States v. Wisconsin ex rel. La\nFollette overturned, on First Amendment grounds, a state law\nthat effectively required the National Democratic Party, in\nviolation of the party’s rules, to allow non-party members to\nparticipate in the selection of the party’s presidential nominee.\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110418\"><a href=\"/opinion/110418/democratic-party-of-united-states-v-wisconsin-ex-rel-la-follette/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 125-26 (1981) (La Follette).\n\n   Second, an organization may challenge a regulation that\nforces it to accept as members individuals whose very mem-\n\f10464           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nbership in the organization would force it to communicate a\nmessage inconsistent with the views of the organization’s\noriginal members. Leading this line of cases is Roberts, where\nthe Court upheld against a First Amendment challenge a state\nlaw requiring the Jaycees to admit women as voting members.\n468 U.S. at 628-29. The Court did so in part because the “Jay-\ncees already invites women to share the group’s views and\nphilosophy and to participate in much of its training and com-\nmunity activities.” Id. at 627. In the Court’s view, any claim\nthat their admission “will impair a symbolic message con-\nveyed by the very fact that women are not permitted to vote\nis attenuated at best.” Id.\n\n   By contrast, Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and\nBisexual Group of Boston held that a state law violated the\nFirst Amendment because it required parade organizers to\nallow a gay, lesbian, and bisexual contingent to march in the\nparade. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117960\"><a href=\"/opinion/117960/hurley-v-irish-american-gay-lesbian-and-bisexual-group-of-boston-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 559 (1995). The Court emphasized that\nthe contingent’s mere presence behind the organizer’s banner\nconflicted with the organizer’s “particular point of view.” Id.\nat 575.\n\n    The Court reached a similar conclusion in Boy Scouts of\nAmerica v. Dale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118384\"><a href=\"/opinion/118384/boy-scouts-of-america-v-dale/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 653 (2000). There, the Court\nheld that a state non-discrimination law requiring the Boy\nScouts to admit a gay-rights activist violated the First Amend-\nment because it “force[d] the organization to send a message\n. . . that [it] accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate form\nof behavior.” Id. Significantly, this message conflicted with\nthe “sincerely” held views of the organization. Id. Most\nrecently, Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional\nRights, Inc. upheld the Solomon Amendment against a Dale\nchallenge on the ground that the military recruiters required\nto be admitted to law schools “come onto campus for the lim-\nited purpose of trying to hire students — not to become mem-\nbers of the school’s expressive association.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145672\"><a href=\"/opinion/145672/rumsfeld-v-forum-for-academic-and-institutional-rights-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             10465\n   In both of these forced-inclusion scenarios, the Court has\napplied strict scrutiny, asking whether the organization’s free-\ndom of expressive association “could be overridden by regu-\nlations adopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelated\nto the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through\nmeans significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.”\nDale, 530 U.S. at 648 (internal quotations and citation omit-\nted); see also Jones, 530 U.S. at 582; Roberts, 468 U.S. at\n623-26; La Follette, 450 U.S. at 125-26.\n\n  [19] The First Amendment interest implicated by the first\nkind of forced-inclusion case is not present here. The general\nmembers do not control the club’s Bible study and prayer\nfunctions. They do not lead the club in its activities. They\ncannot vote.\n\n   Truth has also not shown that the First Amendment interest\nimplicated by the second kind of forced-inclusion case is\npresent here. This case is not like Hurley or Dale. In Hurley,\nthe gay, lesbian, and bisexual contingent wanted to be an\nequal participant in the organization’s parade. In Dale, the\ngay-rights activist wanted to be a leader of the organization.\nHere, by contrast, those who merely seek general membership\nstatus do not seek to participate on equal footing with Truth’s\nvoting members or leaders. The concern that people outside\nthe club will construe the non-Christian conduct of general\nmembers as conduct endorsed by Truth has therefore not been\nproven here to the same extent that it was demonstrated in\nHurley and Dale. On this record, outside observers would not\nreceive, from the admission of individuals that Truth wishes\nto exclude from its general membership, any message that\nconflicts with the club’s views. Moreover, Truth states in its\nbrief that the admission of non-Christians as general members\nwould be unproblematic. While this statement does not\nresolve the issue before us — namely, whether the admission\nof individuals who do not meet Truth’s general membership\ncriteria (a category distinct from non-Christians) would con-\nvey a message in conflict with the club’s views — it does fur-\n\f10466           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nther suggest that general membership status is not a\nsignificant measure of the club’s expressive purposes.\n\n   In Christian Legal Society v. Walker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794892\"><a href=\"/opinion/794892/christian-legal-society-chapter-at-southern-illinois-university-school-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 857,\n861-84 (7th Cir. 2006), the Seventh Circuit applied the\nforced-inclusion cases to a similar set of facts. Truth, how-\never, has not shown the infringement of a cognizable First\nAmendment interest with respect to the District’s denial of\nASB recognition on account of the general membership\nrestrictions. Therefore, we will not express any opinion here\non whether the Seventh Circuit employed the appropriate\nlegal framework.\n\n   [20] We thus affirm the district court’s summary judgment\non the First Amendment claim. We need not address whether\nthe District violated the Act or the First Amendment by deny-\ning ASB recognition due to the voting membership and lead-\nership restrictions. Nor do we address whether the\nEstablishment Clause requires the District to deny Truth ASB\nrecognition.\n\n                              V.\n\n   We next discuss Truth’s First Amendment Free Exercise\nClause claim. Truth contends that the strict scrutiny standard\nof Sherbert v.

City of Morgan Hill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785389\"><a href=\"/opinion/785389/san-jose-christian-college-a-california-non-profit-corporation-v-city-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1024</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1031 (9th Cir. 2004) (alterations and internal quotations omit-\nted). “In Smith, [however,] the Supreme Court stated that free\nexercise claims implicating other constitutional protections,\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT              10467\nsuch as free speech, could qualify for [Sherbert] strict scrutiny\nreview even if the challenged law is neutral and generally\napplicable.” Am. Family Ass’n v. City & County of San Fran-\ncisco, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776269\"><a href=\"/opinion/776269/american-family-association-inc-donald-wildmon-kerusso-ministries-family/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1114</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1124 (9th Cir. 2002). In order to make\nout such a hybrid claim, “a ‘free exercise plaintiff must make\nout a colorable claim that a companion right has been violat-\ned.’ ” Id., quoting Miller v. Reed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764125\"><a href=\"/opinion/764125/99-cal-daily-op-serv-3882-1999-daily-journal-dar-4962-donald-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1207 (9th\nCir. 1999).\n\n   [21] We have held that Truth’s First Amendment argument\nwith respect to the general membership restrictions is not col-\norable. Accordingly, rational basis review applies to the\ngroup’s Free Exercise claim. Although the district court did\nnot distinctly address this claim, we need not remand because\nit is clear that the claim is meritless. See In re Pintlar Corp.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750651\"><a href=\"/opinion/750651/98-cal-daily-op-serv-330-98-daily-journal-dar-437-in-re-pintlar/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1145 (9th Cir. 1998) (“Remand is not neces-\nsary where the issue has been fully briefed on appeal, the\nrecord is clear and remand would impose needless additional\nexpense and delay” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The\nDistrict had a rational basis for drafting and implementing its\nnon-discrimination policies, namely its legitimate aim of pre-\nventing students from being subjected to unequal treatment on\naccount of their religion. See Roberts, 468 U.S. at 623 (refer-\nring to the state’s “compelling interest in eradicating discrimi-\nnation”).\n\n   [22] Truth’s Equal Protection and Establishment Clause\nclaims are given only brief treatment by Truth and rely on the\nsame premise: that the unequal treatment of Truth’s charter\napplication violates the applicable clause of the Constitution.\nWe need not reach the merits of this argument because we can\nreject the premise. Truth was not accorded unequal treatment,\nbecause the denial of its third charter was justified under the\nFirst Amendment and the Act based upon its general member-\nship restrictions. This denial represented a neutral application\nof the Kent School District’s non-discrimination policies and\ntherefore did not constitute unequal treatment.\n\f10468            TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n   The District has also argued that the ASB has free speech\nrights that would be violated if it were compelled to recognize\nTruth as an ASB organization. The ASB is not a party to this\nappeal and there is no indication that the District has authori-\nzation from the ASB to assert any such First Amendment\nclaims. We conclude that the District lacks prudential stand-\ning to assert the ASB’s free speech rights. See Kowalski v.\nTesmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137732\"><a href=\"/opinion/137732/kowalski-v-tesmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 129 (2004) (“[A] party generally must\nassert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his\nclaim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.”\n(internal quotations omitted)).\n\n                               VI.\n\n   [23] It is prudent to address only those issues necessary for\nour decision on the third charter application. We hold only\nthat the District did not violate the Act or Truth’s First\nAmendment rights by requiring Truth to remove its general\nmembership provision. Because the denial of Truth’s third\ncharter was permissible on this basis, we need go no further\nto affirm the summary judgment.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\f</pre>",
