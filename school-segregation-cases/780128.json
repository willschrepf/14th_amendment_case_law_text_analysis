FLSA, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 201 <i>et seq.,</i> as amended by the Portal-to-Portal Act, 61 Stat. 86-87 (codified at 29 U.S.C. &#167; 254(a)). The plaintiffs work at the Indian Point II nuclear power plant (\"Indian Point\" or \"the plant\"), which was owned and operated by defendant Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (\"Con Ed\"), and was sold in September 2001 to defendant Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. (\"Entergy\").</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the action against Con Ed, plaintiffs claim that the method of calculating the hourly overtime rate inadequately accounts for the premium paid to those who work the nightshifts. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (McMahon, <i>J.</i>) dismissed, and plaintiffs moved for leave to file an amended complaint. The proposed amended complaint asserted the different and distinct FLSA claim to be paid wages for time spent in security procedures and in \"donning and doffing\" required protective gear (to use the term of art). Judge McMahon denied the motion for leave to amend as futile.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suit against Entergy asserted claims which were substantially similar to those in the proposed amended complaint against Con Ed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The district court (Robinson, <i>J.</i>) granted Entergy's motion to dismiss, and denied plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend as futile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, each case presents the question whether ingress and egress and donning and doffing are compensable under the FLSA. Also at issue is the propriety of Con Ed's method of calculating plaintiffs' hourly overtime rate. There are also state law claims; but it is stipulated that those claims are controlled by our adjudication of the FLSA claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The FLSA, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 201 <i>et seq.,</i> was enacted to ensure that employees receive a \"fair day's pay for a fair day's work,\" <i>Overnight Motor Transp. Co. v. Missel,</i> 316 U.S. 572, 578, 62 S.Ct. 1216, 86 L.Ed. 1682 (1942) (quoting 81 Cong. Rec. 4983 (1937) (message of President Franklin D. Roosevelt)), <i>superseded by statute,</i> Portal-to-Portal Act, 61 Stat. 86-87, <i>as recognized in Trans World Airlines v. Thurston,</i> 469 U.S. 111, 128 n. 22, 105 S.Ct. 613, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985). On the pay end, the FLSA \"guarantee[s] compensation for all work or employment engaged in by employees covered by the Act.\" <i>Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R. Co. v. Muscoda Local No. 123,</i> 321 U.S. 590, 602-03, 64 S.Ct. 698, 88 L.Ed. 949 (1944). But not all work-related activities constitute \"work or employment\" that must be compensated. <i>Kavanagh v. Grand Union Co., Inc.,</i> 192 F.3d 269, 271-72 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a short-lived 1946 holding, the Supreme Court construed the FLSA to require pay for the time employees spent walking on the employer's premises before clocking in, and for donning and doffing aprons and overalls. <i>Anderson v. Mount Clemens Pottery Co.,</i> 328 U.S. 680, 691-93, 66 S.Ct. 1187, 90 L.Ed. 1515 (1946), <i>superseded by statute,</i> Portal-to-Portal Act, 61 Stat. 86-87, <i>as recognized in Reich v. N.Y. City Transit Auth.,</i> 45 F.3d 646, 649 (2d Cir.1995). In 1947, the Portal-to-Portal Act created two exceptions from FLSA-mandated compensation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">which occur either prior to the time on any particular workday at which such employee commences, or subsequent to the time on any particular workday at which he ceases, such principal activity or activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 254(a). Each of the two subsections bears upon plaintiffs' claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under subsection (1), no pay is required for travel to and from the place where the employee performs his \"principal activities\"; the FLSA regulations define \"principal activities\" as those \"which the employee is employed to perform.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 790.8(a) (internal quotation marks omitted). Subsection (2) of the Portal-to-Portal Act undid the <i>Anderson</i> holding that required compensation for putting on aprons and overalls, and thus \"was intended to relieve employers from liability for preliminaries, most of them relatively effortless, that were thought to fall outside the conventional expectations and customs of compensation.\" <i>N.Y. City Transit Auth.,</i> 45 F.3d at 649. A substantial body of case law discusses subsection (2)'s distinction between (on the one hand) preliminary and postliminary activities and (on the other) the principal activities of employment; but the distinction remains elusive in application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nine years after the Portal-to-Portal Act, the Supreme Court considered whether changing clothes and showering were among the principal work activities for workers at a battery plant who \"must make extensive use of dangerously caustic and toxic materials, and are compelled by circumstances, including vital considerations of health and hygiene, to change clothes and to shower.\" <i>Steiner v. Mitchell,</i> 350 U.S. 247, 248, 76 S.Ct. 330, 100 L.Ed. 267 (1956). After allowing that preliminary and postliminary \"changing clothes and showering under normal conditions\" were indisputably non-compensable, <i>id.</i> at 249, 76 S.Ct. 330, the Court described the highly corrosive and toxic substances that permeate the battery plant, and ruled that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">activities performed either before or after the regular work shift . . . are compensable under the portal-to-portal provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act if those activities are an <i>integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered workmen are employed</i> and are not specifically excluded by [subsection 1 of the Portal-to-Portal Act].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 256, 76 S.Ct. 330 (emphasis added). Thus, after <i>Steiner,</i> activities that are \"integral and indispensable\" to principal activities are compensable under the FLSA (as well as the principal activities themselves).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day <i>Steiner</i> issued, the Supreme Court decided a slaughterhouse case, holding that knife-sharpening is \"an integral part of and indispensable to the various butchering activities for which [the workers] were principally employed.\" <i>Mitchell v. King Packing Co.,</i> 350 U.S. 260, 263, 76 S.Ct. 337, 100 L.Ed. 282 (1956). The <i>Mitchell</i> Court shed light on the meaning of \"integral\" (as used in <i>Steiner</i>): sharpening knives is both indispensable to the task of butchering animals, and intrinsically \"connected with\" it. <i>Id.</i> at 262, 76 S.Ct. 337. The Court cited the testimony of a supervisor to the effect that \"a dull knife would slow down production . . ., affect the appearance of the meat as well as the quality of the hides, cause waste and make for accidents; `that a knife to be of any practical value in a knife job has to be sharp.'\" <i>Id.</i> (ellipses omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a more recent case, <i>IBP v. Alvarez,</i> the parties left uncontested the finding that the donning and doffing of \"unique protective gear\" constitute \"principal activities\"; at issue in the Supreme Court was: whether employees must be paid for time waiting to enter the locker room, time in transit from the locker room to the job-site, and time in transit back to the locker room. 546 U.S. 21, 29-30, 39-40, 126 S.Ct. 514, 163 L.Ed.2d 288 (2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court first held that \"any activity that is `integral and indispensable' to a `principal activity' is itself a `principal activity' under . . . the Portal-to-Portal Act.\" <i>Id.</i> at 37, 126 S.Ct. 514. Since it was uncontested that the specialized protective gear was \"integral and indispensable\" under <i>Steiner,</i> the donning and doffing was itself a \"principal activity.\" And because employees are paid for a continuous workday&#8212;which begins with the first principal activity and ends with the last&#8212;the Portal-to-Portal Act has no application once the workday has begun. <i>Id.</i> at 28-29, 126 S.Ct. 514 (citing 29 C.F.R. &#167; 790.6(a)). Therefore, \"during a continuous workday, any walking time that occurs after the beginning of the employee's first principal activity and before the end of the employee's last principal activity is [compensable].\" <i>Id.</i> at 37, 126 S.Ct. 514.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the Court held that awaiting the first principal activity of the workday is not itself a principal activity, <i>id.</i> at 40, 126 S.Ct. 514; it cited 29 C.F.R. &#167; 790.7(g), which \"characterizes the time that employees must spend waiting to check in . . . as generally a `preliminary' activity covered by the Portal-to-Portal Act.\" <i>Id.</i> at 41-42, 126 S.Ct. 514. As the Court emphasized, \"the fact that certain preshift activities are necessary for employees to engage in their principal activities does not mean that those preshift activities are `integral and indispensable' to a `principal activity' under <i>Steiner.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 40-41, 126 S.Ct. 514.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the Indian Point employees can perform the tasks for which they were hired, they spend between ten and thirty minutes a day passing through multiple layers of security and suiting up. Am. Compl. &#182; 19. The question is whether these activities are \"`integral and indispensable' to a `principal activity' under <i>Steiner,</i>\" <i>IBP,</i> 546 U.S. at 39-40, 126 S.Ct. 514, and therefore (under <i>IBP</i>) principal activities in themselves. If so, they are compensable under the FLSA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> a district court's grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). <i>E &amp; L Consulting, Ltd. v. Doman Indus. Ltd.,</i> 472 F.3d 23, 28 (2d Cir.2006). For the purpose of such a review, this Court must accept as true all allegations in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <i>Taylor v. Vt. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 313 F.3d 768, 776 (2d Cir.2002). Generally, we review a district court's denial of a motion to amend under the abuse of discretion standard. <i>Commander Oil Corp. v. Barlo Equip. Corp.,</i> 215 F.3d 321, 333 (2d Cir.2000). \"However, if the denial of leave to amend is based upon a legal interpretation . . . we review [it] <i>de novo.</i>\" <i>Littlejohn v. Artuz,</i> 271 F.3d 360, 362 (2d Cir.2001) (<i>per curiam</i>). Here, each district judge denied the motions for leave to amend as futile based on their interpretation of the FLSA; so we review those denials <i>de novo.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 15 of the amended complaint against Entergy (which is substantially similar to the proposed amended complaint against Con Ed, <i>see</i> n. 1, <i>supra</i>) specifies the activities for which pay is sought:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) Waiting in traffic outside the plant entrance;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Badge inspection at the entrance, including a visual check of the interior of the car, and occasional random vehicle inspection (engine, trunk, glove compartment, undercarriage);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) Parking and walking to the command post;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iv) At the command post, waiting in line and passing through a radiation detector, x-ray machine, and explosive material detector;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(v) Waiting in line to swipe an ID badge and to palm a sensor;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(vi) Going to the locker room to obtain and don metal capped safety boots, safety glasses, and a helmet (if applicable);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(vii) Walking to the job-site;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(viii) And at the end of the shift, doing many of these things in reverse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Am.

At the same time, \"it is one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary.\" <i>Cabell v. Markham,</i> 148 F.2d 737, 739 (2d Cir.1945). The caselaw gives better guidance by apt examples: Sharpening the knife is integral to carving a carcass, <i>Mitchell,</i> 350 U.S. at 263, 76 S.Ct. 337; powering up and testing an x-ray machine is integral to taking x-rays, <i>Kosakow v. New Rochelle Radiology Assocs., P.C.,</i> 274 F.3d 706, 717-18 (2d Cir. 2001); and feeding, training and walking the dog is integral to the work of a K-9 officer, <i>Reich v. N.Y. City Transit Auth.,</i> 45 F.3d 646 (2d Cir.1995), <i>limited in part by IBP,</i> 546 U.S. at 21, 126 S.Ct. 514. <i>See also IBP,</i> 546 U.S. at 40-41, 126 S.Ct. 514 (observing that activities which are \"necessary\" (or indispensable) to a principal activity are not thereby \"integral and indispensable\"); 29 C.F.R. &#167; 790.7(d) (noting, for example, that \"the carrying by a logger of a portable power saw or other heavy equipment (as distinguished from ordinary hand tools) on his trip into the woods to the cutting area . . . is not <i>segregable from</i> the simultaneous performance of his assigned work\" and is thus integral to his principal activities) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Steiner</i> is in one sense the most apt analog, dealing as it does with donning and doffing gear that protects against workplace dangers that transcend ordinary risks. At issue in <i>Steiner</i> was exposure to corrosive and toxic substances that permeated a battery plant; at issue here is the security of a nuclear power plant. The analogy is, however, unsustainable. The <i>Steiner</i> opinion invites a narrow interpretation: \"[I]t would be difficult to conjure up an instance where changing clothes and showering are more clearly an integral and indispensable part of the principal activity of the employment than in the case of these employees.\" 350 U.S. at 256, 76 S.Ct. 330. Without the taking of the measures required, the environment of the battery plant could not sustain life&#8212;given the toxic substances in liquid, solid, powder and vapor form (and in the dust of the air) that \"permeate[d] the entire [battery] plant and everything and everyone in it.\" <i>Id.</i> at 249, 250, 76 S.Ct. 330. <i>Steiner</i> therefore supports the view that when work is done in a lethal atmosphere, the measures that allow entry and immersion into the destructive element may be integral to all work done there, just as a diver's donning of wetsuit, oxygen tank and mouthpiece may be integral to the work even though it is not the (underwater) task that the employer wishes done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, the activities for which plaintiffs here seek compensation, while arguably indispensable, are not integral to their principal activities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Ingress and Egress Security Procedures</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The activities required to enter and exit Indian Point&#8212;from waiting in line at the vehicle entrance through the final card-swipe and handprint analysis&#8212;are necessary in the sense that they are required and serve essential purposes of security; but they are not integral to principal work activities. These security-related activities are modern paradigms of the preliminary and postliminary activities described in the Portal-to-Portal Act, in particular, travel time. The plain wording of subsection (1) of the Portal-to-Portal Act exempts from the FLSA: \"walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 254(a)(1); <i>see also</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 790.7(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that the Portal-to-Portal Act was enacted when the time-consuming security measures at issue may not have been envisioned, and there is some force to the observation that security measures at sensitive facilities (and elsewhere) are becoming increasingly invasive, layered and time-consuming. But the text of the statute does not depend on the purpose of any preliminaries, or how much time such preliminaries may consume. Travel time was held to be \"normal\" (and therefore outside the FLSA) in <i>Kavanagh v. Grand Union Co., Inc.,</i> even though the plaintiff (who performed mechanical services in defendant's supermarkets) commuted five to nine hours a day depending on the supermarkets to which he was dispatched. 192 F.3d 269, 272-73 (2d Cir. 1999).

The plain wording of subsection (1) of the Portal-to-Portal Act exempts from the FLSA: \"walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 254(a)(1); <i>see also</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 790.7(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that the Portal-to-Portal Act was enacted when the time-consuming security measures at issue may not have been envisioned, and there is some force to the observation that security measures at sensitive facilities (and elsewhere) are becoming increasingly invasive, layered and time-consuming. But the text of the statute does not depend on the purpose of any preliminaries, or how much time such preliminaries may consume. Travel time was held to be \"normal\" (and therefore outside the FLSA) in <i>Kavanagh v. Grand Union Co., Inc.,</i> even though the plaintiff (who performed mechanical services in defendant's supermarkets) commuted five to nine hours a day depending on the supermarkets to which he was dispatched. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766229\"><a href=\"/opinion/766229/david-kavanagh-v-grand-union-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span>, 272-73 (2d Cir. 1999).
