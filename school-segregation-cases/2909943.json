(collectively “Marina Point”) appeal the district\ncourt’s judgment on the merits in favor of Center for Biologi-\ncal Diversity and Friends of Fawnskin (collectively “the Cen-\nter”) on their claims under the Clean Water Act (CWA),1 and\nunder the Endangered Species Act (ESA).2 Marina Point also\nappeals the district court’s order awarding attorney fees to the\nCenter and the district court’s contempt order. We vacate the\ndistrict court’s judgment on the merits and instruct it to dis-\nmiss for lack of jurisdiction. We reverse the order awarding\nattorney fees and the contempt order.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n\n   Marina Point’s 12.51 acre development project site is\nlocated on the north shore of Big Bear Lake and the east shore\nof Grout Bay in the San Bernardino Mountains. The property\nextends from the edge of the trees to the lake. The land area,\nknown as “Cluster Pines,” had functioned as a tavern, recre-\national vehicle park, campground, and licensed commercial\nmarina from the early 1950’s until 2001. Marina Point\nacquired the property in 1989 in order to develop a residential\ncondominium project upon it.\n\n  After acquiring the property, Marina Point began securing\npermits. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)\n  1\n     The CWA is codified at 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251-1387. More particularly,\nthe claims were brought under 33 U.S.C. §§ 1311, 1342, and 1344.\n   2\n     The ESA is codified at 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531-1544. More particularly, the\nclaims were brought under 16 U.S.C. §§ 1538 and 1540.\n\f9926 CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT\nsolicited public comment, and ultimately concluded that the\nplanned development could go forward. The Corps stated that\nthe United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) had ulti-\nmately determined that the upland portion of the site was not\na suitable bald eagle habitat, and that a consultation pursuant\nto 16 U.S.C. § 1536 was not required. On September 10,\n1991, the Corps granted a permit to Marina Point which\nauthorized it to strengthen the existing shoreline. See 33\nU.S.C. § 1344.\n\n   The permit authorized Marina Point to dredge the adjacent\nshoreline and the interior of the existing marina, and to use\nthe dredged material as fill for building pads on the land.\nMarina Point was forbidden, however, from placing rip-rap3\nat elevations below lake bottom contours, from depositing\nsand below the ordinary high water mark, and from transfer-\nring fill or structures to neighboring wetlands. In order to pro-\ntect bald eagles’ seasonal behavioral habits, it was also barred\nfrom working during the winter months. Besides the permit\nfrom the Corps, Marina Point secured permits from the\nCounty of San Bernardino, the California Department of Fish\nand Game, and Big Bear Municipal Water District. In addi-\ntion, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board\nissued a water discharge requirements order.\n\n   Work began in May 2002, but Marina Point’s permit from\nthe Corps expired on September 10, 2002, after several exten-\nsions. Marina Point graded the land area before the permit\nexpired. On October 7, 2002, Marina Point’s contractor also\nused a grader to remove trees on the land. Moreover, the\nCorps allowed Marina Point to proceed with dredging without\na permit as long as that did not result in more than “incidental\nfallback” of soil within the Corps’ jurisdiction, but the Corps\ndisallowed any pushing or pulling of materials along the lake\nbed.\n  3\n   As used here, rip-rap is rock; it is used to protect shorelines against\nerosion.\n\f      CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT 9927\n   Work resumed at the site in June of 2003 and went on until\nabout July 23, 2003, when the Corps issued a Cease and\nDesist Order to Marina Point. The Corps’ stated reasons for\nthe order were that Marina Point’s use of a dragline bucket,\nrather than a clamshell dredge, caused more than incidental\nfallback of soil, and that the contractor had been temporarily\nstockpiling material below the ordinary high water mark.\n\n  In September 2003, Marina Point requested interim\napproval to resume work. The Corps then issued an Initial\nCorrective Measure Order (ICMO) on October 16, 2003,\nwhich required Marina Point to complete specific remedial\nactions by December 1, 2003. That deadline was extended to\nDecember 24, 2003, because of unforeseen difficulties, such\nas a forest fire in the area.\n\n   In the meantime, the Center had sent a number of notices\nof intent to commence a citizen’s action against Marina Point.4\nThe Center then filed this action on April 7, 2004.\n\n   The district court denied Marina Point’s motion to dismiss\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The case then pro-\nceeded to trial, and on June 12, 2006, the district court issued\nan opinion5 in which it determined that Marina Point had vio-\nlated the CWA and the ESA. Its ensuing judgment on August\n21, 2006, permanently enjoined Marina Point from any devel-\nopment on the site without the court’s prior authorization,\ndirected Marina Point to follow any remedial orders from the\nCorps, and imposed a statutory penalty upon it. Marina Point\nappealed on August 22, 2006.\n\n  Thereafter, the district court awarded attorney fees to the\n  4\n    Notices were issued on June 30, 2003, July 17, 2003, August 8, 2003,\nand December 1, 2003.\n  5\n    Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Marina Point Dev. Assocs., 434 F.\nSupp. 2d 789 (C.D. Cal. 2006) (Center I).\n\f9928 CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT\nCenter as the prevailing party under the CWA and the ESA.\nMarina Point appealed that ruling on February 15, 2007.\n\n  Still later, on November 7, 2007, the district court deter-\nmined that Marina Point was in contempt and issued various\norders as a result. Marina Point appealed that decision on\nNovember 19, 2007.\n\n                 STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n   We review issues of the district court’s subject matter juris-\ndiction de novo. See Satey v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 521\nF.3d 1087, 1090 (9th Cir. 2008). We also review de novo the\nquestion of whether the Center’s notice under the CWA was\nadequate. See Natural Res. Def. Council v. Sw. Marine, Inc.,\n236 F.3d 985, 995-96 (9th Cir. 2000).\n\n                       JURISDICTION\n\n   At the outset, we must consider whether there was federal\njurisdiction over this dispute when the complaint was filed,\nand whether jurisdiction still remains. For the reasons dis-\ncussed below, the answer is no.\n\n  I.   Clean Water Act.\n\n   [1] In general, actions can be brought by private persons\nand entities for the purpose of enforcing many of the provi-\nsions of the CWA. See 33 U.S.C. § 1365(a). That is usually\nreferred to as the citizen suit provision. However, before an\naction is commenced, the citizen must give a 60-day notice of\nintent to sue. Id. § 1365(b)(1)(A). In fact, absent that notice,\nthe action is prohibited. Id.\n\n   [2] The notice serves important public purposes; this kind\nof litigation is not like a mere private dispute. That is under-\nscored by the fact that the notice must be given not only to the\n\f        CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT 9929\nalleged violator,6 but also to the Administrator,7 and to the\nState where the alleged violation occurred.8 The Supreme\nCourt has explicated the purpose behind the requirement of\nnotice in this kind of litigation. As it has pointed out:\n\n        [T]he legislative history indicates an intent to strike\n        a balance between encouraging citizen enforcement\n        of environmental regulations and avoiding burdening\n        the federal courts with excessive numbers of citizen\n        suits. Requiring citizens to comply with the notice\n        and delay requirements serves this congressional\n        goal in two ways. First, notice allows Government\n        agencies to take responsibility for enforcing environ-\n        mental regulations, thus obviating the need for citi-\n        zen suits. . . . Second, notice gives the alleged\n        violator “an opportunity to bring itself into complete\n        compliance with the Act and thus likewise render\n        unnecessary a citizen suit.” This policy would be\n        frustrated if citizens could immediately bring suit\n        without involving federal or state enforcement agen-\n        cies. Giving full effect to the words of the statute\n        preserves the compromise struck by Congress.\n\nHallstrom v. Tillamook County, 493 U.S. 20, 29, 110 S. Ct.\n304, 310, 107 L. Ed. 2d 237 (1989) (citations omitted). That\nhas special relevance here because, as we will explain further,\nthis case is a perfect example of speedy government enforce-\nment; action by the Corps which, in large measure, obviated\nthe need for a citizen suit regarding Marina Point’s alleged\nviolations.\n\n    [3] Moreover, the giving of a 60-day notice is not simply\na    desideratum; it is a jurisdictional necessity. See\n    6\n    33 U.S.C. § 1365(b)(1)(A)(iii).\n    7\n    Id. § 1365(b)(1)(A)(i). The Administrator is the Administrator of the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA). 33 U.S.C. § 1251(d).\n  8\n    33 U.S.C. § 1365(b)(1)(A)(ii).\n\f9930 CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT\nWaterkeepers N. Cal. v. AG Indus. Mfg., Inc., 375 F.3d 913,\n916 (9th Cir. 2004); Natural Res. Def. Council, 236 F.3d at\n995. As the Supreme Court has put it: “Under a literal reading\nof the statute, compliance with the 60-day notice provision is\na mandatory, not optional, condition precedent for suit.” Hal-\nlstrom, 493 U.S. at 26, 110 S. Ct. at 309. And the literal read-\ning is what controls. When a party does not fulfill that\nthreshold requirement, “the district court must dismiss the\naction as barred by the terms of the statute.” Id. at 33, 110\nS. Ct. at 312; see also Waterkeepers, 375 F.3d at 916. That is\nto say, the notice is not just an annoying piece of paper\nintended as a stumbling block for people who want to sue; it\nis purposive in nature and the purpose is to accomplish cor-\nrections where needed without the necessity of a citizen\naction. As the Supreme Court has said in the similar context\nof claims for past violations:\n\n    It follows logically that the purpose of notice to the\n    alleged violator is to give it an opportunity to bring\n    itself into complete compliance with the Act and\n    thus likewise render unnecessary a citizen suit. If we\n    assume, as respondents urge, that citizen suits may\n    target wholly past violations, the requirement of\n    notice to the alleged violator becomes gratuitous.\n    Indeed, respondents, in propounding their interpreta-\n    tion of the Act, can think of no reason for Congress\n    to require such notice other than that “it seemed\n    right” to inform an alleged violator that it was about\n    to be sued.\n\nGwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc.,\n484 U.S. 49, 60, 108 S. Ct. 376, 382-83, 98 L. Ed. 2d 306\n(1987). Here, too, if a citizen suit were brought when correc-\ntion had already been undertaken at the behest of a govern-\nmental agency, the notice would become gratuitous. But, as\nthe Court went on to say: “citizen suits are proper only ‘if the\nFederal, State, and local agencies fail to exercise their\n\f     CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT 9931\nenforcement responsibility.’ ” Id. at 60, 108 S. Ct. at 383\n(citation omitted).\n\n   [4] We must, therefore, keep those overarching public pur-\nposes in mind as we approach the controversy before us. To\naccomplish them, the notice must be sufficient in itself and,\nperforce, if the desired change has been properly delineated\nand has been accomplished, that, too, obviates the need or\npurpose of a citizen suit. That does not exactly say just what\na sufficiently detailed notice might be, but we have guidance\nin that area also.\n\n   We start with the requirements adopted by the EPA. Those\nare as follows:\n\n    Notice regarding an alleged violation of an effluent\n    standard or limitation or of an order with respect\n    thereto, shall include sufficient information to permit\n    the recipient to identify the specific standard, limita-\n    tion, or order alleged to have been violated, the\n    activity alleged to constitute a violation, the person\n    or persons responsible for the alleged violation, the\n    location of the alleged violation, the date or dates of\n    such violation, and the full name, address, and tele-\n    phone number of the person giving notice.\n\n40 C.F.R. § 135.3(a). It is from that specific and clear state-\nment that our later cases have proceeded.\n\n   We have sometimes been slightly forgiving to plaintiffs in\nthis area, but even at our most lenient we have never aban-\ndoned the requirement that there be a true notice that tells a\ntarget precisely what it allegedly did wrong, and when. The\ntarget is not required to play a guessing game in that respect.\nIn one case, we determined that where the difficulty was a\nkind of negative — the failure to prepare a plan to avoid pol-\nlution — a specific date of wrongdoing could not be given\nbecause there was no specific date. Natural Res. Def. Council,\n\f9932 CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT\n236 F.3d at 996. We chose not to demand the impossible.\nThus, the notice sufficed.\n\n   In two later cases in 2002, we also relaxed to some extent.\nIn one of the cases, the plaintiff’s notice set forth a series of\ntwelve specific violations on specific dates, but the complaint\nincluded numerous other violations within the same time\nframe. Cmty. Ass’n for Restoration of the Env’t v. Henry\nBosma Dairy, 305 F.3d 943, 951-52 (9th Cir. 2002). The\ndefendant complained about the added dates, but we said that\nthe notice certainly alerted the defendant to what it was doing\nwrong and the inclusion of specific dates was, under the cir-\ncumstances, enough to allow an action regarding discharges\non other dates at or about the same time and of the same ilk\nas those listed. Id. at 953. As we put it, “[b]ased on the fact\nthat the violations originated from the same source, were of\nthe same nature, and were easily identifiable, we find that [the\nplaintiffs’] notice was adequate.” Id. The other case presented\nthe same kind of issue. There, fourteen dates of alleged\nwrongdoing were listed in the notice, and the notice also\nstated that while all dates were not available to the plaintiff,\nthe wrongdoing occurred on each date that ships were loaded\nat the defendant’s facility. S.F. BayKeeper, Inc. v. Tosco\nCorp., 309 F.3d 1153, 1158 (9th Cir. 2002). We found that\nthe detail was sufficient under the circumstances because\nfrom the specifics given, the defendants could readily ascer-\ntain “the nature of the alleged violations, as well as the likely\ndates of those violations.” Id. at 1159.\n\n   We followed the same general approach in a later case\nwhere the defendant was accused in a detailed ten-page letter\nof improper discharges during each and every rain event of a\ncertain intensity, and the days of that rain event intensity were\nlisted. See Waterkeepers N. Cal., 375 F.3d at 917. We\ndeclared that to be sufficient detail. Id. at 917-18.\n\n  On the other hand, when a notice told the defendant that it\nhad committed one specific violation, the defendant was not\n\f     CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT 9933\n“required to speculate as to all possible attacks . . . that might\nbe added to a citizen suit” at a later time. ONRC Action v.\nColumbia Plywood, Inc., 286 F.3d 1137, 1143 (9th Cir. 2002).\nWe found that the notice was insufficient, except as to timeli-\nness, and that the claim was in error. We then explained:\n“[b]ecause timeliness was the sole challenge raised in the\nnotice, it was reasonable to conclude that no action in\nresponse to ONRC’s 60-day notice was required.” Id. Also,\nechoing the Supreme Court’s concerns, we went on to state:\n\n    Had ONRC’s notice specified its other theories,\n    either Oregon or the EPA might well have decided\n    that those theories had sufficient merit to call for\n    agency action. Were we to exercise jurisdiction over\n    such claims when they were not disclosed by the cit-\n    izen suit notice, we would usurp the right of the\n    applicable governmental agencies to evaluate and act\n    upon the merits of the claims prior to judicial review.\n\nId. at 1144.\n\n   Earlier on, when faced with a notice that did not list all of\nthe complaining parties, we declared that for purposes of an\naction by those not listed, the notice was fatally insufficient.\nWash. Trout v. McCain Foods, Inc., 45 F.3d 1351, 1354-55\n(9th Cir. 1995). We did so despite an assertion by the plain-\ntiffs that the error was technical and we should not be overly\nstrict. Id. at 1354. We rejected that notion. Id. By the way, the\nnotice in that case also had a deficiency regarding dates, but\nwe did not address that. See id. at 1352.\n\n   In short, the requirements set forth in 40 C.F.R. § 135.3(a)\nare not to be looked upon as mere technicalities to be\naccepted with cold reserve and embraced with velleity. They\nare to be taken seriously as a means of carrying out important\npublic policies. Our deviations from their precise language\nhave been minor.\n\f9934 CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT\n   [5] When those authorities and their principles are used as\na yardstick, it is apparent that the notices in this case were not\nsufficient to support district court jurisdiction. An analysis of\nthe notices will explain why that is so. The first of the notices\non June 30, 2003, declared that “Section 404 of the CWA”9\nwas being violated by activities that began June 17, 2003,\nwhich activities were placing “enormous amounts of fill” into\nthe lake and were accompanied by grading below the ordinary\nhigh water mark. The notice did not mention any claims under\n§ 402 of the CWA,10 nor did it give any detail whatsoever\nregarding just what “wetlands” were allegedly being affected\nor how.11 It also gave no other specific dates. The second of\nthe notices, dated July 17, 2003, is of the same ilk. It gives lit-\ntle more detail about the activities regarding the lake itself and\nno more detail regarding wetlands or § 402. Those notices are\nquestionable regarding § 404 violations and insufficient\nregarding wetlands and any claimed § 402 violations.12\n\n   [6] What is of even more significance, however, is that long\nbefore any action was filed and, in fact, before 60 days had\ngone by, the Corps issued its cease and desist order on July\n23, 2003, and all activity by Marina Point regarding the lake\nstopped as it had to. That, in fact, is reflected in the Center’s\nthird notice, on August 8, 2003, wherein it stated that the\nactivities it complained of occurred each day from June 17,\n2003, through July 25, 2003.\n  9\n    33 U.S.C. § 1344.\n  10\n      33 U.S.C. § 1342.\n   11\n      That is especially problematic here because it is doubtful that Marina\nPoint’s own land was itself wetlands at all. See, e.g., 33 C.F.R. § 330.3;\nUnited States v. S. Inv. Co., 876 F.2d 606, 613 (8th Cir. 1989). The Corps\ndid not (and does not) think so. Marina Point could hardly have guessed\nat what the Center was speaking about.\n   12\n      It is interesting to note that even in its complaint and in the ultimate\npretrial conference order in this action in the district court, there is no\nmention of a § 402 claim.\n\f     CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT 9935\n   The third notice then goes on to claim violations in lan-\nguage even less descriptive than that used in the prior notices.\nIt refers only to piles of material that were causing discharges\nbelow the ordinary high water mark of the lake, and declares\nthat the situation could be made worse should it rain. As we\nsee it, that level of generality, again, is not really compatible\nwith the purposes of the notice requirements under the CWA.\n\n   [7] But, even if it were sufficient in that regard, here again\nthe Corps stepped in to obviate and ameliorate any problems.\nJust slightly over 60 days later and before commencement of\nthis action, the Corps issued its October 16, 2003, ICMO\nauthorizing and directing Marina Point to perform and com-\nplete a number of corrective measures by December 1, 2003,\nfor the purpose of protecting the lake from the kinds of prob-\nlems alluded to by the August 8, 2003, notice. It is also nota-\nble that although the Corps’ ICMO was issued nine days after\nthe 60 days had expired, Marina Point had applied for permis-\nsion to undertake that work on September 25, 2003, which\nwas before the 60 days had run. Of course, Marina Point\ncould not have been expected to actually begin correcting per-\nceived § 404 problems regarding the lake without obtaining\npermission from the Corps. In short, as weak as it was, the\nnotice had done its job, if, indeed, the job was not being done\nwithout the notice.\n\n   That leaves the December 1, 2003, notice, which is, if any-\nthing, even less informative and helpful than the earlier\nnotices. Principally, it asserts that Marina Point was going\nforward without the coverage of the ICMO because that docu-\nment said that work was to cease by December 1, 2003. How-\never, the Center was in error because, due to problems that\nhad developed, the Corps, after consultation with FWS,\nextended the date to December 24, 2003. As it was, the work\nceased by December 17, 2003. It is difficult to see what\nMarina Point was supposed to do about that portion of the\nnotice. Probably nothing. See Columbia Plywood, 286 F.3d at\n1143. Beyond that, the Center indicated that it could not really\n\f9936 CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT\ntell if the work was proceeding pursuant to the terms of the\nICMO. That, too, was hardly the kind of notice that the CWA\ncontemplates.\n\n   [8] In fine, the notices were insufficient at their inception\nregarding wetlands and possible § 402 violations, and to the\nextent that they were sufficient, if barely so, as to possible\n§ 404 violations, their efficiency was limited by prompt Corps\nand Marina Point action. That is to say, in light of the defects\nin the notices, and in light of the fact that the Corps and\nMarina Point did act to cease the activities that the Center\nclaimed were wrongful and even acted to effect ongoing\nrepairs for any problems caused by past activities, the district\ncourt did not have jurisdiction to hear the CWA action. It\nshould have dismissed the action at the outset. Thus, in this\nrespect the district court’s judgment must fall for lack of juris-\ndiction, and must be vacated.\n\n  II.   Endangered Species Act\n\n   Plaintiffs were also required to give notice before bringing\nan action under the ESA. See 16 U.S.C. § 1540(g)(2). There\nis no claim that the notice was not sufficient in that respect,\nand it does appear to be proper. However, there is a different\nproblem here — mootness.\n\n   [9] The ESA allows a citizen suit for the purpose of obtain-\ning injunctive relief only. Id. at (g)(1)(A). Of course, that is\nforward looking, and is intended to prevent a defendant from\ntaking an endangered or threatened species. See id.\n§ 1538(a)(1)(B); 50 C.F.R. §17.31. That means that a person\nmay not harass or harm a listed species. See 16 U.S.C.\n§ 1532(19). Here, the claim was that Marina Point’s activities\nand planned project would harass bald eagles by disrupting\ntheir “normal behavioral patterns.” See 50 C.F.R. § 17.3.\n\n  [10] The problem is that less than a year after the district\n\f        CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT 9937\ncourt’s judgment was issued13 and, of course, while this case\nwas still on appeal, the FWS delisted the bald eagle.14 There-\nfore, whatever might have been the case previously, Marina\nPoint cannot violate the ESA regarding the bald eagle, regard-\nless of any decision we render here.\n\n   [11] As we explained in Council of Ins. Agents & Brokers\nv. Molasky-Arman, 522 F.3d 925, 933 (9th Cir. 2008) (cita-\ntions omitted):\n\n          “To qualify as a case fit for federal-court adjudica-\n       tion, an actual controversy must be extant at all\n       stages of review, not merely at the time the com-\n       plaint is filed.” “A claim is moot when the issues\n       presented are no longer live or the parties lack a\n       legally cognizable interest in the outcome. The basic\n       question is whether there exists a present contro-\n       versy as to which effective relief can be granted.”\n\nBecause the bald eagle has been delisted, no present contro-\nversy can remain.\n\n   In Humane Society of the United States v. Kempthorne, 527\nF.3d 181 (D.C. Cir. 2008), the Court of Appeals for the Dis-\ntrict of Columbia Circuit was faced with a similar situation.\nIn that case, while litigation regarding protection for the gray\nwolf was on appeal, the wolf was removed from the endan-\ngered species list. Id. at 182. That being so, the parties agreed\nthat the case had necessarily become moot, and the court\naccepted that agreement. Id. The specific reason for that was\nnot explicated but, no doubt, it appeared obvious to all con-\ncerned that there was no further work to be served by an\ninjunction. Cf. Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Norton, 254\n  13\n   The judgment was entered August 21, 2006.\n  14\n   See Endangered & Threatened Wildlife & Plants; Removing the Bald\nEagle in the Lower 48 States From the List of Endangered & Threatened\nWildlife, 72 Fed. Reg. 37,346 (July 9, 2007).\n\f9938 CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT\nF.3d 833, 837 n.4 (9th Cir. 2001) (stating that where suit\nbrought to force action regarding a frog, once the frog was\nlisted the case became moot).\n\n   The same appears here. Now that the bald eagle has been\ndelisted, nothing we decide can properly give the Center the\nrelief it sought. If the district court erred, the injunction must\nfall, but if the district court was correct, the injunction must\nstill fall because no activities by Marina Point could constitute\na take within the meaning of the ESA. In fact, in a letter to\nthis court, the Center has conceded mootness.\n\n   [12] Thus, there is no further jurisdiction to proceed, and\nthe district court’s judgment under the ESA must be vacated.\n\n                       OTHER ISSUES\n\n  I.   Attorney Fees\n\n   The district court awarded attorney fees to the Center and\nagainst Marina Point on both the CWA and the ESA claims.\nIt did not segregate the two. Nevertheless, because, as more\nparticularly set forth below, fees cannot be awarded on either\nclaim, the entire award must fall.\n\n  A.   CWA\n\n   [13] The CWA provides for an award of attorney fees “to\nany prevailing or substantially prevailing party” when the\ncourt deems that to be appropriate. 33 U.S.C. § 1365(d). As\nwe have already discussed, the district court was without sub-\nject matter jurisdiction over the CWA claim. Therefore, the\naward of fees must fall to the extent that it is based upon that\nclaim.\n\n  B.   ESA\n\n   The ESA provides for an award of attorney fees “whenever\nthe court determines such award is appropriate.” 16 U.S.C.\n\f       CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT 9939\n§ 1540(g)(4). While that is not the typical prevailing party\nlanguage, it is apparent that it must be taken to mean and be\nlimited to an award of fees to parties who prevail. See Mar-\nbled Murrelet v. Babbitt, 182 F.3d 1091, 1095 (9th Cir. 1999);\nsee also Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U.S. 680, 693-94,\n103 S. Ct. 3274, 3282, 77 L. Ed. 2d 938 (1983) (in a Clean\nAir Act case, with the same language as that in the ESA,\nabsent “some degree of success on the merits” an award of\nattorney fees is not “appropriate.”). Thus, to be entitled to an\naward, the Center must be a prevailing party.\n\n   The ESA claim became moot due to the delisting of the\nbald eagle. Still, it can be cogently argued that if the district\ncourt judgment were valid and enforceable as to that claim,\nthe period between its issuance (April 21, 2006) and the date\nof delisting (July 9, 2007), gave relief and bald eagle protec-\ntion, so some award may well be appropriate. See Richard S.\nv. Dep’t of Developmental Servs. of Cal., 317 F.3d 1080,\n1088-89 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that fact that case becomes\nmoot does not eliminate right to fees); Williams v. Alioto, 625\nF.2d 845, 847-48 (9th Cir. 1980) (per curiam) (same).\n\n   [14] However, we have carefully reviewed the record and\nwe are satisfied that the evidence cannot support a determina-\ntion15 that Marina Point caused, or would have caused, a take\nof a bald eagle. See 16 U.S.C. §§ 1538(a)(1)(B),\n1539(a)(1)(B); 50 C.F.R. § 17.31(a); see also Sw. Ctr. for Bio-\nlogical Diversity v. Berg, 268 F.3d 810, 814 (9th Cir. 2001).\nThe statute defines “take” as “to harass, harm, pursue, hunt,\nshoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to\nengage in any such conduct.” 16 U.S.C. § 1532(19). There is\nno claim that Marina Point harmed bald eagles. It is claimed\nthat Marina Point harassed, or would harass, them. Harass\nmeans “an intentional or negligent act or omission which\n  15\n    See Friends of Yosemite Valley v. Norton, 348 F.3d 789, 793 (9th Cir.\n2003); see also Silver v. Executive Car Leasing Long-Term Disability\nPlan, 466 F.3d 727, 732-33 (9th Cir. 2006).”\n\f9940 CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT\ncreates the likelihood of injury to wildlife by annoying it to\nsuch an extent as to significantly disrupt normal behavioral\npatterns . . . .” 50 C.F.R. § 17.3. However, taking all of the\nevidence together, there was no basis for a finding that there\nwas some sort of rational causal connection between Marina\nPoint’s activities and any disruption of the behavioral patterns\nof the bald eagle. See Cold Mountain v. Garber, 375 F.3d\n884, 889-90 (9th Cir. 2004); Defenders of Wildlife v. Bernal,\n204 F.3d 920, 925-27 (9th Cir. 2000); Pyramid Lake Paiute\nTribe of Indians v. U.S. Dep’t of Navy, 898 F.2d 1410,\n1419-20 (9th Cir. 1990). That being so, the district court’s\njudgment in favor of the Center would have to have been\nreversed, even if the claim had not become moot. Because of\nthat, it cannot be said that the Center ultimately prevailed on\nthe merits.16\n\n    [15] Therefore, the judgment must fall in its entirety, and\nthe attorney fees awarded to the Center must fall along with\nit.\n\n  II.   Contempt\n\n   [16] Because, as we have already demonstrated, the district\ncourt’s August 21, 2006, judgment must fall for lack of juris-\ndiction, whether the contempt order expanded or merely\nexplicated the judgment,17 that order must inexorably fall\nalong with the judgment.18 In addition, to the extent that the\n  16\n      The mere fact that the Center achieved a preliminary injunction will\nnot support an award of fees. See Sole v. Wyner, ___ U.S. ___, __, 127\nS. Ct. 2188, 2195, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (2007) (“Prevailing party status, we\nhold, does not attend achievement of a preliminary injunction that is\nreversed, dissolved or otherwise undone by the final decision in the same\ncase.”)\n   17\n      See A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 284 F.3d 1091, 1098-99 (9th\nCir. 2002); Mayweathers v. Newland, 258 F.3d 930, 935 (9th Cir. 2001).\n   18\n      We do note that even if we were required to consider the merits of that\norder, it would necessarily have to be set aside. It is plain that no develop-\nment on the project site took place. And it is equally plain that Marina\nPoint did not fail to take measures directed by the Corps. In short, Marina\nPoint cannot be said to have violated the terms of the judgment at all,\nmuch less to have done so contemptuously.\n\f       CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT 9941\ncontempt order was premised on violations of the ESA\ninjunction, it fails because that injunction would be reversed\non the merits were it not moot. Kirkland v. Legion Ins. Co.,\n343 F.3d 1135, 1142 (9th Cir. 2003) (“The validity of a con-\ntempt adjudication is based on the legitimacy of the underly-\ning order.”); Davies v. Grossmont Union High Sch. Dist., 903\nF.2d 1390, 1394 (9th Cir. 1991); Scott & Fetzer Co. v. Dile,\n643 F.2d 670, 675 (9th Cir. 1981). We will, therefore, reverse\nit.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n   The district court determined that Marina Point had vio-\nlated the CWA and had either violated or would violate the\nESA. See Center I, 434 F. Supp. at 795-98. However, because\nit lacked jurisdiction over the CWA claims and because the\nESA claims have become moot, we vacate its judgment and\nremand with directions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\nConcomitantly, we reverse the award of attorney fees and the\ncontempt order.\n\n   Judgment After Trial on the merits (No. 06-56193)\nVACATED and REMANDED with instructions to DISMISS\nfor mootness (ESA) and lack of jurisdiction (CWA).19 Order\nAwarding Attorney Fees (No. 07-55243) and Order of Con-\ntempt (No. 07-56574) REVERSED.\n\n\n\n\n  19\n    The district court’s opinion is also vacated.

(collectively “Marina Point”) appeal the district\ncourt’s judgment on the merits in favor of Center for Biologi-\ncal Diversity and Friends of Fawnskin (collectively “the Cen-\nter”) on their claims under the Clean Water Act (CWA),1 and\nunder the Endangered Species Act (ESA).2 Marina Point also\nappeals the district court’s order awarding attorney fees to the\nCenter and the district court’s contempt order. We vacate the\ndistrict court’s judgment on the merits and instruct it to dis-\nmiss for lack of jurisdiction. We reverse the order awarding\nattorney fees and the contempt order.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n\n   Marina Point’s 12.51 acre development project site is\nlocated on the north shore of Big Bear Lake and the east shore\nof Grout Bay in the San Bernardino Mountains. The property\nextends from the edge of the trees to the lake. The land area,\nknown as “Cluster Pines,” had functioned as a tavern, recre-\national vehicle park, campground, and licensed commercial\nmarina from the early 1950’s until 2001. Marina Point\nacquired the property in 1989 in order to develop a residential\ncondominium project upon it.\n\n  After acquiring the property, Marina Point began securing\npermits. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)\n  1\n     The CWA is codified at 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251-1387. More particularly,\nthe claims were brought under 33 U.S.C. §§ 1311, 1342, and 1344.\n   2\n     The ESA is codified at 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531-1544. More particularly, the\nclaims were brought under 16 U.S.C. §§ 1538 and 1540.\n\f9926 CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT\nsolicited public comment, and ultimately concluded that the\nplanned development could go forward. The Corps stated that\nthe United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) had ulti-\nmately determined that the upland portion of the site was not\na suitable bald eagle habitat, and that a consultation pursuant\nto 16 U.S.C. § 1536 was not required. On September 10,\n1991, the Corps granted a permit to Marina Point which\nauthorized it to strengthen the existing shoreline. See 33\nU.S.C. § 1344.\n\n   The permit authorized Marina Point to dredge the adjacent\nshoreline and the interior of the existing marina, and to use\nthe dredged material as fill for building pads on the land.\nMarina Point was forbidden, however, from placing rip-rap3\nat elevations below lake bottom contours, from depositing\nsand below the ordinary high water mark, and from transfer-\nring fill or structures to neighboring wetlands. In order to pro-\ntect bald eagles’ seasonal behavioral habits, it was also barred\nfrom working during the winter months. Besides the permit\nfrom the Corps, Marina Point secured permits from the\nCounty of San Bernardino, the California Department of Fish\nand Game, and Big Bear Municipal Water District. In addi-\ntion, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board\nissued a water discharge requirements order.\n\n   Work began in May 2002, but Marina Point’s permit from\nthe Corps expired on September 10, 2002, after several exten-\nsions. Marina Point graded the land area before the permit\nexpired. On October 7, 2002, Marina Point’s contractor also\nused a grader to remove trees on the land. Moreover, the\nCorps allowed Marina Point to proceed with dredging without\na permit as long as that did not result in more than “incidental\nfallback” of soil within the Corps’ jurisdiction, but the Corps\ndisallowed any pushing or pulling of materials along the lake\nbed.\n  3\n   As used here, rip-rap is rock; it is used to protect shorelines against\nerosion.\n\f      CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT 9927\n   Work resumed at the site in June of 2003 and went on until\nabout July 23, 2003, when the Corps issued a Cease and\nDesist Order to Marina Point. The Corps’ stated reasons for\nthe order were that Marina Point’s use of a dragline bucket,\nrather than a clamshell dredge, caused more than incidental\nfallback of soil, and that the contractor had been temporarily\nstockpiling material below the ordinary high water mark.\n\n  In September 2003, Marina Point requested interim\napproval to resume work. The Corps then issued an Initial\nCorrective Measure Order (ICMO) on October 16, 2003,\nwhich required Marina Point to complete specific remedial\nactions by December 1, 2003. That deadline was extended to\nDecember 24, 2003, because of unforeseen difficulties, such\nas a forest fire in the area.\n\n   In the meantime, the Center had sent a number of notices\nof intent to commence a citizen’s action against Marina Point.4\nThe Center then filed this action on April 7, 2004.\n\n   The district court denied Marina Point’s motion to dismiss\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The case then pro-\nceeded to trial, and on June 12, 2006, the district court issued\nan opinion5 in which it determined that Marina Point had vio-\nlated the CWA and the ESA. Its ensuing judgment on August\n21, 2006, permanently enjoined Marina Point from any devel-\nopment on the site without the court’s prior authorization,\ndirected Marina Point to follow any remedial orders from the\nCorps, and imposed a statutory penalty upon it.

For the reasons dis-\ncussed below, the answer is no.\n\n  I.   Clean Water Act.\n\n   [1] In general, actions can be brought by private persons\nand entities for the purpose of enforcing many of the provi-\nsions of the CWA. See 33 U.S.C. § 1365(a). That is usually\nreferred to as the citizen suit provision. However, before an\naction is commenced, the citizen must give a 60-day notice of\nintent to sue. Id. § 1365(b)(1)(A). In fact, absent that notice,\nthe action is prohibited. Id.\n\n   [2] The notice serves important public purposes; this kind\nof litigation is not like a mere private dispute. That is under-\nscored by the fact that the notice must be given not only to the\n\f        CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT 9929\nalleged violator,6 but also to the Administrator,7 and to the\nState where the alleged violation occurred.8 The Supreme\nCourt has explicated the purpose behind the requirement of\nnotice in this kind of litigation. As it has pointed out:\n\n        [T]he legislative history indicates an intent to strike\n        a balance between encouraging citizen enforcement\n        of environmental regulations and avoiding burdening\n        the federal courts with excessive numbers of citizen\n        suits. Requiring citizens to comply with the notice\n        and delay requirements serves this congressional\n        goal in two ways. First, notice allows Government\n        agencies to take responsibility for enforcing environ-\n        mental regulations, thus obviating the need for citi-\n        zen suits. . . . Second, notice gives the alleged\n        violator “an opportunity to bring itself into complete\n        compliance with the Act and thus likewise render\n        unnecessary a citizen suit.” This policy would be\n        frustrated if citizens could immediately bring suit\n        without involving federal or state enforcement agen-\n        cies. Giving full effect to the words of the statute\n        preserves the compromise struck by Congress.\n\nHallstrom v.

That\nhas special relevance here because, as we will explain further,\nthis case is a perfect example of speedy government enforce-\nment; action by the Corps which, in large measure, obviated\nthe need for a citizen suit regarding Marina Point’s alleged\nviolations.\n\n    [3] Moreover, the giving of a 60-day notice is not simply\na    desideratum; it is a jurisdictional necessity. See\n    6\n    33 U.S.C. § 1365(b)(1)(A)(iii).\n    7\n    Id. § 1365(b)(1)(A)(i).

As the Supreme Court has put it: “Under a literal reading\nof the statute, compliance with the 60-day notice provision is\na mandatory, not optional, condition precedent for suit.” Hal-\nlstrom, 493 U.S. at 26, 110 S. Ct. at 309. And the literal read-\ning is what controls. When a party does not fulfill that\nthreshold requirement, “the district court must dismiss the\naction as barred by the terms of the statute.” Id. at 33, 110\nS. Ct. at 312; see also Waterkeepers, 375 F.3d at 916. That is\nto say, the notice is not just an annoying piece of paper\nintended as a stumbling block for people who want to sue; it\nis purposive in nature and the purpose is to accomplish cor-\nrections where needed without the necessity of a citizen\naction. As the Supreme Court has said in the similar context\nof claims for past violations:\n\n    It follows logically that the purpose of notice to the\n    alleged violator is to give it an opportunity to bring\n    itself into complete compliance with the Act and\n    thus likewise render unnecessary a citizen suit. If we\n    assume, as respondents urge, that citizen suits may\n    target wholly past violations, the requirement of\n    notice to the alleged violator becomes gratuitous.\n    Indeed, respondents, in propounding their interpreta-\n    tion of the Act, can think of no reason for Congress\n    to require such notice other than that “it seemed\n    right” to inform an alleged violator that it was about\n    to be sued.\n\nGwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v.

Here, too, if a citizen suit were brought when correc-\ntion had already been undertaken at the behest of a govern-\nmental agency, the notice would become gratuitous. But, as\nthe Court went on to say: “citizen suits are proper only ‘if the\nFederal, State, and local agencies fail to exercise their\n\f     CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT 9931\nenforcement responsibility.’ ” Id. at 60, 108 S. Ct. at 383\n(citation omitted).\n\n   [4] We must, therefore, keep those overarching public pur-\nposes in mind as we approach the controversy before us. To\naccomplish them, the notice must be sufficient in itself and,\nperforce, if the desired change has been properly delineated\nand has been accomplished, that, too, obviates the need or\npurpose of a citizen suit. That does not exactly say just what\na sufficiently detailed notice might be, but we have guidance\nin that area also.\n\n   We start with the requirements adopted by the EPA. Those\nare as follows:\n\n    Notice regarding an alleged violation of an effluent\n    standard or limitation or of an order with respect\n    thereto, shall include sufficient information to permit\n    the recipient to identify the specific standard, limita-\n    tion, or order alleged to have been violated, the\n    activity alleged to constitute a violation, the person\n    or persons responsible for the alleged violation, the\n    location of the alleged violation, the date or dates of\n    such violation, and the full name, address, and tele-\n    phone number of the person giving notice.\n\n40 C.F.R. § 135.3(a). It is from that specific and clear state-\nment that our later cases have proceeded.\n\n   We have sometimes been slightly forgiving to plaintiffs in\nthis area, but even at our most lenient we have never aban-\ndoned the requirement that there be a true notice that tells a\ntarget precisely what it allegedly did wrong, and when. The\ntarget is not required to play a guessing game in that respect.\nIn one case, we determined that where the difficulty was a\nkind of negative — the failure to prepare a plan to avoid pol-\nlution — a specific date of wrongdoing could not be given\nbecause there was no specific date. Natural Res. Def. Council,\n\f9932 CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT\n236 F.3d at 996. We chose not to demand the impossible.\nThus, the notice sufficed.\n\n   In two later cases in 2002, we also relaxed to some extent.\nIn one of the cases, the plaintiff’s notice set forth a series of\ntwelve specific violations on specific dates, but the complaint\nincluded numerous other violations within the same time\nframe. Cmty. Ass’n for Restoration of the Env’t v. Henry\nBosma Dairy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779338\"><a href=\"/opinion/779338/community-association-for-restoration-of-the-environment-a-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">943</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 951-52 (9th Cir. 2002). The\ndefendant complained about the added dates, but we said that\nthe notice certainly alerted the defendant to what it was doing\nwrong and the inclusion of specific dates was, under the cir-\ncumstances, enough to allow an action regarding discharges\non other dates at or about the same time and of the same ilk\nas those listed. Id. at 953. As we put it, “[b]ased on the fact\nthat the violations originated from the same source, were of\nthe same nature, and were easily identifiable, we find that [the\nplaintiffs’] notice was adequate.” Id. The other case presented\nthe same kind of issue. There, fourteen dates of alleged\nwrongdoing were listed in the notice, and the notice also\nstated that while all dates were not available to the plaintiff,\nthe wrongdoing occurred on each date that ships were loaded\nat the defendant’s facility.

We found that\nthe detail was sufficient under the circumstances because\nfrom the specifics given, the defendants could readily ascer-\ntain “the nature of the alleged violations, as well as the likely\ndates of those violations.” Id. at 1159.\n\n   We followed the same general approach in a later case\nwhere the defendant was accused in a detailed ten-page letter\nof improper discharges during each and every rain event of a\ncertain intensity, and the days of that rain event intensity were\nlisted. See Waterkeepers N. Cal., 375 F.3d at 917. We\ndeclared that to be sufficient detail. Id. at 917-18.\n\n  On the other hand, when a notice told the defendant that it\nhad committed one specific violation, the defendant was not\n\f     CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v.

We then explained:\n“[b]ecause timeliness was the sole challenge raised in the\nnotice, it was reasonable to conclude that no action in\nresponse to ONRC’s 60-day notice was required.” Id. Also,\nechoing the Supreme Court’s concerns, we went on to state:\n\n    Had ONRC’s notice specified its other theories,\n    either Oregon or the EPA might well have decided\n    that those theories had sufficient merit to call for\n    agency action. Were we to exercise jurisdiction over\n    such claims when they were not disclosed by the cit-\n    izen suit notice, we would usurp the right of the\n    applicable governmental agencies to evaluate and act\n    upon the merits of the claims prior to judicial review.\n\nId. at 1144.\n\n   Earlier on, when faced with a notice that did not list all of\nthe complaining parties, we declared that for purposes of an\naction by those not listed, the notice was fatally insufficient.\nWash.

By the way, the\nnotice in that case also had a deficiency regarding dates, but\nwe did not address that. See id. at 1352.\n\n   In short, the requirements set forth in 40 C.F.R. § 135.3(a)\nare not to be looked upon as mere technicalities to be\naccepted with cold reserve and embraced with velleity. They\nare to be taken seriously as a means of carrying out important\npublic policies. Our deviations from their precise language\nhave been minor.\n\f9934 CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT\n   [5] When those authorities and their principles are used as\na yardstick, it is apparent that the notices in this case were not\nsufficient to support district court jurisdiction. An analysis of\nthe notices will explain why that is so. The first of the notices\non June 30, 2003, declared that “Section 404 of the CWA”9\nwas being violated by activities that began June 17, 2003,\nwhich activities were placing “enormous amounts of fill” into\nthe lake and were accompanied by grading below the ordinary\nhigh water mark. The notice did not mention any claims under\n§ 402 of the CWA,10 nor did it give any detail whatsoever\nregarding just what “wetlands” were allegedly being affected\nor how.11 It also gave no other specific dates. The second of\nthe notices, dated July 17, 2003, is of the same ilk. It gives lit-\ntle more detail about the activities regarding the lake itself and\nno more detail regarding wetlands or § 402. Those notices are\nquestionable regarding § 404 violations and insufficient\nregarding wetlands and any claimed § 402 violations.12\n\n   [6] What is of even more significance, however, is that long\nbefore any action was filed and, in fact, before 60 days had\ngone by, the Corps issued its cease and desist order on July\n23, 2003, and all activity by Marina Point regarding the lake\nstopped as it had to. That, in fact, is reflected in the Center’s\nthird notice, on August 8, 2003, wherein it stated that the\nactivities it complained of occurred each day from June 17,\n2003, through July 25, 2003.\n  9\n    33 U.S.C. § 1344.\n  10\n      33 U.S.C. § 1342.\n   11\n      That is especially problematic here because it is doubtful that Marina\nPoint’s own land was itself wetlands at all. See, e.g., 33 C.F.R. § 330.3;\nUnited States v. S. Inv. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524327\"><a href=\"/opinion/524327/united-states-v-southern-investment-company-southern-investment-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 613 (8th Cir. 1989). The Corps\ndid not (and does not) think so. Marina Point could hardly have guessed\nat what the Center was speaking about.\n   12\n      It is interesting to note that even in its complaint and in the ultimate\npretrial conference order in this action in the district court, there is no\nmention of a § 402 claim.\n\f     CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT 9935\n   The third notice then goes on to claim violations in lan-\nguage even less descriptive than that used in the prior notices.\nIt refers only to piles of material that were causing discharges\nbelow the ordinary high water mark of the lake, and declares\nthat the situation could be made worse should it rain. As we\nsee it, that level of generality, again, is not really compatible\nwith the purposes of the notice requirements under the CWA.\n\n   [7] But, even if it were sufficient in that regard, here again\nthe Corps stepped in to obviate and ameliorate any problems.\nJust slightly over 60 days later and before commencement of\nthis action, the Corps issued its October 16, 2003, ICMO\nauthorizing and directing Marina Point to perform and com-\nplete a number of corrective measures by December 1, 2003,\nfor the purpose of protecting the lake from the kinds of prob-\nlems alluded to by the August 8, 2003, notice. It is also nota-\nble that although the Corps’ ICMO was issued nine days after\nthe 60 days had expired, Marina Point had applied for permis-\nsion to undertake that work on September 25, 2003, which\nwas before the 60 days had run. Of course, Marina Point\ncould not have been expected to actually begin correcting per-\nceived § 404 problems regarding the lake without obtaining\npermission from the Corps. In short, as weak as it was, the\nnotice had done its job, if, indeed, the job was not being done\nwithout the notice.\n\n   That leaves the December 1, 2003, notice, which is, if any-\nthing, even less informative and helpful than the earlier\nnotices. Principally, it asserts that Marina Point was going\nforward without the coverage of the ICMO because that docu-\nment said that work was to cease by December 1, 2003. How-\never, the Center was in error because, due to problems that\nhad developed, the Corps, after consultation with FWS,\nextended the date to December 24, 2003. As it was, the work\nceased by December 17, 2003. It is difficult to see what\nMarina Point was supposed to do about that portion of the\nnotice. Probably nothing. See Columbia Plywood, 286 F.3d at\n1143. Beyond that, the Center indicated that it could not really\n\f9936 CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT\ntell if the work was proceeding pursuant to the terms of the\nICMO. That, too, was hardly the kind of notice that the CWA\ncontemplates.\n\n   [8] In fine, the notices were insufficient at their inception\nregarding wetlands and possible § 402 violations, and to the\nextent that they were sufficient, if barely so, as to possible\n§ 404 violations, their efficiency was limited by prompt Corps\nand Marina Point action. That is to say, in light of the defects\nin the notices, and in light of the fact that the Corps and\nMarina Point did act to cease the activities that the Center\nclaimed were wrongful and even acted to effect ongoing\nrepairs for any problems caused by past activities, the district\ncourt did not have jurisdiction to hear the CWA action. It\nshould have dismissed the action at the outset. Thus, in this\nrespect the district court’s judgment must fall for lack of juris-\ndiction, and must be vacated.\n\n  II.   Endangered Species Act\n\n   Plaintiffs were also required to give notice before bringing\nan action under the ESA. See 16 U.S.C. § 1540(g)(2). There\nis no claim that the notice was not sufficient in that respect,\nand it does appear to be proper. However, there is a different\nproblem here — mootness.\n\n   [9] The ESA allows a citizen suit for the purpose of obtain-\ning injunctive relief only. Id. at (g)(1)(A). Of course, that is\nforward looking, and is intended to prevent a defendant from\ntaking an endangered or threatened species. See id.\n§ 1538(a)(1)(B); 50 C.F.R. §17.31. That means that a person\nmay not harass or harm a listed species. See 16 U.S.C.\n§ 1532(19). Here, the claim was that Marina Point’s activities\nand planned project would harass bald eagles by disrupting\ntheir “normal behavioral patterns.” See 50 C.F.R. § 17.3.\n\n  [10] The problem is that less than a year after the district\n\f        CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL v. MARINA POINT DEVELOPMENT 9937\ncourt’s judgment was issued13 and, of course, while this case\nwas still on appeal, the FWS delisted the bald eagle.14 There-\nfore, whatever might have been the case previously, Marina\nPoint cannot violate the ESA regarding the bald eagle, regard-\nless of any decision we render here.\n\n   [11] As we explained in Council of Ins. Agents & Brokers\nv. Molasky-Arman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1238943\"><a href=\"/opinion/1238943/council-of-ins-agents-brokers-v-molasky-arman/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">925</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 933 (9th Cir. 2008) (cita-\ntions omitted):\n\n          “To qualify as a case fit for federal-court adjudica-\n       tion, an actual controversy must be extant at all\n       stages of review, not merely at the time the com-\n       plaint is filed.” “A claim is moot when the issues\n       presented are no longer live or the parties lack a\n       legally cognizable interest in the outcome. The basic\n       question is whether there exists a present contro-\n       versy as to which effective relief can be granted.”\n\nBecause the bald eagle has been delisted, no present contro-\nversy can remain.\n\n   In Humane Society of the United States v. Kempthorne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187194\"><a href=\"/opinion/187194/humane-soc-of-us-v-dirk-kempthorne/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 2008), the Court of Appeals for the Dis-\ntrict of Columbia Circuit was faced with a similar situation.\nIn that case, while litigation regarding protection for the gray\nwolf was on appeal, the wolf was removed from the endan-\ngered species list. Id. at 182. That being so, the parties agreed\nthat the case had necessarily become moot, and the court\naccepted that agreement. Id. The specific reason for that was\nnot explicated but, no doubt, it appeared obvious to all con-\ncerned that there was no further work to be served by an\ninjunction. Cf. Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Norton, 254\n  13\n   The judgment was entered August 21, 2006.\n  14\n   See Endangered & Threatened Wildlife & Plants; Removing the Bald\nEagle in the Lower 48 States From the List of Endangered & Threatened\nWildlife, 72 Fed.

Now that the bald eagle has been\ndelisted, nothing we decide can properly give the Center the\nrelief it sought. If the district court erred, the injunction must\nfall, but if the district court was correct, the injunction must\nstill fall because no activities by Marina Point could constitute\na take within the meaning of the ESA. In fact, in a letter to\nthis court, the Center has conceded mootness.\n\n   [12] Thus, there is no further jurisdiction to proceed, and\nthe district court’s judgment under the ESA must be vacated.\n\n                       OTHER ISSUES\n\n  I.   Attorney Fees\n\n   The district court awarded attorney fees to the Center and\nagainst Marina Point on both the CWA and the ESA claims.\nIt did not segregate the two. Nevertheless, because, as more\nparticularly set forth below, fees cannot be awarded on either\nclaim, the entire award must fall.\n\n  A.   CWA\n\n   [13] The CWA provides for an award of attorney fees “to\nany prevailing or substantially prevailing party” when the\ncourt deems that to be appropriate. 33 U.S.C. § 1365(d).
