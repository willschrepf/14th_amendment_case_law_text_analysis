Peters (briefed), Assistant United States Attorney,\nBoise, Idaho; and Alexandra Gelber (briefed and argued),\nUnited States Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., for\nthe plaintiff-appellee.\n\n\n                         OPINION\n\nRAWLINSON, Circuit Judge:\n\n   In this appeal, we determine whether Jerry Levis Banks,\nSr.’s (Banks) conviction on multiple counts involving the pos-\nsession, production, transportation and receipt of images\ndepicting minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct should\nbe reversed based on the denial of his motion to suppress evi-\ndence seized pursuant to a warrant, the admission of testimo-\nnial evidence provided by Banks’s wife alleged to be\nprotected by the marital communications privilege, or the dis-\ntrict court’s adoption or the application of definitions for\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS                 2227\n“masturbation” and “lascivious” as they relate to the subject\nvideo. We affirm the conviction. The district court did not err\nwhen it denied Banks’s motion to suppress or in defining and\napplying the terms “masturbation” and “lascivious.” Although\nthe ruling addressing the marital communications privilege\nwas erroneous, the error was harmless.\n\n                               I.\n\n                      BACKGROUND\n\n   This case began when Special Agent Mary Martin (Agent\nMartin) filed an “Application and Affidavit for Search War-\nrant.” According to the affidavit, a Canadian investigation\ninto child pornography had resulted in the arrest of a Cana-\ndian pedophile who admitted to trading child pornography\nwith Banks. The Canadian pedophile also provided evidence\nthat Banks may have created a pornographic video involving\nBanks’s two-year-old grandson.\n\n   A warrant issued to search Banks’s home for sixteen types\nof items described in the affidavit. As a result of the evidence\nseized pursuant to the warrant, Banks was charged with nine\ncriminal counts relating to the possession, production, trans-\nportation and receipt of images depicting minors engaged in\nsexually explicit conduct. Seven of those charges ultimately\nproceeded to trial.\n\n   Prior to trial, Banks moved to suppress the evidence seized\npursuant to the search warrant, asserting that the affidavit\nlacked foundation and specificity. Banks’s arguments were\nrejected by the district court, and a bench trial ensued.\n\n  At trial, the government called Banks’s wife as a witness.\nMrs. Banks primarily testified about her relationship with the\nminor child in the subject video. She testified that the child\nwas her grandson, with whom she had a close relationship.\nMrs. Banks also identified her husband’s ring, watch and\n\f2228                   UNITED STATES v. BANKS\ncouch in the video.1 Mrs. Banks was asked whether her hus-\nband had made any statements regarding a video involving\ntheir grandson. Over Banks’s objection, Mrs. Banks testified\nthat her husband had admitted to making the video and that\nhe had done so to ensure that “nothing went on in changing\nthe diaper because of past things.”\n\n   The district court found Banks guilty on all counts, con-\ncluding that Banks had created the subject video. The court\nrelied on the testimony identifying Banks’s ring, watch and\ncouch, as well as testimony that Banks had admitted changing\nthe child’s diaper. The district court also determined that the\nvideo contained images of sexually explicit conduct. Specifi-\ncally, the court concluded that the video depicted the mastur-\nbation of a minor child under a definition of masturbation that\nincluded the stimulation of genitalia in a manner that would\nstimulate an adult. The district court found that the video also\ncontained a lascivious exhibition of the genitals of the minor\nchild because it depicted the masturbation of the child “for the\npurpose of eliciting in the viewer a sexual response.”\n\n                                    II.\n\n                   STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n   We review de novo the district court’s rulings on a motion\nto suppress and the validity of a search warrant. See United\nStates v. Crews, 502 F.3d 1130, 1135 (9th Cir. 2007).\n\n   We also review de novo legal conclusions regarding the\nmarital communications privilege. See United States v. Grif-\nfin, 440 F.3d 1138, 1143 (9th Cir. 2006). However, we review\nthe admission of evidence for an abuse of discretion. See\n  1\n   This testimony was in addition to that of other witnesses detailing that\nBanks had been left alone with the child, that he had been discovered with\nthe child in the locked garage, and that he had admitted to changing the\nchild’s diaper.\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS                   2229\nUnited States v. Marashi, 913 F.2d 724, 729 (9th Cir. 1990).\n“A district court abuses its discretion if it ‘bases its ruling on\nan erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assess-\nment of the evidence.’ ” Shafer v. Astrue, 518 F.3d 1067,\n1070 (9th Cir. 2008) (citation and alteration omitted).\n\n   Finally, we review de novo the district court’s “construc-\ntion or interpretation of a statute,” United States v. Carranza,\n289 F.3d 634, 642 (9th Cir. 2002) (citation omitted), and\nreview for clear error the court’s findings of fact. See United\nStates v. Leos-Maldonado, 302 F.3d 1061, 1063 (9th Cir.\n2002).\n\n                               III.\n\n                         DISCUSSION\n\n  A. The affidavit contained an adequate foundation to sup-\n  port issuance of the search warrant.\n\n   [1] Statements in an affidavit supporting a search warrant\napplication directed toward “the behavior of a particular class\nof persons” must be supported by “a foundation which shows\nthat the person subject to the search is a member of the class.”\nUnited States v. Weber, 923 F.2d 1338, 1345 (9th Cir. 1991),\nas amended. In the present case, there was ample information\nin the affidavit to support the notion that Banks was engaging\nin the production and trade of images depicting minors\nengaged in sexually explicit conduct, including evidence of\nthe transmission of such images between Banks and a con-\nvicted sex offender in Canada. Thus, to the extent Banks\nargues that the affidavit failed to set forth the proper founda-\ntion for later assumptions about pedophiles, the requirements\nof Weber were met.\n\n  Further, to the extent that Banks argues that the contested\nsections of the affidavit were required to be supported by\nexpert opinion, he is incorrect. The contested sections pro-\n\f2230                UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nvided background information about how pedophiles act in\nthe digital age, how law enforcement generally conducts\nsearches of computers, and what likely steps would be taken\nto search a computer. None of these topics is so esoteric as to\nrequire expert explanation to be understood. Additionally, at\nthe outset of the affidavit, Agent Martin explained that she\nhas been investigating the sexual exploitation of children\nsince 1998 and has attended training seminars and classes “re-\nlated to conducting these types of investigations.” Her exten-\nsive background was sufficient to support the generalized\nstatements provided in the first three sections of the affidavit.\n\n   Finally, to the extent Banks argues that Agent Martin’s fail-\nure to specifically include the source of her information in\neach section renders the affidavit insufficient to create proba-\nble cause, the argument fails because Banks is unable to dem-\nonstrate that any omission was material or that, “when\nsupplemented with the omitted information, [the affidavit]\nwould be insufficient to support a probable cause finding.”\nUnited States v. Jawara, 474 F.3d 565, 582 (9th Cir. 2007),\nas amended (citation omitted).\n\n  B.   The warrant was sufficiently specific.\n\n   “Specificity has two aspects: particularity and breadth. Par-\nticularity is the requirement that the warrant must clearly state\nwhat is sought. Breadth deals with the requirement that the\nscope of the warrant be limited by the probable cause on\nwhich the warrant is based.” United States v. Hill, 459 F.3d\n966, 973 (9th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted).\n\n   [2] “The prohibition of general searches is not . . . a\ndemand for precise ex ante knowledge of the location and\ncontent of evidence . . . The proper metric of sufficient speci-\nficity is whether it was reasonable to provide a more specific\ndescription of the items at that juncture of the investigation.”\nUnited States v. Meek, 366 F.3d 705, 716 (9th Cir. 2004)\n(citation omitted). The warrant in this matter sought evidence\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS                 2231\nthat Banks was engaged in the production and transmission of\nchild pornography. In doing so, it limited its range to items\ncontaining a connection to “child pornography,” “child eroti-\nca,” or “minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct” as\ndefined by statute. This description was sufficiently particular\nto overcome Banks’s argument that the items to be seized\nwere not specifically identified. Id.\n\n   Banks’s contention that the warrant’s lack of a time frame\nrendered it insufficiently particular is unpersuasive because\nthe record and affidavit do not demonstrate knowledge on the\npart of the government that the illegal conduct was limited to\nany particular time frame. Cf. United States v. Kow, 58 F.3d\n423, 427 (9th Cir. 1995) (invalidating a warrant where the\naffidavit indicated that the criminal activity began at a spe-\ncific time period but the warrant was not limited to a particu-\nlar time frame).\n\n   Banks’s final suggestion that the warrant was insufficiently\nparticular because it did not specifically seek to recover the\nvideos known to have been transmitted and because it failed\nto identify the name of the internet chat room that Banks\nmoderated also fails. Although the government may have\nknown the name of certain files that supported the finding of\nprobable cause, there is no requirement that the warrant be\ntailored to obtain only that evidence already known to exist.\nIn fact, this heightened limitation has been specifically\nrejected. See Meek, 366 F.3d at 716.\n\n   Banks also challenges the breadth of the warrant, asserting\nthat the items seized could have been described more specifi-\ncally and that the warrant should have excluded a search of\nBanks’s home-based business.\n\n   The affidavit submitted in support of the warrant in this\ncase explained that “computer storage devices . . . can store\nthe equivalent of thousands of pages of information.” It also\nnoted that a user wanting to conceal evidence “often stores it\n\f2232                UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nin random order with deceptive file names.” The affidavit\nthen noted that searching computers “for criminal evidence is\na highly technical process requiring expert skill and a prop-\nerly controlled environment.” Finally, the affidavit provided\nevidence that computers at the Banks’s residence had been\nused to obtain and transfer child pornography.\n\n   [3] “[N]o more specific description of the computer equip-\nment sought was possible,” United States v. Hay, 231 F.3d\n630, 637 (9th Cir. 2000) (citation and footnote reference omit-\nted), because there was no way to know where the offending\nimages had been stored. “Further, the affidavit explained why\nit was necessary to seize the entire computer system in order\nto examine the electronic data for contraband,” id., and the\n“warrant did not authorize[ ] seizure of every document, but\nof child pornography which is a sufficiently specific defini-\ntion to focus the search.” Id. at 638 (footnote reference omit-\nted).\n\n   “A generalized seizure of business documents may be justi-\nfied” if it is demonstrated that “the government could not rea-\nsonably segregate . . . documents on the basis of whether or\nnot they were likely to evidence criminal activity.” Kow, 58\nF.3d at 427, 428 (citations omitted). A full reading of the affi-\ndavit in this matter reveals that no more limited search would\nhave been feasible, even if the evidence of Banks’s home\nbusiness had been more fully set forth. As in Meek, “the war-\nrant here did not authorize ‘the seizure of virtually every doc-\nument and computer file’ without indicating how items were\nrelated to the suspected crime.” 366 F.3d at 715 (citation\nomitted) (distinguishing Kow). Rather, the warrant sought\nonly evidence of child pornography and appropriately limited\nits search and seizure provisions to attain this objective. See\nid. at 715-16.\n\n [4] Thus, the district court did not err in denying Banks’s\nmotion to suppress.\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS                  2233\n  C. Although the district court erred in applying the\n  marital communications privilege, the error was harmless.\n\n   Over Banks’s objection that the testimony was protected by\nthe marital communications privilege, the district court\nallowed Banks’s wife to testify to statements made by Banks\nduring the course of their marriage concerning why Banks\ncreated the video.\n\n   [5] The marital communications privilege “protects from\ndisclosure private communications between spouses,” Griffin,\n440 F.3d at 1143-44 (citations omitted), and may be invoked\nby the non-testifying spouse. Marashi, 913 F.2d at 729. The\nprivilege exists “to protect the integrity of marriages and\nensure that spouses freely communicate with one another.”\nGriffin, 440 F.3d at 1143 (citation, alterations and internal\nquotation marks omitted). However, because the marital com-\nmunications privilege “obstructs the truth seeking process,”\nits use “in criminal proceedings requires a particularly narrow\nconstruction because of society’s strong interest in the admin-\nistration of justice.” United States v. White, 974 F.2d 1135,\n1138 (9th Cir. 1992) (citation omitted).\n\n   [6] While balancing the public’s interest in the full and fair\nadministration of justice and the need to protect the integrity\nof marriage and ensure that spouses freely communicate, we\nhave created two exceptions to the privilege. First, “the mari-\ntal communications privilege does not apply to statements\nmade in furtherance of joint criminal activity.” Marashi, 913\nF.2d at 731. Second, “the marital communications privilege\nshould not apply to statements relating to a crime where a\nspouse or a spouse’s children are the victims.” White, 974\nF.2d at 1138. It is the extent of this second exception that we\nnow consider.\n\n  In White, we agreed with the balancing test set forth by the\nEighth Circuit in United States v. Allery, 526 F.2d 1362,\n1366-67 (8th Cir. 1975), which concluded that an exception\n\f2234                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nto the marital privilege was needed to protect the children of\neither spouse from abuse by the other spouse. Id. at 1367. The\ndistrict court’s ruling in this case demonstrates its belief that\nthe White exception should extend to those individuals con-\nsidered the functional equivalent of the children protected in\nWhite.\n\n   In determining whether the functional equivalent of a child/\nparent relationship should support an exception to the marital\ncommunications privilege, the rationale of Allery is instruc-\ntive. In Allery, the court extended the exception to allow testi-\nmony when a crime has been committed against the child of\neither spouse, recognizing that “in light of today’s society,”\nthe policy behind the privilege requires expansion of its\nexceptions. 526 F.2d at 1366. The court noted “that a serious\ncrime against a child is an offense against that family[’s] har-\nmony and to society as well.” Id. The court also discussed that\na vast majority of child abuse cases involve “a parent or par-\nent substitute” as the perpetrator. Id.\n\n   [7] Given that the bond between marital partners and the\nfunctional equivalent of their children would be nearly identi-\ncal to that between marital partners and their birth or step-\nchildren, the harm to family harmony and society would be\nthe equivalent of that noted in Allery. See id. Indeed, of the\nnine states within the Ninth Circuit, seven recognize a marital\ncommunications privilege exception including the functional\nequivalent of birth children or a somewhat broader concept.2\n  2\n    The states with such an exception are Alaska (Daniels v. State, 681\nP.2d 341, 345 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984) (covering foster children as well as\nbirth and adopted children)); Arizona (Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 13-4062\n& 13-604) (waiving the privilege for several serious offenses including\n“[a]ny dangerous crime against children” and “[s]exual conduct with a\nminor under fifteen years of age”); California (Dunn v. Superior Court, 21\nCal.App.4th 721, 723-24 (1993) (recognizing that the exception applies to\nadult step-children as well as all foster children)); Hawaii (Haw. Rev. Stat.\n§ 626-1, Rule 505(c)) (excepting from the privilege crimes committed\nagainst “a third person residing in the household of either [spouse]”);\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. BANKS                        2235\nConsidering the comparable familial ties, we conclude that\nviolence against the functional equivalent of a child should be\nafforded the same protections as violence against the birth or\nstep-child of a married couple.3\n\n  The question remains, however, whether the district court\ncorrectly concluded that the minor child in this case was the\nfunctional equivalent of a birth or step-child. The district\ncourt’s conclusion was based on the following findings:\n\n        that JB, the alleged victim, was the grandchild of\n     both the witness, Mrs. Banks, and the defendant, Mr.\n     Banks; that the witness and the defendant were mar-\n     ried and co-habitating at the time of the communica-\n     tion; that JB was in the care, joint care of Mrs. Banks\n     and the defendant at the time of the alleged molesta-\n     tion; that JB was specifically being cared for by the\n     defendant at the time of the alleged molestation; that\n     at least during the two-month period prior to the\n     alleged molestation that JB had been left in the joint\n\nIdaho (Idaho Code Ann. § 9-203(1)) (precluding use of the privilege in\n“any case of physical injury to a child where the injury has been caused\nas a result of physical abuse or neglect by one or both of the parents” and\n“any case of lewd and lascivious conduct or attempted lewd and lascivious\nconduct where either party would otherwise be protected by this privi-\nlege”); Nevada (Nev. Rev. Stat. § 49.295(2)(e)(1)) (excluding crimes com-\nmitted against “a child in the custody or control of either” spouse); and\nWashington (Wash. Rev. Code § 5.60.060(1)) (precluding use of the privi-\nlege in a “proceeding for a crime committed by said spouse or domestic\npartner against any child of whom said spouse or domestic partner is the\nparent or guardian”).\n   3\n     We decline to follow the path taken in United States v. Bahe, 128 F.3d\n1440, 1446 (10th Cir. 1997), extending the exception to testimony relating\nto the abuse of any minor child in the marital household, whether residing\nthere or visiting. No other circuit has adopted such a broad exemption to\nthe federal marital communications privilege. In fact, such an exception\nwould be broader than that adopted by the majority of states within the\nNinth Circuit.\n\f2236                UNITED STATES v. BANKS\n    care of the defendant and Mrs. Banks for two week-\n    ends beginning on Friday evening and ending Satur-\n    day afternoon; that the parents, i.e., Mr. and Mrs.\n    Banks’ son and their daughter-in-law, were not pres-\n    ent during those times when JB was in the care of\n    the defendant and his wife.\n\n       Further, during the approximate two years of JB’s\n    life preceding that time, for the first six months he\n    had lived with Mr. and Mrs. Banks. And during that\n    time, the parents also lived with Mr. and Mrs. Banks,\n    but Mrs. Banks on occasion would feed, bathe,\n    clothe, and change the diapers of JB on many occa-\n    sions. After that three-month — or after that six-\n    month period, the times in which JB was in Mr. and\n    Mrs. Banks’s care was very infrequent until April of\n    2005. But the parents started leaving JB in the care\n    of Mr. and Mrs. Banks from the time he was about\n    one and one half years old but not usually overnight\n    until April of 2005.\n\n   [8] Although these facts demonstrate a strong bond\nbetween the victim and his grandparents, they do not show the\ntype of relationship that would be considered the functional\nequivalent of a birth or step-child’s relationship with his par-\nents. Infrequent overnight visits are common to a large por-\ntion of grandparent/grandchild relationships, as are frequent\nvisits with or even regular day-care services provided by the\ngrandparents. This type of care, while admirable and impor-\ntant, does not carry the same indicia of guardianship and\nresponsibility that a parent/child relationship carries. Further,\nwhile the district court noted that JB had resided with the\nBanks for the first six months of his life, it is an important\nqualifier that his parents had also resided in the home and that\nthis living situation had ended well over a year before the\nalleged molestation.\n\n  [9] This is not a case in which a child was raised by grand-\nparents and, therefore, could be said to share a parent/child\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS                  2237\nrelationship with those caretakers. Rather, this situation dem-\nonstrates a strong grandparent/grandchild relationship.\nAlthough such a relationship is important to building strong\nextended families and improving society, it is not the type that\ncreates the same overriding policy concerns that led us to\nlimit the marital communications privilege to protect children\nof the marriage.\n\n   [10] Accordingly, the district court’s admission of Mrs.\nBanks’s testimony was an abuse of discretion because the dis-\ntrict court’s finding that JB was the functional equivalent of\na birth child to Banks and his wife was clearly erroneous\nunder these facts. See Shafer, 518 F.3d at 1070 (“A district\ncourt abuses its discretion if it ‘bases its ruling on an errone-\nous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of\nthe evidence.’ ” (citation and alteration omitted)).\n\n   Our dissenting colleague accuses the majority of “neglect[-\ning] its duty pursuant to Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evi-\ndence . . .” Dissenting Opinion, p. 2246. To the contrary, it\nis the dissenting opinion that strays from the dictates of Rule\n501 by incorporating wholesale state law statutory privileges\ninto its analysis.\n\n   Rule 501 provides in pertinent part: “[T]he privilege of a\nwitness . . . shall be governed by the principles of the com-\nmon law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the\nUnited States . . .” Fed. R. of Evid. 501 (emphasis added). In\nkeeping with Rule 501’s emphasis on federal common law,\nthe court in Allery recognized that “[f]ederal courts may . . .\nlook to the privileges created by state courts and applicable\nstate statutes if the court finds them appropriate.” Allery, 526\nF.2d at 1365 (emphases added). No deference to state law is\nmentioned or implied.\n\n   More importantly, the court in Allery noted that proposed\nrules of privilege “adopted by the United States Supreme\nCourt and sent to Congress for approval . . . [were] abandoned\n\f2238                UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nby Congress and [were] replaced by Rule 501.” Id. at 1366\n(footnote reference omitted).\n\n   In Allery, the court explained that “[a] careful review of the\nlegislative history behind the rejection of the changes pro-\nposed in Article V and the passage of Rule 501 does not indi-\ncate that Congress disapproved of the expansion of this\nexception but rather that any substantive changes should be\ndone on a case-by-case basis.” Id. (citation omitted).\n\n  Rather than resolving this case on these facts, the dissent\nseeks to make a sweeping ruling that the marital privilege is\nwaived for all grandparents for all time for all circumstances,\nwhenever a charge of sexual abuse of a minor is involved.\nAlthough the majority recognizes the abhorrent nature of\nchild sexual abuse, we must nevertheless faithfully apply our\nprecedent.\n\n   Our governing precedent on this issue is our opinion in\nWhite, which cited Allery with approval. See White, 974 F.2d\nat 1138. In White, we concluded that the common law “mari-\ntal communications privilege should not apply to statements\nrelating to a crime where a spouse or spouse’s children are the\nvictims.”\n\n   The dissent seeks to extend this holding virtually without\nlimitation. See Dissenting Opinion, p. 2256-57. In doing so,\nthe dissent goes far beyond the approach taken by the district\ncourt. It is apparent from the district court’s factual findings\nthat its ruling was predicated upon a determination that the\ngrandparents in this case were the functional equivalents of\nparents. Indeed, the district court expressly reasoned that this\ncase was “not even a small step from what the court ruled in\nWhite. It is almost exactly the same.” In this particular case,\nunder these particular facts, we disagree. Perhaps our holding\nwould be different if the grandparents were the primary care-\ngivers. But such was not the case. Rather, the grandparents\nwere occasional caregivers. As discussed above, and as Rule\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. BANKS                          2239\n501 contemplates, a case-by-case application of the marital\ncommunications privilege as interpreted by our court, leads\nthe majority to conclude that the exception did not apply in\nthis case.4\n\n   [11] Nevertheless, evidence improperly admitted under the\nmarital communications privilege warrants reversal only if it\naffected the defendant’s substantial rights. Marashi, 913 F.2d\nat 729. The error here was harmless as it related to the issue\nof Banks’s identity. In fact, the district court’s finding that\nBanks created the video made no mention of Banks’s confes-\nsion to his wife. Rather, the court focused on the multitude of\nevidence supporting the conclusion that Banks made the\nvideo. This evidence included the recognition of Banks’s\nwatch and ring on the adult in the video; the recognition of a\ncouch in the video that was owned by Banks and kept in his\ngarage; testimony that Banks had been found in his locked\ngarage, alone with the victim, and had admitted to changing\nthe child’s diaper; and testimony that Banks had been left\nalone with the child. This evidence demonstrated beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the video was made in Banks’s garage\nand that Banks had been involved in the making of the video.\nWe are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the district\ncourt would have found that Banks made the video, even\nwithout the improperly admitted statement.\n\n  Any error was also harmless as it related to the district\ncourt’s finding that the video constituted sexually explicit\nconduct. Although the district court did discuss the competing\n  4\n    The dissent quotes at length from the district court’s reasoning to sup-\nport the argument that the marital privilege exception should be expanded.\nDissenting Opinion, pp. 2270-72. It is notable that the portions quoted by\nthe dissent anchor the district court’s reasoning to our precedent, White,\nrather than to Idaho law or any other state statutory or case authority.\nAlthough the district court referenced state law generally, it did not seek\nto incorporate state law into its analysis, and rightfully so. See Allery, 526\nF.2d at 1366 (cautioning against expansion of the marital privileges excep-\ntion on any basis other than “case-by-case.”).\n\f2240                 UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nmotives for making the video that were adduced at trial, the\nfinding that the video constituted sexually explicit conduct\nwas based on the actions taken in the video and Banks’s later\ntransmission of that video to a known pedophile with com-\nments suggesting that the video was intended to show the\nchild’s erection. See United States v. Freeman, 498 F.3d 893,\n901 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding error harmless when “it is more\nprobable than not that the error did not materially affect the\nverdict”) (citation omitted).\n\n   Banks argues that admission of the testimony constituted\nreversible error because he was required to change his trial\nstrategy to explain his prior criminal history. However, there\nis no indication in the record that the district court relied at all\non Banks’s prior criminal history in reaching its guilty ver-\ndict, rendering any error harmless. See id.\n\n   [12] In sum, although the district court abused its discretion\nin admitting the contested testimony, such error was harmless\nand does not warrant reversal.\n\n  D.   The district court’s definition and finding of\n       masturbation were not erroneous.\n\n   The district court conscientiously crafted a definition of\nmasturbation. It first noted the fact that no statutory definition\nexists, before recounting a dictionary definition of masturba-\ntion that included the exciting of another’s genitals by manual\ncontact. Rejecting the government’s assertion that masturba-\ntion may be found if the act were done solely “for the purpose\nof exciting the person performing the act,” the court con-\ncluded that the act must be “for the purpose of exciting the\nperson being masturbated.”\n\n   The court next turned to the problem that this definition\ncreated when it came to the masturbation of a minor child\nwho might not be able to be stimulated by the action. The dis-\ntrict court concluded that Congress intended masturbation to\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. BANKS                 2241\ninclude “the stimulation, manipulation, or excitation of the\ngenital organs for purposes of exciting or stimulating the per-\nson being masturbated if that person was an adult.”\n\n   Banks argues that this definition impermissibly conflicts\nwith the district court’s later definition of lasciviousness\nbecause it considers the intent of the individual masturbating\nthe minor child while the definition of lascivious considers\nthe response intended in the person viewing the image. As\ndiscussed below, the definition of masturbation provided by\nthe district court does not impermissibly contradict that given\nfor lasciviousness. The catch-all nature of the term lascivious\nallows for the recognition that certain acts, because of their\ninherent sexual nature, can satisfy both lasciviousness and\nanother more specific sexual act.\n\n    In interpreting a statute, we “must begin with the language\nof the statute itself.” Bowsher v. Merck & Co., 460 U.S. 824,\n830 (1983) (citation omitted). As the district court aptly\nnoted, neither the statute nor interpretive case law provides a\ndefinition of masturbation. “[I]n the absence of a statutory\ndefinition, a term should be accorded its ordinary meaning\n. . .” Sherman v. U.S. Parole Comm’n, 502 F.3d 869, 874 (9th\nCir. 2007) (citation omitted). Definitions should be adopted\nthat “give effect, if possible, to every word of the statute,”\nBowsher, 460 U.S. at 833 (citation omitted), and dictionary\ndefinitions are cognizable. See United States v. Santos, ___\nU.S. ___, 128 S. Ct. 2020, 2024 (2008) (utilizing dictionary\ndefinitions).\n\n   The Oxford English Dictionary defines masturbation as\n“deliberate erotic self-stimulation” and provides an accompa-\nnying definition of mutual masturbation as the “stimulation of\nthe genitals of one person by another in order to produce an\norgasm without sexual intercourse.” 9 Oxford English Dictio-\nnary 454 (2d ed. 1989). Webster’s Third New International\nDictionary similarly defines masturbation as “erotic stimula-\ntion involving the genital organs commonly resulting in\n\f2242               UNITED STATES v. BANKS\norgasm and achieved by manual or other bodily contact exclu-\nsive of sexual intercourse . . .” Webster’s Third New Interna-\ntional Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 1391\n(1986).\n\n   Each definition focuses primarily on the “erotic” stimula-\ntion of one’s genitals. Despite noting that an orgasm is com-\nmonly reached or intended, neither definition requires that an\norgasm occur or even be possible. The district court’s defini-\ntion recognizes this aspect of masturbation in the difficult\ncontext of contact with a child too young to have a sexual\nresponse to the physical contact.\n\n   The subject video depicts the minor child having his diaper\nchanged. Using a diaper wipe, Banks touched, rubbed and\nheld the child’s penis. Banks also massaged the child’s scro-\ntum and anus, and the time spent wiping the child’s anus\nappears prolonged. These actions were taken at a point in the\ndiaper-changing where it could reasonably be concluded that\nthey were extraneous. Indeed, after the cleaning process\nappeared complete, Banks exited the screen and returned two\nmore times with new wipes and continued touching the child.\nIn addition, messages between Banks and the Canadian\npedophile demonstrated that Banks represented the video as\ndepicting the child’s erection.\n\n   [13] This evidence supports the district court’s conclusion\nthat the minor child’s genitals were stimulated for the purpose\nof producing a video for Banks to share with his fellow\npedophile in Canada. Such an action would fit the definition\nof masturbation described above. Accordingly, the district\ncourt did not clearly err in concluding that the video depicts\nmasturbation and, ultimately, sexually explicit conduct. See\nLeos-Maldonado, 302 F.3d at 1063 (reviewing the district\ncourt’s findings of fact for clear error).\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. BANKS                       2243\n  E.     The district court’s definition and             finding      of\n         lasciviousness were not erroneous.\n\n   The district court did not provide an explicit definition of\nlascivious when discussing whether the video constituted las-\ncivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of the minor\nchild. However, the court did note the following:\n\n           An additional factor that I think could be added to\n       the Dost factors would be the fondling of a child.\n       And fondling is broader than masturbation. If the\n       government has proved masturbation, in my view it\n       has also proved the fondling of the child. And it was\n       for the purpose of eliciting in the viewer a sexual\n       response. And so the court finds that this image also\n       . . . constitutes a lascivious exhibition of the genitals\n       or pubic area of the child. . . . [I]t was created for the\n       purpose of exciting Mr. Lindstrom and for the pur-\n       pose of appealing to his prurient pedophilia [sic]\n       interests.\n\n  Banks attacks this reasoning, complaining that the district\ncourt improperly folded the definition of masturbation into the\ndefinition of lasciviousness.\n\n   In the context of images involving children, the term “las-\ncivious” has been fairly well defined. A lascivious exhibition\nis pornographic, even if not obscene, and is considered in the\ncontext of “the depictions . . . imposed . . . by the attitude of\nthe viewer or photographer.” United States v. Arvin, 900 F.2d\n1385, 1391 (9th Cir. 1990). Accordingly, “applied to the con-\nduct of children, lasciviousness is not a characteristic of the\nchild photographed but of the exhibition which the photogra-\npher sets up for an audience that consists of himself or\nlikeminded pedophiles.” United States v. Wiegand, 812 F.2d\n1239, 1244 (9th Cir. 1987). This focus results in a definition\nof lascivious that criminalizes images “so presented by the\n\f2244                       UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nphotographer as to arouse or satisfy the sexual cravings of a\nvoyeur.” Hill, 459 F.3d at 972 (citation omitted).\n\n   The district court’s definition did not run afoul of this rec-\nognized definition of lascivious. The court’s definition of\nmasturbation required a finding that the contact with the\nminor’s genitalia was of the type that would produce a sexual\nresponse in an adult. The court’s discussion of lascivious dis-\nplayed an awareness by the court that there must be an intent\non the part of the photographer or viewer to satisfy a sexual\ndesire through the image. Although the distinction between\nthe terms is subtle, it nevertheless exists: masturbation\nfocuses on the effect on the victim and lasciviousness focuses\non the effect on the pedophile.\n\n   [14] The district court’s factual determination that the video\nencompassed the lascivious exhibition of the minor child’s\ngenitals was predicated on the court’s conclusion that the\nvideo depicted the masturbation of the minor child. Banks\ncounters that the video’s display of a diaper change and its\nfailure to meet many of the factors articulated in United States\nv. Dost, 636 F. Supp. 828 (S.D. Cal. 1986),5 preclude a factual\nfinding that the video contains a lascivious exhibition of the\nminor child’s genitals. However, the Dost factors “are neither\nexclusive nor conclusive” because “a determination of lascivi-\nousness has to be made based on the overall content of the\nvisual depiction.” Hill, 459 F.3d at 972 (citation, alteration\nand internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the dis-\n  5\n    The Dost factors are six considerations that judges may use as “a start-\ning point . . . in determining whether a particular image is likely [to be las-\ncivious].” Hill, 459 F.3d at 972. The six factors are “(1) whether the focal\npoint . . . is on the child’s genitalia . . . ; (2) whether the setting . . . is sexu-\nally suggestive . . . ; (3) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose,\nor in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child; (4) whether the\nchild is fully or partially clothed, or nude; (5) whether the visual depiction\nsuggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity;\n[and] (6) whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a\nsexual response in the viewer.” Id. at 971 (citations omitted).\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS                   2245\ntrict court’s failure to consider the factors explicitly, or to\ncomment on the diaper-change setting of the video, is not dis-\npositive. Rather, because the district court did not err in deter-\nmining that the video depicted the masturbation of a minor\nchild and because the recording of such an act constitutes the\nlascivious exhibition of the child’s genitals, the court did not\nerr in concluding that the video contains a lascivious exhibi-\ntion of a minor child’s genitals.\n\n                               IV.\n\n             SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\n   Despite Banks’s objections, we hold that the search warrant\nissued in this case was adequately supported and sufficiently\nspecific. Further, although the district court erred by overex-\ntending the exceptions to the marital communications privi-\nlege, the error was harmless in this case. Finally, the district\ncourt’s definitions and findings regarding the terms “mastur-\nbation” and “lascivious” appropriately captured the require-\nments for each term as they related to the charges brought and\ndid not impermissibly conflict with each other. Accordingly,\nwe conclude that reversal of Banks’s conviction is not war-\nranted and affirm his conviction.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nALARCÓN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\nin part:\n\n   I concur in the majority’s conclusion that the district court\ndid not err in denying Banks’s motion to suppress the evi-\ndence seized pursuant to a search warrant, and in defining and\napplying the terms “masturbation” and “lascivious.” I respect-\nfully dissent from the majority’s holding that the district court\nabused its discretion in admitting the testimony of Banks’s\n\f2246                     UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nspouse that he told her he produced a video for distribution on\nthe internet to other pedophiles that depicts him masturbating\ntheir two-year-old grandchild. I would affirm that ruling.\n\n   I am persuaded that the majority has erred in holding that\nthe law of this Circuit precludes us from deciding a question\nit has not previously considered, i.e., whether the marital\ncommunications privilege is applicable to the voluntary testi-\nmony of a spouse concerning the statements of an accused\nthat connect him to the sexual abuse of their grandchild. In so\nholding, the majority has neglected its duty pursuant to Rule\n501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence to decide questions\ninvolving the applicability of the marital communications\nprivilege on a case-by-case basis “in light of reason and experi-\nence.”1 The majority’s remarkable finding that a grandchild is\nnot the “functional equivalent of a birth or step-child,”\n(Majority Opinion at 2235) will surely come as a complete\nsurprise to grandparents.\n\n                                      I\n\n   The majority has determined that “[o]ur governing prece-\ndent” in determining whether the marital communications\nprivilege should apply to an accused’s admission to his\nspouse of committing a crime against their grandchild is\nUnited States v. White, 974 F.2d 1135 (9th Cir. 1992). Major-\n  1\n   Rule 501 reads as follows:\n      Except as otherwise required by the Constitution of the United\n      States or provided by Act of Congress or in rules prescribed by\n      the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority, the privilege\n      of a witness, person, government, State, or political subdivision\n      thereof shall be governed by the principles of the common law\n      as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in\n      the light of reason and experience. However, in civil actions and\n      proceedings, with respect to an element of a claim or defense as\n      to which State law supplies the rule of decision, the privilege of\n      a witness, person, government, State, or political subdivision\n      thereof shall be determined in accordance with State law.\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS                   2247\nity Opinion at 2238. That issue was not before this court in\nWhite. Instead, this court addressed a discrete question in\nWhite, i.e., whether the district court abused its discretion in\nadmitting the testimony of a spouse that the accused had\nthreatened to kill her and her daughter. White, 974 F.2d at\n1137.\n\n In affirming the trial court’s ruling that the spouse’s testi-\nmony was admissible, we reasoned as follows:\n\n    This court has counseled that the marital communi-\n    cations privilege must be narrowly construed\n    because it obstructs the truth seeking process. Use of\n    the privilege in criminal proceedings requires a par-\n    ticularly narrow construction because of society’s\n    strong interest in the administration of justice. The\n    public policy interests in protecting the integrity of\n    marriages and ensuring that spouses freely commu-\n    nicate with one another underlie the marital commu-\n    nications privilege. When balancing these interests\n    we find that threats against spouses and a spouse’s\n    children do not further the purposes of the privilege\n    and that the public interest in the administration of\n    justice outweighs any possible purpose the privilege\n    serves in such a case.\n\nId. at 1138 (quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n   This court did not hold in White that the marital communi-\ncations privilege should not apply to an admission by the\naccused to his or her spouse that he or she had sexually\nabused their grandchild. Without citation to any relevant lan-\nguage in White, the majority has erroneously construed that\ndecision to limit the exception to the marital communications\nprivilege in prosecutions for crimes against children to state-\nments made by “the functional equivalents of parents.”\nMajority Opinion at 2238. Our holding in White was limited\nas follows: a trial court can properly balance the admission of\n\f2248                   UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nthe voluntary testimony of a spouse, regarding the threats by\nthe accused to harm a stepchild, against the privilege that\ncommunications between spouses should be treated as confi-\ndential and inadmissible in a criminal proceeding to maintain\nmarital harmony. White, 974 F.2d at 1138.\n\n   We held in White that the critical question in determining\nif the marital communications privilege should apply is\nwhether or not the conduct is “inconsistent with the purposes\nof the marital communications privilege: promoting confiden-\ntial communications between spouses in order to foster mari-\ntal harmony.” Id. Obviously, an admission to a spouse by the\naccused that he produced a video for distribution on the inter-\nnet depicting his masturbation of their grandchild to other\npedophiles would destroy the harmonious relationship of mar-\nital partners.\n\n   Indeed, the impact of Banks’s admission that he abused\ntheir grandchild must have been emotionally devastating to\nhis wife in view of her knowledge that “the [grand]child in\nquestion [was] the son of the very person [Banks] plead guilty\nto molesting and going to prison for in 1990.” Transcript of\nRecord at 371, United States v. Banks, Case No. 1:06-CR-\n00051-S-BLW-WBS. See also Indictment, Case No. 1:06-\nCR-00051-S-BLW, March 14, 2006.2 After Banks pled guilty\nto sexually molesting their son, he was imprisoned for twelve\nyears. Transcript of Record at 3, 371, Banks, Case No. 1:06-\nCR-00051-S-BLW-WBS.\n\n                                   II\n\n  Any inquiry concerning the federal court’s extension of a\n  2\n   According to the indictment in this case, and testimony at trial, Banks\nwas convicted in Ada County Case No. CR 16884 on two counts of Lewd\nConduct with a Minor Under Age Sixteen, in violation of Idaho Code\n§ 18-1508, for aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse and abusive sexual\nconduct on his 11-year old son.\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS                      2249\ntestimonial privilege necessarily begins with Rule 501. The\ngenesis of the language of Rule 501 can be traced to the\nSupreme Court’s decisions in Funk v. United States, 290 U.S.\n371 (1933) and Wolfle v. United States, 291 U.S. 7 (1934).\nThe Funk decision tracks language from Benson v. United\nStates, 146 U.S. 325 (1892). In Benson, the government called\nas a witness a codefendant whose trial had been severed from\nthat of the accused. Benson, 146 U.S. at 335. Precedent\nappeared to require that the court declare the codefendant was\nnot competent. Id. at 336 (“It is familiar knowledge that the\nold common law carefully excluded from the witness stand\nparties to the record, and those who were interested in the\nresult; and this rule extended to both civil and criminal\ncases.”) In Benson, the Supreme Court held that it was not\n“precluded by [precedent] from examining this question in the\nlight of general authority and sound reason.” Benson, 146\nU.S. at 335. In reviewing the historical grounds for excluding\na codefendent from testifying, the Supreme Court explained\nthat\n\n    [t]he courts were afraid to trust the intelligence of\n    jurors. But the last fifty years have wrought a great\n    change in these respects, and today the tendency is\n    to enlarge the domain of competency and to submit\n    to the jury for their consideration as to the credibility\n    of the witness those matters which heretofore were\n    ruled sufficient to justify his exclusion. This change\n    has been wrought partially by legislation and par-\n    tially by judicial construction.\n\nId. at 336.\n\n   Thus, because traditional reasons for holding a codefendant\nincompetent to testify against an accused were no longer\ndeemed sound, the Court revised the rule, supporting its con-\nclusion by citing a trend toward a rule against incompetency.\nId. at 337 (“Legislation of similar import prevails in most of\n\f2250                UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nthe States. The spirit of this legislation has controlled the\ndecisions of the courts . . .”).\n\n   In Funk, the Supreme Court overturned the rule prohibiting\nspousal testimony in federal criminal trials. Funk, 290 U.S. at\n387 (overruling, in part, Hendrix v. United States, 219 U.S. 79\n(1911) and Jin Fuey Moy v. United States, 254 U.S. 189\n(1920)). Citing Benson, the Supreme Court in Funk rejected\nthe notion “that the courts, in the face of greatly changed con-\nditions, are still chained to the ancient formulae and are pow-\nerless to declare and enforce modifications deemed to have\nbeen wrought in the common law itself by force of these\nchanged conditions.” Funk, 290 U.S. at 379. Instead, the\nCourt held that the question should be “disposed of . . . in the\nlight of general authority and sound reason.” Id. at 380.\nReviewing the early, common law rule that a spouse was\nincompetent to testify for an accused spouse, in Funk the\nCourt reasoned as follows:\n\n    The fundamental basis upon which all rules of evi-\n    dence must rest — if they are to rest upon reason —\n    is their adaptation to the successful development of\n    the truth. And since experience is of all teachers the\n    most dependable, and since experience also is a con-\n    tinuous process, it follows that a rule of evidence at\n    one time thought necessary to the ascertainment of\n    truth should yield to the experience of a succeeding\n    generation whenever that experience has clearly\n    demonstrated the fallacy or unwisdom of the old\n    rule.\n\nId. at 381. The Court further explained that\n\n    the exclusion of the wife’s testimony, in the face of\n    the broad and liberal extension of the rules in respect\n    of the competency of witnesses generally, [can no\n    longer be] justified, if it ever was justified, on any\n    ground of public policy. It has been said that to\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. BANKS                      2251\n      admit such testimony is against public policy\n      because it would endanger the harmony and confi-\n      dence of marital relations, and, moreover, would\n      subject the witness to the temptation to commit per-\n      jury. Modern legislation, in making either spouse\n      competent to testify in behalf of the other in criminal\n      cases, has definitely rejected these notions, and in\n      the light of such legislation and of modern thought\n      they seem to be altogether fanciful. The public pol-\n      icy of one generation may not, under changed condi-\n      tions, be the public policy of another.\n\nId. (citing Patton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276, 306).\n\n   In Wolfle, decided a year after Funk, the Supreme Court\nupheld a ruling by the Ninth Circuit that a husband’s state-\nment, made to his wife through the use of a stenographer, was\nnot privileged, even though it was intended to be communi-\ncated to his wife.3 Wolfe v. United States, 64 F.2d 566 (9th\nCir. 1933). The Supreme Court held that evidentiary rules are\n“governed by common-law principles as interpreted and\napplied by the federal courts in the light of reason and\nexperience.” Wolfe, 291 U.S. at 12 (emphasis added). The\nexamination of “general authority” as described in Funk, thus\nevolved into an assessment of “experience” in Wolfle. As part\nof its assessment of “experience,” the Court in Wolfe\nreviewed various state court privilege rulings, some predi-\ncated on state statutes, and concluded that the defendant’s\nstatement was not protected by the privilege protecting mari-\ntal confidences. Id. at 17.\n\n  It is indisputable that Congress endorsed inclusion of state\nlaw in directing federal courts to develop “common law prin-\n  3\n   The stenographer testified that the defendant dictated a letter to his\nwife which contained the following reference to the Cantu Mine: “I am\ngoing to break in and whenever I do, I am going to rob every last one of\nthem blind.” Id.\n\f2252                UNITED STATES v.

Redmond, 518 U.S. 1, 8 (1996) (“The\nauthors of the Rule borrowed this phrase from our opinion in\nWolfle v. United States, 291 U.S. 7, 12 (1934)”). In Jaffee, the\ncourt stated that “it is appropriate to treat a consistent body of\npolicy determinations by state legislatures as reflecting both\n‘reason’ and ‘experience.’ ” 518 U.S. at 13.\n\n   The Supreme Court held in Trammel v. United States, 445\nU.S. 40 (1980) that in “enacting Rule 501, Congress mani-\nfested an affirmative intention not to freeze the law of privi-\nlege.” 445 U.S. at 47. Under Rule 501, federal courts are\nauthorized to “develop[ ] . . . testimonial privileges in federal\ncriminal trials governed by the principles of the common law\nas they may be interpreted . . . in the light of reason and expe-\nrience.” Id. In enacting Rule 501, Congress did not restrict\ndevelopment in the law of privilege to federal legislation, and\ndeclined to limit the range of possible privileges. Congress\ninstead crafted Rule 501 in order to “provide the courts with\nthe flexibility to develop rules of privilege on a case-by-case\nbasis.” Id. citing 120 Cong. Rec. 40891 (1974) (statement of\nRep. Hungate). It was Congress’ intent “to leave the door\nopen to change.” Id. After embarking on a comprehensive\nreview of the history of the marital testimonial privilege, as\nwell as the evolving trends in state law concerning the marital\ncommunications privilege, the Court noted that “support for\nthe privilege against adverse spousal testimony ha[d] eroded”\nin recent years, and affirmed the lower court’s ruling that the\nwitness-spouse alone holds the privilege to refuse to testify\nadversely. Id. The Court noted in Trammel that\n\n    [w]hen one spouse is willing to testify against the\n    other in a criminal proceeding — whatever the moti-\n    vation — their relationship is almost certainly in dis-\n    repair; there is probably little in the way of marital\n    harmony for the privilege to preserve. In these cir-\n    cumstances, a rule of evidence that permits the\n    accused to prevent adverse spousal testimony seems\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. BANKS                        2253\n      far more likely to frustrate justice than to foster fam-\n      ily peace.\n\nId. at 52 (emphasis added).4\n\n   The courts’ intent to foster evolution in the area of testimo-\nnial privilege was reinforced more recently in Jaffee. In Jaf-\nfee, the Supreme Court held, for the first time, that\ncommunications within the psychotherapist-patient relation-\nship are privileged. Jaffee, 518 U.S. at 8-9. In recognizing the\nnew testimonial privilege, the Court insisted that reliance\nupon laws enacted by state legislatures should be used as a\nmodel for developing the common law of privilege pursuant\nto Rule 501 is entirely “appropriate.” See id. at 13 (“In Funk\nv. United States, we recognized that it is appropriate to treat\na consistent body of policy determinations by state legisla-\ntures as reflecting both ‘reason’ and ‘experience.’ ”) (citation\nomitted). The Court explained\n\n      [t]hat it is appropriate for the federal courts to recog-\n      nize a psychotherapist privilege under Rule 501 is\n      confirmed by the fact that all 50 States and the Dis-\n      trict of Columbia have enacted into law some form\n      of psychotherapist privilege. We have previously\n      observed that the policy decisions of the States bear\n      on the question whether federal courts should recog-\n      nize a new privilege or amend the coverage of an\n      existing one.\n\nId. at 12 (citing Trammel, 445 U.S. at 48-50; United States v.\nGillock, 445 U.S. 360, 368, n. 8 (1980)).\n\n   The Court reasoned in Jaffee that “[b]ecause state legisla-\ntures are fully aware of the need to protect the integrity of the\nfactfinding functions of their courts, the existence of a con-\n  4\n   The majority has failed to cite Trammel or discuss its duty not to freeze\nthe law of privilege.\n\f2254                UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nsensus among the States indicates that ‘reason and experi-\nence’ support recognition of the privilege.” Jaffee, 518 U.S.\nat 13. The Court also noted that “[i]t is of no consequence that\nrecognition of the privilege in the vast majority of states is the\nproduct of legislative action rather than judicial decision.” Id.\n“The present unanimous acceptance of the privilege” by “state\nlawmakers” is persuasive proof of a solid social “consensus”\nthat the psychotherapist-patient relationship merits the protec-\ntion of an evidentiary privilege. Id. Thus, the stated policy\nunderlying Rule 501 is served by consideration not only of\nstate case law, but also laws enacted by the states in develop-\ning the law of privilege. The majority has failed to look to\nlaws enacted by Idaho and other states that permit a spouse\nto testify regarding a spouse’s admission in a state prosecu-\ntion concerning sexual abuse of a minor child.\n\n                                A\n\n   The two primary assumptions underlying the recognition of\ntestimonial privileges as articulated by the Court in Jaffee are\nthat\n\n    there is a general duty to give what testimony one is\n    capable of giving, and, any exceptions which may\n    exist are distinctly exceptional, being so many dero-\n    gations from a positive general rule. Exceptions from\n    the general rule disfavoring testimonial privileges\n    may be justified, however, by a “public good tran-\n    scending the normally predominant principle of uti-\n    lizing all rational means for ascertaining the truth.”\n\nId. at 9 (internal citations omitted) (quoting Trammel, 445\nU.S. at 50-51 (holding that because “[t]estimonial exclusion-\nary rules and privileges contravene the fundamental principle\nthat ‘the public . . . has a right to every man’s evidence,’ . . .\nthey must be strictly construed”)).\n\n   The traditional justification for a marital adverse testimo-\nnial privilege is that it serves the “public good” because forc-\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS                    2255\ning one spouse to testify against another in a criminal case\nwould lead to one of two unacceptable results: it could poten-\ntially cause a break up of the marriage if the witness spouse\nvoluntarily inculpated her husband, or it could promote per-\njury. See, e.g., Clements v. Marston, 52 N.H. 31 (1872). As\nexplained by the court in Clements:\n\n    At common law . . . [a]ny person not a party, if inter-\n    ested in the result of the suit, was excluded as a wit-\n    ness on the ground of interest. Wives were excluded,\n    —1st, on the ground of interest, they being interested\n    wherever their husbands were; and 2d, upon the\n    ground of public policy, that it was not expedient to\n    place husband and wife in a position that might lead\n    to dissensions and strife between them, or that might\n    encourage perjury. Hence, wives were not allowed to\n    testify for or against their husbands when they were\n    parties to civil proceedings, and, for the same reason,\n    both were excluded when either was a party in a\n    criminal case.\n\nId. at 37; see also Trammel, 445 U.S. at 44 (“The modern jus-\ntification for this privilege against adverse spousal testimony\nis its perceived role in fostering the harmony and sanctity of\nthe marriage relationship.”).\n\n                                B\n\n   Since Trammel was decided in 1980, courts, federal and\nstate, and state legislatures, have continued to limit the marital\ncommunications privilege in obedience to the Court’s direc-\ntion that it “must be strictly construed and accepted ‘only to\nthe very limited extent that permitting a refusal to testify or\nexcluding relevant evidence has a public good transcending\nthe normally predominant principle of utilization of all ratio-\nnal means for ascertaining the truth.’ ” Id. at 50 (quoting\nElkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206, 234 (1960) (Frank-\nfurter, J. dissenting)). This trend undeniably demonstrates that\n\f2256                   UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nmarital communications regarding the sexual abuse of a minor\nchild are not protected because they are antithetical to soci-\nety’s concept of the marital relationship. In analyzing the\nquestion whether the marital communications privilege should\napply to communications concerning crimes against the\ngrandchild of an accused, it is not only instructive to review\nthis evolving trend, it is required that we do so if we are to\ninterpret “the principles of the common law . . . in the light\nof reason and experience.” Fed. R. Evid. 501.5\n\n   In United States v. Allery, 526 F.2d 1362 (8th Cir. 1975),\nthe Eighth Circuit held, in an opinion announced prior to the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Trammel, “that a serious crime\nagainst a child is an offense against that family[’s] harmony\nand to society as well.” Id. at 1366. The court held in Allery\nthat the marital facts privilege did not apply in a case where\nthe defendant’s step-child was the victim. Id. at 1367.\n\n   In United States v. White, 974 F.2d 1135 (9th Cir. 1992),\nthis court cited Allery in extending the exception to the mari-\ntal communications privilege to include statements relating to\ncrimes against step-children. White, 974 F.2d at 1138. We\nheld in White that “the marital communications privilege\nshould not apply to statements relating to a crime where a\nspouse or a spouse’s children are the victims.” Id. We rea-\nsoned in White that “[p]rotecting threats against a spouse or\nthe spouse’s children is inconsistent with the purposes of the\nmarital communications privilege: promoting confidential\ncommunications between spouses in order to foster marital\nharmony.” Id. We also stated in White that because the marital\n  5\n    In Trammel, the Supreme Court admonished federal courts to continue\n“the evolutionary development of testimonial privileges.” 445 U.S. at 47.\nIn other contexts, such as in Eighth Amendment cases, the Court has\ninstructed that federal courts may give “great weight” to “objective evi-\ndence of contemporary values.” Kennedy v. Louisiana, 128 S. Ct. 2641,\n2658 (2008) (reviewing state statutes for “objective indicia of consensus”\nas to whether the death penalty is an appropriate punishment in cases of\nchild rape).\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. BANKS                      2257\ncommunications privilege “obstructs the truth seeking pro-\ncess,” its use “in criminal proceedings requires a particularly\nnarrow construction because of society’s strong interest in the\nadministration of justice.” Id.\n\n   In United States v. Bahe, 128 F.3d 1440 (10th Cir. 1997),\nthe Tenth Circuit held that “we recognize an exception to the\nmarital communications privilege for spousal testimony relat-\ning to the abuse of any minor child within the household.” Id.\nat 1446. The Tenth Circuit reasoned as follows in Bahe:\n\n    We see no significant difference, as a policy matter,\n    between a crime against a child of the married cou-\n    ple, against a stepchild living in the home or, as here,\n    against an eleven-year-old relative visiting in the\n    home. Child abuse is a horrendous crime. It gener-\n    ally occurs in the home . . . and is often covered up\n    by the innocence of small children and by threats\n    against disclosure. It would be unconscionable to\n    permit a privilege grounded on promoting communi-\n    cations of trust and love between marriage partners\n    to prevent a properly outraged spouse with knowl-\n    edge from testifying against the perpetrator of such\n    a crime.\n\nId. at 1446 (citation omitted). Since we published our decision\nin White, a number of jurisdictions have held that an\naccused’s statements to his spouse relating to crimes against\nchildren are admissable without limiting the exception to\ncrimes against children of the marriage or of either spouse.\n\n   In United States v. Martinez, 44 F. Supp. 2d 835 (W.D.\nTex. 1999), the district court held that “in a case where one\nspouse is accused of abusing minor children, society’s interest\nin the administration of justice far outweighs its interest in\nprotecting whatever harmony or trust may at that point still\nremain in the marital relationship.” Id. at 836. “Reason and\nexperience dictate that the marital communications privilege\n\f2258                UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nshould not apply to statements relating to a crime where the\nvictim is a minor child.” Id. (internal quotation omitted).\n\n   In Fisher v. State, 690 So. 2d 268 (Miss. 1996), the defen-\ndant challenged his conviction for the capital rape of his 11-\nyear-old niece on the ground that the trial court erred in\nallowing his wife to testify that he admitted sexually abusing\nhis niece to her. The Supreme Court of Mississippi interpreted\nMississippi Rule of Evidence 504 (d) to except from the mari-\ntal communications privilege testimony relating to crimes\nagainst any minor child. Id. at 272.\n\n   In State v. Modest, 88 Wn. App. 239 (Wash. Ct. App.\n1997), the court held that under Rev. Code Wash. (ARCW)\n§ 5.60.060, “the guardianship exception applies when any\nspouse acts in loco parentis, meaning when he or she assumes\nthe parental character or discharges parental duties, even if for\na very short time.” Id. at 247-48. The Washington statute con-\nstrued in Modest provided that communications between\nspouses are not protected by the marital privilege in a “pro-\nceeding for a crime committed by said spouse or domestic\npartner against any child of whom said spouse or domestic\npartner is the parent or guardian.” Rev. Code Wash. (ARCW)\n§ 5.60.060. The court in Modest considered “the paramount\nlegislative intent to insure effective prosecutions for sexual\ncrimes against children,” and concluded that “[i]n light of this\noverriding concern, [the court] liberally interprets the word\n‘guardian’ to punish child abusers and protect children from\nfurther mistreatment.” Id.\n\n  In State v. Countryman, 572 N.W.2d 553 (Iowa 1997), the\nIowa Supreme Court held that Iowa Code § 232.74, which\nprohibited the disclosure of communications between married\npersons, did not apply in a child abuse prosecution. Id. at 561.\n\n  In Munson v. State, 959 S.W.2d 391 (Ark. 1998), the defen-\ndant was charged with sexually assaulting his wife’s 14-\nfourteen-year-old sister, who was visiting in their home when\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. BANKS                    2259\nthe crime occurred. Id. at 392. Rule 504(d)(3) of the Arkansas\nRules of Evidence sets forth an exception to the marital privi-\nlege when one spouse is charged with a crime against the per-\nson or property of a person “residing” in the household of\neither. Ark. R. Evid. 504(d)(3). The Supreme Court of Arkan-\nsas held in Munson that the victim in the case was “residing”\nin the accused’s household because her “temporary residence\nwith the Munsons presented the same opportunity to Mr.\nMunson he would have had if the victim intended to remain\nin the household indefinitely.” Id. at 393.\n\n   In Villalta v. Commonwealth, 428 Mass. 429 (Mass. 1998),\nthe Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts addressed the\nquestion whether the marital communications privilege\napplied to preclude the accused’s spouse from testifying\nagainst her husband, who was charged with rape, indecent\nassault and battery, and assault and battery on a two-year-old\ngirl. The child was unrelated to the wife or the husband. She\nperiodically received day-care services from the accused’s\nspouse in their home. Id. at 429-30. The trial court allowed\nMrs. Villalta to invoke the marital communications privilege.\nId. at 430. The trial court concluded Mass. Gen. Law Ann. ch.\n233, § 20 was inapplicable when the alleged victim was not\na child of either spouse and did not live with them. Id. The\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts disagreed. Section\n20 provides that “except in any proceeding relating to child\nabuse, including incest, neither husband nor wife shall be\nrequired to testify in the trial of an indictment, complaint or\nother criminal proceeding against the other.” Mass. Gen. Law\nAnn. ch. 233, § 20. The Supreme Judicial Court interpreted\nthe statute as follows:\n\n    We see no logical reason for the Legislature to deny\n    the spousal privilege when a young victim of abuse\n    is a child of one or both spouses (or other child\n    closely related by consanguinity) but to perpetuate\n    the privilege when the young victim is related to nei-\n    ther spouse. The abuse is the same. Society’s interest\n\f2260                UNITED STATES v. BANKS\n    in convicting and punishing one who commits child\n    abuse is the same. The threat to the preservation of\n    the family unit arising from one spouse being com-\n    pelled to testify against the other seems substantially\n    identical in all instances. Indeed, if the defendant’s\n    alleged child abuse was not incestuous, the spouse’s\n    compelled testimony might be less threatening to the\n    marriage than if she were compelled to testify, as the\n    wife and defendant agree she must, concerning\n    incestuous child abuse, which involves an even\n    greater stigma than child abuse alone. The criminal\n    conduct asserted in this case, abuse of the victim in\n    the defendant’s home, shows that the need for the\n    testimony of a defendant’s spouse may be as great as\n    it would be if the alleged victim were their own\n    child. We choose to apply the literal meaning of the\n    words “child abuse” to § 20, cl. Second. Child abuse\n    in common usage is not limited to the abuse of one’s\n    own child but means the abuse of any child.\n\nId. at 434-35.\n\n   In J.S. v. R.T.H., 155 N.J. 330 (1998), a civil action was\nfiled against the wife of a 64-year old man, who had pled\nguilty to criminally sexually assaulting two unrelated, adoles-\ncent neighbor girls — ages 12 and 15. Id. at 334. The parents\nof the children alleged the perpetrator’s wife was liable for\ntheir physical and emotional injury, because she “was aware\nof her husband’s history of pedophilia as well as his conduct\ninvolving these children.” Id. at 335 n.1 (citing J.S. v. R.T.H.,\n301 N.J. Super. 150 (App.Div., 1997)). The Supreme Court of\nNew Jersey held that the defendant-wife could be held liable\nfor her husband’s criminal conduct if she knew of or should\nhave known of his sexual proclivities but failed to warn oth-\ners. Id. at 352.\n\n  Noting that the New Jersey legislature had dealt compre-\nhensively with the subject of child abuse, and enacted statutes\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS                  2261\ndesigned to prevent the sexual abuse of children, the court\ncommented that “it is the intent of this legislation to assure\nthat the lives of innocent children are immediately safe-\nguarded from further injury and possible death and that the\nlegal rights of such children are fully protected.” Id. at 343.\nThe court acknowledged that “[w]hile the interest in protect-\ning children from sexual abuse is great, this Court must also\ntake into consideration defendants’ interests in a stable marital\nrelationship and in marital privacy.” Id at 345 (citing State v.\nSzemple, 135 N.J. 406, 414 (1994)). The court concluded,\nhowever, that “[t]he societal interest in enhancing marital\nrelationships cannot outweigh the societal interest in protect-\ning children from sexual abuse. The child-abuse reporting\nstatute itself has mandated that balance—it applies to every\ncitizen, including a spouse.” Id. (citations omitted). “As the\nAppellate Division here described, ‘the Legislature’s adoption\nof that statute [i.e., “Megan’s Law”] is an expression of New\nJersey’s strong public policy favoring protection of children\nover the privacy of an offending adult.’ ” Id. (citing 301 N.J.\nSuper. at 157, 693). “Thus, ‘[t]he protective privilege ends\nwhere the public peril begins.’ ” Id. (citing Tarasoff v.\nRegents of the Univ. of Cal., 17 Cal. 3d 425 (1976). The\nSupreme Court of New Jersey upheld the Appellate Divi-\nsion’s decision to overrule Rozycki v. Peley, 199 N.J. Super.\n571, 579 (Law Div.1984) “to the extent that it ‘places a higher\npriority upon preserving the defendants’ marital relationship\nthan upon protecting children from abuse.’ ” Id. (citing 301\nN.J. Super. at 157). The court explained its ruling as follows:\n\n    This Court has recognized that the sexual abuse of\n    children not only traumatizes the victims, but also\n    exacts a heavy toll on society: Recent research indi-\n    cates that a number of psychosocial problems—\n    including chronic depression and anxiety, isolation\n    and poor social adjustment, substance abuse, suicidal\n    behavior, and involvement in physically or sexually\n    abusive relationships as either aggressor or victim—\n    are more common among adults molested as chil-\n\f2262                   UNITED STATES v. BANKS\n      dren than among those with no such childhood expe-\n      riences. Victims of sexual abuse can suffer an\n      impaired ability to critically evaluate the motives\n      and behavior of others, making them more vulnera-\n      ble to revictimization. An especially disturbing find-\n      ing about child sexual abuse is its strong\n      intergenerational pattern; in particular, due to the\n      psychological impact of their own abuse, sexually\n      abused boys have been found to be more likely than\n      non-abused boys to turn into offenders against the\n      next generation of children, and sexually abused\n      girls are more likely to become mothers of children\n      who are abused. And studies show that adult male\n      aggressive behavior, particularly sexual aggression,\n      is associated with the trauma of childhood sexual\n      abuse. Thus, apart from the substantial personal\n      trauma caused to the victims of such crimes, sexual\n      crimes against children exact heavy social costs as\n      well.\n\nId.

The court held that “Rule 504(b)(4)(A) states that\nthe privilege does not apply in any proceeding in which the\nperson is charged with “a crime against the person’s spouse,\na member of the household of either spouse, or any minor.”\nId.

BANKS\n    a. a parent, guardian, or foster parent; b. a relative or\n    any other person with whom the child resides and\n    who assumes care or supervision of the child, with-\n    out reference to the length of time or continuity of\n    such residence; c. an employee or agent of any pub-\n    lic or private facility providing care for a child,\n    including an institution, hospital, health care facility,\n    group home, mental health center, residential treat-\n    ment center, shelter care facility, detention center, or\n    child care facility; or, d. any person providing care\n    for a child, but with whom the child does not reside,\n    without reference to the duration of the care.\n\nSee Iowa Code § 232.68(7).\n\n   In Commonwealth v. Spetzer, 572 Pa. 17 (2002), the\nSupreme Court of Pennsylvania reviewed the admissibility of\ncommunications between the accused and his wife concerning\nthe rape of his step-daughter. The court stated that:\n\n    Even if it is assumed that the [statutory exceptions to\n    the marital communications privilege specifically\n    addressing child abuse do] not act directly to provide\n    a broad child abuse “exception” to [the application\n    of Pennsylvania’s marital communications privilege]\n    in criminal proceedings, it certainly affects what a\n    spouse’s “reasonable expectation” of continued con-\n    fidentiality may be with respect to marital communi-\n    cations that reveal the previous or intended abuse\n    and intimidation of a child.\n\nId. at 42. Accordingly, the court held that the accused who\ndescribed to his wife his previous abuse of a child had no rea-\nsonable expectation under Pennsylvania law that such com-\nmunication will “remain confidential.” Id.\n\n                               C\n\n  Thirty-eight states, and the District of Columbia, have\nenacted legislation expanding, by statute or rule, exceptions to\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. BANKS                 2265\nthe marital communications privilege.

The majority has failed\nto explain, however, why it has ignored the fact that Idaho,\nand many other states, have adopted an exception to the mari-\ntal communications privilege in prosecutions for crimes\nagainst children. The majority has also failed to consider or\nexplain the paradoxical impact on the public’s perception of\nthe rule of law that will result from the fact that an accused’s\nadmissions of the abuse of any child are admissible in most\nstate courts, but cannot be presented into evidence in the fed-\neral court across the street.\n\n   Most of the states within the Ninth Circuit have adopted\nlaws that extend the marital communications exception\nbeyond our holding in White. Indeed, Arizona, Idaho, Nevada,\nand Oregon have eliminated the privilege entirely where the\ncommunication relates to a crime against any child while in\nthe custody or control of either spouse. See Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. §§ 13-4062 & 13-604 (eliminating the privilege in cases\ninvolving any “dangerous crime against children” and\n“[s]exual conduct with a minor under fifteen years of age”);\nIdaho Code Ann. §9-203 (precluding use of the privilege in\n“any case of physical injury to a child where the injury has\nbeen cause as a result of physical abuse or neglect by one or\nboth of the parents” and “any case of lewd and lascivious con-\nduct or attempted lewd and lascivious conduct where either\nparty would otherwise be protected by this privilege”); Nev.\n\f                     UNITED STATES v. BANKS                    2269\nRev. Stat. § 49.295(2)(e)(2) (2007) (eliminating the privilege\nif the crime is against “a child in the custody or control of\neither spouse”); Ore. Rev. Stat. § 419B.040 (“the husband-\nwife privilege, shall not be a ground for excluding evidence\nregarding a child’s abuse, or the cause thereof, in any judicial\nproceeding”).\n\n   The Washington legislature has created an exception to the\nprivilege where either spouse or domestic partner is consid-\nered the parent or guardian of a child victim. Wash. Rev.\nCode. § 5.60.060(a) (2007). The Supreme Court of Washing-\nton held in State v. Waleczek, 90 Wn.2d 746 (1978) that a\nhusband and wife who hosted a seven-year-old girl for an\novernight sleepover (during the course of which she was sex-\nually assaulted), were considered “guardians” under Wash.\nRev. Code § 5.60.060(1). Waleczek, 90 Wn.2d at 753. In\nWaleczek, the court explained:\n\n      Defendant and his wife voluntarily undertook duties\n      that are normally characterized as parental: They\n      agreed to let Theraesa sleep at their house, wake her\n      up in the morning, provide her with breakfast, and\n      make sure she went to school. In addition, we have\n      no doubt that Theraesa, being only 7 years old,\n      would trust, respect, and obey defendant and his wife\n      principally because she had been left in their care by\n      her own mother.\n\nId.\n\n   In California, the legislature has created an exception to the\nmarital communications privilege when a spouse is charged\nwith “[a] crime against the person or property of the other\nspouse or of a child, parent, relative, or cohabitant of either.”\nCal. Evid. Code § 972(c)(1) (emphasis added). Hawaii has\neliminated the privilege “in proceedings in which one spouse\nis charged with a crime against . . . a third person residing in\nthe household.” Haw. R. Evid. 505(c)(1)(C).\n\f2270                UNITED STATES v. BANKS\n    The statutes in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon have\nunambiguously eliminated the privilege entirely where the\ncommunication relates to a crime against any child while in\nthe custody or control of either spouse. The majority has\nfailed utterly to discuss the impact of state-created exceptions\nto the marital communications privileges or “recognize state\nprivileges where this can be accomplished at no substantial\ncost to federal substantive and procedural policy.” Shadur,\n664 F.2d at 106. In declining to consider the evolutionary\ndevelopment of the law throughout the United States rejecting\nthe marital communications privilege where the victim of a\nspouse’s crime is their grandchild, the majority has cobbled\ntogether an amorphous standard that limits the exception to\nthe functional equivalent of a child or stepchild. This unde-\nfined concept will no doubt baffle anyone who tries to apply\nit.\n\n                       CONCLUSION\n\n   In explaining its reasons for admitting the testimony of\nBanks’s spouse concerning his admission that he produced the\nvideo depicting the crime Banks committed against his grand-\nchild, the district court, unlike the majority in this matter,\nscrupulously fulfilled its duty to apply Rule 501 as interpreted\nby the Supreme Court in Trammel. The district court reasoned\nas follows:\n\n    The question then is under those relevant facts, does\n    the exception to the marital communications privi-\n    lege apply? And does the court extend or interpret\n    the Ninth Circuit’s decision in White to apply to\n    those circumstances? In making that determination,\n    you have to look to the reasons for the privilege.\n    And the reasons for the privilege are discussed by\n    the Ninth Circuit in White.\n\n    First of all, the Ninth Circuit cautions us that the\n    privilege must be narrowly construed because it\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS                     2271\n    obstructs the truth seeking process. And they say the\n    use of the privilege in criminal proceedings requires\n    a particularly narrow construction because of soci-\n    ety’s strong interest in the administration of justice.\n\n    The public policy reasons for the privilege are to\n    protect the integrity of marriages and insure that\n    spouses are able to freely communicate with each\n    other. There has to be somebody that you can go to\n    to bear your soul. But the privilege says if it isn’t\n    your priest, if it isn’t your lawyer, it’s your spouse.\n\n    But when you balance the interests involved, the\n    court in White found that threats against the spouse\n    or the spouse’s children don’t further the purposes of\n    the privilege. Likewise, abuse of the spouse or abuse\n    of the spouses’ children don’t further the privilege.\n    It doesn’t further the privilege to allow someone to\n    talk about abusing the spouse or the spouse’s chil-\n    dren with impunity. It doesn’t further the sanctity of\n    the marriage or the family relationship.\n\n    Well, when you have grandchildren who under the\n    facts of this case have that kind of relationship to the\n    grandparents, it is not even a small step from what\n    the court ruled in White. It is almost exactly the\n    same.\n\nTranscript of Record at 501-02, Banks, Case No. 1:06-CR-\n00051-S-BLW-WBS.\n\n   The district court also noted “that in determining the princi-\nples of the common law as they are interpreted in the courts\nof the United States in light of reason and experience, the\ncourt looks to the state laws of not just Idaho but other states\nfor the reasoning in those decisions and statutes and the expe-\nrience in those states.” Id.\n\f2272               UNITED STATES v. BANKS\n   I would affirm the district court’s well-reasoned assessment\nof common law jurisprudence and the law of Idaho and other\nstates regarding the child victim exception to the marital com-\nmunications privilege. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent\nfrom the majority’s holding that an accused’s admission to his\nspouse that he produced a video depicting his masturbation of\ntheir grandchild was inadmissible under Rule 501.\n\f",

BANKS                 2227\n“masturbation” and “lascivious” as they relate to the subject\nvideo. We affirm the conviction. The district court did not err\nwhen it denied Banks’s motion to suppress or in defining and\napplying the terms “masturbation” and “lascivious.” Although\nthe ruling addressing the marital communications privilege\nwas erroneous, the error was harmless.\n\n                               I.\n\n                      BACKGROUND\n\n   This case began when Special Agent Mary Martin (Agent\nMartin) filed an “Application and Affidavit for Search War-\nrant.” According to the affidavit, a Canadian investigation\ninto child pornography had resulted in the arrest of a Cana-\ndian pedophile who admitted to trading child pornography\nwith Banks. The Canadian pedophile also provided evidence\nthat Banks may have created a pornographic video involving\nBanks’s two-year-old grandson.\n\n   A warrant issued to search Banks’s home for sixteen types\nof items described in the affidavit. As a result of the evidence\nseized pursuant to the warrant, Banks was charged with nine\ncriminal counts relating to the possession, production, trans-\nportation and receipt of images depicting minors engaged in\nsexually explicit conduct. Seven of those charges ultimately\nproceeded to trial.\n\n   Prior to trial, Banks moved to suppress the evidence seized\npursuant to the search warrant, asserting that the affidavit\nlacked foundation and specificity. Banks’s arguments were\nrejected by the district court, and a bench trial ensued.\n\n  At trial, the government called Banks’s wife as a witness.\nMrs. Banks primarily testified about her relationship with the\nminor child in the subject video. She testified that the child\nwas her grandson, with whom she had a close relationship.\nMrs. Banks also identified her husband’s ring, watch and\n\f2228                   UNITED STATES v. BANKS\ncouch in the video.1 Mrs. Banks was asked whether her hus-\nband had made any statements regarding a video involving\ntheir grandson. Over Banks’s objection, Mrs. Banks testified\nthat her husband had admitted to making the video and that\nhe had done so to ensure that “nothing went on in changing\nthe diaper because of past things.”\n\n   The district court found Banks guilty on all counts, con-\ncluding that Banks had created the subject video. The court\nrelied on the testimony identifying Banks’s ring, watch and\ncouch, as well as testimony that Banks had admitted changing\nthe child’s diaper. The district court also determined that the\nvideo contained images of sexually explicit conduct. Specifi-\ncally, the court concluded that the video depicted the mastur-\nbation of a minor child under a definition of masturbation that\nincluded the stimulation of genitalia in a manner that would\nstimulate an adult. The district court found that the video also\ncontained a lascivious exhibition of the genitals of the minor\nchild because it depicted the masturbation of the child “for the\npurpose of eliciting in the viewer a sexual response.”\n\n                                    II.\n\n                   STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n   We review de novo the district court’s rulings on a motion\nto suppress and the validity of a search warrant.

The affidavit contained an adequate foundation to sup-\n  port issuance of the search warrant.\n\n   [1] Statements in an affidavit supporting a search warrant\napplication directed toward “the behavior of a particular class\nof persons” must be supported by “a foundation which shows\nthat the person subject to the search is a member of the class.”\nUnited States v. Weber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554938\"><a href=\"/opinion/554938/united-states-v-peter-john-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1338</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1345 (9th Cir. 1991),\nas amended. In the present case, there was ample information\nin the affidavit to support the notion that Banks was engaging\nin the production and trade of images depicting minors\nengaged in sexually explicit conduct, including evidence of\nthe transmission of such images between Banks and a con-\nvicted sex offender in Canada. Thus, to the extent Banks\nargues that the affidavit failed to set forth the proper founda-\ntion for later assumptions about pedophiles, the requirements\nof Weber were met.\n\n  Further, to the extent that Banks argues that the contested\nsections of the affidavit were required to be supported by\nexpert opinion, he is incorrect. The contested sections pro-\n\f2230                UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nvided background information about how pedophiles act in\nthe digital age, how law enforcement generally conducts\nsearches of computers, and what likely steps would be taken\nto search a computer. None of these topics is so esoteric as to\nrequire expert explanation to be understood. Additionally, at\nthe outset of the affidavit, Agent Martin explained that she\nhas been investigating the sexual exploitation of children\nsince 1998 and has attended training seminars and classes “re-\nlated to conducting these types of investigations.” Her exten-\nsive background was sufficient to support the generalized\nstatements provided in the first three sections of the affidavit.\n\n   Finally, to the extent Banks argues that Agent Martin’s fail-\nure to specifically include the source of her information in\neach section renders the affidavit insufficient to create proba-\nble cause, the argument fails because Banks is unable to dem-\nonstrate that any omission was material or that, “when\nsupplemented with the omitted information, [the affidavit]\nwould be insufficient to support a probable cause finding.”\nUnited States v.

The warrant was sufficiently specific.\n\n   “Specificity has two aspects: particularity and breadth. Par-\nticularity is the requirement that the warrant must clearly state\nwhat is sought.

The warrant in this matter sought evidence\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS                 2231\nthat Banks was engaged in the production and transmission of\nchild pornography. In doing so, it limited its range to items\ncontaining a connection to “child pornography,” “child eroti-\nca,” or “minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct” as\ndefined by statute. This description was sufficiently particular\nto overcome Banks’s argument that the items to be seized\nwere not specifically identified. Id.\n\n   Banks’s contention that the warrant’s lack of a time frame\nrendered it insufficiently particular is unpersuasive because\nthe record and affidavit do not demonstrate knowledge on the\npart of the government that the illegal conduct was limited to\nany particular time frame. Cf. United States v. Kow, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"698432\"><a href=\"/opinion/698432/united-states-v-stephen-kow-helen-kim-noi-soo-and-hong-tho-luu/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 427 (9th Cir. 1995) (invalidating a warrant where the\naffidavit indicated that the criminal activity began at a spe-\ncific time period but the warrant was not limited to a particu-\nlar time frame).\n\n   Banks’s final suggestion that the warrant was insufficiently\nparticular because it did not specifically seek to recover the\nvideos known to have been transmitted and because it failed\nto identify the name of the internet chat room that Banks\nmoderated also fails. Although the government may have\nknown the name of certain files that supported the finding of\nprobable cause, there is no requirement that the warrant be\ntailored to obtain only that evidence already known to exist.\nIn fact, this heightened limitation has been specifically\nrejected. See Meek, 366 F.3d at 716.\n\n   Banks also challenges the breadth of the warrant, asserting\nthat the items seized could have been described more specifi-\ncally and that the warrant should have excluded a search of\nBanks’s home-based business.\n\n   The affidavit submitted in support of the warrant in this\ncase explained that “computer storage devices . . . can store\nthe equivalent of thousands of pages of information.” It also\nnoted that a user wanting to conceal evidence “often stores it\n\f2232                UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nin random order with deceptive file names.” The affidavit\nthen noted that searching computers “for criminal evidence is\na highly technical process requiring expert skill and a prop-\nerly controlled environment.” Finally, the affidavit provided\nevidence that computers at the Banks’s residence had been\nused to obtain and transfer child pornography.\n\n   [3] “[N]o more specific description of the computer equip-\nment sought was possible,” United States v. Hay, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771007\"><a href=\"/opinion/771007/united-states-v-alexander-montagu-hay/\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 637 (9th Cir. 2000) (citation and footnote reference omit-\nted), because there was no way to know where the offending\nimages had been stored. “Further, the affidavit explained why\nit was necessary to seize the entire computer system in order\nto examine the electronic data for contraband,” id., and the\n“warrant did not authorize[ ] seizure of every document, but\nof child pornography which is a sufficiently specific defini-\ntion to focus the search.” Id. at 638 (footnote reference omit-\nted).\n\n   “A generalized seizure of business documents may be justi-\nfied” if it is demonstrated that “the government could not rea-\nsonably segregate . . . documents on the basis of whether or\nnot they were likely to evidence criminal activity.” Kow, 58\nF.3d at 427, 428 (citations omitted). A full reading of the affi-\ndavit in this matter reveals that no more limited search would\nhave been feasible, even if the evidence of Banks’s home\nbusiness had been more fully set forth. As in Meek, “the war-\nrant here did not authorize ‘the seizure of virtually every doc-\nument and computer file’ without indicating how items were\nrelated to the suspected crime.” 366 F.3d at 715 (citation\nomitted) (distinguishing Kow). Rather, the warrant sought\nonly evidence of child pornography and appropriately limited\nits search and seizure provisions to attain this objective. See\nid. at 715-16.\n\n [4] Thus, the district court did not err in denying Banks’s\nmotion to suppress.\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS                  2233\n  C. Although the district court erred in applying the\n  marital communications privilege, the error was harmless.\n\n   Over Banks’s objection that the testimony was protected by\nthe marital communications privilege, the district court\nallowed Banks’s wife to testify to statements made by Banks\nduring the course of their marriage concerning why Banks\ncreated the video.\n\n   [5] The marital communications privilege “protects from\ndisclosure private communications between spouses,” Griffin,\n440 F.3d at 1143-44 (citations omitted), and may be invoked\nby the non-testifying spouse. Marashi, 913 F.2d at 729. The\nprivilege exists “to protect the integrity of marriages and\nensure that spouses freely communicate with one another.”\nGriffin, 440 F.3d at 1143 (citation, alterations and internal\nquotation marks omitted). However, because the marital com-\nmunications privilege “obstructs the truth seeking process,”\nits use “in criminal proceedings requires a particularly narrow\nconstruction because of society’s strong interest in the admin-\nistration of justice.” United States v. White, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590333\"><a href=\"/opinion/590333/united-states-v-joseph-lamont-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1138 (9th Cir. 1992) (citation omitted).\n\n   [6] While balancing the public’s interest in the full and fair\nadministration of justice and the need to protect the integrity\nof marriage and ensure that spouses freely communicate, we\nhave created two exceptions to the privilege. First, “the mari-\ntal communications privilege does not apply to statements\nmade in furtherance of joint criminal activity.” Marashi, 913\nF.2d at 731. Second, “the marital communications privilege\nshould not apply to statements relating to a crime where a\nspouse or a spouse’s children are the victims.” White, 974\nF.2d at 1138. It is the extent of this second exception that we\nnow consider.\n\n  In White, we agreed with the balancing test set forth by the\nEighth Circuit in United States v. Allery, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1362</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1366-67 (8th Cir. 1975), which concluded that an exception\n\f2234                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nto the marital privilege was needed to protect the children of\neither spouse from abuse by the other spouse. Id. at 1367. The\ndistrict court’s ruling in this case demonstrates its belief that\nthe White exception should extend to those individuals con-\nsidered the functional equivalent of the children protected in\nWhite.\n\n   In determining whether the functional equivalent of a child/\nparent relationship should support an exception to the marital\ncommunications privilege, the rationale of Allery is instruc-\ntive. In Allery, the court extended the exception to allow testi-\nmony when a crime has been committed against the child of\neither spouse, recognizing that “in light of today’s society,”\nthe policy behind the privilege requires expansion of its\nexceptions. 526 F.2d at 1366. The court noted “that a serious\ncrime against a child is an offense against that family[’s] har-\nmony and to society as well.” Id. The court also discussed that\na vast majority of child abuse cases involve “a parent or par-\nent substitute” as the perpetrator. Id.\n\n   [7] Given that the bond between marital partners and the\nfunctional equivalent of their children would be nearly identi-\ncal to that between marital partners and their birth or step-\nchildren, the harm to family harmony and society would be\nthe equivalent of that noted in Allery. See id. Indeed, of the\nnine states within the Ninth Circuit, seven recognize a marital\ncommunications privilege exception including the functional\nequivalent of birth children or a somewhat broader concept.2\n  2\n    The states with such an exception are Alaska (Daniels v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1396939\"><a href=\"/opinion/1396939/daniels-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 345 (Alaska Ct.

BANKS                        2235\nConsidering the comparable familial ties, we conclude that\nviolence against the functional equivalent of a child should be\nafforded the same protections as violence against the birth or\nstep-child of a married couple.3\n\n  The question remains, however, whether the district court\ncorrectly concluded that the minor child in this case was the\nfunctional equivalent of a birth or step-child. The district\ncourt’s conclusion was based on the following findings:\n\n        that JB, the alleged victim, was the grandchild of\n     both the witness, Mrs. Banks, and the defendant, Mr.\n     Banks; that the witness and the defendant were mar-\n     ried and co-habitating at the time of the communica-\n     tion; that JB was in the care, joint care of Mrs. Banks\n     and the defendant at the time of the alleged molesta-\n     tion; that JB was specifically being cared for by the\n     defendant at the time of the alleged molestation; that\n     at least during the two-month period prior to the\n     alleged molestation that JB had been left in the joint\n\nIdaho (Idaho Code Ann. § 9-203(1)) (precluding use of the privilege in\n“any case of physical injury to a child where the injury has been caused\nas a result of physical abuse or neglect by one or both of the parents” and\n“any case of lewd and lascivious conduct or attempted lewd and lascivious\nconduct where either party would otherwise be protected by this privi-\nlege”); Nevada (Nev. Rev. Stat. § 49.295(2)(e)(1)) (excluding crimes com-\nmitted against “a child in the custody or control of either” spouse); and\nWashington (Wash. Rev. Code § 5.60.060(1)) (precluding use of the privi-\nlege in a “proceeding for a crime committed by said spouse or domestic\npartner against any child of whom said spouse or domestic partner is the\nparent or guardian”).\n   3\n     We decline to follow the path taken in United States v. Bahe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"155555\"><a href=\"/opinion/155555/united-states-v-bahe/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1440</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1446 (10th Cir. 1997), extending the exception to testimony relating\nto the abuse of any minor child in the marital household, whether residing\nthere or visiting. No other circuit has adopted such a broad exemption to\nthe federal marital communications privilege. In fact, such an exception\nwould be broader than that adopted by the majority of states within the\nNinth Circuit.\n\f2236                UNITED STATES v. BANKS\n    care of the defendant and Mrs. Banks for two week-\n    ends beginning on Friday evening and ending Satur-\n    day afternoon; that the parents, i.e., Mr. and Mrs.\n    Banks’ son and their daughter-in-law, were not pres-\n    ent during those times when JB was in the care of\n    the defendant and his wife.\n\n       Further, during the approximate two years of JB’s\n    life preceding that time, for the first six months he\n    had lived with Mr. and Mrs. Banks. And during that\n    time, the parents also lived with Mr. and Mrs. Banks,\n    but Mrs. Banks on occasion would feed, bathe,\n    clothe, and change the diapers of JB on many occa-\n    sions. After that three-month — or after that six-\n    month period, the times in which JB was in Mr. and\n    Mrs. Banks’s care was very infrequent until April of\n    2005. But the parents started leaving JB in the care\n    of Mr. and Mrs. Banks from the time he was about\n    one and one half years old but not usually overnight\n    until April of 2005.\n\n   [8] Although these facts demonstrate a strong bond\nbetween the victim and his grandparents, they do not show the\ntype of relationship that would be considered the functional\nequivalent of a birth or step-child’s relationship with his par-\nents. Infrequent overnight visits are common to a large por-\ntion of grandparent/grandchild relationships, as are frequent\nvisits with or even regular day-care services provided by the\ngrandparents. This type of care, while admirable and impor-\ntant, does not carry the same indicia of guardianship and\nresponsibility that a parent/child relationship carries. Further,\nwhile the district court noted that JB had resided with the\nBanks for the first six months of his life, it is an important\nqualifier that his parents had also resided in the home and that\nthis living situation had ended well over a year before the\nalleged molestation.\n\n  [9] This is not a case in which a child was raised by grand-\nparents and, therefore, could be said to share a parent/child\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS                  2237\nrelationship with those caretakers. Rather, this situation dem-\nonstrates a strong grandparent/grandchild relationship.\nAlthough such a relationship is important to building strong\nextended families and improving society, it is not the type that\ncreates the same overriding policy concerns that led us to\nlimit the marital communications privilege to protect children\nof the marriage.\n\n   [10] Accordingly, the district court’s admission of Mrs.\nBanks’s testimony was an abuse of discretion because the dis-\ntrict court’s finding that JB was the functional equivalent of\na birth child to Banks and his wife was clearly erroneous\nunder these facts. See Shafer, 518 F.3d at 1070 (“A district\ncourt abuses its discretion if it ‘bases its ruling on an errone-\nous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of\nthe evidence.’ ” (citation and alteration omitted)).\n\n   Our dissenting colleague accuses the majority of “neglect[-\ning] its duty pursuant to Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evi-\ndence . . .” Dissenting Opinion, p. 2246. To the contrary, it\nis the dissenting opinion that strays from the dictates of Rule\n501 by incorporating wholesale state law statutory privileges\ninto its analysis.\n\n   Rule 501 provides in pertinent part: “[T]he privilege of a\nwitness . . . shall be governed by the principles of the com-\nmon law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the\nUnited States . . .” Fed. R. of Evid. 501 (emphasis added). In\nkeeping with Rule 501’s emphasis on federal common law,\nthe court in Allery recognized that “[f]ederal courts may . . .\nlook to the privileges created by state courts and applicable\nstate statutes if the court finds them appropriate.” Allery, 526\nF.2d at 1365 (emphases added). No deference to state law is\nmentioned or implied.\n\n   More importantly, the court in Allery noted that proposed\nrules of privilege “adopted by the United States Supreme\nCourt and sent to Congress for approval . . . [were] abandoned\n\f2238                UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nby Congress and [were] replaced by Rule 501.” Id. at 1366\n(footnote reference omitted).\n\n   In Allery, the court explained that “[a] careful review of the\nlegislative history behind the rejection of the changes pro-\nposed in Article V and the passage of Rule 501 does not indi-\ncate that Congress disapproved of the expansion of this\nexception but rather that any substantive changes should be\ndone on a case-by-case basis.” Id. (citation omitted).\n\n  Rather than resolving this case on these facts, the dissent\nseeks to make a sweeping ruling that the marital privilege is\nwaived for all grandparents for all time for all circumstances,\nwhenever a charge of sexual abuse of a minor is involved.\nAlthough the majority recognizes the abhorrent nature of\nchild sexual abuse, we must nevertheless faithfully apply our\nprecedent.\n\n   Our governing precedent on this issue is our opinion in\nWhite, which cited Allery with approval. See White, 974 F.2d\nat 1138. In White, we concluded that the common law “mari-\ntal communications privilege should not apply to statements\nrelating to a crime where a spouse or spouse’s children are the\nvictims.”\n\n   The dissent seeks to extend this holding virtually without\nlimitation. See Dissenting Opinion, p. 2256-57. In doing so,\nthe dissent goes far beyond the approach taken by the district\ncourt. It is apparent from the district court’s factual findings\nthat its ruling was predicated upon a determination that the\ngrandparents in this case were the functional equivalents of\nparents. Indeed, the district court expressly reasoned that this\ncase was “not even a small step from what the court ruled in\nWhite. It is almost exactly the same.” In this particular case,\nunder these particular facts, we disagree. Perhaps our holding\nwould be different if the grandparents were the primary care-\ngivers. But such was not the case. Rather, the grandparents\nwere occasional caregivers. As discussed above, and as Rule\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. BANKS                          2239\n501 contemplates, a case-by-case application of the marital\ncommunications privilege as interpreted by our court, leads\nthe majority to conclude that the exception did not apply in\nthis case.4\n\n   [11] Nevertheless, evidence improperly admitted under the\nmarital communications privilege warrants reversal only if it\naffected the defendant’s substantial rights. Marashi, 913 F.2d\nat 729. The error here was harmless as it related to the issue\nof Banks’s identity. In fact, the district court’s finding that\nBanks created the video made no mention of Banks’s confes-\nsion to his wife. Rather, the court focused on the multitude of\nevidence supporting the conclusion that Banks made the\nvideo. This evidence included the recognition of Banks’s\nwatch and ring on the adult in the video; the recognition of a\ncouch in the video that was owned by Banks and kept in his\ngarage; testimony that Banks had been found in his locked\ngarage, alone with the victim, and had admitted to changing\nthe child’s diaper; and testimony that Banks had been left\nalone with the child. This evidence demonstrated beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the video was made in Banks’s garage\nand that Banks had been involved in the making of the video.\nWe are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the district\ncourt would have found that Banks made the video, even\nwithout the improperly admitted statement.\n\n  Any error was also harmless as it related to the district\ncourt’s finding that the video constituted sexually explicit\nconduct. Although the district court did discuss the competing\n  4\n    The dissent quotes at length from the district court’s reasoning to sup-\nport the argument that the marital privilege exception should be expanded.\nDissenting Opinion, pp. 2270-72. It is notable that the portions quoted by\nthe dissent anchor the district court’s reasoning to our precedent, White,\nrather than to Idaho law or any other state statutory or case authority.\nAlthough the district court referenced state law generally, it did not seek\nto incorporate state law into its analysis, and rightfully so. See Allery, 526\nF.2d at 1366 (cautioning against expansion of the marital privileges excep-\ntion on any basis other than “case-by-case.”).\n\f2240                 UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nmotives for making the video that were adduced at trial, the\nfinding that the video constituted sexually explicit conduct\nwas based on the actions taken in the video and Banks’s later\ntransmission of that video to a known pedophile with com-\nments suggesting that the video was intended to show the\nchild’s erection. See United States v. Freeman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1290043\"><a href=\"/opinion/1290043/united-states-v-freeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n901 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding error harmless when “it is more\nprobable than not that the error did not materially affect the\nverdict”) (citation omitted).\n\n   Banks argues that admission of the testimony constituted\nreversible error because he was required to change his trial\nstrategy to explain his prior criminal history. However, there\nis no indication in the record that the district court relied at all\non Banks’s prior criminal history in reaching its guilty ver-\ndict, rendering any error harmless. See id.\n\n   [12] In sum, although the district court abused its discretion\nin admitting the contested testimony, such error was harmless\nand does not warrant reversal.\n\n  D.   The district court’s definition and finding of\n       masturbation were not erroneous.\n\n   The district court conscientiously crafted a definition of\nmasturbation. It first noted the fact that no statutory definition\nexists, before recounting a dictionary definition of masturba-\ntion that included the exciting of another’s genitals by manual\ncontact. Rejecting the government’s assertion that masturba-\ntion may be found if the act were done solely “for the purpose\nof exciting the person performing the act,” the court con-\ncluded that the act must be “for the purpose of exciting the\nperson being masturbated.”\n\n   The court next turned to the problem that this definition\ncreated when it came to the masturbation of a minor child\nwho might not be able to be stimulated by the action. The dis-\ntrict court concluded that Congress intended masturbation to\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. BANKS                 2241\ninclude “the stimulation, manipulation, or excitation of the\ngenital organs for purposes of exciting or stimulating the per-\nson being masturbated if that person was an adult.”\n\n   Banks argues that this definition impermissibly conflicts\nwith the district court’s later definition of lasciviousness\nbecause it considers the intent of the individual masturbating\nthe minor child while the definition of lascivious considers\nthe response intended in the person viewing the image. As\ndiscussed below, the definition of masturbation provided by\nthe district court does not impermissibly contradict that given\nfor lasciviousness. The catch-all nature of the term lascivious\nallows for the recognition that certain acts, because of their\ninherent sexual nature, can satisfy both lasciviousness and\nanother more specific sexual act.\n\n    In interpreting a statute, we “must begin with the language\nof the statute itself.” Bowsher v.

Webster’s Third New International\nDictionary similarly defines masturbation as “erotic stimula-\ntion involving the genital organs commonly resulting in\n\f2242               UNITED STATES v. BANKS\norgasm and achieved by manual or other bodily contact exclu-\nsive of sexual intercourse . . .” Webster’s Third New Interna-\ntional Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 1391\n(1986).\n\n   Each definition focuses primarily on the “erotic” stimula-\ntion of one’s genitals. Despite noting that an orgasm is com-\nmonly reached or intended, neither definition requires that an\norgasm occur or even be possible. The district court’s defini-\ntion recognizes this aspect of masturbation in the difficult\ncontext of contact with a child too young to have a sexual\nresponse to the physical contact.\n\n   The subject video depicts the minor child having his diaper\nchanged. Using a diaper wipe, Banks touched, rubbed and\nheld the child’s penis. Banks also massaged the child’s scro-\ntum and anus, and the time spent wiping the child’s anus\nappears prolonged. These actions were taken at a point in the\ndiaper-changing where it could reasonably be concluded that\nthey were extraneous. Indeed, after the cleaning process\nappeared complete, Banks exited the screen and returned two\nmore times with new wipes and continued touching the child.\nIn addition, messages between Banks and the Canadian\npedophile demonstrated that Banks represented the video as\ndepicting the child’s erection.\n\n   [13] This evidence supports the district court’s conclusion\nthat the minor child’s genitals were stimulated for the purpose\nof producing a video for Banks to share with his fellow\npedophile in Canada. Such an action would fit the definition\nof masturbation described above. Accordingly, the district\ncourt did not clearly err in concluding that the video depicts\nmasturbation and, ultimately, sexually explicit conduct. See\nLeos-Maldonado, 302 F.3d at 1063 (reviewing the district\ncourt’s findings of fact for clear error).\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. BANKS                       2243\n  E.     The district court’s definition and             finding      of\n         lasciviousness were not erroneous.\n\n   The district court did not provide an explicit definition of\nlascivious when discussing whether the video constituted las-\ncivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of the minor\nchild. However, the court did note the following:\n\n           An additional factor that I think could be added to\n       the Dost factors would be the fondling of a child.\n       And fondling is broader than masturbation. If the\n       government has proved masturbation, in my view it\n       has also proved the fondling of the child. And it was\n       for the purpose of eliciting in the viewer a sexual\n       response. And so the court finds that this image also\n       . . . constitutes a lascivious exhibition of the genitals\n       or pubic area of the child. . . . [I]t was created for the\n       purpose of exciting Mr. Lindstrom and for the pur-\n       pose of appealing to his prurient pedophilia [sic]\n       interests.\n\n  Banks attacks this reasoning, complaining that the district\ncourt improperly folded the definition of masturbation into the\ndefinition of lasciviousness.\n\n   In the context of images involving children, the term “las-\ncivious” has been fairly well defined. A lascivious exhibition\nis pornographic, even if not obscene, and is considered in the\ncontext of “the depictions . . . imposed . . . by the attitude of\nthe viewer or photographer.” United States v. Arvin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539928\"><a href=\"/opinion/539928/united-states-v-michael-arvin/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1385</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1391 (9th Cir. 1990). Accordingly, “applied to the con-\nduct of children, lasciviousness is not a characteristic of the\nchild photographed but of the exhibition which the photogra-\npher sets up for an audience that consists of himself or\nlikeminded pedophiles.” United States v. Wiegand, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483889\"><a href=\"/opinion/483889/united-states-v-edwin-e-wiegand/\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1239</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1244 (9th Cir. 1987). This focus results in a definition\nof lascivious that criminalizes images “so presented by the\n\f2244                       UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nphotographer as to arouse or satisfy the sexual cravings of a\nvoyeur.” Hill, 459 F.3d at 972 (citation omitted).\n\n   The district court’s definition did not run afoul of this rec-\nognized definition of lascivious. The court’s definition of\nmasturbation required a finding that the contact with the\nminor’s genitalia was of the type that would produce a sexual\nresponse in an adult. The court’s discussion of lascivious dis-\nplayed an awareness by the court that there must be an intent\non the part of the photographer or viewer to satisfy a sexual\ndesire through the image. Although the distinction between\nthe terms is subtle, it nevertheless exists: masturbation\nfocuses on the effect on the victim and lasciviousness focuses\non the effect on the pedophile.\n\n   [14] The district court’s factual determination that the video\nencompassed the lascivious exhibition of the minor child’s\ngenitals was predicated on the court’s conclusion that the\nvideo depicted the masturbation of the minor child. Banks\ncounters that the video’s display of a diaper change and its\nfailure to meet many of the factors articulated in United States\nv. Dost, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1757784\"><a href=\"/opinion/1757784/united-states-v-dost/\"><span class=\"volume\">636</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Cal. 1986),5 preclude a factual\nfinding that the video contains a lascivious exhibition of the\nminor child’s genitals. However, the Dost factors “are neither\nexclusive nor conclusive” because “a determination of lascivi-\nousness has to be made based on the overall content of the\nvisual depiction.” Hill, 459 F.3d at 972 (citation, alteration\nand internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the dis-\n  5\n    The Dost factors are six considerations that judges may use as “a start-\ning point . . . in determining whether a particular image is likely [to be las-\ncivious].” Hill, 459 F.3d at 972. The six factors are “(1) whether the focal\npoint . . . is on the child’s genitalia . . . ; (2) whether the setting . . . is sexu-\nally suggestive . . . ; (3) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose,\nor in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child; (4) whether the\nchild is fully or partially clothed, or nude; (5) whether the visual depiction\nsuggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity;\n[and] (6) whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a\nsexual response in the viewer.” Id. at 971 (citations omitted).\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS                   2245\ntrict court’s failure to consider the factors explicitly, or to\ncomment on the diaper-change setting of the video, is not dis-\npositive. Rather, because the district court did not err in deter-\nmining that the video depicted the masturbation of a minor\nchild and because the recording of such an act constitutes the\nlascivious exhibition of the child’s genitals, the court did not\nerr in concluding that the video contains a lascivious exhibi-\ntion of a minor child’s genitals.\n\n                               IV.\n\n             SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\n   Despite Banks’s objections, we hold that the search warrant\nissued in this case was adequately supported and sufficiently\nspecific. Further, although the district court erred by overex-\ntending the exceptions to the marital communications privi-\nlege, the error was harmless in this case. Finally, the district\ncourt’s definitions and findings regarding the terms “mastur-\nbation” and “lascivious” appropriately captured the require-\nments for each term as they related to the charges brought and\ndid not impermissibly conflict with each other. Accordingly,\nwe conclude that reversal of Banks’s conviction is not war-\nranted and affirm his conviction.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nALARCÓN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\nin part:\n\n   I concur in the majority’s conclusion that the district court\ndid not err in denying Banks’s motion to suppress the evi-\ndence seized pursuant to a search warrant, and in defining and\napplying the terms “masturbation” and “lascivious.” I respect-\nfully dissent from the majority’s holding that the district court\nabused its discretion in admitting the testimony of Banks’s\n\f2246                     UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nspouse that he told her he produced a video for distribution on\nthe internet to other pedophiles that depicts him masturbating\ntheir two-year-old grandchild. I would affirm that ruling.\n\n   I am persuaded that the majority has erred in holding that\nthe law of this Circuit precludes us from deciding a question\nit has not previously considered, i.e., whether the marital\ncommunications privilege is applicable to the voluntary testi-\nmony of a spouse concerning the statements of an accused\nthat connect him to the sexual abuse of their grandchild. In so\nholding, the majority has neglected its duty pursuant to Rule\n501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence to decide questions\ninvolving the applicability of the marital communications\nprivilege on a case-by-case basis “in light of reason and experi-\nence.”1 The majority’s remarkable finding that a grandchild is\nnot the “functional equivalent of a birth or step-child,”\n(Majority Opinion at 2235) will surely come as a complete\nsurprise to grandparents.\n\n                                      I\n\n   The majority has determined that “[o]ur governing prece-\ndent” in determining whether the marital communications\nprivilege should apply to an accused’s admission to his\nspouse of committing a crime against their grandchild is\nUnited States v.

Major-\n  1\n   Rule 501 reads as follows:\n      Except as otherwise required by the Constitution of the United\n      States or provided by Act of Congress or in rules prescribed by\n      the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority, the privilege\n      of a witness, person, government, State, or political subdivision\n      thereof shall be governed by the principles of the common law\n      as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in\n      the light of reason and experience. However, in civil actions and\n      proceedings, with respect to an element of a claim or defense as\n      to which State law supplies the rule of decision, the privilege of\n      a witness, person, government, State, or political subdivision\n      thereof shall be determined in accordance with State law.\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS                   2247\nity Opinion at 2238. That issue was not before this court in\nWhite. Instead, this court addressed a discrete question in\nWhite, i.e., whether the district court abused its discretion in\nadmitting the testimony of a spouse that the accused had\nthreatened to kill her and her daughter. White, 974 F.2d at\n1137.\n\n In affirming the trial court’s ruling that the spouse’s testi-\nmony was admissible, we reasoned as follows:\n\n    This court has counseled that the marital communi-\n    cations privilege must be narrowly construed\n    because it obstructs the truth seeking process. Use of\n    the privilege in criminal proceedings requires a par-\n    ticularly narrow construction because of society’s\n    strong interest in the administration of justice. The\n    public policy interests in protecting the integrity of\n    marriages and ensuring that spouses freely commu-\n    nicate with one another underlie the marital commu-\n    nications privilege. When balancing these interests\n    we find that threats against spouses and a spouse’s\n    children do not further the purposes of the privilege\n    and that the public interest in the administration of\n    justice outweighs any possible purpose the privilege\n    serves in such a case.\n\nId. at 1138 (quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n   This court did not hold in White that the marital communi-\ncations privilege should not apply to an admission by the\naccused to his or her spouse that he or she had sexually\nabused their grandchild. Without citation to any relevant lan-\nguage in White, the majority has erroneously construed that\ndecision to limit the exception to the marital communications\nprivilege in prosecutions for crimes against children to state-\nments made by “the functional equivalents of parents.”\nMajority Opinion at 2238. Our holding in White was limited\nas follows: a trial court can properly balance the admission of\n\f2248                   UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nthe voluntary testimony of a spouse, regarding the threats by\nthe accused to harm a stepchild, against the privilege that\ncommunications between spouses should be treated as confi-\ndential and inadmissible in a criminal proceeding to maintain\nmarital harmony. White, 974 F.2d at 1138.\n\n   We held in White that the critical question in determining\nif the marital communications privilege should apply is\nwhether or not the conduct is “inconsistent with the purposes\nof the marital communications privilege: promoting confiden-\ntial communications between spouses in order to foster mari-\ntal harmony.” Id. Obviously, an admission to a spouse by the\naccused that he produced a video for distribution on the inter-\nnet depicting his masturbation of their grandchild to other\npedophiles would destroy the harmonious relationship of mar-\nital partners.\n\n   Indeed, the impact of Banks’s admission that he abused\ntheir grandchild must have been emotionally devastating to\nhis wife in view of her knowledge that “the [grand]child in\nquestion [was] the son of the very person [Banks] plead guilty\nto molesting and going to prison for in 1990.” Transcript of\nRecord at 371, United States v.

United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93442\"><a href=\"/opinion/93442/benson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1892). In Benson, the government called\nas a witness a codefendant whose trial had been severed from\nthat of the accused. Benson, 146 U.S. at 335. Precedent\nappeared to require that the court declare the codefendant was\nnot competent. Id. at 336 (“It is familiar knowledge that the\nold common law carefully excluded from the witness stand\nparties to the record, and those who were interested in the\nresult; and this rule extended to both civil and criminal\ncases.”) In Benson, the Supreme Court held that it was not\n“precluded by [precedent] from examining this question in the\nlight of general authority and sound reason.” Benson, 146\nU.S. at 335. In reviewing the historical grounds for excluding\na codefendent from testifying, the Supreme Court explained\nthat\n\n    [t]he courts were afraid to trust the intelligence of\n    jurors. But the last fifty years have wrought a great\n    change in these respects, and today the tendency is\n    to enlarge the domain of competency and to submit\n    to the jury for their consideration as to the credibility\n    of the witness those matters which heretofore were\n    ruled sufficient to justify his exclusion. This change\n    has been wrought partially by legislation and par-\n    tially by judicial construction.\n\nId. at 336.\n\n   Thus, because traditional reasons for holding a codefendant\nincompetent to testify against an accused were no longer\ndeemed sound, the Court revised the rule, supporting its con-\nclusion by citing a trend toward a rule against incompetency.\nId. at 337 (“Legislation of similar import prevails in most of\n\f2250                UNITED STATES v. BANKS\nthe States. The spirit of this legislation has controlled the\ndecisions of the courts . . .”).\n\n   In Funk, the Supreme Court overturned the rule prohibiting\nspousal testimony in federal criminal trials. Funk, 290 U.S. at\n387 (overruling, in part, Hendrix v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97335\"><a href=\"/opinion/97335/hendrix-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1911) and Jin Fuey Moy v.

Citing Benson, the Supreme Court in Funk rejected\nthe notion “that the courts, in the face of greatly changed con-\nditions, are still chained to the ancient formulae and are pow-\nerless to declare and enforce modifications deemed to have\nbeen wrought in the common law itself by force of these\nchanged conditions.” Funk, 290 U.S. at 379. Instead, the\nCourt held that the question should be “disposed of . . . in the\nlight of general authority and sound reason.” Id. at 380.\nReviewing the early, common law rule that a spouse was\nincompetent to testify for an accused spouse, in Funk the\nCourt reasoned as follows:\n\n    The fundamental basis upon which all rules of evi-\n    dence must rest — if they are to rest upon reason —\n    is their adaptation to the successful development of\n    the truth. And since experience is of all teachers the\n    most dependable, and since experience also is a con-\n    tinuous process, it follows that a rule of evidence at\n    one time thought necessary to the ascertainment of\n    truth should yield to the experience of a succeeding\n    generation whenever that experience has clearly\n    demonstrated the fallacy or unwisdom of the old\n    rule.\n\nId. at 381. The Court further explained that\n\n    the exclusion of the wife’s testimony, in the face of\n    the broad and liberal extension of the rules in respect\n    of the competency of witnesses generally, [can no\n    longer be] justified, if it ever was justified, on any\n    ground of public policy. It has been said that to\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. BANKS                      2251\n      admit such testimony is against public policy\n      because it would endanger the harmony and confi-\n      dence of marital relations, and, moreover, would\n      subject the witness to the temptation to commit per-\n      jury. Modern legislation, in making either spouse\n      competent to testify in behalf of the other in criminal\n      cases, has definitely rejected these notions, and in\n      the light of such legislation and of modern thought\n      they seem to be altogether fanciful. The public pol-\n      icy of one generation may not, under changed condi-\n      tions, be the public policy of another.\n\nId. (citing Patton v.

The\nexamination of “general authority” as described in Funk, thus\nevolved into an assessment of “experience” in Wolfle.

The Court noted in Trammel that\n\n    [w]hen one spouse is willing to testify against the\n    other in a criminal proceeding — whatever the moti-\n    vation — their relationship is almost certainly in dis-\n    repair; there is probably little in the way of marital\n    harmony for the privilege to preserve. In these cir-\n    cumstances, a rule of evidence that permits the\n    accused to prevent adverse spousal testimony seems\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. BANKS                        2253\n      far more likely to frustrate justice than to foster fam-\n      ily peace.\n\nId. at 52 (emphasis added).4\n\n   The courts’ intent to foster evolution in the area of testimo-\nnial privilege was reinforced more recently in Jaffee. In Jaf-\nfee, the Supreme Court held, for the first time, that\ncommunications within the psychotherapist-patient relation-\nship are privileged. Jaffee, 518 U.S. at 8-9. In recognizing the\nnew testimonial privilege, the Court insisted that reliance\nupon laws enacted by state legislatures should be used as a\nmodel for developing the common law of privilege pursuant\nto Rule 501 is entirely “appropriate.” See id. at 13 (“In Funk\nv. United States, we recognized that it is appropriate to treat\na consistent body of policy determinations by state legisla-\ntures as reflecting both ‘reason’ and ‘experience.’ ”) (citation\nomitted). The Court explained\n\n      [t]hat it is appropriate for the federal courts to recog-\n      nize a psychotherapist privilege under Rule 501 is\n      confirmed by the fact that all 50 States and the Dis-\n      trict of Columbia have enacted into law some form\n      of psychotherapist privilege. We have previously\n      observed that the policy decisions of the States bear\n      on the question whether federal courts should recog-\n      nize a new privilege or amend the coverage of an\n      existing one.\n\nId. at 12 (citing Trammel, 445 U.S. at 48-50; United States v.\nGillock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110226\"><a href=\"/opinion/110226/united-states-v-gillock/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 368, n. 8 (1980)).\n\n   The Court reasoned in Jaffee that “[b]ecause state legisla-\ntures are fully aware of the need to protect the integrity of the\nfactfinding functions of their courts, the existence of a con-\n  4\n   The majority has failed to cite Trammel or discuss its duty not to freeze\nthe law of privilege.\n\f2254                UNITED STATES v.

The Court also noted that “[i]t is of no consequence that\nrecognition of the privilege in the vast majority of states is the\nproduct of legislative action rather than judicial decision.” Id.\n“The present unanimous acceptance of the privilege” by “state\nlawmakers” is persuasive proof of a solid social “consensus”\nthat the psychotherapist-patient relationship merits the protec-\ntion of an evidentiary privilege. Id. Thus, the stated policy\nunderlying Rule 501 is served by consideration not only of\nstate case law, but also laws enacted by the states in develop-\ning the law of privilege. The majority has failed to look to\nlaws enacted by Idaho and other states that permit a spouse\nto testify regarding a spouse’s admission in a state prosecu-\ntion concerning sexual abuse of a minor child.\n\n                                A\n\n   The two primary assumptions underlying the recognition of\ntestimonial privileges as articulated by the Court in Jaffee are\nthat\n\n    there is a general duty to give what testimony one is\n    capable of giving, and, any exceptions which may\n    exist are distinctly exceptional, being so many dero-\n    gations from a positive general rule.

Law Ann. ch.\n233, § 20 was inapplicable when the alleged victim was not\na child of either spouse and did not live with them. Id. The\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts disagreed. Section\n20 provides that “except in any proceeding relating to child\nabuse, including incest, neither husband nor wife shall be\nrequired to testify in the trial of an indictment, complaint or\nother criminal proceeding against the other.” Mass. Gen. Law\nAnn. ch. 233, § 20. The Supreme Judicial Court interpreted\nthe statute as follows:\n\n    We see no logical reason for the Legislature to deny\n    the spousal privilege when a young victim of abuse\n    is a child of one or both spouses (or other child\n    closely related by consanguinity) but to perpetuate\n    the privilege when the young victim is related to nei-\n    ther spouse. The abuse is the same. Society’s interest\n\f2260                UNITED STATES v. BANKS\n    in convicting and punishing one who commits child\n    abuse is the same. The threat to the preservation of\n    the family unit arising from one spouse being com-\n    pelled to testify against the other seems substantially\n    identical in all instances. Indeed, if the defendant’s\n    alleged child abuse was not incestuous, the spouse’s\n    compelled testimony might be less threatening to the\n    marriage than if she were compelled to testify, as the\n    wife and defendant agree she must, concerning\n    incestuous child abuse, which involves an even\n    greater stigma than child abuse alone. The criminal\n    conduct asserted in this case, abuse of the victim in\n    the defendant’s home, shows that the need for the\n    testimony of a defendant’s spouse may be as great as\n    it would be if the alleged victim were their own\n    child. We choose to apply the literal meaning of the\n    words “child abuse” to § 20, cl. Second.

The court explained its ruling as follows:\n\n    This Court has recognized that the sexual abuse of\n    children not only traumatizes the victims, but also\n    exacts a heavy toll on society: Recent research indi-\n    cates that a number of psychosocial problems—\n    including chronic depression and anxiety, isolation\n    and poor social adjustment, substance abuse, suicidal\n    behavior, and involvement in physically or sexually\n    abusive relationships as either aggressor or victim—\n    are more common among adults molested as chil-\n\f2262                   UNITED STATES v. BANKS\n      dren than among those with no such childhood expe-\n      riences. Victims of sexual abuse can suffer an\n      impaired ability to critically evaluate the motives\n      and behavior of others, making them more vulnera-\n      ble to revictimization. An especially disturbing find-\n      ing about child sexual abuse is its strong\n      intergenerational pattern; in particular, due to the\n      psychological impact of their own abuse, sexually\n      abused boys have been found to be more likely than\n      non-abused boys to turn into offenders against the\n      next generation of children, and sexually abused\n      girls are more likely to become mothers of children\n      who are abused. And studies show that adult male\n      aggressive behavior, particularly sexual aggression,\n      is associated with the trauma of childhood sexual\n      abuse. Thus, apart from the substantial personal\n      trauma caused to the victims of such crimes, sexual\n      crimes against children exact heavy social costs as\n      well.\n\nId.

The court stated that:\n\n    Even if it is assumed that the [statutory exceptions to\n    the marital communications privilege specifically\n    addressing child abuse do] not act directly to provide\n    a broad child abuse “exception” to [the application\n    of Pennsylvania’s marital communications privilege]\n    in criminal proceedings, it certainly affects what a\n    spouse’s “reasonable expectation” of continued con-\n    fidentiality may be with respect to marital communi-\n    cations that reveal the previous or intended abuse\n    and intimidation of a child.\n\nId. at 42.

The majority has failed\nto explain, however, why it has ignored the fact that Idaho,\nand many other states, have adopted an exception to the mari-\ntal communications privilege in prosecutions for crimes\nagainst children. The majority has also failed to consider or\nexplain the paradoxical impact on the public’s perception of\nthe rule of law that will result from the fact that an accused’s\nadmissions of the abuse of any child are admissible in most\nstate courts, but cannot be presented into evidence in the fed-\neral court across the street.\n\n   Most of the states within the Ninth Circuit have adopted\nlaws that extend the marital communications exception\nbeyond our holding in White. Indeed, Arizona, Idaho, Nevada,\nand Oregon have eliminated the privilege entirely where the\ncommunication relates to a crime against any child while in\nthe custody or control of either spouse. See Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. §§ 13-4062 & 13-604 (eliminating the privilege in cases\ninvolving any “dangerous crime against children” and\n“[s]exual conduct with a minor under fifteen years of age”);\nIdaho Code Ann. §9-203 (precluding use of the privilege in\n“any case of physical injury to a child where the injury has\nbeen cause as a result of physical abuse or neglect by one or\nboth of the parents” and “any case of lewd and lascivious con-\nduct or attempted lewd and lascivious conduct where either\nparty would otherwise be protected by this privilege”); Nev.\n\f                     UNITED STATES v.

Stat. § 419B.040 (“the husband-\nwife privilege, shall not be a ground for excluding evidence\nregarding a child’s abuse, or the cause thereof, in any judicial\nproceeding”).\n\n   The Washington legislature has created an exception to the\nprivilege where either spouse or domestic partner is consid-\nered the parent or guardian of a child victim. Wash. Rev.\nCode. § 5.60.060(a) (2007). The Supreme Court of Washing-\nton held in State v. Waleczek, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2615998\"><a href=\"/opinion/2615998/state-v-waleczek/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978) that a\nhusband and wife who hosted a seven-year-old girl for an\novernight sleepover (during the course of which she was sex-\nually assaulted), were considered “guardians” under Wash.\nRev. Code § 5.60.060(1). Waleczek, 90 Wn.2d at 753. In\nWaleczek, the court explained:\n\n      Defendant and his wife voluntarily undertook duties\n      that are normally characterized as parental: They\n      agreed to let Theraesa sleep at their house, wake her\n      up in the morning, provide her with breakfast, and\n      make sure she went to school. In addition, we have\n      no doubt that Theraesa, being only 7 years old,\n      would trust, respect, and obey defendant and his wife\n      principally because she had been left in their care by\n      her own mother.\n\nId.\n\n   In California, the legislature has created an exception to the\nmarital communications privilege when a spouse is charged\nwith “[a] crime against the person or property of the other\nspouse or of a child, parent, relative, or cohabitant of either.”\nCal. Evid. Code § 972(c)(1) (emphasis added). Hawaii has\neliminated the privilege “in proceedings in which one spouse\nis charged with a crime against . . . a third person residing in\nthe household.” Haw. R. Evid. 505(c)(1)(C).\n\f2270                UNITED STATES v. BANKS\n    The statutes in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon have\nunambiguously eliminated the privilege entirely where the\ncommunication relates to a crime against any child while in\nthe custody or control of either spouse. The majority has\nfailed utterly to discuss the impact of state-created exceptions\nto the marital communications privileges or “recognize state\nprivileges where this can be accomplished at no substantial\ncost to federal substantive and procedural policy.” Shadur,\n664 F.2d at 106. In declining to consider the evolutionary\ndevelopment of the law throughout the United States rejecting\nthe marital communications privilege where the victim of a\nspouse’s crime is their grandchild, the majority has cobbled\ntogether an amorphous standard that limits the exception to\nthe functional equivalent of a child or stepchild. This unde-\nfined concept will no doubt baffle anyone who tries to apply\nit.\n\n                       CONCLUSION\n\n   In explaining its reasons for admitting the testimony of\nBanks’s spouse concerning his admission that he produced the\nvideo depicting the crime Banks committed against his grand-\nchild, the district court, unlike the majority in this matter,\nscrupulously fulfilled its duty to apply Rule 501 as interpreted\nby the Supreme Court in Trammel. The district court reasoned\nas follows:\n\n    The question then is under those relevant facts, does\n    the exception to the marital communications privi-\n    lege apply? And does the court extend or interpret\n    the Ninth Circuit’s decision in White to apply to\n    those circumstances? In making that determination,\n    you have to look to the reasons for the privilege.\n    And the reasons for the privilege are discussed by\n    the Ninth Circuit in White.\n\n    First of all, the Ninth Circuit cautions us that the\n    privilege must be narrowly construed because it\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. BANKS                     2271\n    obstructs the truth seeking process. And they say the\n    use of the privilege in criminal proceedings requires\n    a particularly narrow construction because of soci-\n    ety’s strong interest in the administration of justice.\n\n    The public policy reasons for the privilege are to\n    protect the integrity of marriages and insure that\n    spouses are able to freely communicate with each\n    other. There has to be somebody that you can go to\n    to bear your soul. But the privilege says if it isn’t\n    your priest, if it isn’t your lawyer, it’s your spouse.\n\n    But when you balance the interests involved, the\n    court in White found that threats against the spouse\n    or the spouse’s children don’t further the purposes of\n    the privilege. Likewise, abuse of the spouse or abuse\n    of the spouses’ children don’t further the privilege.\n    It doesn’t further the privilege to allow someone to\n    talk about abusing the spouse or the spouse’s chil-\n    dren with impunity. It doesn’t further the sanctity of\n    the marriage or the family relationship.\n\n    Well, when you have grandchildren who under the\n    facts of this case have that kind of relationship to the\n    grandparents, it is not even a small step from what\n    the court ruled in White. It is almost exactly the\n    same.\n\nTranscript of Record at 501-02, Banks, Case No. 1:06-CR-\n00051-S-BLW-WBS.\n\n   The district court also noted “that in determining the princi-\nples of the common law as they are interpreted in the courts\nof the United States in light of reason and experience, the\ncourt looks to the state laws of not just Idaho but other states\nfor the reasoning in those decisions and statutes and the expe-\nrience in those states.” Id.\n\f2272               UNITED STATES v. BANKS\n   I would affirm the district court’s well-reasoned assessment\nof common law jurisprudence and the law of Idaho and other\nstates regarding the child victim exception to the marital com-\nmunications privilege. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent\nfrom the majority’s holding that an accused’s admission to his\nspouse that he produced a video depicting his masturbation of\ntheir grandchild was inadmissible under Rule 501.\n\f</pre>",
