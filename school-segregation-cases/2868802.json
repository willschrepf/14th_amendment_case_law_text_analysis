S 431 et seq. (\"FECA\"), as\namended, directly to the en banc Court of Appeals. The\npresent challenge was filed in the District Court for the\nMiddle District of Pennsylvania by Renato P. Mariani. A\ncriminal indictment pending in that court charges Mariani\nand other officers of Empire Sanitary Landfill, Inc., and\nDanella Environmental Technologies, Inc., with violating\nthe FECA, 2 U.S.C. SS 441b(a) and 441f, by making\ncampaign contributions to a number of candidates for\nfederal office through enlisting company employees and\nothers to forward contributions to the candidates that were\nthereafter reimbursed by one of the companies. Mariani\n\n                               3\n\fargues that SS 441b(a) and 441f violate the First\nAmendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nMariani's principal argument regards \"soft money,\" or\nfunds lawfully raised by national and congressional political\nparty organizations for party-building activities from\ncorporations, labor unions, and individuals who have\nreached their federal direct contribution limits. Soft money\nis sometimes used to fund so-called \"issue advocacy,\"\nadvertisements that advocate a candidate's positions or\ncriticize his opponents without specifically urging viewers to\nvote for or defeat the candidate. Issue ads are often only\nmarginally distinguishable from ads directly supporting a\ncandidate, which corporations cannot lawfully fund under\nthe FECA.\n\nMariani contends that S 441b(a), which proscribes\ncorporate contributions made directly to candidates for\nfederal office, has been completely undermined by the\nstaggering increase in recent years of the amount of\ncorporate soft money donations. In Mariani's submission,\nthis avalanche of soft money has made S 441b(a) so\nunderinclusive, and so incapable of materially advancing\nthe intended purpose of the federal election statute, that it\nmust be struck down. Alternatively, because the bellwether\ncases in this area, including Buckley v. Valeo , 424 U.S. 1\n(1976) (per curiam), validate statutes limiting campaign\ncontributions, but not banning them outright, and\nrecognize that corporate speech is protected under the First\nAmendment, see First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,\n435 U.S. 765 (1978), Mariani challenges the total ban on\ndirect corporate contributions as inconsistent with the First\nAmendment. Mariani also challenges the constitutionality of\nS 441f, which prohibits making campaign contributions in\nthe name of another to a candidate for federal elective\noffice.\n\nThe Supreme Court has construed S 437h so that, if a\ndistrict court concludes that a challenge to the FECA is\nfrivolous, the court may dismiss the case without certifying\nit. See California Med. Ass'n v. Federal Election Comm'n,\n453 U.S. 182, 193-94 n.14 (1981). The District Court\nconcluded that the challenge to S 441b(a) was not frivolous,\nmade comprehensive findings, and certified Mariani's\n\n                               4\n\fchallenge to this Court. Section 437h, as construed by the\nSupreme Court, required the District Court to make fact\nfindings. Many of the District Court's findings were\nstipulated to by the parties and are uncontested. The\ngovernment and the Federal Election Commission (\"FEC\"),\nhowever, assail other findings and the Court's 21 ultimate\nfindings of fact as being excessive or beyond its powers.\nThey also argue that a number of them, including the\nultimate findings, are unsupported by the record. Our\nreview of the District Court's findings, made in a setting\noutside the traditional adversary crucible, is not deferential.\nAs we note in section II, we agree that some of the District\nCourt's findings are unsupported by proper evidence and\nthat some stray from appropriate fact finding into legal\nconclusions. But even assuming that the role of soft money\nis that asserted by Mariani and found by the District Court,\nwe conclude that the record could not support a holding\nthat S 441b(a) violates the First Amendment.\n\nThe government and the FEC not only defend the\nconstitutionality of SS 441b(a) and 441f, but contend that\nMariani's challenges are legally frivolous and thus never\nshould have been certified to the en banc court. They also\nsubmit that the District Court employed an insufficiently\nstringent standard for measuring frivolousness. We are\nsatisfied that the District Court did not apply an incorrect\nstandard of legal frivolousness and that it acted correctly in\nnot dismissing the case without certifying it, at least with\nrespect to the challenges to S 441b(a), for which it made an\nindependent assessment of frivolousness. Though the\nDistrict Court did not make an independent assessment of\nthe frivolousness of the challenge to S 441f as it should\nhave, the government does not challenge the lack of an\nindependent assessment here, and because the pending\ncriminal case awaits a determination of this action, we will\nreach the challenges to S 441f without remanding for such\na determination.\n\nAlthough not legally frivolous, Mariani's challenge to\nS 441b(a) fails. As we explain in detail, both the\nunderinclusiveness and outright ban challenges are\ninterred by the Supreme Court's jurisprudence in the area.\nSee especially Austin v. Mich. Chamber of Commerce, 494\n\n                                5\n\fU.S. 652 (1990), and Federal Election Comm'n v. Nat'l Right\nto Work Comm., 459 U.S. 197 (1982). Although Mariani's\nfactual portrayal of the impact of soft money on\ncontemporary elections is impressive, it falls short. Section\n441b(a) is not fatally underinclusive under our precedents,\nbecause we cannot say that there is no meaningful\ndistinction between hard and soft money. We cannot\nexchange our robes for togas; any reform in this area must\nbe sought from Congress.\n\nFinally, we conclude that the challenge to S 441f is\npatently without merit. Accordingly we shall enter judgment\nin favor of the government.\n\nI. Procedural History\n\nIn October 1997, the United States filed an indictment\ncharging Mariani and several other individuals with, inter\nalia, violating the FECA. That action, United States v.\nMariani, No. 3:CR-97-225, is pending before the District\nCourt. The indictment charges that between August 1994\nand December 1996, Mariani and other officers and\nemployees of Empire Sanitary Landfill, Inc. (\"Empire\") and\nDanella Environmental Technologies, Inc. (\"Danella\")\nsolicited numerous employees of the corporations, as well\nas business associates, friends, and family members, to\nmake contributions to the campaigns of designated\ncandidates for federal election. According to the indictment,\nthese contributions were reimbursed either directly or\nindirectly by Empire. The indictment also alleges that\nMariani and other officers and employees at Empire and\nDanella made individual contributions to these federal\ncandidates, which were also reimbursed by Empire.\n\nMore particularly, the indictment alleges that in April\n1995, Mariani and other officers and employees of Empire\nand Danella contacted employees, associates, friends and\nfamily members in an effort to raise funds for the New\nJersey Steering Committee, a state fundraising arm of the\nRobert Dole campaign for President. Contributors allegedly\nwere asked to write personal checks in amounts of $1,000\n(or, in the case of couples, $2,000) and were reimbursed\nwith Empire corporate funds. It is also alleged that on April\n\n                               6\n\f29, 1995, Mariani and another defendant in the criminal\ncase, Michael Serafini, attended a Steering Committee\nluncheon at which they handed an envelope containing the\ncontributions to Dole campaign officials. When the Dole\ncampaign reported the contributions to the Federal Election\nCommission (\"FEC\"), its filing allegedly attributed these\n$80,000 worth of contributions to the individual\ncontributors, rather than to Empire. The Dole contributions\ncame approximately ten days prior to a vote in the Senate\non the Interstate Transportation of Municipal Waste bill, in\nwhich Empire and Danella were interested. Dole was the\nSenate majority leader at the time.\n\nThe indictment charges Mariani (and others) with\nviolations of 2 U.S.C. SS 441b(a) and 441f. Section 441b(a)\nof the FECA prohibits any corporation from making any\ncontribution in connection with any campaign for federal\noffice and renders it unlawful for any officer of a\ncorporation to consent to any prohibited corporate\ncontribution. Section 441f of the FECA, the conduit\ncontribution ban or \"anti-conduit\" provision, prohibits one\nfrom making a contribution \"in the name of another\nperson\" or \"knowingly permit[ting] his name to be used to\neffect such a contribution.\" 2 U.S.C. S 441f. Mariani moved\nto dismiss the FECA charges in the indictment and\nsimultaneously filed this action against the United States\nseeking declaratory relief pursuant to 2 U.S.C.S 437h. The\nFEC was granted leave to intervene as a defendant.\n\nSection 437h provides that\n\n       any individual eligible to vote in any election for the\n       office of President may institute such actions in the\n       appropriate district court of the United States,\n       including actions for declaratory judgment, as may be\n       appropriate to construe the constitutionality of any\n       provision of [FECA]. The district court immediately\n       shall certify all questions of constitutionality of this Act\n       to the United States court of appeals for the circuit\n       involved, which shall hear the matter sitting en banc.\n\n2 U.S.C. S 437h.1 The Supreme Court has construed S 437h\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. It is uncontested that Mariani meets the voter eligibility requirement.\n\n                               7\n\fso that, if a plaintiff brings a claim that is frivolous, a\ndistrict court may dismiss the case without certifying it. See\nCalifornia Med. Ass'n v. Federal Election Comm'n, 453 U.S.\n182, 193-94 n.14 (1981). The Supreme Court also has\ninterpreted S 437h to require the district court to develop a\nrecord and make findings of fact sufficient to allow the en\nbanc court of appeals to decide the constitutional issues.\nSee Bread Political Action Comm. v. Fed. Election Comm'n,\n455 U.S. 577, 580 (1982) (\"[T]he District Court, as required\nby S 437h, first made findings of fact and then certified the\ncase . . . .\"). The District Court concluded that the\nchallenge to S 441b(a) was not frivolous, and that the\ninterests of judicial economy \"militated against\" a separate\ndetermination that the challenge to S 441f was not\nfrivolous. See Mariani v. United States, 80 F. Supp. 2d 352,\n355 (M.D. Pa. 1999). The District Court then made\ncomprehensive findings and certified the challenge to this\nCourt.\n\nII. The District Court's Findings of Fact\n\nSome of the District Court's findings are disputed, are\nunsupported by proper evidence, or go beyond appropriate\nfact finding into legal conclusion. For example, an opinion\nexpressed by the New York Times Editorial page that one\nindividual's experiences with the Democratic National\nCommittee \"deepen the cynicism of Americans\" is not a\nproper evidentiary source for a finding that Americans have\nbecome more cynical about government as a result of the\nrole of soft money in the political system.2 See Mariani v.\nUnited States, 80 F. Supp.2d. 352, 412 (M.D. Pa. 1999).\nSimilarly, the very title of the segment of thefindings called\n\"Due to the Effects of Soft Money on the Political System,\nFECA is not Serving the Goals it was Intended to Serve,\" id.\nat 418, as well as the finding that \"[m]ost issue ads are\nfinanced in large part with soft money . . . from sources\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Johnny Chung, the individual referred to in the editorial, stated in an\ninterview with NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw that he was solicited to\nmake contributions to the Democratic National Committee in exchange\nfor invitations to meetings at which he could meet government officials\nand discuss business concerns.\n\n                               8\n\fand in amounts that the FECA was meant to prohibit,\" id.\nat 377, demonstrate that the fact-finding effort sometimes\nmetamorphosed into conclusions regarding the legal issues\nin this case. Id. at 418-19. Given the unique procedural\nposture of the case, we need not (and do not) defer to such\nfindings in our analysis. Although some of the District\nCourt's findings went beyond what was proper both as a\nmatter of evidence and by crossing the line into forming\nlegal conclusions, the court compiled an impressive factual\nshowing that soft money plays an increasingly large role in\nfederal elections.\n\nContributions made to or expenditures made on behalf of\ncandidates for federal elective office are referred to as \"hard\nmoney.\" Under S 441b(a), corporations are not permitted to\nmake contributions of hard money to campaigns for federal\noffice. Corporations can, however, make contributions to\npolitical parties in unlimited amounts. These contributions,\nwhich are referred to as \"soft money,\" can be used to fund\n\"issue advocacy.\" \"Issue advocacy\" includes advertisements\nor other campaign materials that advocate positions\nsupported by a candidate, often comparing those positions\nwith those of an opponent, without directly advocating the\nelection of the candidate. Donors of soft money are able to\navoid the FECA contribution limits and disclosure\nrequirements applicable to hard money and direct\nadvocacy. The amount of soft money contributed in each\nelection cycle has grown tremendously in the last two\ndecades, from about $19 million in 1980 to more than $260\nmillion in 1996.3 Soft money donations by the 544 largest\npublic and private companies more than tripled between\n1992 and 1996.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. During the 1995-96 election year cycle, the Republican national party\ncommittees (the Republican National Committee, the National\nRepublican Senatorial Committee, and the National Republican\nCongressional Committee) raised approximately $138.2 million in soft\nmoney and the Democratic national party committees (the Democratic\nNational Committee, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee,\nand the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee) raised\napproximately $123.9 million in soft money. (The term \"election cycle\"\nrefers to the period from January 1 of the year preceding the election\nthrough December 31 of the year during which the election occurs).\nCorporations were major contributors of these funds.\n\n                               9\n\fWith respect to Mariani's challenge, the parties agree on\nthe following facts. Candidates for federal elective office\nhelp their parties raise soft money. Candidates who raise\nlarge amounts of soft money often receive more support\nfrom their party than candidates who are less effective at\nraising soft money. Committee officials often act as\nintermediaries between donors and candidates.\n\nSoft money is used to fund (or partially fund) issue\nadvocacy that, on occasion, is hard to distinguish from\ndirect advocacy for a particular candidate for federal office.\nCampaigns sometimes coordinate with outside entities\nregarding these ads. These ads promote or criticize federal\ncandidates in order to influence the outcome of elections,\nalthough avoiding words of direct advocacy such as\"vote\nfor,\" \"elect,\" or \"defeat.\"4\n\nCorporations play an important role in campaignfinance.\nCandidates for federal elective office often know which\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. The following ads aired in the 1995-95 election cycle illustrate this\nproposition. The Republican National Committee financed the following\nad:\n\n       ANNOUNCER: Three years ago Bill Clinton gave us the largest tax\n       increase in history, including a 4 cent a gallon increase on\ngasoline.\n       Bill Clinton said he felt bad about it.\n\n       CLINTON: People in this room are still mad at me over the budget\n       because you think I raised your taxes too much. It might surprise\n       you to know I think I raised them too much, too.\n\n       ANNOUNCER: OK, Mr. President, We are surprised. So now,\n       surprise us again. Support Senator Dole's plan to repeal your gas\n       tax. And learn that actions . . . do speak louder than words.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee financed the following issue ad:\n\n       ANNOUNCER: American Values. Do our duty to our parents.\n       President Clinton protects Medicare. The Dole/Gingrich budget tried\n       to cut Medicare $270 Billion.\n\n       Protect families. President Clinton cut taxes for millions of\nworking\n       families. The Dole/Gingrich budget tried to raise taxes on 8\nmillion\n       of them. Opportunity. President Clinton proposes tax breaks for\n       tuition. The Dole/Gingrich budget tried to slash college\n       scholarships. Only President Clinton's plan meets our challenges,\n       protects our values.\n\f10\n\fcorporations are large contributors of soft money. Because\nthere are no limits on soft money contributions, soft money\nis easier to raise than hard money. Soft money\ncontributions of corporate treasury funds can result in\naccess (and thus a forum to express their interests) for\ncorporate officials to high government officials, including\nelected officials, as well as to candidates for federal elective\noffice. Large and repeat donors sometime get more access\nthan other donors, and donating soft money can be a more\neffective means for getting access than hard money.\nCorporate soft money contributions enable corporations to\nsome extent to circumvent the corporate hard money\ncontribution ban and support (indirectly) candidates for\nfederal elective office.\n\nCorporations are solicited for and give large sums of soft\nmoney in federal elections; according to reportsfiled with\nthe FEC, during the 1994 and 1998 election cycles,\ncorporations donated more than 50 percent of all itemized\nsoft money contributions. Additionally, in the 1995-95\nelection cycle, corporations in industries in which\nlegislation was contemplated gave large sums of soft money.\n\nIII. The Test for Frivolousness\n\nIn California Med. Ass'n v. Fed. Election Comm'n , 453\nU.S. 182, 193-94 n.14 (1981), the Supreme Court stated\nthat \"we do not construe S 437h to require certification of\nconstitutional claims that are frivolous.\" The Court cited\nwith approval a district court decision from an in forma\npauperis action that employed the standard from the in\nforma pauperis statute, 28 U.S.C. S 1915(e)(2)(B), to\ndetermine whether a challenge to FECA was frivolous. See\nid. at 193-94 n. 14 (citing Gifford v. Congress, 452 F. Supp.\n802 (E.D. Cal. 1978)). The in forma pauperis statute\nauthorizes a district court to dismiss sua sponte any action\nthat it determines to be legally frivolous. An action is not\nfrivolous under the statute where the complaint raises an\narguable question of law that ultimately will be resolved\nagainst the plaintiff. Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 328\n(1989). The District Court applied the standard for\nfrivolousness set forth in Neitzke and certified Mariani's\nchallenge to the en banc Court of Appeals after concluding\n\n                                  11\n\fthat \"it cannot be said that the constitutional challenges\nare plainly foreclosed by existing precedent.\" Mariani v.\nUnited States, No.3 CV-98-1701 (March 25, 1999).\n\nThe government and the FEC argue that the District\nCourt should have used a more exacting standard for\nfrivolousness and rejected Mariani's challenge. They submit\nthat the correct standard is that set forth by the Ninth\nCircuit in Goland v. United States, 903 F.2d 1247, 1257\n(9th Cir. 1990), which viewed the role of the District Court\nas akin to that of a single judge deciding a motion to\nconvene a three-judge court to hear a constitutional\nchallenge and noted that this standard is closer to the\nstandard used to review a claim under FED. R. CIV. P.\n12(b)(6) than it is to the in forma pauperis standard.\n\nWe need not decide which standard applies, because\nunder either standard Mariani's claim is not frivolous. As\nthe Ninth Circuit noted, a genuinely new variation on an\nissue raised under a particular section of the FECA that\nalready has been challenged and upheld may give rise to a\nnonfrivolous challenge to that section: \"[o]nce a core\nprovision of FECA has been reviewed and approved by the\ncourts, unanticipated variations also may deserve the full\nattention of the appellate court. At the same time, not every\nsophistic twist that arguably presents a `new' question\nshould be certified.\" Goland v. United States, 903 F.2d at\n1257; see also Khachaturian v. FEC, 980 F.2d 330, 331\n(5th Cir. 1992). Mariani's challenge to S 441b(a) is not\nsimply a sophistic twist, but can fairly be characterized as\na new challenge based on the rise in importance in\ncampaign finance of soft money and issue advocacy.\nMoreover, the facial validity of the statute never has been\nsquarely determined by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe District Court did not make an independent\nassessment of the frivolousness of the challenge toS 441f.\nHereafter, district courts considering challenges to separate\nprovisions of the FECA should make the required\ndetermination regarding frivolousness for each of the\nchallenges.5 However, because the government does not\nchallenge the lack of an independent assessment here, and\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. That determination is best made initially by District Courts.\n\n                                12\n\fbecause the pending criminal case awaits a determination\nof this action, we will reach the challenges toS 441f without\nremanding for a determination regarding frivolousness.\n\nIV. The Challenge to S 441b(a)\n\nSection 441b(a) bans corporations and unions from using\nfunds from their corporate treasuries to contribute to or\nmake expenditures in connection with any campaign for\nfederal office. See 2 U.S.C. S 441b(a). In Fed. Elec. Comm'n\nv. Nat'l Right to Work Comm., 459 U.S. 197, 208-09 (1982),\nthe Supreme Court chronicled the history of S 441b(a):\n\n       Seventy-five years ago Congress first made financial\n       contributions to federal candidates by corporations\n       illegal by enacting the Tillman Act, 34 Stat. 864 (1907).\n       Within the next few years Congress went further and\n       required financial disclosure by federal candidates\n       following election, Act of July 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 822,\n       and the following year required pre-election disclosure\n       as well. Act of August 19, 1911, 37 Stat. 25. The\n       Federal Corrupt Practices Act, passed in 1925,\n       extended the prohibition against corporate\n       contributions to include \"anything of value,\" and made\n       acceptance of a corporate contribution as well as the\n       giving of such a contribution a crime. 43 Stat. 1070.\n\n        The first restrictions on union contributions were\n       contained in the second Hatch Act, 54 Stat. 767\n       (1940), and later, in the War Labor Disputes Act of\n       1943, 57 Stat. 167, union contributions in connection\n       with federal elections were prohibited altogether. These\n       prohibitions on union political activity were extended\n       and strengthened in the Taft-Hartley Act, 61 Stat. 136\n       (1947), which broadened the earlier prohibition against\n       contributions to \"expenditures\" as well. Congress\n       codified most of these provisions in the Federal\n       Election Campaign Act of 1971, 86 Stat. 3, and\n       enacted later amendments in 1974, 88 Stat. 1263, and\n       in 1976, 90 Stat. 475.\n\nUnder Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 19, 22 (1976) (per\ncuriam), it is clear that spending for political campaigns is\nprotected speech that implicates both the right to free\n\n                                 13\n\fexpression and the right of free association. Moreover,\nbecause there is \"no support in the First or Fourteenth\nAmendment, or in the decisions of this Court, for the\nproposition that speech that otherwise would be within the\nprotection of the First Amendment loses that protection\nsimply because its source is a corporation,\" First Nat'l Bank\nof Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 784 (1977), the ban on\ncorporate contributions under S 441b(a) is subject to the\nsame level of scrutiny as other regulations limiting\nspending for political campaigns. In Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n16, the Court held that limitations on spending for\ncampaigns should be subjected to \"exacting scrutiny\": \"this\nCourt has never suggested that the dependence of a\ncommunication on the expenditure of money operates itself\nto introduce a nonspeech element or to reduce the exacting\nscrutiny required by the First Amendment.\" The Court\nadded that the First Amendment guarantee \"has its fullest\nand most urgent application precisely to the conduct of\ncampaigns for political office.\" Id. at 15 (citing Monitor\nPatriot v. Roy, 401 U.S. 265, 272 (1971)).\n\nBuckley, of course, distinguished campaign contributions\nfrom direct expenditures, striking down a limit on\nexpenditures while upholding a limit on campaign\ncontributions. As the Court's recent decision in Nixon v.\nShrink Missouri Gov't PAC, 120 S.Ct. 897, 904 (2000) (citing\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 20-21), explains, in the area of\ncontributions, even under the exacting scrutiny standard,\n\"limiting contributions [leaves] communication significantly\nunimpaired.\" \"[U]nder Buckley's standard of scrutiny, a\ncontribution limit involving `significant interference' with\nassociational rights could survive if the government\ndemonstrated that contribution regulation was `closely\ndrawn' to match a `sufficiently important interest.' \" Shrink\nMissouri, 120 S.Ct. at 904 (citation omitted). Accordingly, in\nconsidering Mariani's challenge to S 441b(a), while we treat\ncampaign contributions from the corporate treasury as\nspeech and subject the ban on them in S 441b(a) to\nexacting scrutiny, we do so against a background principle\nthat limits on contributions--though not necessarily bans\non contributions--can withstand this scrutiny if they are\n\" `closely drawn' to match a `sufficiently important\ninterest.' \"\n\n                               14\n\fThe District Court certified two issues regardingS 441b(a)\nto this Court. The first is whether the prohibition in\nS 441b(a) on contributions by corporations from corporate\ntreasuries to candidates for federal elective office is\nunconstitutional on its face. The second is whether the\nprohibition in S 441b(a) on contributions by corporations\nfrom corporate treasuries to candidates for federal office, in\nthe context of the presently existing law that otherwise\npermits corporations to expend unlimited amounts of\ncorporate funds to influence the outcome of federal\nelections (via soft money contributions), violates the First\nAmendment.\n\nA. The Constitutionality of S 441b(a) on its Face\n\nIn considering the $1,000 contribution limit at issue in\nBuckley, the Supreme Court stressed the importance of the\nright to association through support of the candidate of\none's choice:\n\n       [T]he primary first amendment problem raised by the\n       Act's contribution limitations is their restriction of one\n       aspect of the contributor's freedom of political\n       association . . . [T]he right of association is a `basic\n       constitutional freedom,' Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S.\n       57, that is \"closely allied to freedom of speech and a\n       right which, like free speech, lies at the foundation of\n       a free society.\" Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 486\n       (1960). In view of the fundamental nature of the right\n       to associate, governmental \"action which may have the\n       effect of curtailing the freedom to associate is subject\n       to the closest scrutiny.\" NAACP v. Alabama , [357 U.S.]\n       at 460-461.\n\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 24-25 (internal citations partially\nomitted).\n\nNevertheless, the Court concluded that the $1,000 limit\nwas constitutional. The Court identified two principal\nreasons for upholding the limit. First, the Court recognized\na strong governmental interest in deterring corruption and\nthe appearance of corruption in campaign finance,\nparticularly from large contributions. Id. at 28; see also id.\nat 30 (\"Congress was justified in concluding that the\n\n                               15\n\finterest in safeguarding against the appearance of\nimpropriety requires that the opportunity for abuse\n\ninherent in the process of raising large monetary\ncontributions be eliminated.\"). Second, the Court concluded\nthat the $1,000 limit was narrowly tailored insofar as it still\npermitted individual donors to register their political\npreferences in a substantial way, reasoning that the\nexpressive value of the contribution lies in the act of\ncontributing rather than the amount given. See id. at 21.\nAccordingly, Buckley seems to leave open the question\nwhether an outright ban on campaign contributions--such\nas that found in S 441b(a)--would pass constitutional\nmuster.\n\nThe government and the FEC argue that, even if Buckley\nleft the door open for a constitutional challenge to an\noutright ban, Federal Election Comm'n v. National Right to\nWork Comm, 459 U.S. 197 (1982) (hereinafter NRWC),\nslammed the door shut. In NRWC, the Supreme Court\naddressed indirectly the issue of limiting direct corporate\ncontributions to candidates. There, the Court upheld\nfederal restrictions upon corporate solicitation of campaign\nfunds from individuals found in a subsection ofS 441b-\n441b(b)(4)(c)--that prohibits nonstock corporations from\nsoliciting funds to be used for political purposes (through a\nseparate segregated fund) from people who are not\nmembers of the corporation. See id. at 198 n.1, 205-11.\n\nSubsection 441b(b)(4)(c) permits corporations to make\nlimited campaign contributions from separate segregated\nfunds solicited explicitly for that purpose. See id. at 201-02.\nIn upholding the statute, the Court suggested that\nCongress could prohibit direct contributions by\ncorporations to candidates for public office, stating that\n\n       The first purpose of S 441b, the government states, is\n       to ensure that substantial aggregations of wealth\n       amassed by the special advantages which go with the\n       corporate form of organization should not be converted\n       into political \"war chests\" which could be used to incur\n       political debts from legislators who are aided by the\n       contributions. See United States v. United Automobile\n       Workers, 352 U.S. 567, 579, 77 S.Ct. 529, 535, 1\n       L.Ed.2d 563 (1957). The second purpose of the\n\n                               16\n\f       provisions, the government argues, is to protect the\n       individuals who have paid money into a corporation or\n       union for purposes other than the support of\n       candidates from having that money used to support\n       political candidates to whom they may be opposed. See\n       United States v. CIO, 335 U.S. 106, 113, 68 S.Ct. 1349,\n       1353, 92 L.Ed. 1849 (1948). We agree with the\n       government that these purposes are sufficient to justify\n       the regulation at issue.\n\nId. at 207-08. See also Fed. Election Comm'n v. Nat'l\nConservative PAC, 470 U.S. 480, 495 (1985) (stating that\nNRWC upheld \"the prohibition of corporate campaign\ncontributions to political candidates\").\n\nAlthough S 441b(a) was not directly at issue in NRWC,\nthe Eleventh and Sixth Circuits have read NRWC to uphold\nthe constitutionality of its ban on contributions from\ncorporate treasuries. See Kentucky Right to Life, Inc. v.\nTerry, 108 F.3d 637, 645-46 (6th Cir. 1997); Athens Lumber\nCo., Inc. v. FEC, 718 F.2d 363, 363 (11th Cir. 1983) (en\nbanc). There is some room for doubt as to whether the\nCourt can be said to have held squarely that the ban in\nS 441b(a) is constitutional. NRWC stated that \"We are also\nconvinced that the statutory prohibitions and exceptions\nwe have considered are sufficiently tailored to these\npurposes to avoid undue restriction on the associational\ninterests asserted by respondent.\" Id. at 208 (emphasis\nadded). Moreover, the first purpose identified by the Court\n--limiting the effect of the advantage flowing from the\ncorporate form--could be met by a limit on contributions\nfrom corporate treasuries instead of a ban; and the second\npurpose could perhaps be addressed in corporate charters\nand state laws regulating corporations. Nevertheless, we\nfeel constrained to read NRWC, and the Court's statements\non NRWC in Nat'l Conservative PAC, as at least strong\nsuggestions that S 441b(a) is constitutional.\n\nAustin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652\n(1990), which upheld a Michigan statute that prohibited\ncorporations from using corporate funds for independent\nexpenditures in support of or in opposition to candidates\nfor state office, also implies that the flat ban in S 441b(a) is\nconstitutional. The analysis proceeds from Buckley, which\n\n                               17\n\fdistinguished independent expenditures from contributions:\n\"[A]lthough the Act's contribution and expenditure\nlimitations both implicate fundamental First Amendment\ninterests, its expenditure ceilings impose significantly more\nsevere restrictions on protected freedoms of political\nexpression and association than do its limitations on\nfinancial contributions.\" Buckley, 424 U.S. at 23. Austin\nupheld a ban on independent expenditures from the\ncorporate treasury because it found the ban sufficiently\nnarrowly tailored to the purpose of limiting the influence of\nthe unique state-conferred benefit of the corporate\nstructure, which allows corporations to amass large\ntreasuries. See Austin, 494 U.S. at 660-61. Because\nBuckley treats limits on independent expenditures as more\nsevere than limits on contributions, Austin suggests that a\nban on contributions from the corporate treasury also\nwould be constitutional if sufficiently narrowly tailored to\nachieve the goal.\n\nAustin also counsels that the ban on contributions from\nthe corporate treasury here is sufficiently narrowly tailored\nto the interest of limiting the influence of corporate\ntreasuries amassed under the state-conferred corporate\nstructure. Austin reasoned that the Michigan statute\nprohibiting independent expenditures by corporations was\nsufficiently narrowly tailored to its purpose because, by\npermitting corporations to make independent political\nexpenditures from separate segregated funds, it avoided an\nabsolute ban on all forms of corporate political spending.\nSee 494 U.S. at 660-61. The FECA also permits such\nindirect corporate political expenditures (via soft money),\nand under the teachings of Austin would thus seem to be\nsufficiently narrowly tailored to pass constitutional muster.\n\nWe are mindful that the flat ban on corporate\ncontributions has never been directly addressed by a\nholding of the Supreme Court, and that this issue involves\nimportant First Amendment values. Because of the strong\nimplication we draw from NRCW, Nat'l Conservative PAC,\nand Austin, however, we feel compelled to reject Mariani's\nfacial challenge to S 441b(a). It will be for the Supreme\nCourt itself to decide otherwise.\n\n                                18\n\fB. Section 441b(a) and Soft Money\n\nThe second challenge Mariani raises with respect to\nS 441b(a) is that the development of issue advocacy and the\nprevalence of soft money in campaigns for federal office has\nso eroded the theoretical distinction between hard and soft\nmoney that any justification for the ban on contributions\nfrom corporate treasuries has been vitiated. Mariani argues\nthat under present conditions the ban cannot advance a\ncompelling state interest and therefore must be invalidated.\nSignificantly, Mariani does not complain thatS 441b(a)\nitself fails to ban contributions from corporate treasuries.\nRather, he argues that under the FECA--as interpreted by\nthe Supreme Court and FEC regulations--it is possible for\ncorporations to accomplish through other means that\nwhich they cannot accomplish through direct contributions\nfrom corporate treasuries. Mariani contends that, by\nfunding soft money issue advocacy, contributors come so\nclose to accomplishing what they would accomplish by hard\nmoney campaign contributions that the two are basically\nindistinguishable in terms of the danger they pose of\ncorrupting the political process.\n\nThis contention amounts to an argument that S 441b(a)\ndoes too little by way of banning corporate political\nspending and is thereby fatally underinclusive. The\nSupreme Court has made clear, however, that Congress\ncan act incrementally in this and other areas. See Buckley,\n424 U.S. at 105 (\"[A] statute is not invalid under the\nconstitution because it might have gone farther than it\ndid.\") (citations omitted). As we have explained in a case\nregarding solicitation of campaign funds by a candidate for\njudicial office, the government may \"take steps, albeit tiny\nones, that only partially solve a problem without totally\neradicating it.\" Stretton v. Disciplinary Bd. of the Supreme\nCourt of Penn., 944 F.2d 137, 146 (3d Cir. 1991).\n\nThe underinclusiveness analysis employed for First\nAmendment questions does not change this principle. The\nFirst Amendment requires that the rule chosen must\"fit\"\nthe asserted goals, City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Network,\nInc., 507 U.S. 410, 428 (1993), and it must also strike an\nappropriate balance between achieving those goals and\nprotecting constitutional rights. Underinclusiveness\n\n                               19\n\fanalysis serves to \"ensure that the proffered state interest\nactually underlies the law,\" Austin, 494 U.S. at 677\n(Brennan, J., concurring). But a rule fails the test only if it\ncannot \"fairly be said to advance any genuinely substantial\ngovernmental interest,\" Federal Communication Comm'n v.\nLeague of Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364, 396 (1984),\nbecause it provides only \"ineffective or remote\" support for\nthe asserted goals, id. (citing Central Hudson Gas & Elec.\nCorp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 447 U.S. 557, 564 (1980)), or\n\"the most limited incremental\" support, Bolger v. Youngs\nDrug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 73 (1983).\n\nThus, First Amendment underinclusiveness analysis\nrequires neither a perfect nor even the best available fit\nbetween means and ends. See City of Renton v. Playtime\nTheaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 52-53 (1986) (zoning ordinance\nregulating adult theaters was not constitutionally\nunderinclusive \"in that it fail[ed] to regulate other kinds of\nadult businesses . . . We simply have no basis on this\nrecord for assuming that Renton will not, in the future,\namend its ordinance to include other kinds of adult\nbusinesses.\"). See also Blount v. SEC, 61 F.3d 938, 946\n(D.C. Cir. 1995) (\"[A] regulation is not fatally underinclusive\nsimply because an alternative regulation, which would\nrestrict more or the speech of more people could be more\neffective. The First Amendment does not require the\ngovernment to curtail as much speech as may conceivably\nserve its goals.\").\n\nApplying this standard, section 441b(a) is not fatally\nunderinclusive. The regulation in Fed. Communications\nComm'n v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. at 397, which\nbanned editorial speech by station management, but not\neditorial control over the content of programs and guests on\nnews programs, was struck down because it did \"virtually\nnothing\" to prevent noncommercial stations from serving as\noutlets for expression of narrow partisan views. In contrast,\nS 441b(a) prevents corporations from donating hard money\nentirely. The important theoretical differences between hard\nand soft money, which include that a candidate cannot\ndirectly control how to spend soft money, are intended to\navoid the corrupting influence of large contributors\nsupporting a particular candidate. The practical\n\n                               20\n\fdistinctions between hard and soft money may have\ndiminished in the past decade with the rise of issue\nadvocacy, but not to such an extent that we can say that\nthere is no benefit from distinguishing between the two. If\nhard and soft money were equivalent, it would be hard to\nimagine why Mariani would have gone to the lengths he\nallegedly went to in order to give hard money instead of\nsoft.\n\nMariani attempts to counter this analysis by citing to\nUnited States v. Nat'l Treasury Employees Union, 513 U.S.\n454 (1995):\n\n       [w]hen the Government defends a regulation on speech\n       as a means to . . . prevent anticipated harms, it must\n       do more than simply `posit the existence of the disease\n       sought to be cured.' . . . It must demonstrate that the\n       recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that\n       the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a\n       direct and material way.\n\nId. at 475 (quoting Turner Broadcasting System v. Fed.\nCommunications Comm'n, 512 U.S. 622, 664 (1994)). The\nunderinclusiveness analysis explicated above is not\ninconsistent with National Treasury Employees Union.\nCongress may regulate speech so long as it demonstrates\nthat the recited harms are real, and it may, consistent with\nthat principle, choose to regulate just some part of that\nspeech. The requirement that the regulation alleviate the\nharm in a direct and material way is not a requirement that\nit redress the harm completely. And in light of the broad\nlanguage in NRWC regarding the legitimacy of Congress's\npurpose in enacting S 441b(a), it is simply too late in the\nday to argue that Congress has failed to demonstrate that\nthe recited harms are real.\n\nCongress might well have concluded that direct\ncontributions from corporate treasuries were more\nimportant to regulate than expenditures or contributions\nmade through committees, because hard money can be\nused by a candidate in more and different ways than soft\nmoney. We note that no party to this case has argued that\nthere is no compelling government interest in banning\ncontributions from corporations. Indeed, Mariani's\n\n                               21\n\fargument that the rise of soft money fatally undermines the\npurpose of S 441b(a) seems to depend on the assumption\nthat limiting corporate contributions--if done effectively--\nwould be constitutionally valid.\n\nV. The Challenge to S 441f\n\nSection 441f provides that \"[n]o person shall make a\ncontribution in the name of another person or knowingly\npermit his name to be used to effect such a contribution,\nand no person shall knowingly accept a contribution made\nby one person in the name of another person.\" 2 U.S.C.\nS 441f. Mariani argues that the prohibition inS 441f on\ncontributions in the name of another to candidates for\nfederal elective office violates the First Amendment because\nit fails to advance any compelling state interest and\nbecause it is underinclusive since it only applies to\ncontributions of hard money (and can be circumvented by\ndonating soft money).\n\nThe Buckley Court accorded broad acceptance to the\nFECA's reporting and disclosure requirements, explaining\nthat they impose \"only a marginal restriction upon the\ncontributor's ability to engage in free communication.\"\nBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 21-22 (1976). Although\nacknowledging the dangers of compelled disclosure of\npolitical activity, the Court found that the governmental\ninterests in disclosure were of such magnitude that the\nrequirements passed the strict test established by NAACP v.\nAlabama, 357 U.S. 449 (1958). The Court accepted as\ncompelling three purposes behind the disclosure\nrequirement: to provide the electorate with information as\nto where political campaign money comes from and how it\nis spent by the candidate in order to aid the voters in\nevaluating those who seek federal office; to deter actual or\napparent corruption; and to gather the data necessary to\ndetect violations of the contribution limits. Buckley, 424\nU.S. at 66-68.\n\nBuckley carefully considered the danger posed by\ncompelled disclosure. It held that the state interests\npromoted by the FECA's reporting and disclosure\nrequirements justified the indirect burden imposed on First\n\n                               22\n\fAmendment interests, and that the compelled disclosure\nrequirements were constitutional in the absence of a\n\"reasonable probability\" that disclosures would subject\ntheir contributors to \"threats, harassment, or reprisals.\" Id.\nat 74. Proscription of conduit contributions (with the\nconcomitant requirement that the true source of\ncontributions be disclosed) would seem to be at the very\ncore of the Court's analysis. In light of Buckley, we reject\nMariani's argument that S 441f fails to advance a\ncompelling state interest.\n\nWe also conclude that Congress's decision to limit the\ndisclosure requirement to contributions of hard money does\nnot make the requirement fatally underinclusive. Mariani's\nargument that the disclosure requirement is fatally\nunderinclusive is similar to his argument that S 441b(a) has\nbeen undermined by the rise of soft money. As with that\nchallenge, however, we conclude that Congress was free to\ndetermine that disclosure of hard money donations was the\nmost important form of disclosure, and to limit the\nregulation to that area.\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reject Mariani's challenges\nto SS 441b(a) and 441f. Judgment will be entered in favor of\nthe government.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               23\n\f",

S 431 et seq. (\"FECA\"), as\namended, directly to the en banc Court of Appeals. The\npresent challenge was filed in the District Court for the\nMiddle District of Pennsylvania by Renato P. Mariani. A\ncriminal indictment pending in that court charges Mariani\nand other officers of Empire Sanitary Landfill, Inc., and\nDanella Environmental Technologies, Inc., with violating\nthe FECA, 2 U.S.C. SS 441b(a) and 441f, by making\ncampaign contributions to a number of candidates for\nfederal office through enlisting company employees and\nothers to forward contributions to the candidates that were\nthereafter reimbursed by one of the companies. Mariani\n\n                               3\n\fargues that SS 441b(a) and 441f violate the First\nAmendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nMariani's principal argument regards \"soft money,\" or\nfunds lawfully raised by national and congressional political\nparty organizations for party-building activities from\ncorporations, labor unions, and individuals who have\nreached their federal direct contribution limits. Soft money\nis sometimes used to fund so-called \"issue advocacy,\"\nadvertisements that advocate a candidate's positions or\ncriticize his opponents without specifically urging viewers to\nvote for or defeat the candidate. Issue ads are often only\nmarginally distinguishable from ads directly supporting a\ncandidate, which corporations cannot lawfully fund under\nthe FECA.\n\nMariani contends that S 441b(a), which proscribes\ncorporate contributions made directly to candidates for\nfederal office, has been completely undermined by the\nstaggering increase in recent years of the amount of\ncorporate soft money donations. In Mariani's submission,\nthis avalanche of soft money has made S 441b(a) so\nunderinclusive, and so incapable of materially advancing\nthe intended purpose of the federal election statute, that it\nmust be struck down. Alternatively, because the bellwether\ncases in this area, including Buckley v. Valeo , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1976) (per curiam), validate statutes limiting campaign\ncontributions, but not banning them outright, and\nrecognize that corporate speech is protected under the First\nAmendment, see First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109836\"><a href=\"/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978), Mariani challenges the total ban on\ndirect corporate contributions as inconsistent with the First\nAmendment. Mariani also challenges the constitutionality of\nS 441f, which prohibits making campaign contributions in\nthe name of another to a candidate for federal elective\noffice.\n\nThe Supreme Court has construed S 437h so that, if a\ndistrict court concludes that a challenge to the FECA is\nfrivolous, the court may dismiss the case without certifying\nit. See California Med. Ass'n v. Federal Election Comm'n,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110551\"><a href=\"/opinion/110551/california-medical-assn-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193-94 n.14 (1981). The District Court\nconcluded that the challenge to S 441b(a) was not frivolous,\nmade comprehensive findings, and certified Mariani's\n\n                               4\n\fchallenge to this Court. Section 437h, as construed by the\nSupreme Court, required the District Court to make fact\nfindings. Many of the District Court's findings were\nstipulated to by the parties and are uncontested. The\ngovernment and the Federal Election Commission (\"FEC\"),\nhowever, assail other findings and the Court's 21 ultimate\nfindings of fact as being excessive or beyond its powers.\nThey also argue that a number of them, including the\nultimate findings, are unsupported by the record. Our\nreview of the District Court's findings, made in a setting\noutside the traditional adversary crucible, is not deferential.\nAs we note in section II, we agree that some of the District\nCourt's findings are unsupported by proper evidence and\nthat some stray from appropriate fact finding into legal\nconclusions. But even assuming that the role of soft money\nis that asserted by Mariani and found by the District Court,\nwe conclude that the record could not support a holding\nthat S 441b(a) violates the First Amendment.\n\nThe government and the FEC not only defend the\nconstitutionality of SS 441b(a) and 441f, but contend that\nMariani's challenges are legally frivolous and thus never\nshould have been certified to the en banc court. They also\nsubmit that the District Court employed an insufficiently\nstringent standard for measuring frivolousness. We are\nsatisfied that the District Court did not apply an incorrect\nstandard of legal frivolousness and that it acted correctly in\nnot dismissing the case without certifying it, at least with\nrespect to the challenges to S 441b(a), for which it made an\nindependent assessment of frivolousness. Though the\nDistrict Court did not make an independent assessment of\nthe frivolousness of the challenge to S 441f as it should\nhave, the government does not challenge the lack of an\nindependent assessment here, and because the pending\ncriminal case awaits a determination of this action, we will\nreach the challenges to S 441f without remanding for such\na determination.\n\nAlthough not legally frivolous, Mariani's challenge to\nS 441b(a) fails. As we explain in detail, both the\nunderinclusiveness and outright ban challenges are\ninterred by the Supreme Court's jurisprudence in the area.\nSee especially Austin v. Mich. Chamber of Commerce, 494\n\n                                </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990), and Federal Election Comm'n v. Nat'l Right\nto Work Comm., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110819\"><a href=\"/opinion/110819/fec-v-national-right-to-work-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982). Although Mariani's\nfactual portrayal of the impact of soft money on\ncontemporary elections is impressive, it falls short. Section\n441b(a) is not fatally underinclusive under our precedents,\nbecause we cannot say that there is no meaningful\ndistinction between hard and soft money. We cannot\nexchange our robes for togas; any reform in this area must\nbe sought from Congress.\n\nFinally, we conclude that the challenge to S 441f is\npatently without merit. Accordingly we shall enter judgment\nin favor of the government.\n\nI. Procedural History\n\nIn October 1997, the United States filed an indictment\ncharging Mariani and several other individuals with, inter\nalia, violating the FECA. That action, United States v.\nMariani, No. 3:CR-97-225, is pending before the District\nCourt. The indictment charges that between August 1994\nand December 1996, Mariani and other officers and\nemployees of Empire Sanitary Landfill, Inc. (\"Empire\") and\nDanella Environmental Technologies, Inc. (\"Danella\")\nsolicited numerous employees of the corporations, as well\nas business associates, friends, and family members, to\nmake contributions to the campaigns of designated\ncandidates for federal election. According to the indictment,\nthese contributions were reimbursed either directly or\nindirectly by Empire. The indictment also alleges that\nMariani and other officers and employees at Empire and\nDanella made individual contributions to these federal\ncandidates, which were also reimbursed by Empire.\n\nMore particularly, the indictment alleges that in April\n1995, Mariani and other officers and employees of Empire\nand Danella contacted employees, associates, friends and\nfamily members in an effort to raise funds for the New\nJersey Steering Committee, a state fundraising arm of the\nRobert Dole campaign for President. Contributors allegedly\nwere asked to write personal checks in amounts of $1,000\n(or, in the case of couples, $2,000) and were reimbursed\nwith Empire corporate funds. It is also alleged that on April\n\n                               6\n\f29, 1995, Mariani and another defendant in the criminal\ncase, Michael Serafini, attended a Steering Committee\nluncheon at which they handed an envelope containing the\ncontributions to Dole campaign officials. When the Dole\ncampaign reported the contributions to the Federal Election\nCommission (\"FEC\"), its filing allegedly attributed these\n$80,000 worth of contributions to the individual\ncontributors, rather than to Empire. The Dole contributions\ncame approximately ten days prior to a vote in the Senate\non the Interstate Transportation of Municipal Waste bill, in\nwhich Empire and Danella were interested. Dole was the\nSenate majority leader at the time.\n\nThe indictment charges Mariani (and others) with\nviolations of 2 U.S.C. SS 441b(a) and 441f. Section 441b(a)\nof the FECA prohibits any corporation from making any\ncontribution in connection with any campaign for federal\noffice and renders it unlawful for any officer of a\ncorporation to consent to any prohibited corporate\ncontribution. Section 441f of the FECA, the conduit\ncontribution ban or \"anti-conduit\" provision, prohibits one\nfrom making a contribution \"in the name of another\nperson\" or \"knowingly permit[ting] his name to be used to\neffect such a contribution.\" 2 U.S.C. S 441f. Mariani moved\nto dismiss the FECA charges in the indictment and\nsimultaneously filed this action against the United States\nseeking declaratory relief pursuant to 2 U.S.C.S 437h. The\nFEC was granted leave to intervene as a defendant.\n\nSection 437h provides that\n\n       any individual eligible to vote in any election for the\n       office of President may institute such actions in the\n       appropriate district court of the United States,\n       including actions for declaratory judgment, as may be\n       appropriate to construe the constitutionality of any\n       provision of [FECA]. The district court immediately\n       shall certify all questions of constitutionality of this Act\n       to the United States court of appeals for the circuit\n       involved, which shall hear the matter sitting en banc.\n\n2 U.S.C. S 437h.1 The Supreme Court has construed S 437h\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. It is uncontested that Mariani meets the voter eligibility requirement.\n\n                               7\n\fso that, if a plaintiff brings a claim that is frivolous, a\ndistrict court may dismiss the case without certifying it. See\nCalifornia Med. Ass'n v. Federal Election Comm'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110551\"><a href=\"/opinion/110551/california-medical-assn-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193-94 n.14 (1981). The Supreme Court also has\ninterpreted S 437h to require the district court to develop a\nrecord and make findings of fact sufficient to allow the en\nbanc court of appeals to decide the constitutional issues.\nSee Bread Political Action Comm. v. Fed. Election Comm'n,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110665\"><a href=\"/opinion/110665/bread-political-action-committee-v-fec/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 580 (1982) (\"[T]he District Court, as required\nby S 437h, first made findings of fact and then certified the\ncase . . . .\"). The District Court concluded that the\nchallenge to S 441b(a) was not frivolous, and that the\ninterests of judicial economy \"militated against\" a separate\ndetermination that the challenge to S 441f was not\nfrivolous. See Mariani v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2565550\"><a href=\"/opinion/2565550/mariani-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n355 (M.D. Pa. 1999). The District Court then made\ncomprehensive findings and certified the challenge to this\nCourt.\n\nII. The District Court's Findings of Fact\n\nSome of the District Court's findings are disputed, are\nunsupported by proper evidence, or go beyond appropriate\nfact finding into legal conclusion. For example, an opinion\nexpressed by the New York Times Editorial page that one\nindividual's experiences with the Democratic National\nCommittee \"deepen the cynicism of Americans\" is not a\nproper evidentiary source for a finding that Americans have\nbecome more cynical about government as a result of the\nrole of soft money in the political system.2 See Mariani v.\nUnited States, 80 F. Supp.2d. 352, 412 (M.D. Pa. 1999).\nSimilarly, the very title of the segment of thefindings called\n\"Due to the Effects of Soft Money on the Political System,\nFECA is not Serving the Goals it was Intended to Serve,\" id.\nat 418, as well as the finding that \"[m]ost issue ads are\nfinanced in large part with soft money . . . from sources\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Johnny Chung, the individual referred to in the editorial, stated in an\ninterview with NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw that he was solicited to\nmake contributions to the Democratic National Committee in exchange\nfor invitations to meetings at which he could meet government officials\nand discuss business concerns.\n\n                               8\n\fand in amounts that the FECA was meant to prohibit,\" id.\nat 377, demonstrate that the fact-finding effort sometimes\nmetamorphosed into conclusions regarding the legal issues\nin this case. Id. at 418-19. Given the unique procedural\nposture of the case, we need not (and do not) defer to such\nfindings in our analysis. Although some of the District\nCourt's findings went beyond what was proper both as a\nmatter of evidence and by crossing the line into forming\nlegal conclusions, the court compiled an impressive factual\nshowing that soft money plays an increasingly large role in\nfederal elections.\n\nContributions made to or expenditures made on behalf of\ncandidates for federal elective office are referred to as \"hard\nmoney.\" Under S 441b(a), corporations are not permitted to\nmake contributions of hard money to campaigns for federal\noffice. Corporations can, however, make contributions to\npolitical parties in unlimited amounts. These contributions,\nwhich are referred to as \"soft money,\" can be used to fund\n\"issue advocacy.\" \"Issue advocacy\" includes advertisements\nor other campaign materials that advocate positions\nsupported by a candidate, often comparing those positions\nwith those of an opponent, without directly advocating the\nelection of the candidate. Donors of soft money are able to\navoid the FECA contribution limits and disclosure\nrequirements applicable to hard money and direct\nadvocacy. The amount of soft money contributed in each\nelection cycle has grown tremendously in the last two\ndecades, from about $19 million in 1980 to more than $260\nmillion in 1996.3 Soft money donations by the 544 largest\npublic and private companies more than tripled between\n1992 and 1996.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. During the 1995-96 election year cycle, the Republican national party\ncommittees (the Republican National Committee, the National\nRepublican Senatorial Committee, and the National Republican\nCongressional Committee) raised approximately $138.2 million in soft\nmoney and the Democratic national party committees (the Democratic\nNational Committee, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee,\nand the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee) raised\napproximately $123.9 million in soft money. (The term \"election cycle\"\nrefers to the period from January 1 of the year preceding the election\nthrough December 31 of the year during which the election occurs).\nCorporations were major contributors of these funds.\n\n                               9\n\fWith respect to Mariani's challenge, the parties agree on\nthe following facts. Candidates for federal elective office\nhelp their parties raise soft money. Candidates who raise\nlarge amounts of soft money often receive more support\nfrom their party than candidates who are less effective at\nraising soft money. Committee officials often act as\nintermediaries between donors and candidates.\n\nSoft money is used to fund (or partially fund) issue\nadvocacy that, on occasion, is hard to distinguish from\ndirect advocacy for a particular candidate for federal office.\nCampaigns sometimes coordinate with outside entities\nregarding these ads. These ads promote or criticize federal\ncandidates in order to influence the outcome of elections,\nalthough avoiding words of direct advocacy such as\"vote\nfor,\" \"elect,\" or \"defeat.\"4\n\nCorporations play an important role in campaignfinance.\nCandidates for federal elective office often know which\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. The following ads aired in the 1995-95 election cycle illustrate this\nproposition. The Republican National Committee financed the following\nad:\n\n       ANNOUNCER: Three years ago Bill Clinton gave us the largest tax\n       increase in history, including a 4 cent a gallon increase on\ngasoline.\n       Bill Clinton said he felt bad about it.\n\n       CLINTON: People in this room are still mad at me over the budget\n       because you think I raised your taxes too much. It might surprise\n       you to know I think I raised them too much, too.\n\n       ANNOUNCER: OK, Mr. President, We are surprised. So now,\n       surprise us again. Support Senator Dole's plan to repeal your gas\n       tax. And learn that actions . . . do speak louder than words.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee financed the following issue ad:\n\n       ANNOUNCER: American Values. Do our duty to our parents.\n       President Clinton protects Medicare. The Dole/Gingrich budget tried\n       to cut Medicare $270 Billion.\n\n       Protect families. President Clinton cut taxes for millions of\nworking\n       families. The Dole/Gingrich budget tried to raise taxes on 8\nmillion\n       of them. Opportunity. President Clinton proposes tax breaks for\n       tuition. The Dole/Gingrich budget tried to slash college\n       scholarships. Only President Clinton's plan meets our challenges,\n       protects our values.\n\f10\n\fcorporations are large contributors of soft money. Because\nthere are no limits on soft money contributions, soft money\nis easier to raise than hard money. Soft money\ncontributions of corporate treasury funds can result in\naccess (and thus a forum to express their interests) for\ncorporate officials to high government officials, including\nelected officials, as well as to candidates for federal elective\noffice. Large and repeat donors sometime get more access\nthan other donors, and donating soft money can be a more\neffective means for getting access than hard money.\nCorporate soft money contributions enable corporations to\nsome extent to circumvent the corporate hard money\ncontribution ban and support (indirectly) candidates for\nfederal elective office.\n\nCorporations are solicited for and give large sums of soft\nmoney in federal elections; according to reportsfiled with\nthe FEC, during the 1994 and 1998 election cycles,\ncorporations donated more than 50 percent of all itemized\nsoft money contributions. Additionally, in the 1995-95\nelection cycle, corporations in industries in which\nlegislation was contemplated gave large sums of soft money.\n\nIII. The Test for Frivolousness\n\nIn California Med. Ass'n v. Fed. Election Comm'n , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110551\"><a href=\"/opinion/110551/california-medical-assn-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193-94 n.14 (1981), the Supreme Court stated\nthat \"we do not construe S 437h to require certification of\nconstitutional claims that are frivolous.\" The Court cited\nwith approval a district court decision from an in forma\npauperis action that employed the standard from the in\nforma pauperis statute, 28 U.S.C. S 1915(e)(2)(B), to\ndetermine whether a challenge to FECA was frivolous. See\nid. at 193-94 n. 14 (citing Gifford v. Congress, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2302737\"><a href=\"/opinion/2302737/gifford-v-congress/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (E.D. Cal. 1978)). The in forma pauperis statute\nauthorizes a district court to dismiss sua sponte any action\nthat it determines to be legally frivolous. An action is not\nfrivolous under the statute where the complaint raises an\narguable question of law that ultimately will be resolved\nagainst the plaintiff. Neitzke v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112254\"><a href=\"/opinion/112254/neitzke-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 328\n(1989).

Act of August 19, 1911, 37 Stat. 25. The\n       Federal Corrupt Practices Act, passed in 1925,\n       extended the prohibition against corporate\n       contributions to include \"anything of value,\" and made\n       acceptance of a corporate contribution as well as the\n       giving of such a contribution a crime. 43 Stat. 1070.\n\n        The first restrictions on union contributions were\n       contained in the second Hatch Act, 54 Stat. 767\n       (1940), and later, in the War Labor Disputes Act of\n       1943, 57 Stat. 167, union contributions in connection\n       with federal elections were prohibited altogether. These\n       prohibitions on union political activity were extended\n       and strengthened in the Taft-Hartley Act, 61 Stat. 136\n       (1947), which broadened the earlier prohibition against\n       contributions to \"expenditures\" as well. Congress\n       codified most of these provisions in the Federal\n       Election Campaign Act of 1971, 86 Stat. 3, and\n       enacted later amendments in 1974, 88 Stat. 1263, and\n       in 1976, 90 Stat. 475.\n\nUnder Buckley v.

The first is whether the prohibition in\nS 441b(a) on contributions by corporations from corporate\ntreasuries to candidates for federal elective office is\nunconstitutional on its face. The second is whether the\nprohibition in S 441b(a) on contributions by corporations\nfrom corporate treasuries to candidates for federal office, in\nthe context of the presently existing law that otherwise\npermits corporations to expend unlimited amounts of\ncorporate funds to influence the outcome of federal\nelections (via soft money contributions), violates the First\nAmendment.\n\nA. The Constitutionality of S 441b(a) on its Face\n\nIn considering the $1,000 contribution limit at issue in\nBuckley, the Supreme Court stressed the importance of the\nright to association through support of the candidate of\none's choice:\n\n       [T]he primary first amendment problem raised by the\n       Act's contribution limitations is their restriction of one\n       aspect of the contributor's freedom of political\n       association . . .

Alabama , [357 U.S.]\n       at 460-461.\n\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 24-25 (internal citations partially\nomitted).\n\nNevertheless, the Court concluded that the $1,000 limit\nwas constitutional. The Court identified two principal\nreasons for upholding the limit. First, the Court recognized\na strong governmental interest in deterring corruption and\nthe appearance of corruption in campaign finance,\nparticularly from large contributions. Id. at 28; see also id.\nat 30 (\"Congress was justified in concluding that the\n\n                               15\n\finterest in safeguarding against the appearance of\nimpropriety requires that the opportunity for abuse\n\ninherent in the process of raising large monetary\ncontributions be eliminated.\"). Second, the Court concluded\nthat the $1,000 limit was narrowly tailored insofar as it still\npermitted individual donors to register their political\npreferences in a substantial way, reasoning that the\nexpressive value of the contribution lies in the act of\ncontributing rather than the amount given. See id. at 21.\nAccordingly, Buckley seems to leave open the question\nwhether an outright ban on campaign contributions--such\nas that found in S 441b(a)--would pass constitutional\nmuster.\n\nThe government and the FEC argue that, even if Buckley\nleft the door open for a constitutional challenge to an\noutright ban, Federal Election Comm'n v. National Right to\nWork Comm, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110819\"><a href=\"/opinion/110819/fec-v-national-right-to-work-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982) (hereinafter NRWC),\nslammed the door shut. In NRWC, the Supreme Court\naddressed indirectly the issue of limiting direct corporate\ncontributions to candidates. There, the Court upheld\nfederal restrictions upon corporate solicitation of campaign\nfunds from individuals found in a subsection ofS 441b-\n441b(b)(4)(c)--that prohibits nonstock corporations from\nsoliciting funds to be used for political purposes (through a\nseparate segregated fund) from people who are not\nmembers of the corporation. See id. at 198 n.1, 205-11.\n\nSubsection 441b(b)(4)(c) permits corporations to make\nlimited campaign contributions from separate segregated\nfunds solicited explicitly for that purpose. See id. at 201-02.\nIn upholding the statute, the Court suggested that\nCongress could prohibit direct contributions by\ncorporations to candidates for public office, stating that\n\n       The first purpose of S 441b, the government states, is\n       to ensure that substantial aggregations of wealth\n       amassed by the special advantages which go with the\n       corporate form of organization should not be converted\n       into political \"war chests\" which could be used to incur\n       political debts from legislators who are aided by the\n       contributions.

Moreover, the first purpose identified by the Court\n--limiting the effect of the advantage flowing from the\ncorporate form--could be met by a limit on contributions\nfrom corporate treasuries instead of a ban; and the second\npurpose could perhaps be addressed in corporate charters\nand state laws regulating corporations. Nevertheless, we\nfeel constrained to read NRWC, and the Court's statements\non NRWC in Nat'l Conservative PAC, as at least strong\nsuggestions that S 441b(a) is constitutional.\n\nAustin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112398\"><a href=\"/opinion/112398/austin-v-michigan-chamber-of-commerce/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1990), which upheld a Michigan statute that prohibited\ncorporations from using corporate funds for independent\nexpenditures in support of or in opposition to candidates\nfor state office, also implies that the flat ban in S 441b(a) is\nconstitutional. The analysis proceeds from Buckley, which\n\n                               17\n\fdistinguished independent expenditures from contributions:\n\"[A]lthough the Act's contribution and expenditure\nlimitations both implicate fundamental First Amendment\ninterests, its expenditure ceilings impose significantly more\nsevere restrictions on protected freedoms of political\nexpression and association than do its limitations on\nfinancial contributions.\" Buckley, 424 U.S. at 23. Austin\nupheld a ban on independent expenditures from the\ncorporate treasury because it found the ban sufficiently\nnarrowly tailored to the purpose of limiting the influence of\nthe unique state-conferred benefit of the corporate\nstructure, which allows corporations to amass large\ntreasuries. See Austin, 494 U.S. at 660-61. Because\nBuckley treats limits on independent expenditures as more\nsevere than limits on contributions, Austin suggests that a\nban on contributions from the corporate treasury also\nwould be constitutional if sufficiently narrowly tailored to\nachieve the goal.\n\nAustin also counsels that the ban on contributions from\nthe corporate treasury here is sufficiently narrowly tailored\nto the interest of limiting the influence of corporate\ntreasuries amassed under the state-conferred corporate\nstructure. Austin reasoned that the Michigan statute\nprohibiting independent expenditures by corporations was\nsufficiently narrowly tailored to its purpose because, by\npermitting corporations to make independent political\nexpenditures from separate segregated funds, it avoided an\nabsolute ban on all forms of corporate political spending.\nSee 494 U.S. at 660-61. The FECA also permits such\nindirect corporate political expenditures (via soft money),\nand under the teachings of Austin would thus seem to be\nsufficiently narrowly tailored to pass constitutional muster.\n\nWe are mindful that the flat ban on corporate\ncontributions has never been directly addressed by a\nholding of the Supreme Court, and that this issue involves\nimportant First Amendment values. Because of the strong\nimplication we draw from NRCW, Nat'l Conservative PAC,\nand Austin, however, we feel compelled to reject Mariani's\nfacial challenge to S 441b(a). It will be for the Supreme\nCourt itself to decide otherwise.\n\n                                18\n\fB. Section 441b(a) and Soft Money\n\nThe second challenge Mariani raises with respect to\nS 441b(a) is that the development of issue advocacy and the\nprevalence of soft money in campaigns for federal office has\nso eroded the theoretical distinction between hard and soft\nmoney that any justification for the ban on contributions\nfrom corporate treasuries has been vitiated. Mariani argues\nthat under present conditions the ban cannot advance a\ncompelling state interest and therefore must be invalidated.\nSignificantly, Mariani does not complain thatS 441b(a)\nitself fails to ban contributions from corporate treasuries.\nRather, he argues that under the FECA--as interpreted by\nthe Supreme Court and FEC regulations--it is possible for\ncorporations to accomplish through other means that\nwhich they cannot accomplish through direct contributions\nfrom corporate treasuries. Mariani contends that, by\nfunding soft money issue advocacy, contributors come so\nclose to accomplishing what they would accomplish by hard\nmoney campaign contributions that the two are basically\nindistinguishable in terms of the danger they pose of\ncorrupting the political process.\n\nThis contention amounts to an argument that S 441b(a)\ndoes too little by way of banning corporate political\nspending and is thereby fatally underinclusive. The\nSupreme Court has made clear, however, that Congress\ncan act incrementally in this and other areas. See Buckley,\n424 U.S. at 105 (\"[A] statute is not invalid under the\nconstitution because it might have gone farther than it\ndid.\") (citations omitted).

The First Amendment does not require the\ngovernment to curtail as much speech as may conceivably\nserve its goals.\").\n\nApplying this standard, section 441b(a) is not fatally\nunderinclusive. The regulation in Fed. Communications\nComm'n v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. at 397, which\nbanned editorial speech by station management, but not\neditorial control over the content of programs and guests on\nnews programs, was struck down because it did \"virtually\nnothing\" to prevent noncommercial stations from serving as\noutlets for expression of narrow partisan views. In contrast,\nS 441b(a) prevents corporations from donating hard money\nentirely. The important theoretical differences between hard\nand soft money, which include that a candidate cannot\ndirectly control how to spend soft money, are intended to\navoid the corrupting influence of large contributors\nsupporting a particular candidate. The practical\n\n                               20\n\fdistinctions between hard and soft money may have\ndiminished in the past decade with the rise of issue\nadvocacy, but not to such an extent that we can say that\nthere is no benefit from distinguishing between the two. If\nhard and soft money were equivalent, it would be hard to\nimagine why Mariani would have gone to the lengths he\nallegedly went to in order to give hard money instead of\nsoft.\n\nMariani attempts to counter this analysis by citing to\nUnited States v. Nat'l Treasury Employees Union, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117898\"><a href=\"/opinion/117898/united-states-v-national-treasury-employees-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995):\n\n       [w]hen the Government defends a regulation on speech\n       as a means to . . . prevent anticipated harms, it must\n       do more than simply `posit the existence of the disease\n       sought to be cured.' . . . It must demonstrate that the\n       recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that\n       the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a\n       direct and material way.\n\nId. at 475 (quoting Turner Broadcasting System v. Fed.\nCommunications Comm'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117869\"><a href=\"/opinion/117869/turner-broadcasting-system-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 664 (1994)). The\nunderinclusiveness analysis explicated above is not\ninconsistent with National Treasury Employees Union.\nCongress may regulate speech so long as it demonstrates\nthat the recited harms are real, and it may, consistent with\nthat principle, choose to regulate just some part of that\nspeech. The requirement that the regulation alleviate the\nharm in a direct and material way is not a requirement that\nit redress the harm completely. And in light of the broad\nlanguage in NRWC regarding the legitimacy of Congress's\npurpose in enacting S 441b(a), it is simply too late in the\nday to argue that Congress has failed to demonstrate that\nthe recited harms are real.\n\nCongress might well have concluded that direct\ncontributions from corporate treasuries were more\nimportant to regulate than expenditures or contributions\nmade through committees, because hard money can be\nused by a candidate in more and different ways than soft\nmoney. We note that no party to this case has argued that\nthere is no compelling government interest in banning\ncontributions from corporations. Indeed, Mariani's\n\n                               21\n\fargument that the rise of soft money fatally undermines the\npurpose of S 441b(a) seems to depend on the assumption\nthat limiting corporate contributions--if done effectively--\nwould be constitutionally valid.\n\nV. The Challenge to S 441f\n\nSection 441f provides that \"[n]o person shall make a\ncontribution in the name of another person or knowingly\npermit his name to be used to effect such a contribution,\nand no person shall knowingly accept a contribution made\nby one person in the name of another person.\" 2 U.S.C.\nS 441f. Mariani argues that the prohibition inS 441f on\ncontributions in the name of another to candidates for\nfederal elective office violates the First Amendment because\nit fails to advance any compelling state interest and\nbecause it is underinclusive since it only applies to\ncontributions of hard money (and can be circumvented by\ndonating soft money).\n\nThe Buckley Court accorded broad acceptance to the\nFECA's reporting and disclosure requirements, explaining\nthat they impose \"only a marginal restriction upon the\ncontributor's ability to engage in free communication.\"\nBuckley v. Valeo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21-22 (1976). Although\nacknowledging the dangers of compelled disclosure of\npolitical activity, the Court found that the governmental\ninterests in disclosure were of such magnitude that the\nrequirements passed the strict test established by NAACP v.\nAlabama, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105746\"><a href=\"/opinion/105746/naacp-v-alabama-ex-rel-patterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1958). The Court accepted as\ncompelling three purposes behind the disclosure\nrequirement: to provide the electorate with information as\nto where political campaign money comes from and how it\nis spent by the candidate in order to aid the voters in\nevaluating those who seek federal office; to deter actual or\napparent corruption; and to gather the data necessary to\ndetect violations of the contribution limits. Buckley, 424\nU.S. at 66-68.\n\nBuckley carefully considered the danger posed by\ncompelled disclosure. It held that the state interests\npromoted by the FECA's reporting and disclosure\nrequirements justified the indirect burden imposed on First\n\n                               22\n\fAmendment interests, and that the compelled disclosure\nrequirements were constitutional in the absence of a\n\"reasonable probability\" that disclosures would subject\ntheir contributors to \"threats, harassment, or reprisals.\" Id.\nat 74. Proscription of conduit contributions (with the\nconcomitant requirement that the true source of\ncontributions be disclosed) would seem to be at the very\ncore of the Court's analysis. In light of Buckley, we reject\nMariani's argument that S 441f fails to advance a\ncompelling state interest.\n\nWe also conclude that Congress's decision to limit the\ndisclosure requirement to contributions of hard money does\nnot make the requirement fatally underinclusive. Mariani's\nargument that the disclosure requirement is fatally\nunderinclusive is similar to his argument that S 441b(a) has\nbeen undermined by the rise of soft money. As with that\nchallenge, however, we conclude that Congress was free to\ndetermine that disclosure of hard money donations was the\nmost important form of disclosure, and to limit the\nregulation to that area.\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reject Mariani's challenges\nto SS 441b(a) and 441f. Judgment will be entered in favor of\nthe government.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               23\n\f</pre>",
