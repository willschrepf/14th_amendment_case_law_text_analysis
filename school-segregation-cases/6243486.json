Mordecai, Joshua K. Day, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA\nSCHOOL OF LAW, Charlottesville, Virginia, for Appellant. Trevor Stephen Cox,\nOFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF VIRGINIA, Richmond, Virginia, for\nAppellees. ON BRIEF: Stephen L. Braga, Appellate Litigation Clinic, UNIVERSITY\nOF VIRGINIA SCHOOL OF LAW, Charlottesville, Virginia, for Appellant.\n\fMark R. Herring, Attorney General, Stuart A. Raphael, Solicitor General,\nMatthew R. McGuire, Assistant Solicitor General, OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY\nGENERAL OF VIRGINIA, Richmond, Virginia, for Appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                                   2\n\fGREGORY, Chief Judge:\n\n       Paul Thompson, an inmate of the Virginia Department of Corrections (“VDOC”),\n\nbrings claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of his rights under the First\n\nAmendment, Eighth Amendment, and the Fourteenth Amendment by several current and\n\nformer VDOC officials. He also alleges violations of his rights under the Virginia\n\nConstitution by the Commonwealth of Virginia, the VDOC, and those same officials.\n\nClaims primarily stem from alleged retaliation by prison officials against Mr. Thompson\n\nfor filing grievances and lawsuits, most notably by giving him a “rough ride” in a prison\n\nvan. The district court below granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on\n\nall claims, relying in part on the doctrine of qualified immunity. We now affirm in part,\n\nreverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n                                             I.\n\n       At all relevant times, Appellant Mr. Paul C. Thompson 1 was an inmate at Deep\n\nMeadow Correctional Center (“DMCC”), which is run by the VDOC. The case largely\n\ncenters on whether two correctional officers, Officer Cooper and Officer Diming, gave\n\nMr. Thompson a so-called “rough ride” while transporting him in a van and whether\n\nother corrections officials responded inappropriately to the incident.\n\n      At around 7 a.m. on April 8, 2010, DMCC began transporting Mr. Thompson to\n\nattend a 9:30 a.m. proceeding at the Mecklenburg Circuit Court. Before departure,\n\n       1\n         We refer to Appellant Thompson as Mr. Thompson throughout in order to\ndistinguish him from VDOC official, Lt. R. Thompson (no relation).\n\n                                             3\n\fOfficers Diming and Cooper secured Mr. Thompson in handcuffs, leg irons, a belly\n\nchain, and a black box. 2\n\n      Diming and Cooper then placed Mr. Thompson in the second row of a van, which\n\nwas equipped with seatbelts. According to Mr. Thompson, neither officer secured Mr.\n\nThompson’s seatbelt, even though his restraints prevented him from doing so himself.\n\nMr. Thompson then specifically requested that his seatbelt be secured, but both Cooper\n\nand Diming refused. Cooper and Diming each averred that it was their usual practice to\n\nfasten inmates’ seatbelts and that they would not refuse seatbelt requests. However,\n\nneither officer recalled whether Mr. Thompson in fact had his seatbelt fastened or even\n\nmade such a request.\n\n      Once Mr. Thompson was in the van, Cooper took the wheel, with Diming in the\n\npassenger seat. They drove without incident, despite going on windy, sharply-curved\n\nroads, for about an hour and a half. By Mr. Thompson’s account, the van then made a\n\nshort stop at a convenience store and turned back around in the direction of DMCC.\n\nAccording to Cooper and Diming, they made no stops during the trip and began the\n\nreturn trip after receiving a phone call from DMCC that the court proceeding had been\n\ncancelled.\n\n\n\n       2\n         “A ‘black box’ is a hard plastic box placed over the lock apparatus that runs\nbetween the prisoner’s handcuffs which make it more difficult for a prisoner to tamper\nwith his handcuffs. A chain runs through the box and encircles the prisoner’s waist. The\nchain is tightened and then locked in back so that the prisoner’s hands, restrained by\nhandcuffs and the black box, are pulled against his stomach.” Peoples v. Davis, No. Civ.\nA. No. 08-252, 2009 WL 349171, at *2 (D.S.C. Feb. 10, 2009).\n\n                                           4\n\f      What happened on the return trip is vigorously disputed.          According to Mr.\n\nThompson, the officers intentionally drove the van in a way that caused him to be thrown\n\naround the cabin, and they took pleasure in doing so.           Cooper reportedly drove\n\nerratically, exceeding the speed limit and crossing the white and yellow traffic lines.\n\nBecause of Cooper’s excessive speed on the curved roads and the fact that Mr. Thompson\n\nwas not belted to his seat, Mr. Thompson was thrown around in the van from one side to\n\nthe other. The sudden stops and accelerations also caused Mr. Thompson to be thrown\n\nforwards and backwards. Meanwhile, Mr. Thompson’s restraints prevented him from\n\nprotecting himself from slamming against the walls of the van.          As a result, Mr.\n\nThompson’s head and upper body struck the steel mesh covering the windows, causing\n\nbleeding and bruising on his forehead, hands, and arms. Mr. Thompson repeatedly asked\n\nCooper to slow down and to drive carefully, informing both officers that he was getting\n\nhurt. Mr. Thompson also specifically asked Diming to intervene. However, Diming did\n\nnot take any action, even after Mr. Thompson had already sustained visible injuries.\n\n      In response to Mr. Thompson’s pleas, Cooper and Diming reportedly laughed and\n\ntaunted him. They said, “So you like to write grievances and take people to court, we\n\nknow how to deal with inmates . . . who create problems.”          J.A. 476.    Since Mr.\n\nThompson’s first arrival at DMCC less than six months earlier, he had filed at least 14\n\ncomplaints, primarily concerning access to the law library and to the notary.\n\n      Cooper and Diming joked about how scared Mr. Thompson looked and stated that\n\nthey were going to make his stay at DMCC a nightmare. Cooper eventually began\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\fdriving normally again. At some point, Diming called staff at DMCC, stating that Mr.\n\nThompson was banging his own head and being crazy.\n\n      Cooper and Diming, unsurprisingly, recounted an entirely different version of\n\nevents. By their telling, Cooper obeyed all traffic laws. When they were twenty minutes\n\naway from DMCC, Mr. Thompson started yelling, shouting profanities, and banging his\n\nhead on the metal mesh. Mr. Thompson then threatened the officers with lawsuits,\n\nsaying that he was going to claim they beat him up. Diming called the lieutenant on duty\n\nat DMCC, Lt. Thompson, and reported Mr. Thompson’s behavior.\n\n      Lt. Thompson reported that he heard Mr. Thompson screaming and yelling on\n\nspeaker-phone during the call. Another officer, K. James, stated that he heard, because\n\nthe call was on speaker-phone, Mr. Thompson yelling, “I am going to tell them you beat\n\nme up,” as well as thuds consistent with a head striking a window. J.A. 230.\n\n      Mr. Thompson’s physical injuries were documented after the ride. Photos were\n\ntaken, and Lt. Thompson observed a cut that appeared to be a half to three-quarters of an\n\ninch long on Mr. Thompson’s forehead. An injury report prepared by Cooper and\n\nDiming indicated that Mr. Thompson’s gash was cleaned and dressed, with no follow-up\n\ntreatment prescribed.\n\n      Mr. Thompson was referred to the prison psychologist for a mental health\n\nevaluation.   The psychologist, D. Lipscomb, observed Mr. Thompson crying as he\n\nrecounted the morning’s events. Mr. Thompson reportedly expressed concern for his\n\nsafety, said that he was “scared now[,]” because “they cause[d] [him] to bang [his] head,”\n\nand that the officers told him, “This will teach you to write grievances . . . [and] file\n\n                                            6\n\flitigation.” J.A. 451. According to the mental health report, Mr. Thompson also stated,\n\n“Don’t know if I can do this. Shouldn’t have to go through this shit. Now fucking crying\n\nlike a freaking baby.” J.A. 451.\n\n       Lt. Thompson issued a disciplinary charge against Mr. Thompson for “lying and\n\ngiving false information to an employee,” specifically for claiming that staff had\n\nassaulted him when his injuries were self-inflicted. J.A. 74, 212–214, 513. This resulted\n\nin pre-hearing detention, a disciplinary hearing before Hearing Officer Blackwell, and\n\nseven days’ isolation time (credited by pre-hearing detention).\n\n       In addition to the “rough ride,” Mr. Thompson also generally alleges that VDOC\n\nofficials,   including   Grievance   Coordinator   Seay,   Assistant   Warden    Jennings,\n\nOmbudsman White, and Major Lewis have denied him access to grievance procedures\n\nand to the law library and have rejected grievances without sufficient explanation or after\n\nexcessive delay.\n\n       In 2012, Mr. Thompson, acting pro se, filed a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action in the\n\nEastern District of Virginia, alleging violations of the First Amendment, Eighth\n\nAmendment, Fourteenth Amendment, and the Virginia Constitution. The suit named the\n\nCommonwealth of Virginia, the Virginia Department of Corrections, Warden\n\nBaskerville, Assistant Warden Jennings, Ombudsman White, Major Lewis, Captain\n\nDolan, Lt. Thompson, Grievance Coordinator Seay, Operations Officer Ware, Hearing\n\nOfficer Blackwell, and Officers Cooper and Diming.\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\f                                           II.\n\n       For clarity, we adopt Mr. Thompson’s summary of his claims, as referenced by the\n\ndistrict court:\n\n       Claim One. Defendants named are Baskerville, Jennings, Ware, Lewis,\n       Dolan, Thompson, Seay, Blackwell, White, Cooper and Diming. This is a\n       First Amendment retaliation claim. This claim encompasses more than the\n       transport incident on April 8, 2010, it involves Defendants’\n       actions/inactions prior to and after the transport;\n\n       Claim Two. Defendants named are Jennings, Dolan, Thompson, Cooper\n       and Diming. This is an Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment\n       claim, that relates directly to the transport incident on April 8, 2010;\n\n       Claim Three. Defendants named are Jennings, Dolan, Thompson, Cooper,\n       Diming, Lewis, Seay and Blackwell. This is a Fourteenth Amendment\n       claim involving violations of due process concerning the issuance of a false\n       charge, the hearing process, confinement in segregation, extended\n       confinement in segregation and conspiracy to cover up First and Eighth\n       Amendment violations;\n\n       Claim Four. Defendants named are Baskerville, Jennings, Ware, Lewis,\n       Dolan and White. This is a supervisory responsibility direct involvement\n       claim related to First, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment violations;\n\n       Claim Five. Defendants named are Commonwealth of Virginia, VDOC,\n       Baskerville, Jennings, Ware, Lewis, Dolan, Thompson, Seay, Blackwell,\n       White, Cooper and Diming. This is an Article I, Section 12, Virginia\n       Constitution violation involving harassment and retaliation for Plaintiff\n       exercising his First Amendment right;\n\n       Claim Six. Defendants named are Commonwealth of Virginia, VDOC,\n       Jennings, Dolan, Thompson, Cooper, and Diming. This is an Article I,\n       Section 9, Virginia Constitution violation related to the transport incident\n       on April 8, 2010; and\n\n       Claim Seven. Defendants named are Commonwealth of Virginia, VDOC,\n       Jennings, Seay, Blackwell, Dolan, Thompson, Lewis, Cooper and Diming.\n       This is an Article I, Section 11, Virginia Constitution violation involving\n       due process violations concerning the issuance of a false charge, hearing\n       process, confinement in segregation, extended confinement in segregation\n\n\n                                            8\n\f       and conspiracy to cover up First and Eighth Amendment violations\n       violating the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThompson v. Dolan, Civ. A. No. 12-209, 2015 WL 13065640, at *1 (E.D. Va. Aug. 10,\n\n2015). The district court granted summary judgment on all seven claims in favor of all\n\ndefendants.\n\n       This court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.             Lee v. Town of\n\nSeaboard, 863 F.3d 323, 327 (4th Cir. 2017). We ask “whether any genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact exist for the jury and if not, whether the district court erred in applying the\n\nsubstantive law.” Id. In doing so, we “view the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe nonmoving party.” Id. “To survive summary judgment, ‘there must be evidence on\n\nwhich the jury could reasonably find for the [nonmovant].’” Id. (quoting Anderson v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986)).\n\n       For the reasons below, we affirm the grant of summary judgment as to Claims\n\nThree and Four but reverse in part as to Claims One, Two, Five, Six, and Seven. Because\n\nClaim Two’s Eighth Amendment claim goes directly to the transport incident and is the\n\nfactual epicenter of this case, we address that claim first.\n\n\n\n                                              III.\n\n                                              A.\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment as to Mr. Thompson’s Eighth\n\nAmendment claim on qualified immunity grounds. To overcome the qualified immunity\n\ndefense at the summary judgment stage, the plaintiff must have shown facts that make\n\n\n                                               9\n\fout a violation of a constitutional right, and the right at issue must have been “clearly\n\nestablished” at the time of the defendant’s alleged misconduct. 3 Pearson v. Callahan,\n\n555 U.S. 223, 232, 236 (2009) (modifying Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194 (2001)). The\n\nanalysis takes place against the backdrop of two dueling interests: “the need to hold\n\npublic officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to\n\nshield officials from harassment, distraction, and liability when they perform their duties\n\nreasonably.” Id. at 231; Booker v. S.C. Dep’t of Corr., 855 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir. 2017).\n\n       As to the merits prong of the qualified immunity analysis, Mr. Thompson must\n\nshow a violation of the Eighth Amendment. The Eighth Amendment protects prisoners\n\nfrom “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.” Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 102\n\n(1976). That protection imposes on prison officials an affirmative “obligation to take\n\nreasonable measures to guarantee the safety of . . . inmates.” Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S.\n\n312, 319–20 (1986). However, not all Eighth Amendment violations are the same: some\n\nconstitute “deliberate indifference,” while others constitute “excessive force.” Id. at 319–\n\n20.\n\n       The deliberate indifference standard generally applies to cases alleging failures to\n\nsafeguard the inmate’s health and safety, including failing to protect inmates from attack,\n\n       3\n         Courts, including the Fourth Circuit, have pointed out a “special problem” that\narises when applying the qualified immunity analysis in an Eighth Amendment case.\nAppellees’ Br. at 19. Specifically, some courts skip the “clearly established” prong\nentirely upon finding deliberate indifference, because an officer’s knowing violation of\nthe law is per se unreasonable. See Cox v. Quinn, 828 F.3d 227, 238, n.4 (4th Cir. 2016)\n(raising issue and summarizing other courts’ approaches but declining to decide issue).\nHowever, as in Cox, we do not need to reach this issue because we hold that the clearly\nestablished prong is satisfied.\n\n                                            10\n\fmaintaining inhumane conditions of confinement, or failing to render medical assistance.\n\nSee Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994); Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 303\n\n(1991). The deliberate indifference standard is a two-pronged test: (1) the prisoner must\n\nbe exposed to “a substantial risk of serious harm,” and (2) the prison official must know\n\nof and disregard that substantial risk to the inmate’s health or safety. Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n\n834, 837–38.     In excessive force cases, on the other hand, courts must determine\n\n“whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or\n\nmaliciously and sadistically to cause harm.” Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 6–7\n\n(1992).\n\n       To properly evaluate a prisoner’s Eighth Amendment claim, courts ordinarily must\n\nchoose which standard to apply as to each defendant.            The two standards differ\n\nsignificantly, and importantly, deliberate indifference is not always easier to prove than\n\nexcessive force. While excessive force does require malicious intent, it does not require\n\nthat the prisoner victim suffer a “significant injury.”     McMillian, 503 U.S. at 9–10\n\n(“When prison officials maliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm,\n\ncontemporary standards of decency always are violated.”). Therefore, a prisoner who\n\nsuffers a minor, but malicious, injury may be able to prevail on an excessive force claim\n\nbut not on a deliberate indifference claim.\n\n      Under the second prong of qualified immunity, even if an official has violated an\n\ninmate’s constitutional right, he is still entitled to immunity if the right was not so\n\n“clearly established” that “a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing\n\nviolates that right.” Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 739 (2002) (citing Anderson v.\n\n                                              11\n\fCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987)). Ultimately, our inquiry is whether “the state of\n\nthe law [at the time of alleged conduct] gave fair warning that [the officer’s] alleged\n\ntreatment [of the prisoner] was unconstitutional.” Id. at 741.\n\n      To determine if the right in question was clearly established, we first look to cases\n\nfrom the Supreme Court, this Court of Appeals, or the highest court of the state in which\n\nthe action arose. Owens ex rel. Owens v. Lott, 372 F.3d 267, 279 (4th Cir. 2004). In the\n\nabsence of “directly on-point, binding authority,” courts may also consider whether “the\n\nright was clearly established based on general constitutional principles or a consensus of\n\npersuasive authority.” Booker, 855 F.3d at 543; Owens, 372 F.3d at 279 (“[T]he absence\n\nof controlling authority holding identical conduct unlawful does not guarantee qualified\n\nimmunity.”).\n\n      Courts must take care to define the right at an “appropriate level of specificity.”\n\nWilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 615 (1999).              Ordinarily, “the unlawfulness [of\n\ngovernment conduct] must be apparent” “in the light of pre-existing law.” White v.\n\nPauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, 552 (2017) (citing Creighton, 483 U.S. at 640); Safar v. Tingle,\n\n859 F.3d 241, 246 (4th Cir. 2017) (noting that court must identify precedent with\n\nsufficiently “similar circumstances” in order to find law is clearly established). However,\n\na “general constitutional rule . . . may apply with obvious clarity . . . even though the very\n\naction in question has not previously been held unlawful.” Hope, 536 U.S. at 741 (citing\n\nUnited States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 271 (1997)). Thus, “officials can still be on notice\n\nthat their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.” Id. at\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f741 (noting that prior cases need not have “fundamentally similar” or even “materially\n\nsimilar” facts).\n\n                                             B.\n\n       Mr. Thompson brings his Eighth Amendment claim against Officers Cooper and\n\nDiming, Lt. Thompson, Assistant Warden Jennings, and Captain Dolan. Only Cooper\n\nand Diming were directly involved in the transport incident as the driver and the occupant\n\nof the passenger seat, respectively. Mr. Thompson’s complaint against Lt. Thompson,\n\nJennings, and Dolan sounds in supervisory liability, alleging failures to ensure safe\n\ntransport and adherence to VDOC procedures.          The district court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of all five defendants after finding that Mr. Thompson’s right was not\n\nclearly established. Because we find that Mr. Thompson has shown facts making out a\n\nviolation of a clearly established right, we now reverse summary judgment and remand as\n\nto Officers Cooper and Diming.        However, because Mr. Thompson has not shown\n\nsufficient facts for supervisory liability, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in\n\nfavor of Lt. Thompson, Jennings, and Dolan.\n\n                                             1.\n\n       We first address whether Officer Cooper, the driver of the van, is entitled to\n\nqualified immunity under the two-step framework. We conclude (1) that Mr. Thompson\n\nhas presented sufficient facts for a reasonable jury to find that Cooper used excessive\n\nforce in violation of the Eighth Amendment and (2) that Mr. Thompson’s right not to be\n\nsubjected to such force was clearly established by April 8, 2010, the date of the incident.\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\f                                             a.\n\n       Although the district court seemed to assume without expressly deciding that\n\ndeliberate indifference was the correct standard to apply to Cooper’s alleged Eighth\n\nAmendment violation, McMillian requires application of the excessive force standard in\n\nthis case. See 503 U.S. at 6–7. McMillian held that the excessive force standard applied\n\nto an officer who punched an inmate during transport for no apparent reason. See id. at 4,\n\n6–7. Mr. Thompson essentially claims that Cooper applied force against him without any\n\nlegitimate purpose, albeit using the transport van’s momentum rather than a punch.\n\nThose facts do not materially distinguish McMillian. See id. Accordingly, we must\n\ndetermine whether, viewing the evidence in light most favorable to Mr. Thompson,\n\nOfficer Cooper used force “maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.” Id.\n\n       We evaluate whether Cooper acted maliciously or “wantonly” by applying a non-\n\nexclusive, four-factor balancing test:\n\n      (1) the need for the application of force;\n      (2) the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used;\n      (3) the extent of any reasonably perceived threat that the application of\n          force was intended to quell; and\n      (4) any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response.\n\nIko v. Shreve, 535 F.3d 225, 239 (4th Cir. 2008) (citing Whitley, 475 U.S. at 321). In Iko\n\nwe applied these factors to hold that a prison official used excessive force in violation of\n\nthe Eighth Amendment by applying pepper spray while removing an inmate from his cell\n\nbecause the official continued to spray even after the inmate attempted to comply. 535\n\nF.3d at 239–40, 243. As discussed below, at least three of the four factors require a\n\nsimilar conclusion here.\n\n                                            14\n\f       First, Officer Cooper never needed to use force on Mr. Thompson during the\n\ntransport. Unlike Iko, who initially refused to leave his cell as ordered, Mr. Thompson\n\ndid not disobey any instruction. In fact, the parties do not dispute that Mr. Thompson\n\nfully complied with all instructions at all times leading up to the alleged use of force. See\n\nid. at 231, 239–40. Moreover, there is no indication in the record that any use of force\n\nagainst Mr. Thompson during transport was justified. Accordingly, a reasonable jury\n\ncould credit Mr. Thompson’s affidavit and find that Officers Cooper and Diming’s intent\n\nwas malicious—to teach him a lesson for filing grievances. Such a motive, unsupported\n\nby any penological interest, is clearly not a legitimate basis for using force.\n\n       Second, because there was no need to use force, the force used was necessarily\n\nexcessive in relation to the need. In Iko, we held that the official’s use of force became\n\ndisproportionate once the prisoner began showing signs of compliance. 535 F.3d at 239–\n\n40. Here, since there was never a need, the use of force was disproportionate from start\n\nto finish. Moreover, even if Mr. Thompson disobeyed instructions, giving a prisoner a\n\nso-called “rough ride” in a van does not constitute an acceptable means of securing\n\ncompliance. Cf. id. at 239 (noting that officers are trained to use pepper spray and that\n\npepper spray is allowed for purposes of removing inmates under department’s Use of\n\nForce Directive). To use force in this manner is a peculiarly cruel means of punishment,\n\nas a “rough ride” is designed to place the victim in fear for his life. Not only is the\n\nprisoner not able to protect himself, but motor vehicles, unlike a controlled spray or direct\n\napplications of force, are not designed for use as a means of securing compliance or\n\notherwise subduing a prisoner. The momentum from the van is not susceptible to precise\n\n                                              15\n\fcalibration such that only the amount of force justified by the circumstances is actually\n\ndeployed.    The prospect that neither the victim nor the officer can prevent an\n\ninstantaneous escalation to a life-or-death situation instills terror.         A “rough ride”\n\ntherefore bears no relationship to any penological need to use force, and even standing\n\nalone, its sheer cruelty and impropriety suggest a constitutional violation.\n\n       Third, Officers Cooper and Diming do not even assert that Mr. Thompson posed a\n\nthreat to anyone. In Iko, the prisoner posed a minimal threat—he had even lain down on\n\nthe ground before the officer sprayed him the final time. Id. Here, the officers do not,\n\nand cannot, argue that Mr. Thompson presented any kind of physical threat, as he was\n\nfully restrained with shackles, handcuffs, and a black box. Moreover, he never verbally\n\nthreatened the officers with violence and was never hostile in any way. Mr. Thompson’s\n\nonly threat, the officers concede, was the threat of future litigation.\n\n       Finally, the fourth factor, concerning efforts to temper the use of force, is a draw at\n\nbest. In contrast to Iko, where prison officials failed to provide any medical attention\n\nafter applying the pepper spray, Cooper and Diming did secure medical assistance upon\n\ntheir return to DMCC. But, they never secured Mr. Thompson’s seatbelt, even after he\n\nwas injured, and they fueled Mr. Thompson’s fear for his safety by taunting and\n\nthreatening him. Even assuming this factor weighs in the government’s favor, it alone\n\ncannot preclude the conclusion that Mr. Thompson has alleged a constitutional violation.\n\nTo hold otherwise would allow prison officials to escape liability in excessive force cases\n\nsimply by rendering medical assistance after the fact.\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\f      The extent of Mr. Thompson’s injury is not one of the relevant factors and does\n\nnot, contrary to the government’s suggestion, preclude a violation of the Eighth\n\nAmendment. Of course, the Eighth Amendment does not prohibit a de minimis use of\n\nforce that is not itself “repugnant to the conscience of mankind.” McMillian, 503 U.S. at\n\n9–10 (citing Whitley, 475 U.S. at 327). But when use of force is malicious or repugnant,\n\na plaintiff need not suffer anything significant to establish an excessive force claim.\n\nThus, in McMillian, the Supreme Court reversed the Fifth Circuit for rejecting an\n\nexcessive force claim solely because the inmate had not suffered a “significant injury.”\n\n503 U.S. at 4–5. The Court explained:\n\n      When prison officials maliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm,\n      contemporary standards of decency always are violated. This is true\n      whether or not significant injury is evident. Otherwise, the Eighth\n      Amendment would permit any physical punishment, no matter how diabolic\n      or inhuman, inflicting less than some arbitrary quantity of injury. Such a\n      result would have been as unacceptable to the drafters of the Eighth\n      Amendment as it is today.\n\nId. at 9–10 (citing Whitley, 475 U.S. at 327; Estelle, 429 U.S. at 102) (emphasis added).\n\nThe excessive force analysis thus focuses on the maliciousness of the force used, not the\n\nseverity of the injury that results from that force. Wilkins v. Gaddy, 559 U.S. 34, 38\n\n(2010) (“An inmate who is gratuitously beaten by guards does not lose his ability to\n\npursue an excessive force claim merely because he has the good fortune to escape\n\nwithout serious injury.”). Here, the momentum from the van was sufficient to cause a\n\ngash on Mr. Thompson’s forehead, bleeding from his hands and arms and bruising, not to\n\nmention significant emotional distress. The force alleged is therefore beyond de minimis\n\nfor Eighth Amendment purposes. See id. at 9 (force not de minimis when sufficient to\n\n                                           17\n\fcause bruising, swelling, loosened teeth); see also Wilkins, 559 U.S. at 35, 40 (force\n\nsufficient to cause bruising, lower back pain, migraines, dizziness, and mental anguish\n\nnot de minimis).\n\n       The cases cited by the government and the district court do not support a contrary\n\nholding. For example, Jabbar v. Fischer merely held that failure to provide inmates with\n\nseatbelts, “standing alone,” is not an Eighth Amendment violation. See 683 F.3d 54, 57\n\n(2d Cir. 2012) (noting no intent to punish and distinguishing reckless-driving case).\n\nOther cases are similarly inapplicable because their facts do not involve a prison official\n\nacting with malicious intent. See Spencer v. Knapheide Truck Equipment Co., 183 F.3d\n\n902, 907–08 (8th Cir. 1999) (no evidence suggesting intent to punish); Carrasquillo v.\n\nCity of New York, 324 F. Supp. 2d 428, 436 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (car accident due to\n\nnegligence); Cooks v. Crain, 327 F. App’x 493, 493 (5th Cir. 2009) (general failure to\n\ninstall seatbelts on transport vehicles); Smith v. Sec’y For Dep’t of Corr., 252 F. App’x\n\n301, 303–04 (11th Cir. 2007) (failure to seatbelt without dangerous driving); Dexter v.\n\nFord Motor Co., 92 F. App’x 637, 640–41 (10th Cir. 2004) (failure to seatbelt standing\n\nalone); Vinson v. U.S. Marshals Serv., Civ. A. No. 10-79, 2011 WL 3903199, at *5\n\n(D.S.C. Sept. 2, 2011) (negligent driving and failure to seatbelt do not rise to Eighth\n\nAmendment violation), aff’d, 459 F. App’x 221 (4th Cir. 2011); Young v. Dep’t of Corr.,\n\nCiv. A. No. 04-10309, 2007 WL 2214520, at *6 (E.D. Mich. July 27, 2007) (no evidence\n\nof intent to injure or punish); Jones v. Collins, Civ. A. No. 05-663, 2006 WL 1528882, at\n\n*2 (S.D. Ill. June 1, 2006) (negligent failure to secure seatbelt).\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\f       Because Mr. Thompson has alleged facts from which a reasonable factfinder could\n\nconclude that Officer Cooper maliciously subjected him to a rough ride, he has\n\nsufficiently alleged an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim sufficient to survive\n\nsummary judgment as to Cooper.\n\n                                             b.\n\n       We further hold that Mr. Thompson’s right was clearly established by April 8,\n\n2010, the date of the incident. Defined at the appropriate level of specificity, prisoners\n\nhave a right not to be assaulted by their captors. Under the Eighth Amendment, prisoners\n\nhave the right to be free from malicious or penologically unjustified infliction of pain and\n\nsuffering. Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 346 (1981) (“Among ‘unnecessary and\n\nwanton’ inflictions of pain are those that are ‘totally without penological justification.’”)\n\n(citing Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 183 (1976); Estelle, 429 U.S. at 103). This\n\nprinciple applies with particular force when inmates have not engaged in wrongdoing, are\n\nrestrained and compliant and posing no physical threat. Further, no reasonable officer\n\nwould think that violently tossing a prisoner around in a moving vehicle is an acceptable\n\nmeans of punishment even if the prisoner had engaged in wrongdoing. After examining\n\nboth controlling and persuasive authority, we conclude that Officer Cooper had fair\n\nwarning that gratuitously giving an inmate a “rough ride” for no reason other than to\n\nretaliate against him for filing lawsuits and grievances is unconstitutional.\n\n       A reasonable officer would have known from Supreme Court precedent that the\n\nEighth Amendment prohibits such malicious acts of violence or intentional\n\nendangerment. In McMillian, one of the seminal cases defining the scope of the right not\n\n                                             19\n\fto be subjected to excessive force, the Supreme Court reversed the dismissal of an Eighth\n\nAmendment claim based on a correctional officer’s gratuitous punch of an inmate during\n\ntransport. See 503 U.S. at 4, 12. In Wilkins, a prison official, angered by the prisoner’s\n\nrequest for a grievance form, slammed the prisoner against the ground and physically\n\nbeat him in response. 559 U.S. at 35, 37 (citing and reaffirming McMillian, 503 U.S. at\n\n9). The Supreme Court reversed the district court’s dismissal of the case for failure to\n\nstate a claim and held that the prisoner would prevail if he proved that the official had in\n\nfact acted maliciously. See id. at 40. As in Wilkins, if we credit Mr. Thompson’s\n\naccount, the only reason Cooper used force against him was in retaliation for filing\n\ngrievances. Accordingly, Wilkins and McMillian are sufficiently similar to Cooper’s\n\nalleged conduct that a reasonable officer would have known that a retaliatory “rough\n\nride” is unconstitutional.\n\n       To be sure, McMillian and Wilkins involved direct punches and kicks, rather than a\n\n“rough ride,” but it makes no difference to the constitutional analysis whether Mr.\n\nThompson was slammed against the side of the van by the officer’s hands or by the\n\nmomentum maliciously created by the officer’s driving. See Brown v. Fortner, 518 F.3d\n\n552, 560–62 (8th Cir. 2008) (holding that prisoner’s right not to be endangered by\n\ndangerous driving while unbuckled was clearly established despite lack of published\n\nauthority on those specific facts). The intentionally erratic driving was simply a different\n\nmeans of effectuating the same constitutional violation. To draw a line between these\n\nacts would encourage bad actors to invent creative and novel means of using unjustified\n\nforce on prisoners.     Although McMillian and Wilkins did not reach the qualified\n\n                                            20\n\fimmunity question, their holdings provide officers with fair notice that malicious,\n\nunprovoked, unjustified force inflicted on inmates who are compliant and restrained, and\n\nviolates the Eighth Amendment.       In other words, the Eighth Amendment principle\n\nprohibiting such gratuitous violence applies with “obvious clarity” to a malicious “rough\n\nride,” just as it does to a malicious direct blow. See Hope, 536 U.S. at 741.\n\n      Indeed, two Eighth Circuit cases have held that malicious “rough rides” violate the\n\nEighth Amendment. See Fortner, 518 F.3d at 560–62; Brown v. Morgan, 39 F.3d 1184,\n\n*1 (8th Cir. 1994) (unpublished).         Although these cases applied the deliberate\n\nindifference standard, they provided notice to Cooper, because deliberate indifference has\n\na lower intent requirement, and, as discussed infra, the injuries here suffice for a\n\ndeliberate indifference claim.     Fortner and Morgan both involved officers who\n\nknowingly refused to fasten a prisoner’s seatbelt, drove recklessly, and refused the\n\nprisoner’s pleas to slow down. See Fortner, 518 F.3d at 556, 560–62 (denying qualified\n\nimmunity); Morgan, 39 F.3d at *1 (finding deliberate indifference). In Fortner, the\n\nprisoner, like Mr. Thompson, was fully shackled with chains, handcuffs, and a black box\n\nsuch that he could not secure his own seatbelt or brace himself if necessary. Id. The\n\ndriver ignored the prisoner’s pleas to stop speeding and eventually caused a car accident.\n\nId. Here, Cooper apparently speeded around curves and crossed white and yellow traffic\n\nlines, generating enough force to bruise and injure Mr. Thompson. 4 Mr. Thompson not\n\n\n\n       4\n        Appellees argue that Mr. Thompson’s allegations of reckless driving are too\nconclusory to be considered. Appellees’ Br. at 28. However, they are virtually identical\n\n                                            21\n\fonly asked Cooper to slow down, as Brown did in Fortner, but also indicated that he had\n\nalready been injured. Similarly, in Morgan, the driver took pleasure in the prisoner’s fear\n\nand asked, “Are you scared?” before increasing his speed. 39 F.3d at *1. In Mr.\n\nThompson’s case, Cooper laughed at him and taunted him for being scared, before stating\n\nhis intent to teach him a lesson. Cooper’s conduct therefore went even further than what\n\nwas considered unacceptable in Fortner and Morgan, as Cooper not only disregarded a\n\nserious risk of harm, but apparently intended such harm to result. See Whitley, 475 U.S.\n\nat 320 (suggesting that malicious intent is more culpable than mere indifference by\n\nlimiting liability to intentional misconduct).    Given the factual parallels, the Eighth\n\nCircuit cases are powerful indicators that the officers here had fair notice. Cf. Pauly, 137\n\nS. Ct. at 552 (reversing denial of qualified immunity because court failed to identify case\n\nwith similar circumstances and no general principle applies with obvious clarity).\n\n      Although few circuits have addressed specifically an officer’s use of a vehicle to\n\ninjure an inmate, there is a clear consensus among the circuits, including the Fourth, that\n\ninfliction of pain and suffering without penological justification violates the Eighth\n\nAmendment in an array of contexts. Simply put, there are many ways of physically and\n\nmaliciously assaulting a helpless prisoner, and all of them violate the Eighth Amendment.\n\n\n\n\nto the statements credited by the Eighth Circuit in Fortner, and we conclude that they are\nsufficiently specific here. See 518 F.3d at 559.\n\n                                            22\n\f      The First Circuit denied summary judgment as to an excessive force claim against\n\nofficers who beat a detainee for requesting permission to finish his meal. Massey v. Rufo,\n\n14 F.3d 44, *2–3 (1st Cir. 1994) (unpublished) (reversing summary judgment).\n\n      The Second Circuit has held that retaliating against inmates for taking over a\n\nprison after order had been restored would violate the Eighth Amendment. See Blyden v.\n\nMancusi, 186 F.3d 252, 258–60, 265, n.6 (2d Cir. 1999) (affirming jury instructions to\n\nthat effect); Al-Jundi v. Mancusi, 926 F.2d 235, 240 (2d Cir. 1991). The court has also\n\nconcluded that handcuffing a prisoner for hours without any apparent reason constitutes\n\nan unnecessary infliction of pain. Johnson v. Testman, 380 F.3d 691, 698, n.6 (2d Cir.\n\n2004); see also Powell v. Schriver, 175 F.3d 107, 115 (2d Cir. 1999) (holding that\n\nunnecessary disclosure of prisoner’s HIV and transsexual status subjected prisoner to\n\nunnecessary risk of harm).\n\n      The Third Circuit has held that “[n]o reasonable officer could agree that striking\n\nand kicking a subdued, nonresisting inmate in the side . . . was reasonable or necessary\n\nunder established law.” Giles v. Kearney, 571 F.3d 318, 326–28 (3d Cir. 2009); see also\n\nMcDowell v. Sheerer, 374 F. App’x 288, 293 (3d Cir. 2010) (“[B]y 2004, it was\n\nestablished that an officer may not . . . use gratuitous force against an inmate who has\n\nbeen subdued.”).\n\n      This court, in Iko, held that using pepper spray on an inmate after he began\n\ncomplying with instructions violated the Eighth Amendment.         535 F.3d at 239–40.\n\nSimilarly, we have held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits using water hoses, billy\n\nclubs, and tear gas against an inmate who was locked in a cell and posed no threat to the\n\n                                           23\n\fprison officials. Slakan v. Porter, 737 F.2d 368, 372 (4th Cir. 1984) (“The unjustified\n\nstriking or beating of a prisoner by police or correctional officials constitutes cruel and\n\nunusual punishment which is actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.”).\n\n      In the words of the Fifth Circuit, “[w]e have little difficulty concluding that in\n\n2009 . . . it was well-established . . . that officers may not ‘use gratuitous force against a\n\nprisoner who has already been subdued . . . [or] incapacitated.’ Reasonable officers had\n\nfair notice that [punching and using mace on a non-resisting inmate] violated [the] right\n\nto be free from excessive force.” Cowart v. Erwin, 837 F.3d 444, 449–50, 454–55 (5th\n\nCir. 2016) (holding that law was clearly established as of 2009). The Fifth Circuit also\n\nhas held that a prison official would “obviously” exceed the protection of qualified\n\nimmunity if he incentivized other inmates to attack the plaintiff. See Davis v. Tucker,\n\n322 F. App’x 369, 370 (5th Cir. 2009) (dismissing claim because inmate had not adduced\n\nsufficient evidence to support claim).\n\n      Likewise, the Sixth Circuit has “long recognized that a spontaneous assault by a\n\nprison guard on an inmate is grounds for an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim.”\n\nColey v. Lucas Cty., Ohio, 799 F.3d 530, 535, 539–40 (6th Cir. 2015) (clearly established\n\nas of 2004); Pelfrey v. Chambers, 43 F.3d 1034, 1035, 1037 (6th Cir. 1995)\n\n(spontaneously cutting off inmate’s hair to scare him and to reinforce dominance violated\n\nEighth Amendment); Moore v. Holbrook, 2 F.3d 697, 700–01 (6th Cir. 1993) (inmate’s\n\nallegations that he was handcuffed and beaten by prison guards would constitute valid\n\nEighth Amendment claim).\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\f      In the Seventh Circuit, qualified immunity does not protect an officer who strikes\n\nan inmate and slams him against a cell for asking a question. Hill v. Shelander, 992 F.2d\n\n714, 715, 718–19 (7th Cir. 1993). The court stated in Hill that “an unprovoked assault” is\n\nnot within “the shadow of legal uncertainty.” Id. (citing Whitley, 475 U.S. at 319). The\n\nSeventh Circuit has also extended the bar against unnecessary infliction of pain and\n\nsuffering to strip searches that are conducted solely to harass a prisoner, as well as to\n\nintentional, gratuitous denials of medication. E.g., Rodriguez v. Plymouth Ambulance\n\nServ., 577 F.3d 816, 828–29 (7th Cir. 2009) (holding that intentionally denying or\n\ndelaying access to medical care would violate Eighth Amendment); Calhoun v. DeTella,\n\n319 F.3d 936, 939 (7th Cir. 2003) (holding that otherwise lawful strip-search becomes\n\nunconstitutional if conducted in manner intended to humiliate and cause psychological\n\npain). If a prison guard may not allow an inmate to suffer a deterioration in health\n\ncondition without any legitimate penological interest, it seems reasonably clear that a\n\nprison guard cannot then directly injure and harm an inmate’s health and wellbeing\n\nthrough physical force without justification.\n\n      The Eighth Circuit has held that intentionally endangering inmates, such as by\n\nexposing them to attack by other inmates, as punishment for filing lawsuits is an\n\n“appalling” violation of the Eighth Amendment. Irving v. Dormire, 519 F.3d 441, 447–\n\n48, (8th Cir. 2008).\n\n      The Ninth Circuit has held that McMillian clearly established a right to be free\n\nfrom unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain and that officers violated this right by\n\nbeating and using a Taser on a non-resisting inmate, including after he was handcuffed\n\n                                            25\n\ffollowing a disturbance. Martinez v. Stanford, 323 F.3d 1178, 1180, 1183–84 (9th Cir.\n\n2003) (reversing grant of summary judgment).\n\n      According to the Tenth Circuit, “an inmate has a constitutional right to be secure\n\nin her bodily integrity and free from attack by prison guards.” Hovater v. Robinson, 1\n\nF.3d 1063, 1068 (10th Cir. 1993) (case of sexual abuse by prison guard).\n\n      Finally, the Eleventh Circuit has held that:\n\n      The law of excessive force in this country is that a prisoner cannot be\n      subjected to gratuitous or disproportionate force that has no object but to\n      inflict pain. This is so whether the prisoner is in a cell, prison yard, police\n      car, in handcuffs on the side of the road, or in any other custodial setting.\n      The use of force must stop when the need for it to maintain or restore\n      discipline no longer exists. Long before the defendants acted, the law was\n      clearly established that correctional officers could not use force maliciously\n      or sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\n\nSkrtich v. Thornton, 280 F.3d 1295, 1304–05 (11th Cir. 2002) (citing Whitley, 475 U.S.\n\n320–21) (holding that beating prisoner after he was incapacitated by electric shock\n\nconstituted excessive force) (emphasis added).\n\n       As is apparent from the case law of eleven federal courts of appeals, the Eighth\n\nAmendment protection against the malicious and sadistic infliction of pain and suffering\n\napplies in a diverse range of factual scenarios. That unifying thread provides fair notice\n\nto prison officials that they cannot, no matter their creativity, maliciously harm a prisoner\n\non a whim or for reasons unrelated to the government’s interest in maintaining order.\n\nThat principle applies with particular clarity to cases such as this one, where the victim is\n\nrestrained, compliant, and incapable of resisting or protecting himself, and otherwise\n\npresents no physical threat in any way.\n\n\n                                             26\n\f      The government argues, unpersuasively, that the law is not clearly established\n\nbecause courts have not found a constitutional violation in some failure-to-fasten-seatbelt\n\ncases, notwithstanding the Eighth Circuit precedent. However, with one exception, every\n\nother seatbelt case cited by the district court and the government involved mere\n\nnegligence, rather than malice or even recklessness. See, e.g., Jabbar, 683 F.3d at 57;\n\nSpencer, 183 F.3d at 907-08; Crain, 327 F. App’x at 493; Smith, 252 F. App’x at 304;\n\nDexter, 92 F. App’x at 640–41. The one exception is Young, an unpublished district\n\ncourt case that involved reckless driving. 2007 WL 2214520, at *6. However, Young\n\ntook place before Fortner was published, and the district court erred by relying purely on\n\nnegligence cases without recognizing the heightened risk of reckless or malicious\n\nendangerment. See id. at 5–6. Moreover, even Young distinguished its facts from a case\n\nwhere the driver drives with the intent to scare an inmate or refuses pleas to slow down.\n\nId. Instead, all cases that have squarely dealt with intentional misconduct have found an\n\nEighth Amendment violation.\n\n      The government also argues, unpersuasively, that an official’s wrongful intent is\n\nnever relevant to the qualified immunity analysis, even in the context of an Eighth\n\nAmendment deliberate indifference or excessive force claim. See Appellees’ Br. at 31.\n\nThe government cites Crawford-El v. Britton for the sweeping proposition that, under\n\nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1982), “[e]vidence concerning the defendant’s\n\nsubjective intent is simply irrelevant.” Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 589 (1998).\n\nCrawford-El’s holding is much more limited and is not itself a decision on qualified\n\nimmunity. See 523 U.S. at 589 (holding that plaintiff may pursue ordinary discovery into\n\n                                            27\n\fofficial’s intent for claims having intent element notwithstanding irrelevance of intent to\n\nqualified immunity defense). Read in context, the Court was merely referring to and\n\nreiterating Harlow’s holding that “‘bare allegations of malice’ cannot overcome the\n\nqualified immunity defense.” Id. (quoting Harlow, 457 U.S. at 817–18).\n\n       Crawford-El and Harlow do not forbid us from considering evidence of intent in\n\nMr. Thompson’s excessive force claim. Harlow did not involve an Eighth Amendment\n\nexcessive force claim or a deliberate indifference claim. See 457 U.S. at 817–18 (suit\n\nagainst presidential aides for recommending plaintiff’s firing in bad faith). As Crawford-\n\nEl itself recognized, the significance of evidence of intent differs when it “is an essential\n\ncomponent of the plaintiff’s affirmative case.” See 523 U.S. at 588–90.\n\n       For claims where intent is an element, an official’s state of mind is a reference\n\npoint by which she can reasonably assess conformity to the law because the case law is\n\nintent-specific.   Considering evidence of intent in this manner is not foreclosed by\n\nCrawford-El, as the Supreme Court itself has applied the clearly established prong in\n\nreference to retaliatory intent. See Ortiz v. Jordan, 562 U.S. 180, 189–91 (2011) (holding\n\nthat law was clearly established that prison guard cannot retaliate against inmate by\n\nputting her in solitary confinement) (citing Crawford-El, 523 U.S. at 592).\n\n       Thus, in light of the Supreme Court precedent in McMillian and Wilkins, case law\n\non “rough rides” from our sister circuit, and the overwhelming consensus on the\n\nprisoner’s right to be free from assault, i.e., malicious infliction of pain and suffering, we\n\nconclude that Officer Cooper had fair warning that his actions were unconstitutional and\n\nthat Mr. Thompson’s right was therefore clearly established. Accordingly, we reverse the\n\n                                             28\n\fdistrict court’s determination that Officer Cooper is entitled to qualified immunity on the\n\nEighth Amendment excessive force claim.\n\n                                             2.\n\n       As to Officer Diming, we agree with the district court that Mr. Thompson has\n\n“presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact” as to deliberate\n\nindifference but disagree that his right to reasonable protection from assault was not\n\nclearly established as of April 8, 2010. See Thompson, 2015 WL 13065640, at *8.\n\n                                             a.\n\n       Given the differences in the roles that Officer Cooper and Officer Diming played\n\nduring the van ride, we hold that deliberate indifference is the correct standard to apply to\n\nOfficer Diming. Mr. Thompson’s affidavits show that Diming refused to buckle his\n\nseatbelt, ignored his pleas for help, failed to intervene to stop Cooper’s unlawful use of\n\nforce, and instead verbally taunted and harassed him. Unlike Cooper, who drove the van,\n\nDiming did not use unlawful force against Mr. Thompson—rather, he failed to do\n\nanything to stop it. Accordingly, the claim against Diming is functionally the same as\n\nclaims in failure-to-protect or conditions-of-confinement cases, which are evaluated\n\nunder the deliberate indifference standard. 5 See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834; Wilson, 501\n\n\n       5\n         Applying the deliberate indifference standard would also create symmetry with\nthe test used to establish bystander liability, which is similar in principle to what Mr.\nThompson alleges against Diming. See Randall v. Prince George’s Cty., Md., 302 F.3d\n188, 204 (4th Cir. 2002) (“[A]n officer may be liable under § 1983, on a theory of\nbystander liability, if he: (1) knows that a fellow officer is violating an individual’s\nconstitutional rights; (2) has a reasonable opportunity to prevent the harm; and (3)\nchooses not to act.”).\n\n                                             29\n\fU.S. at 303. To survive summary judgment, Mr. Thompson must show facts sufficient\n\nfor a reasonable factfinder to conclude that (1) he was exposed to a “substantial risk of\n\nserious harm” and (2) Diming “kn[ew] of and disregard[ed]” that risk. Farmer, 511 U.S.\n\nat 834, 837–38.\n\n       First, there are sufficient facts for a reasonable jury to conclude that Mr.\n\nThompson was exposed to a “substantial risk of serious harm.” An inmate need not show\n\nthat she in fact suffered serious harm to prevail on this prong because “the Eighth\n\nAmendment protects against future harm.” Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33–34\n\n(1993). Courts have “plainly recognized that a remedy for unsafe conditions need not\n\nawait a tragic event.” Id. Viewing the facts in light most favorable to Mr. Thompson,\n\nthere was a substantial risk that he would suffer serious harm: he was fully shackled,\n\nunable to brace himself for impact, and sitting without a seatbelt, in a vehicle that was\n\nspeeding and being driven in a way intended to scare and injure him, by a driver who\n\nrefused both his requests to be seatbelted and to slow down. See Fortner, 518 F.3d at\n\n559–60; Morgan, 39 F.3d 1184, at *1. In this case, the risk to Mr. Thompson was even\n\ngreater than the risk involved in Fortner and Morgan, as neither of the drivers in those\n\ncases specifically intended to cause injury.\n\n      In arguing to the contrary, the government points to Vinson, an unpublished case\n\nfrom the District of South Carolina that involved an unfastened seatbelt and negligent\n\ndriving. See 2011 WL 3903199 (finding no substantial risk of harm). But the court in\n\nVinson distinguished its facts from those of Fortner, where the Eighth Circuit found an\n\nEighth Amendment violation, because the Vinson plaintiff had not alleged reckless\n\n                                               30\n\fdriving with specificity, such as by citing speeding and driving over boundary lines. See\n\nVinson v. U.S. Marshals Serv., Civ. A. No. 10-79, 2011 WL 3903057, at *9 (D.S.C. July\n\n29, 2011), report and recommendation adopted, 2011 WL 3903199 (D.S.C. Sept. 2,\n\n2011). The plaintiff in Vinson made only conclusory statements of recklessness and did\n\nnot allege that the defendant taunted him or ignored his requests to slow down. Id.\n\nBecause the facts in this case are virtually identical to those that the court in Vinson\n\ndistinguished, Vinson cannot support a grant of summary judgment here. Other cases\n\ncited by the government and the district court are similarly inapplicable to the facts of\n\nthis case. See, e.g., Jabbar, 683 F.3d at 57 (failure to seatbelt standing alone); Spencer,\n\n183 F.3d at 907–08 (no-seatbelt policy and driver without intent to harm); Crain, 327 F.\n\nApp’x at 493 (failure to install seatbelts); Smith, 252 F. App’x at 304 (no dangerous\n\ndriving); Dexter, 92 F. App’x at 640–41 (failure to seatbelt standing alone); Young, 2007\n\nWL 2214520, at *5–6 (distinguishing cases where driver ignored pleas to stop and had\n\npurpose of harming passenger); Jones 2006 WL 1528882, at *1 (negligent driving);\n\nOliver v. Georgia Dep’t of Corr., Civ. A. No. 06-320, 2006 WL 3086792, at *2 (M.D.\n\nGa. Oct. 27, 2006) (negligence and failure to install seatbelts). In sum, we conclude that\n\nFortner and Morgan are more persuasive in determining a substantial risk of harm\n\nbecause they bear greater factual similarities to this case. See Fortner, 518 F.3d at 559–\n\n60; Morgan, 39 F.3d 1184, at *1.\n\n      Under the second prong of deliberate indifference, we must determine whether\n\nDiming subjectively knew of and disregarded the substantial risk of harm to Mr.\n\nThompson. Although this element is subjective, a deliberately indifferent state of mind\n\n                                            31\n\fcan be proven through “inference from circumstantial evidence.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n\n842. A prison official is deliberately indifferent if “the official is present at the time of an\n\nassault and fails to intervene or otherwise act to end the assault.” Raynor v. Pugh, 817\n\nF.3d 123, 128 (4th Cir. 2016) (quoting Williams v. Mueller, 13 F.3d 1214, 1216 (8th Cir.\n\n1994)). However, prison officials are not liable if taking action would endanger their\n\nown lives or if the harm occurred despite their reasonable efforts to prevent it. Id.; Cox,\n\n828 F.3d at 236. “But ‘completely failing to take any action’ to stop an ongoing assault\n\non a prisoner can amount to deliberate indifference.” Raynor, 817 F.3d at 128 (quoting\n\nWinfield v. Bass, 106 F.3d 525, 532 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc)); see Odom v. S.C. Dep’t of\n\nCorr., 349 F.3d 765, 773 (4th Cir. 2003) (“[A] correctional officer who stands by as a\n\npassive observer and takes no action whatsoever to intervene during an assault violates\n\nthe [Eighth Amendment] rights of the victim inmate.”).\n\n       We conclude that a reasonable jury could find that Officer Diming subjectively\n\nknew of the serious risk to Mr. Thompson’s safety. In Odom, this court held that prison\n\nofficials violated the Eighth Amendment for failing to take any steps to protect an inmate\n\nfrom a known attack. 349 F.3d at 767. There, the court found that the prison officer was\n\naware of the risk that the inmate, Odom, would be attacked because Odom (1) had\n\nwarned the officer, (2) had pleaded for help as the attack was happening, and (3) was\n\nexperiencing the attack in the officer’s presence. Id. Here, Mr. Thompson informed\n\nDiming that his seatbelt was unfastened, but Diming ignored the request to buckle it,\n\ncontrary to his normal practice. In addition, Mr. Thompson informed Diming of his\n\nconcerns for his safety when Cooper began driving erratically, and Cooper’s erratic\n\n                                              32\n\fdriving of course took place in Diming’s presence. Diming was also demonstrably aware\n\nof Mr. Thompson’s concerns for his safety, as he apparently mocked him for being\n\nscared. While it is unclear whether Diming, Cooper, or both indicated to Mr. Thompson\n\nthat the “rough ride” was intended to teach him a lesson, one could infer that Diming, at\n\nminimum, heard that threat.     Diming was also aware that Mr. Thompson had been\n\ninjured, having called the prison to report that Mr. Thompson had banged his head.\n\nThese facts lead to the inescapable conclusion that Diming was aware of the risk to Mr.\n\nThompson created by Cooper.\n\n      We also conclude that a reasonable jury could find that Diming disregarded a\n\nknown risk of harm by failing to take any reasonable steps to prevent Mr. Thompson\n\nfrom being hurt. In Odom, the officer rejected the inmate’s pleas to be let out of the cell\n\nwhere he was being attacked. Id. at 767–68. Indeed, he took no action until after the\n\nvictim had suffered broken ribs. Id. In this case, Diming exhibited a similar pattern of\n\ndisregard in the face of escalating risks to Mr. Thompson’s safety. Diming initially\n\ndismissed Mr. Thompson’s request for a seatbelt. He then dismissed Mr. Thompson’s\n\nfear of injury and taunted him. Even after Mr. Thompson was visibly injured and began\n\nbleeding, Diming took no action, whether to ask Cooper to slow down or to finally secure\n\nMr. Thompson’s seatbelt. Moreover, there was nothing that prevented Diming from\n\nreasonably taking at least some steps to protect Mr. Thompson. A reasonable factfinder\n\ncould therefore conclude that Diming was aware of a risk to Mr. Thompson’s safety,\n\ncertainly by the time Mr. Thompson was injured, if not earlier, and that Diming\n\nconsciously disregarded that risk by failing to intervene. See Raynor, 817 F.3d at 128.\n\n                                            33\n\f      In sum, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Thompson, he has\n\nalleged sufficient facts to satisfy both prongs of the deliberate indifference test. He\n\nadequately asserts that he was exposed to the substantial risk of harm of being physically\n\ntossed about in an erratic vehicle and that Diming was aware of that risk and disregarded\n\nit by failing to take any preventative measures.\n\n                                             b.\n\n      The only remaining question is whether Mr. Thompson’s right to reasonable\n\nprotection from a known threat was clearly established as of April 8, 2010, the date of the\n\nincident. As before, we first look to controlling authority in the relevant jurisdiction,\n\nspecifically cases from the Supreme Court, this Court of Appeals, or the highest court of\n\nthe state in which the action arose. Owens, 372 F.3d at 279. We conclude that Mr.\n\nThompson’s right was clearly established.\n\n      Odom held that, by June 2000, it was clearly established in the Fourth Circuit that\n\n“a correctional officer who stands by as a passive observer and takes no action\n\nwhatsoever to intervene during an assault violates the rights of the victim inmate.” 349\n\nF.3d at 773 (denying qualified immunity). Reasonable officials would understand Odom\n\nto mean that inmates have an Eighth Amendment right to be protected from malicious\n\nattacks, not just by other inmates, but also from the very officials tasked with ensuring\n\ntheir security. See Hope, 536 U.S. at 739 (“[C]ontours [of the right] must be sufficiently\n\nclear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that\n\nright.”). Similarly, the Supreme Court has held that the law was “not in controversy,”\n\neven in 1996, that a prison official could be liable for failing to protect a female inmate\n\n                                            34\n\ffrom subsequent sexual assault if he were aware of a prior incident. See Ortiz, 562 U.S.\n\nat 189. That understanding is consistent with and buttressed by the related doctrine of\n\nbystander liability, which imposes on officers “an affirmative duty to intervene to protect\n\nthe constitutional rights of citizens from infringement by other law enforcement officers.”\n\nRandall, 302 F.3d at 203 (2002 decision concerning actions in 2000); see also Skrtich,\n\n280 F.3d at 1301 (“[A]n officer who is present at the scene and who fails to take\n\nreasonable steps to protect the victim of another officer’s use of excessive force can be\n\nheld personally liable for his nonfeasance.”) (applying bystander liability to corrections\n\nofficer); Hovater, 1 F.3d at 1068 (recognizing inmate’s right to be protected from known\n\nrisk of sexual assault by prison guard).\n\n      Because controlling authority clearly establishes an inmate’s right to reasonable\n\nprotection from malicious assault, we look no further and conclude that Mr. Thompson’s\n\nright was clearly established in this case. Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s\n\ngrant of qualified immunity to Officer Diming.\n\n                                            3.\n\n       Mr. Thompson’s Eighth Amendment claim also attempts to reach Lt. Thompson,\n\nAssistant Warden Jennings, and Captain Dolan. However, Mr. Thompson’s appellate\n\nbrief and argument do not address their liability, nor are there any facts that show how\n\nany of the three officials were aware of any risk to Mr. Thompson or how any of their\n\nactions contributed to his injuries. Accordingly, we summarily affirm the district court’s\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of these three defendants.\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\f                                            IV.\n\n       We now turn to Claim One, which is Mr. Thompson’s First Amendment\n\nretaliation claim. He alleges that Defendants Baskerville, Jennings, Ware, Lewis, Dolan,\n\nLt. Thompson, Seay, Blackwell, White, Cooper and Diming violated his First\n\nAmendment rights by retaliating against him before, during, and after the April 8, 2010\n\nincident.\n\n       We summarily affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of\n\nBaskerville, Jennings, Ware, Lewis, Dolan, Lt. Thompson, Seay, Blackwell, and White\n\nbecause Mr. Thompson has failed to show any facts that could support an inference that\n\nthe above officials were aware of his past litigation and grievances or that they acted with\n\nretaliatory intent.\n\n       However, we reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment as to Cooper\n\nand Diming because the record supports an inference that they were acting in response to\n\nMr. Thompson being a frequent filer of grievances and litigation. In deciding to grant\n\nsummary judgment, the district court relied in part on Adams v. Rice, 40 F.3d 72 (4th Cir.\n\n1994). However, since the issuance of the district court’s decision, this Court clarified\n\nthe scope of Adams in Booker. See 855 F.3d at 541–42. On remand, the district court\n\nshould proceed in light of this intervening authority.\n\n\n\n                                             V.\n\n       We now turn to Claim Three, which is Mr. Thompson’s due process claim against\n\nJennings, Dolan, Lt. Thompson, Cooper, Diming, Lewis, Seay and Blackwell. He alleges\n\n                                             36\n\fthat the defendants conspired to cover up the transport incident and provided a sham\n\ndisciplinary hearing that was the basis for his being held in segregation.\n\n       We summarily affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment as to all\n\ndefendants because administrative segregation from the general population does not\n\nimplicate a protected liberty interest absent a showing of specific facts that conditions of\n\nconfinement are significantly more onerous. Incumaa v. Stirling, 791 F.3d 517, 531 (4th\n\nCir. 2015). Mr. Thompson’s affidavits do not present specific facts demonstrating such\n\nhardship. To the extent that Mr. Thompson alleges that segregation was retaliatory\n\npunishment, that argument is better addressed under either the First or Eighth\n\nAmendment.\n\n\n\n                                            VI.\n\n       We now turn to Claim Four, Mr. Thompson’s supervisory liability claim against\n\nBaskerville, Jennings, Ware, Lewis, Dolan and White.            The district court granted\n\nsummary judgment as to all defendants. Thompson, 2015 WL 13065640, at *10.\n\n       We summarily affirm because Mr. Thompson only makes conclusory allegations\n\nwithout any specific facts that these defendants had knowledge that retaliation was taking\n\nplace and that they acquiesced in the retaliatory acts. See Randall, 302 F.3d at 206.\n\n\n\n                                            VII.\n\n       We now turn to Claims Five, Six, and Seven, which are Mr. Thompson’s state law\n\nclaims. All three claims are in federal court on the basis of supplemental jurisdiction.\n\n                                             37\n\fThompson, 2015 WL 13065640, at *10.                 The district court declined to exercise\n\njurisdiction and dismissed all three claims because the federal claims, which served as the\n\nanchor for the state-law claims, had already been dismissed. Id.\n\n       Since we reverse summary judgment as to some of the anchoring federal claims,\n\nwe now reverse the district court’s decision to dismiss the state law claims and remand\n\nfor further proceedings.\n\n\n\n                                            VIII.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we reverse summary judgment as to Officers Cooper\n\nand Diming on the Eighth Amendment and First Amendment claims; we reverse the\n\ndistrict court’s dismissal of the state law claims; we affirm the grant of summary\n\njudgment as to all other claims and as to all other defendants; and we remand for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                             AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART,\n                                               AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS\n\n\n\n\n                                             38\n\f",

Mordecai, Joshua K. Day, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA\nSCHOOL OF LAW, Charlottesville, Virginia, for Appellant. Trevor Stephen Cox,\nOFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF VIRGINIA, Richmond, Virginia, for\nAppellees. ON BRIEF: Stephen L. Braga, Appellate Litigation Clinic, UNIVERSITY\nOF VIRGINIA SCHOOL OF LAW, Charlottesville, Virginia, for Appellant.\n\fMark R. Herring, Attorney General, Stuart A. Raphael, Solicitor General,\nMatthew R. McGuire, Assistant Solicitor General, OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY\nGENERAL OF VIRGINIA, Richmond, Virginia, for Appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                                   2\n\fGREGORY, Chief Judge:\n\n       Paul Thompson, an inmate of the Virginia Department of Corrections (“VDOC”),\n\nbrings claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of his rights under the First\n\nAmendment, Eighth Amendment, and the Fourteenth Amendment by several current and\n\nformer VDOC officials. He also alleges violations of his rights under the Virginia\n\nConstitution by the Commonwealth of Virginia, the VDOC, and those same officials.\n\nClaims primarily stem from alleged retaliation by prison officials against Mr. Thompson\n\nfor filing grievances and lawsuits, most notably by giving him a “rough ride” in a prison\n\nvan. The district court below granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on\n\nall claims, relying in part on the doctrine of qualified immunity. We now affirm in part,\n\nreverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n                                             I.\n\n       At all relevant times, Appellant Mr. Paul C. Thompson 1 was an inmate at Deep\n\nMeadow Correctional Center (“DMCC”), which is run by the VDOC. The case largely\n\ncenters on whether two correctional officers, Officer Cooper and Officer Diming, gave\n\nMr. Thompson a so-called “rough ride” while transporting him in a van and whether\n\nother corrections officials responded inappropriately to the incident.\n\n      At around 7 a.m. on April 8, 2010, DMCC began transporting Mr. Thompson to\n\nattend a 9:30 a.m. proceeding at the Mecklenburg Circuit Court. Before departure,\n\n       1\n         We refer to Appellant Thompson as Mr. Thompson throughout in order to\ndistinguish him from VDOC official, Lt. R. Thompson (no relation).\n\n                                             3\n\fOfficers Diming and Cooper secured Mr. Thompson in handcuffs, leg irons, a belly\n\nchain, and a black box. 2\n\n      Diming and Cooper then placed Mr. Thompson in the second row of a van, which\n\nwas equipped with seatbelts. According to Mr. Thompson, neither officer secured Mr.\n\nThompson’s seatbelt, even though his restraints prevented him from doing so himself.\n\nMr. Thompson then specifically requested that his seatbelt be secured, but both Cooper\n\nand Diming refused. Cooper and Diming each averred that it was their usual practice to\n\nfasten inmates’ seatbelts and that they would not refuse seatbelt requests. However,\n\nneither officer recalled whether Mr. Thompson in fact had his seatbelt fastened or even\n\nmade such a request.\n\n      Once Mr. Thompson was in the van, Cooper took the wheel, with Diming in the\n\npassenger seat. They drove without incident, despite going on windy, sharply-curved\n\nroads, for about an hour and a half. By Mr. Thompson’s account, the van then made a\n\nshort stop at a convenience store and turned back around in the direction of DMCC.\n\nAccording to Cooper and Diming, they made no stops during the trip and began the\n\nreturn trip after receiving a phone call from DMCC that the court proceeding had been\n\ncancelled.\n\n\n\n       2\n         “A ‘black box’ is a hard plastic box placed over the lock apparatus that runs\nbetween the prisoner’s handcuffs which make it more difficult for a prisoner to tamper\nwith his handcuffs. A chain runs through the box and encircles the prisoner’s waist. The\nchain is tightened and then locked in back so that the prisoner’s hands, restrained by\nhandcuffs and the black box, are pulled against his stomach.” Peoples v. Davis, No. Civ.\nA. No. 08-252, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">349171</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (D.S.C. Feb. 10, 2009).\n\n                                           4\n\f      What happened on the return trip is vigorously disputed.          According to Mr.\n\nThompson, the officers intentionally drove the van in a way that caused him to be thrown\n\naround the cabin, and they took pleasure in doing so.           Cooper reportedly drove\n\nerratically, exceeding the speed limit and crossing the white and yellow traffic lines.\n\nBecause of Cooper’s excessive speed on the curved roads and the fact that Mr. Thompson\n\nwas not belted to his seat, Mr. Thompson was thrown around in the van from one side to\n\nthe other. The sudden stops and accelerations also caused Mr. Thompson to be thrown\n\nforwards and backwards. Meanwhile, Mr. Thompson’s restraints prevented him from\n\nprotecting himself from slamming against the walls of the van.          As a result, Mr.\n\nThompson’s head and upper body struck the steel mesh covering the windows, causing\n\nbleeding and bruising on his forehead, hands, and arms. Mr. Thompson repeatedly asked\n\nCooper to slow down and to drive carefully, informing both officers that he was getting\n\nhurt. Mr. Thompson also specifically asked Diming to intervene. However, Diming did\n\nnot take any action, even after Mr. Thompson had already sustained visible injuries.\n\n      In response to Mr. Thompson’s pleas, Cooper and Diming reportedly laughed and\n\ntaunted him. They said, “So you like to write grievances and take people to court, we\n\nknow how to deal with inmates . . . who create problems.”          J.A. 476.    Since Mr.\n\nThompson’s first arrival at DMCC less than six months earlier, he had filed at least 14\n\ncomplaints, primarily concerning access to the law library and to the notary.\n\n      Cooper and Diming joked about how scared Mr. Thompson looked and stated that\n\nthey were going to make his stay at DMCC a nightmare. Cooper eventually began\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\fdriving normally again. At some point, Diming called staff at DMCC, stating that Mr.\n\nThompson was banging his own head and being crazy.\n\n      Cooper and Diming, unsurprisingly, recounted an entirely different version of\n\nevents. By their telling, Cooper obeyed all traffic laws. When they were twenty minutes\n\naway from DMCC, Mr. Thompson started yelling, shouting profanities, and banging his\n\nhead on the metal mesh. Mr. Thompson then threatened the officers with lawsuits,\n\nsaying that he was going to claim they beat him up. Diming called the lieutenant on duty\n\nat DMCC, Lt. Thompson, and reported Mr. Thompson’s behavior.\n\n      Lt. Thompson reported that he heard Mr. Thompson screaming and yelling on\n\nspeaker-phone during the call. Another officer, K. James, stated that he heard, because\n\nthe call was on speaker-phone, Mr. Thompson yelling, “I am going to tell them you beat\n\nme up,” as well as thuds consistent with a head striking a window. J.A. 230.\n\n      Mr. Thompson’s physical injuries were documented after the ride. Photos were\n\ntaken, and Lt. Thompson observed a cut that appeared to be a half to three-quarters of an\n\ninch long on Mr. Thompson’s forehead. An injury report prepared by Cooper and\n\nDiming indicated that Mr. Thompson’s gash was cleaned and dressed, with no follow-up\n\ntreatment prescribed.\n\n      Mr. Thompson was referred to the prison psychologist for a mental health\n\nevaluation.   The psychologist, D. Lipscomb, observed Mr. Thompson crying as he\n\nrecounted the morning’s events. Mr. Thompson reportedly expressed concern for his\n\nsafety, said that he was “scared now[,]” because “they cause[d] [him] to bang [his] head,”\n\nand that the officers told him, “This will teach you to write grievances . . . [and] file\n\n                                            6\n\flitigation.” J.A. 451. According to the mental health report, Mr. Thompson also stated,\n\n“Don’t know if I can do this. Shouldn’t have to go through this shit. Now fucking crying\n\nlike a freaking baby.” J.A. 451.\n\n       Lt. Thompson issued a disciplinary charge against Mr. Thompson for “lying and\n\ngiving false information to an employee,” specifically for claiming that staff had\n\nassaulted him when his injuries were self-inflicted. J.A. 74, 212–214, 513. This resulted\n\nin pre-hearing detention, a disciplinary hearing before Hearing Officer Blackwell, and\n\nseven days’ isolation time (credited by pre-hearing detention).\n\n       In addition to the “rough ride,” Mr. Thompson also generally alleges that VDOC\n\nofficials,   including   Grievance   Coordinator   Seay,   Assistant   Warden    Jennings,\n\nOmbudsman White, and Major Lewis have denied him access to grievance procedures\n\nand to the law library and have rejected grievances without sufficient explanation or after\n\nexcessive delay.\n\n       In 2012, Mr. Thompson, acting pro se, filed a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action in the\n\nEastern District of Virginia, alleging violations of the First Amendment, Eighth\n\nAmendment, Fourteenth Amendment, and the Virginia Constitution. The suit named the\n\nCommonwealth of Virginia, the Virginia Department of Corrections, Warden\n\nBaskerville, Assistant Warden Jennings, Ombudsman White, Major Lewis, Captain\n\nDolan, Lt. Thompson, Grievance Coordinator Seay, Operations Officer Ware, Hearing\n\nOfficer Blackwell, and Officers Cooper and Diming.\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\f                                           II.\n\n       For clarity, we adopt Mr. Thompson’s summary of his claims, as referenced by the\n\ndistrict court:\n\n       Claim One. Defendants named are Baskerville, Jennings, Ware, Lewis,\n       Dolan, Thompson, Seay, Blackwell, White, Cooper and Diming. This is a\n       First Amendment retaliation claim. This claim encompasses more than the\n       transport incident on April 8, 2010, it involves Defendants’\n       actions/inactions prior to and after the transport;\n\n       Claim Two. Defendants named are Jennings, Dolan, Thompson, Cooper\n       and Diming. This is an Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment\n       claim, that relates directly to the transport incident on April 8, 2010;\n\n       Claim Three. Defendants named are Jennings, Dolan, Thompson, Cooper,\n       Diming, Lewis, Seay and Blackwell. This is a Fourteenth Amendment\n       claim involving violations of due process concerning the issuance of a false\n       charge, the hearing process, confinement in segregation, extended\n       confinement in segregation and conspiracy to cover up First and Eighth\n       Amendment violations;\n\n       Claim Four. Defendants named are Baskerville, Jennings, Ware, Lewis,\n       Dolan and White. This is a supervisory responsibility direct involvement\n       claim related to First, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment violations;\n\n       Claim Five. Defendants named are Commonwealth of Virginia, VDOC,\n       Baskerville, Jennings, Ware, Lewis, Dolan, Thompson, Seay, Blackwell,\n       White, Cooper and Diming. This is an Article I, Section 12, Virginia\n       Constitution violation involving harassment and retaliation for Plaintiff\n       exercising his First Amendment right;\n\n       Claim Six. Defendants named are Commonwealth of Virginia, VDOC,\n       Jennings, Dolan, Thompson, Cooper, and Diming. This is an Article I,\n       Section 9, Virginia Constitution violation related to the transport incident\n       on April 8, 2010; and\n\n       Claim Seven. Defendants named are Commonwealth of Virginia, VDOC,\n       Jennings, Seay, Blackwell, Dolan, Thompson, Lewis, Cooper and Diming.\n       This is an Article I, Section 11, Virginia Constitution violation involving\n       due process violations concerning the issuance of a false charge, hearing\n       process, confinement in segregation, extended confinement in segregation\n\n\n                                            8\n\f       and conspiracy to cover up First and Eighth Amendment violations\n       violating the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThompson v.

We ask “whether any genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact exist for the jury and if not, whether the district court erred in applying the\n\nsubstantive law.” Id. In doing so, we “view the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe nonmoving party.” Id. “To survive summary judgment, ‘there must be evidence on\n\nwhich the jury could reasonably find for the [nonmovant].’” Id.

Because\n\nClaim Two’s Eighth Amendment claim goes directly to the transport incident and is the\n\nfactual epicenter of this case, we address that claim first.\n\n\n\n                                              III.\n\n                                              A.\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment as to Mr. Thompson’s Eighth\n\nAmendment claim on qualified immunity grounds. To overcome the qualified immunity\n\ndefense at the summary judgment stage, the plaintiff must have shown facts that make\n\n\n                                               9\n\fout a violation of a constitutional right, and the right at issue must have been “clearly\n\nestablished” at the time of the defendant’s alleged misconduct. 3 Pearson v. Callahan,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145918\"><a href=\"/opinion/145918/pearson-v-callahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 232, 236 (2009) (modifying Saucier v.

The\n\nanalysis takes place against the backdrop of two dueling interests: “the need to hold\n\npublic officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to\n\nshield officials from harassment, distraction, and liability when they perform their duties\n\nreasonably.” Id. at 231; Booker v.

The Eighth Amendment protects prisoners\n\nfrom “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.” Estelle v. Gamble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102\n\n(1976). That protection imposes on prison officials an affirmative “obligation to take\n\nreasonable measures to guarantee the safety of . . . inmates.” Whitley v. Albers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319–20 (1986). However, not all Eighth Amendment violations are the same: some\n\nconstitute “deliberate indifference,” while others constitute “excessive force.” Id. at 319–\n\n20.\n\n       The deliberate indifference standard generally applies to cases alleging failures to\n\nsafeguard the inmate’s health and safety, including failing to protect inmates from attack,\n\n       3\n         Courts, including the Fourth Circuit, have pointed out a “special problem” that\narises when applying the qualified immunity analysis in an Eighth Amendment case.\nAppellees’ Br. at 19. Specifically, some courts skip the “clearly established” prong\nentirely upon finding deliberate indifference, because an officer’s knowing violation of\nthe law is per se unreasonable. See Cox v. Quinn, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 238, n.4 (4th Cir. 2016)\n(raising issue and summarizing other courts’ approaches but declining to decide issue).\nHowever, as in Cox, we do not need to reach this issue because we hold that the clearly\nestablished prong is satisfied.\n\n                                            10\n\fmaintaining inhumane conditions of confinement, or failing to render medical assistance.\n\nSee Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 834 (1994); Wilson v.

The deliberate indifference standard is a two-pronged test: (1) the prisoner must\n\nbe exposed to “a substantial risk of serious harm,” and (2) the prison official must know\n\nof and disregard that substantial risk to the inmate’s health or safety. Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n\n834, 837–38.     In excessive force cases, on the other hand, courts must determine\n\n“whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or\n\nmaliciously and sadistically to cause harm.” Hudson v. McMillian, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112693\"><a href=\"/opinion/112693/hudson-v-mcmillian/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6–7\n\n(1992).\n\n       To properly evaluate a prisoner’s Eighth Amendment claim, courts ordinarily must\n\nchoose which standard to apply as to each defendant.            The two standards differ\n\nsignificantly, and importantly, deliberate indifference is not always easier to prove than\n\nexcessive force. While excessive force does require malicious intent, it does not require\n\nthat the prisoner victim suffer a “significant injury.”     McMillian, 503 U.S. at 9–10\n\n(“When prison officials maliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm,\n\ncontemporary standards of decency always are violated.”). Therefore, a prisoner who\n\nsuffers a minor, but malicious, injury may be able to prevail on an excessive force claim\n\nbut not on a deliberate indifference claim.\n\n      Under the second prong of qualified immunity, even if an official has violated an\n\ninmate’s constitutional right, he is still entitled to immunity if the right was not so\n\n“clearly established” that “a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing\n\nviolates that right.” Hope v. Pelzer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121169\"><a href=\"/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 739 (2002) (citing Anderson v.\n\n                                              11\n\fCreighton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 640 (1987)).

The district court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of all five defendants after finding that Mr. Thompson’s right was not\n\nclearly established. Because we find that Mr. Thompson has shown facts making out a\n\nviolation of a clearly established right, we now reverse summary judgment and remand as\n\nto Officers Cooper and Diming.        However, because Mr. Thompson has not shown\n\nsufficient facts for supervisory liability, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in\n\nfavor of Lt. Thompson, Jennings, and Dolan.\n\n                                             1.\n\n       We first address whether Officer Cooper, the driver of the van, is entitled to\n\nqualified immunity under the two-step framework. We conclude (1) that Mr. Thompson\n\nhas presented sufficient facts for a reasonable jury to find that Cooper used excessive\n\nforce in violation of the Eighth Amendment and (2) that Mr. Thompson’s right not to be\n\nsubjected to such force was clearly established by April 8, 2010, the date of the incident.\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\f                                             a.\n\n       Although the district court seemed to assume without expressly deciding that\n\ndeliberate indifference was the correct standard to apply to Cooper’s alleged Eighth\n\nAmendment violation, McMillian requires application of the excessive force standard in\n\nthis case. See 503 U.S. at 6–7. McMillian held that the excessive force standard applied\n\nto an officer who punched an inmate during transport for no apparent reason. See id. at 4,\n\n6–7. Mr. Thompson essentially claims that Cooper applied force against him without any\n\nlegitimate purpose, albeit using the transport van’s momentum rather than a punch.\n\nThose facts do not materially distinguish McMillian. See id. Accordingly, we must\n\ndetermine whether, viewing the evidence in light most favorable to Mr. Thompson,\n\nOfficer Cooper used force “maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.” Id.\n\n       We evaluate whether Cooper acted maliciously or “wantonly” by applying a non-\n\nexclusive, four-factor balancing test:\n\n      (1) the need for the application of force;\n      (2) the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used;\n      (3) the extent of any reasonably perceived threat that the application of\n          force was intended to quell; and\n      (4) any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response.\n\nIko v. Shreve, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1026358\"><a href=\"/opinion/1026358/iko-v-shreve/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 239 (4th Cir. 2008) (citing Whitley, 475 U.S. at 321). In Iko\n\nwe applied these factors to hold that a prison official used excessive force in violation of\n\nthe Eighth Amendment by applying pepper spray while removing an inmate from his cell\n\nbecause the official continued to spray even after the inmate attempted to comply. 535\n\nF.3d at 239–40, 243. As discussed below, at least three of the four factors require a\n\nsimilar conclusion here.\n\n                                            14\n\f       First, Officer Cooper never needed to use force on Mr. Thompson during the\n\ntransport. Unlike Iko, who initially refused to leave his cell as ordered, Mr. Thompson\n\ndid not disobey any instruction. In fact, the parties do not dispute that Mr. Thompson\n\nfully complied with all instructions at all times leading up to the alleged use of force. See\n\nid. at 231, 239–40. Moreover, there is no indication in the record that any use of force\n\nagainst Mr. Thompson during transport was justified. Accordingly, a reasonable jury\n\ncould credit Mr. Thompson’s affidavit and find that Officers Cooper and Diming’s intent\n\nwas malicious—to teach him a lesson for filing grievances. Such a motive, unsupported\n\nby any penological interest, is clearly not a legitimate basis for using force.\n\n       Second, because there was no need to use force, the force used was necessarily\n\nexcessive in relation to the need. In Iko, we held that the official’s use of force became\n\ndisproportionate once the prisoner began showing signs of compliance. 535 F.3d at 239–\n\n40. Here, since there was never a need, the use of force was disproportionate from start\n\nto finish. Moreover, even if Mr. Thompson disobeyed instructions, giving a prisoner a\n\nso-called “rough ride” in a van does not constitute an acceptable means of securing\n\ncompliance. Cf. id. at 239 (noting that officers are trained to use pepper spray and that\n\npepper spray is allowed for purposes of removing inmates under department’s Use of\n\nForce Directive). To use force in this manner is a peculiarly cruel means of punishment,\n\nas a “rough ride” is designed to place the victim in fear for his life. Not only is the\n\nprisoner not able to protect himself, but motor vehicles, unlike a controlled spray or direct\n\napplications of force, are not designed for use as a means of securing compliance or\n\notherwise subduing a prisoner. The momentum from the van is not susceptible to precise\n\n                                              15\n\fcalibration such that only the amount of force justified by the circumstances is actually\n\ndeployed.    The prospect that neither the victim nor the officer can prevent an\n\ninstantaneous escalation to a life-or-death situation instills terror.         A “rough ride”\n\ntherefore bears no relationship to any penological need to use force, and even standing\n\nalone, its sheer cruelty and impropriety suggest a constitutional violation.\n\n       Third, Officers Cooper and Diming do not even assert that Mr. Thompson posed a\n\nthreat to anyone. In Iko, the prisoner posed a minimal threat—he had even lain down on\n\nthe ground before the officer sprayed him the final time. Id. Here, the officers do not,\n\nand cannot, argue that Mr. Thompson presented any kind of physical threat, as he was\n\nfully restrained with shackles, handcuffs, and a black box. Moreover, he never verbally\n\nthreatened the officers with violence and was never hostile in any way. Mr. Thompson’s\n\nonly threat, the officers concede, was the threat of future litigation.\n\n       Finally, the fourth factor, concerning efforts to temper the use of force, is a draw at\n\nbest. In contrast to Iko, where prison officials failed to provide any medical attention\n\nafter applying the pepper spray, Cooper and Diming did secure medical assistance upon\n\ntheir return to DMCC. But, they never secured Mr. Thompson’s seatbelt, even after he\n\nwas injured, and they fueled Mr. Thompson’s fear for his safety by taunting and\n\nthreatening him. Even assuming this factor weighs in the government’s favor, it alone\n\ncannot preclude the conclusion that Mr. Thompson has alleged a constitutional violation.\n\nTo hold otherwise would allow prison officials to escape liability in excessive force cases\n\nsimply by rendering medical assistance after the fact.\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\f      The extent of Mr. Thompson’s injury is not one of the relevant factors and does\n\nnot, contrary to the government’s suggestion, preclude a violation of the Eighth\n\nAmendment. Of course, the Eighth Amendment does not prohibit a de minimis use of\n\nforce that is not itself “repugnant to the conscience of mankind.” McMillian, 503 U.S. at\n\n9–10 (citing Whitley, 475 U.S. at 327). But when use of force is malicious or repugnant,\n\na plaintiff need not suffer anything significant to establish an excessive force claim.\n\nThus, in McMillian, the Supreme Court reversed the Fifth Circuit for rejecting an\n\nexcessive force claim solely because the inmate had not suffered a “significant injury.”\n\n503 U.S. at 4–5. The Court explained:\n\n      When prison officials maliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm,\n      contemporary standards of decency always are violated. This is true\n      whether or not significant injury is evident. Otherwise, the Eighth\n      Amendment would permit any physical punishment, no matter how diabolic\n      or inhuman, inflicting less than some arbitrary quantity of injury. Such a\n      result would have been as unacceptable to the drafters of the Eighth\n      Amendment as it is today.\n\nId. at 9–10 (citing Whitley, 475 U.S. at 327; Estelle, 429 U.S. at 102) (emphasis added).\n\nThe excessive force analysis thus focuses on the maliciousness of the force used, not the\n\nseverity of the injury that results from that force. Wilkins v. Gaddy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1738\"><a href=\"/opinion/1738/wilkins-v-gaddy/\"><span class=\"volume\">559</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 38\n\n(2010) (“An inmate who is gratuitously beaten by guards does not lose his ability to\n\npursue an excessive force claim merely because he has the good fortune to escape\n\nwithout serious injury.”). Here, the momentum from the van was sufficient to cause a\n\ngash on Mr. Thompson’s forehead, bleeding from his hands and arms and bruising, not to\n\nmention significant emotional distress. The force alleged is therefore beyond de minimis\n\nfor Eighth Amendment purposes. See id. at 9 (force not de minimis when sufficient to\n\n                                           17\n\fcause bruising, swelling, loosened teeth); see also Wilkins, 559 U.S. at 35, 40 (force\n\nsufficient to cause bruising, lower back pain, migraines, dizziness, and mental anguish\n\nnot de minimis).\n\n       The cases cited by the government and the district court do not support a contrary\n\nholding. For example, Jabbar v. Fischer merely held that failure to provide inmates with\n\nseatbelts, “standing alone,” is not an Eighth Amendment violation.

Defined at the appropriate level of specificity, prisoners\n\nhave a right not to be assaulted by their captors. Under the Eighth Amendment, prisoners\n\nhave the right to be free from malicious or penologically unjustified infliction of pain and\n\nsuffering. Rhodes v. Chapman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110518\"><a href=\"/opinion/110518/rhodes-v-chapman/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 346 (1981) (“Among ‘unnecessary and\n\nwanton’ inflictions of pain are those that are ‘totally without penological justification.’”)\n\n(citing Gregg v.

This\n\nprinciple applies with particular force when inmates have not engaged in wrongdoing, are\n\nrestrained and compliant and posing no physical threat. Further, no reasonable officer\n\nwould think that violently tossing a prisoner around in a moving vehicle is an acceptable\n\nmeans of punishment even if the prisoner had engaged in wrongdoing. After examining\n\nboth controlling and persuasive authority, we conclude that Officer Cooper had fair\n\nwarning that gratuitously giving an inmate a “rough ride” for no reason other than to\n\nretaliate against him for filing lawsuits and grievances is unconstitutional.\n\n       A reasonable officer would have known from Supreme Court precedent that the\n\nEighth Amendment prohibits such malicious acts of violence or intentional\n\nendangerment. In McMillian, one of the seminal cases defining the scope of the right not\n\n                                             19\n\fto be subjected to excessive force, the Supreme Court reversed the dismissal of an Eighth\n\nAmendment claim based on a correctional officer’s gratuitous punch of an inmate during\n\ntransport. See 503 U.S. at 4, 12. In Wilkins, a prison official, angered by the prisoner’s\n\nrequest for a grievance form, slammed the prisoner against the ground and physically\n\nbeat him in response. 559 U.S. at 35, 37 (citing and reaffirming McMillian, 503 U.S. at\n\n9). The Supreme Court reversed the district court’s dismissal of the case for failure to\n\nstate a claim and held that the prisoner would prevail if he proved that the official had in\n\nfact acted maliciously. See id. at 40. As in Wilkins, if we credit Mr. Thompson’s\n\naccount, the only reason Cooper used force against him was in retaliation for filing\n\ngrievances. Accordingly, Wilkins and McMillian are sufficiently similar to Cooper’s\n\nalleged conduct that a reasonable officer would have known that a retaliatory “rough\n\nride” is unconstitutional.\n\n       To be sure, McMillian and Wilkins involved direct punches and kicks, rather than a\n\n“rough ride,” but it makes no difference to the constitutional analysis whether Mr.\n\nThompson was slammed against the side of the van by the officer’s hands or by the\n\nmomentum maliciously created by the officer’s driving. See Brown v. Fortner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1404492\"><a href=\"/opinion/1404492/brown-v-fortner/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560–62 (8th Cir. 2008) (holding that prisoner’s right not to be endangered by\n\ndangerous driving while unbuckled was clearly established despite lack of published\n\nauthority on those specific facts). The intentionally erratic driving was simply a different\n\nmeans of effectuating the same constitutional violation. To draw a line between these\n\nacts would encourage bad actors to invent creative and novel means of using unjustified\n\nforce on prisoners.     Although McMillian and Wilkins did not reach the qualified\n\n                                            20\n\fimmunity question, their holdings provide officers with fair notice that malicious,\n\nunprovoked, unjustified force inflicted on inmates who are compliant and restrained, and\n\nviolates the Eighth Amendment.       In other words, the Eighth Amendment principle\n\nprohibiting such gratuitous violence applies with “obvious clarity” to a malicious “rough\n\nride,” just as it does to a malicious direct blow. See Hope, 536 U.S. at 741.\n\n      Indeed, two Eighth Circuit cases have held that malicious “rough rides” violate the\n\nEighth Amendment. See Fortner, 518 F.3d at 560–62; Brown v. Morgan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n*1 (8th Cir. 1994) (unpublished).         Although these cases applied the deliberate\n\nindifference standard, they provided notice to Cooper, because deliberate indifference has\n\na lower intent requirement, and, as discussed infra, the injuries here suffice for a\n\ndeliberate indifference claim.     Fortner and Morgan both involved officers who\n\nknowingly refused to fasten a prisoner’s seatbelt, drove recklessly, and refused the\n\nprisoner’s pleas to slow down. See Fortner, 518 F.3d at 556, 560–62 (denying qualified\n\nimmunity); Morgan, 39 F.3d at *1 (finding deliberate indifference). In Fortner, the\n\nprisoner, like Mr. Thompson, was fully shackled with chains, handcuffs, and a black box\n\nsuch that he could not secure his own seatbelt or brace himself if necessary. Id. The\n\ndriver ignored the prisoner’s pleas to stop speeding and eventually caused a car accident.\n\nId. Here, Cooper apparently speeded around curves and crossed white and yellow traffic\n\nlines, generating enough force to bruise and injure Mr. Thompson. 4 Mr. Thompson not\n\n\n\n       4\n        Appellees argue that Mr. Thompson’s allegations of reckless driving are too\nconclusory to be considered. Appellees’ Br. at 28. However, they are virtually identical\n\n                                            21\n\fonly asked Cooper to slow down, as Brown did in Fortner, but also indicated that he had\n\nalready been injured. Similarly, in Morgan, the driver took pleasure in the prisoner’s fear\n\nand asked, “Are you scared?” before increasing his speed. 39 F.3d at *1. In Mr.\n\nThompson’s case, Cooper laughed at him and taunted him for being scared, before stating\n\nhis intent to teach him a lesson. Cooper’s conduct therefore went even further than what\n\nwas considered unacceptable in Fortner and Morgan, as Cooper not only disregarded a\n\nserious risk of harm, but apparently intended such harm to result. See Whitley, 475 U.S.\n\nat 320 (suggesting that malicious intent is more culpable than mere indifference by\n\nlimiting liability to intentional misconduct).    Given the factual parallels, the Eighth\n\nCircuit cases are powerful indicators that the officers here had fair notice. Cf. Pauly, 137\n\nS. Ct. at 552 (reversing denial of qualified immunity because court failed to identify case\n\nwith similar circumstances and no general principle applies with obvious clarity).\n\n      Although few circuits have addressed specifically an officer’s use of a vehicle to\n\ninjure an inmate, there is a clear consensus among the circuits, including the Fourth, that\n\ninfliction of pain and suffering without penological justification violates the Eighth\n\nAmendment in an array of contexts. Simply put, there are many ways of physically and\n\nmaliciously assaulting a helpless prisoner, and all of them violate the Eighth Amendment.\n\n\n\n\nto the statements credited by the Eighth Circuit in Fortner, and we conclude that they are\nsufficiently specific here. See 518 F.3d at 559.\n\n                                            22\n\f      The First Circuit denied summary judgment as to an excessive force claim against\n\nofficers who beat a detainee for requesting permission to finish his meal.

That unifying thread provides fair notice\n\nto prison officials that they cannot, no matter their creativity, maliciously harm a prisoner\n\non a whim or for reasons unrelated to the government’s interest in maintaining order.\n\nThat principle applies with particular clarity to cases such as this one, where the victim is\n\nrestrained, compliant, and incapable of resisting or protecting himself, and otherwise\n\npresents no physical threat in any way.\n\n\n                                             26\n\f      The government argues, unpersuasively, that the law is not clearly established\n\nbecause courts have not found a constitutional violation in some failure-to-fasten-seatbelt\n\ncases, notwithstanding the Eighth Circuit precedent. However, with one exception, every\n\nother seatbelt case cited by the district court and the government involved mere\n\nnegligence, rather than malice or even recklessness. See, e.g., Jabbar, 683 F.3d at 57;\n\nSpencer, 183 F.3d at 907-08; Crain, 327 F. App’x at 493; Smith, 252 F. App’x at 304;\n\nDexter, 92 F. App’x at 640–41.

However, Young\n\ntook place before Fortner was published, and the district court erred by relying purely on\n\nnegligence cases without recognizing the heightened risk of reckless or malicious\n\nendangerment. See id. at 5–6. Moreover, even Young distinguished its facts from a case\n\nwhere the driver drives with the intent to scare an inmate or refuses pleas to slow down.\n\nId. Instead, all cases that have squarely dealt with intentional misconduct have found an\n\nEighth Amendment violation.\n\n      The government also argues, unpersuasively, that an official’s wrongful intent is\n\nnever relevant to the qualified immunity analysis, even in the context of an Eighth\n\nAmendment deliberate indifference or excessive force claim. See Appellees’ Br. at 31.\n\nThe government cites Crawford-El v. Britton for the sweeping proposition that, under\n\nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982), “[e]vidence concerning the defendant’s\n\nsubjective intent is simply irrelevant.” Crawford-El v. Britton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118203\"><a href=\"/opinion/118203/crawford-el-v-britton/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 589 (1998).\n\nCrawford-El’s holding is much more limited and is not itself a decision on qualified\n\nimmunity. See 523 U.S. at 589 (holding that plaintiff may pursue ordinary discovery into\n\n                                            27\n\fofficial’s intent for claims having intent element notwithstanding irrelevance of intent to\n\nqualified immunity defense). Read in context, the Court was merely referring to and\n\nreiterating Harlow’s holding that “‘bare allegations of malice’ cannot overcome the\n\nqualified immunity defense.” Id. (quoting Harlow, 457 U.S. at 817–18).\n\n       Crawford-El and Harlow do not forbid us from considering evidence of intent in\n\nMr. Thompson’s excessive force claim. Harlow did not involve an Eighth Amendment\n\nexcessive force claim or a deliberate indifference claim. See 457 U.S. at 817–18 (suit\n\nagainst presidential aides for recommending plaintiff’s firing in bad faith). As Crawford-\n\nEl itself recognized, the significance of evidence of intent differs when it “is an essential\n\ncomponent of the plaintiff’s affirmative case.” See 523 U.S. at 588–90.\n\n       For claims where intent is an element, an official’s state of mind is a reference\n\npoint by which she can reasonably assess conformity to the law because the case law is\n\nintent-specific.   Considering evidence of intent in this manner is not foreclosed by\n\nCrawford-El, as the Supreme Court itself has applied the clearly established prong in\n\nreference to retaliatory intent. See Ortiz v. Jordan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"183479\"><a href=\"/opinion/183479/ortiz-v-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 189–91 (2011) (holding\n\nthat law was clearly established that prison guard cannot retaliate against inmate by\n\nputting her in solitary confinement) (citing Crawford-El, 523 U.S. at 592).\n\n       Thus, in light of the Supreme Court precedent in McMillian and Wilkins, case law\n\non “rough rides” from our sister circuit, and the overwhelming consensus on the\n\nprisoner’s right to be free from assault, i.e., malicious infliction of pain and suffering, we\n\nconclude that Officer Cooper had fair warning that his actions were unconstitutional and\n\nthat Mr. Thompson’s right was therefore clearly established. Accordingly, we reverse the\n\n                                             28\n\fdistrict court’s determination that Officer Cooper is entitled to qualified immunity on the\n\nEighth Amendment excessive force claim.\n\n                                             2.\n\n       As to Officer Diming, we agree with the district court that Mr. Thompson has\n\n“presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact” as to deliberate\n\nindifference but disagree that his right to reasonable protection from assault was not\n\nclearly established as of April 8, 2010. See Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">13065640</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8.\n\n                                             a.\n\n       Given the differences in the roles that Officer Cooper and Officer Diming played\n\nduring the van ride, we hold that deliberate indifference is the correct standard to apply to\n\nOfficer Diming. Mr. Thompson’s affidavits show that Diming refused to buckle his\n\nseatbelt, ignored his pleas for help, failed to intervene to stop Cooper’s unlawful use of\n\nforce, and instead verbally taunted and harassed him. Unlike Cooper, who drove the van,\n\nDiming did not use unlawful force against Mr. Thompson—rather, he failed to do\n\nanything to stop it. Accordingly, the claim against Diming is functionally the same as\n\nclaims in failure-to-protect or conditions-of-confinement cases, which are evaluated\n\nunder the deliberate indifference standard. 5 See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834; Wilson, 501\n\n\n       5\n         Applying the deliberate indifference standard would also create symmetry with\nthe test used to establish bystander liability, which is similar in principle to what Mr.\nThompson alleges against Diming.

Prince George’s Cty., Md., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778997\"><a href=\"/opinion/778997/david-randall-tamara-marshall-in-her-individual-capacity-and-in-her/\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 204 (4th Cir. 2002) (“[A]n officer may be liable under § 1983, on a theory of\nbystander liability, if he: (1) knows that a fellow officer is violating an individual’s\nconstitutional rights; (2) has a reasonable opportunity to prevent the harm; and (3)\nchooses not to act.”).\n\n                                             29\n\fU.S. at 303. To survive summary judgment, Mr. Thompson must show facts sufficient\n\nfor a reasonable factfinder to conclude that (1) he was exposed to a “substantial risk of\n\nserious harm” and (2) Diming “kn[ew] of and disregard[ed]” that risk. Farmer, 511 U.S.\n\nat 834, 837–38.\n\n       First, there are sufficient facts for a reasonable jury to conclude that Mr.\n\nThompson was exposed to a “substantial risk of serious harm.” An inmate need not show\n\nthat she in fact suffered serious harm to prevail on this prong because “the Eighth\n\nAmendment protects against future harm.” Helling v. McKinney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112888\"><a href=\"/opinion/112888/helling-v-mckinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33–34\n\n(1993). Courts have “plainly recognized that a remedy for unsafe conditions need not\n\nawait a tragic event.” Id. Viewing the facts in light most favorable to Mr. Thompson,\n\nthere was a substantial risk that he would suffer serious harm: he was fully shackled,\n\nunable to brace himself for impact, and sitting without a seatbelt, in a vehicle that was\n\nspeeding and being driven in a way intended to scare and injure him, by a driver who\n\nrefused both his requests to be seatbelted and to slow down. See Fortner, 518 F.3d at\n\n559–60; Morgan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1. In this case, the risk to Mr. Thompson was even\n\ngreater than the risk involved in Fortner and Morgan, as neither of the drivers in those\n\ncases specifically intended to cause injury.\n\n      In arguing to the contrary, the government points to Vinson, an unpublished case\n\nfrom the District of South Carolina that involved an unfastened seatbelt and negligent\n\ndriving. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3903199</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (finding no substantial risk of harm). But the court in\n\nVinson distinguished its facts from those of Fortner, where the Eighth Circuit found an\n\nEighth Amendment violation, because the Vinson plaintiff had not alleged reckless\n\n                                               30\n\fdriving with specificity, such as by citing speeding and driving over boundary lines.

In Odom, this court held that prison\n\nofficials violated the Eighth Amendment for failing to take any steps to protect an inmate\n\nfrom a known attack. 349 F.3d at 767. There, the court found that the prison officer was\n\naware of the risk that the inmate, Odom, would be attacked because Odom (1) had\n\nwarned the officer, (2) had pleaded for help as the attack was happening, and (3) was\n\nexperiencing the attack in the officer’s presence. Id. Here, Mr. Thompson informed\n\nDiming that his seatbelt was unfastened, but Diming ignored the request to buckle it,\n\ncontrary to his normal practice. In addition, Mr. Thompson informed Diming of his\n\nconcerns for his safety when Cooper began driving erratically, and Cooper’s erratic\n\n                                              32\n\fdriving of course took place in Diming’s presence. Diming was also demonstrably aware\n\nof Mr. Thompson’s concerns for his safety, as he apparently mocked him for being\n\nscared. While it is unclear whether Diming, Cooper, or both indicated to Mr. Thompson\n\nthat the “rough ride” was intended to teach him a lesson, one could infer that Diming, at\n\nminimum, heard that threat.     Diming was also aware that Mr. Thompson had been\n\ninjured, having called the prison to report that Mr. Thompson had banged his head.\n\nThese facts lead to the inescapable conclusion that Diming was aware of the risk to Mr.\n\nThompson created by Cooper.\n\n      We also conclude that a reasonable jury could find that Diming disregarded a\n\nknown risk of harm by failing to take any reasonable steps to prevent Mr. Thompson\n\nfrom being hurt. In Odom, the officer rejected the inmate’s pleas to be let out of the cell\n\nwhere he was being attacked. Id. at 767–68. Indeed, he took no action until after the\n\nvictim had suffered broken ribs. Id. In this case, Diming exhibited a similar pattern of\n\ndisregard in the face of escalating risks to Mr. Thompson’s safety. Diming initially\n\ndismissed Mr. Thompson’s request for a seatbelt. He then dismissed Mr. Thompson’s\n\nfear of injury and taunted him. Even after Mr. Thompson was visibly injured and began\n\nbleeding, Diming took no action, whether to ask Cooper to slow down or to finally secure\n\nMr. Thompson’s seatbelt. Moreover, there was nothing that prevented Diming from\n\nreasonably taking at least some steps to protect Mr. Thompson. A reasonable factfinder\n\ncould therefore conclude that Diming was aware of a risk to Mr. Thompson’s safety,\n\ncertainly by the time Mr. Thompson was injured, if not earlier, and that Diming\n\nconsciously disregarded that risk by failing to intervene. See Raynor, 817 F.3d at 128.\n\n                                            33\n\f      In sum, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Thompson, he has\n\nalleged sufficient facts to satisfy both prongs of the deliberate indifference test. He\n\nadequately asserts that he was exposed to the substantial risk of harm of being physically\n\ntossed about in an erratic vehicle and that Diming was aware of that risk and disregarded\n\nit by failing to take any preventative measures.\n\n                                             b.\n\n      The only remaining question is whether Mr. Thompson’s right to reasonable\n\nprotection from a known threat was clearly established as of April 8, 2010, the date of the\n\nincident. As before, we first look to controlling authority in the relevant jurisdiction,\n\nspecifically cases from the Supreme Court, this Court of Appeals, or the highest court of\n\nthe state in which the action arose. Owens, 372 F.3d at 279. We conclude that Mr.\n\nThompson’s right was clearly established.\n\n      Odom held that, by June 2000, it was clearly established in the Fourth Circuit that\n\n“a correctional officer who stands by as a passive observer and takes no action\n\nwhatsoever to intervene during an assault violates the rights of the victim inmate.” 349\n\nF.3d at 773 (denying qualified immunity). Reasonable officials would understand Odom\n\nto mean that inmates have an Eighth Amendment right to be protected from malicious\n\nattacks, not just by other inmates, but also from the very officials tasked with ensuring\n\ntheir security. See Hope, 536 U.S. at 739 (“[C]ontours [of the right] must be sufficiently\n\nclear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that\n\nright.”). Similarly, the Supreme Court has held that the law was “not in controversy,”\n\neven in 1996, that a prison official could be liable for failing to protect a female inmate\n\n                                            34\n\ffrom subsequent sexual assault if he were aware of a prior incident. See Ortiz, 562 U.S.\n\nat 189. That understanding is consistent with and buttressed by the related doctrine of\n\nbystander liability, which imposes on officers “an affirmative duty to intervene to protect\n\nthe constitutional rights of citizens from infringement by other law enforcement officers.”\n\nRandall, 302 F.3d at 203 (2002 decision concerning actions in 2000); see also Skrtich,\n\n280 F.3d at 1301 (“[A]n officer who is present at the scene and who fails to take\n\nreasonable steps to protect the victim of another officer’s use of excessive force can be\n\nheld personally liable for his nonfeasance.”) (applying bystander liability to corrections\n\nofficer); Hovater, 1 F.3d at 1068 (recognizing inmate’s right to be protected from known\n\nrisk of sexual assault by prison guard).\n\n      Because controlling authority clearly establishes an inmate’s right to reasonable\n\nprotection from malicious assault, we look no further and conclude that Mr. Thompson’s\n\nright was clearly established in this case. Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s\n\ngrant of qualified immunity to Officer Diming.\n\n                                            3.\n\n       Mr. Thompson’s Eighth Amendment claim also attempts to reach Lt. Thompson,\n\nAssistant Warden Jennings, and Captain Dolan. However, Mr. Thompson’s appellate\n\nbrief and argument do not address their liability, nor are there any facts that show how\n\nany of the three officials were aware of any risk to Mr. Thompson or how any of their\n\nactions contributed to his injuries. Accordingly, we summarily affirm the district court’s\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of these three defendants.\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\f                                            IV.\n\n       We now turn to Claim One, which is Mr. Thompson’s First Amendment\n\nretaliation claim. He alleges that Defendants Baskerville, Jennings, Ware, Lewis, Dolan,\n\nLt. Thompson, Seay, Blackwell, White, Cooper and Diming violated his First\n\nAmendment rights by retaliating against him before, during, and after the April 8, 2010\n\nincident.\n\n       We summarily affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of\n\nBaskerville, Jennings, Ware, Lewis, Dolan, Lt. Thompson, Seay, Blackwell, and White\n\nbecause Mr. Thompson has failed to show any facts that could support an inference that\n\nthe above officials were aware of his past litigation and grievances or that they acted with\n\nretaliatory intent.\n\n       However, we reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment as to Cooper\n\nand Diming because the record supports an inference that they were acting in response to\n\nMr. Thompson being a frequent filer of grievances and litigation. In deciding to grant\n\nsummary judgment, the district court relied in part on Adams v. Rice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"682456\"><a href=\"/opinion/682456/david-adams-v-nathan-a-rice-gary-t-dixon-hazel-w-keith/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir.\n\n1994). However, since the issuance of the district court’s decision, this Court clarified\n\nthe scope of Adams in Booker. See 855 F.3d at 541–42. On remand, the district court\n\nshould proceed in light of this intervening authority.\n\n\n\n                                             V.\n\n       We now turn to Claim Three, which is Mr. Thompson’s due process claim against\n\nJennings, Dolan, Lt. Thompson, Cooper, Diming, Lewis, Seay and Blackwell. He alleges\n\n                                             36\n\fthat the defendants conspired to cover up the transport incident and provided a sham\n\ndisciplinary hearing that was the basis for his being held in segregation.\n\n       We summarily affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment as to all\n\ndefendants because administrative segregation from the general population does not\n\nimplicate a protected liberty interest absent a showing of specific facts that conditions of\n\nconfinement are significantly more onerous. Incumaa v. Stirling, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">791</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 531 (4th\n\nCir. 2015). Mr. Thompson’s affidavits do not present specific facts demonstrating such\n\nhardship. To the extent that Mr. Thompson alleges that segregation was retaliatory\n\npunishment, that argument is better addressed under either the First or Eighth\n\nAmendment.\n\n\n\n                                            VI.\n\n       We now turn to Claim Four, Mr. Thompson’s supervisory liability claim against\n\nBaskerville, Jennings, Ware, Lewis, Dolan and White.            The district court granted\n\nsummary judgment as to all defendants. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">13065640</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *10.\n\n       We summarily affirm because Mr. Thompson only makes conclusory allegations\n\nwithout any specific facts that these defendants had knowledge that retaliation was taking\n\nplace and that they acquiesced in the retaliatory acts. See Randall, 302 F.3d at 206.\n\n\n\n                                            VII.\n\n       We now turn to Claims Five, Six, and Seven, which are Mr. Thompson’s state law\n\nclaims. All three claims are in federal court on the basis of supplemental jurisdiction.\n\n                                             37\n\fThompson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">13065640</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *10.                 The district court declined to exercise\n\njurisdiction and dismissed all three claims because the federal claims, which served as the\n\nanchor for the state-law claims, had already been dismissed. Id.\n\n       Since we reverse summary judgment as to some of the anchoring federal claims,\n\nwe now reverse the district court’s decision to dismiss the state law claims and remand\n\nfor further proceedings.\n\n\n\n                                            VIII.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we reverse summary judgment as to Officers Cooper\n\nand Diming on the Eighth Amendment and First Amendment claims; we reverse the\n\ndistrict court’s dismissal of the state law claims; we affirm the grant of summary\n\njudgment as to all other claims and as to all other defendants; and we remand for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                             AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART,\n                                               AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS\n\n\n\n\n                                             38\n\f</pre>",
