BACKGROUND</span></b><span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Anne Miriam McCloskey began divorce\r\nproceedings against Chris McCloskey in late 1998.<span>  </span>Chris counter-petitioned for divorce.<span>  </span>A jury heard the issues relating to\r\nconservator-ship and primary residence of their two children.<span>  </span>The trial court heard the remaining issues\r\nrelating to the children, including child support, rights and powers of a\r\nparent, and visitation, as well as the characterization and division of property\r\nand attorney</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s\r\nfees.<span>  </span>Although Chris was represented by\r\ncounsel at the jury trial, he discharged his counsel and represented himself\r\npro se at the bench trial.<span>  </span>The trial\r\ncourt signed a divorce decree on September 21, 2000.<span>  </span>Chris filed a notice of appeal from that judgment.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>After the entry of the original decree of\r\ndivorce, the trial court issued several orders, including a turnover order and\r\nQualified Domestic Relations Orders.<span>  </span>The\r\noriginal decree of divorce was also modified several times, and a corrected\r\nfinal judgment was signed on January 12, 2001.<span> \r\n</span>Chris filed an amended notice of appeal in response to the subsequent\r\njudgments.<span>  </span>The trial court filed\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, and later filed amended and additional\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law at Chris</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s\r\nrequest.<span>  </span>The trial court also entered an\r\norder assessing sanctions in the amount of $5,000.00 against Chris and an\r\nattorney he retained after he discharged his earlier counsel.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>DISCUSSION</span></b><span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>On appeal, Chris does not contest the\r\ntrial court</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s\r\nrulings relating to the children; he challenges only the trial court</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s conduct of the bench\r\ntrial and an ancillary sanctions hearing.<span> \r\n</span>Chris raises twelve issues that may be grouped in the following\r\ncategories: (1) the exclusion of evidence; (2) the limitation on trial time;\r\n(3) the assessment of sanctions; (4) the award of attorney</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s fees to Anne; and (5)\r\nthe issuance of orders after the filing of an appeal.<span>  </span>We will address each in turn.<span>  </span>The parties are familiar with the facts, so\r\nwe will discuss only those necessary for our analysis.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span>I.<span>          </span>The Exclusion\r\nof Evidence</span></b><span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>In issues one through four, Chris\r\ncomplains about the exclusion of certain account records and tracing charts\r\nfrom the bench trial of the property issues.<span> \r\n</span>Specifically, he claims that the trial court committed the following\r\nerrors: (1) it placed the burden on him to prove that he timely produced the\r\ndocuments when Anne</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s\r\ncounsel objected to their admission on the grounds that they were not timely\r\nproduced; (2) alternatively, it found the documents were not timely produced\r\nwhen the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to show that Chris\r\nviolated any discovery rules or alleged Rule 11 agreements; (3) it excluded the\r\ndocuments even though (i) Anne</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s\r\ncounsel did not come forward with evidence to support their assertions of\r\nuntimeliness, (ii) Anne</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s\r\ncounsel previously admitted their receipt of account records in a motion to\r\nstrike the records as untimely, and (iii) Anne</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s\r\ncounsel had waived such complaints as part of an agreement made in open court;\r\nand (4) to the extent it relied on Anne</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s\r\ncounsel</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s unsworn assertions of\r\nuntimeliness, the trial court erred in precluding Chris from cross-examining\r\ncounsel or requiring counsel to produce documents to substantiate Anne</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s counsel</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s assertions.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Before an appellate court will reverse a\r\njudgment based on exclusion of evidence, the appellant must show that any error\r\nin excluding the evidence caused the rendition of an improper judgment.<span>  </span><i>See</i> <span>Tex.\r\nR. App. P. </span>44.1(a); <i>City of Brownsville v. Alvarado</i>, 897 S.W.2d\r\n750, 753 (Tex. 1995) (holding that error in the exclusion of evidence is not\r\nreversible unless appellant shows error probably caused the rendition of an\r\nimproper judgment).<span>  </span>Here, Chris has\r\nwholly failed to demonstrate reversible error.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Section3\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The general thrust of these issues is\r\nthat, by erroneously placing the burden of proof on Chris to show the documents\r\nwere timely produced, not only was evidence excluded, but also Chris</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s trial presentation was\r\ndisrupted. <span> </span>Because he was forced to\r\nspend an inordinate amount of time on the admissibility of the documents, Chris\r\nargues he was unable to put on relevant and admissible evidence in support of\r\nhis case on property division before the trial court determined his time had\r\nexpired.<span>  </span>Chris also claims evidence was\r\nexcluded because he was erroneously held to a March 7, 2000 discovery cutoff as\r\nprovided in a Rule 11 agreement instead of an agreement made in open court on\r\nMay 10, 2000, in which Chris agreed to waive his right to a jury trial in\r\nexchange for Anne</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s\r\nagreement to waive any complaints about discovery produced through that date. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Section4\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Chris</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s\r\nargument focuses primarily on the trial court</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s\r\nerror in placing the burden on him to overcome Anne</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s representations that\r\ncertain documents were not timely produced.<span> \r\n</span>And, the record appears to show that Anne in fact may have waived her\r\nobjections to any late-filed discovery (at least as of May 10, 2000) in\r\nexchange for Chris</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s\r\nagreement to a bench trial on part of the dispute.<span>  </span>However, we need not reach either of these\r\nissues, because Chris does not identify what evidence he contends the trial\r\ncourt ultimately excluded in error or what it would have shown.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[2]</span></sup></span></span></span></sup></span><span>  </span>Moreover, he does not challenge the trial\r\ncourt</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s findings of fact\r\naddressing the property division.<i><span>  </span>See\r\nLondon v.

counter-petitioned for divorce.<span>  </span>A jury heard the issues relating to\r\nconservator-ship and primary residence of their two children.<span>  </span>The trial court heard the remaining issues\r\nrelating to the children, including child support, rights and powers of a\r\nparent, and visitation, as well as the characterization and division of property\r\nand attorney</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s\r\nfees.<span>  </span>Although Chris was represented by\r\ncounsel at the jury trial, he discharged his counsel and represented himself\r\npro se at the bench trial.<span>  </span>The trial\r\ncourt signed a divorce decree on September 21, 2000.<span>  </span>Chris filed a notice of appeal from that judgment.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>After the entry of the original decree of\r\ndivorce, the trial court issued several orders, including a turnover order and\r\nQualified Domestic Relations Orders.<span>  </span>The\r\noriginal decree of divorce was also modified several times, and a corrected\r\nfinal judgment was signed on January 12, 2001.<span> \r\n</span>Chris filed an amended notice of appeal in response to the subsequent\r\njudgments.<span>  </span>The trial court filed\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, and later filed amended and additional\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law at Chris</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s\r\nrequest.<span>  </span>The trial court also entered an\r\norder assessing sanctions in the amount of $5,000.00 against Chris and an\r\nattorney

court</span><span><span>=</span></span><span>s conduct of the bench\r\ntrial and an ancillary sanctions hearing.<span> \r\n</span>Chris raises twelve issues that may be grouped in the
