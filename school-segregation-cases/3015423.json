The defendants bring this interlocutory appeal asserting that they\nare entitled to such immunity. We reverse.\n             I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       In February 2011, Cornell arrived at a fire station and complained that\nhe was being chased. A fireman called the police, who, upon arrival, handcuffed\nCornell and took him to the Parkland psychiatric emergency room (the “Psych\nER”). Cornell was considered “APOWW, i.e., apprehended by a police officer\nwithout a warrant.” 1 Parkland is a state hospital.\nA.     Treatment at Parkland\n       Defendants–Appellants Dr. Kevin Brown and Nurse Sherwin De\nGuzman were present at Cornell’s intake, during which Dr. Shawn Chambers\ntook Cornell’s medical history. Cornell told Chambers that he had\n“tachycardia.” Cornell stated that “people had stolen his lottery ticket and were\nchasing him.” Cornell was admitted to the Psych ER pursuant to Dr. Brown’s\nauthorization.\n       Johnny Roberts, a technician in the Psych ER (a “psych tech”), took\nCornell’s vital signs, which registered as abnormally high. Cornell’s pulse was\n124 beats per minute, his blood pressure was 142/105 mm Hg, and his\nrespirations were 17 breaths per minute. Because Cornell’s pulse and blood\npressure readings were elevated, Roberts tried to take his vital signs again,\n\n\n\n       1  Texas law allows a police officer to take a person into custody without a warrant if\n“the officer . . . has reason to believe that (A) the person is a person with mental illness; and\n(B) because of that mental illness there is a substantial risk of serious harm to the person or\nto others unless the person is immediately restrained.” Tex. Health & Safety Code §\n573.001(a). The officer must “immediately transport” that person to the nearest appropriate\nmental-health facility. Id. § 573.001(d). The mental-health facility may detain that person\n“in custody for not longer than 48 hours after the time the person is presented to the facility\nunless a written order for protective custody is obtained.” Id. § 573.021(b). Appellees do not\nchallenge the officers’ grounds for bringing Cornell to Parkland.\n                                               2\n\f    Case: 14-11020    Document: 00513282187    Page: 3   Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                No. 14-11020\nbut the machine malfunctioned. Though Cornell had been cooperative up to\nthis point, he became agitated and refused to cooperate when Roberts\nattempted to take his vital signs a third time. Parkland staff provided no\nfurther cardiac treatment to Cornell.\n      Roberts asked Defendant–Appellant Robert Givens, another psych tech,\nfor assistance calming Cornell, but Cornell continued to resist and tried to\nleave the Psych ER. Roberts informed Dr. Brown of Cornell’s behavior. Givens\nput Cornell in either a “basket hold” or “elbow-to-hip containment,” and pushed\nhim into a seclusion room. The techs held Cornell on a mat on the floor. The\ntechs’ testimony conflicts as to whether Cornell was held on his side or his\nstomach.\n      De Guzman arrived and injected Cornell with a mixture of Haldol,\nAtivan, and Benadryl to subdue him. Haldol and Benadryl can cause cardiac\narrhythmia and death. The techs continued to hold Cornell down, though\ntestimony varies as to how long the hold lasted: Givens stated it lasted “a\nminute or two,” Roberts said “several minutes,” and De Guzman said “maybe\nfive minutes.”\n      After Givens and Roberts left the room, Cornell became agitated again.\nHe began yelling, and he ripped up a vinyl tile from the floor and banged it\nagainst the door. A third psych tech, Defendant–Appellant Alexander Achebe,\nconvinced Cornell to trade the tile for a juice box. The techs began to move\nCornell to a new room because he had ripped up the flooring. As they\napproached the second seclusion room, Cornell crushed the juice box and began\nphysically resisting the techs. They again restrained Cornell and put him on a\nmat in the room. Cornell received a second injection of the same medications.\n      Again, there is conflicting testimony about how Cornell was held on the\nmat. Accepting Pena’s version of the facts, Cornell was held on his stomach for\nfifteen minutes after the injection. Psych techs were trained not to hold a\n                                        3\n\f     Case: 14-11020   Document: 00513282187      Page: 4   Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-11020\npatient in a prone position for more than a minute, because longer holds can\ncause asphyxiation. The techs then left the room.\n      A nurse later found Cornell lying in a prone position in the room with his\nright arm beneath him and his hand pointed to the ceiling. His hand was\ncyanotic, and the nurse could not detect spontaneous respirations. The nurse\ncalled a code blue, and Cornell was transferred to the main emergency room,\nwhere he died. The medical examiner found abrasions on the left side of\nCornell’s forehead. After an investigation into Cornell’s death, the medical\nexaminer found the cause of death to be undetermined, listing three potential\ncauses: 1) mechanical compression; 2) underlying cardiac issues; or 3) effects\nof the medication he received in the Psych ER.\nB.    Supervision at Parkland\n      At the time of Cornell’s death, Defendant–Appellant Nancy Schierding\nwas Parkland’s Director of Nursing for Psychiatric Services. Defendant–\nAppellant Nurse Vernell Brown was Unit Manager III for the Psych ER and\nwas responsible for the Psych ER staff, including nurses and techs. At her\ndeposition, Schierding recalled other complaints of improper treatment in the\nPsych ER. A Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Report\nprepared after Cornell’s death noted that De Guzman’s restraint-and-seclusion\ntraining had lapsed at the time of the incident, as Nurse Brown and Schierding\nshould have been aware. At the time, Defendant–Appellant Dr. Ronnie\nAnderson was the CEO of Parkland.\n      In 2008, prior to Cornell’s death, CMS sent a letter to Anderson stating\nthat Parkland “fail[ed] to provide appropriate medical screening examination\nto determine whether an emergency medical condition existed” and that the\n“deficiencies [we]re so serious that they constitute an immediate threat to the\nhealth and safety of any individual that comes to [Parkland] with an\nemergency medical condition.” The CMS Report generated after Cornell’s\n                                       4\n\f     Case: 14-11020   Document: 00513282187     Page: 5    Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-11020\ndeath detailed ongoing problems, noting that, due to an unusually high\nnumber of complaints, injuries, and deaths, Parkland had been “under near\nconstant surveillance and investigation” by the Texas Department of State\nHealth Services and CMS.\nC.    Procedural History\n      Plaintiff–Appellee Onie Pena, as the representative of Cornell’s estate,\nfiled a complaint in Texas district court against Parkland and the Defendants–\nAppellants, among others. Parkland removed the case to federal court.\nRelevant to this appeal, Pena alleges that Givens and Achebe used excessive\nforce against Cornell in violation of the Fourth Amendment or, in the\nalternative, in violation of Cornell’s substantive due process rights. Pena\nalleges that De Guzman and Dr. Brown violated Cornell’s right to due process\nby denying him medical care for his heart condition. Finally, Pena avers that\nSchierding, Anderson, and Nurse Brown (collectively, “the Supervisory\nDefendants”) contributed to these constitutional violations by inadequately\nsupervising the Psych ER.\n      The Appellants moved for summary judgment, arguing that they are\nentitled to qualified immunity. The district court denied their motions, and\nAppellants filed timely notices of interlocutory appeal.\n                             II. JURISDICTION\n      This Court has jurisdiction over the denial of a motion for summary\njudgment based on qualified immunity, but this jurisdiction is severely limited,\n“for it extends to such appeals only to the extent that the denial of summary\njudgment turns on an issue of law.” Kinney v. Weaver, 367 F.3d 337, 347 (5th\nCir. 2004) (en banc) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus,\nthis Court “can review the materiality of any factual disputes, but not their\ngenuineness.” Juarez v. Aguilar, 666 F.3d 325, 331 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting\nKinney, 367 F.3d at 347).\n                                       5\n\f     Case: 14-11020   Document: 00513282187     Page: 6   Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-11020\n                              III. DISCUSSION\nA.    Legal Standard\n      This Court “review[s] the district court’s denial of qualified immunity de\nnovo, accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and viewing them in the light\nmost favorable to the plaintiff.” Cantrell v. City of Murphy, 666 F.3d 911, 918\n(5th Cir. 2012) (quoting Brown v. Miller, 519 F.3d 231, 236 (5th Cir. 2008)).\nBecause we “lack the authority to review the district court’s decision that a\ngenuine factual dispute exists, we do not apply the ordinary summary\njudgment standard.” Hogan v. Cunningham, 722 F.3d 725, 731 (5th Cir. 2013).\nInstead, we consider “only whether the district court erred in assessing the\nlegal significance of the conduct that the district court deemed sufficiently\nsupported for purposes of summary judgment.” Kinney, 367 F.3d at 348. The\nburden to establish the inapplicability of qualified immunity is on Pena. See\nCantrell, 666 F.3d at 918.\n      We apply “a two-step analysis to determine whether a defendant is\nentitled to summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.” Id. at 922.\nFirst, “we determine whether, viewing the summary judgment evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the plaintiff, the defendant violated the plaintiff’s\nconstitutional rights.” Id. (quoting Freeman v. Gore, 483 F.3d 404, 410 (5th Cir.\n2007)). Second, we ask “whether the defendant’s actions were objectively\nunreasonable in light of clearly established law at the time of the conduct in\nquestion.” Id. (quoting Freeman, 483 F.3d at 411). We may exercise our\ndiscretion in deciding which of the two prongs to address first. Id.\n      For a right to be clearly established under the second prong of qualified\nimmunity, “[t]he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a\nreasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.”\nKinney, 367 F.3d at 349–50 (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640\n(1987)). “This requirement establishes a high bar.” Wyatt v. Fletcher, 718 F.3d\n                                       6\n\f     Case: 14-11020   Document: 00513282187      Page: 7   Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-11020\n496, 503 (5th Cir. 2013). To hold that law is clearly established, we must “be\nable to point to ‘controlling authority—or a robust consensus of persuasive\nauthority—that defines the contours of the right in question with a high degree\nof particularity.’” Id. (quoting Morgan v. Swanson, 659 F.3d 359, 371–72 (5th\nCir. 2011) (en banc)); cf. City & Cty. of San Francisco v. Sheehan, 135 S. Ct.\n1765, 1776 (2015) (“Qualified immunity is no immunity at all if ‘clearly\nestablished’ law can simply be defined as the right to be free from unreasonable\nsearches and seizures.”). However, a plaintiff need not show that “the very\naction in question has been previously held unlawful.” Cantrell, 666 F.3d at\n919 (quoting Wernecke v. Garcia, 591 F.3d 386, 393 (5th Cir. 2009)). Rather,\n“the unlawfulness need only be readily apparent from relevant precedent in\nsufficiently similar situations.” Id. (quoting Brown, 519 F.3d at 236–37).\nB.    Givens and Achebe (Excessive Force and Substantive Due\n      Process)\n      Pena claims that Givens and Achebe (collectively “the psych techs”) used\nexcessive force against Cornell in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Pena\nalso maintains that the psych techs violated Cornell’s substantive due process\nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court denied qualified\nimmunity on the Fourth Amendment claim but did not discuss the Fourteenth\nAmendment claim. We address each claim in turn.\n      1. Fourth Amendment Excessive Force\n      To establish a Fourth Amendment excessive-force claim, “a plaintiff\nmust first show that she was seized. Next she must show that she suffered (1)\nan injury that (2) resulted directly and only from the use of force that was\nexcessive to the need and (3) the force used was objectively unreasonable.”\nFlores v. City of Palacios, 381 F.3d 391, 396 (5th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted).\n      The district court held that Cornell’s Fourth Amendment rights were\nclearly established based, explaining that “several courts have found that\n\n                                        7\n\f    Case: 14-11020     Document: 00513282187     Page: 8   Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-11020\n[police officers] restraining a suspect or patient in a prone position can\nconstitute excessive force” and that “the technicians were trained not to use\nthis kind of hold for extended periods of time.” The district court found that the\npsych techs’ “restraint of Cornell was not intended to treat his condition but\nrather to subdue him and prevent him from leaving the hospital.” Quoting the\nSixth Circuit’s decision in McKenna v. Edgell, 617 F.3d 432, 438–39 (6th Cir.\n2010), the district court reasoned: “[E]xposure to liability does not depend\nmerely on the profession of the government actors.”\n      Yet, as noted, before a court can consider whether the forced used was\nexcessive, “a plaintiff must first show that she was seized.” Flores, 381 F.3d at\n396. Qualified immunity thus attaches unless the law is clearly established\nthat the defendant’s conduct amounted to a seizure. See id. at 400\n(determining, before looking to the amount of force used, that “[i]t was clearly\nestablished that stopping a moving car by intentionally shooting it constitutes\na seizure”). Givens and Achebe contend that “it was not clearly established law\nthat medical personnel who restrain patients while rendering aid have ‘seized’\nthe patient for Fourth Amendment purposes.”\n      This Court has held implicitly that a person taken into custody by police\nofficers under Texas Health and Safety Code § 573.001 is seized under the\nFourth Amendment. See Cantrell, 666 F.3d at 923 (holding that Texas police\nofficers who had probable cause to believe the plaintiff that they detained was\na danger to herself were qualifiedly immune). We are, however, unaware of a\ncase extending Fourth Amendment seizure law to mental-health facilities and\nworkers that take custody of these individuals pursuant to Texas Health and\nSafety Code § 573.021, which authorizes a mental-health facility to\ntemporarily hold parties brought into custody pursuant to § 573.001.\n      Moreover, in Peete v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville & Davidson\nCounty, the Sixth Circuit “f[ound] no case authority holding that paramedics\n                                        8\n\f    Case: 14-11020       Document: 00513282187   Page: 9   Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-11020\nanswering a 911 emergency request for help engage in a Fourth Amendment\n‘seizure’ of the person when restraining the person to render aid.” 486 F.3d\n217, 219 (6th Cir. 2007). In that case, paramedics were called to render aid to\nan epileptic man experiencing a seizure. Id. at 219–20. The paramedics\nrestrained the man by “using their bodies to apply weight and pressure to [the\nepileptic’s] head, neck, shoulders, arms, torso, and legs in an attempt to\nprevent the decedent from moving”; they “tied his hands and ankles behind his\nback and continued to apply pressure to [him] while he was in a prone\nposition.” Id. at 220.\n      In its opinion, the Sixth Circuit distinguished Champion v. Outlook\nNashville, Inc., 380 F.3d 893 (6th Cir. 2004), a case on which the district court\nhere heavily relied. See Peete, 486 F.3d at 221–222. Champion involved a\n§ 1983 Fourth Amendment excessive-force claim brought against several police\nofficers. 380 F.3d at 895–96. That case turned on a custodial arrest by the\npolice of a severely autistic man who had become violent with his caretaker.\nId. In that case, the plaintiff, Champion, struggled with the officers during the\ncourse of the arrest. Id. at 896–97. Looking at the facts in the light most\nfavorable to the plaintiff, the court found that the officers remained on top of\nChampion even after he stopped resisting “and sprayed him with pepper spray\neven after he was immobilized by handcuffs and a hobbling device.” Id. at 901.\nChampion, who began vomiting after several minutes of being held down, was\ndead upon arrival at the hospital. Id. at 898. The court held that Champion’s\narrest amounted to a clearly established unreasonable seizure under the\nFourth Amendment. Id. at 901–902.\n      Importantly, in Peete, the Sixth Circuit found that Champion did not\napply to the paramedics’ conduct because the paramedics “were not acting to\nenforce the law, deter, or incarcerate.” 486 F.3d at 222. As the court explained,\n\n\n                                        9\n\f    Case: 14-11020    Document: 00513282187      Page: 10    Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-11020\nthe paramedics “were unlike the police officers in Champion who handcuffed\nand shackled the plaintiff in order to arrest and incapacitate him.” Id.\n      The Sixth Circuit addressed the applicability of Peete to police officers\nrendering medical aid in McKenna v. Edgell, 617 F.3d 432 (6th Cir. 2010).\nOfficers were the first responders to a 911 call requesting assistance for a man\nhaving a seizure; the officers handcuffed the man, though the reasons for the\nrestraint were disputed. Id. at 435–36. The officers argued that they were\nentitled to qualified immunity based on Peete; the plaintiff countered that Peete\nwas inapplicable because Peete concerned paramedics. Id. at 438–39. The Sixth\nCircuit held that whether the Fourth Amendment applied hinged on “whether\nthe [officials] acted in a law-enforcement capacity or in an emergency-medical-\nresponse capacity.” Id. at 439–40.\n      We hold it was not clearly established that psych techs conduct in this\ncase amounted to a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Although whether\nthe Fourth Amendment applies does not turn solely on whether the\ngovernment officials were police officers, see McKenna, 617 F.3d at 438–39, the\nSixth Circuit has held that whether Peete applies should depend on “whether\nthe [officials] acted in a law-enforcement capacity or in an emergency-medical-\nresponse capacity,” id. at 439. Pena cites no binding authority holding that a\nmedical professional’s restraint of an individual in an emergency medical\nsituation constitutes a Fourth Amendment seizure. Champion, relied upon by\nboth the district court and Pena, involved police officers’ use of force after they\nhad already seized an individual. Under McKenna, even police officers’ use of\nrestraint does not implicate the Fourth Amendment if they are acting in an\n“emergency-medical-response capacity,” id. at 439–40.\n      Pena points to no “controlling authority—or a robust consensus of\npersuasive authority,” Wyatt, 718 F.3d at 503 (quoting Morgan, 659 F.3d at\n371–72), suggesting that medical personnel “seize” patients when restraining\n                                        10\n\f    Case: 14-11020       Document: 00513282187          Page: 11     Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-11020\nthem in the course of providing treatment. 2 Therefore, we hold that Pena has\nnot carried her burden, see Cantrell, 666 F.3d at 918, and that Givens and\nAchebe are entitled to qualified immunity on the excessive-force claims.\n       2. Substantive Due Process\n       The district court did not discuss Pena’s Fourteenth Amendment\nsubstantive due process claim in its order denying qualified immunity. 3\nBecause Givens and Achebe argued that they were entitled to qualified\nimmunity on this issue in their motion for summary judgment, we read the\ndistrict court’s order as a denial without explanation. Where the district court\ndenies summary judgment on qualified immunity without explanation, this\nCourt “review[s] the record to determine what conduct the district court\nattributed to [the defendant] in finding that he had violated clearly established\nlaw.” Petta v. Rivera, 143 F.3d 895, 899 (5th Cir. 1998) (per curiam).\n       “This circuit held as early as 1981 that ‘[t]he right to be free of state-\noccasioned damage to a person’s bodily integrity is protected by the fourteenth\namendment guarantee of due process.’” Doe v. Taylor Indep. Sch. Dist., 15 F.3d\n443, 450–51 (5th Cir. 1994) (en banc) (quoting Shillingford v. Holmes, 634 F.2d\n263, 265 (5th Cir. 1981)). 4\n\n\n\n\n       2  The district court found that the psych techs’ “restraint of Cornell was not intended\nto treat his condition but rather to subdue him and prevent him from leaving the hospital.”\nAs Givens and Achebe point out, “the only way to ensure Cornell received treatment was if\nhe stayed in the hospital.” Therefore, although we must accept the court’s finding that the\npsych techs held Cornell down to keep him from leaving the hospital, in the context of\npsychiatric care, that restraint is for treatment purposes.\n        3 This could have been intentional: the district court denied qualified immunity on the\n\nFourth Amendment claim, and a substantive due process claim is unavailable if an excessive-\nforce claim is “‘covered by’ the Fourth Amendment.” Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S.\n833, 843 (1998). If, however, Cornell was not “seized” for Fourth Amendment purposes, then\nPena may raise a substantive due process claim. See id. at 843–44.\n        4 Givens and Achebe concede that “it was clearly established as of the date of the\n\nincident that state officials could not engage in conscience-shocking behavior.” We thus focus\non whether the behavior of Givens and Achebe shocks the conscience.\n                                             11\n\f    Case: 14-11020     Document: 00513282187      Page: 12    Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-11020\n      “[I]n a due process challenge to executive action, the threshold question\nis whether the behavior of the governmental officer is so egregious, so\noutrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.”\nLewis, 523 U.S. at 847 n.8. “[T]he constitutional concept of conscience shocking\nduplicates no traditional category of common-law fault, but rather points\nclearly away from liability, or clearly toward it, only at the ends of the tort\nlaw’s spectrum of culpability.” Id. at 848. The officials’ actions must be “grossly\ndisproportionate to the need for action under the circumstances and . . .\ninspired by malice rather than merely careless or unwise excess of zeal.” Petta,\n143 F.3d at 902.\n      Pena argues that “the use of life-threatening and prohibited restraints\nby Givens and Achebe on Cornell was ‘grossly disproportionate to the need for\naction under the circumstances.’” Pena insists that a reasonable factfinder\ncould infer that Givens and Achebe were inspired by malice because this type\nof restraint violated their training. Pena supports her argument with the Sixth\nCircuit’s unpublished decision in Davis v. Pickell, 562 F. App’x 387 (6th Cir.\n2014).\n      In Davis, the Sixth Circuit affirmed a district court’s denial of officers’\nmotions for summary judgment on qualified immunity. Id. at 387. An arrestee\nwas removed from a holding cell, “taken to a safety cell with his hands behind\nhis back, . . . sprayed with mace[,] and slammed to the ground in the hallway.”\nId. at 389. Assuming that the arrestee “was neither threatening nor resisting\nthe officers,” the court held that “the force they used . . . shocks the conscience.”\nId. at 392.\n      As Givens and Achebe point out, Cornell concededly resisted Parkland\nstaff. Indeed, all of the cases cited by Pena, in both the Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendment contexts, involve the use of force on non-resistant subjects.\nMoreover, Pena gives too much weight to the fact that Givens and Achebe\n                                         12\n\f     Case: 14-11020   Document: 00513282187     Page: 13   Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-11020\nviolated their training by holding Cornell in a prone position for an extended\nperiod of time. The Supreme Court has stated that, even in the context of a\nFourth Amendment excessive-force claim, “if an officer acts contrary to her\ntraining, . . . that does not itself negate qualified immunity where it would\notherwise be warranted.” Sheehan, 135 S. Ct. at 1777. Though Givens and\nAchebe’s behavior is concerning, no reasonable jury could conclude that it was\n“grossly disproportionate to the need for action under the circumstances and\n[was] inspired by malice rather than merely careless or unwise excess of zeal.”\nPetta, 143 F.3d at 902; see also Lewis, 523 U.S. at 848. Thus, we hold that\nGivens and Achebe are entitled to qualified immunity on both the Fourth and\nFourteenth Amendment claims.\nC.     De Guzman and Dr. Brown (Denial of Medical Care)\n       De Guzman and Dr. Brown appeal the district court’s denial of their\nmotion for summary judgment on qualified immunity regarding Pena’s claim\nthat they violated Cornell’s due process rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment by denying him adequate medical care for his heart condition.\n       The Supreme Court has recognized “that the Due Process Clauses\ngenerally confer no affirmative right to governmental aid.” DeShaney v.\nWinnebago Cty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 196 (1989). “The Court [has],\nhowever, recognize[d] an exception where in ‘certain limited circumstances the\nConstitution imposes upon the State affirmative duties of care and protection\nwith respect to particular individuals.’” Cantrell, 666 F.3d at 920 (quoting\nDeShaney, 489 U.S. at 198). “[A] state may create a ‘special relationship’ with\na particular citizen, requiring the state to protect him from harm, ‘when the\nState takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will.’” Doe\nex rel. Magee v. Covington Cty. Sch. Dist., 675 F.3d 849, 856 (5th Cir. 2012) (en\nbanc) (quoting DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 199–200).\n\n\n                                       13\n\f    Case: 14-11020       Document: 00513282187         Page: 14     Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-11020\n       The Supreme Court has recognized a special relationship for\nincarcerated and involuntarily committed individuals, and the Fifth Circuit\nhas “extended the special relationship exception to the placement of children\nin foster care.” Covington Cty., 675 F.3d at 856 (citing Griffith v. Johnston, 899\nF.2d 1427, 1439 (5th Cir. 1990)). The rationale behind the special-relationship\nexception is that:\n       when the State by the affirmative exercise of its power so restrains\n       an individual’s liberty that it renders him unable to care for\n       himself, and at the same time fails to provide for his basic human\n       needs—e.g., food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and reasonable\n       safety—it transgresses the substantive limits on state action set\n       by the Eighth Amendment and the Due Process Clause.\n\nDeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200. This Court “has followed [DeShaney’s] language\nstrictly and ha[s] held consistently that only when the state, by its affirmative\nexercise of power, has custody over an individual involuntarily or against his\nwill does a ‘special relationship’ exist between the individual and the state.”\nWalton v. Alexander, 44 F.3d 1297, 1303 (5th Cir. 1995) (en banc) (emphasis in\noriginal).\n       Though the proper standard to apply to the denial of medical care to\nmental patients is unclear, 5 “courts applying . . . the ‘special relationship’\n\n\n       5 In Youngberg v. Romeo, decided before DeShaney, the Court concluded that “liability\nmay be imposed only when the decision by the [mental-health] professional is such a\nsubstantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to\ndemonstrate that the person actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.” 457 U.S.\n307, 323 (1982). This standard “flowed from the premise that ‘[p]ersons who have been\ninvoluntarily committed are entitled to more considerate treatment and conditions of\nconfinement than criminals whose conditions of confinement are designed to punish.’” Hare\nv. City of Corinth, Miss., 74 F.3d 633, 647 (5th Cir. 1996) (en banc) (quoting Youngberg, 457\nU.S. at 321–22). But in DeShaney, the Court “called into question the constitutional\nsignificance of this premise.” Id. In DeShaney, the Court “did not address whether\ninvoluntarily confined mental incompetents and convicted inmates shared the same\nconstitutional rights to medical care and safety.” Id. This Court observed that:\n       [s]ince DeShaney suggested that both groups enjoyed the same rights,\n       however, either the Youngberg standard or the deliberate indifference\n                                             14\n\f    Case: 14-11020       Document: 00513282187          Page: 15     Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-11020\nexception to the DeShaney rule . . . have generally required plaintiffs to\ndemonstrate . . . that the defendant state official at a minimum acted with\ndeliberate indifference toward the plaintiff.” McClendon v. City of Columbia,\n305 F.3d 314, 326 (5th Cir. 2002) (en banc) (per curiam) (emphasis in original).\n      “To act with deliberate indifference, a state actor must ‘know [ ] of and\ndisregard[ ] an excessive risk to [the victim’s] health or safety.” Id. at 326 n.8\n(alterations in original) (quoting Ewolski v. City of Brunswick, 287 F.3d 492,\n513 (6th Cir. 2002)); see also Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994)\n(“[T]he official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be\ndrawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw\nthe inference.”). “[A]ctual knowledge is critical to the inquiry. A state actor’s\nfailure to alleviate ‘a significant risk that he should have perceived but did\nnot[]’ . . . does not rise to the level of deliberate indifference.” McClendon, 305\nF.3d at 326 n.8 (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837). “A serious medical need is\none for which treatment has been recommended or for which the need is so\napparent that even laymen would recognize that care is required.” Gobert v.\nCaldwell, 463 F.3d 339, 345 n.12 (5th Cir. 2006).\n      The district court found a fact issue as to whether De Guzman and Dr.\nBrown “knew that Cornell suffered from a heart condition but nevertheless\nfailed to provide adequate medical care” in violation of Cornell’s Fourteenth\nAmendment right to medical care. Assuming without deciding that clearly\nestablished law creates a special relationship between the state and mentally\n\n\n      standard must give way to achieve the requisite equivalence in constitutional\n      rights. The Court thus has cast doubt on the vitality of Youngberg by\n      confirming that a deliberate indifference standard is the appropriate measure\n      of constitutional liability for a prison official’s failure to provide a convicted\n      inmate with basic human needs.\nId. Ultimately, this Court in Hare declined to answer the question with regard to\ninvoluntarily committed individuals, but it adopted a deliberate indifference standard for\npretrial detainees. Id.\n                                             15\n\f    Case: 14-11020    Document: 00513282187     Page: 16   Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-11020\nill individuals held involuntarily prior to formal commitment proceedings, we\nhold that Pena has not raised a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether\nDe Guzman and Dr. Brown violated Cornell’s constitutional rights.\n      In Domino v. Texas Department of Criminal Justice, this Court reversed\nthe denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds to a prison\npsychologist after an inmate committed suicide. 239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.\n2001). The inmate, who had a history of psychiatric issues, visited the\ndefendant–psychiatrist two hours prior to hanging himself. Id. at 753. The\ninmate “asked for sleeping pills,” which he was denied, “and expressed\napprehension about his upcoming transfer from administrative segregation to\nthe general prison population.” Id. The inmate then stated “I can be suicidal”\nand banged his head on the table so loudly that the guards outside the office\ncould hear. Id. at 753, 755. The psychiatrist had the inmate returned to his cell\nafter their five-minute meeting, and the inmate committed suicide two-and-a-\nhalf hours later. Id. at 753.\n      This Court reversed the district court’s denial of summary judgment\nbecause the record “would not permit a reasonable jury to conclude that [the\npsychiatrist] knew that Domino was a serious suicide risk.” Id. at 756. We\nnoted that “suicide is inherently difficult for anyone to predict,” and that\n“[d]eliberate indifference is an extremely high standard to meet.” Id. Moreover,\nthe psychiatrist “produced evidence that [the inmate] had been a difficult, often\nuncooperative patient and concluded that [the inmate] was threatening suicide\nto obtain secondary gain.” Id.\n      Domino establishes a high bar for deliberate indifference in this context,\nand the facts in this case do not reach that bar. Accepting the facts that the\ndistrict court found to support the denial of qualified immunity as we must—\nthat Dr. Brown and De Guzman knew of Cornell’s heart condition and did not\nprovide further care—the undisputed facts show that Cornell resisted the\n                                       16\n\f     Case: 14-11020    Document: 00513282187       Page: 17    Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-11020\nofficers when they tried to provide care. We cannot say that a reasonable jury\ncould conclude that the failure to treat a heart condition after a patient refuses\ncare and begins attacking staff amounts to deliberate indifference. Thus, we\nreverse the district court’s denial of qualified immunity to De Guzman and Dr.\nBrown.\nD.     Anderson, Nurse Brown, and Schierding (Supervisory Liability)\n       Anderson, Nurse Brown, and Schierding (the “Supervisory Appellants”)\nappeal the district court’s denial of qualified immunity on Pena’s § 1983\nsupervisory-liability claim. This Court has held supervisors “liable for\nconstitutional   violations    committed      by   subordinate    employees     when\nsupervisors act, or fail to act, with deliberate indifference to violations of others’\nconstitutional rights committed by their subordinates.” Aterberry v. Nocona\nGen. Hosp., 430 F.3d 245, 255 (5th Cir. 2005) (emphasis in original). The\nSupervisory Appellants argue the Supreme Court’s opinion in Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n556 U.S. 662 (2009) put the continued viability of § 1983 supervisory liability\nin question, and, therefore, they could not have violated clearly established\nlaw.\n       The district court separately considered whether supervisory liability\nremains clearly established after Iqbal. In light of its conclusions that the law\nclearly established the constitutional rights allegedly violated by the various\nsubordinates, the district court’s decision to address the impact of Iqbal on\n§ 1983 supervisory liability was sound. But we have answered these\nunderlying constitutional questions differently than the district court. As a\n\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f    Case: 14-11020       Document: 00513282187          Page: 18     Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-11020\nresult, we need not pronounce the fate of § 1983 supervisory liability post-\nIqbal. 6\n       Supervisory liability requires a constitutional violation by a subordinate.\nSee Aterberry, 430 F.3d at 255. As explained above, the evidence in this case\nwould not support a jury finding that Dr. Brown and De Guzman violated\nCornell’s due process rights by denying him adequate medical treatment for\nhis heart condition. With no underlying violation for denial of medical care, the\nSupervisory Defendants cannot be liable under § 1983 for any supervisory\ndeficiencies regarding the medical care provided to Parkland’s mental patients.\nThis is equally true in the context of the underlying substantive due process\nclaim against the psych techs.\n       We resolved the psych techs’ qualified immunity challenge based on a\ndifferent part of the qualified immunity standard: the lack of clarity on\nwhether physical restraint in the context of mental-health treatment is a\nseizure. Of course, this does not answer whether a constitutional violation did\nor did not occur. It simply answers whether the psych techs can be made to\naccount for it. But the unsettled nature of the law in this area likewise entitles\nthe Supervisory Appellants to qualified immunity. In Doe v. Taylor\nIndependent School District, we explained that supervisors are entitled to\nqualified immunity unless both the underlying constitutional right and the\nsupervisors’ duty with respect to that right were clearly established. 15 F.3d\nat 454; see also Poe v. Leonard, 282 F.3d 123, 134 (2d Cir. 2002) (“We conclude\nthat [plaintiff] must show that both laws were clearly established to lay the\n\n\n\n       6Although the particular facts of this case do not require us to address the Supervisory\nAppellants’ Iqbal argument, we note the many cases in the years since Iqbal in which we\nhave continued to apply our rigorous pre-Iqbal standards for supervisory liability. See, e.g.,\nBrauner v. Coody, 793 F.3d 493, 500–01 (5th Cir. 2015); Pierce v. Hearne Indep. Sch. Dist.,\n600 Fed. App’x 194, 199 (5th Cir. 2015); Whitley v.

Put simply, if the law did not put the psych techs on notice that\ntheir actions would be judged under the Fourth Amendment, then it cannot\nhave put the Supervisory Appellants on notice that they had a duty to ensure\ntheir subordinates were respecting patients’ Fourth Amendment rights.\n                             IV. CONCLUSION\n      For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court’s denial of\nqualified immunity and RENDER summary judgment for the appellants.\n\n\n\n\n                                      19\n\f",

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       In February 2011, Cornell arrived at a fire station and complained that\nhe was being chased. A fireman called the police, who, upon arrival, handcuffed\nCornell and took him to the Parkland psychiatric emergency room (the “Psych\nER”). Cornell was considered “APOWW, i.e., apprehended by a police officer\nwithout a warrant.” 1 Parkland is a state hospital.\nA.     Treatment at Parkland\n       Defendants–Appellants Dr. Kevin Brown and Nurse Sherwin De\nGuzman were present at Cornell’s intake, during which Dr. Shawn Chambers\ntook Cornell’s medical history. Cornell told Chambers that he had\n“tachycardia.” Cornell stated that “people had stolen his lottery ticket and were\nchasing him.” Cornell was admitted to the Psych ER pursuant to Dr. Brown’s\nauthorization.\n       Johnny Roberts, a technician in the Psych ER (a “psych tech”), took\nCornell’s vital signs, which registered as abnormally high. Cornell’s pulse was\n124 beats per minute, his blood pressure was 142/105 mm Hg, and his\nrespirations were 17 breaths per minute. Because Cornell’s pulse and blood\npressure readings were elevated, Roberts tried to take his vital signs again,\n\n\n\n       1  Texas law allows a police officer to take a person into custody without a warrant if\n“the officer . . . has reason to believe that (A) the person is a person with mental illness; and\n(B) because of that mental illness there is a substantial risk of serious harm to the person or\nto others unless the person is immediately restrained.” Tex. Health & Safety Code §\n573.001(a). The officer must “immediately transport” that person to the nearest appropriate\nmental-health facility. Id. § 573.001(d). The mental-health facility may detain that person\n“in custody for not longer than 48 hours after the time the person is presented to the facility\nunless a written order for protective custody is obtained.” Id. § 573.021(b). Appellees do not\nchallenge the officers’ grounds for bringing Cornell to Parkland.\n                                               2\n\f    Case: 14-11020    Document: 00513282187    Page: 3   Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                No. 14-11020\nbut the machine malfunctioned. Though Cornell had been cooperative up to\nthis point, he became agitated and refused to cooperate when Roberts\nattempted to take his vital signs a third time. Parkland staff provided no\nfurther cardiac treatment to Cornell.\n      Roberts asked Defendant–Appellant Robert Givens, another psych tech,\nfor assistance calming Cornell, but Cornell continued to resist and tried to\nleave the Psych ER. Roberts informed Dr. Brown of Cornell’s behavior. Givens\nput Cornell in either a “basket hold” or “elbow-to-hip containment,” and pushed\nhim into a seclusion room. The techs held Cornell on a mat on the floor. The\ntechs’ testimony conflicts as to whether Cornell was held on his side or his\nstomach.\n      De Guzman arrived and injected Cornell with a mixture of Haldol,\nAtivan, and Benadryl to subdue him. Haldol and Benadryl can cause cardiac\narrhythmia and death. The techs continued to hold Cornell down, though\ntestimony varies as to how long the hold lasted: Givens stated it lasted “a\nminute or two,” Roberts said “several minutes,” and De Guzman said “maybe\nfive minutes.”\n      After Givens and Roberts left the room, Cornell became agitated again.\nHe began yelling, and he ripped up a vinyl tile from the floor and banged it\nagainst the door. A third psych tech, Defendant–Appellant Alexander Achebe,\nconvinced Cornell to trade the tile for a juice box. The techs began to move\nCornell to a new room because he had ripped up the flooring. As they\napproached the second seclusion room, Cornell crushed the juice box and began\nphysically resisting the techs. They again restrained Cornell and put him on a\nmat in the room. Cornell received a second injection of the same medications.\n      Again, there is conflicting testimony about how Cornell was held on the\nmat. Accepting Pena’s version of the facts, Cornell was held on his stomach for\nfifteen minutes after the injection. Psych techs were trained not to hold a\n                                        3\n\f     Case: 14-11020   Document: 00513282187      Page: 4   Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-11020\npatient in a prone position for more than a minute, because longer holds can\ncause asphyxiation. The techs then left the room.\n      A nurse later found Cornell lying in a prone position in the room with his\nright arm beneath him and his hand pointed to the ceiling. His hand was\ncyanotic, and the nurse could not detect spontaneous respirations. The nurse\ncalled a code blue, and Cornell was transferred to the main emergency room,\nwhere he died. The medical examiner found abrasions on the left side of\nCornell’s forehead. After an investigation into Cornell’s death, the medical\nexaminer found the cause of death to be undetermined, listing three potential\ncauses: 1) mechanical compression; 2) underlying cardiac issues; or 3) effects\nof the medication he received in the Psych ER.\nB.    Supervision at Parkland\n      At the time of Cornell’s death, Defendant–Appellant Nancy Schierding\nwas Parkland’s Director of Nursing for Psychiatric Services. Defendant–\nAppellant Nurse Vernell Brown was Unit Manager III for the Psych ER and\nwas responsible for the Psych ER staff, including nurses and techs. At her\ndeposition, Schierding recalled other complaints of improper treatment in the\nPsych ER. A Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Report\nprepared after Cornell’s death noted that De Guzman’s restraint-and-seclusion\ntraining had lapsed at the time of the incident, as Nurse Brown and Schierding\nshould have been aware. At the time, Defendant–Appellant Dr. Ronnie\nAnderson was the CEO of Parkland.\n      In 2008, prior to Cornell’s death, CMS sent a letter to Anderson stating\nthat Parkland “fail[ed] to provide appropriate medical screening examination\nto determine whether an emergency medical condition existed” and that the\n“deficiencies [we]re so serious that they constitute an immediate threat to the\nhealth and safety of any individual that comes to [Parkland] with an\nemergency medical condition.” The CMS Report generated after Cornell’s\n                                       4\n\f     Case: 14-11020   Document: 00513282187     Page: 5    Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-11020\ndeath detailed ongoing problems, noting that, due to an unusually high\nnumber of complaints, injuries, and deaths, Parkland had been “under near\nconstant surveillance and investigation” by the Texas Department of State\nHealth Services and CMS.\nC.    Procedural History\n      Plaintiff–Appellee Onie Pena, as the representative of Cornell’s estate,\nfiled a complaint in Texas district court against Parkland and the Defendants–\nAppellants, among others. Parkland removed the case to federal court.\nRelevant to this appeal, Pena alleges that Givens and Achebe used excessive\nforce against Cornell in violation of the Fourth Amendment or, in the\nalternative, in violation of Cornell’s substantive due process rights. Pena\nalleges that De Guzman and Dr. Brown violated Cornell’s right to due process\nby denying him medical care for his heart condition. Finally, Pena avers that\nSchierding, Anderson, and Nurse Brown (collectively, “the Supervisory\nDefendants”) contributed to these constitutional violations by inadequately\nsupervising the Psych ER.\n      The Appellants moved for summary judgment, arguing that they are\nentitled to qualified immunity. The district court denied their motions, and\nAppellants filed timely notices of interlocutory appeal.\n                             II. JURISDICTION\n      This Court has jurisdiction over the denial of a motion for summary\njudgment based on qualified immunity, but this jurisdiction is severely limited,\n“for it extends to such appeals only to the extent that the denial of summary\njudgment turns on an issue of law.” Kinney v.

DISCUSSION\nA.    Legal Standard\n      This Court “review[s] the district court’s denial of qualified immunity de\nnovo, accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and viewing them in the light\nmost favorable to the plaintiff.” Cantrell v.

The\nburden to establish the inapplicability of qualified immunity is on Pena. See\nCantrell, 666 F.3d at 918.\n      We apply “a two-step analysis to determine whether a defendant is\nentitled to summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.” Id. at 922.\nFirst, “we determine whether, viewing the summary judgment evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the plaintiff, the defendant violated the plaintiff’s\nconstitutional rights.” Id.

Second, we ask “whether the defendant’s actions were objectively\nunreasonable in light of clearly established law at the time of the conduct in\nquestion.” Id. (quoting Freeman, 483 F.3d at 411). We may exercise our\ndiscretion in deciding which of the two prongs to address first. Id.\n      For a right to be clearly established under the second prong of qualified\nimmunity, “[t]he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a\nreasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.”\nKinney, 367 F.3d at 349–50 (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 640\n(1987)). “This requirement establishes a high bar.” Wyatt v.

To hold that law is clearly established, we must “be\nable to point to ‘controlling authority—or a robust consensus of persuasive\nauthority—that defines the contours of the right in question with a high degree\nof particularity.’” Id.

Givens and Achebe (Excessive Force and Substantive Due\n      Process)\n      Pena claims that Givens and Achebe (collectively “the psych techs”) used\nexcessive force against Cornell in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Pena\nalso maintains that the psych techs violated Cornell’s substantive due process\nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court denied qualified\nimmunity on the Fourth Amendment claim but did not discuss the Fourteenth\nAmendment claim. We address each claim in turn.\n      1. Fourth Amendment Excessive Force\n      To establish a Fourth Amendment excessive-force claim, “a plaintiff\nmust first show that she was seized. Next she must show that she suffered (1)\nan injury that (2) resulted directly and only from the use of force that was\nexcessive to the need and (3) the force used was objectively unreasonable.”\nFlores v. City of Palacios, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"36003\"><a href=\"/opinion/36003/flores-v-city-of-palacios/\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 396 (5th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted).\n      The district court held that Cornell’s Fourth Amendment rights were\nclearly established based, explaining that “several courts have found that\n\n                                        7\n\f    Case: 14-11020     Document: 00513282187     Page: 8   Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-11020\n[police officers] restraining a suspect or patient in a prone position can\nconstitute excessive force” and that “the technicians were trained not to use\nthis kind of hold for extended periods of time.” The district court found that the\npsych techs’ “restraint of Cornell was not intended to treat his condition but\nrather to subdue him and prevent him from leaving the hospital.” Quoting the\nSixth Circuit’s decision in McKenna v. Edgell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"173456\"><a href=\"/opinion/173456/mckenna-v-edgell/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 438–39 (6th Cir.\n2010), the district court reasoned: “[E]xposure to liability does not depend\nmerely on the profession of the government actors.”\n      Yet, as noted, before a court can consider whether the forced used was\nexcessive, “a plaintiff must first show that she was seized.” Flores, 381 F.3d at\n396. Qualified immunity thus attaches unless the law is clearly established\nthat the defendant’s conduct amounted to a seizure. See id. at 400\n(determining, before looking to the amount of force used, that “[i]t was clearly\nestablished that stopping a moving car by intentionally shooting it constitutes\na seizure”). Givens and Achebe contend that “it was not clearly established law\nthat medical personnel who restrain patients while rendering aid have ‘seized’\nthe patient for Fourth Amendment purposes.”\n      This Court has held implicitly that a person taken into custody by police\nofficers under Texas Health and Safety Code § 573.001 is seized under the\nFourth Amendment. See Cantrell, 666 F.3d at 923 (holding that Texas police\nofficers who had probable cause to believe the plaintiff that they detained was\na danger to herself were qualifiedly immune). We are, however, unaware of a\ncase extending Fourth Amendment seizure law to mental-health facilities and\nworkers that take custody of these individuals pursuant to Texas Health and\nSafety Code § 573.021, which authorizes a mental-health facility to\ntemporarily hold parties brought into custody pursuant to § 573.001.\n      Moreover, in Peete v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville & Davidson\nCounty, the Sixth Circuit “f[ound] no case authority holding that paramedics\n                                        8\n\f    Case: 14-11020       Document: 00513282187   Page: 9   Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-11020\nanswering a 911 emergency request for help engage in a Fourth Amendment\n‘seizure’ of the person when restraining the person to render aid.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797723\"><a href=\"/opinion/797723/stephanie-peete-v-metropolitan-government-of-nashville-and-davidson-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 219 (6th Cir. 2007). In that case, paramedics were called to render aid to\nan epileptic man experiencing a seizure. Id. at 219–20. The paramedics\nrestrained the man by “using their bodies to apply weight and pressure to [the\nepileptic’s] head, neck, shoulders, arms, torso, and legs in an attempt to\nprevent the decedent from moving”; they “tied his hands and ankles behind his\nback and continued to apply pressure to [him] while he was in a prone\nposition.” Id. at 220.\n      In its opinion, the Sixth Circuit distinguished Champion v. Outlook\nNashville, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787454\"><a href=\"/opinion/787454/calvin-b-champion-v-outlook-nashville-inc-debbie-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2004), a case on which the district court\nhere heavily relied. See Peete, 486 F.3d at 221–222. Champion involved a\n§ 1983 Fourth Amendment excessive-force claim brought against several police\nofficers. 380 F.3d at 895–96. That case turned on a custodial arrest by the\npolice of a severely autistic man who had become violent with his caretaker.\nId. In that case, the plaintiff, Champion, struggled with the officers during the\ncourse of the arrest. Id. at 896–97. Looking at the facts in the light most\nfavorable to the plaintiff, the court found that the officers remained on top of\nChampion even after he stopped resisting “and sprayed him with pepper spray\neven after he was immobilized by handcuffs and a hobbling device.” Id. at 901.\nChampion, who began vomiting after several minutes of being held down, was\ndead upon arrival at the hospital. Id. at 898. The court held that Champion’s\narrest amounted to a clearly established unreasonable seizure under the\nFourth Amendment. Id. at 901–902.\n      Importantly, in Peete, the Sixth Circuit found that Champion did not\napply to the paramedics’ conduct because the paramedics “were not acting to\nenforce the law, deter, or incarcerate.” 486 F.3d at 222. As the court explained,\n\n\n                                        9\n\f    Case: 14-11020    Document: 00513282187      Page: 10    Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-11020\nthe paramedics “were unlike the police officers in Champion who handcuffed\nand shackled the plaintiff in order to arrest and incapacitate him.” Id.\n      The Sixth Circuit addressed the applicability of Peete to police officers\nrendering medical aid in McKenna v. Edgell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"173456\"><a href=\"/opinion/173456/mckenna-v-edgell/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2010).\nOfficers were the first responders to a 911 call requesting assistance for a man\nhaving a seizure; the officers handcuffed the man, though the reasons for the\nrestraint were disputed. Id. at 435–36. The officers argued that they were\nentitled to qualified immunity based on Peete; the plaintiff countered that Peete\nwas inapplicable because Peete concerned paramedics. Id. at 438–39. The Sixth\nCircuit held that whether the Fourth Amendment applied hinged on “whether\nthe [officials] acted in a law-enforcement capacity or in an emergency-medical-\nresponse capacity.” Id. at 439–40.\n      We hold it was not clearly established that psych techs conduct in this\ncase amounted to a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Although whether\nthe Fourth Amendment applies does not turn solely on whether the\ngovernment officials were police officers, see McKenna, 617 F.3d at 438–39, the\nSixth Circuit has held that whether Peete applies should depend on “whether\nthe [officials] acted in a law-enforcement capacity or in an emergency-medical-\nresponse capacity,” id. at 439. Pena cites no binding authority holding that a\nmedical professional’s restraint of an individual in an emergency medical\nsituation constitutes a Fourth Amendment seizure. Champion, relied upon by\nboth the district court and Pena, involved police officers’ use of force after they\nhad already seized an individual. Under McKenna, even police officers’ use of\nrestraint does not implicate the Fourth Amendment if they are acting in an\n“emergency-medical-response capacity,” id. at 439–40.\n      Pena points to no “controlling authority—or a robust consensus of\npersuasive authority,” Wyatt, 718 F.3d at 503 (quoting Morgan, 659 F.3d at\n371–72), suggesting that medical personnel “seize” patients when restraining\n                                        10\n\f    Case: 14-11020       Document: 00513282187          Page: 11     Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-11020\nthem in the course of providing treatment. 2 Therefore, we hold that Pena has\nnot carried her burden, see Cantrell, 666 F.3d at 918, and that Givens and\nAchebe are entitled to qualified immunity on the excessive-force claims.\n       2. Substantive Due Process\n       The district court did not discuss Pena’s Fourteenth Amendment\nsubstantive due process claim in its order denying qualified immunity. 3\nBecause Givens and Achebe argued that they were entitled to qualified\nimmunity on this issue in their motion for summary judgment, we read the\ndistrict court’s order as a denial without explanation. Where the district court\ndenies summary judgment on qualified immunity without explanation, this\nCourt “review[s] the record to determine what conduct the district court\nattributed to [the defendant] in finding that he had violated clearly established\nlaw.” Petta v.

If, however, Cornell was not “seized” for Fourth Amendment purposes, then\nPena may raise a substantive due process claim. See id. at 843–44.\n        4 Givens and Achebe concede that “it was clearly established as of the date of the\n\nincident that state officials could not engage in conscience-shocking behavior.” We thus focus\non whether the behavior of Givens and Achebe shocks the conscience.\n                                             11\n\f    Case: 14-11020     Document: 00513282187      Page: 12    Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-11020\n      “[I]n a due process challenge to executive action, the threshold question\nis whether the behavior of the governmental officer is so egregious, so\noutrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.”\nLewis, 523 U.S. at 847 n.8. “[T]he constitutional concept of conscience shocking\nduplicates no traditional category of common-law fault, but rather points\nclearly away from liability, or clearly toward it, only at the ends of the tort\nlaw’s spectrum of culpability.” Id. at 848. The officials’ actions must be “grossly\ndisproportionate to the need for action under the circumstances and . . .\ninspired by malice rather than merely careless or unwise excess of zeal.” Petta,\n143 F.3d at 902.\n      Pena argues that “the use of life-threatening and prohibited restraints\nby Givens and Achebe on Cornell was ‘grossly disproportionate to the need for\naction under the circumstances.’” Pena insists that a reasonable factfinder\ncould infer that Givens and Achebe were inspired by malice because this type\nof restraint violated their training. Pena supports her argument with the Sixth\nCircuit’s unpublished decision in Davis v. Pickell, 562 F. App’x 387 (6th Cir.\n2014).\n      In Davis, the Sixth Circuit affirmed a district court’s denial of officers’\nmotions for summary judgment on qualified immunity. Id. at 387. An arrestee\nwas removed from a holding cell, “taken to a safety cell with his hands behind\nhis back, . . . sprayed with mace[,] and slammed to the ground in the hallway.”\nId. at 389. Assuming that the arrestee “was neither threatening nor resisting\nthe officers,” the court held that “the force they used . . . shocks the conscience.”\nId. at 392.\n      As Givens and Achebe point out, Cornell concededly resisted Parkland\nstaff. Indeed, all of the cases cited by Pena, in both the Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendment contexts, involve the use of force on non-resistant subjects.\nMoreover, Pena gives too much weight to the fact that Givens and Achebe\n                                         12\n\f     Case: 14-11020   Document: 00513282187     Page: 13   Date Filed: 11/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-11020\nviolated their training by holding Cornell in a prone position for an extended\nperiod of time. The Supreme Court has stated that, even in the context of a\nFourth Amendment excessive-force claim, “if an officer acts contrary to her\ntraining, . . . that does not itself negate qualified immunity where it would\notherwise be warranted.” Sheehan, 135 S. Ct. at 1777. Though Givens and\nAchebe’s behavior is concerning, no reasonable jury could conclude that it was\n“grossly disproportionate to the need for action under the circumstances and\n[was] inspired by malice rather than merely careless or unwise excess of zeal.”\nPetta, 143 F.3d at 902; see also Lewis, 523 U.S. at 848.

This Court has held supervisors “liable for\nconstitutional   violations    committed      by   subordinate    employees     when\nsupervisors act, or fail to act, with deliberate indifference to violations of others’\nconstitutional rights committed by their subordinates.” Aterberry v.

In light of its conclusions that the law\nclearly established the constitutional rights allegedly violated by the various\nsubordinates, the district court’s decision to address the impact of Iqbal on\n§ 1983 supervisory liability was sound.

As explained above, the evidence in this case\nwould not support a jury finding that Dr. Brown and De Guzman violated\nCornell’s due process rights by denying him adequate medical treatment for\nhis heart condition. With no underlying violation for denial of medical care, the\nSupervisory Defendants cannot be liable under § 1983 for any supervisory\ndeficiencies regarding the medical care provided to Parkland’s mental patients.\nThis is equally true in the context of the underlying substantive due process\nclaim against the psych techs.\n       We resolved the psych techs’ qualified immunity challenge based on a\ndifferent part of the qualified immunity standard: the lack of clarity on\nwhether physical restraint in the context of mental-health treatment is a\nseizure. Of course, this does not answer whether a constitutional violation did\nor did not occur. It simply answers whether the psych techs can be made to\naccount for it. But the unsettled nature of the law in this area likewise entitles\nthe Supervisory Appellants to qualified immunity. In Doe v. Taylor\nIndependent School District, we explained that supervisors are entitled to\nqualified immunity unless both the underlying constitutional right and the\nsupervisors’ duty with respect to that right were clearly established. 15 F.3d\nat 454; see also Poe v.
