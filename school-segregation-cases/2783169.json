ROELL, ET AL.,                                                    Appellees.\n\n\n                    On appeal from the 156th District Court\n                         of Live Oak County, Texas.\n\n\n                         MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n                 Before Justices Yañez, Benavides, and Vela\n                  Memorandum Opinion by Justice Yañez\n\n       By various sub- issues, appellant Bernard Buecker contends the trial court abused\n\nits discretion in imposing sanctions against him and in favor of appellee, Joseph C. Roell.\n\nBecause we conclude the trial court abused its discretion in imposing the sanctions, we\n\nreverse the sanctions orders.\n\f                                                 Background1\n\n         Buecker is an attorney, and Roell is a former physician.2 On March 2, 2000, Roell’s\n\n“close personal friend” and patient, Christine Wesner Standifer, died.3 Several days later,\n\nRoell asserted to a court that Standifer had confided her wishes to him regarding the\n\ndisposition of her estate, and that she had a will naming him executor of her estate. Roell\n\nrequested, and was granted, permission to search Standifer’s home for the will. On June\n\n27, 2000, Roell filed an application to probate Standifer’s will, which named him as her\n\npersonal representative. The will bequeathed: (1) Standifer’s real estate and personal\n\nproperty to Roell; (2) her jewelry (“except that given to [her] by [Roell]”) to Sandra\n\nGilkerson; (3) $10,000 to Mary Sanders; and (4) $10.00 each to her stepbrother, Michael\n\nGollmer, and her two stepsons.\n\n         On August 16, 2000, Buecker, as counsel for Gollmer, filed a plea in intervention\n\nchallenging Roell’s designation as executor.4 On May 3, 2001, Buecker filed (on Gollmer’s\n\nbehalf) an amended plea in intervention, stating that Roell should not be named as\n\nexecutor because he was being sued by the Texas Medical Board for causing Standifer’s\n\ndeath by over-prescribing drugs. On June 28, 2001, the court appointed William L.\n\nHardwick as temporary administrator of Standifer’s estate.\n\n\n\n        1\n           W e rely prim arily on appellant’s statem ent of facts. See T EX . R. A PP . P. 38.1(g) (providing that an\nappellate court will accept facts as stated in appellant’s brief as true unless contradicted by another party).\nHere, Roell has filed a four-page pro se “Reply” to appellant’s brief, which includes several paragraphs\nentitled, “Facts as I See Them .” However, Roell’s “facts” prim arily challenge Buecker’s objectivity and the\nvalidity of the findings of the Texas State Board of Medical Exam iners, which led to the Board’s revocation\nof Roell’s license to practice m edicine.\n\n        2\n             Roell’s license to practice m edicine was revoked on August 16, 2002.\n\n         3\n             Standifer was Roell’s patient from approxim ately 1993 until her death in March 2000.\n\n         4\n             The August 16, 2000 plea in intervention is not included in the record before us.\n\n                                                         2\n\f         On August 5, 2001, the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners filed its Second\n\nAmended Complaint against Roell, alleging multiple violations of the Medical Practice Act,5\n\nincluding allegations that Roell “violat[ed] the standard of care” by unsafely allowing\n\nStandifer to self-administer intravenous narcotics and that Standifer “died of a drug\n\noverdose.” Buecker asserts that on February 28, 2002, he sent a “notice-of-claim” for\n\nmedical malpractice letter to Roell, with copies to Roell’s counsel and Hardwick, the\n\ntemporary administrator.6\n\n         On August 16, 2002, the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners issued its final\n\norder, by which it revoked Roell’s license to practice medicine. The final order consists of\n\ntwenty-six pages of findings of fact and conclusions of law, which included findings that\n\nRoell treated Standifer “with strong, addictive pain medications without adequate medical\n\njustification” and that his “long-term treatment of [her] with injectable narcotics caused\n\ninjection site abscesses [sic].” Buecker received a copy of the Board’s order in late\n\nSeptember 2002. In late December 2002 , Hardwick resigned as temporary administrator\n\nof the estate.\n\n         In March 2003, Buecker (on Gollmer’s behalf) filed a handwriting analysis report,\n\nwhich concluded that Standifer’s purported signature on the will offered for probate by\n\nRoell was not genuine.7 The court appointed Mark Eggert as the second temporary\n\n\n         5\n             See T EX . O C C . C OD E A N N . §§ 155.001-167.202 (Vernon 2004 & Supp. 2009).\n\n         6\n           See T EX . C IV . P RAC . & R EM . C OD E A N N . § 74.051 (Vernon 2005). Buecker subm itted a copy of the\nletter as a “Supplem ent” to his “Appendix.” However, docum ents that appear solely in the appendix of a brief\nare not part of the record and are generally not considered on appeal. See Till v. Thomas, 10 S.W .3d 730,\n733-34 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 1999, no pet.). Thus, we do not consider the letter on appeal.\n\n\n         7\n          The handwriting analysis report, which is included in the record, is dated April 2, 2001.              No\nexplanation is provided as to why it was not presented to the court until alm ost two years later.\n\n                                                         3\n\fadministrator of the estate. On May 16, 2003, the court appointed Buecker as the third\n\ntemporary administrator, an appointment which became effective on July 17, 2003, upon\n\nthe posting of a $10,000.00 bond.\n\n        On August 28, 2003, Buecker, as administrator of Standifer’s estate, filed a medical\n\nnegligence claim against Roell. The petition asserted two “exceptions” to the statute of\n\nlimitations: (1) that Roell’s malpractice was not discovered within the statutory period; and\n\n(2) that Buecker became aware of Roell’s negligence pursuant to the State Board of\n\nMedical Examiners’ report, but that he lacked the capacity to file suit until he (Buecker) was\n\nappointed administrator of Standifer’s estate.\n\n        On February 9, 2004, Roell filed a traditional motion for summary judgment, arguing\n\nthat Buecker’s suit was time-barred by the two-year statute of limitations.8 In his motion,\n\nRoell argued that Buecker had actual knowledge of the alleged malpractice by May 3,\n\n2001, if not earlier—well within the statutory period. He also argued that Buecker had the\n\ncapacity “to insist that this malpractice lawsuit be brought within the statutory period.”\n\n        On April 14, 2004, Buecker filed a response to Roell’s motion. In the response,\n\nBuecker asserted that he was not a party entitled to sue under section 71.004 of the civil\n\npractice and remedies code9 and that he had no standing to sue until after his appointment\n\nas administrator in July 2003.10 Buecker’s response also asserted causes of action for\n\nfraud and breach of fiduciary duty, which carry a four-year statute of limitations.\n\n\n\n        8\n            See T EX . C IV . P RAC . & R EM . C OD E A N N . § 74.251 (Vernon 2005).\n\n        9\n          See id. § 71.004 (Vernon 2008) (providing for wrongful death action accruing to surviving spouse,\nchildren, and parents of a deceased for their own dam ages suffered as a result of the death of the decedent).\n\n        10\n          See id. § 71.021 (providing for a survival of cause of action, by which a decedent m ay have sought\nrecovery for personal injuries, pain and suffering, and other dam ages suffered prior to his or her death).\n\n                                                             4\n\f        On April 19, 2004, Roell filed a brief and reply to Buecker’s response, in which he\n\nargued that because Buecker failed to file an expert report as required by the medical\n\nliability statute, he was entitled to (1) dismissal of the health care liability claim against him,\n\nand (2) sanctions consisting of his attorneys’ fees and costs in an amount of $7,500.00.11\n\nOn June 18, 2004, the trial court granted Roell’s motion for summary judgment as to\n\nBuecker’s medical malpractice claim on the basis of limitations.\n\n        On August 13, 2004, Roell filed a motion for attorneys’ fees and costs, again arguing\n\nhe was entitled to such fees and costs under the medical liability statute. The motion\n\nrequested $18,500 in attorneys’ fees and $508.15 in expenses and interest. Attached to\n\nthe motion were thirteen pages detailing over 123 hours in legal services rendered to Roell.\n\n        On December 16, 2005, Buecker filed a second amended petition, in which he\n\nadded Nancy McDonald as a defendant, and asserted a claim for conspiracy to commit\n\nfraud.12 On February 8, 2007, Buecker (1) filed a third amended petition, adding a claim\n\nfor conversion,13 and (2) non-suited the claims against McDonald.14 On February 12, 2007,\n\nBuecker filed a motion for non-suit of Roell, without prejudice.15\n\n        On February 16, 2007, the trial court held a hearing on Roell’s pending motion for\n\n\n\n        11\n             See id. § 74.351(b) (Vernon Supp. 2009).\n\n        12\n           On April 21, 2003, Nancy McDonald, a nurse form erly em ployed by Roell, subm itted a letter to Mark\nEggert, then adm inistrator of Standifer’s estate, requesting paym ent in the am ount of $32,611.50 in storage\nfees for the storage of two boats and an autom obile that belonged to the estate. Buecker contends that\nalthough he had no authority to do so, Roell ordered the boats and vehicle stored on property that he owned,\nthen claim ed to have paid “storage fees,” and conspired with McDonald to obtain reim bursem ent from the\nestate for paym ent of such fees.\n\n        13\n             Buecker alleged that the defendants converted the two boats and vehicle for their own use.\n\n        14\n             The court granted the estate’s non-suit of claim s against McDonald on February 16, 2007.\n\n        15\n             The court granted the m otion for non-suit as to Roell on February 12, 2007.\n\n                                                        5\n\fattorneys’ fees, even though Roell had been non-suited.16 On the same day as the\n\nhearing, Roell filed a motion for sanctions, contending that Buecker’s pleadings, motions,\n\nand other documents were filed in violation of rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure\n\nand chapter 10 of the civil practice and remedies code.17 At the February 16 hearing,\n\nRoell’s counsel presented a statement of attorneys’ fees incurred by Roell’s prior counsel.18\n\nRoell testified that he had not paid the full amount reflected on the statement, and did not\n\nrecall what amount he had paid. Buecker’s attorney noted that in 2001, prior to filing suit\n\nin 2003, Buecker had filed a copy of the State Board of Medical Examiners’ Second\n\nAmended Complaint and its Final Order with the probate court. Roell’s counsel argued that\n\nhe was entitled to $18,500 in attorneys’ fees plus expenses because of Buecker’s failure\n\nto file an expert report under the medical liability statute. Buecker’s counsel argued that\n\n(1) the statute was not applicable because Roell was not a physician at the time he was\n\nsued, and (2) that the Board of Medical Examiners’ final report satisfied the requirement\n\nfor an expert report. After advising the parties that he “[couldn’t] tell which case was\n\nhandled more miserably, the case on behalf of the petitioner or the case on behalf of the\n\ndefendant,” the trial court awarded $5,000 in attorneys’ fees plus filing fees to Roell solely\n\non the issue of Buecker’s failure to produce an expert report in compliance with the\n\nmedical malpractice statute.19\n\n\n        16\n           In his August 13, 2004 m otion for attorneys’ fees, Roell’s prior counsel requested $18,500 in\nattorneys’ fees and $508.15 in expenses.\n\n        17\n             See T EX . C IV . P RAC . & R EM . C OD E A N N . § 10.001-.004 (Vernon 2002); T EX . R. C IV . P. 13.\n\n        18\n           At the tim e of the hearing, Roell’s prior counsel, R. W . R odriguez, was in jail. The tim e sheet\nreflected fees up to around the tim e sum m ary judgm ent was granted in 2004.\n\n        19\n             The trial court’s order ordering Buecker to pay Roell $5,000 in attorneys’ fees is dated May 23,\n2007.\n\n                                                              6\n\f       On May 23, 2007, Roell filed a “Motion for New Trial on Sanctions,” in which he\n\nargued that the trial court erred in refusing to consider his earlier-filed motions for\n\nsanctions. On July 27, 2007, the trial court granted a new trial on the issue of sanctions.\n\nOn August 23, 2007, Buecker filed a notice of appeal, prior to the new trial hearing on\n\nRoell’s motion for sanctions.\n\n       On October 27, 2007, the trial court held a hearing on Roell’s February 16, 2007\n\nmotion for sanctions.20 At the hearing, the following persons testified: Buecker, Roell,\n\nR.W. Rodriguez (Roell’s prior counsel), and Charles R. Manning (Roell’s then-present\n\ncounsel).\n\n       Rodriguez testified that he represented Roell in the medical malpractice suit filed by\n\nBuecker. Rodriguez testified that after researching the issue, he told Buecker in December\n\n2003 that the medical malpractice statute had a strict two-year statute of limitations, with\n\nno exception for the discovery rule. In Rodriguez’s opinion, Buecker added the common-\n\nlaw claims because he knew the trial court likely would grant summary judgment in Roell’s\n\nfavor on the medical malpractice claims on the issue of limitations. Rodriguez did not\n\ninvestigate the fraud and breach of fiduciary duty claims against Roell because the\n\n“easiest” way to defend against those claims was to rely on Buecker’s failure to respond\n\nto discovery requests, including requests for admissions. Rodriguez did not investigate\n\nBuecker’s conversion claim or Roell’s relationship with McDonald because he was relying\n\non the deemed admissions. For the same reason, he did not investigate the claim that\n\nthere was a lien against the estate for $32,611. Rodriguez testified that his attorneys’ fees\n\n\n       20\n          W e note that the Honorable Joel B. Johnson presided over the February 16, 2007 hearing.\nHowever, the Honorable Ronald M. Yeager, Senior Retired Judge, presided over the O ctober 27, 2007\nhearing.\n\n                                                7\n\fthrough June 2004 totaled about $18,500, and that approximately sixty to seventy percent\n\nof that amount could have been avoided had Buecker accepted that his suit was barred\n\nby limitations.21\n\n        On cross-examination, Rodriguez admitted that he did not segregate his fees\n\nbetween the medical malpractice claims and the common-law claims. Rodriguez testified\n\nthat he did not pay too much attention to the report that Standifer’s signature on the will\n\nwas not genuine “because again of the admissions.”\n\n        Roell testified that Standifer had not told him that she had a will or who her executor\n\nwas. Roell did not know where the will was prepared; he knew that the two witnesses to\n\nthe will were his patients, but he had not talked to them about it. Roell testified that he was\n\nfriends with Standifer and her deceased husband. According to Roell, after Standifer died,\n\nher bank called and notified him that he was authorized to write checks on her bank\n\naccount. The bank sent him a check for around $800.00, which was the balance in the\n\naccount. Roell testified that because the estate’s two boats and vehicle were becoming\n\novergrown with weeds and were being “vandalized,” he made arrangements to have those\n\nitems stored by Robert Buerger. Roell testified that he did not recall any specifics about\n\nthe storage arrangements. Roell also did not recall whether he had ever requested\n\nreimbursement for the $32,611.50 in storage fees. Roell testified that on the day of the\n\nFebruary 16, 2007 hearing, Buecker told him that he would “follow [Roell] through the gates\n\nof hell” to seek justice for Standifer.\n\n        On cross-examination, Roell was shown the motion he submitted to search\n\n\n        21\n          Rodriguez was later recalled as a witness and testified that he did not know what his fees were from\nJuly 2004 through Decem ber 2004. He testified that from January 2005 through August 2006, his fees were\napproxim ately $15,560.00.\n\n                                                      8\n\fStandifer’s house for her will. Roell testified that did not recall the document. Roell\n\nconceded that Standifer’s will awarded him all of her real estate, but stated that “[Standifer]\n\ngave it to me to dispose of.” Roell also admitted that the will awards Standifer’s jewelry to\n\nSandra Gilkerson, except for the jewelry that he had given to Standifer. Roell did not recall\n\nanything about the patients who had witnessed the will. Roell also did not recall anything\n\nabout how he was supposed to dispose of Standifer’s property. According to Roell, he\n\ncouldn’t “recall hardly anything about [the will].”\n\n       Manning testified that at his hourly rate of $120.00, his attorneys’ fees for working\n\non the sanctions issue amounted to $1,150.00, plus his time spent at the hearing, for a\n\ntotal of around $1,500.00.\n\n       Buecker testified that when he filed the medical malpractice action, he believed that\n\nthere may be two applicable exceptions to the statute of limitations: (1) the one-year delay\n\nin filing suit if an executor administrator is appointed and (2) the date-of-discovery\n\nexception. Buecker said he learned of the revocation of Roell’s license (and the Board’s\n\nfindings regarding Roell’s treatment of Standifer) in August 2002. Buecker testified that\n\nthe filing of the medical malpractice claim against Roell was based on the Board’s findings.\n\nBuecker testified that before he was appointed administrator, he tried to get the existing\n\nadministrator of the estate to file the medical negligence action. As soon as Buecker was\n\nnamed administrator, he filed the medical negligence action against Roell. With regard to\n\nthe basis for the common-law claims, Buecker testified that he knew (1) on the same day\n\nthat $52,000 was deposited into Standifer’s bank account, Roell became the beneficiary\n\nof the account and a joint signatory on the account; and (2) the same day that $52,000 was\n\ndeposited, there was a $5,000 cash withdrawal on the account. Buecker testified that after\n\n\n                                               9\n\fhe became administrator, he received a bill, submitted by Nancy McDonald, for payment\n\nof $32,611.50 in “storage fees” for storing the two boats and automobile belonging to the\n\nestate.22 According to Buecker, Roell denied owning the property where the speed boat\n\nbelonging to the estate was stored, but Buecker later learned that Roell did own the\n\nproperty. Buecker testified that the fraud claim was based in part on the request to the\n\nestate for reimbursement of the “storage fees.” The breach of fiduciary duty claim was\n\nbased on Roell’s doctor/patient relationship with Standifer and the fact that Roell obtained\n\nan interest in her bank account upon her death. The claims against Nancy McDonald were\n\nbased on the request for reimbursement of the storage fees. The claims for conversion\n\nwere based on Roell’s taking the two boats and automobile without authorization.\n\n        Buecker testified that he interviewed the witnesses to Standifer’s will. One of the\n\nwitnesses, interviewed at 10:00 in the morning, told Buecker the will was signed at the\n\nclinic; the witness kept asking Buecker for beer. Buecker located the other witness, but\n\nwas unable to talk to him because he was “shaking” and “looked like he was having a\n\nseizure withdrawal or something.” Buecker testified that after he submitted the expert\n\nreport stating that Standifer’s signature on the will was non-genuine, Roell withdrew his\n\napplication to probate the will. Buecker also testified that he learned from the Beeville\n\nPolice Department that Roell was known in the community as “Dr. Feel Good.” Buecker\n\ntestified that he non-suited the claims after he “got the [estate’s] property back.”\n\n        At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court gave the parties an opportunity to\n\nsubmit any additional arguments. On February 13, 2008, the trial judge that presided over\n\n\n\n        22\n             The storage receipts reflect that the estate’s two boats and autom obile were stored within about\nthirty-five days after Standifer’s death.\n\n                                                     10\n\fthe October 27, 2007 hearing held a hearing on the proposed judgment. At the hearing,\n\nthe trial court explained how it arrived at its order that Buecker should pay Roell $30,\n\n841.00 as sanctions for expenses and attorneys’ fees, plus post-judgment interest. The\n\ntrial court explained that (1) it included the $5,000 awarded on February 16, 2007 in the\n\n$30,841.00; and (2) it awarded 60% of $18, 500.00, which is $11,100.00, plus $15,560.00,\n\nplus $4,181.00, for a total of $30,841.00.\n\n        On March 11, 2008, the trial court signed findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\nGenerally, the findings and conclusions included the following: (1) Buecker failed to\n\nestablish why his medical malpractice claim could not have been filed within the two-year\n\nstatute of limitations; (2) Buecker’s common-law claims were filed outside the applicable\n\nstatutes of limitations; (3) Buecker’s original and amended petitions violated rule 13 and\n\nsection 10 of the civil practice and remedies code, in that the claims were brought in bad\n\nfaith and to harass Roell; and (4) the award of $30,841.00 is no more than necessary to\n\nsatisfy the purpose of rule 215.2 of the rules of civil procedure.\n\n                              Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n        A trial court's imposition of sanctions is reviewed for abuse of discretion.23 An\n\nassessment of sanctions will be reversed only if the trial court acted without reference to\n\nany guiding rules and principles, such that its ruling was arbitrary or unreasonable. 24 The\n\ntrial court does not abuse its discretion if it bases its decision on conflicting evidence and\n\nsome evidence supports its decision.25 However, a trial court abuses its discretion when\n\n        23\n           Unifund CCR Partners v.

As the party moving for sanctions, Roell was required to prove\n\nBuecker’s subjective state of mind.39 Here, there was no evidence that Buecker had any\n\nimproper purpose of harassment or improper motive.

Now, Dr. Roell, have you seen any other\n       indications—or let me ask you what other indications you have seen that\n       leaves you to think that this action has been maintained and kept going for\n       so many years to harass you?\n\n       A [Roell]: I don’t think—my own personal opinion he did not act in good faith.\n       At the results of the mediation he wanted $10,000 legal fees—\n\n       ....\n\n       Q: Beyond that you really can’t go into it, but what other evidence do you\n       have or you think supports your view that he was harassing you?\n\n       A: Just continuation of paper after paper[,] allegation after allegation[,] some\n       of his remarks in court[,] calling me Dr. Feel Good and some of the other\n       things that he got out of the pleadings of the Texas State Board of Medical\n       Examiners; [he] just really berated me.\n\n       Buecker testified that when he filed the petition for medical negligence, he relied on\n\nthe facts in the report of the State Board of Medical Examiners, which found that Roell had\n\nviolated the standard of care with regard to several patients, including Standifer. Buecker\n\nstated that he had some “legal questions that were not resolved” in his mind, including\n\nwhether any exceptions to the two-year statute of limitations applied.\n\n       Buecker gave the following testimony:\n\n       Q [Buecker’s counsel]: You have heard Dr. Roell imply that you had an\n       animus against Dr. Roell and that you had some spiritual connection from\n       Ms. Standifer, the decedent, and as a result of that you were going to\n       pursue Dr. Roell from the gates of hell. Is that what he has testified to ?\n\n       A [Buecker]: I heard that testimony.\n\n\n                                             16\n\fQ: And do you recall based upon his testimony today when Dr. Roell said\nthat you said that?\n\nA: He said I said that at the—when the Court sanctioned me as\nadministrator for $5,000.\n\nQ: And that was on February 16th of 2007?\n\nA: That is when that hearing was held.\n\nQ: And, in fact, did you tell Dr. Roell those words?\n\nA: I wasn’t here at that hearing.\n\nQ: Okay. So did you have any personal animus against Dr. Roell before\nfiling the original petition for medical negligence?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Or in any of the other pleadings that are alleged as being made subject\nto these sanctions ordered, including the April 14th, 2004 response to a\nmotion for summary judgment?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: For the April 14th, 2004 pleadings in which you allege fraud and breach\nof fiduciary duty?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Or the December 16, 2005 pleading joining Nancy McDonald as a\ndefendant in alleging additional claims regarding estate property?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Or the February 6th, 2007 pleading in which there was an amended\npetition in which you added a claim of conversion?\n\nA: No.\n\n....\n\nQ: And at the time that you filed your common law claims and that was after\non [sic] April 14th, 2004, December 16th, 2005, February 6th, 2007, when\nyou filed your claims or amendments to the claims[,] did you have a\nreasonable expectation of prevailing when you filed those petitions?\n\n                                    17\n\f      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: Why is that?\n\n      A: The evidence I had garnered.\n\n      Q: And then you dismissed the case; is that correct?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: Why is that?\n\n      A: I had obtained the return of the property through my lawsuit with Nancy\n      McDonald. I had established what I needed to establish on the record\n      regarding Dr. Roell’s involvement in this thing because he testified at a\n      deposition that he had retrieved the property right after her death with the\n      authority of Mr. Hardwick and had given it to storage. The fact of the matter\n      is Mr. Hardwick was not appointed as administrator until 21 months after he\n      had said he had retrieved the property with the authority of Mr. Hardwick.\n\n              I had established the elements that I had looked to establish. I didn’t\n      have to pursue it anymore when I got the property back. There is no money\n      in the estate to pay for trials and lawyers to do this thing. I got the property\n      back. I cut my losses, and I got what the object of the suit was to do. I got\n      it done.\n\n      Q: So you recovered the property of the estate that you were trying to get\n      recovered from Dr. Roell?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      We conclude that Roell failed to establish Buecker’s bad faith—the conscious doing\n\nof a wrong for dishonest, discriminatory, or malicious purposes.40 Similarly, we find no\n\nevidence of harassment—that the pleadings were intended to annoy, alarm, and abuse\n\nanother person.41 We conclude that Roell failed to overcome the presumption that\n\nBuecker’s claims, including the medical malpractice claim and the common-law claims,\n\n\n      40\n           See W alton, 233 S.W .3d at 540.\n\n      41\n           See id.\n\n                                              18\n\fwere filed in good faith by failing to present any evidence that the claims were groundless\n\nand filed in bad faith or to harass.42\n\n        We note that the May 23, 2007 order ordering Buecker to pay Roell $5,000 in\n\nattorney’s fees is included in the final order ordering sanctions in the amount of $30,\n\n841.00. At the February 13, 2008 hearing on the entry of judgment, the trial court\n\nadmitted, regarding the $5,000, that he did not “know what Judge Johnson used. I don’t\n\nknow how he arrived at it. I don’t know if it’s pure sanctions or just an amount of attorneys’\n\nfees.” We also note that at the February 16, 2007 hearing, when Buecker’s counsel\n\nobjected that “there is no credible evidence as to amount of attorney’s fees,” the trial court\n\nstated, “Now you pulled out your hammer and hit on a nail.” At the February 13 hearing,\n\nRoell testified that he did not recall what he had actually paid his counsel in attorneys’ fees.\n\nWe conclude that based on the record before us, there is insufficient evidence to support\n\nthe award of $5,000 in attorneys’ fees awarded in the May 23, 2007 sanctions order.\n\n        We sustain Buecker’s first and third sub-issues.43 Because we find these issues\n\ndispositive, we need not address Buecker’s additional issues. We reverse the trial court’s\n\nMay 23, 2007 and February 13, 2008 orders imposing sanctions, and render judgment that\n\nRoell take nothing.\n\n                                                                   ____________________\n                                                                   LINDA REYNA YAÑEZ,\n                                                                   Justice\n\nDelivered and filed the\n24th day of November, 2009.\n\n        42\n             See id. at 541.\n\n        43\n          By his first sub-issue, Buecker contends the trial court abused its discretion in awarding the May\n23, 2007 order of sanctions; by his third sub-issue, Buecker contends the trial court abused its discretion in\nawarding the February 13, 2008 order of sanctions for $30,841.00.\n\n                                                     19\n\f",

Roell\n\nrequested, and was granted, permission to search Standifer’s home for the will. On June\n\n27, 2000, Roell filed an application to probate Standifer’s will, which named him as her\n\npersonal representative. The will bequeathed: (1) Standifer’s real estate and personal\n\nproperty to Roell; (2) her jewelry (“except that given to [her] by [Roell]”) to Sandra\n\nGilkerson; (3) $10,000 to Mary Sanders; and (4) $10.00 each to her stepbrother, Michael\n\nGollmer, and her two stepsons.\n\n         On August 16, 2000, Buecker, as counsel for Gollmer, filed a plea in intervention\n\nchallenging Roell’s designation as executor.4 On May 3, 2001, Buecker filed (on Gollmer’s\n\nbehalf) an amended plea in intervention, stating that Roell should not be named as\n\nexecutor because he was being sued by the Texas Medical Board for causing Standifer’s\n\ndeath by over-prescribing drugs. On June 28, 2001, the court appointed William L.\n\nHardwick as temporary administrator of Standifer’s estate.\n\n\n\n        1\n           W e rely prim arily on appellant’s statem ent of facts. See T EX . R. A PP . P. 38.1(g) (providing that an\nappellate court will accept facts as stated in appellant’s brief as true unless contradicted by another party).\nHere, Roell has filed a four-page pro se “Reply” to appellant’s brief, which includes several paragraphs\nentitled, “Facts as I See Them .” However, Roell’s “facts” prim arily challenge Buecker’s objectivity and the\nvalidity of the findings of the Texas State Board of Medical Exam iners, which led to the Board’s revocation\nof Roell’s license to practice m edicine.\n\n        2\n             Roell’s license to practice m edicine was revoked on August 16, 2002.\n\n         3\n             Standifer was Roell’s patient from approxim ately 1993 until her death in March 2000.\n\n         4\n             The August 16, 2000 plea in intervention is not included in the record before us.\n\n                                                         2\n\f         On August 5, 2001, the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners filed its Second\n\nAmended Complaint against Roell, alleging multiple violations of the Medical Practice Act,5\n\nincluding allegations that Roell “violat[ed] the standard of care” by unsafely allowing\n\nStandifer to self-administer intravenous narcotics and that Standifer “died of a drug\n\noverdose.” Buecker asserts that on February 28, 2002, he sent a “notice-of-claim” for\n\nmedical malpractice letter to Roell, with copies to Roell’s counsel and Hardwick, the\n\ntemporary administrator.6\n\n         On August 16, 2002, the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners issued its final\n\norder, by which it revoked Roell’s license to practice medicine. The final order consists of\n\ntwenty-six pages of findings of fact and conclusions of law, which included findings that\n\nRoell treated Standifer “with strong, addictive pain medications without adequate medical\n\njustification” and that his “long-term treatment of [her] with injectable narcotics caused\n\ninjection site abscesses [sic].” Buecker received a copy of the Board’s order in late\n\nSeptember 2002. In late December 2002 , Hardwick resigned as temporary administrator\n\nof the estate.\n\n         In March 2003, Buecker (on Gollmer’s behalf) filed a handwriting analysis report,\n\nwhich concluded that Standifer’s purported signature on the will offered for probate by\n\nRoell was not genuine.7 The court appointed Mark Eggert as the second temporary\n\n\n         5\n             See T EX . O C C . C OD E A N N . §§ 155.001-167.202 (Vernon 2004 & Supp. 2009).\n\n         6\n           See T EX . C IV . P RAC . & R EM . C OD E A N N . § 74.051 (Vernon 2005). Buecker subm itted a copy of the\nletter as a “Supplem ent” to his “Appendix.” However, docum ents that appear solely in the appendix of a brief\nare not part of the record and are generally not considered on appeal. See Till v. Thomas, 10 S.W .3d 730,\n733-34 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 1999, no pet.). Thus, we do not consider the letter on appeal.\n\n\n         7\n          The handwriting analysis report, which is included in the record, is dated April 2, 2001.              No\nexplanation is provided as to why it was not presented to the court until alm ost two years later.\n\n                                                         3\n\fadministrator of the estate. On May 16, 2003, the court appointed Buecker as the third\n\ntemporary administrator, an appointment which became effective on July 17, 2003, upon\n\nthe posting of a $10,000.00 bond.\n\n        On August 28, 2003, Buecker, as administrator of Standifer’s estate, filed a medical\n\nnegligence claim against Roell. The petition asserted two “exceptions” to the statute of\n\nlimitations: (1) that Roell’s malpractice was not discovered within the statutory period; and\n\n(2) that Buecker became aware of Roell’s negligence pursuant to the State Board of\n\nMedical Examiners’ report, but that he lacked the capacity to file suit until he (Buecker) was\n\nappointed administrator of Standifer’s estate.\n\n        On February 9, 2004, Roell filed a traditional motion for summary judgment, arguing\n\nthat Buecker’s suit was time-barred by the two-year statute of limitations.8 In his motion,\n\nRoell argued that Buecker had actual knowledge of the alleged malpractice by May 3,\n\n2001, if not earlier—well within the statutory period. He also argued that Buecker had the\n\ncapacity “to insist that this malpractice lawsuit be brought within the statutory period.”\n\n        On April 14, 2004, Buecker filed a response to Roell’s motion. In the response,\n\nBuecker asserted that he was not a party entitled to sue under section 71.004 of the civil\n\npractice and remedies code9 and that he had no standing to sue until after his appointment\n\nas administrator in July 2003.10 Buecker’s response also asserted causes of action for\n\nfraud and breach of fiduciary duty, which carry a four-year statute of limitations.\n\n\n\n        8\n            See T EX . C IV . P RAC . & R EM . C OD E A N N . § 74.251 (Vernon 2005).\n\n        9\n          See id. § 71.004 (Vernon 2008) (providing for wrongful death action accruing to surviving spouse,\nchildren, and parents of a deceased for their own dam ages suffered as a result of the death of the decedent).\n\n        10\n          See id. § 71.021 (providing for a survival of cause of action, by which a decedent m ay have sought\nrecovery for personal injuries, pain and suffering, and other dam ages suffered prior to his or her death).\n\n                                                             4\n\f        On April 19, 2004, Roell filed a brief and reply to Buecker’s response, in which he\n\nargued that because Buecker failed to file an expert report as required by the medical\n\nliability statute, he was entitled to (1) dismissal of the health care liability claim against him,\n\nand (2) sanctions consisting of his attorneys’ fees and costs in an amount of $7,500.00.11\n\nOn June 18, 2004, the trial court granted Roell’s motion for summary judgment as to\n\nBuecker’s medical malpractice claim on the basis of limitations.\n\n        On August 13, 2004, Roell filed a motion for attorneys’ fees and costs, again arguing\n\nhe was entitled to such fees and costs under the medical liability statute. The motion\n\nrequested $18,500 in attorneys’ fees and $508.15 in expenses and interest. Attached to\n\nthe motion were thirteen pages detailing over 123 hours in legal services rendered to Roell.\n\n        On December 16, 2005, Buecker filed a second amended petition, in which he\n\nadded Nancy McDonald as a defendant, and asserted a claim for conspiracy to commit\n\nfraud.12 On February 8, 2007, Buecker (1) filed a third amended petition, adding a claim\n\nfor conversion,13 and (2) non-suited the claims against McDonald.14 On February 12, 2007,\n\nBuecker filed a motion for non-suit of Roell, without prejudice.15\n\n        On February 16, 2007, the trial court held a hearing on Roell’s pending motion for\n\n\n\n        11\n             See id. § 74.351(b) (Vernon Supp. 2009).\n\n        12\n           On April 21, 2003, Nancy McDonald, a nurse form erly em ployed by Roell, subm itted a letter to Mark\nEggert, then adm inistrator of Standifer’s estate, requesting paym ent in the am ount of $32,611.50 in storage\nfees for the storage of two boats and an autom obile that belonged to the estate. Buecker contends that\nalthough he had no authority to do so, Roell ordered the boats and vehicle stored on property that he owned,\nthen claim ed to have paid “storage fees,” and conspired with McDonald to obtain reim bursem ent from the\nestate for paym ent of such fees.\n\n        13\n             Buecker alleged that the defendants converted the two boats and vehicle for their own use.\n\n        14\n             The court granted the estate’s non-suit of claim s against McDonald on February 16, 2007.\n\n        15\n             The court granted the m otion for non-suit as to Roell on February 12, 2007.\n\n                                                        5\n\fattorneys’ fees, even though Roell had been non-suited.16 On the same day as the\n\nhearing, Roell filed a motion for sanctions, contending that Buecker’s pleadings, motions,\n\nand other documents were filed in violation of rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure\n\nand chapter 10 of the civil practice and remedies code.17 At the February 16 hearing,\n\nRoell’s counsel presented a statement of attorneys’ fees incurred by Roell’s prior counsel.18\n\nRoell testified that he had not paid the full amount reflected on the statement, and did not\n\nrecall what amount he had paid. Buecker’s attorney noted that in 2001, prior to filing suit\n\nin 2003, Buecker had filed a copy of the State Board of Medical Examiners’ Second\n\nAmended Complaint and its Final Order with the probate court. Roell’s counsel argued that\n\nhe was entitled to $18,500 in attorneys’ fees plus expenses because of Buecker’s failure\n\nto file an expert report under the medical liability statute. Buecker’s counsel argued that\n\n(1) the statute was not applicable because Roell was not a physician at the time he was\n\nsued, and (2) that the Board of Medical Examiners’ final report satisfied the requirement\n\nfor an expert report. After advising the parties that he “[couldn’t] tell which case was\n\nhandled more miserably, the case on behalf of the petitioner or the case on behalf of the\n\ndefendant,” the trial court awarded $5,000 in attorneys’ fees plus filing fees to Roell solely\n\non the issue of Buecker’s failure to produce an expert report in compliance with the\n\nmedical malpractice statute.19\n\n\n        16\n           In his August 13, 2004 m otion for attorneys’ fees, Roell’s prior counsel requested $18,500 in\nattorneys’ fees and $508.15 in expenses.\n\n        17\n             See T EX . C IV . P RAC . & R EM . C OD E A N N . § 10.001-.004 (Vernon 2002); T EX . R. C IV . P. 13.\n\n        18\n           At the tim e of the hearing, Roell’s prior counsel, R. W . R odriguez, was in jail. The tim e sheet\nreflected fees up to around the tim e sum m ary judgm ent was granted in 2004.\n\n        19\n             The trial court’s order ordering Buecker to pay Roell $5,000 in attorneys’ fees is dated May 23,\n2007.\n\n                                                              6\n\f       On May 23, 2007, Roell filed a “Motion for New Trial on Sanctions,” in which he\n\nargued that the trial court erred in refusing to consider his earlier-filed motions for\n\nsanctions. On July 27, 2007, the trial court granted a new trial on the issue of sanctions.\n\nOn August 23, 2007, Buecker filed a notice of appeal, prior to the new trial hearing on\n\nRoell’s motion for sanctions.\n\n       On October 27, 2007, the trial court held a hearing on Roell’s February 16, 2007\n\nmotion for sanctions.20 At the hearing, the following persons testified: Buecker, Roell,\n\nR.W. Rodriguez (Roell’s prior counsel), and Charles R. Manning (Roell’s then-present\n\ncounsel).\n\n       Rodriguez testified that he represented Roell in the medical malpractice suit filed by\n\nBuecker. Rodriguez testified that after researching the issue, he told Buecker in December\n\n2003 that the medical malpractice statute had a strict two-year statute of limitations, with\n\nno exception for the discovery rule. In Rodriguez’s opinion, Buecker added the common-\n\nlaw claims because he knew the trial court likely would grant summary judgment in Roell’s\n\nfavor on the medical malpractice claims on the issue of limitations. Rodriguez did not\n\ninvestigate the fraud and breach of fiduciary duty claims against Roell because the\n\n“easiest” way to defend against those claims was to rely on Buecker’s failure to respond\n\nto discovery requests, including requests for admissions. Rodriguez did not investigate\n\nBuecker’s conversion claim or Roell’s relationship with McDonald because he was relying\n\non the deemed admissions. For the same reason, he did not investigate the claim that\n\nthere was a lien against the estate for $32,611. Rodriguez testified that his attorneys’ fees\n\n\n       20\n          W e note that the Honorable Joel B. Johnson presided over the February 16, 2007 hearing.\nHowever, the Honorable Ronald M. Yeager, Senior Retired Judge, presided over the O ctober 27, 2007\nhearing.\n\n                                                7\n\fthrough June 2004 totaled about $18,500, and that approximately sixty to seventy percent\n\nof that amount could have been avoided had Buecker accepted that his suit was barred\n\nby limitations.21\n\n        On cross-examination, Rodriguez admitted that he did not segregate his fees\n\nbetween the medical malpractice claims and the common-law claims. Rodriguez testified\n\nthat he did not pay too much attention to the report that Standifer’s signature on the will\n\nwas not genuine “because again of the admissions.”\n\n        Roell testified that Standifer had not told him that she had a will or who her executor\n\nwas. Roell did not know where the will was prepared; he knew that the two witnesses to\n\nthe will were his patients, but he had not talked to them about it. Roell testified that he was\n\nfriends with Standifer and her deceased husband. According to Roell, after Standifer died,\n\nher bank called and notified him that he was authorized to write checks on her bank\n\naccount. The bank sent him a check for around $800.00, which was the balance in the\n\naccount. Roell testified that because the estate’s two boats and vehicle were becoming\n\novergrown with weeds and were being “vandalized,” he made arrangements to have those\n\nitems stored by Robert Buerger. Roell testified that he did not recall any specifics about\n\nthe storage arrangements. Roell also did not recall whether he had ever requested\n\nreimbursement for the $32,611.50 in storage fees. Roell testified that on the day of the\n\nFebruary 16, 2007 hearing, Buecker told him that he would “follow [Roell] through the gates\n\nof hell” to seek justice for Standifer.\n\n        On cross-examination, Roell was shown the motion he submitted to search\n\n\n        21\n          Rodriguez was later recalled as a witness and testified that he did not know what his fees were from\nJuly 2004 through Decem ber 2004. He testified that from January 2005 through August 2006, his fees were\napproxim ately $15,560.00.\n\n                                                      8\n\fStandifer’s house for her will. Roell testified that did not recall the document. Roell\n\nconceded that Standifer’s will awarded him all of her real estate, but stated that “[Standifer]\n\ngave it to me to dispose of.” Roell also admitted that the will awards Standifer’s jewelry to\n\nSandra Gilkerson, except for the jewelry that he had given to Standifer. Roell did not recall\n\nanything about the patients who had witnessed the will. Roell also did not recall anything\n\nabout how he was supposed to dispose of Standifer’s property. According to Roell, he\n\ncouldn’t “recall hardly anything about [the will].”\n\n       Manning testified that at his hourly rate of $120.00, his attorneys’ fees for working\n\non the sanctions issue amounted to $1,150.00, plus his time spent at the hearing, for a\n\ntotal of around $1,500.00.\n\n       Buecker testified that when he filed the medical malpractice action, he believed that\n\nthere may be two applicable exceptions to the statute of limitations: (1) the one-year delay\n\nin filing suit if an executor administrator is appointed and (2) the date-of-discovery\n\nexception. Buecker said he learned of the revocation of Roell’s license (and the Board’s\n\nfindings regarding Roell’s treatment of Standifer) in August 2002. Buecker testified that\n\nthe filing of the medical malpractice claim against Roell was based on the Board’s findings.\n\nBuecker testified that before he was appointed administrator, he tried to get the existing\n\nadministrator of the estate to file the medical negligence action. As soon as Buecker was\n\nnamed administrator, he filed the medical negligence action against Roell. With regard to\n\nthe basis for the common-law claims, Buecker testified that he knew (1) on the same day\n\nthat $52,000 was deposited into Standifer’s bank account, Roell became the beneficiary\n\nof the account and a joint signatory on the account; and (2) the same day that $52,000 was\n\ndeposited, there was a $5,000 cash withdrawal on the account. Buecker testified that after\n\n\n                                               9\n\fhe became administrator, he received a bill, submitted by Nancy McDonald, for payment\n\nof $32,611.50 in “storage fees” for storing the two boats and automobile belonging to the\n\nestate.22 According to Buecker, Roell denied owning the property where the speed boat\n\nbelonging to the estate was stored, but Buecker later learned that Roell did own the\n\nproperty. Buecker testified that the fraud claim was based in part on the request to the\n\nestate for reimbursement of the “storage fees.” The breach of fiduciary duty claim was\n\nbased on Roell’s doctor/patient relationship with Standifer and the fact that Roell obtained\n\nan interest in her bank account upon her death. The claims against Nancy McDonald were\n\nbased on the request for reimbursement of the storage fees. The claims for conversion\n\nwere based on Roell’s taking the two boats and automobile without authorization.\n\n        Buecker testified that he interviewed the witnesses to Standifer’s will. One of the\n\nwitnesses, interviewed at 10:00 in the morning, told Buecker the will was signed at the\n\nclinic; the witness kept asking Buecker for beer. Buecker located the other witness, but\n\nwas unable to talk to him because he was “shaking” and “looked like he was having a\n\nseizure withdrawal or something.” Buecker testified that after he submitted the expert\n\nreport stating that Standifer’s signature on the will was non-genuine, Roell withdrew his\n\napplication to probate the will. Buecker also testified that he learned from the Beeville\n\nPolice Department that Roell was known in the community as “Dr. Feel Good.” Buecker\n\ntestified that he non-suited the claims after he “got the [estate’s] property back.”\n\n        At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court gave the parties an opportunity to\n\nsubmit any additional arguments. On February 13, 2008, the trial judge that presided over\n\n\n\n        22\n             The storage receipts reflect that the estate’s two boats and autom obile were stored within about\nthirty-five days after Standifer’s death.\n\n                                                     10\n\fthe October 27, 2007 hearing held a hearing on the proposed judgment. At the hearing,\n\nthe trial court explained how it arrived at its order that Buecker should pay Roell $30,\n\n841.00 as sanctions for expenses and attorneys’ fees, plus post-judgment interest. The\n\ntrial court explained that (1) it included the $5,000 awarded on February 16, 2007 in the\n\n$30,841.00; and (2) it awarded 60% of $18, 500.00, which is $11,100.00, plus $15,560.00,\n\nplus $4,181.00, for a total of $30,841.00.\n\n        On March 11, 2008, the trial court signed findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\nGenerally, the findings and conclusions included the following: (1) Buecker failed to\n\nestablish why his medical malpractice claim could not have been filed within the two-year\n\nstatute of limitations; (2) Buecker’s common-law claims were filed outside the applicable\n\nstatutes of limitations; (3) Buecker’s original and amended petitions violated rule 13 and\n\nsection 10 of the civil practice and remedies code, in that the claims were brought in bad\n\nfaith and to harass Roell; and (4) the award of $30,841.00 is no more than necessary to\n\nsatisfy the purpose of rule 215.2 of the rules of civil procedure.\n\n                              Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n        A trial court's imposition of sanctions is reviewed for abuse of discretion.23 An\n\nassessment of sanctions will be reversed only if the trial court acted without reference to\n\nany guiding rules and principles, such that its ruling was arbitrary or unreasonable. 24 The\n\ntrial court does not abuse its discretion if it bases its decision on conflicting evidence and\n\nsome evidence supports its decision.25 However, a trial court abuses its discretion when\n\n        23\n           Unifund CCR Partners v.

As the party moving for sanctions, Roell was required to prove\n\nBuecker’s subjective state of mind.39 Here, there was no evidence that Buecker had any\n\nimproper purpose of harassment or improper motive. At the October 27, 2007, hearing,\n\nBuecker’s counsel questioned Roell’s former counsel, Rodriguez:\n\n        Q [Buecker’s counsel]: Did Mr. Buecker indicate to you that he was\n        personally upset with Dr. Roell or that he was bringing this for any purpose\n        other than for a legal determination of the applicable limitations?\n\n        A [Rodriguez]: Not at that juncture, no.\n\n\n\n        39\n           See R.

Now, Dr. Roell, have you seen any other\n       indications—or let me ask you what other indications you have seen that\n       leaves you to think that this action has been maintained and kept going for\n       so many years to harass you?\n\n       A [Roell]: I don’t think—my own personal opinion he did not act in good faith.\n       At the results of the mediation he wanted $10,000 legal fees—\n\n       ....\n\n       Q: Beyond that you really can’t go into it, but what other evidence do you\n       have or you think supports your view that he was harassing you?\n\n       A: Just continuation of paper after paper[,] allegation after allegation[,] some\n       of his remarks in court[,] calling me Dr. Feel Good and some of the other\n       things that he got out of the pleadings of the Texas State Board of Medical\n       Examiners; [he] just really berated me.\n\n       Buecker testified that when he filed the petition for medical negligence, he relied on\n\nthe facts in the report of the State Board of Medical Examiners, which found that Roell had\n\nviolated the standard of care with regard to several patients, including Standifer. Buecker\n\nstated that he had some “legal questions that were not resolved” in his mind, including\n\nwhether any exceptions to the two-year statute of limitations applied.\n\n       Buecker gave the following testimony:\n\n       Q [Buecker’s counsel]: You have heard Dr. Roell imply that you had an\n       animus against Dr. Roell and that you had some spiritual connection from\n       Ms. Standifer, the decedent, and as a result of that you were going to\n       pursue Dr. Roell from the gates of hell. Is that what he has testified to ?\n\n       A [Buecker]: I heard that testimony.\n\n\n                                             16\n\fQ: And do you recall based upon his testimony today when Dr. Roell said\nthat you said that?\n\nA: He said I said that at the—when the Court sanctioned me as\nadministrator for $5,000.\n\nQ: And that was on February 16th of 2007?\n\nA: That is when that hearing was held.\n\nQ: And, in fact, did you tell Dr. Roell those words?\n\nA: I wasn’t here at that hearing.\n\nQ: Okay. So did you have any personal animus against Dr. Roell before\nfiling the original petition for medical negligence?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Or in any of the other pleadings that are alleged as being made subject\nto these sanctions ordered, including the April 14th, 2004 response to a\nmotion for summary judgment?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: For the April 14th, 2004 pleadings in which you allege fraud and breach\nof fiduciary duty?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Or the December 16, 2005 pleading joining Nancy McDonald as a\ndefendant in alleging additional claims regarding estate property?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Or the February 6th, 2007 pleading in which there was an amended\npetition in which you added a claim of conversion?\n\nA: No.\n\n....\n\nQ: And at the time that you filed your common law claims and that was after\non [sic] April 14th, 2004, December 16th, 2005, February 6th, 2007, when\nyou filed your claims or amendments to the claims[,] did you have a\nreasonable expectation of prevailing when you filed those petitions?\n\n                                    17\n\f      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: Why is that?\n\n      A: The evidence I had garnered.\n\n      Q: And then you dismissed the case; is that correct?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: Why is that?\n\n      A: I had obtained the return of the property through my lawsuit with Nancy\n      McDonald. I had established what I needed to establish on the record\n      regarding Dr. Roell’s involvement in this thing because he testified at a\n      deposition that he had retrieved the property right after her death with the\n      authority of Mr. Hardwick and had given it to storage. The fact of the matter\n      is Mr. Hardwick was not appointed as administrator until 21 months after he\n      had said he had retrieved the property with the authority of Mr. Hardwick.\n\n              I had established the elements that I had looked to establish. I didn’t\n      have to pursue it anymore when I got the property back. There is no money\n      in the estate to pay for trials and lawyers to do this thing. I got the property\n      back. I cut my losses, and I got what the object of the suit was to do. I got\n      it done.\n\n      Q: So you recovered the property of the estate that you were trying to get\n      recovered from Dr. Roell?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      We conclude that Roell failed to establish Buecker’s bad faith—the conscious doing\n\nof a wrong for dishonest, discriminatory, or malicious purposes.40 Similarly, we find no\n\nevidence of harassment—that the pleadings were intended to annoy, alarm, and abuse\n\nanother person.41 We conclude that Roell failed to overcome the presumption that\n\nBuecker’s claims, including the medical malpractice claim and the common-law claims,\n\n\n      40\n           See W alton, 233 S.W .3d at 540.\n\n      41\n           See id.\n\n                                              18\n\fwere filed in good faith by failing to present any evidence that the claims were groundless\n\nand filed in bad faith or to harass.42\n\n        We note that the May 23, 2007 order ordering Buecker to pay Roell $5,000 in\n\nattorney’s fees is included in the final order ordering sanctions in the amount of $30,\n\n841.00. At the February 13, 2008 hearing on the entry of judgment, the trial court\n\nadmitted, regarding the $5,000, that he did not “know what Judge Johnson used. I don’t\n\nknow how he arrived at it. I don’t know if it’s pure sanctions or just an amount of attorneys’\n\nfees.” We also note that at the February 16, 2007 hearing, when Buecker’s counsel\n\nobjected that “there is no credible evidence as to amount of attorney’s fees,” the trial court\n\nstated, “Now you pulled out your hammer and hit on a nail.” At the February 13 hearing,\n\nRoell testified that he did not recall what he had actually paid his counsel in attorneys’ fees.\n\nWe conclude that based on the record before us, there is insufficient evidence to support\n\nthe award of $5,000 in attorneys’ fees awarded in the May 23, 2007 sanctions order.\n\n        We sustain Buecker’s first and third sub-issues.43 Because we find these issues\n\ndispositive, we need not address Buecker’s additional issues. We reverse the trial court’s\n\nMay 23, 2007 and February 13, 2008 orders imposing sanctions, and render judgment that\n\nRoell take nothing.\n\n                                                                   ____________________\n                                                                   LINDA REYNA YAÑEZ,\n                                                                   Justice\n\nDelivered and filed the\n24th day of November, 2009.\n\n        42\n             See id. at 541.\n\n        43\n          By his first sub-issue, Buecker contends the trial court abused its discretion in awarding the May\n23, 2007 order of sanctions; by his third sub-issue, Buecker contends the trial court abused its discretion in\nawarding the February 13, 2008 order of sanctions for $30,841.00.\n\n                                                     19\n\f</pre>",
