He was denied entry. The Kamehameha Schools were created through a charitable testamentary trust, established by the last direct descendant of the Hawaiian monarchy, for the education and upbringing of Native Hawaiians. As a result, the Kamehameha Schools' admissions policy gives preference to students of Hawaiian ancestry.

The Native Hawaiians developed a well-organized, efficient, and thriving civilization \"based on a communal land tenure system with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion.\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 7512. The land, abundant in natural resources, allowed the Native Hawaiians to thrive.

The immediate result of that first encounter was that Native Hawaiians were introduced to Western goods and Western diseases. \"By 1919, the Native Hawaiian population had declined from an estimated 1,000,000 in 1778 to an alarming 22,600.\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 7512(7). <i>But see Rice v.

The United States officially recognized the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1826 and, from 1843 until 1893, extended full diplomatic recognition to the islands. Other countries, too&#8212;including Great Britain, France, and Japan&#8212;recognized the Hawaiian Kingdom. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 7512(1). Before 1893, the United States entered into a number of treaties for peace, friendship, and commerce with the Kingdom. U.S. Dep't of Justice &amp; U.S. Dep't of the Interior, <i>From Mauka to Makai: The River of Justice Must Flow Freely</i> 1 (Oct. 23, 2000) (hereinafter \"<i>From Mauka to Makai</i>\"). The first treaty was signed in 1826, and additional treaties were signed in 1849, 1875, and 1887. <i>See Rice,</i> 528 U.S. at 504, 120 S.Ct. 1044 (discussing the history of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii before the overthrow of the monarchy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Kingdom of Hawaii, located along shipping and fishing routes, was commercially desirable. Initially, trade with the Kingdom of Hawaii revolved around the islands' fur and sandalwood resources, as well as the whaling industry. <i>Rights Handbook</i> at 5. When over-harvesting destroyed the sandal-wood trade and depleted the whaling stocks, wealthy Westerners turned to large-scale plantations, primarily growing sugar, to make money. <i>Id.</i> As foreign investment became more and more tied to land ownership, demand for change in the traditional land tenure system, which did not provide for individual land titles, intensified. <i>Id.</i> at 6. Pressure from Westerners eventually led the Hawaiian government to reject the land tenure system in favor of privatized land ownership, which allowed Westerners \"[w]ith a permanent population of fewer than two thousand\" to take \"over most of Hawaii's land in the next half-century and manipulate[] the economy for their own profit.\" Neil M. Levy, <i>Native Hawaiian Land Rights,</i> 63 Cal. L.Rev. 848, 857-58 (1975) (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Western economic domination of the Hawaiian Islands was followed by an interest in establishing political control. <i>Id.</i> at 861. \"In 1893, the sovereign, independent, internationally recognized, and indigenous government of Hawaii, the Kingdom of Hawaii, was overthrown by a small group of non-Hawaiians, including United States citizens, who were assisted in their efforts by the United States Minister, a United States naval representative, and armed naval forces of the United States.\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 7512(5). The United States annexed Hawaii not long thereafter. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 7512(6). Laws were then enacted suppressing the Hawaiian culture and language and allowing for the displacement of Native Hawaiians from their lands. From 1896 to 1986, almost a full century, the Hawaiian language was banned as a medium of instruction in schools. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 7512(19). Hula, a Native Hawaiian dance form, and local healing practices also had been banned during the westernization of the islands. Such measures resulted in \"mortality, disease, economic deprivation, social distress and population decline.\" <i>From Mauka to Makai</i> at 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hawaii finally attained statehood in 1959. <i>Rights Handbook</i> at 18. More than 30 years later, in recognition of the United States' role in the overthrow of the independent Hawaiian monarchy, Congress officially apologized to the Hawaiian people and expressed its commitment to \"provide a proper foundation for reconciliation between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people.\" 1993 Apology Resolution, Pub.L. No. 103-150, 107 Stat. 1510, 1513 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Kamehameha Schools</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Kamehameha Schools were created under a \"charitable testamentary trust established by the last direct descendent of King Kamehameha I, Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, who left her property in trust for a school dedicated to the education and upbringing of Native Hawaiians.\" <i>Burgert v. Lokelani Bernice Pauahi Bishop Trust,</i> 200 F.3d 661, 663 (9th Cir.2000). Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop's will provided for the erection and maintenance of schools in the Hawaiian Islands, called the Kamehameha Schools, on the Hawaiian monarchy's ancestral lands, with the purpose of providing \"a good education in the common English branches, and also instruction in morals and in such useful knowledge as may tend to make good and industrious men and women.\" Will of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, <i>reprinted in Wills and Deeds of Trust</i> 17-18 (3d ed.1957) (hereinafter \"Pauahi Bishop Will\"). The Pauahi Bishop Will also bestowed on the \"trustees full power to make all such rules and regulations as they may deem necessary for the government of said schools and to regulate the admission of pupils.\" <i>Id.</i> at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the direction of the original trustees, chaired by Pauahi Bishop's widower, Charles Reed Bishop, the Kamehameha Schools opened in the late nineteenth century.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> During a speech on the Schools' first Founder's Day, in December 1888, Charles Reed Bishop stated that Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop had created the Kamehameha Schools, \"in which Hawaiians have the preference,\" so that \"her own people\" could once again thrive. Charles R. Bishop, <i>The Purpose of the Schools,</i> Handicraft, Jan. 1889, at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1910, not long after the death of Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop and the creation of the Kamehameha Schools, the question arose as to who should be admitted to the Schools. Cobey Black &amp; Kathleen Mellen, <i>Princess Pauahi Bishop and Her Legacy</i> 155 (The Kamehameha Schools Press 1965). Charles Bishop wrote to the trustees: \"Mrs. Bishop intended that, in the advantages of her beneficence, those of her race should have preference.\" <i>Id.</i> Accordingly, he concluded that the principal of the Schools was justified in refusing to admit a student who had no native Hawaiian ancestry. <i>Id.</i> Bishop went on to convey that only if Native Hawaiians failed to apply to the Schools, or if conditions changed fundamentally, should admissions be opened to other ethnicities: \"It was wise to prepare for and to admit natives only and I do not think the time has come to depart from that rule.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Today, the Kamehameha Schools operate three K-12 campuses: Kapalama on the island of Oahu, Pukalani on the island of Maui, and Keaau on the island of Hawaii. There are about 70,000 school-aged children in Hawaii who meet the Schools' definition of Native Hawaiian, but the Schools' total enrollment is only about 4,856 students. The Kamehameha Schools subsidize much of the tuition cost for all students, requiring payment of only $1,784 per year, whereas the cost of educating a student amounts to about $20,000 annually. Sixty-five percent of those enrolled receive some form of financial aid to help them pay even that heavily subsidized, modest tuition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Part of the Kamehameha Schools' stated admissions policy is to give preference to students of Native Hawaiian ancestry, defined to include any person descended from the aboriginal people who exercised sovereignty in the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778. Practically, the policy operates to admit students without any Hawaiian ancestry only after all qualified applicants with such ancestry have been admitted. Because there are many more qualified students of Hawaiian ancestry than there are available places at the Schools, it is very rare that a student with no Hawaiian ancestry is admitted to the campus programs. But the admissions policy is not an absolute bar to non-Native Hawaiians; instead, it is intended to last only for so long as Native Hawaiians suffer educational disadvantages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We pause to note that the Schools' policy contains no requirement for a minimum blood quantum of Hawaiian ancestry. The only requirement is that a student have at least one Native Hawaiian ancestor. Most students have mixed ancestry. More than 60 different racial and ethnic groups have been represented in the student body, and for the 2000-2001 academic year, students reported belonging to 39 different racial and ethnic groups. Accordingly, an observer visiting the Schools would see visible diversity notwithstanding the students' commonality of having at least one Native Hawaiian ancestor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Kamehameha Schools follow a \"Leadership Model\" of education. This curriculum is meant to foster the self-esteem and self-identity of students as individuals of Native Hawaiian descent by teaching Native Hawaiian culture, heritage, language, and tradition, in addition to general college-preparatory courses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kamehameha Schools also operate a number of other educational programs, including pre-schools, enrichment programs, and summer school programs. In those programs, the admission of non-Native Hawaiians occurs more often. For example, for the 2001-2002 school year, 13 children with no Native Hawaiian ancestry were admitted to Kamehameha's pre-school program (two of the children declined admission); the following school year 12 non-Native Hawaiian children were admitted to the pre-school; and the year after that&#8212;the 2003-2004 school year&#8212;16 students without Native Hawaiian ancestry were admitted. And, in the summer of 2003, for instance, non-Native Hawaiians were enrolled in several of the enrichment programs run by the Kamehameha Schools: 6 of 133 students in the Performing Arts Academy; 33 of 1,741 students in Explorations; 5 of 18 students in Culinary Arts; and 4 of 164 students in Hoolauna Keauhou.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Current Conditions in the Educational Status of Native Hawaiians</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Kamehameha Schools are partly responsible for the Native Hawaiian community's ability to maintain \"its distinct character as an aboriginal, native people,\" Native Hawaiians, nonetheless, continue to face \"economic deprivation, low educational attainment, poor health status, substandard housing and social dislocation.\" <i>From Mauka to Makai</i> at 2.

The report, entitled the \"Native Hawaiian Educational Assessment Project,\" was released in 1983 and documented that Native Hawaiians scored below parity with regard to national norms on standardized achievement tests, were disproportionately represented in many negative social and physical statistics indicative of special educational needs, and had educational needs that were related to their unique cultural situation, such as different learning styles and low self-image.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">20 U.S.C. &#167; 7512(14).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That trend continues today.

Accordingly, &#167; 1981 has \"roots\" in both the Thirteenth and the Fourteenth Amendments. <i>Gen. Bldg. Contractors,</i> 458 U.S. at 390 n. 17, 102 S.Ct. 3141. But the \"events and passions of the time in which the law was forged\" make clear that the purpose of &#167; 1981 was to destroy the societal influences that were intended to keep former slaves from achieving parity with former masters. <i>Id.</i> at 386, 102 S.Ct. 3141 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1981 largely lay dormant for nearly a century when, in 1976, the Supreme Court reinvigorated the statute in <i>Runyon.</i> In <i>Runyon,</i> the Supreme Court faced the question whether &#167; 1981 prevents \"private, commercially operated, nonsectarian schools from denying admission to prospective students because they are Negroes,\" 427 U.S. at 168, 96 S.Ct. 2586, and held that it does, <i>id.</i> at 172-73, 96 S.Ct. 2586.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The parents of African-American children had sought to enter into contractual relationships with the schools. \"Under those contractual relationships, the schools would have received payments for services rendered, and the prospective students would have received instruction in return for those payments.\" <i>Id.</i> at 172, 96 S.Ct. 2586. The schools' refusal to admit them therefore \"amount[ed] to a classic violation of &#167; 1981.\" <i>Id.</i> The Court noted that Congress had the right to reach private acts of discrimination in the private school setting because of its power under the Thirteenth Amendment to enact legislation to combat racial discrimination. <i>Id.</i> at 170-71. <i>Runyon,</i> then, involved a straightforward case of discrimination, not a remedial policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day as it issued <i>Runyon,</i> the Court decided that &#167; 1981, notwithstanding its text, prohibits discrimination against white people, as well as against non-whites. <i>McDonald v.

But in considering the reach of &#167; 1981, the Supreme Court has looked, in different ways, to both the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VII for guidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Application of Title VII Standards to &#167; 1981 Claims</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>General Building Contractors,</i> the Court limited &#167; 1981 to cover only acts involving intentional discrimination, excluding from the statute's reach actions that merely have a disparate effect. 458 U.S. at 391, 102 S.Ct. 3141. In so doing, the Court relied on the fact that &#167; 1981 traces its history, in part, to the Fourteenth Amendment and, accordingly, to the Equal Protection Clause. <i>Id.</i> at 390-91, 102 S.Ct. 3141. Even though the Supreme Court imported the purposeful discrimination element of its equal protection jurisprudence to &#167; 1981, later Supreme Court precedent regarding &#167; 1981 and Title VII suggests that the \"strict scrutiny\" standard of equal protection does not apply to a wholly private school's race-based remedial admissions plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Patterson v.

Martin,</i> 985 F.2d 470, 475 n. 2 (9th Cir.1993), the Supreme Court signaled its intention to apply the Title VII analysis to &#167; 1981 claims brought against a private employer. In <i>Patterson,</i> the plaintiff brought a &#167; 1981 suit against her former employer, alleging that the employer had harassed her, failed to promote her, and fired her on account of her race. 491 U.S. at 169, 109 S.Ct. 2363. The Court analyzed the ways in which &#167; 1981 and Title VII overlap, as well as the statutes' differences, and concluded that the Title VII burden-shifting system of proof established in <i>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</i> 450 U.S. 248, 252-53, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981), and <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

That is, the plaintiff first must establish a prima facie case of discrimination by coming forward with evidence that an employer considered race in its employment decisions. <i>Id.; Johnson v. Transp. Agency,</i> 480 U.S. 616, 626, 107 S.Ct. 1442, 94 L.Ed.2d 615 (1987). After a prima facie case is established, the burden shifts to the employer to provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the decision. <i>Patterson,</i> 491 U.S. at 187, 109 S.Ct. 2363. \"The existence of an affirmative action plan provides such a rationale.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 480 U.S. at 626, 107 S.Ct. 1442.

The leading case, on which all the others rely, is <i>Setser v. Novack Investment Co.,</i> 657 F.2d 962 (8th Cir.1981) (en banc). In <i>Setser,</i> the plaintiff, a white man, sued Novack under &#167; 1981 claiming that he had been refused employment on account of his race because of an affirmative action plan. <i>Setser v.

The <i>Setser</i> court addressed two issues that are relevant here: \"(1) whether section 1981 prohibits all race-conscious affirmative action; [and] (2) whether the standards for reviewing affirmative action under [T]itle VII govern the review of such plans under section 1981.\" 657 F.2d at 965.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eighth Circuit first concluded that &#167; 1981 does not bar affirmative action programs, even in light of <i>McDonald,</i> 427 U.S. at 296, 96 S.Ct. 2574, which held that &#167; 1981 affords protection to white people. In so holding, the <i>Setser</i> court looked to the Supreme Court's decision in <i>United Steelworkers of Am. v. Weber,</i> 443 U.S. 193, 99 S.Ct. 2721, 61 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979), which held that Title VII does not bar all preferential treatment on the basis of race, and applied the same rationale to &#167; 1981:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would indeed be . . . ironic if the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was used now to prohibit the only effective remedy for past discriminatory employment practices against blacks and other minorities, when the Act was virtually useless to prevent the occurrence of such discrimination for more than a century.... <i>We conclude that the Supreme Court, by approving race-conscious affirmative action by employers in Weber,</i> implicitly approved the use of race-conscious plans to remedy past discrimination under section 1981. To open the door for such plans under [T]itle VII and close it under section 1981 would make little sense. The prohibition under section 1981 of affirmative action plans permissible under [T]itle VII would bar a remedy Congress left within the discretion of private employers when it passed [T]itle VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Setser,</i> 657 F.2d at 966-67 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that affirmative action plans were permissible, the <i>Setser</i> court expressly \"equat[ed] the affirmative action standards of [T]itle VII with those of section 1981.\" <i>Id.</i> at 967.

This principle of consistency was especially important to the <i>Setser</i> court because it found untenable the prospect that an employer could be ordered, under Title VII, to implement an affirmative action plan, but simultaneously barred from implementing that same plan under &#167; 1981, if the two statutes were interpreted differently. <i>Id.</i> at 967-68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Third Circuit in a recent decision, as well as other courts, have followed <i>Setser</i> in using Title VII standards to evaluate private affirmative action plans challenged under &#167; 1981. <i>See, e.g., Schurr v.

In those cases, the Supreme Court strictly scrutinized the admissions policies of a <i>public university,</i> the University of Michigan Law School and its undergraduate counterpart. <i>See Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 326, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (law school); <i>Gratz,</i> 539 U.S. at 270, 123 S.Ct. 2411 (undergraduate institution). Plaintiff places great stock in the fact that in both cases, the Supreme Court mentioned &#167; 1981 in conjunction with the plaintiff's Equal Protection Clause claim. <i>See Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 343, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (noting that, because the law school's admissions policy satisfied strict scrutiny review under the Equal Protection Clause, it also satisfied &#167; 1981); <i>Gratz,</i> 539 U.S. at 275-76 &amp; n. 23, 123 S.Ct. 2411 (noting that, because the university's undergraduate admissions program failed strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, it also violated &#167; 1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support both of its holdings, the Court cited <i>General Building Contractors</i> for the proposition that discrimination that violates the Equal Protection Clause also violates &#167; 1981. <i>See Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 343, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (noting that \"the prohibition against discrimination in &#167; 1981 is co-extensive with the Equal Protection Clause\"); <i>Gratz,</i> 539 U.S. at 276 n. 23, 123 S.Ct. 2411 (\"[P]urposeful discrimination that violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment will also violate &#167; 1981.\"). As explained earlier, in <i>General Building Contractors,</i> the Court held that &#167; 1981, like the Equal Protection Clause, prohibits only purposeful discrimination and therefore does not permit claims of disparate impact. 458 U.S. at 389, 102 S.Ct. 3141. Read in context, we believe that the Supreme Court's citation to <i>General Building Contractors</i> in the University of Michigan cases was meant to signal only the fact that both &#167; 1981 and the Fourteenth Amendment require intentional discrimination. Whether strict scrutiny applies to &#167; 1981 claims was not at issue. In <i>Grutter</i> and <i>Gratz,</i> cases involving state action, the schools perforce did not argue that their programs satisfied &#167; 1981.

At step one, Plaintiff established a prima facie case by showing (as the Schools concede) that the Kamehameha Schools consider applicants' Hawaiian ancestry, or lack thereof, in making admissions decisions. At step two, the Kamehameha Schools have specified their remedial admissions policy as the non-discriminatory rationale for their decisions. <i>See Johnson,</i> 480 U.S. at 626, 107 S.Ct. 1442 (holding that an affirmative action plan provides a legitimate reason for a hiring decision that considers race or ethnicity).

In concluding that the plan was permissible under Title VII, the Court noted that the plan did not \"unnecessarily trammel the interests of the white employees\" or \"create an absolute bar to the[ir] advancement.\" <i>Id.</i> at 208, 99 S.Ct. 2721. The Court based its decision in part on the fact that the plan was a \"temporary measure\": \"Preferential selection ... will end as soon as the percentage of black skilled craftworkers in the Gramercy plant approximates the percentage of blacks in the local labor force.\" <i>Id.</i> at 208-09, 99 S.Ct. 2721.

Like <i>Weber, Johnson</i> also considered whether the plan unnecessarily trammeled the rights of the non-preferred class, in this case men, or created an absolute bar to their advancement. <i>Id.</i> at 637-38, 107 S.Ct. 1442. Finally, the Court considered whether the plan was \"temporary,\" designed to \"<i>attain</i> a balanced work force, not to maintain one.\" <i>Id.</i> at 639-40, 107 S.Ct. 1442.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recently distilled the Court's analysis this way: private employers' affirmative action plans (1) must respond to a manifest imbalance in the work force; (2) must not \"unnecessarily trammel[ ]\" the rights of members of the non-preferred class or \"create an absolute bar to their advancement\"; and (3) must do no more than is necessary to attain a balance. <i>Rudebusch v.

In the employment context, the Supreme Court held that, in enacting Title VII, Congress wished to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the freedom and discretion traditionally afforded to private businesses. <i>Weber,</i> 443 U.S. at 206-07, 99 S.Ct. 2721. In the educational context, the Court has underscored that \"complex educational judgments\" should be left largely to schools. <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 328, 123 S.Ct. 2325; <i>see also Regents of Univ. of Mich. v.

Consequently, we must accord deference to private educational decisionmakers just as we do to private business decisionmakers and public educational decisionmakers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, schools perform a significantly broader function than do employers. The Supreme Court has long recognized that schools do more than simply teach our Nation's children the three \"R's.\" Schools play a special role in the development of young citizens. <i>See Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 331, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (\"We have repeatedly acknowledged the overriding importance of preparing students for work and citizenship, describing education as pivotal to sustaining our political and cultural heritage with a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of society.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Brown v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 347 U.S. 483, 493, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) (\"[E]ducation . . . is the very foundation of good citizenship.\"). Educational opportunity is crucial to the development of tomorrow's leaders. <i>See Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 332, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (\"In order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Primary and secondary school education is the gateway to higher education and is of paramount importance for the training of our nation's workforce. <i>See Plyler v. Doe,</i> 457 U.S. 202, 221, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982) (\"[E]ducation provides the basic tools by which individuals might lead economically productive lives to the benefit of us all.\"); <i>City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc.,</i> 507 U.S. 410, 437, 113 S.Ct. 1505, 123 L.Ed.2d 99 (1993) (Blackmun, J., concurring) (\"Our cases have consistently recognized the importance of education to the professional and personal development of the individual.\"). Perhaps more relevant here, increased primary and secondary school educational achievement by minority groups can obviate the downstream need for affirmative action programs by employers and institutions of higher learning. <i>See Johnson,</i> 480 U.S. at 635, 107 S.Ct. 1442 (noting that very limited numbers of women and minorities possess the \"specialized training and experience\" required for many categories of jobs); <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 346, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (noting that the need for affirmative action programs in higher education will decrease \"[a]s lower school education in minority communities improves\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, schools educate students for their future endeavors in society as a whole. While private employers strive primarily to make money, and public employers (such as police and fire departments) perform a specific public function, schools pursue a much broader mission: the development of all children to become citizens, leaders, and workers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Title VII cases, in the employment context, recognize the laudable goal of achieving diversity and proportional representation in the workplace; this goal necessarily focuses <i>internally</i> and is limited to the \"employer's work force.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 480 U.S. at 632, 107 S.Ct. 1442. By contrast, ensuring that significantly underachieving minority groups are included fully as tomorrow's citizens, leaders, and workers necessarily focuses <i>externally.</i> Considering this important difference, we conclude that we should use a standard for evaluating remedial racial preferences by wholly private primary and secondary schools that is akin to that used in Title VII employment cases, but that takes into account the inherently broad and societal focus of the educational endeavor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adjusting the first <i>Johnson</i> factor to account for this external focus, we hold that, to justify a remedial racial preference, a private school must demonstrate that specific, significant imbalances in educational achievement presently affect the target population. The external focus of the educational mission renders unnecessary the requirement of proof of a \"manifest imbalance\" <i>within</i> a particular school; the relevant population is the community as a whole. At the same time, the strict focus on present, demonstrable disparities in educational achievement limits the types of permissible programs and distinguishes a more amorphous program that relies solely on general past societal discrimination. <i>See City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.,</i> 488 U.S. 469, 505-06, 109 S.Ct. 706, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relatedly, the second <i>Johnson</i> factor must be modified to account for the relevant scope of inquiry. Just as imbalance should be viewed in the relevant community, rather than in a single school, so should the respective rights of members of the non-preferred group. Therefore, within the community as a whole, an admissions policy must not \"unnecessarily trammel\" the rights of students in the non-preferred class or \"create an absolute bar\" to their advancement. The third <i>Johnson</i> factor is similarly modified: an admissions policy must do no more than is necessary to remedy the imbalance in the community as a whole, that we identified at the first step. These three factors best harmonize the relevant statutes and Supreme Court cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Bybee's reliance on <i>Runyon</i> in attacking our conclusion is particularly misplaced. As his dissent quotes several times, diss. at 857, 858, 860, the Supreme Court in <i>Runyon</i> held that private primary schools in Virginia that categorically denied admission to African-American applicants represented a \"classic violation of &#167; 1981.\" <i>Runyon,</i> 427 U.S. at 172, 96 S.Ct. 2586. Nothing in the modified <i>Johnson</i> framework that we adopt today, or indeed anywhere in this opinion, is to the contrary. Quite simply, <i>Runyon</i> is inapposite: The program at issue in <i>Runyon</i> would certainly fail the first step of our analysis because specific, significant imbalances did not exist <i>favoring</i> African-Americans. To the contrary, specific, significant imbalances did exist <i>disfavoring</i> African-Americans. The Civil Rights Act was passed specifically with the plight of African-Americans in mind. It is therefore unsurprising that the Court labeled a whites-only admissions policy a \"classic violation of &#167; 1981.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, the very nature of affirmative action plans is that historically disfavored and underachieving minorities may be given preferential treatment in certain narrowly defined, limited programs. It is the contours of such a program&#8212;a private school's voluntary remedial admissions program&#8212;that we explore today. We turn now to applying the three modified <i>Johnson</i> factors to the Kamehameha Schools' admissions policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Respond to a Manifest Imbalance</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To meet the first modified <i>Johnson</i> factor, a private school must demonstrate that, in the relevant community, specific, significant imbalances in educational achievement presently affect the group favored by its admissions policy. The relevant community in this case is the state of Hawaii, because the Schools serve students from all of Hawaii's islands. We therefore consider whether a manifest imbalance in current educational achievement exists between Native Hawaiians and other ethnic groups in Hawaii.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Native Hawaiian students are systemically disadvantaged in the classroom. As we described earlier, there is a substantial disparity in performance between Native Hawaiian students and other ethnic groups. Briefly, Native Hawaiian students score lower on standardized tests than all other ethnic groups in the state, Ka Huakai at 229, 261, are more likely to be in special education classes, <i>id.</i> at 278, are more likely to be absent from school, <i>id.</i> at 229, and are more likely to attend poor-quality schools, <i>id.</i> at 252. Native Hawaiians are the least likely of the state's major ethnic groups to graduate from high school, <i>id.</i> at 229, 285, and they are less likely than their non-Hawaiian counterparts to attend college, <i>id.</i> at 118-19. Congress has expressly recognized the educational disadvantages suffered by Native Hawaiians and their marginalized status. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 7512.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of those facts and congressional findings, it is clear that a manifest imbalance exists in the K-12 educational arena in the state of Hawaii, with Native Hawaiians falling at the bottom of the spectrum in almost all areas of educational progress and success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, it is precisely this manifest imbalance that the Kamehameha Schools' admissions policy seeks to address. The goal is to bring Native Hawaiian students into educational parity with other ethnic groups in Hawaii. The stated purpose of Kamehameha Schools is to create educational opportunities to improve the capability and well-being of Native Hawaiians and to cultivate, nurture, and perpetuate Hawaiian culture, values, history, and language.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To that end, the Schools advance a curriculum specially tailored to students of Native Hawaiian descent. The Schools have pinpointed areas in which Native Hawaiians, in particular, are severely disadvantaged and have developed a curriculum to attend to those needs. The Schools have instituted a \"Leadership Model\" of education, meant to \"restore self-identity, integrate Native Hawaiian culture, heritage, language, and traditions into the educational process, and provide a first-rate educational experience for Native Hawaiians.\" The Schools' efforts are aimed at increasing scores on standardized tests, increasing the number of Native Hawaiians attending colleges and graduate schools, improving Native Hawaiian representation in professional, academic, and managerial positions, and developing community leaders who are committed to improving the lives of all Native Hawaiians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Kamehameha Schools recognized, early on, a critical need to help perpetuate Native Hawaiian culture. As a result, in the 1940s, the Schools instituted a formal Hawaiian Cultural Program that continues today. Courses on Hawaiian history and culture are required before a student may graduate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Kamehameha Schools have shown that specific, significant imbalances in educational achievement currently affect Native Hawaiians in Hawaii and that the Schools aim to remedy that imbalance. Accordingly, they have satisfied the \"manifest imbalance\" criterion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Do Not Unnecessarily Trammel the Rights of Members of the Non-Preferred Class or Create an Absolute Bar to Their Advancement</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the second prong of the modified Title VII analysis, we ask whether, within the relevant community of Hawaii, the Kamehameha Schools' admissions policy unnecessarily trammels the rights of members of the non-preferred class, that is, students with no Hawaiian ancestry, or creates an absolute bar to their advancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Kamehameha Schools allow all students to apply for admission. But once the applications are received, the Schools consider the ethnic background of the students and admit qualified children with Native Hawaiian ancestry before admitting children with no such ancestry. Because the pool of qualified potential students with Native Hawaiian blood greatly outnumbers the available slots at the Schools, non-Native Hawaiians generally are not admitted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> For the reasons that follow, however, the Schools' admissions policy does not unnecessarily trammel the rights of non-Native Hawaiians or create an absolute bar to their advancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that nothing in the record suggests that educational opportunities in Hawaii are deficient for students, like Plaintiff, who lack any Native Hawaiian ancestry. To the contrary, the same statistical data that portray the difficulties of Native Hawaiian children generally portray much greater educational achievement, in both public and private primary and secondary schools, for children of all other racial and ethnic groups in Hawaii. Those students denied admission by Kamehameha Schools have ample and adequate alternative educational options. The well-documented ability of non-Native Hawaiians to attain educational achievement in Hawaii notwithstanding the Kamehameha Schools' longstanding admissions policy demonstrates that the policy neither unnecessarily trammels the rights of non-Native Hawaiians nor absolutely bars their advancement in the relevant community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our inquiry does not stop there, however. The history of Native Hawaiians and of the Kamehameha Schools has certain unique features that Congress has acknowledged. In 1993, Congress admitted that the United States was responsible, in part, for the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. 1993 Apology Resolution, 107 Stat. 1510. Later, when it enacted education-related legislation in 1994, and then reenacted that legislation in 2002, Congress made findings regarding the disadvantages faced by Native Hawaiian students in the public school system in Hawaii. 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 7901-7941, 7512(16). As part of the 2002 reenactment, a congressional committee even urged the Bishop Trust, which operates the Kamehameha Schools, to \"redouble its efforts to educate <i>Native Hawaiian</i> children.\" H.R.Rep. No. 107-63(I), at 333 (2001) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congressional recognition of the challenges faced by Native Hawaiians in the educational arena supports our conclusion that the Schools' policy does not unnecessarily trammel the rights of non-Native Hawaiians. To the contrary, as Congress has recognized, in the unique context of Native Hawaiian history, affirmative measures are needed to address present, severe inequalities in educational achievement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we examine the expectations of those who lack Native Hawaiian ancestry. The Supreme Court observed in <i>Johnson</i> that \"the denial of the promotion[at issue] unsettled no legitimate, firmly rooted expectation on the part of petitioner.\" 480 U.S. at 638, 107 S.Ct. 1442. Similarly, here, we must ask whether Plaintiff had a legitimate, firmly rooted expectation of admission to the Schools. The answer is \"no.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No applicant to the Kamehameha Schools is guaranteed admission. Just as the applicant in <i>Johnson</i> \"had no absolute entitlement\" to the promotion from his employer, Plaintiff here likewise \"had no absolute entitlement\" to admission to the Schools. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the Kamehameha Schools were established when Hawaii was a sovereign nation, and they were built on the Hawaiian monarchy's land. When the Schools began, a non-Native Hawaiian had no expectation of admission to the Schools, except when Native Hawaiians failed to fill all the available slots, or until Native Hawaiians achieved educational parity with others. <i>See supra</i> p. 832. In the intervening 118 years, the Schools' admissions policy, and therefore the expectations of the non-Native Hawaiians, has remained constant. Thus, denial of Plaintiff's application for admission \"unsettled no legitimate, firmly rooted expectation.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 480 U.S. at 638, 107 S.Ct. 1442.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the Kamehameha Schools' admissions policy does not unnecessarily trammel the rights of non-Native Hawaiians or create an absolute bar to their advancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Do No More than Is Necessary</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Schools' admissions policy must do no more than is necessary to correct the manifest imbalance suffered by students of Native Hawaiian ancestry. This factor requires that an affirmative action plan be \"temporary.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 480 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. 1442; <i>Weber,</i> 443 U.S. at 208, 99 S.Ct. 2721.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Kamehameha Schools' decision to give preference to students with Native Hawaiian ancestry is limited in duration in two distinct ways. First, if qualified students with Native Hawaiian ancestry do not apply to the Schools in sufficient numbers to fill the spots available, as happened in one recent year, <i>see supra</i> note 10, the Schools' policy is to open admissions to any qualified candidate. Second, preference will be given to students with Native Hawaiian ancestry only for so long as is necessary to remedy the current educational effects of past, private and government-sponsored discrimination and of social and economic deprivation. These dual aspects of the Kamehameha Schools' policy constitute an \"[e]xpress assurance that a program is only temporary.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 480 U.S. at 639-40, 107 S.Ct. 1442. An explicit or immediately foreseeable end date has never been required for an affirmative action plan to be valid. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 639, 107 S.Ct. 1442 (finding the lack of an \"explicit end date\" \"unsurprising\" and upholding an employer's affirmative action plan even though \"only gradual\" improvements were anticipated); <i>see also Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 343, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (adopting Justice Powell's reasoning in the 25-year-old <i>Bakke</i> decision, which upheld affirmative action programs in higher education, and expecting that in 25 more years, these programs \"will no longer be necessary\"&#8212;a span of 50 years).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the admissions policy is not fixed, but changes as the capacity of the Schools' programs increases and as the well-being of the Native Hawaiian community rises, the policy does no more than is necessary in light of the significant educational imbalances that Native Hawaiians continue to face.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the Kamehameha Schools' admissions policy satisfies the three <i>Johnson</i> criteria&#8212;offset a manifest imbalance, do not unnecessarily trammel others' rights or create an absolute bar, and do no more than is necessary&#8212;as modified for the private primary and secondary school context. The Schools have shown that the admissions policy, favoring students of Native Hawaiian descent, is legitimate and valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Bybee's dissent contends that we should hew more closely to a traditional Title VII analysis and that, under such an analysis, the Schools' preferential admissions policy is not valid. (Bybee, J., diss. at 857-85.) For the reasons that we have detailed, we believe that the dissent's focus is too narrow for the private school context and that Kamehameha Schools' remedial admissions policy is legitimate in the face of the serious and systemic disadvantages faced by Native Hawaiian students in Hawaii today. <i>See Johnson,</i> 480 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. 1442 (\"In evaluating the compliance of an affirmative action plan with Title VII's prohibition on discrimination, we must be mindful of this Court's and Congress' consistent emphasis on the value of voluntary efforts to further the objectives of the law.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>see also Rudebusch,</i> 313 F.3d at 522-24 (revising the third <i>Johnson</i> factor to analyze quantitative rather than temporal limitations because of the context).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to try to shove a square peg into a round hole by strictly applying the test developed in employment cases to the Kamehameha Schools' admissions policy, that policy would still be valid. As the Supreme Court has cautioned, \"[i]t is a familiar rule that a thing may be within the letter of the statute and yet not within the statute, because not within its spirit nor within the intention of its makers.\" <i>Weber,</i> 443 U.S. at 201, 99 S.Ct. 2721 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Kamehameha Schools' admissions policy holds true to the spirit of &#167; 1981 by supporting Native Hawaiian students so that they may attain parity with their non-Native Hawaiian peers. <i>See Gen. Bldg. Contractors,</i> 458 U.S. at 386, 102 S.Ct. 3141.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Alternatively, and in Addition, Congress Specifically Intended to Allow the Kamehameha Schools to Operate When, in 1991, It Re-enacted &#167; 1981.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff brought suit under &#167; 1981.

At that time, the statute did not apply in Hawaii because it was an independent, sovereign kingdom. Congress could not have had any conscious intention as to how the statute would apply in Hawaii, because it did not apply at all. When Hawaii became a territory in 1898, &#167; 1981 applied, as it continued to do when Hawaii became a state in 1959, <i>see</i> Hawaiian Statehood Act, Pub.L. No. 86-3, &#167; 15, 73 Stat. 4.11 (1959), but it was not until 1991 that Congress again addressed and amended &#167; 1981, <i>see</i> Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub.L. No. 102-166, &#167; 101, 105 Stat. 1071. The 1991 amendments are the most recent, and indeed the only, time since Hawaii became a territory that Congress has reenacted &#167; 1981.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, we must determine what Congress intended, with regard to Native Hawaiians, when it reenacted &#167; 1981 in 1991. Because \"[w]e assume that Congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation,\" <i>Miles v. Apex Marine Corp.,</i> 498 U.S. 19, 32, 111 S.Ct. 317, 112 L.Ed.2d 275 (1990), we must consider Congress' long history of providing for Native Hawaiians through legislation. <i>See Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller,</i> 486 U.S. 174, 184-85, 108 S.Ct. 1704, 100 L.Ed.2d 158 (1988) (noting that courts \"generally presume that Congress is knowledgeable about existing law pertinent to the legislation it enacts\"). By construing &#167; 1981 in the context of past congressional action that recognizes and provides for Native Hawaiians, we preserve the \"sense and purpose\" of all relevant statutes. <i>See Watt v. Alaska,</i> 451 U.S. 259, 267, 101 S.Ct. 1673, 68 L.Ed.2d 80 (1981) (noting that it is the duty of the courts to give effect to differing and conflicting statutes so as to preserve their \"sense and purpose\"). Importantly, the Supreme Court has expressly considered contemporaneous legislation when interpreting the scope of &#167; 1981. In <i>Runyon,</i> for instance, the Court relied on Congress' enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other civil rights legislation in concluding that Congress must have intended &#167; 1981 to reach private acts of discrimination. 427 U.S. at 174, 96 S.Ct. 2586; <i>see also Weber,</i> 443 U.S. at 201, 99 S.Ct. 2721 (noting that the application of Title VII to remedial affirmative action plans must be read in light of its legislative history and \"the historical context from which the Act arose\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we look to legislation that Congress has passed specifically affecting Native Hawaiians both before and after 1991. As we have explained, we consider the pre-1991 statutory landscape because it informs us about what Congress had in mind when it reenacted &#167; 1981. We consider the post-1991 statutes to the extent that they demonstrate Congress' own understanding of &#167; 1981. That is, we presume that Congress acts consistently with the extant body of law; statutes enacted after 1991, therefore, must be read consistently with the revised version of &#167; 1981. <i>See Cannon v. Univ. of Chi.,</i> 441 U.S. 677, 696-97, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (concluding that elected officials are presumed to know the law, and that statutes should be read consistently with each other).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning as early as 1920, Congress recognized that a special relationship existed between the United States and Hawaii. <i>See</i> Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, 42 Stat. 108 (1921) (designating approximately 200,000 acres of ceded public lands to Native Hawaiians for homesteading). Over the years, Congress has reaffirmed the unique relationship that the United States has with Hawaii, as a result of the American involvement in the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 7512(12), (13) (Native Hawaiian Education Act, 2002); 42 U.S.C. &#167; 11701(13), (14), (19), (20) (Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress has relied on the special relationship that the United States has with Native Hawaiians to provide specifically for their welfare in a number of different contexts. For example, in 1987, Congress amended the Native American Programs Act of 1974, Pub.L. No. 100-175, &#167; 506, 101 Stat. 926 (1987), to provide federal funds for a state agency or \"community-based Native Hawaiian organization\" to \"make loans to Native Hawaiian organizations and to individual Native Hawaiians for the purpose of promoting economic development in the state of Hawaii.\" A year later, Congress enacted the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988, Pub.L. No. 100-579, &#167; 11703(a), 102 Stat. 2916 (1988), \"for the purpose of providing comprehensive health promotion and disease prevention services as well as primary health services to Native Hawaiians.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most importantly for our purposes today, Congress also has focused its attention on the educational disparities faced by Native Hawaiian students. In 1988, just three years before reenacting &#167; 1981, Congress passed the Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988. 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 4901-4909 (1988) (repealed 1994) (hereinafter \"Hawkins-Stafford Amendments\"). Congress made extensive findings, similar to the findings that it later made in 2002, <i>see supra</i> pp. 833-34, about the educational needs of Native Hawaiians and recognized the necessity for \"special efforts in education recognizing the unique cultural and historical circumstances of Native Hawaiians.\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 4901(9) (1988) (repealed 1994). For instance, Congress concluded that it has the power to \"specially legislate for the benefit of Native Hawaiians,\" encouraged Native Hawaiians to play an active role in planning and managing Native Hawaiian educational programs, and noted that Native Hawaiians disproportionally fell below their peers in terms of educational achievement and progress. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4901(2) (1988) (repealed 1994). Congress then went on to affirm specifically the mission of Kamehameha Schools and the Schools' model elementary curriculum, <i>approving by name</i> the Schools' continued research and assessment activities. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4904(a) (1988) (repealed 1994). Similarly, Congress directed the Secretary of Education to make grants to the Schools \"for a demonstration program to provide Higher Education fellowship assistance to Native Hawaiian students.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4905(a) (1988) (repealed 1994). The sole recipients of that assistance were to be \"Native Hawaiians,\" a term that was defined in the statute, as it is by Kamehameha Schools, as \"a descendant of the aboriginal people, who prior to 1778, occupied and exercised sovereignty in the area that now comprises the State of Hawaii.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4909(1)(C) (1988) (repealed 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hawkins-Stafford Amendments were repealed in 1994. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 4901 (1991) (repealed 1994). But for two reasons that fact does not alter the landscape of Native Hawaiian-oriented congressional enactments against which &#167; 1981 must be read. First, when Congress reenacted &#167; 1981 in 1991, the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments were still in effect. Second, Congress has continued thereafter to emphasize the need for special educational opportunities for Native Hawaiian students. (<i>See</i> Concurrence, p. 856.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reenacting &#167; 1981, Congress passed the Native Hawaiian Education Act of 1994, 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 7901-7941, and then reenacted that statute in 2002, 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 7511-7517 (hereinafter \"NHEA\"). Like the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments, the NHEA recognized the special needs of Native Hawaiian students and the great disadvantages that they still face in Hawaii. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 7512. As part of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, a congressional committee favorably mentioned the Bishop Trust and exhorted the Schools to \"redouble [their] efforts\" to provide for Native Hawaiians. H.R.Rep. No. 107-63(I), at 333.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These steadfast congressional policies favoring remedial measures for Native Hawaiians&#8212;and specifically remedial educational measures, some of them even mentioning the Schools and the Bishop Trust approvingly by name&#8212;inform our analysis of the validity of the Kamehameha Schools' admissions policy under &#167; 1981. It would be incongruous to conclude that while Congress was repeatedly enacting remedial measures aimed exclusively at Native Hawaiians, at the same time Congress would reject such Native Hawaiian preferences through &#167; 1981. Moreover, by reenacting &#167; 1981 in the midst of passing other legislation to provide specifically and particularly for the education of Native Hawaiians, Congress signaled its clear support for the Kamehameha Schools and for the validity of the Schools' admissions policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the most plausible reading of &#167; 1981, in light of the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments and the NHEA, is that Congress intended that a preference for Native Hawaiians, in Hawaii, by a Native Hawaiian organization, located on the Hawaiian monarchy's ancestral lands, be upheld because it furthers the urgent need for better education of Native Hawaiians, which Congress has repeatedly identified as necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">King Kamehameha I, on his death bed, is reported to have said, \"Tell my people I have planted in the soil of our land the roots of a plan for their happiness.\" <i>Princess Pauahi Bishop and Her Legacy</i> at 122. His great granddaughter, Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, echoed that sentiment when she established, through her will, the Kamehameha Schools. Because the Schools are a wholly private K-12 educational establishment, whose preferential admissions policy is designed to counteract the significant, current educational deficits of Native Hawaiian children in Hawaii, and because in 1991 Congress clearly intended &#167; 1981 to exist in harmony with its other legislation providing specially for the education of Native Hawaiians, we must conclude that the admissions policy is valid under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>Doe v.

Based on this assumption, it holds that &#167; 1981 permits private schools, in certain circumstances, to prefer disadvantaged minority groups&#8212;not limited to Native Hawaiians&#8212;based on race. But the case before us does not involve an admissions policy generally favoring disadvantaged minorities, or favoring specific racial or ethnic groups such as African-Americans or Hispanics.

The basis for this exercise of power is Congress' conclusion that \"Native Hawaiian,\" like \"Alaska Native\" and \"Indian,\" is a political classification subject to the special relationship doctrine. Unless we were to hold that Congress cannot legislate for the special benefit of Native Hawaiians, thereby striking down the enormous swaths of the United States Code enacted pursuant to the special relationship doctrine, we must conclude that the doctrine permits Congress to provide special benefits to Native Hawaiians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I recognize that the Court has struck down a statute granting preferential voting rights to Native Hawaiians, but voting rights are sui generis. In <i>Rice v. Cayetano,</i> 528 U.S. 495, 120 S.Ct. 1044, 145 L.Ed.2d 1007 (2000), the Supreme Court addressed a provision of the Hawaiian Constitution limiting to \"Hawaiians\" the right to vote in a certain statewide election. The term \"Hawaiians\" was generally defined as descendants of people inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands in 1778. <i>Id.</i> at 499, 509, 120 S.Ct. 1044. The Court held that under the Fifteenth Amendment \"Congress may not authorize a State to create a voting scheme of this sort.\" <i>Id.</i> at 519, 120 S.Ct. 1044. In so holding, the Court assumed \"authority in Congress, delegated to the State, to treat Hawaiians or native Hawaiians as tribes,\" <i>id.,</i> but it refused to extend the special relationship doctrine to the \"new and larger dimension\" of voting restrictions in state elections. <i>Id.</i> at 520, 120 S.Ct. 1044.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court in <i>Rice</i> was careful to confine its analysis to voting rights under the Fifteenth Amendment. It cautioned that 19094 \"[t]he validity of the voting restriction is the only question before us.\" <i>Id.</i> at 521, 120 S.Ct. 1044. Emphasizing the importance and unique character of voting rights under the Fifteenth Amendment, the Court wrote, \"the Amendment is cast in fundamental terms, terms transcending the particular controversy which was the immediate impetus for its enactment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 512, 120 S.Ct. 1044. Further, \"use of racial classifications is corruptive of the whole legal order democratic elections seek to preserve.\" <i>Id.</i> at 517, 120 S.Ct. 1044; <i>see also Shaw v.

Rather, it involves the preferential provision of educational benefits. To the extent that the federal Constitution is implicated at all, the relevant text is the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court in <i>Rice</i> never questioned the validity of the special relationship doctrine under the Fourteenth Amendment, and never even hinted that its Fifteenth Amendment analysis would apply to the many benefit programs enacted by Congress for Native Hawaiians, Alaska Natives, and American Indians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I therefore conclude that Congress may, if it wishes, permit Kamehameha Schools to give preferential admissions treatment to Native Hawaiians.

By this time, Congress had enacted numerous statutes that provided exclusive benefit programs for Native Hawaiians or included them in benefit programs for other native peoples.

The Hawkins-Stafford Amendments, passed in 1988, instructed the Secretary of Education to \"make grants to the Kamehameha Schools/Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate for a demonstration program to provide Higher Education fellowship assistance to Native Hawaiian students.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4005(a), 102 Stat. at 360. One year before reenacting &#167; 1981, Congress amended the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary to \"provide funds to Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate for the purpose of providing scholarship assistance\" to eligible Native Hawaiian students. Act of Nov. 29, 1990, Pub.L. No. 101-644, &#167; 401, 104 Stat. 4662, 4668 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 254s).

In order to hold for plaintiff in this case, we would have to conclude that Congress intended this provision to invalidate, <i>sub silentio,</i> the recently enacted legislation that provided loans and scholarships exclusively to Native Hawaiians at Kamehameha Schools. But this conclusion would require us to turn our back on the Supreme Court's analysis in <i>Mancari,</i> where it rejected the challenge of non-Indian plaintiffs to Indian employment preferences as inconsistent with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Mancari</i> plaintiffs argued that</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">since the [Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972] proscribed racial discrimination in Government employment, the Act necessarily, albeit <i>sub silentio,</i> repealed the provision of the [Indian Reorganization Act of 1934] that called for the preference in the [Bureau of Indian Affairs] of one racial group, Indians, over non-Indians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mancari,</i> 417 U.S. at 547, 94 S.Ct. 2474. The 1972 Act, upon which the <i>Mancari</i> plaintiffs relied, amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <i>Id.</i> at 546-47, 94 S.Ct. 2474. Whereas the 1964 Civil Rights Act had expressly exempted certain Indian preferences, neither the text nor the legislative history of the amending 1972 Act made any reference to such preferences. <i>Id.</i> Given that the 1972 Act was specifically modeled on the 1964 Act, the omission of an exemption for Indian preferences was especially glaring, and the plaintiffs' argument for <i>sub silentio</i> repeal especially strong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the Supreme Court unanimously and emphatically rejected the argument for <i>sub silentio</i> repeal by the 1972 Amendment:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>It would be anomalous to conclude that Congress intended to eliminate the longstanding statutory preferences in BIA employment, as being racially discriminatory, at the very same time it was reaffirming the right of tribal and reservation-related private employers to provide Indian preference.</i> Appellees' assertion that Congress implicitly repealed the preference as racially discriminatory, while retaining the 1964 preferences, <i>attributes to Congress irrationality and arbitrariness,</i> an attribution we do not share.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . <i>Three months after Congress passed the 1972 amendments, it enacted two new Indian preference laws . . . . It is improbable, to say the least, that the same Congress which affirmatively approved and enacted these additional and similar Indian preferences was, at the same time, condemning the BIA preference as racially discriminatory.</i> In the total absence of any manifestation of supportive intent, we are loathe to imply this improbable result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a prototypical case where an adjudication of repeal by implication is not appropriate. <i>The preference is a longstanding, important component of the Government's Indian program. The anti-discrimination provision, aimed at alleviating minority discrimination in employment, obviously is designed to deal with an entirely different and, indeed, opposite problem. Any perceived conflict is thus more apparent than real.</i> . . . A provision aimed at furthering Indian self-government by according an employment preference within the BIA for qualified members of the governed group can readily co-exist with a general rule prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of race. <i>Any other conclusion can be reached only by formalistic reasoning that ignores both the history and purposes of the preference and the unique legal relationship between the Federal Government and tribal Indians.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the Indian preference statute is a specific provision applying to a very specific situation. The 1972 Act, on the other hand, is of general application. <i>Where there is no clear intention otherwise, a specific statute will not be</i> <i>controlled or nullified by a general one,</i> regardless of the priority of enactment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The courts are not at liberty to pick and choose among congressional enactments, and <i>when two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 548-51, 94 S.Ct. 2474 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal dissent insists that the failure of &#167; 1981 to include in its text an explicit exception for Native Hawaiians is fatal to Kamehameha Schools' admissions policy. But of all the federal statutes to which strict text-based rules of statutory construction might be applied, &#167; 1981 is a particularly inappropriate candidate. The text of &#167; 1981 only guarantees \"the same right . . . to make and enforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981(a). It does not guarantee the converse&#8212;the right of white persons or citizens to enjoy the same contractual rights as non-whites. Therefore, according to the dissent's interpretive method, &#167; 1981 should not be read to protect whites against private racial discrimination. But we know that, despite the clear text of &#167; 1981, this conclusion would be wrong, for the Supreme Court held in 1976 that whites as well as non-whites are protected under &#167; 1981. <i>McDonald,</i> 427 U.S. at 286-87, 96 S.Ct. 2574.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress' provision of educational benefits to Native Hawaiians continues to this day.

The NHEA expressly declares that \"Congress does not extend services to Native Hawaiians because of their race, but because of their unique status as the indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom the United States has established a trust relationship.\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 7512(12)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Through the NHEA and the myriad other federal statutes that confer benefits on Native Hawaiians, Congress has made manifest its intent to apply some form of the special relationship doctrine to Native Hawaiians. The well established general rule is that less&#8212;not more&#8212;demanding scrutiny applies to private discrimination than to government-sponsored discrimination. It would be deeply ironic for us to hold that &#167; 1981 forbids private institutions from giving Native Hawaiians educational benefits when, at the same time, Congress itself provides such benefits and provides public funds for private organizations to do the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress has invariably treated \"Native Hawaiian\" as a political classification for purposes of providing exclusive educational and other benefits.

Indeed, as <i>Runyon</i> makes clear, discriminating against a private school applicant solely on the basis of that applicant's race \"amounts to a classic violation of &#167; 1981.\" <i>Id.</i> at 172, 96 S.Ct. 2586.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite that well-established principle, the majority today stands <i>Runyon</i> on its head and holds that a private school may deny admission to a prospective student solely because he or she is not a member of a particular race. Though I agree with the majority that Native Hawaiians suffer from severe socio-economic disadvantages and believe that Kamehameha Schools (\"Kamehameha\") should be commended for attempting to remedy those hardships, I cannot concur with the majority's dramatic departure from <i>Runyon.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, the majority has made a number of crucial mistakes. Thus, as set out below in Part I, even though I agree with the majority that Title VII and not strict scrutiny provides the standard of review in this case, I disagree with the majority's sweeping modification of the Title VII standard. Moreover, even if I agreed with the majority's departure from that standard, I could not subscribe to the majority's decision to sanction an absolute racial bar. Likewise, as set out in Part II, I cannot accept as a matter of faithful statutory construction the majority's view that Congress implicitly exempted racial preferences for Native Hawaiians from &#167; 1981 by passing unrelated&#8212;and even since repealed&#8212;statutes. Indeed, I believe the majority's novel approach to statutory interpretation is readily manipulable and would enable courts to rewrite statutes whenever they want to save a particular program, contract, or enactment. Finally, as set out in Part III, because Native Hawaiians do not constitute a federally recognized tribe and Kamehameha is a private party, I also disagree with Judge Fletcher's suggestion that the special relationship doctrine of <i>Morton v. Mancari,</i> 417 U.S. 535, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974), can save Kamehameha's racially exclusive admissions policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As much as I may believe that Kamehameha should be applauded for providing its students an exceptional education and for attempting to remedy the socioeconomic disadvantages facing Native Hawaiians, I cannot turn a blind eye to a classic violation of &#167; 1981. Noble as Kamehameha's goals may be, good intentions are not license to violate our civil rights laws. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p>I.

Op. at 844 &amp; n. 10&#8212;violates 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981 because, as <i>Runyon v. McCrary,</i> 427 U.S. 160, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976), makes clear, discriminating against a private school applicant solely on the basis of that applicant's race \"amounts to a classic violation of &#167; 1981.\" <i>Id.</i> at 172, 96 S.Ct. 2586. Despite the inherent logic of plaintiff's argument, the majority avoids reaching a similar conclusion by holding \"[q]uite simply, <i>Runyon</i> is inapposite,\" Maj. Op. at 843, and grafting a modified Title VII standard onto &#167; 1981.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To create that new standard, the majority dismisses <i>Runyon</i> as irrelevant because \"[t]he program at issue in <i>Runyon</i> would certainly fail\" the majority's analysis. <i>Id.</i> In so holding, however, the majority ignores the critical fact that the admissions programs involved in <i>Runyon</i>&#8212;like Kamehameha's&#8212;violated &#167; 1981 because they used race as the determinative admissions factor. Instead, the majority converts <i>Runyon</i> into a case about a \"whites-only admissions\" program that is \"inapposite\" to Kamehameha's Native Hawaiians-only admissions policy. <i>Id.</i> I find the majority's decision to dismiss <i>Runyon</i> in order to approve a policy that bars African American (and any other) children who lack Native Hawaiian ancestry to be unfortunate and wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Putting those concerns aside for the moment, and turning to the next step in the majority's analysis, the majority holds that Title VII scrutiny, and not strict scrutiny, applies to alleged &#167; 1981 violations. Maj. Op. at 839. That second step in the majority's analysis is sound. Like the majority, I agree that Title VII standards and not strict scrutiny must apply to &#167; 1981 actions because to hold otherwise would effectively render the Title VII's provisions that expressly contemplate affirmative action plans nonsensical. Maj. Op. at 839; <i>see also Schurr v. Resorts Int'l Hotel, Inc.,</i> 196 F.3d 486, 498-99 (3d Cir.1999); <i>Edmonson v. United States Steel Corp.,</i> 659 F.2d 582, 584 (5th Cir.1981) (per curiam); <i>Setser v. Novack Inv. Co.,</i> 657 F.2d 962, 966-68 (8th Cir.1981) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the Title VII approach, the majority also correctly holds that the burden shifting analysis of <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), applies to plaintiff's &#167; 1981 claim. <i>See</i> Maj. Op. at 837-38. Under that test, \"[t]he complainant in a Title VII trial must carry the initial burden under the statute of establishing a prima facie case of racial discrimination.\" <i>McDonnell Douglas,</i> 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. Where an explicit race-based policy exists, proof of that fact alone is sufficient to establish a prima facie case. If the plaintiff proves his prima facie case, a rebuttable presumption of intentional discrimination arises, <i>see Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine,</i> 450 U.S. 248, 254, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981), and the burden of production \"shift[s] to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\" for the conduct at issue. <i>McDonnell Douglas,</i> 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. \"The existence of an affirmative action plan provides such a rationale.\" <i>Johnson v. Transp. Agency,</i> 480 U.S. 616, 626, 107 S.Ct. 1442, 94 L.Ed.2d 615 (1987). \"If such a plan is articulated as the basis for the employer's decision, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to prove that . . . the plan is invalid.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Kamehameha concedes that it employs a preference that favors Native Hawaiian applicants, plaintiff has met his burden to show a prima facie case of racial discrimination. Maj. Op. at 839-40. Kamehameha argues, however, that its conduct is permissible because its admissions policy was executed pursuant to an affirmative action plan, thereby rebutting the presumption of illegality. Thus, as the majority concludes, this case hinges entirely on the third step of the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> analysis&#8212;<i>i.e.,</i> whether Kamehameha's plan is invalid. <i>See</i> Maj. Op. at 839-40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is at this point, when the majority entirely reworks the standards for determining whether an affirmative action plan is valid, that the majority's analysis goes astray. Under <i>United Steelworkers of America v. Weber,</i> 443 U.S. 193, 99 S.Ct. 2721, 61 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979), and <i>Johnson v. Transportation Agency,</i> 480 U.S. 616, 107 S.Ct. 1442, 94 L.Ed.2d 615 (1987), an affirmative action program must satisfy the following factors to be considered valid: (1) It must be \"justified by the existence of a `manifest imbalance'\" in the employer's workforce that is reflective of traditionally segregated job categories; (2) it may not \"`unnecessarily trammel[ ] the rights of [other] employees or create[ ] an absolute bar to their advancement'\"; and (3) it must \"be designed to do[no] more than `attain a balance.'\" <i>Rudebusch v. Hughes,</i> 313 F.3d 506, 520 (9th Cir.2002) (first and third alteration in original) (quoting <i>Johnson,</i> 480 U.S. at 631, 637-38, 639, 107 S.Ct. 1442).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-2\" id=\"fn1-2_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reasoning that primary and secondary educational contracts are different, however, the majority alters all three factors and holds that a private school may discriminate on the basis of race whenever: (1) \"significant imbalances in educational achievement [in the community as a whole] presently affect the target population\"; (2) the discriminatory policy does not \"unnecessarily trammel[ ] the rights of students in the non-preferred\" racial group as a whole \"or create an absolute bar to their advancement\"; and (3) \"the[discriminatory] policy [does] no more than is necessary to correct the imbalance . . . identified at the first step.\" Maj. Op. at 842.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though I recognize that the Title VII standard was forged in the employment discrimination context and that some modification may be necessary to adapt it to other settings, I disagree, as explained below, with the majority's general justification for departing from precedent and with each specific alteration it makes to the Title VII standard. Furthermore, I also disagree with the majority's application of its own standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Majority's Modification of the Title VII Standard</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority creates a standard that, by its own terms, applies <i>only</i> to primary and secondary schools. It grounds that decision entirely on its finding that the ordinary Title VII standard, which was developed in the employment setting, cannot apply to primary and secondary educational contracts. But, there is absolutely nothing in &#167; 1981's text to suggest that contracts made with \"private employers [that] strive primarily to make money[ ] and public employers [that] perform a specific public function\" should be subject to a different standard than primary and secondary schools that have \"a much broader [external] mission.\" Maj. Op. at 842. Indeed, the majority neglects the fact that &#167; 1981 guarantees to \"[a]ll persons . . . the same right . . . to make and enforce <i>contracts</i> . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981(a) (emphasis added). Given &#167; 1981's plain text, then, it is not surprising that the majority cannot cite a single case to support the novel proposition that primary and secondary educational contracts are different from other contracts and are entitled to special treatment under &#167; 1981.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the Supreme Court has rejected that very argument. For instance, far from finding that a school's \"much broader mission\" or external focus made a difference, <i>Runyon</i>&#8212;which involved a racially exclusive primary and secondary private school admissions policy&#8212;reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apparent that the racial exclusion practiced by the Fairfax-Brewster School and Bobbe's Private School amounts to a classic violation of &#167; 1981. The parents . . . sought to enter into contractual relationships with [the schools] for educational services . . . . Under those contractual relationships, the schools would have received payments for services rendered, and the prospective students would have received instruction in return for those payments . . . . [N]either school offered services on equal basis to white and nonwhite students. . . . [Plaintiffs] were denied admission to the schools because of their race. The . . . conclusion that &#167; 1981 was thereby violated follows inexorably from the language of that statute, as construed in [prior Supreme Court case law].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">427 U.S. at 172-73, 96 S.Ct. 2586 (quotation and citation omitted) (footnote omitted). Thus, the majority's argument that primary and secondary private school educational contracts should be treated differently from other contracts under &#167; 1981 was squarely rejected in <i>Runyon,</i> and I would adhere to that precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the majority's rationale does not find any support in Title VII jurisprudence. Indeed, under Title VII the Supreme Court has uniformly measured affirmative action programs against the standard established in <i>Weber</i> as explained above. For example, <i>Johnson</i> employed <i>Weber</i> to determine the validity of a county transportation agency's affirmative action program under Title VII. 480 U.S. at 626-40, 107 S.Ct. 1442; <i>see also id.</i> at 631, 107 S.Ct. 1442 (\"[W]e must first examine whether [the employment] decision was made pursuant to a plan prompted by concerns similar to those of the employer in <i>Weber.</i> Next, we must determine whether the effect of the plan on[the non-preferred race] is comparable to the effect of the Plan in that case.\"); <i>id.</i> at 627, 107 S.Ct. 1442 (\"The assessment of the legality of the Agency Plan must be guided by our decision in <i>Weber.\"</i> (footnote omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our own jurisprudence has closely followed the Supreme Court's lead in this area, and, as the majority candidly concedes, under Title VII, we have always applied the same standard, even when the program \"at issue was not wholly analogous to the hiring and promotional plans at issue in <i>Weber</i> and <i>Johnson</i> because of some significant conceptual differences between the types of plans,\" Maj. Op. at 841 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-2\" id=\"fn2-2_ref\">2</a> Our sister circuits have done the same, even when the case involved primary and secondary schools that have \"a much broader [external] mission.\" <i>See, e.g., Taxman v.

No. 60,</i> 917 F.2d 431, 437-38 (10th Cir.1990) (evaluating a race conscious lay-off plan for primary and secondary school personnel under the <i>Weber</i> standard).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority fails to explain why we must create a special standard for primary and secondary educational contract cases.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a> If anything, as highlighted above, <i>Runyon</i> compels the conclusion that a primary and secondary educational contract&#8212;like any other contract&#8212;that discriminates solely on the basis of race violates &#167; 1981. <i>See</i> 427 U.S. at 172, 96 S.Ct. 2586. As noted above, I also disagree with the majority's far-reaching adaption of all three of the Supreme Court's factors for determining the validity of an affirmative action program, to which I now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

Under the first <i>Weber</i> and <i>Johnson</i> factor, the Supreme Court has required that a Title VII affirmative action program be \"justified by the existence of a manifest imbalance that reflected underrepresentation of [the favored group] in traditionally segregated job categories.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 480 U.S. at 631, 107 S.Ct. 1442 (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>accord Weber,</i> 443 U.S. at 208, 209, 99 S.Ct. 2721; <i>id.</i> at 212-15, 99 S.Ct. 2721 (Blackmun, J., concurring). Our cases have consistently and faithfully applied this requirement. <i>See, e.g., Officers for Justice v. Civil Serv. Comm'n,</i> 979 F.2d 721, 725 (9th Cir.1992) (\"Under Title VII analysis, voluntary adoption of a race-based remedy may be justified by a showing that a manifest imbalance exists, reflecting underrepresentation of [the favored group] in traditionally segregated job categories.\" (internal quotations omitted)); <i>Davis v. City &amp; County of S.F.,</i> 890 F.2d 1438, 1448 (9th Cir.1989) (same); <i>Higgins v. City of Vallejo,</i> 823 F.2d 351, 356 (9th Cir.1987) (same); <i>La Riviere v. EEOC,</i> 682 F.2d 1275, 1278 (9th Cir.1982) (applying the same standard to a sex-based affirmative action plan).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, we have consistently applied the Supreme Court's holding that \"[i]n determining whether an imbalance exists that would justify taking . . . race into account, a comparison of the percentage of minorities . . . <i>in the employer's work force</i> with the percentage in the area labor market . . . is appropriate. . . .\" <i>Johnson,</i> 480 U.S. at 631-32, 107 S.Ct. 1442 (emphasis added); <i>accord Weber,</i> 443 U.S. at 204-206, 99 S.Ct. 2721; <i>Davis,</i> 890 F.2d at 1448 (\"To determine whether such an imbalance has occurred, the court may compare the percentage of minorities or women in the <i>employer's work force</i> with the percentage in the area labor market or general population.\" (emphasis added)); <i>Higgins,</i> 823 F.2d at 356-57 (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, until today, two findings were required to satisfy this first factor: (1) the present existence of a manifest imbalance in a particular job category in the <i>employer's workforce;</i> and (2) that this imbalance stems from <i>historical segregation</i> in that job category. Those separate requirements guaranteed two critical things: First, with respect to the <i>scope</i> of the program, they guaranteed that there was a particular goal in sight&#8212;namely, representation of the historically disadvantaged group in the <i>employer's</i> workforce in proportion to its representation in the relevant labor pool. <i>Johnson,</i> 480 U.S. at 631-32, 633 n. 10, 107 S.Ct. 1442; <i>Weber,</i> 443 U.S. at 198-99, 208-09, 99 S.Ct. 2721. By requiring a goal based on the employer's own practices, <i>Weber</i> and <i>Johnson</i> were willing to permit affirmative action programs without giving all employers license to discriminate in favor of any group that currently finds itself disadvantaged anywhere in the labor market. Second, those requirements ensured that there was a <i>temporal</i> constraint, a well-defined point after which the preference program would no longer be necessary&#8212;that is, once the \"manifest imbalance\" in the employer's workforce had been corrected. <i>Johnson,</i> 480 U.S. at 632, 107 S.Ct. 1442 (\"The requirement that `the manifest imbalance' relate to a `traditionally segregated job category' provides assurance both that sex or race will be taken into account in a manner consistent with Title VII's purpose of eliminating the effects of employment discrimination, and that the interests of those employees not benefiting from the plan will not be unduly infringed.\"); <i>Weber,</i> 443 U.S. at 208-09, 99 S.Ct. 2721 (\"[T]he plan is a temporary measure; it is not intended to maintain racial balance, but simply to eliminate a manifest racial imbalance. Preferential selection of craft trainees at the Gramercy plant will end as soon as the percentage of black skilled craftworkers in the Gramercy plant approximates the percentage of blacks in the local labor force.\"). Moreover, an affirmative action program that correlates to an employer's own internal practices is necessarily limited in scope and time, because correcting the \"manifest imbalance\" is reasonably within the employer's control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to <i>Weber</i> and <i>Johnson,</i> the majority's test merely requires a private school to \"demonstrate that specific, significant imbalances in educational achievement presently affect the target population\" in the relevant community.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> Maj. Op. at 842. Thus, by completely eliminating any school-based analysis and jettisoning any historical inquiry,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a> the majority rejects the constraint developed in the Title VII context that affirmative action programs must be limited in scope and duration. Indeed, the majority effectively green-lights discrimination so long as the identified group currently suffers from \"significant imbalances in educational achievement.\" <i>Id.</i> at 844. Because such a <i>broad</i> and <i>perpetual</i> license conflicts with the Supreme Court's consistent emphasis on the <i>limited</i> and <i>temporary</i> nature of permissible affirmative action plans, <i>see, e.g., Sheet Metal Workers' Int'l Ass'n v. EEOC,</i> 478 U.S. 421, 475-79, 106 S.Ct. 3019, 92 L.Ed.2d 344 (1986), I cannot endorse the majority's new standard. <i>See also, e.g., Grutter v.

Thus, under the majority's new standard, we must not consider the rights of a non-preferred individual at the institution in question but in the larger context of his ability to access quality education. <i>See id.</i> at 842. Again, as indicated above, that standard conflicts with the established principle that we look at the particular institution adopting the affirmative action program to determine whether the rights of a member of the disfavored group have been trammeled. <i>See, e.g., Johnson,</i> 480 U.S. at 638, 107 S.Ct. 1442 (\"[W]hile petitioner in this case was denied a promotion, he retained his employment with the Agency, at the same salary and with the same seniority, and remained eligible for other promotions.\"); <i>id.</i> at 638 n. 15, 107 S.Ct. 1442 (\"Of the 111 new Skilled Craft jobs [at the Agency] during [the relevant] period, 105, or almost 95%, went to men.\"); <i>id.</i> at 642, 107 S.Ct. 1442 (\"The decision to [hire Joyce instead of the plaintiff] was made pursuant to an affirmative action plan that represents a moderate, flexible, case-by-case approach to effecting a gradual improvement in the representation of minorities and women <i>in the Agency's work force.</i>\" (emphasis added)); <i>Weber,</i> 443 U.S. at 208, 99 S.Ct. 2721 (\"The plan does not require the discharge of white workers and their replacement with new black hirees.

Yet that is the essence of the majority's new standard: If the majority thinks there are adequate educational alternatives for the disfavored race, then the fact that the institution in question has discriminated against that race is of no concern. \"Context\" alone cannot explain why, under the majority's view, racial discrimination in some communities would be wrong and actionable, but in other communities, it would be acceptable and praiseworthy.

Op. at 844-45 (holding that because \"nothing in the record suggests that educational opportunities in Hawaii are deficient for <i>students, like Plaintiff, who lack any native Hawaiian ancestry,</i>\" Kamehameha's admissions \"policy neither unnecessarily trammels the rights of non-Native Hawaiians nor absolutely bars their advancement in the relevant community.\" (emphasis added)); <i>id.</i> at 844-45 (holding that because \"[non-Native Hawaiian] <i>students</i> denied admission by Kamehameha Schools[, as \"statistical data\" demonstrates,] have ample and adequate alternative educational options,\" Kamehameha's admissions policy does not unnecessarily trammel rights or create an absolute bar (emphasis added)). That standard, however, conflicts with both the plain meaning of &#167; 1981 and the basic premise that civil rights laws are \"design[ed] to protect <i>individuals</i> of all races,\" <i>McDonald v.

In <i>Shelley,</i> the Supreme Court rejected the argument that because courts could enforce racially restrictive covenants equally against both whites and African Americans, enforcing a racially restrictive covenant against African Americans in that case did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. <i>Id.</i> at 21-22, 68 S.Ct. 836. In so holding, <i>Shelley</i> reasoned that because \"[t]he rights created by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment are, by its terms, guaranteed to the individual . . . [i]t is . . . no answer to . . . say that the courts may also be induced to deny white persons rights of ownership and occupancy on grounds of race or color.\" <i>Id.</i> at 22, 68 S.Ct. 836. Indeed, \"[e]qual protection of the laws is not achieved through indiscriminate imposition of inequalities.\" <i>Id.</i> Contrary to <i>Shelley,</i> the majority holds that equality <i>can</i> be achieved \"through indiscriminate imposition of inequalities.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p179\">\n      <span class=\"num\">179</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As there is no reason to depart from the plain meaning of &#167; 1981 or the framework espoused in <i>Shelley,</i> I would follow Supreme Court precedent by considering the rights of individuals, not of groups.

Attaining a Balance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p180\">\n      <span class=\"num\">180</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the majority reworks the third <i>Weber</i> and <i>Johnson</i> factor, which requires that an affirmative action plan be \"intended to <i>attain</i> a balanced work force, not to maintain one.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 480 U.S. at 639, 107 S.Ct. 1442; <i>accord Weber,</i> 443 U.S. at 208, 99 S.Ct. 2721 (holding an affirmative action \"plan [should be] a temporary measure[,] . . . not intended to maintain racial balance, but simply to eliminate a manifest racial imbalance\"). Though the Supreme Court has not required that <i>all</i> affirmative action programs contain an explicit end date, <i>Johnson</i> also holds that, \"Express assurance that a program is only temporary may be necessary if the program actually sets aside positions according to specific numbers.\" 480 U.S. at 639-40, 107 S.Ct. 1442. Indeed, in such cases, a sunset provision is \"necessary both to minimize the effect of the program on other employees, and to ensure that the plan's goals `[are] not being used simply to achieve and maintain . . . balance.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 640, 107 S.Ct. 1442 (quoting <i>Sheet Metal Workers,</i> 478 U.S. at 477-78, 106 S.Ct. 3019); <i>accord Taxman v.

Op. at 842; <i>accord id.</i> at 845. Proclaiming that \"[a]n explicit or immediately foreseeable end date has never been required for an affirmative action plan to be valid,\" Maj. Op. at 846, however, the majority completely ignores <i>Johnson's</i> suggestion that even a <i>partial preference</i> should be checked by an <i>explicit</i> sunset provision, by holding that Kamehameha's <i>absolute preference</i> need not contain a sunset provision at all, <i>see</i> Maj. Op. at 845 (holding that Kamehameha may use race as an exclusive admissions factor \"so long as is necessary to remedy the current educational effects of past, private, and government-sponsored discrimination and of social and economic deprivation\"); <i>id.</i> at 843 (\"The goal [of Kamehameha's admissions policy] is to bring Native Hawaiian students into educational parity with other ethnic groups in Hawaii.\"); <i>see also id.</i> at 845 (noting that in the last \"118 years, the Schools' admissions policy . . . has remained constant\"). The majority thus not only rejects <i>Johnson</i> but also the Court's admonishment that \"race-conscious admissions policies . . . however compelling their goals, are potentially so dangerous that they . . . must have reasonable durational limits.\" <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 342, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted); <i>accord id.</i> (\"The requirement that all race-conscious admissions programs have a termination point assure[s] all citizens that the deviation from the norm of equal treatment of all racial and ethnic groups is a temporary matter, a measure taken in the service of the goal of equality itself.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Far from placing a durational limit on Kamehameha's use of race as a dispositive admissions factor, the majority actually sanctions the use of race in perpetuity. For example, since few, if any, private parties will be able to correct \"significant imbalances in educational achievement\" in the entire \"target population\" through their own individual action, the majority's standard effectively issues private schools a license to engage in perpetual racial discrimination. Because such a limitless use of race in determining admissions contravenes precedent, the majority's retooling of <i>Johnson</i> and <i>Weber's</i> third factor is also unsound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Applying the Majority's Standard to Kamehameha</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if I were to agree with the majority's modifications to the Supreme Court's Title VII standard, I could not agree with its application of that standard in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

The majority's modifications&#8212;eliminating any focus on the schools' own population and any reliance on historical practices&#8212;relieves Kamehameha of the burden of demonstrating its policy is limited in scope and duration. For the reasons I explain in the next two sections, Kamehameha's affirmative action program fails both inquiries. Nevertheless, under the majority's modest thesis, Kamehameha's admissions policy arguably survives the first revised factor because it is clear that Native Hawaiians suffer from significant imbalances in educational achievement relative to <i>most</i> other ethnic groups in Hawaii.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

Op. at 844. The majority holds that Kamehameha does not run afoul of this prong because: (1) \"[t]he history of Native Hawaiians and of Kamehameha Schools has certain unique features that Congress has acknowledged\"; (2) \"nothing in the record suggests that educational opportunities in Hawaii are deficient for [non-Native Hawaiian] students\"; (3) non-Native Hawaiians have no \"legitimate, firmly rooted expectation of admission to the Schools\"; and (4) \"Kamehameha allows all students to apply for admission,\" though \"once the applications are received, the Schools consider the ethnic background of the students and admit qualified children with Native Hawaiian ancestry before admitting children with no such ancestry.\" Maj. Op. at 844-45. None of these explanations is sufficient to justify Kamehameha's admissions policy even under the revised standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, the majority's first finding is irrelevant. The mere fact that \"Congress admitted that the United States was responsible, in part, for the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy\" and that Congress has recognized \"the challenge faced by Native Hawaiians in the educational arena\" and has urged Kamehameha to \"redouble its efforts to educate <i>Native Hawaiian</i> children,\" Maj. Op. at 845 (quoting H.R. REP. No. 107-63(I), at 333 (2001)), says absolutely nothing about whether Kamehameha's policy unnecessarily trammels rights or creates an absolute bar. Moreover, the statements the majority relies on also say nothing about whether Congress has ever been aware of Kamehameha's no non-Native Hawaiians policy, let alone endorsed it. Indeed, it is unreasonable to conclude, as the majority does, that by briefly endorsing the schools' larger educational goals in a committee report that does not even accompany a piece of legislation, Congress intended to sanction the requirements of an otherwise infirm affirmative action plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's second finding&#8212;that non-Native Hawaiians have other educational opportunities&#8212;also fails to justify the majority's holding that Kamehameha's admissions policy does not create an absolute bar or trammel the rights of the non-preferred race. In fact, as I have previously discussed, at pp. 863-66, <i>supra,</i> I believe that considering non-Native Hawaiians' alternatives in this way is unsound under prevailing civil rights case law. But even neglecting that fact, such reliance is particularly problematic here. Kamehameha has an illustrious network of alumni and a record of success that exceeds that of any other school in Hawaii. The tremendous trust corpus of the Bishop Foundation enables Kamehameha to offer this excellent education at a severely discounted price; as the majority notes, the cost of educating each student approaches $20,000 annually, but tuition at Kamehameha is less than 10% of this figure, and most students receive financial aid. <i>See</i> Maj. Op. at 831-32. No other school in Hawaii offers the same benefits at such low cost. Thus, the majority's second justification flies in the face of logic and cannot justify the majority's holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p191\">\n      <span class=\"num\">191</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find the majority's next finding&#8212;that because for the last \"118 years, the Schools' admissions policy . . . has remained constant,\" non-Native Hawaiians have no \"legitimate, firmly rooted expectation of admission to the Schools,\" Maj. Op. at 845 (citation omitted)&#8212;to be unavailing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1\" id=\"fn9-1_ref\">9</a> In other words, according to the majority, because non-Native Hawaiians have been discriminated against on the basis of their race for a long time, they have no cause of action under &#167; 1981. This view is contrary to history and logic. Perhaps more than any other enactments in our history, the Fourteenth Amendment and the civil rights acts unsettled the expectations of an entire nation accustomed to judging people by their race. Surely the schools in <i>Runyon</i> would have found no defense by arguing that their exclusionary policies were open and notorious and that African-American students had \"no expectation of admission to the Schools.\" Maj. Op. at 845. Advising non-Native Hawaiians that they have no possibility of admission to Kamehameha may settle their expectations, but it does not&#8212;for that reason&#8212;make the policy lawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the majority's final justification for holding that Kamehameha's admissions policy does not unnecessarily trammel rights or create an absolute bar is absolutely wrong. The majority begins by noting that \"[t]he Kamehameha Schools allow all students to apply for admission. But once the applications are received, the Schools consider the ethnic background of the students and admit qualified children with Native Hawaiian ancestry before admitting children with no such ancestry.\" Maj. Op. at 844; <i>accord id.</i> at 845-46 (noting, \"<i>if</i> qualified students with Native Hawaiian ancestry do not apply to the School in sufficient numbers to fill the spots available, as happened in one recent year, the Schools' policy is to open admissions to any qualified candidate.\" (footnote omitted) (emphasis added)). The majority then notes, in a bit of an understatement, that, \"[b]ecause the pool of qualified potential students with Native Hawaiian blood greatly outnumbers the available slots at the Schools, non-Native Hawaiians generally are not admitted.\" <i>Id.</i> at 844. Highlighting the understated nature of its conclusion, the majority then proceeds to drop a footnote explaining that its euphemistic phrase \"generally are not admitted\" means that, <i>from 1962 until 2002, Kamehameha admitted exactly one student who was not of Native Hawaiian descent. Id.</i> at 844 n.10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceeding as if its statement that Kamehameha generally does not admit non-Native Hawaiians proves that Kamehameha's policy is not an absolute bar, the majority entirely neglects to mention the circumstances surrounding the admission of that lone non-Native Hawaiian student. Because those circumstances speak volumes about Kamehameha's policy, however, they deserve an extended discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1962, Kamehameha reversed its previous policy of allowing the children of faculty members to attend. Thereafter, the school did not admit a single non-Native Hawaiian student until 2002, when it admitted one non-Native Hawaiian student to its Maui campus. In response to a firestorm of protests following that decision, Kamehameha's trustees repeatedly apologized to the Native Hawaiian community, stated that the \"situation\" had \"brought the problems with the admissions process into sharp focus,\" Members of Trs. of Kamehameha Sch., <i>Kamehameha's Policy Will Remain,</i> HONOLULU ADVERTISER, July 27, 2002, and acknowledged that they had \"screwed up major,\" Rick Daysog, <i>Angry Ohana Grills Trustees,</i> HONOLULU STAR-BULLETIN, July 16, 2002. \"As a result,\" the trustees \"pledged to . . . carefully review [Kamehameha's] admissions process,\" Members of Bd. of Trs. of Kamehameha Sch., <i>supra,</i> presumably to prevent such a \"situation\" from happening again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Far from an empty promise, Kamehameha promptly made several significant changes to its admission practices. First, it created the Ho'oulu Hawaiian Data Center to develop a Native Hawaiian registry and certify the Hawaiian ancestry of the schools' applicants; to be considered under the school's preference policy, an applicant's ancestry must now be verified by the data center.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10-1\" id=\"fn10-1_ref\">10</a> Second, Kamehameha temporarily waived application fees for its Maui and Big Island campuses in order to induce more Native Hawaiians to apply for admission. Third, Kamehameha further increased the number of Native Hawaiians applying to its Big Island campus by allowing certain students, who had previously only been eligible for admission to its main campus in O'ahu, to apply for admission at the Big Island campus.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-1\" id=\"fn11-1_ref\">11</a> Fourth, Kamehameha also ceased its preliminary screening for O'ahu and Big Island applicants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And fifth, Kamehameha ceased using a minimum scoring threshold to evaluate applicants. Since 1989, Kamehameha had required applicants to achieve a minimum composite score on an admissions test in order to be deemed \"qualified applicants.\" Vicki Viotti, <i>Kamehameha Standards Debated,</i> HONOLULU ADVERTISER, Nov. 17, 2003, at 1B. Though that test was hardly an impediment to the school's preference policy&#8212;as 2002 marked the first time in four decades that the school had space to admit a non-Native Hawaiian student&#8212;it did at least provide an objective way to measure the number of qualified Native Hawaiian applicants. By eliminating that test, however, Kamehameha did away with that objective measure, while leaving in place \"Kamehameha Schools' admissions policy . . . to give preference to applicants of Hawaiian ancestry to the extent permitted by law.\" Kamehameha Schools Admissions Office, Main Page, http://www.ksbe.edu/ admissions/mainpage.html (last visited Sep. 7, 2006). Thus, because that policy provides no objective guidance whatsoever, Kamehameha's decision leaves it free to restrict admission solely to Native Hawaiian children, and as the trustees promised, Kamehameha need never admit a non-Native Hawaiian applicant again. This description is not meant to criticize Kamehameha's noble mission to help Native Hawaiians receive a quality education, but only to demonstrate that its current policy&#8212;contrary to the majority's creative characterization&#8212;does pose an absolute bar to the admittance of any non-Native Hawaiian students. And, such bar violates section 1981.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

Op. at 845. To hold that Kamehameha's admissions policy survives this factor, the majority asserts that Kamehameha's policy is both flexible and limited. <i>Id.</i> at 845-46. As for the former, the majority finds that Kamehameha's admissions policy \"does not do more than is necessary\" because that \"policy is not fixed but changes as the capacity of the Schools' programs increases and as the well-being of the Native Hawaiian community rises.\" Maj. Op. at 845. The majority fails to provide any support for that conclusion, and that lack of support is far from surprising given that, as demonstrated above, Kamehameha has only made its race based admissions program more rigid, <i>see supra</i> at pp. 870-71.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also finds that Kamehameha's admissions policy is \"limited in duration\" by the fact that \"if qualified students with Native Hawaiian ancestry do not apply to the School in sufficient numbers to fill the spots available, as happened in one recent year, the Schools' policy is to open admissions to any qualified candidate\" and the admissions policy will end when \"the current educational effects of past, private and government-sponsored discrimination and of social and economic deprivation\" end. Maj. Op. at 845 (footnote omitted). Because, as the majority candidly concedes, \"there are many more qualified students of Hawaiian ancestry than there are available places at the Schools,\" <i>id.</i> at 832, and Kamehemeha altered its admissions criteria in response to what \"happened in one recent year,\" <i>id.</i> at 845, it is unclear whether Kamehameha will ever admit another non-Native Hawaiian student, <i>let alone end its racially exclusive admissions policy.</i> I cannot understand how Kamehameha's policy can reasonably be described as \"limited in duration.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Kamehameha's own trustees put it, \"[Our policy] must remain [in place] until Hawaiians are leading in scholastic achievement, until they are underrepresented in prisons and homeless shelters, until their well-being is restored.\" Trs. of Kamehameha Sch., <i>Kamehameha Schools' Policy Advocates Social Justice,</i> HONOLULU ADVERTISER, Aug. 24, 2003.

CONGRESSIONAL EXEMPTION OF KAMEHAMEHA FROM &#167; 1981</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an additional justification for its decision, the majority asserts that Kamehameha's policy does not violate &#167; 1981 because Congress implicitly exempted racial preferences for Native Hawaiians from &#167; 1981's coverage. The majority, joined to some extent by Judge Fletcher's concurrence, accomplishes this with three premises: First, the majority reasons that because &#167; 1981 was enacted in 1870, prior to the acquisition of Hawaii, \"Congress could not have had any conscious intention as to how [&#167; 1981] would apply in Hawaii.\" Maj. Op. at 847. Second, \"Congress reenacted &#167; 1981 in 1991.\" <i>Id.</i> at 849. Third, \"Congress has passed [legislation] specifically affecting Native Hawaiians both before and after 1991,\" and to read these acts \"consistently with the revised version of &#167; 1981,\" we must read an exemption for Native Hawaiians into &#167; 1981. <i>Id.</i> at 847-48. Indeed, according to the majority, this is \"the most plausible reading of &#167; 1981.\" <i>Id.</i> at 849.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of the majority's premises is either demonstrably wrong or utterly irrelevant. First, the majority's claim that \"Congress could not have had any conscious intention as to how [&#167; 1981] would apply in Hawaii\" is just plain wrong. Maj. Op. at 847. As the majority observes, when Congress first enacted &#167; 1981 as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1870, the Hawaiian Islands were still a sovereign kingdom whose people remained outside the jurisdiction of the United States. The United States did not annex Hawaii until the 1890s. <i>See</i> Maj. Op. at 831, 847. It is clear, then, that Congress could not have <i>initially</i> intended either to cover or to exempt Native Hawaiians from &#167; 1981's provisions. But nothing more can be gleaned from this fact. The majority reads a different point into this history: That we do not know how Congress intended &#167; 1981 to apply in Hawaii. This is nonsensical and flies in the face of, among other things, &#167; 1981 itself, the Hawaiian Statehood Act, the equal footing doctrine, and the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hawaii and its citizens have been subject to &#167; 1981 since Hawaii became a territory because &#167; 1981 applies to \"[a]ll persons with the jurisdiction of the United States,\" including \"every State and Territory.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981(a) (2000). Congress reaffirmed this when Hawaii became a state in 1959 and joined the Union with all of the privileges and duties of all of the other states, that is, on an \"equal footing,\" as if it had joined the Union at its founding. <i>See Alaska v. United States,</i> 545 U.S. 75, 125 S.Ct. 2137, 2143, 125 S.Ct. 2137, 162 L.Ed.2d 57 (2005); <i>United States v. Texas,</i> 339 U.S. 707, 716-20, 70 S.Ct. 918, 94 L.Ed. 1221 (1950). As a new state, Hawaii and its citizens became subject to all laws of the United States, including &#167; 1981. <i>See</i> U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 2 (\"The Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby....\"). This was made express in the Hawaiian Statehood Act, which provided that \"the laws of the United States shall have the same force and effect within [Hawaii] as elsewhere within the United States.\" Pub.L. No. 86-3, &#167; 15, 73 Stat. 11 (1959). <i>See also Calkin v. Cocke,</i> 55 U.S. 227, 235-36, 14 How. 227, 14 L.Ed. 398 (1852); <i>Benner v. Porter,</i> 50 U.S. 235, 243, 9 How. 235, 13 L.Ed. 119 (1850). In other words, &#167; 1981 has long applied in Hawaii and on exactly the same terms as it applies elsewhere within the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, building from its first faulty premise, the majority insists that &#167; 1981 was \"reenacted\" in 1991. <i>See</i> Maj. Op. at 847 (\"The 1991 amendments are . . . the only[ ] time since Hawaii became a state that Congress has <i>reenacted</i> &#167; 1981.\" (emphasis added); <i>id.</i> at 847 (\"Congress . . . reenacted &#167; 1981 in 1991.\"); <i>id.</i> at 847-48 (\". . . the pre-1991 statutory landscape . . . informs us about what Congress had in mind when it reenacted &#167; 1981\"); <i>id.</i> at 849 (\". . .

Rather, &#167; 1981 was <i>amended</i> in 1991 by <i>adding</i> two provisions; not one word of &#167; 1981's original text was touched by those amendments. Indeed, every word that Congress wrote in 1870 and that was codified in 1874-and was there in 1898 when Hawaii was annexed and in 1959 when Hawaii became a state&#8212;is still there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p208\">\n      <span class=\"num\">208</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, Congress amended &#167; 1981 in two respects: It codified the Court's holding in <i>Runyon</i> that &#167; 1981 applies to discrimination by private actors, <i>see</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981(c), and it statutorily overruled the Court's holding in <i>Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,</i> 491 U.S. 164, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989), that &#167; 1981 does not extend to post-contract-formation conduct, such as the imposition of discriminatory working conditions, <i>see</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> <i>See also Jones v.

The majority does not argue that either of those amendments exempted Native Hawaiians, and the 1991 Amendments did not alter subsection (a) (except to add the \"(a)\" and the heading), which continues to state that the protections of &#167; 1981 apply to \"[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States.\" There is absolutely no indication in the 1991 amendments or their legislative history that Congress intended to exempt racial preferences for Native Hawaiians from &#167; 1981's broad coverage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14-1\" id=\"fn14-1_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p209\">\n      <span class=\"num\">209</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the majority points to a variety of other statutes that Congress passed before and after 1991 which favor Native Hawaiians. <i>See</i> Maj. Op. at 847-49; <i>see also</i> Conc. Op. at 853-55. It is beyond dispute that Congress has enacted numerous statutes providing separate benefit programs for Native Hawaiians, but nothing in those acts says anything about &#167; 1981, much less exempts Native Hawaiians from its coverage. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Hawaiian Homes Commission Act &#167; 1 <i>et seq.,</i> 42 Stat. 108 (1920) (setting aside approximately 200,000 acres and establishing a program of loans and long-term leases for the benefit of Native Hawaiians); Department of Defense Appropriations Act, Pub.L.

Take, for example, the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments which both the majority and the concurrence point to as evidence that Congress approved and exempted Kamehameha's admissions policy. Maj. Op. at 848-49; Conc. Op. at 854. Those Amendments direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \"make grants to the Kamehameha Schools/Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate for a demonstration program to provide Higher Education fellowship assistance to Native Hawaiian students.\" Pub.L. No. 100-297, tit. IV, &#167; 4005(a), 102 Stat. 360 (1988). A directive to give Kamehameha a grant for a demonstration program does not create an exemption from generally applicable civil rights laws.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Furthermore, nothing in Stafford-Hawkins would be inconsistent with enforcement of &#167; 1981 in this case. In fact, it could not be since Congress repealed the demonstration grant program before the sunset provision took effect, Pub.L. No. 103-382, tit. III, &#167; 363, 108 Stat. 3975 (1994), and a current version of the act <i>only</i> mentions Kamehameha in the findings of fact. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 7512(16) (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p211\">\n      <span class=\"num\">211</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Fletcher goes a step farther than the majority, arguing that the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments and the Public Health Service Act \"specifically directed Kamehameha Schools to do precisely what plaintiffs in this case say is forbidden by &#167; 1981.\" Conc. Op. at 854. I cannot see how \"`mak[ing] grants to [Kamehameha] for a demonstration program to provide Higher Education fellowship assistance to Native Hawaiian students'\" or \"`provid[ing] funds to [Kamehameha] for the purpose of providing scholarship assistance' to eligible Native Hawaiian students\" constitutes a specific instruction from Congress to Kamehameha to apply a racially exclusive admissions policy. <i>See</i> Conc. Op. at 854 (quoting Pub.L. No. 100-297, tit. IV, &#167; 4005(a), 102 Stat. at 360 (formerly codified at 20 U.S.C. &#167; 4905(a)) (repealed 1994) and citing Act of Nov. 29, 1990, Pub.L. No. 101-644, &#167; 401, 104 Stat. 4662, 4668 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 254s)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16-1\" id=\"fn16-1_ref\">16</a> Judge Fletcher's conclusion is especially baffling because Congress never even mentioned Kamehameha's admissions policy in either piece of legislation, including the legislative history; in fact, there is nothing in the congressional materials to even suggest that Congress <i>knew</i> that Kamehameha's admissions policy was racially exclusive, let alone that Congress <i>endorsed</i> it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p212\">\n      <span class=\"num\">212</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the majority points to a House committee report that \"favorably mentioned the Bishop Trust and exhorted the Schools to `redouble [their] efforts to provide for Native Hawaiians.'\" Maj. Op. at 849 (quoting H.R. REP. No. 107-63(I), at 333). A committee report, however, says nothing about how Congress as a whole views Kamehameha's admission policy. This particular report is of no legislative value whatsoever because it does not even accompany an act; in other words, the committee's resolution does not even aspire to be legislative history. Furthermore, a committee's mere exhortation that Kamehameha should \"redouble[its] efforts to provide for Native Hawaiians,\" <i>id.,</i> does not, as the majority's reasoning would have it, equal legislation, duly enacted, that \"Kamehameha may continue to provide for Native Hawaiians, in violation of existing civil rights laws, if necessary.\" In fact, there is absolutely no evidence that either house of Congress, or even any subset of its membership, knew about&#8212;let alone approved of&#8212;Kamehameha's absolute ban on non-Native Hawaiian students. Thus, the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments and the House committee report do not operate as some kind of estoppel against applying generally applicable civil rights laws to Native Hawaiians generally or to Kamehameha in particular.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p213\">\n      <span class=\"num\">213</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, from this thin record, the majority concludes that \"the most plausible\" way to harmonize these acts with the \"reenactment\" of &#167; 1981 is to infer that \"Congress intended that a preference for Native Hawaiians, in Hawaii, by a Native Hawaiian organization, located on the Hawaiian monarchy's ancestral lands, be upheld.\" Maj. Op. at 849. Mere recitation of the conclusion should remind us of Justice Jackson's \"restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only.\" <i>Smith v. Allwright,</i> 321 U.S. 649, 669, 64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987 (1944) (Jackson, J., dissenting). In any event, there is no need to harmonize these statutes because there is no inconsistency. A straightforward reading of &#167; 1981 does not render any other legislation non-sensical, void, or superfluous. The fact that Congress has passed some measures promoting Native Hawaiian education says nothing about whether Congress intended to exempt Native Hawaiian schools from &#167; 1981; there is no legislative conflict to reconcile.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> <i>See Morton v. Mancari,</i> 417 U.S. 535, 551, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974) (\"The courts are not at liberty to pick and choose among congressional enactments, and when two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p214\">\n      <span class=\"num\">214</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, the majority's reasoning reaches far beyond Kamehameha, and in finding that Native Hawaiians preferences are exempt from &#167; 1981, the majority holds that by amending that statute in 1991, Congress narrowed the scope of one of our oldest and most enduring civil rights statutes. <i>See</i> Maj. Op. at 847-49 (using the enactments outlined above to \"interpret[] the scope of &#167; 1981\"). Moreover, the majority's focus on what Congress may have been <i>thinking</i> ignores what Congress actually <i>did:</i> It passed &#167; 1981, a non-discrimination law of general applicability. Section 1981, on its face, clearly does not create any exemptions for Native Hawaiians; thus, whether or not Congress <i>meant</i> to create such an exemption&#8212;and again, there is absolutely no indication that it intended to do so&#8212;it certainly did not <i>create</i> such an exception. <i>Cf. Williams v. Babbitt,</i> 115 F.3d 657, 660 (9th Cir.1997) (\"Congress may well have thought that, by passing the [Reindeer Industry] Act, it was effectively precluding anyone other than natives from entering the reindeer business. Nevertheless, nothing in the Act actually prohibits non-natives from entering the Reindeer business ....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p215\">\n      <span class=\"num\">215</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To my mind, the disparate statutes favoring Native Hawaiians that the majority relies on demonstrate a different point altogether: That when Congress wishes to give Native Hawaiians special treatment, it knows how to do so&#8212;and it is not shy about it. <i>Cf. Malabed v. N. Slope Borough,</i> 335 F.3d 864, 872 (9th Cir.2003) (\"The existence of express preference programs created by Congress supports our conclusion.... [T]hey show that when Congress wants to authorize or require Native [American] hiring preferences, it knows how to do so.\"); <i>Dawavendewa v. Salt River Project Agric. Improvement &amp; Power Dist.,</i> 154 F.3d 1117, 1123 (9th Cir. 1998) (\"The fact that Congress now requires a narrowly defined set of contracts to honor local tribal preference policies not only fails to support the argument that it intended to accomplish that same objective in 1964 when passing Title VII, but it suggests quite the opposite proposition. It shows us that when Congress wishes to allow tribal preferences, it adopts an appropriate amendment to the applicable statute.\"); <i>Williams,</i> 115 F.3d at 661 (\"[T]he total and perpetual exclusion of a majority of the population ... from a particular enterprise is the kind of significant feature we would normally expect Congress to spell out if that were its intent.\"). Nothing in the statutory language or legislative history of &#167; 1981 even hints that Congress wanted to exempt Native Hawaiian preferences from its provisions.

However, Judge Fletcher arrives at this result via a slightly different route: First, he reasons that Native Hawaiian status is <i>both</i> a political <i>and</i> a racial classification. Conc. Op. at 850. He then suggests that, under the \"special relationship\" doctrine, Congress has given Native Hawaiians special benefits based on their <i>political</i> status. <i>Id.</i> at 856-57. From that, Judge Fletcher then postulates that because Congress has given Native Hawaiians special benefits, it could not have intended to prohibit private parties from doing the exact same thing. <i>Id.</i> at 852. Thus, according to the concurrence, &#167; 1981, which prohibits <i>racial</i> preferences in private contracts, must be read to exempt preferences on behalf of Native Hawaiians. <i>Id.</i> at 856-57.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p218\">\n      <span class=\"num\">218</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish his beginning premises, Judge Fletcher must rely on <i>Morton v. Mancari,</i> 417 U.S. 535, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974), which created the \"special relationship\" doctrine. In <i>Mancari,</i> the Supreme Court held that the Bureau of Indian Affairs's (\"BIA\") hiring preference for Native Americans did not constitute racial discrimination. 417 U.S. at 553-54, 94 S.Ct. 2474. Instead, the Court wrote that the preference was \"not directed towards a `racial' group consisting of `Indians'; instead, it applies only to members of `federally recognized' tribes.\" <i>Id.</i> at 553 n. 24, 94 S.Ct. 2474. The Court concluded that this preference was therefore not a <i>racial</i> preference at all, but instead a <i>political</i> preference, and applied rational basis scrutiny. <i>Id.</i> Judge Fletcher would conclude that, under <i>Mancari,</i> Congress has the power to exempt private parties' racial preferences in favor of Native Hawaiians from the purview of &#167; 1981. Conc. Op. at 853.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p219\">\n      <span class=\"num\">219</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before discussing the merits of the concurrence's reasoning, I note that Kamehameha did not make this argument on appeal, and it was not briefed by either party. Kamehameha did argue, as the majority concludes, that preferences in favor of Native Hawaiians are exempt from &#167; 1981; however, it did not base its argument on the special trust doctrine espoused in <i>Mancari.</i> In fact, Kamehameha's brief does not even cite <i>Mancari.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> Because arguments not made in a party's appellate brief are waived, <i>see Blanford v. Sacramento County,</i> 406 F.3d 1110, 1114 n. 8 (9th Cir.2005); <i>Paladin Assocs., Inc. v. Mont. Power Co.,</i> 328 F.3d 1145, 1164 (9th Cir.2003), it is improper for the court to even consider the argument raised by Judge Fletcher.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p220\">\n      <span class=\"num\">220</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, turning to the merits, Judge Fletcher's argument puts more weight on <i>Mancari</i> than it can bear. As I explain in greater detail below, the exception in <i>Mancari</i> is an exceedingly narrow one, limited to preferences that are political not racial. Second, <i>Mancari's</i> special relationship works only in those cases where Congress has formally recognized the sovereignty of Native American tribes. Despite opportunity to do so, Congress has never formally recognized the sovereignty of Native Hawaiians. Third, even if Congress had recognized Native Hawaiians as a sovereign body, the special relationship doctrine applies only to preferences by the federal government or by the tribes themselves. It does not apply to private parties discriminating on the basis of tribal status; indeed, we have been quite clear that such private racial discrimination remains illegal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p221\">\n      <span class=\"num\">221</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Judge Fletcher agrees with the majority that \"`Native Hawaiians' ... is a racial classification.\" Conc. Op. at 850; <i>see</i> Maj. Op. at 837 n. 9. But Judge Fletcher goes one step further, suggesting that \"`Native Hawaiians' is not merely a racial classification,\" but \"also a political classification.\" <i>Id.</i> at 850-51. If Judge Fletcher is correct, this case, from the outset, does not come within the special relationship doctrine of <i>Morton v. Mancari</i> because <i>Mancari</i> denied the very premise from which the concurring opinion proceeds. For instance, <i>Mancari</i> held that the BIA's Native American hiring preference \"does not constitute `racial discrimination.'\" 417 U.S. at 553, 94 S.Ct. 2474. \"Indeed, it is not even a `racial' preference.\" <i>Id.</i> As the Court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p222\">\n      <span class=\"num\">222</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The preference, as applied, is granted to Indians not as a discrete racial group, but, rather, as members of quasi-sovereign tribal entities whose lives and activities are governed by the BIA in a unique fashion. In the sense that there is no other group of people favored in this manner, the legal status of the BIA is truly <i>sui generis.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p223\">\n      <span class=\"num\">223</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">417 U.S. at 554, 94 S.Ct. 2474 (citation omitted). Moreover, in concluding that the preference was political and not racial, the Court relied on the fact that the beneficiaries were members of federally recognized tribes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p224\">\n      <span class=\"num\">224</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The preference is not directed towards a `racial' group consisting of `Indians'; instead, it applies only to members of `federally recognized tribes.' This operates to exclude many individuals who are racially to be classified as `Indians.' In this sense, the preference is political rather than racial in nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p225\">\n      <span class=\"num\">225</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 553 n. 24, 94 S.Ct. 2474 (internal quotation marks omitted). As the Supreme Court explained in <i>Rice v. Cayetano,</i> \"[a]lthough the classification [in <i>Mancari</i>] had a racial component, the Court found it important that the preference was not directed towards a racial group consisting of Indians, but rather only to members of federally recognized tribes. In this sense, the Court held, the preference was political rather than racial in nature.\" 528 U.S. 495, 519-20, 120 S.Ct. 1044, 145 L.Ed.2d 1007 (2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p226\">\n      <span class=\"num\">226</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Judge Fletcher agrees that, whatever else Kamehameha's admissions policy may be, it is a racial classification. This fact places Kamehameha's policy outside the scope of <i>Mancari's</i> holding. The distinction is critical, because if a preference for Native Hawaiians were <i>only</i> political and <i>not</i> racial, then &#167; 1981, by its own terms, would not apply. No exemption from &#167; 1981 would be necessary. <i>See Sagana v. Tenorio,</i> 384 F.3d 731, 738 (9th Cir.2004) (\"[T]he guarantee that `all persons' may enjoy the same rights that `white citizens' enjoy does not protect against discrimination on the basis of ... political affiliation.\"); <i>Keating v. Carey,</i> 706 F.2d 377, 384 (2d Cir.1983) (\"In light of the Court's interpretation, the legislative history, and the express language of the statute, we hold that &#167; 1981, however generously construed, does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of political affiliation.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p227\">\n      <span class=\"num\">227</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, <i>Mancari</i> was premised on actual federal recognition of Native American tribes. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 417 U.S. at 542, 94 S.Ct. 2474 (emphasizing the BIA's control over the \"lives and destinies of the <i>federally recognized Indian tribes</i>\") (emphasis added); <i>id.</i> at 551, 94 S.Ct. 2474 (\"Resolution of the instant issue turns on the unique legal status of Indian tribes under federal law and upon the plenary power of Congress, based on a history of treaties and the assumption of a `guardian-ward' status, to legislate on behalf of <i>federally recognized Indian tribes.</i>\") (emphasis added); <i>id.</i> at 553 n. 24, 94 S.Ct. 2474 (\"The preference is not directed towards a `racial' group consisting of `Indians'; instead, it applies only to members of <i>`federally recognized' tribes.</i>\") (emphasis added); <i>see also Rice,</i> 528 U.S. at 519-20, 120 S.Ct. 1044.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p228\">\n      <span class=\"num\">228</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Native Hawaiians have never been accorded formal recognition as a Native American tribe,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> and while the \"special trust relationship\" between Congress and Native Hawaiians bears many similarities to the relationship between Congress and Native American tribes, the two relationships are not identical. And, as we recently acknowledged, \"absent federal recognition, tribes do not enjoy the same status, rights, and privileges accorded federally recognized tribes.\" <i>Kahawaiolaa v. Norton,</i> 386 F.3d 1271, 1273 n. 1 (9th Cir. 2004). In fact, Congress has passed many statutes benefitting Native American tribes that do not include Native Hawaiians, or which distinguish them from Native American tribes. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, 25 U.S.C. &#167; 450 et seq. (2000) (defining an \"Indian\" as \"a person who is a member of [a federally recognized] Indian tribe\"); 25 U.S.C. &#167; 3001(9), (10) (2000) (defining Native American as \"of, or relating to, a tribe, people, or culture that is indigenous to the United States\" and Native Hawaiian, by contrast, as \"any individual who is a descendant of the aboriginal people who, prior to 1778, occupied and exercised sovereignty in the area that now constitutes the State of Hawaii.\"); <i>see also Kahawaiolaa,</i> 386 F.3d at 1282 (\"[F]ederal benefits and entitlements for native Hawaiians [are] different from [those] afforded federally recognized Indian tribes ....\"); <i>id.</i> (\"Congress, because of the unique history of Hawaii, has excluded [Native Hawaiians] from some statutes ....\"); <i>id.</i> (\"[M]any statutes distinguish between native Hawaiians and members of Indian tribes.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p229\">\n      <span class=\"num\">229</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot usurp Congress's power to grant or not grant formal recognition to Native Hawaiians by simply declaring that the \"comparable\" status of Native Hawaiians, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 7512(12)(D), gives them tribal status. Congress has created a discrete process for recognizing Indian tribes as tribes. <i>See</i> Indian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. &#167; 461 <i>et seq.; see also</i> 25 C.F.R. &#167; 83.1 <i>et seq.</i> (1994) (Department of Interior regulations). Formal recognition as a tribe comes with a bundle of privileges, including self-government, tribal courts, control of Indian lands, and the power to tax. <i>See, e.g., Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe,</i> 455 U.S. 130, 102 S.Ct. 894, 71 L.Ed.2d 21 (1982); <i>Montana v. United States,</i> 450 U.S. 544, 101 S.Ct. 1245, 67 L.Ed.2d 493 (1981); <i>Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez,</i> 436 U.S. 49, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978). None of these privileges have yet been afforded to Native Hawaiians, a judgment we recently upheld in <i>Kahawaiolaa v. Norton.</i> As we concluded there, \"in the end, we must commit this question to Congress to apply its wisdom in deciding whether or not native Hawaiians should be included among those eligible to apply for federal tribal recognition.\" 386 F.3d at 1283.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p230\">\n      <span class=\"num\">230</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even if Congress had formally recognized Native Hawaiians, <i>Mancari's</i> special status doctrine would still not benefit Kamehameha because that doctrine does not apply to private parties. <i>Mancari</i> approved a Native American hiring preference adopted by the BIA because of the tribes' capacity as \"quasi-sovereign[s].\" <i>Mancari,</i> 417 U.S. at 554, 94 S.Ct. 2474; <i>see also Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante,</i> 480 U.S. 9, 14, 107 S.Ct. 971, 94 L.Ed.2d 10 (1987); <i>Fisher v. Dist. Ct.,</i> 424 U.S. 382, 390-91, 96 S.Ct. 943, 47 L.Ed.2d 106 (1976). The \"special relationship\" recognized in <i>Mancari</i> was a sovereign-to-sovereign relationship that Congress has the power to regulate by virtue of the Indian Commerce Clause, U.S. CONST. art. I, &#167; 8, cl. 3, and the Treaty Clause, <i>id.</i> art. II, &#167; 2, cl. 2, which \"has often been the source of the Government's power to deal with the Indian tribes.\" <i>Mancari,</i> 417 U.S. at 552, 94 S.Ct. 2474; <i>see also United States v. Lara,</i> 541 U.S. 193, 200, 124 S.Ct. 1628, 158 L.Ed.2d 420 (2004). Thus, private parties may not seek refuge in <i>Mancari's</i> special relationship doctrine. Kamehameha&#8212;despite the strong loyalty of Native Hawaiians&#8212;is a private school established by a private trust, and not a recognized means of Native Hawaiian self-government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p231\">\n      <span class=\"num\">231</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Fletcher's concurrence misses this point entirely when it asserts that \"Congress may, if it wishes, permit Kamehameha Schools to give preferential admission treatment to Native Hawaiians.\" Conc. Op. at 853.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> Judge Fletcher does not cite a single case where a court has upheld a private preference for Native American tribal members under the special relationship doctrine. In fact, we have soundly rejected exactly that argument. In <i>Dawavendewa v. Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District,</i> 154 F.3d 1117 (9th Cir.1998), pursuant to an agreement with the Navajo Tribe, an Arizona corporation sought to discriminate in employment by favoring members of the Navajo Tribe. Dawavendewa, a member of the Hopi Tribe, filed a Title VII claim alleging national origin discrimination. The defendants argued that, based on <i>Mancari,</i> \"preferences based on tribal affiliation are based on <i>political affiliation</i> rather than national origin and are thus outside the realm of Title VII.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1120. Citing \"the unique interest the [BIA] had in employing Native Americans,\" that had led the Court to recognize a limited exception for Congress, we held that the plaintiff had alleged a violation of Title VII. <i>Id.</i> at 1120.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p232\">\n      <span class=\"num\">232</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have even rejected attempts to extend <i>Mancari's</i> exception to other <i>governmental</i> entities. In <i>Malabed v. North Slope Borough,</i> 335 F.3d 864 (9th Cir. 2003), a local government adopted an ordinance that gave an employment preference to Native Americans, defined as members of federally recognized Indian tribes. Plaintiffs challenged the ordinance under the equal protection guarantee of the Alaska Constitution. The Borough attempted to justify its ordinance by relying on <i>Mancari.</i> Citing <i>Rice,</i> we limited <i>Mancari's</i> political exception to Congress's dealings with federally recognized Native American tribes and invalidated the ordinance. <i>See id.</i> at 865 n. 5 (\"<i>Mancari</i> held only that when <i>Congress</i> acts to fulfill its unique trust responsibilities toward Indian tribes, such legislation is not based on a suspect classification.\" (emphasis added)). Other courts have taken a similar approach. <i>See, e.g., Tafoya v. City of Albuquerque,</i> 751 F.Supp. 1527, 1530 (D.N.M.1990) (\"As the Supreme Court so clearly stated in <i>Morton,</i> Congress' obligations to Indians are constitutionally based and unique. The City of Albuquerque does not have comparable power to treat members of federally recognized Indian tribes or pueblos or members of the Navajo Nation differently than other groups of Indians or non-Indians.\"); <i>id.</i> at 1531 (\"The Albuquerque City Council has considerably less power than the United States Congress to pass law discriminating in favor of members of federally recognized Indian tribes and pueblos. In this respect, the rationale in <i>Morton</i> is inapplicable to this case.\"); <i>see also Rice,</i> 528 U.S. at 520, 522, 120 S.Ct. 1044 (refusing to extend <i>Mancari</i> to state elections privileging Native Hawaiians; \"the elections for OHA trustee are elections of the State, not a separate quasi sovereign\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p233\">\n      <span class=\"num\">233</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mancari</i> may not even extend to Native American preferences in hiring by other federal agencies. The Court's holding in <i>Mancari</i> relied on the fact that \"the preference applies only to employment in the Indian service,\" an agency that the Court described as \"sui generis.\" 417 U.S. at 554, 94 S.Ct. 2474. The Court specifically did not \"consider the obviously more difficult question that would be presented by a blanket exemption for Indians from all civil service examinations.\" <i>Id.; see also Rice,</i> 528 U.S. at 520, 120 S.Ct. 1044 (noting \"that [<i>Mancari</i>] was confined to the authority of the BIA, an agency described as `sui generis'\"); <i>Dawavendewa,</i> 154 F.3d at 1120 (similar). We have previously limited the scope of <i>Mancari</i> in this fashion. In <i>Williams v. Babbitt,</i> 115 F.3d 657 (9th Cir.1997), for example, we considered whether the Reindeer Industry Act limited ownership of reindeer to Native Alaskans and whether such a limitation would be constitutional. The Act's defenders attempted to justify it under the Court's holding in <i>Mancari.</i> We rejected this argument, holding that the power granted Congress under <i>Mancari's</i> exception was of a far narrower scope. <i>See id.</i> at 664 (\"The preference at issue in <i>Mancari</i> only applied to the BIA, an agency created for the purpose of serving Indians.\"); <i>id.</i> at 664-65 (\"[W]e can discern <i>Mancari's</i> scope by looking to the cases it cited as examples of permissible special treatment for Indians. Each case dealt with life in the immediate vicinity of Indian land.\" (citations omitted)); <i>id.</i> at 655 (\"While <i>Mancari</i> is not necessarily limited to statutes that give special treatment to Indians on Indian land, we do read it as shielding only those statutes that affect uniquely Indian interests.\"); <i>id.</i> (\"[W]e seriously doubt that Congress could give Indians a complete monopoly on the casino industry or on Space Shuttle contracts.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p234\">\n      <span class=\"num\">234</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, <i>Mancari</i> does not support Judge Fletcher's claim that Kamehameha's admissions policy is justified because it is both a racial and political classification. Judge Fletcher's rationale would render <i>Mancari</i> unrecognizable. Indeed, as with the exclusive Native Hawaiian voting scheme rejected by the Supreme Court in <i>Rice,</i> if Kamehameha's racially exclusive admissions policy \"were to be sustained under <i>Mancari</i> we would be required to accept some beginning premises not yet established in our case law.... These propositions would raise questions of considerable moment and difficulty.\" 528 U.S. at 518, 120 S.Ct. 1044.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p235\">\n      <span class=\"num\">235</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noble as Kamehameha's goals may be, I cannot reconcile its admissions preference&#8212;a racially exclusive policy that operates as a complete bar to all applicants who are not of the preferred race&#8212;with the Supreme Court's requirements for a valid affirmative action plan. I cannot reconcile Kamehameha's admissions policy with the plain commands of &#167; 1981, nor can I find any evidence whatsoever that Congress exempted Kamehameha from &#167; 1981 altogether. The majority exempts an organization with noble goals that seeks to remedy a significant problem in a community that is in great need, but it can do so only because the majority departs from clear principles and established precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p236\">\n      <span class=\"num\">236</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-2_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>Rudebusch</i> did not include the requirement that the \"manifest imbalance\" be present in a job category that was traditionally segregated in its statement of the Title VII test. <i>See</i> 313 F.3d at 520. However, all of the cases we cited in <i>Rudebusch</i> to support the manifest imbalance factor included the traditional segregated job category requirement in their statement of the test. <i>See Johnson,</i> 480 U.S. at 631, 107 S.Ct. 1442; <i>Weber,</i> 443 U.S. at 204, 99 S.Ct. 2721; <i>Higgins v. City of Vallejo,</i> 823 F.2d 351, 356 (9th Cir.1987). <i>Rudebusch</i> gives no indication that it intentionally excluded this aspect of the requirement, and the defendant did not argue that this requirement had not been met. Thus, I do not believe that <i>Rudebusch</i> loosened the requirement that a job category must be traditionally segregated before an affirmative action plan is permissible.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We have considered the validity of affirmative action plans in a wide variety of contexts, and we have always applied the same Title VII standard<i>See, e.g., Officers for Justice v.

Op. at 854. It is true that Congress made clear in what is now 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981(c) that &#167; 1981(a) applies to private entities. But in enacting that provision, Congress merely codified the Court's holding in<i>Runyon</i> that &#167; 1981 reached private conduct under the Thirteenth Amendment. <i>See Runyon,</i> 427 U.S. at 168 n. 8, 96 S.Ct. 2586; <i>see also Jones v.

We never questioned, post-<i>Runyon</i> and pre-1991, that &#167; 1981 reached private conduct. <i>See, e.g., Evans v.

It is easy to generate examples which clearly illustrate this: Before 2003, professors at the University of Michigan received numerous federal grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, but this did not indicate that either Congress or the President believed Michigan's admissions policy was constitutional; indeed, the Department of Justice filed amicus briefs in<i>Gratz</i> and <i>Grutter</i> arguing just the opposite. Similarly, no one would argue that Congress, by granting federal aid or favorable tax treatment to certain corporations (such as Texaco), intended to grant those corporations exemptions from federal antidiscrimination laws, <i>cf. Smith v. Texaco, Inc.,</i> 281 F.3d 477 (5th Cir.2002). Nor would anyone argue that Congress, by allocating funds to state or local police departments, somehow evinces an intent to exempt such departments from the purview of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.

I disagree with the characterization of these cases. The first case, <i>John,</i> for example, did not even involve a <i>Mancari</i> issue but concerned whether certain lands constituted \"Indian country\" for purpose of the Major Crimes Act. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1151; <i>see also John,</i> 437 U.S. at 635, 647-50, 98 S.Ct. 2541.

Similarly, Judge Fletcher's reliance on <i>Weeks</i> is misplaced. In <i>Weeks,</i> the Supreme Court rejected an Equal Protection Clause challenge to Congress's decision not to include the descendants of members of a recognized tribe who had voluntarily renounced their status in exchange for United States citizenship from a compensation scheme that benefitted the descendants of tribal members who had renounced their tribal status. The opinion cites <i>Mancari,</i> but not for reasons important to the holding of either case. <i>See</i> 430 U.S. at 84, 85, 97 S.Ct. 911. Neither <i>John</i> nor <i>Weeks</i> modified <i>Mancari's</i> holding, either explicitly or implicitly.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> Judge Fletcher has it backwards. He cites the same body of laws&#8212;the collection of different preferences for Native Hawaiians&#8212;as evidence that Congress both implicitly created a special relationship with Native Hawaiians<i>and</i> implicitly exempted them from &#167; 1981. But Judge Fletcher's analogy to Native Americans is flawed: Congress has <i>expressly</i> created a special relationship with Native Americans by formally recognizing the tribes.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This makes a difference. The Tenth and Eleventh Circuits have held that Native American tribal entities <i>are</i> implicitly exempt from some suits under &#167; 1981. But those courts reasoned that because tribes are <i>expressly</i> exempted from disparate impact suits under Title VII, <i>see</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e(b); <i>id.</i> &#167; 2000e-2, plaintiffs may not circumvent Title VII's exemption by suing under &#167; 1981. <i>See Taylor v.

Unlike the tribes, Native Hawaiians are not expressly exempted from Title VII, although there may be reason to wonder whether the majority's opinion implicitly exempts them.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p237\">\n      <span class=\"num\">237</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RYMER, Circuit Judge, with whom KOZINSKI, O'SCANNLAIN, TALLMAN and CALLAHAN, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p238\">\n      <span class=\"num\">238</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is altogether infelicitous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p239\">\n      <span class=\"num\">239</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the one hand, the Kamehameha Schools is a well-recognized, widely-acclaimed private school, established before Hawaii became a state, whose primary mission has been to educate Native Hawaiian students in a culturally sensitive, challenging way. It receives no federal funds and does not operate for profit. Its purpose of providing meaningful access to educational opportunity is intuitively salutary.

Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co.,</i> 427 U.S. 273, 96 S.Ct. 2574, 49 L.Ed.2d 493 (1976), and more recently, that Native Hawaiian ancestry can be a proxy for race, <i>Rice v.

Finally, because education is the greatest inheritance of all, I have difficulty understanding what business it is of the federal government to tell a Native Hawaiian that she can't choose to help other Native Hawaiians whom she believes particularly need it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p242\">\n      <span class=\"num\">242</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This said, I am not persuaded that precedent allows the Kamehameha Schools to justify its preferential admissions policy on the footing that the policy redresses past societal discrimination against Native Hawaiians. The majority and dissenting opinions agree that we are guided by Title VII standards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-2\" id=\"fn4-2_ref\">4</a> I agree with Judge Bybee that when, as here, a voluntary, private, affirmative action plan is at issue, the test is whether it eliminates a manifest racial imbalance, does not unnecessarily trammel the rights of non-preferred groups or create an absolute bar to their advancement, and makes adjustments that do no more than necessary to obtain a racial balance. <i>United Steelworkers of America v. Weber,</i> 443 U.S. 193, 208-09, 99 S.Ct. 2721, 61 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979); <i>see Rudebusch v.

Thus, the articulated justification for its race-based admissions policy is to remedy <i>external</i> discrimination, not <i>internal</i> imbalance. Even if a private educational enterprise has more wiggle room in defining its core mission in a race-conscious way than a private employer, to legitimate a race-based policy solely on account of discrimination <i>by others</i> is to put no bounds on it at all. To do so would render meaningless the factors that influenced the Supreme Court in <i>Weber</i> to approve a voluntary, private, affirmative action plan. 443 U.S. at 208-09, 99 S.Ct. 2721. A private entity's progress toward achieving \"balance\" cannot realistically be assessed if measured against society as a whole rather than its own work force or its own student body. But, even if a private party should be able to assume a public responsibility for remediation of past societal discrimination, the acceptable goal of a race-conscious admissions policy for a public educational institution is to achieve a diverse student body. <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 325, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (endorsing the view that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in public university admissions). The purpose of Kamehameha Schools and its admissions policy is, of course, just the opposite.

I don't believe section 1981 would apply at all if the schools were run entirely as a philanthropic enterprise and allowed students to attend for free. In <i>Runyon,</i> \"the racial exclusion practiced by the [schools] amount[ed] to a classic violation of &#167; 1981,\" because \"[t]he parents ... sought to enter into contractual relationships with [the schools] for educational services.\" 427 U.S. at 172, 96 S.Ct. 2586. The Court emphasized the commercial nature of the relationship: \"Under those contractual relationships, the schools would have received payments for services rendered, and the prospective students would have received instruction in return for those payments.\" <i>Id.</i> I have found no case where section 1981 has been applied to a charity. Were the schools to forego charging tuition, their relationship to their students would probably not be deemed \"contractual\" as that term is used in section 1981 and <i>Runyon.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p257\">\n      <span class=\"num\">257</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Being able to charge tuition is, of course, not inconsequential. For most private schools it is a make-or-break proposition. But it may not be so for the Kamehameha Schools, which were set up primarily as eleemosynary institutions. The tuition they charge reflects only a small fraction of their operating costs and, even then, most students pay a reduced tuition, or no tuition at all. <i>See</i> maj. op. at 831-32. The schools' substantial endowment may enable them to continue operating without charging any tuition for a very long time&#8212; perhaps indefinitely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p258\">\n      <span class=\"num\">258</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the scores of pages we have written on both sides of this issue, it should be clear that the question is close and ours may not be the last word. Given the passions this case has aroused, <i>see</i> maj. op. at 835 n. 6, it's worth noting that what's really at stake may not be the operation of the Kamehameha Schools along their traditional (preferential) model, but merely a few million dollars a year the schools now get from their own students.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Cobey Black &amp; Kathleen Mellen, <i>Princess Pauahi Bishop and Her Legacy</i> 155 (The Kamehameha Schools Press 1965). Charles Bishop wrote to the trustees: \"Mrs. Bishop intended that, in the advantages of her beneficence, those of her race should have preference.\" <i>Id.</i> Accordingly, he concluded that the principal of the Schools was justified in refusing to admit a student who had no native Hawaiian ancestry. <i>Id.</i> Bishop went on to convey that only if Native Hawaiians failed to apply to the Schools, or if conditions changed fundamentally, should admissions be opened to other ethnicities: \"It was wise to prepare for and to admit natives only and I do not think the time has come to depart from that rule.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Today, the Kamehameha Schools operate three K-12 campuses: Kapalama on the island of Oahu, Pukalani on the island of Maui, and Keaau on the island of Hawaii. There are about 70,000 school-aged children in Hawaii who meet the Schools' definition of Native Hawaiian, but the Schools' total enrollment is only about 4,856 students. The Kamehameha Schools subsidize much of the tuition cost for all students, requiring payment of only $1,784 per year, whereas the cost of educating a student amounts to about $20,000 annually. Sixty-five percent of those enrolled receive some form of financial aid to help them pay even that heavily subsidized, modest tuition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Part of the Kamehameha Schools' stated admissions policy is to give preference to students of Native Hawaiian ancestry, defined to include any person descended from the aboriginal people who exercised sovereignty in the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778. Practically, the policy operates to admit students without any Hawaiian ancestry only after all qualified applicants with such ancestry have been admitted. Because there are many more qualified students of Hawaiian ancestry than there are available places at the Schools, it is very rare that a student with no Hawaiian ancestry is admitted to the campus programs. But the admissions policy is not an absolute bar to non-Native Hawaiians; instead, it is intended to last only for so long as Native Hawaiians suffer educational disadvantages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We pause to note that the Schools' policy contains no requirement for a minimum blood quantum of Hawaiian ancestry. The only requirement is that a student have at least one Native Hawaiian ancestor. Most students have mixed ancestry. More than 60 different racial and ethnic groups have been represented in the student body, and for the 2000-2001 academic year, students reported belonging to 39 different racial and ethnic groups. Accordingly, an observer visiting the Schools would see visible diversity notwithstanding the students' commonality of having at least one Native Hawaiian ancestor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Kamehameha Schools follow a \"Leadership Model\" of education. This curriculum is meant to foster the self-esteem and self-identity of students as individuals of Native Hawaiian descent by teaching Native Hawaiian culture, heritage, language, and tradition, in addition to general college-preparatory courses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kamehameha Schools also operate a number of other educational programs, including pre-schools, enrichment programs, and summer school programs. In those programs, the admission of non-Native Hawaiians occurs more often. For example, for the 2001-2002 school year, 13 children with no Native Hawaiian ancestry were admitted to Kamehameha's pre-school program (two of the children declined admission); the following school year 12 non-Native Hawaiian children were admitted to the pre-school; and the year after that&#8212;the 2003-2004 school year&#8212;16 students without Native Hawaiian ancestry were admitted. And, in the summer of 2003, for instance, non-Native Hawaiians were enrolled in several of the enrichment programs run by the Kamehameha Schools: 6 of 133 students in the Performing Arts Academy; 33 of 1,741 students in Explorations; 5 of 18 students in Culinary Arts; and 4 of 164 students in Hoolauna Keauhou.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Current Conditions in the Educational Status of Native Hawaiians</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Kamehameha Schools are partly responsible for the Native Hawaiian community's ability to maintain \"its distinct character as an aboriginal, native people,\" Native Hawaiians, nonetheless, continue to face \"economic deprivation, low educational attainment, poor health status, substandard housing and social dislocation.\" <i>From Mauka to Makai</i> at 2.

By contrast, ensuring that significantly underachieving minority groups are included fully as tomorrow's citizens, leaders, and workers necessarily focuses <i>externally.</i> Considering this important difference, we conclude that we should use a standard for evaluating remedial racial preferences by wholly private primary and secondary schools that is akin to that used in Title VII employment cases, but that takes into account the inherently broad and societal focus of the educational endeavor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adjusting the first <i>Johnson</i> factor to account for this external focus, we hold that, to justify a remedial racial preference, a private school must demonstrate that specific, significant imbalances in educational achievement presently affect the target population. The external focus of the educational mission renders unnecessary the requirement of proof of a \"manifest imbalance\" <i>within</i> a particular school; the relevant population is the community as a whole. At the same time, the strict focus on present, demonstrable disparities in educational achievement limits the types of permissible programs and distinguishes a more amorphous program that relies solely on general past societal discrimination. <i>See City of Richmond v.

Just as imbalance should be viewed in the relevant community, rather than in a single school, so should the respective rights of members of the non-preferred group. Therefore, within the community as a whole, an admissions policy must not \"unnecessarily trammel\" the rights of students in the non-preferred class or \"create an absolute bar\" to their advancement. The third <i>Johnson</i> factor is similarly modified: an admissions policy must do no more than is necessary to remedy the imbalance in the community as a whole, that we identified at the first step. These three factors best harmonize the relevant statutes and Supreme Court cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Bybee's reliance on <i>Runyon</i> in attacking our conclusion is particularly misplaced. As his dissent quotes several times, diss. at 857, 858, 860, the Supreme Court in <i>Runyon</i> held that private primary schools in Virginia that categorically denied admission to African-American applicants represented a \"classic violation of &#167; 1981.\" <i>Runyon,</i> 427 U.S. at 172, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109509\"><a href=\"/opinion/109509/runyon-v-mccrary/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Quite simply, <i>Runyon</i> is inapposite: The program at issue in <i>Runyon</i> would certainly fail the first step of our analysis because specific, significant imbalances did not exist <i>favoring</i> African-Americans. To the contrary, specific, significant imbalances did exist <i>disfavoring</i> African-Americans. The Civil Rights Act was passed specifically with the plight of African-Americans in mind. It is therefore unsurprising that the Court labeled a whites-only admissions policy a \"classic violation of &#167; 1981.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, the very nature of affirmative action plans is that historically disfavored and underachieving minorities may be given preferential treatment in certain narrowly defined, limited programs. It is the contours of such a program&#8212;a private school's voluntary remedial admissions program&#8212;that we explore today. We turn now to applying the three modified <i>Johnson</i> factors to the Kamehameha Schools' admissions policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Respond to a Manifest Imbalance</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To meet the first modified <i>Johnson</i> factor, a private school must demonstrate that, in the relevant community, specific, significant imbalances in educational achievement presently affect the group favored by its admissions policy. The relevant community in this case is the state of Hawaii, because the Schools serve students from all of Hawaii's islands. We therefore consider whether a manifest imbalance in current educational achievement exists between Native Hawaiians and other ethnic groups in Hawaii.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Native Hawaiian students are systemically disadvantaged in the classroom. As we described earlier, there is a substantial disparity in performance between Native Hawaiian students and other ethnic groups. Briefly, Native Hawaiian students score lower on standardized tests than all other ethnic groups in the state, Ka Huakai at 229, 261, are more likely to be in special education classes, <i>id.</i> at 278, are more likely to be absent from school, <i>id.</i> at 229, and are more likely to attend poor-quality schools, <i>id.</i> at 252. Native Hawaiians are the least likely of the state's major ethnic groups to graduate from high school, <i>id.</i> at 229, 285, and they are less likely than their non-Hawaiian counterparts to attend college, <i>id.</i> at 118-19. Congress has expressly recognized the educational disadvantages suffered by Native Hawaiians and their marginalized status. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 7512.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of those facts and congressional findings, it is clear that a manifest imbalance exists in the K-12 educational arena in the state of Hawaii, with Native Hawaiians falling at the bottom of the spectrum in almost all areas of educational progress and success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, it is precisely this manifest imbalance that the Kamehameha Schools' admissions policy seeks to address. The goal is to bring Native Hawaiian students into educational parity with other ethnic groups in Hawaii.

The Schools have pinpointed areas in which Native Hawaiians, in particular, are severely disadvantaged and have developed a curriculum to attend to those needs. The Schools have instituted a \"Leadership Model\" of education, meant to \"restore self-identity, integrate Native Hawaiian culture, heritage, language, and traditions into the educational process, and provide a first-rate educational experience for Native Hawaiians.\" The Schools' efforts are aimed at increasing scores on standardized tests, increasing the number of Native Hawaiians attending colleges and graduate schools, improving Native Hawaiian representation in professional, academic, and managerial positions, and developing community leaders who are committed to improving the lives of all Native Hawaiians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Kamehameha Schools recognized, early on, a critical need to help perpetuate Native Hawaiian culture.

But once the applications are received, the Schools consider the ethnic background of the students and admit qualified children with Native Hawaiian ancestry before admitting children with no such ancestry. Because the pool of qualified potential students with Native Hawaiian blood greatly outnumbers the available slots at the Schools, non-Native Hawaiians generally are not admitted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> For the reasons that follow, however, the Schools' admissions policy does not unnecessarily trammel the rights of non-Native Hawaiians or create an absolute bar to their advancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that nothing in the record suggests that educational opportunities in Hawaii are deficient for students, like Plaintiff, who lack any Native Hawaiian ancestry. To the contrary, the same statistical data that portray the difficulties of Native Hawaiian children generally portray much greater educational achievement, in both public and private primary and secondary schools, for children of all other racial and ethnic groups in Hawaii. Those students denied admission by Kamehameha Schools have ample and adequate alternative educational options. The well-documented ability of non-Native Hawaiians to attain educational achievement in Hawaii notwithstanding the Kamehameha Schools' longstanding admissions policy demonstrates that the policy neither unnecessarily trammels the rights of non-Native Hawaiians nor absolutely bars their advancement in the relevant community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our inquiry does not stop there, however. The history of Native Hawaiians and of the Kamehameha Schools has certain unique features that Congress has acknowledged. In 1993, Congress admitted that the United States was responsible, in part, for the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. 1993 Apology Resolution, 107 Stat. 1510. Later, when it enacted education-related legislation in 1994, and then reenacted that legislation in 2002, Congress made findings regarding the disadvantages faced by Native Hawaiian students in the public school system in Hawaii. 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 7901-7941, 7512(16). As part of the 2002 reenactment, a congressional committee even urged the Bishop Trust, which operates the Kamehameha Schools, to \"redouble its efforts to educate <i>Native Hawaiian</i> children.\" H.R.Rep. No. 107-63(I), at 333 (2001) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congressional recognition of the challenges faced by Native Hawaiians in the educational arena supports our conclusion that the Schools' policy does not unnecessarily trammel the rights of non-Native Hawaiians. To the contrary, as Congress has recognized, in the unique context of Native Hawaiian history, affirmative measures are needed to address present, severe inequalities in educational achievement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we examine the expectations of those who lack Native Hawaiian ancestry. The Supreme Court observed in <i>Johnson</i> that \"the denial of the promotion[at issue] unsettled no legitimate, firmly rooted expectation on the part of petitioner.\" 480 U.S. at 638, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111846\"><a href=\"/opinion/111846/johnson-v-transportation-agency-santa-clara-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

First, if qualified students with Native Hawaiian ancestry do not apply to the Schools in sufficient numbers to fill the spots available, as happened in one recent year, <i>see supra</i> note 10, the Schools' policy is to open admissions to any qualified candidate. Second, preference will be given to students with Native Hawaiian ancestry only for so long as is necessary to remedy the current educational effects of past, private and government-sponsored discrimination and of social and economic deprivation.

Over the years, Congress has reaffirmed the unique relationship that the United States has with Hawaii, as a result of the American involvement in the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 7512(12), (13) (Native Hawaiian Education Act, 2002); 42 U.S.C. &#167; 11701(13), (14), (19), (20) (Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress has relied on the special relationship that the United States has with Native Hawaiians to provide specifically for their welfare in a number of different contexts.

In 1988, just three years before reenacting &#167; 1981, Congress passed the Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988. 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 4901-4909 (1988) (repealed 1994) (hereinafter \"Hawkins-Stafford Amendments\"). Congress made extensive findings, similar to the findings that it later made in 2002, <i>see supra</i> pp. 833-34, about the educational needs of Native Hawaiians and recognized the necessity for \"special efforts in education recognizing the unique cultural and historical circumstances of Native Hawaiians.\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 4901(9) (1988) (repealed 1994). For instance, Congress concluded that it has the power to \"specially legislate for the benefit of Native Hawaiians,\" encouraged Native Hawaiians to play an active role in planning and managing Native Hawaiian educational programs, and noted that Native Hawaiians disproportionally fell below their peers in terms of educational achievement and progress. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4901(2) (1988) (repealed 1994). Congress then went on to affirm specifically the mission of Kamehameha Schools and the Schools' model elementary curriculum, <i>approving by name</i> the Schools' continued research and assessment activities. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4904(a) (1988) (repealed 1994). Similarly, Congress directed the Secretary of Education to make grants to the Schools \"for a demonstration program to provide Higher Education fellowship assistance to Native Hawaiian students.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4905(a) (1988) (repealed 1994). The sole recipients of that assistance were to be \"Native Hawaiians,\" a term that was defined in the statute, as it is by Kamehameha Schools, as \"a descendant of the aboriginal people, who prior to 1778, occupied and exercised sovereignty in the area that now comprises the State of Hawaii.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4909(1)(C) (1988) (repealed 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hawkins-Stafford Amendments were repealed in 1994. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 4901 (1991) (repealed 1994). But for two reasons that fact does not alter the landscape of Native Hawaiian-oriented congressional enactments against which &#167; 1981 must be read. First, when Congress reenacted &#167; 1981 in 1991, the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments were still in effect.

Like the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments, the NHEA recognized the special needs of Native Hawaiian students and the great disadvantages that they still face in Hawaii. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 7512. As part of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, a congressional committee favorably mentioned the Bishop Trust and exhorted the Schools to \"redouble [their] efforts\" to provide for Native Hawaiians.

It would be incongruous to conclude that while Congress was repeatedly enacting remedial measures aimed exclusively at Native Hawaiians, at the same time Congress would reject such Native Hawaiian preferences through &#167; 1981. Moreover, by reenacting &#167; 1981 in the midst of passing other legislation to provide specifically and particularly for the education of Native Hawaiians, Congress signaled its clear support for the Kamehameha Schools and for the validity of the Schools' admissions policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the most plausible reading of &#167; 1981, in light of the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments and the NHEA, is that Congress intended that a preference for Native Hawaiians, in Hawaii, by a Native Hawaiian organization, located on the Hawaiian monarchy's ancestral lands, be upheld because it furthers the urgent need for better education of Native Hawaiians, which Congress has repeatedly identified as necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">King Kamehameha I, on his death bed, is reported to have said, \"Tell my people I have planted in the soil of our land the roots of a plan for their happiness.\" <i>Princess Pauahi Bishop and Her Legacy</i> at 122.

Because the Schools are a wholly private K-12 educational establishment, whose preferential admissions policy is designed to counteract the significant, current educational deficits of Native Hawaiian children in Hawaii, and because in 1991 Congress clearly intended &#167; 1981 to exist in harmony with its other legislation providing specially for the education of Native Hawaiians, we must conclude that the admissions policy is valid under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>Doe v.

In answering this question, the majority opinion assumes that \"Native Hawaiian is a racial classification.\" Op. at 837 n. 9. Based on this assumption, it holds that &#167; 1981 permits private schools, in certain circumstances, to prefer disadvantaged minority groups&#8212;not limited to Native Hawaiians&#8212;based on race. But the case before us does not involve an admissions policy generally favoring disadvantaged minorities, or favoring specific racial or ethnic groups such as African-Americans or Hispanics. It involves only an admissions policy favoring \"Native Hawaiians,\" defined as persons \"descended from the aboriginal people who exercised sovereignty in the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778.\" Op. at 832.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A narrower ground for sustaining Kamehameha Schools' admissions policy is that \"Native Hawaiian\" is not merely a racial classification. It is also a political classification. I would divide the question in this case into two sub-questions. First, can Congress constitutionally provide special benefits, including educational benefits, to descendants of Native Hawaiians because \"Native Hawaiian\" is a political classification? Second, if the answer to this question is yes, has Congress done so in &#167; 1981?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p>I.

The well established general rule is that less&#8212;not more&#8212;demanding scrutiny applies to private discrimination than to government-sponsored discrimination. It would be deeply ironic for us to hold that &#167; 1981 forbids private institutions from giving Native Hawaiians educational benefits when, at the same time, Congress itself provides such benefits and provides public funds for private organizations to do the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress has invariably treated \"Native Hawaiian\" as a political classification for purposes of providing exclusive educational and other benefits.

Though I agree with the majority that Native Hawaiians suffer from severe socio-economic disadvantages and believe that Kamehameha Schools (\"Kamehameha\") should be commended for attempting to remedy those hardships, I cannot concur with the majority's dramatic departure from <i>Runyon.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, the majority has made a number of crucial mistakes. Thus, as set out below in Part I, even though I agree with the majority that Title VII and not strict scrutiny provides the standard of review in this case, I disagree with the majority's sweeping modification of the Title VII standard. Moreover, even if I agreed with the majority's departure from that standard, I could not subscribe to the majority's decision to sanction an absolute racial bar. Likewise, as set out in Part II, I cannot accept as a matter of faithful statutory construction the majority's view that Congress implicitly exempted racial preferences for Native Hawaiians from &#167; 1981 by passing unrelated&#8212;and even since repealed&#8212;statutes. Indeed, I believe the majority's novel approach to statutory interpretation is readily manipulable and would enable courts to rewrite statutes whenever they want to save a particular program, contract, or enactment. Finally, as set out in Part III, because Native Hawaiians do not constitute a federally recognized tribe and Kamehameha is a private party, I also disagree with Judge Fletcher's suggestion that the special relationship doctrine of <i>Morton v.

Despite the inherent logic of plaintiff's argument, the majority avoids reaching a similar conclusion by holding \"[q]uite simply, <i>Runyon</i> is inapposite,\" Maj.

Instead, the majority converts <i>Runyon</i> into a case about a \"whites-only admissions\" program that is \"inapposite\" to Kamehameha's Native Hawaiians-only admissions policy. <i>Id.</i> I find the majority's decision to dismiss <i>Runyon</i> in order to approve a policy that bars African American (and any other) children who lack Native Hawaiian ancestry to be unfortunate and wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Putting those concerns aside for the moment, and turning to the next step in the majority's analysis, the majority holds that Title VII scrutiny, and not strict scrutiny, applies to alleged &#167; 1981 violations. Maj. Op. at 839. That second step in the majority's analysis is sound. Like the majority, I agree that Title VII standards and not strict scrutiny must apply to &#167; 1981 actions because to hold otherwise would effectively render the Title VII's provisions that expressly contemplate affirmative action plans nonsensical.

Furthermore, I also disagree with the majority's application of its own standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Majority's Modification of the Title VII Standard</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority creates a standard that, by its own terms, applies <i>only</i> to primary and secondary schools. It grounds that decision entirely on its finding that the ordinary Title VII standard, which was developed in the employment setting, cannot apply to primary and secondary educational contracts. But, there is absolutely nothing in &#167; 1981's text to suggest that contracts made with \"private employers [that] strive primarily to make money[ ] and public employers [that] perform a specific public function\" should be subject to a different standard than primary and secondary schools that have \"a much broader [external] mission.\" Maj. Op. at 842. Indeed, the majority neglects the fact that &#167; 1981 guarantees to \"[a]ll persons . . . the same right . . . to make and enforce <i>contracts</i> . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981(a) (emphasis added). Given &#167; 1981's plain text, then, it is not surprising that the majority cannot cite a single case to support the novel proposition that primary and secondary educational contracts are different from other contracts and are entitled to special treatment under &#167; 1981.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the Supreme Court has rejected that very argument. For instance, far from finding that a school's \"much broader mission\" or external focus made a difference, <i>Runyon</i>&#8212;which involved a racially exclusive primary and secondary private school admissions policy&#8212;reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apparent that the racial exclusion practiced by the Fairfax-Brewster School and Bobbe's Private School amounts to a classic violation of &#167; 1981. The parents . . . sought to enter into contractual relationships with [the schools] for educational services . . . . Under those contractual relationships, the schools would have received payments for services rendered, and the prospective students would have received instruction in return for those payments . . . . [N]either school offered services on equal basis to white and nonwhite students. . . . [Plaintiffs] were denied admission to the schools because of their race. The . . . conclusion that &#167; 1981 was thereby violated follows inexorably from the language of that statute, as construed in [prior Supreme Court case law].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">427 U.S. at 172-73, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109509\"><a href=\"/opinion/109509/runyon-v-mccrary/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, the majority's argument that primary and secondary private school educational contracts should be treated differently from other contracts under &#167; 1981 was squarely rejected in <i>Runyon,</i> and I would adhere to that precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the majority's rationale does not find any support in Title VII jurisprudence.

Because such a limitless use of race in determining admissions contravenes precedent, the majority's retooling of <i>Johnson</i> and <i>Weber's</i> third factor is also unsound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Applying the Majority's Standard to Kamehameha</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if I were to agree with the majority's modifications to the Supreme Court's Title VII standard, I could not agree with its application of that standard in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

The majority's modifications&#8212;eliminating any focus on the schools' own population and any reliance on historical practices&#8212;relieves Kamehameha of the burden of demonstrating its policy is limited in scope and duration. For the reasons I explain in the next two sections, Kamehameha's affirmative action program fails both inquiries. Nevertheless, under the majority's modest thesis, Kamehameha's admissions policy arguably survives the first revised factor because it is clear that Native Hawaiians suffer from significant imbalances in educational achievement relative to <i>most</i> other ethnic groups in Hawaii.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

Op. at 844. The majority holds that Kamehameha does not run afoul of this prong because: (1) \"[t]he history of Native Hawaiians and of Kamehameha Schools has certain unique features that Congress has acknowledged\"; (2) \"nothing in the record suggests that educational opportunities in Hawaii are deficient for [non-Native Hawaiian] students\"; (3) non-Native Hawaiians have no \"legitimate, firmly rooted expectation of admission to the Schools\"; and (4) \"Kamehameha allows all students to apply for admission,\" though \"once the applications are received, the Schools consider the ethnic background of the students and admit qualified children with Native Hawaiian ancestry before admitting children with no such ancestry.\" Maj. Op. at 844-45. None of these explanations is sufficient to justify Kamehameha's admissions policy even under the revised standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, the majority's first finding is irrelevant. The mere fact that \"Congress admitted that the United States was responsible, in part, for the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy\" and that Congress has recognized \"the challenge faced by Native Hawaiians in the educational arena\" and has urged Kamehameha to \"redouble its efforts to educate <i>Native Hawaiian</i> children,\" Maj. Op. at 845 (quoting H.R. REP. No. 107-63(I), at 333 (2001)), says absolutely nothing about whether Kamehameha's policy unnecessarily trammels rights or creates an absolute bar. Moreover, the statements the majority relies on also say nothing about whether Congress has ever been aware of Kamehameha's no non-Native Hawaiians policy, let alone endorsed it. Indeed, it is unreasonable to conclude, as the majority does, that by briefly endorsing the schools' larger educational goals in a committee report that does not even accompany a piece of legislation, Congress intended to sanction the requirements of an otherwise infirm affirmative action plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's second finding&#8212;that non-Native Hawaiians have other educational opportunities&#8212;also fails to justify the majority's holding that Kamehameha's admissions policy does not create an absolute bar or trammel the rights of the non-preferred race. In fact, as I have previously discussed, at pp. 863-66, <i>supra,</i> I believe that considering non-Native Hawaiians' alternatives in this way is unsound under prevailing civil rights case law. But even neglecting that fact, such reliance is particularly problematic here. Kamehameha has an illustrious network of alumni and a record of success that exceeds that of any other school in Hawaii. The tremendous trust corpus of the Bishop Foundation enables Kamehameha to offer this excellent education at a severely discounted price; as the majority notes, the cost of educating each student approaches $20,000 annually, but tuition at Kamehameha is less than 10% of this figure, and most students receive financial aid. <i>See</i> Maj. Op. at 831-32. No other school in Hawaii offers the same benefits at such low cost. Thus, the majority's second justification flies in the face of logic and cannot justify the majority's holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p191\">\n      <span class=\"num\">191</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find the majority's next finding&#8212;that because for the last \"118 years, the Schools' admissions policy . . . has remained constant,\" non-Native Hawaiians have no \"legitimate, firmly rooted expectation of admission to the Schools,\" Maj. Op. at 845 (citation omitted)&#8212;to be unavailing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1\" id=\"fn9-1_ref\">9</a> In other words, according to the majority, because non-Native Hawaiians have been discriminated against on the basis of their race for a long time, they have no cause of action under &#167; 1981. This view is contrary to history and logic. Perhaps more than any other enactments in our history, the Fourteenth Amendment and the civil rights acts unsettled the expectations of an entire nation accustomed to judging people by their race. Surely the schools in <i>Runyon</i> would have found no defense by arguing that their exclusionary policies were open and notorious and that African-American students had \"no expectation of admission to the Schools.\" Maj. Op. at 845. Advising non-Native Hawaiians that they have no possibility of admission to Kamehameha may settle their expectations, but it does not&#8212;for that reason&#8212;make the policy lawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the majority's final justification for holding that Kamehameha's admissions policy does not unnecessarily trammel rights or create an absolute bar is absolutely wrong. The majority begins by noting that \"[t]he Kamehameha Schools allow all students to apply for admission. But once the applications are received, the Schools consider the ethnic background of the students and admit qualified children with Native Hawaiian ancestry before admitting children with no such ancestry.\" Maj. Op. at 844; <i>accord id.</i> at 845-46 (noting, \"<i>if</i> qualified students with Native Hawaiian ancestry do not apply to the School in sufficient numbers to fill the spots available, as happened in one recent year, the Schools' policy is to open admissions to any qualified candidate.\" (footnote omitted) (emphasis added)). The majority then notes, in a bit of an understatement, that, \"[b]ecause the pool of qualified potential students with Native Hawaiian blood greatly outnumbers the available slots at the Schools, non-Native Hawaiians generally are not admitted.\" <i>Id.</i> at 844. Highlighting the understated nature of its conclusion, the majority then proceeds to drop a footnote explaining that its euphemistic phrase \"generally are not admitted\" means that, <i>from 1962 until 2002, Kamehameha admitted exactly one student who was not of Native Hawaiian descent. Id.</i> at 844 n.10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceeding as if its statement that Kamehameha generally does not admit non-Native Hawaiians proves that Kamehameha's policy is not an absolute bar, the majority entirely neglects to mention the circumstances surrounding the admission of that lone non-Native Hawaiian student. Because those circumstances speak volumes about Kamehameha's policy, however, they deserve an extended discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1962, Kamehameha reversed its previous policy of allowing the children of faculty members to attend. Thereafter, the school did not admit a single non-Native Hawaiian student until 2002, when it admitted one non-Native Hawaiian student to its Maui campus. In response to a firestorm of protests following that decision, Kamehameha's trustees repeatedly apologized to the Native Hawaiian community, stated that the \"situation\" had \"brought the problems with the admissions process into sharp focus,\" Members of Trs. of Kamehameha Sch., <i>Kamehameha's Policy Will Remain,</i> HONOLULU ADVERTISER, July 27, 2002, and acknowledged that they had \"screwed up major,\" Rick Daysog, <i>Angry Ohana Grills Trustees,</i> HONOLULU STAR-BULLETIN, July 16, 2002. \"As a result,\" the trustees \"pledged to . . . carefully review [Kamehameha's] admissions process,\" Members of Bd. of Trs. of Kamehameha Sch., <i>supra,</i> presumably to prevent such a \"situation\" from happening again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Far from an empty promise, Kamehameha promptly made several significant changes to its admission practices. First, it created the Ho'oulu Hawaiian Data Center to develop a Native Hawaiian registry and certify the Hawaiian ancestry of the schools' applicants; to be considered under the school's preference policy, an applicant's ancestry must now be verified by the data center.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10-1\" id=\"fn10-1_ref\">10</a> Second, Kamehameha temporarily waived application fees for its Maui and Big Island campuses in order to induce more Native Hawaiians to apply for admission. Third, Kamehameha further increased the number of Native Hawaiians applying to its Big Island campus by allowing certain students, who had previously only been eligible for admission to its main campus in O'ahu, to apply for admission at the Big Island campus.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-1\" id=\"fn11-1_ref\">11</a> Fourth, Kamehameha also ceased its preliminary screening for O'ahu and Big Island applicants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And fifth, Kamehameha ceased using a minimum scoring threshold to evaluate applicants. Since 1989, Kamehameha had required applicants to achieve a minimum composite score on an admissions test in order to be deemed \"qualified applicants.\" Vicki Viotti, <i>Kamehameha Standards Debated,</i> HONOLULU ADVERTISER, Nov. 17, 2003, at 1B. Though that test was hardly an impediment to the school's preference policy&#8212;as 2002 marked the first time in four decades that the school had space to admit a non-Native Hawaiian student&#8212;it did at least provide an objective way to measure the number of qualified Native Hawaiian applicants. By eliminating that test, however, Kamehameha did away with that objective measure, while leaving in place \"Kamehameha Schools' admissions policy . . . to give preference to applicants of Hawaiian ancestry to the extent permitted by law.\" Kamehameha Schools Admissions Office, Main Page, http://www.ksbe.edu/ admissions/mainpage.html (last visited Sep. 7, 2006). Thus, because that policy provides no objective guidance whatsoever, Kamehameha's decision leaves it free to restrict admission solely to Native Hawaiian children, and as the trustees promised, Kamehameha need never admit a non-Native Hawaiian applicant again. This description is not meant to criticize Kamehameha's noble mission to help Native Hawaiians receive a quality education, but only to demonstrate that its current policy&#8212;contrary to the majority's creative characterization&#8212;does pose an absolute bar to the admittance of any non-Native Hawaiian students. And, such bar violates section 1981.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

Under that prong, as modified by the majority, Kamehameha's \"admissions policy must do no more than is necessary to correct the manifest imbalance suffered by students of Native Hawaiian ancestry.\" Maj. Op. at 845. To hold that Kamehameha's admissions policy survives this factor, the majority asserts that Kamehameha's policy is both flexible and limited. <i>Id.</i> at 845-46. As for the former, the majority finds that Kamehameha's admissions policy \"does not do more than is necessary\" because that \"policy is not fixed but changes as the capacity of the Schools' programs increases and as the well-being of the Native Hawaiian community rises.\" Maj. Op. at 845. The majority fails to provide any support for that conclusion, and that lack of support is far from surprising given that, as demonstrated above, Kamehameha has only made its race based admissions program more rigid, <i>see supra</i> at pp. 870-71.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also finds that Kamehameha's admissions policy is \"limited in duration\" by the fact that \"if qualified students with Native Hawaiian ancestry do not apply to the School in sufficient numbers to fill the spots available, as happened in one recent year, the Schools' policy is to open admissions to any qualified candidate\" and the admissions policy will end when \"the current educational effects of past, private and government-sponsored discrimination and of social and economic deprivation\" end. Maj. Op. at 845 (footnote omitted). Because, as the majority candidly concedes, \"there are many more qualified students of Hawaiian ancestry than there are available places at the Schools,\" <i>id.</i> at 832, and Kamehemeha altered its admissions criteria in response to what \"happened in one recent year,\" <i>id.</i> at 845, it is unclear whether Kamehameha will ever admit another non-Native Hawaiian student, <i>let alone end its racially exclusive admissions policy.</i> I cannot understand how Kamehameha's policy can reasonably be described as \"limited in duration.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Kamehameha's own trustees put it, \"[Our policy] must remain [in place] until Hawaiians are leading in scholastic achievement, until they are underrepresented in prisons and homeless shelters, until their well-being is restored.\" Trs. of Kamehameha Sch., <i>Kamehameha Schools' Policy Advocates Social Justice,</i> HONOLULU ADVERTISER, Aug. 24, 2003.

The majority, joined to some extent by Judge Fletcher's concurrence, accomplishes this with three premises: First, the majority reasons that because &#167; 1981 was enacted in 1870, prior to the acquisition of Hawaii, \"Congress could not have had any conscious intention as to how [&#167; 1981] would apply in Hawaii.\" Maj. Op. at 847. Second, \"Congress reenacted &#167; 1981 in 1991.\" <i>Id.</i> at 849. Third, \"Congress has passed [legislation] specifically affecting Native Hawaiians both before and after 1991,\" and to read these acts \"consistently with the revised version of &#167; 1981,\" we must read an exemption for Native Hawaiians into &#167; 1981. <i>Id.</i> at 847-48. Indeed, according to the majority, this is \"the most plausible reading of &#167; 1981.\" <i>Id.</i> at 849.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of the majority's premises is either demonstrably wrong or utterly irrelevant. First, the majority's claim that \"Congress could not have had any conscious intention as to how [&#167; 1981] would apply in Hawaii\" is just plain wrong. Maj. Op. at 847. As the majority observes, when Congress first enacted &#167; 1981 as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1870, the Hawaiian Islands were still a sovereign kingdom whose people remained outside the jurisdiction of the United States. The United States did not annex Hawaii until the 1890s. <i>See</i> Maj. Op. at 831, 847. It is clear, then, that Congress could not have <i>initially</i> intended either to cover or to exempt Native Hawaiians from &#167; 1981's provisions. But nothing more can be gleaned from this fact. The majority reads a different point into this history: That we do not know how Congress intended &#167; 1981 to apply in Hawaii. This is nonsensical and flies in the face of, among other things, &#167; 1981 itself, the Hawaiian Statehood Act, the equal footing doctrine, and the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hawaii and its citizens have been subject to &#167; 1981 since Hawaii became a territory because &#167; 1981 applies to \"[a]ll persons with the jurisdiction of the United States,\" including \"every State and Territory.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981(a) (2000).

It is beyond dispute that Congress has enacted numerous statutes providing separate benefit programs for Native Hawaiians, but nothing in those acts says anything about &#167; 1981, much less exempts Native Hawaiians from its coverage. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Hawaiian Homes Commission Act &#167; 1 <i>et seq.,</i> 42 Stat. 108 (1920) (setting aside approximately 200,000 acres and establishing a program of loans and long-term leases for the benefit of Native Hawaiians); Department of Defense Appropriations Act, Pub.L.

Take, for example, the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments which both the majority and the concurrence point to as evidence that Congress approved and exempted Kamehameha's admissions policy. Maj. Op. at 848-49; Conc. Op. at 854. Those Amendments direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \"make grants to the Kamehameha Schools/Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate for a demonstration program to provide Higher Education fellowship assistance to Native Hawaiian students.\" Pub.L. No. 100-297, tit. IV, &#167; 4005(a), 102 Stat. 360 (1988). A directive to give Kamehameha a grant for a demonstration program does not create an exemption from generally applicable civil rights laws.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Furthermore, nothing in Stafford-Hawkins would be inconsistent with enforcement of &#167; 1981 in this case. In fact, it could not be since Congress repealed the demonstration grant program before the sunset provision took effect, Pub.L. No. 103-382, tit. III, &#167; 363, 108 Stat. 3975 (1994), and a current version of the act <i>only</i> mentions Kamehameha in the findings of fact. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 7512(16) (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p211\">\n      <span class=\"num\">211</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Fletcher goes a step farther than the majority, arguing that the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments and the Public Health Service Act \"specifically directed Kamehameha Schools to do precisely what plaintiffs in this case say is forbidden by &#167; 1981.\" Conc. Op. at 854. I cannot see how \"`mak[ing] grants to [Kamehameha] for a demonstration program to provide Higher Education fellowship assistance to Native Hawaiian students'\" or \"`provid[ing] funds to [Kamehameha] for the purpose of providing scholarship assistance' to eligible Native Hawaiian students\" constitutes a specific instruction from Congress to Kamehameha to apply a racially exclusive admissions policy. <i>See</i> Conc. Op. at 854 (quoting Pub.L. No. 100-297, tit. IV, &#167; 4005(a), 102 Stat. at 360 (formerly codified at 20 U.S.C. &#167; 4905(a)) (repealed 1994) and citing Act of Nov. 29, 1990, Pub.L.

Op. at 849 (quoting H.R. REP. No. 107-63(I), at 333). A committee report, however, says nothing about how Congress as a whole views Kamehameha's admission policy. This particular report is of no legislative value whatsoever because it does not even accompany an act; in other words, the committee's resolution does not even aspire to be legislative history. Furthermore, a committee's mere exhortation that Kamehameha should \"redouble[its] efforts to provide for Native Hawaiians,\" <i>id.,</i> does not, as the majority's reasoning would have it, equal legislation, duly enacted, that \"Kamehameha may continue to provide for Native Hawaiians, in violation of existing civil rights laws, if necessary.\" In fact, there is absolutely no evidence that either house of Congress, or even any subset of its membership, knew about&#8212;let alone approved of&#8212;Kamehameha's absolute ban on non-Native Hawaiian students. Thus, the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments and the House committee report do not operate as some kind of estoppel against applying generally applicable civil rights laws to Native Hawaiians generally or to Kamehameha in particular.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p213\">\n      <span class=\"num\">213</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, from this thin record, the majority concludes that \"the most plausible\" way to harmonize these acts with the \"reenactment\" of &#167; 1981 is to infer that \"Congress intended that a preference for Native Hawaiians, in Hawaii, by a Native Hawaiian organization, located on the Hawaiian monarchy's ancestral lands, be upheld.\" Maj. Op. at 849. Mere recitation of the conclusion should remind us of Justice Jackson's \"restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only.\" <i>Smith v. Allwright,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103962\"><a href=\"/opinion/103962/smith-v-allwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span>, 669, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103962\"><a href=\"/opinion/103962/smith-v-allwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

A straightforward reading of &#167; 1981 does not render any other legislation non-sensical, void, or superfluous. The fact that Congress has passed some measures promoting Native Hawaiian education says nothing about whether Congress intended to exempt Native Hawaiian schools from &#167; 1981; there is no legislative conflict to reconcile.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> <i>See Morton v.

Op. at 847-49 (using the enactments outlined above to \"interpret[] the scope of &#167; 1981\"). Moreover, the majority's focus on what Congress may have been <i>thinking</i> ignores what Congress actually <i>did:</i> It passed &#167; 1981, a non-discrimination law of general applicability. Section 1981, on its face, clearly does not create any exemptions for Native Hawaiians; thus, whether or not Congress <i>meant</i> to create such an exemption&#8212;and again, there is absolutely no indication that it intended to do so&#8212;it certainly did not <i>create</i> such an exception. <i>Cf.

Nothing in the statutory language or legislative history of &#167; 1981 even hints that Congress wanted to exempt Native Hawaiian preferences from its provisions.

Like the majority, the concurrence concludes that racial preferences on behalf of Native Hawaiians are exempt from &#167; 1981. However, Judge Fletcher arrives at this result via a slightly different route: First, he reasons that Native Hawaiian status is <i>both</i> a political <i>and</i> a racial classification. Conc. Op. at 850. He then suggests that, under the \"special relationship\" doctrine, Congress has given Native Hawaiians special benefits based on their <i>political</i> status. <i>Id.</i> at 856-57. From that, Judge Fletcher then postulates that because Congress has given Native Hawaiians special benefits, it could not have intended to prohibit private parties from doing the exact same thing. <i>Id.</i> at 852. Thus, according to the concurrence, &#167; 1981, which prohibits <i>racial</i> preferences in private contracts, must be read to exempt preferences on behalf of Native Hawaiians. <i>Id.</i> at 856-57.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p218\">\n      <span class=\"num\">218</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish his beginning premises, Judge Fletcher must rely on <i>Morton v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span> (1974), which created the \"special relationship\" doctrine. In <i>Mancari,</i> the Supreme Court held that the Bureau of Indian Affairs's (\"BIA\") hiring preference for Native Americans did not constitute racial discrimination. 417 U.S. at 553-54, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109067\"><a href=\"/opinion/109067/morton-v-mancari/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Instead, the Court wrote that the preference was \"not directed towards a `racial' group consisting of `Indians'; instead, it applies only to members of `federally recognized' tribes.\" <i>Id.</i> at 553 n. 24, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109067\"><a href=\"/opinion/109067/morton-v-mancari/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court concluded that this preference was therefore not a <i>racial</i> preference at all, but instead a <i>political</i> preference, and applied rational basis scrutiny. <i>Id.</i> Judge Fletcher would conclude that, under <i>Mancari,</i> Congress has the power to exempt private parties' racial preferences in favor of Native Hawaiians from the purview of &#167; 1981.

Kamehameha did argue, as the majority concludes, that preferences in favor of Native Hawaiians are exempt from &#167; 1981; however, it did not base its argument on the special trust doctrine espoused in <i>Mancari.</i> In fact, Kamehameha's brief does not even cite <i>Mancari.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> Because arguments not made in a party's appellate brief are waived, <i>see Blanford v.

As I explain in greater detail below, the exception in <i>Mancari</i> is an exceedingly narrow one, limited to preferences that are political not racial. Second, <i>Mancari's</i> special relationship works only in those cases where Congress has formally recognized the sovereignty of Native American tribes. Despite opportunity to do so, Congress has never formally recognized the sovereignty of Native Hawaiians. Third, even if Congress had recognized Native Hawaiians as a sovereign body, the special relationship doctrine applies only to preferences by the federal government or by the tribes themselves.

The majority exempts an organization with noble goals that seeks to remedy a significant problem in a community that is in great need, but it can do so only because the majority departs from clear principles and established precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p236\">\n      <span class=\"num\">236</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-2_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>Rudebusch</i> did not include the requirement that the \"manifest imbalance\" be present in a job category that was traditionally segregated in its statement of the Title VII test. <i>See</i> 313 F.3d at 520.

It is easy to generate examples which clearly illustrate this: Before 2003, professors at the University of Michigan received numerous federal grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, but this did not indicate that either Congress or the President believed Michigan's admissions policy was constitutional; indeed, the Department of Justice filed amicus briefs in<i>Gratz</i> and <i>Grutter</i> arguing just the opposite.

In <i>Weeks,</i> the Supreme Court rejected an Equal Protection Clause challenge to Congress's decision not to include the descendants of members of a recognized tribe who had voluntarily renounced their status in exchange for United States citizenship from a compensation scheme that benefitted the descendants of tribal members who had renounced their tribal status.

He cites the same body of laws&#8212;the collection of different preferences for Native Hawaiians&#8212;as evidence that Congress both implicitly created a special relationship with Native Hawaiians<i>and</i> implicitly exempted them from &#167; 1981. But Judge Fletcher's analogy to Native Americans is flawed: Congress has <i>expressly</i> created a special relationship with Native Americans by formally recognizing the tribes.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This makes a difference. The Tenth and Eleventh Circuits have held that Native American tribal entities <i>are</i> implicitly exempt from some suits under &#167; 1981.

It receives no federal funds and does not operate for profit. Its purpose of providing meaningful access to educational opportunity is intuitively salutary.

Thus, the articulated justification for its race-based admissions policy is to remedy <i>external</i> discrimination, not <i>internal</i> imbalance. Even if a private educational enterprise has more wiggle room in defining its core mission in a race-conscious way than a private employer, to legitimate a race-based policy solely on account of discrimination <i>by others</i> is to put no bounds on it at all. To do so would render meaningless the factors that influenced the Supreme Court in <i>Weber</i> to approve a voluntary, private, affirmative action plan. 443 U.S. at 208-09, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110135\"><a href=\"/opinion/110135/steelworkers-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

A private entity's progress toward achieving \"balance\" cannot realistically be assessed if measured against society as a whole rather than its own work force or its own student body. But, even if a private party should be able to assume a public responsibility for remediation of past societal discrimination, the acceptable goal of a race-conscious admissions policy for a public educational institution is to achieve a diverse student body. <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 325, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

I don't believe section 1981 would apply at all if the schools were run entirely as a philanthropic enterprise and allowed students to attend for free. In <i>Runyon,</i> \"the racial exclusion practiced by the [schools] amount[ed] to a classic violation of &#167; 1981,\" because \"[t]he parents ... sought to enter into contractual relationships with [the schools] for educational services.\" 427 U.S. at 172, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109509\"><a href=\"/opinion/109509/runyon-v-mccrary/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court emphasized the commercial nature of the relationship: \"Under those contractual relationships, the schools would have received payments for services rendered, and the prospective students would have received instruction in return for those payments.\" <i>Id.</i> I have found no case where section 1981 has been applied to a charity. Were the schools to forego charging tuition, their relationship to their students would probably not be deemed \"contractual\" as that term is used in section 1981 and <i>Runyon.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p257\">\n      <span class=\"num\">257</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Being able to charge tuition is, of course, not inconsequential. For most private schools it is a make-or-break proposition. But it may not be so for the Kamehameha Schools, which were set up primarily as eleemosynary institutions. The tuition they charge reflects only a small fraction of their operating costs and, even then, most students pay a reduced tuition, or no tuition at all. <i>See</i> maj. op. at 831-32. The schools' substantial endowment may enable them to continue operating without charging any tuition for a very long time&#8212; perhaps indefinitely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p258\">\n      <span class=\"num\">258</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the scores of pages we have written on both sides of this issue, it should be clear that the question is close and ours may not be the last word. Given the passions this case has aroused, <i>see</i> maj. op. at 835 n. 6, it's worth noting that what's really at stake may not be the operation of the Kamehameha Schools along their traditional (preferential) model, but merely a few million dollars a year the schools now get from their own students.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
