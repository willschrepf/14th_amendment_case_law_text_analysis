We affirm in part and reverse and remand in\npart.\n\f                                       BACKGROUND\n\n       Barnes was hired by Prairie View A&M University (the University) in 1994\nand served as an agent in the University’s Cooperative Extension Program (CEP).\n\n       In 2007, Barnes began to complain to CEP officials about alleged\nharassment and a hostile work environment. Barnes’s complaints primarily focused\non her interaction with and treatment by her supervisor, Lupe Linderos, but also\nexpressed concerns regarding incidents with other colleagues. In response, CEP\nofficials held a meeting with Barnes to discuss and address Barnes’s concerns.\nBarnes’s complaints continued after the meeting, so in late 2009, she was\nauthorized to work from home by a supervisor. Approximately four months after\nBarnes began to work from home, the University notified her that her employment\nwas terminated effective April 15, 2010.\n\n       Barnes filed this suit alleging disparate treatment discrimination, hostile\nwork environment, and retaliation under the Texas Commission on Human Rights\nAct. Texas A&M and the University moved for summary judgment on no-evidence\ngrounds. Barnes filed a response to the no-evidence motion, and two days later\nTexas A&M and the University filed a “Traditional Motion for Summary\nJudgment and Reply to Plaintiff’s Response to Defendant’s No-Evidence Motion\nfor Summary Judgment.” Ten days after Texas A&M and the University filed their\ntraditional motion for summary judgment, the trial court granted summary\njudgment on no-evidence grounds.1\n\n       1\n          Under a liberal construction of Barnes’s live petition, Barnes asserts claims against\nPrairie View A&M University and the Texas A&M University System. The record indicates that\nBarnes obtained service of citation only on Prairie View A&M University. Nevertheless, the\nmotion for no-evidence summary judgment in this case purportedly indicates that both Prairie\nView A&M University and the Texas A&M University System are making appearances to\n                                              2\n\f                     STANDARD OF REVIEW AND APPLICABLE LAW\n\n       We review summary judgments de novo. Valence Operating Co. v. Dorsett,\n164 S.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex. 2005); Navy v. Coll. of the Mainland, 407 S.W.3d 893,\n897 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, no pet.). A no-evidence motion for\nsummary judgment must be granted if (1) the moving party asserts that there is no\nevidence of one or more specified elements of a claim or defense on which the\nadverse party would have the burden of proof at trial, and (2) the respondent\nproduces no summary-judgment evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact\non those elements. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i); Navy, 407 S.W.3d at 898.\n\n       A no-evidence motion is properly granted when (a) there is a complete\nabsence of evidence of a vital fact; (b) the court is barred by rules of law or\nevidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (c)\nthe evidence offered to prove a vital fact is less than a scintilla; or (d) the evidence\nconclusively establishes the opposite of a vital fact. Navy, 407 S.W.3d at 898. The\nevidence is less than a scintilla if it is so weak as to do no more than create a mere\nsurmise or suspicion that the challenged fact exists. Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway,\n135 S.W.3d 598, 601 (Tex. 2004). We indulge every reasonable inference in favor\nof the non-movant, resolve any doubts arising from the evidence in her favor, and\ntake as true all evidence favorable to her. Valence, 164 S.W.2d at 661; Navy, 407\nS.W.3d at 898.\n\ncontest Barnes’ claim. The trial court’s order awards summary judgment to both the Texas A&M\nUniversity System and Prairie View A&M University. At no point did Barnes challenge Texas\nA&M University System’s participation in the case; therefore, any such contention is waived.\nSee Sixth RMA Partners, L.P. v. Sibley, 111 S.W.3d 46, 56 (Tex. 2003) (“An argument that an\nopposing party does not have the capacity to participate in a suit can be waived by a party’s\nfailure to properly raise the issue in the trial court.”). And, on appeal, Barnes does not challenge\nthe summary judgment rendered in favor of the Texas A&M University System. Therefore,\nBarnes waives any challenge to the judgment in favor of the Texas A&M University System. See\nFields v. Teamsters Local Union No. 988, 23 S.W.3d 517, 523–24 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\nDist.] 2000, pet. denied).\n\n                                                 3\n\f      The Texas Commission on Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination by\nemployers based on “race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age.”\nSee Tex. Lab. Code § 21.051. An employer commits an unlawful employment\npractice if, on one or more of these grounds, it fails or refuses to hire someone;\ndischarges someone; discriminates in any other manner against someone in\nconnection with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of\nemployment; or limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\nemployment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive that person of an\nemployment opportunity or adversely affect the person’s status. Id. The Act is\nintended to “provide for the execution of the policies of Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964 and its subsequent amendments,” and the relevant parts of the\nAct are modeled after Title VII. Id. § 21.001(1); Navy, 407 S.W.3d at 898. Thus,\nwe look to federal precedent for interpretive guidance. Navy, 407 S.W.3d at 898.\n\n                               ISSUES AND ANALYSIS\n\n      In three issues, Barnes contends that the trial court erred in granting\nsummary judgment in favor of the University on her claims of disparate treatment\ndiscrimination, hostile work environment discrimination, and retaliation.\n\n      I.     Disparate Treatment Discrimination Claim\n\n      In her first issue, Barnes asserts that the trial court erred in granting\nsummary judgment as to her disparate treatment discrimination claim.\n\n      In resolving discrimination cases, courts utilize a system of “burden-\nshifting” in which the burden of production shifts from plaintiff to defendant and\nthen back to the plaintiff. See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S.\n133, 142–43 (2000); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802\n(1973). Under this system, the plaintiff must first present a prima facie case of\n\n\n                                         4\n\fdiscrimination establishing that the plaintiff (1) was a member of a protected class;\n(2) qualified for the employment position at issue; (3) suffered an adverse\nemployment action, which includes termination; and (4) was treated less favorably\nthan similarly situated members outside of the protected class. See Reeves, 530\nU.S. at 142; Ysleta Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Monarrez, 177 S.W.3d 915, 917 (Tex.\n2005) (per curiam). Once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination, the burden shifts to the defendant to produce evidence of a\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Reeves,\n530 U.S. at 142. If the defendant produces such evidence, the burden shifts back to\nthe plaintiff to show either (1) the stated reason was a pretext for discrimination, or\n(2) the defendant’s reason, while true, is only one reason, and discrimination was\nanother, “motivating,” factor. Navy, 407 S.W.3d at 899.\n\n      Barnes, who is black, is a member of a protected class. Likewise, her\ntermination constitutes an adverse employment action. In its summary-judgment\nmotion, the University contends that there is no evidence that Barnes received\ndisparate treatment compared to similarly situated employees outside of the\nprotected class. We agree.\n\n      Employees are similarly situated if their circumstances are comparable in all\nmaterial respects, including similar standards, supervisors, and conduct. Monarrez,\n177 S.W.3d at 917. To prove discrimination based on disparate discipline, the\ndisciplined and undisciplined employees’ misconduct must be of comparable\nseriousness. Id. Additionally, the situations and conduct of the employees in\nquestion must be “nearly identical.” AutoZone, Inc. v. Reyes, 272 S.W.3d 588, 594\n(Tex. 2008) (per curiam). Employees with different responsibilities, supervisors,\ncapabilities, work rule violations, or disciplinary records are not considered to be\n“nearly identical.” Id.\n\n                                          5\n\f       In her response to the University’s summary-judgment motion, Barnes\nalleges that she was terminated because she violated University policy by working\nfrom home. To establish disparate treatment, Barnes complains that two non-black\ncoworkers, Mike Shockey and Connie Sheppard, violated employment policies but\nwere not disciplined. Specifically, she alleges that Shockey made racist remarks at\na community outreach event in 2008, and that Sheppard was late to at least one\nevent between 2007 and 2010. But the alleged incidents, without more, are too\ndissimilar to Barnes’s alleged misconduct to show that Shockey and Sheppard are\nsimilarly situated coworkers; therefore, Barnes has failed to raise a fact issue on\nher disparate treatment claim. See id. at 594–95; see also Perez v. Tex. Dep’t of\nCriminal Justice, 395 F.3d 206, 213 (5th Cir. 2004) (explaining that for employees\nto be similarly situated, the employees’ circumstances, including their misconduct,\nmust have been nearly identical). Accordingly, we overrule Barnes’s first issue.\n\n      II.    Retaliation\n\n      In a second issue, Barnes asserts that the trial court erred in granting\nsummary judgment as to her claim against the University for retaliation.\n\n      To make a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that (1) the\nplaintiff engaged in a protected activity; (2) an adverse employment action\noccurred; and (3) a causal       connection existed between participation in the\nprotected activity and the adverse employment action. Pineda v. United Parcel\nServ., Inc., 360 F.3d 483, 487 (5th Cir. 2004); Navy, 407 S.W.3d at 900; Feng v.\nSabic Americas, Inc., No. 14-07-00699-CV, 2009 WL 679669, at *2 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] Mar. 17, 2009, pet. denied) (mem. op.). Protected activities\nconsist of opposing a discriminatory practice; making or filing a charge; filing a\ncomplaint; or testifying, assisting, or participating in an investigation, proceeding,\nor hearing. Tex. Lab. Code § 21.055; Navy, 407 S.W.3d at 900. If the plaintiff\n\n                                          6\n\fmeets this requirement, the burden shifts to the employer to rebut this presumption\nby articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment\naction. Pineda, 360 F.3d at 487; Navy, 407 S.W.3d at 900; Feng, 2009 WL\n679669, at *2. If the defendant meets its burden, then the presumption raised by the\nprima facie case is rebutted and the employee has the burden of proving that the\nemployer’s proffered reason is a pretext and that engaging in the protected activity\nwas the but-for cause of the adverse employment action. Pineda, 360 F.3d at 485;\nNavy, 407 S.W.3d at 900; Feng, 2009 WL 679669, at *2.To carry this burden, the\nplaintiff must rebut each non-discriminatory reason given by the employer. McCoy\nv. City of Shreveport, 492 F.3d 551, 557 (5th Cir. 2007); Navy, 407 S.W.3d at 900.\n\n      The University contends that Barnes failed to make a prima facie case\nbecause she offered no evidence that she engaged in a protected activity and no\nevidence that there was a causal connection between any alleged protected activity\nand her termination. The parties agree that Barnes’s termination constitutes an\nadverse employment action.\n\n      A.     Engagement in a protected activity\n      The only protected activity that Barnes asserts she engaged in is complaining\nto various supervisors. Complaining to a supervisor about harassment based on\nrace, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age by coworkers is a\nprotected activity for the purposes of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation.\nSee Gonzalez v. Champion Techs., Inc., 384 S.W.3d 462, 472–73 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2012, no pet.). Actionable retaliation exists when an employer\nmakes an adverse employment decision against an employee who voices\nopposition to conduct unlawful under the Texas Commission on Human Rights\nAct. See City of Waco v. Lopez, 259 S.W.3d 147, 152 (Tex. 2008). A plaintiff must\ntherefore present evidence that she complained about harassment or discrimination\n\n                                          7\n\fbased on race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age for the\ncomplaint to qualify as a protected activity for the purpose of establishing a prima\nfacie case of retaliation. See Chandler v. CSC Applied Techs., LLC, 376 S.W.3d\n802, 823–24 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, pet. denied); Gonzalez, 384\nS.W.3d at 472–73.\n\n      Barnes offers evidence in depositions and attached e-mails demonstrating\ncomplaints to supervisors about unfair treatment by Lupe Linderos and other\ncolleagues, but none of these complaints alleged unfair treatment based on race,\ncolor, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age. But, evidence in the record\ndemonstrates that Barnes complained to Dr. Carolyn Nobles in 2008 of allegedly\nrace-based comments made by Barnes’s colleague Mike Shockey. Unlike the\ngeneral complaints of unfair treatment by Linderos, this complaint focuses on race-\nbased harassment and therefore constitutes a protected activity under the Act. See\nGonzalez, 384 S.W.3d at 472–73.\n\n      B.     Causal connection between participation in the protected activity\n             and the adverse employment action\n      Barnes must also offer evidence to establish a causal connection between\nparticipation in the protected activity and the termination of her employment.\nCircumstantial evidence sufficient to show a causal connection between an adverse\nemployment action and participation in a protected activity may include (1) the\nemployer’s failure to follow its usual policy and procedures in carrying out the\nchallenged employment actions; (2) discriminatory treatment in comparison to\nsimilarly situated employees; (3) knowledge of the discrimination charge or suit by\nthose making the adverse employment decision; (4) evidence that the stated reason\nfor the adverse employment decision was false; and (5) temporal proximity\nbetween the protected activity and the termination. Crutcher v. Dallas Indep. Sch.\n\n\n                                          8\n\fDist., 410 S.W.3d 487, 494 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, no pet.).\n\n      As evidence of the causal connection between her participation in a\nprotected activity and her termination, Barnes points to the temporal proximity\nbetween the two events and the fact that she was not “afforded the benefit of [the\nUniversity’s] progressive disciplinary policy.” Furthermore, Barnes points to\ndeposition testimony of one of her supervisors, Dr. Daniels, in which he stated that\n“it may be possible” that Barnes’s employment was terminated in retaliation for\nher complaints.\n\n      Although Barnes’s contention that the University denied her the benefit of\nits “progressive disciplinary policy” may be construed as an allegation that the\nUniversity did not follow its usual procedures in terminating her employment, she\ndoes not offer any evidence on this point. Other than Barnes’s assertions in her\nsummary-judgment response and appellate brief that she was not afforded this\nbenefit, the record contains no reference to the policy, no evidence demonstrating\nthat it exists, and no indication that the University usually follows such a policy\nwhen it terminates employees. Without more, Barnes offers no evidence that the\nUniversity failed to follow its usual policies when it terminated her employment.\n\n      Similarly, Dr. Daniels’s deposition testimony was not evidence of a causal\nlink between the protected activity and termination of Barnes’s employment.\nAlthough Dr. Daniels states that “it may be possible” that Barnes’s employment\nwas terminated in retaliation for her complaints, this testimony does not transcend\nmere suspicion. See Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d at 601. It is no evidence. Id.\n\n      Finally, Barnes asserts that, by way of her complaints to her supervisors, she\nengaged in a protected activity until the termination of her employment in April\n2010. Barnes contends that the close temporal proximity between the termination\nand the time she engaged in the protected activity establishes the necessary causal\n                                         9\n\flink. Despite her numerous complaints, though, the only complaint that constituted\na protected activity was her complaint about allegedly race-based comments by\nMike Shockey. The record indicates that Barnes made this complaint to Dr. Nobles\nin 2008. The record also indicates that Barnes complained about Shockey’s\ncomments to Dr. Daniels, though the evidence does not demonstrate when that\nspecific complaint was made.2\n\n       Retaliation need not be immediate to be actionable and there is no hard-and-\nfast-rule that any specified amount of time is too removed to find an inference of\ncausation. San Antonio Water Sys. v. Nicholas, No. 04-12-00442-CV, ___ S.W.3d\n___, 2013 WL 5730592, at *7 (Tex. App.—San Antonio Oct. 23, 2013, pet. filed).\nBut, if the only offered circumstantial evidence of causation is temporal proximity\nbetween the protected activity and the alleged retaliatory action, then “those events\nmust be very close in time for that evidence to be sufficient for a jury to infer a\nretaliatory motivation.” Id.; see Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268,\n273–74 (2001) (holding that an adverse employment action taken twenty months\nafter the protected activity “suggests, by itself, no causality at all”); Azubuike v.\nFiesta Mart, Inc., 970 S.W.2d 60, 65 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, no\npet.) (holding that a two-and-a-half year gap between the protected activity and the\nadverse employment action, “with nothing more, is too long to establish that there\nwas a causal connection”).\n\n       Barnes offers no evidence that she engaged in a protected activity after June\n2008, and her employment was terminated effective April 15, 2010. Without more,\n\n       2\n         We are mindful that we must construe the summary-judgment evidence in the light most\nfavorable to Barnes, but we see no scenario in which the evidence demonstrates that Barnes\nmade complaints about Shockey’s comments to Dr. Daniels shortly before her termination.\nAlthough Barnes asserts that she made general complaints up until she was terminated, in her\nown deposition testimony Barnes stated that the complaints concerned “the issues that were\ngoing on in the county office,” not past statements made in 2008 by Shockey.\n\n                                             10\n\fher evidence that she engaged in a protected activity nearly two years prior to the\ntermination does not establish the necessary causal link to support her prima facie\ncase. See id.\n\n       We overrule Barnes’s second issue regarding her retaliation claim.\n\n       III.     Hostile Work Environment Claim\n       In a third issue, Barnes asserts that the trial court erred in granting summary\njudgment as to her hostile work environment claim against the University.\n\n       The University argues that Barnes failed to raise a fact issue on this claim;\nhowever, a review of the record reveals that the University never asserted a no-\nevidence point as to Barnes’s hostile work environment claim in its no-evidence\nmotion for summary judgment. The University raised its no-evidence point\nregarding Barnes’s hostile work environment claim only once, in a reply to\nBarnes’s response.3 Summary judgment grounds may not be raised for the first\ntime in a reply. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i); TIG Ins. Co. v. Via Net, 178 S.W.3d\n10, 16 n.6 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005), rev’d on other grounds, 211\nS.W.3d 310 (Tex. 2006); LaRue v. Chief Oil & Gas, L.L.C., 167 S.W.3d 866, 875–\n76 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2005, no pet.); Meru v. Huerta, 136 S.W.3d 383, 390\nn.3 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2004, no pet.) (citing Judge David Hittner &\nLynne Liberato, Summary Judgments in Texas, 54 Baylor L. Rev. 1, 8–9 (2002)).\n\n       Because the University did not raise a no-evidence point in its motion for\nsummary judgment regarding Barnes’s hostile work environment claim, the trial\ncourt erred in granting summary judgment on that claim. Accordingly, we sustain\nthe third issue.\n\n       3\n          The University’s reply to Barnes’s response was included in its motion for traditional\nsummary judgment, but this motion was not served at least twenty-one days before the time\nspecified for hearing. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c).\n\n                                              11\n\f                                    Conclusion\n\n      We affirm the trial court’s order granting summary judgment to the\nUniversity on Barnes’s claims of disparate impact discrimination and retaliation.\nWe reverse the trial court’s order granting summary judgment to the University on\nBarnes’s claim of hostile work environment. We sever and remand that claim for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                       /s/    Ken Wise\n                                              Justice\n\n\n\nPanel consists of Chief Justice Frost and Justices Jamison and Wise.\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f",

We affirm in part and reverse and remand in\npart.\n\f                                       BACKGROUND\n\n       Barnes was hired by Prairie View A&M University (the University) in 1994\nand served as an agent in the University’s Cooperative Extension Program (CEP).\n\n       In 2007, Barnes began to complain to CEP officials about alleged\nharassment and a hostile work environment. Barnes’s complaints primarily focused\non her interaction with and treatment by her supervisor, Lupe Linderos, but also\nexpressed concerns regarding incidents with other colleagues. In response, CEP\nofficials held a meeting with Barnes to discuss and address Barnes’s concerns.\nBarnes’s complaints continued after the meeting, so in late 2009, she was\nauthorized to work from home by a supervisor. Approximately four months after\nBarnes began to work from home, the University notified her that her employment\nwas terminated effective April 15, 2010.\n\n       Barnes filed this suit alleging disparate treatment discrimination, hostile\nwork environment, and retaliation under the Texas Commission on Human Rights\nAct. Texas A&M and the University moved for summary judgment on no-evidence\ngrounds. Barnes filed a response to the no-evidence motion, and two days later\nTexas A&M and the University filed a “Traditional Motion for Summary\nJudgment and Reply to Plaintiff’s Response to Defendant’s No-Evidence Motion\nfor Summary Judgment.” Ten days after Texas A&M and the University filed their\ntraditional motion for summary judgment, the trial court granted summary\njudgment on no-evidence grounds.1\n\n       1\n          Under a liberal construction of Barnes’s live petition, Barnes asserts claims against\nPrairie View A&M University and the Texas A&M University System. The record indicates that\nBarnes obtained service of citation only on Prairie View A&M University. Nevertheless, the\nmotion for no-evidence summary judgment in this case purportedly indicates that both Prairie\nView A&M University and the Texas A&M University System are making appearances to\n                                              2\n\f                     STANDARD OF REVIEW AND APPLICABLE LAW\n\n       We review summary judgments de novo.

A no-evidence motion for\nsummary judgment must be granted if (1) the moving party asserts that there is no\nevidence of one or more specified elements of a claim or defense on which the\nadverse party would have the burden of proof at trial, and (2) the respondent\nproduces no summary-judgment evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact\non those elements.

The trial court’s order awards summary judgment to both the Texas A&M\nUniversity System and Prairie View A&M University. At no point did Barnes challenge Texas\nA&M University System’s participation in the case; therefore, any such contention is waived.\nSee Sixth RMA Partners, L.P. v.

Lab. Code § 21.051. An employer commits an unlawful employment\npractice if, on one or more of these grounds, it fails or refuses to hire someone;\ndischarges someone; discriminates in any other manner against someone in\nconnection with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of\nemployment; or limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\nemployment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive that person of an\nemployment opportunity or adversely affect the person’s status. Id. The Act is\nintended to “provide for the execution of the policies of Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964 and its subsequent amendments,” and the relevant parts of the\nAct are modeled after Title VII. Id. § 21.001(1); Navy, 407 S.W.3d at 898. Thus,\nwe look to federal precedent for interpretive guidance. Navy, 407 S.W.3d at 898.\n\n                               ISSUES AND ANALYSIS\n\n      In three issues, Barnes contends that the trial court erred in granting\nsummary judgment in favor of the University on her claims of disparate treatment\ndiscrimination, hostile work environment discrimination, and retaliation.\n\n      I.     Disparate Treatment Discrimination Claim\n\n      In her first issue, Barnes asserts that the trial court erred in granting\nsummary judgment as to her disparate treatment discrimination claim.\n\n      In resolving discrimination cases, courts utilize a system of “burden-\nshifting” in which the burden of production shifts from plaintiff to defendant and\nthen back to the plaintiff. See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 142–43 (2000); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

Under this system, the plaintiff must first present a prima facie case of\n\n\n                                         4\n\fdiscrimination establishing that the plaintiff (1) was a member of a protected class;\n(2) qualified for the employment position at issue; (3) suffered an adverse\nemployment action, which includes termination; and (4) was treated less favorably\nthan similarly situated members outside of the protected class. See Reeves, 530\nU.S. at 142; Ysleta Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Monarrez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1790334\"><a href=\"/opinion/1790334/ysleta-independent-school-dist-v-monarrez/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 917 (Tex.\n2005) (per curiam). Once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination, the burden shifts to the defendant to produce evidence of a\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Reeves,\n530 U.S. at 142. If the defendant produces such evidence, the burden shifts back to\nthe plaintiff to show either (1) the stated reason was a pretext for discrimination, or\n(2) the defendant’s reason, while true, is only one reason, and discrimination was\nanother, “motivating,” factor. Navy, 407 S.W.3d at 899.\n\n      Barnes, who is black, is a member of a protected class. Likewise, her\ntermination constitutes an adverse employment action. In its summary-judgment\nmotion, the University contends that there is no evidence that Barnes received\ndisparate treatment compared to similarly situated employees outside of the\nprotected class. We agree.\n\n      Employees are similarly situated if their circumstances are comparable in all\nmaterial respects, including similar standards, supervisors, and conduct. Monarrez,\n177 S.W.3d at 917. To prove discrimination based on disparate discipline, the\ndisciplined and undisciplined employees’ misconduct must be of comparable\nseriousness. Id. Additionally, the situations and conduct of the employees in\nquestion must be “nearly identical.” AutoZone, Inc. v. Reyes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895070\"><a href=\"/opinion/895070/autozone-inc-v-reyes/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 594\n(Tex. 2008) (per curiam). Employees with different responsibilities, supervisors,\ncapabilities, work rule violations, or disciplinary records are not considered to be\n“nearly identical.” Id.\n\n                                          5\n\f       In her response to the University’s summary-judgment motion, Barnes\nalleges that she was terminated because she violated University policy by working\nfrom home. To establish disparate treatment, Barnes complains that two non-black\ncoworkers, Mike Shockey and Connie Sheppard, violated employment policies but\nwere not disciplined. Specifically, she alleges that Shockey made racist remarks at\na community outreach event in 2008, and that Sheppard was late to at least one\nevent between 2007 and 2010. But the alleged incidents, without more, are too\ndissimilar to Barnes’s alleged misconduct to show that Shockey and Sheppard are\nsimilarly situated coworkers; therefore, Barnes has failed to raise a fact issue on\nher disparate treatment claim. See id. at 594–95; see also Perez v. Tex. Dep’t of\nCriminal Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"37447\"><a href=\"/opinion/37447/perez-v-tdcj-inst-division/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 213 (5th Cir. 2004) (explaining that for employees\nto be similarly situated, the employees’ circumstances, including their misconduct,\nmust have been nearly identical). Accordingly, we overrule Barnes’s first issue.\n\n      II.    Retaliation\n\n      In a second issue, Barnes asserts that the trial court erred in granting\nsummary judgment as to her claim against the University for retaliation.\n\n      To make a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that (1) the\nplaintiff engaged in a protected activity; (2) an adverse employment action\noccurred; and (3) a causal       connection existed between participation in the\nprotected activity and the adverse employment action.

The parties agree that Barnes’s termination constitutes an\nadverse employment action.\n\n      A.     Engagement in a protected activity\n      The only protected activity that Barnes asserts she engaged in is complaining\nto various supervisors. Complaining to a supervisor about harassment based on\nrace, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age by coworkers is a\nprotected activity for the purposes of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation.\nSee Gonzalez v. Champion Techs., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472–73 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2012, no pet.). Actionable retaliation exists when an employer\nmakes an adverse employment decision against an employee who voices\nopposition to conduct unlawful under the Texas Commission on Human Rights\nAct. See City of Waco v. Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895021\"><a href=\"/opinion/895021/city-of-waco-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 152 (Tex. 2008). A plaintiff must\ntherefore present evidence that she complained about harassment or discrimination\n\n                                          7\n\fbased on race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age for the\ncomplaint to qualify as a protected activity for the purpose of establishing a prima\nfacie case of retaliation. See Chandler v. CSC Applied Techs., LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">802</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 823–24 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, pet. denied); Gonzalez, 384\nS.W.3d at 472–73.\n\n      Barnes offers evidence in depositions and attached e-mails demonstrating\ncomplaints to supervisors about unfair treatment by Lupe Linderos and other\ncolleagues, but none of these complaints alleged unfair treatment based on race,\ncolor, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age. But, evidence in the record\ndemonstrates that Barnes complained to Dr. Carolyn Nobles in 2008 of allegedly\nrace-based comments made by Barnes’s colleague Mike Shockey. Unlike the\ngeneral complaints of unfair treatment by Linderos, this complaint focuses on race-\nbased harassment and therefore constitutes a protected activity under the Act. See\nGonzalez, 384 S.W.3d at 472–73.\n\n      B.     Causal connection between participation in the protected activity\n             and the adverse employment action\n      Barnes must also offer evidence to establish a causal connection between\nparticipation in the protected activity and the termination of her employment.\nCircumstantial evidence sufficient to show a causal connection between an adverse\nemployment action and participation in a protected activity may include (1) the\nemployer’s failure to follow its usual policy and procedures in carrying out the\nchallenged employment actions; (2) discriminatory treatment in comparison to\nsimilarly situated employees; (3) knowledge of the discrimination charge or suit by\nthose making the adverse employment decision; (4) evidence that the stated reason\nfor the adverse employment decision was false; and (5) temporal proximity\nbetween the protected activity and the termination. Crutcher v. Dallas Indep. Sch.\n\n\n                                          8\n\fDist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 494 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, no pet.).\n\n      As evidence of the causal connection between her participation in a\nprotected activity and her termination, Barnes points to the temporal proximity\nbetween the two events and the fact that she was not “afforded the benefit of [the\nUniversity’s] progressive disciplinary policy.” Furthermore, Barnes points to\ndeposition testimony of one of her supervisors, Dr. Daniels, in which he stated that\n“it may be possible” that Barnes’s employment was terminated in retaliation for\nher complaints.\n\n      Although Barnes’s contention that the University denied her the benefit of\nits “progressive disciplinary policy” may be construed as an allegation that the\nUniversity did not follow its usual procedures in terminating her employment, she\ndoes not offer any evidence on this point. Other than Barnes’s assertions in her\nsummary-judgment response and appellate brief that she was not afforded this\nbenefit, the record contains no reference to the policy, no evidence demonstrating\nthat it exists, and no indication that the University usually follows such a policy\nwhen it terminates employees. Without more, Barnes offers no evidence that the\nUniversity failed to follow its usual policies when it terminated her employment.\n\n      Similarly, Dr. Daniels’s deposition testimony was not evidence of a causal\nlink between the protected activity and termination of Barnes’s employment.\nAlthough Dr. Daniels states that “it may be possible” that Barnes’s employment\nwas terminated in retaliation for her complaints, this testimony does not transcend\nmere suspicion. See Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d at 601. It is no evidence. Id.\n\n      Finally, Barnes asserts that, by way of her complaints to her supervisors, she\nengaged in a protected activity until the termination of her employment in April\n2010. Barnes contends that the close temporal proximity between the termination\nand the time she engaged in the protected activity establishes the necessary causal\n                                         9\n\flink. Despite her numerous complaints, though, the only complaint that constituted\na protected activity was her complaint about allegedly race-based comments by\nMike Shockey. The record indicates that Barnes made this complaint to Dr. Nobles\nin 2008. The record also indicates that Barnes complained about Shockey’s\ncomments to Dr. Daniels, though the evidence does not demonstrate when that\nspecific complaint was made.2\n\n       Retaliation need not be immediate to be actionable and there is no hard-and-\nfast-rule that any specified amount of time is too removed to find an inference of\ncausation.

Without more,\n\n       2\n         We are mindful that we must construe the summary-judgment evidence in the light most\nfavorable to Barnes, but we see no scenario in which the evidence demonstrates that Barnes\nmade complaints about Shockey’s comments to Dr. Daniels shortly before her termination.\nAlthough Barnes asserts that she made general complaints up until she was terminated, in her\nown deposition testimony Barnes stated that the complaints concerned “the issues that were\ngoing on in the county office,” not past statements made in 2008 by Shockey.\n\n                                             10\n\fher evidence that she engaged in a protected activity nearly two years prior to the\ntermination does not establish the necessary causal link to support her prima facie\ncase. See id.\n\n       We overrule Barnes’s second issue regarding her retaliation claim.\n\n       III.     Hostile Work Environment Claim\n       In a third issue, Barnes asserts that the trial court erred in granting summary\njudgment as to her hostile work environment claim against the University.\n\n       The University argues that Barnes failed to raise a fact issue on this claim;\nhowever, a review of the record reveals that the University never asserted a no-\nevidence point as to Barnes’s hostile work environment claim in its no-evidence\nmotion for summary judgment. The University raised its no-evidence point\nregarding Barnes’s hostile work environment claim only once, in a reply to\nBarnes’s response.3 Summary judgment grounds may not be raised for the first\ntime in a reply.

App.—Corpus Christi 2004, no pet.) (citing Judge David Hittner &\nLynne Liberato, Summary Judgments in Texas, 54 Baylor L. Rev. 1, 8–9 (2002)).\n\n       Because the University did not raise a no-evidence point in its motion for\nsummary judgment regarding Barnes’s hostile work environment claim, the trial\ncourt erred in granting summary judgment on that claim. Accordingly, we sustain\nthe third issue.\n\n       3\n          The University’s reply to Barnes’s response was included in its motion for traditional\nsummary judgment, but this motion was not served at least twenty-one days before the time\nspecified for hearing. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c).\n\n                                              11\n\f                                    Conclusion\n\n      We affirm the trial court’s order granting summary judgment to the\nUniversity on Barnes’s claims of disparate impact discrimination and retaliation.\nWe reverse the trial court’s order granting summary judgment to the University on\nBarnes’s claim of hostile work environment. We sever and remand that claim for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                       /s/    Ken Wise\n                                              Justice\n\n\n\nPanel consists of Chief Justice Frost and Justices Jamison and Wise.\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f</pre>",
