Code, §§ 187, 189).1 The court\nfurther found true, as a special circumstance, the allegation that the killing was\nintentional, and that defendant knew or should have known the victim was a peace\nofficer engaged in the performance of duty. (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(7) (section\n190.2(a)(7).) A penalty jury returned a death verdict. The automatic motion for\nmodification of the verdict (§ 190.4, subd. (e)) was denied, and defendant was\nsentenced to death. This appeal is automatic. (Cal. Const., art. VI, § 11, subd. (a);\nPen. Code, § 1239, subd. (b).) We will affirm the judgment in its entirety.\n\n\n\n\n1       All further unlabeled statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\f                                      FACTS\n\n       A. Guilt and special circumstance evidence.\n       As to the criminal charge of first degree murder and the peace officer\nspecial circumstance allegation, defendant waived his jury trial, self-incrimination,\nand confrontation rights, and stipulated that the court would determine those issues\nfrom the preliminary hearing transcript. That transcript included the following\nevidence.\n       About 8:30 p.m. on July 13, 1996, Bernice Sarthou pulled into the Pepe‘s\nMexican Restaurant on North Placentia Avenue just south of its intersection with\nNutwood Avenue in Fullerton. The sun was still up, so she was wearing her\nprescription sunglasses. She left her car and entered the restaurant, but saw it was\nfull, so she returned to her car and got into the drive-through line. As she did so,\nshe saw a patrol car, with its lights flashing, stopped behind a white BMW. A\nyoung Vietnamese male was sitting in the driver‘s seat of the BMW, and a\nuniformed officer was sitting in the patrol car. When Sarthou looked at the\nBMW‘s driver, he leaned forward, gripped his steering wheel, and gave her a\n―hard stare.‖\n       As the drive-through line moved forward, Sarthou lost sight of the two cars\nshe had seen. She ordered her dinner, received it, and pulled into a parking area to\neat. By this time, she had removed her sunglasses and put on her regular glasses,\nthough there was still some sun. From her parking place, the front of the BMW\nwas again in view, at a distance of 35 to 40 feet. She saw the officer lean into the\ndriver‘s window of the BMW. When she looked up again, the officer and the\nBMW driver were standing outside that car. They seemed to be struggling for\npossession of something. Almost immediately, she heard five shots, and the\nofficer fell. The BMW driver then walked up to the officer and shot him in the\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fhead. After doing so, defendant got into the officer‘s car and drove away. At the\npreliminary hearing, Sarthou positively identified defendant as the man who shot\nthe officer.\n       Around 9:30 p.m. that evening, Douglas Kennedy, a Fullerton Police\nDepartment homicide detective, was advised of the shooting of a California\nHighway Patrol (CHP) officer at 2950 Nutwood Avenue in Fullerton. He\nresponded to the scene. There he found a white 1995 BMW 525i sedan. No CHP\npatrol vehicle was present. Adjacent to the BMW were shell casings, a\nconsiderable amount of blood, and various personal items.2 The latter included a\npolice officer‘s ―Sam Brown‖ belt with holster attached, a handcuff case, a pager\nin a leather holder, an ammunition pouch, and a BMW car key. A wallet\ncontaining identification with defendant‘s name and picture was found on the front\nfloorboard of the BMW.\n       Officer Burt‘s citation book was also nearby. This indicated he had begun\nto write a ticket for a suspended driver‘s license in the name of Phu Duc Nguyen,\nbut the ticket had not been signed by the person being cited. There was a bloody\nshoeprint on the citation book. Also on the ground, near the rear of the BMW,\nwas a ―CHP 180 form,‖ which an officer fills out before impounding a vehicle.\nThe information on the form was for the 1995 BMW. At the front of the vehicle,\ntraveler‘s checks in a paper bag were discovered.\n       Later that night, Officer Burt‘s patrol car was found abandoned in the\ndriveway of a Ford dealership located at the corner of South Loara Street and West\nLincoln Avenue in Anaheim. Defendant lived close to the dealership, at 1780\nWest Lincoln Avenue. A witness saw an Asian male run from the dealership that\n\n2    The victim‘s body had been removed from the scene by the time Detective\nKennedy arrived.\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\fevening, jump over the bumper of a parked Honda, and proceed in the direction of\ndefendant‘s residence. A shoeprint was recovered from the Honda‘s bumper.\n       Officer Burt died from multiple gunshot wounds. There were entry wounds\nbehind his left ear, in his upper right arm, in the back of his left thigh, behind his\nleft ankle, just above his right buttocks, and in his left buttocks. The arm wound\ncaused the humerus bone in his right arm to fracture. The fatal bullets were the\none that entered behind his left ear and exited through his right eye, and those that\nentered his buttocks and traveled upward through his torso into his intestines,\nstomach, and lungs. Gunpowder residue on the entry wound behind the victim‘s\near indicated this bullet had been fired at very close range.\n       Chang ―Alex‖ Nguyen testified that at the time of Officer Burt‘s murder,\nNguyen and defendant were engaged in an ongoing criminal enterprise whereby\nNguyen purchased from defendant, on a weekly basis, large quantities of forged\ntraveler‘s and payroll checks. On the evening of July 13, 1996, defendant\ntelephoned Nguyen in Houston, Texas, where Nguyen lived. Defendant said he\nwas in ― ‗deep shit‘ ‖ because he had ― ‗just [taken] down a California Highway\nPatrolman,‘ ‖ and he needed a place to ― ‗lay low.‘ ‖ The next night, defendant\nflew to Dallas, where Nguyen picked him up at the airport.\n       During the drive from Dallas to Houston, defendant recounted that on the\nevening of July 13, he was pulled over by a CHP officer because his lights were\noff, though defendant thought they were on. Defendant believed he had an\noutstanding warrant, so he did not present his own driver‘s license to the officer,\nand instead ―used somebody else‘s name‖ when identifying himself. That name\n―[came] back as [a] suspended . . . license.‖ The officer removed defendant from\nhis car and told defendant he would have to tow it. At this point, defendant had a\n―gut feeling something was going to go wrong.‖ He suggested the officer just give\nhim a ticket, tow the car, and tell him where to pick it up. The officer responded\n\n                                           4\n\f―[f]ine,‖ but said he had to check the trunk and do an inventory. Defendant then\nknew ―something [was] going to happen‖ because he had ―stuff‖ in the car.3\n       Defendant told Nguyen that the officer then opened the trunk, pulled out a\nbag, opened it, looked inside, and immediately advised defendant he was under\narrest. Defendant already had two ―strikes‖ against him, was afraid a third\nconviction would lead to life imprisonment, and wanted to leave no witnesses. So\nhe drew his gun and shot the officer three times. The officer fell, but was still\n―twitching.‖ Defendant did not want the officer to suffer, and wanted to make\nsure he left no witnesses, so he shot the officer four more times. Defendant then\nlooked for his own car keys, but could not find them, so he took the officer‘s gun,\ngot into the patrol car, and drove away. Defendant abandoned that vehicle\n―somewhere‖ and paid a ―Mexican guy‖ $100 for a ride to a friend‘s house.\n       Shortly after arriving at Nguyen‘s Houston apartment, defendant said he\nneeded to shop for new clothes, particularly new shoes, because he had gotten\nblood on his shoes and had not been able to clean it all off. Nguyen noticed a dark\nspot on the sneakers defendant was wearing.\n       On the way to a shopping mall after his arrival in Houston, defendant made\na cell phone call, apparently to a friend, and asked whether the person called had\ntaken care of ― ‗that package I left for you.‘ ‖ The other person said something,\nand defendant then declared, ― ‗Well, you better because it‘s very important.‘ ‖\nAfter hanging up, defendant told Nguyen he had ― ‗something . . . important I need\nto have my friend get rid of,‘ ‖ and wanted to ― ‗make sure it‘s been done right.‘ ‖\n       Two or three days after defendant‘s arrival in Houston, Nguyen and his\nlawyer contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), met with an agent,\n\n3      Nguyen said he and defendant used the word ―stuff‖ when discussing the\nforged checks Nguyen was buying from defendant.\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fand told the agent of defendant‘s confession and location. Defendant was arrested\nin Nguyen‘s Houston apartment by FBI agents and local law enforcement officers.\n       When arrested, defendant was not wearing shoes, but a pair of Kmart tennis\nshoes were found beneath the sofa on which he had been sleeping. A substance\nresembling dried blood was observed on these shoes. At the preliminary hearing,\nNguyen identified these shoes from photographs as the ones defendant was\nwearing, and wanted to replace, when he arrived from California. The sole pattern\non these shoes was consistent with the bloody shoe print on Officer Burt‘s citation\nbook. A comparison between these shoes and the shoe print left on the bumper of\nthe Honda yielded a ―positive match.‖\n       Victoria Pham, defendant‘s girlfriend, testified she had assisted him in\nleasing a white BMW. She saw him in the car between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. on\nJuly 13, 1996. The next day, he telephoned her and told her ―something [had]\nhappened‖ to the BMW, and it was hers.\n       No defense evidence was presented at the preliminary hearing.\n\n       B. Prosecution’s penalty phase evidence.\n       A jury was sworn to determine the issue of penalty. As a factor in\naggravation, the prosecution presented extensive evidence about the factual\ncircumstances of Officer Burt‘s murder, and about its impact on surviving victims.\n(§ 190.3, factor (a).) Also presented in aggravation was evidence of other crimes\nby defendant involving violence or the threat of violence. (Id., factor (b).)\nFinally, the prosecution introduced evidence that defendant had sustained several\nprior felony convictions. (Id., factor (c).)\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\f           1. Facts of the capital crime.\n       The evidence on this subject was consistent with the prosecution‘s showing\nat the preliminary hearing, but included several additional witnesses and certain\nadditional details.\n       Fullerton Reserve Police Officer Michael Lyman testified that between\n8:00 p.m. and 8:20 p.m. on July 13, 1996, he was driving through the intersection\nof Nutwood and Placentia Avenues when he noticed a CHP car, with its lights\nflashing, parked behind a white BMW. The CHP officer, who was writing the\nBMW driver a ticket, gave Lyman a ―Code 4‖ signal, meaning everything was all\nright and no assistance was needed. Though Lyman first tentatively identified\nanother man as the BMW‘s driver, he later positively identified defendant from a\nphoto lineup.\n       Around 8:30 p.m. on July 13, 1996, Benjamin Baldauf was preparing to\nenter and register at a hotel near the intersection of Placentia and Nutwood. He\nnoticed a CHP vehicle making a traffic stop of a white BMW. Baldauf described\nthe lighting at this time as ―long on shadows, just before dark.‖ As Baldauf\nentered the hotel, the CHP officer appeared to be examining the trunk of the\nBMW.\n       After registering at the hotel, Baldauf and his daughter walked toward the\nPepe‘s Restaurant on Placentia. The officer was still sorting through the BMW‘s\ntrunk, but seemed relaxed. However, the BMW driver appeared nervous; his eyes\nwere ―darting . . . wildly.‖ This bothered Baldauf, so he looked back toward the\nstopped vehicles as he proceeded on toward the restaurant. Baldauf saw the\nofficer approach the driver‘s door of the BMW, at which point ―[t]he [BMW]\ndriver came out shooting.‖ Baldauf counted at least five shots in rapid succession.\nThe BMW driver and the officer struggled and fell together; the shooter appeared\nto take something from the officer, then stood up and shot him in the neck or head\n\n\n                                         7\n\fat close range. Baldauf remembered seeing some traveler‘s checks on the ground\nnear the officer, which ―didn‘t make sense.‖ In court, Baldauf positively\nidentified defendant as the shooter.\n       Bernice Sarthou testified, consistently with her preliminary hearing\naccount, as follows: Around 8:30 p.m. on July 13, 1996, as she pulled into the\nPepe‘s Restaurant on Placentia, she noticed a CHP vehicle, with its lights flashing,\nparked behind a white BMW. As she waited in the restaurant‘s drive-through line,\nshe stared absently at the BMW‘s driver. He leaned forward and gave her a ―hard\nlook,‖ even though she was wearing sunglasses that would have prevented the\ndriver from seeing if she was looking at him. After ordering and receiving her\nfood, she parked where she could see the front half of the BMW. When she\nlooked up, the BMW driver was out of his car and the CHP officer was close to\nthe driver, near the driver‘s door of the BMW. Sarthou heard four rapid shots, and\nthe officer fell. The BMW driver started to walk away, but returned and shot the\nofficer in the head. The shooter then ran out of Sarthou‘s view, but moments later,\nshe saw the CHP car leaving. Sarthou positively identified defendant as the driver\nof the BMW and the shooter of Officer Burt.\n       Around 8:15 p.m. on July 13, 1996, Robert Excell was traveling\nsouthbound on Placentia. While stopped for a red light at the intersection with\nNutwood, he heard multiple gunshots. He turned right onto Nutwood, looked to\nhis left, and saw a police car with its overhead lights on. Excell continued west on\nNutwood, intending to pass under the State Route 57 freeway, then turn left to\nenter the southbound freeway on-ramp. As he proceeded, he saw a CHP car come\nup behind a vehicle in the adjacent lane. The CHP car‘s overhead lights were\nflashing, and defendant was driving it. Defendant veered into the far right lane,\nhonked as if to move a vehicle in that lane out of the way, then swerved left across\ntwo lanes in front of Excell to turn onto the freeway on-ramp. Excell followed the\n\n                                         8\n\fCHP vehicle onto the freeway and pursued it southward as it wove through traffic,\nat speeds of 80 to 85 miles per hour, until he lost sight of it near the Lincoln\nAvenue exit.\n       Around 8:30 p.m. on July 13, 1996, Paul Wilcox, a CHP dispatcher,\nreceived an inquiry from Officer Burt concerning the status of a driver‘s license\nissued to Pao or Pho D. Nguyen, born May 12, 1972. The dispatcher advised that\nthe license in that name was currently suspended, whereupon Officer Burt\nrequested a tow truck to respond to the Chevron station at Nutwood and Placentia.\n       Evidence collected at the crime scene included seven 9-millimeter shell\ncasings, a live 9-millimeter round in the front seat of the BMW, a citation book\nwith a bloody shoe print on it; a ―CHP 180‖ vehicle property form; a paper bag\nfilled with counterfeit traveler‘s checks; a printer, printer cartridges, and bulk\nquantities of high-quality bond paper found in the BMW‘s trunk; a wallet\ncontaining defendant‘s identification; and a BMW car key. Fingerprints on the\nbag and on a piece of paper were identified as defendant‘s.\n       Evidence, similar to that at the preliminary hearing, was presented that\nOfficer Burt‘s vehicle was found abandoned near defendant‘s Lincoln Avenue\nresidence; that around 10:00 p.m. on July 13, 1996, a witness saw a young Asian\nmale hop over the bumper of a Honda as he ran from the area where the car was\nabandoned; and that a partial shoe print was lifted from the Honda‘s bumper.\n       When arrested in Texas, defendant was sitting on a couch. He identified\nwhite tennis shoes near the couch as his. These shoes were turned over to the\nFullerton Police Department. The patterns of the soles were consistent with the\nbloody shoe print on Officer Burt‘s citation book, and were a positive match with\nthe shoe print on the Honda bumper. Testing of blood on the shoes revealed DNA\nmarkers identical to those in a tissue sample taken from Officer Burt. The chance\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fthat three particular markers common to both these samples would be found in\neach of two random individuals was one in six billion.\n       A United States Treasury Department agent testified that the 99 good-\nquality counterfeit traveler‘s checks found in the paper bag at the crime scene\nwere worth about $10,000. These checks belonged to a larger series of already-\npassed counterfeit checks that had caused losses of over $240,000. The quantity\nand quality of the checks in the bag, and the paraphernalia —such as the bond\npaper, printer, and printer cartridges — found in the BMW‘s trunk, indicated that\nsomeone was mass producing the counterfeit instruments, or selling them in bulk.\n       Officer Burt suffered 11 gunshot wounds inflicted by seven bullets. There\nwere no defensive wounds or signs of a struggle. He died of multiple gunshot\ninjuries to his brain, lungs, and visceral organs.\n\n           2. Victim impact.\n       Officer Burt‘s wife, mother, and father testified about the devastating effect\nof his death on his immediate and extended family. The victim, who was 25 years\nold when he died, had dreamed of being a CHP officer like his father. As a result\nof Officer Burt‘s death, his father, a CHP sergeant, retired approximately one year\nlater. Officer Burt‘s wife, described as his ―best friend,‖ was seven months\npregnant with their first child at the time of his death. Family members described\nthe victim as spontaneous, intelligent, sentimental, and fun-loving. The loss was\nespecially hard for his niece and two nephews, because their father had been killed\nin an auto accident about nine months earlier.\n\n           3. Other violent crimes.\n       The prosecution presented the following evidence of other crimes by\ndefendant involving violence or the threat of violence:\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f       Mark Baker lived in a second-story apartment next to the unit defendant\nshared with his girlfriend, Victoria Pham. In the early morning of September 11,\n1995, Baker heard scuffling in defendant‘s apartment. Baker went out onto the\ncommon balcony walkway, where defendant was struggling with Pham,\napparently trying to push her over the railing. Defendant hit Pham on the back of\nthe head or neck with his fist, and she fell to her knees. When Baker said,\n― ‗Knock it off, you motherfucker,‘ ‖ defendant went back into his apartment and\nreturned with a machine gun. Defendant loaded the gun in front of Baker, pulled\nback the bolt, and pointed the weapon at Baker‘s head. Defendant said, ― ‗I think\nyou called me a motherfucker‘ ‖ and ― ‗[l]et me hear you say it again.‘ ‖ Baker\nasked if the gun was real, and defendant responded, ― ‗You want to find out?‘ ‖\nThe confrontation ended when the manager of the apartment complex yelled at\neveryone to go back inside their apartments. Defendant reentered his unit, and\nBaker went to make sure the manager called the police.\n       On the evening of June 17, 1996, Robert Bachand, a Honda automobile\nsalesman, accompanied defendant and another Asian man on a vehicle test drive.\nDuring the drive, defendant said ― ‗[l]et‘s do this‘ ‖ to his companion. Defendant\nthen pulled a nine-millimeter Ruger semi-automatic pistol on Bachand and\ndemanded his wallet and PIN number. Bachand gave up his wallet, which\ncontained his ATM card. He was handcuffed and forced to lie on the back seat.\nDefendant said he and his companion intended to take the car, and both men\nseemed upset when Bachand told them he didn‘t know whether it had Lojack (a\nmeans of tracking a stolen vehicle). At some point, defendant handed a cell phone\nto Bachand, and a voice on the phone told Bachand ― ‗not to fuck with my guys or\nthey will kill you.‘ ‖ Bachand gave his PIN number to the person on the phone.\nDefendant warned Bachand that ― ‗[y]ou don‘t know who you‘re messing with‘ ‖\nand ― ‗[w]e‘re Asian, Vietnamese Mafia.‘ ‖\n\n                                        11\n\f       The men took Bachand to a house in Garden Grove or Westminster, where\ndefendant‘s companion got out of the car, and another Asian man got in.\nDefendant handed this man the gun he had been wielding. During further travel,\nthe cell phone rang again. A voice on the phone demanded verification of the PIN\nnumber Bachand had previously provided, complaining that ― ‗they‘ ‖ were unable\nto get any money out of the account. Bachand explained this was because the\naccount had no money. After debating whether to kill Bachand or release him, the\nmen let him go. Later that evening, Bachand identified a crashed Honda as the\none in which he had been abducted.\n       On the morning of July 13, 1996, the day Officer Burt was killed, Aryan\nNeghat was driving westbound in the fast lane of the State Route 91 freeway.\nA white BMW came up behind him and began following too closely, so Neghat\nmoved to lane No. 2 to avoid contact with that vehicle. The BMW, traveling\naround 70 miles per hour, then pulled very close to another vehicle in the fast lane,\nslightly bumping it. The BMW driver reached down, transferred a gun from his\nright to his left hand, and waved the gun out the driver‘s window. The car in front\nquickly changed lanes, whereupon the BMW driver pulled in the gun and sped\nonward. That night, while watching news of Officer Burt‘s murder, Neghat\nrecognized the white BMW at the crime scene as similar to the one he had\nencountered. In July 1996, Neghat positively identified defendant from a photo\nlineup as the weapon-brandishing driver he had observed, though he was unable to\nmake a positive identification at the April 2000 penalty trial.\n\n           4. Prior felony convictions.\n       The prosecution presented evidence that defendant had suffered prior\nfelony convictions (1) in 1992, for escape while misdemeanor charges were\npending (§ 4532, subd. (a)); (2) in 1992, for possession of an assault weapon\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f(former § 12280, subd. (b); see now § 30605, subd. (a)) and possession of a\nfirearm in violation of an express probation condition (former § 12021,\nsubd. (d)(1); see now § 29815, subd. (a)); and (3) in 1993, for assault with a\ndeadly weapon (§ 245, subd. (a)(1)) and burglary of an inhabited dwelling\n(§§ 459, 460, subd. (a)).\n\n       C. Defense penalty case.\n       Defendant himself was the only defense witness. He testified in narrative\nform as follows: ―Thank you. [¶] Before I start, I would like to say that I did\nrequest for my lawyers not to say anything on my behalf, and I appreciate that.\n[¶] Jurors, I am not here to ask or beg for your sympathy or pity. Nor am I here to\nask or beg of you, the jurors, to spare my life. [¶] Personally I believe in an eye\nfor an eye. I believe in two eyes for every eye. If you were to take down one of\nmy fellows, I would do everything that is necessary to take down at least two of\nyours, just to be even. [¶] In this penalty phase trial, the prosecutor, Mr. Jacobs,\nis seeking the maximum penalty, which we all know is death. I personally feel\nthat the maximum penalty is properly suited for this occasion. I also feel that it is\nthe right thing for you, the jurors, to do. [¶] Being in my situation now I feel it is\nonly fair, there‘s a price to pay for everything in life, now that I am here it‘s time\nI pay that price. Because, after all this entire ordeal, it is just part of the game.\n[¶] That‘s all I have to say, your honor.‖ The prosecutor did not cross-examine\ndefendant, and the defense presented no other evidence. No rebuttal case was\noffered.\n                                    DISCUSSION\n\n       A. Counsel-related claims: conflict of interest; ineffective assistance.\n       Defendant asserts that, at both the guilt and penalty stages, his counsel\nlabored under a potential and actual conflict of interest, and that counsel‘s\n\n\n                                           13\n\fperformance was adversely affected by the conflict, in violation of his state and\nfederal constitutional rights to conflict-free representation. Defendant further\ninsists he did not validly enter a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of the\nconflict. In any event, defendant asserts, the record demonstrates that, in certain\nrespects, counsel provided him with constitutionally ineffective assistance. No\nbasis for reversal appears.\n\n           1. Factual background — conflict of interest claim.\n       The factual background of defendant‘s conflict of interest claim,\nunfortunately complex, is as follows: Defendant was represented at the 1996\npreliminary hearing by retained Attorney Dennis O‘Connell. In subsequent\nproceedings, O‘Connell and another lawyer, George Peters, were appointed to\nrepresent defendant. Daniel Watkins was an investigator originally hired by\nO‘Connell, and later retained by both counsel, to work on defendant‘s case.\n       On July 27, 1998, while defendant was the Orange County Jail awaiting\ntrial in this case, he, Victoria Pham, Watkins, and another ―gang member‖ were\narrested by federal authorities. Soon thereafter, an indictment was filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the Central District of California against\ndefendant, Pham, Huy Ngoc Ha, and Watkins. (United States v. Hung Thanh Mai,\net al.( C.D.Cal., No. SA CR 98-82 LHM) indictment filed Aug. 6, 1998.) Count 1\naccused the indicted persons of conspiring by mail and/or interstate travel to\ncommit murder for hire, in violation of title 18 United States Code section 1958.\nThe alleged murder target was Chang ―Alex‖ Nguyen, a principal prosecution\nwitness as to the state capital murder charges, whom defendant wanted killed\nbecause of his cooperation with law enforcement.4\n\n4      This is the same Chang Nguyen who testified against defendant at his\npreliminary hearing in the instant case. The federal indictment explained that\n                                                          (Footnote continued on next page.)\n\n\n                                         14\n\f        Among other things, the federal indictment asserted that, in furtherance of\nthe conspiracy, Watkins ―traveled to Houston, Texas to locate Nguyen and his\nfamily, and that Watkins ―provided . . . [defendant] and PHAM with information\nabout . . . Nguyen so that Nguyen could be located and killed.‖ The federal\nindictment also alleged that after the authorities provided defendant with fake\nevidence the murder had been carried out, defendant asked Watkins to see if a\nmissing persons report had been filed in Houston for Nguyen, but Watkins warned\nthat any such check might arouse law enforcement suspicions. According to the\nfederal indictment, these events took place in March, April, and May of 1998.\n        On July 31, 1998, before the federal indictment was filed, and in\nanticipation of an upcoming federal bail and counsel hearing for Watkins,\nAttorney James Waltz, who would become Watkins‘s appointed federal counsel,\nfaxed a memorandum to the federal prosecutor‘s office (the Waltz memo). The\nWaltz memo claimed the federal case against Watkins was ―phony,‖ and asserted\nthat Waltz intended to call Peters and O‘Connell, defendant‘s counsel in this case,\nas ―cornerstone‖ witnesses in Watkins‘s defense. According to the Waltz memo,\nWatkins, while acting as Peters‘s investigator, and on Peters‘ behalf, ―interacted\nwith [defendant]. [Defendant] told [Watkins] about [defendant‘s] plan to kill\n[Nguyen] in Texas, and [Watkins] reported all that to . . . Peters, [O‘Connell,] and\nRob Harley, and took their directions.‖ The memo also suggested Peters and\nO‘Connell ―should be disqualified from further representing [defendant] in state\ncourt, as their testimony in Federal court will be adverse to [defendant] . . . as they\n\n\n(Footnote continued from previous page.)\n\ndefendant, then housed in the Orange County Jail, ―hired a person he believed was\nwilling to murder Nguyen in exchange for money. However, the person\n[defendant] hired to commit the murder was an undercover officer . . . .‖\n\n\n\n                                           15\n\fall exculpate [Watkins] from any wrongdoing.‖ The memo claimed that ―all\n[Watkins‘s] activities were blessed by Peters, Harley and [O‘Connell]. Just ask\nthem. [Watkins] did nothing to aid [defendant‘s] plan which was well known\namong his defense team.‖\n       On August 7, 1998, the day after the federal indictment was filed,\nprosecution and defense counsel in this case addressed the trial court about the\nimplications of the federal matter. Peters confirmed that besides defendant, ―this\ninvolves a defense investigator who is also charged in the federal case,‖ and it was\ntherefore ―possible that myself and Mr. O‘Connell could be witnesses in that case,\ncalled by the other defendant.‖ Peters indicated that he and O‘Connell did not\n―see any actual conflicts at this point.‖ However, in an abundance of caution,\ndefense counsel requested the appointment of an outside attorney to advise\ndefendant about possible conflicts. The prosecutor joined in the request.\nUltimately, upon agreement by all counsel, the court appointed Attorney Gary\nPohlson to review applicable materials and render an opinion on the conflict issue.\n       On August 21, 1998, Pohlson reported his activities and conclusions in\nopen court, with defendant and all counsel present. Pohlson acknowledged that\nPeters and O‘Connell would likely be called as witnesses in the federal case, and\nthat a potential conflict arises whenever counsel are required to testify in a matter\ninvolving a client. However, Pohlson indicated that after reviewing materials\nrelated to the federal case, including the Waltz memo, and speaking with\nO‘Connell, Peters, and the federal prosecutor, he foresaw no possibility that\nanything Peters or O‘Connell would say in their federal testimony would be\nharmful to defendant in either the federal or the state case.\n       Pohlson further stated he had explained to defendant (1) the dangers of\nconflicted counsel, (2) that upon proper advisement defendant could waive any\nconflict that did exist, and (3) that if the conflict was validly waived, defendant\n\n                                          16\n\fcould not rely on it later as a basis for attacking the state judgment. According to\nPohlson, defendant indicated he did not believe a conflict existed and confirmed\nthat he wished to retain Peters and O‘Connell as his state counsel.\n       The prosecutor, Orange County Deputy District Attorney Evans, agreed he\ncould foresee no actual conflict. In particular, the prosecutor represented that he\nwas largely ignorant of information gathered in the federal investigation, and that,\nin the instant proceeding, ―I don‘t intend to, and I will not use anything that was\ngathered in terms of information or evidence, and we will not derive anything\nfrom what was gathered, we won‘t use it even in a derivative sense.‖5 Peters and\nO‘Connell confirmed their views that there was no actual conflict, based on what\nthey currently knew about the federal and state cases. Peters iterated that if he did\ntestify in the federal case, ―I believe I would have nothing to say that would harm\n[defendant].‖\n       The court then engaged defendant in an extended colloquy on the conflict\nissue. The court preliminarily confirmed that defendant wished to waive any\nconflict of interest and retain Peters and O‘Connell as his counsel. The court\n\n\n5       This assertion stands in slight tension with the representations made in a\nMarch 2, 2000, federal court hearing addressing whether there should be some\nrelaxation of defendant‘s stringent confinement conditions in the Los Angeles\nfederal detention center while he prepared for his penalty trial in this case. Present\nat the hearing, among others, were defendant‘s state trial counsel, Peters, and\nOrange County Assistant District Attorney Jacobs, who had taken over the state\nprosecution from Evans. Among the issues was whether defendant should be\nallowed to review, in his cell, some 7,000 pages of discovery from the federal\ncase. Discussing the relevance of these materials to defendant‘s penalty defense,\nboth Peters and Jacobs indicated that, while the prosecution was bound to not\nintroduce evidence from the federal investigation in its case-in-chief, some such\nevidence could come in on cross-examination, or as rebuttal to any mitigating\nevidence defendant might present. Ultimately, no evidence from the federal case\nwas presented at defendant‘s penalty trial.\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\frecited that, based on the information presented, ―there [was] an appearance of a\npotential conflict,‖ that it appeared there was no actual conflict, that the court\ncould not finally determine whether an actual conflict existed, but that, if it did,\nsuch a conflict would likely ―not render the representation of defense counsel\nineffective in and of itself.‖\n       The court advised defendant that ―[b]ecause of that appearance of conflict,\nor potential conflict, or conflict,‖ his lawyers might not be able to furnish effective\nrepresentation, and he might not have a fair trial if represented by these counsel.\nFurther, the court admonished defendant that, ―should you have ineffective\ncounsel, your chances of being convicted are greater, and when you waive your\nright to conflict free counsel, you are also waiving an appeal based on that\nconflict.‖ Defendant confirmed that he understood. Defendant also agreed he had\nspoken with Pohlson, who had given him the same advisements.\n       The court then asked defendant whether ―[h]aving been advised of your\nright to be represented by attorneys free of conflict, and having understood the\ndisadvantage and dangers of being represented by attorneys with conflicts, do you\nspecifically give up the right to be represented by attorneys who have no conflict\nof interest?‖ Defendant responded, ―Yes.‖ Defendant agreed that no threats or\npromises had been made to secure the waiver, and the court confirmed that all\ncounsel concurred in defendant‘s decision. Finally, the court adopted, and\nobtained defendant‘s understanding of, the prosecutor‘s further statement that\ndefendant could withdraw his waiver at any future time if he discerned that a\nconflict of interest was adversely affecting the quality of his counsel‘s\nrepresentation.\n       At a progress hearing in state court in December 1998, Attorney Peters\nreported that he was involved in ongoing negotiations with the United States\nAttorney‘s Office on defendant‘s behalf with respect to the federal indictment.\n\n                                          18\n\fPeters reported that a term under discussion in those negotiations was that\ndefendant would agree to plead guilty in the instant case. Peters explained that,\nimmediately upon the filing of the federal indictment, he had visited defendant,\nwho made an ―impassioned plea‖ that he ―felt extremely responsible‖ for drawing\nPham into the plot to murder Nguyen, and ―wanted to do anything he could to\nrectify the situation, particularly with her.‖ Peters reported that defendant ―gave\nme specific directions. And since that time I have been working on those\ndirections, because I believe it is the right thing to do.‖\n       On March 9, 1999, defendant pled guilty in federal court to all counts of the\nfederal indictment, pursuant to an agreement previously reached with the federal\nprosecutor.6 The agreement included defendant‘s promise that he would also\nplead guilty in the instant proceeding to the murder of Officer Burt, and would\nadmit the special circumstance allegation that he intentionally killed a peace\nofficer engaged in the performance of duty, subject to a trial to determine the\nappropriate penalty. It also provided for the continued imposition of very severe\nconfinement conditions for the duration of defendant‘s federal incarceration, and\nincluded defendant‘s waiver of the right to serve his entire federal term before any\nstate death sentence was carried out.\n\n\n6       These counts included not only the murder conspiracy charge (Count One),\nbut charges of the substantive offense of using the mail or interstate travel with the\nintent that murder for hire be committed (Count Two; 18 U.S.C. § 1958), and a\ncharge that defendant aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, and\nprocured the commission by his federal codefendant, Ha, of the offense of\nknowingly and unlawfully possessing a machine gun (Count Three; 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 2(a), 922(o)(1)). The stipulated facts supporting Count Three were that in\nJanuary 1998, defendant arranged for the sale of a MAC-11 machine gun and\nsilencer, which were delivered to the undercover officer by Ha. The stipulation\nrecites that two days later, the weapon malfunctioned during a test firing, causing\na fatal head wound to the range officer.\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f       As consideration for defendant‘s plea, the federal prosecutor promised to\nrecommend, with respect to defendant, certain sentencing guideline reductions,\nprovided defendant met specified conditions. The federal prosecutor also\npromised to give ―due consideration to the mitigating role‖ that Pham played in\nthe Nguyen murder conspiracy, ―and accordingly to recommend a sentence for\nPham based on that lesser role,‖ under the federal sentencing guidelines.\n       Attached to the federal agreement was a recitation of the factual basis of the\nplea. The parties stipulated that the facts set forth in the recitation could be proved\nbeyond reasonable doubt in a trial. The redacted version of the recitation included\nin the instant record stated, among other things, that ―codefendant #4‖ (clearly\nWatkins) gave defendant a photo of intended murder victim Nguyen, which photo\n―codefendant #4‖ had obtained from discovery materials provided by the state\nprosecutor in this case. The recitation further stated that ―codefendant #4‖ warned\ndefendant against attempting to confirm Nguyen‘s death by checking for a missing\npersons report, and instead offered to make some ―inquiries‖ by pay phone when\nhe was in Houston. No portion of the factual recitation suggested that Peters or\nO‘Connell had any role in ―codefendant #4‘s‖ activities, or in those of any other\ndefendant in the federal case.\n       In June 1999, Watkins pled guilty, pursuant to agreement, to a reduced\nfederal charge of accessory after the fact to the offense of using the mail with\nintent that a murder for hire be committed (18 U.S.C. § 3). The agreement recited\nthat, knowing defendant had committed the underlying substantive offense,\nWatkins ―assisted [defendant] with the intent to hinder or prevent [defendant‘s]\napprehension, trial, and punishment‖ for that crime. Nothing in this recitation\nimplicated Peters or O‘Connell.\n       On July 23, 1999, in the instant case, the court addressed the defendant‘s\nrequest to waive his trial rights with respect to guilt and special circumstance\n\n                                          20\n\ffindings, and to stipulate that the trial court could determine those issues on the\nbasis of the preliminary hearing transcript. At the plea hearing, the court took\nparticular note of the condition in defendant‘s federal plea agreement that he plead\nguilty in the instant case. Accordingly, the court sought to assure itself that his\nwaivers of trial rights were truly knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and not the\nresult of duress, coercion, threats, or promises.\n       Attorney Peters explained that defendant‘s motive for entering the federal\nplea agreement, though it provided him virtually no personal benefit, was to\nobtain, at any sacrifice to himself, any advantage he could secure for Pham. On\nthe other hand, Peters represented, and the state and federal prosecutors — both of\nwhom were present — agreed, that defendant was under no practical obligation,\nby virtue of the federal plea agreement, to enter a ―slow plea‖ in the state case.\nAll federal sentencing jurisdiction over defendant and Pham had ended, and all\nterms of the agreement requiring the federal prosecutor to make recommendations\nconcerning Pham‘s prison placement had been satisfied. Neither the state nor the\nfederal prosecutor sought to hold defendant to the federal agreement‘s requirement\nthat he plead guilty to Officer Burt‘s murder.\n       Rather, Peters, citing his experience as a capital trial lawyer, indicated that\n―I made an analysis and . . . based on the quality of evidence against [defendant]\nand the nature of some of that evidence, . . . I have always realized that if we had\nanything to say and wanted credibility, we have to do it at the penalty phase.\nThat‘s why I am willing to do this.‖ As Peters explained, the prosecutor ―is going\nto put this evidence on anyways [at the penalty phase], some of it, and hopefully it\nwill be lesser than he would have otherwise. And I need, if I am going to have any\nhope of looking jurors in the eye and making the pitches I want to make, that\nI have to have the highest degree of credibility with them, and I can have that\ncredibility by pointing out that [defendant] has done the right thing [by not\n\n                                          21\n\finsisting on a guilt trial].‖ Indeed, Peters made clear, defendant ―is not begging\nfor anything,‖ and ―may not even want to . . . present[ ] evidence in the penalty\nphase, he hasn‘t made that decision yet, and that‘s up to him.‖\n       In response to a request from the prosecutor that the record be made clear,\nPeters obtained defendant‘s confirmation that he had explained to defendant the\n―tactical and strategic reasons‖ for submitting the guilt and special circumstance\nissues, that defendant did not disagree with this advice, that defendant could do\nnothing more to help or hurt Pham, and that he was not required to waive his trial\nrights. The court accepted the stipulation.\n       However, the court revisited the issue on July 30, 1999. Counsel reported\ndefendant was disturbed by newspaper articles that apparently cited the tactical\nreasons counsel had given the previous week for agreeing to the ―slow plea‖\nprocedure — i.e., doing the ―right thing‖ in order to preserve credibility at a\npenalty trial — as defendant‘s personal reasons for stipulating to submission on\nthe preliminary hearing transcript. Allowed to make a statement on his own\nbehalf, defendant said he was ―not doing this so-called plea‖ in hopes of ―sav[ing]\nface or retain[ing] credibility for future jurors,‖ and was not ―asking for mercy or\npity or sympathy from future jurors,‖ but was acting for ―my own personal\nreasons.‖ Defendant indicated that ―[w]hatever reasons my lawyers might have,\nstrategic or other, they have discussed that with me,‖ and he assumed counsel\nwere ―obligated to follow through with that,‖ but as far as he was concerned,\n―[w]hatever results emerge from my penalty phase and my sentencing, so be it.‖\n       Defendant declined to indicate what his ―personal reasons‖ were, but he\ninsisted they did not include the hope of gaining anything for himself or for\nVictoria Pham. He again confirmed he was acting freely and voluntarily. The\ncourt thereupon indicated it was satisfied that defendant‘s waiver of a guilt and\nspecial circumstance trial was appropriate.\n\n                                         22\n\f       On the basis of this factual record, defendant now claims his trial counsel\nfaced a potential conflict of interest arising from concerns about their personal\ninvolvement in the Nguyen murder conspiracy case, and in the conspiracy itself.\nThis potential conflict, defendant insists, ripened into an actual one because, as a\nmatter of fact, it adversely affected counsel‘s performance in the instant case,\ninfluencing them to refrain from providing a competent and vigorous defense at all\nphases of the state capital trial. Moreover, defendant maintains, his purported\nwaiver of any conflict was invalid, because the record indicates he was not\nsufficiently apprised of the pressures that might bear on counsel‘s ability to give\nhim zealous and undivided loyalty. He further asserts that aspects of his counsel‘s\nperformance were professionally deficient regardless of any conflict. As we will\nexplain, we find no merit in these contentions.\n\n           2. Applicable law.\n       A criminal defendant‘s federal and state constitutional rights to counsel\n(U.S. Const., 6th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, § 15) includes the right to effective\nlegal assistance. When challenging a conviction on grounds of ineffective\nassistance, the defendant must demonstrate counsel‘s inadequacy. To satisfy this\nburden, the defendant must first show counsel‘s performance was deficient, in that\nit fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional\nnorms. Second, the defendant must show resulting prejudice, i.e., a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel‘s deficient performance, the outcome of the\nproceeding would have been different. When examining an ineffective assistance\nclaim, a reviewing court defers to counsel‘s reasonable tactical decisions, and\nthere is a presumption counsel acted within the wide range of reasonable\nprofessional assistance. It is particularly difficult to prevail on an appellate claim\nof ineffective assistance. On direct appeal, a conviction will be reversed for\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fineffective assistance only if (1) the record affirmatively discloses counsel had no\nrational tactical purpose for the challenged act or omission, (2) counsel was asked\nfor a reason and failed to provide one, or (3) there simply could be no satisfactory\nexplanation. All other claims of ineffective assistance are more appropriately\nresolved in a habeas corpus proceeding. (E.g., People v. Vines (2011) 51 Cal.4th\n830, 875-876 (Vines); People v. Mendoza Tello (1997) 15 Cal.4th 264, 266-267.)\n       The federal and state constitutional right to counsel in a criminal case also\nincludes the right to representation free of conflicts of interest that may\ncompromise the attorney‘s loyalty to the client and impair counsel‘s efforts on the\nclient‘s behalf. (E.g., Glasser v. United States (1942) 315 U.S. 60, 69-70;\nPeople v. Doolin (2009) 45 Cal.4th 390, 417 (Doolin).) For both state and federal\npurposes, a claim of conflicted representation is one variety of claim that counsel\nprovided ineffective assistance. Hence, to obtain reversal of a criminal verdict, the\ndefendant must demonstrate that (1) counsel labored under an actual conflict of\ninterest that adversely affected counsel‘s performance, and (2) absent counsel‘s\ndeficiencies arising from the conflict, it is reasonably probable the result of the\nproceeding would have been different. (Mickens v. Taylor (2002) 535 U.S. 162,\n166 (Mickens); Doolin, supra, at pp. 417-418, 421; see Strickland v. Washington\n(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687, 694.)\n       When addressing an appellate claim that a conflict of interest adversely\naffected counsel‘s performance, the reviewing court is ― ‗bound by the record.\nBut where a conflict of interest causes an attorney not to do something, the record\nmay not reflect such an omission. We must therefore examine the record to\ndetermine (i) whether arguments or actions omitted would likely have been made\nby counsel who did not have a conflict of interest, and (ii) whether there may have\nbeen a tactical reason (other than the asserted conflict of interest) that might have\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\fcaused any such omission.‘ (People v. Cox (2003) 30 Cal.4th 916, 948-949.)‖\n(Doolin, supra, 45 Cal.4th 390, 418.)\n       The defendant may voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waive a\nconflict of interest. But the court must take steps to ensure that any waiver of a\npossible conflict meets those standards. If, after inquiry, the court determines that\na waiver is necessary, it must satisfy itself that the defendant (1) has discussed\nwith his or her own counsel, or with an outside attorney if he or she wishes, the\npotential drawbacks of representation by counsel who may have a conflict of\ninterest; (2) has been advised of the dangers of conflicted representation in his\ncase; and (3) voluntarily wishes to waive that right. Where the court fails to fulfill\nthese duties, reversal is required if the defendant can establish that counsel‘s\nperformance was deficient, that an actual conflict of interest was the reason for the\ndeficiency, and that it is reasonably probable the deficiency adversely affected the\noutcome of the case. (People v. Sanchez (1995) 12 Cal.4th 1, 47 (Sanchez);\nPeople v. Bonin (1989) 47 Cal.3d 808, 837-838; People v. Mroczko (1983) 35\nCal.3d 86, 110; see Doolin, supra, 45 Cal.4th 390, 417-418, 421.)\n\n           3. Waiver of conflict of interest.\n       The People urge at the outset that defendant validly waived any conflict of\ninterest arising from his counsel‘s connection to the federal case. We agree.\n       Here, the court perceived a possible conflict of interest and, as the cases\nrequire, it addressed the issue with considerable care. The court appointed\nindependent counsel to investigate and advise defendant on the subject, and\nconfirmed that independent counsel had done so. Before taking defendant‘s\nwaiver, the court warned him of the essential danger of conflicted representation,\ni.e., that the conflict might induce counsel to ―pull their punches‖ when\nrepresenting him in the instant case. It was further agreed on the record that\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\fdefendant could withdraw the waiver at any time if a conflict actually materialized\nand he perceived it was affecting his counsel‘s performance. Hence, it appears\ndefendant was generally apprised of the considerations that should influence his\nwaiver decision.\n       Nonetheless, defendant complains that because the court‘s inquiry into the\nconflict, and the advisements he received, were inadequate, his purported waiver\nwas not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. He asserts that, while he was warned\nabout the chance his counsel might be witnesses in the federal matter, and was\nassured they would say nothing to inculpate him, he was never informed of the\nWaltz memo‘s insinuations that counsel themselves had committed serious ethical\nand criminal violations by ―direct[ing]‖ and ―bless[ing]‖ Watkins‘s involvement in\nthe Nguyen murder plot. Defendant insists he should have been told that counsel‘s\nexposure to personal criminal liability might motivate them to ―pull their punches‖\nwhen representing him, in order to curry favor with both federal and state\nprosecutors in hopes of avoiding the consequences of their own derelictions.\nIndeed, defendant posits, by accepting assurances that there appeared no chance\nhis counsel would testify unfavorably to him in the federal matter, he may\nmistakenly have believed that there was no potential conflict, and that he could\ntherefore safely enter his waiver.\n       However, as we have consistently said, waiver of a possible attorney\nconflict of interest is not invalid simply because all conceivable ramifications of\nthe potential conflict were not explored or explained, and the waiver does not\nextend only to those matters discussed on the record. (E.g., People v. Roldan\n(2005) 35 Cal.4th 646, 728; People v. Carpenter (1997) 15 Cal.4th 312, 375;\nSanchez, supra, 12 Cal.4th 1, 47-48.) Indeed, where no actual conflict has\nmaterialized at the time the waiver is taken, it may simply be impossible to foresee\nfuture developments that could have a genuine effect on counsel‘s loyalty and\n\n                                         26\n\fzeal; on the other hand, sources of conflict that are merely speculative and\nconjectural need not be addressed.\n       That is the situation presented here. The sole basis in the record for the\nproposition that defendant should have been warned about his counsel‘s possible\ndirect criminal involvement in the Nguyen murder conspiracy is the Waltz memo,\nwhich Independent Counsel Pohlson reviewed. But that document is an\nexceedingly weak foundation upon which to build such a theory.\n       Defendant characterizes the Waltz memo as containing ―allegations‖ by\nWatkins himself that his criminal assistance to defendant in the Nguyen murder\nplot was ―directed‖ and ―blessed‖ by defendant‘s attorneys, Peters and O‘Connell.\nOn the contrary, Waltz‘s off-the-cuff assertions, apparently made prior to his\nactual appointment as Watkins‘s federal lawyer, did not amount to direct\n―allegations‖ by Watkins. At most, they appear to have been a lawyer‘s clumsy,\ninformal, and preliminary attempts to advocate on a potential client‘s behalf, and\nperhaps to apply some kind of tactical leverage against Peters and O‘Connell as\npotential witnesses in Watkins‘s case. Pohlson could reasonably conclude they\nexhibited no indicia of credibility sufficient to invoke a genuine concern about\ncounsel‘s criminal involvement in the acts charged against Watkins by the federal\nindictment.\n       Moreover, by its terms, the ambiguously worded Waltz memo did not\nexplicitly claim Peters and O‘Connell knew of, directed, or blessed any criminal\nactivity by Watkins. While the memo declared that Watkins ―interacted‖ with\ndefendant, that defendant told Watkins of his plan to kill Nguyen, and that\nWatkins ―reported all that‖ to defendant‘s counsel, the memo also insisted that the\nfederal charges against Watkins were ―phony‖ and ―trumped up,‖ that Watkins\n―did nothing to aid [defendant‘s] plan,‖ and that any testimony by Peters and\nO‘Connell in Watkins‘s federal case would ―exculpate [Watkins] from any\n\n                                         27\n\fwrongdoing.‖ It is reasonable to assume Waltz believed Peters and O‘Connell\nwould say, truthfully, that Watkins did nothing illegal on their orders, and that any\nactivities of Watkins they ―direct[ed]‖ or ―blessed‖ were legitimate.\n       Finally, it was entirely reasonable, upon review of the Waltz memo, to\nconclude at the time the waiver was entered that the principal source of potential\nconflict it revealed was the possibility counsel would be called as witnesses in\nWatkins‘s defense. Indeed, the only reason the Waltz memo expressed for its\nclaim that Peters and O‘Connell should be disqualified from representing\ndefendant in this case was that ―their testimony in Federal court [would] be\nadverse to [defendant]‖ insofar as it exculpated Watkins.\n       Under these circumstances, neither Independent Counsel Pohlson nor the\ncourt was reasonably obliged to speculate further about what conflicts might arise\nas a result of the federal investigation into defendant‘s murder plot and the\nresulting indictment. There was no requirement to advise defendant that, aside\nfrom the chance Peters and O‘Connell might be called as witnesses on Watkins‘s\nbehalf, another source of conflict might be their own potential criminal liability for\nhis activities. Accordingly, defendant‘s waiver of a potential conflict of interest\nwas valid when given.\n\n                4. Claims of ineffective and conflict-related adverse\n                   representation.\n       In any event, defendant‘s complaints against his counsel fail on the merits.\nHe is unable to show on the appellate record that any potential conflict of interest\nactually materialized. Further, the record fails to demonstrate that any conflict of\ninterest resulted in adverse performance by his counsel, or that counsel otherwise\nrendered ineffective assistance.\n       At the outset, there is no evidence on the record that Defense Counsel\nPeters and O‘Connell were called as witnesses in the federal case, or ever became\n\n\n                                         28\n\fthe focus of any state or federal investigation into their own criminal involvement\nin the activities of their investigator, Watkins. Indeed, the record belies any such\ndevelopments. As noted above, Watkins never went to trial in the federal case\nagainst him; in June 1999, he entered a negotiated plea to a reduced charge of\naccessory after the fact in the conspiracy to murder Chang Nguyen. The brief\nfactual recitation included in the plea agreement made no reference to Peters or\nO‘Connell. Similarly, in March 1999, defendant himself entered a negotiated plea\nto the federal charges against him. His plea agreement attached an extensive\nfactual recitation of his central role in the murder plot, but again, it included no\nmention of any involvement by Peters and O‘Connell.\n       These events occurred before July 23, 1999, when defendant entered his\n―slow plea‖ to the capital charges in this case. By this time, therefore, it appears\ncounsel was not burdened by any actual, or even potential, conflict arising from\nthe chance they would be called as witnesses in the federal proceedings against\nWatkins or defendant.\n       But even if we assume a potential conflict remained because of the\npossibility Peters and O‘Connell might still be criminally charged in the Nguyen\nmurder plot, the record discloses no adverse or ineffective performance by his\ncounsel. Defendant cites several actions or omissions by counsel that he deems\nadverse, deficient, and conflict related, but the record does not support his claims.\n\n                a. Federal plea agreement; “slow plea” strategy.\n       First, defendant urges the potential conflict caused counsel to engineer his\nonerous plea agreement in the federal case, by which he additionally, and\nprejudicially, bound himself to plead guilty to the murder charge and peace officer\nspecial circumstance allegation in this case. But the record suggests otherwise.\nWithout objection by defendant, Peters explained in state court that the reason\n\n\n\n                                          29\n\fdefendant acceded to the federal terms was to obtain, at any sacrifice, whatever\nbenefit he could for his girlfriend and federal codefendant, Victoria Pham. The\ngovernment agreed, in return for defendant‘s federal plea, to make certain leniency\nrecommendations for Pham, and it honored its promise.\n       In any event, defendant fails to demonstrate from the record that the\nagreement resulted in his ―slow plea‖ here. Again, the evidence is to the contrary.\nBefore allowing defendant to submit the guilt and special circumstance issues on\nthe preliminary hearing transcript, the instant trial court took particular note of the\n―plead guilty‖ term of the federal agreement and inquired about its significance.\nThe federal and state prosecutors stressed they did not deem defendant bound by\nhis federal promise, and they conceded there was nothing the government could do\nby that time if he breached it. Peters explained the ―slow plea‖ was not influenced\nby the federal agreement, but was a tactical and strategic decision, based on the\npremise that the evidence against defendant was overwhelming, that there was\nlittle if any chance a jury would exonerate defendant of capital charges, and that a\npenalty jury might be better disposed toward defendant if the jurors knew he had\n―done the right thing‖ by waiving a trial on the issue of guilt.\n       The record confirms the strength of the evidence that defendant murdered a\npolice officer during a routine traffic stop in order to escape arrest for a third strike\noffense. Counsel also presumably knew a penalty trial would likely reveal\ndefendant as a violent sociopath with a significant, gang-affiliated criminal\nbackground, even without the evidence that he orchestrated, from behind bars, a\nplot to kill a principal prosecution witness in this case. Counsel thus faced a\nparticularly difficult task in defending the case at both the guilt and penalty\nphases.\n       Under these circumstances, where realistic lines of defense were few, it was\ntactically and strategically reasonable to acquiesce in a ―slow plea‖ on the guilt\n\n                                           30\n\fand special circumstance issues, in hopes of preserving some credibility and\nsympathy before a penalty jury. The record does not show that a different strategy\nwould likely have been adopted by competent, unconflicted counsel. Hence, it\nfails to demonstrate either conflict-driven adverse performance, or ineffective\nassistance, on counsel‘s part. (See Doolin, supra, 45 Cal.4th 390, 424.)\n       Defendant insists counsel‘s ―slow plea‖ strategy was adverse and\nincompetent insofar as defendant failed to receive a return benefit and, in\nparticular, a prosecutorial promise not to seek the death penalty. But the record\ncontains no inkling that counsel could reasonably have expected such benefits.\nCommon sense suggests the prosecution would not likely have offered favorable\nterms in a case presenting overwhelming evidence that defendant murdered a\npeace officer in cold blood to avoid arrest and prosecution for other crimes.\nAgain, the record affords no ground to conclude that counsel‘s failure to seek such\nbenefits constituted adverse performance stemming from a conflict of interest, or\nwas otherwise professionally deficient.7\n       Defendant also contends his counsel‘s agreement to a ―slow plea‖ was\nadverse and incompetent insofar as it deprived him of a ―compelling‖ trial\nargument against the sole special circumstance allegation, that he murdered a\npeace officer ―engaged in the performance of . . . duties.‖ (§ 190.2(a)(7).) This\n\n\n7      Defendant suggests counsel might have offered defendant‘s cooperation in\nproviding information about the conspiracy to murder Nguyen in return for a\npromise of leniency. However, it seems particularly unlikely state prosecutors\nwould have given up their right to seek death for defendant‘s actual murder of a\nCHP officer in return for defendant‘s help to federal prosecutors in a case\ninvolving a mere unsuccessful plot to kill a witness in the state case. Hence, so far\nas appears from the record, defendant‘s counsel had reasonable grounds not to\npursue this avenue, and there is no basis to believe competent, unconflicted\ncounsel would likely have acted differently.\n\n\n\n                                           31\n\fclaim is premised on the rule that murder of a peace officer ―engaged in . . .\nduties‖ is only committed when the officer was exercising his or her authority\nlawfully at the time the lethal act occurred. (E.g., People v. Cruz (2008)\n44 Cal.4th 636, 673; People v. Mayfield (1997) 14 Cal.4th 668, 791 (Mayfield);\nPeople v. Gonzalez (1990) 51 Cal.3d 1179, 1217.)\n       As defendant observes, a police detention, including a traffic stop, is an\nunlawful ―seizure‖ under the Fourth Amendment absent specific articulable facts\nthat objectively manifest a possibility the person detained is violating the law.\n(E.g., Delaware v. Prouse (1979) 440 U.S. 648, 663; People v. Hernandez (2008)\n45 Cal.4th 295, 299; Mayfield, supra, 14 Cal.4th 668, 791.) Defendant asserts a\njury could have found the prosecution had been unable to prove beyond reasonable\ndoubt that Officer Burt ―lawfully‖ stopped and detained him on July 13, 1996.\n       The pertinent circumstances are as follows: Defendant‘s murder of Officer\nBurt prevented the victim from explaining why the stop occurred. At the\npreliminary hearing, prosecution witness Nguyen testified defendant told him the\nofficer stopped him because his lights were not on, although defendant thought\nthey were on. As in effect in 1996, the traffic laws required vehicles to turn on\ntheir lights from one-half hour after sunset until one-half hour before sunrise, or in\nother poor visibility conditions. (Veh. Code, §§ 280, 24400, 38335.) The stop\noccurred in the early evening of July 13, 1996 — sometime after 8:00 p.m. — but\nthe record does not disclose the exact time of sunset in Fullerton on that\nmidsummer day, and eyewitness Bernice Sarthou testified the sun had not yet set\nwhen the stop occurred.8 Thus, defendant urges, he might have persuaded a jury\n\n\n\n8      Sarthou also testified, however, that she observed the traffic stop about 8:30\np.m., when she pulled into the driveway of an adjacent restaurant. Moreover, by\n                                                          (Footnote continued on next page.)\n\n\n                                          32\n\fthere was reasonable doubt whether the prosecution had established the\nlawfulness, ab initio, of the traffic stop that eventually led to Officer Burt‘s\nmurder.\n        However, even though the peace officer special circumstance was crucial to\ndefendant‘s eligibility for the death penalty, counsel were not compelled to pursue\nan ―illegal stop‖ strategy regardless of its chances of success. It is noteworthy that\nafter reviewing the preliminary hearing transcript, the learned trial court, acting as\na fact finder, implicitly found all elements of the special circumstance, including\nthe ―lawful duty‖ element, proven beyond reasonable doubt. Elsewhere in this\nopinion, we uphold this implicit finding; we consider on the merits, and reject,\ndefendant‘s claim that there was insufficient evidence from which a rational fact\nfinder could find beyond reasonable doubt that Officer Burt was lawfully\nperforming his duties when he was killed.\n        Thus, experienced trial counsel could rationally conclude, for several\nreasons, that the overall risks of trying the special circumstance issue outweighed\nthe benefits. In the first place, counsel knew that in any jury trial, the jury would\nbe exposed to persuasive evidence defendant had gunned down Officer Burt\nduring a routine traffic stop in order to avoid arrest and conviction for a third\nstrike offense. Under these circumstances, counsel could harbor a reasonable\nconcern that lay jurors would find an ―illegal stop‖ argument hypertechnical and\ncynical, would reject it out of hand, and would carry residual hostility over to their\npenalty deliberations — the very kind of danger counsel sought to prevent.\n\n\n(Footnote continued from previous page.)\n\nan order entered June 27, 2013, we have taken judicial notice that sunset occurred\nin Fullerton on July 13, 1996, at 8:04 p.m., approximately one-half hour earlier.\n\n\n\n\n                                           33\n\f       Moreover, counsel had grounds for concern that the evidence at such a trial\n— and, in particular, evidence on the issue of ―lawful duty‖ — would not\nnecessarily be limited to that adduced at the preliminary hearing. The prosecution,\nmindful of its trial duty to prove every guilt and special circumstance element\nbeyond reasonable doubt (as opposed to its preliminary hearing duty merely to\nshow sufficient evidence to warrant a trial), could be expected to enhance its\neffort to establish that Officer Burt was acting lawfully when he was killed. By\nsubmitting the special circumstance issue on the preliminary hearing transcript,\ndefendant avoided such additional proof, forced the trial court to decide whether\nthe preliminary hearing evidence alone persuaded it that ―lawful duty‖ had been\nestablished beyond reasonable doubt, and, in the event the trial court so found,\npreserved his right to argue on appeal, as he does, that this evidence was not\nlegally sufficient. (Bunnell v. Superior Court (1975) 13 Cal.3d 592, 604\n[defendant who submits cause on transcript preserves right to argue on appeal\nregarding sufficiency and legal significance of evidence]; People v. Martin (1973)\n9 Cal.3d 687, 694-695 [same].)9\n\n9       Defendant asserts that counsel, while submitting on the evidence adduced\nat the preliminary hearing, should, and if unconflicted likely would, at least have\nargued to the trial court that this evidence did not establish the ―lawful duty‖\nelement beyond a reasonable doubt. But competent, unconflicted counsel could\nconclude otherwise. Aside from an assessment that such an argument was\nunlikely to succeed, counsel could fear it would cause the prosecution to seek the\nopportunity to adduce further evidence on this issue. Even if defendant was\nwilling to submit his cause on the evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing, the\nprosecution was not necessarily compelled to agree to such a procedure. Had the\nPeople been alerted to a claim that, in fact, their showing at the preliminary\nhearing failed to meet the reasonable-doubt standard on any guilt or special\ncircumstance element, no reason of fairness or logic suggests they were foreclosed\nfrom insisting on the right to present further evidence, whether before the court or\na jury, to bolster their case. (But cf., People v. Ernst (1994) 8 Cal.4th 441, 446-\n447 [prosecution may not exercise its right to jury trial over defendant‘s plea of\n                                                         (Footnote continued on next page.)\n\n\n                                         34\n\f        The record on appeal does not disclose that counsel failed to weigh the\npossibility of further litigating the ―illegal stop‖ issue, that competent,\nunconflicted counsel would likely have pursued such a strategy, or that any\nconflict of interest actually influenced his counsel‘s decision not to do so.\nAccordingly, defendant has not demonstrated counsel‘s conflict-related adverse\nperformance in this respect.\n\n                  b. Penalty phase strategy.\n        Defendant urges the record includes ―circumstantial evidence‖ that counsel,\ninfluenced by their conflict of interest, performed adversely with respect to the\npenalty trial by failing to challenge the prosecution‘s aggravating evidence, by\nomitting to inform him fully about potentially available mitigating evidence, by\nacceding to his wishes to present no mitigating evidence or argument, and by\nmaking an insufficient effort to dissuade him from taking the stand to invite a\ndeath sentence. Indeed, he suggests, the record permits an inference that counsel\nactually encouraged his decision not to fight for his life. We disagree.\n\n                        i. Failure to challenge aggravating evidence.\n        Defendant urges that his attorneys, burdened by a conflict of interest,\nperformed adversely to his interests at the penalty trial by failing to conduct more\nthan desultory cross-examination of prosecution witnesses, by making few\nobjections to evidence, by stipulating to various facts, and by failing to dispute the\n\n\n\n\n(Footnote continued from previous page.)\n\nguilty].) As noted in the text, the strategy chosen by counsel avoided this pitfall,\nkept open the possibility the trial court would find the preliminary hearing\nevidence unpersuasive, and, if the court failed to do so, preserved defendant‘s\nright to raise an insufficient-evidence claim on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\fprosecution‘s claim that defendant carjacked and kidnapped Robert Bachand\nduring a vehicle test drive.\n       However, we have made clear that ―[s]uch matters as whether objections\nshould be made and the manner of cross-examination are within counsel‘s\ndiscretion and rarely implicate ineffective assistance of counsel.‖ (People v.\nMcDermott (2002) 28 Cal.4th 946, 993; see People v. Bolin (1998) 18 Cal.4th 297,\n334.) Defendant points to no exculpatory or impeachment evidence that further\nexamination would have elicited. ― ‗We cannot evaluate alleged deficiencies in\ncounsel‘s representation solely on defendant‘s unsubstantiated speculation.‘ ‖\n(Bolin, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 334, quoting People v. Cox (1991) 53 Cal.3d 618,\n662, fn. omitted.) Nor does such unsubstantiated speculation allow us to infer that\nunconflicted counsel would likely have acted differently.\n       In particular, defendant suggests counsel knew of grounds to challenge the\nBachand carjacking evidence and, if competent and unconflicted, would likely\nhave mounted such a challenge. As support for this contention, defendant points\nto his own courtroom outburst during the testimony of Bachand, an automobile\nsalesman. When Bachand recounted that two men, of whom defendant was the\ntaller, approached him with a request to test drive a 1996 Honda Prelude,\ndefendant interrupted to shout, ―This is fucking bullshit. What the fuck am I going\nto carjack a piece of shit Honda? [¶] If I were in the car I would have wasted your\nfucking ass, it would have been stupid.‖ When Bachand said to defendant, ―You\nhad your chance,‖ defendant asserted, ―You fucking ass, I will put something\non.‖10 Defendant also points to Attorney Peters‘s statement at the hearing on the\n\n\n10    A few moments later, Bachand said that after he was handcuffed at\ngunpoint and forced to lie down in the carjacked vehicle‘s back seat, defendant\nwarned him to cooperate in handing over his ATM card and PIN number because\n                                                         (Footnote continued on next page.)\n\n\n                                         36\n\fautomatic motion for modification of the death verdict that he had tried to\npersuade the prosecutor not to present the carjacking incident ―because I knew\nfrom my own investigation that [defendant] was not good for [i.e., did not do]\nthat.‖\n         But nothing in the record passages defendant cites is evidence that\nundermines the prosecution‘s proof of the carjacking incident. In response to\ncareful questioning by the prosecutor and the court, Bachand positively identified\ndefendant as the taller man who requested the test drive and later participated in\nabducting him at gunpoint. The record discloses no ground to conclude that any\nevidence to discredit this testimony existed, that defendant‘s counsel knew or\nshould have known of such evidence, or that counsel would likely have produced\nit if competent and unconflicted. Defendant‘s claim must be rejected.\n\n                        ii. Failure to pursue mitigating evidence.\n         Defendant next urges that, in one respect, the record indicates counsel\nfailed in their duty to investigate and present to the client potentially significant\nmitigating evidence before acceding to his wishes not to offer it in mitigation.\n(See, e.g., Douglas v. Woodford (9th Cir. 2003) 316 F.3d 1079, 1089-1090.)\nDefendant points to his counsel‘s representations that his girlfriend, Victoria\nPham, had said his behavior became more violent after a near-fatal auto accident;\nas a result, according to counsel, the defense psychologist, Dr. Veronica Thomas,\nrecommended neuropsychological tests, and perhaps an MRI or CAT scan, to\n\n\n(Footnote continued from previous page.)\n\n― ‗[y]ou don‘t know who you are messing with‘ ‖ and ― ‗we‘re Asian, Vietnamese\nMafia.‘ ‖ At this point, defendant interrupted again to say, ―Asian Mafia, stupid\nfuck.‖\n\n\n\n\n                                            37\n\fdetermine whether defendant had sustained brain damage. Defendant notes that\ncounsel‘s billing records fail to indicate that Dr. Thomas, or any other qualified\nmental health expert, ever conducted such tests, and we must thus assume they\nwere not performed.\n       But even if we so assume, the record discloses no basis to conclude\ncounsel‘s failure to pursue this line of inquiry, and to advise defendant of the\nresults before agreeing not to present them, was deficient performance influenced\nby their asserted conflict of interest. To the extent the record sheds any light at all\non the subject, it suggests a different explanation.\n       In mid-1999, over eight months before the actual commencement of the\npenalty trial, counsel represented that they intended to pursue testing for brain\ndamage, and were preparing to do so, as a priority matter, subject to approval of\nthe necessary funding. However, the record contains circumstantial evidence that\nthe defense team, including Dr. Thomas, thereafter became absorbed in an effort\nto deal with defendant‘s increasing anger and emotional instability caused, in part,\nby the restrictive conditions of his federal confinement. There are indications that\nthis anger and instability, resulting in defendant‘s lack of cooperation with Dr.\nThomas, may be the ultimate reason why such tests were never administered.\n       As discussed in greater detail in part A.4.c below, defendant, following his\nfederal conviction, was held in federal detention pending his trial on these state\ncapital charges. He was subject to the harsh confinement conditions dictated by\nhis federal plea agreement. His subsequent serious rule violations while confined\nled to even more severe restrictions imposed by the federal district court and his\nfederal jailors. In the months and weeks preceding his state trial, he was kept\nunder constant surveillance, and in essential isolation, except for access to the\ndefense team.\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\f       During this period, and through the commencement of the penalty trial,\ncounsel, assisted by Dr. Thomas, worked tirelessly to obtain a relaxation of these\nconditions, citing the psychological effects of defendant‘s confinement on defense\nefforts to prepare for the trial. To that end, counsel and Dr. Thomas represented in\nvarious fora that, though defendant was not incompetent, the emotional and\npsychological toll of his confinement was impairing his attitude and willingness to\ncooperate, to the extent that Dr. Thomas was ―unable to move forward‖ with her\nwork for the defense and could not complete that work.\n       Thus, though the record does not establish for certain the reason tests for\nbrain damage were never done, it does not support the inferences defendant seeks\nto draw. It fails to demonstrate that counsel‘s deficient performance, arising from\na conflict of interest, was the reason for any failure to administer the desired tests,\nor that such tests would likely have been administered but for counsel‘s conflict\nand incompetence.\n\n                    iii. Failure to present mitigating evidence and argument.\n       Next, defendant urges that counsel, influenced by their conflict of interest,\nperformed deficiently by acceding to his wish not to present available mitigating\npenalty evidence. Defendant concedes that counsel does not necessarily act\nincompetently by honoring the client‘s wishes not to present such evidence\n(People v. Lang (1989) 49 Cal.3d 991, 1031 (Lang); see People v. Howard (1992)\n1 Cal.4th 1132, 1185; People v. Edwards (1991) 54 Cal.3d 787, 811),11 but he\n\n\n11     As we explained in Lang, ―[t]he proposition that defense counsel should be\nforced to present mitigating evidence over the defendant‘s objection has been\nsoundly criticized by commentators. [Citations.] As these commentators point\nout, an attorney‘s duty of loyalty to the client means the attorney ‗should always\nremember that the decision whether to forego legally available objectives or\nmethods because of non-legal factors is ultimately for the client . . . .‘ [Citation.]\n                                                           (Footnote continued on next page.)\n\n\n                                          39\n\fasserts that counsel need not do so (see People v. Roldan, supra, 35 Cal.4th 646,\n682 [counsel, not client, has control over all but most fundamental trial decisions];\nPeople v. Welch (1999) 20 Cal.4th 701, 728-729 [same]) and should overrule a\nclient they suspect is unable to make a rational decision. Here, he asserts, his\ncounsel knew he was psychologically unstable, and sometimes irrational, as the\nresult, among other things, of his harsh confinement conditions.\n        Moreover, defendant asserts that counsel‘s decision deprived him of a\nsubstantial mitigating case, including evidence he was the illegitimate child of a\nVietnamese ―bar girl‖ and a South Vietnamese soldier, was rescued from war-torn\nVietnam at the age of four, and never again had contact with either parent until he\nsaw his father at the time of the capital trial.\n        Again, however, the record does not support defendant‘s theory that\ncounsel‘s decision, at defendant‘s own insistence, to present no mitigating penalty\nevidence stemmed from a conflict of interest. Nor does it indicate that defendant\n\n\n\n(Footnote continued from previous page.)\n\nTo require defense counsel to present mitigating evidence over the defendant‘s\nobjection would be inconsistent with an attorney‘s paramount duty of loyalty to\nthe client and would undermine the trust, essential for effective representation,\nexisting between attorney and client. Moreover, imposing such a duty could cause\nsome defendants who otherwise would not have done so to exercise their Sixth\nAmendment right of self-representation [citation] before commencement of the\nguilt phase [citations] in order to retain control over the presentation of evidence at\nthe penalty phase, resulting in a significant loss of legal protection for these\ndefendants during the guilt phase.‖ (Lang, supra, 49 Cal.3d 991, 1030-1031.) No\ndifferent standards or considerations should apply simply because, on appeal, the\ndefendant applies a ―conflict of interest‖ gloss to counsel‘s decision. As Lang\nsuggested, counsel‘s accession to the client‘s considered desire to present no\nmitigating evidence demonstrates loyalty to the client, not conflict-related\ndisloyalty.\n\n\n\n\n                                           40\n\fwas acting irrationally in seeking to present no mitigating case. On the contrary,\nthe record is replete with indications that counsel pursued evidence about the\ncircumstances of defendant‘s birth and his escape from Vietnam, and were\nprepared to present that evidence. Indeed, counsel obtained trial delays, and\nsurmounted various bureaucratic, diplomatic, and logistical difficulties, in a\nsuccessful effort to bring defendant‘s father and uncle from rural Vietnam to\ntestify on his behalf.\n       On the other hand, there are indications that defendant consistently, and\nrationally, opposed the presentation of a penalty defense, despite counsel‘s efforts\nto change his mind. Ultimately, on April 17, 2000, after the prosecution had\nrested its penalty case, counsel advised the court there would ―probably‖ not be\nany defense evidence, but that counsel would be discussing that with defendant\n―over the next day and a half.‖ Counsel indicated that ―we do have evidence\navailable, and we could use it if there is a change in mood.‖ The court obtained\ndefendant‘s agreement that counsel had advised him they were ready, willing, and\nable to present such evidence, and had ―recommended to you that it be presented.‖\nDefendant also confirmed his understanding, as advised by the court, that his\ndecision not to offer such evidence might result in the death penalty, and that if he\nprecluded such evidence, he could not blame his lawyers or otherwise complain on\nappeal about its omission.\n       On April 19, 2000, Attorney Peters advised the court that, ―for some time‖\nhe had been discussing possible penalty defenses with defendant, ―and it has been\nhis consistent wish not to defend himself for what he believes are valid moral\nreasons, and I believe that he is competent and he is thinking morally for himself.‖\nPeters indicated that defendant had threatened to ―act out,‖ such as by interrupting\nor overturning tables, if counsel acted contrary to his desires. Peters declared that\nunder these circumstances, and especially considering that the available mitigation\n\n                                         41\n\fwas probably too weak to make a difference in the penalty determination, he was\nmaking a ―conscious decision‖ to do as defendant asked.\n       The court then engaged defendant in another extended colloquy about his\ndecisions not to present mitigating evidence or argument, and to testify personally.\nAt the court‘s prompting, defendant again indicated he understood that counsel\nhad mitigating evidence, were prepared to present it, and wanted to do so.\nDefendant confirmed he did not wish counsel to present such evidence. The court\nreminded defendant that, even if he offered no evidence, his lawyers, if allowed to\nspeak on his behalf, could possibly ―present different arguments to the jurors that\nmight be favorable to you. And precluding [counsel] from that is another step\ntowards the death penalty.‖ Defendant separately confirmed he wished to\npreclude counsel from arguing the case.\n       Explaining his position on these issues, defendant insisted he was ―not\nsuicidal,‖ but this was ―something I need to do,‖ something ―important‖ and\n―right‖ that seemed ―necessary.‖ Defendant said he was ―not looking at this [in] a\nway everyone else here is looking at it. I feel I am competent, I can do this, and\nI would appreciate my lawyer not to say anything.‖\n       Attorney Peters asked defendant whether, as Peters had told the court two\ndays earlier, defendant intended to ―act out‖ if counsel tried to present an\nargument. Defendant said he would do so, albeit reluctantly. On this basis, Peters\nagain indicated he was making a ―conscious decision‖ to proceed as defendant\nrequested. Peters declared he would rather have defendant ―say his [piece] to the\njury‖ than display disruptive behavior to the jurors if counsel tried to overrule him.\n       In his testimony to the jury, defendant further explained his attitudes. He\ntold the jurors he had asked his lawyers not to speak on his behalf, and he\n―appreciate[d]‖ their cooperation in that regard. He said that his personal code\ndemanded ―two eyes for every eye‖; that under such a code, the maximum penalty\n\n                                          42\n\fwas ―properly suited for this occasion‖ and was ―the right thing for [the jurors] to\ndo‖; that ―there‘s a price to pay for everything in life‖; and that, ―as part of the\ngame,‖ it was time he paid the price.\n       Thus, all record indications are that the omission of mitigating evidence\nwas the result of defendant‘s clear, consistent, cogent, and articulately expressed\nwish to forego such evidence for moral and ethical reasons. There is no basis to\nconclude that this decision stemmed from any conflict of interest adversely\naffecting counsel‘s performance or that counsel, if unconflicted, would likely have\nacted differently.12 Defendant essentially urges that counsel, and the court, were\nobliged to ensure defendant received a penalty defense whether he wanted one or\nnot, but such is not the case. (E.g., Lang, supra, 49 Cal.3d 991, 1030-1031; see\nalso pt. E, post.) Similar considerations apply to defendant‘s argument that\nconflict-free counsel would and should have overridden defendant‘s wish that\ncounsel present no argument to the jury on his behalf. Defendant‘s contrary\nclaims lacks merit.\n\n                      iv. Defendant’s testimony.\n       Nor is there merit to defendant‘s claim that competent, unconflicted\ncounsel could, should, and likely would have raised valid objections to\ndefendant‘s testimony inviting the death penalty. A defendant, of course, has the\n\n\n12     Defendant urges that the adverse conflict-related influence on Attorney\nPeters‘s willingness not to present mitigating evidence in this case is\ncircumstantially demonstrated by the fact that, in at least one other capital trial,\nPeters did present mitigating evidence against his client‘s wishes. (See Douglas v.\nWoodford, supra, 316 F.3d 1049, 1087-1090 [finding, despite client‘s lack of\ncooperation, that Peters conducted inadequate mental and social history\ninvestigation, and noting that Peters had presented some sociological evidence\nthough client did not wish him to do so].) Unaware of the full circumstances in\nthe other case, we are unwilling to draw the strained inference defendant proposes.\n\n\n\n                                           43\n\fabsolute right to give such testimony, even against his counsel‘s wishes.\n(People v. Nakahara (2003) 30 Cal.4th 705, 719 (Nakahara); People v. Webb\n(1993) 6 Cal.4th 494, 534-535 (Webb); People v. Guzman (1988) 45 Cal.3d 915,\n961-963 (Guzman).)\n       Defendant cites a case decided long after his trial, People v. Lancaster\n(2007) 41 Cal.4th 50 (Lancaster), for the proposition that a defendant‘s testimony\nseeking a death sentence is irrelevant to mitigation of penalty, and may thus be\nproperly excluded. Hence, he asserts, his counsel performed adversely, as the\nresult of their conflict, by failing to raise a relevance objection to his testimony.\n       As Lancaster itself observed, however, that decision is inapposite. There,\nthe defendant, ostensibly offering testimony in mitigation, sought to invoke\npolitical and racial considerations beyond his own case by comparing his\n― ‗wrongful[ ] convict[ion]‘ ‖ to that of Mumia Abu-Jamal, by suggesting that\nAfrican-American men who stand up and fight for their rights are labeled\n― ‗crazy,‘ ‖ and by asserting that ― ‗[t]hey experiment on black people.‘ ‖\n(Lancaster, supra, 41 Cal.4th 50, 101.) The trial court sustained the prosecutor’s\nrelevance objections to this testimony. We found no error, holding that the\ndefendant‘s assertions impermissibly strayed beyond the pertinent factors in\nmitigation, i.e., the circumstances of his own offense and his own character and\nbackground. (Id., at pp. 101-102, & cases cited.)\n       In doing so, Lancaster rejected the defendant‘s reliance on Webb‘s\nstatement that ― ‗a defendant‘s absolute right to testify cannot be foreclosed or\ncensored based on content.‘ ‖ (Lancaster, supra, 41 Cal.4th 50, 101-102, quoting\nWebb, supra, 6 Cal.4th 494, 535.) We indicated that ―[this] statement must be\nunderstood in context; it addressed Webb‘s contention that the trial court should\n\n\n\n\n                                           44\n\fnot have allowed him to testify in favor of a death sentence.‖ (Lancaster, supra, at\np. 102.)13 Lancaster thus made clear its holding did not undermine Webb‘s\npremise that the defendant does have the right to proffer such testimony, even over\nhis counsel‘s objections. Defendant‘s claim must be rejected.14\n\n               c. Competence to stand trial.\n       Defendant urges his counsel‘s conflict resulted in their failure to ensure that\nhe was not incompetent when he entered his ―slow plea,‖ when he was tried on the\nissue of penalty, and when he ―effectively stipulate[d]‖ to the death penalty by\npresenting no mitigating evidence or argument and by taking the stand to agree he\ndeserved execution. He asserts that his mental and emotional condition\ndeteriorated seriously before and during the penalty proceedings as a result of the\n―draconian‖ conditions of his incarceration, that his behavior made this\ndeterioration obvious, and that his counsel expressly realized his worsening mental\nand emotional state was interfering with his ability to assist in his defense.\nNonetheless, he observes, his counsel assiduously avoided claiming he was\nincompetent. They did so, defendant posits, because their concerns about their\npersonal involvement in the Nguyen murder conspiracy motivated them to curry\nfavor with prosecutors by ensuring that defendant‘s penalty trial would not be\npostponed, and that he would promptly and predictably be sentenced to death.\n\n\n\n\n13     The quoted sentence was followed by a statement that ―[t]he relevance of\n[the defendant‘s testimony in Webb] was not challenged.‖ (Lancaster, supra,\n41 Cal.4th 50, 102.) But this remark did not imply that defense counsel may raise\nsuch an objection against his own client‘s voluntary testimony.\n\n14      For similar reasons, we also find no merit to defendant‘s related argument\nthat the trial court had a sua sponte duty to prevent defendant‘s testimony.\n\n\n\n                                          45\n\f       Defendant‘s argument in this regard is closely intertwined with his related\nclaim that, based on the information available to it, the trial court erred by failing,\nsua sponte, to declare a doubt of his competence, and to order a hearing on that\nissue. Neither contention has merit.\n\n                    i.   Factual background.\n       The incompetence-related claims stem from the following facts: From the\nmoment of his federal arrest, defendant had been held in federal administrative\nsegregation, with severe limitations on his communications privileges, under the\nterms of 28 Code of Federal Regulations part 501.3 (hereafter section 501.3). This\nprovision authorizes the United States Attorney General to specify such conditions\nfor a federal prisoner or detainee whose communications would present a\nsubstantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to persons. Defendant‘s federal\nplea agreement included his stipulation that such conditions would continue for\nthe duration of his federal prison term.\n       After his federal conviction, defendant was kept in federal custody, at the\nLos Angeles Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC), under section 501.3\nconditions, pending disposition of the instant capital murder charges. Control over\nhis privileges resided with the federal district court. While he was housed in the\nMDC, and in violation of prior federal court orders, defendant was found in\npossession of a pen and pencils, and a number of forbidden written\ncommunications from defendant to other federal and state prisoners were\nintercepted. Certain of these communications included threats against the\nundercover officer who was instrumental in his federal conviction and an inmate\nin the Orange County Jail.\n       As a result of these incidents, the federal court in January 2000 imposed\nadditional restrictions on defendant‘s already severe conditions of confinement.\n\n\n\n                                           46\n\fDefendant was again prohibited from possessing writing materials; was essentially\ndenied contact with other inmates and most prison personnel; was forbidden\ntelephone communications except with counsel and, to a limited extent, with an\nelderly grandmother; and was allowed no visitors except his counsel and an aunt.\nAs implemented by MDC staff, these restrictions resulted in defendant‘s\nplacement in a sealed single cell, without radio, television, computer, or general\n(nonlegal) reading material. Two surveillance cameras kept constant watch on the\ncell‘s interior, and the cell‘s lights remained on 24 hours a day. For fear defendant\nwould use his cell toilet as a means of inmate communication, he was not allowed\nto flush the toilet; he was required to summon a guard to perform this task.\n       Defendant‘s counsel labored repeatedly, in several fora, and with limited\nsuccess, to obtain relief from these restrictions. In these efforts, counsel insisted\nthat while defendant had not become incompetent, the isolation, stress, and\nsensory deprivation of his confinement were causing his emotional and mental\ncondition to deteriorate, thus interfering with defense preparation for the trial.\n       As early as July 23, 1999, the day defendant entered his ―slow plea‖ on\nguilt and the special circumstance, counsel advised the court of defendant‘s\nisolation and restrictions at the MDC, alluding to the ―horrendous‖ emotional\neffects of these conditions. On July 30, 1999, counsel moved to continue the\npenalty trial date, then scheduled for August 9, 1999, to late September or early\nOctober 1999. Among other reasons, the written motion pointed to defendant‘s\nsevere confinement conditions as then in effect, noting that ―[t]his intensive\nconfinement and isolation has a very negative impact on his mental health,‖\n―interfere[s] with [his] ability to organize his thoughts[,] and results in very hostile\nemotion.‖\n       On October 8, 1999, the court held a hearing to determine what issues\nrequired resolution before commencement of the penalty trial, then scheduled for\n\n                                          47\n\fOctober 18. Among the matters addressed on October 8 were counsel‘s\ndifficulties in transporting defendant‘s father and uncle from Vietnam, and\ncourtroom security measures, including the possibility of physical restraints on\ndefendant and screening procedures for other persons entering the courtroom.\nAfter discussion, the court announced a tentative decision that it would not\n―wand‖ prospective jurors, but would ―wand‖ everyone else, i.e., ―anybody that\ndoesn‘t have a juror band,‖ before allowing them to enter.\n       At this point, defendant interrupted, insisting that if ―you wand my people,\nyou are going to wand everybody,‖ and that the court should not demonstrate\n―prejudice[ ]‖ by ―separat[ing] my side from their side and all that other shit.‖\nWhen the court repeated that it intended to ―wand‖ everybody who came into the\ngallery, i.e., observers, defendant said, ―Fuck it, don‘t wand anybody. If you have\na problem with me, say so.‖ When the court responded that it had no problem,\ndefendant continued, ―I have done what I need to this court, and this court is going\nto rush me into this, what kind of bullshit is that? Fucking nothing is going to be\ndone on the 18th, if we are going to say anything . . . .‖ When the judge told\ndefendant to ―get it out of your system,‖ defendant retorted, ―Play fucking games\nand we will play fucking games.‖ At a subsequent hearing on October 18, 1999,\nafter granting a defense motion to continue the trial, the court warned defendant\nthat further outbursts like the one on October 8 would result in his removal from\nthe courtroom for the duration.\n       On February 4, 2000, counsel informed the court of the increased federal\nconfinement restrictions imposed in January. Counsel indicated that although\ndefendant was psychologically ―tough‖ and ―strong,‖ there was concern about the\nimpact on him of ―this virtual total isolation and lack of stimulation.‖\n       On February 25, 2000, the trial court attempted several times to obtain\ndefendant‘s time waiver so the penalty trial could be continued from March 13,\n\n                                         48\n\f2000, to April 3, 2000. Each time, defendant professed not to understand and said\nhe needed time to talk to his lawyers. The court said ―[g]o ahead,‖ noting that\ndefendant‘s principal counsel, Peters, was present. However, defendant insisted\nPeters was only one of his attorneys and indicated he ―need[ed] two.‖ During the\nproceeding, Peters explained that defendant ―is very agitated this morning,‖ likely\nbecause of the stress of his isolated confinement. Counsel asserted that\ndefendant‘s condition ―interferes with the ability to deal with him on a rational\nbasis, but I am not saying he is 1368 [i.e., incompetent], if he was, I would tell\nyou, of course, my obligation.‖15\n       On March 2, 2000, the trial court held an Evidence Code section 402\nhearing on defendant‘s conditions of confinement and their effect on penalty trial\npreparation. Among other things, the court heard testimony from Dr. Thomas, the\nclinical psychologist retained by the defense to assist in determining defendant‘s\ncompetency and to help develop mitigating penalty evidence.\n       Assessing a recent visit with defendant, Dr. Thomas indicated that, because\nof his disappointment over the harsh federal sentencing of Victoria Pham, the\nwithdrawal of his privilege to communicate with Pham, and the other conditions\nof his current confinement, he had become emotionally unstable and distrustful of\nthe defense team. According to Dr. Thomas, defendant was ―alternately enraged\nand kind of irrational,‖ and his ―emotional lability‖ was ―impairing the process of\nthe defense all the way around.‖ Dr. Thomas cautioned that defendant ―was\ncertainly not out of touch with reality at all, and certainly not unable to discuss,‖\nbut she agreed with defense counsel that ―some aspects of this custodial situation\n\n\n15    The reference is to section 1368, which sets forth the circumstances in\nwhich trial proceedings must be suspended pending a determination of the\ndefendant‘s mental competence.\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\fare causing [defendant‘s] emotions . . . , on a too frequent basis, to override his\njudgment.‖\n       Dr. Thomas acknowledged that defendant was intelligent, a violent\nsociopath, and a security risk whose own threats and rule violations had prompted\nthe current restrictions. Indeed, she agreed with the prosecutor that, in his anger\nand frustration, defendant had ―articulated feelings [of] wanting to kill people . . .\ninclud[ing] prosecutors, witnesses, judges, [and] the lieutenant at the holding\nfacility.‖ Nonetheless, she opined that a continuation of the current confinement\nconditions would cause defendant‘s ―ability to think clearly . . . to diminish,‖ that\n―it is not going to get any better,‖ and that she was ―unable to move forward at this\ntime‖ with her work for the defense. Later that same day, Attorney Peters\nrepresented in federal court that defendant was ―not incompetent, but he‘s\nbumping up against that sort of thing.‖\n       At a pretrial hearing on March 29, 2000, Attorney Peters noted that, though\nhe was prepared to put on mitigating penalty evidence, ―we have for some time\ntalked about putting no penalty evidence on.‖ However, Peters cautioned,\ndefendant ―needs to be in a situation where he can make rational decisions about\nthis‖ and indicated defendant‘s conditions of federal confinement were interfering\nwith that process. Accordingly, Peters indicated, he intended to seek relief in the\nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals from the federal district court‘s harsh confinement\norders. Peters declared that ―if I wanted to play games I could declare him 1368\nor something, but I don‘t believe he is 1368, he is just in a very difficult situation.‖\n       On March 30, 2000, as promised, counsel filed a petition for writ of\nmandate and stay in the federal appeals court. (Hung Thanh Mai v. United States\nDistrict Court, Central District of California (9th Cir. No. 0-70364).) The petition\nsought both an easing of defendant‘s confinement conditions and an order\npostponing the state capital penalty trial until his mental state improved and\n\n                                          50\n\fstabilized. The petition asserted that while defendant was not incompetent, the\npsychological effects of his confinement had led to ―a breakdown in the attorney\nclient relationship,‖ and to counsel‘s inability ―to effectively communicate with\n[him]‖ The Ninth Circuit denied the petition on April 7, 2000.\n       On April 11, 2000, while selection of the penalty jury in the instant case\nwas in progress, counsel filed a petition for mandate and stay in the California\nCourt of Appeal, Fourth District, Division Three. (Hung Thanh Mai v. Superior\nCourt of Orange County, G027290.) The petition sought a writ directing the trial\ncourt to order defendant‘s transfer from the MDC to the Orange County Jail\npending the trial, and a restraint on further trial proceedings. According to the\npetition, defendant‘s conditions of federal confinement were so restrictive that he\n―has become increasing[ly] unstable, to a point where [he] is having great\ndifficulty assisting his Counsel in the defense of his case.‖ The petition cited Dr.\nThomas‘s conclusions that, due to the ―dehumanizing‖ circumstances of\ndefendant‘s federal confinement, he ―is becoming extremely volatile‖ and ―cannot\nthink clearly,‖ and that, as a consequence, Dr. Thomas could not complete her\npenalty phase work. The Court of Appeal denied the petition the same day.\n       Jury selection was completed on the afternoon of April 11, 2000, and a jury\nwas sworn. Prior to adjournment, after the jurors had been dismissed for the day,\nthe court stated it had reviewed allegations in the Ninth Circuit writ proceeding\nthat defendant‘s confinement conditions had caused him to become mentally\nunstable, such that his psychologist and attorneys were unable to prepare him for\ntrial. The court said it wished ―to note [its] observations for the record. The\ndefendant has appeared in this courtroom on April 3rd, April 6th, April 10th, and\nApril the 11th during jury selection. [¶] He has attentively followed roll call page\nby page. He has read questionnaires and reviewed prospective juror lists. He has\nmade notes. He has appeared to consult with both his counsel concerning the lists\n\n                                         51\n\fand questionnaires. I note that he has assisted Mr. Peters [defense counsel] in the\nexercise of peremptory challenges. [¶] He has not given an appearance of being\nnervous or upset. On the contrary, he has appeared to be rather calm and collected\nduring this four-day time frame.‖\n       Counsel responded that, as confirmed by Dr. Thomas, defendant was\nexperiencing various physiological symptoms, that he was overreacting to the\nsmallest difficulties, and that the frustration produced by his confinement\nconditions meant he ―can‘t be objective‖ in dealing with the defense team.\nCounsel also alluded to an ―outburst‖ that morning which had required a delay\nuntil counsel could ―calm [defendant] down.‖\n       On the other hand, counsel reiterated that ―if [defendant] was 1368, I‘d say\nthat, I am not doing that because that would be a game, and I am not here to play\ngames.‖ ―[A]ll we are saying,‖ counsel insisted, was that the harsh confinement\nconditions were ―bound to have an effect on somebody. Especially somebody\nfacing the death penalty.‖\n       The next morning, April 12, 2000, the court noted, in a chambers\ndiscussion with counsel, that defendant had refused to come out of his cell at the\nMDC unless ordered by the court to do so. Once transported to Orange County\nand placed in the court‘s holding cell, the court observed, defendant ―has been so\nloud that you can almost hear it in the courtroom.‖\n       Defense Counsel Peters indicated that defendant ―has good reason to yell\nand scream,‖ but was now calm. Counsel said his experience was that ―[a]fter a\npoint in time [defendant] is able to vocalize enough of his anger that he gets back\nto some sort of rationality.‖ Counsel indicated defendant was upset because,\nseveral days earlier, he had seen the court clerk give coffee to the victim‘s family\nmembers, which made him feel he was not on neutral ground, and was also irate\nbecause his federal jailors had reneged on a promise to provide his lunch. Counsel\n\n                                         52\n\fagain indicated that defendant was not ―1368,‖ but was very upset and emotionally\n―volatil[e],‖ and had limited control over his behavior.\n       The court asked if defendant had complaints about a biased jury — a\nconcern the bailiff had reported. Again the court indicated ―the record should\nreflect I sat there and watched him exercise 20 peremptories through his counsel.‖\nCounsel said this was not the issue, and insisted that defendant was not trying to\nobstruct or delay. Counsel indicated that defendant well understood the reality of\nhis legal situation and ―knows what the [probable] outcome is,‖ particularly since\n―we may put on no defense, and the evidence is overwhelming and awfully\nbrutal.‖ According to counsel, this reality, and defendant‘s isolated confinement,\nwere precisely why small problems like the lunch issue became ―magnified‖ and\n―drive [defendant] crazy.‖ The court admonished counsel to remind defendant of\nthe court‘s prior warnings that it would not tolerate his ―disruptive conduct‖ and\n―foul language,‖ and that further outbursts or disruption would result in his\nexclusion from the trial.\n       Proceedings briefly resumed, but almost immediately, the court met with\ncounsel again in the hallway, out of defendant‘s presence. Defense Counsel Peters\nsaid defendant was concerned he might not be able to control himself in the\ncourtroom, and had therefore asked to be shackled to prevent him from ―act[ing]\nout.‖ Peters explained that when defendant first met with counsel that morning,\n―he was talking how he was going to act up, that he had nothing to lose, which is\ntrue.‖ Peters indicated there appeared to be grounds to accede to defendant‘s\nwishes ―for his safety and my safety and [Cocounsel O‘Connell‘s] safety.‖ Still,\nPeters observed, while he did not ―think [shackling] would be extremely\nprejudicial,‖ he would try to dissuade defendant if he believed otherwise. The\nprosecutor indicated he had no objection to the request, and the court granted it,\nordering that, while in court, defendant be restrained in ―Martin waist chains.‖\n\n                                         53\n\f       Defendant was brought into the courtroom, and the jurors were summoned.\nAs the court began to speak to the jury, defendant interrupted to say, ―Next time\nyou smile, throw a bigger smile my way.‖ The following colloquy ensued: ―THE\nCOURT: Pardon me, Mr. Mai? [¶] THE DEFENDANT: I am speaking to the\nBurt family, they want to be smart asses. [¶] THE COURT: Don‘t be speaking to\nthe Burt family. [¶] THE DEFENDANT: That‘s right.‖\n       As the court resumed addressing the jury, defendant again interrupted,\nstating that he ―need[ed] a break‖ and ―need[ed] to say something.‖ When the\ncourt told him to be quiet, defendant implored Defense Counsel Peters to ―speak\nup for me.‖ After a discussion with defendant, Peters explained to the court that\ndefendant ―just wanted to be assured it was your order that he be here this\nmorning.‖ When the court responded that it had so ordered, defendant asked, ―If\nyou have the power to do that, why don‘t you have the power to do anything\nelse?‖ The court advised defendant his counsel was speaking and warned\ndefendant not to disrupt, whereupon defendant requested that Peters ―ask [the\ncourt] if you have the power to do that, why don‘t you have the power to do other\nstuff?‖ Peters indicated he would make such an inquiry ―[a]t the appropriate\ntime,‖ and the court warned defendant again against further disruption.16\n       A short while later in the morning of April 12, 2000, the prosecutor was\noutlining for the jury the evidence he expected to produce about the incident on\nthe morning of Officer Burt‘s murder in which defendant brandished a handgun at\nanother driver on the freeway. Defendant interrupted to say, ―And I would do it\n\n\n16     Defendant‘s question is sensibly understood as asking why, if the court had\nthe authority to order him transported from the MDC to attend the trial, it did not\nalso have the authority to order that his conditions of confinement in that facility\nbe relaxed.\n\n\n\n                                         54\n\fagain.‖ The court ordered defendant to face toward the bench, and defendant\nresponded, ―Right.‖\n       On April 17, 2000, defendant disrupted the testimony of Mark Baker, who\nstated that, in September 1995, he witnessed a violent domestic altercation\nbetween defendant and Victoria Pham outside their apartment. When Baker\ntestified that during the struggle with Pham, defendant hit her with his fist and she\nfell to her knees, defendant interrupted to shout, ―Shut the fuck up, I think you are\nfull of shit. If I fucking hit [her] with a fist, I would have knocked her fucking ass\non the floor. What are you talking about?‖ When the court attempted to admonish\ndefendant, he muttered, ―You want to say something, speak the fucking truth,‖ and\n―[b]ullshit.‖\n       Baker then testified that when he tried to stop the fight by telling defendant\nto ― ‗[k]nock it off, you motherfucker,‘ ‖ defendant went into his apartment and\nreturned with a machine gun. At this point, defendant interrupted Baker‘s\ntestimony to declare, ―I should have killed your fucking ass is what I should have\ndone, waste my goddamn time.‖\n       Shortly thereafter, automobile salesman Bachand testified that in June\n1996, defendant and an accomplice abducted him at gunpoint during the test drive\nof a Honda Prelude. As noted above, defendant interrupted to shout that\nBachand‘s testimony was ―bullshit,‖ because defendant had no incentive to steal a\n―piece of shit Honda,‖ and that if defendant had been one of the carjackers, he\nwould have ―wasted [Bachand‘s] fucking ass.‖ Moments later, when Bachand\nsaid defendant had warned that he and his companion were ―Asian, Vietnamese\nMafia,‖ defendant interrupted to mutter, ―Asian Mafia, stupid fuck.‖ The court\nadmonished defendant against further disruptions. Nonetheless, as Bachand\ncontinued his testimony, defendant overturned the counsel table and was removed\nto a detention area by the bailiffs.\n\n                                          55\n\f       On April 19, 2000, after the prosecution rested, defendant confirmed on the\nrecord that, despite his counsel‘s advice and wishes, he declined to present any\nmitigating evidence, opposed any effort by his counsel to speak in his behalf, and\nintended to testify about his opinion of the appropriate penalty. The court warned\ndefendant that he was acting unwisely, that he could not appeal a resulting death\nsentence on grounds of incompetence or attorney error, and that these decisions\nwere tantamount to suicide. In response, defendant insisted that he was ―not\nsuicidal,‖ felt he was competent, and was ―just doing the right thing that I feel\nthat‘s necessary.‖\n       Defendant confirmed he would ―act out‖ if counsel exercised their\nprerogative to present an argument, though ―[i]t is not something I want to do.‖ In\nresponse to a query from the court, defendant indicated he assumed his\nunderstanding with his counsel was ―pretty firm.‖ He iterated that ―I just feel this\nis right, and I am hoping my lawyer agrees to that.‖ On this basis, as noted above,\ncounsel announced he would accede to defendant‘s wishes.\n\n                     ii. Applicable law.\n       ― ‗Both the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . and state\nlaw prohibit the state from trying or convicting a criminal defendant while he or\nshe is mentally incompetent. (§ 1367; Drope v. Missouri (1975) 420 U.S. 162,\n181; Pate v. Robinson (1966) 383 U.S. 375, 384-386; People v. Ramos (2004)\n34 Cal.4th 494, 507.) A defendant is incompetent to stand trial if he or she lacks a\n― ‗sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of\nrational understanding — [or lacks] . . . a rational as well as a factual\nunderstanding of the proceedings against him.‘ ‖ (Dusky v. United States (196[0])\n362 U.S. 402, 402; see also Godinez v. Moran (1993) 509 U.S. 389, 399-400;\n\n\n\n\n                                           56\n\fPeople v. Stewart (2004) 33 Cal.4th 425, 513.)‘ (People v. Rogers (2006)\n39 Cal.4th 826, 846-847.)‖ (People v. Lewis (2008) 43 Cal.4th 415, 524 (Lewis).)\n       Under both the federal Constitution and state law, the trial court must\nsuspend criminal proceedings and conduct a competency hearing if presented with\nsubstantial evidence that the defendant is incompetent. (People v. Elliott (2012)\n53 Cal.4th 535, 583 (Elliott); People v. Ary (2011) 51 Cal.4th 510, 517; People v.\nRogers, supra, 39 Cal.4th 826, 847 (Rogers).) Substantial evidence of\nincompetence exists when a qualified mental health expert who has examined the\ndefendant states under oath, and ―with particularity,‖ a professional opinion that\nbecause of mental illness, the defendant is incapable of understanding the purpose\nor nature of the criminal proceedings against him, or of cooperating with counsel.\n(Lewis, supra, 43 Cal.4th 415, 525; People v. Stankewitz (1982) 32 Cal.3d 80, 92.)\n       The defendant‘s demeanor and irrational behavior may also, in proper\ncircumstances, constitute substantial evidence of incompetence. (Rogers, supra,\n39 Cal.4th 826, 847.) However, disruptive conduct and courtroom outbursts by\nthe defendant do not necessarily demonstrate a present inability to understand the\nproceedings or assist in the defense. (E.g., Elliott, supra, 53 Cal.4th 535, 583;\nLewis, supra, 43 Cal.4th 415, 525-526; People v. Medina (1995) 11 Cal.4th 694,\n735 (Medina).)\n       Counsel‘s assertion of a belief in a client‘s incompetence is entitled to some\nweight. But unless the court itself has declared a doubt as to the defendant‘s\ncompetence, and has asked for counsel‘s opinion on the subject, counsel‘s\nassertion that his or her client is or may be incompetent does not, in the absence of\nsubstantial evidence to that effect, require the court to hold a competency hearing.\n(§ 1368; Lewis, supra, 43 Cal.4th 415, 525; People v. Rodrigues (1994) 8 Cal.4th\n1060, 1111-1112; People v. Howard, supra, 1 Cal.4th 1132, 1163-1164.)\n\n\n\n                                         57\n\f        By the same token, and absent a showing of ―incompetence‖ that is\n―substantial‖ as a matter of law, the trial judge‘s decision not to order a\ncompetency hearing is entitled to great deference, because the trial court is in the\nbest position to observe the defendant during trial. (Rogers, supra, 39 Cal.4th 826,\n847.) ― ‗An appellate court is in no position to appraise a defendant‘s conduct in\nthe trial court as indicating insanity, a calculated attempt to feign insanity and\ndelay the proceedings, or sheer temper.‘ [Citations.]‖ (People v. Danielson\n(1992) 3 Cal.4th 691, 727.)\n\n                    iii. Discussion.\n        Here, the record discloses no basis to conclude that counsel, driven by a\nconflict of interest, avoided seeking a competency hearing even though they\nbelieved defendant was incompetent. Nor are there grounds to infer that\nunconflicted counsel would likely have sought such a hearing. Indeed, as we\nexplain hereafter, the record contains no substantial evidence of defendant‘s\nincompetence. Reasonably interpreted, it suggests counsel had a difficult client\nwhose own calculated acts had resulted in his severe conditions of confinement,\nand whose frustration with the terms of his custody contributed to his anger,\nemotional volatility, distrust of counsel, and frequent lack of cooperation with\nthem.\n        Counsel worked assiduously to ease these custodial conditions, urging in\nseveral fora, and by vigorous advocacy, that the resulting emotional toll on\ndefendant was seriously interfering with defense efforts. But the record does not\nindicate that, contrary to counsel‘s consistent representations, they knew or should\nhave known defendant‘s confinement had rendered him mentally unable, rather\nthan emotionally unwilling, to help with his defense. We have frequently\n\n\n\n\n                                          58\n\frecognized the distinction, as counsel apparently did, and have made clear that an\nuncooperative attitude is not, in and of itself, substantial evidence of\nincompetence. (See, e.g., Elliott, supra, 53 Cal.4th 535, 583; Lewis, supra,\n43 Cal.4th 415, 526; Medina, supra, 11 Cal.4th 694, 735; People v. Davis (1995)\n10 Cal.4th 463, 527-528.)\n       Significantly, the defense psychologist, Dr. Thomas, never declared ―with\nparticularity‖ that, as the result of a mental disorder or disability, defendant was\nunable to understand the proceedings or assist rationally in his defense. On the\ncontrary, she acknowledged defendant‘s intelligence, indicated he was ―not out of\ntouch with reality at all,‖ and agreed he was ―certainly able to discuss‖ his legal\nsituation. She suggested simply that the emotional instability stemming from his\ncustodial status sometimes caused him to be ―kind of irrational,‖ affected his\n―ability to think clearly,‖ and made it difficult to obtain his cooperation.\n       Counsel made similar representations in court, additionally noting that\ndefendant understood the reality of his legal situation, and that once allowed to\nfully vocalize his anger and frustration, he was usually able to calm down and\nbehave rationally. Counsel‘s concession that these circumstances did not amount\nto mental incompetence does not indicate counsel performed adversely as the\nresult of a conflict of interest.\n       Defendant‘s ―self-defeating‖ outbursts in court also do not constitute\nevidence that should and likely would have persuaded competent, unconflicted\ncounsel to seek a competency hearing. These episodes demonstrated that\ndefendant was often angry and resentful. But, as noted above, disruptive behavior\nis not substantial evidence of incompetence unless, by its particular nature, it casts\ndoubt on the defendant‘s ability to assist in his or her defense. (E.g., Elliott,\nsupra, 53 Cal.4th 535, 583; Medina, supra, 11 Cal.4th 694, 735.) Here, aside\n\n\n                                          59\n\ffrom one incident of momentary confusion over a time waiver, defendant‘s\ncourtroom demeanor, words, and conduct never indicated he did not understand\nthe proceedings or was actually unable to assist his lawyers.\n       Indeed, defendant‘s anger and resentment were often connected in an\nunderstandable way to the trial proceedings. Thus, defendant protested when he\nthought he was being rushed to trial, or worried that the court‘s security measures\nmight discriminate against ―my people,‖ or feared that court personnel were too\nsolicitous of the victim‘s family, or reacted to witnesses who were giving\ndamaging testimony against him. Defendant appeared capable of speaking up\nwhen he felt the need to consult with his lawyers in light of courtroom\ndevelopments, and, at one point, he asked pertinent questions about the court‘s\nauthority over the conditions of his confinement.\n       Moreover, after reviewing allegations that the conditions of defendant‘s\nconfinement were seriously affecting his mental and emotional state, the trial court\nmade clear on the record that its observations of defendant did not indicate\nincompetence. In particular, the court noted that defendant had calmly, but\nactively, participated in the extended process of jury selection, reviewing\nquestionnaires and juror lists, making notes, and assisting counsel in the exercise\nof peremptory challenges. In sum, certain of defendant‘s behavior, as disclosed by\nthe record, was rude, disruptive, and even menacing, but this behavior afforded no\nsubstantial grounds upon which unconflicted counsel should and likely would\nhave pursued a claim of incompetence.\n       We reach a similar conclusion with respect to defendant‘s consistent and\nfirmly stated intention to dispense with mitigating evidence, present no argument,\nand invite the jury to impose a judgment of death. A wish for the death penalty,\nand an insistence on presenting no penalty defense, are not, by themselves,\nevidence of incompetence sufficient to trigger competency proceedings. (E.g.,\n\n                                         60\n\fPeople v. Blair (2005) 36 Cal.4th 686, 718; People v. Ramos, supra, 34 Cal.4th\n494, 509.) Defendant made clear he understood the consequences of his decision,\nand he expressed his reasons coherently, even eloquently, to the jury. He\nexplained he was motivated by reluctance to beg in court for sympathy or pity, by\nhis personal code of ―two eyes for every eye,‖ and by his belief that, as ―part of\nthe game,‖ the time had come to pay in full for his murder of Officer Burt. These\nwell-stated moral sentiments in no way belied a mental ability to understand the\nproceedings and to assist in defending them. Defendant‘s attitude is not\nsubstantial evidence he was incompetent. Accordingly, it provides no ground to\nconclude that, as the result of a conflict of interest, counsel omitted to pursue a\npotentially valid incompetency claim.17\n\n17      Defendant notes Victoria Pham‘s claim that defendant became more violent\nafter a near-fatal car accident, causing the defense psychologist to suspect brain\ndamage. Citing Pate v. Robinson, supra, 383 U.S. 375, defendant urges that\nevidence of a head injury with subsequent irrationality and behavioral changes\nraises a ―red flag‖ regarding competence, and constitutes, as a matter of law,\nsufficient evidence to require a competency hearing. But the scant evidence here\ndoes not remotely compare with the evidence found in Pate to raise a bona fide\ndoubt of competence. Pate, convicted of killing his common law wife during an\nirrational episode, had a history of severe disturbance dating back to a childhood\naccident in which a brick fell on his head. His turbulent history included frequent\nepisodes of bizarre behavior, hallucinations, and delusions, a stay in a psychiatric\nhospital, and the prior killing of his 18-month-old son, after which he tried to\ncommit suicide. At his trial, four witnesses testified, without contradiction, that he\nwas insane. This evidence, in combination, persuaded the high court that Pate\nshould have received a full inquiry into his competence.\n       Here, by contrast, there is no real indication that defendant‘s sociopathic\nbehavior, whatever its cause, had any logical connection to legal incompetence.\nMoreover, the possibility of injury-related brain damage does not, in and of itself,\nsuggest inability to meet the legal standard for competence to stand trial. (See\nLewis, supra, 43 Cal.4th 415, 525; People v. Leonard (2007) 40 Cal.4th 1370,\n1415-1416.) Though offered for a different purpose, the testimony of the\npsychologist who suspected defendant‘s accident might have caused brain damage\n                                                           (Footnote continued on next page.)\n\n\n                                          61\n\f        For similar reasons, we reject defendant‘s alternative argument that the trial\ncourt had a sua sponte duty to declare a doubt of his competence, and to initiate\ncompetency proceedings. As we have explained, the record discloses no\nsubstantial evidence that defendant was mentally incompetent. No qualified\nwitness so testified; counsel‘s various descriptions of defendant‘s mental and\nemotional state did not equate to incompetence; and defendant‘s observable\nactions and decisions did not necessarily suggest he lacked the requisite ability to\nparticipate rationally in his defense. Moreover, the trial court‘s day-to-day\nobservation of defendant‘s demeanor and conduct, including his episodes of\ndisruptive behavior, did not cause the court to doubt his competence — a fact the\ncourt felt obliged to place on the record not once, but twice. Under these\ncircumstances, the court did not err by taking no action to determine whether\ndefendant was competent.\n\n                  d. Advice to defendant.\n        Finally, defendant points to comments by Attorney Peters, at various points\nin the record (never in the jury‘s presence), expressing the pessimistic view that\nthere was little realistic hope at either the guilt or penalty stages. Defendant\ncharacterizes certain of these remarks as suggesting counsel‘s personal view that\ndefendant deserved the death penalty. Such comments, defendant asserts, are\ncircumstantial evidence that counsel, burdened by their conflict of interest, advised\n\n\n\n(Footnote continued from previous page.)\n\nsuggested strongly that he was not mentally unable to understand the proceedings\nand assist rationally in his defense. Nothing in Pate convinces us that effective,\nunconflicted counsel should and likely would have used the information about\ndefendant‘s auto accident to raise a reasonable doubt of his competence.\n\n\n\n\n                                            62\n\fdefendant incompetently by overstating the hopelessness of his case, by\nsuggesting he had no viable defenses,18 and by urging him to submit the guilt and\nspecial circumstance issues and forego the presentation of mitigating evidence and\nargument at the penalty phase. Further, defendant asserts, Attorney Peters violated\nhis duties as an advocate by publicly stating his personal view that defendant\ndeserved the death penalty. (Citing, e.g., U.S. v. Swanson (9th Cir. 1991) 943 F.2d\n1070, 1074; Osborn v. Shillinger (10th Cir. 1988) 861 F.2d 612, 626; State v.\nHolland (Utah 1994) 876 P.2d 357, 358-361 & fn. 3.)\n       We are unconvinced. First, as defendant concedes, the record does not, for\nthe most part, disclose what advice counsel privately imparted to him. If anything,\nhowever, the record indicates defendant himself insisted throughout the\nproceedings, for reasons he cogently explained to the penalty jury, that once he\nwas brought to justice, his personal code of honor obliged him to pay for his\nmurder of Officer Burt without any effort to seek sympathy or mercy in a court of\nlaw. The record also contains numerous indications that his attorneys did attempt\nto get him to change his mind,19 but that he virtually coerced them to agree to his\nwishes by threatening to engage in inflammatory disruptions before the jury if they\ntried to overrule him.\n       Second, as counsel knew, there was indeed overwhelming evidence that\ndefendant gunned down a CHP officer during a routine traffic stop, ultimately\nexecuting the officer by firing a bullet into the victim‘s head at close range while\n\n18     In reality, defendant asserts, he had a strong defense to the peace officer\nspecial circumstance, on grounds he was stopped and detained illegally by Officer\nBurt. He further urges that a fully developed mitigating case, based on his escape\nfrom Vietnam, his cultural difficulties in adjusting to life in the United States, and\nhis possible brain damage, might well have persuaded a jury to spare his life.\n19     As Attorney Peters stated at the hearing on the automatic motion to modify\nthe death verdict, ―we spent hundreds of hours talking about that topic.‖\n\n\n\n                                          63\n\fhe lay helpless. Counsel could also reasonably conclude that a fact finder,\nwhether court or jury, would likely be unpersuaded by a special circumstance\ndefense that questioned the legality of the traffic stop. And, though a death\njudgment was not inevitable, neither the facts of the capital crime nor the violent\nand obstreperous personality defendant displayed during the penalty trial were\nlikely to engender sympathy with a jury deciding the issue of life or death.\n       Under these difficult circumstances, the record discloses no ground to\nconclude that counsel rendered adverse or deficient assistance if they advised\ndefendant to preserve credibility at a penalty trial by allowing his counsel to tell\nthe penalty jury he ―had done the right thing‖ by not contesting guilt. Similarly, if\ncounsel suggested defendant should reserve for appeal the argument that the\npreliminary hearing transcript contained insufficient evidence he was illegally\ndetained by the murder victim, this advice, too, was not adverse or incompetent.\nNor, on the basis of the record before us, did counsel perform adversely if they\noffered the candid and reasonable prediction that a death judgment was likely,\nregardless of any case in mitigation that could be put forward.\n       Finally, we do not interpret Attorney Peters‘s comments on the record as\nconcessions that he personally believed defendant deserved to die. Rather, they\nappear as attempts, on behalf of a client who had resisted all efforts to portray him\nsympathetically, to urge that, in the end, he was at least taking responsibility for\nhis actions, did not seek to avoid the consequences of his murder of Officer Burt,\nand thus was not wholly irredeemable.\n       For all the reasons set forth above, we conclude the record fails to\ndemonstrate that defendant‘s trial counsel performed adversely as the result of a\nconflict of interest, or that they otherwise rendered constitutionally inadequate\nassistance. As a result, we need not, and do not, address defendant‘s extensive\nargument that a ―presumption of prejudice‖ should apply to counsel‘s adverse\n\n                                          64\n\fperformance arising from the type of conflict defendant asserts here. (See, e.g.,\nMickens, supra, 535 U.S. 162, 171-174; Doolin, supra, 45 Cal.4th 390, 418,\nfn. 20.)20\n\n       B. Sufficiency of special circumstance evidence.\n       Defendant contends that, in violation of ―state law and the Eighth and\nFourteenth Amendments,‖ the evidence supporting the special circumstance\nfinding that he intentionally killed a police officer engaged in the performance of\nduty was legally insufficient. We disagree.\n       ―In addressing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a\nconviction, the reviewing court must examine the whole record in the light most\nfavorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\n— evidence that is reasonable, credible and of solid value — such that a\nreasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n[Citation.] The appellate court presumes in support of the judgment the existence\nof every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence. [Citations.]‖\n(People v. Kraft (2000) 23 Cal.4th 978, 1053; see also, e.g., People v. Prieto\n(2003) 30 Cal.4th 226, 245; People v. Farnam (2002) 28 Cal.4th 107, 142-143.)\nIn the instant case, these inferences are aided by the presumption, applicable to\npolice officers except in the case of a warrantless arrest, that official duty was\nregularly performed. (Evid. Code, § 664; see, e.g., Davenport v. Department of\nMotor Vehicles (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 133, 141.)\n\n\n\n20     As the high court made clear in Mickens, and as defendant acknowledges, a\n―presumption of prejudice‖ may apply to certain kinds of attorney conflicts,\nincluding the active representation of competing interests, but even then, the\npresumption does not apply until the defendant has demonstrated adverse\nperformance related to the conflict. (See Mickens, supra, 535 U.S. 162, 171-174.)\n\n\n\n                                          65\n\f          As indicated above, the preliminary hearing evidence indicated that the\ntraffic stop occurred in the early evening of July 13, 1996. Defendant‘s associate,\nChang Nguyen, testified that defendant gave him the following account of the\ncircumstances leading to the victim‘s death: Officer Burt stopped defendant for\nfailure to have his headlights on. Defendant did not show the officer his own\ndriver‘s license, but instead gave a false name. The officer learned that the\ndriver‘s license in that name was suspended. He thereupon advised defendant he\nwould have to tow the car, but first must perform an inventory search of the\nvehicle. The officer opened the car‘s trunk, looked inside, and told defendant he\nwas under arrest. Defendant, aware that he had crime evidence in the trunk and\ndetermined not to leave a witness to a third strike offense, then proceeded to shoot\nthe officer.\n          Defendant‘s insufficient-evidence claim proceeds on the premise that, in\norder for the peace officer special circumstance to apply, the officer must have\nbeen performing his duties ―lawfully‖ at the time he was killed. (See pt. A.4.a,\nante.) Defendant does not seriously argue the record lacks evidence the officer‘s\nactions during the traffic stop were lawful. However, he urges the record of the\npreliminary hearing, on which the special circumstance finding was made, fails to\ninclude evidence from which a rational fact finder could conclude beyond\nreasonable doubt that Officer Burt had legal cause to stop and detain him at the\noutset.\n          Because Officer Burt‘s death at defendant‘s hands prevented the victim\nfrom explaining, in sworn testimony, the reason and basis for the stop, the only\nevidence on that issue came from Nguyen, who testified — without objection from\nthe defense — that defendant said ―he was driving and he thought he had his light\n[sic] on, but he got pulled over by [a] California Highway Patrolman for not\nhaving his light [sic] [on].‖ Defendant‘s statement to Nguyen was amply\n\n                                           66\n\fsufficient to allow a fact finder — here, a learned trial judge — to infer, first, that\nfailure to have his headlights on was the reason defendant was stopped; second,\nthat he understood he should have had his lights on; and third, that he actually did\nnot have them on. No evidence disputed or contradicted these inferences.21\n       Other evidence also supports them. In 1996, as now, the law required a\nmotor vehicle‘s headlights to be on when the vehicle was driven between one-half\nhour after sunset and one-half hour before sunrise. (Veh. Code, §§ 280, 24400,\n38335.) Bernice Sarthou testified at the preliminary hearing that she observed the\ntraffic stop involving defendant and Officer Burt as she pulled into an adjacent\n\n\n21     Defendant concedes his account to Nguyen of his own actions leading to\nthe shooting of Officer Burt were declarations against interest, and were thus not\nmade inadmissible for their truth by the hearsay rule. (Evid. Code, § 1230.)\nHowever, he asserts that Officer Burt‘s ―no headlights‖ statement to him, as\nrelated to Nguyen, was not offered by the prosecution for its ―truth,‖ but for the\n―non-hearsay purpose of explaining and putting into context [defendant‘s]\nadmissions.‖ This claim is based on the prosecutor‘s response to a defense\n―multiple hearsay‖ objection to later testimony by Nguyen that Officer Burt\nadvised defendant he would have do an inventory search on defendant‘s car. The\nprosecutor said he understood that ―the layer from the officer to the defendant is\nnot for the truth of the matter.‖ The court agreed, indicating that evidence of\nOfficer Burt‘s ―inventory search‖ statement was presented to make the defendant‘s\nadmissions ―meaningful,‖ and overruled the objection. However, as noted, the\ndefense made no hearsay objection when Nguyen testified defendant said that\nOfficer Burt stopped him because his headlights were off. Moreover, the hearsay\nrule did not make inadmissible Officer Burt‘s statement as evidence of his intent\nand purpose — i.e., his state of mind — in stopping defendant. (Evid. Code,\n§ 1250, subd. (a)(2).) And to the extent Officer Burt‘s out-of-court ―no\nheadlights‖ statement was ―testimonial‖ (see Crawford v. Washington (2004)\n541 U.S. 36), the doctrine of ―forfeiture by wrongdoing‖ precludes defendant from\nclaiming his constitutional rights were violated because he was unable to confront,\nin court, an out-of-court declarant whom he killed, as the undisputed evidence\nshows, to prevent the declarant from appearing as a witness against him. (See\nGiles v. California (2008) 554 U.S. 353, 376-377.)\n\n\n\n\n                                           67\n\frestaurant around 8:30 p.m. on July 13, 1996. As noted above (ante, fn. 8), we\nhave taken judicial notice of the indisputable fact that sunset occurred in Fullerton\non that date at 8:04 p.m. On this evidence, a rational fact finder could infer that, at\nthe time the stop occurred, dusk was approaching, and that Officer Burt thus\nreasonably concluded the law required defendant‘s headlights to be on.\n       Defendant stresses Sarthou‘s insistence, on both direct and cross-\nexamination, that when she first observed defendant and Officer Burt, she was\nwearing her sunglasses because the sun had not yet set. But this testimony\ncontradicted Sarthou‘s equally consistent time estimate, as compared with the\nactual time of sunset on July 13, 1996. It was also inconsistent with defendant‘s\nstatement to Nguyen that ―he thought he had his light[s] on.‖ As between\nSarthou‘s contradictory recollections, and considering the totality of relevant\nevidence, the fact finder was not obliged to credit Sarthou‘s ―sun was still up‖\ntestimony. Instead, the fact finder could believe her assertion she first observed\nthe traffic stop at a time that was, in fact, approximately one-half hour after sunset.\nThere was sufficient evidence to support a determination that Officer Burt acted\nlawfully when he stopped defendant‘s vehicle on July 13, 1996.22\n\n\n\n\n22     Evidence adduced at the penalty trial does not alter these conclusions.\nSarthou testified, consistently with her preliminary hearing account, that she\nobserved the traffic stop around 8:30 p.m. and was wearing sunglasses. Other\nwitnesses to the traffic stop gave time estimates that varied between 8:00 p.m. and\n8:30 p.m. Eyewitness Benjamin Baldauf, who agreed 8:30 was ―about the right\ntime frame,‖ also said the lighting was ―long on shadows, just before dark‖.\nA CHP dispatcher testified that he received a ―license check‖ call from Officer\nBurt around 8:30 p.m.\n\n\n\n\n                                          68\n\f       C. Claim of biased juror.\n       Defendant urges that his rights under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution, and under article I, section 16 of\nthe California Constitution, were violated by the seating of Juror No. 12, who, he\nasserts, was actually biased on the issue of penalty. Defendant acknowledges that\nhis lawyers did not challenge Juror No. 12 for cause, use a peremptory challenge\nto excuse the juror,23 or express dissatisfaction with the jury as sworn. (E.g.,\nPeople v. Carasi (2008) 44 Cal.4th 1263, 1290; People v. Bonilla (2007)\n41 Cal.4th 313, 339; People v. Hillhouse (2002) 27 Cal.4th 469, 487; People v.\nCrittenden (1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 121 & fn. 4 (Crittenden).) Nonetheless, defendant\ncontends the state is constitutionally disentitled to carry out a death judgment\njoined by a biased juror. Alternatively, he asserts that his counsel‘s failure to\nchallenge Juror No. 12 for cause, or to use a peremptory challenge against this\njuror, constituted ineffective assistance. In any event, he insists the court should\nhave excused the juror sua sponte.\n       However the issue is framed, we are unpersuaded by the merits of\ndefendant‘s argument that Juror No. 12 demonstrated actual penalty bias. Hence,\ndefendant‘s claim must be rejected.\n       ― ‗The state and federal constitutional guarantees of a trial by an impartial\njury include the right in a capital case to a jury whose members will not\nautomatically impose the death penalty for all murders, but will instead consider\nand weigh the mitigating evidence in determining the appropriate sentence. . . . If\nthe death penalty is imposed by a jury containing even one juror who would vote\nautomatically for the death penalty without considering the mitigating evidence,\n―the State is disentitled to execute the sentence.‖ [Citation.]‘ ‖ (People v. Boyette\n\n23     It is undisputed that defendant exhausted his peremptory challenges.\n\n\n\n                                          69\n\f(2002) 29 Cal.4th 381, 416 (Boyette), quoting People v. Weaver (2001) 26 Cal.4th\n876, 910 (Weaver).)\n       But strong views for or against the death penalty do not necessarily provide\na basis to excuse a prospective juror on the ground of actual bias. Instead, ― ‗the\nlaw permits a prospective juror to be challenged for cause [as biased on the issue\nof capital punishment] only if his or her views [on that subject] ―would ‗prevent or\nsubstantially impair the performance of his [or her] duties as a juror‘ ‖ in\naccordance with the court‘s instructions and the juror‘s oath.‘ (People v. Blair\n(2005) 36 Cal.4th 686, 741, quoting [Wainwright v. ]Witt [(1985)] 469 U.S. [412,]\n424.)‖ (People v. Martinez (2009) 47 Cal.4th 399, 425 (Martinez).) That a\nprospective juror might weigh the aggravating and mitigating evidence in light of\nhis or her death penalty views is not necessarily a ground for exclusion. Opinions\nabout the death penalty may disqualify a penalty juror only if they would prevent\nthe juror from engaging in the weighing process and deliberating the issue of\npenalty. (E.g., Martinez, supra, at p. 427; People v. Stewart (2004) 33 Cal.4th\n425, 446.)\n       A prospective juror‘s responses on these issues may be conflicting or\nambiguous, or may demonstrate understandable confusion about the complexities\nof death penalty law. Such responses do not necessarily require, or justify, a\njuror‘s excusal for bias. (E.g., Boyette, supra, 29 Cal.4th 381, 416; Weaver, supra,\n26 Cal.4th 876, 910; People v. Fudge (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1075, 1094.) And even\njurors with very strong views about the death penalty are qualified to serve if they\naffirm they will set those views aside, as necessary, in favor of applying the law\nand instructions. (E.g., Martinez, supra, 47 Cal.4th 399, 431; Lewis, supra,\n43 Cal.4th 415, 488.)\n       Juror No. 12‘s answers on the juror questionnaire indicate he harbored\nstrong pro-death views, both generally and about this particular case. On the other\n\n                                          70\n\fhand, he asserted his belief that he could set aside his feelings, follow the court‘s\ninstructions, and be a fair and impartial juror.\n       In response to a question about how, if at all, he had become familiar with\nthe case, Juror No. 12 indicated his wife‘s cousin was a Fullerton fireman who had\nbeen called to the shooting scene and tried to save Officer Burt. Asked what\nopinions, based on this information, he had formed about the appropriate sentence,\nJuror No.12 answered, ―My opinion — death sentence.‖ On the other hand, Juror\nNo. 12 answered ―yes‖ to the question whether he could set aside his prior\nknowledge of the case and decide it on the evidence presented in court ―and the\nlaw given to you at the conclusion of the case.‖ To the question whether he could\nset aside any preformed opinions about the case and decide it on the evidence and\nlaw presented during trial, Juror No. 12 responded, ―I think so.‖\n       In response to a question whether he had recently followed other criminal\ncases in the news media, Juror No. 12 answered ―yes,‖ and explained he had\nfollowed ―[t]he appeals to let the woman in Texas be excused from [the] death\npenalty because she found God.‖ A follow-up question inquired whether a case or\ncases the prospective juror had followed might affect his or her ability to be a fair\nand impartial juror. Juror No. 12 checked ―yes‖ and indicated, ―[if] defendant said\nhe‘d found God and should be spared for that reason.‖\n       Following these questions and answers, the questionnaire included a section\ntitled ―Attitudes About the Death Penalty.‖ This section was prefaced by an\nextended description of the nature of a capital penalty trial. The preface explained\nthat the jury was to determine the appropriate penalty by ―weighing‖ various\naggravating and mitigating (―bad and good‖) things about the crime, the\ndefendant, and his background, ―including a consideration of sympathy.‖ It\nadmonished that the weighing process was not quantitative, but qualitative, and\nthat, to fix the penalty at death, the jury must be persuaded the aggravating factors\n\n                                          71\n\f―are so substantial in comparison with the mitigating factors‖ that death, rather\nthan life without parole, was warranted.\n       The questionnaire than asked whether, ―[b]ased on the above,‖ the\nprospective juror‘s views would cause him or her to automatically vote for life or\ndeath. Juror No. 12 answered ―no‖ in each case. When queried as to his\n―GENERAL FEELINGS about the death penalty,‖ Juror No. 12 responded, ―I‘m\nfor it.‖ Asked whether he thought the death penalty was used too seldom, too\nrandomly, or too often, Juror No. 12 stated, ―Too many appeals that take too\nlong.‖ Asked whether he could set aside his personal feelings about what the law\nought to be and follow the court‘s instructions, Juror No. 12 checked ―yes,‖ and\nwrote, ―I‘m for the death penalty but if [the] court proved to me that defendant\nshould be spared death — I might not vote death.‖\n       The next questionnaire section was titled ―Penalty Trial – Factors to\nConsider.‖ The single question in this section was preceded by an explanation that\npersons selected to serve as penalty jurors would receive instructions listing the\nrelevant factors in the penalty determination. These factors were then set forth,\nincluding ―[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime\neven though it is not a legal excuse for the crime (and any sympathetic or other\naspect of the defendant‘s character and record) that the defendant offers as a basis\nfor a sentence less than death, whether or not related to the offense for which he is\non trial.‖ The questionnaire then asked if the prospective juror felt that any of the\nlisted factors should ―never‖ be considered in determining the appropriate\npunishment. Juror No. 12 answered ―no.‖\n\n\n\n\n                                           72\n\f       Juror No. 12 expressed similar attitudes during oral voir dire.24 While he\nwas in the jury box during jury selection, the court posed three questions,\naddressed to the group in the box. Paraphrased, these questions were whether the\nprospective juror (1) could personally vote for death if he or she believed that was\nthe appropriate punishment, (2) could personally vote for life without parole if he\nor she believed this was a case where death was not appropriate, and (3) would\ncarefully consider both options before deciding. The court then asked several\nprospective jurors individually, including Juror No. 12, how they would respond to\nthose questions. Juror No. 12 answered, ―Yes to all three.‖\n       The court addressed Juror No. 12 about his ―I think so‖ response to the\nquestionnaire inquiry whether he could set aside preformed views and decide the\ncase on the evidence and the law. ―Can you assure counsel and [me],‖ the court\nasked, ―that you can set aside any preconceived opinion and decide this case —? ‖\nJuror No. 12 interjected, ―I think I can, if they can give me a good reason that\nsomebody shouldn‘t be put to death, I believe I would vote in that direction.‖ The\ncourt then asked, ―So your position is that they have to prove why somebody\nshould not be put to death?‖ Juror No. 12 answered, ―Uh-huh.‖\n       Shortly thereafter, the court addressed general remarks to the panelists,\nincluding Juror No. 12, who were in the jury box. The court indicated that it\nwould provide certain instructions throughout the trial and at its conclusion. ―It is\n\n24     In response to the court‘s biographical inquiries during voir dire, Juror No.\n12 indicated that he lived in Buena Park, was 43 years old and single, and had\ncompleted high school and ―a couple years in college.‖ He stated he had worked\nat Disneyland for the past 24 years, and for the Orange County Republican Central\nCommittee ―for a couple years before that.‖ Juror No. 12 also indicated he had an\nuncle who was a retired Los Angeles County deputy sheriff, and another uncle\n―who spent about five years in the Whittier police force . . . back in the late\n1960‘s.‖\n\n\n\n                                         73\n\fimportant,‖ the court declared, ―that I have your assurance that you will follow my\ninstructions and rulings on the law and will apply that law to this case. [¶] [To]\n[p]ut it somewhat differently, whether you approve or disapprove of the court‘s\nrulings or instructions, it is your solemn duty to accept as correct these statements\nof the law. You may not substitute your own idea of what you think the law ought\nto be. [¶] Is there any member of the panel that will not follow the law as it is\ngiven to you in this case?‖ Juror No. 12 made no response indicating he would\nnot do so.\n       Continuing its general inquiries, the court asked the panelists in the jury\nbox, including Juror No. 12, whether ―any of [their] close friends or relatives [had]\never served as a juror on a capital case; death penalty case.‖ Juror No. 12 raised\nhis hand and stated, ―My immediate boss at work that I have known for about 20\nyears, just did one out in Riverside County.‖ The court asked whether this\nindividual had discussed the Riverside County trial with Juror No. 12 after it was\nover. Juror No. 12 declared, ―He said that it, you don‘t know what it is like, you\nhave an opinion about it until you get there and actually have to make that\ndecision, you just don‘t, you can‘t understand it.‖25\n       After further questions directed to various panelists sitting with Juror No.12\nin the jury box, the court again asked the group as a whole, ―Does any juror know\nof any other reason, or has anything occurred during this questioning period that\nmight make you doubtful that you would be a completely fair and impartial juror\n\n25      Asked by the court if anything Juror No. 12 discussed with the Riverside\nCounty juror about the latter‘s experience ―would have any bearing on how you\nwould decide this case,‖ Juror No. 12 answered, ―No.‖ But considered in the\ncontext of his answer to the preceding question, the negative response indicates\nthat these discussions had not reinforced any preconceived pro-death attitudes on\nJuror No. 12‘s part, and, if anything, had instead influenced him to keep an open\nmind.\n\n\n\n                                         74\n\fin this case, or why you should not be on this jury? If there is, it is your duty to\ndisclose the reason at this time.‖ Juror No. 12 did not respond.\n       Attorney Peters asked Juror No. 12 about his questionnaire reference to\ndelays in the capital penalty system. Peters inquired whether ―that [is] going to\nleak over into the facts of this case, the law involved in this case.‖ Juror No. 12\nsaid, ―I don‘t think so.‖ Peters suggested, ―That‘s more of a political problem than\nanything else?‖ Juror No. 12 answered, ―Yeah.‖ Peters queried whether Juror No.\n12 could ―weigh the aggravating and mitigating, whatever those turn out to be, and\nrender a fair verdict.‖ Juror No. 12 responded, ―I think so.‖ Without further\nquestions to Juror No. 12, the defense passed the panelists in the box, including\nJuror No. 12, for cause.\n       The prosecutor asked Juror No. 12 whether, ―[f]rom what you heard about\nthe case, what it is about, a police officer victim, do you think you could sit and be\nthat kind of juror we were talking about who can consider both [penalties], who\ncan accept the death penalty and vote or impose either one.‖ Juror No. 12\nanswered, ―Yes.‖ When the prosecutor then posited that ―[y]ou think you can do\nthat?,‖ Juror No. 12 responded, ―Yes, I do.‖ Without further questions to Juror\nNo. 12, the prosecution passed the panelists in the jury box, including Juror No.\n12, for cause.\n       Under these circumstances, Juror No. 12‘s written and oral responses did\nnot demonstrate, as a matter of law, that his death penalty views would ― ‗prevent\nor substantially impair‘ the performance of the juror‘s duties as defined by the\ncourt‘s instructions and the juror‘s oath.‖ (Crittenden, supra, 9 Cal.4th 83, 121.)\nJuror No. 12 expressed unequivocal general support for the death penalty,\nconceded his pretrial impression that death was appropriate in this case, and\nasserted he started from the perspective that the defense had the burden of proving\notherwise. However, advised at several points that he must follow the law and\n\n                                          75\n\finstructions regardless of his personal views, and must frankly disclose if he felt\nunable to do so, he consistently indicated that he could and would subordinate his\nviews, carefully weigh and consider the aggravating and mitigating evidence as\ninstructed, vote for either death or life without parole as appropriate, and sit fairly\nin accordance with the juror‘s oath. He further noted the insight of a colleague\nwho had recently served as a capital juror that, whatever one‘s preconceived\nnotions, it was impossible to understand the solemn realities of that role until one\nhad experienced it.\n        The record thus fails to establish that Juror No. 12 was a biased juror. This\nconclusion disposes of defendant‘s contentions that the trial court had a sua sponte\nduty to excuse Juror No. 12, and that his counsel was incompetent for failing to\nchallenge this juror.\n        The first of these claims fails for the following reasons: Had the trial court\n— which was able to observe Juror No. 12‘s demeanor and evaluate his credibility\nunder voir dire questioning — denied a challenge for cause on the ground of\npenalty bias, its ruling would have been upheld on appeal as supported by\nsubstantial evidence, and within the court‘s discretion. (E.g., Martinez, supra,\n47 Cal.4th 399, 426; Lewis, supra, 43 Cal.4th 415, 483; Weaver, supra, 26 Cal.4th\n876, 910.) If the court was not required to sustain a bias challenge against Juror\nNo. 12, it was certainly not obliged, on its own motion, to excuse this juror for\nbias.\n        By the same token, defendant cannot show on the appellate record that\ncompetent counsel should and would have challenged Juror No. 12 on this ground.\n(People v. Lucas (1995) 12 Cal.4th 415, 485.) So far as appears, counsel could\nreasonably conclude there was no merit in such a challenge. (Ibid.) Nor does the\nrecord demonstrate the absence of any plausible tactical reason for counsel‘s\nfailure to raise the issue on the chance of a favorable ruling. Counsel, who were\n\n                                          76\n\falso able to observe Juror No. 12‘s personality and demeanor, might have formed\nthe impression that, despite his views, this panelist would indeed perform fairly,\nand would not be a liability as a sitting juror. (Ibid.) We find no basis to reverse\nthe penalty judgment.\n\n       D. Wheeler/Batson claim.\n       Defendant urges his state and federal constitutional rights to a jury drawn\nfrom a representative cross-section of the community, to equal protection of the\nlaw, and to a fundamentally fair and reliable trial (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, & 14th\nAmends., Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 7, 16) were violated when the trial court\nerroneously denied his objection, under People v. Wheeler (1978) 22 Cal.3d 258\n(Wheeler) and Batson v. Kentucky (1986) 476 U.S. 79 (Batson), that the prosecutor\nhad used peremptory challenges to excuse African-American prospective jurors\nfor racially discriminatory reasons. (Wheeler/Batson claim). We reject the\ncontention.\n\n           l.   Facts.\n       During jury selection, defense counsel objected that the prosecutor ―[had]\nexcused all the Black jurors.‖ The court asked if counsel was making a ―Wheeler\nmotion,‖ and counsel replied, ―Yes.‖26 Defense counsel and the prosecutor agreed\nthe prosecutor had exercised peremptory challenges to excuse prospective jurors\nM.H., P.F., and L.P., the only three African-American members of the jury pool.\nThe court asked the clerk to retrieve the questionnaires of these panelists. While\nthe clerk was doing so, the court tentatively found a prima facie showing of\ndiscriminatory intent.\n\n26    The reference to Wheeler sufficed to preserve defendant‘s claim under\nBatson as well. (Vines, supra, 51 Cal.4th 830, 847, fn. 7; People v. Yeoman\n(2003) 31 Cal.4th 93, 117-118.)\n\n\n\n                                         77\n\f       On reflection, the court backtracked from that finding. It suggested the\ndefense was required to demonstrate a ―strong likelihood‖ of discrimination in the\nexcusal of these prospective jurors, and expressed doubt such a likelihood was\nestablished by the mere fact that ―all three [were] of the same racial group.‖\nDefense counsel responded there was further ―circumstantial evidence‖ of\ndiscrimination, i.e., counsel‘s recollection that, except for their race, these\nprospective jurors were indistinguishable from others the prosecution had failed to\nexcuse. Ultimately, though the court found the prima facie issue ―marginal,‖ it\nasked the prosecutor to give his reasons for the excusals.\n       As to M.H., the prosecutor indicated, ―[M.H.] is single. She has no\nchildren. She is younger than the juror I prefer. She is in her 30‘s. She is also,\nher attitude regarding the death penalty was personal and emotional, not\nphilosophical. She was the one who talked about, if it was my family I could\nunderstand it. But primarily the reason [is] she is young, single and no children.\nThere [are] no other jurors on the jury presently who fit that pattern.‖\n       As to P.F., the prosecutor stated that ―she is also younger than I want, in her\n30‘s. She had a very casual attitude and dress. She said that, well, in her\nquestionnaire [the death penalty] was appropriate only where there was a pattern\nof violent conduct, which is not the law. And she didn‘t seem particularly\ninterested in the proceedings. And when I was talking to her she seemed rather\nbored with my questions, and with [defense counsel‘s] questions.‖\n       As to L.P., the prosecutor declared that ―I had two reasons for challenging\nher. Her present occupation. She is a social worker. And I generally try not to\nhave social workers. I generally will use a peremptory on social workers unless\nthere is a reason not to. She also said that she couldn‘t vote for the death penalty\nunless it was proved, the facts were proved beyond a shadow of a doubt, which is\n\n\n\n                                           78\n\fnot the law either. So I felt she might be holding the People to a stronger burden\non some of the facts, particularly the other acts that are alleged.‖\n       As additional explanation pertaining to all the prospective jurors at issue,\nthe prosecutor advised that ―I grade [prospective jurors] on a system of one to ten\nand before seeing the jurors I graded [L.P.] a three, [P.F.] a three plus, and . . .\n[M.H.] a four.‖\n       At this point, defense counsel interjected, ―I just want to point out that\n[Juror No. 12] is also unmarried.‖ Apparently confused by counsel‘s remark, the\ncourt indicated, ―I think we are still doing peremptories, aren‘t we?‖ Defense\ncounsel responded by saying, ―I know. I am finding everything, I am a lawyer,\nI am finding every —,‖ whereupon the court asked, ―Anything further?‖ The\nprosecutor said, ―No.‖ The court asked whether the matter was submitted, and\ndefense counsel said, ―Yes.‖\n       The court thereupon ruled as follows: ―Well, the court finds that no\ndiscriminatory intent is inherent in the explanations, and the reasons appear to be\nrace neutral, and on those grounds the court will deny the Wheeler motion.‖\n\n           2. Applicable law.\n       ― ‗ ―Both the state and federal Constitutions prohibit the use of peremptory\nchallenges to remove prospective jurors based solely on group bias.‖ ‘ [Citation.]\nRecently, ‗the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed that Batson states the\nprocedure and standard to be employed by trial courts when challenges such as\ndefendant‘s are made. ―First, the defendant must make out a prima facie case ‗by\nshowing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of\ndiscriminatory purpose.‘ [Citations.] Second, once the defendant has made out a\nprima facie case, the ‗burden shifts to the State to explain adequately the racial\nexclusion‘ by offering permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes.\n\n\n\n                                           79\n\f[Citations.] Third, ‗[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must\nthen decide . . . whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial\ndiscrimination.‘ [Citations.]‖ ‘ (People v.

Lenix (2008) 44 Cal.4th 602, 613-614.)‖ (Vines, supra, 51 Cal.4th 830,\n848.)27\n\n\n\n       27 The concurring opinion urges that, when the trial court has failed to\nexplain in detail why it is accepting the proffered reasons for a challenged excusal,\nwe owe the court‘s ruling no deference, but must ourselves examine the record in\ndetail and determine independently whether the proffered reasons for the excusal\nwere likely sincere. As in a recent prior opinion on this subject (People v.\nWilliams (2013) 56 Cal.4th 630, 715 (dis. opn. of Liu, J.)), the concurring\nopinion‘s author concedes that in concluding otherwise,we adhere to our well-\nestablished precedent. (Conc. opn. of Liu, J., at p. 7.)\n       Our practice does not indicate, as the concurring opinion suggests,\ninsensitivity to claims that a peremptory excusal has been employed for a\ndiscriminatory reason. On the contrary, it honors the principles that should and do\nattend the evaluation of such claims. A party has an absolute right, within\nstatutory limits, to excuse a prospective juror for any nondiscriminatory reason,\nhowever subjective, that gives the party concern about the juror‘s suitability. We\npresume this right is exercised in good faith, and the burden is always on the party\nclaiming discrimination to establish it. When the trial court has inquired into the\nbasis for an excusal, and a nondiscriminatory explanation has been provided, we\nalso assume the court understands, and carries out, its duty to subject the proffered\nreasons to sincere and reasoned analysis, taking into account all the factors that\nbear on their credibility. Finally, we recognize that the trial rather than the\nappellate court is best suited to determine, under all the relevant circumstances,\nwhether the proffered reasons are likely the real ones.\n        Deference to the trial court in such a case, even in the absence of a detailed\nruling, hardly constitutes ―a ‗don‘t ask, don‘t tell‘ approach to appellate review.‖\n(Conc. opn. of Liu, J., post, at p. 25.) In a stage three Wheeler/Batson analysis,\nthe trial court rules only after the party who exercised the challenged excusal was\nasked, and did tell, the reasons for this action. Here, the trial court accepted\nexplanations that are facially permissible, inherently plausible, and factually\nsupported, and defendant cites no substantial evidence of pretext. Under such\ncircumstances, there is no reason on appeal to suspect a dereliction of duty by the\ntrial court, or to reverse the presumption that the excusals were exercised\nlegitimately, simply because the trial court did not ―tell‖ its reasons in detail.\nAccordingly, as we have previously indicated, our past precedent will ―guide us\nuntil the United States Supreme Court articulates a contrary rule.‖ (Williams,\nsupra, at p. 653, fn. 21.)\n\n\n\n                                          81\n\f       Appellate review of a step three finding of nondiscriminatory intent is also\ninformed by the principle that ―the defendant‘s burden at the third stage of a\nWheeler/Batson hearing is to show the prosecutor excused prospective jurors for\ndiscriminatory reasons [citation], not merely that some of the nondiscriminatory\nreasons offered by the prosecutor are not supported by the record.‖ (People v.\nTaylor (2009) 47 Cal.4th 850, 891 (Taylor); see People v. McKinzie (2012)\n54 Cal.4th 1302, 1322.)\n       Here, it is not clear the trial court ultimately found, in step one, that\ndefendant had made out a prima facie case. Moreover, insofar as the court\ndeclined to make such a ruling, it appears to have relied on its belief that a prima\nfacie case required the showing of a ―strong likelihood‖ of discrimination.\nIntervening high court authority has held that such a standard is too demanding for\nfederal constitutional purposes. (Johnson v. California (2005) 545 U.S. 162, 170\n[prima facie burden is simply to ―produc[e] evidence sufficient to permit the trial\njudge to draw an inference that discrimination has occurred‖].)\n       However, as noted, the court nonetheless proceeded to step two by asking\nthe prosecutor to explain his reasons for the challenged excusals. The prosecutor\ndid so, and the trial court then made a ruling, pursuant to step three, that the\nreasons expressed were valid. Under these circumstances, we too may simply\nproceed as though this is a step three case, analyzing whether the trial court\nproperly accepted the race-neutral reasons given by the prosecutor. (People v.\nZambrano (2007) 41 Cal.4th 1082, 1105-1106; People v. Lewis and Oliver (2006)\n39 Cal.4th 970, 1010; People v. Ward (2005) 36 Cal.4th 186, 199-201.)\n\n\n\n\n                                           82\n\f           3. Discussion.\n       Applying this analysis, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the\nrace-neutral reasons given by the prosecutor for his excusal of prospective jurors\nM.H., P.F., and L.P. We consider each challenged excusal in turn.\n\n               a. Prospective Juror M.H.\n       M.H. indicated that she was 40 years old, was single, and had no children.\nOn her juror questionnaire, M.H. stated she was for the death penalty, and she\nconfirmed that view on voir dire. When defense counsel asked whether her\nfeelings stemmed from any personal experience, she replied, ―Oh, no, no, not\npersonally. But I figure if someone came to my house and blew my family away,\nI would flip the switch. But that‘s personal, that‘s why I believe in it. But I don‘t\n— I wouldn‘t sit here and tell this young man, okay, you need it because you\nkilled somebody, I think there [are] also circumstances. But I know if it was my\nfamily, I couldn‘t honestly say that I wouldn‘t be emotional about it.‖\n       When defense counsel said that families are not the executioners, M.H.\nresponded that she agreed, and confirmed she had no personal experiences\nrelevant to the death penalty, but repeated that ―if it was me personally and my\nfamily, that‘s totally different for me.‖ When counsel asked if M.H. agreed we\ncannot have a system that allows a victim‘s family to take revenge, M.H. said,\n―Oh, definitely. I am not saying that. I think maybe you are misunderstanding\nwhat I am saying to you; are you misunderstanding me?‖\n       M.H.‘s remarks about the death penalty might be taken more than one way,\nbut they could give rise to a reasonable concern that her willingness to impose this\npunishment might be influenced by her degree of direct interest in the case. The\nprosecutor expressed this concern by suggesting M.H.‘s approval of the death\npenalty appeared to be ―personal‖ and ―emotional‖ — as in ―if it was my family,\nI could understand it‖ — rather than ―philosophical,‖ such that she could apply\n\n\n                                         83\n\fthat penalty in any appropriate case. Moreover, as the Attorney General observes,\nM.H.‘s somewhat testy exchange with defense counsel (―are you\nmisunderstanding me?‖) could also, in combination with the prosecutor‘s personal\nobservation of this prospective juror, persuade him her relative youth was a sign of\nimmaturity.\n       Defendant points out that M.H. was 40 years old, not ―in her 30‘s‖ as\nrecalled by the prosecutor. Moreover, defendant asserts, the prosecutor‘s claim\nthat M.H.‘s combination of age, unmarried status, and childlessness had not\npreviously been encountered in the jury pool was untrue. As defendant notes,\nJuror No. 12 had already disclosed on voir dire that he was 43 years old,\nunmarried, and childless. Finally, defendant urges that the prosecutor‘s\ncharacterization of M.H.‘s death penalty views was unfair; M.H. simply meant,\ndefendant asserts, that she might be emotional in her desire for the death penalty if\nher own family was involved, but could and would be fair in any case where her\ninterest was not personal.\n       As noted, however, the prosecutor was not obliged to accept this precise\ninterpretation of M.H.‘s ambiguous remarks, and he could reasonably be\nconcerned about her ability to give the death penalty fair consideration when a\nfamily member was not a victim. Moreover, even if Juror No. 12 shared some\ncharacteristics with M.H. that the prosecutor indicated were influential in excusing\nthe latter, there was one substantial difference between the two panelists — Juror\nNo. 12 expressed much stronger views in favor of the death penalty. Nothing\nindicates the prosecutor was wrong in suggesting that when M.H.‘s age, familial\nstatus, and death penalty views were considered together, she was unique among\nthe jurors who had been evaluated at the time the prosecutor excused her. Under\nthese circumstances, the record adequately supports the prosecutor‘s statement of\nrace-neutral reasons for exercising a peremptory challenge against M.H.\n\n                                         84\n\f                 b. Prospective Juror P.F.\n       P.F. declared in her questionnaire that ―[t]he death penalty is a very serious\nconsequence for committing a serious offense (murder). In order for someone to\nreceive this punishment, I believe the person must have maliciously set out to\ndestroy the life of someone else (and their loved ones), and have a history of such\nviolent behavior w/o remorse.‖ She stated her opinion that ―the death penalty is\nnot used often enough in cases where convicted felons have a repeated [behavior]\npattern for committing violent crimes against others, such as murder.‖\n       On voir dire, defense counsel indicated to P.F. his impression that she was\n―kind of a strong proponent of the death penalty but not rabid about it, you just\nthink it is appropriate sometimes?‖ P.F. answered, ―Yeah, I mean if, how to\nanswer it, if like I knew all the facts, you know, see everything, I would want to\nsay for a judgment in my mind, but based upon the facts I wouldn‘t just arbitrarily\nsay because of a particular crime, without knowing everything, what the\npunishment should be.‖\n       Later, the prosecutor asked P.F. what she meant on her questionnaire by\nstating she ―felt the death penalty would be appropriate when there was a pattern\nof violent conduct. Did you mean by that anything in particular, as far as there\nwould [have to be] a series of events, or more than one . . .?‖ P.F. answered,\n―What I had in mind wasn‘t a particular case, but like some cases, certain ones, the\nperson just had a pattern of no regard for life.‖ P.F. agreed when the prosecutor\nsuggested ―it wasn‘t something exclusive, just something you were thinking of\nthat would be a strong consideration for you?‖ She agreed again when the\nprosecutor said, ―It wasn‘t just like one system you would consider to look at; is\nthat correct?‖\n       Under these circumstances, the prosecutor‘s recall that P.F. had indicated\nthe death penalty was appropriate for a ―pattern of violent conduct‖ was not unfair.\n\n\n                                         85\n\fThough certain of P.F.‘s voir dire responses suggested she might consider the\ndeath penalty in other cases, it was reasonable for the prosecutor to be concerned\nthat she might be reluctant to do so except in cases of the most calculated and\nmalicious murder by someone who had committed similar violent acts in the past.\nThe record thus supports the sincerity of the prosecutor‘s claim that P.F.‘s\nexpressed views on the death penalty were a race-neutral reason why he used a\nperemptory challenge to excuse her.\n       Defendant insists the record does not support the prosecutor‘s assertions\nabout P.F.‘s casual dress, and her ―bored‖ and disinterested manner. As defendant\nobserves, the record indicates that P.F. was a 911 operator for the police\ndepartment. On the record, he suggests, her answers to all questions seem\nappropriate, and she appears facially to have been an ideal juror.\n       But the prosecutor‘s demeanor observations, even if not explicitly\nconfirmed by the record, are a permissible race-neutral ground for peremptory\nexcusal, especially when they were not disputed in the trial court. (People v.\nClark (2011) 52 Cal.4th 856, 1012; see People v. Fuentes (1991) 54 Cal.3d 707,\n715.)28 We cannot say the record contradicts the race-neutral reasons stated by the\nprosecutor for his peremptory excusal of prospective juror P.F.\n\n               c. Prospective Juror L.P.\n       On her questionnaire, L.P. listed her occupation as ―Senior Social Worker.‖\nAsked her general feelings about the death penalty, L.P. responded, ―My general\n\n\n28     Defendant asserts that the trial court cut off defense counsel‘s attempt to\nrebut the prosecutor‘s reasons. But counsel simply protested that Juror No. 12,\nlike prospective juror M.H., was unmarried. There is no indication counsel sought\nto dispute the prosecutor‘s description of P.F.‘s demeanor. Indeed, when the court\nthereafter asked if the Wheeler/Batson motion was submitted, defense counsel\nreplied, ―Yes.‖\n\n\n\n                                         86\n\ffeelings are that it is important when inflicting it to make sure that the person is\nguilty beyond a shadow of a doubt before imposing it.‖\n       On voir dire, the prosecutor told L.P. that her ―shadow of a doubt‖\ncomment on her questionnaire had ―just sort of stood out,‖ and he asked her to\nexplain what she meant. L.P. replied, ―I think I said the major problem with it,\nbecause I wanted to make sure that the people were convicted beyond a shadow of\na doubt.‖ ―In other words,‖ the prosecutor suggested, ―before we consider a\npenalty as serious as this, we want to make sure we know what the facts are; is that\nwhat you are saying . . .?‖ L.P. answered, ―Yes.‖\n       Defendant insists that, in stating his reasons for excusing L.P., the\nprosecutor mischaracterized her ―shadow of a doubt‖ comment. Defendant notes\nthat L.P. made clear on voir dire she was willing to consider the death penalty so\nlong as the person was convicted beyond a shadow of a doubt. Because the\npenalty jury would be told it must accept his conviction of Officer Burt‘s murder,\ndefendant asserts, the prosecutor had no legitimate basis for concern that L.P.\nwould refuse to entertain the possibility of a death sentence in this case.\n       However, in light of L.P.‘s responses, it was reasonable for the prosecutor\nto be concerned that, for the proof of any facts pertinent to a possible death\nsentence, L.P. would insist not only on the elimination of reasonable doubt, but on\nthe removal of all doubt. Moreover, the record confirms the prosecutor‘s\nrecollection that L.P. was a social worker. The prosecutor‘s expressed reservation\nabout having social workers on the jury was race-neutral. It also had ―some basis\nin accepted trial strategy‖ (e.g., Taylor, supra, 47 Cal.4th 850, 886) insofar as it\nstemmed from a concern about the general attitudes and philosophies persons in\nthat profession might harbor. Hence, the record affords no basis to conclude that\nthe prosecutor‘s reasons for excusing L.P. were insincere or pretextual.\n\n\n\n                                          87\n\f       Defendant urges that the trial court‘s terse ruling on the Wheeler/Batson\nmotion does not represent a ―sincere and reasoned effort‖ to assess whether the\nprosecutor‘s proffered race-neutral reasons for excusing M.H., P.F., and L.P. were\nhis true reasons. Defendant asserts that the words used by the court — i.e., that\n―no discriminatory intent is inherent in the explanations, and the reasons appear to\nbe race neutral‖ (italics added) — indicate the court addressed only the facial\nplausibility of the reasons claimed by the prosecutor, and failed to properly assess,\nunder all the relevant circumstances, whether the prosecutor‘s explanations were\ncredible.\n       However, we have made clear that ―the trial court is not required to explain\non the record its ruling on a Batson/Wheeler motion. (People v. Reynoso, supra,\n31 Cal.4th [903,] 919.) ‗When the prosecutor‘s stated reasons . . . are both\ninherently plausible and supported by the record, the trial court need not question\nthe prosecutor or make detailed findings.‘ (People v. Silva (2001) 25 Cal.4th 345,\n386.)‖ (Vines, supra, 51 Cal.4th 830, 849.) Here, as noted, the prosecutor‘s\nreasons were plausible and, in all essential respects, supported.\n       Moreover, in arguing that the language of the trial court‘s ruling shows the\ncourt made no bona fide attempt to assess the prosecutor‘s credibility, defendant\nparses the court‘s words too closely. The court‘s assertion that no discriminatory\nintent was ―inherent‖ in the prosecutor‘s explanations is reasonably read as a\ndetermination that the court believed them to be true.\n       We further note that, while considering the Wheeler/Batson motion, the\ncourt asked for the relevant juror questionnaires, and it presumably reviewed\nthem. No reason appears to conclude the court failed to consider all the factors\nbearing on the prosecutor‘s credibility, including his demeanor, the inherent\nreasonableness or improbability of his proffered explanations, their plausible basis\nin accepted trial strategy, the court‘s own observation of the relevant jurors‘ voir\n\n                                          88\n\fdire, its experience as a trial lawyer and judge in the community, and the common\npractices of the prosecutor‘s office and the individual prosecutor himself. (E.g.,\nPeople v. Jones (2011) 51 Cal.4th 346, 360.) Defendant‘s Wheeler/Batson claim\nmust be rejected.\n\n       E. Claim of unreliable special circumstance and penalty verdicts.\n       Defendant urges that the trial procedures in this case denied him reliable\ndeterminations of death eligibility, and of the appropriate penalty, in violation of\nhis state and federal constitutional rights to a reliable death judgment. (U.S.\nConst., 5th, 8th, & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 15, 17.) He suggests in\ngeneral that the trial was an ―empty charade‖ due to his counsel‘s deficiencies, and\nhis own asserted incompetence to waive his rights and stand trial — claims we\nhave already considered at length and rejected on this record.\n       In particular, however, he focuses anew on two aspects of the\nproceedings — his ―slow plea‖ to the special circumstance allegation, and the\npenalty trial, at which he was permitted to present no mitigating evidence or\nargument and to give testimony inviting the jury to sentence him to death. He\nclaims that regardless of his wishes, the state was authorized, indeed required, to\noverride these decisions in order to protect the paramount public interest in\nreasoned, fair, and just death judgments, and to avoid being implicated in his\ndesire to commit state-assisted suicide. We are not persuaded.\n       As defendant observes, California has recognized limited circumstances in\nwhich, as a matter of fundamental public policy, rights and decisions that are\nnormally personal to a criminal defendant may be limited or overruled in the\nservice of death penalty reliability. Thus, a capital defendant is not permitted to\nwaive his or her automatic appeal of a death judgment. (Cal. Const., art. VI, § 11,\nsubd. (a); Pen. Code, § 1239, subd. (b); People v. Stanworth (1969) 71 Cal.2d 820,\n\n\n                                          89\n\f834.) Moreover, a plea of guilty to a capital felony may not be taken except in the\npresence of counsel, and with counsel‘s consent. (§ 1018.) Even if otherwise\ncompetent to exercise the constitutional right to self-representation (Faretta v.\nCalifornia (1975) 422 U.S. 806), a defendant may not discharge his lawyer in\norder to enter such a plea over counsel‘s objection. (E.g., People v. Chadd (1981)\n28 Cal.3d 739, 747-757; see People v. Alfaro (2007) 41 Cal.4th 1277, 1299-1302.)\n       But here, defendant‘s counsel did consent to a ―slow plea‖ on the issues of\nguilt and special circumstances. Nor did counsel agree simply to allow defendant\nto waive his trial rights for purposes of inviting a death judgment. On the\ncontrary, their consent stemmed from their express decision — one we have\ndeemed competent and reasonable under the circumstances — to preserve\ncredibility with a penalty jury in the face of overwhelming evidence that defendant\nhad gunned down a police officer during a routine traffic stop in order to eliminate\nthe victim as a witness to serious felony evidence discovered during the encounter.\n       As we have also noted, competent counsel could conclude this ―slow plea‖\nstrategy had the additional advantage of limiting the special circumstance evidence\nof the officer‘s ―lawful‖ performance of duty to the showing made at the\npreliminary hearing. Defendant thereby avoided the risk that additional evidence\non the ―lawful duty‖ issue would be presented in a trial, while preserving the right\nto urge on appeal, if necessary, that the preliminary hearing evidence was legally\ninsufficient. In turn, we have concluded that the evidence of Officer Burt‘s\n―lawful‖ performance was legally sufficient, in that a rational trier of fact,\nreviewing the evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing, could find beyond\nreasonable doubt — as the instant trial court necessarily did — that the victim was\nlawfully engaged in duty at the time he was killed. Under these circumstances, the\nfact that defendant may have had personal reasons, different from those of his\n\n\n\n                                          90\n\fcounsel, for agreeing to a ―slow plea‖ does not undermine the fundamental\nreliability of the death judgment.\n       Nor are constitutional reliability concerns raised by the fact that defendant,\nat his own insistence, presented no mitigating evidence or argument at the penalty\ntrial. ―We have stated that ‗a verdict is constitutionally reliable ―when the\nprosecution has discharged its burden of proof at the guilt and penalty phases\npursuant to the rules of evidence and within the guidelines of a constitutional\ndeath penalty statute, the death verdict has been returned under proper instructions\nand procedures, and the trier of penalty has duly considered the relevant mitigating\nevidence, if any, which the defendant has chosen to present.‖ ‘ [Citation.] Under\nthose conditions, despite a defendant‘s avowed intent not to present available\nevidence in mitigation, the state‘s interest in ensuring a reliable and fair penalty\ndetermination has been met. [Citations.]‖ (People v. Bradford (1997) 15 Cal.4th\n1229, 1372.)\n       Finally, we have repeatedly rejected the contention that the constitutional\nreliability of a death judgment is undermined by recognizing the defendant‘s\npersonal right to testify in favor of the death penalty. (Nakahara, supra,\n30 Cal.4th 705, 719; Webb, supra, 6 Cal.4th 494, 534-535.) Though the instant\njury received no specific instruction that ― ‗despite the defendant‘s testimony,‘ ‖ it\nmust decided the appropriate penalty based upon the factors in aggravation and\nmitigation (see Webb, supra, at p. 535, fn. 29, quoting Guzman, supra, 45 Cal.3d\n915, 962), the jury was generally instructed that it must weigh the aggravating and\nmitigating evidence to determine the appropriate penalty, and should return a\ndeath verdict only if persuaded the aggravating circumstances were ―so\nsubstantial‖ in comparison to mitigation that death was warranted. Jurors were\n\n\n\n\n                                          91\n\falso told not to be swayed by bias against the defendant, that the listed aggravating\nfactors were exclusive,29 and that defendant‘s ―behavior‖ in the courtroom could\nbe considered only to rebut mitigating evidence of remorse if any such evidence\nwas offered. No basis for reversal appears.\n\n       F. Challenges to California death penalty statute and instructions.\n       Defendant raises numerous challenges to California‘s death penalty statute,\nand to the standard instructions given at his penalty trial. We have rejected the\nidentical claims on many occasions, and defendant fails to persuade us that these\ndecisions should be reconsidered.\n       Thus, we reaffirm that ―the death penalty statute is not unconstitutional\nbecause it does not require ‗unanimity as to the truth of aggravating\ncircumstances, or findings beyond a reasonable doubt that an aggravating\ncircumstance (other than § 190.3, factor (b) or (c) evidence) has been proved, that\nthe aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors, or that death is the\nappropriate sentence.‘ [Citation.] Nothing in Cunningham v. California (2007)\n549 U.S. 270, Blakely v. Washington (2004) 542 U.S. 296, Ring v. Arizona (2002)\n536 U.S. 584, or Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466, affects our\nconclusions in this regard. [Citations.] No burden of proof is constitutionally\nrequired, nor is the trial court required to instruct the jury that there is no burden of\nproof. [Citations.] That certain noncapital sentencing proceedings may assign a\nburden of proof to the prosecutor does not mean the death penalty statute violates\na [capital] defendant‘s rights to equal protection or due process. [Citations.] . . . .\n\n\n\n29     The jury was also expressly advised that the only section 190.3 factors the\njury could consider in aggravation were factors (a) (circumstances of the capital\ncrime), (b) (other violent criminal conduct), and (c) (prior felony convictions).\n\n\n\n                                           92\n\fThe trial court need not instruct that there is a presumption of life. [Citation.]‖\n(People v. Dement (2011) 53 Cal.4th 1, 55-56.)\n       Moreover, the statute is not unconstitutional because the special\ncircumstances it specifies are so numerous or broad that it fails to genuinely\nnarrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty, or because it fails to\nrequire written findings. (E.g., Vines, supra, 51 Cal.4th 830, 891; People v. Abilez\n(2007) 41 Cal.4th 472, 533.) Section 190.3, factor (a), which allows the jury to\nconsider the circumstances of the capital crime in aggravation, is not\nimpermissibly overbroad and does not lead to arbitrary or capricious imposition of\nthe death penalty. (E.g., Vines, supra, at p. 891; Abilez, supra, at p. 533; People v.\nRobinson (2005) 37 Cal.4th 592, 655; People v. Kennedy (2005) 36 Cal.4th 595,\n641.) The federal constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection,\nand against cruel and unusual punishment (U.S. Const., 6th, 8th, and 14th\nAmends.), do not require intercase proportionality review on appeal. (E.g.,\nPeople v. Whalen (2013) 56 Cal.4th 1, 91.)\n       CALJIC No. 8.88 is not impermissibly overbroad, vague, or misleading\ninsofar as it specifies that the jury may impose death if persuaded the aggravating\ncircumstances are ―so substantial‖ in comparison to the mitigating circumstances\nthat death is ―warrant[ed],‖ and fails to advise that the central determination is\nwhether death is the ―appropriate‖ penalty. (E.g., People v. Watkins (2012)\n55 Cal.4th 999, 1036; People v. Gonzalez (2012) 54 Cal.4th 1234, 1299.) Nor was\nthe trial court required to delete inapplicable sentencing factors from the penalty\ninstructions. (E.g., People v. Valdez (2012) 55 Cal.4th 82, 180; People v.\nMcDowell (2012) 54 Cal.4th 395, 444.)30\n\n30     Though, as noted above (fn. 29, ante), the jury was told that the only\napplicable section 190.3 factors in aggravation were factors (a), (b), and (c).\n\n\n\n                                          93\n\f       Finally, California‘s death penalty scheme does not violate international\nlaw and norms. (E.g., People v. Houston (2012) 54 Cal.4th 1186, 1232.) We are\nnot persuaded otherwise by Roper v. Simmons (2005) 543 U.S. 551, in which the\nhigh court cited evolving international standards as ―respected and significant‖\nsupport for its holding that the Eighth Amendment prohibits imposition of the\ndeath penalty against persons who committed their crimes as juveniles. (Roper, at\np. 578.)\n                                   DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                 BAXTER, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\nCANTIL-SAKAUYE, C. J.\nKENNARD, J.\nWERDEGAR, J.\nCHIN, J.\nCORRIGAN, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                        94\n\f                      CONCURRING OPINION BY LIU, J.\n\n\n\n       The trial court in this case denied defendant‘s objection to the prosecutor‘s\nperemptory strikes of all three black prospective jurors with the following\nstatement: ―Well, the court finds that no discriminatory intent is inherent in the\nexplanations, and the reasons appear to be race neutral, and on those grounds the\ncourt will deny the Wheeler motion.‖ Because defendant has not shown that it\nwas more likely than not that the strikes were racially motivated, I agree that his\nclaim must be denied. I cannot agree, however, with aspects of today‘s opinion\nthat improperly defer to the trial court‘s ruling and, in so doing, fail to evaluate\ndefendant‘s claim in the manner that high court precedent requires.\n       Batson v. Kentucky (1986) 476 U.S. 79 (Batson) set forth a three-step\nframework for evaluating a claim that a peremptory strike was based on race.\n―First, the defendant must make out a prima facie case ‗by showing that the\ntotality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.‘\n[Citations.] Second, once the defendant has made out a prima facie case, the\n‗burden shifts to the State to explain adequately the racial exclusion‘ by offering\npermissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes. [Citations.] Third, ‗[i]f a\nrace-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide . . . whether\nthe opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial discrimination.‘ ‖\n(Johnson v. California (2005) 545 U.S. 162, 168 (Johnson).) In order to prevail,\n\n\n\n\n                                           1\n\fthe defendant must show that ―it was more likely than not that the challenge was\nimproperly motivated.‖ (Id. at p. 170.)\n       The present case involves Batson‘s third step. Ordinarily, an appellate\ncourt must review the denial of a Batson motion at the third step with deference to\nthe trial court. (See Snyder v. Louisiana (2008) 552 U.S. 472, 477 (Snyder);\nBatson, supra, 476 U.S. at p. 98, fn. 21.) This rule of deference is warranted\nbecause Batson‘s third-step inquiry often involves evaluation of ―whether the\nprosecutor‘s demeanor belies a discriminatory intent.‖ (Snyder, at p. 477.) In\naddition, if the prosecutor has invoked a juror‘s demeanor as the reason for a\nstrike, the Batson inquiry requires evaluation of ―whether the juror‘s demeanor can\ncredibly be said to have exhibited the basis for the strike attributed to the juror by\nthe prosecutor.‖ (Ibid.) ―[T]hese determinations of credibility and demeanor lie\n‗ ―peculiarly within a trial judge‘s province‖ ‘ [citation] . . . .‖ (Ibid.)\n       However, deference is unwarranted ―when a trial court fails to make\nexplicit findings or to provide any on-the-record analysis of the prosecution‘s\nstated reasons for a strike.‖ (People v. Williams (2013) 56 Cal.4th 630, 717\n(Williams) (dis. opn. of Liu, J.).) In such circumstances, ―a reviewing court has no\nassurance that the trial court has properly examined ‗all of the circumstances that\nbear upon the issue‘ of purposeful discrimination.‖ (Ibid., quoting Snyder, supra,\n552 U.S. at p. 478; see United States v. Rutledge (7th Cir. 2011) 648 F.3d 555, 559\n[―if there is nothing in the record reflecting the trial court‘s decision, then there is\nnothing to which we can defer‖].) In this case, the trial court‘s statement that ―no\ndiscriminatory intent is inherent in the explanations, and the reasons appear to be\nrace neutral‖ does not indicate that it conducted the thorough and careful inquiry\nat Batson‘s third step exemplified by the high court‘s decisions in Snyder and\nMiller-El v. Dretke (2005) 545 U.S. 231 (Miller-El). By erroneously deferring to\nthe trial court‘s ruling, this court has once again effectuated ―the denial of [a]\n\n                                            2\n\fdefendant‘s Batson claim despite the fact that no court, trial or appellate, has ever\nconducted a proper Batson analysis.‖ (Williams, at p. 700 (dis. opn. of Liu, J.).)\n       I recently explained in Williams that our deference to Batson rulings\nunaccompanied by explicit findings or analysis falls on the wrong side of a split of\nauthority on the correct approach to appellate review at Batson‘s third step. (See\nWilliams, supra, 56 Cal.4th at pp. 709–715 (dis. opn. of Liu, J.) [reviewing state\nand federal case law refusing to accord deference to unexplained Batson rulings,\nincluding United States v. McAllister (6th Cir. 2012) 693 F.3d 572, 581–582,\nRutledge, supra, 648 F.3d at page 559, Coombs v. Diguglielmo (3d Cir. 2010) 616\nF.3d 255, 261–265, and Green v. LaMarque (9th Cir. 2008) 532 F.3d 1028,\n1031].) In this opinion, I show how this unwarranted deference results in judicial\ninquiry that falls short of what is required in a proper Batson analysis. I also trace\nthe origins of our erroneous doctrine and discuss the unfair and counterproductive\nconsequences of our approach. For some time now, our jurisprudence has not\ndemanded that trial courts or reviewing courts demonstrate a truly reasoned effort\nto evaluate Batson claims in light of all relevant circumstances bearing on the\nissue of purposeful discrimination. And the results, which I document in another\nopinion filed today, are quite remarkable: In the 102 cases where this court has\naddressed a Batson claim over the past 20 years, we have found Batson error only\nonce — and that was 12 years ago. (See People v. Harris (Aug. 26, 2013,\nS081700) __ Cal.4th __, __ [at pp. 33–34, 42–44] (conc. opn. of Liu, J.).)\n       Because high court precedent has consistently recognized the manifold\nharms of racial discrimination in jury selection and has accordingly required more\ncareful and thorough inquiry than our case law provides, I respectfully disagree\nwith the deferential framework that this court continues to apply in reviewing\nunexplained Batson rulings on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                                          I.\n       Reciting our precedent, today‘s opinion says: ― ‗ ―Review of a trial court‘s\ndenial of a Wheeler/Batson motion is deferential, examining only whether\nsubstantial evidence supports its conclusions. [Citation.] ‗We review a trial\ncourt‘s determination regarding the sufficiency of a prosecutor‘s justifications for\nexercising peremptory challenges ― ‗with great restraint.‘ ‖ [Citation.] We\npresume that a prosecutor uses peremptory challenges in a constitutional manner\nand give great deference to the trial court‘s ability to distinguish bona fide reasons\nfrom sham excuses. [Citation.] So long as the trial court makes a sincere and\nreasoned effort to evaluate the nondiscriminatory justifications offered, its\nconclusions are entitled to deference on appeal.‘ ‖ (People v. Lenix (2008) 44\nCal.4th 602, 613–614.)‘ ([People v. Vines (2011)] 51 Cal.4th 830, 848.)‖ (Maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 80.) So far so good: Deference is appropriate where the trial\ncourt makes ―a sincere and reasoned effort‖ to evaluate the prosecutor‘s stated\nreasons for striking a minority juror.\n       I have no doubt the trial court in this case was sincere. But the record\nprovides no basis for us to conclude that the trial court made a reasoned effort to\nanalyze the prosecutor‘s explanations for the strikes. There is no reasoning in the\ntrial court‘s statement that ―no discriminatory intent is inherent in the\nexplanations, and the reasons appear to be race neutral.‖ Moreover, when defense\ncounsel noted that ―[Juror No. 12] is also unmarried‖ in response to the\nprosecutor‘s assertion that he struck prospective juror M.H. in part because\n―[M.H.] is single,‖ the trial court was ―[a]pparently confused by counsel‘s remark‖\nand did not probe the comparison. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 79; see People v. Lenix\n(2008) 44 Cal.4th 602, 624 (Lenix) [trial courts are best positioned to consider\ncomparative juror analysis].) Taken at face value, the trial court‘s mere\nobservation that ―no discriminatory intent is inherent in the explanations, and the\n\n                                           4\n\freasons appear to be race neutral‖ (italics added) does not address whether the\nrace-neutral reasons given by the prosecutor were the actual reasons motivating\nthe strikes. The inquiry at Batson‘s third stage requires more than a determination\nof inherent or apparent plausibility; it ―requires the judge to assess the plausibility\nof [the prosecutor‘s stated] reason in light of all evidence with a bearing on it.‖\n(Miller-El, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 252.) Nothing in the record shows that the trial\ncourt conducted the requisite inquiry.\n       Today‘s opinion attempts to fill the gap in two ways. First, it says the trial\ncourt‘s ―assertion that no discriminatory intent was ‗inherent‘ in the prosecutor‘s\nexplanations is reasonably read as a determination that the court believed them to\nbe true.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 87.) But that reading of the word ―inherent‖ is as\nstrained as it is ironic in light of this court‘s own usage of the word in this context.\n(See Williams, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 653 [a prosecutor‘s explanation is\n―inherently plausible‖ if it is ― ‗not inherently implausible‘ ‖].) Further, right after\nthe trial court used the word ―inherent,‖ it said ―the reasons appear to be race\nneutral‖ (italics added). If the trial court had made a determination that the\nprosecutor‘s reasons were in fact true, why didn‘t it just say so and provide its\nanalysis instead of using doubly qualified, conclusory language? It is this court\nthat ―parses the [trial] court‘s words too closely‖ (maj. opn., ante, at p. 87) instead\nof giving them their plain meaning.\n       Second, today‘s opinion says the trial ―court asked for the relevant juror\nquestionnaires, and it presumably reviewed them. No reason appears to conclude\nthe court failed to consider all the factors bearing on the prosecutor‘s credibility,\nincluding his demeanor, the inherent reasonableness or improbability of his\nproffered explanations, their plausible basis in accepted trial strategy, the court‘s\nown observation of the relevant jurors‘ voir dire, its experience as a trial lawyer\nand judge in the community, and the common practices of the prosecutor‘s office\n\n                                           5\n\fand the individual prosecutor himself.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 87–88. But cf.\nAdkins v. Warden (11th Cir. 2013) 710 F.3d 1241, 1254 [―trial court‘s personal\nexperience with and opinion about the reputation of the prosecutor‖ was not a\nproper consideration at Batson‘s third stage because it was ―non-record evidence\nwhich [the defendant] did not have an opportunity to rebut‖].) There is a wide\nchasm, however, between the absence of reasons to conclude that the trial court\ndid not conduct a proper Batson analysis and the presence of reasons to conclude\nthat it did. (See Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at p. 479 [reviewing court may not credit\njuror demeanor as the reason for a strike where the trial court made no ―specific\nfinding on the record concerning [the juror‘s] demeanor‖ and ―simply allowed the\nchallenge without explanation‖].) If a reviewing court can simply fill the void\nwith a massive pile of presumptions, then we can be assured that many trial courts\nwill continue to deny Batson claims without reasoned explanation. Indeed, we\nmight as well dispense with appellate review in such cases since it is so easy to\nrationalize a silent record with a cacophony of presumptions.\n       The court knows we cannot actually do this under Miller-El and Snyder, so\nits real answer to the problem of unexplained Batson rulings is the following: ―we\nhave made clear that ‗the trial court is not required to explain on the record its\nruling on a Batson/Wheeler motion. (People v. Reynoso [(2003)] 31 Cal.4th [903,]\n919.) ―When the prosecutor‘s stated reasons . . . are both inherently plausible and\nsupported by the record, the trial court need not question the prosecutor or make\ndetailed findings.‖ (People v. Silva (2001) 25 Cal.4th 345, 386.)‘ ([People v.\nVines (2011)] 51 Cal.4th 830, 849.)‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 87, italics added.)\n― ‗ ― ‗ ―[T]he trial court is not required to make specific or detailed comments for\nthe record to justify every instance in which a prosecutor‘s race-neutral reason for\nexercising a peremptory challenge is being accepted by the court as genuine.‖ ‘ ‖\n(People v. Stanley [(2006)] 39 Cal.4th [913,] 936.)‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 80.)\n\n                                           6\n\f       The swarm of internal quotation marks around the rule stated above\nindicates that this court has often found it to be a handy tool in rejecting Batson\nclaims. The discussion in part II below excavates the tenuous origins of this rule\nin our Batson jurisprudence. Here I focus on how our application of the rule\ndilutes the proper inquiry at Batson‘s third step.\n       The problem, in a nutshell, is this: Our court routinely holds that so long as\nthe prosecutor‘s stated reason for striking a minority juror is (1) inherently\nplausible and (2) supported by the record, we must presume that the trial court‘s\ndenial of a Batson motion, even if rendered without any explicit findings or\nanalysis, was premised on a full inquiry into all the relevant circumstances bearing\non the credibility of the prosecutor‘s explanation. That presumption, in turn,\nentitles the trial court‘s ruling to deference on appeal. But to say that a\nprosecutor‘s stated reason is inherently plausible is only to say that it is ―not\n‗inherently implausible.‘ ‖ (Williams, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 653.) That is a far\ncry from evaluating whether the stated reason was likely the actual reason for a\nparticular strike given the totality of relevant circumstances. And to say that a\nprosecutor‘s stated reason is ―supported by the record‖ is only to say that there is\nsome evidence to support the reason or (in an even weaker formulation) that the\nstated reason is not contradicted by the record. (People v. Reynoso (2003) 31\nCal.4th 903, 929 (Reynoso).) Again, that is a far cry from inquiring, based on all\nrelevant circumstances, how likely it is that the stated reason was the actual reason\nfor the strike. The Batson inquiry ultimately requires an assessment of\nlikelihoods; it is the defendant‘s burden to prove that ―it was more likely than not\nthat the challenge was improperly motivated.‖ (Johnson, supra, 545 U.S. at\np. 170.) An explanation can be plausible without being likely, and an explanation\ncan be supported by some evidence or uncontradicted by the record without being\nlikely based on the totality of relevant circumstances. I do not see how the fact\n\n                                           7\n\fthat a proffered reason is inherently plausible and supported by the record enables\nus to presume that the trial court actually reached a decision as to whether it was\nmore likely than not that the proffered reason was pretextual in light of all relevant\ncircumstances.\n       This analytical gap and related errors are apparent in several aspects of\ntoday‘s opinion. Consider the court‘s discussion of the strike against prospective\njuror M.H. On her juror questionnaire, M.H. indicated that she was a 40-year-old\ncomputer consultant with a bachelor‘s degree in math and computer science. She\nwas single and had no children. She had formed no opinions about the present\ncase and expressed no hesitations about her ability to follow the court‘s\ninstructions and serve as an impartial juror. When asked for her general feelings\nabout the death penalty, M.H. wrote ―I am for the death penalty.‖ When asked\nwhether the death penalty has been given too often, too seldom, or randomly,\nM.H. wrote ―I feel the death penalty has been used appropriately. Especially\ngiven that some of the defendants have spent years on death row.‖ M.H. further\nindicated that her views on the death penalty had not changed in the last few years.\nM.H. did not support or belong to any victim rights groups; she did not belong to\nany group advocating either abolition or increased use of the death penalty; she\ndid not have any close friends or relatives who had been arrested or convicted of a\ncrime. M.H. said her views on capital punishment would not cause her to\nautomatically vote for or against the death penalty without considering the\naggravating and mitigating evidence presented.\n       At voir dire, when defense counsel asked whether her support for the death\npenalty stemmed from ―some experience of your own,‖ M.H. said: ―Oh, no, no,\nnot personally. But I figure if someone came to my house and blew my family\naway, I would flip the switch. But that‘s personal, that‘s why I believe in it. But I\ndon‘t — I wouldn‘t sit here and tell this young man, okay, you need it because you\n\n                                          8\n\fkilled somebody, I think there [are] also circumstances. But I know if it was my\nfamily, I couldn‘t honestly say that I wouldn‘t be emotional about it.‖ On further\nquestioning, M.H. confirmed she had no personal experiences related to the death\npenalty but again said ―if it was me personally and my family, that‘s totally\ndifferent for me.‖\n       The prosecutor gave the following explanation for striking M.H.: ―[M.H.]\nis single. She has no children. She is younger than the juror I prefer. She is in her\n30‘s. She is also, her attitude regarding the death penalty was personal and\nemotional, not philosophical. She was the one who talked about, if it was my\nfamily I could understand it. But primarily the reason [is] she is young, single and\nno children. There [are] no other jurors on the jury presently who fit that pattern.‖\n       In assessing the prosecutor‘s explanation, today‘s opinion says that M.H.‘s\nstatements at voir dire ―could give rise to a reasonable concern that her willingness\nto impose this punishment might be influenced by her degree of direct interest in\nthe case‖ (maj. opn., ante, at p. 82) and that the prosecutor ―could reasonably be\nconcerned about her ability to give the death penalty fair consideration when a\nfamily member was not a victim‖ (id. at p. 83). The word ―could‖ makes it hard to\ndisagree insofar as one cannot say that the court‘s posited reading of M.H.‘s\nremarks is entirely implausible. But even if plausible, is it likely that a reasonable\nperson would have understood M.H.‘s statements that way? M.H. clearly stated\nthat her support for the death penalty was unrelated to any personal experience\n(―Oh, no, no, not personally‖). She wrote on her questionnaire that ―I am for the\ndeath penalty‖ and that her view had not changed in the last few years. She\nfurther indicated that ―I feel the death penalty has been used appropriately.\nEspecially given that some of the defendants have spent years on death row.‖ It\ndoes not seem likely that a person familiar with M.H.‘s questionnaire and her full\nanswers at voir dire would have understood her support for the death penalty to be,\n\n                                          9\n\fas the prosecutor put it, ―personal and emotional, not philosophical.‖ M.H.‘s\nremarks simply conveyed that she would have an emotional reaction if her family\nwere murdered (―I would flip the switch‖), not that she did not support or could\nnot apply the death penalty in other circumstances.\n       The court attempts to buttress the prosecutor‘s explanation with the\nfollowing statement: ―Moreover, as the Attorney General observes, M.H.‘s\nsomewhat testy exchange with defense counsel (‗are you misunderstanding me?‘)\ncould also, in combination with the prosecutor‘s personal observation of this\nprospective juror, persuade him her relative youth was a sign of immaturity.‖\n(Maj. opn., ante, at p. 83.) But the inclusion of this sentence in the court‘s Batson\nanalysis is wrong on two counts. First, the prosecutor said one reason he struck\nM.H. was that ―she is young‖ and ―younger than the juror I prefer.‖ The\nprosecutor said nothing about ―immaturity.‖ The prosecutor might have treated\nyouth as a proxy for liberal views, compassion for criminal defendants, or\nsomething else. We do not know what underlies the prosecutor‘s preference, and\nneither the Attorney General nor this court may shore up a reason that the\nprosecutor actually gave with a reason he did not give. (See Miller-El, supra, 545\nU.S. at p. 252 [―[A] prosecutor simply has got to state his reasons as best he can\nand stand or fall on the plausibility of the reasons he gives. . . . If the stated reason\ndoes not hold up, its pretextual significance does not fade because a trial judge, or\nan appeals court, can imagine a reason that might not have been shown up as\nfalse.‖].) Second, under Snyder, we have no basis to credit ―the prosecutor‘s\npersonal observation of this prospective juror‖ (maj. opn., ante, at p. 83) as part of\nthe basis for the strike because ―the record does not show that the trial judge\nactually made a determination concerning [M.H.‘s] demeanor.‖ (Snyder, supra,\n552 U.S. at p. 479.)\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\f       Moreover, the court dismisses the import of comparing M.H. to Juror No.\n12 on the ground that ―Juror No. 12 expressed much stronger views in favor of the\ndeath penalty. Nothing indicates the prosecutor was wrong in suggesting that\nwhen M.H.‘s age, familial status, and death penalty views were considered\ntogether, she was unique among the jurors who had been evaluated at the time the\nprosecutor excused her.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 83.) But recall what the\nprosecutor actually said in striking M.H.: ―[M.H.] is single. She has no children.\nShe is younger than the juror I prefer. She is in her 30‘s. She is also, her attitude\nregarding the death penalty was personal and emotional, not philosophical. She\nwas the one who talked about, if it was my family I could understand it. But\nprimarily the reason [is] she is young, single and no children. There [are] no other\njurors on the jury presently who fit that pattern.‖ The prosecutor begins with his\nconcern that M.H. is young (she was actually 40, not ―in her 30‘s‖), single, and\nwithout children. He then discusses M.H.‘s death penalty views. At the end, he\npivots and prioritizes his opening concern: ―But primarily the reason [is] she is\nyoung, single and no children. There [are] no other jurors on the jury presently\nwho fit that pattern.‖ (Italics added.) It may be possible to construe ―that pattern‖\nto encompass M.H.‘s death penalty views in addition to her age and familial\nstatus. But again, even if such an interpretation is plausible, is it likely that that is\nwhat the prosecutor meant? When the prosecutor‘s last two sentences are read\ntogether, the most natural understanding of his assertion that ―There [are] no other\njurors on the jury presently who fit that pattern‖ is that he believed no other jurors\nwere ―young, single and no children.‖ And on this point, the record shows that\ntwo seated jurors close in age to M.H. were single and without children: Juror No.\n1 (age 45) and Juror No. 12 (age 43).\n       Even if we were to fold in the prosecutor‘s comments about M.H.‘s death\npenalty views as part of ―that pattern,‖ we would have to acknowledge, as\n\n                                           11\n\fdiscussed above, that those comments offer an unlikely (even if plausible)\nrendition of the views she expressed. And once that is acknowledged, it seems\ndoubtful to say that ―Juror No. 12 expressed much stronger views in favor of the\ndeath penalty‖ than M.H. did. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 83.) As to his general\nfeelings about the death penalty, Juror No. 12 wrote on his questionnaire ―I‘m for\nit,‖ whereas M.H. wrote ―I am for the death penalty.‖ Juror No. 12 indicated he\nfelt the death penalty is used ―too seldom‖ and noted ―too many appeals that take\ntoo long‖; M.H. said ―I feel the death penalty has been used appropriately.\nEspecially given that some of the defendants have spent years on death row.‖\nJuror No. 12 qualified his views by indicating that ―if court proved to me that\ndefendant should be spared death – I might not vote death.‖ Further, he noted that\nhis ability to serve as an impartial juror might be affected if ―defendant said he‘d\nfound God and should be spared for that reason.‖ On her questionnaire, M.H. did\nnot qualify her support for the death penalty in any way. The principal difference\nbetween Juror No. 12 and M.H. is that Juror No. 12 wrote on his questionnaire that\nhis cousin-in-law was a fireman who had tried to save the murder victim and that\nhe had already formed an opinion that defendant deserved the death penalty. But\nwe can hardly cite Juror No. 12‘s preconception about this case (as distinct from\nhis views about the death penalty in general) as a proper basis for differentiating\nhim from M.H., since we have upheld the trial court‘s refusal to excuse Juror No.\n12 for cause on the ground that during voir dire he ―consistently indicated that he\ncould and would subordinate his views, carefully weigh and consider the\naggravating and mitigating evidence as instructed, vote for either death or life\nwithout parole as appropriate, and sit fairly in accordance with the juror‘s oath.‖\n(Maj. opn., ante, at p. 76.) Whether there were other differences between Juror\nNo. 12 and M.H. is something we do not know because the trial court, despite\ndefense counsel‘s prompting, did not conduct a comparative juror analysis.\n\n                                         12\n\f       In the end, the court finds only that ―the prosecutor‘s reasons were\nplausible and, in all essential respects, supported‖ (maj. opn., ante, at p. 87)\nbecause that is enough under our precedent to entitle the trial court‘s unexplained\nBatson ruling to deference on appeal. As shown above, this approach cannot be\nreconciled with the high court‘s mandate that ―in considering a Batson objection,\nor in reviewing a ruling claimed to be Batson error, all of the circumstances that\nbear upon the issue of racial animosity must be consulted.‖ (Snyder, supra, 552\nU.S. at p. 478, citing Miller-El, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 239; see Batson, supra, 476\nU.S. at p. 94.) Tellingly, today‘s opinion nowhere actually says that the trial court\nor this court has independently determined, based on all relevant circumstances,\nthat it was not more likely than not that the prosecutor‘s strikes of the three black\nprospective jurors were motivated by race. As in Williams, our decision today\nresults in ―the denial of defendant‘s Batson claim despite the fact that no court,\ntrial or appellate, has ever conducted a proper Batson analysis.‖ (Williams, supra,\n56 Cal.4th at p. 700 (dis. opn. of Liu, J.).)\n                                           II.\n       Although the legal shortcuts that pervade the Batson analysis in today‘s\nopinion are troubling, the reality is that habits of unwarranted deference,\nspeculative inference, and overreliance on gap-filling presumptions have been\nentrenched in our Batson jurisprudence for some time now. As I discuss in People\nv. Harris (Aug. 26, 2013, S081700) __ Cal.4th __, __ [at pp. 33–34] (Harris)\n(conc. opn. of Liu, J.), also filed today, this court has found only one instance of\nunlawful discrimination in jury selection among the 102 cases that have raised\nBatson claims over the past 20 years, and none among the 59 cases that postdate\nMiller-El. This improbable record is attributable, at least in part, to the erroneous\nlegal framework that we continue to apply in evaluating Batson claims. In Harris,\nI discuss the problematic development of our case law on what is required to\n\n                                           13\n\festablish an inference of discrimination at Batson‘s first step. (Harris, at pp. __–\n__ [at pp. 24–28] (conc. opn. of Liu, J.).) Here I trace the development of our\nerroneous rule of deference at Batson‘s third step.\n                                          A.\n       The deferential approach we apply to unexplained Batson rulings was not\nalways a part of our law. In the wake of People v. Wheeler (1978) 22 Cal.3d 258,\nour state-law forerunner of Batson, this court in People v. Hall (1983) 35 Cal.3d\n161 (Hall) emphasized that a trial court, in considering a Wheeler motion, must\nmake ―a sincere and reasoned attempt to evaluate the prosecutor‘s explanation in\nlight of the circumstances of the case as then known, his knowledge of trial\ntechniques, and his observations of the manner in which the prosecutor has\nexamined members of the venire and has exercised challenges.‖ (Id. at pp. 167–\n168.) We did not clearly define what a trial court must do in order to demonstrate\nthat it had made this inquiry, nor did we connect a trial court‘s failure to conduct\nthis inquiry with the level of deference owed on appeal. But we did suggest that a\ntrial court must undertake more than a summary denial if there was some basis for\nquestioning the prosecutor‘s reasons. In Hall, we evaluated the prosecutor‘s\nexplanations and found that some were ―suggestive of bias‖ and ―demanded\nfurther inquiry on the part of the trial court.‖ (Id. at pp. 168–169.) ―Yet the trial\ncourt apparently considered itself bound to accept all of the prosecutor‘s\nexplanations at face value, expressing the view that group bias is shown only when\na prosecutor declares an intent to exclude all members of an ethnic group from the\njury. Such abdication is inconsistent with the court‘s obligations under Wheeler,\nand on authority of that case must be held to constitute error requiring reversal.‖\n(Id. at p. 169, fn. omitted.)\n       In People v. Turner (1986) 42 Cal.3d 711 (Turner), we applied Hall‘s\nrequirement that trial courts make a ―sincere and reasoned attempt to evaluate the\n\n                                          14\n\fprosecutor‘s explanation‖ for striking a minority juror (Hall, supra, 35 Cal.3d at\np. 167). The trial court in Turner had denied defendant‘s Batson motion without\ncomment. We observed that ―the prosecutor‘s explanations were either\nimplausible or suggestive of bias. They therefore ‗demanded further inquiry on\nthe part of the trial court‘ ([Hall] at p. 169), followed by a ‗sincere and reasoned‘\neffort by the court to evaluate their genuineness and sufficiency in light of all the\ncircumstances of the trial (id., at p. 167, italics added). Each step is ‗imperative, if\nthe constitutional guarantee is to have real meaning‘ (ibid.). [¶] We conclude that\n. . . the prosecution failed to sustain its burden of showing that the challenged\nprospective jurors were not excluded because of group bias [citation], and as in\nHall the court failed to discharge its duty to inquire into and carefully evaluate the\nexplanations offered by the prosecutor [citation].‖ (Turner, at p. 728.) On that\nbasis, the court reversed the capital conviction. (Ibid.)\n       We found reversible error on similar grounds in three subsequent capital\ncases, all without dissent. In People v. Snow (1987) 44 Cal.3d 216, the court, in a\nunanimous opinion by Chief Justice Lucas, determined that ―it strongly appears\nthat the trial judge . . . simply accepted at face value the prosecutor‘s denials of\ngroup bias, without making any ‗sincere and reasoned attempt‘ to evaluate the\nprosecutor‘s motives. Under Hall, ‗[s]uch abdication is inconsistent with the\ncourt‘s obligations under Wheeler . . . .‘ ([Hall, supra,] 35 Cal.3d at p. 169.)‖ (Id.\nat p. 226.) Similarly, People v. Fuentes (1991) 54 Cal.3d 707 (Fuentes) held that\nthe trial court failed to conduct ―a truly ‗reasoned attempt‘ to evaluate the\nprosecutor‘s explanations‖ because it did not ―address the challenged jurors\nindividually to determine whether any one of them has been improperly\nexcluded.‖ (Id. at p. 720.) Notably, the court in Fuentes ―reemphasize[d] the trial\ncourt‘s role in making an adequate record when dealing with a Wheeler motion.\nNotwithstanding the deference we give to a trial court‘s determinations of\n\n                                          15\n\fcredibility and sincerity, we can only do so when the court has clearly expressed\nits findings and rulings and the bases therefor.‖ (Id. at p. 716, fn. 5, italics added.)\nA decade later, in People v. Silva (2001) 25 Cal.4th 345 (Silva), we observed that\nthe trial court had failed to probe discrepancies between the prosecutor‘s stated\nreasons and the record of voir dire, and we held that ―[o]n this record, we are\nunable to conclude that the trial court met its obligations to make ‗a sincere and\nreasoned attempt to evaluate the prosecutor‘s explanation‘ ([Hall, supra, 35 Cal.3d\nat pp. 167–168]) and to clearly express its findings ([Fuentes, at p. 716, fn. 5]).‖\n(Silva, at p. 385.)\n\n                                          B.\n       As it turns out, Silva now stands as the sole instance during the past 20\nyears in which this court has found a Batson error. An early sign of erosion of\nHall‘s ―sincere and reasoned‖ evaluation requirement appeared in People v.\nJohnson (1989) 47 Cal.3d 1194, where a divided court accorded deference to the\ntrial court‘s summary and unexplained ruling even though there was some reason\nto question the prosecutor‘s reasons. Justice Mosk, joined by Justice Broussard,\nobserved in dissent that the trial court, instead of actually inquiring into the\nprosecutor‘s explanations, simply said that the prosecutor had stated his reasons\nfor striking eight minority jurors and then ―continued its oral ruling with a\nrambling statement‖ at best implying that the stated reasons were facially neutral,\nnot that they were ―bona fide.‖ (Id. at pp. 1289–1290 (dis. opn. of Mosk, J.).) But\nthe court, after criticizing the dissent for engaging in comparative juror analysis\nand for questioning the plausibility of some of the prosecution‘s explanations,\nemphasized the deference owed to the trial court: ―Here an experienced trial judge\nsaw and heard the entire voir dire proceedings by which defendant‘s jury was\nselected. The record indicates he was aware of his duty under Wheeler to be\nsensitive to the manner in which peremptory challenges were used. He found no\n\n                                          16\n\fimproper use of the peremptory challenges by the prosecutor. Under these\ncircumstances we see no good reason to second-guess his factual determination.‖\n(Id. at p. 1221.)\n       Thereafter, the court cited People v. Johnson in two cases upholding what\nwere essentially summary denials of Batson claims. People v. Cummings (1993) 4\nCal.4th 1233 explained that ―[t]he prosecutor offered adequate justification,\nunrelated to group bias, for the exercise of peremptory challenges. [Citations.] It\nwas not necessary for the court to make additional inquiry. There is no basis in\nthe record for the assertion that the court failed to scrutinize the prosecutor‘s\nreasons to determine if they were pretextual.‖ (Id. at p. 1282.) And the court in\nPeople v. Jackson (1996) 13 Cal.4th 1164 said that ―Wheeler does not require the\ntrial court to conduct further inquiry into the prosecutor‘s race-neutral\nexplanations if, as here, it is satisfied from its observations that any or all of them\nare proper.‖ (Id. at p. 1198.)\n       The court in Silva attempted to reconcile cases like Johnson, Cummings,\nand Jackson with Hall‘s ―sincere and reasoned‖ evaluation requirement as well as\nthe requirement that the trial court ―clearly express[] its findings and rulings and\nthe bases therefor‖ (Fuentes, supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 716, fn. 5). On its facts, Silva\nwas a straightforward case. The prosecutor all but announced at the outset of jury\nselection that he planned to discriminate on the basis of race because a previous\nhung jury in the penalty phase had divided on racial lines. (Silva, supra, 25\nCal.4th at pp. 375–376.) He struck five Hispanic jurors and, when asked to\nexplain, gave reasons that were directly contradicted by the record. (Id. at\npp. 379–381.) The trial court nevertheless denied the defendant‘s motion without\nprobing ―the obvious gap‖ between the prosecutor‘s reasons and the record. (Id. at\np. 385.) This court reversed the death verdict. (Id. at p. 386.)\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\f       In a critical paragraph, the court in Silva said: ―Although we generally\n‗accord great deference to the trial court‘s ruling that a particular reason is\ngenuine,‘ we do so only when the trial court has made a sincere and reasoned\nattempt to evaluate each stated reason as applied to each challenged juror.\n[Citations.]‖ (Silva, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 385–386.) This principle, echoing\nFuentes and Hall, was the ground on which Silva was decided. (See Silva, at\npp. 385 [―On this record, we are unable to conclude that the trial court met its\nobligations to make ‗a sincere and reasoned attempt to evaluate the prosecutor‘s\nexplanation‘ ([Hall, supra, 35 Cal.3d at pp. 167–168]) and to clearly express its\nfindings ([Fuentes, supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 716, fn. 5]).‖].) However, the court in\nSilva went on to add the following two sentences: ―When the prosecutor‘s stated\nreasons are both inherently plausible and supported by the record, the trial court\nneed not question the prosecutor or make detailed findings. But when the\nprosecutor‘s stated reasons are either unsupported by the record, inherently\nimplausible, or both, more is required of the trial court than a global finding that\nthe reasons appear sufficient.‖ (Silva, at p. 386.) The second of these two\nsentences addressed the circumstances in Silva. The first sentence, however, was\ndicta; the court had no occasion in Silva to decide what inquiry or findings a trial\ncourt must make when a prosecutor‘s stated reasons are inherently plausible and\nsupported by the record. Nevertheless, these two sentences have come to\ncomprise the rule that crucially qualifies the trial court‘s obligation to make a\nsincere and reasoned attempt to evaluate the prosecutor‘s explanations at Batson‘s\nthird stage.\n       Two years later, the court in Reynoso turned Silva‘s dicta into doctrine. In\nthat case involving two Hispanic defendants, the prosecutor exercised only four\nperemptory challenges, the last two of which were directed at the only two\nHispanic prospective jurors then on the panel. (Reynoso, supra, 31 Cal.4th at\n\n                                          18\n\fp. 909.) After the trial court found that the defense had established a prima facie\ncase of discrimination, the prosecutor explained that he struck one of the two\nHispanic panelists, Elizabeth G., because she was a ― ‗customer service\nrepresentative‘ ‖ and therefore ― ‗did not have enough educational experience,‘ ‖\nand because ― ‗[i]t seemed like [Elizabeth G.] was not paying attention to the\nproceedings and . . . that she was not involved in the process.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 911.)\nThe trial court immediately ruled as follows: ― ‗And I accept those reasons as\nbeing not based upon race or ethnicity. And I don‘t find that there has been a\nviolation of Wheeler and that the — there was not a systematic exclusion of a\nrecognized ethnic group, i.e., Hispanics in this case. So the motion is denied.‘ ‖\n(Ibid.) Defense counsel then argued that nothing in Elizabeth G.‘s demeanor\njustified the strike. (Id. at pp. 911–912.) The trial court did not comment further\nexcept to note that the defense had also struck one Hispanic panelist. (Id. at\npp. 912–913.)\n       This court, in a four-to-three decision, upheld the trial court‘s ruling. While\nacknowledging that a trial court ― ‗must ―make a sincere and reasoned attempt to\nevaluate the prosecutor‘s explanation . . . .‖ (People v. Hall (1983) 35 Cal.3d 161,\n167–168)‘ [Citation],‖ the court in Reynoso said that ―in fulfilling that obligation,\nthe trial court is not required to make specific or detailed comments for the record\nto justify every instance in which a prosecutor‘s race-neutral reason for exercising\na peremptory challenge is being accepted by the court as genuine. This is\nparticularly true where the prosecutor‘s race-neutral reason for exercising a\nperemptory challenge is based on the prospective juror‘s demeanor, or similar\nintangible factors, while in the courtroom.‖ (Reynoso, supra, 31 Cal.4th at\np. 919.) The court went on to highlight the dicta from Silva that ― ‗[w]hen the\nprosecutor’s stated reasons are both inherently plausible and supported by the\nrecord, the trial court need not question the prosecutor or make detailed\n\n                                          19\n\ffindings.‘ ‖ (Reynoso, at p. 923, quoting Silva, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 386, italics\nadded by Reynoso.)\n       The court then determined that the trial court had satisfied its obligations\nand that its ruling was entitled to deference. The court acknowledged that the\nprosecutor‘s first reason for striking Elizabeth G. — her lack of ― ‗educational\nexperience‘ ‖ — was ―of questionable persuasiveness,‖ at least ―when viewed\nobjectively.‖ (Reynoso, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 924.) But her ―answers to the\ngeneral questions‖ did confirm that she worked as customer service representative.\n(Ibid.) Noting that she also had ―no prior jury experience and no past contact with\nthe criminal justice system‖ — facts not mentioned by the prosecutor in explaining\nthis strike — the court concluded that a prosecutor ―arguably could conclude in\nsincerity‖ that a prospective juror like Elizabeth G. ―would not be the best type of\njuror for the case.‖ (Id. at pp. 924–925.) The court justified this conclusion with\nadditional speculation: ―Such a determination might be further supported by a\nmyriad of factors readily observable by those present in the courtroom, but not by\nthose who are reviewing the case from a cold transcribed record on appeal.‖ (Id.\nat p. 925.)\n       As to the prosecutor‘s second reason for striking Elizabeth G. — that she\nappeared inattentive — the court acknowledged that ―the trial court made no\nattempt to clarify or probe the prosecutor‘s reasons for finding Elizabeth G.‘s\ndemeanor while in the jury box unsuited to jury service.‖ (Reynoso, supra, 31\nCal.4th at p. 926.) ―But,‖ the court said, ―the trial court did expressly accept the\nprosecutor‘s race-neutral reasons for the peremptory challenge to Elizabeth G.,\nfinding them sincere and genuine. Since the trial court was in the best position to\nobserve the prospective jurors‘ demeanor and the manner in which the prosecutor\nexercised his peremptory challenges, the implied finding, that the prosecutor‘s\nreasons for excusing Elizabeth G., including the demeanor-based reason, were\n\n                                          20\n\fsincere and genuine, is entitled to ‗great deference‘ on appeal. [Citations.]‖ (Ibid.,\nitalics added.) The court added that it found nothing ―in the record to directly\ncontradict‖ the trial court‘s ruling and noted that the prosecutor accepted the jury\n―14 times with Elizabeth G. seated in the jury box.‖ (Ibid.)\n       Reynoso went on to state the following rule, which is now boilerplate\nlanguage in our case law: ―Where . . . the trial court is fully apprised of the nature\nof the defense challenge to the prosecutor‘s exercise of a particular peremptory\nchallenge, where the prosecutor‘s reasons for excusing the juror are neither\ncontradicted by the record nor inherently implausible (Silva, supra, 25 Cal.4th at\np. 386), and where nothing in the record is in conflict with the usual presumptions\nto be drawn, i.e., that all peremptory challenges have been exercised in a\nconstitutional manner, and that the trial court has properly made a sincere and\nreasoned evaluation of the prosecutor‘s reasons for exercising his peremptory\nchallenges, then those presumptions may be relied upon, and a Batson/Wheeler\nmotion denied, notwithstanding that the record does not contain detailed findings\nregarding the reasons for the exercise of each such peremptory challenge.‖\n(Reynoso, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 929.)\n       Justice Kennard, joined by Justice Werdegar and Justice Moreno, dissented.\nJustice Kennard observed that in ―[b]rushing . . . aside‖ the fact that the trial court\nhad ruled on the Batson motion without questioning the prosecutor, making\nparticularized findings, stating the proper legal standard, or addressing the factual\ndisputes raised by the defense, the court had ―indulge[d] a presumption that both\nthe prosecutor and the trial court acted properly, thereby adopting a standard of\nappellate review that effectively insulates discriminatory strikes from meaningful\nscrutiny at both the trial and appellate stages.‖ (Reynoso, supra, 31 Cal.4th p. 930\n(dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) According to Justice Kennard, the prosecutor‘s\nreliance on Elizabeth G.‘s employment as a customer service representative was\n\n                                          21\n\fthe sort of implausible explanation that required further investigation and explicit\nfindings, and the trial court made no effort to resolve the disputed claim that\nElizabeth G. had not been paying attention. (Id. at pp. 931–932). ―Appellate\ndeference is unwarranted where, as here, the record supplies many reasons to\ndoubt that the trial court even made a credibility determination, much less a\ndetermination resulting from a sincere and reasoned effort.‖ (Id. at p. 935.)\n       Justice Moreno authored a separate dissent joined by Justice Kennard and\nJustice Werdegar. After observing that the record did not support either of the\nprosecutor‘s stated reasons for striking Elizabeth G. (Reynoso, supra, 31 Cal.4th at\npp. 940–942 (dis. opn. of Moreno, J.)), Justice Moreno concluded: ―Whereas\nSilva held that a trial court‘s obligation to inquire was triggered by a race-neutral\nexcuse unsupported by the record, the majority today holds that such an obligation\nis triggered only where such an excuse is contradicted by the record. However,\nwhere the unexamined race-neutral excuse belies common sense or is contradicted\nby defense counsel, we cannot presume that the prosecutor has exercised the\nperemptory challenge in a constitutional manner.‖ (Id. at p. 943; see id. at p. 940\n[―today, without a sound basis in logic or law, a majority of this court elevates\nSilva‘s ‗unsupported by the record‘ standard to a much stricter ‗contradicted by\nthe record‘ standard‖].)\n       The rule set forth in Reynoso, which departed in essential respects from\nSilva, Fuentes, and Hall, effectively put this court on a glide path toward affirming\nunexplained trial court rulings denying Batson motions. As demonstrated by our\nrepeated quotation and application of Reynoso‘s rule in case after case, it has been\neasy for the court to find a prosecutor‘s stated reasons to be inherently plausible\nand either supported or not contradicted by the record, and then to defer to the trial\ncourt‘s ruling on that basis. (See, e.g., maj. opn., ante, at pp. 80, 87; Williams,\nsupra, 56 Cal.4th at pp. 653–659; People v. Vines (2011) 51 Cal.4th 830, 849–\n\n                                          22\n\f850; People v. Watson (2008) 43 Cal.4th 652, 670–673; People v. Guerra (2006)\n37 Cal.4th 1067, 1103.)\n\n                                          C.\n       This court has never reconsidered Reynoso in light of the high court‘s\ndecisions in Miller-El and Snyder, even though those authorities call into serious\nquestion our rule of deference to unexplained Batson rulings. Contrary to\nReynoso, the high court in Snyder squarely held that a reviewing court may not\naccept a prosecutor‘s demeanor-based explanation for striking a minority juror in\nthe absence of a trial court finding as to the juror‘s demeanor, at least where\ndefense counsel has disputed the issue. (See Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at p. 479\n[―Rather than making a specific finding on the record concerning Mr. Brooks‘\ndemeanor, the trial judge simply allowed the challenge without explanation. . . .\n[W]e cannot presume that the trial judge credited the prosecutor‘s assertion that\nMr. Brooks was nervous.‖].)\n       More broadly, Miller-El and Snyder elucidate by example the careful and\nthorough inquiry required at Batson‘s third step, and those decisions make clear\nthat the totality of circumstances relevant to evaluating the credibility of a\nprosecutor‘s stated reasons for striking a minority juror includes comparative juror\nanalysis. (See Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at pp. 479–485; Miller-El, supra, 545 U.S.\nat pp. 240–266.) Our precedent indulges the presumption that a trial court has\nconducted this rigorous inquiry, despite no indication in the record that it did, so\nlong as the prosecutor‘s stated reason is inherently plausible and not contradicted\nby the record. However, by packing into a presumption the entire inquiry into ―the\nplausibility of [the prosecutor‘s stated] reason in light of all evidence with a\nbearing on it‖ (Miller-El, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 252), we have ―adopt[ed] a\nstandard of appellate review that effectively insulates discriminatory strikes from\nmeaningful scrutiny at both the trial and appellate stages.‖ (Reynoso, supra, 31\n\n                                          23\n\fCal.4th p. 930 (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) Our rule of deference to summary\nBatson rulings all but assumes the answer to the question that Batson analysis is\ndesigned to address.\n       As today‘s opinion demonstrates, the application of this rule of deference\ntends to foster judicial rationalization of a prosecutor‘s strikes in a manner that\nBatson does not permit. It is all too tempting for a reviewing court, in speculating\non the possible dynamics in the courtroom, to posit reasons in support of a trial\ncourt‘s Batson ruling that the prosecutor did not give. As noted, the court in this\ncase relies on a four-word comment by M.H. to defense counsel (―are you\nmisunderstanding me?‖) to suggest that the prosecutor may have struck M.H.\nbecause ―her relative youth was a sign of immaturity,‖ even though the prosecutor\ncited only M.H.‘s youth, not her immaturity, as a reason for the strike. (Maj. opn.,\nante, at p. 83; see ante, at pp. 9–10.) And in Reynoso, the court reasoned that the\nfact that Elizabeth G. had ―no prior jury experience‖ and ―no prior contact with the\ncriminal justice system‖ could support the sincerity of the prosecutor‘s strike, even\nthough the prosecutor never mentioned those aspects of Elizabeth G.‘s background\nin explaining the strike. (Reynoso, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 925.) These maneuvers\nviolate the high court‘s admonition that adjudication of a Batson challenge ―does\nnot call for a mere exercise in thinking up any rational basis.‖ (Miller-El, supra,\n545 U.S. at p. 252.) A prosecutor‘s strike must ―stand or fall on the plausibility of\nthe reasons he gives,‖ regardless of whether ―a trial judge, or an appeals court, can\nimagine a reason that might not have been shown up as false.‖ (Ibid.)\n       It is no doubt true that ―a myriad of factors readily observable by those\npresent in the courtroom, but not by those who are reviewing the case from a cold\ntranscribed record on appeal,‖ may properly inform a Batson ruling. (Reynoso,\nsupra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 925.) For this reason, the trial court is in the best position\nto make the all-things-considered judgment required at Batson‘s third stage.\n\n                                          24\n\fWhen a trial court has conducted the requisite analysis and has articulated the\nfindings that inform its Batson ruling, the principle of judicial restraint fully\nsupports the application of deference on appeal. But when the ―myriad of factors\nreadily observable to those present in the courtroom‖ is simply left to judicial\nspeculation on appeal, the application of deference does not reflect restraint at all.\nIt is instead an active imagining of inquiries and analyses that may or may not\nhave occurred. Like my colleagues, I am confident that our trial courts approach\nthe evaluation of Batson claims with competence and sincerity. But jury selection\ncan be a complex process, and in the context of a particular strike, a trial court\nmay have ―stopped taking notes‖ (Williams, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 651), it may\nhave neglected to consult the record of voir dire (id. at p. 716 (dis. opn. of Liu,\nJ.)), it ―may not have recalled [a juror‘s] demeanor‖ (Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at\np. 479), it may have declined to engage in comparative juror analysis despite the\nurging of counsel (maj. opn., ante, at p. 79), it may have applied an erroneous\nlegal standard in assessing a Batson claim (Reynoso, at pp. 933–934 (dis. opn. of\nKennard, J.), or it may have made an unreasonable judgment under the totality of\ncircumstances (Miller-El, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 266). Filling these gaps on appeal\nwith speculation and presumptions is not an exercise of judicial restraint. It is also\ncounterproductive. Our ―don‘t ask, don‘t tell‖ approach to appellate review —\nwhereby this court does not ask, when trial courts do not tell, the reasons for their\nBatson rulings — erodes the incentive for trial courts to articulate their findings\nand analysis, thereby heightening the frequency with which reviewing courts must\nresolve Batson claims on the basis of a paper record.\n       More fundamentally, in light of what decades of research have revealed\nabout the stubborn role of race in jury selection (see Harris, supra, __ Cal.4th at\npp. __–__ [at pp. 35–39] (conc. opn. of Liu, J.) [reviewing studies], it seems\nempirically suspect — if not downright unfair — to apply a rule of deference\n\n                                          25\n\fwhose practical effect is to hold that what a trial court leaves unsaid in denying a\nBatson claim will be construed on appeal in favor of the prosecution. The Batson\ninquiry ultimately focuses on the subjective genuineness of the prosecutor‘s stated\nreasons. It is a motive test, and short of a naked admission, it can be difficult to\ndetermine a person‘s motive with reasonable certainty. The law properly\naddresses this uncertainty by placing on the defendant the burden to prove it was\nmore likely than not that the prosecutor‘s strike was motivated by race. The proof\nstandard and the allocation of the burden to the defendant can be decisive in a\nclose case, as I show below. (See post, at pp. 27–29.) But the law should not\naddress the uncertainty by construing against the defendant all that we cannot\nknow — because the trial court provided no findings or analysis — about what\nactually happened in the courtroom.\n       Our earlier precedent held trial courts to their obligation to make ―a sincere\nand reasoned attempt to evaluate the prosecutor‘s explanation‖ (Hall, supra, 35\nCal.3d at p. 167) and underscored ―the trial court‘s role in making an adequate\nrecord‖ by declaring that ―[n]otwithstanding the deference we give to a trial\ncourt‘s determinations of credibility and sincerity, we can only do so when the\ncourt has clearly expressed its findings and rulings and the bases therefor‖\n(Fuentes, supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 716, fn. 5). Many trial courts do articulate the\ngrounds for their Batson rulings, and it is entirely appropriate to make appellate\ndeference contingent on this practice. For what is at issue is not some minor legal\ntechnicality, but a vital inquiry that implicates the most basic notions of fairness in\nour justice system. The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized\nthe three-dimensional harm that results from racial discrimination in jury\nselection. The defendant is deprived of his ―right to be tried by a jury whose\nmembers are selected pursuant to non-discriminatory criteria.‖ (Batson, supra,\n476 U.S. at pp. 85–86.) The excluded juror ―suffers a profound personal\n\n                                          26\n\fhumiliation heightened by its public character‖ and loses ―a significant\nopportunity to participate in civic life.‖ (Powers v. Ohio (1991) 499 U.S. 400,\n413–414, 409.) And ―[t]he harm from discriminatory jury selection extends\nbeyond that inflicted on the defendant and the excluded juror to touch the entire\ncommunity. Selection procedures that purposefully exclude black persons from\njuries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.‖\n(Batson, at p. 87; see Miller-El, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 238 [―[T]he very integrity of\nthe courts is jeopardized when a prosecutor‘s discrimination ‗invites cynicism\nrespecting the jury‘s neutrality,‘ [citation], and undermines public confidence in\nadjudication [citations].‖]; Powers, at p. 412.) In light of these potential harms, it\ndoes not seem too much to insist that trial courts or, as a failsafe, reviewing courts\ndemonstrate a truly reasoned effort to evaluate a defendant‘s assertion of this\nimportant right in light of all the circumstances bearing on it.\n                                         III.\n       Because we cannot defer to the trial court‘s Batson ruling in this case, we\nmust independently examine the record to determine whether defendant has shown\nthat it was more likely than not that one or more of the prosecutor‘s strikes were\nmotivated by race.\n       The record shows that the prosecutor struck all three black prospective\njurors in the venire. This fact properly raises a suspicion but does not by itself\nprove discrimination. The significance of the pattern is attenuated in this case by\nthe fact that the prosecutor gave credible reasons for striking two of the black\njurors, P.F. and L.P. In her questionnaire and voir dire, P.F. consistently said she\nviewed the death penalty as an appropriate punishment for a person who has\nshown ―a pattern‖ of violence or disregard for life. When the prosecutor asked\nP.F. if her focus on a pattern of behavior ―wasn‘t something exclusive,‖ she\nagreed. But P.F., when using her own words, did not voice support for the death\n\n                                          27\n\fpenalty in terms other than as punishment for ―a pattern‖ of behavior, and no other\nseated or alternate juror expressed similar views. I thus conclude that the\nprosecutor‘s concern that P.F. had said ―in her questionnaire [that the death\npenalty] was appropriate only where there was a pattern of violent conduct‖ was,\nin all likelihood, not pretextual. And I reach the same conclusion about the\nprosecutor‘s strike of L.P. based on his concerns that ―[s]he is a social worker,‖ a\nfact unique to L.P. as compared to the seated and alternate jurors, and that ―she\ncouldn‘t vote for the death penalty unless . . . the facts were proved beyond a\nshadow of a doubt,‖ a natural understanding of L.P.‘s remarks at voir dire.\n       Having found it improbable that the prosecutor struck P.F. or L.P. because\nof their race, I would examine the prosecutor‘s strike of M.H. without any\nsuspicion arising from the fact that it occurred as part of an apparent pattern. Still,\nthe strike appears suspicious because, as noted, the prosecutor‘s characterization\nof M.H.‘s attitude regarding the death penalty as ―personal and emotional, not\nphilosophical‖ is a strained interpretation of what she said at voir dire, especially\nwhen considered in light of the views she indicated on her questionnaire. (Ante, at\npp. 8–9.) Further, with respect to the prosecutor‘s concern that ―she is young,\nsingle and no children,‖ his claim that ―no other jurors . . . fit that pattern‖ appears\nquestionable in light of the fact that two seated jurors, Juror No. 1 and Juror No.\n12, were single, childless, and close in age to M.H. (Ante, at pp. 10–11.) Juror\nNo. 12‘s general views in favor of the death penalty were not very different from\nM.H.‘s (ante, at pp. 11–12), and Juror No. 1 said on her questionnaire that the\ndeath penalty should be used ―[o]nly in extreme cases,‖ though during voir dire\nshe said she had no particular case in mind and ―it would depend on everything.‖\n       At the same time, comparative juror analysis reveals an important fact that\nsupports the prosecutor‘s credibility. Besides M.H., three prospective jurors\nstruck by the prosecutor were young, single, and without children: K.D. (age 28),\n\n                                           28\n\fA.L. (age 20), and T.F. (age 33). In addition, all three indicated support for the\ndeath penalty. K.D. wrote on her questionnaire that the death penalty ―should be\nimposed‖ in appropriate cases, and she said during voir dire that she would be able\nto follow the court‘s instructions and vote for death if the aggravating factors\noutweighed the mitigating factors. A.L. wrote that she had no strong ―personal\nfeelings about the law‖ and would ―do what [she was] supposed to,‖ and affirmed\nduring voir dire that she could personally vote to impose the death penalty. T.F.\nstated that he believed the death penalty was the ―appropriate and just\npunishment‖ in certain cases, and that he would ―disagree‖ with the Legislature if\nit were to get rid of it. The fact that the prosecutor struck three other young,\nsingle, and childless pro-death penalty jurors lends credence to the prosecutor‘s\nstatement, in explaining why he struck M.H., that ―primarily the reason [is] she is\nyoung, single and no children‖ (italics added). By indicating that the prosecutor\ndid not single out M.H. among all other prospective jurors possessing those\ncharacteristics, the prosecutor‘s strikes of K.D., A.L., and T.F. tend to diminish the\ninference of discrimination arising from the fact that the prosecutor did not also\nstrike Juror No. 1 and Juror No.12, both of whom were slightly older than M.H.\n       Ultimately, the prosecutor‘s strikes of K.D., A.L., and T.F. make the\npossibility that he struck M.H. primarily because she was young, single, and\nwithout children at least as likely as the possibility that he struck M.H. because of\nher race. Based on an independent examination of the record, I conclude that\ndefendant has not carried his burden of proving that it was more likely than not\nthat the prosecutor struck M.H. because of her race. Accordingly, defendant‘s\nBatson claim must be rejected.\n       In all other respects, I join the court‘s opinion affirming the judgment.\n\n\n                                                  LIU, J.\n\n                                          29\n\fSee next page for addresses and telephone numbers for counsel who argued in Supreme Court.\n\nName of Opinion People v.

Code, §§ 187, 189).1 The court\nfurther found true, as a special circumstance, the allegation that the killing was\nintentional, and that defendant knew or should have known the victim was a peace\nofficer engaged in the performance of duty. (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(7) (section\n190.2(a)(7).) A penalty jury returned a death verdict. The automatic motion for\nmodification of the verdict (§ 190.4, subd. (e)) was denied, and defendant was\nsentenced to death. This appeal is automatic. (Cal. Const., art. VI, § 11, subd. (a);\nPen. Code, § 1239, subd. (b).) We will affirm the judgment in its entirety.\n\n\n\n\n1       All further unlabeled statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\f                                      FACTS\n\n       A. Guilt and special circumstance evidence.\n       As to the criminal charge of first degree murder and the peace officer\nspecial circumstance allegation, defendant waived his jury trial, self-incrimination,\nand confrontation rights, and stipulated that the court would determine those issues\nfrom the preliminary hearing transcript. That transcript included the following\nevidence.\n       About 8:30 p.m. on July 13, 1996, Bernice Sarthou pulled into the Pepe‘s\nMexican Restaurant on North Placentia Avenue just south of its intersection with\nNutwood Avenue in Fullerton. The sun was still up, so she was wearing her\nprescription sunglasses. She left her car and entered the restaurant, but saw it was\nfull, so she returned to her car and got into the drive-through line. As she did so,\nshe saw a patrol car, with its lights flashing, stopped behind a white BMW. A\nyoung Vietnamese male was sitting in the driver‘s seat of the BMW, and a\nuniformed officer was sitting in the patrol car. When Sarthou looked at the\nBMW‘s driver, he leaned forward, gripped his steering wheel, and gave her a\n―hard stare.‖\n       As the drive-through line moved forward, Sarthou lost sight of the two cars\nshe had seen. She ordered her dinner, received it, and pulled into a parking area to\neat. By this time, she had removed her sunglasses and put on her regular glasses,\nthough there was still some sun. From her parking place, the front of the BMW\nwas again in view, at a distance of 35 to 40 feet. She saw the officer lean into the\ndriver‘s window of the BMW. When she looked up again, the officer and the\nBMW driver were standing outside that car. They seemed to be struggling for\npossession of something. Almost immediately, she heard five shots, and the\nofficer fell. The BMW driver then walked up to the officer and shot him in the\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fhead. After doing so, defendant got into the officer‘s car and drove away. At the\npreliminary hearing, Sarthou positively identified defendant as the man who shot\nthe officer.\n       Around 9:30 p.m. that evening, Douglas Kennedy, a Fullerton Police\nDepartment homicide detective, was advised of the shooting of a California\nHighway Patrol (CHP) officer at 2950 Nutwood Avenue in Fullerton. He\nresponded to the scene. There he found a white 1995 BMW 525i sedan. No CHP\npatrol vehicle was present. Adjacent to the BMW were shell casings, a\nconsiderable amount of blood, and various personal items.2 The latter included a\npolice officer‘s ―Sam Brown‖ belt with holster attached, a handcuff case, a pager\nin a leather holder, an ammunition pouch, and a BMW car key. A wallet\ncontaining identification with defendant‘s name and picture was found on the front\nfloorboard of the BMW.\n       Officer Burt‘s citation book was also nearby. This indicated he had begun\nto write a ticket for a suspended driver‘s license in the name of Phu Duc Nguyen,\nbut the ticket had not been signed by the person being cited. There was a bloody\nshoeprint on the citation book. Also on the ground, near the rear of the BMW,\nwas a ―CHP 180 form,‖ which an officer fills out before impounding a vehicle.\nThe information on the form was for the 1995 BMW. At the front of the vehicle,\ntraveler‘s checks in a paper bag were discovered.\n       Later that night, Officer Burt‘s patrol car was found abandoned in the\ndriveway of a Ford dealership located at the corner of South Loara Street and West\nLincoln Avenue in Anaheim. Defendant lived close to the dealership, at 1780\nWest Lincoln Avenue. A witness saw an Asian male run from the dealership that\n\n2    The victim‘s body had been removed from the scene by the time Detective\nKennedy arrived.\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\fevening, jump over the bumper of a parked Honda, and proceed in the direction of\ndefendant‘s residence. A shoeprint was recovered from the Honda‘s bumper.\n       Officer Burt died from multiple gunshot wounds. There were entry wounds\nbehind his left ear, in his upper right arm, in the back of his left thigh, behind his\nleft ankle, just above his right buttocks, and in his left buttocks. The arm wound\ncaused the humerus bone in his right arm to fracture. The fatal bullets were the\none that entered behind his left ear and exited through his right eye, and those that\nentered his buttocks and traveled upward through his torso into his intestines,\nstomach, and lungs. Gunpowder residue on the entry wound behind the victim‘s\near indicated this bullet had been fired at very close range.\n       Chang ―Alex‖ Nguyen testified that at the time of Officer Burt‘s murder,\nNguyen and defendant were engaged in an ongoing criminal enterprise whereby\nNguyen purchased from defendant, on a weekly basis, large quantities of forged\ntraveler‘s and payroll checks. On the evening of July 13, 1996, defendant\ntelephoned Nguyen in Houston, Texas, where Nguyen lived. Defendant said he\nwas in ― ‗deep shit‘ ‖ because he had ― ‗just [taken] down a California Highway\nPatrolman,‘ ‖ and he needed a place to ― ‗lay low.‘ ‖ The next night, defendant\nflew to Dallas, where Nguyen picked him up at the airport.\n       During the drive from Dallas to Houston, defendant recounted that on the\nevening of July 13, he was pulled over by a CHP officer because his lights were\noff, though defendant thought they were on. Defendant believed he had an\noutstanding warrant, so he did not present his own driver‘s license to the officer,\nand instead ―used somebody else‘s name‖ when identifying himself. That name\n―[came] back as [a] suspended . . . license.‖ The officer removed defendant from\nhis car and told defendant he would have to tow it. At this point, defendant had a\n―gut feeling something was going to go wrong.‖ He suggested the officer just give\nhim a ticket, tow the car, and tell him where to pick it up. The officer responded\n\n                                           4\n\f―[f]ine,‖ but said he had to check the trunk and do an inventory. Defendant then\nknew ―something [was] going to happen‖ because he had ―stuff‖ in the car.3\n       Defendant told Nguyen that the officer then opened the trunk, pulled out a\nbag, opened it, looked inside, and immediately advised defendant he was under\narrest. Defendant already had two ―strikes‖ against him, was afraid a third\nconviction would lead to life imprisonment, and wanted to leave no witnesses. So\nhe drew his gun and shot the officer three times. The officer fell, but was still\n―twitching.‖ Defendant did not want the officer to suffer, and wanted to make\nsure he left no witnesses, so he shot the officer four more times. Defendant then\nlooked for his own car keys, but could not find them, so he took the officer‘s gun,\ngot into the patrol car, and drove away. Defendant abandoned that vehicle\n―somewhere‖ and paid a ―Mexican guy‖ $100 for a ride to a friend‘s house.\n       Shortly after arriving at Nguyen‘s Houston apartment, defendant said he\nneeded to shop for new clothes, particularly new shoes, because he had gotten\nblood on his shoes and had not been able to clean it all off. Nguyen noticed a dark\nspot on the sneakers defendant was wearing.\n       On the way to a shopping mall after his arrival in Houston, defendant made\na cell phone call, apparently to a friend, and asked whether the person called had\ntaken care of ― ‗that package I left for you.‘ ‖ The other person said something,\nand defendant then declared, ― ‗Well, you better because it‘s very important.‘ ‖\nAfter hanging up, defendant told Nguyen he had ― ‗something . . . important I need\nto have my friend get rid of,‘ ‖ and wanted to ― ‗make sure it‘s been done right.‘ ‖\n       Two or three days after defendant‘s arrival in Houston, Nguyen and his\nlawyer contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), met with an agent,\n\n3      Nguyen said he and defendant used the word ―stuff‖ when discussing the\nforged checks Nguyen was buying from defendant.\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fand told the agent of defendant‘s confession and location. Defendant was arrested\nin Nguyen‘s Houston apartment by FBI agents and local law enforcement officers.\n       When arrested, defendant was not wearing shoes, but a pair of Kmart tennis\nshoes were found beneath the sofa on which he had been sleeping. A substance\nresembling dried blood was observed on these shoes. At the preliminary hearing,\nNguyen identified these shoes from photographs as the ones defendant was\nwearing, and wanted to replace, when he arrived from California. The sole pattern\non these shoes was consistent with the bloody shoe print on Officer Burt‘s citation\nbook. A comparison between these shoes and the shoe print left on the bumper of\nthe Honda yielded a ―positive match.‖\n       Victoria Pham, defendant‘s girlfriend, testified she had assisted him in\nleasing a white BMW. She saw him in the car between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. on\nJuly 13, 1996. The next day, he telephoned her and told her ―something [had]\nhappened‖ to the BMW, and it was hers.\n       No defense evidence was presented at the preliminary hearing.\n\n       B. Prosecution’s penalty phase evidence.\n       A jury was sworn to determine the issue of penalty. As a factor in\naggravation, the prosecution presented extensive evidence about the factual\ncircumstances of Officer Burt‘s murder, and about its impact on surviving victims.\n(§ 190.3, factor (a).) Also presented in aggravation was evidence of other crimes\nby defendant involving violence or the threat of violence. (Id., factor (b).)\nFinally, the prosecution introduced evidence that defendant had sustained several\nprior felony convictions. (Id., factor (c).)\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\f           1. Facts of the capital crime.\n       The evidence on this subject was consistent with the prosecution‘s showing\nat the preliminary hearing, but included several additional witnesses and certain\nadditional details.\n       Fullerton Reserve Police Officer Michael Lyman testified that between\n8:00 p.m. and 8:20 p.m. on July 13, 1996, he was driving through the intersection\nof Nutwood and Placentia Avenues when he noticed a CHP car, with its lights\nflashing, parked behind a white BMW. The CHP officer, who was writing the\nBMW driver a ticket, gave Lyman a ―Code 4‖ signal, meaning everything was all\nright and no assistance was needed. Though Lyman first tentatively identified\nanother man as the BMW‘s driver, he later positively identified defendant from a\nphoto lineup.\n       Around 8:30 p.m. on July 13, 1996, Benjamin Baldauf was preparing to\nenter and register at a hotel near the intersection of Placentia and Nutwood. He\nnoticed a CHP vehicle making a traffic stop of a white BMW. Baldauf described\nthe lighting at this time as ―long on shadows, just before dark.‖ As Baldauf\nentered the hotel, the CHP officer appeared to be examining the trunk of the\nBMW.\n       After registering at the hotel, Baldauf and his daughter walked toward the\nPepe‘s Restaurant on Placentia. The officer was still sorting through the BMW‘s\ntrunk, but seemed relaxed. However, the BMW driver appeared nervous; his eyes\nwere ―darting . . . wildly.‖ This bothered Baldauf, so he looked back toward the\nstopped vehicles as he proceeded on toward the restaurant. Baldauf saw the\nofficer approach the driver‘s door of the BMW, at which point ―[t]he [BMW]\ndriver came out shooting.‖ Baldauf counted at least five shots in rapid succession.\nThe BMW driver and the officer struggled and fell together; the shooter appeared\nto take something from the officer, then stood up and shot him in the neck or head\n\n\n                                         7\n\fat close range. Baldauf remembered seeing some traveler‘s checks on the ground\nnear the officer, which ―didn‘t make sense.‖ In court, Baldauf positively\nidentified defendant as the shooter.\n       Bernice Sarthou testified, consistently with her preliminary hearing\naccount, as follows: Around 8:30 p.m. on July 13, 1996, as she pulled into the\nPepe‘s Restaurant on Placentia, she noticed a CHP vehicle, with its lights flashing,\nparked behind a white BMW. As she waited in the restaurant‘s drive-through line,\nshe stared absently at the BMW‘s driver. He leaned forward and gave her a ―hard\nlook,‖ even though she was wearing sunglasses that would have prevented the\ndriver from seeing if she was looking at him. After ordering and receiving her\nfood, she parked where she could see the front half of the BMW. When she\nlooked up, the BMW driver was out of his car and the CHP officer was close to\nthe driver, near the driver‘s door of the BMW. Sarthou heard four rapid shots, and\nthe officer fell. The BMW driver started to walk away, but returned and shot the\nofficer in the head. The shooter then ran out of Sarthou‘s view, but moments later,\nshe saw the CHP car leaving. Sarthou positively identified defendant as the driver\nof the BMW and the shooter of Officer Burt.\n       Around 8:15 p.m. on July 13, 1996, Robert Excell was traveling\nsouthbound on Placentia. While stopped for a red light at the intersection with\nNutwood, he heard multiple gunshots. He turned right onto Nutwood, looked to\nhis left, and saw a police car with its overhead lights on. Excell continued west on\nNutwood, intending to pass under the State Route 57 freeway, then turn left to\nenter the southbound freeway on-ramp. As he proceeded, he saw a CHP car come\nup behind a vehicle in the adjacent lane. The CHP car‘s overhead lights were\nflashing, and defendant was driving it. Defendant veered into the far right lane,\nhonked as if to move a vehicle in that lane out of the way, then swerved left across\ntwo lanes in front of Excell to turn onto the freeway on-ramp. Excell followed the\n\n                                         8\n\fCHP vehicle onto the freeway and pursued it southward as it wove through traffic,\nat speeds of 80 to 85 miles per hour, until he lost sight of it near the Lincoln\nAvenue exit.\n       Around 8:30 p.m. on July 13, 1996, Paul Wilcox, a CHP dispatcher,\nreceived an inquiry from Officer Burt concerning the status of a driver‘s license\nissued to Pao or Pho D. Nguyen, born May 12, 1972. The dispatcher advised that\nthe license in that name was currently suspended, whereupon Officer Burt\nrequested a tow truck to respond to the Chevron station at Nutwood and Placentia.\n       Evidence collected at the crime scene included seven 9-millimeter shell\ncasings, a live 9-millimeter round in the front seat of the BMW, a citation book\nwith a bloody shoe print on it; a ―CHP 180‖ vehicle property form; a paper bag\nfilled with counterfeit traveler‘s checks; a printer, printer cartridges, and bulk\nquantities of high-quality bond paper found in the BMW‘s trunk; a wallet\ncontaining defendant‘s identification; and a BMW car key. Fingerprints on the\nbag and on a piece of paper were identified as defendant‘s.\n       Evidence, similar to that at the preliminary hearing, was presented that\nOfficer Burt‘s vehicle was found abandoned near defendant‘s Lincoln Avenue\nresidence; that around 10:00 p.m. on July 13, 1996, a witness saw a young Asian\nmale hop over the bumper of a Honda as he ran from the area where the car was\nabandoned; and that a partial shoe print was lifted from the Honda‘s bumper.\n       When arrested in Texas, defendant was sitting on a couch. He identified\nwhite tennis shoes near the couch as his. These shoes were turned over to the\nFullerton Police Department. The patterns of the soles were consistent with the\nbloody shoe print on Officer Burt‘s citation book, and were a positive match with\nthe shoe print on the Honda bumper. Testing of blood on the shoes revealed DNA\nmarkers identical to those in a tissue sample taken from Officer Burt. The chance\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fthat three particular markers common to both these samples would be found in\neach of two random individuals was one in six billion.\n       A United States Treasury Department agent testified that the 99 good-\nquality counterfeit traveler‘s checks found in the paper bag at the crime scene\nwere worth about $10,000. These checks belonged to a larger series of already-\npassed counterfeit checks that had caused losses of over $240,000. The quantity\nand quality of the checks in the bag, and the paraphernalia —such as the bond\npaper, printer, and printer cartridges — found in the BMW‘s trunk, indicated that\nsomeone was mass producing the counterfeit instruments, or selling them in bulk.\n       Officer Burt suffered 11 gunshot wounds inflicted by seven bullets. There\nwere no defensive wounds or signs of a struggle. He died of multiple gunshot\ninjuries to his brain, lungs, and visceral organs.\n\n           2. Victim impact.\n       Officer Burt‘s wife, mother, and father testified about the devastating effect\nof his death on his immediate and extended family. The victim, who was 25 years\nold when he died, had dreamed of being a CHP officer like his father. As a result\nof Officer Burt‘s death, his father, a CHP sergeant, retired approximately one year\nlater. Officer Burt‘s wife, described as his ―best friend,‖ was seven months\npregnant with their first child at the time of his death. Family members described\nthe victim as spontaneous, intelligent, sentimental, and fun-loving. The loss was\nespecially hard for his niece and two nephews, because their father had been killed\nin an auto accident about nine months earlier.\n\n           3. Other violent crimes.\n       The prosecution presented the following evidence of other crimes by\ndefendant involving violence or the threat of violence:\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f       Mark Baker lived in a second-story apartment next to the unit defendant\nshared with his girlfriend, Victoria Pham. In the early morning of September 11,\n1995, Baker heard scuffling in defendant‘s apartment. Baker went out onto the\ncommon balcony walkway, where defendant was struggling with Pham,\napparently trying to push her over the railing. Defendant hit Pham on the back of\nthe head or neck with his fist, and she fell to her knees. When Baker said,\n― ‗Knock it off, you motherfucker,‘ ‖ defendant went back into his apartment and\nreturned with a machine gun. Defendant loaded the gun in front of Baker, pulled\nback the bolt, and pointed the weapon at Baker‘s head. Defendant said, ― ‗I think\nyou called me a motherfucker‘ ‖ and ― ‗[l]et me hear you say it again.‘ ‖ Baker\nasked if the gun was real, and defendant responded, ― ‗You want to find out?‘ ‖\nThe confrontation ended when the manager of the apartment complex yelled at\neveryone to go back inside their apartments. Defendant reentered his unit, and\nBaker went to make sure the manager called the police.\n       On the evening of June 17, 1996, Robert Bachand, a Honda automobile\nsalesman, accompanied defendant and another Asian man on a vehicle test drive.\nDuring the drive, defendant said ― ‗[l]et‘s do this‘ ‖ to his companion. Defendant\nthen pulled a nine-millimeter Ruger semi-automatic pistol on Bachand and\ndemanded his wallet and PIN number. Bachand gave up his wallet, which\ncontained his ATM card. He was handcuffed and forced to lie on the back seat.\nDefendant said he and his companion intended to take the car, and both men\nseemed upset when Bachand told them he didn‘t know whether it had Lojack (a\nmeans of tracking a stolen vehicle). At some point, defendant handed a cell phone\nto Bachand, and a voice on the phone told Bachand ― ‗not to fuck with my guys or\nthey will kill you.‘ ‖ Bachand gave his PIN number to the person on the phone.\nDefendant warned Bachand that ― ‗[y]ou don‘t know who you‘re messing with‘ ‖\nand ― ‗[w]e‘re Asian, Vietnamese Mafia.‘ ‖\n\n                                        11\n\f       The men took Bachand to a house in Garden Grove or Westminster, where\ndefendant‘s companion got out of the car, and another Asian man got in.\nDefendant handed this man the gun he had been wielding. During further travel,\nthe cell phone rang again. A voice on the phone demanded verification of the PIN\nnumber Bachand had previously provided, complaining that ― ‗they‘ ‖ were unable\nto get any money out of the account. Bachand explained this was because the\naccount had no money. After debating whether to kill Bachand or release him, the\nmen let him go. Later that evening, Bachand identified a crashed Honda as the\none in which he had been abducted.\n       On the morning of July 13, 1996, the day Officer Burt was killed, Aryan\nNeghat was driving westbound in the fast lane of the State Route 91 freeway.\nA white BMW came up behind him and began following too closely, so Neghat\nmoved to lane No. 2 to avoid contact with that vehicle. The BMW, traveling\naround 70 miles per hour, then pulled very close to another vehicle in the fast lane,\nslightly bumping it. The BMW driver reached down, transferred a gun from his\nright to his left hand, and waved the gun out the driver‘s window. The car in front\nquickly changed lanes, whereupon the BMW driver pulled in the gun and sped\nonward. That night, while watching news of Officer Burt‘s murder, Neghat\nrecognized the white BMW at the crime scene as similar to the one he had\nencountered. In July 1996, Neghat positively identified defendant from a photo\nlineup as the weapon-brandishing driver he had observed, though he was unable to\nmake a positive identification at the April 2000 penalty trial.\n\n           4. Prior felony convictions.\n       The prosecution presented evidence that defendant had suffered prior\nfelony convictions (1) in 1992, for escape while misdemeanor charges were\npending (§ 4532, subd. (a)); (2) in 1992, for possession of an assault weapon\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f(former § 12280, subd. (b); see now § 30605, subd. (a)) and possession of a\nfirearm in violation of an express probation condition (former § 12021,\nsubd. (d)(1); see now § 29815, subd. (a)); and (3) in 1993, for assault with a\ndeadly weapon (§ 245, subd. (a)(1)) and burglary of an inhabited dwelling\n(§§ 459, 460, subd. (a)).\n\n       C. Defense penalty case.\n       Defendant himself was the only defense witness. He testified in narrative\nform as follows: ―Thank you. [¶] Before I start, I would like to say that I did\nrequest for my lawyers not to say anything on my behalf, and I appreciate that.\n[¶] Jurors, I am not here to ask or beg for your sympathy or pity. Nor am I here to\nask or beg of you, the jurors, to spare my life. [¶] Personally I believe in an eye\nfor an eye. I believe in two eyes for every eye. If you were to take down one of\nmy fellows, I would do everything that is necessary to take down at least two of\nyours, just to be even. [¶] In this penalty phase trial, the prosecutor, Mr. Jacobs,\nis seeking the maximum penalty, which we all know is death. I personally feel\nthat the maximum penalty is properly suited for this occasion. I also feel that it is\nthe right thing for you, the jurors, to do. [¶] Being in my situation now I feel it is\nonly fair, there‘s a price to pay for everything in life, now that I am here it‘s time\nI pay that price. Because, after all this entire ordeal, it is just part of the game.\n[¶] That‘s all I have to say, your honor.‖ The prosecutor did not cross-examine\ndefendant, and the defense presented no other evidence. No rebuttal case was\noffered.\n                                    DISCUSSION\n\n       A. Counsel-related claims: conflict of interest; ineffective assistance.\n       Defendant asserts that, at both the guilt and penalty stages, his counsel\nlabored under a potential and actual conflict of interest, and that counsel‘s\n\n\n                                           13\n\fperformance was adversely affected by the conflict, in violation of his state and\nfederal constitutional rights to conflict-free representation. Defendant further\ninsists he did not validly enter a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of the\nconflict. In any event, defendant asserts, the record demonstrates that, in certain\nrespects, counsel provided him with constitutionally ineffective assistance. No\nbasis for reversal appears.\n\n           1. Factual background — conflict of interest claim.\n       The factual background of defendant‘s conflict of interest claim,\nunfortunately complex, is as follows: Defendant was represented at the 1996\npreliminary hearing by retained Attorney Dennis O‘Connell. In subsequent\nproceedings, O‘Connell and another lawyer, George Peters, were appointed to\nrepresent defendant. Daniel Watkins was an investigator originally hired by\nO‘Connell, and later retained by both counsel, to work on defendant‘s case.\n       On July 27, 1998, while defendant was the Orange County Jail awaiting\ntrial in this case, he, Victoria Pham, Watkins, and another ―gang member‖ were\narrested by federal authorities. Soon thereafter, an indictment was filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the Central District of California against\ndefendant, Pham, Huy Ngoc Ha, and Watkins. (United States v. Hung Thanh Mai,\net al.( C.D.Cal., No. SA CR 98-82 LHM) indictment filed Aug. 6, 1998.) Count 1\naccused the indicted persons of conspiring by mail and/or interstate travel to\ncommit murder for hire, in violation of title 18 United States Code section 1958.\nThe alleged murder target was Chang ―Alex‖ Nguyen, a principal prosecution\nwitness as to the state capital murder charges, whom defendant wanted killed\nbecause of his cooperation with law enforcement.4\n\n4      This is the same Chang Nguyen who testified against defendant at his\npreliminary hearing in the instant case. The federal indictment explained that\n                                                          (Footnote continued on next page.)\n\n\n                                         14\n\f        Among other things, the federal indictment asserted that, in furtherance of\nthe conspiracy, Watkins ―traveled to Houston, Texas to locate Nguyen and his\nfamily, and that Watkins ―provided . . . [defendant] and PHAM with information\nabout . . . Nguyen so that Nguyen could be located and killed.‖ The federal\nindictment also alleged that after the authorities provided defendant with fake\nevidence the murder had been carried out, defendant asked Watkins to see if a\nmissing persons report had been filed in Houston for Nguyen, but Watkins warned\nthat any such check might arouse law enforcement suspicions. According to the\nfederal indictment, these events took place in March, April, and May of 1998.\n        On July 31, 1998, before the federal indictment was filed, and in\nanticipation of an upcoming federal bail and counsel hearing for Watkins,\nAttorney James Waltz, who would become Watkins‘s appointed federal counsel,\nfaxed a memorandum to the federal prosecutor‘s office (the Waltz memo). The\nWaltz memo claimed the federal case against Watkins was ―phony,‖ and asserted\nthat Waltz intended to call Peters and O‘Connell, defendant‘s counsel in this case,\nas ―cornerstone‖ witnesses in Watkins‘s defense. According to the Waltz memo,\nWatkins, while acting as Peters‘s investigator, and on Peters‘ behalf, ―interacted\nwith [defendant]. [Defendant] told [Watkins] about [defendant‘s] plan to kill\n[Nguyen] in Texas, and [Watkins] reported all that to . . . Peters, [O‘Connell,] and\nRob Harley, and took their directions.‖ The memo also suggested Peters and\nO‘Connell ―should be disqualified from further representing [defendant] in state\ncourt, as their testimony in Federal court will be adverse to [defendant] . . . as they\n\n\n(Footnote continued from previous page.)\n\ndefendant, then housed in the Orange County Jail, ―hired a person he believed was\nwilling to murder Nguyen in exchange for money. However, the person\n[defendant] hired to commit the murder was an undercover officer . . . .‖\n\n\n\n                                           15\n\fall exculpate [Watkins] from any wrongdoing.‖ The memo claimed that ―all\n[Watkins‘s] activities were blessed by Peters, Harley and [O‘Connell]. Just ask\nthem. [Watkins] did nothing to aid [defendant‘s] plan which was well known\namong his defense team.‖\n       On August 7, 1998, the day after the federal indictment was filed,\nprosecution and defense counsel in this case addressed the trial court about the\nimplications of the federal matter. Peters confirmed that besides defendant, ―this\ninvolves a defense investigator who is also charged in the federal case,‖ and it was\ntherefore ―possible that myself and Mr. O‘Connell could be witnesses in that case,\ncalled by the other defendant.‖ Peters indicated that he and O‘Connell did not\n―see any actual conflicts at this point.‖ However, in an abundance of caution,\ndefense counsel requested the appointment of an outside attorney to advise\ndefendant about possible conflicts. The prosecutor joined in the request.\nUltimately, upon agreement by all counsel, the court appointed Attorney Gary\nPohlson to review applicable materials and render an opinion on the conflict issue.\n       On August 21, 1998, Pohlson reported his activities and conclusions in\nopen court, with defendant and all counsel present. Pohlson acknowledged that\nPeters and O‘Connell would likely be called as witnesses in the federal case, and\nthat a potential conflict arises whenever counsel are required to testify in a matter\ninvolving a client. However, Pohlson indicated that after reviewing materials\nrelated to the federal case, including the Waltz memo, and speaking with\nO‘Connell, Peters, and the federal prosecutor, he foresaw no possibility that\nanything Peters or O‘Connell would say in their federal testimony would be\nharmful to defendant in either the federal or the state case.\n       Pohlson further stated he had explained to defendant (1) the dangers of\nconflicted counsel, (2) that upon proper advisement defendant could waive any\nconflict that did exist, and (3) that if the conflict was validly waived, defendant\n\n                                          16\n\fcould not rely on it later as a basis for attacking the state judgment. According to\nPohlson, defendant indicated he did not believe a conflict existed and confirmed\nthat he wished to retain Peters and O‘Connell as his state counsel.\n       The prosecutor, Orange County Deputy District Attorney Evans, agreed he\ncould foresee no actual conflict. In particular, the prosecutor represented that he\nwas largely ignorant of information gathered in the federal investigation, and that,\nin the instant proceeding, ―I don‘t intend to, and I will not use anything that was\ngathered in terms of information or evidence, and we will not derive anything\nfrom what was gathered, we won‘t use it even in a derivative sense.‖5 Peters and\nO‘Connell confirmed their views that there was no actual conflict, based on what\nthey currently knew about the federal and state cases. Peters iterated that if he did\ntestify in the federal case, ―I believe I would have nothing to say that would harm\n[defendant].‖\n       The court then engaged defendant in an extended colloquy on the conflict\nissue. The court preliminarily confirmed that defendant wished to waive any\nconflict of interest and retain Peters and O‘Connell as his counsel. The court\n\n\n5       This assertion stands in slight tension with the representations made in a\nMarch 2, 2000, federal court hearing addressing whether there should be some\nrelaxation of defendant‘s stringent confinement conditions in the Los Angeles\nfederal detention center while he prepared for his penalty trial in this case. Present\nat the hearing, among others, were defendant‘s state trial counsel, Peters, and\nOrange County Assistant District Attorney Jacobs, who had taken over the state\nprosecution from Evans. Among the issues was whether defendant should be\nallowed to review, in his cell, some 7,000 pages of discovery from the federal\ncase. Discussing the relevance of these materials to defendant‘s penalty defense,\nboth Peters and Jacobs indicated that, while the prosecution was bound to not\nintroduce evidence from the federal investigation in its case-in-chief, some such\nevidence could come in on cross-examination, or as rebuttal to any mitigating\nevidence defendant might present. Ultimately, no evidence from the federal case\nwas presented at defendant‘s penalty trial.\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\frecited that, based on the information presented, ―there [was] an appearance of a\npotential conflict,‖ that it appeared there was no actual conflict, that the court\ncould not finally determine whether an actual conflict existed, but that, if it did,\nsuch a conflict would likely ―not render the representation of defense counsel\nineffective in and of itself.‖\n       The court advised defendant that ―[b]ecause of that appearance of conflict,\nor potential conflict, or conflict,‖ his lawyers might not be able to furnish effective\nrepresentation, and he might not have a fair trial if represented by these counsel.\nFurther, the court admonished defendant that, ―should you have ineffective\ncounsel, your chances of being convicted are greater, and when you waive your\nright to conflict free counsel, you are also waiving an appeal based on that\nconflict.‖ Defendant confirmed that he understood. Defendant also agreed he had\nspoken with Pohlson, who had given him the same advisements.\n       The court then asked defendant whether ―[h]aving been advised of your\nright to be represented by attorneys free of conflict, and having understood the\ndisadvantage and dangers of being represented by attorneys with conflicts, do you\nspecifically give up the right to be represented by attorneys who have no conflict\nof interest?‖ Defendant responded, ―Yes.‖ Defendant agreed that no threats or\npromises had been made to secure the waiver, and the court confirmed that all\ncounsel concurred in defendant‘s decision. Finally, the court adopted, and\nobtained defendant‘s understanding of, the prosecutor‘s further statement that\ndefendant could withdraw his waiver at any future time if he discerned that a\nconflict of interest was adversely affecting the quality of his counsel‘s\nrepresentation.\n       At a progress hearing in state court in December 1998, Attorney Peters\nreported that he was involved in ongoing negotiations with the United States\nAttorney‘s Office on defendant‘s behalf with respect to the federal indictment.\n\n                                          18\n\fPeters reported that a term under discussion in those negotiations was that\ndefendant would agree to plead guilty in the instant case. Peters explained that,\nimmediately upon the filing of the federal indictment, he had visited defendant,\nwho made an ―impassioned plea‖ that he ―felt extremely responsible‖ for drawing\nPham into the plot to murder Nguyen, and ―wanted to do anything he could to\nrectify the situation, particularly with her.‖ Peters reported that defendant ―gave\nme specific directions. And since that time I have been working on those\ndirections, because I believe it is the right thing to do.‖\n       On March 9, 1999, defendant pled guilty in federal court to all counts of the\nfederal indictment, pursuant to an agreement previously reached with the federal\nprosecutor.6 The agreement included defendant‘s promise that he would also\nplead guilty in the instant proceeding to the murder of Officer Burt, and would\nadmit the special circumstance allegation that he intentionally killed a peace\nofficer engaged in the performance of duty, subject to a trial to determine the\nappropriate penalty. It also provided for the continued imposition of very severe\nconfinement conditions for the duration of defendant‘s federal incarceration, and\nincluded defendant‘s waiver of the right to serve his entire federal term before any\nstate death sentence was carried out.\n\n\n6       These counts included not only the murder conspiracy charge (Count One),\nbut charges of the substantive offense of using the mail or interstate travel with the\nintent that murder for hire be committed (Count Two; 18 U.S.C. § 1958), and a\ncharge that defendant aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, and\nprocured the commission by his federal codefendant, Ha, of the offense of\nknowingly and unlawfully possessing a machine gun (Count Three; 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 2(a), 922(o)(1)). The stipulated facts supporting Count Three were that in\nJanuary 1998, defendant arranged for the sale of a MAC-11 machine gun and\nsilencer, which were delivered to the undercover officer by Ha. The stipulation\nrecites that two days later, the weapon malfunctioned during a test firing, causing\na fatal head wound to the range officer.\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f       As consideration for defendant‘s plea, the federal prosecutor promised to\nrecommend, with respect to defendant, certain sentencing guideline reductions,\nprovided defendant met specified conditions. The federal prosecutor also\npromised to give ―due consideration to the mitigating role‖ that Pham played in\nthe Nguyen murder conspiracy, ―and accordingly to recommend a sentence for\nPham based on that lesser role,‖ under the federal sentencing guidelines.\n       Attached to the federal agreement was a recitation of the factual basis of the\nplea. The parties stipulated that the facts set forth in the recitation could be proved\nbeyond reasonable doubt in a trial. The redacted version of the recitation included\nin the instant record stated, among other things, that ―codefendant #4‖ (clearly\nWatkins) gave defendant a photo of intended murder victim Nguyen, which photo\n―codefendant #4‖ had obtained from discovery materials provided by the state\nprosecutor in this case. The recitation further stated that ―codefendant #4‖ warned\ndefendant against attempting to confirm Nguyen‘s death by checking for a missing\npersons report, and instead offered to make some ―inquiries‖ by pay phone when\nhe was in Houston. No portion of the factual recitation suggested that Peters or\nO‘Connell had any role in ―codefendant #4‘s‖ activities, or in those of any other\ndefendant in the federal case.\n       In June 1999, Watkins pled guilty, pursuant to agreement, to a reduced\nfederal charge of accessory after the fact to the offense of using the mail with\nintent that a murder for hire be committed (18 U.S.C. § 3). The agreement recited\nthat, knowing defendant had committed the underlying substantive offense,\nWatkins ―assisted [defendant] with the intent to hinder or prevent [defendant‘s]\napprehension, trial, and punishment‖ for that crime. Nothing in this recitation\nimplicated Peters or O‘Connell.\n       On July 23, 1999, in the instant case, the court addressed the defendant‘s\nrequest to waive his trial rights with respect to guilt and special circumstance\n\n                                          20\n\ffindings, and to stipulate that the trial court could determine those issues on the\nbasis of the preliminary hearing transcript. At the plea hearing, the court took\nparticular note of the condition in defendant‘s federal plea agreement that he plead\nguilty in the instant case. Accordingly, the court sought to assure itself that his\nwaivers of trial rights were truly knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and not the\nresult of duress, coercion, threats, or promises.\n       Attorney Peters explained that defendant‘s motive for entering the federal\nplea agreement, though it provided him virtually no personal benefit, was to\nobtain, at any sacrifice to himself, any advantage he could secure for Pham. On\nthe other hand, Peters represented, and the state and federal prosecutors — both of\nwhom were present — agreed, that defendant was under no practical obligation,\nby virtue of the federal plea agreement, to enter a ―slow plea‖ in the state case.\nAll federal sentencing jurisdiction over defendant and Pham had ended, and all\nterms of the agreement requiring the federal prosecutor to make recommendations\nconcerning Pham‘s prison placement had been satisfied. Neither the state nor the\nfederal prosecutor sought to hold defendant to the federal agreement‘s requirement\nthat he plead guilty to Officer Burt‘s murder.\n       Rather, Peters, citing his experience as a capital trial lawyer, indicated that\n―I made an analysis and . . . based on the quality of evidence against [defendant]\nand the nature of some of that evidence, . . . I have always realized that if we had\nanything to say and wanted credibility, we have to do it at the penalty phase.\nThat‘s why I am willing to do this.‖ As Peters explained, the prosecutor ―is going\nto put this evidence on anyways [at the penalty phase], some of it, and hopefully it\nwill be lesser than he would have otherwise. And I need, if I am going to have any\nhope of looking jurors in the eye and making the pitches I want to make, that\nI have to have the highest degree of credibility with them, and I can have that\ncredibility by pointing out that [defendant] has done the right thing [by not\n\n                                          21\n\finsisting on a guilt trial].‖ Indeed, Peters made clear, defendant ―is not begging\nfor anything,‖ and ―may not even want to . . . present[ ] evidence in the penalty\nphase, he hasn‘t made that decision yet, and that‘s up to him.‖\n       In response to a request from the prosecutor that the record be made clear,\nPeters obtained defendant‘s confirmation that he had explained to defendant the\n―tactical and strategic reasons‖ for submitting the guilt and special circumstance\nissues, that defendant did not disagree with this advice, that defendant could do\nnothing more to help or hurt Pham, and that he was not required to waive his trial\nrights. The court accepted the stipulation.\n       However, the court revisited the issue on July 30, 1999. Counsel reported\ndefendant was disturbed by newspaper articles that apparently cited the tactical\nreasons counsel had given the previous week for agreeing to the ―slow plea‖\nprocedure — i.e., doing the ―right thing‖ in order to preserve credibility at a\npenalty trial — as defendant‘s personal reasons for stipulating to submission on\nthe preliminary hearing transcript. Allowed to make a statement on his own\nbehalf, defendant said he was ―not doing this so-called plea‖ in hopes of ―sav[ing]\nface or retain[ing] credibility for future jurors,‖ and was not ―asking for mercy or\npity or sympathy from future jurors,‖ but was acting for ―my own personal\nreasons.‖ Defendant indicated that ―[w]hatever reasons my lawyers might have,\nstrategic or other, they have discussed that with me,‖ and he assumed counsel\nwere ―obligated to follow through with that,‖ but as far as he was concerned,\n―[w]hatever results emerge from my penalty phase and my sentencing, so be it.‖\n       Defendant declined to indicate what his ―personal reasons‖ were, but he\ninsisted they did not include the hope of gaining anything for himself or for\nVictoria Pham. He again confirmed he was acting freely and voluntarily. The\ncourt thereupon indicated it was satisfied that defendant‘s waiver of a guilt and\nspecial circumstance trial was appropriate.\n\n                                         22\n\f       On the basis of this factual record, defendant now claims his trial counsel\nfaced a potential conflict of interest arising from concerns about their personal\ninvolvement in the Nguyen murder conspiracy case, and in the conspiracy itself.\nThis potential conflict, defendant insists, ripened into an actual one because, as a\nmatter of fact, it adversely affected counsel‘s performance in the instant case,\ninfluencing them to refrain from providing a competent and vigorous defense at all\nphases of the state capital trial. Moreover, defendant maintains, his purported\nwaiver of any conflict was invalid, because the record indicates he was not\nsufficiently apprised of the pressures that might bear on counsel‘s ability to give\nhim zealous and undivided loyalty. He further asserts that aspects of his counsel‘s\nperformance were professionally deficient regardless of any conflict. As we will\nexplain, we find no merit in these contentions.\n\n           2. Applicable law.\n       A criminal defendant‘s federal and state constitutional rights to counsel\n(U.S. Const., 6th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, § 15) includes the right to effective\nlegal assistance. When challenging a conviction on grounds of ineffective\nassistance, the defendant must demonstrate counsel‘s inadequacy. To satisfy this\nburden, the defendant must first show counsel‘s performance was deficient, in that\nit fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional\nnorms. Second, the defendant must show resulting prejudice, i.e., a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel‘s deficient performance, the outcome of the\nproceeding would have been different. When examining an ineffective assistance\nclaim, a reviewing court defers to counsel‘s reasonable tactical decisions, and\nthere is a presumption counsel acted within the wide range of reasonable\nprofessional assistance. It is particularly difficult to prevail on an appellate claim\nof ineffective assistance. On direct appeal, a conviction will be reversed for\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fineffective assistance only if (1) the record affirmatively discloses counsel had no\nrational tactical purpose for the challenged act or omission, (2) counsel was asked\nfor a reason and failed to provide one, or (3) there simply could be no satisfactory\nexplanation. All other claims of ineffective assistance are more appropriately\nresolved in a habeas corpus proceeding. (E.g., People v. Vines (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844288\"><a href=\"/opinion/844288/people-v-vines/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">830</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 875-876 (Vines); People v.

(E.g., Glasser v. United States (1942) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 69-70;\nPeople v.

For both state and federal\npurposes, a claim of conflicted representation is one variety of claim that counsel\nprovided ineffective assistance. Hence, to obtain reversal of a criminal verdict, the\ndefendant must demonstrate that (1) counsel labored under an actual conflict of\ninterest that adversely affected counsel‘s performance, and (2) absent counsel‘s\ndeficiencies arising from the conflict, it is reasonably probable the result of the\nproceeding would have been different. (Mickens v. Taylor (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118492\"><a href=\"/opinion/118492/mickens-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n166 (Mickens); Doolin, supra, at pp. 417-418, 421; see Strickland v.

We must therefore examine the record to\ndetermine (i) whether arguments or actions omitted would likely have been made\nby counsel who did not have a conflict of interest, and (ii) whether there may have\nbeen a tactical reason (other than the asserted conflict of interest) that might have\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\fcaused any such omission.‘ (People v.

But the court must take steps to ensure that any waiver of a\npossible conflict meets those standards. If, after inquiry, the court determines that\na waiver is necessary, it must satisfy itself that the defendant (1) has discussed\nwith his or her own counsel, or with an outside attorney if he or she wishes, the\npotential drawbacks of representation by counsel who may have a conflict of\ninterest; (2) has been advised of the dangers of conflicted representation in his\ncase; and (3) voluntarily wishes to waive that right. Where the court fails to fulfill\nthese duties, reversal is required if the defendant can establish that counsel‘s\nperformance was deficient, that an actual conflict of interest was the reason for the\ndeficiency, and that it is reasonably probable the deficiency adversely affected the\noutcome of the case.

Sanchez (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1127405\"><a href=\"/opinion/1127405/people-v-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (Sanchez);\nPeople v.

Waiver of conflict of interest.\n       The People urge at the outset that defendant validly waived any conflict of\ninterest arising from his counsel‘s connection to the federal case. We agree.\n       Here, the court perceived a possible conflict of interest and, as the cases\nrequire, it addressed the issue with considerable care. The court appointed\nindependent counsel to investigate and advise defendant on the subject, and\nconfirmed that independent counsel had done so. Before taking defendant‘s\nwaiver, the court warned him of the essential danger of conflicted representation,\ni.e., that the conflict might induce counsel to ―pull their punches‖ when\nrepresenting him in the instant case. It was further agreed on the record that\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\fdefendant could withdraw the waiver at any time if a conflict actually materialized\nand he perceived it was affecting his counsel‘s performance. Hence, it appears\ndefendant was generally apprised of the considerations that should influence his\nwaiver decision.\n       Nonetheless, defendant complains that because the court‘s inquiry into the\nconflict, and the advisements he received, were inadequate, his purported waiver\nwas not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. He asserts that, while he was warned\nabout the chance his counsel might be witnesses in the federal matter, and was\nassured they would say nothing to inculpate him, he was never informed of the\nWaltz memo‘s insinuations that counsel themselves had committed serious ethical\nand criminal violations by ―direct[ing]‖ and ―bless[ing]‖ Watkins‘s involvement in\nthe Nguyen murder plot. Defendant insists he should have been told that counsel‘s\nexposure to personal criminal liability might motivate them to ―pull their punches‖\nwhen representing him, in order to curry favor with both federal and state\nprosecutors in hopes of avoiding the consequences of their own derelictions.\nIndeed, defendant posits, by accepting assurances that there appeared no chance\nhis counsel would testify unfavorably to him in the federal matter, he may\nmistakenly have believed that there was no potential conflict, and that he could\ntherefore safely enter his waiver.\n       However, as we have consistently said, waiver of a possible attorney\nconflict of interest is not invalid simply because all conceivable ramifications of\nthe potential conflict were not explored or explained, and the waiver does not\nextend only to those matters discussed on the record. (E.g., People v. Roldan\n(2005) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">646</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 728; People v.

Indeed, where no actual conflict has\nmaterialized at the time the waiver is taken, it may simply be impossible to foresee\nfuture developments that could have a genuine effect on counsel‘s loyalty and\n\n                                         26\n\fzeal; on the other hand, sources of conflict that are merely speculative and\nconjectural need not be addressed.\n       That is the situation presented here. The sole basis in the record for the\nproposition that defendant should have been warned about his counsel‘s possible\ndirect criminal involvement in the Nguyen murder conspiracy is the Waltz memo,\nwhich Independent Counsel Pohlson reviewed. But that document is an\nexceedingly weak foundation upon which to build such a theory.\n       Defendant characterizes the Waltz memo as containing ―allegations‖ by\nWatkins himself that his criminal assistance to defendant in the Nguyen murder\nplot was ―directed‖ and ―blessed‖ by defendant‘s attorneys, Peters and O‘Connell.\nOn the contrary, Waltz‘s off-the-cuff assertions, apparently made prior to his\nactual appointment as Watkins‘s federal lawyer, did not amount to direct\n―allegations‖ by Watkins. At most, they appear to have been a lawyer‘s clumsy,\ninformal, and preliminary attempts to advocate on a potential client‘s behalf, and\nperhaps to apply some kind of tactical leverage against Peters and O‘Connell as\npotential witnesses in Watkins‘s case. Pohlson could reasonably conclude they\nexhibited no indicia of credibility sufficient to invoke a genuine concern about\ncounsel‘s criminal involvement in the acts charged against Watkins by the federal\nindictment.\n       Moreover, by its terms, the ambiguously worded Waltz memo did not\nexplicitly claim Peters and O‘Connell knew of, directed, or blessed any criminal\nactivity by Watkins. While the memo declared that Watkins ―interacted‖ with\ndefendant, that defendant told Watkins of his plan to kill Nguyen, and that\nWatkins ―reported all that‖ to defendant‘s counsel, the memo also insisted that the\nfederal charges against Watkins were ―phony‖ and ―trumped up,‖ that Watkins\n―did nothing to aid [defendant‘s] plan,‖ and that any testimony by Peters and\nO‘Connell in Watkins‘s federal case would ―exculpate [Watkins] from any\n\n                                         27\n\fwrongdoing.‖ It is reasonable to assume Waltz believed Peters and O‘Connell\nwould say, truthfully, that Watkins did nothing illegal on their orders, and that any\nactivities of Watkins they ―direct[ed]‖ or ―blessed‖ were legitimate.\n       Finally, it was entirely reasonable, upon review of the Waltz memo, to\nconclude at the time the waiver was entered that the principal source of potential\nconflict it revealed was the possibility counsel would be called as witnesses in\nWatkins‘s defense. Indeed, the only reason the Waltz memo expressed for its\nclaim that Peters and O‘Connell should be disqualified from representing\ndefendant in this case was that ―their testimony in Federal court [would] be\nadverse to [defendant]‖ insofar as it exculpated Watkins.\n       Under these circumstances, neither Independent Counsel Pohlson nor the\ncourt was reasonably obliged to speculate further about what conflicts might arise\nas a result of the federal investigation into defendant‘s murder plot and the\nresulting indictment. There was no requirement to advise defendant that, aside\nfrom the chance Peters and O‘Connell might be called as witnesses on Watkins‘s\nbehalf, another source of conflict might be their own potential criminal liability for\nhis activities. Accordingly, defendant‘s waiver of a potential conflict of interest\nwas valid when given.\n\n                4. Claims of ineffective and conflict-related adverse\n                   representation.\n       In any event, defendant‘s complaints against his counsel fail on the merits.\nHe is unable to show on the appellate record that any potential conflict of interest\nactually materialized. Further, the record fails to demonstrate that any conflict of\ninterest resulted in adverse performance by his counsel, or that counsel otherwise\nrendered ineffective assistance.\n       At the outset, there is no evidence on the record that Defense Counsel\nPeters and O‘Connell were called as witnesses in the federal case, or ever became\n\n\n                                         28\n\fthe focus of any state or federal investigation into their own criminal involvement\nin the activities of their investigator, Watkins. Indeed, the record belies any such\ndevelopments. As noted above, Watkins never went to trial in the federal case\nagainst him; in June 1999, he entered a negotiated plea to a reduced charge of\naccessory after the fact in the conspiracy to murder Chang Nguyen. The brief\nfactual recitation included in the plea agreement made no reference to Peters or\nO‘Connell. Similarly, in March 1999, defendant himself entered a negotiated plea\nto the federal charges against him. His plea agreement attached an extensive\nfactual recitation of his central role in the murder plot, but again, it included no\nmention of any involvement by Peters and O‘Connell.\n       These events occurred before July 23, 1999, when defendant entered his\n―slow plea‖ to the capital charges in this case. By this time, therefore, it appears\ncounsel was not burdened by any actual, or even potential, conflict arising from\nthe chance they would be called as witnesses in the federal proceedings against\nWatkins or defendant.\n       But even if we assume a potential conflict remained because of the\npossibility Peters and O‘Connell might still be criminally charged in the Nguyen\nmurder plot, the record discloses no adverse or ineffective performance by his\ncounsel. Defendant cites several actions or omissions by counsel that he deems\nadverse, deficient, and conflict related, but the record does not support his claims.\n\n                a. Federal plea agreement; “slow plea” strategy.\n       First, defendant urges the potential conflict caused counsel to engineer his\nonerous plea agreement in the federal case, by which he additionally, and\nprejudicially, bound himself to plead guilty to the murder charge and peace officer\nspecial circumstance allegation in this case. But the record suggests otherwise.\nWithout objection by defendant, Peters explained in state court that the reason\n\n\n\n                                          29\n\fdefendant acceded to the federal terms was to obtain, at any sacrifice, whatever\nbenefit he could for his girlfriend and federal codefendant, Victoria Pham. The\ngovernment agreed, in return for defendant‘s federal plea, to make certain leniency\nrecommendations for Pham, and it honored its promise.\n       In any event, defendant fails to demonstrate from the record that the\nagreement resulted in his ―slow plea‖ here. Again, the evidence is to the contrary.\nBefore allowing defendant to submit the guilt and special circumstance issues on\nthe preliminary hearing transcript, the instant trial court took particular note of the\n―plead guilty‖ term of the federal agreement and inquired about its significance.\nThe federal and state prosecutors stressed they did not deem defendant bound by\nhis federal promise, and they conceded there was nothing the government could do\nby that time if he breached it. Peters explained the ―slow plea‖ was not influenced\nby the federal agreement, but was a tactical and strategic decision, based on the\npremise that the evidence against defendant was overwhelming, that there was\nlittle if any chance a jury would exonerate defendant of capital charges, and that a\npenalty jury might be better disposed toward defendant if the jurors knew he had\n―done the right thing‖ by waiving a trial on the issue of guilt.\n       The record confirms the strength of the evidence that defendant murdered a\npolice officer during a routine traffic stop in order to escape arrest for a third strike\noffense. Counsel also presumably knew a penalty trial would likely reveal\ndefendant as a violent sociopath with a significant, gang-affiliated criminal\nbackground, even without the evidence that he orchestrated, from behind bars, a\nplot to kill a principal prosecution witness in this case. Counsel thus faced a\nparticularly difficult task in defending the case at both the guilt and penalty\nphases.\n       Under these circumstances, where realistic lines of defense were few, it was\ntactically and strategically reasonable to acquiesce in a ―slow plea‖ on the guilt\n\n                                           30\n\fand special circumstance issues, in hopes of preserving some credibility and\nsympathy before a penalty jury. The record does not show that a different strategy\nwould likely have been adopted by competent, unconflicted counsel. Hence, it\nfails to demonstrate either conflict-driven adverse performance, or ineffective\nassistance, on counsel‘s part. (See Doolin, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 424.)\n       Defendant insists counsel‘s ―slow plea‖ strategy was adverse and\nincompetent insofar as defendant failed to receive a return benefit and, in\nparticular, a prosecutorial promise not to seek the death penalty. But the record\ncontains no inkling that counsel could reasonably have expected such benefits.\nCommon sense suggests the prosecution would not likely have offered favorable\nterms in a case presenting overwhelming evidence that defendant murdered a\npeace officer in cold blood to avoid arrest and prosecution for other crimes.\nAgain, the record affords no ground to conclude that counsel‘s failure to seek such\nbenefits constituted adverse performance stemming from a conflict of interest, or\nwas otherwise professionally deficient.7\n       Defendant also contends his counsel‘s agreement to a ―slow plea‖ was\nadverse and incompetent insofar as it deprived him of a ―compelling‖ trial\nargument against the sole special circumstance allegation, that he murdered a\npeace officer ―engaged in the performance of . . . duties.‖ (§ 190.2(a)(7).) This\n\n\n7      Defendant suggests counsel might have offered defendant‘s cooperation in\nproviding information about the conspiracy to murder Nguyen in return for a\npromise of leniency. However, it seems particularly unlikely state prosecutors\nwould have given up their right to seek death for defendant‘s actual murder of a\nCHP officer in return for defendant‘s help to federal prosecutors in a case\ninvolving a mere unsuccessful plot to kill a witness in the state case. Hence, so far\nas appears from the record, defendant‘s counsel had reasonable grounds not to\npursue this avenue, and there is no basis to believe competent, unconflicted\ncounsel would likely have acted differently.\n\n\n\n                                           31\n\fclaim is premised on the rule that murder of a peace officer ―engaged in . . .\nduties‖ is only committed when the officer was exercising his or her authority\nlawfully at the time the lethal act occurred.

Defendant asserts a\njury could have found the prosecution had been unable to prove beyond reasonable\ndoubt that Officer Burt ―lawfully‖ stopped and detained him on July 13, 1996.\n       The pertinent circumstances are as follows: Defendant‘s murder of Officer\nBurt prevented the victim from explaining why the stop occurred. At the\npreliminary hearing, prosecution witness Nguyen testified defendant told him the\nofficer stopped him because his lights were not on, although defendant thought\nthey were on. As in effect in 1996, the traffic laws required vehicles to turn on\ntheir lights from one-half hour after sunset until one-half hour before sunrise, or in\nother poor visibility conditions. (Veh. Code, §§ 280, 24400, 38335.) The stop\noccurred in the early evening of July 13, 1996 — sometime after 8:00 p.m. — but\nthe record does not disclose the exact time of sunset in Fullerton on that\nmidsummer day, and eyewitness Bernice Sarthou testified the sun had not yet set\nwhen the stop occurred.8 Thus, defendant urges, he might have persuaded a jury\n\n\n\n8      Sarthou also testified, however, that she observed the traffic stop about 8:30\np.m., when she pulled into the driveway of an adjacent restaurant. Moreover, by\n                                                          (Footnote continued on next page.)\n\n\n                                          32\n\fthere was reasonable doubt whether the prosecution had established the\nlawfulness, ab initio, of the traffic stop that eventually led to Officer Burt‘s\nmurder.\n        However, even though the peace officer special circumstance was crucial to\ndefendant‘s eligibility for the death penalty, counsel were not compelled to pursue\nan ―illegal stop‖ strategy regardless of its chances of success. It is noteworthy that\nafter reviewing the preliminary hearing transcript, the learned trial court, acting as\na fact finder, implicitly found all elements of the special circumstance, including\nthe ―lawful duty‖ element, proven beyond reasonable doubt. Elsewhere in this\nopinion, we uphold this implicit finding; we consider on the merits, and reject,\ndefendant‘s claim that there was insufficient evidence from which a rational fact\nfinder could find beyond reasonable doubt that Officer Burt was lawfully\nperforming his duties when he was killed.\n        Thus, experienced trial counsel could rationally conclude, for several\nreasons, that the overall risks of trying the special circumstance issue outweighed\nthe benefits. In the first place, counsel knew that in any jury trial, the jury would\nbe exposed to persuasive evidence defendant had gunned down Officer Burt\nduring a routine traffic stop in order to avoid arrest and conviction for a third\nstrike offense. Under these circumstances, counsel could harbor a reasonable\nconcern that lay jurors would find an ―illegal stop‖ argument hypertechnical and\ncynical, would reject it out of hand, and would carry residual hostility over to their\npenalty deliberations — the very kind of danger counsel sought to prevent.\n\n\n(Footnote continued from previous page.)\n\nan order entered June 27, 2013, we have taken judicial notice that sunset occurred\nin Fullerton on July 13, 1996, at 8:04 p.m., approximately one-half hour earlier.\n\n\n\n\n                                           33\n\f       Moreover, counsel had grounds for concern that the evidence at such a trial\n— and, in particular, evidence on the issue of ―lawful duty‖ — would not\nnecessarily be limited to that adduced at the preliminary hearing. The prosecution,\nmindful of its trial duty to prove every guilt and special circumstance element\nbeyond reasonable doubt (as opposed to its preliminary hearing duty merely to\nshow sufficient evidence to warrant a trial), could be expected to enhance its\neffort to establish that Officer Burt was acting lawfully when he was killed. By\nsubmitting the special circumstance issue on the preliminary hearing transcript,\ndefendant avoided such additional proof, forced the trial court to decide whether\nthe preliminary hearing evidence alone persuaded it that ―lawful duty‖ had been\nestablished beyond reasonable doubt, and, in the event the trial court so found,\npreserved his right to argue on appeal, as he does, that this evidence was not\nlegally sufficient.

But competent, unconflicted counsel could\nconclude otherwise. Aside from an assessment that such an argument was\nunlikely to succeed, counsel could fear it would cause the prosecution to seek the\nopportunity to adduce further evidence on this issue. Even if defendant was\nwilling to submit his cause on the evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing, the\nprosecution was not necessarily compelled to agree to such a procedure. Had the\nPeople been alerted to a claim that, in fact, their showing at the preliminary\nhearing failed to meet the reasonable-doubt standard on any guilt or special\ncircumstance element, no reason of fairness or logic suggests they were foreclosed\nfrom insisting on the right to present further evidence, whether before the court or\na jury, to bolster their case.

Failure to challenge aggravating evidence.\n        Defendant urges that his attorneys, burdened by a conflict of interest,\nperformed adversely to his interests at the penalty trial by failing to conduct more\nthan desultory cross-examination of prosecution witnesses, by making few\nobjections to evidence, by stipulating to various facts, and by failing to dispute the\n\n\n\n\n(Footnote continued from previous page.)\n\nguilty].) As noted in the text, the strategy chosen by counsel avoided this pitfall,\nkept open the possibility the trial court would find the preliminary hearing\nevidence unpersuasive, and, if the court failed to do so, preserved defendant‘s\nright to raise an insufficient-evidence claim on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\fprosecution‘s claim that defendant carjacked and kidnapped Robert Bachand\nduring a vehicle test drive.\n       However, we have made clear that ―[s]uch matters as whether objections\nshould be made and the manner of cross-examination are within counsel‘s\ndiscretion and rarely implicate ineffective assistance of counsel.‖ (People v.\nMcDermott (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 993; see People v.

Nor does such unsubstantiated speculation allow us to infer that\nunconflicted counsel would likely have acted differently.\n       In particular, defendant suggests counsel knew of grounds to challenge the\nBachand carjacking evidence and, if competent and unconflicted, would likely\nhave mounted such a challenge. As support for this contention, defendant points\nto his own courtroom outburst during the testimony of Bachand, an automobile\nsalesman. When Bachand recounted that two men, of whom defendant was the\ntaller, approached him with a request to test drive a 1996 Honda Prelude,\ndefendant interrupted to shout, ―This is fucking bullshit. What the fuck am I going\nto carjack a piece of shit Honda? [¶] If I were in the car I would have wasted your\nfucking ass, it would have been stupid.‖ When Bachand said to defendant, ―You\nhad your chance,‖ defendant asserted, ―You fucking ass, I will put something\non.‖10 Defendant also points to Attorney Peters‘s statement at the hearing on the\n\n\n10    A few moments later, Bachand said that after he was handcuffed at\ngunpoint and forced to lie down in the carjacked vehicle‘s back seat, defendant\nwarned him to cooperate in handing over his ATM card and PIN number because\n                                                         (Footnote continued on next page.)\n\n\n                                         36\n\fautomatic motion for modification of the death verdict that he had tried to\npersuade the prosecutor not to present the carjacking incident ―because I knew\nfrom my own investigation that [defendant] was not good for [i.e., did not do]\nthat.‖\n         But nothing in the record passages defendant cites is evidence that\nundermines the prosecution‘s proof of the carjacking incident. In response to\ncareful questioning by the prosecutor and the court, Bachand positively identified\ndefendant as the taller man who requested the test drive and later participated in\nabducting him at gunpoint. The record discloses no ground to conclude that any\nevidence to discredit this testimony existed, that defendant‘s counsel knew or\nshould have known of such evidence, or that counsel would likely have produced\nit if competent and unconflicted. Defendant‘s claim must be rejected.\n\n                        ii. Failure to pursue mitigating evidence.\n         Defendant next urges that, in one respect, the record indicates counsel\nfailed in their duty to investigate and present to the client potentially significant\nmitigating evidence before acceding to his wishes not to offer it in mitigation.\n(See, e.g., Douglas v. Woodford (9th Cir. 2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780580\"><a href=\"/opinion/780580/fred-berre-douglas-v-jeanne-s-woodford-warden-of-rswl-california-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1089-1090.)\nDefendant points to his counsel‘s representations that his girlfriend, Victoria\nPham, had said his behavior became more violent after a near-fatal auto accident;\nas a result, according to counsel, the defense psychologist, Dr. Veronica Thomas,\nrecommended neuropsychological tests, and perhaps an MRI or CAT scan, to\n\n\n(Footnote continued from previous page.)\n\n― ‗[y]ou don‘t know who you are messing with‘ ‖ and ― ‗we‘re Asian, Vietnamese\nMafia.‘ ‖ At this point, defendant interrupted again to say, ―Asian Mafia, stupid\nfuck.‖\n\n\n\n\n                                            37\n\fdetermine whether defendant had sustained brain damage. Defendant notes that\ncounsel‘s billing records fail to indicate that Dr. Thomas, or any other qualified\nmental health expert, ever conducted such tests, and we must thus assume they\nwere not performed.\n       But even if we so assume, the record discloses no basis to conclude\ncounsel‘s failure to pursue this line of inquiry, and to advise defendant of the\nresults before agreeing not to present them, was deficient performance influenced\nby their asserted conflict of interest. To the extent the record sheds any light at all\non the subject, it suggests a different explanation.\n       In mid-1999, over eight months before the actual commencement of the\npenalty trial, counsel represented that they intended to pursue testing for brain\ndamage, and were preparing to do so, as a priority matter, subject to approval of\nthe necessary funding. However, the record contains circumstantial evidence that\nthe defense team, including Dr. Thomas, thereafter became absorbed in an effort\nto deal with defendant‘s increasing anger and emotional instability caused, in part,\nby the restrictive conditions of his federal confinement. There are indications that\nthis anger and instability, resulting in defendant‘s lack of cooperation with Dr.\nThomas, may be the ultimate reason why such tests were never administered.\n       As discussed in greater detail in part A.4.c below, defendant, following his\nfederal conviction, was held in federal detention pending his trial on these state\ncapital charges. He was subject to the harsh confinement conditions dictated by\nhis federal plea agreement. His subsequent serious rule violations while confined\nled to even more severe restrictions imposed by the federal district court and his\nfederal jailors. In the months and weeks preceding his state trial, he was kept\nunder constant surveillance, and in essential isolation, except for access to the\ndefense team.\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\f       During this period, and through the commencement of the penalty trial,\ncounsel, assisted by Dr. Thomas, worked tirelessly to obtain a relaxation of these\nconditions, citing the psychological effects of defendant‘s confinement on defense\nefforts to prepare for the trial. To that end, counsel and Dr. Thomas represented in\nvarious fora that, though defendant was not incompetent, the emotional and\npsychological toll of his confinement was impairing his attitude and willingness to\ncooperate, to the extent that Dr. Thomas was ―unable to move forward‖ with her\nwork for the defense and could not complete that work.\n       Thus, though the record does not establish for certain the reason tests for\nbrain damage were never done, it does not support the inferences defendant seeks\nto draw. It fails to demonstrate that counsel‘s deficient performance, arising from\na conflict of interest, was the reason for any failure to administer the desired tests,\nor that such tests would likely have been administered but for counsel‘s conflict\nand incompetence.\n\n                    iii. Failure to present mitigating evidence and argument.\n       Next, defendant urges that counsel, influenced by their conflict of interest,\nperformed deficiently by acceding to his wish not to present available mitigating\npenalty evidence. Defendant concedes that counsel does not necessarily act\nincompetently by honoring the client‘s wishes not to present such evidence\n(People v.

Here, he asserts, his\ncounsel knew he was psychologically unstable, and sometimes irrational, as the\nresult, among other things, of his harsh confinement conditions.\n        Moreover, defendant asserts that counsel‘s decision deprived him of a\nsubstantial mitigating case, including evidence he was the illegitimate child of a\nVietnamese ―bar girl‖ and a South Vietnamese soldier, was rescued from war-torn\nVietnam at the age of four, and never again had contact with either parent until he\nsaw his father at the time of the capital trial.\n        Again, however, the record does not support defendant‘s theory that\ncounsel‘s decision, at defendant‘s own insistence, to present no mitigating penalty\nevidence stemmed from a conflict of interest.

Moreover, imposing such a duty could cause\nsome defendants who otherwise would not have done so to exercise their Sixth\nAmendment right of self-representation [citation] before commencement of the\nguilt phase [citations] in order to retain control over the presentation of evidence at\nthe penalty phase, resulting in a significant loss of legal protection for these\ndefendants during the guilt phase.‖ (Lang, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1147525\"><a href=\"/opinion/1147525/people-v-lang/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1030-1031.) No\ndifferent standards or considerations should apply simply because, on appeal, the\ndefendant applies a ―conflict of interest‖ gloss to counsel‘s decision. As Lang\nsuggested, counsel‘s accession to the client‘s considered desire to present no\nmitigating evidence demonstrates loyalty to the client, not conflict-related\ndisloyalty.\n\n\n\n\n                                           40\n\fwas acting irrationally in seeking to present no mitigating case. On the contrary,\nthe record is replete with indications that counsel pursued evidence about the\ncircumstances of defendant‘s birth and his escape from Vietnam, and were\nprepared to present that evidence. Indeed, counsel obtained trial delays, and\nsurmounted various bureaucratic, diplomatic, and logistical difficulties, in a\nsuccessful effort to bring defendant‘s father and uncle from rural Vietnam to\ntestify on his behalf.\n       On the other hand, there are indications that defendant consistently, and\nrationally, opposed the presentation of a penalty defense, despite counsel‘s efforts\nto change his mind. Ultimately, on April 17, 2000, after the prosecution had\nrested its penalty case, counsel advised the court there would ―probably‖ not be\nany defense evidence, but that counsel would be discussing that with defendant\n―over the next day and a half.‖ Counsel indicated that ―we do have evidence\navailable, and we could use it if there is a change in mood.‖ The court obtained\ndefendant‘s agreement that counsel had advised him they were ready, willing, and\nable to present such evidence, and had ―recommended to you that it be presented.‖\nDefendant also confirmed his understanding, as advised by the court, that his\ndecision not to offer such evidence might result in the death penalty, and that if he\nprecluded such evidence, he could not blame his lawyers or otherwise complain on\nappeal about its omission.\n       On April 19, 2000, Attorney Peters advised the court that, ―for some time‖\nhe had been discussing possible penalty defenses with defendant, ―and it has been\nhis consistent wish not to defend himself for what he believes are valid moral\nreasons, and I believe that he is competent and he is thinking morally for himself.‖\nPeters indicated that defendant had threatened to ―act out,‖ such as by interrupting\nor overturning tables, if counsel acted contrary to his desires. Peters declared that\nunder these circumstances, and especially considering that the available mitigation\n\n                                         41\n\fwas probably too weak to make a difference in the penalty determination, he was\nmaking a ―conscious decision‖ to do as defendant asked.\n       The court then engaged defendant in another extended colloquy about his\ndecisions not to present mitigating evidence or argument, and to testify personally.\nAt the court‘s prompting, defendant again indicated he understood that counsel\nhad mitigating evidence, were prepared to present it, and wanted to do so.\nDefendant confirmed he did not wish counsel to present such evidence. The court\nreminded defendant that, even if he offered no evidence, his lawyers, if allowed to\nspeak on his behalf, could possibly ―present different arguments to the jurors that\nmight be favorable to you. And precluding [counsel] from that is another step\ntowards the death penalty.‖ Defendant separately confirmed he wished to\npreclude counsel from arguing the case.\n       Explaining his position on these issues, defendant insisted he was ―not\nsuicidal,‖ but this was ―something I need to do,‖ something ―important‖ and\n―right‖ that seemed ―necessary.‖ Defendant said he was ―not looking at this [in] a\nway everyone else here is looking at it. I feel I am competent, I can do this, and\nI would appreciate my lawyer not to say anything.‖\n       Attorney Peters asked defendant whether, as Peters had told the court two\ndays earlier, defendant intended to ―act out‖ if counsel tried to present an\nargument. Defendant said he would do so, albeit reluctantly. On this basis, Peters\nagain indicated he was making a ―conscious decision‖ to proceed as defendant\nrequested. Peters declared he would rather have defendant ―say his [piece] to the\njury‖ than display disruptive behavior to the jurors if counsel tried to overrule him.\n       In his testimony to the jury, defendant further explained his attitudes. He\ntold the jurors he had asked his lawyers not to speak on his behalf, and he\n―appreciate[d]‖ their cooperation in that regard. He said that his personal code\ndemanded ―two eyes for every eye‖; that under such a code, the maximum penalty\n\n                                          42\n\fwas ―properly suited for this occasion‖ and was ―the right thing for [the jurors] to\ndo‖; that ―there‘s a price to pay for everything in life‖; and that, ―as part of the\ngame,‖ it was time he paid the price.\n       Thus, all record indications are that the omission of mitigating evidence\nwas the result of defendant‘s clear, consistent, cogent, and articulately expressed\nwish to forego such evidence for moral and ethical reasons. There is no basis to\nconclude that this decision stemmed from any conflict of interest adversely\naffecting counsel‘s performance or that counsel, if unconflicted, would likely have\nacted differently.12 Defendant essentially urges that counsel, and the court, were\nobliged to ensure defendant received a penalty defense whether he wanted one or\nnot, but such is not the case. (E.g., Lang, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1147525\"><a href=\"/opinion/1147525/people-v-lang/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1030-1031; see\nalso pt. E, post.) Similar considerations apply to defendant‘s argument that\nconflict-free counsel would and should have overridden defendant‘s wish that\ncounsel present no argument to the jury on his behalf. Defendant‘s contrary\nclaims lacks merit.\n\n                      iv. Defendant’s testimony.\n       Nor is there merit to defendant‘s claim that competent, unconflicted\ncounsel could, should, and likely would have raised valid objections to\ndefendant‘s testimony inviting the death penalty. A defendant, of course, has the\n\n\n12     Defendant urges that the adverse conflict-related influence on Attorney\nPeters‘s willingness not to present mitigating evidence in this case is\ncircumstantially demonstrated by the fact that, in at least one other capital trial,\nPeters did present mitigating evidence against his client‘s wishes. (See Douglas v.\nWoodford, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1049</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1087-1090 [finding, despite client‘s lack of\ncooperation, that Peters conducted inadequate mental and social history\ninvestigation, and noting that Peters had presented some sociological evidence\nthough client did not wish him to do so].)

Hence, he asserts, his counsel performed adversely, as the\nresult of their conflict, by failing to raise a relevance objection to his testimony.\n       As Lancaster itself observed, however, that decision is inapposite. There,\nthe defendant, ostensibly offering testimony in mitigation, sought to invoke\npolitical and racial considerations beyond his own case by comparing his\n― ‗wrongful[ ] convict[ion]‘ ‖ to that of Mumia Abu-Jamal, by suggesting that\nAfrican-American men who stand up and fight for their rights are labeled\n― ‗crazy,‘ ‖ and by asserting that ― ‗[t]hey experiment on black people.‘ ‖\n(Lancaster, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2622210\"><a href=\"/opinion/2622210/people-v-lancaster/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101.) The trial court sustained the prosecutor’s\nrelevance objections to this testimony. We found no error, holding that the\ndefendant‘s assertions impermissibly strayed beyond the pertinent factors in\nmitigation, i.e., the circumstances of his own offense and his own character and\nbackground. (Id., at pp. 101-102, & cases cited.)\n       In doing so, Lancaster rejected the defendant‘s reliance on Webb‘s\nstatement that ― ‗a defendant‘s absolute right to testify cannot be foreclosed or\ncensored based on content.‘ ‖ (Lancaster, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2622210\"><a href=\"/opinion/2622210/people-v-lancaster/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101-102, quoting\nWebb, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1122530\"><a href=\"/opinion/1122530/people-v-webb/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 535.) We indicated that ―[this] statement must be\nunderstood in context; it addressed Webb‘s contention that the trial court should\n\n\n\n\n                                           44\n\fnot have allowed him to testify in favor of a death sentence.‖ (Lancaster, supra, at\np. 102.)13 Lancaster thus made clear its holding did not undermine Webb‘s\npremise that the defendant does have the right to proffer such testimony, even over\nhis counsel‘s objections. Defendant‘s claim must be rejected.14\n\n               c. Competence to stand trial.\n       Defendant urges his counsel‘s conflict resulted in their failure to ensure that\nhe was not incompetent when he entered his ―slow plea,‖ when he was tried on the\nissue of penalty, and when he ―effectively stipulate[d]‖ to the death penalty by\npresenting no mitigating evidence or argument and by taking the stand to agree he\ndeserved execution. He asserts that his mental and emotional condition\ndeteriorated seriously before and during the penalty proceedings as a result of the\n―draconian‖ conditions of his incarceration, that his behavior made this\ndeterioration obvious, and that his counsel expressly realized his worsening mental\nand emotional state was interfering with his ability to assist in his defense.\nNonetheless, he observes, his counsel assiduously avoided claiming he was\nincompetent. They did so, defendant posits, because their concerns about their\npersonal involvement in the Nguyen murder conspiracy motivated them to curry\nfavor with prosecutors by ensuring that defendant‘s penalty trial would not be\npostponed, and that he would promptly and predictably be sentenced to death.\n\n\n\n\n13     The quoted sentence was followed by a statement that ―[t]he relevance of\n[the defendant‘s testimony in Webb] was not challenged.‖ (Lancaster, supra,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2622210\"><a href=\"/opinion/2622210/people-v-lancaster/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102.) But this remark did not imply that defense counsel may raise\nsuch an objection against his own client‘s voluntary testimony.\n\n14      For similar reasons, we also find no merit to defendant‘s related argument\nthat the trial court had a sua sponte duty to prevent defendant‘s testimony.\n\n\n\n                                          45\n\f       Defendant‘s argument in this regard is closely intertwined with his related\nclaim that, based on the information available to it, the trial court erred by failing,\nsua sponte, to declare a doubt of his competence, and to order a hearing on that\nissue. Neither contention has merit.\n\n                    i.   Factual background.\n       The incompetence-related claims stem from the following facts: From the\nmoment of his federal arrest, defendant had been held in federal administrative\nsegregation, with severe limitations on his communications privileges, under the\nterms of 28 Code of Federal Regulations part 501.3 (hereafter section 501.3). This\nprovision authorizes the United States Attorney General to specify such conditions\nfor a federal prisoner or detainee whose communications would present a\nsubstantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to persons. Defendant‘s federal\nplea agreement included his stipulation that such conditions would continue for\nthe duration of his federal prison term.\n       After his federal conviction, defendant was kept in federal custody, at the\nLos Angeles Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC), under section 501.3\nconditions, pending disposition of the instant capital murder charges. Control over\nhis privileges resided with the federal district court. While he was housed in the\nMDC, and in violation of prior federal court orders, defendant was found in\npossession of a pen and pencils, and a number of forbidden written\ncommunications from defendant to other federal and state prisoners were\nintercepted. Certain of these communications included threats against the\nundercover officer who was instrumental in his federal conviction and an inmate\nin the Orange County Jail.\n       As a result of these incidents, the federal court in January 2000 imposed\nadditional restrictions on defendant‘s already severe conditions of confinement.\n\n\n\n                                           46\n\fDefendant was again prohibited from possessing writing materials; was essentially\ndenied contact with other inmates and most prison personnel; was forbidden\ntelephone communications except with counsel and, to a limited extent, with an\nelderly grandmother; and was allowed no visitors except his counsel and an aunt.\nAs implemented by MDC staff, these restrictions resulted in defendant‘s\nplacement in a sealed single cell, without radio, television, computer, or general\n(nonlegal) reading material. Two surveillance cameras kept constant watch on the\ncell‘s interior, and the cell‘s lights remained on 24 hours a day. For fear defendant\nwould use his cell toilet as a means of inmate communication, he was not allowed\nto flush the toilet; he was required to summon a guard to perform this task.\n       Defendant‘s counsel labored repeatedly, in several fora, and with limited\nsuccess, to obtain relief from these restrictions. In these efforts, counsel insisted\nthat while defendant had not become incompetent, the isolation, stress, and\nsensory deprivation of his confinement were causing his emotional and mental\ncondition to deteriorate, thus interfering with defense preparation for the trial.\n       As early as July 23, 1999, the day defendant entered his ―slow plea‖ on\nguilt and the special circumstance, counsel advised the court of defendant‘s\nisolation and restrictions at the MDC, alluding to the ―horrendous‖ emotional\neffects of these conditions. On July 30, 1999, counsel moved to continue the\npenalty trial date, then scheduled for August 9, 1999, to late September or early\nOctober 1999. Among other reasons, the written motion pointed to defendant‘s\nsevere confinement conditions as then in effect, noting that ―[t]his intensive\nconfinement and isolation has a very negative impact on his mental health,‖\n―interfere[s] with [his] ability to organize his thoughts[,] and results in very hostile\nemotion.‖\n       On October 8, 1999, the court held a hearing to determine what issues\nrequired resolution before commencement of the penalty trial, then scheduled for\n\n                                          47\n\fOctober 18. Among the matters addressed on October 8 were counsel‘s\ndifficulties in transporting defendant‘s father and uncle from Vietnam, and\ncourtroom security measures, including the possibility of physical restraints on\ndefendant and screening procedures for other persons entering the courtroom.\nAfter discussion, the court announced a tentative decision that it would not\n―wand‖ prospective jurors, but would ―wand‖ everyone else, i.e., ―anybody that\ndoesn‘t have a juror band,‖ before allowing them to enter.\n       At this point, defendant interrupted, insisting that if ―you wand my people,\nyou are going to wand everybody,‖ and that the court should not demonstrate\n―prejudice[ ]‖ by ―separat[ing] my side from their side and all that other shit.‖\nWhen the court repeated that it intended to ―wand‖ everybody who came into the\ngallery, i.e., observers, defendant said, ―Fuck it, don‘t wand anybody. If you have\na problem with me, say so.‖ When the court responded that it had no problem,\ndefendant continued, ―I have done what I need to this court, and this court is going\nto rush me into this, what kind of bullshit is that? Fucking nothing is going to be\ndone on the 18th, if we are going to say anything . . . .‖ When the judge told\ndefendant to ―get it out of your system,‖ defendant retorted, ―Play fucking games\nand we will play fucking games.‖ At a subsequent hearing on October 18, 1999,\nafter granting a defense motion to continue the trial, the court warned defendant\nthat further outbursts like the one on October 8 would result in his removal from\nthe courtroom for the duration.\n       On February 4, 2000, counsel informed the court of the increased federal\nconfinement restrictions imposed in January. Counsel indicated that although\ndefendant was psychologically ―tough‖ and ―strong,‖ there was concern about the\nimpact on him of ―this virtual total isolation and lack of stimulation.‖\n       On February 25, 2000, the trial court attempted several times to obtain\ndefendant‘s time waiver so the penalty trial could be continued from March 13,\n\n                                         48\n\f2000, to April 3, 2000. Each time, defendant professed not to understand and said\nhe needed time to talk to his lawyers. The court said ―[g]o ahead,‖ noting that\ndefendant‘s principal counsel, Peters, was present. However, defendant insisted\nPeters was only one of his attorneys and indicated he ―need[ed] two.‖ During the\nproceeding, Peters explained that defendant ―is very agitated this morning,‖ likely\nbecause of the stress of his isolated confinement. Counsel asserted that\ndefendant‘s condition ―interferes with the ability to deal with him on a rational\nbasis, but I am not saying he is 1368 [i.e., incompetent], if he was, I would tell\nyou, of course, my obligation.‖15\n       On March 2, 2000, the trial court held an Evidence Code section 402\nhearing on defendant‘s conditions of confinement and their effect on penalty trial\npreparation. Among other things, the court heard testimony from Dr. Thomas, the\nclinical psychologist retained by the defense to assist in determining defendant‘s\ncompetency and to help develop mitigating penalty evidence.\n       Assessing a recent visit with defendant, Dr. Thomas indicated that, because\nof his disappointment over the harsh federal sentencing of Victoria Pham, the\nwithdrawal of his privilege to communicate with Pham, and the other conditions\nof his current confinement, he had become emotionally unstable and distrustful of\nthe defense team. According to Dr. Thomas, defendant was ―alternately enraged\nand kind of irrational,‖ and his ―emotional lability‖ was ―impairing the process of\nthe defense all the way around.‖ Dr. Thomas cautioned that defendant ―was\ncertainly not out of touch with reality at all, and certainly not unable to discuss,‖\nbut she agreed with defense counsel that ―some aspects of this custodial situation\n\n\n15    The reference is to section 1368, which sets forth the circumstances in\nwhich trial proceedings must be suspended pending a determination of the\ndefendant‘s mental competence.\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\fare causing [defendant‘s] emotions . . . , on a too frequent basis, to override his\njudgment.‖\n       Dr. Thomas acknowledged that defendant was intelligent, a violent\nsociopath, and a security risk whose own threats and rule violations had prompted\nthe current restrictions. Indeed, she agreed with the prosecutor that, in his anger\nand frustration, defendant had ―articulated feelings [of] wanting to kill people . . .\ninclud[ing] prosecutors, witnesses, judges, [and] the lieutenant at the holding\nfacility.‖ Nonetheless, she opined that a continuation of the current confinement\nconditions would cause defendant‘s ―ability to think clearly . . . to diminish,‖ that\n―it is not going to get any better,‖ and that she was ―unable to move forward at this\ntime‖ with her work for the defense. Later that same day, Attorney Peters\nrepresented in federal court that defendant was ―not incompetent, but he‘s\nbumping up against that sort of thing.‖\n       At a pretrial hearing on March 29, 2000, Attorney Peters noted that, though\nhe was prepared to put on mitigating penalty evidence, ―we have for some time\ntalked about putting no penalty evidence on.‖ However, Peters cautioned,\ndefendant ―needs to be in a situation where he can make rational decisions about\nthis‖ and indicated defendant‘s conditions of federal confinement were interfering\nwith that process. Accordingly, Peters indicated, he intended to seek relief in the\nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals from the federal district court‘s harsh confinement\norders. Peters declared that ―if I wanted to play games I could declare him 1368\nor something, but I don‘t believe he is 1368, he is just in a very difficult situation.‖\n       On March 30, 2000, as promised, counsel filed a petition for writ of\nmandate and stay in the federal appeals court. (Hung Thanh Mai v. United States\nDistrict Court, Central District of California (9th Cir. No. 0-70364).) The petition\nsought both an easing of defendant‘s confinement conditions and an order\npostponing the state capital penalty trial until his mental state improved and\n\n                                          50\n\fstabilized. The petition asserted that while defendant was not incompetent, the\npsychological effects of his confinement had led to ―a breakdown in the attorney\nclient relationship,‖ and to counsel‘s inability ―to effectively communicate with\n[him]‖ The Ninth Circuit denied the petition on April 7, 2000.\n       On April 11, 2000, while selection of the penalty jury in the instant case\nwas in progress, counsel filed a petition for mandate and stay in the California\nCourt of Appeal, Fourth District, Division Three. (Hung Thanh Mai v. Superior\nCourt of Orange County, G027290.) The petition sought a writ directing the trial\ncourt to order defendant‘s transfer from the MDC to the Orange County Jail\npending the trial, and a restraint on further trial proceedings. According to the\npetition, defendant‘s conditions of federal confinement were so restrictive that he\n―has become increasing[ly] unstable, to a point where [he] is having great\ndifficulty assisting his Counsel in the defense of his case.‖ The petition cited Dr.\nThomas‘s conclusions that, due to the ―dehumanizing‖ circumstances of\ndefendant‘s federal confinement, he ―is becoming extremely volatile‖ and ―cannot\nthink clearly,‖ and that, as a consequence, Dr. Thomas could not complete her\npenalty phase work. The Court of Appeal denied the petition the same day.\n       Jury selection was completed on the afternoon of April 11, 2000, and a jury\nwas sworn. Prior to adjournment, after the jurors had been dismissed for the day,\nthe court stated it had reviewed allegations in the Ninth Circuit writ proceeding\nthat defendant‘s confinement conditions had caused him to become mentally\nunstable, such that his psychologist and attorneys were unable to prepare him for\ntrial. The court said it wished ―to note [its] observations for the record. The\ndefendant has appeared in this courtroom on April 3rd, April 6th, April 10th, and\nApril the 11th during jury selection. [¶] He has attentively followed roll call page\nby page. He has read questionnaires and reviewed prospective juror lists. He has\nmade notes. He has appeared to consult with both his counsel concerning the lists\n\n                                         51\n\fand questionnaires. I note that he has assisted Mr. Peters [defense counsel] in the\nexercise of peremptory challenges. [¶] He has not given an appearance of being\nnervous or upset. On the contrary, he has appeared to be rather calm and collected\nduring this four-day time frame.‖\n       Counsel responded that, as confirmed by Dr. Thomas, defendant was\nexperiencing various physiological symptoms, that he was overreacting to the\nsmallest difficulties, and that the frustration produced by his confinement\nconditions meant he ―can‘t be objective‖ in dealing with the defense team.\nCounsel also alluded to an ―outburst‖ that morning which had required a delay\nuntil counsel could ―calm [defendant] down.‖\n       On the other hand, counsel reiterated that ―if [defendant] was 1368, I‘d say\nthat, I am not doing that because that would be a game, and I am not here to play\ngames.‖ ―[A]ll we are saying,‖ counsel insisted, was that the harsh confinement\nconditions were ―bound to have an effect on somebody. Especially somebody\nfacing the death penalty.‖\n       The next morning, April 12, 2000, the court noted, in a chambers\ndiscussion with counsel, that defendant had refused to come out of his cell at the\nMDC unless ordered by the court to do so. Once transported to Orange County\nand placed in the court‘s holding cell, the court observed, defendant ―has been so\nloud that you can almost hear it in the courtroom.‖\n       Defense Counsel Peters indicated that defendant ―has good reason to yell\nand scream,‖ but was now calm. Counsel said his experience was that ―[a]fter a\npoint in time [defendant] is able to vocalize enough of his anger that he gets back\nto some sort of rationality.‖ Counsel indicated defendant was upset because,\nseveral days earlier, he had seen the court clerk give coffee to the victim‘s family\nmembers, which made him feel he was not on neutral ground, and was also irate\nbecause his federal jailors had reneged on a promise to provide his lunch. Counsel\n\n                                         52\n\fagain indicated that defendant was not ―1368,‖ but was very upset and emotionally\n―volatil[e],‖ and had limited control over his behavior.\n       The court asked if defendant had complaints about a biased jury — a\nconcern the bailiff had reported. Again the court indicated ―the record should\nreflect I sat there and watched him exercise 20 peremptories through his counsel.‖\nCounsel said this was not the issue, and insisted that defendant was not trying to\nobstruct or delay. Counsel indicated that defendant well understood the reality of\nhis legal situation and ―knows what the [probable] outcome is,‖ particularly since\n―we may put on no defense, and the evidence is overwhelming and awfully\nbrutal.‖ According to counsel, this reality, and defendant‘s isolated confinement,\nwere precisely why small problems like the lunch issue became ―magnified‖ and\n―drive [defendant] crazy.‖ The court admonished counsel to remind defendant of\nthe court‘s prior warnings that it would not tolerate his ―disruptive conduct‖ and\n―foul language,‖ and that further outbursts or disruption would result in his\nexclusion from the trial.\n       Proceedings briefly resumed, but almost immediately, the court met with\ncounsel again in the hallway, out of defendant‘s presence. Defense Counsel Peters\nsaid defendant was concerned he might not be able to control himself in the\ncourtroom, and had therefore asked to be shackled to prevent him from ―act[ing]\nout.‖ Peters explained that when defendant first met with counsel that morning,\n―he was talking how he was going to act up, that he had nothing to lose, which is\ntrue.‖ Peters indicated there appeared to be grounds to accede to defendant‘s\nwishes ―for his safety and my safety and [Cocounsel O‘Connell‘s] safety.‖ Still,\nPeters observed, while he did not ―think [shackling] would be extremely\nprejudicial,‖ he would try to dissuade defendant if he believed otherwise. The\nprosecutor indicated he had no objection to the request, and the court granted it,\nordering that, while in court, defendant be restrained in ―Martin waist chains.‖\n\n                                         53\n\f       Defendant was brought into the courtroom, and the jurors were summoned.\nAs the court began to speak to the jury, defendant interrupted to say, ―Next time\nyou smile, throw a bigger smile my way.‖ The following colloquy ensued: ―THE\nCOURT: Pardon me, Mr. Mai? [¶] THE DEFENDANT: I am speaking to the\nBurt family, they want to be smart asses. [¶] THE COURT: Don‘t be speaking to\nthe Burt family. [¶] THE DEFENDANT: That‘s right.‖\n       As the court resumed addressing the jury, defendant again interrupted,\nstating that he ―need[ed] a break‖ and ―need[ed] to say something.‖ When the\ncourt told him to be quiet, defendant implored Defense Counsel Peters to ―speak\nup for me.‖ After a discussion with defendant, Peters explained to the court that\ndefendant ―just wanted to be assured it was your order that he be here this\nmorning.‖ When the court responded that it had so ordered, defendant asked, ―If\nyou have the power to do that, why don‘t you have the power to do anything\nelse?‖ The court advised defendant his counsel was speaking and warned\ndefendant not to disrupt, whereupon defendant requested that Peters ―ask [the\ncourt] if you have the power to do that, why don‘t you have the power to do other\nstuff?‖ Peters indicated he would make such an inquiry ―[a]t the appropriate\ntime,‖ and the court warned defendant again against further disruption.16\n       A short while later in the morning of April 12, 2000, the prosecutor was\noutlining for the jury the evidence he expected to produce about the incident on\nthe morning of Officer Burt‘s murder in which defendant brandished a handgun at\nanother driver on the freeway. Defendant interrupted to say, ―And I would do it\n\n\n16     Defendant‘s question is sensibly understood as asking why, if the court had\nthe authority to order him transported from the MDC to attend the trial, it did not\nalso have the authority to order that his conditions of confinement in that facility\nbe relaxed.\n\n\n\n                                         54\n\fagain.‖ The court ordered defendant to face toward the bench, and defendant\nresponded, ―Right.‖\n       On April 17, 2000, defendant disrupted the testimony of Mark Baker, who\nstated that, in September 1995, he witnessed a violent domestic altercation\nbetween defendant and Victoria Pham outside their apartment. When Baker\ntestified that during the struggle with Pham, defendant hit her with his fist and she\nfell to her knees, defendant interrupted to shout, ―Shut the fuck up, I think you are\nfull of shit. If I fucking hit [her] with a fist, I would have knocked her fucking ass\non the floor. What are you talking about?‖ When the court attempted to admonish\ndefendant, he muttered, ―You want to say something, speak the fucking truth,‖ and\n―[b]ullshit.‖\n       Baker then testified that when he tried to stop the fight by telling defendant\nto ― ‗[k]nock it off, you motherfucker,‘ ‖ defendant went into his apartment and\nreturned with a machine gun. At this point, defendant interrupted Baker‘s\ntestimony to declare, ―I should have killed your fucking ass is what I should have\ndone, waste my goddamn time.‖\n       Shortly thereafter, automobile salesman Bachand testified that in June\n1996, defendant and an accomplice abducted him at gunpoint during the test drive\nof a Honda Prelude. As noted above, defendant interrupted to shout that\nBachand‘s testimony was ―bullshit,‖ because defendant had no incentive to steal a\n―piece of shit Honda,‖ and that if defendant had been one of the carjackers, he\nwould have ―wasted [Bachand‘s] fucking ass.‖ Moments later, when Bachand\nsaid defendant had warned that he and his companion were ―Asian, Vietnamese\nMafia,‖ defendant interrupted to mutter, ―Asian Mafia, stupid fuck.‖ The court\nadmonished defendant against further disruptions. Nonetheless, as Bachand\ncontinued his testimony, defendant overturned the counsel table and was removed\nto a detention area by the bailiffs.\n\n                                          55\n\f       On April 19, 2000, after the prosecution rested, defendant confirmed on the\nrecord that, despite his counsel‘s advice and wishes, he declined to present any\nmitigating evidence, opposed any effort by his counsel to speak in his behalf, and\nintended to testify about his opinion of the appropriate penalty. The court warned\ndefendant that he was acting unwisely, that he could not appeal a resulting death\nsentence on grounds of incompetence or attorney error, and that these decisions\nwere tantamount to suicide. In response, defendant insisted that he was ―not\nsuicidal,‖ felt he was competent, and was ―just doing the right thing that I feel\nthat‘s necessary.‖\n       Defendant confirmed he would ―act out‖ if counsel exercised their\nprerogative to present an argument, though ―[i]t is not something I want to do.‖ In\nresponse to a query from the court, defendant indicated he assumed his\nunderstanding with his counsel was ―pretty firm.‖ He iterated that ―I just feel this\nis right, and I am hoping my lawyer agrees to that.‖ On this basis, as noted above,\ncounsel announced he would accede to defendant‘s wishes.\n\n                     ii.

Discussion.\n        Here, the record discloses no basis to conclude that counsel, driven by a\nconflict of interest, avoided seeking a competency hearing even though they\nbelieved defendant was incompetent. Nor are there grounds to infer that\nunconflicted counsel would likely have sought such a hearing. Indeed, as we\nexplain hereafter, the record contains no substantial evidence of defendant‘s\nincompetence. Reasonably interpreted, it suggests counsel had a difficult client\nwhose own calculated acts had resulted in his severe conditions of confinement,\nand whose frustration with the terms of his custody contributed to his anger,\nemotional volatility, distrust of counsel, and frequent lack of cooperation with\nthem.\n        Counsel worked assiduously to ease these custodial conditions, urging in\nseveral fora, and by vigorous advocacy, that the resulting emotional toll on\ndefendant was seriously interfering with defense efforts. But the record does not\nindicate that, contrary to counsel‘s consistent representations, they knew or should\nhave known defendant‘s confinement had rendered him mentally unable, rather\nthan emotionally unwilling, to help with his defense. We have frequently\n\n\n\n\n                                          58\n\frecognized the distinction, as counsel apparently did, and have made clear that an\nuncooperative attitude is not, in and of itself, substantial evidence of\nincompetence. (See, e.g., Elliott, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 583; Lewis, supra,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 526; Medina, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1127426\"><a href=\"/opinion/1127426/people-v-medina/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 735; People v.

On the\ncontrary, she acknowledged defendant‘s intelligence, indicated he was ―not out of\ntouch with reality at all,‖ and agreed he was ―certainly able to discuss‖ his legal\nsituation. She suggested simply that the emotional instability stemming from his\ncustodial status sometimes caused him to be ―kind of irrational,‖ affected his\n―ability to think clearly,‖ and made it difficult to obtain his cooperation.\n       Counsel made similar representations in court, additionally noting that\ndefendant understood the reality of his legal situation, and that once allowed to\nfully vocalize his anger and frustration, he was usually able to calm down and\nbehave rationally. Counsel‘s concession that these circumstances did not amount\nto mental incompetence does not indicate counsel performed adversely as the\nresult of a conflict of interest.\n       Defendant‘s ―self-defeating‖ outbursts in court also do not constitute\nevidence that should and likely would have persuaded competent, unconflicted\ncounsel to seek a competency hearing. These episodes demonstrated that\ndefendant was often angry and resentful. But, as noted above, disruptive behavior\nis not substantial evidence of incompetence unless, by its particular nature, it casts\ndoubt on the defendant‘s ability to assist in his or her defense. (E.g., Elliott,\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 583; Medina, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1127426\"><a href=\"/opinion/1127426/people-v-medina/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 735.) Here, aside\n\n\n                                          59\n\ffrom one incident of momentary confusion over a time waiver, defendant‘s\ncourtroom demeanor, words, and conduct never indicated he did not understand\nthe proceedings or was actually unable to assist his lawyers.\n       Indeed, defendant‘s anger and resentment were often connected in an\nunderstandable way to the trial proceedings. Thus, defendant protested when he\nthought he was being rushed to trial, or worried that the court‘s security measures\nmight discriminate against ―my people,‖ or feared that court personnel were too\nsolicitous of the victim‘s family, or reacted to witnesses who were giving\ndamaging testimony against him. Defendant appeared capable of speaking up\nwhen he felt the need to consult with his lawyers in light of courtroom\ndevelopments, and, at one point, he asked pertinent questions about the court‘s\nauthority over the conditions of his confinement.\n       Moreover, after reviewing allegations that the conditions of defendant‘s\nconfinement were seriously affecting his mental and emotional state, the trial court\nmade clear on the record that its observations of defendant did not indicate\nincompetence. In particular, the court noted that defendant had calmly, but\nactively, participated in the extended process of jury selection, reviewing\nquestionnaires and juror lists, making notes, and assisting counsel in the exercise\nof peremptory challenges. In sum, certain of defendant‘s behavior, as disclosed by\nthe record, was rude, disruptive, and even menacing, but this behavior afforded no\nsubstantial grounds upon which unconflicted counsel should and likely would\nhave pursued a claim of incompetence.\n       We reach a similar conclusion with respect to defendant‘s consistent and\nfirmly stated intention to dispense with mitigating evidence, present no argument,\nand invite the jury to impose a judgment of death. A wish for the death penalty,\nand an insistence on presenting no penalty defense, are not, by themselves,\nevidence of incompetence sufficient to trigger competency proceedings. (E.g.,\n\n                                         60\n\fPeople v. Blair (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2576153\"><a href=\"/opinion/2576153/people-v-blair/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 718; People v.

Defendant made clear he understood the consequences of his decision,\nand he expressed his reasons coherently, even eloquently, to the jury. He\nexplained he was motivated by reluctance to beg in court for sympathy or pity, by\nhis personal code of ―two eyes for every eye,‖ and by his belief that, as ―part of\nthe game,‖ the time had come to pay in full for his murder of Officer Burt. These\nwell-stated moral sentiments in no way belied a mental ability to understand the\nproceedings and to assist in defending them. Defendant‘s attitude is not\nsubstantial evidence he was incompetent. Accordingly, it provides no ground to\nconclude that, as the result of a conflict of interest, counsel omitted to pursue a\npotentially valid incompetency claim.17\n\n17      Defendant notes Victoria Pham‘s claim that defendant became more violent\nafter a near-fatal car accident, causing the defense psychologist to suspect brain\ndamage. Citing Pate v. Robinson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, defendant urges that\nevidence of a head injury with subsequent irrationality and behavioral changes\nraises a ―red flag‖ regarding competence, and constitutes, as a matter of law,\nsufficient evidence to require a competency hearing. But the scant evidence here\ndoes not remotely compare with the evidence found in Pate to raise a bona fide\ndoubt of competence. Pate, convicted of killing his common law wife during an\nirrational episode, had a history of severe disturbance dating back to a childhood\naccident in which a brick fell on his head. His turbulent history included frequent\nepisodes of bizarre behavior, hallucinations, and delusions, a stay in a psychiatric\nhospital, and the prior killing of his 18-month-old son, after which he tried to\ncommit suicide. At his trial, four witnesses testified, without contradiction, that he\nwas insane. This evidence, in combination, persuaded the high court that Pate\nshould have received a full inquiry into his competence.\n       Here, by contrast, there is no real indication that defendant‘s sociopathic\nbehavior, whatever its cause, had any logical connection to legal incompetence.\nMoreover, the possibility of injury-related brain damage does not, in and of itself,\nsuggest inability to meet the legal standard for competence to stand trial. (See\nLewis, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 525; People v.

Though offered for a different purpose, the testimony of the\npsychologist who suspected defendant‘s accident might have caused brain damage\n                                                           (Footnote continued on next page.)\n\n\n                                          61\n\f        For similar reasons, we reject defendant‘s alternative argument that the trial\ncourt had a sua sponte duty to declare a doubt of his competence, and to initiate\ncompetency proceedings. As we have explained, the record discloses no\nsubstantial evidence that defendant was mentally incompetent. No qualified\nwitness so testified; counsel‘s various descriptions of defendant‘s mental and\nemotional state did not equate to incompetence; and defendant‘s observable\nactions and decisions did not necessarily suggest he lacked the requisite ability to\nparticipate rationally in his defense. Moreover, the trial court‘s day-to-day\nobservation of defendant‘s demeanor and conduct, including his episodes of\ndisruptive behavior, did not cause the court to doubt his competence — a fact the\ncourt felt obliged to place on the record not once, but twice. Under these\ncircumstances, the court did not err by taking no action to determine whether\ndefendant was competent.\n\n                  d. Advice to defendant.\n        Finally, defendant points to comments by Attorney Peters, at various points\nin the record (never in the jury‘s presence), expressing the pessimistic view that\nthere was little realistic hope at either the guilt or penalty stages. Defendant\ncharacterizes certain of these remarks as suggesting counsel‘s personal view that\ndefendant deserved the death penalty. Such comments, defendant asserts, are\ncircumstantial evidence that counsel, burdened by their conflict of interest, advised\n\n\n\n(Footnote continued from previous page.)\n\nsuggested strongly that he was not mentally unable to understand the proceedings\nand assist rationally in his defense. Nothing in Pate convinces us that effective,\nunconflicted counsel should and likely would have used the information about\ndefendant‘s auto accident to raise a reasonable doubt of his competence.\n\n\n\n\n                                            62\n\fdefendant incompetently by overstating the hopelessness of his case, by\nsuggesting he had no viable defenses,18 and by urging him to submit the guilt and\nspecial circumstance issues and forego the presentation of mitigating evidence and\nargument at the penalty phase. Further, defendant asserts, Attorney Peters violated\nhis duties as an advocate by publicly stating his personal view that defendant\ndeserved the death penalty. (Citing, e.g., U.S. v. Swanson (9th Cir. 1991) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1070</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1074; Osborn v.

First, as defendant concedes, the record does not, for\nthe most part, disclose what advice counsel privately imparted to him. If anything,\nhowever, the record indicates defendant himself insisted throughout the\nproceedings, for reasons he cogently explained to the penalty jury, that once he\nwas brought to justice, his personal code of honor obliged him to pay for his\nmurder of Officer Burt without any effort to seek sympathy or mercy in a court of\nlaw. The record also contains numerous indications that his attorneys did attempt\nto get him to change his mind,19 but that he virtually coerced them to agree to his\nwishes by threatening to engage in inflammatory disruptions before the jury if they\ntried to overrule him.\n       Second, as counsel knew, there was indeed overwhelming evidence that\ndefendant gunned down a CHP officer during a routine traffic stop, ultimately\nexecuting the officer by firing a bullet into the victim‘s head at close range while\n\n18     In reality, defendant asserts, he had a strong defense to the peace officer\nspecial circumstance, on grounds he was stopped and detained illegally by Officer\nBurt. He further urges that a fully developed mitigating case, based on his escape\nfrom Vietnam, his cultural difficulties in adjusting to life in the United States, and\nhis possible brain damage, might well have persuaded a jury to spare his life.\n19     As Attorney Peters stated at the hearing on the automatic motion to modify\nthe death verdict, ―we spent hundreds of hours talking about that topic.‖\n\n\n\n                                          63\n\fhe lay helpless. Counsel could also reasonably conclude that a fact finder,\nwhether court or jury, would likely be unpersuaded by a special circumstance\ndefense that questioned the legality of the traffic stop. And, though a death\njudgment was not inevitable, neither the facts of the capital crime nor the violent\nand obstreperous personality defendant displayed during the penalty trial were\nlikely to engender sympathy with a jury deciding the issue of life or death.\n       Under these difficult circumstances, the record discloses no ground to\nconclude that counsel rendered adverse or deficient assistance if they advised\ndefendant to preserve credibility at a penalty trial by allowing his counsel to tell\nthe penalty jury he ―had done the right thing‖ by not contesting guilt. Similarly, if\ncounsel suggested defendant should reserve for appeal the argument that the\npreliminary hearing transcript contained insufficient evidence he was illegally\ndetained by the murder victim, this advice, too, was not adverse or incompetent.\nNor, on the basis of the record before us, did counsel perform adversely if they\noffered the candid and reasonable prediction that a death judgment was likely,\nregardless of any case in mitigation that could be put forward.\n       Finally, we do not interpret Attorney Peters‘s comments on the record as\nconcessions that he personally believed defendant deserved to die. Rather, they\nappear as attempts, on behalf of a client who had resisted all efforts to portray him\nsympathetically, to urge that, in the end, he was at least taking responsibility for\nhis actions, did not seek to avoid the consequences of his murder of Officer Burt,\nand thus was not wholly irredeemable.\n       For all the reasons set forth above, we conclude the record fails to\ndemonstrate that defendant‘s trial counsel performed adversely as the result of a\nconflict of interest, or that they otherwise rendered constitutionally inadequate\nassistance. As a result, we need not, and do not, address defendant‘s extensive\nargument that a ―presumption of prejudice‖ should apply to counsel‘s adverse\n\n                                          64\n\fperformance arising from the type of conflict defendant asserts here.

(See Mickens, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118492\"><a href=\"/opinion/118492/mickens-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 171-174.)\n\n\n\n                                          65\n\f          As indicated above, the preliminary hearing evidence indicated that the\ntraffic stop occurred in the early evening of July 13, 1996. Defendant‘s associate,\nChang Nguyen, testified that defendant gave him the following account of the\ncircumstances leading to the victim‘s death: Officer Burt stopped defendant for\nfailure to have his headlights on. Defendant did not show the officer his own\ndriver‘s license, but instead gave a false name. The officer learned that the\ndriver‘s license in that name was suspended. He thereupon advised defendant he\nwould have to tow the car, but first must perform an inventory search of the\nvehicle. The officer opened the car‘s trunk, looked inside, and told defendant he\nwas under arrest. Defendant, aware that he had crime evidence in the trunk and\ndetermined not to leave a witness to a third strike offense, then proceeded to shoot\nthe officer.\n          Defendant‘s insufficient-evidence claim proceeds on the premise that, in\norder for the peace officer special circumstance to apply, the officer must have\nbeen performing his duties ―lawfully‖ at the time he was killed. (See pt. A.4.a,\nante.) Defendant does not seriously argue the record lacks evidence the officer‘s\nactions during the traffic stop were lawful. However, he urges the record of the\npreliminary hearing, on which the special circumstance finding was made, fails to\ninclude evidence from which a rational fact finder could conclude beyond\nreasonable doubt that Officer Burt had legal cause to stop and detain him at the\noutset.\n          Because Officer Burt‘s death at defendant‘s hands prevented the victim\nfrom explaining, in sworn testimony, the reason and basis for the stop, the only\nevidence on that issue came from Nguyen, who testified — without objection from\nthe defense — that defendant said ―he was driving and he thought he had his light\n[sic] on, but he got pulled over by [a] California Highway Patrolman for not\nhaving his light [sic] [on].‖ Defendant‘s statement to Nguyen was amply\n\n                                           66\n\fsufficient to allow a fact finder — here, a learned trial judge — to infer, first, that\nfailure to have his headlights on was the reason defendant was stopped; second,\nthat he understood he should have had his lights on; and third, that he actually did\nnot have them on. No evidence disputed or contradicted these inferences.21\n       Other evidence also supports them. In 1996, as now, the law required a\nmotor vehicle‘s headlights to be on when the vehicle was driven between one-half\nhour after sunset and one-half hour before sunrise. (Veh. Code, §§ 280, 24400,\n38335.) Bernice Sarthou testified at the preliminary hearing that she observed the\ntraffic stop involving defendant and Officer Burt as she pulled into an adjacent\n\n\n21     Defendant concedes his account to Nguyen of his own actions leading to\nthe shooting of Officer Burt were declarations against interest, and were thus not\nmade inadmissible for their truth by the hearsay rule. (Evid. Code, § 1230.)\nHowever, he asserts that Officer Burt‘s ―no headlights‖ statement to him, as\nrelated to Nguyen, was not offered by the prosecution for its ―truth,‖ but for the\n―non-hearsay purpose of explaining and putting into context [defendant‘s]\nadmissions.‖ This claim is based on the prosecutor‘s response to a defense\n―multiple hearsay‖ objection to later testimony by Nguyen that Officer Burt\nadvised defendant he would have do an inventory search on defendant‘s car. The\nprosecutor said he understood that ―the layer from the officer to the defendant is\nnot for the truth of the matter.‖ The court agreed, indicating that evidence of\nOfficer Burt‘s ―inventory search‖ statement was presented to make the defendant‘s\nadmissions ―meaningful,‖ and overruled the objection. However, as noted, the\ndefense made no hearsay objection when Nguyen testified defendant said that\nOfficer Burt stopped him because his headlights were off. Moreover, the hearsay\nrule did not make inadmissible Officer Burt‘s statement as evidence of his intent\nand purpose — i.e., his state of mind — in stopping defendant. (Evid. Code,\n§ 1250, subd. (a)(2).) And to the extent Officer Burt‘s out-of-court ―no\nheadlights‖ statement was ―testimonial‖ (see Crawford v. Washington (2004)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">), the doctrine of ―forfeiture by wrongdoing‖ precludes defendant from\nclaiming his constitutional rights were violated because he was unable to confront,\nin court, an out-of-court declarant whom he killed, as the undisputed evidence\nshows, to prevent the declarant from appearing as a witness against him.

As noted above (ante, fn. 8), we\nhave taken judicial notice of the indisputable fact that sunset occurred in Fullerton\non that date at 8:04 p.m. On this evidence, a rational fact finder could infer that, at\nthe time the stop occurred, dusk was approaching, and that Officer Burt thus\nreasonably concluded the law required defendant‘s headlights to be on.\n       Defendant stresses Sarthou‘s insistence, on both direct and cross-\nexamination, that when she first observed defendant and Officer Burt, she was\nwearing her sunglasses because the sun had not yet set. But this testimony\ncontradicted Sarthou‘s equally consistent time estimate, as compared with the\nactual time of sunset on July 13, 1996. It was also inconsistent with defendant‘s\nstatement to Nguyen that ―he thought he had his light[s] on.‖ As between\nSarthou‘s contradictory recollections, and considering the totality of relevant\nevidence, the fact finder was not obliged to credit Sarthou‘s ―sun was still up‖\ntestimony. Instead, the fact finder could believe her assertion she first observed\nthe traffic stop at a time that was, in fact, approximately one-half hour after sunset.\nThere was sufficient evidence to support a determination that Officer Burt acted\nlawfully when he stopped defendant‘s vehicle on July 13, 1996.22\n\n\n\n\n22     Evidence adduced at the penalty trial does not alter these conclusions.\nSarthou testified, consistently with her preliminary hearing account, that she\nobserved the traffic stop around 8:30 p.m. and was wearing sunglasses. Other\nwitnesses to the traffic stop gave time estimates that varied between 8:00 p.m. and\n8:30 p.m. Eyewitness Benjamin Baldauf, who agreed 8:30 was ―about the right\ntime frame,‖ also said the lighting was ―long on shadows, just before dark‖.\nA CHP dispatcher testified that he received a ―license check‖ call from Officer\nBurt around 8:30 p.m.\n\n\n\n\n                                          68\n\f       C. Claim of biased juror.\n       Defendant urges that his rights under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution, and under article I, section 16 of\nthe California Constitution, were violated by the seating of Juror No. 12, who, he\nasserts, was actually biased on the issue of penalty. Defendant acknowledges that\nhis lawyers did not challenge Juror No. 12 for cause, use a peremptory challenge\nto excuse the juror,23 or express dissatisfaction with the jury as sworn.

Nonetheless, defendant\ncontends the state is constitutionally disentitled to carry out a death judgment\njoined by a biased juror. Alternatively, he asserts that his counsel‘s failure to\nchallenge Juror No. 12 for cause, or to use a peremptory challenge against this\njuror, constituted ineffective assistance. In any event, he insists the court should\nhave excused the juror sua sponte.\n       However the issue is framed, we are unpersuaded by the merits of\ndefendant‘s argument that Juror No. 12 demonstrated actual penalty bias. Hence,\ndefendant‘s claim must be rejected.\n       ― ‗The state and federal constitutional guarantees of a trial by an impartial\njury include the right in a capital case to a jury whose members will not\nautomatically impose the death penalty for all murders, but will instead consider\nand weigh the mitigating evidence in determining the appropriate sentence. . . .

That a\nprospective juror might weigh the aggravating and mitigating evidence in light of\nhis or her death penalty views is not necessarily a ground for exclusion. Opinions\nabout the death penalty may disqualify a penalty juror only if they would prevent\nthe juror from engaging in the weighing process and deliberating the issue of\npenalty.

Such responses do not necessarily require, or justify, a\njuror‘s excusal for bias.

Asked what\nopinions, based on this information, he had formed about the appropriate sentence,\nJuror No.12 answered, ―My opinion — death sentence.‖ On the other hand, Juror\nNo. 12 answered ―yes‖ to the question whether he could set aside his prior\nknowledge of the case and decide it on the evidence presented in court ―and the\nlaw given to you at the conclusion of the case.‖ To the question whether he could\nset aside any preformed opinions about the case and decide it on the evidence and\nlaw presented during trial, Juror No. 12 responded, ―I think so.‖\n       In response to a question whether he had recently followed other criminal\ncases in the news media, Juror No. 12 answered ―yes,‖ and explained he had\nfollowed ―[t]he appeals to let the woman in Texas be excused from [the] death\npenalty because she found God.‖ A follow-up question inquired whether a case or\ncases the prospective juror had followed might affect his or her ability to be a fair\nand impartial juror. Juror No. 12 checked ―yes‖ and indicated, ―[if] defendant said\nhe‘d found God and should be spared for that reason.‖\n       Following these questions and answers, the questionnaire included a section\ntitled ―Attitudes About the Death Penalty.‖ This section was prefaced by an\nextended description of the nature of a capital penalty trial. The preface explained\nthat the jury was to determine the appropriate penalty by ―weighing‖ various\naggravating and mitigating (―bad and good‖) things about the crime, the\ndefendant, and his background, ―including a consideration of sympathy.‖ It\nadmonished that the weighing process was not quantitative, but qualitative, and\nthat, to fix the penalty at death, the jury must be persuaded the aggravating factors\n\n                                          71\n\f―are so substantial in comparison with the mitigating factors‖ that death, rather\nthan life without parole, was warranted.\n       The questionnaire than asked whether, ―[b]ased on the above,‖ the\nprospective juror‘s views would cause him or her to automatically vote for life or\ndeath. Juror No. 12 answered ―no‖ in each case. When queried as to his\n―GENERAL FEELINGS about the death penalty,‖ Juror No. 12 responded, ―I‘m\nfor it.‖ Asked whether he thought the death penalty was used too seldom, too\nrandomly, or too often, Juror No. 12 stated, ―Too many appeals that take too\nlong.‖ Asked whether he could set aside his personal feelings about what the law\nought to be and follow the court‘s instructions, Juror No. 12 checked ―yes,‖ and\nwrote, ―I‘m for the death penalty but if [the] court proved to me that defendant\nshould be spared death — I might not vote death.‖\n       The next questionnaire section was titled ―Penalty Trial – Factors to\nConsider.‖ The single question in this section was preceded by an explanation that\npersons selected to serve as penalty jurors would receive instructions listing the\nrelevant factors in the penalty determination. These factors were then set forth,\nincluding ―[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime\neven though it is not a legal excuse for the crime (and any sympathetic or other\naspect of the defendant‘s character and record) that the defendant offers as a basis\nfor a sentence less than death, whether or not related to the offense for which he is\non trial.‖ The questionnaire then asked if the prospective juror felt that any of the\nlisted factors should ―never‖ be considered in determining the appropriate\npunishment.

Paraphrased, these questions were whether the\nprospective juror (1) could personally vote for death if he or she believed that was\nthe appropriate punishment, (2) could personally vote for life without parole if he\nor she believed this was a case where death was not appropriate, and (3) would\ncarefully consider both options before deciding. The court then asked several\nprospective jurors individually, including Juror No. 12, how they would respond to\nthose questions. Juror No. 12 answered, ―Yes to all three.‖\n       The court addressed Juror No. 12 about his ―I think so‖ response to the\nquestionnaire inquiry whether he could set aside preformed views and decide the\ncase on the evidence and the law. ―Can you assure counsel and [me],‖ the court\nasked, ―that you can set aside any preconceived opinion and decide this case —? ‖\nJuror No. 12 interjected, ―I think I can, if they can give me a good reason that\nsomebody shouldn‘t be put to death, I believe I would vote in that direction.‖ The\ncourt then asked, ―So your position is that they have to prove why somebody\nshould not be put to death?‖ Juror No. 12 answered, ―Uh-huh.‖\n       Shortly thereafter, the court addressed general remarks to the panelists,\nincluding Juror No. 12, who were in the jury box.

Peters inquired whether ―that [is] going to\nleak over into the facts of this case, the law involved in this case.‖ Juror No. 12\nsaid, ―I don‘t think so.‖ Peters suggested, ―That‘s more of a political problem than\nanything else?‖ Juror No. 12 answered, ―Yeah.‖ Peters queried whether Juror No.\n12 could ―weigh the aggravating and mitigating, whatever those turn out to be, and\nrender a fair verdict.‖ Juror No. 12 responded, ―I think so.‖ Without further\nquestions to Juror No. 12, the defense passed the panelists in the box, including\nJuror No. 12, for cause.\n       The prosecutor asked Juror No. 12 whether, ―[f]rom what you heard about\nthe case, what it is about, a police officer victim, do you think you could sit and be\nthat kind of juror we were talking about who can consider both [penalties], who\ncan accept the death penalty and vote or impose either one.‖ Juror No. 12\nanswered, ―Yes.‖ When the prosecutor then posited that ―[y]ou think you can do\nthat?,‖ Juror No. 12 responded, ―Yes, I do.‖ Without further questions to Juror\nNo. 12, the prosecution passed the panelists in the jury box, including Juror No.\n12, for cause.\n       Under these circumstances, Juror No. 12‘s written and oral responses did\nnot demonstrate, as a matter of law, that his death penalty views would ― ‗prevent\nor substantially impair‘ the performance of the juror‘s duties as defined by the\ncourt‘s instructions and the juror‘s oath.‖ (Crittenden, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2614001\"><a href=\"/opinion/2614001/people-v-crittenden/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121.)\nJuror No. 12 expressed unequivocal general support for the death penalty,\nconceded his pretrial impression that death was appropriate in this case, and\nasserted he started from the perspective that the defense had the burden of proving\notherwise. However, advised at several points that he must follow the law and\n\n                                          75\n\finstructions regardless of his personal views, and must frankly disclose if he felt\nunable to do so, he consistently indicated that he could and would subordinate his\nviews, carefully weigh and consider the aggravating and mitigating evidence as\ninstructed, vote for either death or life without parole as appropriate, and sit fairly\nin accordance with the juror‘s oath. He further noted the insight of a colleague\nwho had recently served as a capital juror that, whatever one‘s preconceived\nnotions, it was impossible to understand the solemn realities of that role until one\nhad experienced it.\n        The record thus fails to establish that Juror No. 12 was a biased juror. This\nconclusion disposes of defendant‘s contentions that the trial court had a sua sponte\nduty to excuse Juror No. 12, and that his counsel was incompetent for failing to\nchallenge this juror.\n        The first of these claims fails for the following reasons: Had the trial court\n— which was able to observe Juror No. 12‘s demeanor and evaluate his credibility\nunder voir dire questioning — denied a challenge for cause on the ground of\npenalty bias, its ruling would have been upheld on appeal as supported by\nsubstantial evidence, and within the court‘s discretion.

It suggested the\ndefense was required to demonstrate a ―strong likelihood‖ of discrimination in the\nexcusal of these prospective jurors, and expressed doubt such a likelihood was\nestablished by the mere fact that ―all three [were] of the same racial group.‖\nDefense counsel responded there was further ―circumstantial evidence‖ of\ndiscrimination, i.e., counsel‘s recollection that, except for their race, these\nprospective jurors were indistinguishable from others the prosecution had failed to\nexcuse. Ultimately, though the court found the prima facie issue ―marginal,‖ it\nasked the prosecutor to give his reasons for the excusals.\n       As to M.H., the prosecutor indicated, ―[M.H.] is single. She has no\nchildren. She is younger than the juror I prefer. She is in her 30‘s. She is also,\nher attitude regarding the death penalty was personal and emotional, not\nphilosophical. She was the one who talked about, if it was my family I could\nunderstand it. But primarily the reason [is] she is young, single and no children.\nThere [are] no other jurors on the jury presently who fit that pattern.‖\n       As to P.F., the prosecutor stated that ―she is also younger than I want, in her\n30‘s. She had a very casual attitude and dress. She said that, well, in her\nquestionnaire [the death penalty] was appropriate only where there was a pattern\nof violent conduct, which is not the law. And she didn‘t seem particularly\ninterested in the proceedings. And when I was talking to her she seemed rather\nbored with my questions, and with [defense counsel‘s] questions.‖\n       As to L.P., the prosecutor declared that ―I had two reasons for challenging\nher. Her present occupation. She is a social worker. And I generally try not to\nhave social workers. I generally will use a peremptory on social workers unless\nthere is a reason not to. She also said that she couldn‘t vote for the death penalty\nunless it was proved, the facts were proved beyond a shadow of a doubt, which is\n\n\n\n                                           78\n\fnot the law either. So I felt she might be holding the People to a stronger burden\non some of the facts, particularly the other acts that are alleged.‖\n       As additional explanation pertaining to all the prospective jurors at issue,\nthe prosecutor advised that ―I grade [prospective jurors] on a system of one to ten\nand before seeing the jurors I graded [L.P.] a three, [P.F.] a three plus, and . . .\n[M.H.] a four.‖\n       At this point, defense counsel interjected, ―I just want to point out that\n[Juror No. 12] is also unmarried.‖ Apparently confused by counsel‘s remark, the\ncourt indicated, ―I think we are still doing peremptories, aren‘t we?‖ Defense\ncounsel responded by saying, ―I know. I am finding everything, I am a lawyer,\nI am finding every —,‖ whereupon the court asked, ―Anything further?‖ The\nprosecutor said, ―No.‖ The court asked whether the matter was submitted, and\ndefense counsel said, ―Yes.‖\n       The court thereupon ruled as follows: ―Well, the court finds that no\ndiscriminatory intent is inherent in the explanations, and the reasons appear to be\nrace neutral, and on those grounds the court will deny the Wheeler motion.‖\n\n           2.

As in a recent prior opinion on this subject (People v.\nWilliams (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 715 (dis. opn. of Liu, J.)), the concurring\nopinion‘s author concedes that in concluding otherwise,we adhere to our well-\nestablished precedent. (Conc. opn. of Liu, J., at p. 7.)\n       Our practice does not indicate, as the concurring opinion suggests,\ninsensitivity to claims that a peremptory excusal has been employed for a\ndiscriminatory reason. On the contrary, it honors the principles that should and do\nattend the evaluation of such claims. A party has an absolute right, within\nstatutory limits, to excuse a prospective juror for any nondiscriminatory reason,\nhowever subjective, that gives the party concern about the juror‘s suitability. We\npresume this right is exercised in good faith, and the burden is always on the party\nclaiming discrimination to establish it. When the trial court has inquired into the\nbasis for an excusal, and a nondiscriminatory explanation has been provided, we\nalso assume the court understands, and carries out, its duty to subject the proffered\nreasons to sincere and reasoned analysis, taking into account all the factors that\nbear on their credibility. Finally, we recognize that the trial rather than the\nappellate court is best suited to determine, under all the relevant circumstances,\nwhether the proffered reasons are likely the real ones.\n        Deference to the trial court in such a case, even in the absence of a detailed\nruling, hardly constitutes ―a ‗don‘t ask, don‘t tell‘ approach to appellate review.‖\n(Conc. opn. of Liu, J., post, at p. 25.) In a stage three Wheeler/Batson analysis,\nthe trial court rules only after the party who exercised the challenged excusal was\nasked, and did tell, the reasons for this action. Here, the trial court accepted\nexplanations that are facially permissible, inherently plausible, and factually\nsupported, and defendant cites no substantial evidence of pretext. Under such\ncircumstances, there is no reason on appeal to suspect a dereliction of duty by the\ntrial court, or to reverse the presumption that the excusals were exercised\nlegitimately, simply because the trial court did not ―tell‖ its reasons in detail.\nAccordingly, as we have previously indicated, our past precedent will ―guide us\nuntil the United States Supreme Court articulates a contrary rule.‖ (Williams,\nsupra, at p. 653, fn. 21.)\n\n\n\n                                          81\n\f       Appellate review of a step three finding of nondiscriminatory intent is also\ninformed by the principle that ―the defendant‘s burden at the third stage of a\nWheeler/Batson hearing is to show the prosecutor excused prospective jurors for\ndiscriminatory reasons [citation], not merely that some of the nondiscriminatory\nreasons offered by the prosecutor are not supported by the record.‖ (People v.\nTaylor (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1801839\"><a href=\"/opinion/1801839/people-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 891 (Taylor); see People v.

Moreover, insofar as the court\ndeclined to make such a ruling, it appears to have relied on its belief that a prima\nfacie case required the showing of a ―strong likelihood‖ of discrimination.\nIntervening high court authority has held that such a standard is too demanding for\nfederal constitutional purposes.

The prosecutor\ndid so, and the trial court then made a ruling, pursuant to step three, that the\nreasons expressed were valid. Under these circumstances, we too may simply\nproceed as though this is a step three case, analyzing whether the trial court\nproperly accepted the race-neutral reasons given by the prosecutor.

Discussion.\n       Applying this analysis, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the\nrace-neutral reasons given by the prosecutor for his excusal of prospective jurors\nM.H., P.F., and L.P. We consider each challenged excusal in turn.\n\n               a. Prospective Juror M.H.\n       M.H. indicated that she was 40 years old, was single, and had no children.\nOn her juror questionnaire, M.H. stated she was for the death penalty, and she\nconfirmed that view on voir dire. When defense counsel asked whether her\nfeelings stemmed from any personal experience, she replied, ―Oh, no, no, not\npersonally. But I figure if someone came to my house and blew my family away,\nI would flip the switch. But that‘s personal, that‘s why I believe in it. But I don‘t\n— I wouldn‘t sit here and tell this young man, okay, you need it because you\nkilled somebody, I think there [are] also circumstances. But I know if it was my\nfamily, I couldn‘t honestly say that I wouldn‘t be emotional about it.‖\n       When defense counsel said that families are not the executioners, M.H.\nresponded that she agreed, and confirmed she had no personal experiences\nrelevant to the death penalty, but repeated that ―if it was me personally and my\nfamily, that‘s totally different for me.‖ When counsel asked if M.H. agreed we\ncannot have a system that allows a victim‘s family to take revenge, M.H. said,\n―Oh, definitely. I am not saying that. I think maybe you are misunderstanding\nwhat I am saying to you; are you misunderstanding me?‖\n       M.H.‘s remarks about the death penalty might be taken more than one way,\nbut they could give rise to a reasonable concern that her willingness to impose this\npunishment might be influenced by her degree of direct interest in the case. The\nprosecutor expressed this concern by suggesting M.H.‘s approval of the death\npenalty appeared to be ―personal‖ and ―emotional‖ — as in ―if it was my family,\nI could understand it‖ — rather than ―philosophical,‖ such that she could apply\n\n\n                                         83\n\fthat penalty in any appropriate case. Moreover, as the Attorney General observes,\nM.H.‘s somewhat testy exchange with defense counsel (―are you\nmisunderstanding me?‖) could also, in combination with the prosecutor‘s personal\nobservation of this prospective juror, persuade him her relative youth was a sign of\nimmaturity.\n       Defendant points out that M.H. was 40 years old, not ―in her 30‘s‖ as\nrecalled by the prosecutor. Moreover, defendant asserts, the prosecutor‘s claim\nthat M.H.‘s combination of age, unmarried status, and childlessness had not\npreviously been encountered in the jury pool was untrue. As defendant notes,\nJuror No. 12 had already disclosed on voir dire that he was 43 years old,\nunmarried, and childless. Finally, defendant urges that the prosecutor‘s\ncharacterization of M.H.‘s death penalty views was unfair; M.H. simply meant,\ndefendant asserts, that she might be emotional in her desire for the death penalty if\nher own family was involved, but could and would be fair in any case where her\ninterest was not personal.\n       As noted, however, the prosecutor was not obliged to accept this precise\ninterpretation of M.H.‘s ambiguous remarks, and he could reasonably be\nconcerned about her ability to give the death penalty fair consideration when a\nfamily member was not a victim. Moreover, even if Juror No. 12 shared some\ncharacteristics with M.H. that the prosecutor indicated were influential in excusing\nthe latter, there was one substantial difference between the two panelists — Juror\nNo. 12 expressed much stronger views in favor of the death penalty. Nothing\nindicates the prosecutor was wrong in suggesting that when M.H.‘s age, familial\nstatus, and death penalty views were considered together, she was unique among\nthe jurors who had been evaluated at the time the prosecutor excused her. Under\nthese circumstances, the record adequately supports the prosecutor‘s statement of\nrace-neutral reasons for exercising a peremptory challenge against M.H.\n\n                                         84\n\f                 b. Prospective Juror P.F.\n       P.F. declared in her questionnaire that ―[t]he death penalty is a very serious\nconsequence for committing a serious offense (murder). In order for someone to\nreceive this punishment, I believe the person must have maliciously set out to\ndestroy the life of someone else (and their loved ones), and have a history of such\nviolent behavior w/o remorse.‖ She stated her opinion that ―the death penalty is\nnot used often enough in cases where convicted felons have a repeated [behavior]\npattern for committing violent crimes against others, such as murder.‖\n       On voir dire, defense counsel indicated to P.F. his impression that she was\n―kind of a strong proponent of the death penalty but not rabid about it, you just\nthink it is appropriate sometimes?‖ P.F. answered, ―Yeah, I mean if, how to\nanswer it, if like I knew all the facts, you know, see everything, I would want to\nsay for a judgment in my mind, but based upon the facts I wouldn‘t just arbitrarily\nsay because of a particular crime, without knowing everything, what the\npunishment should be.‖\n       Later, the prosecutor asked P.F. what she meant on her questionnaire by\nstating she ―felt the death penalty would be appropriate when there was a pattern\nof violent conduct. Did you mean by that anything in particular, as far as there\nwould [have to be] a series of events, or more than one . . .?‖ P.F. answered,\n―What I had in mind wasn‘t a particular case, but like some cases, certain ones, the\nperson just had a pattern of no regard for life.‖ P.F. agreed when the prosecutor\nsuggested ―it wasn‘t something exclusive, just something you were thinking of\nthat would be a strong consideration for you?‖ She agreed again when the\nprosecutor said, ―It wasn‘t just like one system you would consider to look at; is\nthat correct?‖\n       Under these circumstances, the prosecutor‘s recall that P.F. had indicated\nthe death penalty was appropriate for a ―pattern of violent conduct‖ was not unfair.\n\n\n                                         85\n\fThough certain of P.F.‘s voir dire responses suggested she might consider the\ndeath penalty in other cases, it was reasonable for the prosecutor to be concerned\nthat she might be reluctant to do so except in cases of the most calculated and\nmalicious murder by someone who had committed similar violent acts in the past.\nThe record thus supports the sincerity of the prosecutor‘s claim that P.F.‘s\nexpressed views on the death penalty were a race-neutral reason why he used a\nperemptory challenge to excuse her.\n       Defendant insists the record does not support the prosecutor‘s assertions\nabout P.F.‘s casual dress, and her ―bored‖ and disinterested manner. As defendant\nobserves, the record indicates that P.F. was a 911 operator for the police\ndepartment. On the record, he suggests, her answers to all questions seem\nappropriate, and she appears facially to have been an ideal juror.\n       But the prosecutor‘s demeanor observations, even if not explicitly\nconfirmed by the record, are a permissible race-neutral ground for peremptory\nexcusal, especially when they were not disputed in the trial court.

But counsel simply protested that Juror No. 12,\nlike prospective juror M.H., was unmarried. There is no indication counsel sought\nto dispute the prosecutor‘s description of P.F.‘s demeanor. Indeed, when the court\nthereafter asked if the Wheeler/Batson motion was submitted, defense counsel\nreplied, ―Yes.‖\n\n\n\n                                         86\n\ffeelings are that it is important when inflicting it to make sure that the person is\nguilty beyond a shadow of a doubt before imposing it.‖\n       On voir dire, the prosecutor told L.P. that her ―shadow of a doubt‖\ncomment on her questionnaire had ―just sort of stood out,‖ and he asked her to\nexplain what she meant. L.P. replied, ―I think I said the major problem with it,\nbecause I wanted to make sure that the people were convicted beyond a shadow of\na doubt.‖ ―In other words,‖ the prosecutor suggested, ―before we consider a\npenalty as serious as this, we want to make sure we know what the facts are; is that\nwhat you are saying . . .?‖ L.P. answered, ―Yes.‖\n       Defendant insists that, in stating his reasons for excusing L.P., the\nprosecutor mischaracterized her ―shadow of a doubt‖ comment. Defendant notes\nthat L.P. made clear on voir dire she was willing to consider the death penalty so\nlong as the person was convicted beyond a shadow of a doubt. Because the\npenalty jury would be told it must accept his conviction of Officer Burt‘s murder,\ndefendant asserts, the prosecutor had no legitimate basis for concern that L.P.\nwould refuse to entertain the possibility of a death sentence in this case.\n       However, in light of L.P.‘s responses, it was reasonable for the prosecutor\nto be concerned that, for the proof of any facts pertinent to a possible death\nsentence, L.P. would insist not only on the elimination of reasonable doubt, but on\nthe removal of all doubt. Moreover, the record confirms the prosecutor‘s\nrecollection that L.P. was a social worker. The prosecutor‘s expressed reservation\nabout having social workers on the jury was race-neutral. It also had ―some basis\nin accepted trial strategy‖ (e.g., Taylor, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1801839\"><a href=\"/opinion/1801839/people-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 886) insofar as it\nstemmed from a concern about the general attitudes and philosophies persons in\nthat profession might harbor. Hence, the record affords no basis to conclude that\nthe prosecutor‘s reasons for excusing L.P. were insincere or pretextual.\n\n\n\n                                          87\n\f       Defendant urges that the trial court‘s terse ruling on the Wheeler/Batson\nmotion does not represent a ―sincere and reasoned effort‖ to assess whether the\nprosecutor‘s proffered race-neutral reasons for excusing M.H., P.F., and L.P. were\nhis true reasons. Defendant asserts that the words used by the court — i.e., that\n―no discriminatory intent is inherent in the explanations, and the reasons appear to\nbe race neutral‖ (italics added) — indicate the court addressed only the facial\nplausibility of the reasons claimed by the prosecutor, and failed to properly assess,\nunder all the relevant circumstances, whether the prosecutor‘s explanations were\ncredible.\n       However, we have made clear that ―the trial court is not required to explain\non the record its ruling on a Batson/Wheeler motion. (People v. Reynoso, supra,\n31 Cal.4th [903,] 919.) ‗When the prosecutor‘s stated reasons . . . are both\ninherently plausible and supported by the record, the trial court need not question\nthe prosecutor or make detailed findings.‘ (People v. Silva (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2551919\"><a href=\"/opinion/2551919/people-v-silva/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n386.)‖ (Vines, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844288\"><a href=\"/opinion/844288/people-v-vines/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">830</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 849.) Here, as noted, the prosecutor‘s\nreasons were plausible and, in all essential respects, supported.\n       Moreover, in arguing that the language of the trial court‘s ruling shows the\ncourt made no bona fide attempt to assess the prosecutor‘s credibility, defendant\nparses the court‘s words too closely. The court‘s assertion that no discriminatory\nintent was ―inherent‖ in the prosecutor‘s explanations is reasonably read as a\ndetermination that the court believed them to be true.\n       We further note that, while considering the Wheeler/Batson motion, the\ncourt asked for the relevant juror questionnaires, and it presumably reviewed\nthem. No reason appears to conclude the court failed to consider all the factors\nbearing on the prosecutor‘s credibility, including his demeanor, the inherent\nreasonableness or improbability of his proffered explanations, their plausible basis\nin accepted trial strategy, the court‘s own observation of the relevant jurors‘ voir\n\n                                          88\n\fdire, its experience as a trial lawyer and judge in the community, and the common\npractices of the prosecutor‘s office and the individual prosecutor himself. (E.g.,\nPeople v. Jones (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 360.) Defendant‘s Wheeler/Batson claim\nmust be rejected.\n\n       E. Claim of unreliable special circumstance and penalty verdicts.\n       Defendant urges that the trial procedures in this case denied him reliable\ndeterminations of death eligibility, and of the appropriate penalty, in violation of\nhis state and federal constitutional rights to a reliable death judgment. (U.S.\nConst., 5th, 8th, & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 15, 17.) He suggests in\ngeneral that the trial was an ―empty charade‖ due to his counsel‘s deficiencies, and\nhis own asserted incompetence to waive his rights and stand trial — claims we\nhave already considered at length and rejected on this record.\n       In particular, however, he focuses anew on two aspects of the\nproceedings — his ―slow plea‖ to the special circumstance allegation, and the\npenalty trial, at which he was permitted to present no mitigating evidence or\nargument and to give testimony inviting the jury to sentence him to death. He\nclaims that regardless of his wishes, the state was authorized, indeed required, to\noverride these decisions in order to protect the paramount public interest in\nreasoned, fair, and just death judgments, and to avoid being implicated in his\ndesire to commit state-assisted suicide. We are not persuaded.\n       As defendant observes, California has recognized limited circumstances in\nwhich, as a matter of fundamental public policy, rights and decisions that are\nnormally personal to a criminal defendant may be limited or overruled in the\nservice of death penalty reliability. Thus, a capital defendant is not permitted to\nwaive his or her automatic appeal of a death judgment. (Cal. Const., art. VI, § 11,\nsubd. (a); Pen. Code, § 1239, subd. (b); People v. Stanworth (1969) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1169901\"><a href=\"/opinion/1169901/people-v-stanworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n\n                                          89\n\f834.) Moreover, a plea of guilty to a capital felony may not be taken except in the\npresence of counsel, and with counsel‘s consent. (§ 1018.) Even if otherwise\ncompetent to exercise the constitutional right to self-representation (Faretta v.\nCalifornia (1975) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">), a defendant may not discharge his lawyer in\norder to enter such a plea over counsel‘s objection. (E.g., People v. Chadd (1981)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 747-757; see People v.

Nor did counsel agree simply to allow defendant\nto waive his trial rights for purposes of inviting a death judgment. On the\ncontrary, their consent stemmed from their express decision — one we have\ndeemed competent and reasonable under the circumstances — to preserve\ncredibility with a penalty jury in the face of overwhelming evidence that defendant\nhad gunned down a police officer during a routine traffic stop in order to eliminate\nthe victim as a witness to serious felony evidence discovered during the encounter.\n       As we have also noted, competent counsel could conclude this ―slow plea‖\nstrategy had the additional advantage of limiting the special circumstance evidence\nof the officer‘s ―lawful‖ performance of duty to the showing made at the\npreliminary hearing. Defendant thereby avoided the risk that additional evidence\non the ―lawful duty‖ issue would be presented in a trial, while preserving the right\nto urge on appeal, if necessary, that the preliminary hearing evidence was legally\ninsufficient. In turn, we have concluded that the evidence of Officer Burt‘s\n―lawful‖ performance was legally sufficient, in that a rational trier of fact,\nreviewing the evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing, could find beyond\nreasonable doubt — as the instant trial court necessarily did — that the victim was\nlawfully engaged in duty at the time he was killed. Under these circumstances, the\nfact that defendant may have had personal reasons, different from those of his\n\n\n\n                                          90\n\fcounsel, for agreeing to a ―slow plea‖ does not undermine the fundamental\nreliability of the death judgment.\n       Nor are constitutional reliability concerns raised by the fact that defendant,\nat his own insistence, presented no mitigating evidence or argument at the penalty\ntrial. ―We have stated that ‗a verdict is constitutionally reliable ―when the\nprosecution has discharged its burden of proof at the guilt and penalty phases\npursuant to the rules of evidence and within the guidelines of a constitutional\ndeath penalty statute, the death verdict has been returned under proper instructions\nand procedures, and the trier of penalty has duly considered the relevant mitigating\nevidence, if any, which the defendant has chosen to present.‖ ‘ [Citation.] Under\nthose conditions, despite a defendant‘s avowed intent not to present available\nevidence in mitigation, the state‘s interest in ensuring a reliable and fair penalty\ndetermination has been met.

(Nakahara, supra,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2598792\"><a href=\"/opinion/2598792/people-v-nakahara/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 719; Webb, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1122530\"><a href=\"/opinion/1122530/people-v-webb/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 534-535.) Though the instant\njury received no specific instruction that ― ‗despite the defendant‘s testimony,‘ ‖ it\nmust decided the appropriate penalty based upon the factors in aggravation and\nmitigation (see Webb, supra, at p. 535, fn. 29, quoting Guzman, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1181101\"><a href=\"/opinion/1181101/people-v-guzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">915</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 962), the jury was generally instructed that it must weigh the aggravating and\nmitigating evidence to determine the appropriate penalty, and should return a\ndeath verdict only if persuaded the aggravating circumstances were ―so\nsubstantial‖ in comparison to mitigation that death was warranted. Jurors were\n\n\n\n\n                                          91\n\falso told not to be swayed by bias against the defendant, that the listed aggravating\nfactors were exclusive,29 and that defendant‘s ―behavior‖ in the courtroom could\nbe considered only to rebut mitigating evidence of remorse if any such evidence\nwas offered. No basis for reversal appears.\n\n       F. Challenges to California death penalty statute and instructions.\n       Defendant raises numerous challenges to California‘s death penalty statute,\nand to the standard instructions given at his penalty trial. We have rejected the\nidentical claims on many occasions, and defendant fails to persuade us that these\ndecisions should be reconsidered.\n       Thus, we reaffirm that ―the death penalty statute is not unconstitutional\nbecause it does not require ‗unanimity as to the truth of aggravating\ncircumstances, or findings beyond a reasonable doubt that an aggravating\ncircumstance (other than § 190.3, factor (b) or (c) evidence) has been proved, that\nthe aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors, or that death is the\nappropriate sentence.‘ [Citation.] Nothing in Cunningham v.

(E.g., Vines, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844288\"><a href=\"/opinion/844288/people-v-vines/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">830</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 891; People v.

Section 190.3, factor (a), which allows the jury to\nconsider the circumstances of the capital crime in aggravation, is not\nimpermissibly overbroad and does not lead to arbitrary or capricious imposition of\nthe death penalty.

In this opinion, I show how this unwarranted deference results in judicial\ninquiry that falls short of what is required in a proper Batson analysis. I also trace\nthe origins of our erroneous doctrine and discuss the unfair and counterproductive\nconsequences of our approach. For some time now, our jurisprudence has not\ndemanded that trial courts or reviewing courts demonstrate a truly reasoned effort\nto evaluate Batson claims in light of all relevant circumstances bearing on the\nissue of purposeful discrimination. And the results, which I document in another\nopinion filed today, are quite remarkable: In the 102 cases where this court has\naddressed a Batson claim over the past 20 years, we have found Batson error only\nonce — and that was 12 years ago. (See People v. Harris (Aug. 26, 2013,\nS081700) __ Cal.4th __, __ [at pp. 33–34, 42–44] (conc. opn. of Liu, J.).)\n       Because high court precedent has consistently recognized the manifold\nharms of racial discrimination in jury selection and has accordingly required more\ncareful and thorough inquiry than our case law provides, I respectfully disagree\nwith the deferential framework that this court continues to apply in reviewing\nunexplained Batson rulings on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                                          I.\n       Reciting our precedent, today‘s opinion says: ― ‗ ―Review of a trial court‘s\ndenial of a Wheeler/Batson motion is deferential, examining only whether\nsubstantial evidence supports its conclusions.

So far so good: Deference is appropriate where the trial\ncourt makes ―a sincere and reasoned effort‖ to evaluate the prosecutor‘s stated\nreasons for striking a minority juror.\n       I have no doubt the trial court in this case was sincere. But the record\nprovides no basis for us to conclude that the trial court made a reasoned effort to\nanalyze the prosecutor‘s explanations for the strikes. There is no reasoning in the\ntrial court‘s statement that ―no discriminatory intent is inherent in the\nexplanations, and the reasons appear to be race neutral.‖ Moreover, when defense\ncounsel noted that ―[Juror No. 12] is also unmarried‖ in response to the\nprosecutor‘s assertion that he struck prospective juror M.H. in part because\n―[M.H.] is single,‖ the trial court was ―[a]pparently confused by counsel‘s remark‖\nand did not probe the comparison. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 79; see People v. Lenix\n(2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2584741\"><a href=\"/opinion/2584741/people-v-lenix/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 624 (Lenix) [trial courts are best positioned to consider\ncomparative juror analysis].) Taken at face value, the trial court‘s mere\nobservation that ―no discriminatory intent is inherent in the explanations, and the\n\n                                           4\n\freasons appear to be race neutral‖ (italics added) does not address whether the\nrace-neutral reasons given by the prosecutor were the actual reasons motivating\nthe strikes. The inquiry at Batson‘s third stage requires more than a determination\nof inherent or apparent plausibility; it ―requires the judge to assess the plausibility\nof [the prosecutor‘s stated] reason in light of all evidence with a bearing on it.‖\n(Miller-El, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 252.) Nothing in the record shows that the trial\ncourt conducted the requisite inquiry.\n       Today‘s opinion attempts to fill the gap in two ways. First, it says the trial\ncourt‘s ―assertion that no discriminatory intent was ‗inherent‘ in the prosecutor‘s\nexplanations is reasonably read as a determination that the court believed them to\nbe true.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 87.) But that reading of the word ―inherent‖ is as\nstrained as it is ironic in light of this court‘s own usage of the word in this context.\n(See Williams, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 653 [a prosecutor‘s explanation is\n―inherently plausible‖ if it is ― ‗not inherently implausible‘ ‖].) Further, right after\nthe trial court used the word ―inherent,‖ it said ―the reasons appear to be race\nneutral‖ (italics added). If the trial court had made a determination that the\nprosecutor‘s reasons were in fact true, why didn‘t it just say so and provide its\nanalysis instead of using doubly qualified, conclusory language? It is this court\nthat ―parses the [trial] court‘s words too closely‖ (maj. opn., ante, at p. 87) instead\nof giving them their plain meaning.\n       Second, today‘s opinion says the trial ―court asked for the relevant juror\nquestionnaires, and it presumably reviewed them. No reason appears to conclude\nthe court failed to consider all the factors bearing on the prosecutor‘s credibility,\nincluding his demeanor, the inherent reasonableness or improbability of his\nproffered explanations, their plausible basis in accepted trial strategy, the court‘s\nown observation of the relevant jurors‘ voir dire, its experience as a trial lawyer\nand judge in the community, and the common practices of the prosecutor‘s office\n\n                                           5\n\fand the individual prosecutor himself.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 87–88.

There is a wide\nchasm, however, between the absence of reasons to conclude that the trial court\ndid not conduct a proper Batson analysis and the presence of reasons to conclude\nthat it did. (See Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at p. 479 [reviewing court may not credit\njuror demeanor as the reason for a strike where the trial court made no ―specific\nfinding on the record concerning [the juror‘s] demeanor‖ and ―simply allowed the\nchallenge without explanation‖].) If a reviewing court can simply fill the void\nwith a massive pile of presumptions, then we can be assured that many trial courts\nwill continue to deny Batson claims without reasoned explanation. Indeed, we\nmight as well dispense with appellate review in such cases since it is so easy to\nrationalize a silent record with a cacophony of presumptions.\n       The court knows we cannot actually do this under Miller-El and Snyder, so\nits real answer to the problem of unexplained Batson rulings is the following: ―we\nhave made clear that ‗the trial court is not required to explain on the record its\nruling on a Batson/Wheeler motion. (People v. Reynoso [(2003)] 31 Cal.4th [903,]\n919.) ―When the prosecutor‘s stated reasons . . . are both inherently plausible and\nsupported by the record, the trial court need not question the prosecutor or make\ndetailed findings.‖ (People v.

The discussion in part II below excavates the tenuous origins of this rule\nin our Batson jurisprudence. Here I focus on how our application of the rule\ndilutes the proper inquiry at Batson‘s third step.\n       The problem, in a nutshell, is this: Our court routinely holds that so long as\nthe prosecutor‘s stated reason for striking a minority juror is (1) inherently\nplausible and (2) supported by the record, we must presume that the trial court‘s\ndenial of a Batson motion, even if rendered without any explicit findings or\nanalysis, was premised on a full inquiry into all the relevant circumstances bearing\non the credibility of the prosecutor‘s explanation. That presumption, in turn,\nentitles the trial court‘s ruling to deference on appeal. But to say that a\nprosecutor‘s stated reason is inherently plausible is only to say that it is ―not\n‗inherently implausible.‘ ‖ (Williams, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 653.) That is a far\ncry from evaluating whether the stated reason was likely the actual reason for a\nparticular strike given the totality of relevant circumstances. And to say that a\nprosecutor‘s stated reason is ―supported by the record‖ is only to say that there is\nsome evidence to support the reason or (in an even weaker formulation) that the\nstated reason is not contradicted by the record. (People v. Reynoso (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2625319\"><a href=\"/opinion/2625319/people-v-reynoso/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">903</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 929 (Reynoso).) Again, that is a far cry from inquiring, based on all\nrelevant circumstances, how likely it is that the stated reason was the actual reason\nfor the strike. The Batson inquiry ultimately requires an assessment of\nlikelihoods; it is the defendant‘s burden to prove that ―it was more likely than not\nthat the challenge was improperly motivated.‖ (Johnson, supra, 545 U.S. at\np. 170.) An explanation can be plausible without being likely, and an explanation\ncan be supported by some evidence or uncontradicted by the record without being\nlikely based on the totality of relevant circumstances. I do not see how the fact\n\n                                           7\n\fthat a proffered reason is inherently plausible and supported by the record enables\nus to presume that the trial court actually reached a decision as to whether it was\nmore likely than not that the proffered reason was pretextual in light of all relevant\ncircumstances.\n       This analytical gap and related errors are apparent in several aspects of\ntoday‘s opinion. Consider the court‘s discussion of the strike against prospective\njuror M.H. On her juror questionnaire, M.H. indicated that she was a 40-year-old\ncomputer consultant with a bachelor‘s degree in math and computer science. She\nwas single and had no children. She had formed no opinions about the present\ncase and expressed no hesitations about her ability to follow the court‘s\ninstructions and serve as an impartial juror. When asked for her general feelings\nabout the death penalty, M.H. wrote ―I am for the death penalty.‖ When asked\nwhether the death penalty has been given too often, too seldom, or randomly,\nM.H. wrote ―I feel the death penalty has been used appropriately. Especially\ngiven that some of the defendants have spent years on death row.‖ M.H. further\nindicated that her views on the death penalty had not changed in the last few years.\nM.H. did not support or belong to any victim rights groups; she did not belong to\nany group advocating either abolition or increased use of the death penalty; she\ndid not have any close friends or relatives who had been arrested or convicted of a\ncrime. M.H. said her views on capital punishment would not cause her to\nautomatically vote for or against the death penalty without considering the\naggravating and mitigating evidence presented.\n       At voir dire, when defense counsel asked whether her support for the death\npenalty stemmed from ―some experience of your own,‖ M.H. said: ―Oh, no, no,\nnot personally. But I figure if someone came to my house and blew my family\naway, I would flip the switch. But that‘s personal, that‘s why I believe in it. But I\ndon‘t — I wouldn‘t sit here and tell this young man, okay, you need it because you\n\n                                          8\n\fkilled somebody, I think there [are] also circumstances. But I know if it was my\nfamily, I couldn‘t honestly say that I wouldn‘t be emotional about it.‖ On further\nquestioning, M.H. confirmed she had no personal experiences related to the death\npenalty but again said ―if it was me personally and my family, that‘s totally\ndifferent for me.‖\n       The prosecutor gave the following explanation for striking M.H.: ―[M.H.]\nis single. She has no children. She is younger than the juror I prefer. She is in her\n30‘s. She is also, her attitude regarding the death penalty was personal and\nemotional, not philosophical. She was the one who talked about, if it was my\nfamily I could understand it. But primarily the reason [is] she is young, single and\nno children. There [are] no other jurors on the jury presently who fit that pattern.‖\n       In assessing the prosecutor‘s explanation, today‘s opinion says that M.H.‘s\nstatements at voir dire ―could give rise to a reasonable concern that her willingness\nto impose this punishment might be influenced by her degree of direct interest in\nthe case‖ (maj. opn., ante, at p. 82) and that the prosecutor ―could reasonably be\nconcerned about her ability to give the death penalty fair consideration when a\nfamily member was not a victim‖ (id. at p. 83). The word ―could‖ makes it hard to\ndisagree insofar as one cannot say that the court‘s posited reading of M.H.‘s\nremarks is entirely implausible. But even if plausible, is it likely that a reasonable\nperson would have understood M.H.‘s statements that way? M.H. clearly stated\nthat her support for the death penalty was unrelated to any personal experience\n(―Oh, no, no, not personally‖). She wrote on her questionnaire that ―I am for the\ndeath penalty‖ and that her view had not changed in the last few years. She\nfurther indicated that ―I feel the death penalty has been used appropriately.\nEspecially given that some of the defendants have spent years on death row.‖ It\ndoes not seem likely that a person familiar with M.H.‘s questionnaire and her full\nanswers at voir dire would have understood her support for the death penalty to be,\n\n                                          9\n\fas the prosecutor put it, ―personal and emotional, not philosophical.‖ M.H.‘s\nremarks simply conveyed that she would have an emotional reaction if her family\nwere murdered (―I would flip the switch‖), not that she did not support or could\nnot apply the death penalty in other circumstances.\n       The court attempts to buttress the prosecutor‘s explanation with the\nfollowing statement: ―Moreover, as the Attorney General observes, M.H.‘s\nsomewhat testy exchange with defense counsel (‗are you misunderstanding me?‘)\ncould also, in combination with the prosecutor‘s personal observation of this\nprospective juror, persuade him her relative youth was a sign of immaturity.‖\n(Maj. opn., ante, at p. 83.) But the inclusion of this sentence in the court‘s Batson\nanalysis is wrong on two counts. First, the prosecutor said one reason he struck\nM.H. was that ―she is young‖ and ―younger than the juror I prefer.‖ The\nprosecutor said nothing about ―immaturity.‖ The prosecutor might have treated\nyouth as a proxy for liberal views, compassion for criminal defendants, or\nsomething else. We do not know what underlies the prosecutor‘s preference, and\nneither the Attorney General nor this court may shore up a reason that the\nprosecutor actually gave with a reason he did not give. (See Miller-El, supra, 545\nU.S. at p. 252 [―[A] prosecutor simply has got to state his reasons as best he can\nand stand or fall on the plausibility of the reasons he gives. . . . If the stated reason\ndoes not hold up, its pretextual significance does not fade because a trial judge, or\nan appeals court, can imagine a reason that might not have been shown up as\nfalse.‖].) Second, under Snyder, we have no basis to credit ―the prosecutor‘s\npersonal observation of this prospective juror‖ (maj. opn., ante, at p. 83) as part of\nthe basis for the strike because ―the record does not show that the trial judge\nactually made a determination concerning [M.H.‘s] demeanor.‖ (Snyder, supra,\n552 U.S. at p. 479.)\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\f       Moreover, the court dismisses the import of comparing M.H. to Juror No.\n12 on the ground that ―Juror No. 12 expressed much stronger views in favor of the\ndeath penalty. Nothing indicates the prosecutor was wrong in suggesting that\nwhen M.H.‘s age, familial status, and death penalty views were considered\ntogether, she was unique among the jurors who had been evaluated at the time the\nprosecutor excused her.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 83.) But recall what the\nprosecutor actually said in striking M.H.: ―[M.H.] is single. She has no children.\nShe is younger than the juror I prefer. She is in her 30‘s. She is also, her attitude\nregarding the death penalty was personal and emotional, not philosophical. She\nwas the one who talked about, if it was my family I could understand it. But\nprimarily the reason [is] she is young, single and no children. There [are] no other\njurors on the jury presently who fit that pattern.‖ The prosecutor begins with his\nconcern that M.H. is young (she was actually 40, not ―in her 30‘s‖), single, and\nwithout children. He then discusses M.H.‘s death penalty views. At the end, he\npivots and prioritizes his opening concern: ―But primarily the reason [is] she is\nyoung, single and no children. There [are] no other jurors on the jury presently\nwho fit that pattern.‖ (Italics added.) It may be possible to construe ―that pattern‖\nto encompass M.H.‘s death penalty views in addition to her age and familial\nstatus. But again, even if such an interpretation is plausible, is it likely that that is\nwhat the prosecutor meant? When the prosecutor‘s last two sentences are read\ntogether, the most natural understanding of his assertion that ―There [are] no other\njurors on the jury presently who fit that pattern‖ is that he believed no other jurors\nwere ―young, single and no children.‖ And on this point, the record shows that\ntwo seated jurors close in age to M.H. were single and without children: Juror No.\n1 (age 45) and Juror No. 12 (age 43).\n       Even if we were to fold in the prosecutor‘s comments about M.H.‘s death\npenalty views as part of ―that pattern,‖ we would have to acknowledge, as\n\n                                           11\n\fdiscussed above, that those comments offer an unlikely (even if plausible)\nrendition of the views she expressed. And once that is acknowledged, it seems\ndoubtful to say that ―Juror No. 12 expressed much stronger views in favor of the\ndeath penalty‖ than M.H. did. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 83.) As to his general\nfeelings about the death penalty, Juror No. 12 wrote on his questionnaire ―I‘m for\nit,‖ whereas M.H. wrote ―I am for the death penalty.‖ Juror No. 12 indicated he\nfelt the death penalty is used ―too seldom‖ and noted ―too many appeals that take\ntoo long‖; M.H. said ―I feel the death penalty has been used appropriately.\nEspecially given that some of the defendants have spent years on death row.‖\nJuror No. 12 qualified his views by indicating that ―if court proved to me that\ndefendant should be spared death – I might not vote death.‖ Further, he noted that\nhis ability to serve as an impartial juror might be affected if ―defendant said he‘d\nfound God and should be spared for that reason.‖ On her questionnaire, M.H. did\nnot qualify her support for the death penalty in any way. The principal difference\nbetween Juror No. 12 and M.H. is that Juror No. 12 wrote on his questionnaire that\nhis cousin-in-law was a fireman who had tried to save the murder victim and that\nhe had already formed an opinion that defendant deserved the death penalty. But\nwe can hardly cite Juror No. 12‘s preconception about this case (as distinct from\nhis views about the death penalty in general) as a proper basis for differentiating\nhim from M.H., since we have upheld the trial court‘s refusal to excuse Juror No.\n12 for cause on the ground that during voir dire he ―consistently indicated that he\ncould and would subordinate his views, carefully weigh and consider the\naggravating and mitigating evidence as instructed, vote for either death or life\nwithout parole as appropriate, and sit fairly in accordance with the juror‘s oath.‖\n(Maj. opn., ante, at p. 76.) Whether there were other differences between Juror\nNo. 12 and M.H. is something we do not know because the trial court, despite\ndefense counsel‘s prompting, did not conduct a comparative juror analysis.\n\n                                         12\n\f       In the end, the court finds only that ―the prosecutor‘s reasons were\nplausible and, in all essential respects, supported‖ (maj. opn., ante, at p. 87)\nbecause that is enough under our precedent to entitle the trial court‘s unexplained\nBatson ruling to deference on appeal. As shown above, this approach cannot be\nreconciled with the high court‘s mandate that ―in considering a Batson objection,\nor in reviewing a ruling claimed to be Batson error, all of the circumstances that\nbear upon the issue of racial animosity must be consulted.‖ (Snyder, supra, 552\nU.S. at p. 478, citing Miller-El, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 239; see Batson, supra, 476\nU.S. at p. 94.) Tellingly, today‘s opinion nowhere actually says that the trial court\nor this court has independently determined, based on all relevant circumstances,\nthat it was not more likely than not that the prosecutor‘s strikes of the three black\nprospective jurors were motivated by race. As in Williams, our decision today\nresults in ―the denial of defendant‘s Batson claim despite the fact that no court,\ntrial or appellate, has ever conducted a proper Batson analysis.‖ (Williams, supra,\n56 Cal.4th at p. 700 (dis. opn. of Liu, J.).)\n                                           II.\n       Although the legal shortcuts that pervade the Batson analysis in today‘s\nopinion are troubling, the reality is that habits of unwarranted deference,\nspeculative inference, and overreliance on gap-filling presumptions have been\nentrenched in our Batson jurisprudence for some time now. As I discuss in People\nv. Harris (Aug. 26, 2013, S081700) __ Cal.4th __, __ [at pp. 33–34] (Harris)\n(conc. opn. of Liu, J.), also filed today, this court has found only one instance of\nunlawful discrimination in jury selection among the 102 cases that have raised\nBatson claims over the past 20 years, and none among the 59 cases that postdate\nMiller-El. This improbable record is attributable, at least in part, to the erroneous\nlegal framework that we continue to apply in evaluating Batson claims. In Harris,\nI discuss the problematic development of our case law on what is required to\n\n                                           13\n\festablish an inference of discrimination at Batson‘s first step. (Harris, at pp. __–\n__ [at pp. 24–28] (conc. opn. of Liu, J.).) Here I trace the development of our\nerroneous rule of deference at Batson‘s third step.\n                                          A.\n       The deferential approach we apply to unexplained Batson rulings was not\nalways a part of our law.

We did not clearly define what a trial court must do in order to demonstrate\nthat it had made this inquiry, nor did we connect a trial court‘s failure to conduct\nthis inquiry with the level of deference owed on appeal. But we did suggest that a\ntrial court must undertake more than a summary denial if there was some basis for\nquestioning the prosecutor‘s reasons. In Hall, we evaluated the prosecutor‘s\nexplanations and found that some were ―suggestive of bias‖ and ―demanded\nfurther inquiry on the part of the trial court.‖ (Id. at pp. 168–169.) ―Yet the trial\ncourt apparently considered itself bound to accept all of the prosecutor‘s\nexplanations at face value, expressing the view that group bias is shown only when\na prosecutor declares an intent to exclude all members of an ethnic group from the\njury.

The trial court in Turner had denied defendant‘s Batson motion without\ncomment. We observed that ―the prosecutor‘s explanations were either\nimplausible or suggestive of bias. They therefore ‗demanded further inquiry on\nthe part of the trial court‘ ([Hall] at p. 169), followed by a ‗sincere and reasoned‘\neffort by the court to evaluate their genuineness and sufficiency in light of all the\ncircumstances of the trial (id., at p. 167, italics added). Each step is ‗imperative, if\nthe constitutional guarantee is to have real meaning‘ (ibid.). [¶] We conclude that\n. . . the prosecution failed to sustain its burden of showing that the challenged\nprospective jurors were not excluded because of group bias [citation], and as in\nHall the court failed to discharge its duty to inquire into and carefully evaluate the\nexplanations offered by the prosecutor [citation].‖ (Turner, at p. 728.)

An early sign of erosion of\nHall‘s ―sincere and reasoned‖ evaluation requirement appeared in People v.\nJohnson (1989) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1247657\"><a href=\"/opinion/1247657/people-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, where a divided court accorded deference to the\ntrial court‘s summary and unexplained ruling even though there was some reason\nto question the prosecutor‘s reasons. Justice Mosk, joined by Justice Broussard,\nobserved in dissent that the trial court, instead of actually inquiring into the\nprosecutor‘s explanations, simply said that the prosecutor had stated his reasons\nfor striking eight minority jurors and then ―continued its oral ruling with a\nrambling statement‖ at best implying that the stated reasons were facially neutral,\nnot that they were ―bona fide.‖ (Id. at pp. 1289–1290 (dis. opn. of Mosk, J.).) But\nthe court, after criticizing the dissent for engaging in comparative juror analysis\nand for questioning the plausibility of some of the prosecution‘s explanations,\nemphasized the deference owed to the trial court: ―Here an experienced trial judge\nsaw and heard the entire voir dire proceedings by which defendant‘s jury was\nselected. The record indicates he was aware of his duty under Wheeler to be\nsensitive to the manner in which peremptory challenges were used. He found no\n\n                                          16\n\fimproper use of the peremptory challenges by the prosecutor. Under these\ncircumstances we see no good reason to second-guess his factual determination.‖\n(Id. at p. 1221.)\n       Thereafter, the court cited People v. Johnson in two cases upholding what\nwere essentially summary denials of Batson claims. People v. Cummings (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1130834\"><a href=\"/opinion/1130834/people-v-cummings/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1233</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> explained that ―[t]he prosecutor offered adequate justification,\nunrelated to group bias, for the exercise of peremptory challenges. [Citations.] It\nwas not necessary for the court to make additional inquiry. There is no basis in\nthe record for the assertion that the court failed to scrutinize the prosecutor‘s\nreasons to determine if they were pretextual.‖ (Id. at p. 1282.) And the court in\nPeople v. Jackson (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1205550\"><a href=\"/opinion/1205550/people-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1164</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> said that ―Wheeler does not require the\ntrial court to conduct further inquiry into the prosecutor‘s race-neutral\nexplanations if, as here, it is satisfied from its observations that any or all of them\nare proper.‖ (Id. at p. 1198.)\n       The court in Silva attempted to reconcile cases like Johnson, Cummings,\nand Jackson with Hall‘s ―sincere and reasoned‖ evaluation requirement as well as\nthe requirement that the trial court ―clearly express[] its findings and rulings and\nthe bases therefor‖ (Fuentes, supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 716, fn. 5). On its facts, Silva\nwas a straightforward case. The prosecutor all but announced at the outset of jury\nselection that he planned to discriminate on the basis of race because a previous\nhung jury in the penalty phase had divided on racial lines. (Silva, supra, 25\nCal.4th at pp. 375–376.) He struck five Hispanic jurors and, when asked to\nexplain, gave reasons that were directly contradicted by the record. (Id. at\npp. 379–381.) The trial court nevertheless denied the defendant‘s motion without\nprobing ―the obvious gap‖ between the prosecutor‘s reasons and the record. (Id. at\np. 385.) This court reversed the death verdict. (Id. at p. 386.)\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\f       In a critical paragraph, the court in Silva said: ―Although we generally\n‗accord great deference to the trial court‘s ruling that a particular reason is\ngenuine,‘ we do so only when the trial court has made a sincere and reasoned\nattempt to evaluate each stated reason as applied to each challenged juror.\n[Citations.]‖ (Silva, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 385–386.) This principle, echoing\nFuentes and Hall, was the ground on which Silva was decided. (See Silva, at\npp. 385 [―On this record, we are unable to conclude that the trial court met its\nobligations to make ‗a sincere and reasoned attempt to evaluate the prosecutor‘s\nexplanation‘ ([Hall, supra, 35 Cal.3d at pp. 167–168]) and to clearly express its\nfindings ([Fuentes, supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 716, fn. 5]).‖].) However, the court in\nSilva went on to add the following two sentences: ―When the prosecutor‘s stated\nreasons are both inherently plausible and supported by the record, the trial court\nneed not question the prosecutor or make detailed findings. But when the\nprosecutor‘s stated reasons are either unsupported by the record, inherently\nimplausible, or both, more is required of the trial court than a global finding that\nthe reasons appear sufficient.‖ (Silva, at p. 386.) The second of these two\nsentences addressed the circumstances in Silva. The first sentence, however, was\ndicta; the court had no occasion in Silva to decide what inquiry or findings a trial\ncourt must make when a prosecutor‘s stated reasons are inherently plausible and\nsupported by the record. Nevertheless, these two sentences have come to\ncomprise the rule that crucially qualifies the trial court‘s obligation to make a\nsincere and reasoned attempt to evaluate the prosecutor‘s explanations at Batson‘s\nthird stage.\n       Two years later, the court in Reynoso turned Silva‘s dicta into doctrine. In\nthat case involving two Hispanic defendants, the prosecutor exercised only four\nperemptory challenges, the last two of which were directed at the only two\nHispanic prospective jurors then on the panel. (Reynoso, supra, 31 Cal.4th at\n\n                                          18\n\fp. 909.) After the trial court found that the defense had established a prima facie\ncase of discrimination, the prosecutor explained that he struck one of the two\nHispanic panelists, Elizabeth G., because she was a ― ‗customer service\nrepresentative‘ ‖ and therefore ― ‗did not have enough educational experience,‘ ‖\nand because ― ‗[i]t seemed like [Elizabeth G.] was not paying attention to the\nproceedings and . . . that she was not involved in the process.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 911.)\nThe trial court immediately ruled as follows: ― ‗And I accept those reasons as\nbeing not based upon race or ethnicity. And I don‘t find that there has been a\nviolation of Wheeler and that the — there was not a systematic exclusion of a\nrecognized ethnic group, i.e., Hispanics in this case. So the motion is denied.‘ ‖\n(Ibid.) Defense counsel then argued that nothing in Elizabeth G.‘s demeanor\njustified the strike. (Id. at pp. 911–912.) The trial court did not comment further\nexcept to note that the defense had also struck one Hispanic panelist. (Id. at\npp. 912–913.)\n       This court, in a four-to-three decision, upheld the trial court‘s ruling. While\nacknowledging that a trial court ― ‗must ―make a sincere and reasoned attempt to\nevaluate the prosecutor‘s explanation . . . .‖ (People v. Hall (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1122679\"><a href=\"/opinion/1122679/people-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n167–168)‘ [Citation],‖ the court in Reynoso said that ―in fulfilling that obligation,\nthe trial court is not required to make specific or detailed comments for the record\nto justify every instance in which a prosecutor‘s race-neutral reason for exercising\na peremptory challenge is being accepted by the court as genuine. This is\nparticularly true where the prosecutor‘s race-neutral reason for exercising a\nperemptory challenge is based on the prospective juror‘s demeanor, or similar\nintangible factors, while in the courtroom.‖ (Reynoso, supra, 31 Cal.4th at\np. 919.) The court went on to highlight the dicta from Silva that ― ‗[w]hen the\nprosecutor’s stated reasons are both inherently plausible and supported by the\nrecord, the trial court need not question the prosecutor or make detailed\n\n                                          19\n\ffindings.‘ ‖ (Reynoso, at p. 923, quoting Silva, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 386, italics\nadded by Reynoso.)\n       The court then determined that the trial court had satisfied its obligations\nand that its ruling was entitled to deference. The court acknowledged that the\nprosecutor‘s first reason for striking Elizabeth G. — her lack of ― ‗educational\nexperience‘ ‖ — was ―of questionable persuasiveness,‖ at least ―when viewed\nobjectively.‖ (Reynoso, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 924.) But her ―answers to the\ngeneral questions‖ did confirm that she worked as customer service representative.\n(Ibid.) Noting that she also had ―no prior jury experience and no past contact with\nthe criminal justice system‖ — facts not mentioned by the prosecutor in explaining\nthis strike — the court concluded that a prosecutor ―arguably could conclude in\nsincerity‖ that a prospective juror like Elizabeth G. ―would not be the best type of\njuror for the case.‖ (Id. at pp. 924–925.) The court justified this conclusion with\nadditional speculation: ―Such a determination might be further supported by a\nmyriad of factors readily observable by those present in the courtroom, but not by\nthose who are reviewing the case from a cold transcribed record on appeal.‖ (Id.\nat p. 925.)\n       As to the prosecutor‘s second reason for striking Elizabeth G. — that she\nappeared inattentive — the court acknowledged that ―the trial court made no\nattempt to clarify or probe the prosecutor‘s reasons for finding Elizabeth G.‘s\ndemeanor while in the jury box unsuited to jury service.‖ (Reynoso, supra, 31\nCal.4th at p. 926.) ―But,‖ the court said, ―the trial court did expressly accept the\nprosecutor‘s race-neutral reasons for the peremptory challenge to Elizabeth G.,\nfinding them sincere and genuine. Since the trial court was in the best position to\nobserve the prospective jurors‘ demeanor and the manner in which the prosecutor\nexercised his peremptory challenges, the implied finding, that the prosecutor‘s\nreasons for excusing Elizabeth G., including the demeanor-based reason, were\n\n                                          20\n\fsincere and genuine, is entitled to ‗great deference‘ on appeal. [Citations.]‖ (Ibid.,\nitalics added.) The court added that it found nothing ―in the record to directly\ncontradict‖ the trial court‘s ruling and noted that the prosecutor accepted the jury\n―14 times with Elizabeth G. seated in the jury box.‖ (Ibid.)\n       Reynoso went on to state the following rule, which is now boilerplate\nlanguage in our case law: ―Where . . . the trial court is fully apprised of the nature\nof the defense challenge to the prosecutor‘s exercise of a particular peremptory\nchallenge, where the prosecutor‘s reasons for excusing the juror are neither\ncontradicted by the record nor inherently implausible (Silva, supra, 25 Cal.4th at\np. 386), and where nothing in the record is in conflict with the usual presumptions\nto be drawn, i.e., that all peremptory challenges have been exercised in a\nconstitutional manner, and that the trial court has properly made a sincere and\nreasoned evaluation of the prosecutor‘s reasons for exercising his peremptory\nchallenges, then those presumptions may be relied upon, and a Batson/Wheeler\nmotion denied, notwithstanding that the record does not contain detailed findings\nregarding the reasons for the exercise of each such peremptory challenge.‖\n(Reynoso, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 929.)\n       Justice Kennard, joined by Justice Werdegar and Justice Moreno, dissented.\nJustice Kennard observed that in ―[b]rushing . . . aside‖ the fact that the trial court\nhad ruled on the Batson motion without questioning the prosecutor, making\nparticularized findings, stating the proper legal standard, or addressing the factual\ndisputes raised by the defense, the court had ―indulge[d] a presumption that both\nthe prosecutor and the trial court acted properly, thereby adopting a standard of\nappellate review that effectively insulates discriminatory strikes from meaningful\nscrutiny at both the trial and appellate stages.‖ (Reynoso, supra, 31 Cal.4th p. 930\n(dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) According to Justice Kennard, the prosecutor‘s\nreliance on Elizabeth G.‘s employment as a customer service representative was\n\n                                          21\n\fthe sort of implausible explanation that required further investigation and explicit\nfindings, and the trial court made no effort to resolve the disputed claim that\nElizabeth G. had not been paying attention. (Id. at pp. 931–932). ―Appellate\ndeference is unwarranted where, as here, the record supplies many reasons to\ndoubt that the trial court even made a credibility determination, much less a\ndetermination resulting from a sincere and reasoned effort.‖ (Id. at p. 935.)\n       Justice Moreno authored a separate dissent joined by Justice Kennard and\nJustice Werdegar. After observing that the record did not support either of the\nprosecutor‘s stated reasons for striking Elizabeth G. (Reynoso, supra, 31 Cal.4th at\npp. 940–942 (dis. opn. of Moreno, J.)), Justice Moreno concluded: ―Whereas\nSilva held that a trial court‘s obligation to inquire was triggered by a race-neutral\nexcuse unsupported by the record, the majority today holds that such an obligation\nis triggered only where such an excuse is contradicted by the record. However,\nwhere the unexamined race-neutral excuse belies common sense or is contradicted\nby defense counsel, we cannot presume that the prosecutor has exercised the\nperemptory challenge in a constitutional manner.‖ (Id. at p. 943; see id. at p. 940\n[―today, without a sound basis in logic or law, a majority of this court elevates\nSilva‘s ‗unsupported by the record‘ standard to a much stricter ‗contradicted by\nthe record‘ standard‖].)\n       The rule set forth in Reynoso, which departed in essential respects from\nSilva, Fuentes, and Hall, effectively put this court on a glide path toward affirming\nunexplained trial court rulings denying Batson motions. As demonstrated by our\nrepeated quotation and application of Reynoso‘s rule in case after case, it has been\neasy for the court to find a prosecutor‘s stated reasons to be inherently plausible\nand either supported or not contradicted by the record, and then to defer to the trial\ncourt‘s ruling on that basis.

Contrary to\nReynoso, the high court in Snyder squarely held that a reviewing court may not\naccept a prosecutor‘s demeanor-based explanation for striking a minority juror in\nthe absence of a trial court finding as to the juror‘s demeanor, at least where\ndefense counsel has disputed the issue. (See Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at p. 479\n[―Rather than making a specific finding on the record concerning Mr. Brooks‘\ndemeanor, the trial judge simply allowed the challenge without explanation. . . .\n[W]e cannot presume that the trial judge credited the prosecutor‘s assertion that\nMr. Brooks was nervous.‖].)\n       More broadly, Miller-El and Snyder elucidate by example the careful and\nthorough inquiry required at Batson‘s third step, and those decisions make clear\nthat the totality of circumstances relevant to evaluating the credibility of a\nprosecutor‘s stated reasons for striking a minority juror includes comparative juror\nanalysis. (See Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at pp. 479–485; Miller-El, supra, 545 U.S.\nat pp. 240–266.) Our precedent indulges the presumption that a trial court has\nconducted this rigorous inquiry, despite no indication in the record that it did, so\nlong as the prosecutor‘s stated reason is inherently plausible and not contradicted\nby the record. However, by packing into a presumption the entire inquiry into ―the\nplausibility of [the prosecutor‘s stated] reason in light of all evidence with a\nbearing on it‖ (Miller-El, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 252), we have ―adopt[ed] a\nstandard of appellate review that effectively insulates discriminatory strikes from\nmeaningful scrutiny at both the trial and appellate stages.‖ (Reynoso, supra, 31\n\n                                          23\n\fCal.4th p. 930 (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) Our rule of deference to summary\nBatson rulings all but assumes the answer to the question that Batson analysis is\ndesigned to address.\n       As today‘s opinion demonstrates, the application of this rule of deference\ntends to foster judicial rationalization of a prosecutor‘s strikes in a manner that\nBatson does not permit. It is all too tempting for a reviewing court, in speculating\non the possible dynamics in the courtroom, to posit reasons in support of a trial\ncourt‘s Batson ruling that the prosecutor did not give. As noted, the court in this\ncase relies on a four-word comment by M.H. to defense counsel (―are you\nmisunderstanding me?‖) to suggest that the prosecutor may have struck M.H.\nbecause ―her relative youth was a sign of immaturity,‖ even though the prosecutor\ncited only M.H.‘s youth, not her immaturity, as a reason for the strike. (Maj. opn.,\nante, at p. 83; see ante, at pp. 9–10.) And in Reynoso, the court reasoned that the\nfact that Elizabeth G. had ―no prior jury experience‖ and ―no prior contact with the\ncriminal justice system‖ could support the sincerity of the prosecutor‘s strike, even\nthough the prosecutor never mentioned those aspects of Elizabeth G.‘s background\nin explaining the strike. (Reynoso, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 925.) These maneuvers\nviolate the high court‘s admonition that adjudication of a Batson challenge ―does\nnot call for a mere exercise in thinking up any rational basis.‖ (Miller-El, supra,\n545 U.S. at p. 252.) A prosecutor‘s strike must ―stand or fall on the plausibility of\nthe reasons he gives,‖ regardless of whether ―a trial judge, or an appeals court, can\nimagine a reason that might not have been shown up as false.‖ (Ibid.)\n       It is no doubt true that ―a myriad of factors readily observable by those\npresent in the courtroom, but not by those who are reviewing the case from a cold\ntranscribed record on appeal,‖ may properly inform a Batson ruling. (Reynoso,\nsupra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 925.) For this reason, the trial court is in the best position\nto make the all-things-considered judgment required at Batson‘s third stage.\n\n                                          24\n\fWhen a trial court has conducted the requisite analysis and has articulated the\nfindings that inform its Batson ruling, the principle of judicial restraint fully\nsupports the application of deference on appeal. But when the ―myriad of factors\nreadily observable to those present in the courtroom‖ is simply left to judicial\nspeculation on appeal, the application of deference does not reflect restraint at all.\nIt is instead an active imagining of inquiries and analyses that may or may not\nhave occurred. Like my colleagues, I am confident that our trial courts approach\nthe evaluation of Batson claims with competence and sincerity. But jury selection\ncan be a complex process, and in the context of a particular strike, a trial court\nmay have ―stopped taking notes‖ (Williams, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 651), it may\nhave neglected to consult the record of voir dire (id. at p. 716 (dis. opn. of Liu,\nJ.)), it ―may not have recalled [a juror‘s] demeanor‖ (Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at\np. 479), it may have declined to engage in comparative juror analysis despite the\nurging of counsel (maj. opn., ante, at p. 79), it may have applied an erroneous\nlegal standard in assessing a Batson claim (Reynoso, at pp. 933–934 (dis. opn. of\nKennard, J.), or it may have made an unreasonable judgment under the totality of\ncircumstances (Miller-El, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 266). Filling these gaps on appeal\nwith speculation and presumptions is not an exercise of judicial restraint. It is also\ncounterproductive. Our ―don‘t ask, don‘t tell‖ approach to appellate review —\nwhereby this court does not ask, when trial courts do not tell, the reasons for their\nBatson rulings — erodes the incentive for trial courts to articulate their findings\nand analysis, thereby heightening the frequency with which reviewing courts must\nresolve Batson claims on the basis of a paper record.\n       More fundamentally, in light of what decades of research have revealed\nabout the stubborn role of race in jury selection (see Harris, supra, __ Cal.4th at\npp. __–__ [at pp. 35–39] (conc. opn. of Liu, J.) [reviewing studies], it seems\nempirically suspect — if not downright unfair — to apply a rule of deference\n\n                                          25\n\fwhose practical effect is to hold that what a trial court leaves unsaid in denying a\nBatson claim will be construed on appeal in favor of the prosecution. The Batson\ninquiry ultimately focuses on the subjective genuineness of the prosecutor‘s stated\nreasons. It is a motive test, and short of a naked admission, it can be difficult to\ndetermine a person‘s motive with reasonable certainty. The law properly\naddresses this uncertainty by placing on the defendant the burden to prove it was\nmore likely than not that the prosecutor‘s strike was motivated by race. The proof\nstandard and the allocation of the burden to the defendant can be decisive in a\nclose case, as I show below. (See post, at pp. 27–29.) But the law should not\naddress the uncertainty by construing against the defendant all that we cannot\nknow — because the trial court provided no findings or analysis — about what\nactually happened in the courtroom.\n       Our earlier precedent held trial courts to their obligation to make ―a sincere\nand reasoned attempt to evaluate the prosecutor‘s explanation‖ (Hall, supra, 35\nCal.3d at p. 167) and underscored ―the trial court‘s role in making an adequate\nrecord‖ by declaring that ―[n]otwithstanding the deference we give to a trial\ncourt‘s determinations of credibility and sincerity, we can only do so when the\ncourt has clearly expressed its findings and rulings and the bases therefor‖\n(Fuentes, supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 716, fn. 5). Many trial courts do articulate the\ngrounds for their Batson rulings, and it is entirely appropriate to make appellate\ndeference contingent on this practice. For what is at issue is not some minor legal\ntechnicality, but a vital inquiry that implicates the most basic notions of fairness in\nour justice system. The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized\nthe three-dimensional harm that results from racial discrimination in jury\nselection. The defendant is deprived of his ―right to be tried by a jury whose\nmembers are selected pursuant to non-discriminatory criteria.‖ (Batson, supra,\n476 U.S. at pp. 85–86.) The excluded juror ―suffers a profound personal\n\n                                          26\n\fhumiliation heightened by its public character‖ and loses ―a significant\nopportunity to participate in civic life.‖ (Powers v. Ohio (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112570\"><a href=\"/opinion/112570/powers-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n413–414, 409.) And ―[t]he harm from discriminatory jury selection extends\nbeyond that inflicted on the defendant and the excluded juror to touch the entire\ncommunity. Selection procedures that purposefully exclude black persons from\njuries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.‖\n(Batson, at p. 87; see Miller-El, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 238 [―[T]he very integrity of\nthe courts is jeopardized when a prosecutor‘s discrimination ‗invites cynicism\nrespecting the jury‘s neutrality,‘ [citation], and undermines public confidence in\nadjudication [citations].‖]; Powers, at p. 412.) In light of these potential harms, it\ndoes not seem too much to insist that trial courts or, as a failsafe, reviewing courts\ndemonstrate a truly reasoned effort to evaluate a defendant‘s assertion of this\nimportant right in light of all the circumstances bearing on it.\n                                         III.\n       Because we cannot defer to the trial court‘s Batson ruling in this case, we\nmust independently examine the record to determine whether defendant has shown\nthat it was more likely than not that one or more of the prosecutor‘s strikes were\nmotivated by race.\n       The record shows that the prosecutor struck all three black prospective\njurors in the venire. This fact properly raises a suspicion but does not by itself\nprove discrimination. The significance of the pattern is attenuated in this case by\nthe fact that the prosecutor gave credible reasons for striking two of the black\njurors, P.F. and L.P. In her questionnaire and voir dire, P.F. consistently said she\nviewed the death penalty as an appropriate punishment for a person who has\nshown ―a pattern‖ of violence or disregard for life. When the prosecutor asked\nP.F. if her focus on a pattern of behavior ―wasn‘t something exclusive,‖ she\nagreed. But P.F., when using her own words, did not voice support for the death\n\n                                          27\n\fpenalty in terms other than as punishment for ―a pattern‖ of behavior, and no other\nseated or alternate juror expressed similar views. I thus conclude that the\nprosecutor‘s concern that P.F. had said ―in her questionnaire [that the death\npenalty] was appropriate only where there was a pattern of violent conduct‖ was,\nin all likelihood, not pretextual. And I reach the same conclusion about the\nprosecutor‘s strike of L.P. based on his concerns that ―[s]he is a social worker,‖ a\nfact unique to L.P. as compared to the seated and alternate jurors, and that ―she\ncouldn‘t vote for the death penalty unless . . . the facts were proved beyond a\nshadow of a doubt,‖ a natural understanding of L.P.‘s remarks at voir dire.\n       Having found it improbable that the prosecutor struck P.F. or L.P. because\nof their race, I would examine the prosecutor‘s strike of M.H. without any\nsuspicion arising from the fact that it occurred as part of an apparent pattern. Still,\nthe strike appears suspicious because, as noted, the prosecutor‘s characterization\nof M.H.‘s attitude regarding the death penalty as ―personal and emotional, not\nphilosophical‖ is a strained interpretation of what she said at voir dire, especially\nwhen considered in light of the views she indicated on her questionnaire. (Ante, at\npp. 8–9.) Further, with respect to the prosecutor‘s concern that ―she is young,\nsingle and no children,‖ his claim that ―no other jurors . . . fit that pattern‖ appears\nquestionable in light of the fact that two seated jurors, Juror No. 1 and Juror No.\n12, were single, childless, and close in age to M.H. (Ante, at pp. 10–11.) Juror\nNo. 12‘s general views in favor of the death penalty were not very different from\nM.H.‘s (ante, at pp. 11–12), and Juror No. 1 said on her questionnaire that the\ndeath penalty should be used ―[o]nly in extreme cases,‖ though during voir dire\nshe said she had no particular case in mind and ―it would depend on everything.‖\n       At the same time, comparative juror analysis reveals an important fact that\nsupports the prosecutor‘s credibility. Besides M.H., three prospective jurors\nstruck by the prosecutor were young, single, and without children: K.D. (age 28),\n\n                                           28\n\fA.L. (age 20), and T.F. (age 33). In addition, all three indicated support for the\ndeath penalty. K.D. wrote on her questionnaire that the death penalty ―should be\nimposed‖ in appropriate cases, and she said during voir dire that she would be able\nto follow the court‘s instructions and vote for death if the aggravating factors\noutweighed the mitigating factors. A.L. wrote that she had no strong ―personal\nfeelings about the law‖ and would ―do what [she was] supposed to,‖ and affirmed\nduring voir dire that she could personally vote to impose the death penalty. T.F.\nstated that he believed the death penalty was the ―appropriate and just\npunishment‖ in certain cases, and that he would ―disagree‖ with the Legislature if\nit were to get rid of it. The fact that the prosecutor struck three other young,\nsingle, and childless pro-death penalty jurors lends credence to the prosecutor‘s\nstatement, in explaining why he struck M.H., that ―primarily the reason [is] she is\nyoung, single and no children‖ (italics added). By indicating that the prosecutor\ndid not single out M.H. among all other prospective jurors possessing those\ncharacteristics, the prosecutor‘s strikes of K.D., A.L., and T.F. tend to diminish the\ninference of discrimination arising from the fact that the prosecutor did not also\nstrike Juror No. 1 and Juror No.12, both of whom were slightly older than M.H.\n       Ultimately, the prosecutor‘s strikes of K.D., A.L., and T.F. make the\npossibility that he struck M.H. primarily because she was young, single, and\nwithout children at least as likely as the possibility that he struck M.H. because of\nher race. Based on an independent examination of the record, I conclude that\ndefendant has not carried his burden of proving that it was more likely than not\nthat the prosecutor struck M.H. because of her race. Accordingly, defendant‘s\nBatson claim must be rejected.\n       In all other respects, I join the court‘s opinion affirming the judgment.\n\n\n                                                  LIU, J.\n\n                                          29\n\fSee next page for addresses and telephone numbers for counsel who argued in Supreme Court.\n\nName of Opinion People v.
