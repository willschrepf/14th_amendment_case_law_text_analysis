United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761,  764 (1st\r                          _____________    ______\r<br>\r<br>            Cir. 1996).  In July of 1995, a sixteen-year-old acquaintance\r<br>\r<br>            of Cardoza, Myron Ragsdale, asked Cardoza to secure a handgun\r<br>\r<br>            for him to purchase.  Cardoza found a dealer willing to  sell\r<br>\r<br>            a  nine-millimeter  semiautomatic  handgun  to  Ragsdale  for\r<br>\r<br>            $200.00.  On the night of July 14, 1995, Cardoza and Ragsdale\r<br>\r<br>            went to Walnut  Park in Roxbury,  Massachusetts, to make  the\r<br>\r<br>            gun purchase.  Ragsdale paid $200.00 for the handgun and nine\r<br>\r<br>            rounds  of ammunition.   Ragsdale  loaded the gun  with eight\r<br>\r<br>            rounds  of ammunition,  and Cardoza  took  possession of  the\r<br>\r<br>            ninth round.\r<br>\r<br>                      Sometime  after  the   transaction  was  completed,\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza and Ragsdale began walking along Humboldt Avenue.  As\r<br>\r<br>            they walked,  Ragsdale had the  handgun in his  waistband and\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza  carried the single round of  ammunition in his hand.\r<br>\r<br>            By this time it was approximately 2:00 a.m. on the morning of\r<br>\r<br>            July 15.  They were  spotted walking along Humboldt Avenue by\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -2-\r                                          2\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            four  officers of the  Boston Police's Youth  Violence Strike\r<br>\r<br>            Force who were patrolling the area in an unmarked police car.\r<br>\r<br>            One of the  officers in the car, Gregory  Brown, noticed that\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza and  Ragsdale were acting  indecisively about whether\r<br>\r<br>            to continue walking up Humboldt, or instead cross  the street\r<br>\r<br>            in front  of the police  car.  Moving slowly,  the police car\r<br>\r<br>            approached Cardoza and Ragsdale from  behind.  As the  patrol\r<br>\r<br>            car approached, Cardoza and  Ragsdale crossed Humboldt Avenue\r<br>\r<br>            in order to walk up the sidewalk of Ruthven Street, a one-way\r<br>\r<br>            thoroughfare  that emptied  onto Humboldt  Avenue.   As  they\r<br>\r<br>            crossed in front  of the car, Officer Brown,  who was sitting\r<br>\r<br>            in the back seat on the driver's side, recognized Cardoza and\r<br>\r<br>            directed the  driver to  make a left  turn off  Humboldt, and\r<br>\r<br>            proceed the  wrong  way  up  Ruthven for  a  short  distance.\r<br>\r<br>            Officer Brown testified  that he wanted  to ask Cardoza  some\r<br>\r<br>            questions concerning a  shooting incident  that had  occurred\r<br>\r<br>            some days earlier.  The driver took the left turn, and pulled\r<br>\r<br>            over to the curb just  off Humboldt, facing the wrong  way on\r<br>\r<br>            Ruthven Street.\r<br>\r<br>                      Officer Brown, whose window was rolled down, called\r<br>\r<br>            out  to Cardoza,  asking \"What's  up Freddie?   What  are you\r<br>\r<br>            doing out this time of  night?\"  Cardoza stopped, turned, and\r<br>\r<br>            approached  the patrol  car.   Ragsdale  continued walking  a\r<br>\r<br>            short distance.  Officer Brown remained in the car conversing\r<br>\r<br>            with Cardoza through the open car window.   As he talked with\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -3-\r                                          3\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            Officer  Brown, Cardoza  began  to  gesture  with  his  hand,\r<br>\r<br>            exposing  the  round of  ammunition.    Seeing the  round  of\r<br>\r<br>            ammunition, Brown exited  the patrol car,  and began to  pat-\r<br>\r<br>            frisk Cardoza.   At the same time, two  other officers exited\r<br>\r<br>            the  car and approached and pat-frisked Ragsdale, discovering\r<br>\r<br>            the handgun loaded with eight rounds of ammunition.\r<br>\r<br>                      Cardoza  was  indicted  on four  counts.    Count I\r<br>\r<br>            charged Cardoza with being a felon-in-possession of one round\r<br>\r<br>            of ammunition, in violation of  18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1).  Count\r<br>\r<br>            II  charged Cardoza under  the same statutory  provision with\r<br>\r<br>            being a  felon-in-possession of  the semi-automatic  firearm,\r<br>\r<br>            based on  his alleged  possession of the  weapon for  a short\r<br>\r<br>            period  of time  after the  transaction.   Count III  charged\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza with  causing the sale,  delivery, and transfer  of a\r<br>\r<br>            handgun  to  a juvenile  in  violation of  the  Youth Handgun\r<br>\r<br>            Safety Act, codified at 18 U.S.C.   922(x).  Count IV charged\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza with aiding and abetting a juvenile in the possession\r<br>\r<br>            of a handgun  in violation of  the same.   A jury returned  a\r<br>\r<br>            guilty verdict  on Counts  I, III, and  IV, and  acquitted on\r<br>\r<br>            Count  II.    Following  the   jury  verdict,  but  prior  to\r<br>\r<br>            sentencing, the district court  issued a memorandum detailing\r<br>\r<br>            its refusal to grant both Cardoza's motion to dismiss and his\r<br>\r<br>            motion for judgment of acquittal.  United States  v. Cardoza,\r                                               _____________     _______\r<br>\r<br>            914  F.  Supp. 683  (D.  Mass.  1996).   The  district  court\r<br>\r<br>            sentenced  Cardoza  under  the Guidelines  to  235  months of\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -4-\r                                          4\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            imprisonment  and five  years of  supervised  release.   This\r<br>\r<br>            appeal followed.\r<br>\r<br>                                          I.\r                                          I.\r<br>\r<br>                             The Meaning of \"Ammunition\"\r                             The Meaning of \"Ammunition\"\r<br>\r<br>                      Cardoza launches  his appeal  by  arguing that  the\r<br>\r<br>            single  nine  millimeter  bullet which  he  was  convicted of\r<br>\r<br>            possessing  is  not  \"ammunition\" within  the  meaning  of 18\r<br>\r<br>            U.S.C.   922(g).  We disagree.\r<br>\r<br>                      Cardoza was  convicted of  violating the  felon-in-\r<br>\r<br>            possession  statute, which makes  it illegal for  a convicted\r<br>\r<br>            felon \"to  possess in or  affecting commerce, any  firearm or\r<br>\r<br>            ammunition . .  . .\"  18 U.S.C    922(g)(1)(West Supp. 1997).\r<br>\r<br>            \"Ammunition\" is  defined as  \"ammunition or cartridge  cases,\r<br>\r<br>            primers,  bullets, or propellent  powder designed for  use in\r<br>\r<br>            any  firearm.\"  18  U.S.C.   921(a)(17)(A)(West  Supp. 1997).\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza  suggests  first that  the  statutory  definition, by\r<br>\r<br>            including  the plural words  \"cases, primers,  [and] bullets\"\r<br>\r<br>            bans  only  the  possession   of  more  than  one   piece  of\r<br>\r<br>            ammunition.  Second,  he suggests that the  word \"ammunition\"\r<br>\r<br>            itself always means multiple rounds.  Finally, Cardoza argues\r<br>\r<br>            that the definition of \"ammunition\" is sufficiently ambiguous\r<br>\r<br>            to require application of the \"rule of lenity,\" United States\r                                                            _____________\r<br>\r<br>            v.

This is so\r<br>\r<br>            because it  prohibits expressly commercial  activity, namely,\r<br>\r<br>            the sale, transfer, or delivery of handguns to juveniles.  It\r<br>\r<br>            therefore  stands   in  direct  opposition   to  the  statute\r<br>\r<br>            invalidated in Lopez, which \"by its terms ha[d] nothing to do\r                           _____\r<br>\r<br>            with 'commerce'  or any sort of economic  enterprise . . . .\"\r<br>\r<br>            Id. at 561.  \r            ___\r<br>\r<br>                      Similarly,  we think  the possessory  prong of  the\r<br>\r<br>            YHSA,  under  which  Cardoza  was  convicted  of  aiding  and\r<br>\r<br>            abetting, is  \"an essential  part of  a larger regulation  of\r<br>\r<br>            economic  activity, in which  the regulatory scheme  could be\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -13-\r                                          13\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.\"  Id.\r                                                                      ___\r<br>\r<br>            This is so because the YHSA was designed expressly to \"stop[]\r<br>\r<br>            the commerce in  handguns with juveniles nationwide .  . . .\"\r<br>\r<br>            H.R.

Part of this  regulatory approach\r<br>\r<br>            involves the  suppression of  the demand  for such  handguns.\r<br>\r<br>            The  YHSA can  be thus  seen  as criminalization  of the  two\r<br>\r<br>            points where  the prohibited  commerce finds  its nexus;  the\r<br>\r<br>            demand  for  the  firearms  (possession),  and  the  sale  or\r<br>\r<br>            transfer  designed to meet that demand.

Reading the   findings in total, it is  apparent that\r<br>\r<br>            the  court determined  that there  was  no \"stop\"  within the\r<br>\r<br>            meaning of  Terry v.

The  court found  that prior to  seeing the\r<br>\r<br>            bullet in his  hand, the police  had no  basis upon which  to\r<br>\r<br>            constitutionally detain Mr. Cardoza.   Yet it went on to hold\r<br>\r<br>            that  the interaction between  Officer Brown and  Cardoza was\r<br>\r<br>            \"lawful,\" and provided no grounds  upon which to exclude  the\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -18-\r                                          18\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            evidence.  Under current  Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the\r<br>\r<br>            only way  the district court  could have determined  that the\r<br>\r<br>            interaction was lawful (here meaning constitutional) and also\r<br>\r<br>            hold that there  was no reasonable and  articulable suspicion\r<br>\r<br>            upon which to  detain Cardoza, was for it to  decide that the\r<br>\r<br>            police were  not detaining,  or seizing,  Cardoza within  the\r<br>\r<br>            meaning of the Fourth Amendment.4  We conclude therefore that\r<br>\r<br>            the  court below  determined  that there  was  no seizure  of\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza prior to  Officer Brown's sighting  of the bullet  in\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza's hand.

To be\r<br>\r<br>            sure, \"not  all  personal intercourse  between policemen  and\r<br>\r<br>            citizens involves 'seizures' of persons.\"  Terry, 392 U.S. at\r                                                       _____\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            4.  The government  also suggests  that because  the district\r<br>            court  inferred  that  Cardoza  deliberately  approached  the\r<br>            cruiser in order to throw  the police off Ragsdale, there was\r<br>            no \"submission  to\"  a police  show of  authority within  the\r<br>            meaning of California v.

We  note only that, given  the generally\r<br>            objective standards  employed  in  Fourth  Amendment  seizure\r<br>            analysis,  we would  see little  reason  to inquire  into the\r<br>            subjective intent of the detainee in making the determination\r<br>            whether  or  not he  or  she  has \"submitted  to\"  a show  of\r<br>            authority.\r<br>\r<br>                                         -19-\r                                          19\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            19  n.16.

Finally, Cardoza  adds that his\r<br>\r<br>            past interactions  with the same  officer led him  to believe\r<br>\r<br>            that he was not free to leave at the time he was called over.\r<br>\r<br>            Although  each of  these facts  distinguishes  his case  from\r<br>\r<br>            Young and  Sealey, our  job in  identifying whether  a Fourth\r            _____      ______\r<br>\r<br>            Amendment seizure has  occurred is not  absolutely controlled\r<br>\r<br>            by the  traditional operation of factually similar precedent.\r<br>\r<br>            This is so because no two police-citizen encounters will ever\r<br>\r<br>            be   completely  identical.

And  Officer Brown  remained in  the car  when he\r<br>\r<br>            called  out to  Cardoza.   In total,  the encounter  does not\r<br>\r<br>            objectively communicate a \"restrain[t against] his freedom to\r<br>\r<br>            walk away . . . .\"  Terry, 392 U.S. at 16.

We  are therefore  unpersuaded\r<br>\r<br>            that the  police officers' actions  transformed \"mere  police\r<br>\r<br>            questioning,\" Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434, into a seizure.   \r                          _______\r<br>\r<br>                      We recognize,  of course,  the import of  Cardoza's\r<br>\r<br>            observation that  few people,  including himself,  would ever\r<br>\r<br>            feel free to walk away from any  police question.

He received three to five years\r<br>\r<br>            incarceration.  Cardoza  was released on September  30, 1994.\r<br>\r<br>            The offenses for which he was convicted in the instant appeal\r<br>\r<br>            occurred just over nine months later.\r<br>\r<br>                      At sentencing, the government and Cardoza's counsel\r<br>\r<br>            agreed  that the proper  sentence calculation under  the ACCA\r<br>\r<br>            and U.S.S.G. was 235 to 293 months.  No argument was  made by\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza's counsel to depart downward.8  Cardoza did, however,\r<br>\r<br>            press  his constitutional arguments both in his objections to\r<br>\r<br>            the  PSR  and  at  the  disposition  hearing.    Cardoza  was\r<br>\r<br>            sentenced to  235 months incarceration  on Count I,  one year\r<br>\r<br>            each on Counts III and IV to  run concurrent with Count I and\r<br>\r<br>            each other, and supervised release  of five years.  The court\r<br>\r<br>            concluded sentencing with the following statement:\r<br>\r<br>                      I've given you the  most lenient sentence\r<br>                      that  I am  authorized to give  under the\r<br>                      law.  And  yet that lenient sentence,  at\r<br>                      least  given  what   discretion  I  have,\r<br>                      sentences  you to  prison  for nearly  20\r<br>                      years  of your  life.   And  the fact  is\r<br>                      that, . . . as you  were building up this\r<br>                      conviction    after   conviction    after\r<br>                      conviction after conviction  in the state\r<br>                      courts, with these short  sentences or no\r<br>                      sentences, you were laying the groundwork\r<br>                      for this  sentence which is  imposed upon\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            8.  Cardoza notes in his brief his contention that several of\r<br>            his convictions below were unconstitutionally obtained.   His\r<br>            counsel conceded at the disposition hearing, however, that he\r<br>            cannot collaterally  attack these convictions  at sentencing.\r<br>            Custis  v.

In  the  years   preceding  his\r<br>\r<br>            conviction  below, Cardoza  had  racked  up  at  least  three\r<br>\r<br>            convictions  for  violent  felonies  in   the  state  courts.\r<br>\r<br>            Responding  to  the  very  problem  presented   by  Cardoza's\r<br>\r<br>            conduct, Congress decided to \"infuse federal law  enforcement\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -32-\r                                          32\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            into efforts at  curbing and 'incapacitating''armed, habitual\r<br>\r<br>            (career) criminals.'\"  Id.

The  only mention  made of\r<br>\r<br>            this challenge in the district court is by incantation of the\r<br>\r<br>            term \"Due Process\" in Cardoza's objections to the PSR.

In July of 1995, a sixteen-year-old acquaintance\r<br>\r<br>            of Cardoza, Myron Ragsdale, asked Cardoza to secure a handgun\r<br>\r<br>            for him to purchase.  Cardoza found a dealer willing to  sell\r<br>\r<br>            a  nine-millimeter  semiautomatic  handgun  to  Ragsdale  for\r<br>\r<br>            $200.00.  On the night of July 14, 1995, Cardoza and Ragsdale\r<br>\r<br>            went to Walnut  Park in Roxbury,  Massachusetts, to make  the\r<br>\r<br>            gun purchase.  Ragsdale paid $200.00 for the handgun and nine\r<br>\r<br>            rounds  of ammunition.   Ragsdale  loaded the gun  with eight\r<br>\r<br>            rounds  of ammunition,  and Cardoza  took  possession of  the\r<br>\r<br>            ninth round.\r<br>\r<br>                      Sometime  after  the   transaction  was  completed,\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza and Ragsdale began walking along Humboldt Avenue.  As\r<br>\r<br>            they walked,  Ragsdale had the  handgun in his  waistband and\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza  carried the single round of  ammunition in his hand.\r<br>\r<br>            By this time it was approximately 2:00 a.m. on the morning of\r<br>\r<br>            July 15.  They were  spotted walking along Humboldt Avenue by\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -2-\r                                          2\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            four  officers of the  Boston Police's Youth  Violence Strike\r<br>\r<br>            Force who were patrolling the area in an unmarked police car.\r<br>\r<br>            One of the  officers in the car, Gregory  Brown, noticed that\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza and  Ragsdale were acting  indecisively about whether\r<br>\r<br>            to continue walking up Humboldt, or instead cross  the street\r<br>\r<br>            in front  of the police  car.  Moving slowly,  the police car\r<br>\r<br>            approached Cardoza and Ragsdale from  behind.  As the  patrol\r<br>\r<br>            car approached, Cardoza and  Ragsdale crossed Humboldt Avenue\r<br>\r<br>            in order to walk up the sidewalk of Ruthven Street, a one-way\r<br>\r<br>            thoroughfare  that emptied  onto Humboldt  Avenue.   As  they\r<br>\r<br>            crossed in front  of the car, Officer Brown,  who was sitting\r<br>\r<br>            in the back seat on the driver's side, recognized Cardoza and\r<br>\r<br>            directed the  driver to  make a left  turn off  Humboldt, and\r<br>\r<br>            proceed the  wrong  way  up  Ruthven for  a  short  distance.\r<br>\r<br>            Officer Brown testified  that he wanted  to ask Cardoza  some\r<br>\r<br>            questions concerning a  shooting incident  that had  occurred\r<br>\r<br>            some days earlier.  The driver took the left turn, and pulled\r<br>\r<br>            over to the curb just  off Humboldt, facing the wrong  way on\r<br>\r<br>            Ruthven Street.\r<br>\r<br>                      Officer Brown, whose window was rolled down, called\r<br>\r<br>            out  to Cardoza,  asking \"What's  up Freddie?   What  are you\r<br>\r<br>            doing out this time of  night?\"  Cardoza stopped, turned, and\r<br>\r<br>            approached  the patrol  car.   Ragsdale  continued walking  a\r<br>\r<br>            short distance.  Officer Brown remained in the car conversing\r<br>\r<br>            with Cardoza through the open car window.   As he talked with\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -3-\r                                          3\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            Officer  Brown, Cardoza  began  to  gesture  with  his  hand,\r<br>\r<br>            exposing  the  round of  ammunition.    Seeing the  round  of\r<br>\r<br>            ammunition, Brown exited  the patrol car,  and began to  pat-\r<br>\r<br>            frisk Cardoza.   At the same time, two  other officers exited\r<br>\r<br>            the  car and approached and pat-frisked Ragsdale, discovering\r<br>\r<br>            the handgun loaded with eight rounds of ammunition.\r<br>\r<br>                      Cardoza  was  indicted  on four  counts.    Count I\r<br>\r<br>            charged Cardoza with being a felon-in-possession of one round\r<br>\r<br>            of ammunition, in violation of  18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1).  Count\r<br>\r<br>            II  charged Cardoza under  the same statutory  provision with\r<br>\r<br>            being a  felon-in-possession of  the semi-automatic  firearm,\r<br>\r<br>            based on  his alleged  possession of the  weapon for  a short\r<br>\r<br>            period  of time  after the  transaction.   Count III  charged\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza with  causing the sale,  delivery, and transfer  of a\r<br>\r<br>            handgun  to  a juvenile  in  violation of  the  Youth Handgun\r<br>\r<br>            Safety Act, codified at 18 U.S.C.   922(x).  Count IV charged\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza with aiding and abetting a juvenile in the possession\r<br>\r<br>            of a handgun  in violation of  the same.   A jury returned  a\r<br>\r<br>            guilty verdict  on Counts  I, III, and  IV, and  acquitted on\r<br>\r<br>            Count  II.    Following  the   jury  verdict,  but  prior  to\r<br>\r<br>            sentencing, the district court  issued a memorandum detailing\r<br>\r<br>            its refusal to grant both Cardoza's motion to dismiss and his\r<br>\r<br>            motion for judgment of acquittal.

We disagree.\r<br>\r<br>                      Cardoza was  convicted of  violating the  felon-in-\r<br>\r<br>            possession  statute, which makes  it illegal for  a convicted\r<br>\r<br>            felon \"to  possess in or  affecting commerce, any  firearm or\r<br>\r<br>            ammunition . .  . .\"  18 U.S.C    922(g)(1)(West Supp. 1997).\r<br>\r<br>            \"Ammunition\" is  defined as  \"ammunition or cartridge  cases,\r<br>\r<br>            primers,  bullets, or propellent  powder designed for  use in\r<br>\r<br>            any  firearm.\"  18  U.S.C.   921(a)(17)(A)(West  Supp. 1997).\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza  suggests  first that  the  statutory  definition, by\r<br>\r<br>            including  the plural words  \"cases, primers,  [and] bullets\"\r<br>\r<br>            bans  only  the  possession   of  more  than  one   piece  of\r<br>\r<br>            ammunition.  Second,  he suggests that the  word \"ammunition\"\r<br>\r<br>            itself always means multiple rounds.  Finally, Cardoza argues\r<br>\r<br>            that the definition of \"ammunition\" is sufficiently ambiguous\r<br>\r<br>            to require application of the \"rule of lenity,\" United States\r                                                            _____________\r<br>\r<br>            v.

Part of this  regulatory approach\r<br>\r<br>            involves the  suppression of  the demand  for such  handguns.\r<br>\r<br>            The  YHSA can  be thus  seen  as criminalization  of the  two\r<br>\r<br>            points where  the prohibited  commerce finds  its nexus;  the\r<br>\r<br>            demand  for  the  firearms  (possession),  and  the  sale  or\r<br>\r<br>            transfer  designed to meet that demand.  The two prohibitions\r<br>\r<br>            go hand in hand  with one another.  Invalidation of  one half\r<br>\r<br>            of the equation would likely have deleterious effects on  the\r<br>\r<br>            efficacy of  the legislation.   In this  regard, we  think it\r<br>\r<br>            clear that given  Congress' express purpose, its  decision to\r<br>\r<br>            punish   both  the  supply  (sale  or  transfer)  and  demand\r<br>\r<br>            (possession)  sides of  the  market  is  a  means  reasonably\r<br>\r<br>            calculated to achieve its end.

Assuming, then, for purposes\r<br>\r<br>            of this  appeal, that  the regulated  activity occurs  solely\r<br>\r<br>            intrastate,  we  must  now  pass  on  whether  this  activity\r<br>\r<br>            \"substantially affects\" interstate  commerce.

We do not think this\r<br>\r<br>            observation can be seriously disputed.

Simply\r<br>\r<br>            put,  the  handgun must  come  from somewhere,  often  out of\r<br>\r<br>            state.  Indeed, it is worth noting here  that even though the\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -15-\r                                          15\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            YHSA  does not require it, the government introduced evidence\r<br>\r<br>            at trial  that the  handgun transferred  to Ragsdale  had, in\r<br>\r<br>            fact, been  manufactured outside  Massachusetts.   Therefore,\r<br>\r<br>            the supply  and demand for  handguns in any given  state will\r<br>\r<br>            \"substantially  affect\" interstate  commerce  in handguns  by\r<br>\r<br>            causing the weapons to move across state lines.  \r<br>\r<br>                      In  Lopez,  the  Court  examined  its  decision  in\r                          _____\r<br>\r<br>            Wickard  v.

Reading the   findings in total, it is  apparent that\r<br>\r<br>            the  court determined  that there  was  no \"stop\"  within the\r<br>\r<br>            meaning of  Terry v.

Our reasoning\r                        _____    ____\r<br>\r<br>            is  as follows.   The  court found  that prior to  seeing the\r<br>\r<br>            bullet in his  hand, the police  had no  basis upon which  to\r<br>\r<br>            constitutionally detain Mr. Cardoza.   Yet it went on to hold\r<br>\r<br>            that  the interaction between  Officer Brown and  Cardoza was\r<br>\r<br>            \"lawful,\" and provided no grounds  upon which to exclude  the\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -18-\r                                          18\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            evidence.  Under current  Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the\r<br>\r<br>            only way  the district court  could have determined  that the\r<br>\r<br>            interaction was lawful (here meaning constitutional) and also\r<br>\r<br>            hold that there  was no reasonable and  articulable suspicion\r<br>\r<br>            upon which to  detain Cardoza, was for it to  decide that the\r<br>\r<br>            police were  not detaining,  or seizing,  Cardoza within  the\r<br>\r<br>            meaning of the Fourth Amendment.4  We conclude therefore that\r<br>\r<br>            the  court below  determined  that there  was  no seizure  of\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza prior to  Officer Brown's sighting  of the bullet  in\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza's hand.    See  McCarthy,  77  F.3d  at  525  (\"Where\r                               ___  ________\r<br>\r<br>            specific  findings are  lacking, we  view the  record in  the\r<br>\r<br>            light most  favorable to  the ruling,  making all  reasonably\r<br>\r<br>            supported inferences.\").\r<br>\r<br>                      We now  turn to  the gravamen  of Cardoza's  Fourth\r<br>\r<br>            Amendment  argument,  namely,  whether  the district  court's\r<br>\r<br>            determination that there  was no seizure was correct.   To be\r<br>\r<br>            sure, \"not  all  personal intercourse  between policemen  and\r<br>\r<br>            citizens involves 'seizures' of persons.\"  Terry, 392 U.S. at\r                                                       _____\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            4.  The government  also suggests  that because  the district\r<br>            court  inferred  that  Cardoza  deliberately  approached  the\r<br>            cruiser in order to throw  the police off Ragsdale, there was\r<br>            no \"submission  to\"  a police  show of  authority within  the\r<br>            meaning of California v.

We  note only that, given  the generally\r<br>            objective standards  employed  in  Fourth  Amendment  seizure\r<br>            analysis,  we would  see little  reason  to inquire  into the\r<br>            subjective intent of the detainee in making the determination\r<br>            whether  or  not he  or  she  has \"submitted  to\"  a show  of\r<br>            authority.\r<br>\r<br>                                         -19-\r                                          19\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            19  n.16.   Instead, \"[i]nteraction  between law  enforcement\r<br>\r<br>            officials  and citizens generally falls within three tiers of\r<br>\r<br>            Fourth Amendment analysis,  depending on the level  of police\r<br>\r<br>            intrusion into  a person's privacy.\"   Young, 105 F.3d  at 5.\r                                                   _____\r<br>\r<br>            The first  tier \"encompasses  interaction  of such  minimally\r<br>\r<br>            intrusive nature that  it does not trigger the protections of\r<br>\r<br>            the Fourth Amendment.\"  Id.

Similarly, the  police cruiser  pulled\r<br>\r<br>            over and stopped at the  curb before Officer Brown called out\r<br>\r<br>            to Cardoza.

And  Officer Brown  remained in  the car  when he\r<br>\r<br>            called  out to  Cardoza.   In total,  the encounter  does not\r<br>\r<br>            objectively communicate a \"restrain[t against] his freedom to\r<br>\r<br>            walk away . . . .\"  Terry, 392 U.S. at 16.  Officer Brown did\r                                _____\r<br>\r<br>            not  ask Cardoza to  stop, or even  to approach the  car.  He\r<br>\r<br>            simply  called  out  through  an  open  car  window with  the\r<br>\r<br>            question  \"what are  you doing  out at  this time  of night?\"\r<br>\r<br>            Those  words do  not objectively  communicate  an attempt  to\r<br>\r<br>            restrain Cardoza's  liberty.   We  are therefore  unpersuaded\r<br>\r<br>            that the  police officers' actions  transformed \"mere  police\r<br>\r<br>            questioning,\" Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434, into a seizure.   \r                          _______\r<br>\r<br>                      We recognize,  of course,  the import of  Cardoza's\r<br>\r<br>            observation that  few people,  including himself,  would ever\r<br>\r<br>            feel free to walk away from any  police question.

What emerges between  the two imperatives,\r<br>\r<br>            therefore,  is the directive that police conduct, viewed from\r<br>\r<br>            the   totality  of   the   circumstances,  must   objectively\r<br>\r<br>            communicate  that  the  officer  is  exercising  his  or  her\r<br>\r<br>            official  authority to  restrain the individual's  liberty of\r<br>\r<br>            movement  before  we  can  find  that  a  seizure  occurred.6\r<br>\r<br>            Because  there was  no such  objective  communication in  the\r<br>\r<br>            instant  case, we  affirm  the  district  court's  denial  of\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza's motion to suppress.   \r<br>\r<br>                                         IV.\r                                         IV.\r<br>\r<br>                                     The Sentence\r                                     The Sentence\r<br>\r<br>                      Cardoza's final argument  posits that his 235-month\r<br>\r<br>            sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\") and the\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            6.

Viewing,  therefore, the  total\r<br>\r<br>            conduct for which Cardoza has been sentenced, we  cannot find\r<br>\r<br>            a supportable inference of gross disproportionality, and thus\r<br>\r<br>            reject his Eighth Amendment challenge.\r<br>\r<br>                                          B.\r                                          B.\r<br>\r<br>                                     Due Process\r                                     Due Process\r<br>\r<br>                      We  note at the  outset that Cardoza's  due process\r<br>\r<br>            challenge was  not raised  below.  The  only mention  made of\r<br>\r<br>            this challenge in the district court is by incantation of the\r<br>\r<br>            term \"Due Process\" in Cardoza's objections to the PSR.  It is\r<br>\r<br>            well-settled  that  \"issues  adverted  to  in  a  perfunctory\r<br>\r<br>            manner,   unaccompanied   by   some   effort   at   developed\r<br>\r<br>            argumentation, are  deemed waived. .  . .

As\r<br>\r<br>            Cardoza himself recognizes, however, resolution of any errors\r<br>\r<br>            would not affect  his sentence.
