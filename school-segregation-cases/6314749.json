STATE OF TENNESSEE\n\n                 Appeal from the Circuit Court for Warren County\n                Nos. F-13913, F-13974    Larry B. Stanley, Jr., Judge\n                      ___________________________________\n\n                           Nos. M2017-00163-CCA-R3-PC\n                       ___________________________________\n\n\nIn 2012, the Warren County Grand Jury indicted Petitioner, Ronald Henry Aho, in case\nnumber F-13913 for aggravated burglary and theft of property over $1,000 but less than\n$10,000. Petitioner was also indicted in case number F-13974 for two counts each of\naggravated burglary and theft of property over $1,000 but less than $10,000. In January\n2014, Petitioner entered best interest guilty pleas in case numbers F-13913 and F-13974\nto a total of two counts of aggravated burglary and two counts of theft over $1,000 but\nless than $10,000 in exchange for the dismissal of the remaining charges and the\ndismissal of charges contained in three additional indictments. Pursuant to the plea\nagreement, Petitioner was sentenced to serve a total effective sentence of twenty-three\nyears, with the first fifteen years to be served at sixty percent release eligibility and the\nlast eight years to be served at forty-five percent release eligibility. Petitioner filed a\npetition for post-conviction relief, alleging that he received ineffective assistance of\ncounsel and that his pleas were unknowingly and involuntarily entered. Following an\nevidentiary hearing, the post-conviction court denied relief. After review, we affirm the\njudgment of the post-conviction court.\n\n  Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Circuit Court Affirmed\n\nROBERT L. HOLLOWAY, JR., delivered the opinion of the court, in which THOMAS T.\nWOODALL, P.J., and TIMOTHY L. EASTER, J., joined.\n\nG. Jeff Cherry and Christopher Beauchamp (on appeal), Lebanon, Tennessee, and\nSamuel F. Hudson (at hearing), Dunlap, Tennessee, for the appellant, Ronald Henry Aho.\n\nHerbert H. Slatery III, Attorney General and Reporter; Sophia S. Lee, Senior Counsel;\nLisa Zavogiannis, District Attorney General; and Randal Gilliam, Assistant District\nAttorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\f                                       OPINION\n\nPlea Submission Hearing\n\n        On January 29, 2014, Petitioner entered a best interest guilty plea, as a Career\nOffender, to aggravated burglary and theft over $1,000 in case number F-13913 and\nreceived concurrent sentences of fifteen years and twelve years, respectively, to serve in\nthe Department of Correction. In case number F-13974, Petitioner entered a best interest\nguilty plea, as a Range III Persistent Offender, to one count each of aggravated burglary\nand theft over $1,000. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Petitioner received concurrent\nsentences of eight years with forty-five percent release eligibility on each count to be\nserved consecutively to his effective fifteen-year sentence with a sixty percent release\neligibility in case number F-13913, for a total effective sentence of twenty-three years in\nthe Department of Correction. Based on Petitioner’s plea, the State dismissed the two\nremaining counts in case number F-13974, as well as the charges against Petitioner in\ncase numbers F-13975, F-13976, and F-13977.\n\n       At the plea submission hearing, the State recited the following factual basis for\ncase number F-13913:\n\n       [O]n October 18 of 2012, the State’s proof would have been that\n       [Petitioner] broke into a home on Spring Street here in Warren County\n       owned by Ms. Sheila Bates. Once inside, [he] obtained several items of\n       property including several items of jewelry with a combined value in\n       excess of a thousand dollars. [He] [l]eft the house with those items and was\n       able to elude the police in that incident.\n\n       The State recited the facts of case number F-13974, as follows:\n\n       [A] burglary [also] occurred [] on October 18 of 2012 of a house on 70\n       Underwood Road. Taken during that burglary were a Nintendo Wii, a\n       PlayStation 2, approximately 100 DVD and BluRay videos, an HP Compaq\n       notebook computer, a quantity of oxycodone and several other items and\n       that burglary and theft occurred here in Warren County. The State’s proof\n       would be that a short time later [Petitioner] was found in possession of that\n       stolen property.\n\n       ....\n\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\f       The State’s proof . . . would be . . . that they were found at a residence that\n       [Petitioner] was associated with and there would have been proof linking\n       him to that property.\n\n       When questioned by the trial court, Petitioner agreed that he went over the plea\ndocuments in both cases “thoroughly” with trial counsel. Petitioner testified that he\nunderstood the nature of the charges to which the pleas were offered, the minimum and\nmaximum sentence on each charge if convicted, his right to counsel at every stage of the\nproceedings, his right to plead not guilty, his right to a jury trial, his right to confront\nadverse witnesses and bring his own witnesses, his right to remain silent, and his right to\nappeal any resulting conviction or sentence. In accepting the terms of the plea\nagreement, Petitioner affirmed that he was waiving each of those rights. He also agreed\nthat he was entering his pleas freely and voluntarily. Petitioner denied that he was\nentering the pleas because he had been threatened to do so. The trial court found that\nPetitioner understood his rights and made a knowing, voluntary, and understanding\nwaiver of his rights by pleading guilty. The trial court additionally found that there was a\nfactual basis for Petitioner’s pleas.\n\nPost-Conviction Proceedings\n\n        On January 30, 2015, Petitioner filed a timely pro se petition for post-conviction\nrelief, asserting that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel and that his best\ninterest plea was unknowing and involuntary due to Petitioner’s mental incompetence.\nOn February 8, 2015, the post-conviction court entered a preliminary order appointing\ncounsel for Petitioner. Petitioner later retained counsel to represent him. On May 27,\n2015, Petitioner, through counsel, filed an amended petition for post-conviction relief.\n\n       At an evidentiary hearing on the petition, Bud Sharp testified that he had been\npracticing law for seven years when he was retained by Petitioner’s parents to represent\nPetitioner in case number F-13913. Mr. Sharp stated that he met with Petitioner twice in\na three-week period regarding the case. He stated that he may have filed a discovery\nmotion but did not investigate any witnesses because he was on the case for only four\nweeks. He stated that the case had not yet been set for trial when he withdrew from\nrepresenting Petitioner. Mr. Sharp recalled that he talked to Petitioner about entering a\nbest interest plea based on Petitioner’s extensive prior record, which consisted of “[forty]\nsomething felony convictions[,]” the unpredictability of a jury trial, and the strength of\nthe State’s proof. Specifically, Mr. Sharp recalled from the police report that the victim\nin case number F-13913 “pulled up to her house and [Petitioner] was in the house, came\nout of the house, the car was sitting in the driveway, and she got his tag number and he\nleft.”\n\n                                            -3-\n\f         Although Mr. Sharp remembered Petitioner discussing matters unrelated to his\ncase, Mr. Sharp stated that this was not unusual because many of his clients tended to go\noff subject. Mr. Sharp stated that Petitioner was “very intelligent[.]” Mr. Sharp stated\nthat he represented Petitioner in 2007 on a burglary and theft case and that Petitioner was\nmentally competent when he entered his guilty plea on the case. He acknowledged that\nhe was aware Petitioner was drawing SSI disability, but he stated that he was not aware\nof Petitioner’s being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder or anti-social\npersonality disorder. Mr. Sharp stated that, if the case had proceeded to trial, he may\nhave had Petitioner undergo a forensic evaluation based on the Petitioner’s drawing\ndisability. Mr. Sharp denied telling Petitioner he should talk with the prosecutor. He\nstated, “[Petitioner] may have written a letter to [the prosecutor]. My clients do not talk\nto the State period. I do not want my clients talking to the State even though they may\nhave good intentions.” Mr. Sharp recalled that Petitioner’s parents retained co-counsel,\nSteve Roller. Mr. Sharp talked to Mr. Roller over the phone about who would ultimately\nhandle the case and whether a plea agreement should be negotiated. They did not discuss\ntrial strategy. Mr. Sharp withdrew from the case on April 29, 2013.\n\n       Steve Roller testified that he had been a practicing attorney since 1978. Mr. Roller\nwas retained by Petitioner’s parents to represent Petitioner after dismissing Mr. Sharp for\nsome unspecified reason. Mr. Roller recalled that a trial date had been set for one of\nPetitioner’s cases. Mr. Roller did not recall Petitioner’s parents’ expressing concerns\nabout Petitioner’s mental health.\n\n       Mr. Roller testified that he met with Petitioner in the Warren County Jail more\nthan once. During this time, Petitioner told Mr. Roller that he wanted to meet with the\nprosecutor; however, the State was not interested in meeting with him. Mr. Roller\nacknowledged that he scheduled a meeting with Petitioner and investigators Jason\nRowland and Barry Powers to discuss facts about “certain different cases[,]” despite\nPetitioner not having an immunity agreement. Mr. Roller stated that he advised\nPetitioner not to meet with the investigators, but Petitioner “insisted” on meeting with\nthem.\n\n        Mr. Roller denied having any knowledge of Petitioner’s mental health issues.\nHowever, he recalled an incident in which Petitioner lost his temper and acted in such a\nway that guards interrupted their meeting and took Petitioner to his cell. Mr. Roller\ntestified that Petitioner demonstrated his understanding of the nature of the charges\nagainst him by asking and answering relevant questions about the case. Petitioner was\n“very educated with legal procedure and trial” due to his extensive criminal record.\nBased on Petitioner’s participation in his defense, Mr. Roller did not see the need to have\nPetitioner undergo a forensic evaluation.\n\n                                           -4-\n\f       Mr. Roller recalled that he was the subject of a complaint Petitioner filed with the\nBoard of Professional Responsibility (BPR). In his response to the complaint, Mr. Roller\nstated that Petitioner had serious mental problems and that Petitioner had “a mental\nbreakdown at the jail[.]” Mr. Roller testified, however, that he was attempting to\ndescribe the incident at the jail in which Petitioner lost his temper. Despite his letter to\nthe BPR, Mr. Roller did not believe that Petitioner lacked competency to participate in\nhis own defense. Mr. Roller acknowledged that he was required by the BPR to refund a\nsubstantial amount of the money paid by Petitioner’s parents for his representation.\n\n       Christopher Stanford testified that, at the time of the post-conviction hearing, he\nhad been practicing law for approximately nine years. He stated that about fifty percent\nof his practice involved defending individuals charged with criminal offenses. Mr.\nStanford recalled that he was retained by Petitioner’s parents in 2013 to represent\nPetitioner on his charges in multiple indictments. Petitioner’s parents also retained Lee\nNettles as a defense investigator. After being retained, Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles met\nwith Petitioner at a prison in West Tennessee for approximately three hours. Mr.\nStanford also obtained copies of the State’s discovery. Mr. Stanford recalled how\nknowledgeable Petitioner was about his cases, and he testified that he observed nothing in\nPetitioner’s behavior during their discussions to make him concerned about Petitioner’s\nmental health and to warrant a forensic evaluation. He explained:\n\n       . . . I never once had an inkling that [Petitioner] was unable to assist me\n       with his defense. In fact, he was probably – he seemed fairly well-versed in\n       the law. He seemed fairly able to point us in particular directions, able to\n       give us theories of defense and so while he did have some scattered thought\n       processes, . . . I mean, he would go down a rabbit trail and we would have\n       to redirect him back to the main issue but other than that I didn’t notice\n       anything about him that gave me cause for concern.\n\n       Mr. Stanford testified that he learned of Petitioner’s extensive prior record when\nthe State filed its “Notice of Intent to Use Conviction for Impeachment.” He recalled that\nthe State elected to proceed to trial first on case number F-13913. He explained that,\nonce the State made its election, he and the defense investigator primarily focused their\ninvestigative efforts on that case. Mr. Stanford recalled that he met with Petitioner at the\nWarren County Jail after Petitioner was transferred to the jail about a week before trial.\nHe met with Petitioner “several times in a three[-]day period” to prepare Petitioner for\ntrial.\n\n      Initially, the State refused to make a settlement offer, but Mr. Stanford eventually\nconvinced the prosecutor to make Petitioner an offer. He explained:\n\n                                           -5-\n\f       [I]t was my decision at that point that Petitioner needed to explore all\n       reasonable offers before he made a decision about trying these cases[.] [I]t\n       was my understanding that the DA wasn’t going to stop [trying Petitioner’s\n       cases] until [the State] had the number that they wanted as far as sentencing\n       goes. The initial offer was not acceptable to Petitioner.\n\nDuring Petitioner’s time in the Warren County Jail, Mr. Stanford approached the prosecutor\nand requested an agreement to continue the trial so that the parties could explore reaching a\nnegotiated settlement as Mr. Stanford could not adequately prepare for trial if he focused on\nplea negotiations. He spent the next two to three days, in January 2014, going back and\nforth between the prosecutor and Petitioner to settle the case.\n\n       Mr. Stanford remembered an individual named Joe Holland.1 He recalled that\nPetitioner wanted Mr. Holland charged with theft based on information Petitioner\nprovided to Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles. Petitioner was adamant that Mr. Holland was\ncriminally responsible for the offenses pending against Petitioner. Petitioner expressed\nthis belief to Mr. Stanford in person and through a thirteen-page letter written by\nPetitioner, in which Petitioner stated that he expected Mr. Holland to be charged before\nPetitioner’s trial. When pressed about whether anyone in Mr. Sanford’s office had\ninvestigated Mr. Holland, Mr. Stanford said that he did not personally conduct the first\ninterview with witnesses but stated that Mr. Nettles would have done that. Based on\nPetitioner’s thirteen-page letter, Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles investigated people\n“surrounding Joe Holland.” Mr. Stanford believed that it would be helpful to talk to Mr.\nHolland’s associates because they might be more willing to share information that Mr.\nHolland was the person who had committed the crimes. Mr. Stanford recalled that he\nreceived a letter from Barry McCormick, which indicated that certain stolen items had\nbeen purchased from Mr. Holland.\n\n       Mr. Stanford testified that he made a “strategic decision” that he needed to get\nready for one trial—the first case set for trial—and that he and Mr. Nettles needed to\nfocus the investigation on the individuals involved in that case. Regarding Petitioner’s\nplea in case number F-13974, Mr. Stanford explained:\n\n       The DA wanted a plea to the first case. That [case] was not an option. That\n       was going to be part of the plea deal. [The prosecutor] . . . didn’t care\n       which case [Petitioner] pled to after that. So we put the ball in\n       [Petitioner’s] court and said, you pick. Which case do you want to plead\n       to? And [Petitioner] wanted to plead to . . . [case number F-13974].\n\n       1\n          The record reflects that Mr. Holland was listed on the indictment in case number F-13974 as a\nwitness for the State.\n                                                 -6-\n\f        Mr. Stanford testified that Petitioner was “looking at a hundred plus years” based\non all the pending charges. He told Petitioner he would “be happy to try [the] case” but\nthat he wanted to also explore plea negotiations with the State. He explained that,\noriginally, the State’s plea offer included a much higher sentence but that Mr. Stanford\n“eventually worked it down[.]” He talked to Petitioner about the facts of the case, the\nperception of the jurors given those facts, and “what we thought the jury was likely to do\nwith that case[.]” Mr. Stanford believed that, as Petitioner realized his considerable\nliability, Petitioner’s mood began to “shift[.]” Petitioner was “tearful,” “angry,” and\n“very upset.” Mr. Stanford stated that Petitioner’s\n\n       main concern was that he get out of prison or that . . . all these charges be\n       dropped so he could spend the rest of his life with his lovely parents and I\n       think he became very sad and very tearful when he realized that [there]\n       might be a possibility that he might be in prison longer than they might\n       live.\n\n        Mr. Stanford explained that he had not subpoenaed witnesses the week before the\nscheduled trial because the defense could not come up with any witnesses other than\ncharacter witnesses like Petitioner’s parents and Shelia Thompson. He explained that\nMs. Thompson was the only witness that the defense could find that corroborated\nPetitioner’s version of events, but she would have “basically regurgitated . . . what\n[Petitioner] had told her[.]” Mr. Stanford recalled that the victim in case number F-13913\nwas “clear as [] could be that it was [Petitioner]” who had been in her driveway.\n\n       Mr. Stanford explained that most of his communication with Petitioner was\nconducted through Petitioner’s parents and through letters that Petitioner sent to Mr.\nStanford. Mr. Stanford denied that Petitioner’s parents tried to set up a phone account\nwith him to use to communicate with Petitioner. Mr. Stanford stated that Mr. Nettles\nnever advised Petitioner that “if you don’t accept this plea then I’m going to have to go\nout now and start subpoenaing witnesses[.]” He recalled that, on the day of the plea, the\ncourt clerk or the trial court indicated that they needed to know if Petitioner intended to\nenter the plea by a certain time that day so that the court would know whether or not to\ncall in the jury. However, there was not a deadline on the plea negotiations. Mr.\nStanford explained that the trial court would have granted a continuance because they had\nspent so much time in plea negotiations rather than trial preparation. Mr. Stanford had\nadvised Petitioner not to testify based on Petitioner’s prior record. He stated that, once he\nexplained to Petitioner the details of his investigative findings and what the State’s proof\nwould be at trial, Petitioner told Mr. Stanford, “[G]et me the best number you can get\nme[.]”\n\n                                            -7-\n\f        Mr. Stanford acknowledged that he did not file a motion challenging the State’s\nuse of Petitioner’s prior convictions to impeach Petitioner at trial. He agreed that many\nof Petitioner’s prior convictions were very similar to the charges Petitioner was facing.\nMr. Stanford recalled that he and Mr. Nettles met several times to review and organize\ndiscovery before the three-hour meeting with Petitioner. Mr. Stanford recalled that their\ninvestigation showed that the State had a witness that would testify that Petitioner\npossessed a weapon. The witness indicated Petitioner tried to give her two firearms.\nBecause of his substantial practice in federal court, Mr. Stanford was “very concerned”\nthat the federal prosecutors might seek to charge Petitioner under the Armed Career\nCriminal Act, in which case Petitioner “would have been looking at . . . probably [thirty]\nto life.” When Mr. Stanford approached the State about plea negotiations, Mr. Stanford\nhad a “gentlemen’s agreement” with the prosecutor that the prosecutor would not report\nthe firearms offense to the federal prosecutors. Mr. Stanford indicated that this was a\n“big part” of why Petitioner chose to plead guilty to the two indictments.\n\n        Mr. Stanford testified that Mr. Nettles spent over sixty hours investigating\nPetitioner’s cases prior to the plea and then spent an additional twenty hours after the plea\ntrying to secure an indictment against Mr. Holland in Coffee County. Mr. Stanford stated\nthat Petitioner wanted to go to trial until the prosecutor agreed to enter into plea\nnegotiations. Petitioner then wanted to explore the possibility of a plea. Mr. Stanford\nstated, “Once he realized that the State was willing to make an offer to him he was very\ninterested in how low we could get the number.” Mr. Stanford testified that he knew the\nprosecutor would not object to a continuance of the trial and testified that he told\nPetitioner about a possible continuance.\n\n      Mr. Stanford said that he did not believe he would have been able to cross-\nexamine Mr. Holland about any pending charges he was facing.2 He did not think that\ninformation would have been relevant and admissible. Petitioner provided Mr. Stanford\nwith a letter signed by Barry McCormick dated February 4, 2013, indicating Mr.\nHolland’s potential “guilt and involvement in some of the matters.”3\n\n\n        2\n          At the post-conviction hearing, Petitioner made an offer of proof regarding Mr. Holland’s\nconviction, submitting a Coffee County Grand Jury indictment charging Mr. Holland with theft over\n$10,000 and a judgment of conviction showing that Mr. Holland pled guilty to the charge on January 20,\n2016. It is not clear from the offer of proof the nature of Mr. Holland’s role in that offense. Moreover,\nalthough it appears that some of the victims listed in the indictment correspond to the victims listed in the\nindictments for case numbers F-13913 and F-13974, it is not clear from the record how Mr. Holland was\ninvolved in the offenses to which Petitioner pled guilty or why Mr. Holland was charged in Coffee\nCounty rather than Warren County.\n        3\n          It is unclear from the record whether Mr. Stanford’s reference to “some of the matters” meant\nPetitioner’s cases.\n                                                   -8-\n\f        Lee Nettles testified that he owned a private investigation company, ICT\nInvestigations, in Manchester. Mr. Nettles explained that he had seventeen years’ prior\nexperience in law enforcement before beginning his work as a private investigator. Mr.\nNettles recalled that Petitioner’s parents hired him in July 2013, along with Mr. Stanford,\nto assist with Petitioner’s defense. The following month, Mr. Nettles accompanied Mr.\nStanford to the prison in West Tennessee where Petitioner was being housed before trial\nand met with Petitioner for three hours to discuss the cases against Petitioner. Mr.\nNettles recalled that, during the meeting, Petitioner asked him to investigate Mr.\nHolland’s culpability in the burglaries and thefts. They “talked about each one of the[]\n[Petitioner’s] individual cases and different pieces of stolen property that was at Mr.\nHolland’s that . . . went to other people that [were] in the community.” In August 2013,\nMr. Nettles began conducting “computer intel work” on individuals who were supposed\nto be in possession of stolen property they received from Mr. Holland. Mr. Nettles\nattempted to find them, interview them, and tie the stolen items “back to Mr. Holland and\nsee what it had to do with [Petitioner].” Mr. Nettles noted that Mr. Holland made\nstatements to the Warren County Sheriff’s Department and the McMinnville City Police\nDepartment indicating that he was involved “in this stolen property.” Following\nPetitioner’s plea, Mr. Nettles took the information about Mr. Holland that he found\nthrough his investigation to the Coffee County Sheriff’s Department.\n\n        Mr. Nettles recalled that he received letters from Petitioner, and he met with\nPetitioner’s parents multiple times. Additionally, Petitioner’s parents indicated to Mr.\nNettles that they were communicating with Petitioner regarding his cases during their\nprison visitations. Mr. Nettles testified that he learned on September 3, 2013, that the\nState intended to take case number F-13913 to trial first, and Mr. Stanford instructed him\nto focus on that case. Mr. Nettles agreed that Mr. Holland had given two statements to\nlaw enforcement regarding stolen property, but he stated that Mr. Holland “[d]idn’t have\nanything to do with the burglary from [F-]13913.” Mr. Nettles explained, “I had\n[Petitioner’s] theory about what happened [in case number F-13913]. So I began to\ninvestigate it.” He interviewed Sandy Bratcher and obtained a statement from her in\nOctober 2013. Petitioner told Mr. Nettles that Ms. Bratcher was present on the night\nPetitioner allegedly burglarized the victim’s home. However, when Mr. Nettles spoke to\nher, Ms. Bratcher denied knowing Petitioner. Mr. Nettles stated that he had known that\nMs. Bratcher had been in jail in Warren County, but he was unaware of the nature of the\ncharges. Mr. Nettles explained that he also interviewed another potential witness, Sheila\nThompson.\n\n       Mr. Nettles recalled that Petitioner was “very specific” in the information that he\nprovided Mr. Nettles and Mr. Stanford. Mr. Nettles said that eventually some stolen\nproperty was recovered, but he could not recall “which burglaries they came from[.]”\nMr. Nettles investigated Petitioner’s cases for about sixty hours prior to Petitioner’s\n                                           -9-\n\fentering a plea. Mr. Nettles explained that Petitioner’s parents paid him additional\nmoney after Petitioner’s plea to locate more of the stolen property, hoping that it would\n“help [Petitioner] get parole.” Accordingly, Mr. Nettles pursued the information received\nfrom Petitioner with the Coffee County Sheriff’s Department. Mr. Nettles explained that\nthe property eventually recovered was not the stolen property at issue in case number F-\n13913. Mr. Nettles stated that Mr. Holland was later indicted based on the information\nprovided by Petitioner.\n\n       Barry McCormick testified that he first met Petitioner in December 2012, at the\nWarren County Jail. Mr. McCormick explained that he was Petitioner’s cellmate for\nseveral months. He recalled that Petitioner was “just emotionally wrecked” one day,\nafter Petitioner spoke to Investigator Rowland and Mr. Roller. Mr. McCormick claimed\nthat Petitioner began hallucinating, hearing voices, and Petitioner was paranoid that\nothers were going to hurt him. Mr. McCormick recalled that Petitioner was sent to\nsegregation for a few days after this event.\n\n       Dr. David Solovey, an expert in clinical psychology, testified that he had been\nhired to conduct a mental evaluation of Petitioner prior to the post-conviction hearing.\nDr. Solovey stated that he conducted the seven-and-a-half-hour evaluation on November\n21, 2015. He interviewed Petitioner at the Bledsoe Correctional Complex, and he also\nreviewed “some extensive mental health records” that were obtained from the Social\nSecurity Administration and prior treatment facilities. Dr. Solovey testified that his\nreview of the records showed that Petitioner had a “significant history dating back to\nelementary school.” From 1999 to 2012, Petitioner had twenty-one psychiatric\nhospitalizations. The records indicated that Petitioner had “a variety of diagnoses\nranging from psychosis, suicidal depression, paranoia, post-traumatic stress disorder,\n[and] chemical dependency.” Dr. Solovey testified that Petitioner had been prescribed\nmood stabilizers, anti-depressants, and anti-psychotic medications at various times\nthroughout his life.\n\n       Dr. Solovey stated that he diagnosed Petitioner as having a “schizoaffective\ndisorder which can be called a number of different things like bipolar disorder or mood\ndisorder and their underlying psychotic processes.” According to Dr. Solovey, Petitioner\nprovided a history of the days leading up to his entering the plea—“a Thursday, Friday,\nand then a weekend and then a Monday.” Petitioner reported that it was a “very\nstressful” time and that he felt increasing stress and pressure to enter the plea. Petitioner\nexplained to Dr. Solovey:\n\n       Well, it was at first before it started he was fairly uplifted thinking that\n       things were going to be okay and then the police started coming in and\n       there was some reference to ATF and then the potential threat of having\n                                           - 10 -\n\f       something even worse occur, wasn’t allowed to talk to his parents. He\n       wanted to talk to them to at least get some neutral person to discuss what it\n       was all about and he felt there was just an absolute I have to do this or else.\n\n       According to Dr. Solovey, Petitioner reported that he was taking an anti-\ndepressant while in prison, but he was not receiving an anti-psychotic medication. Dr.\nSolovey stated that the lack of medication would have “really ma[d]e things much more\ndifficult for [Petitioner].” Dr. Solovey opined that Petitioner’s repeated hospitalizations\nshould have been “red flags” for counsel indicating that Petitioner needed to be evaluated\nfor competency to stand trial and to determine Petitioner’s mental health status at the time\nof his plea “to see whether it would be knowingly and fully reasonably entered.” The\nfollowing exchange occurred during Dr. Solovey’s direct examination:\n\n              Q. And sir, also pursuant to your evaluation you formed an opinion\n       as to whether [Petitioner’s] guilty pleas were knowingly and voluntarily\n       entered, did you not?\n\n               A. I feel the pressure was there. He was poorly medicated and given\n       that history that was just ever present that I think a full psychiatric\n       evaluation or psychological forensic evaluation would have been relevant at\n       least to determine that.\n\nWhen asked again if Petitioner’s plea was knowing and voluntary, Dr. Solvey responded\nthat Petitioner “needed quite a bit more to really fully consider that before standing\nbefore court.”\n\n       On cross-examination, Dr. Solovey acknowledged that the medical records\nindicated various treatment plans for Petitioner, which were appropriate for Petitioner’s\ndiagnosis. Dr. Solovey also stated that the results of his evaluation reflected Petitioner’s\ncondition on November 21, 2015, but that the results were consistent with Petitioner’s\nhistory. Dr. Solovey tested Petitioner for competency to stand trial and found that\nPetitioner was competent. He agreed that factors contributing to Petitioner’s competency\nwere the structured prison environment and being properly medicated. Dr. Solovey\nagreed that Petitioner’s medical records indicated that Petitioner was being properly\nmedicated prior to his plea, but Petitioner told Dr. Solovey that he was un-medicated on\nthe day of the plea. Dr. Solovey opined that Petitioner had the capacity to understand\nwhat would be in his “best interest” but that,\n\n       when that agreement was made that was not a good time for [Petitioner],\n       that was not what you would call a reasonable . . . appropriate time where\n       he could fully consider everything that was going on and everything that\n                                           - 11 -\n\f       was involved with his plea, that he was probably . . . quite disturbed at that\n       time.\n\n        Petitioner’s father, Rodney Aho, testified that Petitioner had mental health\nproblems beginning at an early age. Mr. Aho agreed that Petitioner also struggled with\ndrug addictions and had a lengthy criminal record. Mr. Aho testified that he told Mr.\nSharp, Mr. Roller, and Mr. Stanford about Petitioner’s mental health issues. He stated\nthat Mr. Roller’s representation of Petitioner ended on bad terms, and Mr. Aho filed an\nethical complaint against Mr. Roller with the BPR; Mr. Roller had to provide Mr. Aho a\nrefund of $3,700 as a result of the complaint. Mr. Aho recalled that he offered to set up a\nphone account for Mr. Nettles to talk to Petitioner, but Mr. Nettles said that “it wasn’t\nnecessary now.” Mr. Aho stated that the only direct communication Petitioner had with\nMr. Nettles and Mr. Stanford before January 2014 was the three-hour meeting at the\nprison in West Tennessee. Mr. Aho recalled that, after Petitioner was transported to the\nWarren County Jail in January 2014, he was able to speak to Petitioner over the telephone\nat least two times before Petitioner entered his guilty plea. However, Mr. Aho explained,\n“We really didn’t talk about a plea agreement. We . . . knew he was really upset and he\nsaid, [‘T]hey’re not working with us, they’re not going to give us what we want.[’]”\nDuring his phone calls with Petitioner before the plea, Mr. Aho “could tell [Petitioner]\nwas stressed out and ready to cry[.]” Mr. Aho testified, “I think [Petitioner] felt at that\ntime that [Mr.] Stanford wasn’t going to do anything for him, wasn’t going to go to trial.”\nHe claimed that he had very little communication with Mr. Nettles and Mr. Stanford,\nalthough he recalled at least one meeting with Mr. Nettles at the Aho’s residence. Mr.\nAho also met with Mr. Nettles at least three times at Mr. Nettles’ office, and he met with\nMr. Stanford two or three times at Mr. Stanford’s office. Mr. Aho stated that he paid Mr.\nNettles additional money after Petitioner’s plea to further investigate items of stolen\nproperty, which led to Mr. Holland’s arrest and conviction.\n\n        Petitioner testified that he “had no choice” when he entered best interest pleas in\ncase number F-13913 and F-13974. Mr. Sharp initially represented Petitioner, and\nPetitioner informed Mr. Sharp of his mental health history. Petitioner also told Mr. Sharp\nthat he had information that would help the State prosecute other cases. At Petitioner’s\narraignment hearing, Mr. Sharp told Petitioner to share the information with the State.\nLater, Mr. Sharp visited Petitioner while Petitioner was incarcerated in the Warren\nCounty Jail. Petitioner testified that, during this visit, Mr. Sharp told Petitioner that he\n“ran his mouth too much” while they were standing at the booking area. Petitioner\ntestified that, after this interaction, he ended Mr. Sharp’s representation. Petitioner spoke\nwith Mr. Roller about representing him, and he informed Mr. Roller of his mental health\nhistory. Petitioner informed Mr. Roller that he was receiving treatment for depression,\nbipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Mr. Roller did not advise that\nPetitioner should receive a forensic evaluation. Petitioner asked Mr. Roller to schedule a\n                                           - 12 -\n\fmeeting with the State and gave Mr. Roller a letter from Barry McCormick that discussed\nthe location of stolen property. Petitioner gave Mr. Roller the letter hoping that the State\nwould recover the stolen property and charge Mr. Holland. Petitioner testified that Mr.\nRoller did not use the letter in his case. Petitioner stated that Mr. Roller’s inaction made\nhim feel helpless, and he did not have confidence in Mr. Roller’s representation.\nPetitioner testified that he never received discovery until he ended Mr. Roller’s\nrepresentation.\n\n       On February 15, 2013, Mr. Roller brought two investigators to meet with\nPetitioner at the jail. Petitioner hoped to arrange for immunity in exchange for the\ninformation he had about the stolen property; however, no agreement was reached.\nPetitioner told the investigators about seeing Mr. Holland with the stolen property, and\nMr. Roller never advised him to end the interview. At Petitioner’s arraignment hearing\non February 27, 2013, Mr. Roller said he would visit Petitioner, but he did not. Mr.\nRoller met with Petitioner on March 15, 2013, and after this meeting, Petitioner\n“snapped” and became depressed and paranoid. Petitioner believed that other inmates\nwere going to attack him, and he was placed in solitary confinement for seven days. On\nApril 5, 2013, Petitioner met with Mr. Roller for the last time. At this meeting, Mr.\nRoller gave Petitioner his discovery. Petitioner testified that Mr. Roller only investigated\none witness, Monica Burgess, for his cases.\n\n        Petitioner’s parents later hired Mr. Stanford to represent him. Mr. Stanford and\nthe defense investigator, Mr. Nettles, met with Petitioner while he was incarcerated in\nWest Tennessee in August 2013. Petitioner informed Mr. Stanford that he was taking\nPaxil for his mental health issues. Mr. Stanford discussed with Petitioner whether\nPetitioner should testify at trial, but Mr. Stanford did not file a motion to limit the State’s\nability to impeach Petitioner with his prior convictions. Petitioner believed that his cases\nwere proceeding to trial, and he asked Mr. Stanford to follow leads regarding the stolen\nproperty. The only contact that Petitioner received from Mr. Stanford between the initial\nmeeting and his plea submission was a letter that Mr. Stanford wrote to the State\nrequesting to extend the trial date and to conduct fingerprint testing. On November 20,\n2013, Petitioner wrote a letter to Mr. Stanford asking Mr. Stanford to investigate the\nstolen property tied to Mr. Holland and requesting a mental health evaluation. Mr.\nStanford never responded to this letter. In January 2015, Petitioner was transferred to the\nWarren County Jail for his trial. Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles met with Petitioner on\nJanuary 22, 2015. During this meeting, Petitioner believed that he was going to trial, and\nhe felt that a positive outcome was likely. Mr. Stanford conveyed a plea agreement to the\nPetitioner with a twenty-five year sentence. Petitioner also discussed his other cases with\nMr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles.\n\n\n\n                                            - 13 -\n\f       The next day, Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles met with Petitioner again, and Mr.\nNettles told Petitioner that he could receive federal charges for gun offenses. Mr.\nStanford conveyed a new plea agreement to the Petitioner for a sentence of thirty years.\nRegarding his mental state at this time, the Petitioner stated, “[T]he way they pushed it\nand switched up on me there was no way in the world I could have went to court with\nthem to represent me and come out good. I would have been done [sic] worse than what\nthey were trying to do.” Mr. Nettles informed Petitioner that he had not subpoenaed any\nwitnesses. Petitioner stated that he felt that he had no choice but to enter a plea.\nPetitioner began to sign the plea but asked to speak with his parents. Mr. Stanford\ncontacted the State, and around 3:27 p.m., Mr. Stanford informed Petitioner that the trial\ncourt stated that the plea needed to be submitted by 4:00 p.m. Petitioner agreed that, at\nthe plea submission hearing, he testified that he “thoroughly” discussed the plea\nagreement with Mr. Stanford. Petitioner noted that he had never proceeded to trial on\nany of his previous criminal charges.\n\n       On cross-examination, Petitioner agreed that he had a lengthy criminal history.\nPetitioner also agreed that he understood the State’s allegations in case numbers F-13913\nand F-13974. Petitioner agreed that he discussed these charges with his three attorneys.\nPetitioner agreed that a witness in case number F-13913 had observed him at the offense\nscene and identified him at the preliminary hearing. He also agreed that this witness\ncould have testified at his trial. Petitioner stated that, when he signed the plea agreement\ndocuments, he understood what the terms of the agreement were. Petitioner agreed that\nhe testified during the plea submission hearing that no one had promised or threatened\nanything to coerce him into entering a plea. On redirect examination, Petitioner testified\nthat he did not voluntarily enter his plea.\n\n        At the conclusion of the hearing, the post-conviction court found that Petitioner’s\nfirst two attorneys did not affect Petitioner’s case. The post-conviction court also found\nthat there was no evidence that “that Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles could have provided\nsome witnesses or statements or something to [Petitioner] or to the court that would have\nsignificantly changed the outcome of the case as far as what they discovered.” The post-\nconviction court found that Mr. Stanford was prepared for trial and that Mr. Nettles was\nprepared to subpoena a defense witness to testify at trial. The post-conviction court\nfurther noted that Mr. Stanford and the State agreed to continue Petitioner’s trial if\nPetitioner rejected the plea agreement and that the trial court would not have opposed this\nagreement to continue. The post-conviction court found that there was no evidence that\nwitnesses existed that could have testified at trial to impeach the State’s witnesses. The\npost-conviction court found that Mr. Stanford’s representation was deficient for failing to\nfile a motion to exclude Petitioner’s prior record for impeachment purposes. However,\nthe post-conviction court concluded that the motion would not have affected Petitioner’s\n\n                                           - 14 -\n\fcase because some of Petitioner’s prior convictions were admissible. The post-conviction\ncourt concluded that Petitioner did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n        Regarding the voluntariness of Petitioner’s plea, the post-conviction court found\nthat Petitioner appeared to be competent when he entered his best interest plea. The post-\nconviction court also found that, during the plea submission hearing, Petitioner “was very\nalert and understanding and there was no question that he appeared to know what he was\ndoing.” The post-conviction court noted that Dr. Solovey testified that Petitioner had\ndepression, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. However, the post-\nconviction court concluded that Mr. Stanford’s representation was not ineffective for\nfailing to request a mental health evaluation for Petitioner “because he didn’t see\nanything that caused him to believe that [Petitioner] was not competent.”\n\n       Following the hearing, the post-conviction court entered a written order of its\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law and denied post-conviction relief. This timely\nappeal follows.\n\nAnalysis\n\n        On appeal, Petitioner contends that Mr. Stanford rendered ineffective assistance\nbased on counsel’s failure to issue subpoenas, file motions, and respond to the State’s\nmotion to use Petitioner’s prior convictions as impeachment evidence. Additionally,\nPetitioner alleges that he gave Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles “the tools they needed to\nsecure a sound defense” by providing them with information about Mr. Holland but that\nMr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles failed to investigate that lead until after Petitioner’s plea.\nPetitioner further asserts that Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles used unreasonable persuasion\nto get Petitioner to sign the agreement. Petitioner asserts that they threatened him with a\nfederal firearms charge if he did not accept the State’s offer when “[l]ittle to no proof was\navailable to the government to support such a charge[,]” and Mr. Stanford failed to relay\nto Petitioner the possibility of a continuance. The State responds that the post-conviction\ncourt properly denied Petitioner relief on his claim that his plea was involuntarily and\nunknowingly entered due to ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n       Post-conviction relief is available when a “conviction or sentence is void or\nvoidable because of the abridgment of any right guaranteed by the Constitution of\nTennessee or the Constitution of the United States.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-103. In\norder to prevail on a petition for post-conviction relief, a petitioner must prove all factual\nallegations by clear and convincing evidence. Jaco v. State, 120 S.W.3d 828, 830 (Tenn.\n2003). Post-conviction relief cases often present mixed questions of law and fact. See\nFields v. State, 40 S.W.3d 450, 458 (Tenn. 2001). Appellate courts are bound by the\npost-conviction court’s factual findings unless the evidence preponderates against such\n                                            - 15 -\n\ffindings. Kendrick v. State, 454 S.W.3d 450, 457 (Tenn. 2015). When reviewing the\npost-conviction court’s factual findings, this court does not reweigh the evidence or\nsubstitute its own inferences for those drawn by the post-conviction court. Id.; Fields, 40\nS.W.3d at 456 (citing Henley v. State, 960 S.W.2d 572, 578 (Tenn. 1997)). Additionally,\n“questions concerning the credibility of the witnesses, the weight and value to be given\ntheir testimony, and the factual issues raised by the evidence are to be resolved by the\n[post-conviction court].” Fields, 40 S.W.3d at 456 (citing Henley, 960 S.W.2d at 579);\nsee also Kendrick, 454 S.W.3d at 457. The trial court’s conclusions of law and\napplication of the law to factual findings are reviewed de novo with no presumption of\ncorrectness. Kendrick, 454 S.W.3d at 457.\n\n         The right to effective assistance of counsel is safeguarded by the Constitutions of\nboth the United States and the State of Tennessee. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Tenn. Const.\nart. I, § 9. In order to receive post-conviction relief for ineffective assistance of counsel,\na petitioner must prove: (1) that counsel’s performance was deficient; and (2) that the\ndeficiency prejudiced the defense. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984);\nsee State v. Taylor, 968 S.W.2d 900, 905 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1997) (stating that the same\nstandard for ineffective assistance of counsel applies in both federal and Tennessee\ncases). Both factors must be proven in order for the court to grant post-conviction relief.\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 687; Henley, 960 S.W.2d at 580; Goad v. State, 938 S.W.2d 363,\n370 (Tenn. 1996). Accordingly, if we determine that either factor is not satisfied, there is\nno need to consider the other factor. Finch v. State, 226 S.W.3d 307, 316 (Tenn. 2007)\n(citing Carpenter v. State, 126 S.W.3d 879, 886 (Tenn. 2004)). Additionally, review of\ncounsel’s performance “requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting\neffects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel’s challenged conduct,\nand to evaluate the conduct from counsel’s perspective at the time.” Strickland, 466 U.S.\nat 689; see also Henley, 960 S.W.2d at 579. We will not second-guess a reasonable trial\nstrategy, and we will not grant relief based on a sound, yet ultimately unsuccessful,\ntactical decision. Granderson v. State, 197 S.W.3d 782, 790 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2006).\n\n        As to the first prong of the Strickland analysis, “counsel’s performance is effective\nif the advice given or the services rendered are within the range of competence demanded\nof attorneys in criminal cases.” Henley, 960 S.W.2d at 579 (citing Baxter v. Rose, 523\nS.W.2d 930, 936 (Tenn. 1975)); see also Goad, 938 S.W.2d at 369. In order to prove that\ncounsel was deficient, the petitioner must demonstrate “that counsel’s acts or omissions\nwere so serious as to fall below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing\nprofessional norms.” Goad, 938 S.W.2d at 369 (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688); see\nalso Baxter, 523 S.W.2d at 936.\n\n       Even if counsel’s performance is deficient, the deficiency must have resulted in\nprejudice to the defense. Goad, 938 S.W.2d at 370. Therefore, under the second prong\n                                            - 16 -\n\fof the Strickland analysis, the petitioner “must show that there is a reasonable probability\nthat, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in\nthe outcome.” Id. (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n       A substantially similar two-prong standard applies when the petitioner challenges\ncounsel’s performance in the context of a guilty plea. Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 58\n(1985); Don Allen Rodgers v. State, No. W2011-00632-CCA-R3-PC, 2012 WL 1478764,\nat *4 (Tenn. Crim. App. April 26, 2012), no perm app. filed. First, the petitioner must\nshow that his counsel’s performance fell below the objective standards of reasonableness\nand professional norms. See Hill, 474 U.S. at 58. Second, “in order to satisfy the\n‘prejudice’ requirement, the [petitioner] must show that there is a reasonable probability\nthat, but for counsel’s errors, he would have not have pleaded guilty and would have\ninsisted on going to trial.” Id. at 59.\n\n       Whether a guilty plea is intelligent and voluntary is a mixed question of law and\nfact. Jaco, 120 S.W.3d at 830-31. Therefore, in such cases we review the post-\nconviction court’s findings of fact de novo with a presumption of correctness. Id. The\npost-conviction court’s findings of law are reviewed purely de novo. Id.\n\n       When reviewing a guilty plea, this court looks to both the federal standard as\nannounced in the landmark case Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238 (1969), and the state\nstandard as announced in State v. Mackey, 553 S.W.2d 337 (Tenn. 1977), superseded on\nother grounds by Tenn. R. Crim. P. 37(b) and Tenn. R. App. P. 3(b). Don Allen Rodgers,\n2012 WL 1478764, at *5. Under the federal standard, there must be an affirmative\nshowing that the plea was “intelligent and voluntary.” Boykin, 395 U.S. at 242.\nLikewise, the Tennessee Supreme Court has held that “the record of acceptance of a\ndefendant’s plea of guilty must affirmatively demonstrate that his decision was both\nvoluntary and knowledgeable, i.e. that he has been made aware of the significant\nconsequences of such a plea . . . .” Mackey, 553 S.W.2d at 340. “[A] plea is not\n‘voluntary’ if it is the product of ‘[i]gnorance, incomprehension, coercion, terror,\ninducements, [or] subtle or blatant threats . . . .” Blankenship v. State, 858 S.W.2d 897,\n904 (Tenn. 1993) (quoting Boykin, 395 U.S. at 242-43).\n\n       In order to determine whether a plea is intelligent and voluntary, the trial court\nmust “canvass[] the matter with the accused to make sure he has a full understanding of\nwhat the plea connotes and of its consequence.” Boykin, 395 U.S. at 244. The trial court\nlooks to several factors before accepting a plea, including:\n\n\n\n                                           - 17 -\n\f       [T]he relative intelligence of the defendant; degree of his familiarity with\n       criminal proceedings; whether he was represented by competent counsel\n       and had the opportunity to confer with counsel about the options available\n       to him; the extent of advice from counsel and the court concerning the\n       charges against him; and the reasons for his decision to plead guilty,\n       including a desire to avoid a greater penalty that might result from a jury\n       trial.\n\nBlankenship, 858 S.W.2d at 904; Howell v. State, 185 S.W.3d 319, 330-31 (Tenn. 2006).\nOnce the trial court has conducted a proper plea colloquy, it discharges its duty to assess\nthe voluntary and intelligent nature of the plea and creates an adequate record for any\nsubsequent review. Boykin, 395 U.S. at 244.\n\n       Statements made by a petitioner, his attorney, and the prosecutor during the plea\ncolloquy, as well as any findings made by the trial court in accepting the plea, “constitute\na formidable barrier in any subsequent collateral proceedings.” Blackledge v. Allison,\n431 U.S. 63, 73-74 (1977). Statements made in open court carry a strong presumption of\ntruth, and to overcome such presumption, a petitioner must present more than\n“conculsory allegations unsupported by specifics.” Id. at 74.\n\nIneffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n       Petitioner contends that Mr. Stanford rendered ineffective assistance based on\ncounsel’s failure to adequately prepare for trial. He asserts that Mr. Stanford failed to\nissue subpoenas, investigate Mr. Holland, and respond to the State’s motion to use\nPetitioner’s prior convictions as impeachment evidence.\n\n       The record reflects that, after they were retained, Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles\nobtained a copy of the State’s discovery and met with Petitioner for three hours.\nPetitioner was adamant that Mr. Holland was criminally responsible for the offenses\npending against Petitioner. Based on Petitioner’s assertions regarding Mr. Holland’s\ninvolvement, Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles investigated people “surrounding Joe\nHolland.” Mr. Stanford believed that it would be helpful to talk to Mr. Holland’s\nassociates because they might be more willing to share information that Mr. Holland was\nthe person who had committed the crimes. Mr. Nettles spent over sixty hours\ninvestigating Petitioner’s cases prior to the plea. Mr. Nettles interviewed multiple\nwitnesses, including Sandy Bratcher, Monica Burgess, and Sheila Thompson. He\nconducted “computer intel work” on the individuals who were supposed to be in\npossession of stolen items received from Mr. Holland. Mr. Nettles attempted to find\nthem, interview them, and tie the stolen items “back to Mr. Holland and see what it had to\ndo with [Petitioner].” Mr. Nettles agreed that Mr. Holland was later indicted based on the\n                                           - 18 -\n\finformation provided by Petitioner, but he stated that Mr. Holland “[d]idn’t have\nanything to do with the burglary from [F-]13913.” He explained that the property\neventually recovered was not the stolen property at issue in case number F-13913.\n\n        When the State elected to proceed to trial first on case number F-13913, Mr.\nStanford testified that he made a “strategic decision” that he and Mr. Nettles needed to\nfocus the investigation on the individuals involved in that case. Mr. Stanford recalled\nthat the victim in case number F-13913 was “clear as [] could be that it was [Petitioner]”\nwho had been in her driveway. Mr. Stanford met with Petitioner at the Warren County\nJail after Petitioner was transferred to the jail about a week before trial. He met with\nPetitioner “several times in a three[-]day period” to prepare Petitioner for trial. Mr.\nStanford explained that he had not subpoenaed witnesses because the defense\ninvestigation did not discover any witnesses other than Shelia Thompson and character\nwitnesses like Petitioner’s parents. He explained that Ms. Thompson was the only\nwitness that the defense could find that corroborated Petitioner’s version of events, but\nshe would have “basically regurgitated . . . what [Petitioner] had told her[.]” Mr.\nStanford testified that he approached the State about a potential plea agreement and\nworked for several days with the prosecutor to reach an agreement that was in\nPetitioner’s best interest. Mr. Stanford testified that he knew the prosecutor would not\nobject to a continuance of the trial if plea negotiations broke down, and Mr. Stanford told\nPetitioner about a possible continuance.\n\n        We agree with the post-conviction court that Mr. Stanford was prepared for trial\nand was prepared to subpoena at least one witness to testify on Petitioner’s behalf if the\ncase went to trial. Mr. Stanford communicated to Petitioner that the State agreed to\ncontinue Petitioner’s trial if Petitioner rejected the plea agreement and that the trial court\nwould not have opposed this agreement to continue. Moreover, the record shows that\nPetitioner’s defense team adequately investigated the background of Mr. Holland, and\nMr. Stanford was prepared to effectively cross-examine him. Petitioner failed to\nestablish or explain how evidence of Mr. Holland’s apparent involvement in some of the\nthefts would have affected his decision to go to trial in case number F-13913. Mr. Nettles\ntestified that Mr. Holland had no involvement in case number F-13913, and Mr. Stanford\nstated that the victim in that case was “clear as [she] could be that it was [Petitioner]”\nwho had been in her driveway at the time of the burglary. Although in his brief Petitioner\ncharacterizes Mr. Holland as a key witness for the State in case number F-13974, the\nevidence presented at the hearing fails to establish this claim. Moreover, it is not clear\nfrom the record what additional charges Petitioner was facing in case numbers F-13975,\nF-13976, and F-13977, which were dismissed by the State as part of Petitioner’s plea\nagreement, or the strength of the evidence against Petitioner in those cases. It is,\ntherefore, impossible for this court to conclude that but for trial counsel’s alleged errors,\n\n                                            - 19 -\n\fPetitioner “would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial” in\nthese cases. Hill, 474 U.S. at 59. Petitioner is not entitled to relief.\n\n       Regarding Petitioner’s claim that Mr. Stanford was ineffective for failing to\nrespond to the State’s motion to use Petitioner’s prior convictions as impeachment\nevidence, the post-conviction court concluded that Mr. Stanford’s performance was\ndeficient but that Petitioner was not prejudiced “because some, if not several, of\nPetitioner’s prior convictions would have been allowed by the [trial court] for\nimpeachment.” We agree with the post-conviction court’s assessment that Petitioner\nfailed to establish prejudice. The State’s “Notice of Intent to Use Conviction for\nImpeachment” reflects that Petitioner had a total of thirty-two prior convictions, the\nmajority of which were felony convictions. The Petitioner failed to establish that, had\nMr. Stanford filed a motion challenging the State’s notice, the trial court would have\nprecluded the State’s use of Petitioner’s prior convictions as impeachment. Accordingly,\nPetitioner has not shown that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, and he is\nnot entitled to relief.\n\nUnknowing and Involuntary Guilty Plea\n\n       Petitioner further asserts that trial counsel and the defense investigator used\nunreasonable persuasion to get Petitioner to sign the agreement. Petitioner asserts that\nthey threatened him with a federal firearms charge if he did not accept the State’s offer\nwhen “[l]ittle to no proof was available to the government to support such a charge.”\n\n        Here, the record reflects that, during the defense investigation, Mr. Stanford and\nMr. Nettles learned that the State had a witness that would testify that Petitioner had\npossession of a weapon. Mr. Stanford explained that the witness indicated Petitioner\ntried to give her two firearms, which were a part of one of the cases pending against\nPetitioner. Because of his substantial practice in federal court, Mr. Stanford was “very\nconcerned” that the federal prosecutors might seek to charge Petitioner under the Armed\nCareer Criminal Act, in which case Petitioner “would have been looking at . . . probably\n[thirty] to life.” When Mr. Stanford approached the State about plea negotiations, Mr.\nStanford had a “gentlemen’s agreement” with the prosecutor that the prosecutor would\nnot report the firearms offense to the federal prosecutors. Mr. Stanford indicated that this\nwas a “big part” of why Petitioner chose to plead guilty to the two indictments.\n\n        The guilty plea hearing transcript reflects that, when questioned by the trial court,\nPetitioner agreed that he went over the plea documents in both cases “thoroughly” with\ntrial counsel. Petitioner testified that he understood the nature of the charges to which the\npleas were offered, the minimum and maximum sentence on each charge if convicted, his\nright to counsel at every stage of the proceedings, his right to plead not guilty, his right to\n                                            - 20 -\n\fa jury trial, his right to confront adverse witnesses and bring his own witnesses, his right\nto remain silent, and his right to appeal any resulting conviction or sentence. In accepting\nthe terms of the plea agreement, Petitioner affirmed that he was waiving each of those\nrights. He also agreed that he was entering his pleas freely and voluntarily. Petitioner\ndenied that he was entering the pleas because he had been threatened to do so. The trial\ncourt found that Petitioner understood his rights and made a knowing, voluntary, and\nunderstanding waiver of his rights by pleading guilty.\n\n        Upon review, we agree with the post-conviction court’s assessment that\nPetitioner’s best interest pleas were entered knowingly and voluntarily. Mr. Stanford\ntestified that Petitioner was able to write very coherently, was able to pass along volumes\nof information to him about the cases (such as specific times and the people involved),\nunderstood the potential sentences he was facing, and understood that additional charges\ncould possibly result from his alleged possession of a firearm based on his previous\nfelony convictions. Petitioner declared in open court that his plea was knowing and\nvoluntary, and the post-conviction court recalled that the Petitioner was very alert during\nsaid plea process such that there was no question that he appeared to know and\nunderstand what he was doing. The record also shows that Petitioner had a very\nextensive criminal record and great familiarity with the criminal justice system.\nPetitioner entered his guilty plea to avoid a greater penalty that might have resulted had\nPetitioner’s cases proceeded to trial, as well as to avoid the possibility of a federal\nfirearms charge. That Petitioner was facing the possibility of a lengthier sentence if\nconvicted at trial did not render his plea involuntary. See Blankenship, 858 S.W.2d at\n904. Under the totality of the circumstances, Petitioner’s plea was knowingly and\nvoluntarily entered. He is not entitled to post-conviction relief on this claim.\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n       Based on the foregoing reasoning and authorities, we affirm the post-conviction\ncourt’s denial of Petitioner’s petition for post-conviction relief.\n\n\n                                              ____________________________________\n                                              ROBERT L.

STATE OF TENNESSEE\n\n                 Appeal from the Circuit Court for Warren County\n                Nos. F-13913, F-13974    Larry B. Stanley, Jr., Judge\n                      ___________________________________\n\n                           Nos. M2017-00163-CCA-R3-PC\n                       ___________________________________\n\n\nIn 2012, the Warren County Grand Jury indicted Petitioner, Ronald Henry Aho, in case\nnumber F-13913 for aggravated burglary and theft of property over $1,000 but less than\n$10,000. Petitioner was also indicted in case number F-13974 for two counts each of\naggravated burglary and theft of property over $1,000 but less than $10,000. In January\n2014, Petitioner entered best interest guilty pleas in case numbers F-13913 and F-13974\nto a total of two counts of aggravated burglary and two counts of theft over $1,000 but\nless than $10,000 in exchange for the dismissal of the remaining charges and the\ndismissal of charges contained in three additional indictments. Pursuant to the plea\nagreement, Petitioner was sentenced to serve a total effective sentence of twenty-three\nyears, with the first fifteen years to be served at sixty percent release eligibility and the\nlast eight years to be served at forty-five percent release eligibility. Petitioner filed a\npetition for post-conviction relief, alleging that he received ineffective assistance of\ncounsel and that his pleas were unknowingly and involuntarily entered. Following an\nevidentiary hearing, the post-conviction court denied relief. After review, we affirm the\njudgment of the post-conviction court.\n\n  Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Circuit Court Affirmed\n\nROBERT L. HOLLOWAY, JR., delivered the opinion of the court, in which THOMAS T.\nWOODALL, P.J., and TIMOTHY L. EASTER, J., joined.\n\nG. Jeff Cherry and Christopher Beauchamp (on appeal), Lebanon, Tennessee, and\nSamuel F. Hudson (at hearing), Dunlap, Tennessee, for the appellant, Ronald Henry Aho.\n\nHerbert H. Slatery III, Attorney General and Reporter; Sophia S. Lee, Senior Counsel;\nLisa Zavogiannis, District Attorney General; and Randal Gilliam, Assistant District\nAttorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\f                                       OPINION\n\nPlea Submission Hearing\n\n        On January 29, 2014, Petitioner entered a best interest guilty plea, as a Career\nOffender, to aggravated burglary and theft over $1,000 in case number F-13913 and\nreceived concurrent sentences of fifteen years and twelve years, respectively, to serve in\nthe Department of Correction. In case number F-13974, Petitioner entered a best interest\nguilty plea, as a Range III Persistent Offender, to one count each of aggravated burglary\nand theft over $1,000. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Petitioner received concurrent\nsentences of eight years with forty-five percent release eligibility on each count to be\nserved consecutively to his effective fifteen-year sentence with a sixty percent release\neligibility in case number F-13913, for a total effective sentence of twenty-three years in\nthe Department of Correction. Based on Petitioner’s plea, the State dismissed the two\nremaining counts in case number F-13974, as well as the charges against Petitioner in\ncase numbers F-13975, F-13976, and F-13977.\n\n       At the plea submission hearing, the State recited the following factual basis for\ncase number F-13913:\n\n       [O]n October 18 of 2012, the State’s proof would have been that\n       [Petitioner] broke into a home on Spring Street here in Warren County\n       owned by Ms. Sheila Bates. Once inside, [he] obtained several items of\n       property including several items of jewelry with a combined value in\n       excess of a thousand dollars. [He] [l]eft the house with those items and was\n       able to elude the police in that incident.\n\n       The State recited the facts of case number F-13974, as follows:\n\n       [A] burglary [also] occurred [] on October 18 of 2012 of a house on 70\n       Underwood Road. Taken during that burglary were a Nintendo Wii, a\n       PlayStation 2, approximately 100 DVD and BluRay videos, an HP Compaq\n       notebook computer, a quantity of oxycodone and several other items and\n       that burglary and theft occurred here in Warren County. The State’s proof\n       would be that a short time later [Petitioner] was found in possession of that\n       stolen property.\n\n       ....\n\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\f       The State’s proof . . . would be . . . that they were found at a residence that\n       [Petitioner] was associated with and there would have been proof linking\n       him to that property.\n\n       When questioned by the trial court, Petitioner agreed that he went over the plea\ndocuments in both cases “thoroughly” with trial counsel. Petitioner testified that he\nunderstood the nature of the charges to which the pleas were offered, the minimum and\nmaximum sentence on each charge if convicted, his right to counsel at every stage of the\nproceedings, his right to plead not guilty, his right to a jury trial, his right to confront\nadverse witnesses and bring his own witnesses, his right to remain silent, and his right to\nappeal any resulting conviction or sentence. In accepting the terms of the plea\nagreement, Petitioner affirmed that he was waiving each of those rights. He also agreed\nthat he was entering his pleas freely and voluntarily. Petitioner denied that he was\nentering the pleas because he had been threatened to do so. The trial court found that\nPetitioner understood his rights and made a knowing, voluntary, and understanding\nwaiver of his rights by pleading guilty. The trial court additionally found that there was a\nfactual basis for Petitioner’s pleas.\n\nPost-Conviction Proceedings\n\n        On January 30, 2015, Petitioner filed a timely pro se petition for post-conviction\nrelief, asserting that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel and that his best\ninterest plea was unknowing and involuntary due to Petitioner’s mental incompetence.\nOn February 8, 2015, the post-conviction court entered a preliminary order appointing\ncounsel for Petitioner. Petitioner later retained counsel to represent him. On May 27,\n2015, Petitioner, through counsel, filed an amended petition for post-conviction relief.\n\n       At an evidentiary hearing on the petition, Bud Sharp testified that he had been\npracticing law for seven years when he was retained by Petitioner’s parents to represent\nPetitioner in case number F-13913. Mr. Sharp stated that he met with Petitioner twice in\na three-week period regarding the case. He stated that he may have filed a discovery\nmotion but did not investigate any witnesses because he was on the case for only four\nweeks. He stated that the case had not yet been set for trial when he withdrew from\nrepresenting Petitioner. Mr. Sharp recalled that he talked to Petitioner about entering a\nbest interest plea based on Petitioner’s extensive prior record, which consisted of “[forty]\nsomething felony convictions[,]” the unpredictability of a jury trial, and the strength of\nthe State’s proof. Specifically, Mr. Sharp recalled from the police report that the victim\nin case number F-13913 “pulled up to her house and [Petitioner] was in the house, came\nout of the house, the car was sitting in the driveway, and she got his tag number and he\nleft.”\n\n                                            -3-\n\f         Although Mr. Sharp remembered Petitioner discussing matters unrelated to his\ncase, Mr. Sharp stated that this was not unusual because many of his clients tended to go\noff subject. Mr. Sharp stated that Petitioner was “very intelligent[.]” Mr. Sharp stated\nthat he represented Petitioner in 2007 on a burglary and theft case and that Petitioner was\nmentally competent when he entered his guilty plea on the case. He acknowledged that\nhe was aware Petitioner was drawing SSI disability, but he stated that he was not aware\nof Petitioner’s being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder or anti-social\npersonality disorder. Mr. Sharp stated that, if the case had proceeded to trial, he may\nhave had Petitioner undergo a forensic evaluation based on the Petitioner’s drawing\ndisability. Mr. Sharp denied telling Petitioner he should talk with the prosecutor. He\nstated, “[Petitioner] may have written a letter to [the prosecutor]. My clients do not talk\nto the State period. I do not want my clients talking to the State even though they may\nhave good intentions.” Mr. Sharp recalled that Petitioner’s parents retained co-counsel,\nSteve Roller. Mr. Sharp talked to Mr. Roller over the phone about who would ultimately\nhandle the case and whether a plea agreement should be negotiated. They did not discuss\ntrial strategy. Mr. Sharp withdrew from the case on April 29, 2013.\n\n       Steve Roller testified that he had been a practicing attorney since 1978. Mr. Roller\nwas retained by Petitioner’s parents to represent Petitioner after dismissing Mr. Sharp for\nsome unspecified reason. Mr. Roller recalled that a trial date had been set for one of\nPetitioner’s cases. Mr. Roller did not recall Petitioner’s parents’ expressing concerns\nabout Petitioner’s mental health.\n\n       Mr. Roller testified that he met with Petitioner in the Warren County Jail more\nthan once. During this time, Petitioner told Mr. Roller that he wanted to meet with the\nprosecutor; however, the State was not interested in meeting with him. Mr. Roller\nacknowledged that he scheduled a meeting with Petitioner and investigators Jason\nRowland and Barry Powers to discuss facts about “certain different cases[,]” despite\nPetitioner not having an immunity agreement. Mr. Roller stated that he advised\nPetitioner not to meet with the investigators, but Petitioner “insisted” on meeting with\nthem.\n\n        Mr. Roller denied having any knowledge of Petitioner’s mental health issues.\nHowever, he recalled an incident in which Petitioner lost his temper and acted in such a\nway that guards interrupted their meeting and took Petitioner to his cell. Mr. Roller\ntestified that Petitioner demonstrated his understanding of the nature of the charges\nagainst him by asking and answering relevant questions about the case. Petitioner was\n“very educated with legal procedure and trial” due to his extensive criminal record.\nBased on Petitioner’s participation in his defense, Mr. Roller did not see the need to have\nPetitioner undergo a forensic evaluation.\n\n                                           -4-\n\f       Mr. Roller recalled that he was the subject of a complaint Petitioner filed with the\nBoard of Professional Responsibility (BPR). In his response to the complaint, Mr. Roller\nstated that Petitioner had serious mental problems and that Petitioner had “a mental\nbreakdown at the jail[.]” Mr. Roller testified, however, that he was attempting to\ndescribe the incident at the jail in which Petitioner lost his temper. Despite his letter to\nthe BPR, Mr. Roller did not believe that Petitioner lacked competency to participate in\nhis own defense. Mr. Roller acknowledged that he was required by the BPR to refund a\nsubstantial amount of the money paid by Petitioner’s parents for his representation.\n\n       Christopher Stanford testified that, at the time of the post-conviction hearing, he\nhad been practicing law for approximately nine years. He stated that about fifty percent\nof his practice involved defending individuals charged with criminal offenses. Mr.\nStanford recalled that he was retained by Petitioner’s parents in 2013 to represent\nPetitioner on his charges in multiple indictments. Petitioner’s parents also retained Lee\nNettles as a defense investigator. After being retained, Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles met\nwith Petitioner at a prison in West Tennessee for approximately three hours. Mr.\nStanford also obtained copies of the State’s discovery. Mr. Stanford recalled how\nknowledgeable Petitioner was about his cases, and he testified that he observed nothing in\nPetitioner’s behavior during their discussions to make him concerned about Petitioner’s\nmental health and to warrant a forensic evaluation. He explained:\n\n       . . . I never once had an inkling that [Petitioner] was unable to assist me\n       with his defense. In fact, he was probably – he seemed fairly well-versed in\n       the law. He seemed fairly able to point us in particular directions, able to\n       give us theories of defense and so while he did have some scattered thought\n       processes, . . . I mean, he would go down a rabbit trail and we would have\n       to redirect him back to the main issue but other than that I didn’t notice\n       anything about him that gave me cause for concern.\n\n       Mr. Stanford testified that he learned of Petitioner’s extensive prior record when\nthe State filed its “Notice of Intent to Use Conviction for Impeachment.” He recalled that\nthe State elected to proceed to trial first on case number F-13913. He explained that,\nonce the State made its election, he and the defense investigator primarily focused their\ninvestigative efforts on that case. Mr. Stanford recalled that he met with Petitioner at the\nWarren County Jail after Petitioner was transferred to the jail about a week before trial.\nHe met with Petitioner “several times in a three[-]day period” to prepare Petitioner for\ntrial.\n\n      Initially, the State refused to make a settlement offer, but Mr. Stanford eventually\nconvinced the prosecutor to make Petitioner an offer. He explained:\n\n                                           -5-\n\f       [I]t was my decision at that point that Petitioner needed to explore all\n       reasonable offers before he made a decision about trying these cases[.] [I]t\n       was my understanding that the DA wasn’t going to stop [trying Petitioner’s\n       cases] until [the State] had the number that they wanted as far as sentencing\n       goes. The initial offer was not acceptable to Petitioner.\n\nDuring Petitioner’s time in the Warren County Jail, Mr. Stanford approached the prosecutor\nand requested an agreement to continue the trial so that the parties could explore reaching a\nnegotiated settlement as Mr. Stanford could not adequately prepare for trial if he focused on\nplea negotiations. He spent the next two to three days, in January 2014, going back and\nforth between the prosecutor and Petitioner to settle the case.\n\n       Mr. Stanford remembered an individual named Joe Holland.1 He recalled that\nPetitioner wanted Mr. Holland charged with theft based on information Petitioner\nprovided to Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles. Petitioner was adamant that Mr. Holland was\ncriminally responsible for the offenses pending against Petitioner. Petitioner expressed\nthis belief to Mr. Stanford in person and through a thirteen-page letter written by\nPetitioner, in which Petitioner stated that he expected Mr. Holland to be charged before\nPetitioner’s trial. When pressed about whether anyone in Mr. Sanford’s office had\ninvestigated Mr. Holland, Mr. Stanford said that he did not personally conduct the first\ninterview with witnesses but stated that Mr. Nettles would have done that. Based on\nPetitioner’s thirteen-page letter, Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles investigated people\n“surrounding Joe Holland.” Mr. Stanford believed that it would be helpful to talk to Mr.\nHolland’s associates because they might be more willing to share information that Mr.\nHolland was the person who had committed the crimes. Mr. Stanford recalled that he\nreceived a letter from Barry McCormick, which indicated that certain stolen items had\nbeen purchased from Mr. Holland.\n\n       Mr. Stanford testified that he made a “strategic decision” that he needed to get\nready for one trial—the first case set for trial—and that he and Mr. Nettles needed to\nfocus the investigation on the individuals involved in that case. Regarding Petitioner’s\nplea in case number F-13974, Mr. Stanford explained:\n\n       The DA wanted a plea to the first case. That [case] was not an option. That\n       was going to be part of the plea deal. [The prosecutor] . . . didn’t care\n       which case [Petitioner] pled to after that. So we put the ball in\n       [Petitioner’s] court and said, you pick. Which case do you want to plead\n       to? And [Petitioner] wanted to plead to . . . [case number F-13974].\n\n       1\n          The record reflects that Mr. Holland was listed on the indictment in case number F-13974 as a\nwitness for the State.\n                                                 -6-\n\f        Mr. Stanford testified that Petitioner was “looking at a hundred plus years” based\non all the pending charges. He told Petitioner he would “be happy to try [the] case” but\nthat he wanted to also explore plea negotiations with the State. He explained that,\noriginally, the State’s plea offer included a much higher sentence but that Mr. Stanford\n“eventually worked it down[.]” He talked to Petitioner about the facts of the case, the\nperception of the jurors given those facts, and “what we thought the jury was likely to do\nwith that case[.]” Mr. Stanford believed that, as Petitioner realized his considerable\nliability, Petitioner’s mood began to “shift[.]” Petitioner was “tearful,” “angry,” and\n“very upset.” Mr. Stanford stated that Petitioner’s\n\n       main concern was that he get out of prison or that . . . all these charges be\n       dropped so he could spend the rest of his life with his lovely parents and I\n       think he became very sad and very tearful when he realized that [there]\n       might be a possibility that he might be in prison longer than they might\n       live.\n\n        Mr. Stanford explained that he had not subpoenaed witnesses the week before the\nscheduled trial because the defense could not come up with any witnesses other than\ncharacter witnesses like Petitioner’s parents and Shelia Thompson. He explained that\nMs. Thompson was the only witness that the defense could find that corroborated\nPetitioner’s version of events, but she would have “basically regurgitated . . . what\n[Petitioner] had told her[.]” Mr. Stanford recalled that the victim in case number F-13913\nwas “clear as [] could be that it was [Petitioner]” who had been in her driveway.\n\n       Mr. Stanford explained that most of his communication with Petitioner was\nconducted through Petitioner’s parents and through letters that Petitioner sent to Mr.\nStanford. Mr. Stanford denied that Petitioner’s parents tried to set up a phone account\nwith him to use to communicate with Petitioner. Mr. Stanford stated that Mr. Nettles\nnever advised Petitioner that “if you don’t accept this plea then I’m going to have to go\nout now and start subpoenaing witnesses[.]” He recalled that, on the day of the plea, the\ncourt clerk or the trial court indicated that they needed to know if Petitioner intended to\nenter the plea by a certain time that day so that the court would know whether or not to\ncall in the jury. However, there was not a deadline on the plea negotiations. Mr.\nStanford explained that the trial court would have granted a continuance because they had\nspent so much time in plea negotiations rather than trial preparation. Mr. Stanford had\nadvised Petitioner not to testify based on Petitioner’s prior record. He stated that, once he\nexplained to Petitioner the details of his investigative findings and what the State’s proof\nwould be at trial, Petitioner told Mr. Stanford, “[G]et me the best number you can get\nme[.]”\n\n                                            -7-\n\f        Mr. Stanford acknowledged that he did not file a motion challenging the State’s\nuse of Petitioner’s prior convictions to impeach Petitioner at trial. He agreed that many\nof Petitioner’s prior convictions were very similar to the charges Petitioner was facing.\nMr. Stanford recalled that he and Mr. Nettles met several times to review and organize\ndiscovery before the three-hour meeting with Petitioner. Mr. Stanford recalled that their\ninvestigation showed that the State had a witness that would testify that Petitioner\npossessed a weapon. The witness indicated Petitioner tried to give her two firearms.\nBecause of his substantial practice in federal court, Mr. Stanford was “very concerned”\nthat the federal prosecutors might seek to charge Petitioner under the Armed Career\nCriminal Act, in which case Petitioner “would have been looking at . . . probably [thirty]\nto life.” When Mr. Stanford approached the State about plea negotiations, Mr. Stanford\nhad a “gentlemen’s agreement” with the prosecutor that the prosecutor would not report\nthe firearms offense to the federal prosecutors. Mr. Stanford indicated that this was a\n“big part” of why Petitioner chose to plead guilty to the two indictments.\n\n        Mr. Stanford testified that Mr. Nettles spent over sixty hours investigating\nPetitioner’s cases prior to the plea and then spent an additional twenty hours after the plea\ntrying to secure an indictment against Mr. Holland in Coffee County. Mr. Stanford stated\nthat Petitioner wanted to go to trial until the prosecutor agreed to enter into plea\nnegotiations. Petitioner then wanted to explore the possibility of a plea. Mr. Stanford\nstated, “Once he realized that the State was willing to make an offer to him he was very\ninterested in how low we could get the number.” Mr. Stanford testified that he knew the\nprosecutor would not object to a continuance of the trial and testified that he told\nPetitioner about a possible continuance.\n\n      Mr. Stanford said that he did not believe he would have been able to cross-\nexamine Mr. Holland about any pending charges he was facing.2 He did not think that\ninformation would have been relevant and admissible. Petitioner provided Mr. Stanford\nwith a letter signed by Barry McCormick dated February 4, 2013, indicating Mr.\nHolland’s potential “guilt and involvement in some of the matters.”3\n\n\n        2\n          At the post-conviction hearing, Petitioner made an offer of proof regarding Mr. Holland’s\nconviction, submitting a Coffee County Grand Jury indictment charging Mr. Holland with theft over\n$10,000 and a judgment of conviction showing that Mr. Holland pled guilty to the charge on January 20,\n2016. It is not clear from the offer of proof the nature of Mr. Holland’s role in that offense. Moreover,\nalthough it appears that some of the victims listed in the indictment correspond to the victims listed in the\nindictments for case numbers F-13913 and F-13974, it is not clear from the record how Mr. Holland was\ninvolved in the offenses to which Petitioner pled guilty or why Mr. Holland was charged in Coffee\nCounty rather than Warren County.\n        3\n          It is unclear from the record whether Mr. Stanford’s reference to “some of the matters” meant\nPetitioner’s cases.\n                                                   -8-\n\f        Lee Nettles testified that he owned a private investigation company, ICT\nInvestigations, in Manchester. Mr. Nettles explained that he had seventeen years’ prior\nexperience in law enforcement before beginning his work as a private investigator. Mr.\nNettles recalled that Petitioner’s parents hired him in July 2013, along with Mr. Stanford,\nto assist with Petitioner’s defense. The following month, Mr. Nettles accompanied Mr.\nStanford to the prison in West Tennessee where Petitioner was being housed before trial\nand met with Petitioner for three hours to discuss the cases against Petitioner. Mr.\nNettles recalled that, during the meeting, Petitioner asked him to investigate Mr.\nHolland’s culpability in the burglaries and thefts. They “talked about each one of the[]\n[Petitioner’s] individual cases and different pieces of stolen property that was at Mr.\nHolland’s that . . . went to other people that [were] in the community.” In August 2013,\nMr. Nettles began conducting “computer intel work” on individuals who were supposed\nto be in possession of stolen property they received from Mr. Holland. Mr. Nettles\nattempted to find them, interview them, and tie the stolen items “back to Mr. Holland and\nsee what it had to do with [Petitioner].” Mr. Nettles noted that Mr. Holland made\nstatements to the Warren County Sheriff’s Department and the McMinnville City Police\nDepartment indicating that he was involved “in this stolen property.” Following\nPetitioner’s plea, Mr. Nettles took the information about Mr. Holland that he found\nthrough his investigation to the Coffee County Sheriff’s Department.\n\n        Mr. Nettles recalled that he received letters from Petitioner, and he met with\nPetitioner’s parents multiple times. Additionally, Petitioner’s parents indicated to Mr.\nNettles that they were communicating with Petitioner regarding his cases during their\nprison visitations. Mr. Nettles testified that he learned on September 3, 2013, that the\nState intended to take case number F-13913 to trial first, and Mr. Stanford instructed him\nto focus on that case. Mr. Nettles agreed that Mr. Holland had given two statements to\nlaw enforcement regarding stolen property, but he stated that Mr. Holland “[d]idn’t have\nanything to do with the burglary from [F-]13913.” Mr. Nettles explained, “I had\n[Petitioner’s] theory about what happened [in case number F-13913]. So I began to\ninvestigate it.” He interviewed Sandy Bratcher and obtained a statement from her in\nOctober 2013. Petitioner told Mr. Nettles that Ms. Bratcher was present on the night\nPetitioner allegedly burglarized the victim’s home. However, when Mr. Nettles spoke to\nher, Ms. Bratcher denied knowing Petitioner. Mr. Nettles stated that he had known that\nMs. Bratcher had been in jail in Warren County, but he was unaware of the nature of the\ncharges. Mr. Nettles explained that he also interviewed another potential witness, Sheila\nThompson.\n\n       Mr. Nettles recalled that Petitioner was “very specific” in the information that he\nprovided Mr. Nettles and Mr. Stanford. Mr. Nettles said that eventually some stolen\nproperty was recovered, but he could not recall “which burglaries they came from[.]”\nMr. Nettles investigated Petitioner’s cases for about sixty hours prior to Petitioner’s\n                                           -9-\n\fentering a plea. Mr. Nettles explained that Petitioner’s parents paid him additional\nmoney after Petitioner’s plea to locate more of the stolen property, hoping that it would\n“help [Petitioner] get parole.” Accordingly, Mr. Nettles pursued the information received\nfrom Petitioner with the Coffee County Sheriff’s Department. Mr. Nettles explained that\nthe property eventually recovered was not the stolen property at issue in case number F-\n13913. Mr. Nettles stated that Mr. Holland was later indicted based on the information\nprovided by Petitioner.\n\n       Barry McCormick testified that he first met Petitioner in December 2012, at the\nWarren County Jail. Mr. McCormick explained that he was Petitioner’s cellmate for\nseveral months. He recalled that Petitioner was “just emotionally wrecked” one day,\nafter Petitioner spoke to Investigator Rowland and Mr. Roller. Mr. McCormick claimed\nthat Petitioner began hallucinating, hearing voices, and Petitioner was paranoid that\nothers were going to hurt him. Mr. McCormick recalled that Petitioner was sent to\nsegregation for a few days after this event.\n\n       Dr. David Solovey, an expert in clinical psychology, testified that he had been\nhired to conduct a mental evaluation of Petitioner prior to the post-conviction hearing.\nDr. Solovey stated that he conducted the seven-and-a-half-hour evaluation on November\n21, 2015. He interviewed Petitioner at the Bledsoe Correctional Complex, and he also\nreviewed “some extensive mental health records” that were obtained from the Social\nSecurity Administration and prior treatment facilities. Dr. Solovey testified that his\nreview of the records showed that Petitioner had a “significant history dating back to\nelementary school.” From 1999 to 2012, Petitioner had twenty-one psychiatric\nhospitalizations. The records indicated that Petitioner had “a variety of diagnoses\nranging from psychosis, suicidal depression, paranoia, post-traumatic stress disorder,\n[and] chemical dependency.” Dr. Solovey testified that Petitioner had been prescribed\nmood stabilizers, anti-depressants, and anti-psychotic medications at various times\nthroughout his life.\n\n       Dr. Solovey stated that he diagnosed Petitioner as having a “schizoaffective\ndisorder which can be called a number of different things like bipolar disorder or mood\ndisorder and their underlying psychotic processes.” According to Dr. Solovey, Petitioner\nprovided a history of the days leading up to his entering the plea—“a Thursday, Friday,\nand then a weekend and then a Monday.” Petitioner reported that it was a “very\nstressful” time and that he felt increasing stress and pressure to enter the plea. Petitioner\nexplained to Dr. Solovey:\n\n       Well, it was at first before it started he was fairly uplifted thinking that\n       things were going to be okay and then the police started coming in and\n       there was some reference to ATF and then the potential threat of having\n                                           - 10 -\n\f       something even worse occur, wasn’t allowed to talk to his parents. He\n       wanted to talk to them to at least get some neutral person to discuss what it\n       was all about and he felt there was just an absolute I have to do this or else.\n\n       According to Dr. Solovey, Petitioner reported that he was taking an anti-\ndepressant while in prison, but he was not receiving an anti-psychotic medication. Dr.\nSolovey stated that the lack of medication would have “really ma[d]e things much more\ndifficult for [Petitioner].” Dr. Solovey opined that Petitioner’s repeated hospitalizations\nshould have been “red flags” for counsel indicating that Petitioner needed to be evaluated\nfor competency to stand trial and to determine Petitioner’s mental health status at the time\nof his plea “to see whether it would be knowingly and fully reasonably entered.” The\nfollowing exchange occurred during Dr. Solovey’s direct examination:\n\n              Q. And sir, also pursuant to your evaluation you formed an opinion\n       as to whether [Petitioner’s] guilty pleas were knowingly and voluntarily\n       entered, did you not?\n\n               A. I feel the pressure was there. He was poorly medicated and given\n       that history that was just ever present that I think a full psychiatric\n       evaluation or psychological forensic evaluation would have been relevant at\n       least to determine that.\n\nWhen asked again if Petitioner’s plea was knowing and voluntary, Dr. Solvey responded\nthat Petitioner “needed quite a bit more to really fully consider that before standing\nbefore court.”\n\n       On cross-examination, Dr. Solovey acknowledged that the medical records\nindicated various treatment plans for Petitioner, which were appropriate for Petitioner’s\ndiagnosis. Dr. Solovey also stated that the results of his evaluation reflected Petitioner’s\ncondition on November 21, 2015, but that the results were consistent with Petitioner’s\nhistory. Dr. Solovey tested Petitioner for competency to stand trial and found that\nPetitioner was competent. He agreed that factors contributing to Petitioner’s competency\nwere the structured prison environment and being properly medicated. Dr. Solovey\nagreed that Petitioner’s medical records indicated that Petitioner was being properly\nmedicated prior to his plea, but Petitioner told Dr. Solovey that he was un-medicated on\nthe day of the plea. Dr. Solovey opined that Petitioner had the capacity to understand\nwhat would be in his “best interest” but that,\n\n       when that agreement was made that was not a good time for [Petitioner],\n       that was not what you would call a reasonable . . . appropriate time where\n       he could fully consider everything that was going on and everything that\n                                           - 11 -\n\f       was involved with his plea, that he was probably . . . quite disturbed at that\n       time.\n\n        Petitioner’s father, Rodney Aho, testified that Petitioner had mental health\nproblems beginning at an early age. Mr. Aho agreed that Petitioner also struggled with\ndrug addictions and had a lengthy criminal record. Mr. Aho testified that he told Mr.\nSharp, Mr. Roller, and Mr. Stanford about Petitioner’s mental health issues. He stated\nthat Mr. Roller’s representation of Petitioner ended on bad terms, and Mr. Aho filed an\nethical complaint against Mr. Roller with the BPR; Mr. Roller had to provide Mr. Aho a\nrefund of $3,700 as a result of the complaint. Mr. Aho recalled that he offered to set up a\nphone account for Mr. Nettles to talk to Petitioner, but Mr. Nettles said that “it wasn’t\nnecessary now.” Mr. Aho stated that the only direct communication Petitioner had with\nMr. Nettles and Mr. Stanford before January 2014 was the three-hour meeting at the\nprison in West Tennessee. Mr. Aho recalled that, after Petitioner was transported to the\nWarren County Jail in January 2014, he was able to speak to Petitioner over the telephone\nat least two times before Petitioner entered his guilty plea. However, Mr. Aho explained,\n“We really didn’t talk about a plea agreement. We . . . knew he was really upset and he\nsaid, [‘T]hey’re not working with us, they’re not going to give us what we want.[’]”\nDuring his phone calls with Petitioner before the plea, Mr. Aho “could tell [Petitioner]\nwas stressed out and ready to cry[.]” Mr. Aho testified, “I think [Petitioner] felt at that\ntime that [Mr.] Stanford wasn’t going to do anything for him, wasn’t going to go to trial.”\nHe claimed that he had very little communication with Mr. Nettles and Mr. Stanford,\nalthough he recalled at least one meeting with Mr. Nettles at the Aho’s residence. Mr.\nAho also met with Mr. Nettles at least three times at Mr. Nettles’ office, and he met with\nMr. Stanford two or three times at Mr. Stanford’s office. Mr. Aho stated that he paid Mr.\nNettles additional money after Petitioner’s plea to further investigate items of stolen\nproperty, which led to Mr. Holland’s arrest and conviction.\n\n        Petitioner testified that he “had no choice” when he entered best interest pleas in\ncase number F-13913 and F-13974. Mr. Sharp initially represented Petitioner, and\nPetitioner informed Mr. Sharp of his mental health history. Petitioner also told Mr. Sharp\nthat he had information that would help the State prosecute other cases. At Petitioner’s\narraignment hearing, Mr. Sharp told Petitioner to share the information with the State.\nLater, Mr. Sharp visited Petitioner while Petitioner was incarcerated in the Warren\nCounty Jail. Petitioner testified that, during this visit, Mr. Sharp told Petitioner that he\n“ran his mouth too much” while they were standing at the booking area. Petitioner\ntestified that, after this interaction, he ended Mr. Sharp’s representation. Petitioner spoke\nwith Mr. Roller about representing him, and he informed Mr. Roller of his mental health\nhistory. Petitioner informed Mr. Roller that he was receiving treatment for depression,\nbipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Mr. Roller did not advise that\nPetitioner should receive a forensic evaluation. Petitioner asked Mr. Roller to schedule a\n                                           - 12 -\n\fmeeting with the State and gave Mr. Roller a letter from Barry McCormick that discussed\nthe location of stolen property. Petitioner gave Mr. Roller the letter hoping that the State\nwould recover the stolen property and charge Mr. Holland. Petitioner testified that Mr.\nRoller did not use the letter in his case. Petitioner stated that Mr. Roller’s inaction made\nhim feel helpless, and he did not have confidence in Mr. Roller’s representation.\nPetitioner testified that he never received discovery until he ended Mr. Roller’s\nrepresentation.\n\n       On February 15, 2013, Mr. Roller brought two investigators to meet with\nPetitioner at the jail. Petitioner hoped to arrange for immunity in exchange for the\ninformation he had about the stolen property; however, no agreement was reached.\nPetitioner told the investigators about seeing Mr. Holland with the stolen property, and\nMr. Roller never advised him to end the interview. At Petitioner’s arraignment hearing\non February 27, 2013, Mr. Roller said he would visit Petitioner, but he did not. Mr.\nRoller met with Petitioner on March 15, 2013, and after this meeting, Petitioner\n“snapped” and became depressed and paranoid. Petitioner believed that other inmates\nwere going to attack him, and he was placed in solitary confinement for seven days. On\nApril 5, 2013, Petitioner met with Mr. Roller for the last time. At this meeting, Mr.\nRoller gave Petitioner his discovery. Petitioner testified that Mr. Roller only investigated\none witness, Monica Burgess, for his cases.\n\n        Petitioner’s parents later hired Mr. Stanford to represent him. Mr. Stanford and\nthe defense investigator, Mr. Nettles, met with Petitioner while he was incarcerated in\nWest Tennessee in August 2013. Petitioner informed Mr. Stanford that he was taking\nPaxil for his mental health issues. Mr. Stanford discussed with Petitioner whether\nPetitioner should testify at trial, but Mr. Stanford did not file a motion to limit the State’s\nability to impeach Petitioner with his prior convictions. Petitioner believed that his cases\nwere proceeding to trial, and he asked Mr. Stanford to follow leads regarding the stolen\nproperty. The only contact that Petitioner received from Mr. Stanford between the initial\nmeeting and his plea submission was a letter that Mr. Stanford wrote to the State\nrequesting to extend the trial date and to conduct fingerprint testing. On November 20,\n2013, Petitioner wrote a letter to Mr. Stanford asking Mr. Stanford to investigate the\nstolen property tied to Mr. Holland and requesting a mental health evaluation. Mr.\nStanford never responded to this letter. In January 2015, Petitioner was transferred to the\nWarren County Jail for his trial. Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles met with Petitioner on\nJanuary 22, 2015. During this meeting, Petitioner believed that he was going to trial, and\nhe felt that a positive outcome was likely. Mr. Stanford conveyed a plea agreement to the\nPetitioner with a twenty-five year sentence. Petitioner also discussed his other cases with\nMr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles.\n\n\n\n                                            - 13 -\n\f       The next day, Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles met with Petitioner again, and Mr.\nNettles told Petitioner that he could receive federal charges for gun offenses. Mr.\nStanford conveyed a new plea agreement to the Petitioner for a sentence of thirty years.\nRegarding his mental state at this time, the Petitioner stated, “[T]he way they pushed it\nand switched up on me there was no way in the world I could have went to court with\nthem to represent me and come out good. I would have been done [sic] worse than what\nthey were trying to do.” Mr. Nettles informed Petitioner that he had not subpoenaed any\nwitnesses. Petitioner stated that he felt that he had no choice but to enter a plea.\nPetitioner began to sign the plea but asked to speak with his parents. Mr. Stanford\ncontacted the State, and around 3:27 p.m., Mr. Stanford informed Petitioner that the trial\ncourt stated that the plea needed to be submitted by 4:00 p.m. Petitioner agreed that, at\nthe plea submission hearing, he testified that he “thoroughly” discussed the plea\nagreement with Mr. Stanford. Petitioner noted that he had never proceeded to trial on\nany of his previous criminal charges.\n\n       On cross-examination, Petitioner agreed that he had a lengthy criminal history.\nPetitioner also agreed that he understood the State’s allegations in case numbers F-13913\nand F-13974. Petitioner agreed that he discussed these charges with his three attorneys.\nPetitioner agreed that a witness in case number F-13913 had observed him at the offense\nscene and identified him at the preliminary hearing. He also agreed that this witness\ncould have testified at his trial. Petitioner stated that, when he signed the plea agreement\ndocuments, he understood what the terms of the agreement were. Petitioner agreed that\nhe testified during the plea submission hearing that no one had promised or threatened\nanything to coerce him into entering a plea. On redirect examination, Petitioner testified\nthat he did not voluntarily enter his plea.\n\n        At the conclusion of the hearing, the post-conviction court found that Petitioner’s\nfirst two attorneys did not affect Petitioner’s case. The post-conviction court also found\nthat there was no evidence that “that Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles could have provided\nsome witnesses or statements or something to [Petitioner] or to the court that would have\nsignificantly changed the outcome of the case as far as what they discovered.” The post-\nconviction court found that Mr. Stanford was prepared for trial and that Mr. Nettles was\nprepared to subpoena a defense witness to testify at trial. The post-conviction court\nfurther noted that Mr. Stanford and the State agreed to continue Petitioner’s trial if\nPetitioner rejected the plea agreement and that the trial court would not have opposed this\nagreement to continue. The post-conviction court found that there was no evidence that\nwitnesses existed that could have testified at trial to impeach the State’s witnesses. The\npost-conviction court found that Mr. Stanford’s representation was deficient for failing to\nfile a motion to exclude Petitioner’s prior record for impeachment purposes. However,\nthe post-conviction court concluded that the motion would not have affected Petitioner’s\n\n                                           - 14 -\n\fcase because some of Petitioner’s prior convictions were admissible. The post-conviction\ncourt concluded that Petitioner did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n        Regarding the voluntariness of Petitioner’s plea, the post-conviction court found\nthat Petitioner appeared to be competent when he entered his best interest plea. The post-\nconviction court also found that, during the plea submission hearing, Petitioner “was very\nalert and understanding and there was no question that he appeared to know what he was\ndoing.” The post-conviction court noted that Dr. Solovey testified that Petitioner had\ndepression, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. However, the post-\nconviction court concluded that Mr. Stanford’s representation was not ineffective for\nfailing to request a mental health evaluation for Petitioner “because he didn’t see\nanything that caused him to believe that [Petitioner] was not competent.”\n\n       Following the hearing, the post-conviction court entered a written order of its\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law and denied post-conviction relief. This timely\nappeal follows.\n\nAnalysis\n\n        On appeal, Petitioner contends that Mr. Stanford rendered ineffective assistance\nbased on counsel’s failure to issue subpoenas, file motions, and respond to the State’s\nmotion to use Petitioner’s prior convictions as impeachment evidence. Additionally,\nPetitioner alleges that he gave Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles “the tools they needed to\nsecure a sound defense” by providing them with information about Mr. Holland but that\nMr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles failed to investigate that lead until after Petitioner’s plea.\nPetitioner further asserts that Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles used unreasonable persuasion\nto get Petitioner to sign the agreement. Petitioner asserts that they threatened him with a\nfederal firearms charge if he did not accept the State’s offer when “[l]ittle to no proof was\navailable to the government to support such a charge[,]” and Mr. Stanford failed to relay\nto Petitioner the possibility of a continuance. The State responds that the post-conviction\ncourt properly denied Petitioner relief on his claim that his plea was involuntarily and\nunknowingly entered due to ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n       Post-conviction relief is available when a “conviction or sentence is void or\nvoidable because of the abridgment of any right guaranteed by the Constitution of\nTennessee or the Constitution of the United States.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-103. In\norder to prevail on a petition for post-conviction relief, a petitioner must prove all factual\nallegations by clear and convincing evidence. Jaco v.

Additionally, review of\ncounsel’s performance “requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting\neffects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel’s challenged conduct,\nand to evaluate the conduct from counsel’s perspective at the time.” Strickland, 466 U.S.\nat 689; see also Henley, 960 S.W.2d at 579. We will not second-guess a reasonable trial\nstrategy, and we will not grant relief based on a sound, yet ultimately unsuccessful,\ntactical decision. Granderson v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1054593\"><a href=\"/opinion/1054593/granderson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 790 (Tenn. Crim.

Rose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1769614\"><a href=\"/opinion/1769614/baxter-v-rose/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">930</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 936 (Tenn. 1975)); see also Goad, 938 S.W.2d at 369. In order to prove that\ncounsel was deficient, the petitioner must demonstrate “that counsel’s acts or omissions\nwere so serious as to fall below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing\nprofessional norms.” Goad, 938 S.W.2d at 369 (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688); see\nalso Baxter, 523 S.W.2d at 936.\n\n       Even if counsel’s performance is deficient, the deficiency must have resulted in\nprejudice to the defense. Goad, 938 S.W.2d at 370. Therefore, under the second prong\n                                            - 16 -\n\fof the Strickland analysis, the petitioner “must show that there is a reasonable probability\nthat, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in\nthe outcome.” Id. (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n       A substantially similar two-prong standard applies when the petitioner challenges\ncounsel’s performance in the context of a guilty plea.

See Hill, 474 U.S. at 58. Second, “in order to satisfy the\n‘prejudice’ requirement, the [petitioner] must show that there is a reasonable probability\nthat, but for counsel’s errors, he would have not have pleaded guilty and would have\ninsisted on going to trial.” Id. at 59.\n\n       Whether a guilty plea is intelligent and voluntary is a mixed question of law and\nfact.

The\npost-conviction court’s findings of law are reviewed purely de novo. Id.\n\n       When reviewing a guilty plea, this court looks to both the federal standard as\nannounced in the landmark case Boykin v. Alabama, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107951\"><a href=\"/opinion/107951/boykin-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1969), and the state\nstandard as announced in State v. Mackey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2457978\"><a href=\"/opinion/2457978/state-v-mackey/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 1977), superseded on\nother grounds by Tenn.

Don Allen Rodgers,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1478764</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5. Under the federal standard, there must be an affirmative\nshowing that the plea was “intelligent and voluntary.” Boykin, 395 U.S. at 242.\nLikewise, the Tennessee Supreme Court has held that “the record of acceptance of a\ndefendant’s plea of guilty must affirmatively demonstrate that his decision was both\nvoluntary and knowledgeable, i.e. that he has been made aware of the significant\nconsequences of such a plea . . . .” Mackey, 553 S.W.2d at 340. “[A] plea is not\n‘voluntary’ if it is the product of ‘[i]gnorance, incomprehension, coercion, terror,\ninducements, [or] subtle or blatant threats . . . .” Blankenship v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1746202\"><a href=\"/opinion/1746202/blankenship-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n904 (Tenn. 1993) (quoting Boykin, 395 U.S. at 242-43).\n\n       In order to determine whether a plea is intelligent and voluntary, the trial court\nmust “canvass[] the matter with the accused to make sure he has a full understanding of\nwhat the plea connotes and of its consequence.” Boykin, 395 U.S. at 244. The trial court\nlooks to several factors before accepting a plea, including:\n\n\n\n                                           - 17 -\n\f       [T]he relative intelligence of the defendant; degree of his familiarity with\n       criminal proceedings; whether he was represented by competent counsel\n       and had the opportunity to confer with counsel about the options available\n       to him; the extent of advice from counsel and the court concerning the\n       charges against him; and the reasons for his decision to plead guilty,\n       including a desire to avoid a greater penalty that might result from a jury\n       trial.\n\nBlankenship, 858 S.W.2d at 904; Howell v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1678216\"><a href=\"/opinion/1678216/howell-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 330-31 (Tenn. 2006).\nOnce the trial court has conducted a proper plea colloquy, it discharges its duty to assess\nthe voluntary and intelligent nature of the plea and creates an adequate record for any\nsubsequent review. Boykin, 395 U.S. at 244.\n\n       Statements made by a petitioner, his attorney, and the prosecutor during the plea\ncolloquy, as well as any findings made by the trial court in accepting the plea, “constitute\na formidable barrier in any subsequent collateral proceedings.” Blackledge v. Allison,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109648\"><a href=\"/opinion/109648/blackledge-v-allison/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 73-74 (1977). Statements made in open court carry a strong presumption of\ntruth, and to overcome such presumption, a petitioner must present more than\n“conculsory allegations unsupported by specifics.” Id. at 74.\n\nIneffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n       Petitioner contends that Mr. Stanford rendered ineffective assistance based on\ncounsel’s failure to adequately prepare for trial. He asserts that Mr. Stanford failed to\nissue subpoenas, investigate Mr. Holland, and respond to the State’s motion to use\nPetitioner’s prior convictions as impeachment evidence.\n\n       The record reflects that, after they were retained, Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles\nobtained a copy of the State’s discovery and met with Petitioner for three hours.\nPetitioner was adamant that Mr. Holland was criminally responsible for the offenses\npending against Petitioner. Based on Petitioner’s assertions regarding Mr. Holland’s\ninvolvement, Mr. Stanford and Mr. Nettles investigated people “surrounding Joe\nHolland.” Mr. Stanford believed that it would be helpful to talk to Mr. Holland’s\nassociates because they might be more willing to share information that Mr. Holland was\nthe person who had committed the crimes. Mr. Nettles spent over sixty hours\ninvestigating Petitioner’s cases prior to the plea. Mr. Nettles interviewed multiple\nwitnesses, including Sandy Bratcher, Monica Burgess, and Sheila Thompson. He\nconducted “computer intel work” on the individuals who were supposed to be in\npossession of stolen items received from Mr. Holland. Mr. Nettles attempted to find\nthem, interview them, and tie the stolen items “back to Mr. Holland and see what it had to\ndo with [Petitioner].” Mr. Nettles agreed that Mr. Holland was later indicted based on the\n                                           - 18 -\n\finformation provided by Petitioner, but he stated that Mr. Holland “[d]idn’t have\nanything to do with the burglary from [F-]13913.” He explained that the property\neventually recovered was not the stolen property at issue in case number F-13913.\n\n        When the State elected to proceed to trial first on case number F-13913, Mr.\nStanford testified that he made a “strategic decision” that he and Mr. Nettles needed to\nfocus the investigation on the individuals involved in that case. Mr. Stanford recalled\nthat the victim in case number F-13913 was “clear as [] could be that it was [Petitioner]”\nwho had been in her driveway. Mr. Stanford met with Petitioner at the Warren County\nJail after Petitioner was transferred to the jail about a week before trial. He met with\nPetitioner “several times in a three[-]day period” to prepare Petitioner for trial. Mr.\nStanford explained that he had not subpoenaed witnesses because the defense\ninvestigation did not discover any witnesses other than Shelia Thompson and character\nwitnesses like Petitioner’s parents. He explained that Ms. Thompson was the only\nwitness that the defense could find that corroborated Petitioner’s version of events, but\nshe would have “basically regurgitated . . . what [Petitioner] had told her[.]” Mr.\nStanford testified that he approached the State about a potential plea agreement and\nworked for several days with the prosecutor to reach an agreement that was in\nPetitioner’s best interest. Mr. Stanford testified that he knew the prosecutor would not\nobject to a continuance of the trial if plea negotiations broke down, and Mr. Stanford told\nPetitioner about a possible continuance.\n\n        We agree with the post-conviction court that Mr. Stanford was prepared for trial\nand was prepared to subpoena at least one witness to testify on Petitioner’s behalf if the\ncase went to trial. Mr. Stanford communicated to Petitioner that the State agreed to\ncontinue Petitioner’s trial if Petitioner rejected the plea agreement and that the trial court\nwould not have opposed this agreement to continue. Moreover, the record shows that\nPetitioner’s defense team adequately investigated the background of Mr. Holland, and\nMr. Stanford was prepared to effectively cross-examine him. Petitioner failed to\nestablish or explain how evidence of Mr. Holland’s apparent involvement in some of the\nthefts would have affected his decision to go to trial in case number F-13913. Mr. Nettles\ntestified that Mr. Holland had no involvement in case number F-13913, and Mr. Stanford\nstated that the victim in that case was “clear as [she] could be that it was [Petitioner]”\nwho had been in her driveway at the time of the burglary. Although in his brief Petitioner\ncharacterizes Mr. Holland as a key witness for the State in case number F-13974, the\nevidence presented at the hearing fails to establish this claim. Moreover, it is not clear\nfrom the record what additional charges Petitioner was facing in case numbers F-13975,\nF-13976, and F-13977, which were dismissed by the State as part of Petitioner’s plea\nagreement, or the strength of the evidence against Petitioner in those cases. It is,\ntherefore, impossible for this court to conclude that but for trial counsel’s alleged errors,\n\n                                            - 19 -\n\fPetitioner “would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial” in\nthese cases. Hill, 474 U.S. at 59. Petitioner is not entitled to relief.\n\n       Regarding Petitioner’s claim that Mr. Stanford was ineffective for failing to\nrespond to the State’s motion to use Petitioner’s prior convictions as impeachment\nevidence, the post-conviction court concluded that Mr. Stanford’s performance was\ndeficient but that Petitioner was not prejudiced “because some, if not several, of\nPetitioner’s prior convictions would have been allowed by the [trial court] for\nimpeachment.” We agree with the post-conviction court’s assessment that Petitioner\nfailed to establish prejudice. The State’s “Notice of Intent to Use Conviction for\nImpeachment” reflects that Petitioner had a total of thirty-two prior convictions, the\nmajority of which were felony convictions. The Petitioner failed to establish that, had\nMr. Stanford filed a motion challenging the State’s notice, the trial court would have\nprecluded the State’s use of Petitioner’s prior convictions as impeachment. Accordingly,\nPetitioner has not shown that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, and he is\nnot entitled to relief.\n\nUnknowing and Involuntary Guilty Plea\n\n       Petitioner further asserts that trial counsel and the defense investigator used\nunreasonable persuasion to get Petitioner to sign the agreement. Petitioner asserts that\nthey threatened him with a federal firearms charge if he did not accept the State’s offer\nwhen “[l]ittle to no proof was available to the government to support such a charge.”\n\n        Here, the record reflects that, during the defense investigation, Mr. Stanford and\nMr. Nettles learned that the State had a witness that would testify that Petitioner had\npossession of a weapon. Mr. Stanford explained that the witness indicated Petitioner\ntried to give her two firearms, which were a part of one of the cases pending against\nPetitioner. Because of his substantial practice in federal court, Mr. Stanford was “very\nconcerned” that the federal prosecutors might seek to charge Petitioner under the Armed\nCareer Criminal Act, in which case Petitioner “would have been looking at . . . probably\n[thirty] to life.” When Mr. Stanford approached the State about plea negotiations, Mr.\nStanford had a “gentlemen’s agreement” with the prosecutor that the prosecutor would\nnot report the firearms offense to the federal prosecutors. Mr. Stanford indicated that this\nwas a “big part” of why Petitioner chose to plead guilty to the two indictments.\n\n        The guilty plea hearing transcript reflects that, when questioned by the trial court,\nPetitioner agreed that he went over the plea documents in both cases “thoroughly” with\ntrial counsel. Petitioner testified that he understood the nature of the charges to which the\npleas were offered, the minimum and maximum sentence on each charge if convicted, his\nright to counsel at every stage of the proceedings, his right to plead not guilty, his right to\n                                            - 20 -\n\fa jury trial, his right to confront adverse witnesses and bring his own witnesses, his right\nto remain silent, and his right to appeal any resulting conviction or sentence. In accepting\nthe terms of the plea agreement, Petitioner affirmed that he was waiving each of those\nrights. He also agreed that he was entering his pleas freely and voluntarily. Petitioner\ndenied that he was entering the pleas because he had been threatened to do so. The trial\ncourt found that Petitioner understood his rights and made a knowing, voluntary, and\nunderstanding waiver of his rights by pleading guilty.\n\n        Upon review, we agree with the post-conviction court’s assessment that\nPetitioner’s best interest pleas were entered knowingly and voluntarily. Mr. Stanford\ntestified that Petitioner was able to write very coherently, was able to pass along volumes\nof information to him about the cases (such as specific times and the people involved),\nunderstood the potential sentences he was facing, and understood that additional charges\ncould possibly result from his alleged possession of a firearm based on his previous\nfelony convictions. Petitioner declared in open court that his plea was knowing and\nvoluntary, and the post-conviction court recalled that the Petitioner was very alert during\nsaid plea process such that there was no question that he appeared to know and\nunderstand what he was doing. The record also shows that Petitioner had a very\nextensive criminal record and great familiarity with the criminal justice system.\nPetitioner entered his guilty plea to avoid a greater penalty that might have resulted had\nPetitioner’s cases proceeded to trial, as well as to avoid the possibility of a federal\nfirearms charge. That Petitioner was facing the possibility of a lengthier sentence if\nconvicted at trial did not render his plea involuntary. See Blankenship, 858 S.W.2d at\n904. Under the totality of the circumstances, Petitioner’s plea was knowingly and\nvoluntarily entered. He is not entitled to post-conviction relief on this claim.\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n       Based on the foregoing reasoning and authorities, we affirm the post-conviction\ncourt’s denial of Petitioner’s petition for post-conviction relief.\n\n\n                                              ____________________________________\n                                              ROBERT L.
