When a member of Mississippi’s Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS)\n\nchooses to receive reduced monthly retirement payments throughout her life in exchange for\n\nguaranteed payments to her beneficiary for twenty years, who gets the remaining guaranteed\n\npayments if both the retiree and the beneficiary die before the twenty-year period runs out?\n\nAccording to PERS, the retiree’s surviving family members do. But appellant Kayla Vaughn\n\fsays PERS is wrong. Instead, Kayla argues PERS is directed by statute to pay her, the\n\nbeneficiary’s surviving family member, even though she is not related to the retiree.\n\n¶2.    PERS’s payment to the retiree’s surviving family members complied with both the\n\nlanguage of the relevant statute and the retiree’s chosen payment option before the statute\n\nexisted. Yet Kayla asks us to invert the statute and instead declare that an exception to the\n\nstatute is really the rule. But the clear rule is that, when both the retiree and her designated\n\nbeneficiary die, the actuarial equivalent of any future guaranteed payments goes to the\n\nretiree’s surviving family members. And the limited exception is that any uncashed checks\n\nPERS had issued to the beneficiary and any cost-of-living adjustment based on past payments\n\nto the beneficiary go to the beneficiary’s surviving family members.\n\n¶3.    After review, we find PERS followed this rule and its limited exception and, in doing\n\nso, gave effect to the retiree’s intent when selecting her payment option.\n\n¶4.    We therefore affirm.\n\n                       Background Facts and Procedural History\n\n¶5.    Marjorie Kahn was a state employee and consequent member of PERS. In October\n\n1999, she applied for disability retirement. Like other applicants, she was given a choice of\n\npayment options. She chose “Option 4-B.” See Miss. Code Ann. § 25-11-115(1) (Rev.\n\n1999). Under this option, Marjorie would receive “[a] reduced retirement allowance”\n\nthroughout her life in exchange for “the further guarantee of payment to the named\n\nbeneficiary, beneficiaries, or to the estate, for a specified number of years certain.” Id. And\n\nif she or her last designated beneficiary died “prior to receiving all guaranteed payments\n\n                                               2\n\fdue,” then “the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments would be paid to the estate\n\nof the retired as intestate property.” Id.\n\n¶6.    Majorie named her daughter, Heather Vaughn, as her beneficiary. Marjorie named\n\nno other contingent beneficiary. Soon after making these elections, Marjorie died. So under\n\nOption 4-B, PERS began making monthly payments to Heather in the amount of $922.63,\n\nguaranteeing these monthly payments for twenty years, through October 2019.\n\n¶7.    Six months after Marjorie’s death, the Legislature amended section 25-11-115(1).\n\nThe revised Option 4-B directed PERS, in the event “the retired member or the last\n\ndesignated beneficiary both die before receiving all guaranteed payments due,” to pay “the\n\nactuarial equivalent of the remaining payments . . . under [the newly created] Section\n\n25-11-117.1(1)[.]” Miss. Code Ann. § 25-11-115(1) (Rev. 2010) (citing Miss. Code Ann.\n\n§ 25-11-117.1(1) (Rev. 2010), enacted by 2000 Miss. Laws, Ch. 628, § 2 (H.B. 1281)).\n\n¶8.    In August 2011, Heather also died. Traveling under revised Option 4-B, PERS\n\ncalculated the actuarial equivalent of the more than eight years of remaining guaranteed\n\npayments to be $110,163. PERS then looked to section 25-11-117.1(1), which, according\n\nto PERS, directed it to pay the remaining money to Marjorie’s statutory successors.1 So\n\n\n       1\n           Under section 25-11-117.1(1):\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, where benefits\n       are payable to a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries under this article and\n       the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries as provided by the member on the\n       most recent form filed with the system is deceased or otherwise disqualified\n       at the time such benefits become payable, the following persons, in\n       descending order of precedence, shall be eligible to receive such benefits:\n\n                                             3\n\fPERS contacted Marjorie’s family to determine which of Marjorie’s surviving family\n\nmembers were entitled to this payment.\n\n¶9.   PERS also contacted Heather’s family, informing them that, based on subsection (2)\n\nof section 25-11-117.1, they were entitled to a prorated cost-of-living adjustment for the\n\nportion of the 2011-2012 fiscal year when Heather was still alive and received monthly\n\npayments. See Miss. Code Ann. § 25-11-117.1(2).2\n\n\n\n              (a)    The surviving spouse of the member or retiree;\n              (b)    The children of the member or retiree or their\n                     descendants, per stirpes;\n              (c)    The brothers and sisters of the member or retiree or their\n                     descendants, per stirpes;\n              (d)    The parents of the member or retiree;\n              (e)    The executor or administrator on behalf of the member\n                     or retiree’s estate;\n              (f)    The persons entitled by law to distribution of the\n                     member or retiree’s estate.\n      2\n          Under section 25-11-117.1(2):\n\n      Any monthly benefits payable to a beneficiary who dies prior to cashing his\n      or her final check(s) and/or any additional benefits payable pursuant to Section\n      25-11-112 still payable at the death of a beneficiary receiving monthly\n      benefits shall be paid as follows:\n\n              (a)    The surviving spouse of the beneficiary;\n              (b)    The children of the beneficiary or their descendants, per\n                     stirpes;\n              (c)    The brothers and sisters of the beneficiary or their\n                     descendants, per stirpes;\n              (d)    The parents of the beneficiary;\n              (e)    The executor or administrator on behalf of the\n                     beneficiary’s estate;\n              (f)    The persons entitled by law to distribution of the\n                     beneficiary’s estate.\n\n                                             4\n\f¶10.   At this point, Heather’s half-sister, Kayla Vaughn, objected to PERS distributing the\n\nactuarial equivalent of the remaining payments to Marjorie’s statutory successors. Instead,\n\nKayla insisted that even though she is not related to Marjorie,3 PERS should give her the\n\nremainder of Marjorie’s retirement benefits.\n\n¶11.   As Kayla saw it, the $110,163 should have been paid to Heather’s statutory successors\n\nunder section 25-11-117.1(2), not retiree Marjorie’s statutory successors under section 25-11-\n\n117.1(1).     When PERS rejected her position, Kayla asked for and was granted an\n\nadministrative hearing before the Claims Committee for the PERS Board of Trustees. See\n\nMiss. Code Ann. § 25-11-120(1) (Rev. 2010). The Committee confirmed the $110,163 was\n\nto be paid to Marjorie’s successors under subsection (1), not Heather’s successors under\n\nsubsection (2). And the Board of Trustees adopted the Committee’s recommendation.\n\n¶12.   Kayla then appealed to the Hinds County Circuit Court. See Miss. Code Ann. § 25-\n\n11-120(2). The circuit court affirmed PERS’s decision. But the court did grant Kayla’s\n\nrequest to enjoin PERS from disbursing the $110,163 to Marjorie’s successors until Kayla’s\n\nappeal before this court is finally resolved.\n\n                                         Discussion\n\n       I.       Marjorie’s Intent\n\n¶13.   While PERS and Kayla hotly dispute the significance of the language in both revised\n\nOption 4-B and section 25-11-117.1, neither has disputed that this language controls, despite\n\n\n\n       3\n            Heather and Kayla shared the same father but had different mothers.\n\n                                                5\n\fthe fact that section 25-11-117.1 was not even part of the PERS retirement statutes when\n\nMarjorie selected Option 4-B. Still, our law is clear that these statutes cannot be applied in\n\na way that defeats the clear intention of the deceased retired member. In re Estate of Dillon,\n\n632 So. 2d 1298, 1303-04 (Miss. 1994); see also Pub. Emps’ Ret. Sys. v. Porter, 763 So. 2d\n\n845, 849-50 (¶¶14-16) (Miss. 2000).\n\n¶14.     By selecting Option 4-B—as that option existed in 1999—Marjorie’s intent was\n\nobvious. She chose the particular option that ensured her that if she and Heather both die\n\nbefore all guaranteed payments were made, Majorie’s intestate estate—i.e., Marjorie’s\n\nstatutory heirs—would receive the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments. This\n\nmuch is crystal clear. And it is inconceivable from the PERS statutes in effect at the time of\n\nMajorie’s retirement application and soon-after death that Marjorie intended any remaining\n\nretirement benefits would go to Heather’s heirs, should Heather die before all payments were\n\nmade.\n\n¶15.     So even if we were to agree with the dissent that Kayla’s interpretation of sections 25-\n\n11-115(1) and 25-11-117.1 was correct—which we do not—we would still have to reject this\n\ninterpretation as applied to Marjorie’s retirement benefits. See Porter, 763 So. 2d at 849-50\n\n(¶¶14-16). Had PERS done what Kayla and the dissent suggest and paid Heather’s heirs,\n\ninstead of Marjorie’s, it would have unconstitutionally impaired Marjorie’s contractual right\n\nto have her heirs receive the remainder of her retirement if both she and Heather died before\n\nall guaranteed payments were made. Id. (citing U.S. Const. art. I, § 10; Miss. Const. art. 3,\n\n§ 16).\n\n                                                6\n\f¶16.   Unlike Kayla’s and the dissent’s personal interpretations, PERS’s interpretation of\n\nsection 25-11-117.1 has the advantage of actually effecting Majorie’s intent. And because\n\nKayla’s interpretation directly conflicts with Majorie’s clear intent—that her next of kin, not\n\nHeather’s, would receive any remaining guaranteed payments if both she and Heather died\n\nbefore 2019—we must reject it.\n\n       II.    PERS’s Interpretation\n\n¶17.   Furthermore, PERS’s interpretation has the additional advantage of being supported\n\nby the statute’s language.\n\n              A.     Standard of Review\n\n¶18.   Because this appeal raises a question of statutory interpretation, Kayla asserts we must\n\nreview PERS’s decision de novo. While it is true that “[a]n agency’s interpretation of its\n\ngoverning statutes is reviewed de novo,” our supreme court has said we must conduct this\n\nreview “with deference to the agency’s interpretation.” Miss. State & Sch. Emps’ Life &\n\nHealth Plan v. KCC, Inc., 108 So. 3d 932, 939 (¶20) (Miss. 2013). “[W]hen determining\n\nthe most reasonable and appropriate interpretation of a statute, the agency’s interpretation\n\nis an important factor that usually warrants strong consideration.” Diamond Grove Ctr., LLC\n\nv. Miss. State Dep’t of Health, 98 So. 3d 1068, 1071 (¶9) (Miss. 2012). So “unless an\n\nagency’s interpretation of a governing statute is repugnant to the plain meaning thereof, the\n\ncourts are to defer to the agency’s interpretation.” Id.\n\n¶19.   Stated differently, we only “give no weight to an agency interpretation” when it “is\n\nso plainly erroneous or so inconsistent with either the underlying regulation or statute as to\n\n                                              7\n\fbe arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the unambiguous language or best reading of a\n\nstatute.” KCC, 108 So. 3d at 939 (¶20). This means we cannot take the dissent’s approach\n\nand substitute PERS’s interpretation of section 25-11-117.1 with our personal preference of\n\nhow to read the statute. We must instead uphold PERS’s decision to pay Majorie’s heirs, not\n\nHeather’s, so long as its statutory interpretation was not so inconsistent with the relevant\n\nstatutes as to be arbitrary and capricious. Because we find PERS’s decision was based on\n\na reasonable interpretation of sections 25-11-115(1) and 25-11-117.1(1), consistent with the\n\n“best reading” of these statutes, and certainly not arbitrary and capricious, we must affirm.\n\n               B.     “Monthly Benefits Payable”\n\n¶20.   Revised Option 4-B directs that, when both the retiree and her named beneficiary have\n\ndied, “the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments shall be paid under Section 25-11-\n\n117.1(1).” Miss. Code Ann. § 25-11-115(1) (Rev. 2010). Section 25-11-117.1(1) begins by\n\nnoting there is an exception—“Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) . . . .” Kayla\n\nargues this “prefatory phrase” is there to steer PERS immediately to subsection (2) and first\n\ndetermine if its provisions apply.       If they do, then according to Kayla the rest of\n\nsubsection (1) “is negated” and has no application whatsoever.\n\n¶21.   As one would imagine, Kayla argues subsection (2) applies here. Under this\n\nsubsection, “Any monthly benefits payable to a beneficiary who dies prior to cashing his or\n\nher final check(s) and/or any additional benefits payable pursuant to Section 25-11-112 still\n\npayable at the death of a beneficiary receiving monthly benefits shall be paid . . . [to] brothers\n\nand sisters of the beneficiary” when the beneficiary has no surviving spouse or descendants.\n\n                                                8\n\fMiss. Code Ann. § 25-11-117.1(2). Kayla claims, since Option 4-B guaranteed Heather\n\nmonthly payments for twenty years, the remaining eight years of payments were “monthly\n\nbenefits payable to a beneficiary who dies prior to cashing his or her final check(s)[.]” Miss.\n\nCode Ann. § 25-11-117.1(2).\n\n¶22.   In other words, Kayla is arguing that all twenty years worth of checks were “monthly\n\nbenefits payable” to Heather the moment Marjorie died. She claims they belonged to the\n\nbeneficiary, Heather, not the retiree, Marjorie. Thus, they should have passed to Heather’s\n\nstatutory successors. Kayla suggests that, if Marjorie had wanted one of her relatives to\n\nreceive the money if Heather died, Majorie should have named a contingency beneficiary.\n\n¶23.   Likewise, the dissent points to the lack of a contingent beneficiary as justification for\n\nawarding the remainder of Marjorie’s retirement benefits to someone that is not her heir. See\n\nDis. Op. at (¶63). But the very fact Marjorie could have named a contingent beneficiary\n\nundercuts Kayla’s argument that all twenty years worth of retirement benefits fully vested\n\nin Heather the moment Marjorie died. Had Marjorie named a contingent beneficiary, the\n\nremaining payments would have gone directly to that person, not Heather. And Heather\n\nwould have had zero ability to override Marjorie’s designation and redirect to whom the\n\nremaining payments would go in the event of her own death. Further, Marjorie did not have\n\nto name a contingent beneficiary to control what would happen to her benefits if both she and\n\nHeather died before 2019. That is because Option 4-B has a built-in contingency. In this\n\nscenario, the built-in contingency directed that the remaining benefits would be paid to\n\nMarjorie’s heirs. So by selecting Option 4-B, Marjorie directed exactly what would happen\n\n                                               9\n\fto her benefits in this event.\n\n¶24.   The dissent’s preferred method only works if all the remaining monthly payments\n\nvested in Heather the moment Majorie died. But this was not so. Heather only had a right\n\nto each monthly payment the month its became “payable”—i.e., due and owing. At no point\n\ncould Heather have demanded PERS hand over the remaining payments early. Thus, the\n\nonly “monthly benefits payable” to Heather at the time she died death were the monthly\n\npayments that had already become due. No future monthly payments were “payable” to\n\nHeather once she died. Instead, the remaining monthly payments had to be paid according\n\nto Option 4-B.\n\n               C.     The Exception and the Rule\n\n¶25.   Revised Option 4-B is clear. It specifically says that the actuarial equivalent of the\n\nremaining payments shall be paid under subsection (1) of section 25-11-117.1. Revised\n\nOption 4-B does not reference section 25-11-117.1 generally, nor does it mention\n\nsubsection (2) specifically. Instead, it specifically directs PERS to act under the provision\n\nof subsection (1) of 25-11-117.1. Miss. Code Ann. § 25-11-115(1) (Rev. 2010).\n\n¶26.   Kayla skirts this clear directive by arguing subsection (1) begins with a redirect to\n\nsubsection (2). The dissent echos this view. See Dis. Op. at (¶65). Essentially, they argue\n\nthe exception to subsection (1) is the actual rule. But this argument practically renders the\n\nprovisions of subsection (1) irrelevant—the very provision section 25-11-115(1) expressly\n\nsays shall govern.\n\n¶27.   According to Kayla and the dissent, subsection (1) would only apply when the\n\n                                             10\n\fbeneficiary predeceases the retiree. While we agree that this scenario certainly is possible,\n\nthe obvious anticipated outcome is that the retiree will predecease the beneficiary. After all,\n\nthe whole reason a retiree names a beneficiary is for the perceived and much more probable\n\noutcome that the retiree will die first.      But as Kayla interprets section 25-11-117.1,\n\nsubsection (1)’s provisions were designed for the much less likely outcome—i.e., the\n\n“exception”—while subsection (2)’s provisions are really the rule. The problem with this\n\ninterpretation is that, based on the plain language of section 25-11-117.1, the Legislature\n\ndesignated subsection (2) as an “except[ion]” to subsection (1)’s rule.\n\n¶28.   Equally clear is revised Option 4-B’s language that subsection (1) of section 25-11-\n\n117.1 is to govern who is paid the actuarial equivalent of remaining payments, not\n\nsubsection (2). Miss. Code Ann. § 25-11-115(1) (Rev. 2010). So PERS’s interpretation is\n\nnot only reasonable, it is correct. Subsection (2)’s provisions are only to govern payment of\n\nchecks already issued to the beneficiary but uncashed and other payments still payable to the\n\nbeneficiary when he or she dies—like the cost-of-living adjustment PERS paid Kayla as\n\nHeather’s successor.\n\n¶29.   “The primary rule of [statutory] construction is to ascertain the intent of the legislature\n\nfrom the statute as a whole and from the language used therein.” In re Guardianship of\n\nDuckett, 991 So. 2d 1165, 1181-82 (¶37) (Miss. 2008) (emphasis added and citation omitted).\n\nAnd here, based on the structure of section 25-11-117.1, when read as a whole, it is clear the\n\nLegislature intended for subsection (1) to govern payment of the lump-sum actuarial\n\nequivalent of any remaining future payments, while subsection (2) is to govern payments\n\n                                               11\n\falready sent to the beneficiary and any other benefit that “still payable at the death” of the\n\nbeneficiary.\n\n¶30.   Under this straightforward interpretation, the legislative intent in the revised\n\nOption 4-B lines up directly with Majorie’s intent in selecting the old Option 4-B—that her\n\nstatutory heirs would receive the actuarial equivalent of any remaining payments. By\n\ncontrast, Kayla’s argument relies on her claim that it is plainly and unambiguously the\n\nLegislature’s intent that she—who is of no relation whatsoever to a state retiree—should\n\nreceive more than $100,000 in state retirement benefits. We find the language of the statute\n\nsimply does not support this view.\n\n¶31.   Instead, the succinct rule is that the retiree’s family gets the actuarial equivalent of\n\nthe remaining guaranteed payments when both the retiree and her designated beneficiary (or\n\nbeneficiaries) are dead. The limited exception is that any monthly check already written but\n\nnot cashed by the deceased beneficiary (plus any cost-of-living adjustment for payments\n\nalready made) shall be paid to that beneficiary’s surviving family members. PERS followed\n\nthe rule and its limited exception. Therefore, we affirm its decision.\n\n¶32. THE JUDGMENT OF THE HINDS COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT IS\nAFFIRMED. ALL COSTS OF THIS APPEAL ARE ASSESSED TO THE\nAPPELLANT.\n\n    LEE, C.J., BARNES, ROBERTS, CARLTON, FAIR AND JAMES, JJ.,\nCONCUR. IRVING, P.J., CONCURS IN PART AND IN THE RESULT WITHOUT\nSEPARATE WRITTEN OPINION. GRIFFIS, P.J., DISSENTS WITH SEPARATE\nWRITTEN OPINION, JOINED BY ISHEE, J.\n\n       GRIFFIS, P.J., DISSENTING:\n\n\n                                              12\n\f¶33.   The question to be decided is: who is entitled to be paid $110,163.58, the amount of\n\nthe remaining guaranteed annuity payments that were owed by PERS at the death of Marjorie\n\nKahn’s designated beneficiary, Heather Vaughn? The majority concludes that Marjorie’s\n\nestate is entitled to the payment. I find that Heather’s heirs are entitled to the payment.\n\nTherefore, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                         FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n¶34.   I disagree slightly with the majority’s version of the facts and procedural history. The\n\nmajority makes it appear as if Kayla Vaughn was the only party in this litigation that argued\n\nMississippi Code Annotated section 25-11-117.1 governed the outcome of this appeal. Such\n\nwas not the case. PERS’s executive director, its staff, Board of Trustees, and the circuit court\n\nall determined that section 25-11-117.1 governed this decision. Indeed, no party or court has\n\nargued or considered that the now-repealed version of Mississippi Code Annotated section\n\n25-11-115(1) (Supp. 1999) may govern the outcome of this litigation until now.\n\n¶35.   The facts are not in dispute.\n\n¶36.   Marjorie retired on PERS disability retirement, effective November 1, 1999. She\n\nelected to receive benefits pursuant to Option 4-B under Mississippi Code Annotated section\n\n25-11-115(1) (Supp. 1999). At that time, Option 4-B read:\n\n       A reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of the\n       retirant, but with the further guarantee of payments to the named beneficiary,\n       beneficiaries, or to the estate, for a specified number of years certain. If the\n       retired member or the last designated beneficiary receiving annuity payments\n       dies prior to receiving all guaranteed payments due, the actuarial equivalent of\n       the remaining payments would be paid to the estate of the retired as intestate\n       property.\n\n                                              13\n\fUnder the first sentence of this option, Marjorie selected a twenty-year period. As a result\n\nof her decision, Marjorie’s benefits under Option 4B were to end on October 1, 2019.\n\n¶37.   Marjorie designated Heather, her daughter, as her beneficiary. Marjorie could have\n\nalso named a contingent beneficiary in the event of Heather’s death, but chose not to name\n\na contingent beneficiary.\n\n¶38.   Marjorie died January 1, 2000. At that time, PERS had not paid any of the benefit\n\npayments. As a result, PERS began to make payments to Heather as Marjorie’s designated\n\nOption 4-B beneficiary.\n\n¶39.   Heather died in August 2011. PERS continued to pay monthly benefits to Heather\n\nuntil her death.\n\n¶40.   Upon receipt of notice and verification of Heather’s death, PERS checked Marjorie’s\n\nfile at PERS to see if she had named a contingent beneficiary in the event her primary\n\nbeneficiary died before the expiration of the twenty-year period. If Marjorie had named a\n\ncontingent beneficiary, PERS would have paid the remaining monthly benefits to that person.\n\nPERS’s review determined that Marjorie had not named a contingent beneficiary. Because\n\nof Marjorie’s death, Heather’s death, and the lack of a contingent beneficiary, PERS had to\n\nidentify to whom the remaining benefits should be paid.\n\n¶41.   PERS determined that Marjorie’s file did not include the name of any next-of-kin.\n\nPERS sent a notice to Marjorie’s family that informed them of Heather’s death and stated\n\nthat the remaining balance would be paid to Marjorie’s statutory successors under\n\nMississippi Code Annotated section 25-11-117.1(1).\n\n                                            14\n\f¶42.   Toni Vaughn, Heather’s stepmother, contacted PERS on behalf of her daughter,\n\nKayla. Kayla was Heather’s half-sister. Kayla and Heather had the same father, but Kayla\n\nwas not related by blood to Marjorie. Kayla claimed that the remaining annuity benefits\n\nshould be paid to her as Heather’s next-of-kin and not to Marjorie’s heirs. Through counsel,\n\nKayla requested a hearing pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated section 25-11-120, if\n\nPERS maintained its position that payment should be paid to Marjorie’s heirs pursuant to\n\nsection 25-11-117.1(1).\n\n¶43.   By letter dated November 8, 2011, Pat Robertson, PERS’s executive director, sent an\n\nadministrative decision letter to Kayla’s attorney that stated PERS’s decision:\n\n       Section 25-11-117.1(1) applies to benefits that are the property of the deceased\n       member and that become payable to the successors of the deceased member\n       in the absence of a named beneficiary. Section . . . 25-11-117.1(2) applies\n       specifically to monthly benefits due and payable to a beneficiary who dies\n       before he or she has the opportunity to negotiate or cash a check or checks\n       issued before his or her death. Because monthly benefits are no longer payable\n       to a beneficiary receiving monthly benefits upon his or her death, no further\n       benefits were payable to Ms. Heather Ann Vaughn upon her death; thus, no\n       benefits are payable to Ms. Heather Ann Vaughn’s successor(s) from PERS.\n\n¶44.   Kayla appealed the decision to the PERS Board of Trustees. A hearing was held\n\nbefore the Claims Committee of the Board of Trustees on January 24, 2012.\n\n¶45.   Bob Rhoads, PERS senior policy advisor, testified that section 25-11-117.1 was\n\nactually enacted to be effective July 1, 2000, after Marjorie’s death. Prior to that time,\n\npursuant to section 25-11-115(1), “Option 4B provided that the present value of the\n\nremaining payments would be payable to the estate of the deceased member or retiree . . . .”\n\nRhoads also testified that he was employed by PERS in 2000 when the PERS Board of\n\n                                             15\n\fTrustees requested the new legislation as part of its proposed legislative package for that\n\nyear. The request was made because the previous language gave PERS no alternative but to\n\npay the present value of remaining benefits to the member/retiree’s estate, which often\n\nrequired the opening or reopening of an estate many years after the death of the\n\nmember/retiree. Rhoads stated, “it was the intent of the staff and the Board to not change the\n\nfact that the present value of the remaining payments [was] due to the successors of the\n\ndeceased member or retiree. We just wanted to find a more convenient way for the\n\nsuccessors to make a claim directly with PERS rather than through an Estate.”\n\n¶46.    Following the hearing, the Claims Committee found “that the actuarial equivalent of\n\nthe remaining payments are to be paid to the statutory successors of the deceased\n\nmember/retiree, Marjorie Ann Kahn, as listed in Section 25-11-117.1(1)[,] because the\n\ndesignated beneficiary, Heather Ann Vaughn, was deceased when such benefits would have\n\nbecome payable, and Ms. Kahn did not designate a contingent beneficiary.”\n\n¶47.    Pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated section 25-11-120(2) (Rev. 2010), Kayla\n\nappealed the PERS decision to the Hinds County Circuit Court. The circuit court granted\n\nKayla’s request for a preliminary injunction and enjoined PERS from distributing funds from\n\nMarjorie’s account during the pendency of the appeal. Then, on June 21, 2013, based on the\n\nbriefs submitted, the circuit court entered its opinion and order that affirmed the decision of\n\nPERS.\n\n                                         ANALYSIS\n\n        I.    Marjorie’s Intent\n\n                                              16\n\f¶48.   In its first section, the majority determines that “[b]ased on Option 4-B — as that\n\noption existed in 1999 — Marjorie’s clear intent was that, should she and Heather both die\n\nbefore all guaranteed payments were made, Majorie’s intestate estate — i.e., Marjorie’s\n\nstatutory heirs — would receive the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments.” To\n\ndecide Marjorie’s “clear intent,” the majority sua sponte decided that the pre-amendment\n\nversion of section 25-11-115(1) would govern the outcome of this case even though no party\n\nhas argued it as governing law.\n\n¶49.   PERS does not make this argument. Instead, PERS’s supplemental brief, which asked\n\nwhether the repealed statute applied, stated: “PERS would argue that the 2000 amendment\n\nto Miss. Code Ann. § 25-11-115 and the enactment of § 25-11-117.1, as it has been\n\ninterpreted by PERS, do[] not deprive [Marjorie] of a significant contractual right.” PERS\n\nargues that the post-amendment, current version of section 25-11-117.1 governs.\n\n¶50.   Nevertheless, the majority cites In re Estate of Dillon, 632 So. 2d 1298, 1303-04\n\n(Miss. 1994), and Public Employees’ Retirement System v. Porter, 763 So. 2d 845, 849-50\n\n(¶¶14-16) (Miss. 2000), for the general legal proposition that a PERS statute “cannot be\n\napplied in a way that defeats the clear intention of the deceased retired member.” The\n\nmajority does not explain how these cases are applicable or relevant. I am of the opinion\n\nthat these cases are taken out of context or are factually distinguishable. Neither is directly\n\non point.\n\n¶51.   Indeed, PERS’s argument that the amendment to section 25-11-115(1) “does not\n\ndeprive [Marjorie] of a significant contractual right” should indicate that this Court should\n\n                                              17\n\fnot interject its research and legal reasoning to decide this case. The majority says it knows\n\nMarjorie’s “clear intent,” but I do not. To me, it is important that throughout this entire\n\ndispute, PERS’s staff, PERS’s executive director, PERS’s Board of Trustees, and the circuit\n\ncourt judge have all relied on and based their decision on their interpretation of Mississippi\n\nCode Annotated section 25-11-117.1(1). This was the result of their reliance on the amended\n\nversion of section 25-11-115(1), which referred to section 25-11-117.1(1) for resolution of\n\nthis payment dispute.\n\n¶52.   Furthermore, the pre-amendment language of Option 4-B does not decide our\n\ninterpretation because the Legislature amended the statute without a savings clause. The\n\neffect of the Legislature’s act was to abrogate the pre-amendment statutory language as if it\n\nnever existed. The Mississippi Supreme Court summarized this general rule as follows:\n\n       Many decisions in this state have affirmed the rule, which generally prevails,\n       that the effect of a repealing statute is to abrogate the repealed statute as\n       completely as if it had never been passed, and that a statute modifying a\n       previous statute has the same effect as though the statute had all the while\n       previously existed in the same language as that contained in the modified\n       statute, unless the repealing or modifying statute contains a saving clause . . .\n       .\n\n       The result of this rule is that every right or remedy created solely by the\n       repealed or modified statute disappears or falls with the repealed or modified\n       statute, unless carried to final judgment before the repeal or modification, save\n       that no such repeal or modification shall be permitted to impair the obligation\n       of a contract or to abrogate a vested right.\n\nStone v. Indep. Linen Serv. Co., 212 Miss. 580, 586-87, 55 So. 2d 165, 168 (1951) (internal\n\nquotations omitted); see also USPCI of Miss., Inc., v. State, 688 So. 2d 783, 786-87 (Miss.\n\n1997) (“An amended act is ordinarily construed as if the original statute had been repealed,\n\n                                              18\n\fand as far as any action after the adoption of the amendment is concerned, as if the statute\n\nhad been originally enacted in its amended form.”).\n\n¶53.   I recognize that, on October 11, 1999, Marjorie executed her application for disability\n\nbenefits, and she selected Option 4-B with twenty years certain. She died less than three\n\nmonths later. The law in effect at that time, Mississippi Code Annotated section\n\n25-11-115(1), Option 4-B (repealed 2000), provided that “[i]f the retired member or the last\n\ndesignated beneficiary receiving annuity payments dies prior to receiving all guaranteed\n\npayments due, the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments would be paid to the estate\n\nof the retired as intestate property.”\n\n¶54.   In fact, as of Marjorie’s death, the Legislature determined that the deceased member’s\n\nestate would be the catch-all recipient for Option 4-B benefits remaining after the death of\n\nthe member and her last designated beneficiary. However, this catch-all provision did not\n\napply at Marjorie’s death because her beneficiary was still alive. Based on Marjorie’s\n\nelection, PERS was obligated to pay Heather $922.63 each month until her last check on\n\nOctober 1, 2019.\n\n¶55.   Just before Heather began to receive the Option 4-B benefits, the Legislature amended\n\nthe statutory scheme under which these benefits were paid. The statutory change became\n\neffective on July 1, 2000. Mississippi Code Annotated section 25-11-115(1) was amended,\n\nand Mississippi Code Annotated section 25-11-117.1 was created. The amended language\n\nof section 25-11-115(1) was changed to read:\n\n       A reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of the\n\n                                             19\n\f       retirant, but with the further guarantee of payments to the named beneficiary\n       or beneficiaries for a specified number of years certain. If the retired member\n       or the last designated beneficiary both die before receiving all guaranteed\n       payments due, the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments shall be\n       paid under Section 25-11-117.1(1).\n\n(Emphasis added). The Legislature changed the catch-all provision. Effective July 1, 2000,\n\nif both the member and last designated beneficiary died before the expiration of the sum-\n\ncertain period, PERS was directed to pay the remaining benefits pursuant to Mississippi Code\n\nAnnotated section 25-11-117.1(1). There was no savings clause in the legislation. The\n\nlegislation did not distinguish between members who joined PERS before or after the\n\neffective date of July 1, 2000. PERS, the sponsor of this legislation, admits this fact.4 And\n\nthe majority does not address it. What is clear is that the Legislature directed that section\n\n25-11-117.1 be applied to any instance occurring after July 1, 2000, where benefits remain\n\nafter the death of both the member and the member’s last designated beneficiary.\n\n¶56.   Throughout this matter, until now, the parties agreed that the current Mississippi Code\n\nAnnotated sections 25-11-115(1) and 117.1 were the applicable statutes and governed the\n\noutcome of this dispute. They, however, disagreed as to the proper interpretation of those\n\nstatutes. I disagree with and dissent from the majority’s decision to apply the now-repealed\n\n\n\n       4\n           During the administrative hearing, it was noted that Marjorie's application for\nbenefits was completed before the statutory change to Option 4-B, which occurred on July\n1, 2000. PERS senior policy advisor Bob Rhoads testified as to the effect that the\npre-2000-amendment language had on the manner in which PERS paid the $110,163 in\nremaining benefits. Mr. Rhoads stated that “[t]he law was changed in 2000. How we paid\nthe present value is applied prospectively to all. We didn't segregate if you retired before\nthis date this rule applied; if you retire from and after this date, another rule applies.”\n\n                                             20\n\fversion of section 25-11-115(1).\n\n       II.    PERS’s Interpretation\n\n¶57.   The majority also includes an alternate finding as to the resolution under section 25-\n\n11-117.1(1). I disagree with and dissent from this interpretation.\n\n¶58.   On October 11, 1999, Marjorie made a decision as to her PERS benefits when she\n\nsigned her application for disability benefits and chose Option 4-B. At Marjorie’s death,\n\nPERS began to pay Heather the guaranteed monthly benefits.\n\n¶59.   At the time of Heather’s death, section 25-11-115(1), Option 4-B provided:\n\n       A reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of the\n       retirant, but with the further guarantee of payments to the named beneficiary\n       or beneficiaries for a specified number of years certain. If the retired member\n       or the last designated beneficiary both die before receiving all guaranteed\n       payments due, the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments shall be\n       paid under Section 25-11-117.1(1).\n\n(Emphasis added). Section 25-11-117.1, titled “Recipients of additional benefits payable and\n\nchecks not yet cashed when beneficiary dies or is disqualified,” reads:\n\n       (1)    Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, where\n              benefits are payable to a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries under\n              this article and the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries as provided\n              by the member on the most recent form filed with the system is\n              deceased or otherwise disqualified at the time such benefits become\n              payable, the following persons, in descending order of precedence,\n              shall be eligible to receive such benefits:\n\n              (a)    The surviving spouse of the member or retiree;\n              (b)    The children of the member or retiree or their\n                     descendants, per stirpes;\n              (c)    The brothers and sisters of the member or retiree or their\n                     descendants, per stirpes;\n              (d)    The parents of the member or retiree;\n\n                                             21\n\f              (e)     The executor or administrator on behalf of the member or\n                      retiree's estate;\n              (f)     The persons entitled by law to distribution of the member\n                      or retiree's estate.\n\n       (2)    Any monthly benefits payable to a beneficiary who dies prior to cashing\n              his or her final check(s) and/or any additional benefits payable\n              pursuant to Section 25-11-112 still payable at the death of a beneficiary\n              receiving monthly benefits shall be paid as follows:\n\n              (a)     The surviving spouse of the beneficiary;\n              (b)     The children of the beneficiary or their descendants, per\n                      stirpes;\n              (c)     The brothers and sisters of the beneficiary or their\n                      descendants, per stirpes;\n              (d)     The parents of the beneficiary;\n              (e)     The executor or administrator on behalf of the\n                      beneficiary's estate;\n              (f)     The persons entitled by law to distribution of the\n                      beneficiary's estate.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n¶60.   Marjorie chose Option 4-B, under section 25-11-115(1). This governs how her\n\nbenefits are to be paid.\n\n¶61.   The benefits are first paid to the retirant. Marjorie was entitled to “a reduced\n\nretirement allowance” during her life “but with the further guarantee of payments to the\n\nnamed beneficiary or beneficiaries for a specified number of years certain.” Id. (emphasis\n\nadded). Marjorie was entitled to be paid a monthly benefit during her life, and Marjorie was\n\nable to name a person who would be entitled to a “guarantee of payments” for twenty years.\n\nId.\n\n¶62.   Next, at the death of the retirant, the benefits are to be paid to the retirant’s designated\n\n\n                                               22\n\fbeneficiary. Id. Marjorie designated Heather to receive the “guarantee of payments.”\n\nHeather was paid benefits for approximately eleven years.\n\n¶63.   At Heather’s death, under Option 4-B, Marjorie could have designated a contingent\n\nbeneficiary to receive the remaining benefits. She could have named any person, entity, or\n\nher estate. She chose not to name a contingent beneficiary.\n\n¶64.   Because the guaranteed payments were not paid in full, section 25-11-115(1) provided\n\nhow the remaining benefits would be paid. Option 4-B also provided that if the “retired\n\nmember [Marjorie] or the last designated beneficiary [Heather] both die before receiving all\n\nguaranteed payments due, the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments shall be paid\n\nunder Section 25-11-117.1(1).” Miss. Code Ann. § 25-11-115(1).\n\n¶65.   Therefore, I move to section 25-11-117.1, which is titled, “Persons to whom benefits\n\npayable in event of death of designated beneficiary.” Subsection (1) reads:\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, where benefits\n       are payable to a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries under this article and\n       the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries as provided by the member on the\n       most recent form filed with the system is deceased or otherwise disqualified\n       at the time such benefits become payable, the following persons, in descending\n       order of precedence, shall be eligible to receive such benefits: . . . .\n\nThe subsection begins with the phrase “[e]xcept as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of\n\nthis section.” We must consider the effect of this language; we cannot ignore it.\n\n¶66.   If we consider subsection (1) without the reference to subsection (2), it says: “[W]here\n\nbenefits are payable to a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries under this article and the\n\ndesignated beneficiary or beneficiaries . . . is deceased or otherwise disqualified at the time\n\n\n                                              23\n\fsuch benefits become payable . . . .” (Emphasis added). I read this language to say that\n\nsubsection (1) only applies where the designated beneficiary “is deceased or otherwise\n\ndisqualified at the time such benefits become payable.” This language specifically looks at\n\nthe point in time that the retirant dies and the guaranteed payment vests in the designated\n\nbeneficiary(ies). I am of the opinion that subsection (1) only applies when the designated\n\nbeneficiaries are dead or disqualified at the time the retirant dies, and then the amount of the\n\nguaranteed payments would be paid to the retirant’s heirs based on subsection (1).\n\n¶67.   Subsection (2) is clear that it applies to any guaranteed benefits vested in the\n\nbeneficiaries. Subsection (2) reads: “[A]ny monthly benefits payable to a beneficiary who\n\ndies prior to cashing his or her final check(s) . . . shall be paid as follows . . . .” Here, there\n\nis no dispute that Heather died before “cashing . . . her final checks.” As a result, I am of\n\nthe opinion that the statutory scheme that controls the payment of the guaranteed payments\n\nis section 25-11-117.1(2), and the remaining balance should be paid to Kayla.\n\n¶68.   Because I would reverse and render the judgment of the circuit court, I respectfully\n\ndissent.\n\n       ISHEE, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n\n\n\n\n                                                24\n\f",

When a member of Mississippi’s Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS)\n\nchooses to receive reduced monthly retirement payments throughout her life in exchange for\n\nguaranteed payments to her beneficiary for twenty years, who gets the remaining guaranteed\n\npayments if both the retiree and the beneficiary die before the twenty-year period runs out?\n\nAccording to PERS, the retiree’s surviving family members do. But appellant Kayla Vaughn\n\fsays PERS is wrong. Instead, Kayla argues PERS is directed by statute to pay her, the\n\nbeneficiary’s surviving family member, even though she is not related to the retiree.\n\n¶2.    PERS’s payment to the retiree’s surviving family members complied with both the\n\nlanguage of the relevant statute and the retiree’s chosen payment option before the statute\n\nexisted. Yet Kayla asks us to invert the statute and instead declare that an exception to the\n\nstatute is really the rule. But the clear rule is that, when both the retiree and her designated\n\nbeneficiary die, the actuarial equivalent of any future guaranteed payments goes to the\n\nretiree’s surviving family members. And the limited exception is that any uncashed checks\n\nPERS had issued to the beneficiary and any cost-of-living adjustment based on past payments\n\nto the beneficiary go to the beneficiary’s surviving family members.\n\n¶3.    After review, we find PERS followed this rule and its limited exception and, in doing\n\nso, gave effect to the retiree’s intent when selecting her payment option.\n\n¶4.    We therefore affirm.\n\n                       Background Facts and Procedural History\n\n¶5.    Marjorie Kahn was a state employee and consequent member of PERS. In October\n\n1999, she applied for disability retirement. Like other applicants, she was given a choice of\n\npayment options. She chose “Option 4-B.” See Miss. Code Ann. § 25-11-115(1) (Rev.\n\n1999). Under this option, Marjorie would receive “[a] reduced retirement allowance”\n\nthroughout her life in exchange for “the further guarantee of payment to the named\n\nbeneficiary, beneficiaries, or to the estate, for a specified number of years certain.” Id. And\n\nif she or her last designated beneficiary died “prior to receiving all guaranteed payments\n\n                                               2\n\fdue,” then “the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments would be paid to the estate\n\nof the retired as intestate property.” Id.\n\n¶6.    Majorie named her daughter, Heather Vaughn, as her beneficiary. Marjorie named\n\nno other contingent beneficiary. Soon after making these elections, Marjorie died. So under\n\nOption 4-B, PERS began making monthly payments to Heather in the amount of $922.63,\n\nguaranteeing these monthly payments for twenty years, through October 2019.\n\n¶7.    Six months after Marjorie’s death, the Legislature amended section 25-11-115(1).\n\nThe revised Option 4-B directed PERS, in the event “the retired member or the last\n\ndesignated beneficiary both die before receiving all guaranteed payments due,” to pay “the\n\nactuarial equivalent of the remaining payments . . . under [the newly created] Section\n\n25-11-117.1(1)[.]” Miss. Code Ann. § 25-11-115(1) (Rev. 2010) (citing Miss. Code Ann.\n\n§ 25-11-117.1(1) (Rev. 2010), enacted by 2000 Miss. Laws, Ch. 628, § 2 (H.B. 1281)).\n\n¶8.    In August 2011, Heather also died. Traveling under revised Option 4-B, PERS\n\ncalculated the actuarial equivalent of the more than eight years of remaining guaranteed\n\npayments to be $110,163. PERS then looked to section 25-11-117.1(1), which, according\n\nto PERS, directed it to pay the remaining money to Marjorie’s statutory successors.1 So\n\n\n       1\n           Under section 25-11-117.1(1):\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, where benefits\n       are payable to a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries under this article and\n       the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries as provided by the member on the\n       most recent form filed with the system is deceased or otherwise disqualified\n       at the time such benefits become payable, the following persons, in\n       descending order of precedence, shall be eligible to receive such benefits:\n\n                                             3\n\fPERS contacted Marjorie’s family to determine which of Marjorie’s surviving family\n\nmembers were entitled to this payment.\n\n¶9.   PERS also contacted Heather’s family, informing them that, based on subsection (2)\n\nof section 25-11-117.1, they were entitled to a prorated cost-of-living adjustment for the\n\nportion of the 2011-2012 fiscal year when Heather was still alive and received monthly\n\npayments. See Miss. Code Ann. § 25-11-117.1(2).2\n\n\n\n              (a)    The surviving spouse of the member or retiree;\n              (b)    The children of the member or retiree or their\n                     descendants, per stirpes;\n              (c)    The brothers and sisters of the member or retiree or their\n                     descendants, per stirpes;\n              (d)    The parents of the member or retiree;\n              (e)    The executor or administrator on behalf of the member\n                     or retiree’s estate;\n              (f)    The persons entitled by law to distribution of the\n                     member or retiree’s estate.\n      2\n          Under section 25-11-117.1(2):\n\n      Any monthly benefits payable to a beneficiary who dies prior to cashing his\n      or her final check(s) and/or any additional benefits payable pursuant to Section\n      25-11-112 still payable at the death of a beneficiary receiving monthly\n      benefits shall be paid as follows:\n\n              (a)    The surviving spouse of the beneficiary;\n              (b)    The children of the beneficiary or their descendants, per\n                     stirpes;\n              (c)    The brothers and sisters of the beneficiary or their\n                     descendants, per stirpes;\n              (d)    The parents of the beneficiary;\n              (e)    The executor or administrator on behalf of the\n                     beneficiary’s estate;\n              (f)    The persons entitled by law to distribution of the\n                     beneficiary’s estate.\n\n                                             4\n\f¶10.   At this point, Heather’s half-sister, Kayla Vaughn, objected to PERS distributing the\n\nactuarial equivalent of the remaining payments to Marjorie’s statutory successors. Instead,\n\nKayla insisted that even though she is not related to Marjorie,3 PERS should give her the\n\nremainder of Marjorie’s retirement benefits.\n\n¶11.   As Kayla saw it, the $110,163 should have been paid to Heather’s statutory successors\n\nunder section 25-11-117.1(2), not retiree Marjorie’s statutory successors under section 25-11-\n\n117.1(1).     When PERS rejected her position, Kayla asked for and was granted an\n\nadministrative hearing before the Claims Committee for the PERS Board of Trustees. See\n\nMiss. Code Ann. § 25-11-120(1) (Rev. 2010). The Committee confirmed the $110,163 was\n\nto be paid to Marjorie’s successors under subsection (1), not Heather’s successors under\n\nsubsection (2). And the Board of Trustees adopted the Committee’s recommendation.\n\n¶12.   Kayla then appealed to the Hinds County Circuit Court. See Miss. Code Ann. § 25-\n\n11-120(2). The circuit court affirmed PERS’s decision. But the court did grant Kayla’s\n\nrequest to enjoin PERS from disbursing the $110,163 to Marjorie’s successors until Kayla’s\n\nappeal before this court is finally resolved.\n\n                                         Discussion\n\n       I.       Marjorie’s Intent\n\n¶13.   While PERS and Kayla hotly dispute the significance of the language in both revised\n\nOption 4-B and section 25-11-117.1, neither has disputed that this language controls, despite\n\n\n\n       3\n            Heather and Kayla shared the same father but had different mothers.\n\n                                                5\n\fthe fact that section 25-11-117.1 was not even part of the PERS retirement statutes when\n\nMarjorie selected Option 4-B. Still, our law is clear that these statutes cannot be applied in\n\na way that defeats the clear intention of the deceased retired member.

By selecting Option 4-B—as that option existed in 1999—Marjorie’s intent was\n\nobvious. She chose the particular option that ensured her that if she and Heather both die\n\nbefore all guaranteed payments were made, Majorie’s intestate estate—i.e., Marjorie’s\n\nstatutory heirs—would receive the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments. This\n\nmuch is crystal clear. And it is inconceivable from the PERS statutes in effect at the time of\n\nMajorie’s retirement application and soon-after death that Marjorie intended any remaining\n\nretirement benefits would go to Heather’s heirs, should Heather die before all payments were\n\nmade.\n\n¶15.     So even if we were to agree with the dissent that Kayla’s interpretation of sections 25-\n\n11-115(1) and 25-11-117.1 was correct—which we do not—we would still have to reject this\n\ninterpretation as applied to Marjorie’s retirement benefits. See Porter, 763 So. 2d at 849-50\n\n(¶¶14-16). Had PERS done what Kayla and the dissent suggest and paid Heather’s heirs,\n\ninstead of Marjorie’s, it would have unconstitutionally impaired Marjorie’s contractual right\n\nto have her heirs receive the remainder of her retirement if both she and Heather died before\n\nall guaranteed payments were made. Id. (citing U.S. Const. art. I, § 10; Miss. Const. art. 3,\n\n§ 16).\n\n                                                6\n\f¶16.   Unlike Kayla’s and the dissent’s personal interpretations, PERS’s interpretation of\n\nsection 25-11-117.1 has the advantage of actually effecting Majorie’s intent. And because\n\nKayla’s interpretation directly conflicts with Majorie’s clear intent—that her next of kin, not\n\nHeather’s, would receive any remaining guaranteed payments if both she and Heather died\n\nbefore 2019—we must reject it.\n\n       II.    PERS’s Interpretation\n\n¶17.   Furthermore, PERS’s interpretation has the additional advantage of being supported\n\nby the statute’s language.\n\n              A.     Standard of Review\n\n¶18.   Because this appeal raises a question of statutory interpretation, Kayla asserts we must\n\nreview PERS’s decision de novo. While it is true that “[a]n agency’s interpretation of its\n\ngoverning statutes is reviewed de novo,” our supreme court has said we must conduct this\n\nreview “with deference to the agency’s interpretation.” Miss. State & Sch. Emps’ Life &\n\nHealth Plan v.

Miss.

So “unless an\n\nagency’s interpretation of a governing statute is repugnant to the plain meaning thereof, the\n\ncourts are to defer to the agency’s interpretation.” Id.\n\n¶19.   Stated differently, we only “give no weight to an agency interpretation” when it “is\n\nso plainly erroneous or so inconsistent with either the underlying regulation or statute as to\n\n                                              7\n\fbe arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the unambiguous language or best reading of a\n\nstatute.” KCC, 108 So. 3d at 939 (¶20). This means we cannot take the dissent’s approach\n\nand substitute PERS’s interpretation of section 25-11-117.1 with our personal preference of\n\nhow to read the statute. We must instead uphold PERS’s decision to pay Majorie’s heirs, not\n\nHeather’s, so long as its statutory interpretation was not so inconsistent with the relevant\n\nstatutes as to be arbitrary and capricious. Because we find PERS’s decision was based on\n\na reasonable interpretation of sections 25-11-115(1) and 25-11-117.1(1), consistent with the\n\n“best reading” of these statutes, and certainly not arbitrary and capricious, we must affirm.\n\n               B.     “Monthly Benefits Payable”\n\n¶20.   Revised Option 4-B directs that, when both the retiree and her named beneficiary have\n\ndied, “the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments shall be paid under Section 25-11-\n\n117.1(1).” Miss. Code Ann. § 25-11-115(1) (Rev. 2010). Section 25-11-117.1(1) begins by\n\nnoting there is an exception—“Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) . . . .” Kayla\n\nargues this “prefatory phrase” is there to steer PERS immediately to subsection (2) and first\n\ndetermine if its provisions apply.       If they do, then according to Kayla the rest of\n\nsubsection (1) “is negated” and has no application whatsoever.\n\n¶21.   As one would imagine, Kayla argues subsection (2) applies here. Under this\n\nsubsection, “Any monthly benefits payable to a beneficiary who dies prior to cashing his or\n\nher final check(s) and/or any additional benefits payable pursuant to Section 25-11-112 still\n\npayable at the death of a beneficiary receiving monthly benefits shall be paid . . . [to] brothers\n\nand sisters of the beneficiary” when the beneficiary has no surviving spouse or descendants.\n\n                                                8\n\fMiss. Code Ann. § 25-11-117.1(2). Kayla claims, since Option 4-B guaranteed Heather\n\nmonthly payments for twenty years, the remaining eight years of payments were “monthly\n\nbenefits payable to a beneficiary who dies prior to cashing his or her final check(s)[.]” Miss.\n\nCode Ann. § 25-11-117.1(2).\n\n¶22.   In other words, Kayla is arguing that all twenty years worth of checks were “monthly\n\nbenefits payable” to Heather the moment Marjorie died. She claims they belonged to the\n\nbeneficiary, Heather, not the retiree, Marjorie. Thus, they should have passed to Heather’s\n\nstatutory successors. Kayla suggests that, if Marjorie had wanted one of her relatives to\n\nreceive the money if Heather died, Majorie should have named a contingency beneficiary.\n\n¶23.   Likewise, the dissent points to the lack of a contingent beneficiary as justification for\n\nawarding the remainder of Marjorie’s retirement benefits to someone that is not her heir. See\n\nDis. Op. at (¶63). But the very fact Marjorie could have named a contingent beneficiary\n\nundercuts Kayla’s argument that all twenty years worth of retirement benefits fully vested\n\nin Heather the moment Marjorie died. Had Marjorie named a contingent beneficiary, the\n\nremaining payments would have gone directly to that person, not Heather. And Heather\n\nwould have had zero ability to override Marjorie’s designation and redirect to whom the\n\nremaining payments would go in the event of her own death. Further, Marjorie did not have\n\nto name a contingent beneficiary to control what would happen to her benefits if both she and\n\nHeather died before 2019. That is because Option 4-B has a built-in contingency. In this\n\nscenario, the built-in contingency directed that the remaining benefits would be paid to\n\nMarjorie’s heirs. So by selecting Option 4-B, Marjorie directed exactly what would happen\n\n                                               9\n\fto her benefits in this event.\n\n¶24.   The dissent’s preferred method only works if all the remaining monthly payments\n\nvested in Heather the moment Majorie died. But this was not so. Heather only had a right\n\nto each monthly payment the month its became “payable”—i.e., due and owing. At no point\n\ncould Heather have demanded PERS hand over the remaining payments early. Thus, the\n\nonly “monthly benefits payable” to Heather at the time she died death were the monthly\n\npayments that had already become due. No future monthly payments were “payable” to\n\nHeather once she died. Instead, the remaining monthly payments had to be paid according\n\nto Option 4-B.\n\n               C.     The Exception and the Rule\n\n¶25.   Revised Option 4-B is clear. It specifically says that the actuarial equivalent of the\n\nremaining payments shall be paid under subsection (1) of section 25-11-117.1. Revised\n\nOption 4-B does not reference section 25-11-117.1 generally, nor does it mention\n\nsubsection (2) specifically. Instead, it specifically directs PERS to act under the provision\n\nof subsection (1) of 25-11-117.1. Miss. Code Ann. § 25-11-115(1) (Rev. 2010).\n\n¶26.   Kayla skirts this clear directive by arguing subsection (1) begins with a redirect to\n\nsubsection (2). The dissent echos this view. See Dis. Op. at (¶65). Essentially, they argue\n\nthe exception to subsection (1) is the actual rule. But this argument practically renders the\n\nprovisions of subsection (1) irrelevant—the very provision section 25-11-115(1) expressly\n\nsays shall govern.\n\n¶27.   According to Kayla and the dissent, subsection (1) would only apply when the\n\n                                             10\n\fbeneficiary predeceases the retiree. While we agree that this scenario certainly is possible,\n\nthe obvious anticipated outcome is that the retiree will predecease the beneficiary. After all,\n\nthe whole reason a retiree names a beneficiary is for the perceived and much more probable\n\noutcome that the retiree will die first.      But as Kayla interprets section 25-11-117.1,\n\nsubsection (1)’s provisions were designed for the much less likely outcome—i.e., the\n\n“exception”—while subsection (2)’s provisions are really the rule. The problem with this\n\ninterpretation is that, based on the plain language of section 25-11-117.1, the Legislature\n\ndesignated subsection (2) as an “except[ion]” to subsection (1)’s rule.\n\n¶28.   Equally clear is revised Option 4-B’s language that subsection (1) of section 25-11-\n\n117.1 is to govern who is paid the actuarial equivalent of remaining payments, not\n\nsubsection (2). Miss. Code Ann. § 25-11-115(1) (Rev. 2010). So PERS’s interpretation is\n\nnot only reasonable, it is correct. Subsection (2)’s provisions are only to govern payment of\n\nchecks already issued to the beneficiary but uncashed and other payments still payable to the\n\nbeneficiary when he or she dies—like the cost-of-living adjustment PERS paid Kayla as\n\nHeather’s successor.\n\n¶29.   “The primary rule of [statutory] construction is to ascertain the intent of the legislature\n\nfrom the statute as a whole and from the language used therein.” In re Guardianship of\n\nDuckett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1818875\"><a href=\"/opinion/1818875/in-re-guardianship-of-duckett/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1181-82 (¶37) (Miss. 2008) (emphasis added and citation omitted).\n\nAnd here, based on the structure of section 25-11-117.1, when read as a whole, it is clear the\n\nLegislature intended for subsection (1) to govern payment of the lump-sum actuarial\n\nequivalent of any remaining future payments, while subsection (2) is to govern payments\n\n                                               11\n\falready sent to the beneficiary and any other benefit that “still payable at the death” of the\n\nbeneficiary.\n\n¶30.   Under this straightforward interpretation, the legislative intent in the revised\n\nOption 4-B lines up directly with Majorie’s intent in selecting the old Option 4-B—that her\n\nstatutory heirs would receive the actuarial equivalent of any remaining payments. By\n\ncontrast, Kayla’s argument relies on her claim that it is plainly and unambiguously the\n\nLegislature’s intent that she—who is of no relation whatsoever to a state retiree—should\n\nreceive more than $100,000 in state retirement benefits. We find the language of the statute\n\nsimply does not support this view.\n\n¶31.   Instead, the succinct rule is that the retiree’s family gets the actuarial equivalent of\n\nthe remaining guaranteed payments when both the retiree and her designated beneficiary (or\n\nbeneficiaries) are dead. The limited exception is that any monthly check already written but\n\nnot cashed by the deceased beneficiary (plus any cost-of-living adjustment for payments\n\nalready made) shall be paid to that beneficiary’s surviving family members. PERS followed\n\nthe rule and its limited exception. Therefore, we affirm its decision.\n\n¶32. THE JUDGMENT OF THE HINDS COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT IS\nAFFIRMED.

The question to be decided is: who is entitled to be paid $110,163.58, the amount of\n\nthe remaining guaranteed annuity payments that were owed by PERS at the death of Marjorie\n\nKahn’s designated beneficiary, Heather Vaughn? The majority concludes that Marjorie’s\n\nestate is entitled to the payment. I find that Heather’s heirs are entitled to the payment.\n\nTherefore, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                         FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n¶34.   I disagree slightly with the majority’s version of the facts and procedural history. The\n\nmajority makes it appear as if Kayla Vaughn was the only party in this litigation that argued\n\nMississippi Code Annotated section 25-11-117.1 governed the outcome of this appeal. Such\n\nwas not the case. PERS’s executive director, its staff, Board of Trustees, and the circuit court\n\nall determined that section 25-11-117.1 governed this decision. Indeed, no party or court has\n\nargued or considered that the now-repealed version of Mississippi Code Annotated section\n\n25-11-115(1) (Supp. 1999) may govern the outcome of this litigation until now.\n\n¶35.   The facts are not in dispute.\n\n¶36.   Marjorie retired on PERS disability retirement, effective November 1, 1999. She\n\nelected to receive benefits pursuant to Option 4-B under Mississippi Code Annotated section\n\n25-11-115(1) (Supp. 1999). At that time, Option 4-B read:\n\n       A reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of the\n       retirant, but with the further guarantee of payments to the named beneficiary,\n       beneficiaries, or to the estate, for a specified number of years certain. If the\n       retired member or the last designated beneficiary receiving annuity payments\n       dies prior to receiving all guaranteed payments due, the actuarial equivalent of\n       the remaining payments would be paid to the estate of the retired as intestate\n       property.\n\n                                              13\n\fUnder the first sentence of this option, Marjorie selected a twenty-year period. As a result\n\nof her decision, Marjorie’s benefits under Option 4B were to end on October 1, 2019.\n\n¶37.   Marjorie designated Heather, her daughter, as her beneficiary. Marjorie could have\n\nalso named a contingent beneficiary in the event of Heather’s death, but chose not to name\n\na contingent beneficiary.\n\n¶38.   Marjorie died January 1, 2000. At that time, PERS had not paid any of the benefit\n\npayments. As a result, PERS began to make payments to Heather as Marjorie’s designated\n\nOption 4-B beneficiary.\n\n¶39.   Heather died in August 2011. PERS continued to pay monthly benefits to Heather\n\nuntil her death.\n\n¶40.   Upon receipt of notice and verification of Heather’s death, PERS checked Marjorie’s\n\nfile at PERS to see if she had named a contingent beneficiary in the event her primary\n\nbeneficiary died before the expiration of the twenty-year period. If Marjorie had named a\n\ncontingent beneficiary, PERS would have paid the remaining monthly benefits to that person.\n\nPERS’s review determined that Marjorie had not named a contingent beneficiary. Because\n\nof Marjorie’s death, Heather’s death, and the lack of a contingent beneficiary, PERS had to\n\nidentify to whom the remaining benefits should be paid.\n\n¶41.   PERS determined that Marjorie’s file did not include the name of any next-of-kin.\n\nPERS sent a notice to Marjorie’s family that informed them of Heather’s death and stated\n\nthat the remaining balance would be paid to Marjorie’s statutory successors under\n\nMississippi Code Annotated section 25-11-117.1(1).\n\n                                            14\n\f¶42.   Toni Vaughn, Heather’s stepmother, contacted PERS on behalf of her daughter,\n\nKayla. Kayla was Heather’s half-sister. Kayla and Heather had the same father, but Kayla\n\nwas not related by blood to Marjorie. Kayla claimed that the remaining annuity benefits\n\nshould be paid to her as Heather’s next-of-kin and not to Marjorie’s heirs. Through counsel,\n\nKayla requested a hearing pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated section 25-11-120, if\n\nPERS maintained its position that payment should be paid to Marjorie’s heirs pursuant to\n\nsection 25-11-117.1(1).\n\n¶43.   By letter dated November 8, 2011, Pat Robertson, PERS’s executive director, sent an\n\nadministrative decision letter to Kayla’s attorney that stated PERS’s decision:\n\n       Section 25-11-117.1(1) applies to benefits that are the property of the deceased\n       member and that become payable to the successors of the deceased member\n       in the absence of a named beneficiary. Section . . . 25-11-117.1(2) applies\n       specifically to monthly benefits due and payable to a beneficiary who dies\n       before he or she has the opportunity to negotiate or cash a check or checks\n       issued before his or her death. Because monthly benefits are no longer payable\n       to a beneficiary receiving monthly benefits upon his or her death, no further\n       benefits were payable to Ms. Heather Ann Vaughn upon her death; thus, no\n       benefits are payable to Ms. Heather Ann Vaughn’s successor(s) from PERS.\n\n¶44.   Kayla appealed the decision to the PERS Board of Trustees. A hearing was held\n\nbefore the Claims Committee of the Board of Trustees on January 24, 2012.\n\n¶45.   Bob Rhoads, PERS senior policy advisor, testified that section 25-11-117.1 was\n\nactually enacted to be effective July 1, 2000, after Marjorie’s death. Prior to that time,\n\npursuant to section 25-11-115(1), “Option 4B provided that the present value of the\n\nremaining payments would be payable to the estate of the deceased member or retiree . . . .”\n\nRhoads also testified that he was employed by PERS in 2000 when the PERS Board of\n\n                                             15\n\fTrustees requested the new legislation as part of its proposed legislative package for that\n\nyear. The request was made because the previous language gave PERS no alternative but to\n\npay the present value of remaining benefits to the member/retiree’s estate, which often\n\nrequired the opening or reopening of an estate many years after the death of the\n\nmember/retiree. Rhoads stated, “it was the intent of the staff and the Board to not change the\n\nfact that the present value of the remaining payments [was] due to the successors of the\n\ndeceased member or retiree. We just wanted to find a more convenient way for the\n\nsuccessors to make a claim directly with PERS rather than through an Estate.”\n\n¶46.    Following the hearing, the Claims Committee found “that the actuarial equivalent of\n\nthe remaining payments are to be paid to the statutory successors of the deceased\n\nmember/retiree, Marjorie Ann Kahn, as listed in Section 25-11-117.1(1)[,] because the\n\ndesignated beneficiary, Heather Ann Vaughn, was deceased when such benefits would have\n\nbecome payable, and Ms. Kahn did not designate a contingent beneficiary.”\n\n¶47.    Pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated section 25-11-120(2) (Rev. 2010), Kayla\n\nappealed the PERS decision to the Hinds County Circuit Court. The circuit court granted\n\nKayla’s request for a preliminary injunction and enjoined PERS from distributing funds from\n\nMarjorie’s account during the pendency of the appeal. Then, on June 21, 2013, based on the\n\nbriefs submitted, the circuit court entered its opinion and order that affirmed the decision of\n\nPERS.\n\n                                         ANALYSIS\n\n        I.    Marjorie’s Intent\n\n                                              16\n\f¶48.   In its first section, the majority determines that “[b]ased on Option 4-B — as that\n\noption existed in 1999 — Marjorie’s clear intent was that, should she and Heather both die\n\nbefore all guaranteed payments were made, Majorie’s intestate estate — i.e., Marjorie’s\n\nstatutory heirs — would receive the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments.” To\n\ndecide Marjorie’s “clear intent,” the majority sua sponte decided that the pre-amendment\n\nversion of section 25-11-115(1) would govern the outcome of this case even though no party\n\nhas argued it as governing law.\n\n¶49.   PERS does not make this argument. Instead, PERS’s supplemental brief, which asked\n\nwhether the repealed statute applied, stated: “PERS would argue that the 2000 amendment\n\nto Miss. Code Ann. § 25-11-115 and the enactment of § 25-11-117.1, as it has been\n\ninterpreted by PERS, do[] not deprive [Marjorie] of a significant contractual right.” PERS\n\nargues that the post-amendment, current version of section 25-11-117.1 governs.\n\n¶50.   Nevertheless, the majority cites In re Estate of Dillon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1298</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1303-04\n\n(Miss. 1994), and Public Employees’ Retirement System v.

I am of the opinion\n\nthat these cases are taken out of context or are factually distinguishable. Neither is directly\n\non point.\n\n¶51.   Indeed, PERS’s argument that the amendment to section 25-11-115(1) “does not\n\ndeprive [Marjorie] of a significant contractual right” should indicate that this Court should\n\n                                              17\n\fnot interject its research and legal reasoning to decide this case. The majority says it knows\n\nMarjorie’s “clear intent,” but I do not. To me, it is important that throughout this entire\n\ndispute, PERS’s staff, PERS’s executive director, PERS’s Board of Trustees, and the circuit\n\ncourt judge have all relied on and based their decision on their interpretation of Mississippi\n\nCode Annotated section 25-11-117.1(1). This was the result of their reliance on the amended\n\nversion of section 25-11-115(1), which referred to section 25-11-117.1(1) for resolution of\n\nthis payment dispute.\n\n¶52.   Furthermore, the pre-amendment language of Option 4-B does not decide our\n\ninterpretation because the Legislature amended the statute without a savings clause. The\n\neffect of the Legislature’s act was to abrogate the pre-amendment statutory language as if it\n\nnever existed. The Mississippi Supreme Court summarized this general rule as follows:\n\n       Many decisions in this state have affirmed the rule, which generally prevails,\n       that the effect of a repealing statute is to abrogate the repealed statute as\n       completely as if it had never been passed, and that a statute modifying a\n       previous statute has the same effect as though the statute had all the while\n       previously existed in the same language as that contained in the modified\n       statute, unless the repealing or modifying statute contains a saving clause . . .\n       .\n\n       The result of this rule is that every right or remedy created solely by the\n       repealed or modified statute disappears or falls with the repealed or modified\n       statute, unless carried to final judgment before the repeal or modification, save\n       that no such repeal or modification shall be permitted to impair the obligation\n       of a contract or to abrogate a vested right.\n\nStone v.

I recognize that, on October 11, 1999, Marjorie executed her application for disability\n\nbenefits, and she selected Option 4-B with twenty years certain. She died less than three\n\nmonths later. The law in effect at that time, Mississippi Code Annotated section\n\n25-11-115(1), Option 4-B (repealed 2000), provided that “[i]f the retired member or the last\n\ndesignated beneficiary receiving annuity payments dies prior to receiving all guaranteed\n\npayments due, the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments would be paid to the estate\n\nof the retired as intestate property.”\n\n¶54.   In fact, as of Marjorie’s death, the Legislature determined that the deceased member’s\n\nestate would be the catch-all recipient for Option 4-B benefits remaining after the death of\n\nthe member and her last designated beneficiary. However, this catch-all provision did not\n\napply at Marjorie’s death because her beneficiary was still alive. Based on Marjorie’s\n\nelection, PERS was obligated to pay Heather $922.63 each month until her last check on\n\nOctober 1, 2019.\n\n¶55.   Just before Heather began to receive the Option 4-B benefits, the Legislature amended\n\nthe statutory scheme under which these benefits were paid. The statutory change became\n\neffective on July 1, 2000. Mississippi Code Annotated section 25-11-115(1) was amended,\n\nand Mississippi Code Annotated section 25-11-117.1 was created. The amended language\n\nof section 25-11-115(1) was changed to read:\n\n       A reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of the\n\n                                             19\n\f       retirant, but with the further guarantee of payments to the named beneficiary\n       or beneficiaries for a specified number of years certain. If the retired member\n       or the last designated beneficiary both die before receiving all guaranteed\n       payments due, the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments shall be\n       paid under Section 25-11-117.1(1).\n\n(Emphasis added). The Legislature changed the catch-all provision. Effective July 1, 2000,\n\nif both the member and last designated beneficiary died before the expiration of the sum-\n\ncertain period, PERS was directed to pay the remaining benefits pursuant to Mississippi Code\n\nAnnotated section 25-11-117.1(1). There was no savings clause in the legislation. The\n\nlegislation did not distinguish between members who joined PERS before or after the\n\neffective date of July 1, 2000. PERS, the sponsor of this legislation, admits this fact.4 And\n\nthe majority does not address it. What is clear is that the Legislature directed that section\n\n25-11-117.1 be applied to any instance occurring after July 1, 2000, where benefits remain\n\nafter the death of both the member and the member’s last designated beneficiary.\n\n¶56.   Throughout this matter, until now, the parties agreed that the current Mississippi Code\n\nAnnotated sections 25-11-115(1) and 117.1 were the applicable statutes and governed the\n\noutcome of this dispute. They, however, disagreed as to the proper interpretation of those\n\nstatutes. I disagree with and dissent from the majority’s decision to apply the now-repealed\n\n\n\n       4\n           During the administrative hearing, it was noted that Marjorie's application for\nbenefits was completed before the statutory change to Option 4-B, which occurred on July\n1, 2000. PERS senior policy advisor Bob Rhoads testified as to the effect that the\npre-2000-amendment language had on the manner in which PERS paid the $110,163 in\nremaining benefits. Mr. Rhoads stated that “[t]he law was changed in 2000. How we paid\nthe present value is applied prospectively to all. We didn't segregate if you retired before\nthis date this rule applied; if you retire from and after this date, another rule applies.”\n\n                                             20\n\fversion of section 25-11-115(1).\n\n       II.    PERS’s Interpretation\n\n¶57.   The majority also includes an alternate finding as to the resolution under section 25-\n\n11-117.1(1). I disagree with and dissent from this interpretation.\n\n¶58.   On October 11, 1999, Marjorie made a decision as to her PERS benefits when she\n\nsigned her application for disability benefits and chose Option 4-B. At Marjorie’s death,\n\nPERS began to pay Heather the guaranteed monthly benefits.\n\n¶59.   At the time of Heather’s death, section 25-11-115(1), Option 4-B provided:\n\n       A reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of the\n       retirant, but with the further guarantee of payments to the named beneficiary\n       or beneficiaries for a specified number of years certain. If the retired member\n       or the last designated beneficiary both die before receiving all guaranteed\n       payments due, the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments shall be\n       paid under Section 25-11-117.1(1).\n\n(Emphasis added). Section 25-11-117.1, titled “Recipients of additional benefits payable and\n\nchecks not yet cashed when beneficiary dies or is disqualified,” reads:\n\n       (1)    Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, where\n              benefits are payable to a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries under\n              this article and the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries as provided\n              by the member on the most recent form filed with the system is\n              deceased or otherwise disqualified at the time such benefits become\n              payable, the following persons, in descending order of precedence,\n              shall be eligible to receive such benefits:\n\n              (a)    The surviving spouse of the member or retiree;\n              (b)    The children of the member or retiree or their\n                     descendants, per stirpes;\n              (c)    The brothers and sisters of the member or retiree or their\n                     descendants, per stirpes;\n              (d)    The parents of the member or retiree;\n\n                                             21\n\f              (e)     The executor or administrator on behalf of the member or\n                      retiree's estate;\n              (f)     The persons entitled by law to distribution of the member\n                      or retiree's estate.\n\n       (2)    Any monthly benefits payable to a beneficiary who dies prior to cashing\n              his or her final check(s) and/or any additional benefits payable\n              pursuant to Section 25-11-112 still payable at the death of a beneficiary\n              receiving monthly benefits shall be paid as follows:\n\n              (a)     The surviving spouse of the beneficiary;\n              (b)     The children of the beneficiary or their descendants, per\n                      stirpes;\n              (c)     The brothers and sisters of the beneficiary or their\n                      descendants, per stirpes;\n              (d)     The parents of the beneficiary;\n              (e)     The executor or administrator on behalf of the\n                      beneficiary's estate;\n              (f)     The persons entitled by law to distribution of the\n                      beneficiary's estate.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n¶60.   Marjorie chose Option 4-B, under section 25-11-115(1). This governs how her\n\nbenefits are to be paid.\n\n¶61.   The benefits are first paid to the retirant. Marjorie was entitled to “a reduced\n\nretirement allowance” during her life “but with the further guarantee of payments to the\n\nnamed beneficiary or beneficiaries for a specified number of years certain.” Id. (emphasis\n\nadded). Marjorie was entitled to be paid a monthly benefit during her life, and Marjorie was\n\nable to name a person who would be entitled to a “guarantee of payments” for twenty years.\n\nId.\n\n¶62.   Next, at the death of the retirant, the benefits are to be paid to the retirant’s designated\n\n\n                                               22\n\fbeneficiary. Id. Marjorie designated Heather to receive the “guarantee of payments.”\n\nHeather was paid benefits for approximately eleven years.\n\n¶63.   At Heather’s death, under Option 4-B, Marjorie could have designated a contingent\n\nbeneficiary to receive the remaining benefits. She could have named any person, entity, or\n\nher estate. She chose not to name a contingent beneficiary.\n\n¶64.   Because the guaranteed payments were not paid in full, section 25-11-115(1) provided\n\nhow the remaining benefits would be paid. Option 4-B also provided that if the “retired\n\nmember [Marjorie] or the last designated beneficiary [Heather] both die before receiving all\n\nguaranteed payments due, the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments shall be paid\n\nunder Section 25-11-117.1(1).” Miss. Code Ann. § 25-11-115(1).\n\n¶65.   Therefore, I move to section 25-11-117.1, which is titled, “Persons to whom benefits\n\npayable in event of death of designated beneficiary.” Subsection (1) reads:\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, where benefits\n       are payable to a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries under this article and\n       the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries as provided by the member on the\n       most recent form filed with the system is deceased or otherwise disqualified\n       at the time such benefits become payable, the following persons, in descending\n       order of precedence, shall be eligible to receive such benefits: . . . .\n\nThe subsection begins with the phrase “[e]xcept as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of\n\nthis section.” We must consider the effect of this language; we cannot ignore it.\n\n¶66.   If we consider subsection (1) without the reference to subsection (2), it says: “[W]here\n\nbenefits are payable to a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries under this article and the\n\ndesignated beneficiary or beneficiaries . . . is deceased or otherwise disqualified at the time\n\n\n                                              23\n\fsuch benefits become payable . . . .” (Emphasis added). I read this language to say that\n\nsubsection (1) only applies where the designated beneficiary “is deceased or otherwise\n\ndisqualified at the time such benefits become payable.” This language specifically looks at\n\nthe point in time that the retirant dies and the guaranteed payment vests in the designated\n\nbeneficiary(ies). I am of the opinion that subsection (1) only applies when the designated\n\nbeneficiaries are dead or disqualified at the time the retirant dies, and then the amount of the\n\nguaranteed payments would be paid to the retirant’s heirs based on subsection (1).\n\n¶67.   Subsection (2) is clear that it applies to any guaranteed benefits vested in the\n\nbeneficiaries. Subsection (2) reads: “[A]ny monthly benefits payable to a beneficiary who\n\ndies prior to cashing his or her final check(s) . . . shall be paid as follows . . . .” Here, there\n\nis no dispute that Heather died before “cashing . . . her final checks.” As a result, I am of\n\nthe opinion that the statutory scheme that controls the payment of the guaranteed payments\n\nis section 25-11-117.1(2), and the remaining balance should be paid to Kayla.\n\n¶68.   Because I would reverse and render the judgment of the circuit court, I respectfully\n\ndissent.\n\n       ISHEE, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n\n\n\n\n                                                24\n\f</pre>",
