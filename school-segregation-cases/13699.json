Rimsl\n\n\n       KORSMO, C.J. -     \"Two wrongs do not make a right.\"l This case proves the truth\n\nof that adage better than most. Respondent filed a meritless lien. Appellant retaliated\n\nwith 27 causes of action ranging from breach of contract to civil conspiracy. The trial\n\ncourt imposed CR 11 sanctions in excess of$165,000 against appellant's counsel for\n\nfiling a lengthy list of causes of action that lacked merit and were not withdrawn until\n\ntwo years of litigation had ensued. The court also dismissed the remaining counts on\n\nsummary judgment and awarded additional attorney fees under the parties' contract.\n\nAlthough there was no litigation privilege applicable here, the trial court did properly\n\ngrant summary judgment. We affirm the dismissal of the action and remand the CR 11\n\nruling for further findings that more clearly identify the amount of work performed on the\n\nsanctionable counts.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n       The hopes of a residential real estate developer and her listing agent were dashed,\n\nperhaps by a failing economy. Each side blamed the other, and litigation ensued; the\n\nsordid details do not show either party in a good light. Unfortunately, attorneys aided\n\nand abetted the battle.\n\n\n\n\n      1 This maxim originates in the Latin phrase \"Injuria non excusat injuriam\" (\"injury\ndoes not excuse an injury\"). See HERBERT BROOM, A SELECTION OF LEGAL MAXIMS,\nCLASSIFIED AND ILLUSTRATED, 394 (7th Amer. Ed. 1874).\n\n                                             2\n\n\fNo. 30140-1-111; 30483-3-111\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\n       Montecito Estates LLC and its owner, Priscilla Trujillo (collectively, Montecito),\n\nattempted to develop a 35 lot residential subdivision in Prosser. They hired Douglas\n\nHimsl to market the estates via a listing agreement that ran from December 2, 2005 to\n\nDecember 31, 2006. The listing agreement gave Himsl exclusive marketing rights for\n\none year. He was to receive commissions ranging from 3.5 percent to 5 percent of the\n\nsale price of any lots sold during that year, as well as for any lots sold due to his efforts\n\nwithin 180 days of the end of the listing agreement.\n\n       Montecito cancelled the listing agreement on May 8, 2006 for unsatisfactory\n\nperformance; not one lot had been sold in the six months since the agreement had been\n\nsigned. Acting through counsel, Mr. Himsl responded the following month by filing a\n\nlien in an amount representing 5 percent of the purchase price of the applicable \"home\n\npackage\" for each lot in the development. The lien cited the commercial real estate\n\nbroker lien act, chapter 60.42 RCW, and was directed to Montecito's proceeds and rents\n\nrather than the land itself.\n\n       Financiers declined to further finance Montecito and other real estate agents\n\ndeclined to attempt to sell the properties in light of the lien. In July 2007, despite the fact\n\nthat no properties had been sold and the time period in which Mr. Himsl had the right to\n\nclaim a commission had expired, his attorneys sent a settlement demand to Montecito\n\nrequesting $300,000 in exchange for releasing the lien. In subsequent pleadings,\n\nMontecito characterized this as a \"ransom demand.\" Montecito lost the properties when\n\n                                              3\n\n\fNo. 30140-1-III; 30483-3-III\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\nit signed a deed in lieu of foreclosure on November 5, 2007 that granted all of the lots to\n\na creditor, Special Services, Inc.\n\n         Montecito filed suit against Himsl on September 25,2008. The action asserted 12\n\ncauses of action against Himsl personally. The complaint was amended July 31, 2009 to\n\nassert 25 causes of action; Himsl's attorneys were added as defendants. A second\n\namended complaint was filed October 21, 2009; this document asserted 27 causes of\n\naction including contract and tort based claims. In addition to Himsl and his attorneys,\n\nthe complaint added Chicago Title Insurance Co. (Montecito's former escrow agent) and\n\nthe Cumutts, a couple who had cancelled a purchase agreement for a lot in the\n\nsubdivision, as defendnats.\n\n         Himsl filed a counterclaim raising two breach of contract claims and asserting a\n\nCR 11 sanction claim for harassment. In response to a court order, Montecito on\n\nDecember 14, 2009 filed its first of several \"more definite statements\" attempting to\n\ndefine its theory of the case. Himsl was identified as a defendant on 26 of the 27 causes\n\nof action. A first amended more definite statement soon followed that clarified the\n\ncauses of action asserted against the other defendants. A voluntary second amended\n\nmore definite statement filed on June 14, 2010, dismissed 14 of the 26 claims against Mr.\n\nHimsl.\n\n         The trial court entered a ruling on December 10, 2010 that declared the lien filed\n\nby Himsl and his counsel was invalid. The court determined that chapter 60.42 RCW\n\n                                              4\n\n\fNo. 30140-1-111; 30483-3-111\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\nwas inapplicable because the residential subdivision did not involve commercial real\n\nestate.\n\n          Montecito dismissed several more claims after Ms. Trujillo's deposition\n\nestablished that she had no factual bases for them. Meanwhile, the more definite\n\nstatements continued. The third and fourth amended statements removed Chicago Title\n\nand most of the other claims in the case. Additional claims were dropped when\n\nMontecito answered Rimsl's motion for summary judgment, resulting in five remaining\n\ncauses of action: breach of contract, civil conspiracy, extortion/economic duress/business\n\ncompulsion, principal liability for actions of his attorneys, and breach of statutory duties\n\nunder chapter 18.86 RCW.\n\n          The trial court issued a memorandum decision on February 28, 2011 that granted\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Rimsl on the remaining five claims. 2 The trial court\n\nissued its ruling on alternative bases: (1) the remaining claims were all related to the lien\n\naction and protected by the litigation privilege; and (2) Montecito failed to present a\n\nprima facie case on each claim. An order of dismissal was entered on April 1, 2011.\n\n          Montecito moved for reconsideration. Meanwhile, the trial court considered\n\nRimsl's request for attorney fees. The trial court accepted Rimsl' s argument that 60\n\n\n      2 The court dismissed the claims against Rimsl' s attorneys on April 1, 2011\npursuant to CR 12(b)(6). The court denied the attorneys' motion for CR 11 sanctions.\nThe Curnutts also were released from the litigation by summary judgment on April 1,\n2011.\n\n                                              5\n\n\fNo. 30140-1-III; 30483-3-III\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\npercent of the fees incurred related to the contract based claims and ordered Montecito to\n\npay Himsl $131,011.58 under the listing agreement, a figure that represented 60 percent\n\nof the defense fees and costs incurred.\n\n       The court then turned to the CR 11 attorney fees request. Noting that 22 of the 27\n\ncauses were voluntarily dismissed two years into the litigation with no evidence of a\n\nfactual basis for any of the claims, and three of the other claims were pursued despite Ms.\n\nTrujillo having no factual support for them, the trial court found that the majority of them\n\nwere \"filed vindictively and in bad faith, and were advanced for purposes of harassment,\n\nnuisance, and spite.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 853. Finding repeated violations ofCR 11,\n\nthe court awarded Himsl 75 percent of his requested attorney fees, a total of $164,264.48,\n\nto be paid by Montecito, Ms. Trujillo, and attorney John Bolliger. They timely appealed\n\nthe attorney fee awards to this court.\n\n       The trial court eventually denied the motion for reconsideration. With the entry of\n\nthat order, Montecito appealed the summary judgment ruling and the denial of\n\nreconsideration. The two appeals were consolidated for argument and resolution.\n\n                                          ANALYSIS\n\n       The appeals challenge on several grounds both the dismissal of the case and the\n\nattorney fee awards. We will address the arguments in that order.\n\n       Dismissal\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\n\fNo. 30140-1-III; 30483-3-III\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\n       Montecito argues both that the doctrine of litigation immunity did not apply to its\n\nremaining causes of action and that material questions of fact existed that precluded the\n\nsummary judgment ruling. We agree in part that the broad assertion of litigation\n\nimmunity was not justified on all causes of action, but we agree with the trial court that\n\nsummary judgment was proper. Before addressing Montecito's arguments, we first note\n\nthe standards governing this aspect of this appeal.\n\n       This court reviews a summary judgment de novo, performing the same inquiry as\n\nthe trial court. Lybbert v. Grant County, 141 Wn.2d 29, 34, 1 P.3d 1124 (2000). The\n\nfacts, and all reasonable inferences to be drawn from them, are viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to the nonmoving party. Id. If there is no genuine issue of material fact,\n\nsummary judgment will be granted if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter\n\nof law. Id.\n\n       The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing that it is entitled to\n\njudgment because there are no disputed issues of material fact. Young v. Key Pharm.,\n\nInc., 112 Wn.2d 216, 225,770 P.2d 182 (1989). Ifa defendant makes that initial\n\nshowing, then the burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish there is a genuine issue for the\n\ntrier of fact. Id. at 225-26. The plaintiff may not rely on speculation or having its own\n\naffidavits accepted at face value. Seven Gables Corp. v. MGMlUA Entm 't Co., 106\n\nWn.2d 1, 13, 721 P .2d 1 (1986). Instead, it must put forth evidence showing the\n\nexistence of a triable issue. Id.\n\n                                              7\n\n\fNo. 30140-1-111; 30483-3-111\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\n       Litigation Immunity. Himsl argues that because all of the remaining actions\n\nrevolved around the lien filed by his lawyers, he has immunity. We disagree. No court\n\nhas construed litigation immunity so broadly. Tortious conduct is not immune from\n\nliability merely because a party hired a lawyer to engage in the behavior.\n\n       Washington recognizes that statements made by counsel in the course of litigation\n\nare immune from defamation actions. E.g., McNeal v. Allen, 95 Wn.2d 265,621 P.2d\n\n1285 (1980); Gold Seal Chinchillas, Inc. v. State, 69 Wn.2d 828, 420 P.2d 698 (1966).\n\nSimilarly, a witness is immune from suit concerning his testimony at trial. Bruce v.\n\nByrne-Stevens & Assocs., 113 Wn.2d 123, 776 P.2d 666 (1989). This common law\n\nimmunity is founded in the need of counsel to have \"the utmost freedom in their efforts to\n\nsecure justice for their clients.\" McNeal, 95 Wn.2d at 267.\n\n       This court has ruled that an attorney is immune from litigation by an opposing\n\nparty for actions taken on behalf of a client against that party. Jeckle v. Crotty, 120 Wn.\n\nApp. 374,386,85 P.2d 931 (2004). In Jeckle, this court relied upon the judicial action\n\nimmunity recognized in the factually similar case of Kittler v. Eckberg, Lammers, Briggs,\n\nWolff& Vierling, 535 N.W.2d 653,657-58 (Minn. Ct. App. 1995). Jeckle, 120 Wn. App.\n\nat 386. In Kittler, attorneys were sued for defamation over a letter written to solicit\n\nadditional clients to sue the plaintiff. 535 N.W.2d at 654-55. Applying the Restatement\n\n(Second) o/Torts § 586 (1977), the Minnesota court extended the absolute immunity for\n\ndefamation granted attorneys to prelitigation good faith solicitation of clients for an\n\n                                              8\n\n\fNo. 30140-1-III; 30483-3-III\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\nanticipated lawsuit. Kittler, 535 N.W.2d at 655-57. In Jeckle this court agreed with\n\nKittler that the attorney immunity applied outside of the courtroom and extended it to the\n\nattorney's actions in soliciting clients and deposing the opposing party using information\n\nfound in his Medical Quality Assurance Commission file. Jeckle, 120 Wn. App. at 378,\n\n386. The central core of the allegations addressed counsel's communication of\n\ninformation during litigation, the very reason that the defamation privilege exists. The\n\nattorney immunity for defamation based claims properly covered the conduct at issue in\n\nJeckle, which essentially sounded in defamation.\n\n       Jeckle did not recognize a broad litigation immunity privilege. Even if it had,\n\nhowever, it would not apply here for two reasons. First, the action of filing the lien\n\noccurred before the litigation and was not an early step in initiating an action. An action\n\nthat causes litigation, whether it be an automobile accident, wrongful death, or a lien\n\nfiling, simply is not an action taken to initiate or further litigation.\n\n       Second, Himsl's argument that he is entitled to the immunity enjoyed by his\n\nattorney is without foundation. He cites no authority suggesting that the attorney's\n\nimmunity is shared with the client. Although we can foresee circumstances in which it\n\nwould be necessary to extend the attorney's immunity to the client lest a party do\n\nindirectly what they cannot do directly, we leave consideration of such cases to the\n\nfuture. Here we face a broad assertion of a client's immunity in tort based on immunity\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\n\fNo. 30140-1-111; 30483-3-111\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\nfor defamation held by the client's attorney.3 This is essentially the converse of the\n\ninfamous Nuremberg defense. 4 We do not believe that a client can claim immunity for\n\nhis agent's actions except in carefully delineated circumstances that are not present here.\n\n       A tortious action is not necessarily immune merely because it is taken by an\n\nattorney on behalf of a client. 5 Numerous causes of action, often raised as counterclaims,\n\nare routinely pleaded in response to actions taken by the opposing party's attorney. Some\n\nexamples include malicious prosecution,6 slander oftitle,7 and anti-SLAPp 8 actions.\n\nIndeed, CR II would have a very narrow application if not applied to actions taken by\n\nattorneys on behalf of their clients.\n\n       We conclude that there is no broad-based litigation immunity doctrine. Claims of\n\nimmunity must be considered narrowly and in relation to the purpose of the immunity to\n\nallow counsel freedom to fully present a case.\n\n\n\n        3 Himsl' s attorneys were released from the case on the basis of immunity.\nMontecito never appealed that ruling and we do not express any opinion about it.\n        4 See United States v. Cortes-Caban, 691 F.3d 1, 12 n.13 (1st Cir. 2012) ('\"[W]e\nreject the validity of a so-called Nuremberg defense ... 'the fact that any person acted\npursuant to the order of his Government or of a superior does not free him from\nresponsibility for a crime.\"') (quoting Judgment of the Tribunal, Trial a/Wilhelm von\nLeeb and Thirteen Others, 12 Law Reports of Trials of War Criminals 1, 71-72 (United\nStates War Crimes Commission 1949)). The same rule certainly applies to the person\nwho gave the order or in whose name it was taken.\n        5 For instance, if Mr. Himsl had hired two large attorneys to assault Ms. Trujillo,\nwe do not believe he could (or WOUld) claim immunity to a tort of assault.\n        6 RCW 4.24.350; Rains v. State, 100 Wn.2d 660,668,674 P.2d 165 (1983).\n        7 Rorvig v. Douglas, 123 Wn.2d 854, 873 P.2d 492 (1994).\n        8 Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation. RCW 4.24.510.\n\n\n                                             10 \n\n\fNo. 30140-1-111; 30483-3-111\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\n       Relief must be available for tort victims, but seldom will it be appropriate to sue\n\nan attorney for litigation activity. See Rains v. State, 100 Wn.2d 660,668,674 P.2d 165\n\n(1983) (disapproving counterclaim that added plaintiffs attorney as third party defendant\n\nfor malicious prosecution). Liens are not to be filed lightly or for nonessential purposes;\n\nindeed, people have been sent to prison for maliciously filing liens. E.g., State v.\n\nKnowles, 91 Wn. App. 367,957 P.2d 797 (1998); State v. Stephenson, 89 Wn. App. 794,\n\n950 P.2d 38 (1998). However, the remedy for wrongful filing ofa lien normally is a\n\ndeclaratory action to remove the lien rather than to pursue multiple torts against the lien\n\nfiler and his counsel.\n\n       The trial court erred to the extent it relied upon litigation immunity to dismiss all\n\nof the remaining counts. 9\n\n       Prima Facie Case. Montecito argues that the trial court also erred in ruling that it\n\nhad failed to establish a prima facie case on the five remaining causes of action. 10 On\n\nappeal, Montecito challenges only the dismissal of the claims involving breach of\n\n\n\n\n        9 In light of our disposition of the case, we do not decide whether any of these\nclaims were subject to immunity.\n        10 The trial court also ruled that the causes of action were barred by the operation\nofRCW 60.42.020, which limits relief under the commercial real estate lien act to release\nof the lien. We question how that section could be applied to these liens once the trial\ncourt ruled that the property was not commercial real estate, but also do not address this\ntheory.\n\n                                             11 \n\n\fNo. 30140-1-III; 30483-3-III\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\ncontract and breach of statutory duties under chapter 18.86 RCW. II We will briefly\n\naddress both causes.\n\n        Montecito first argues that the court erroneously dismissed the breach of contract\n\nclaim, arguing that Rimsl' s inaction before the contract was terminated and his actions\n\nafterwards amounted to a breach of the contract. This claim founders on the language of\n\nthe contract and the absence of any expert testimony establishing the duties Montecito\n\nclaims were breached.\n\n       \"A breach of contract is actionable only if the contract imposes a duty, the duty is\n\nbreached, and the breach proximately causes damage to the claimant.\" Nw. Indep. Forest\n\nMfrs. v. Dep't ofLabor and Indus., 78 Wn. App. 707, 712,899 P.2d 6 (1995). Montecito\n\nargues that Rimsl, prior to the contract's termination, failed to timely advertise the\n\nproperty in accordance with Ms. Trujillo's directions, was rude to her, and failed to\n\nadequately staff the model home. Montecito does not cite to any language in the listing\n\nagreement that required Rimsl to behave in any specific manner, let alone impose the\n\nnoted duties that he allegedly failed to live up to.\n\n       Thus, this claim is only actionable if the contract implicitly required this behavior.\n\nThe parties agree that every listing agreement carries with it the obligation to make a\n\n\n       IIMontecito cited page limitations in briefing for its decision not to pursue the\nclaims against Rimsl that involved actions of his counseL We note that the failure to\nappeal the order dismissing Rimsl's attorneys from the case probably doomed any\narguments related to Rimsl's alleged connivance with counselor for the actions of the\n\n                                              12 \n\n\fNo. 30140-1-111; 30483-3-111\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\ncontinuing and good faith effort to find a buyer. Dixon V. Gustav, 51 Wn.2d 378, 381,\n\n318 P.2d 965 (1957). When the listing agent fails to make efforts to sell the property, the\n\nagreement properly can be terminated by the seller. Id. at 381-82.\n\n       Montecito has cited no case authority suggesting that the noted behavioral\n\nstandards are components of the good faith effort required by the contract. It likewise did\n\nnot present any expert testimony suggesting that being pleasant to the seller is part of the\n\ngood faith duty or that industry standards set forth requirements for staffing or timeliness\n\nof advertising. Absent some evidence that Himsl had a duty to act in a specific manner,\n\nMontecito has not shown that Himsl breached his contractual obligations prior to the\n\npoint the contract was terminated.\n\n       Montecito contends that Himsl also breached the contract after it was terminated\n\nby filing the lien. We do not understand how Montecito believes Himsl had any\n\ncontinuing obligations under the contract once Montecito cancelled it. Nonetheless, even\n\nif there were such obligations, Montecito has failed to establish them under either the\n\nterms of the agreement or under the duty of good faith.\n\n       For all of the noted reasons, Montecito failed to establish a prima facie case of\n\nbreach of contract. The claim was properly dismissed.\n\n       Although Montecito argues to the contrary, the remaining claim of realtor\n\nmisconduct sounds in tort. \"The essential elements of actionable negligence are: (1) the\n\n\nattorneys.\n                                             13\n\fNo. 30140-1-III; 30483-3-III\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\nexistence of a duty owed to the complaining party; (2) a breach thereof; (3) a resulting\n\ninjury; and (4) a proximate cause between the claimed breach and resulting injury.\"\n\nPedroza v. Bryant, 101 Wn.2d 226,228,677 P.2d 166 (1984).\n\n       Montecito argues that Himsl violated his obligations under RCW 18.86.030, .040,\n\nand .060 to exercise reasonable skill and care, deal honestly and in good faith, and to\n\ncontinue to find buyers for the property. Br. of Appellant at 74. These allegations\n\nlargely parallel those undergirding the breach of contract argument, but Montecito\n\npresents these claims separately under the belief that chapter 18.86 RCW creates an\n\nindependent cause of action. Subsequent to the briefing in this case, the Washington\n\nSupreme Court decided the issue to the contrary in Jackowski v. Borchelt, 174 Wn.2d\n\n720, 733-36, 278 P.3d 1100 (2012).\n\n       There the court recognized that chapter 18.86 RCW imposes duties on real estate\n\nprofessionals that are in addition to any contractual obligations. In the absence of\n\nbriefing on the test set forth in Bennett v. Hardy, 113 Wn.2d 912, 920-21, 784 P.2d 1258\n\n(1990), the court declined to find that the statute created a cause of action:\n\n       Chapter 18.86 RCW does not indicate the creation of a new statutory cause\n       of action, but it does state that the common law continues to apply where it\n       is not limited or inconsistent. See RCW 18.86.110. Therefore, common\n       law tort causes of action remain the vehicle through which a party may\n       recover for a breach of statutory duties set forth in chapter 18.86 RCW.\n\n       Jackowski, 174 Wn.2d at 735.\n\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\fNo. 30 140-1-III; 30483-3-III\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\n       Similarly here, Montecito has not presented briefing under the Bennett factors that\n\nsuggest the legislature intended to create an independent cause of action. Thus, as in\n\nJackowski, any claim here must be pursued as a tort. Id. Montecito did not plead this\n\naspect of its case in that manner and thus presented no evidence that these duties were\n\nbreached or that they were a proximate cause of injury. Accordingly, summary judgment\n\nagain was proper.\n\n       The trial court did not err in dismissing the remaining causes at summary\n\njudgment.\n\n       Attorney Fees\n\n       The trial court granted attorney fees both under the contract and as CR 11\n\nsanctions. Montecito challenges both awards, which we will address as separate\n\narguments.\n\n       Common principles govern both of the bases for the fee awards. This court\n\nreviews a trial court's award of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion. Mahler v. Szucs,\n\n135 Wn.2d 398,435,957 P.2d 632 (1998). Discretion is abused when it is exercised on\n\nuntenable grounds or for untenable reasons. State ex rei. Carroll v. Junker, 79 Wn.2d 12,\n\n26,482 P.2d 775 (1971).\n\n      Attorney fees should be awarded only for services related to causes of action that\n\nallow for fees. Absher Constr. Co. v. Kent Sch. Dist. No. 415, 79 Wn. App. 841, 847, 917\n\nP.2d 1086 (1995). If fees are authorized for only some of the claims, the fee award must\n\n                                            15 \n\n\fNo. 30140-1-111; 30483-3-111\nMontecito Estates v. Rimsl\n\n\nproperly reflect a segregation of time spent on issues for which fees are authorized from\n\ntime spent on other issues. Rume v. Am. Disposal Co., 124 Wn.2d 656, 672, 880 P.2d\n\n988 (1994). However, ifthe claims are so related that no reasonable segregation can be\n\nmade, the court does not need to require segregation. Id. at 673.\n\n          In awarding attorney fees, Washington courts apply the lodestar method and the\n\ntrial court must enter findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting its decision to\n\naward fees. Mahler, 135 Wn.2d at 434-35. The findings are necessary for an appellate\n\ncourt to review the award. Bentzen v. Demmons, 68 Wn. App. 339, 350,842 P.2d 1015\n\n(1993). Where a trial court fails to create the appropriate record, remand for entry of\n\nproper findings and conclusions is the appropriate remedy. Mahler, 135 Wn.2d at 435.\n\n          Contractual Fees. The trial court concluded that Himsl's counsel spent 60 percent\n\nof their time defending three of the contract based causes of action. Finding that all of\n\nthe requested fees were adequately documented and justified by the demands of the case,\n\nthe court ordered that Montecito pay 60 percent of that figure as attorney fees under the\n\nlisting agreement. Concluding that there was no abuse of discretion, we affirm this\n\nruling.\n\n          The trial court determined both that the hours spent defending the case were\n\nreasonable and well documented in the billing records as well as finding that the hourly\n\nrates were reasonable, ifperhaps lower than warranted. CP at 856, Conclusions of Law\n\n(CL) 19-20. The court also concluded that Himsl's estimate that his counsel spent 60\n\n                                              16 \n\n\fNo. 30140-I-III; 30483-3-II1\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\npercent of their time on contract based claims was reasonable. CP at 854, CL 4.\n\nMontecito does not take issue with these conclusions in its argument. It instead argues\n\nthat because its breach of contract claim is meritorious, the contractual attorney fee must\n\nbe reversed and it should be awarded its attorney fees for the appeal. See Br. of\n\nAppellant at 42-43, 89-91.\n\n       For several reasons, contract based fees were available. First, this court has\n\nupheld the summary judgment dismissal of the breach of contract allegation. Second, the\n\nbreach of contract was not the only contract based allegation pleaded by Montecito. The\n\ntrial court recognized that the conspiracy and extortion arguments also were based on the\n\ncontract, as were some of the earlier dismissed theories. Third, Montecito itself claimed\n\nattorney fees under the contract in this appeal and in the trial court. Those actions\n\nprovided strong evidence that these were contract based actions.\n\n       Given all, the trial court correctly determined that much of this litigation was\n\ncontract based. The court had evidence from counsel that 60 percent of their evidence\n\nwas directed toward the contract claims. This was a tenable ground to award the fees.\n\n       The attorney fee award of $131 ,0 11.58 against Montecito is affirmed.\n\n       CR 11 Sanction. The trial court also awarded $164,264.48 in attorney fees and\n\ncosts as a CR II sanction against Montecito, Ms. Trujillo, and attorney John Bolliger.\n\nThe appellants raise numerous challenges to this ruling. We will analyze, often briefly,\n\nthe various claims in the context of a single issue. We remand for the trial court to revisit\n\n                                             17 \n\n\fNo. 30140-1-111; 30483-3-111\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\nits findings and clarify the link between the award and the attorney fees expended on the\n\nclaims meriting the sanction. 12\n\n       \"We review a trial court's CR 11 sanction decision for abuse of discretion.\" In re\n\nRecall o/Lindquist, 172 Wn.2d 120, 141,258 P.3d 9 (2011). In addition to the\n\npreviously discussed bases for finding abuse of discretion, Lindquist noted that a trial\n\ncourt also can \"abuse[ ] its discretion because its decision was reached by applying an\n\nincomplete legal standard.\" Id. at 142.\n\n       CR 11(a) provides that an attorney, or the party ifnot represented by counsel, must\n\nsign every pleading or motion. The rule then requires, in relevant part:\n\n       The signature ... constitutes a certificate ... that the party or attorney has\n       read the pleading ... and that to the best of the party's or attorney's\n       knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable\n       under the circumstances: (I) it is well grounded in fact; (2) it is warranted\n       by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or\n       reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law; (3) it is not\n       interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause\n       unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation; and (4) the\n       denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence . . .. If a\n       pleading, motion, or legal memorandum is signed in violation of this rule,\n       the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, may impose upon the\n       person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction,\n       which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount\n       of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading,\n       motion, or legal memorandum, including a reasonable attorney fee.\n\n\n\n        12 Because we are sending the matter back to the trial court for further findings, we\ndo not address arguments relating to the adequacy of the existing findings and instead\naddress only those arguments that implicate the sufficiency of the evidence or theories of\nliability.\n\n                                             18\n\fNo. 30140-1-111; 30483-3-111\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\nCR 11(a).\n\n       When CR 11 is violated, the court may impose sanctions and should only impose\n\n\"the least severe sanction necessary to carry out the purpose of the rule.\" Biggs v. Vail,\n\n124 Wn.2d 193, 197,876 P.2d 448 (1994). The purpose of the rule is to deter frivolous\n\nfilings rather than act as a fee shifting provision. Id. The moving party always bears the\n\nburden to justify the request for sanctions. Id. at 202. The court must identify the\n\nsanctionable conduct and identify how the filing violated the rule. Id. at 201.\n\n       CR 11 sanctions are available on any claim even after it has been voluntarily\n\ndismissed. Escude v. King County Pub. Hosp. Dist. No.2, 117 Wn. App. 183, 193, 69\n\nP.3d 895 (2003). Because \"[t]he violation of Rule 11 is complete upon the filing of the\n\noffending paper\" even a \"voluntary dismissal of the suit, does not expunge the violation,\n\nalthough such corrective action should be used to mitigate the amount of sanction\n\nimposed.\" Biggs, 124 Wn.2d at 199-200.\n\n       With these guidelines in mind, we now tum to the various challenges appellants\n\nraise. Mr. Bolliger argues that he and Ms. Trujillo are not proper parties for a CR 11\n\nsanction. The rule, however, says otherwise. Ms. Trujillo is a party as well as the owner\n\nof Montecito (the other party), and she also signed the complaint. For all of those\n\nreasons, the text of the rule includes her as a responsible party. Similarly, the rule\n\nexpressly authorizes the court to sanction the attorney as the person who signs the\n\npleading. The attorney can be sanctioned individually rather than through the attorney's\n\n                                             19 \n\n\fNo. 30140-1-111; 30483-3-111\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\nfirm, or vice versa, because the rule is to be broadly interpreted to most effectively deter\n\nviolations. Madden v. Foley, 83 Wn. App. 385, 392, 922 P.2d 1364 (1996). For all of\n\nthese reasons, we see no error in the trial court's assignment of responsibility for the CR\n\n11 sanctions.\n\n       Montecito also argues that Himsl did not properly mitigate his attorney fees.\n\nBiggs is dispositive against this argument. Noting there that a party cannot allow the\n\nopposing party to continually violate the rule before seeking CR 11 sanctions, the court\n\nrequired that the offending party must be put on notice before CR 11 sanctions can be\n\nimposed. Biggs, 124 Wn.2d at 198. The court concluded that the plaintiff was on notice\n\nafter the defendant filed a motion under RCW 4.84.185, which authorizes attorney fees\n\nfor frivolous litigation. Biggs, 124 Wn.2d at 199. Notice under that statute was sufficient\n\nto provide notice that CR 11 sanctions also could be sought. Id. at 199-200.\n\n       Even greater notice was given here because Himsl filed a counterclaim asserting\n\nCR 11. Montecito was thus on notice far earlier than in Biggs that sanctions were being\n\nsought under CR 11. Even at that, it took Montecito two years of litigation before it\n\ndropped most of its claims. On these facts, Himsl did not fail to mitigate his damages.\n\n       Montecito argues that the trial court lacked a factual basis for finding that the 22\n\ndismissed counts were in violation of CR 11 because they were dropped before being\n\nsubject to a CR 11 motion. The trial court determined that they were baseless and that\n\ncounsel failed to properly investigate them. CP at 855, Finding of Fact 8. The trial court\n\n                                             20 \n\n\fNo. 30140-I-III; 30483-3-III\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\nbased its determinations in part on the fact that after Himsl presented his arguments in\n\nsupport of sanctions, Montecito never attempted to rebut them by showing its\n\ninvestigation or factual bases for the claims. CP at 888. Although no court appears to\n\nhave yet addressed this issue, we agree with the trial court. It is difficult for a party to\n\nestablish a negative and that party has no ability to establish what actions opposing\n\ncounsel took to investigate a case. Thus, once a party alleges that a claim is baseless and\n\npresents its argument and evidence, the defending party needs to present any evidence it\n\nhas in opposition to the motion. A party that fails to respond with its evidence runs the\n\nrisk of the trial judge drawing the adverse inference that the party has no evidence and\n\ndid, in fact, act as alleged. Cf Fiore v. PPG Indus., Inc., 169 Wn. App. 325, 353-54, 279\n\nPJd 972 (2012) (in challenge to reasonableness of hours expended by opposing counsel,\n\njudge was free to draw an adverse inference from challenging party's refusal to submit its\n\nhours).\n\n          The fact that it took almost two years for Montecito to begin withdrawing its\n\nclaims is further support for the inference of insufficient investigation. If Montecito had\n\nwithdrawn its claims early in the litigation, there may have been little or no basis for\n\nsanctions. After a lengthy period of litigation, however, it is entirely reasonable to\n\nconclude that voluntarily withdrawn claims lacked merit. We thus believe that Himsl's\n\nunrebutted argument supported the trial court's determination that the dismissed claims\n\nwere filed in violation of CR 11.\n\n                                              21\n\fNo. 30140-1-111; 30483-3-111\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\n       The trial court also indicated that two of the remaining five claims were not in\n\nviolation of CR 11. However, the court only identified the breach of contract claim as\n\none of the two nonsanctioned causes and did not specify the other. This falls far short of\n\nexplaining why the other three causes were in violation of CR 11. For the reasons we\n\ndiscuss next, we remand for findings that identify these causes and why they were subject\n\nto sanctions.\n\n       The last issue we address is the amount of fees awarded. Biggs is quite explicit on\n\nthe topic of findings and their relationship to a fee award. The sanction is to be limited to\n\nthe amount \"reasonably expended in responding to the sanctionable filings.\" Biggs, 124\n\nWn.2d at 201. The court must thus identify the sanctionable conduct, explain how it\n\nviolated CR 11, and then may require the payment of the \"attorney fees incurred in\n\nresponding specifically to the sanctionable conduct.\" Id. at 202. As applicable to this\n\ncase, the findings must justify the fee award by expressly identifying the amount of time\n\nexpended responding solely to the causes that were filed in violation of the rule. With\n\nrespect to the three unidentified causes of action, the findings must also identify them and\n\nexplain how they violated CR 11 in addition to identifying the time spent responding to\n\nthem. 13\n\n\n\n       13We reject Montecito's claim that the inadequacy of the findings on these causes\nprecludes imposition of a sanction related to them. Since we believe the record could\nsupport the sanction decision, we cannot as a matter of law reverse the sanction as to\nthose causes. Still, it is the trial court's role to decide what evidence it found persuasive\n\n                                             22 \n\n\fNo. 30140-I-III; 30483-3-III\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\n       Accordingly, we remand this case to the trial court with directions to revisit 14 the\n\nCR 11 ruling and enter revised findings in support of its award. Identification of the time\n\nspent responding solely to the sanctionable causes is critical in light of our decision to\n\nuphold the attorney fee award under the contract. As the court has already found that 60\n\npercent of the fees were related to contract based claims, and the one identified claim that\n\nwas not sanctioned was the breach of contract claim, it is especially important to\n\ndistinguish between the time spent on that claim and the time spent on the sanctionable\n\ncauses. Because the facts significantly overlap, the effect of this exercise may be to\n\nreduce (perhaps significantly) the amount of the CR 11 sanction. Or maybe not. We also\n\nnote that the combined effect of the two awards was to reimburse Himsl 135 percent of\n\nthe attorney fees expended by the defense. It is easily possible that a contract based\n\nclaim also could be sanctionable under CR 11 and thus provide two bases for reimbursing\n\nthe defense for the same work. However, the total amount collected by the defense\n\ncannot exceed 100 percent of the fees incurred. The court's order should reflect such a\n\nlimitation.\n\n       The instigation of a lawsuit should not be undertaken lightly, even in the face of\n\nclear provocation as occurred here. When one party needlessly imposes costs on another,\n\n\n\nand identify that evidence. While that has been done for the 22 withdrawn causes, it still\nneeds to be done for the other three.\n       14 We use this verb advisedly. See Deep Water Brewing, LLC v. Fairway\nResources, LTD, 170 Wn. App. 1, 8-9,282 P.3d 146 (2012).\n\n                                             23\n\fNo. 30140-1-111; 30483-3-111\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\nCR 11 may provide a remedy for the wasteful behavior, even if the effect is to financially\n\nruin the party or its attorney. Such a tragic outcome is a cautionary tale for those who\n\nwould misuse our justice system.\n\n      Affirmed in part and remanded for entry of revised findings.\n\n      A majority of the panel has determined this opinion will not be printed in the\n\nWashington Appellate Reports, but it will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW\n\n2.06.040.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        Korsmo, C.J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n      Brown, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                            24 \n\n\f",

Rimsl\n\n\n       KORSMO, C.J. -     \"Two wrongs do not make a right.\"l This case proves the truth\n\nof that adage better than most. Respondent filed a meritless lien. Appellant retaliated\n\nwith 27 causes of action ranging from breach of contract to civil conspiracy. The trial\n\ncourt imposed CR 11 sanctions in excess of$165,000 against appellant's counsel for\n\nfiling a lengthy list of causes of action that lacked merit and were not withdrawn until\n\ntwo years of litigation had ensued. The court also dismissed the remaining counts on\n\nsummary judgment and awarded additional attorney fees under the parties' contract.\n\nAlthough there was no litigation privilege applicable here, the trial court did properly\n\ngrant summary judgment. We affirm the dismissal of the action and remand the CR 11\n\nruling for further findings that more clearly identify the amount of work performed on the\n\nsanctionable counts.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n       The hopes of a residential real estate developer and her listing agent were dashed,\n\nperhaps by a failing economy. Each side blamed the other, and litigation ensued; the\n\nsordid details do not show either party in a good light. Unfortunately, attorneys aided\n\nand abetted the battle.\n\n\n\n\n      1 This maxim originates in the Latin phrase \"Injuria non excusat injuriam\" (\"injury\ndoes not excuse an injury\"). See HERBERT BROOM, A SELECTION OF LEGAL MAXIMS,\nCLASSIFIED AND ILLUSTRATED, 394 (7th Amer. Ed. 1874).\n\n                                             2\n\n\fNo. 30140-1-111; 30483-3-111\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\n       Montecito Estates LLC and its owner, Priscilla Trujillo (collectively, Montecito),\n\nattempted to develop a 35 lot residential subdivision in Prosser. They hired Douglas\n\nHimsl to market the estates via a listing agreement that ran from December 2, 2005 to\n\nDecember 31, 2006. The listing agreement gave Himsl exclusive marketing rights for\n\none year. He was to receive commissions ranging from 3.5 percent to 5 percent of the\n\nsale price of any lots sold during that year, as well as for any lots sold due to his efforts\n\nwithin 180 days of the end of the listing agreement.\n\n       Montecito cancelled the listing agreement on May 8, 2006 for unsatisfactory\n\nperformance; not one lot had been sold in the six months since the agreement had been\n\nsigned. Acting through counsel, Mr. Himsl responded the following month by filing a\n\nlien in an amount representing 5 percent of the purchase price of the applicable \"home\n\npackage\" for each lot in the development. The lien cited the commercial real estate\n\nbroker lien act, chapter 60.42 RCW, and was directed to Montecito's proceeds and rents\n\nrather than the land itself.\n\n       Financiers declined to further finance Montecito and other real estate agents\n\ndeclined to attempt to sell the properties in light of the lien. In July 2007, despite the fact\n\nthat no properties had been sold and the time period in which Mr. Himsl had the right to\n\nclaim a commission had expired, his attorneys sent a settlement demand to Montecito\n\nrequesting $300,000 in exchange for releasing the lien. In subsequent pleadings,\n\nMontecito characterized this as a \"ransom demand.\" Montecito lost the properties when\n\n                                              3\n\n\fNo. 30140-1-III; 30483-3-III\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\nit signed a deed in lieu of foreclosure on November 5, 2007 that granted all of the lots to\n\na creditor, Special Services, Inc.\n\n         Montecito filed suit against Himsl on September 25,2008. The action asserted 12\n\ncauses of action against Himsl personally. The complaint was amended July 31, 2009 to\n\nassert 25 causes of action; Himsl's attorneys were added as defendants. A second\n\namended complaint was filed October 21, 2009; this document asserted 27 causes of\n\naction including contract and tort based claims. In addition to Himsl and his attorneys,\n\nthe complaint added Chicago Title Insurance Co. (Montecito's former escrow agent) and\n\nthe Cumutts, a couple who had cancelled a purchase agreement for a lot in the\n\nsubdivision, as defendnats.\n\n         Himsl filed a counterclaim raising two breach of contract claims and asserting a\n\nCR 11 sanction claim for harassment. In response to a court order, Montecito on\n\nDecember 14, 2009 filed its first of several \"more definite statements\" attempting to\n\ndefine its theory of the case. Himsl was identified as a defendant on 26 of the 27 causes\n\nof action. A first amended more definite statement soon followed that clarified the\n\ncauses of action asserted against the other defendants. A voluntary second amended\n\nmore definite statement filed on June 14, 2010, dismissed 14 of the 26 claims against Mr.\n\nHimsl.\n\n         The trial court entered a ruling on December 10, 2010 that declared the lien filed\n\nby Himsl and his counsel was invalid. The court determined that chapter 60.42 RCW\n\n                                              4\n\n\fNo. 30140-1-111; 30483-3-111\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\nwas inapplicable because the residential subdivision did not involve commercial real\n\nestate.\n\n          Montecito dismissed several more claims after Ms. Trujillo's deposition\n\nestablished that she had no factual bases for them. Meanwhile, the more definite\n\nstatements continued. The third and fourth amended statements removed Chicago Title\n\nand most of the other claims in the case. Additional claims were dropped when\n\nMontecito answered Rimsl's motion for summary judgment, resulting in five remaining\n\ncauses of action: breach of contract, civil conspiracy, extortion/economic duress/business\n\ncompulsion, principal liability for actions of his attorneys, and breach of statutory duties\n\nunder chapter 18.86 RCW.\n\n          The trial court issued a memorandum decision on February 28, 2011 that granted\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Rimsl on the remaining five claims. 2 The trial court\n\nissued its ruling on alternative bases: (1) the remaining claims were all related to the lien\n\naction and protected by the litigation privilege; and (2) Montecito failed to present a\n\nprima facie case on each claim. An order of dismissal was entered on April 1, 2011.\n\n          Montecito moved for reconsideration. Meanwhile, the trial court considered\n\nRimsl's request for attorney fees. The trial court accepted Rimsl' s argument that 60\n\n\n      2 The court dismissed the claims against Rimsl' s attorneys on April 1, 2011\npursuant to CR 12(b)(6). The court denied the attorneys' motion for CR 11 sanctions.\nThe Curnutts also were released from the litigation by summary judgment on April 1,\n2011.\n\n                                              5\n\n\fNo. 30140-1-III; 30483-3-III\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\npercent of the fees incurred related to the contract based claims and ordered Montecito to\n\npay Himsl $131,011.58 under the listing agreement, a figure that represented 60 percent\n\nof the defense fees and costs incurred.\n\n       The court then turned to the CR 11 attorney fees request. Noting that 22 of the 27\n\ncauses were voluntarily dismissed two years into the litigation with no evidence of a\n\nfactual basis for any of the claims, and three of the other claims were pursued despite Ms.\n\nTrujillo having no factual support for them, the trial court found that the majority of them\n\nwere \"filed vindictively and in bad faith, and were advanced for purposes of harassment,\n\nnuisance, and spite.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 853. Finding repeated violations ofCR 11,\n\nthe court awarded Himsl 75 percent of his requested attorney fees, a total of $164,264.48,\n\nto be paid by Montecito, Ms. Trujillo, and attorney John Bolliger. They timely appealed\n\nthe attorney fee awards to this court.\n\n       The trial court eventually denied the motion for reconsideration. With the entry of\n\nthat order, Montecito appealed the summary judgment ruling and the denial of\n\nreconsideration. The two appeals were consolidated for argument and resolution.\n\n                                          ANALYSIS\n\n       The appeals challenge on several grounds both the dismissal of the case and the\n\nattorney fee awards. We will address the arguments in that order.\n\n       Dismissal\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\n\fNo. 30140-1-III; 30483-3-III\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\n       Montecito argues both that the doctrine of litigation immunity did not apply to its\n\nremaining causes of action and that material questions of fact existed that precluded the\n\nsummary judgment ruling. We agree in part that the broad assertion of litigation\n\nimmunity was not justified on all causes of action, but we agree with the trial court that\n\nsummary judgment was proper. Before addressing Montecito's arguments, we first note\n\nthe standards governing this aspect of this appeal.\n\n       This court reviews a summary judgment de novo, performing the same inquiry as\n\nthe trial court.

Himsl\n\n\n       Litigation Immunity. Himsl argues that because all of the remaining actions\n\nrevolved around the lien filed by his lawyers, he has immunity. We disagree. No court\n\nhas construed litigation immunity so broadly. Tortious conduct is not immune from\n\nliability merely because a party hired a lawyer to engage in the behavior.\n\n       Washington recognizes that statements made by counsel in the course of litigation\n\nare immune from defamation actions. E.g., McNeal v. Allen, 95 Wn.2d 265,621 P.2d\n\n1285 (1980); Gold Seal Chinchillas, Inc. v.

This common law\n\nimmunity is founded in the need of counsel to have \"the utmost freedom in their efforts to\n\nsecure justice for their clients.\" McNeal, 95 Wn.2d at 267.\n\n       This court has ruled that an attorney is immune from litigation by an opposing\n\nparty for actions taken on behalf of a client against that party. Jeckle v. Crotty, 120 Wn.\n\nApp. 374,386,85 P.2d 931 (2004). In Jeckle, this court relied upon the judicial action\n\nimmunity recognized in the factually similar case of Kittler v. Eckberg, Lammers, Briggs,\n\nWolff& Vierling, 535 N.W.2d 653,657-58 (Minn. Ct. App. 1995). Jeckle, 120 Wn. App.\n\nat 386. In Kittler, attorneys were sued for defamation over a letter written to solicit\n\nadditional clients to sue the plaintiff. 535 N.W.2d at 654-55. Applying the Restatement\n\n(Second) o/Torts § 586 (1977), the Minnesota court extended the absolute immunity for\n\ndefamation granted attorneys to prelitigation good faith solicitation of clients for an\n\n                                              8\n\n\fNo. 30140-1-III; 30483-3-III\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\nanticipated lawsuit. Kittler, 535 N.W.2d at 655-57. In Jeckle this court agreed with\n\nKittler that the attorney immunity applied outside of the courtroom and extended it to the\n\nattorney's actions in soliciting clients and deposing the opposing party using information\n\nfound in his Medical Quality Assurance Commission file. Jeckle, 120 Wn. App. at 378,\n\n386. The central core of the allegations addressed counsel's communication of\n\ninformation during litigation, the very reason that the defamation privilege exists. The\n\nattorney immunity for defamation based claims properly covered the conduct at issue in\n\nJeckle, which essentially sounded in defamation.\n\n       Jeckle did not recognize a broad litigation immunity privilege. Even if it had,\n\nhowever, it would not apply here for two reasons. First, the action of filing the lien\n\noccurred before the litigation and was not an early step in initiating an action. An action\n\nthat causes litigation, whether it be an automobile accident, wrongful death, or a lien\n\nfiling, simply is not an action taken to initiate or further litigation.\n\n       Second, Himsl's argument that he is entitled to the immunity enjoyed by his\n\nattorney is without foundation. He cites no authority suggesting that the attorney's\n\nimmunity is shared with the client. Although we can foresee circumstances in which it\n\nwould be necessary to extend the attorney's immunity to the client lest a party do\n\nindirectly what they cannot do directly, we leave consideration of such cases to the\n\nfuture. Here we face a broad assertion of a client's immunity in tort based on immunity\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\n\fNo. 30140-1-111; 30483-3-111\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\nfor defamation held by the client's attorney.3 This is essentially the converse of the\n\ninfamous Nuremberg defense. 4 We do not believe that a client can claim immunity for\n\nhis agent's actions except in carefully delineated circumstances that are not present here.\n\n       A tortious action is not necessarily immune merely because it is taken by an\n\nattorney on behalf of a client. 5 Numerous causes of action, often raised as counterclaims,\n\nare routinely pleaded in response to actions taken by the opposing party's attorney. Some\n\nexamples include malicious prosecution,6 slander oftitle,7 and anti-SLAPp 8 actions.\n\nIndeed, CR II would have a very narrow application if not applied to actions taken by\n\nattorneys on behalf of their clients.\n\n       We conclude that there is no broad-based litigation immunity doctrine. Claims of\n\nimmunity must be considered narrowly and in relation to the purpose of the immunity to\n\nallow counsel freedom to fully present a case.\n\n\n\n        3 Himsl' s attorneys were released from the case on the basis of immunity.\nMontecito never appealed that ruling and we do not express any opinion about it.\n        4 See United States v. Cortes-Caban, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">691</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 n.13 (1st Cir. 2012) ('\"[W]e\nreject the validity of a so-called Nuremberg defense ...

This claim founders on the language of\n\nthe contract and the absence of any expert testimony establishing the duties Montecito\n\nclaims were breached.\n\n       \"A breach of contract is actionable only if the contract imposes a duty, the duty is\n\nbreached, and the breach proximately causes damage to the claimant.\" Nw.

When the listing agent fails to make efforts to sell the property, the\n\nagreement properly can be terminated by the seller. Id. at 381-82.\n\n       Montecito has cited no case authority suggesting that the noted behavioral\n\nstandards are components of the good faith effort required by the contract. It likewise did\n\nnot present any expert testimony suggesting that being pleasant to the seller is part of the\n\ngood faith duty or that industry standards set forth requirements for staffing or timeliness\n\nof advertising. Absent some evidence that Himsl had a duty to act in a specific manner,\n\nMontecito has not shown that Himsl breached his contractual obligations prior to the\n\npoint the contract was terminated.\n\n       Montecito contends that Himsl also breached the contract after it was terminated\n\nby filing the lien. We do not understand how Montecito believes Himsl had any\n\ncontinuing obligations under the contract once Montecito cancelled it. Nonetheless, even\n\nif there were such obligations, Montecito has failed to establish them under either the\n\nterms of the agreement or under the duty of good faith.\n\n       For all of the noted reasons, Montecito failed to establish a prima facie case of\n\nbreach of contract.

These allegations\n\nlargely parallel those undergirding the breach of contract argument, but Montecito\n\npresents these claims separately under the belief that chapter 18.86 RCW creates an\n\nindependent cause of action.

Thus, as in\n\nJackowski, any claim here must be pursued as a tort. Id.

The trial court concluded that Himsl's counsel spent 60 percent\n\nof their time defending three of the contract based causes of action. Finding that all of\n\nthe requested fees were adequately documented and justified by the demands of the case,\n\nthe court ordered that Montecito pay 60 percent of that figure as attorney fees under the\n\nlisting agreement. Concluding that there was no abuse of discretion, we affirm this\n\nruling.\n\n          The trial court determined both that the hours spent defending the case were\n\nreasonable and well documented in the billing records as well as finding that the hourly\n\nrates were reasonable, ifperhaps lower than warranted.

Himsl\n\n\npercent of their time on contract based claims was reasonable. CP at 854, CL 4.\n\nMontecito does not take issue with these conclusions in its argument. It instead argues\n\nthat because its breach of contract claim is meritorious, the contractual attorney fee must\n\nbe reversed and it should be awarded its attorney fees for the appeal. See Br. of\n\nAppellant at 42-43, 89-91.\n\n       For several reasons, contract based fees were available. First, this court has\n\nupheld the summary judgment dismissal of the breach of contract allegation. Second, the\n\nbreach of contract was not the only contract based allegation pleaded by Montecito. The\n\ntrial court recognized that the conspiracy and extortion arguments also were based on the\n\ncontract, as were some of the earlier dismissed theories. Third, Montecito itself claimed\n\nattorney fees under the contract in this appeal and in the trial court. Those actions\n\nprovided strong evidence that these were contract based actions.\n\n       Given all, the trial court correctly determined that much of this litigation was\n\ncontract based. The court had evidence from counsel that 60 percent of their evidence\n\nwas directed toward the contract claims. This was a tenable ground to award the fees.\n\n       The attorney fee award of $131 ,0 11.58 against Montecito is affirmed.\n\n       CR 11 Sanction. The trial court also awarded $164,264.48 in attorney fees and\n\ncosts as a CR II sanction against Montecito, Ms. Trujillo, and attorney John Bolliger.\n\nThe appellants raise numerous challenges to this ruling. We will analyze, often briefly,\n\nthe various claims in the context of a single issue.

Mr. Bolliger argues that he and Ms. Trujillo are not proper parties for a CR 11\n\nsanction. The rule, however, says otherwise. Ms. Trujillo is a party as well as the owner\n\nof Montecito (the other party), and she also signed the complaint. For all of those\n\nreasons, the text of the rule includes her as a responsible party. Similarly, the rule\n\nexpressly authorizes the court to sanction the attorney as the person who signs the\n\npleading. The attorney can be sanctioned individually rather than through the attorney's\n\n                                             19 \n\n\fNo. 30140-1-111; 30483-3-111\nMontecito Estates v.

For all of\n\nthese reasons, we see no error in the trial court's assignment of responsibility for the CR\n\n11 sanctions.\n\n       Montecito also argues that Himsl did not properly mitigate his attorney fees.\n\nBiggs is dispositive against this argument. Noting there that a party cannot allow the\n\nopposing party to continually violate the rule before seeking CR 11 sanctions, the court\n\nrequired that the offending party must be put on notice before CR 11 sanctions can be\n\nimposed. Biggs, 124 Wn.2d at 198. The court concluded that the plaintiff was on notice\n\nafter the defendant filed a motion under RCW 4.84.185, which authorizes attorney fees\n\nfor frivolous litigation. Biggs, 124 Wn.2d at 199. Notice under that statute was sufficient\n\nto provide notice that CR 11 sanctions also could be sought. Id. at 199-200.\n\n       Even greater notice was given here because Himsl filed a counterclaim asserting\n\nCR 11. Montecito was thus on notice far earlier than in Biggs that sanctions were being\n\nsought under CR 11. Even at that, it took Montecito two years of litigation before it\n\ndropped most of its claims. On these facts, Himsl did not fail to mitigate his damages.\n\n       Montecito argues that the trial court lacked a factual basis for finding that the 22\n\ndismissed counts were in violation of CR 11 because they were dropped before being\n\nsubject to a CR 11 motion. The trial court determined that they were baseless and that\n\ncounsel failed to properly investigate them. CP at 855, Finding of Fact 8. The trial court\n\n                                             20 \n\n\fNo. 30140-I-III; 30483-3-III\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\nbased its determinations in part on the fact that after Himsl presented his arguments in\n\nsupport of sanctions, Montecito never attempted to rebut them by showing its\n\ninvestigation or factual bases for the claims. CP at 888. Although no court appears to\n\nhave yet addressed this issue, we agree with the trial court. It is difficult for a party to\n\nestablish a negative and that party has no ability to establish what actions opposing\n\ncounsel took to investigate a case. Thus, once a party alleges that a claim is baseless and\n\npresents its argument and evidence, the defending party needs to present any evidence it\n\nhas in opposition to the motion. A party that fails to respond with its evidence runs the\n\nrisk of the trial judge drawing the adverse inference that the party has no evidence and\n\ndid, in fact, act as alleged. Cf Fiore v.

If Montecito had\n\nwithdrawn its claims early in the litigation, there may have been little or no basis for\n\nsanctions. After a lengthy period of litigation, however, it is entirely reasonable to\n\nconclude that voluntarily withdrawn claims lacked merit. We thus believe that Himsl's\n\nunrebutted argument supported the trial court's determination that the dismissed claims\n\nwere filed in violation of CR 11.\n\n                                              21\n\fNo. 30140-1-111; 30483-3-111\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\n       The trial court also indicated that two of the remaining five claims were not in\n\nviolation of CR 11. However, the court only identified the breach of contract claim as\n\none of the two nonsanctioned causes and did not specify the other. This falls far short of\n\nexplaining why the other three causes were in violation of CR 11. For the reasons we\n\ndiscuss next, we remand for findings that identify these causes and why they were subject\n\nto sanctions.\n\n       The last issue we address is the amount of fees awarded. Biggs is quite explicit on\n\nthe topic of findings and their relationship to a fee award. The sanction is to be limited to\n\nthe amount \"reasonably expended in responding to the sanctionable filings.\" Biggs, 124\n\nWn.2d at 201. The court must thus identify the sanctionable conduct, explain how it\n\nviolated CR 11, and then may require the payment of the \"attorney fees incurred in\n\nresponding specifically to the sanctionable conduct.\" Id. at 202. As applicable to this\n\ncase, the findings must justify the fee award by expressly identifying the amount of time\n\nexpended responding solely to the causes that were filed in violation of the rule. With\n\nrespect to the three unidentified causes of action, the findings must also identify them and\n\nexplain how they violated CR 11 in addition to identifying the time spent responding to\n\nthem. 13\n\n\n\n       13We reject Montecito's claim that the inadequacy of the findings on these causes\nprecludes imposition of a sanction related to them. Since we believe the record could\nsupport the sanction decision, we cannot as a matter of law reverse the sanction as to\nthose causes. Still, it is the trial court's role to decide what evidence it found persuasive\n\n                                             22 \n\n\fNo. 30140-I-III; 30483-3-III\nMontecito Estates v. Himsl\n\n\n       Accordingly, we remand this case to the trial court with directions to revisit 14 the\n\nCR 11 ruling and enter revised findings in support of its award. Identification of the time\n\nspent responding solely to the sanctionable causes is critical in light of our decision to\n\nuphold the attorney fee award under the contract. As the court has already found that 60\n\npercent of the fees were related to contract based claims, and the one identified claim that\n\nwas not sanctioned was the breach of contract claim, it is especially important to\n\ndistinguish between the time spent on that claim and the time spent on the sanctionable\n\ncauses. Because the facts significantly overlap, the effect of this exercise may be to\n\nreduce (perhaps significantly) the amount of the CR 11 sanction. Or maybe not. We also\n\nnote that the combined effect of the two awards was to reimburse Himsl 135 percent of\n\nthe attorney fees expended by the defense. It is easily possible that a contract based\n\nclaim also could be sanctionable under CR 11 and thus provide two bases for reimbursing\n\nthe defense for the same work. However, the total amount collected by the defense\n\ncannot exceed 100 percent of the fees incurred. The court's order should reflect such a\n\nlimitation.\n\n       The instigation of a lawsuit should not be undertaken lightly, even in the face of\n\nclear provocation as occurred here. When one party needlessly imposes costs on another,\n\n\n\nand identify that evidence. While that has been done for the 22 withdrawn causes, it still\nneeds to be done for the other three.\n       14 We use this verb advisedly. See Deep Water Brewing, LLC v.
