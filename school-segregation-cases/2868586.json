Box 502\n       Washington, DC 20044\n        Attorneys for Appellee\n\nOPINION OF THE COURT\n\nRENDELL, Circuit Judge.\n\nPriscilla Adams claims that Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act (\"RFRA\") requires accommodation of her\nreligious beliefs so that her tax payments do not fund the\nmilitary. She also argues that RFRA and the free exercise\nclause mandate a finding that her religious beliefs\nconstitute \"reasonable cause\" under 26 U.S.C. S 6651 for\nher failure to file returns or pay tax and an\"unusual\ncircumstance\" which makes it \"against equity and good\nconscience\" for the Commissioner to impose the penalty for\nfailure to estimate under 26 U.S.C. S 6654.\n\nI. Factual and Procedural History\n\nThe facts are not in dispute. Adams is a devout Quaker;\nshe currently works as a \"Peace Field Secretary\" for the\nPhiladelphia Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of\nFriends. She sincerely believes that participation in war is\ncontrary to God's will, and hence, that the payment of taxes\nto fund the military is against the will of God. From 1985\nto 1989, Adams declared herself exempt from taxation, so\nno federal income tax would be withheld from her pay. In\n1989, the IRS sent a letter to her employer, the\nPhiladelphia Yearly Meeting, directing it to withhold taxes\nfrom her salary as if she were married and claiming one\nwithholding allowance.\n\nAdams has taken pains to ensure that she does not profit\nfrom her tax protests and to demonstrate that her beliefs\n\n                                2\n\fregarding refusal to pay taxes are sincere and are the result\nof being called or directed by God, in that she has been\ntested and challenged by \"clearness committees\" of\nmembers of her Meeting that have been convened to\nexamine her beliefs on this topic. They have determined\nthat the course of her conduct is the result of a\"leading\"\nfrom God. She asserts that she would voluntarily pay all of\nher federal income taxes if the money she paid were\ndirected to a fund that supported only non-military\nspending, or if her payments could be directed to non-\nmilitary expenditures, or that, with the consultation of a\nclearness committee, she would be willing to consider any\nother form of accommodation of her beliefs that could be\noffered by the government.\n\nThe Commissioner assessed deficiencies and penalties\nagainst Adams for the years 1988, 1989, 1992, 1993, and\n1994. The Tax Court determined that Adams was not\nexempt from the payment of taxes under RFRA and was\nliable for the deficiencies and penalties assessed against\nher, relying on United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252 (1982),\nand other case law preceding Employment Division v. Smith,\n494 U.S. 872 (1990). Adams now appeals to this court. We\nhave jurisdiction pursuant to 26 U.S.C. S 7482(a) (1994).\nOur review is plenary, as all of the issues raised are\nmatters of law. See Geisinger Health Plan v. Commissioner,\n30 F.3d 494, 498 (3d Cir. 1994); Lazore v. Commissioner,\n11 F.3d 1180, 1182 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nA. RFRA Claim\n\nThe parties do not contest the constitutionality or the\napplicability of RFRA to the case at hand. They agree that\nRFRA applies to the federal government, as Boerne v.\nFlores, 117 S. Ct. 2157 (1997), held only that RFRA was\nunconstitutional as applied to the states under section 5 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. For the purposes of this\nappeal, we assume without deciding that RFRA is\n\n                                3\n\fconstitutional as applied to the federal government. See\nAlamo v. Clay, 137 F.3d 1366, 1367 (D.C. Cir. 1998).1\n\nRFRA provides:\n\n       (a) In general\n\n       Government shall not substantially burden a person's\n       exercise of religion even if the burden results from a\n       rule of general applicability, except as provided in\n       subsection (b) of this section.\n\n       (b) Exception\n\n       Government may substantially burden a person's\n       exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that\n       application of the burden to the person --\n\n       (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental\n       interest; and\n\n       (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that\n       compelling governmental interest.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. In general, courts that have addressed the question of\nconstitutionality have found that RFRA is constitutional as applied to the\nfederal government. See In re Young, 141 F.3d 854 (8th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 119 S. Ct. 43 (1998); see also EEOC v. Catholic Univ. of America,\n83 F.3d 455, 468-70 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (finding RFRA constitutional as\napplied to Title VII, but relying on Fifth Circuit's decision in Boerne);\nbut\nsee Boerne, 117 S. Ct. at 2171 (Stevens, concurring, questioning\nEstablishment Clause implications of RFRA); 141 F.3d at 862-68 (Bogue,\ndissenting); United States v. Grant, 117 F.3d 788, 792 n.6 (5th Cir. 1997)\n(questioning RFRA's viability in the federal context); In re Gates, 212\nB.R.\n220 (Bankr. W.D.N.Y. 1997) (finding that Boerne overruled RFRA\naltogether). Some commentators have noted that RFRA may be\nunconstitutional as applied to federal law. See Marci Hamilton, The\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act is Unconstitutional, Period, 1 U. Pa. J.\nConst. L. 1 (1998); Aurora R. Bearse, Note, RFRA: Is it Necessary? Is it\nProper?, 50 Rutgers L. Rev. 1045 (1998); Edward J.W. Blatnik, Note, No\nRFRAF Allowed: The Status of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act's\nFederal Application in the Wake of City of Boerne v. Flores, 98 Colum. L.\nRev. 1410 (1998); but see Thomas C. Berg, The Constitutional Future of\nReligious Freedom Legislation, 20 U. Ark. Little Rock L.J. 715 (1998)\n(arguing that RFRA is constitutional as applied to the federal\ngovernment).\n\n                               4\n\fAdams argues that under RFRA, she is exempt from\nfederal income tax for the years in which she has been\nassessed a deficiency, because requiring her to pay these\ntaxes substantially burdens her religious beliefs. She\nconcedes that the government has a compelling interest in\nthe collection of taxes, but contends that the IRS failed to\nmeet its burden under RFRA of proving that it could not\naccommodate her, that is, that there is no less restrictive\nmeans of furthering the government's interest. She argues\nthat this failure of proof requires this court to reverse the\nTax Court and find that Adams owes no taxes for the years\nin question, and that she is not required to pay income\ntaxes so long as the Commissioner does not act to\naccommodate her objections. Adams contends that she is\nnot asking to be exempted from the payment of taxes\naltogether, but that she wants her beliefs to be\n\"accommodated,\" because RFRA requires that the IRS\naccommodate her objection, unless the refusal to do so is\nthe \"least restrictive means\" for achieving the government's\ncompelling interest in tax collection. The Commissioner\naccepts Adams's acknowledgment that the government has\na compelling interest in the collection of taxes, and urges\nus to find that the current system -- uniform and\nmandatory in nature -- is the least restrictive means of\nfurthering that interest.\n\nThere is little doubt that RFRA was enacted as a direct\nresponse to Employment Division v. Smith, and to restore\nthe tests that were routinely employed before the Supreme\nCourt's ruling that neutral, generally applicable laws may\nimpinge on religious practices, even in the absence of a\ncompelling state interest. See 494 U.S. at 882-84; Boerne,\n117 S. Ct. at 2161. RFRA requires courts to employ the test\nset forth above in the statutory language. First, the\nclaimant must demonstrate a \"substantial burden\" on her\nexercise of her religious beliefs. If she does so, the burden\nshifts to the government to demonstrate that the regulation\nor practice at issue furthers a \"compelling interest,\" and\nthat it furthers that interest by the \"least restrictive\nmeans.\" See S 2000bb-1; Small v. Lehman, 98 F.3d 762,\n767 (3d Cir. 1996), overruled by 117 S. Ct. 2157 (1997).2\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Small was overruled by Boerne. However, we use this case and other\ncases applying RFRA to state institutions and laws as a guide to how we\nshould interpret the statute, although we realize we are not bound by\ntheir dictates.\n\n                               5\n\fIn enacting RFRA, Congress specifically announced its\nintent to \"restore\" the \"compelling interest\" test set forth in\nSherbert v. Verner and Wisconsin v. Yoder:\n\n       The purposes of this chapter are --\n\n       (1) to restore the compelling interest test as set forth in\n       Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin\n       v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972) and to guarantee its\n       application in all cases where free exercise of religion is\n       substantially burdened; and\n\n       (2) to provide a claim or defense to persons whose\n       religious exercise is substantially burdened by the\n       government.\n\n       S 2000bb(b).\n\nHowever, Congress's intent with regard to the precise\ncontours of the elements of the RFRA test is a somewhat\ndifferent matter, as neither the statutory provisions, the\nlegislative history, nor the floor debates indicate exactly\nhow the elements of the test are defined, or are defined in\nrelation to the pre-Smith case law. See S 2000bb(a);\nS 2000bb-2; S. Rep. No. 103-111 (1993), at 5-9, 15-16,\nreprinted in 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1893, 1894-98, 1904-05;\nsee also 139 Cong. Rec. S1415-01, S14515-16 (daily ed.\nOct. 27, 1993) (statements of Senator Chaffee); 139 Cong.\nRec. S14461-01, S14462, S14468, S14469 (daily ed. Oct.\n26, 1993) (statements of Senators Feingold, Lieberman, and\nBradley); 139 Cong. Rec. S14350-01, S14350, S14353\n(daily ed. Oct. 26, 1993) (statements of Senators Kennedy\nand Hatch); 139 Cong. Rec. H2356-03, H2356-59, H2360-\n61 (daily ed. May 11, 1993) (remarks of Representatives\nBrooks Edwards, Fish, Hughes, and Schumer); The\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act: Hearing on S. 2969\nBefore the Comm. on the Judiciary of the United States\nSenate, 102nd Cong. 2, 129-35 (Sept. 18, 1992). While\nprior cases touched on one or more of the aspects of the\nRFRA test, these elements -- substantial burden,\ncompelling interest, least restrictive means -- did not\nconstitute a comprehensive standard, let alone a uniform or\nestablished test, prior to Smith.3 The instant case presents\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. The Supreme Court stated in Boerne,\"the Act imposes in every case\na least restrictive means requirement -- a requirement that was not used\n\n                               6\n\fthe issue, as to whether, and if so, how, we should\nconstrue RFRA in light of prior case law. The legislative\nhistory of both the House and the Senate versions of RFRA\ncontain explicit indications that prior case law is central to\nthe understanding of the compelling interest test:\n\n       The committee wishes to stress that the act does not\n       express approval or disapproval of the result reached\n       in any particular court decision involving the free\n       exercise of religion, including those cited in the act\n       itself. This bill is not a codification of the result\n       reached in any prior free exercise decision but rather\n       the restoration of the legal standard that was applied\n       in those decisions. Therefore, the compelling interest\n       test generally should not be construed more stringently\n       or more leniently than it was prior to Smith.\n\n       S. Rep. No. 103-111 at 9; H.R. Rep. No. 103-88 at 21\n       (1993).4\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nin the pre-Smith jurisprudence RFRA purported to codify.\" See 117 S. Ct.\nat 2171. We note that this \"element\" has in fact appeared sporadically in\nthose terms or as a \"narrowly tailored\" requirement. See Smith, 494 U.S.\nat 894-95 (O'Connor, concurring) (noting that in free exercise cases, \"we\nhave respected both the First Amendment's express textual mandate that\nthe governmental interest in regulation of conduct by requiring the\ngovernment to justify any substantial burden on religiously motivated\nconduct by a compelling state interest and by means narrowly tailored\nto achieve that interest,\" citing Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U.S.\n680, 699 (1989); Lee, 455 U.S. at 257-58, cited in S. Rep. 103-111 at 7;\nsee also Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n., 480 U.S. 136, 140-\n42 (1987) (strict scrutiny applies to free exercise unemployment\ncompensation challenge); Thomas v. Review Bd., 450 U.S. 707, 718\n(1981) (\"The state may justify an inroad on religious liberty by showing\nthat it is the least restrictive means of achieving some compelling state\ninterest.\")\n\n4. The floor debates contain an extended \"colloquy\" between Senators\nGrassley and Hatch that occurred during the Judiciary Committee\nmarkup of the bill, which states in pertinent part:\n\nGrassley: Does this bill change the way courts assess a \"compelling state\ninterest\"? Will it still be up to the judge -- who will look at all the\nfacts\nin the case -- to say whether there is a compelling interest? In other\nwords, this bill does not purport to legislate a definition of compelling\ninterest, does it?\n\n                               7\n\fThe legislative history accompanying the Senate bill also\nincludes the following directive: \"The committee expects\nthat the courts will look to free exercise cases decided prior\nto Smith for guidance in determining whether the exercise\nof religion has been substantially burdened and the least\nrestrictive means have been employed in furthering a\ncompelling governmental interest.\" S. Rep. 103-111 at 8-9.5\nCases decided before Smith involving application of the\nstandards to the tax system, or to situations analogous to\nthe tax system are, therefore, instructive. In United States\nv. Lee, the Supreme Court rejected a free exercise challenge\nto the imposition of social security taxes based on the fact\nthat mandatory participation was necessary to the\nfunctioning of the social security program, and that a\nvoluntary system would be impossible to administer. See\n455 U.S. at 257-59. In so finding, the Court noted:\n\n       Religious beliefs can be accommodated, see, e.g.,\n       Thomas, supra; Sherbert, supra, but there is a point at\n       which accommodation would \"radically restrict the\n       operating latitude of the legislature.\" . . . Unlike the\n       situation presented in Wisconsin v. Yoder, supra, it\n       would be difficult to accommodate the comprehensive\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nHatch: RFRA reestablishes a very familiar and traditional standard of\nreview that the courts have been applying since the 1963 decision\nSherbert v. Verner. That is why we do not attempt to define the standard\nin the bill. This bill does not dictate the proper result in a particular\nfree\nexercise case nor does it identify specific governmental interests that\nare\ncompelling. The courts will continue to determine whether burdens on\nreligious exercise are justified, based upon a consideration and weighing\nof all relevant facts and circumstances. Historically, the courts have had\nlittle difficulty identifying important governmental interests. For\nexample,\nthe courts have found eradication of racial discrimination to be a\ncompelling governmental interest.\n\n139 Cong. Rec. S14461-01, S14470 (daily ed. Oct. 27, 1993).\n\n5. In enacting RFRA, Congress seized upon language from Supreme\nCourt opinions to create a statutory cause of action. In determining the\nbounds of Congressional intent in creating that statutory right we look\nto Congress's statements about pre-Smith case law as instructive for our\npurposes, namely, to \"say what the law is.\" Marbury v. Madison, 1\nCranch 137, 177 (1803).\n\n                               8\n\f       social security system with myriad exceptions flowing\n       from a wide variety of religious beliefs. The obligation\n       to pay the social security tax initially is not\n       fundamentally different from the obligation to pay\n       income taxes; the difference -- in theory at least-- is\n       that the social security tax revenues are segregated for\n       use only in furtherance of the statutory program. There\n       is no principled way, for purposes of this case, to\n       distinguish between general taxes and those imposed\n       under the Social Security Act. If, for example, a\n       religious adherent believes war is a sin, and if a certain\n       percentage of the federal budget can be identified as\n       devoted to war-related activities, such individuals\n       would have a similarly valid claim to be exempt from\n       paying that percentage of the income tax. The tax\n       system could not function if denominations were\n       allowed to challenge the tax system because tax\n       payments were spent in a manner that violates their\n       religious belief. . . . Because the broad public interest\n       in maintaining sound tax system is of such a high\n       order, religious belief in conflict with the payment of\n       taxes affords no basis for resisting the tax.\n\n       455 U.S. at 259-60.\n\nIn Hernandez, members of the Church of Scientology raised\nseveral challenges to the disallowance of claimed\nexemptions for the monies they had paid for spiritual\ntraining classes and sessions, including a free exercise\nchallenge. In upholding the disallowance of exemptions in\nthe face of their free exercise challenge, the Hernandez\ncourt relied on Lee:\n\n       [O]ur decision in Lee establishes that even a\n       substantial burden would be justified by the \"broad\n       public interest in maintaining a sound tax system,\"\n       free of \"myriad exceptions flowing from a wide variety\n       of religious beliefs.\" 455 U.S. at 260. . . . That these\n       cases involve federal income taxes, not the Social\n       Security system, is of no consequence. Ibid. The fact\n       that Congress has already crafted some deductions and\n       exemptions in the Code also is of no consequence, for\n       the guiding principle is that a tax \"must be uniformly\n\n                               9\n\f       applicable to all, except as Congress provides explicitly\n       otherwise.\" Id. at 261.\n\n       490 U.S. at 699 (emphasis added in original).\n\nLee and Hernandez are both part of a line of cases that\nhave refused to recognize free exercise challenges to the\npayment of taxes or penalties imposed due to a refusal to\npay taxes as a protest against the military activities of the\nUnited States.

Malinowski, 472 F.2d\n850 (3d Cir. 1973) (First Amendment an insufficient\ndefense to tax evasion).6\n\nIn the case before us, the Tax Court stated that the\n\"uniform, mandatory participation in the Federal income\ntax system, irrespective of religious belief, is a compelling\ngovernmental interest. . . . As a result, requiring petitioner's\nparticipation in the Federal income tax system is the only,\nand thus the least restrictive, means of furthering the\nGovernment's interest.\" See Adams v. Commissioner, 110\nT.C. 137, 139 (1998), citing Hernandez, 490 U.S. at 699-\n700; Lee, 455 U.S. at 260. Adams argues that the tax court\nmisconstrued the compelling interest, and did so in so\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. In discussing instances in which the \"compelling interest\" test has\nbeen used to uphold governmental practices, Congress cited cases\ndisallowing the availability of tax exemptions on the basis of religious\npractice and belief, namely, Hernandez, Lee, and Bob Jones University v.\nUnited States, 461 U.S. 574 (1983). See S. Rep. No. 103-111 at 5.\n\n                               10\n\fbroad a manner, that the court did not address the \"least\nrestrictive means\" prong. She contends that the government\ndid not meet its burden in this regard. We disagree.\n\nMindful of the comments of both the House and Senate,\nwhile we are not bound by the results in Lee and\nHernandez, we cannot help but be guided by their\nreasoning in determining whether the least restrictive\nmeans have been employed to further the government's\ncompelling interest. Viewing the requirements of RFRA\nthrough the helpful lens of pre-Smith case law, we conclude\nthat the nature of the compelling interest involved-- as\ncharacterized by the Supreme Court in Lee-- converts the\nleast restrictive means inquiry into a rhetorical question\nthat has been answered by the analysis in Lee. The least\nrestrictive means of furthering a compelling interest in the\ncollection of taxes -- a compelling interest that Adams has\nconceded -- is in fact, to implement that system in a\nuniform, mandatory way, with Congress determining in the\nfirst instance if exemptions are to built into the legislative\nscheme. The question of whether government could\nimplement a less restrictive means of income tax collection\nsurfaced in pre-Smith case law and was answered in the\nnegative based on the practical need of the government for\nuniform administration of taxation, given particularly\ndifficult problems with administration should exceptions on\nreligious grounds be carved out by the courts. See Lee, 455\nU.S. at 259-60. We acknowledge the sincerity of Adams's\nbeliefs, but as the Supreme Court noted in Lee, we can\neasily imagine a plethora of other sects that would also\nhave an equally legitimate concern with the usage of tax\ndollars to fund activities antithetical to their religion. See\n455 U.S. at 259. We also note that the same concerns with\nreligious pluralism that prompted the passage of RFRA\nhave also prompted past courts' reluctance to become\ninvolved in determining whether a claimant's beliefs are\n\"sincerely held,\" due to the multiplicity of beliefs in this\ncountry; these concerns also fortify our resistance to court-\ncreated exemptions to the income tax system. See Lee, 455\nU.S. at 259; Lull, 602 F.2d at 1168-69; cf. Kahn, 753 F.2d\nat 1214.\n\nOur approach to this particular form of tax challenge\nunder RFRA is consistent with that of the Ninth Circuit\n\n                                11\n\fCourt of Appeals, the only other circuit court to have\nwrestled with this issue in a similar factual context. In\nGoehring v. Brophy, a group of college students challenged\nthe collection of student fees under RFRA, as those fees\nsubsidized a health insurance plan that covered abortion\nservices. 94 F.3d 1294, 1297 (9th Cir. 1996), cert. denied,\n117 S. Ct. 1335 (1997), overruled by 117 S. Ct. 2157. In\nanalyzing the \"least restrictive means\" prong of the RFRA\ntest, the court analogized the challenge to university\nfunding to that of free exercise challenges to the\ngovernment's use of tax dollars. See id. at 1300. The court\nthen looked to Lee as its guide, and found that the fiscal\nvitality of the university fee system would be undermined if\nthe plaintiffs were exempted from paying their fees on free\nexercise grounds, as mandatory participation was\nnecessary to ensure the survival of the student health\ninsurance program. See id. The court also relied on the\nreasoning in Autenreith, a pre-Lee war tax protester case,\nas persuasive authority for its decision that mandatory\nstudent participation in a health insurance scheme was the\nleast restrictive means of accomplishing the University's\ngoals. 94 F.3d at 1301-02. We also find this reasoning\ninstructive:\n\n       The Income Tax Act does not `aid one religion, aid all\n       religions, or prefer one religion over another.' Not does\n       it punish anyone `for entertaining or professing\n       religious beliefs or disbeliefs' . . . . It taxes plaintiffs like\n       all others, because they are citizens or residents who\n       have taxable income. On matters religious, it is\n       neutral. If every citizen could refuse to pay all or part\n       of his taxes because he disapproved of the\n       government's use of the money, on religious grounds,\n       the ability of the government to function could be\n       impaired or even destroyed. . . . There are few, if any\n       governmental activities to which some person or group\n       might not object on religious grounds.\n\n       418 F.2d at 588-89, cited in 94 F.3d at 1301-02.\n\nIn another case decided by the Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit, Droz v. Commissioner, the appellant had\nchallenged the assessment of unpaid self-employment\nsocial security taxes under the free exercise clause,\n\n                               12\n\fclaiming that he had religious objections to the social\nsecurity system. 48 F.3d 1120, 1121 (9th Cir. 1995). The\ncourt determined that the RFRA test should be applied to\nhis claim, and then looked to Lee as the determinative case\nin analyzing his claim. See id. at 1123. The Droz court\ndenied his claim, noting that although compulsory\nparticipation in the social security system interfered with\nhis free exercise rights, allowing him to opt out of the\nsystem on religious grounds would threaten the stability of\nthe social security system by opening the door to myriad\nreligious exceptions. See id. at 1123-24; cf. Sherbert, 374\nU.S. at 408-09 (noting that administrative problems\nrendering a scheme unworkable could be the basis for\ndenial of religious accommodation).7\n\nAdams also argues that a later Congressional enactment\nof the exemption the Supreme Court refused to allow in Lee\ndemonstrates that the Commissioner can and should\naccommodate religion through a series of exemptions or\nalternative approaches to tax collection or at least should\nprove why such religiously-based exemptions are not\nfeasible. However, in making this argument, Adams\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. A number of RFRA cases arising in other factual contexts also\ndemonstrate a sensitivity to the influence of pre-RFRA case law on the\nanalysis of claims at hand. For example, in the context of RFRA\nchallenges to prison policies and regulations, courts found that they\nstill\nowe substantial deference to the judgment of prison administrators -- as\nwas the practice under prior case law in determining the interests being\nfurthered and means employed. See Lawson v. Singletary, 85 F.3d 502,\n512 (11th Cir. 1996), overruled by 117 S. Ct. 2157 (1997) (finding that\nthe \"least restrictive means\" prong of RFRA was coextensive with the\nSupreme Court's decision in Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396 (1974),\nin which the \"limitation of First Amendment freedoms must be no\ngreater than is necessary or essential to the protection of the particular\ngovernmental interest involved.\"); Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 476 (2d\nCir. 1996), overruled by 117 S. Ct. 2157 (1997) (stating in its analysis\nof\na challenge to TB regulations that its inquiry would occur \"against the\nbackdrop of prior decisions recognizing that courts are ill-equipped to\nsubstitute their judgments on matters of prison administration for those\nof prison authorities\"); Hamilton v. Schiro, 74 F.3d 1545, 1554 n.9 (8th\nCir. 1996), overruled by 117 S. Ct. 2157 (1997) (court looks to Supreme\nCourt precedent, RFRA's legislative history, and its own case law for\nguidance in interpreting RFRA).\n\n                               13\n\fmisconstrues the nature of the tax system itself. We do not\ndoubt that such legislative enactments can and do occur,\nbut tax exemptions are a matter of legislative grace, see\nLull, 602 F.2d at 1168, citing New Colonial Ice Co. v.\nHelvering, 292 U.S. 435 (1934). It does not follow from\nCongressional action on such matters that the\nCommissioner or the courts are therefore encouraged to\ncarve out exceptions to the statutory scheme.8\n\nAdams contends further that a finding against her is\ntantamount to exempting the IRS from RFRA altogether. We\ndisagree. She has contested the current system of income\ntax collection on the basis of her religious beliefs, and the\nresult this court reaches in evaluating her particular\nchallenge is dictated by prior case law. This finding does\nnot preclude the application of RFRA to the IRS in other\nfactual contexts. In sum, we find that the Tax Court\nengaged in an appropriate analysis of Adams's RFRA claim\nbased upon United States v. Lee, and that appellee was not\nrequired to produce evidence under the \"least restrictive\nmeans\" prong of RFRA in order to prevail.\n\nB. Liability for Penalties Assessed\n\nUnder 26 U.S.C. S 6651(a), if a taxpayer fails to file, a\npenalty will be added unless the taxpayer can demonstrate\n1) lack of willful neglect, and 2) reasonable cause. Willful\nneglect may be read as \"meaning a conscious, intentional\nfailure or reckless indifference.\" See United States v. Boyle,\n469 U.S. 241, 245 (1985). Under the case law and\nappropriate regulations, in order to demonstrate\n\"reasonable cause,\" a taxpayer must demonstrate that she\nexercised ordinary care and prudence but nevertheless was\nunable to file the return within the time allowed. 9 See id.;\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. The fact that Adams has suggested a number of alternative modes of\ntax collection for herself (religiously-based checkoffs on the tax forms,\nor\na separate non-military based fund for tax monies) is beside the point.\nAs Justice Blackmun noted, \"A judge would be unimaginative indeed if\nhe could not come up with something a little less`drastic' or a little\nless\n`restrictive' in almost any situation, and thereby enable himself to vote\nto\nstrike legislation down.\" Illinois State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist\nWorkers\nParty, 440 U.S. 173, 188-89 (1979) (concurring).\n\n9. A \"reasonable cause\" exception on the basis of religious opposition to\nwar is somewhat difficult to claim from the outset, due to the existence\n\f14\n\fSanderling, Inc. v. Commissioner, 571 F.2d 174, 178-79 (3d\nCir. 1978). Whether the elements that constitute\n\"reasonable cause\" are present in \"a given case is a\nquestion of fact, but what elements must be present to\nconstitute `reasonable cause' is a question of law.\" Boyle,\n469 U.S. at 249 n.8.\n\nAdams claims that Scott v. Commanding Officer, 431 F.2d\n1132, 1136 (3d Cir. 1970), a conscientious objector case,\nindicates that she was compelled by her beliefs not to file,\nand that as a result, she has demonstrated reasonable\ncause under the statute, because the beliefs inducing her\nnot to file her returns were so powerful that her actions\nwere beyond her control. In so claiming, she cites to\nlanguage in Scott stating that: \"beliefs of conscience are\nalways beyond one's control; one cannot sincerely turn his\nconscience on and off at will.\" 431 F.2d at 1136. Similarly,\nAdams claims that the waiver provision of section 6654(e)(3)\nfor \"unusual circumstances\" applies to her case, claiming\nthat her adherence to religious beliefs and subsequent\nrefusal to pay taxes -- the \"reasonable cause\" argument set\nforth above -- is a sufficiently unusual circumstance to\nnullify the penalty, despite the fact that it is somewhat rare\nfor a court to recognize a \"reasonable cause\" exception as\nan \"unusual circumstance\" that precludes a section 6654(a)\npenalty. See In re Carlson, 126 F.3d 915, 921 (7th Cir.\n1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 1388 (1998) (listing cases);\nWebster v. United States, 375 F.2d 814 (Ct. Cl. 1967)\n(finding a reasonable cause exception due to changes in tax\ncode and taxpayer's lack of information as rural landowner).10\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nof cases upholding the assessment of a \"frivolous return\" penalty under\n26 U.S.C. S 6702 against persons claiming \"war tax\" deductions or\nexemptions. See Nelson, 796 F.2d at 165-67 (addressing constitutionality\nof section 6702); Welch, 750 F.2d at 1108-09 (rejecting free exercise\nchallenge to section 6702); Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, S.\nRep. 97-494 (1982), 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 781, 1023-24 (discussing protest\nreturns, including \"war tax\" protest returns, as necessitating the\nenactment of section 6702).\n\n10. Adams also argues that the statutory scheme that permits penalties\nif the taxpayer demonstrates \"reasonable cause\" or \"unusual\ncircumstances\" has constitutional implications. She contends, relying on\n\n                               15\n\fWe find Adams's arguments appealing, but ultimately\nunconvincing. She has misconstrued Scott; the focus of the\ncourt's analysis in Scott was on the sincerity of the beliefs\nof the individual in question -- the sincerity of Adams's\nbeliefs is not in question. However, despite the sincerity of\nthose beliefs, her claim has returned this court to a well-\nestablished line of cases involving challenges to the\ncollection of taxes on religious grounds. Although Adams's\nbeliefs may be unusual as compared to the general\npopulation, the very body of case law relating to war tax\nprotesters indicates that in the realm of tax litigation, she\nis one of many. As a result, her \"compulsion\" argument\naffords her no excuse, as the prior plaintiffs were also\ncompelled by religious belief, but, like Adams, made the\ndifficult decision to act in a manner contrary to law.\nMoreover, Adams is asking this court to draw a distinction\nbetween holding sincerely felt political and religious beliefs\nand facing the consequences of those beliefs; we have been\nand continue to be reluctant to make such a distinction.\nWe have noted, in slightly different contexts, that plaintiffs\nengaging in civil disobedience through tax protests must\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nlanguage in Smith, that where a governmental entity has in place a\nsystem of \"individual exemptions,\" the failure to extend those exemptions\nto a case of religious hardship constitutes discrimination on the basis of\nreligious belief. 494 U.S. at 884. The \"reasonable cause\" exception,\naccording to Adams, is one such \"individual exemption,\" and therefore,\nthe assessment of a penalty against her when she has demonstrated\n\"reasonable cause\" is unconstitutional. The concept of \"individual\nexemptions\" in Smith is not the same as \"reasonable cause\" in the I.R.C.,\nand we have little difficulty finding that the imposition of penalties on\nAdams does not constitute discrimination on the basis of her religion.\nThe exemptions at issue here are uniform and facially neutral; the\nexemption at issue in Sherbert allowed for special protection for\nemployees opposed to working on Sundays, and allowed the Commission\nmaking the determination to take religious and personal beliefs into\naccount; here, the exemptions at issue are uniform and facially neutral.\nSee Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 401-03, 406-09. In terms of both statutory\ninterpretation and constitutional interpretation, Adams's definitions of\n\"reasonable cause\" and \"unusual circumstances\" are outside of the\nbounds of what these terms mean. See McMahan v. Commissioner, 114\nF.3d 366, 368-69 (2d Cir. 1997) (setting out parameters of reasonable\ncause exception).\n\n                               16\n\fpay the penalties incurred as a result of engaging in such\ndisobedience. See Kahn, 753 F.2d at 1215-16; cf.\nMalinowski, 472 F.2d at 855-58.\n\nWe will affirm the decision of the Tax Court.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                17\n\f",

Box 502\n       Washington, DC 20044\n        Attorneys for Appellee\n\nOPINION OF THE COURT\n\nRENDELL, Circuit Judge.\n\nPriscilla Adams claims that Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act (\"RFRA\") requires accommodation of her\nreligious beliefs so that her tax payments do not fund the\nmilitary. She also argues that RFRA and the free exercise\nclause mandate a finding that her religious beliefs\nconstitute \"reasonable cause\" under 26 U.S.C. S 6651 for\nher failure to file returns or pay tax and an\"unusual\ncircumstance\" which makes it \"against equity and good\nconscience\" for the Commissioner to impose the penalty for\nfailure to estimate under 26 U.S.C. S 6654.\n\nI. Factual and Procedural History\n\nThe facts are not in dispute. Adams is a devout Quaker;\nshe currently works as a \"Peace Field Secretary\" for the\nPhiladelphia Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of\nFriends. She sincerely believes that participation in war is\ncontrary to God's will, and hence, that the payment of taxes\nto fund the military is against the will of God. From 1985\nto 1989, Adams declared herself exempt from taxation, so\nno federal income tax would be withheld from her pay. In\n1989, the IRS sent a letter to her employer, the\nPhiladelphia Yearly Meeting, directing it to withhold taxes\nfrom her salary as if she were married and claiming one\nwithholding allowance.\n\nAdams has taken pains to ensure that she does not profit\nfrom her tax protests and to demonstrate that her beliefs\n\n                                2\n\fregarding refusal to pay taxes are sincere and are the result\nof being called or directed by God, in that she has been\ntested and challenged by \"clearness committees\" of\nmembers of her Meeting that have been convened to\nexamine her beliefs on this topic. They have determined\nthat the course of her conduct is the result of a\"leading\"\nfrom God. She asserts that she would voluntarily pay all of\nher federal income taxes if the money she paid were\ndirected to a fund that supported only non-military\nspending, or if her payments could be directed to non-\nmilitary expenditures, or that, with the consultation of a\nclearness committee, she would be willing to consider any\nother form of accommodation of her beliefs that could be\noffered by the government.\n\nThe Commissioner assessed deficiencies and penalties\nagainst Adams for the years 1988, 1989, 1992, 1993, and\n1994. The Tax Court determined that Adams was not\nexempt from the payment of taxes under RFRA and was\nliable for the deficiencies and penalties assessed against\nher, relying on United States v. Lee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110647\"><a href=\"/opinion/110647/united-states-v-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982),\nand other case law preceding Employment Division v.

Discussion\n\nA. RFRA Claim\n\nThe parties do not contest the constitutionality or the\napplicability of RFRA to the case at hand. They agree that\nRFRA applies to the federal government, as Boerne v.\nFlores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118140\"><a href=\"/opinion/118140/city-of-boerne-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2157</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997), held only that RFRA was\nunconstitutional as applied to the states under section 5 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. For the purposes of this\nappeal, we assume without deciding that RFRA is\n\n                                3\n\fconstitutional as applied to the federal government. See\nAlamo v.

She\nconcedes that the government has a compelling interest in\nthe collection of taxes, but contends that the IRS failed to\nmeet its burden under RFRA of proving that it could not\naccommodate her, that is, that there is no less restrictive\nmeans of furthering the government's interest. She argues\nthat this failure of proof requires this court to reverse the\nTax Court and find that Adams owes no taxes for the years\nin question, and that she is not required to pay income\ntaxes so long as the Commissioner does not act to\naccommodate her objections. Adams contends that she is\nnot asking to be exempted from the payment of taxes\naltogether, but that she wants her beliefs to be\n\"accommodated,\" because RFRA requires that the IRS\naccommodate her objection, unless the refusal to do so is\nthe \"least restrictive means\" for achieving the government's\ncompelling interest in tax collection. The Commissioner\naccepts Adams's acknowledgment that the government has\na compelling interest in the collection of taxes, and urges\nus to find that the current system -- uniform and\nmandatory in nature -- is the least restrictive means of\nfurthering that interest.\n\nThere is little doubt that RFRA was enacted as a direct\nresponse to Employment Division v. Smith, and to restore\nthe tests that were routinely employed before the Supreme\nCourt's ruling that neutral, generally applicable laws may\nimpinge on religious practices, even in the absence of a\ncompelling state interest. See 494 U.S. at 882-84; Boerne,\n117 S. Ct. at 2161. RFRA requires courts to employ the test\nset forth above in the statutory language. First, the\nclaimant must demonstrate a \"substantial burden\" on her\nexercise of her religious beliefs. If she does so, the burden\nshifts to the government to demonstrate that the regulation\nor practice at issue furthers a \"compelling interest,\" and\nthat it furthers that interest by the \"least restrictive\nmeans.\" See S 2000bb-1; Small v.

While\nprior cases touched on one or more of the aspects of the\nRFRA test, these elements -- substantial burden,\ncompelling interest, least restrictive means -- did not\nconstitute a comprehensive standard, let alone a uniform or\nestablished test, prior to Smith.3 The instant case presents\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3.

The legislative\nhistory of both the House and the Senate versions of RFRA\ncontain explicit indications that prior case law is central to\nthe understanding of the compelling interest test:\n\n       The committee wishes to stress that the act does not\n       express approval or disapproval of the result reached\n       in any particular court decision involving the free\n       exercise of religion, including those cited in the act\n       itself. This bill is not a codification of the result\n       reached in any prior free exercise decision but rather\n       the restoration of the legal standard that was applied\n       in those decisions. Therefore, the compelling interest\n       test generally should not be construed more stringently\n       or more leniently than it was prior to Smith.\n\n       S. Rep. No. 103-111 at 9; H.R. Rep.

The floor debates contain an extended \"colloquy\" between Senators\nGrassley and Hatch that occurred during the Judiciary Committee\nmarkup of the bill, which states in pertinent part:\n\nGrassley: Does this bill change the way courts assess a \"compelling state\ninterest\"? Will it still be up to the judge -- who will look at all the\nfacts\nin the case -- to say whether there is a compelling interest? In other\nwords, this bill does not purport to legislate a definition of compelling\ninterest, does it?\n\n                               7\n\fThe legislative history accompanying the Senate bill also\nincludes the following directive: \"The committee expects\nthat the courts will look to free exercise cases decided prior\nto Smith for guidance in determining whether the exercise\nof religion has been substantially burdened and the least\nrestrictive means have been employed in furthering a\ncompelling governmental interest.\" S. Rep. 103-111 at 8-9.5\nCases decided before Smith involving application of the\nstandards to the tax system, or to situations analogous to\nthe tax system are, therefore, instructive. In United States\nv. Lee, the Supreme Court rejected a free exercise challenge\nto the imposition of social security taxes based on the fact\nthat mandatory participation was necessary to the\nfunctioning of the social security program, and that a\nvoluntary system would be impossible to administer. See\n455 U.S. at 257-59. In so finding, the Court noted:\n\n       Religious beliefs can be accommodated, see, e.g.,\n       Thomas, supra; Sherbert, supra, but there is a point at\n       which accommodation would \"radically restrict the\n       operating latitude of the legislature.\" . . . Unlike the\n       situation presented in Wisconsin v. Yoder, supra, it\n       would be difficult to accommodate the comprehensive\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nHatch: RFRA reestablishes a very familiar and traditional standard of\nreview that the courts have been applying since the 1963 decision\nSherbert v. Verner. That is why we do not attempt to define the standard\nin the bill. This bill does not dictate the proper result in a particular\nfree\nexercise case nor does it identify specific governmental interests that\nare\ncompelling. The courts will continue to determine whether burdens on\nreligious exercise are justified, based upon a consideration and weighing\nof all relevant facts and circumstances. Historically, the courts have had\nlittle difficulty identifying important governmental interests. For\nexample,\nthe courts have found eradication of racial discrimination to be a\ncompelling governmental interest.\n\n139 Cong. Rec. S14461-01, S14470 (daily ed. Oct. 27, 1993).\n\n5. In enacting RFRA, Congress seized upon language from Supreme\nCourt opinions to create a statutory cause of action. In determining the\nbounds of Congressional intent in creating that statutory right we look\nto Congress's statements about pre-Smith case law as instructive for our\npurposes, namely, to \"say what the law is.\" Marbury v. Madison, 1\nCranch 137, 177 (1803).\n\n                               8\n\f       social security system with myriad exceptions flowing\n       from a wide variety of religious beliefs. The obligation\n       to pay the social security tax initially is not\n       fundamentally different from the obligation to pay\n       income taxes; the difference -- in theory at least-- is\n       that the social security tax revenues are segregated for\n       use only in furtherance of the statutory program. There\n       is no principled way, for purposes of this case, to\n       distinguish between general taxes and those imposed\n       under the Social Security Act. If, for example, a\n       religious adherent believes war is a sin, and if a certain\n       percentage of the federal budget can be identified as\n       devoted to war-related activities, such individuals\n       would have a similarly valid claim to be exempt from\n       paying that percentage of the income tax. The tax\n       system could not function if denominations were\n       allowed to challenge the tax system because tax\n       payments were spent in a manner that violates their\n       religious belief. . . . Because the broad public interest\n       in maintaining sound tax system is of such a high\n       order, religious belief in conflict with the payment of\n       taxes affords no basis for resisting the tax.\n\n       455 U.S. at 259-60.\n\nIn Hernandez, members of the Church of Scientology raised\nseveral challenges to the disallowance of claimed\nexemptions for the monies they had paid for spiritual\ntraining classes and sessions, including a free exercise\nchallenge. In upholding the disallowance of exemptions in\nthe face of their free exercise challenge, the Hernandez\ncourt relied on Lee:\n\n       [O]ur decision in Lee establishes that even a\n       substantial burden would be justified by the \"broad\n       public interest in maintaining a sound tax system,\"\n       free of \"myriad exceptions flowing from a wide variety\n       of religious beliefs.\" 455 U.S. at 260. . . . That these\n       cases involve federal income taxes, not the Social\n       Security system, is of no consequence. Ibid. The fact\n       that Congress has already crafted some deductions and\n       exemptions in the Code also is of no consequence, for\n       the guiding principle is that a tax \"must be uniformly\n\n                               9\n\f       applicable to all, except as Congress provides explicitly\n       otherwise.\" Id. at 261.\n\n       490 U.S. at 699 (emphasis added in original).\n\nLee and Hernandez are both part of a line of cases that\nhave refused to recognize free exercise challenges to the\npayment of taxes or penalties imposed due to a refusal to\npay taxes as a protest against the military activities of the\nUnited States.

Viewing the requirements of RFRA\nthrough the helpful lens of pre-Smith case law, we conclude\nthat the nature of the compelling interest involved-- as\ncharacterized by the Supreme Court in Lee-- converts the\nleast restrictive means inquiry into a rhetorical question\nthat has been answered by the analysis in Lee. The least\nrestrictive means of furthering a compelling interest in the\ncollection of taxes -- a compelling interest that Adams has\nconceded -- is in fact, to implement that system in a\nuniform, mandatory way, with Congress determining in the\nfirst instance if exemptions are to built into the legislative\nscheme. The question of whether government could\nimplement a less restrictive means of income tax collection\nsurfaced in pre-Smith case law and was answered in the\nnegative based on the practical need of the government for\nuniform administration of taxation, given particularly\ndifficult problems with administration should exceptions on\nreligious grounds be carved out by the courts. See Lee, 455\nU.S. at 259-60. We acknowledge the sincerity of Adams's\nbeliefs, but as the Supreme Court noted in Lee, we can\neasily imagine a plethora of other sects that would also\nhave an equally legitimate concern with the usage of tax\ndollars to fund activities antithetical to their religion. See\n455 U.S. at 259. We also note that the same concerns with\nreligious pluralism that prompted the passage of RFRA\nhave also prompted past courts' reluctance to become\ninvolved in determining whether a claimant's beliefs are\n\"sincerely held,\" due to the multiplicity of beliefs in this\ncountry; these concerns also fortify our resistance to court-\ncreated exemptions to the income tax system. See Lee, 455\nU.S. at 259; Lull, 602 F.2d at 1168-69; cf. Kahn, 753 F.2d\nat 1214.\n\nOur approach to this particular form of tax challenge\nunder RFRA is consistent with that of the Ninth Circuit\n\n                                11\n\fCourt of Appeals, the only other circuit court to have\nwrestled with this issue in a similar factual context. In\nGoehring v. Brophy, a group of college students challenged\nthe collection of student fees under RFRA, as those fees\nsubsidized a health insurance plan that covered abortion\nservices. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"725557\"><a href=\"/opinion/725557/gregory-p-goehring-david-mueller-john-p-gisla-jr-nancy-harder-glenn/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1297 (9th Cir. 1996), cert. denied,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In\nanalyzing the \"least restrictive means\" prong of the RFRA\ntest, the court analogized the challenge to university\nfunding to that of free exercise challenges to the\ngovernment's use of tax dollars. See id. at 1300. The court\nthen looked to Lee as its guide, and found that the fiscal\nvitality of the university fee system would be undermined if\nthe plaintiffs were exempted from paying their fees on free\nexercise grounds, as mandatory participation was\nnecessary to ensure the survival of the student health\ninsurance program. See id. The court also relied on the\nreasoning in Autenreith, a pre-Lee war tax protester case,\nas persuasive authority for its decision that mandatory\nstudent participation in a health insurance scheme was the\nleast restrictive means of accomplishing the University's\ngoals. 94 F.3d at 1301-02. We also find this reasoning\ninstructive:\n\n       The Income Tax Act does not `aid one religion, aid all\n       religions, or prefer one religion over another.' Not does\n       it punish anyone `for entertaining or professing\n       religious beliefs or disbeliefs' . . . . It taxes plaintiffs like\n       all others, because they are citizens or residents who\n       have taxable income. On matters religious, it is\n       neutral. If every citizen could refuse to pay all or part\n       of his taxes because he disapproved of the\n       government's use of the money, on religious grounds,\n       the ability of the government to function could be\n       impaired or even destroyed. . . . There are few, if any\n       governmental activities to which some person or group\n       might not object on religious grounds.\n\n       418 F.2d at 588-89, cited in 94 F.3d at 1301-02.\n\nIn another case decided by the Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit, Droz v. Commissioner, the appellant had\nchallenged the assessment of unpaid self-employment\nsocial security taxes under the free exercise clause,\n\n                               12\n\fclaiming that he had religious objections to the social\nsecurity system. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"690339\"><a href=\"/opinion/690339/martin-h-droz-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1120</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1121 (9th Cir. 1995). The\ncourt determined that the RFRA test should be applied to\nhis claim, and then looked to Lee as the determinative case\nin analyzing his claim. See id. at 1123. The Droz court\ndenied his claim, noting that although compulsory\nparticipation in the social security system interfered with\nhis free exercise rights, allowing him to opt out of the\nsystem on religious grounds would threaten the stability of\nthe social security system by opening the door to myriad\nreligious exceptions. See id. at 1123-24; cf. Sherbert, 374\nU.S. at 408-09 (noting that administrative problems\nrendering a scheme unworkable could be the basis for\ndenial of religious accommodation).7\n\nAdams also argues that a later Congressional enactment\nof the exemption the Supreme Court refused to allow in Lee\ndemonstrates that the Commissioner can and should\naccommodate religion through a series of exemptions or\nalternative approaches to tax collection or at least should\nprove why such religiously-based exemptions are not\nfeasible. However, in making this argument, Adams\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. A number of RFRA cases arising in other factual contexts also\ndemonstrate a sensitivity to the influence of pre-RFRA case law on the\nanalysis of claims at hand. For example, in the context of RFRA\nchallenges to prison policies and regulations, courts found that they\nstill\nowe substantial deference to the judgment of prison administrators -- as\nwas the practice under prior case law in determining the interests being\nfurthered and means employed.

It does not follow from\nCongressional action on such matters that the\nCommissioner or the courts are therefore encouraged to\ncarve out exceptions to the statutory scheme.8\n\nAdams contends further that a finding against her is\ntantamount to exempting the IRS from RFRA altogether. We\ndisagree. She has contested the current system of income\ntax collection on the basis of her religious beliefs, and the\nresult this court reaches in evaluating her particular\nchallenge is dictated by prior case law. This finding does\nnot preclude the application of RFRA to the IRS in other\nfactual contexts. In sum, we find that the Tax Court\nengaged in an appropriate analysis of Adams's RFRA claim\nbased upon United States v. Lee, and that appellee was not\nrequired to produce evidence under the \"least restrictive\nmeans\" prong of RFRA in order to prevail.\n\nB. Liability for Penalties Assessed\n\nUnder 26 U.S.C. S 6651(a), if a taxpayer fails to file, a\npenalty will be added unless the taxpayer can demonstrate\n1) lack of willful neglect, and 2) reasonable cause.

The fact that Adams has suggested a number of alternative modes of\ntax collection for herself (religiously-based checkoffs on the tax forms,\nor\na separate non-military based fund for tax monies) is beside the point.\nAs Justice Blackmun noted, \"A judge would be unimaginative indeed if\nhe could not come up with something a little less`drastic' or a little\nless\n`restrictive' in almost any situation, and thereby enable himself to vote\nto\nstrike legislation down.\" Illinois State Bd. of Elections v.

In so claiming, she cites to\nlanguage in Scott stating that: \"beliefs of conscience are\nalways beyond one's control; one cannot sincerely turn his\nconscience on and off at will.\" 431 F.2d at 1136. Similarly,\nAdams claims that the waiver provision of section 6654(e)(3)\nfor \"unusual circumstances\" applies to her case, claiming\nthat her adherence to religious beliefs and subsequent\nrefusal to pay taxes -- the \"reasonable cause\" argument set\nforth above -- is a sufficiently unusual circumstance to\nnullify the penalty, despite the fact that it is somewhat rare\nfor a court to recognize a \"reasonable cause\" exception as\nan \"unusual circumstance\" that precludes a section 6654(a)\npenalty.

Adams also argues that the statutory scheme that permits penalties\nif the taxpayer demonstrates \"reasonable cause\" or \"unusual\ncircumstances\" has constitutional implications. She contends, relying on\n\n                               15\n\fWe find Adams's arguments appealing, but ultimately\nunconvincing. She has misconstrued Scott; the focus of the\ncourt's analysis in Scott was on the sincerity of the beliefs\nof the individual in question -- the sincerity of Adams's\nbeliefs is not in question. However, despite the sincerity of\nthose beliefs, her claim has returned this court to a well-\nestablished line of cases involving challenges to the\ncollection of taxes on religious grounds. Although Adams's\nbeliefs may be unusual as compared to the general\npopulation, the very body of case law relating to war tax\nprotesters indicates that in the realm of tax litigation, she\nis one of many. As a result, her \"compulsion\" argument\naffords her no excuse, as the prior plaintiffs were also\ncompelled by religious belief, but, like Adams, made the\ndifficult decision to act in a manner contrary to law.\nMoreover, Adams is asking this court to draw a distinction\nbetween holding sincerely felt political and religious beliefs\nand facing the consequences of those beliefs; we have been\nand continue to be reluctant to make such a distinction.\nWe have noted, in slightly different contexts, that plaintiffs\nengaging in civil disobedience through tax protests must\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nlanguage in Smith, that where a governmental entity has in place a\nsystem of \"individual exemptions,\" the failure to extend those exemptions\nto a case of religious hardship constitutes discrimination on the basis of\nreligious belief. 494 U.S. at 884. The \"reasonable cause\" exception,\naccording to Adams, is one such \"individual exemption,\" and therefore,\nthe assessment of a penalty against her when she has demonstrated\n\"reasonable cause\" is unconstitutional. The concept of \"individual\nexemptions\" in Smith is not the same as \"reasonable cause\" in the I.R.C.,\nand we have little difficulty finding that the imposition of penalties on\nAdams does not constitute discrimination on the basis of her religion.\nThe exemptions at issue here are uniform and facially neutral; the\nexemption at issue in Sherbert allowed for special protection for\nemployees opposed to working on Sundays, and allowed the Commission\nmaking the determination to take religious and personal beliefs into\naccount; here, the exemptions at issue are uniform and facially neutral.\nSee Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 401-03, 406-09. In terms of both statutory\ninterpretation and constitutional interpretation, Adams's definitions of\n\"reasonable cause\" and \"unusual circumstances\" are outside of the\nbounds of what these terms mean.
