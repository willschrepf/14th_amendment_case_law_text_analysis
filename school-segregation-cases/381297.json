GOODMAN, JUDGE:</p></div>\r\n<p>¶1 Glendell Gaskins (Gaskins) appeals the trial court's November 19, 2012, \r\norder dismissing his declaratory judgment action against Texon, LP (Texon), \r\nafter finding Gaskins failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted \r\nunder the Oklahoma Production Revenue Standards Act, 52 O.S.2011, § 570.1 <i>et seq</i>. \r\nThe appeal was assigned to the accelerated docket pursuant to Oklahoma Supreme \r\nCourt Rule 1.36(a)(2), 12 O.S.2011, Ch. 15, App. 1.<sup>1</sup> Based upon our review of the facts and \r\napplicable law, we affirm.</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>\r\n<p>¶2 Gaskins sought a declaratory judgment against Texon determining that Texon \r\nwas liable under the Oklahoma Production Revenue Standards Act (PRSA), 52 O.S.2011, § 570.1 <i>et seq</i>. \r\nGaskins asserts § 570.10(A) creates a statutory duty for Texon to hold all \r\nrevenue or proceeds from the purchase of oil and gas in trust for the benefit of \r\nthe legal owners.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n<p>¶3 Gaskins asserted he sold 642 barrels of oil from wells located in Creek \r\nCounty, Oklahoma, to SemCrude in June and July of 2008, and that this oil was \r\ninjected into SemCrude's pipeline system at the Midway and Derrisaw stations \r\nwhere it was transported for sale in Cushing, Oklahoma.<sup>3</sup> Gaskins further asserted his oil was \r\ncommingled in the pipeline with oil produced and purchased from other wells and \r\neventually sold to several downstream purchasers, including Texon, who purchased \r\n1,650 barrels of oil in June and 1,085 barrels in July, 2008. Gaskins asserted \r\nSemCrude filed bankruptcy on July 22, 2008, and that it failed to pay him \r\napproximately $62,000.00 for his oil. Gaskins contends Texon has proceeds from \r\nthe sale of oil by SemCrude to Texon, which includes proceeds from the sale of \r\nhis commingled oil.</p>\r\n<p>¶4 Texon filed an answer, pleading, <i>inter alia</i>, the affirmative \r\ndefense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Gaskins \r\nfiled a motion for summary judgment on September 5, 2012. On September 20, 2012, \r\nTexon's counsel filed an affidavit averring discovery was necessary before it \r\ncould respond. The court granted an extension of time. Gaskins subsequently \r\nfiled an application for hearing pursuant to 12 O.S.2011, § 2012(C) on Texon's \r\naffirmative defense; the court granted the application over Texon's \r\nobjection.</p>\r\n<p>¶5 A hearing was held on November 19, 2012, on Texon's affirmative defense. \r\nBy order filed on November 19, 2012, the court held the PRSA did not apply to \r\nGaskins' sale of oil to SemCrude and Texon's subsequent purchase of Gaskins' oil \r\nfrom SemCrude. The court found Gaskins failed to state a claim for which relief \r\ncould be granted under the PRSA and that the defect in the second amended \r\npetition could not be remedied by amendment. The court dismissed Gaskins' \r\npetition for declaratory judgment. Gaskins' appeals.</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><b>STANDARD OF REVIEW</b></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <p>[] This court reviews the dismissal <i>de novo</i> considering the legal \r\n    sufficiency of the petition and taking all allegations in the plaintiff's \r\n    petition as true. The function of a motion to dismiss is to test the law of \r\n    the claims, not the facts supporting them. No dismissal for failure to state \r\n    a claim upon which relief may be granted should be allowed unless it appears \r\n    beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the \r\n    claim which would entitle relief. Plaintiffs need neither identify a \r\n    specific theory of recovery nor set out the correct remedy or relief to \r\n    which they may be entitled. If any set of facts can be established which is \r\n    consistent with the allegations, a motion to dismiss should be denied. \r\n    Dismissal is appropriate only for lack of any cognizable legal theory to \r\n    support the claim or for insufficient facts under a cognizable theory. Where \r\n    not all claims appear to be frivolous on their face or without merit, \r\n    dismissals for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted are \r\n    premature. The movant bears the substantial burden of demonstrating any \r\n    insufficiency. . . .</p></blockquote></blockquote>\r\n<p><i>Gens v. Casady Sch.</i>, 2008 \r\nOK 5, ¶ 8, 177 P.3d 565, \r\n568-69 (footnotes omitted).</p>\r\n<p>¶6 Furthermore, the issue presented is one of statutory interpretation and \r\ntherefore presents a question of law which is subject to <i>de novo</i> review. \r\n<i>Williams v. Smith &amp; Nephew, Inc.</i>, 2009 OK 36, ¶ 8, 212 P.3d 484, 486. An appellate \r\ncourt exercises plenary, independent, and non-deferential authority when \r\nreexamining legal rulings. <i>Barnes v. Oklahoma Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co.</i>, \r\n2000 OK 55, ¶ 4, 11 P.3d 162, 166.</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>\r\n<p>¶7 This case involves the legal scope and effect of 52 O.S.2011, § 570.10(A) of the \r\nPRSA. Section § 570.10(A) provides:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <p>All proceeds from the sale of production shall be regarded as separate \r\n    and distinct from all other funds of any person receiving or holding the \r\n    same until such time as such proceeds are paid to the owners legally \r\n    entitled thereto. Any person holding revenue or proceeds from the sale of \r\n    production shall hold such revenue or proceeds for the benefit of the owners \r\n    legally entitled thereto. Nothing in this subsection shall create an express \r\n    trust.</p></blockquote></blockquote>\r\n<p>¶8 Gaskins contends § 570.10(A) creates a statutory duty on Texon to hold \r\nrevenue or proceeds from the purchase of oil and gas in trust for the benefit of \r\nthe legal owners.<sup>4</sup> Gaskins contends the PRSA uses language typically \r\nassociated with trusts to separate equitable title to the revenue or proceeds \r\nfrom legal title: \"any person\" holding either revenue or proceeds from the sale \r\nof oil or gas \"[s]hall hold such revenue or proceeds for the benefit of the \r\nowners.\" and \"[a]ll proceeds . shall be regarded as separate and distinct from \r\nall other funds. .\"</p>\r\n<p>¶9 Texon disagrees with Gaskins' interpretation of § 570.10(A), asserting the \r\nPRSA regulates how interest owners and local operators (or their proxies) work \r\ntogether at the wellhead and serves to hold operators accountable to their \r\ninterest owners. Texon maintains the PRSA does not state or even suggest that it \r\ncreates any duty or applies to downstream purchasers of oil and gas after it \r\nreaches the stream of interstate commerce. Thus, because the PRSA is intended to \r\nregulate only dispositions at the well, \"person\" in § 570.10(A) cannot be read \r\nto apply to a downstream purchaser that does not receive the \"proceeds\" of the \r\nsale at the well. Finally, Texon contends nothing in the language of § 570.10(A) \r\ncreates or suggests a trust. Rather, it expressly disclaims a trust and creates \r\na debtor-creditor commercial relationship.</p>\r\n<p>¶10 In the present case, we find the language of § 570.10(A) to be clear and \r\nunambiguous. Thus, the issue is whether § 570.10(A) creates a duty on a \r\ndownstream purchaser such as Texon to hold revenue or proceeds in an implied \r\ntrust for the benefit of the legal owner. No Oklahoma court has recognized such \r\na duty or implied trust pursuant to § 570.10(A) of the PRSA.</p>\r\n<p>¶11 Gaskins relies on a 2008 Oklahoma Attorney General opinion wherein the \r\nAttorney General opined § 570.10(A) embodies trust concepts and creates an \r\nimplied trust.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <p>The language of Section 570.10(A) clearly supports the imposition of a \r\n    resulting trust by which the holder of the proceeds of production is the \r\n    resulting trustee that holds those proceeds for the resulting beneficiaries; \r\n    <i>i.e.</i>, the persons legally entitled to them. However, further analysis \r\n    reveals that Section 570.10(A) also imposes a constructive trust on such \r\n    proceeds. The primary reason for imposing a constructive trust is to avoid \r\n    unjust enrichment.</p>\r\n    <p>.</p>\r\n    <p>Additionally, not enforcing Section 570.10(A) through the imposition of a \r\n    constructive trust would promote unjust enrichment. It would give the holder \r\n    of the revenue or proceeds both legal and beneficial title to and use of \r\n    property of others not only in violation of law, but also for which the \r\n    holder had not paid. Thus, the holder of those proceeds would obtain legal \r\n    and beneficial title to the property of others in violation of State law and \r\n    at the actual expense of those who sold presumptively in reliance on the \r\n    State law. Consequently, if Section 570.10(A) were found not to create a \r\n    resulting trust, Section 570.10(A) would impose a constructive trust on the \r\n    holder of such funds.<br>.</p>\r\n    <p>The Legislature intended an implied trust (whether resulting or \r\n    constructive) under the provisions of Section 570.10(A) of Title 52. See \r\n    <i>Cacy v. Cacy</i>, 619 P.2d. 200, 202 (Okla. 1980); <i>Littlefield v. \r\n    Roberts</i>, 448 P.2d 851, \r\n    856 (Okla. 1968); <i>Bryant v. Mahan</i>, 264 P. 811, 812 (Okla. 1927). \r\n    Furthermore, the holder of the revenue or proceeds of oil and gas production \r\n    is an implied trustee who has no rights in or to such revenue or proceeds \r\n    and who is under a statutory duty to pay the revenue or proceeds of oil and \r\n    gas production to the implied beneficiaries; <i>i.e.</i>, the owners legally \r\n    entitled thereto. The holder of the revenue or proceeds of oil and gas \r\n    production acquires no right, title or interest in such revenue or \r\n    proceeds.</p></blockquote></blockquote>\r\n<p>¶12 Attorney General opinions are persuasive authority and silence by the \r\nLegislature may be interpreted as acquiescence. <i>Tulsa Cty. Publ. Facility \r\nAuth. v. State ex rel. O.T.C.</i>, 1998 OK CIV APP 12, ¶ 9, 955 P.2d 741, 743 (citing <i>The \r\nNational Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Herit. Ctr. v. State ex rel. Oklahoma \r\nHuman Rights Comm'n,</i> 1978 OK \r\n76, 579 P.2d 1276).</p>\r\n<p>¶13 Upon reviewing the plain language of § 570.10(A), we agree with Texon \r\nthat nothing in the language of § 570.10(A) creates or suggests a duty on a \r\ndownstream purchaser or applies to downstream purchasers of oil and gas after it \r\nreaches the stream of interstate commerce. Moreover, there is nothing in that \r\nlanguage requiring the imposition of an implied trust.<sup>5</sup> We find <i>In re SemCrude, L.P. \r\n(Samson Res. Co. v. SemCrude, L.P., et al.)</i>, 407 B.R. 140 (D.Del. 2009), \r\npersuasive. After entering bankruptcy, SemCrude failed to pay producers and \r\nowners from various states for oil and gas produced between June 1, 2008, and \r\nthe date of bankruptcy. Oklahoma producers filed adversary proceedings in the \r\nDelaware Bankruptcy Court to obtain declaratory judgments establishing what \r\nrights, if any, were afforded by Oklahoma law and their priority relative to \r\nother security interests.<sup>6</sup> More specifically, the producers asserted § \r\n570.10(A) created an implied trust over oil and gas revenue and proceeds for the \r\nbenefit of Oklahoma producers. They further asserted the Oil and Gas Owners' \r\nLien Act of 1988 gave them priority over competing claims. <i>See</i> 52 O.S.2001, § 548 <i>et seq.</i> \r\n(repealed by Laws 2010, SB 1615, c. 142, § 13, emerg. eff. April 19, 2010).</p>\r\n<p>¶14 Interpreting Oklahoma law, the bankruptcy court disagreed, concluding the \r\nPRSA does not impose an implied trust in favor of the producers, stating:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <p>The requisite intent for creating a resulting trust under Oklahoma law \r\n    must be clear, decisive, and unequivocal. <i>Estate of Ingram,</i> 874 P.2d \r\n    [1282] at 1287. Here, the Court concludes that § 570.10(A) of the PRSA does \r\n    not create a resulting trust because the intent to create one is simply not \r\n    provided by the plain words of the statute.</p>\r\n    <p>.</p>\r\n    <p>Read in its entirety, the PRSA provides a comprehensive regulatory \r\n    structure governing how interest owners and operators work together at the \r\n    wellhead, and serves to hold operators accountable to their interest \r\n    owners.</p>\r\n    <p>.</p>\r\n    <p>Because the PRSA requires operators to pay interest to owners at \r\n    specified rates and otherwise has common commercial terms and conditions \r\n    throughout, the Court finds that the statute concerns a debtor-creditor \r\n    relationship and does not impose a trust \r\nrelationship.</p></blockquote></blockquote>\r\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 153-54. The court found that unlike situations where a statute \r\nis clear that the intent is for the trustee to hold funds for the benefit of \r\nbeneficiaries, the PRSA does not identify a trustee, actually require \r\nsegregation of trust proceeds, or otherwise impose rights or duties typically \r\nassociated with a trustee/beneficiary relationship. <i>Id.</i> at 152. The court \r\nconcluded § 570.10(A) must be read in context with other provisions of the PRSA, \r\nwhich reading supports the conclusion the PRSA is a regulatory scheme for how \r\noperators and owners will interact with regard to the well. See also <i>McKnight \r\nv. Linn Operating, Inc.</i>, 2010 WL 9039794 (W.D. Okla. Apr. 1, 2010) and \r\n<i>Naylor Farms, Inc. v. Anadarko OGC Co., et al.</i>, 2011 WL 7267853 (W.D. \r\nOkla. June 23, 2011) agreeing with the analysis in <i>In re SemCrude</i> that § \r\n570.10(A) does not create an implied trust and disagreeing with the Oklahoma \r\nAttorney General's opinion.</p>\r\n<p>¶15 Moreover, the Oil and Gas Owners' Lien Act of 1988 provided a procedure \r\nfor Gaskins to secure a lien on the proceeds from the sale of his oil and gas. \r\n<i>See</i> 52 O.S.2001, § 548 \r\n<i>et seq.</i> (repealed by Laws 2010, SB 1615, c. 142, § 13, emerg. eff. April \r\n19, 2010). In <i>In re SemCrude</i>, the bankruptcy court held the existence of \r\nthis Act further supported its conclusion that the PRSA did not create a \r\ntrust.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <p>The existence of these lien rights bears upon, and supports, the Court's \r\n    earlier construction of the PRSA. The Lien Act predates enactment of the \r\n    PRSA, and was not repealed upon enactment of the PRSA. The Oklahoma \r\n    Producers' contention that the PRSA imposes a trust for their benefit upon \r\n    production and proceeds is belied by the continued vitality of the rights \r\n    afforded under the Lien Act, as it is axiomatic that a party cannot hold a \r\n    lien in its own property.</p></blockquote></blockquote>\r\n<p><i>In re SemCrude, L.P.</i>,<i> </i>407 B.R. at 157 fn. 10.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n<p>¶16 In response to the <i>In re SemCrude, L.P.</i> decision, the Oklahoma \r\nLegislature repealed the existing Lien Act of 1988 and enacted the Oil and Gas \r\nOwners' Lien Act of 2010 (\"Lien Act\"). <i>See</i> 52 O.S.2011, § 549.1 <i>et \r\nseq.</i>, Cmt. 10 (The 2010 Act was \"designed to remedy some of the deficiencies \r\nperceived to be present in the Prior Act as well as to address some of the \r\nissues that emerged in the SemGroup litigation.\") The purpose of the statute was \r\nto give Oklahoma producers and royalty owners a first-priority lien to secure \r\npayment for their interest in oil and gas sold to a first purchaser. The new \r\nlien attaches to oil and gas before extraction and follows the oil and gas upon \r\nseverance. It also attaches to the proceeds of sale. The Lien Act strengthens \r\nthe rights of Oklahoma interests owners in three (3) ways: 1) Oklahoma oil and \r\ngas interests are now governed by real property law, which designates the \r\napplicable law by the state in which the wellhead is located; (2) Oklahoma \r\ninterest owners can now obtain a lien that will remain attached until a first \r\npurchaser has paid in full the purchase price of produced oil; and (3) the Lien \r\nAct explicitly and unbendingly grants superior priority to Oklahoma interest \r\nowners above all other lienholders and U.C.C. Article 9 secured creditors. \r\n<i>See</i> <i>There's A New Act in Town: How the Oklahoma Oil and Gas Owners' \r\nLien Act of 2010 Strengthens the Position of Oklahoma Interest Owner</i>s, 65 \r\nOkla. L. Rev. 133 (2012). Title 52 \r\nO.S.2011, § 549.6 allows a downstream purchaser to take free of the \r\nstatutory lien only under certain conditions.</p>\r\n<p>¶17 We agree with the bankruptcy court that the PRSA is a regulatory scheme \r\nfor how operators and owners will interact with regard to the well. In addition, \r\n§ 570.10(A) specifically provides it applies only to the revenue or proceeds \r\nfrom the sale of production, <i>i.e.</i>, the oil and gas and other minerals \r\nthat the lessee extracts from the ground at the wellhead. Section 570.10(A) does \r\nnot specifically apply to downstream purchasers. Accordingly, we reject Gaskins' \r\nassertion that the PRSA applies to Texon's subsequent purchase of oil and gas \r\nfrom SemCrude.</p>\r\n<p>¶18 Gaskins further asserts Texon will be unjustly enriched if it is not \r\nrequired to pay the proceeds from the sale of his oil and gas. A review of the \r\nrecord on appeal reveals, however, that Gaskins did not assert an unjust \r\nenrichment claim against Texon in this case nor was this issue raised to the \r\ntrial court below. Rather, Gaskins merely sought a declaratory judgment that the \r\nPRSA applies to Texon. Therefore, this assertion of error is denied.</p>\r\n<p>¶19 Accordingly, the trial court properly dismissed Gaskins' declaratory \r\njudgment action against Texon for failure to state a claim for which relief can \r\nbe granted under the PRSA. The court's November 19, 2012, order is therefore \r\naffirmed.</p>\r\n<div class=\"de-action-clause\">\r\n<p>¶20 <b>AFFIRMED.</b></p></div>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<div class=\"de-vote\">\r\n<p>THORNBRUGH, P.J., and RAPP, J., concur.</p></div>\r\n<div class=\"fn-container\">\r\n<p align=\"center\"><b>FOOTNOTES</b></p>\r\n<div class=\"fn-footnote\">\r\n<p><sup>1</sup> Texon's \r\nmotion for leave to file appellate briefing was granted on February 6, \r\n2013.</p></div>\r\n<div class=\"fn-footnote\">\r\n<p><sup>2</sup> Gaskins \r\noriginally filed suit against CP Energy, LLC, on February 28, 2012.

Gaskins states the PRSA was a major legal reform for the oil and gas \r\nindustry, creating fourteen new sections of law and amending one existing \r\nsection, 52 O.S.1991, § 540, \r\nwhich did not provide for duties, responsibilities, or a standard of care but \r\nmerely set time limits for oil and gas proceeds to be paid. In addition, he \r\ncontends 52 O.S.2011, §§ 570.10 \r\nand 570.14 are remedial statutes that create a new liability and an action to \r\nenforce it where none previously existed in the common law and they should be \r\naccorded liberal construction to encourage development of Oklahoma's natural \r\nresources and protection of owners of produced oil and gas. Gaskins contends he \r\nretained beneficial title or interest in the proceeds and that Texon is a mere \r\nholder of the proceeds. Gaskins further cites to the legislative history of the \r\nPRSA, including major changes to the PRSA in 1992.</p></div>\r\n<div class=\"fn-footnote\">\r\n<p><sup>5</sup> Implied \r\ntrusts are equitable remedies which arise entirely by implication of law and are \r\neither constructive or resulting trusts.

Gaskins asserted \r\nSemCrude filed bankruptcy on July 22, 2008, and that it failed to pay him \r\napproximately $62,000.00 for his oil. Gaskins contends Texon has proceeds from \r\nthe sale of oil by SemCrude to Texon, which includes proceeds from the sale of \r\nhis commingled oil.</p>\r\n<p>¶4 Texon filed an answer, pleading, <i>inter alia</i>, the affirmative \r\ndefense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Gaskins \r\nfiled a motion for summary judgment on September 5, 2012. On September 20, 2012, \r\nTexon's counsel filed an affidavit averring discovery was necessary before it \r\ncould respond. The court granted an extension of time. Gaskins subsequently \r\nfiled an application for hearing pursuant to 12 O.S.2011, § 2012(C) on Texon's \r\naffirmative defense; the court granted the application over Texon's \r\nobjection.</p>\r\n<p>¶5 A hearing was held on November 19, 2012, on Texon's affirmative defense. \r\nBy order filed on November 19, 2012, the court held the PRSA did not apply to \r\nGaskins' sale of oil to SemCrude and Texon's subsequent purchase of Gaskins' oil \r\nfrom SemCrude. The court found Gaskins failed to state a claim for which relief \r\ncould be granted under the PRSA and that the defect in the second amended \r\npetition could not be remedied by amendment. The court dismissed Gaskins' \r\npetition for declaratory judgment. Gaskins' appeals.</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><b>STANDARD OF REVIEW</b></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <p>[] This court reviews the dismissal <i>de novo</i> considering the legal \r\n    sufficiency of the petition and taking all allegations in the plaintiff's \r\n    petition as true. The function of a motion to dismiss is to test the law of \r\n    the claims, not the facts supporting them. No dismissal for failure to state \r\n    a claim upon which relief may be granted should be allowed unless it appears \r\n    beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the \r\n    claim which would entitle relief. Plaintiffs need neither identify a \r\n    specific theory of recovery nor set out the correct remedy or relief to \r\n    which they may be entitled. If any set of facts can be established which is \r\n    consistent with the allegations, a motion to dismiss should be denied. \r\n    Dismissal is appropriate only for lack of any cognizable legal theory to \r\n    support the claim or for insufficient facts under a cognizable theory. Where \r\n    not all claims appear to be frivolous on their face or without merit, \r\n    dismissals for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted are \r\n    premature. The movant bears the substantial burden of demonstrating any \r\n    insufficiency. . . .</p></blockquote></blockquote>\r\n<p><i>Gens v.

Section § 570.10(A) provides:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <p>All proceeds from the sale of production shall be regarded as separate \r\n    and distinct from all other funds of any person receiving or holding the \r\n    same until such time as such proceeds are paid to the owners legally \r\n    entitled thereto. Any person holding revenue or proceeds from the sale of \r\n    production shall hold such revenue or proceeds for the benefit of the owners \r\n    legally entitled thereto. Nothing in this subsection shall create an express \r\n    trust.</p></blockquote></blockquote>\r\n<p>¶8 Gaskins contends § 570.10(A) creates a statutory duty on Texon to hold \r\nrevenue or proceeds from the purchase of oil and gas in trust for the benefit of \r\nthe legal owners.<sup>4</sup> Gaskins contends the PRSA uses language typically \r\nassociated with trusts to separate equitable title to the revenue or proceeds \r\nfrom legal title: \"any person\" holding either revenue or proceeds from the sale \r\nof oil or gas \"[s]hall hold such revenue or proceeds for the benefit of the \r\nowners.\" and \"[a]ll proceeds . shall be regarded as separate and distinct from \r\nall other funds. .\"</p>\r\n<p>¶9 Texon disagrees with Gaskins' interpretation of § 570.10(A), asserting the \r\nPRSA regulates how interest owners and local operators (or their proxies) work \r\ntogether at the wellhead and serves to hold operators accountable to their \r\ninterest owners. Texon maintains the PRSA does not state or even suggest that it \r\ncreates any duty or applies to downstream purchasers of oil and gas after it \r\nreaches the stream of interstate commerce. Thus, because the PRSA is intended to \r\nregulate only dispositions at the well, \"person\" in § 570.10(A) cannot be read \r\nto apply to a downstream purchaser that does not receive the \"proceeds\" of the \r\nsale at the well. Finally, Texon contends nothing in the language of § 570.10(A) \r\ncreates or suggests a trust. Rather, it expressly disclaims a trust and creates \r\na debtor-creditor commercial relationship.</p>\r\n<p>¶10 In the present case, we find the language of § 570.10(A) to be clear and \r\nunambiguous. Thus, the issue is whether § 570.10(A) creates a duty on a \r\ndownstream purchaser such as Texon to hold revenue or proceeds in an implied \r\ntrust for the benefit of the legal owner. No Oklahoma court has recognized such \r\na duty or implied trust pursuant to § 570.10(A) of the PRSA.</p>\r\n<p>¶11 Gaskins relies on a 2008 Oklahoma Attorney General opinion wherein the \r\nAttorney General opined § 570.10(A) embodies trust concepts and creates an \r\nimplied trust.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <p>The language of Section 570.10(A) clearly supports the imposition of a \r\n    resulting trust by which the holder of the proceeds of production is the \r\n    resulting trustee that holds those proceeds for the resulting beneficiaries; \r\n    <i>i.e.</i>, the persons legally entitled to them. However, further analysis \r\n    reveals that Section 570.10(A) also imposes a constructive trust on such \r\n    proceeds. The primary reason for imposing a constructive trust is to avoid \r\n    unjust enrichment.</p>\r\n    <p>.</p>\r\n    <p>Additionally, not enforcing Section 570.10(A) through the imposition of a \r\n    constructive trust would promote unjust enrichment. It would give the holder \r\n    of the revenue or proceeds both legal and beneficial title to and use of \r\n    property of others not only in violation of law, but also for which the \r\n    holder had not paid. Thus, the holder of those proceeds would obtain legal \r\n    and beneficial title to the property of others in violation of State law and \r\n    at the actual expense of those who sold presumptively in reliance on the \r\n    State law. Consequently, if Section 570.10(A) were found not to create a \r\n    resulting trust, Section 570.10(A) would impose a constructive trust on the \r\n    holder of such funds.<br>.</p>\r\n    <p>The Legislature intended an implied trust (whether resulting or \r\n    constructive) under the provisions of Section 570.10(A) of Title 52. See \r\n    <i>Cacy v. Cacy</i>, 619 P.2d. 200, 202 (Okla. 1980); <i>Littlefield v. \r\n    Roberts</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1171242\"><a href=\"/opinion/1171242/littlefield-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">851</span></a></span>, \r\n    856 (Okla. 1968); <i>Bryant v.

Moreover, there is nothing in that \r\nlanguage requiring the imposition of an implied trust.<sup>5</sup> We find <i>In re SemCrude, L.P. \r\n(Samson Res. Co. v. SemCrude, L.P., et al.)</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></span> (D.Del. 2009), \r\npersuasive. After entering bankruptcy, SemCrude failed to pay producers and \r\nowners from various states for oil and gas produced between June 1, 2008, and \r\nthe date of bankruptcy. Oklahoma producers filed adversary proceedings in the \r\nDelaware Bankruptcy Court to obtain declaratory judgments establishing what \r\nrights, if any, were afforded by Oklahoma law and their priority relative to \r\nother security interests.<sup>6</sup> More specifically, the producers asserted § \r\n570.10(A) created an implied trust over oil and gas revenue and proceeds for the \r\nbenefit of Oklahoma producers. They further asserted the Oil and Gas Owners' \r\nLien Act of 1988 gave them priority over competing claims. <i>See</i> 52 O.S.2001, § 548 <i>et seq.</i> \r\n(repealed by Laws 2010, SB 1615, c. 142, § 13, emerg. eff. April 19, 2010).</p>\r\n<p>¶14 Interpreting Oklahoma law, the bankruptcy court disagreed, concluding the \r\nPRSA does not impose an implied trust in favor of the producers, stating:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <p>The requisite intent for creating a resulting trust under Oklahoma law \r\n    must be clear, decisive, and unequivocal. <i>Estate of Ingram,</i> 874 P.2d \r\n    [1282] at 1287. Here, the Court concludes that § 570.10(A) of the PRSA does \r\n    not create a resulting trust because the intent to create one is simply not \r\n    provided by the plain words of the statute.</p>\r\n    <p>.</p>\r\n    <p>Read in its entirety, the PRSA provides a comprehensive regulatory \r\n    structure governing how interest owners and operators work together at the \r\n    wellhead, and serves to hold operators accountable to their interest \r\n    owners.</p>\r\n    <p>.</p>\r\n    <p>Because the PRSA requires operators to pay interest to owners at \r\n    specified rates and otherwise has common commercial terms and conditions \r\n    throughout, the Court finds that the statute concerns a debtor-creditor \r\n    relationship and does not impose a trust \r\nrelationship.</p></blockquote></blockquote>\r\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 153-54. The court found that unlike situations where a statute \r\nis clear that the intent is for the trustee to hold funds for the benefit of \r\nbeneficiaries, the PRSA does not identify a trustee, actually require \r\nsegregation of trust proceeds, or otherwise impose rights or duties typically \r\nassociated with a trustee/beneficiary relationship. <i>Id.</i> at 152. The court \r\nconcluded § 570.10(A) must be read in context with other provisions of the PRSA, \r\nwhich reading supports the conclusion the PRSA is a regulatory scheme for how \r\noperators and owners will interact with regard to the well.

April \r\n19, 2010). In <i>In re SemCrude</i>, the bankruptcy court held the existence of \r\nthis Act further supported its conclusion that the PRSA did not create a \r\ntrust.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <p>The existence of these lien rights bears upon, and supports, the Court's \r\n    earlier construction of the PRSA. The Lien Act predates enactment of the \r\n    PRSA, and was not repealed upon enactment of the PRSA. The Oklahoma \r\n    Producers' contention that the PRSA imposes a trust for their benefit upon \r\n    production and proceeds is belied by the continued vitality of the rights \r\n    afforded under the Lien Act, as it is axiomatic that a party cannot hold a \r\n    lien in its own property.</p></blockquote></blockquote>\r\n<p><i>In re SemCrude, L.P.</i>,<i> </i>407 B.R. at 157 fn. 10.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n<p>¶16 In response to the <i>In re SemCrude, L.P.</i> decision, the Oklahoma \r\nLegislature repealed the existing Lien Act of 1988 and enacted the Oil and Gas \r\nOwners' Lien Act of 2010 (\"Lien Act\"). <i>See</i> 52 O.S.2011, § 549.1 <i>et \r\nseq.</i>, Cmt. 10 (The 2010 Act was \"designed to remedy some of the deficiencies \r\nperceived to be present in the Prior Act as well as to address some of the \r\nissues that emerged in the SemGroup litigation.\") The purpose of the statute was \r\nto give Oklahoma producers and royalty owners a first-priority lien to secure \r\npayment for their interest in oil and gas sold to a first purchaser. The new \r\nlien attaches to oil and gas before extraction and follows the oil and gas upon \r\nseverance. It also attaches to the proceeds of sale. The Lien Act strengthens \r\nthe rights of Oklahoma interests owners in three (3) ways: 1) Oklahoma oil and \r\ngas interests are now governed by real property law, which designates the \r\napplicable law by the state in which the wellhead is located; (2) Oklahoma \r\ninterest owners can now obtain a lien that will remain attached until a first \r\npurchaser has paid in full the purchase price of produced oil; and (3) the Lien \r\nAct explicitly and unbendingly grants superior priority to Oklahoma interest \r\nowners above all other lienholders and U.C.C. Article 9 secured creditors. \r\n<i>See</i> <i>There's A New Act in Town: How the Oklahoma Oil and Gas Owners' \r\nLien Act of 2010 Strengthens the Position of Oklahoma Interest Owner</i>s, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> \r\n<span class=\"reporter\">Okla.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span>. Rev. 133 (2012). Title 52 \r\nO.S.2011, § 549.6 allows a downstream purchaser to take free of the \r\nstatutory lien only under certain conditions.</p>\r\n<p>¶17 We agree with the bankruptcy court that the PRSA is a regulatory scheme \r\nfor how operators and owners will interact with regard to the well. In addition, \r\n§ 570.10(A) specifically provides it applies only to the revenue or proceeds \r\nfrom the sale of production, <i>i.e.</i>, the oil and gas and other minerals \r\nthat the lessee extracts from the ground at the wellhead. Section 570.10(A) does \r\nnot specifically apply to downstream purchasers. Accordingly, we reject Gaskins' \r\nassertion that the PRSA applies to Texon's subsequent purchase of oil and gas \r\nfrom SemCrude.</p>\r\n<p>¶18 Gaskins further asserts Texon will be unjustly enriched if it is not \r\nrequired to pay the proceeds from the sale of his oil and gas. A review of the \r\nrecord on appeal reveals, however, that Gaskins did not assert an unjust \r\nenrichment claim against Texon in this case nor was this issue raised to the \r\ntrial court below. Rather, Gaskins merely sought a declaratory judgment that the \r\nPRSA applies to Texon. Therefore, this assertion of error is denied.</p>\r\n<p>¶19 Accordingly, the trial court properly dismissed Gaskins' declaratory \r\njudgment action against Texon for failure to state a claim for which relief can \r\nbe granted under the PRSA. The court's November 19, 2012, order is therefore \r\naffirmed.</p>\r\n<div class=\"de-action-clause\">\r\n<p>¶20 <b>AFFIRMED.</b></p></div>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<div class=\"de-vote\">\r\n<p>THORNBRUGH, P.J., and RAPP, J., concur.</p></div>\r\n<div class=\"fn-container\">\r\n<p align=\"center\"><b>FOOTNOTES</b></p>\r\n<div class=\"fn-footnote\">\r\n<p><sup>1</sup> Texon's \r\nmotion for leave to file appellate briefing was granted on February 6, \r\n2013.</p></div>\r\n<div class=\"fn-footnote\">\r\n<p><sup>2</sup> Gaskins \r\noriginally filed suit against CP Energy, LLC, on February 28, 2012.
