The defendant<br><br>          officials challenge the  fee award primarily  on the ground  that<br><br>          Domegan cannot be considered a \"prevailing party\" in light of the<br><br>          results achieved in litigation.  With modifications to the amount<br><br>          of the award, we affirm the district court judgment.<br><br><br>                                          I<br>                                          I<br><br>                                      BACKGROUND<br>                                      BACKGROUND<br>                                      __________<br><br><br>            On  August  15, 1983,  while  imprisoned  at the  Massachusetts<br><br>          Correctional  Institution  at  Walpole  (\"MCI-Walpole\"),  Domegan<br><br>          lodged a pro se complaint in the United States District Court for<br>                   ___ __<br><br>          the District  of Massachusetts, alleging civil  rights violations<br><br>          under the Eighth and  Fourteenth Amendments to the United  States<br><br>          Constitution.  The complaint stemmed  from Domegan's disciplinary<br><br>          placement  on the  \"Alternate  Feeding Program\"  (\"AFP\") at  MCI-<br><br>          Walpole in  May and again in July  of 1983.1  At  that time, each<br><br>          meal served to AFP inmates, including Domegan, consisted entirely<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>          1The May placement occurred after Domegan threw his food tray and<br>          human  waste against the wall outside his cell; in July, he threw<br>          his food and tray outside his cell.<br><br>                                          4<br>                                          4<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          of two  cheese sandwiches.  The  solid steel doors of  AFP inmate<br><br>          cells remained closed.  The inmate was given no hearing  prior to<br><br>          the AFP placement.   AFP status was  reviewed every five  days by<br><br>          the  prison official  who recommended  the particular  placement.<br><br>          Domegan remained on AFP for seven and one-half days in May  1983,<br><br>          and for five days in July 1983.<br><br>            During  March  1984,  the  district  court  appointed  Goodwin,<br><br>          Procter &amp; Hoar [hereinafter Procter &amp; Hoar] to represent Domegan.<br><br>          The  final amended  complaint  asserted three  causes of  action:<br><br>          cruel and  unusual punishment (Eighth and  Fourteenth Amendments;<br><br>          42 U.S.C.    1983; M.G.L.  c. 12,    11 H,I);2  violation of  due<br>                                                    _<br><br>          process (Fourteenth  Amendment; 42 U.S.C.    1983; M.G.L.  c. 12,<br><br>             11 H,I);  and violation of the Massachusetts  Civil Rights Act<br>                  _<br><br>          (M.G.L. c.  12,    11 I).   The final amended  complaint demanded<br>                                _<br><br>          declaratory and injunctive  relief, compensatory damages totaling<br><br>          $50,000,and$35,000 inpunitivedamagesfromeach ofthetendefendants.3<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>          2Initially, Domegan  sought to establish that the  AFP was viola-<br>          tive  of the Eighth Amendment, facially and as applied, but later<br>          relinquished the  facial claim.   The \"as applied\"  claim alleged<br>          that the defendant  officers and sergeants  assigned to the  AFP:<br>          (i) turned off the  electricity to Domegan's cell to  prevent him<br>          from  complying with the AFP  regimen for receiving  food at meal<br>          time; (ii) refused to feed him, knowing  that he could not comply<br>          with the AFP regimen; and (iii) turned off his water supply.<br><br>          3The  ten defendants  named in the  final amended  complaint were<br>          Joseph J. Ponte,  Superintendent at  MCI-Walpole; Frank  Leppert,<br>          Administrator of the Department  Segregation Unit (\"DSU\") at MCI-<br>          Walpole;  Peter  Gallagher, Acting  DSU  Administrator; Sergeants<br>          Anthony Silva and James Brooks; and Officers Carl  Harrison, Gary<br>          Mendes, Christopher Pires, Patrick Smith, and Brian  Bissonnette.<br>          Three other defendants  were named in earlier complaints but were<br><br>                                          5<br>                                          5<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            Domegan  was granted  summary  judgment on  the procedural  due<br><br>          process  claim.   The case  proceeded to  trial on  the remaining<br><br>          claims in March 1989.  The jury awarded Domegan $1.00 in \"compen-<br><br>          satory\" damages  on the due process claim,  but returned verdicts<br><br>          for  all defendants  on  the remaining  Eighth Amendment  claims.<br><br>          Judgment was  entered  in  the  amount of  $1.00  against  Ponte,<br><br>          Leppert,  and Gallagher.4   Domegan  requested attorney  fees and<br><br>          costs  in the amount of $88,655.16, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.   1988.<br><br>          Although the district court  determined that Domegan was a  \"pre-<br><br>          vailing party\" entitled to recover a  reasonable attorney fee, it<br><br>          reduced  the amount  of the award  to $41,441.55 in  light of the<br><br>          limited success achieved in litigation.

For instance,  appellants suggest that<br>          Procter &amp;  Hoar's over-staffing  and personnel changes  caused \"a<br>          spate of conferences, cross-conferences, drafts, revisions, edits<br>          of other people's drafts and revisions, etc., for which plaintiff<br>          sought  compensation.\"  Our review  of the application allays any<br><br>                                          44<br>                                          44<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            Appellants   contend  that  the  fee  application  inadequately<br><br>          reflected the limited \"degree of success\" achieved in litigation,<br><br>          as demonstrated by the sizeable reduction imposed by the district<br><br>          court, and, therefore, that  the total compensation requested was<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>          such concerns.   Approximately 267 of the 352 time entries in the<br>          fee application pertain to services performed by the lead partner<br>          and the  primary  associate who  took  charge of  the  litigation<br>          several  years after Procter &amp; Hoar was appointed.  Moreover, the<br>          application pares the  total hours billed, in  recognition of the<br>          fact  that \"some  of  the time  billed  was redundant,  owing  to<br>          unavoidable  changes of staffing on  the case, or  was less effi-<br>          cient than it might have been because some assignments were given<br>          in the first instance to law clerks and interns.\"<br>            Appellants further  contend that the fee  request was inflated,<br>          because, they  say, virtually the  entire trial was  dedicated to<br>          litigating  the unsuccessful  claims, lead  trial counsel  sought<br>          compensation  for more than ten hours daily even though the trial<br>          was conducted on a half-day basis, and compensation was requested<br>          for  two trial attorneys.   Nevertheless, it was  not improper to<br>          request compensation for  the trial time  spent securing the  due<br>          process  nominal damage  award.   In recognition  of the  lack of<br>          success on the other claims,  compensation was requested for only<br>          one third of the trial time.  Contrary to appellants' suggestion,<br>          moreover, we  do not find  the pretrial discovery  entries exces-<br>          sive, nor, for the most part, inclusive of work for which compen-<br>          sation should not have been sought.  Virtually all of the discov-<br>          ery services for which  compensation was requested (including the<br>          deposition  of a  Department of  Correction nutritionist  and the<br>          interrogatories  propounded  to victorious  defendants)  were not<br>          plainly unrelated to the successful due process claim, in support<br>          of  which evidence  was  needed to  establish  the existence  and<br>          nature of the due process deprivation.  See infra note 40.<br>                                    ___________   ___ _____<br>            Appellants point to a handful of \"mixed\" entries  pertaining to<br>          amendments  to the  complaint which  are not  compensable because<br>          they  related  to unsuccessful  claims  (even  though each  entry<br>          included some compensable services as  well).  Likewise, a number<br>          of other  \"mixed\" entries relating to  unsuccessful claims should<br>          not  have been  included in the  fee application.   But for these<br>          minor  exceptions,  however,  the  fee application  accorded  due<br>          regard to  the requirement  that compensation  not be  sought for<br>          services rendered on  unsuccessful claims.   In all fairness,  we<br>          cannot  conclude  that  these  lapses  in  precision  fee-cutting<br>          approached those involved  in Lewis, such that the  present award<br>                                        _____<br>          again should be slashed under the \"special circumstances\" test.<br><br>                                          45<br>                                          45<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          inflated.

Although we conclude<br><br>          that further  reductions are required,  we discern  no basis  for<br><br>          questioning  the  bona fides  of  the fee  application  under the<br>                            ____ _____<br><br>          \"special circumstances\" exception.<br><br><br>            3.

Nevertheless, their failure  to present<br>          evidence  that the flat rates approved by the district court were<br>          unreasonable means that appellants  cannot prevail on their \"flat<br>                                                     _______<br>          rate\" challenge.   Since the  \"bottom line\" is  a reasonable  fee<br>          award, their  \"flat rate\" challenge cannot  succeed unless appel-<br>          lants show that the flat rates allowed by the district court were<br>          not  reasonable average  rates for  the types  of legal  services<br>          determined  compensable by the district  court.

The due  process portion  of the  summary<br>          judgment  memorandum therefore focused  in part on  the nature of<br>          the deprivations caused by the  AFP placement, and the lack  of a<br>          sufficient   administrative   rationale  for   the  deprivations.<br>          (\"Nutritionally deficient  and unvaried  meals in no  way advance<br>          the interest in preventing  health hazards caused by  thrown food<br>          and waste.\").   Thus, this section of  the memorandum did rely on<br>          evidence as to the conditions of confinement while Domegan was on<br>          the AFP.<br><br>                                          53<br>                                          53<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          process claim.

The defendant<br><br>          officials challenge the  fee award primarily  on the ground  that<br><br>          Domegan cannot be considered a \"prevailing party\" in light of the<br><br>          results achieved in litigation.  With modifications to the amount<br><br>          of the award, we affirm the district court judgment.<br><br><br>                                          I<br>                                          I<br><br>                                      BACKGROUND<br>                                      BACKGROUND<br>                                      __________<br><br><br>            On  August  15, 1983,  while  imprisoned  at the  Massachusetts<br><br>          Correctional  Institution  at  Walpole  (\"MCI-Walpole\"),  Domegan<br><br>          lodged a pro se complaint in the United States District Court for<br>                   ___ __<br><br>          the District  of Massachusetts, alleging civil  rights violations<br><br>          under the Eighth and  Fourteenth Amendments to the United  States<br><br>          Constitution.  The complaint stemmed  from Domegan's disciplinary<br><br>          placement  on the  \"Alternate  Feeding Program\"  (\"AFP\") at  MCI-<br><br>          Walpole in  May and again in July  of 1983.1  At  that time, each<br><br>          meal served to AFP inmates, including Domegan, consisted entirely<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>          1The May placement occurred after Domegan threw his food tray and<br>          human  waste against the wall outside his cell; in July, he threw<br>          his food and tray outside his cell.<br><br>                                          4<br>                                          4<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          of two  cheese sandwiches.  The  solid steel doors of  AFP inmate<br><br>          cells remained closed.  The inmate was given no hearing  prior to<br><br>          the AFP placement.   AFP status was  reviewed every five  days by<br><br>          the  prison official  who recommended  the particular  placement.<br><br>          Domegan remained on AFP for seven and one-half days in May  1983,<br><br>          and for five days in July 1983.<br><br>            During  March  1984,  the  district  court  appointed  Goodwin,<br><br>          Procter &amp; Hoar [hereinafter Procter &amp; Hoar] to represent Domegan.<br><br>          The  final amended  complaint  asserted three  causes of  action:<br><br>          cruel and  unusual punishment (Eighth and  Fourteenth Amendments;<br><br>          42 U.S.C.    1983; M.G.L.  c. 12,    11 H,I);2  violation of  due<br>                                                    _<br><br>          process (Fourteenth  Amendment; 42 U.S.C.    1983; M.G.L.  c. 12,<br><br>             11 H,I);  and violation of the Massachusetts  Civil Rights Act<br>                  _<br><br>          (M.G.L. c.  12,    11 I).   The final amended  complaint demanded<br>                                _<br><br>          declaratory and injunctive  relief, compensatory damages totaling<br><br>          $50,000,and$35,000 inpunitivedamagesfromeach ofthetendefendants.3<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>          2Initially, Domegan  sought to establish that the  AFP was viola-<br>          tive  of the Eighth Amendment, facially and as applied, but later<br>          relinquished the  facial claim.   The \"as applied\"  claim alleged<br>          that the defendant  officers and sergeants  assigned to the  AFP:<br>          (i) turned off the  electricity to Domegan's cell to  prevent him<br>          from  complying with the AFP  regimen for receiving  food at meal<br>          time; (ii) refused to feed him, knowing  that he could not comply<br>          with the AFP regimen; and (iii) turned off his water supply.<br><br>          3The  ten defendants  named in the  final amended  complaint were<br>          Joseph J. Ponte,  Superintendent at  MCI-Walpole; Frank  Leppert,<br>          Administrator of the Department  Segregation Unit (\"DSU\") at MCI-<br>          Walpole;  Peter  Gallagher, Acting  DSU  Administrator; Sergeants<br>          Anthony Silva and James Brooks; and Officers Carl  Harrison, Gary<br>          Mendes, Christopher Pires, Patrick Smith, and Brian  Bissonnette.<br>          Three other defendants  were named in earlier complaints but were<br><br>                                          5<br>                                          5<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            Domegan  was granted  summary  judgment on  the procedural  due<br><br>          process  claim.   The case  proceeded to  trial on  the remaining<br><br>          claims in March 1989.  The jury awarded Domegan $1.00 in \"compen-<br><br>          satory\" damages  on the due process claim,  but returned verdicts<br><br>          for  all defendants  on  the remaining  Eighth Amendment  claims.<br><br>          Judgment was  entered  in  the  amount of  $1.00  against  Ponte,<br><br>          Leppert,  and Gallagher.4   Domegan  requested attorney  fees and<br><br>          costs  in the amount of $88,655.16, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.   1988.<br><br>          Although the district court  determined that Domegan was a  \"pre-<br><br>          vailing party\" entitled to recover a  reasonable attorney fee, it<br><br>          reduced  the amount  of the award  to $41,441.55 in  light of the<br><br>          limited success achieved in litigation.  The defendants challenge<br><br>          the fee award on several grounds.5<br><br><br>                                          II<br>                                          II<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>          dropped from the final amended complaint.<br>            On  November 1,  1983, two  and one-half  months after  Domegan<br>          filed his pro se complaint, MCI-Walpole instituted  a more varied<br>                    ___ __<br>          and  nutritious menu  for  AFP  inmates.   In  1985,  MCI-Walpole<br>          revised  its post-deprivation  review procedures,  requiring that<br>          each AFP inmate's  status be reassessed  after each meal.   On or<br>          about October 11, 1988, prior to trial, Domegan was released from<br>          state  custody, and  the  claims for  injunctive and  declaratory<br>          relief were not pursued.<br><br>          4It is not clear why judgment was never entered against the other<br>          seven defendants.<br><br>          5Although  judgment  was entered  only against  defendants Ponte,<br>          Leppert  and Gallagher,  the  other seven  defendants joined  the<br>          appeal because  the attorney fee award  ran against \"defendants.\"<br>          As  Domegan correctly concedes, however, there is no basis for an<br>          award against the  seven codefendants who were found  not liable.<br>          Accordingly, we dismiss these seven defendants-appellants.   <br><br>                                          6<br>                                          6<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                                      DISCUSSION<br>                                      DISCUSSION<br>                                      __________<br><br><br>          A.

Helms was  released on  parole prior  to any<br><br>          decision  by the  district court,  and the  district court  later<br><br>          entered  summary  judgment  against  Helms.   The  Third  Circuit<br>                                      _______<br><br>          reversed  on the ground that  Helms had been  denied due process.<br><br>          The  court  of appeals  ordered the  case  remanded for  entry of<br><br>          judgment in favor of Helms, except as to any defendant determined<br><br>                                          18<br>                                          18<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          entitled  to qualified immunity.   Prior to the  actual remand to<br><br>          the  district court,  however,  the  defendant  prison  officials<br><br>          secured  a favorable  Supreme  Court decision  dismissing one  of<br><br>          Helms'  claims.  After remand  from the Supreme  Court, the Third<br><br>          Circuit reaffirmed its  earlier holding on the  other due process<br><br>          claim and again remanded  to the district court  on the issue  of<br><br>          qualified  immunity.  On remand,  Helms did not pursue injunctive<br><br>          relief.  The district court  once again entered summary  judgment<br><br>          against Helms, on the ground that the defendants were immune from<br><br>          liability for damages, and denied a fee award under section 1988.<br><br>          The  Third Circuit again reversed, on the ground that its earlier<br><br>          interlocutory  ruling that  Helms'  due process  rights had  been<br><br>          violated constituted significant success.<br><br>            The Supreme Court  disagreed.  Justice Scalia  pointed out that<br><br>          Helms  had obtained no relief whatever on any claim in litigation<br><br>             no judgment, no damages, no injunctive relief, and no declara-<br><br>          tory relief.   \"The most  that he obtained  was an  interlocutory<br>                                                              _____________<br><br>          ruling that  his complaint  should not  have  been dismissed  for<br><br>          failure  to state a constitutional  claim.\"  Hewitt,  482 U.S. at<br>                                                       ______<br><br>          760  (emphasis added).

Moreover,  as  the Court  clearly<br><br>          explained in Hewitt:<br>                       ______<br><br><br>            Respect  for ordinary  language  requires  that  a  plaintiff<br>            receive  at  least some  relief on  the  merits of  his claim<br>            before he can be  said to prevail.

Helms obtained no relief.  Because<br>            of the  defendants' official immunity he  received no damages<br>            award.  No injunction or declaratory judgment was  entered in<br>            his favor.  Nor did Helms obtain relief without  benefit of a<br>            formal  judgment    for example,  through a consent decree or<br>            settlement.   See Maher v.

If a defendant<br>            may feel that the cost of litigation, and, particularly, that<br>            the financial circumstances of an injured party may mean that<br>            the chances of suit  being brought, or continued in  the face<br>            of opposition, will be small, there will be little brake upon<br>            deliberate wrongdoing.<br><br>          Knight  v.

For instance,  appellants suggest that<br>          Procter &amp;  Hoar's over-staffing  and personnel changes  caused \"a<br>          spate of conferences, cross-conferences, drafts, revisions, edits<br>          of other people's drafts and revisions, etc., for which plaintiff<br>          sought  compensation.\"  Our review  of the application allays any<br><br>                                          44<br>                                          44<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            Appellants   contend  that  the  fee  application  inadequately<br><br>          reflected the limited \"degree of success\" achieved in litigation,<br><br>          as demonstrated by the sizeable reduction imposed by the district<br><br>          court, and, therefore, that  the total compensation requested was<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>          such concerns.   Approximately 267 of the 352 time entries in the<br>          fee application pertain to services performed by the lead partner<br>          and the  primary  associate who  took  charge of  the  litigation<br>          several  years after Procter &amp; Hoar was appointed.  Moreover, the<br>          application pares the  total hours billed, in  recognition of the<br>          fact  that \"some  of  the time  billed  was redundant,  owing  to<br>          unavoidable  changes of staffing on  the case, or  was less effi-<br>          cient than it might have been because some assignments were given<br>          in the first instance to law clerks and interns.\"<br>            Appellants further  contend that the fee  request was inflated,<br>          because, they  say, virtually the  entire trial was  dedicated to<br>          litigating  the unsuccessful  claims, lead  trial counsel  sought<br>          compensation  for more than ten hours daily even though the trial<br>          was conducted on a half-day basis, and compensation was requested<br>          for  two trial attorneys.   Nevertheless, it was  not improper to<br>          request compensation for  the trial time  spent securing the  due<br>          process  nominal damage  award.   In recognition  of the  lack of<br>          success on the other claims,  compensation was requested for only<br>          one third of the trial time.  Contrary to appellants' suggestion,<br>          moreover, we  do not find  the pretrial discovery  entries exces-<br>          sive, nor, for the most part, inclusive of work for which compen-<br>          sation should not have been sought.  Virtually all of the discov-<br>          ery services for which  compensation was requested (including the<br>          deposition  of a  Department of  Correction nutritionist  and the<br>          interrogatories  propounded  to victorious  defendants)  were not<br>          plainly unrelated to the successful due process claim, in support<br>          of  which evidence  was  needed to  establish  the existence  and<br>          nature of the due process deprivation.  See infra note 40.<br>                                    ___________   ___ _____<br>            Appellants point to a handful of \"mixed\" entries  pertaining to<br>          amendments  to the  complaint which  are not  compensable because<br>          they  related  to unsuccessful  claims  (even  though each  entry<br>          included some compensable services as  well).  Likewise, a number<br>          of other  \"mixed\" entries relating to  unsuccessful claims should<br>          not  have been  included in the  fee application.   But for these<br>          minor  exceptions,  however,  the  fee application  accorded  due<br>          regard to  the requirement  that compensation  not be  sought for<br>          services rendered on  unsuccessful claims.   In all fairness,  we<br>          cannot  conclude  that  these  lapses  in  precision  fee-cutting<br>          approached those involved  in Lewis, such that the  present award<br>                                        _____<br>          again should be slashed under the \"special circumstances\" test.<br><br>                                          45<br>                                          45<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          inflated.

Although we conclude<br><br>          that further  reductions are required,  we discern  no basis  for<br><br>          questioning  the  bona fides  of  the fee  application  under the<br>                            ____ _____<br><br>          \"special circumstances\" exception.<br><br><br>            3.

Nevertheless, their failure  to present<br>          evidence  that the flat rates approved by the district court were<br>          unreasonable means that appellants  cannot prevail on their \"flat<br>                                                     _______<br>          rate\" challenge.

The due  process portion  of the  summary<br>          judgment  memorandum therefore focused  in part on  the nature of<br>          the deprivations caused by the  AFP placement, and the lack  of a<br>          sufficient   administrative   rationale  for   the  deprivations.<br>          (\"Nutritionally deficient  and unvaried  meals in no  way advance<br>          the interest in preventing  health hazards caused by  thrown food<br>          and waste.\").

We remind appellants that there were two<br><br>          other  appellate claims  which they  had no  right to  present on<br><br>          interlocutory  appeal.  See Domegan v.

As appellants point  out, the fee<br>          application claimed that Ms. Bagger spent 49.1 hours of compensa-<br>          ble time  (on summary judgment  and the interlocutory  appeal) at<br>          the  $95.00 hourly rate.  Our review  of the fee request and time<br>          sheets  indicates that she actually devoted  49.9 hours, but that<br>          other minor  miscalculations necessitate the  net adjustment  set<br>          forth in the text.<br><br>                                          60<br>                                          60<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge  (Concurring).
