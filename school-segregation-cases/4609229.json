The FBI\n\ndesignated the requests contained in this letter as Request Nos. 1313500-000 and 1313504-\n\n000 (later consolidating them under No. 1313504-000), granted expedited processing, and\n\nwaived the applicable fees.

Request Nos. 1319113-000 & 1319138-000\n\nOn October 31, 2014, RCFP submitted two letters to the FBI requesting records\npursuant to FOIA. The first letter sought:\n\n[A]ll records concerning the FBI’s guidelines and policies concerning\n\nundercover operations or activities in which a person may act as a member\n\nof the news media, including, but not limited to, the guidelines and policies\n\nrelating to the criminal and national security undercover operations review\n\ncommittees and the Sensitive Operations Review Committee; guidelines and\npolicies concerning the use of investigative methods targeting or affecting\n\nthe news media, including, but not limited to, sensitive Title III applications;\n\nand all guidelines and policies concerning sensitive investigative matters\n\ninvolving the activities of the news media or relating to the status,\n\ninvolvement, or impact of an investigation upon the news media.\nDefs.’ Facts 11 7 ; Pls.’ F acts 11 l; Hardy Decl., Ex.

Litigation and Release of Records\n\nPlaintiffs filed this action in August 2015 asserting the FBI had failed to timely\nrespond to their FOIA requests, failed to conduct a reasonable Search, and wrongfully\nwithheld non-exempt records. Compl. 1111 58-74 [Dkt. #l].l After the parties filed their\nmeet and confer statement as required by the local rules, the Court entered a Scheduling\nOrder requiring defendants to complete production of all non-exempt records, and setting\na briefing schedule for any dispositive motions. Sched. Order (Jan. 19, 2016) [Dkt. #15].\n\nOn February 26, 2016, the FBl made an initial release of responsive records, and on\nMarch 28, 2016, made a supplemental release. Altogether, the agency processed a total of\n267 pages of records responsive to plaintiffs’ FOIA requests, releasing 83 pages in full and\n103 pages in part. Defs.’ Facts 11 16; Pls.’ Facts 11 16. Of the pages withheld in full or\nwithheld in part, 22 pages were withheld in full as duplicates. Defs.’ Facts 11 16; Pls.’ Facts\n11 16. Of the remaining pages withheld in full or withheld in part, the FBI asserted FOIA\nExemptions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7(C), and 7(E). Defs.’ Facts 11 18; Pls.’ Facts 11 18. The parties were\nunable to resolve their differences regarding the sufficiency of the FBI’s search and the\nlegal basis for its withholdings, see loint Status Rep. 2 (Mar. 11, 2016) [Dkt. #16], and\nfiled the cross motions for summary judgment now before the Court.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nFOIA requires federal agencies to release government records to the public upon\n\nrequest, subject to nine exemptions See 5 U.S.C. § 552; Murphy v. Exec. Ojj‘ice for U.S.\n\n \n\n‘ The complaint also challenged the FBI’s decision to deny RCFP a fee waiver. Compl. 1111 75~81.\nBecause the FBI has since waived the fee, Defs.’ Facts11 17; Pls.’ Facts 11 17, this issue is moot.\n\n4\n\nAttorneys, 789 F.3d 204, 206 (D.C. Cir. 2015). “[T]he vast majority of FOIA cases can be\nresolved on summary j udgment.” Brayton v. U.S. Traa'e Representatz`ve, 641 F.3d 521, 527\n(D.C. Cir. 2011). When presented with a motion for summary judgment in a FOIA case,\nthe district court must review the record de novo to determine whether the agency has\nshown (1) “the search was reasonably calculated to discover the requested documents,”\nDiBacco v. U.S. Army, 795 F.3d 178, 191-92 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quotation marks omitted);\n(2) any documents withheld “are exempt from disclosure,” Murphy, 789 F.3d at 208-09\n(quotation marks omitted); and (3) that “all reasonably segregable, nonexempt portions of\nthe requested record(s)” have been disclosed, Assassz'natz`on Archives & Research Ctr. v.\nCIA, 334 F.3d 55, 58 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Summary judgment is appropriate “if the movant\nshows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). “In applying this rule,” courts are\nmindful that “the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will\nnot defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement\nis that there be no genuine issue of material fact.” Byers v. CIR, 740 F.3d 668, 675 (D.C.\nCir. 2014) (quotation marks omitted). A dispute about a material fact is “genuine” where\n“the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.”\nJohnson v. Perez, 823 F.3d 701, 705 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quotation marks omitted).\n\nANALYSIS\n1. Adequacy of the Search\n\nPlaintiffs contest the adequacy of the search conducted by the FBI. “‘When a\n\nplaintiff questions the adequacy of the search an agency made in order to satisfy its FOIA\n\n5\n\nrequest, the factual question it raises is whether the Search was reasonably calculated to\ndiscover the requested documents[.]”’ DiBacco, 795 F.3d at 191-92 (quoting SafeCara’\nServs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1201 (D.C. Cir. 1991)). It is the agency’s burden “to\nshow that its search efforts were reasonable and logically organized to uncover relevant\ndocuments.” Id. at 191. An agency may meet this burden “by submitting reasonably\ndetailed, nonconclusory affidavits describing its efforts.” Baker & Hostetler LLP v. U.S.\nDep ’t of Commerce, 473 F.3d 312, 318 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Such affidavits are “accorded a\npresumption of good faith,” SafeCard, 926 F.2d at 1200, and “[m]ere speculation that as\nyet uncovered documents may exist does not undermine the finding that the agency\nconducted a reasonable search,” Hodge v. FBI, 703 F.3d 575, 580 (D.C. Cir. 2013)\n(quotation marks omitted).\n\nIn this case, the evidence shows that the FBI conducted a good faith, reasonable\nsearch of the systems of records likely to possess records responsive to plaintiffs’ requests,\nThe Bureau sorted the requests into two groups. “Group l” contained FOIA Request No.\n1319138-000, pertaining to the FBI’s use of HTML links designed to appear as links to\nnews media stories. Hardy Decl. 1111 34~35. “Group 2” contained FOIA Request Nos.\n1319113-000 and 1313504-000, pertaining to the Timberline High School case. Ia’. 1111 34,\n41. The agency attests that it searched the record repositories appropriate for each group\nin a manner designed to uncover responsive records. Id. 1111 34-59; see also Second Decl.\n\nof David M. Hardy 1111 2-9 (“Hardy Supp. Decl.”) [Dkt. #22-2].2 “[B]ecause the sworn\n\n \n\n2 Plaintiffs assert in their combined opposition and reply that defendants cannot rely on the second\ndeclaration of Mr. Hardy because it was not filed with defendants’ motion for summary judgment That\n\n6\n\ndeclarations from the FBI indicate that it conducted ‘reasonably calculated’ searches, the\nburden is on [plaintiffs] to identify specific additional places the agency should now\nsearch.” Hoa’ge, 703 F.3d at 580.\n\nPlaintiffs object to the structure of the FBI’s search, arguing that the agency’s\ndecision to divide their FOIA requests into two groups “resulted in the FBI conducting\nunreasonably narrow and misdirected searches for responsive records.” Pls.’ Mem. of Law\nin Opp. to Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J. and in Supp. of Pls.’ Mot. for Summ. J. and/or Partial\nSumm. J. 14 (“Pls. Mem.”) [Dkt. #19-1]. The FBI contends that the division was necessary\nbecause, “due to the specificity of the FOIA requests, not all of the requests lent themselves\nreadily or naturally to the searches that the FBI routinely conducts in response to FOIA\nrequests.” Hardy Decl. 11 34. In particular, the Bureau was concerned that a search of the\nagency’s Central Records System (“CRS”) would not produce materials responsive to the\nGroup 1 requests because the “CRS indices are not a repository for policy related matters.”\nIa’. 11 36. The agency determined that its Operational Technology Division (“OTD”) was\nlikely to possess the responsive documents, and directed that unit to search its records. Ia'.\n1111 37-40 & n.6; see also Hardy Supp. Decl. 11 4 (explaining “OTD is solely responsible for\nthe deployment and collection of all lawfully conducted electronic surveillance bureau\n\nwide”). Although plaintiffs would have structured the search differently, an agency “need\n\n \n\nassertion is contrary to the practice of courts in this Circuit. See, e.g., Barnard v. DHS, 598 F. Supp. 2d l,\n20 (D.D.C. 2009) (“Based on the present record, which includes the second declaration . . . the Court finds\nthat Defendant has met its burden[.]”); Schoenman v. FB], 575 F. Supp. 2d 166, 176-77 (D.D.C. 2008)\n(similar). The second Hardy declaration is now part of the record, and plaintiffs have responded to its\ncontent. The Court will consider the declaration and plaintiffs’ arguments as appropriate\n\n7\n\nnot knock down every search design advanced by every requester” in order to prevail at\nsummary judgment DiBacco, 795 F.3d at 191.\n\nOn a related note, plaintiffs fault the FBI for its decision not to search the CRS for\ndocuments responsive to the Group l requests, But “[t]he FBI was not required to search\nevery record system; it was only required to conduct a reasonable search of those systems\nof records likely to possess the requested information.” Light v. DOJ, 968 F. Supp. 2d ll,\n25 (D.D.C. 2013) (citing Oglesby v. U.S. Dep ’t ofArmy, 920 F.Zd 57, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1990)).\nThe FBI’s search of the OTD records satisfied this standard because, as explained above,\nthat division was likely to possess the requested information. In any event, the agency\navers that despite its initial determination, it has now conducted a search of the CRS. That\nsearch produced no responsive records. Hardy Supp. Decl. 11 5.\n\nPlaintiffs also criticize the search terms used by the FBI for locating records\nresponsive to the Group 2 requests in the CRS and the Electronic Surveillance (“ELSUR”)\nindices. According to plaintiffs, the keywords used were “deficient” because they\n“relat[ed] solely to the Seattle/Timberline Incident.” Pls.’ Mem. 15~16. But the FBI\nexplains that these terms were necessary because CRS and ELSUR are indexed based on\nspecific individuals, events, and organizations, Hardy Decl. 1111 49, 55, 59, and the\nTirnberline incident was the only specific incident referenced in plaintiffs’ requests, see\nia’., Exs. A (AP letter), K (first RCFP letter), and L (second RCFP letter), As our Circuit\nhas made clear, a search is not rendered inadequate by the suggestion of “additional search\nterms” that, in the requester’s view, the agency “should have used.” DiBacco, 795 F.3d at\n\n191.\n\nPlaintiffs further contend that the search was inadequate because the FBI did not, in\nits response to plaintiffs, specify the cut off dates it used. According to plaintiffs, this\nomission “strongly suggests” that the FBI followed the unreasonable practice of imposing\n“date-of-request” cut offs. Pls.’ Mem. 16. Whatever the merits of this inference, the\nBureau has since clarified that for all searches, it used a “date-of-search” cut off. Hardy\nSupp. Decl. 1111 4~6 & n.4. These cut offs were reasonable. See, e.g., Pub. Citizen v. Dep ’t\nof State, 276 F.3d 634, 644 (D.C. Cir. 2002); Schoenmcm v. FBI, No. CIV.A. 04-2202CKK,\n2009 WL 763065, at *18 (D.D.C. Mar. 19, 2009).\n\nFinally, plaintiffs advance a number of arguments speculating that additional\nresponsive documents must exist in light of other publically available records, such as\nnewspaper articles, court filings, and previously released FBI documents. Plaintiffs face\nan uphill climb in this regard. “In general, the adequacy of a search is determined not by\nthe fruits of the search, but by the appropriateness of its methods.” Hoa'ge, 703 F.3d at 579\n(quotation marks and alteration omitted). Nevertheless, I have reviewed the information\nidentified by plaintiffs for “positive indications of overlooked materials.” Valencia~\nLucena v. U.S. Coasl Guard, 180 F.3d 321, 327 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (quotation marks\nomitted). Nothing in these materials persuades me that plaintiffs’ arguments are anything\nmore than “[m]ere speculation that as yet uncovered documents may exist.” Hodge, 703\nF.3d at 580 (quoting Safecard, 926 F.2d at 1201). Accordingly, l conclude the FBI has\n\ncarried its burden to show that its search was adequate.\n\n2. Applicability of FOIA Exemptions\n\nPlaintiffs also contest the applicability of FOIA Exemptions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7(C), and\n7(E), asserted by the FBI as a basis for withholding certain records. “An agency\nwithholding responsive documents from a FOIA release bears the burden of proving the\napplicability ofclaimed exemptions.” ACLUv. DOD, 628 F.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\nThis task “is not herculean.” Murphy, 789 F.3d at 209. An agency can meet its burden\n“by submitting affidavits that describe the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably\nspecific detail and demonstrate that the information withheld logically falls within the\nclaimed exemption.” Id. (brackets and quotation marks omitted). “Ultimately, an agency’s\njustification for invoking a FOIA exemption is sufficient if it appears ‘logical’ tor\n‘plausible.”’ ACLU, 628 F.3d at 619 (quotation marks omitted).\n\na. Exemption 1\n\nThe FBI withheld portions of seven pages under FOIA Exemption l, 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(b)(l), which exempts from disclosure properly classified national defense or foreign\npolicy materials In determining whether the government’s invocation of Exemption 1 is\njustified, our Circuit has “consistently deferred to executive affidavits predicting harm to\nthe national security.” Larson v. U.S. Dep’t. ofState, 565 F.3d 857, 865 (D.C. Cir. 2009)\n(quoting Cir. for Nat’l Sec. Studies v. DOJ, 331 F.3d 918, 927 (D.C. Cir. 2003)). Here, the\nFBI provides a sworn affidavit from an original classification authority, David M. Hardy,\nSection Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section of the Records\nManagement Division of the FBI, who reviewed all of the withheld information and affirms\n\nthat it is properly classified pursuant to Executive Order 13526. Hardy Decl. 1111 2, 67_68.\n\n10\n\nHe also affirms that the withheld material contains information pertaining to intelligence\nsources and methods, and that release of this information reasonably could be expected to\ncause serious damage to the national security of the United States, and therefore should be\nand is classified at the “Secret” level. Id. 1111 70, 72; see also Hardy Supp. Decl. 11 ll.\nAccordingly, I will defer to the FBI’s predictive judgment regarding this classified material\nand will not review it in camera or order it disclosed.\n\nb. Exemption 3\n\nThe FBI also withheld material on seven pages under FOIA Exemption 3. As\nrelevant here, the Exemption provides that FOIA’s disclosure obligation “does not apply\nto matters that are . . . specifically exempted from disclosure by [another] statute.” 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(b)(3)(A). To apply the Exemption, the Court must ask: “Does the statute meet\nExemption 3’s requirements? And does the information that was withheld fall within that\nstatute’s coverage?” Labow v. DOJ, 831 F.3d 523, 527 (D.C. Cir. 2016).\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the Bureau has not shown that the information withheld falls\nwithin the coverage of the National Security Act of 1947. The Act, which undoubtedly\nmeets the requirements of Exemption 3, CIA v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 167~68 (1985), grants\nthe government “broad authority to protect all sources of intelligence information from\ndisclosure,” ia’. at 169. Mr. Hardy’s affidavit explains that “the FBI’s intelligence sources\nand methods would be revealed if any of the withheld information is disclosed to\n\nPlaintiffs.” Hardy Decl. 11 76. After reviewing the parties’ arguments on this matter, and\n\nll\n\ndeferring to the sworn affidavit as explained above, I am satisfied that the Bureau properly\nwithheld portions of the responsive records under the National Security Act of 1947.3\n\nc. Exemption 5\n\nThe FBI also withheld material under FOIA Exemption 5, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5).\n“Exemption 5 incorporates the traditional privileges that the Government could assert in\ncivil litigation against a private litigant” including “the deliberative process privilege” and\n“the government attorney-client privilege.” Baker & Hostetler, 473 F.3d at 321. The\nBureau asserts these privileges with regard to redacted portions of six pages of emails\nbetween FBI attorneys and other personnel discussing “matters pertaining to the\napplication of an investigative technique,” Hardy Decl. 11 82 & n.28, and of “a report\ncontaining information discussing legal issues regarding the Timberline School\nlnvestigation,” ia’. 11 84 & n.29. Plaintiffs contest the applicability of both privileges.\nAccording to plaintiffs, unredacted portions of these documents show that the information\nwithheld is not “pre-decisional” and thus that the deliberative process privilege cannot\napply. Likewise, they argue, the documents bear no indicia of confidentiality and thus the\ngovernment attorney-client privilege cannot apply.\n\n1 conclude that both exemptions apply. The unredacted portions of the email\nmessages, submitted by plaintiffs, show that agency personnel were discussing changes to,\nand legal review of, an application for a search warrant before submitting it to a court. See\n\nDecl. of Katie Townsend, Ex. Q [Dkt. #19-25]. Such information is both pre-decisional\n\n \n\n3 In light of this holding, and my holding concerning Exemption 7(E), infra, I find it unnecessary to\naddress the parties’ arguments concerning the applicability of Exemption 3 to information obtained\npursuant to the federal statute addressing pen registers and trap and trace devices, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3123-27.\n\n12\n\nand privileged See, e.g., Soghoian v. DOJ, 885 F. Supp. 2d 62, 73-74 (D.D.C. 2012)\n(holding FBI properly withheld “emails among attorneys discussing particular search\nwarrants and investigations” and “draft language regarding guidance” on same). And in\nregard to the report on the Timberline investigation, the supplemental declaration provided\nby the FBI clarifies that the redacted material “concerns opinions and recommendation[s]\nof an advisory nature about FBI authority and policy evaluated in light of the Timberline\ninvestigation, but not adopted by the agency as final policy.” Hardy Supp. Decl. 11 18.\nThus, this information, too, was properly withheld. See, e.g., Elec. Froniier Founa’. v. DOJ,\n739 F.3d l, 8-9 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (affirming withholding of advisory material).\n\nd. Exemption 6 and 7(C)\n\nThe FBI also withheld names and identifying information of federal and state law\nenforcement and support personnel under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C). “FOIA\nExemptions 6 and 7(C) seek to protect the privacy of individuals identified in certain\nagency records.” ACLU v. DOJ, 655 F.3d l, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Exemption 6 protects\n“personnel and medical files and similar files” when disclosure “would constitute a clearly\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6). Exemption 7(C) protects\n“records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes” when disclosure “could\nreasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” Ia’.\n§ 552(b)(7)(C). Both Exemptions require the Court to balance “the privacy interests that\nwould be compromised by disclosure against the public interest in release of the requested\n\ninformation.” Light, 968 F. Supp. 2d at 28 (quotation marks omitted).\n\n13\n\nThe FBI starts from a strong position. Courts in our Circuit have repeatedly held\nthat law enforcement and support personnel have an “extremely strong privacy interest” in\nnot having their identifying information disclosed in connection with any particular\ninvestigative matter. Brown v. FBI, 873 F. Supp. 2d 388, 404 (D.D.C. 2012); see also\nHoa’ge, 703 F.3d at 580; Lesar v. DOJ, 636 F.2d 472, 487 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (“[T]hese agents\nhave a legitimate interest in preserving the secrecy of matters that conceivably could\nsubject them to annoyance or harassment in either their official or private lives.”). The FBI\nhas invoked that weighty interest here, Hardy Decl. 1111 87-89, 92, and plaintiffs offer little\nto counterbalance it. To be sure, plaintiffs assert that production of the records they seek\n“will inform the public as to whether the FBI followed its own internal guidelines in the\nSeattle case and in other cases.” Pls.’ Mem. 39. But they do not explain what, if anything,\nthe disclosure of information identifying individual government employees would add to\ninforming the public. “In the absence of a legitimate public interest, the private interest in\navoiding harassment or violence tilts the Scales.” Jua’icial Walch, lnc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d\n141, 153 (D.C. Cir. 2006). The Bureau properly withheld this information.\n\nd. Exemption 7(E)\n\nFOIA Exemption 7(E) protects “records or information compiled for law\nenforcement purposes” when production “would disclose techniques and procedures for\nlaw enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law\nenforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected\nto risk circumvention of the law.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E). “Exemption 7(E) sets a\nrelatively low bar for the agency to justify withholding: ‘Rather than requiring a highly\n\n14\n\nspecific burden of showing how the law will be circumvented, exemption 7(E) only\nrequires that the [FBI] demonstrate logically how the release of the requested information\nmight create a risk of circumvention of the law.”’ Blackwell v. FBI, 646 F.3d 37, 42 (D.C.\nCir. 2011) (quoting Mayer Brown LLP v. IRS, 562 F.3d 1190, 1194 (D.C. Cir. 2009)).\nUnder this standard, an agency “is not required to describe secret law enforcement\ntechniques, even generally, if the description would reveal the very information sought to\nbe withheld.” Light, 968 F. Supp. 2d at 29.\n\nHere, the FBI invokes Exemption 7(E) with respect to six kinds of information: (1)\noperational directives; (2) records pertaining to a specific undercover operation; (3) internal\nFBI secure fax and phone numbers; (4) details concerning deployments of CIPAVs; (5)\ndetails about certain targets of pen registers and trap and trace devices; and (6) collection\nand analysis methods. In regard to each category, the FBI has credibly and thoroughly\nexplained how release of the information in question might create a risk of circumvention\nof the law. Hardy Decl. 1111 94-103; Hardy Supp. Decl. 1111 22~27. Although plaintiffs\ndemand that the Bureau describe in greater detail the nature of the records it withheld, I\nfind that the agency has justified its withholdings because it has “logically explain[ed]”\nhow the information could help criminals circumvent the law. Blackwell, 646 F.3d at 42.\n\n3. Segregation of Records\n\nFinally, plaintiffs contest the FBI’s segregation of responsive records. Under FOIA,\n“even if an agency establishes an exemption, it must nonetheless disclose all reasonably\nsegregable, nonexempt portions of the requested record(S).” Assassl`nation Archives, 334\nF.3d at 58. “Agencies are entitled to a presumption that they complied with the obligation\n\n15\n\nto disclose reasonably segregable material.” Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 494 F.3d\n1106, 1117 (D.C. Cir. 2007). Plaintiffs argue that the FBI has inadequately explained why\nit could not reasonably segregate and disclose additional material. As noted above,\nexcluding duplicates, the Bureau withheld 59 pages in full and 103 pages in part. The\nagency affirms that it “individually examined” every page “line by line.” Hardy Decl.\n11 104. Material that was withheld was either exempt from disclosure or was so intertwined\nwith protected material that segregation Was not possible without foreseeable harm. See\nid. 11 105; Hardy Supp. Decl, Ex. A (Vaughn index) [Dkt. #22-3]. Upon review of the FBI’s\ndeclarations and Vaughn index, I conclude that the Bureau has fulfilled its duty to be “as\nspecific as possible without actually disclosing information that deserves protection.”\nAssassination Archives, 334 F.3d at 58 n.3 (quotation marks omitted).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will GRANT Defendants’ Motion for Summary\nJudgment, will DENY Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and/or Partial Summary\nJudgment, and will DENY Plaintiffs’ Motion for In Camera Review and/or Other\nAppropriate Relief. An Order consistent with this decision accompanies this\n\nMemorandum Opinion.\n\n/\nRICHARD .LEO\nUnited State ist `ct Judge\n\n \n\n16\n\n",

Request No. 1313504-000\n\nOn November 6, 2014, Raphael Satter, a news correspondent for the AP, sent a letter\nto the FBI requesting:\n\nAny documents referring to the decision to create the fake AP news article\n\nin the Timberline High School case. In particular, l seek correspondence\n\nbetween the FBI’s Seattle office and FBI headquarters about the case. l also\n\nseek a copy of the internal review carried out by the FBI and a copy of the\nWeb link sent by the FBI to suspect in 2007;\n\nAn accounting of the number of times, between Jan. l, 2000 and Nov. 6,\n2014, that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has impersonated media\norganizations or generated media-style material (including but not limited to\nemails, webpages or links) to deliver malicious software to suspects or\nanyone else caught up in an investigation; and\n\nAny documents-_including training material, reviews and policy briefings-\ndealing with the creation and deployment of bogus news stories or media-\nstyle material in an investigative context.\n\n2\n\nDefs.’ Statement of Mat.

Litigation and Release of Records\n\nPlaintiffs filed this action in August 2015 asserting the FBI had failed to timely\nrespond to their FOIA requests, failed to conduct a reasonable Search, and wrongfully\nwithheld non-exempt records. Compl. 1111 58-74 [Dkt. #l].l After the parties filed their\nmeet and confer statement as required by the local rules, the Court entered a Scheduling\nOrder requiring defendants to complete production of all non-exempt records, and setting\na briefing schedule for any dispositive motions. Sched. Order (Jan. 19, 2016) [Dkt. #15].\n\nOn February 26, 2016, the FBl made an initial release of responsive records, and on\nMarch 28, 2016, made a supplemental release. Altogether, the agency processed a total of\n267 pages of records responsive to plaintiffs’ FOIA requests, releasing 83 pages in full and\n103 pages in part. Defs.’ Facts 11 16; Pls.’ Facts 11 16. Of the pages withheld in full or\nwithheld in part, 22 pages were withheld in full as duplicates. Defs.’ Facts 11 16; Pls.’ Facts\n11 16.

The parties were\nunable to resolve their differences regarding the sufficiency of the FBI’s search and the\nlegal basis for its withholdings, see loint Status Rep. 2 (Mar. 11, 2016) [Dkt. #16], and\nfiled the cross motions for summary judgment now before the Court.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nFOIA requires federal agencies to release government records to the public upon\n\nrequest, subject to nine exemptions See 5 U.S.C. § 552; Murphy v.

Adequacy of the Search\n\nPlaintiffs contest the adequacy of the search conducted by the FBI. “‘When a\n\nplaintiff questions the adequacy of the search an agency made in order to satisfy its FOIA\n\n5\n\nrequest, the factual question it raises is whether the Search was reasonably calculated to\ndiscover the requested documents[.]”’ DiBacco, 795 F.3d at 191-92 (quoting SafeCara’\nServs., Inc. v. SEC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556586\"><a href=\"/opinion/556586/safecard-services-inc-v-securities-and-exchange-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1201 (D.C. Cir. 1991)). It is the agency’s burden “to\nshow that its search efforts were reasonable and logically organized to uncover relevant\ndocuments.” Id. at 191. An agency may meet this burden “by submitting reasonably\ndetailed, nonconclusory affidavits describing its efforts.” Baker & Hostetler LLP v. U.S.\nDep ’t of Commerce, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796441\"><a href=\"/opinion/796441/baker-hostetler-llp-v-united-states-department-of-commerce/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 318 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Such affidavits are “accorded a\npresumption of good faith,” SafeCard, 926 F.2d at 1200, and “[m]ere speculation that as\nyet uncovered documents may exist does not undermine the finding that the agency\nconducted a reasonable search,” Hodge v. FBI, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">703</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 580 (D.C. Cir. 2013)\n(quotation marks omitted).\n\nIn this case, the evidence shows that the FBI conducted a good faith, reasonable\nsearch of the systems of records likely to possess records responsive to plaintiffs’ requests,\nThe Bureau sorted the requests into two groups. “Group l” contained FOIA Request No.\n1319138-000, pertaining to the FBI’s use of HTML links designed to appear as links to\nnews media stories. Hardy Decl. 1111 34~35. “Group 2” contained FOIA Request Nos.\n1319113-000 and 1313504-000, pertaining to the Timberline High School case. Ia’. 1111 34,\n41. The agency attests that it searched the record repositories appropriate for each group\nin a manner designed to uncover responsive records. Id. 1111 34-59; see also Second Decl.\n\nof David M. Hardy 1111 2-9 (“Hardy Supp. Decl.”) [Dkt. #22-2].2 “[B]ecause the sworn\n\n \n\n2 Plaintiffs assert in their combined opposition and reply that defendants cannot rely on the second\ndeclaration of Mr. Hardy because it was not filed with defendants’ motion for summary judgment That\n\n6\n\ndeclarations from the FBI indicate that it conducted ‘reasonably calculated’ searches, the\nburden is on [plaintiffs] to identify specific additional places the agency should now\nsearch.” Hoa’ge, 703 F.3d at 580.\n\nPlaintiffs object to the structure of the FBI’s search, arguing that the agency’s\ndecision to divide their FOIA requests into two groups “resulted in the FBI conducting\nunreasonably narrow and misdirected searches for responsive records.” Pls.’ Mem. of Law\nin Opp. to Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J. and in Supp. of Pls.’ Mot. for Summ. J. and/or Partial\nSumm. J. 14 (“Pls. Mem.”) [Dkt. #19-1]. The FBI contends that the division was necessary\nbecause, “due to the specificity of the FOIA requests, not all of the requests lent themselves\nreadily or naturally to the searches that the FBI routinely conducts in response to FOIA\nrequests.” Hardy Decl. 11 34. In particular, the Bureau was concerned that a search of the\nagency’s Central Records System (“CRS”) would not produce materials responsive to the\nGroup 1 requests because the “CRS indices are not a repository for policy related matters.”\nIa’. 11 36. The agency determined that its Operational Technology Division (“OTD”) was\nlikely to possess the responsive documents, and directed that unit to search its records. Ia'.\n1111 37-40 & n.6; see also Hardy Supp. Decl. 11 4 (explaining “OTD is solely responsible for\nthe deployment and collection of all lawfully conducted electronic surveillance bureau\n\nwide”). Although plaintiffs would have structured the search differently, an agency “need\n\n \n\nassertion is contrary to the practice of courts in this Circuit. See, e.g., Barnard v. DHS, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">598</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">l</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n20 (D.D.C. 2009) (“Based on the present record, which includes the second declaration . . . the Court finds\nthat Defendant has met its burden[.]”); Schoenman v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 176-77 (D.D.C. 2008)\n(similar). The second Hardy declaration is now part of the record, and plaintiffs have responded to its\ncontent. The Court will consider the declaration and plaintiffs’ arguments as appropriate\n\n7\n\nnot knock down every search design advanced by every requester” in order to prevail at\nsummary judgment DiBacco, 795 F.3d at 191.\n\nOn a related note, plaintiffs fault the FBI for its decision not to search the CRS for\ndocuments responsive to the Group l requests, But “[t]he FBI was not required to search\nevery record system; it was only required to conduct a reasonable search of those systems\nof records likely to possess the requested information.” Light v. DOJ, 968 F. Supp. 2d ll,\n25 (D.D.C. 2013) (citing Oglesby v. U.S. Dep ’t ofArmy, 920 F.Zd 57, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1990)).\nThe FBI’s search of the OTD records satisfied this standard because, as explained above,\nthat division was likely to possess the requested information. In any event, the agency\navers that despite its initial determination, it has now conducted a search of the CRS. That\nsearch produced no responsive records. Hardy Supp. Decl. 11 5.\n\nPlaintiffs also criticize the search terms used by the FBI for locating records\nresponsive to the Group 2 requests in the CRS and the Electronic Surveillance (“ELSUR”)\nindices. According to plaintiffs, the keywords used were “deficient” because they\n“relat[ed] solely to the Seattle/Timberline Incident.” Pls.’ Mem. 15~16. But the FBI\nexplains that these terms were necessary because CRS and ELSUR are indexed based on\nspecific individuals, events, and organizations, Hardy Decl. 1111 49, 55, 59, and the\nTirnberline incident was the only specific incident referenced in plaintiffs’ requests, see\nia’., Exs. A (AP letter), K (first RCFP letter), and L (second RCFP letter), As our Circuit\nhas made clear, a search is not rendered inadequate by the suggestion of “additional search\nterms” that, in the requester’s view, the agency “should have used.” DiBacco, 795 F.3d at\n\n191.\n\nPlaintiffs further contend that the search was inadequate because the FBI did not, in\nits response to plaintiffs, specify the cut off dates it used. According to plaintiffs, this\nomission “strongly suggests” that the FBI followed the unreasonable practice of imposing\n“date-of-request” cut offs. Pls.’ Mem. 16. Whatever the merits of this inference, the\nBureau has since clarified that for all searches, it used a “date-of-search” cut off. Hardy\nSupp. Decl. 1111 4~6 & n.4. These cut offs were reasonable. See, e.g., Pub. Citizen v. Dep ’t\nof State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185567\"><a href=\"/opinion/185567/pub-ctzn-v-dos/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">634</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 644 (D.C. Cir. 2002); Schoenmcm v. FBI, No. CIV.A. 04-2202CKK,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">763065</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *18 (D.D.C. Mar. 19, 2009).\n\nFinally, plaintiffs advance a number of arguments speculating that additional\nresponsive documents must exist in light of other publically available records, such as\nnewspaper articles, court filings, and previously released FBI documents. Plaintiffs face\nan uphill climb in this regard. “In general, the adequacy of a search is determined not by\nthe fruits of the search, but by the appropriateness of its methods.” Hoa'ge, 703 F.3d at 579\n(quotation marks and alteration omitted). Nevertheless, I have reviewed the information\nidentified by plaintiffs for “positive indications of overlooked materials.” Valencia~\nLucena v. U.S. Coasl Guard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184876\"><a href=\"/opinion/184876/valencia-lucena-v-us-coast-guard/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 327 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (quotation marks\nomitted). Nothing in these materials persuades me that plaintiffs’ arguments are anything\nmore than “[m]ere speculation that as yet uncovered documents may exist.” Hodge, 703\nF.3d at 580 (quoting Safecard, 926 F.2d at 1201). Accordingly, l conclude the FBI has\n\ncarried its burden to show that its search was adequate.\n\n2. Applicability of FOIA Exemptions\n\nPlaintiffs also contest the applicability of FOIA Exemptions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7(C), and\n7(E), asserted by the FBI as a basis for withholding certain records. “An agency\nwithholding responsive documents from a FOIA release bears the burden of proving the\napplicability ofclaimed exemptions.” ACLUv. DOD, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184071\"><a href=\"/opinion/184071/american-civil-liberties-v-us-dept-of-defense/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\nThis task “is not herculean.” Murphy, 789 F.3d at 209. An agency can meet its burden\n“by submitting affidavits that describe the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably\nspecific detail and demonstrate that the information withheld logically falls within the\nclaimed exemption.” Id. (brackets and quotation marks omitted). “Ultimately, an agency’s\njustification for invoking a FOIA exemption is sufficient if it appears ‘logical’ tor\n‘plausible.”’ ACLU, 628 F.3d at 619 (quotation marks omitted).\n\na. Exemption 1\n\nThe FBI withheld portions of seven pages under FOIA Exemption l, 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(b)(l), which exempts from disclosure properly classified national defense or foreign\npolicy materials In determining whether the government’s invocation of Exemption 1 is\njustified, our Circuit has “consistently deferred to executive affidavits predicting harm to\nthe national security.” Larson v. U.S. Dep’t. ofState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187372\"><a href=\"/opinion/187372/larson-v-department-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 865 (D.C.

Cir. 2003)). Here, the\nFBI provides a sworn affidavit from an original classification authority, David M. Hardy,\nSection Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section of the Records\nManagement Division of the FBI, who reviewed all of the withheld information and affirms\n\nthat it is properly classified pursuant to Executive Order 13526. Hardy Decl. 1111 2, 67_68.\n\n10\n\nHe also affirms that the withheld material contains information pertaining to intelligence\nsources and methods, and that release of this information reasonably could be expected to\ncause serious damage to the national security of the United States, and therefore should be\nand is classified at the “Secret” level. Id. 1111 70, 72; see also Hardy Supp. Decl. 11 ll.\nAccordingly, I will defer to the FBI’s predictive judgment regarding this classified material\nand will not review it in camera or order it disclosed.\n\nb. Exemption 3\n\nThe FBI also withheld material on seven pages under FOIA Exemption 3. As\nrelevant here, the Exemption provides that FOIA’s disclosure obligation “does not apply\nto matters that are . . . specifically exempted from disclosure by [another] statute.” 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(b)(3)(A). To apply the Exemption, the Court must ask: “Does the statute meet\nExemption 3’s requirements? And does the information that was withheld fall within that\nstatute’s coverage?” Labow v. DOJ, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 527 (D.C. Cir. 2016).\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the Bureau has not shown that the information withheld falls\nwithin the coverage of the National Security Act of 1947. The Act, which undoubtedly\nmeets the requirements of Exemption 3, CIA v. Sims, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111410\"><a href=\"/opinion/111410/cia-v-sims/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 167~68 (1985), grants\nthe government “broad authority to protect all sources of intelligence information from\ndisclosure,” ia’. at 169. Mr. Hardy’s affidavit explains that “the FBI’s intelligence sources\nand methods would be revealed if any of the withheld information is disclosed to\n\nPlaintiffs.” Hardy Decl. 11 76. After reviewing the parties’ arguments on this matter, and\n\nll\n\ndeferring to the sworn affidavit as explained above, I am satisfied that the Bureau properly\nwithheld portions of the responsive records under the National Security Act of 1947.3\n\nc. Exemption 5\n\nThe FBI also withheld material under FOIA Exemption 5, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5).\n“Exemption 5 incorporates the traditional privileges that the Government could assert in\ncivil litigation against a private litigant” including “the deliberative process privilege” and\n“the government attorney-client privilege.” Baker & Hostetler, 473 F.3d at 321. The\nBureau asserts these privileges with regard to redacted portions of six pages of emails\nbetween FBI attorneys and other personnel discussing “matters pertaining to the\napplication of an investigative technique,” Hardy Decl. 11 82 & n.28, and of “a report\ncontaining information discussing legal issues regarding the Timberline School\nlnvestigation,” ia’. 11 84 & n.29. Plaintiffs contest the applicability of both privileges.\nAccording to plaintiffs, unredacted portions of these documents show that the information\nwithheld is not “pre-decisional” and thus that the deliberative process privilege cannot\napply. Likewise, they argue, the documents bear no indicia of confidentiality and thus the\ngovernment attorney-client privilege cannot apply.\n\n1 conclude that both exemptions apply. The unredacted portions of the email\nmessages, submitted by plaintiffs, show that agency personnel were discussing changes to,\nand legal review of, an application for a search warrant before submitting it to a court. See\n\nDecl. of Katie Townsend, Ex. Q [Dkt. #19-25]. Such information is both pre-decisional\n\n \n\n3 In light of this holding, and my holding concerning Exemption 7(E), infra, I find it unnecessary to\naddress the parties’ arguments concerning the applicability of Exemption 3 to information obtained\npursuant to the federal statute addressing pen registers and trap and trace devices, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3123-27.\n\n12\n\nand privileged See, e.g., Soghoian v. DOJ, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 73-74 (D.D.C. 2012)\n(holding FBI properly withheld “emails among attorneys discussing particular search\nwarrants and investigations” and “draft language regarding guidance” on same). And in\nregard to the report on the Timberline investigation, the supplemental declaration provided\nby the FBI clarifies that the redacted material “concerns opinions and recommendation[s]\nof an advisory nature about FBI authority and policy evaluated in light of the Timberline\ninvestigation, but not adopted by the agency as final policy.” Hardy Supp. Decl. 11 18.\nThus, this information, too, was properly withheld. See, e.g., Elec. Froniier Founa’. v. DOJ,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">739</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">l</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8-9 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (affirming withholding of advisory material).\n\nd. Exemption 6 and 7(C)\n\nThe FBI also withheld names and identifying information of federal and state law\nenforcement and support personnel under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C). “FOIA\nExemptions 6 and 7(C) seek to protect the privacy of individuals identified in certain\nagency records.” ACLU v. DOJ, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">655</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">l</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Exemption 6 protects\n“personnel and medical files and similar files” when disclosure “would constitute a clearly\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6). Exemption 7(C) protects\n“records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes” when disclosure “could\nreasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” Ia’.\n§ 552(b)(7)(C). Both Exemptions require the Court to balance “the privacy interests that\nwould be compromised by disclosure against the public interest in release of the requested\n\ninformation.” Light, 968 F. Supp. 2d at 28 (quotation marks omitted).\n\n13\n\nThe FBI starts from a strong position. Courts in our Circuit have repeatedly held\nthat law enforcement and support personnel have an “extremely strong privacy interest” in\nnot having their identifying information disclosed in connection with any particular\ninvestigative matter. Brown v. FBI, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404 (D.D.C. 2012); see also\nHoa’ge, 703 F.3d at 580; Lesar v. DOJ, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">636</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (“[T]hese agents\nhave a legitimate interest in preserving the secrecy of matters that conceivably could\nsubject them to annoyance or harassment in either their official or private lives.”). The FBI\nhas invoked that weighty interest here, Hardy Decl. 1111 87-89, 92, and plaintiffs offer little\nto counterbalance it. To be sure, plaintiffs assert that production of the records they seek\n“will inform the public as to whether the FBI followed its own internal guidelines in the\nSeattle case and in other cases.” Pls.’ Mem. 39. But they do not explain what, if anything,\nthe disclosure of information identifying individual government employees would add to\ninforming the public. “In the absence of a legitimate public interest, the private interest in\navoiding harassment or violence tilts the Scales.” Jua’icial Walch, lnc. v. FDA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186713\"><a href=\"/opinion/186713/jud-watch-inc-v-fda/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 153 (D.C. Cir. 2006). The Bureau properly withheld this information.\n\nd. Exemption 7(E)\n\nFOIA Exemption 7(E) protects “records or information compiled for law\nenforcement purposes” when production “would disclose techniques and procedures for\nlaw enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law\nenforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected\nto risk circumvention of the law.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E). “Exemption 7(E) sets a\nrelatively low bar for the agency to justify withholding: ‘Rather than requiring a highly\n\n14\n\nspecific burden of showing how the law will be circumvented, exemption 7(E) only\nrequires that the [FBI] demonstrate logically how the release of the requested information\nmight create a risk of circumvention of the law.”’ Blackwell v. FBI, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"220173\"><a href=\"/opinion/220173/blackwell-v-fbi/\"><span class=\"volume\">646</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 42 (D.C.\nCir. 2011) (quoting Mayer Brown LLP v. IRS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187345\"><a href=\"/opinion/187345/mayer-brown-llp-v-irs/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1194 (D.C. Cir. 2009)).\nUnder this standard, an agency “is not required to describe secret law enforcement\ntechniques, even generally, if the description would reveal the very information sought to\nbe withheld.” Light, 968 F. Supp. 2d at 29.\n\nHere, the FBI invokes Exemption 7(E) with respect to six kinds of information: (1)\noperational directives; (2) records pertaining to a specific undercover operation; (3) internal\nFBI secure fax and phone numbers; (4) details concerning deployments of CIPAVs; (5)\ndetails about certain targets of pen registers and trap and trace devices; and (6) collection\nand analysis methods. In regard to each category, the FBI has credibly and thoroughly\nexplained how release of the information in question might create a risk of circumvention\nof the law. Hardy Decl. 1111 94-103; Hardy Supp. Decl. 1111 22~27. Although plaintiffs\ndemand that the Bureau describe in greater detail the nature of the records it withheld, I\nfind that the agency has justified its withholdings because it has “logically explain[ed]”\nhow the information could help criminals circumvent the law. Blackwell, 646 F.3d at 42.\n\n3. Segregation of Records\n\nFinally, plaintiffs contest the FBI’s segregation of responsive records. Under FOIA,\n“even if an agency establishes an exemption, it must nonetheless disclose all reasonably\nsegregable, nonexempt portions of the requested record(S).” Assassl`nation Archives, 334\nF.3d at 58. “Agencies are entitled to a presumption that they complied with the obligation\n\n15\n\nto disclose reasonably segregable material.” Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186972\"><a href=\"/opinion/186972/sussman-v-us-marshals-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1117 (D.C. Cir. 2007). Plaintiffs argue that the FBI has inadequately explained why\nit could not reasonably segregate and disclose additional material. As noted above,\nexcluding duplicates, the Bureau withheld 59 pages in full and 103 pages in part. The\nagency affirms that it “individually examined” every page “line by line.” Hardy Decl.\n11 104. Material that was withheld was either exempt from disclosure or was so intertwined\nwith protected material that segregation Was not possible without foreseeable harm. See\nid. 11 105; Hardy Supp. Decl, Ex. A (Vaughn index) [Dkt. #22-3]. Upon review of the FBI’s\ndeclarations and Vaughn index, I conclude that the Bureau has fulfilled its duty to be “as\nspecific as possible without actually disclosing information that deserves protection.”\nAssassination Archives, 334 F.3d at 58 n.3 (quotation marks omitted).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will GRANT Defendants’ Motion for Summary\nJudgment, will DENY Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and/or Partial Summary\nJudgment, and will DENY Plaintiffs’ Motion for In Camera Review and/or Other\nAppropriate Relief. An Order consistent with this decision accompanies this\n\nMemorandum Opinion.\n\n/\nRICHARD .LEO\nUnited State ist `ct Judge\n\n \n\n16\n\n</pre>",
