At that time, the then totally segregated system enrolled 4300 black and 1500 white children.  The latest semi-annual report of the Wilcox County School Board (School Board) discloses that at the opening of the Fall 1973 session the system enrolled 3,733 black and 109 white students.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  All but four of the white students in the system now attend Wilcox County High School.  The system's subsequent history discloses a rapidly declining white enrollment.  Economically the county is among the nation's poorest, and some of the impediments to achieving a unitary school system are directly attributable to fiscal disabilities under a system of financing in which declining enrollment and lack of local effort reduce state funding.  The present appeal was initiated by the United States, the original plaintiff in the litigation, after the district court's order and report dated September 26, 1973.  The United States urges error in the district court's imposition of a minority to minority transfer policy, its refusal to implement the plan submitted by the Title IV Center of the University of South Alabama (Title IV Center) insofar as this plan called for the consolidation of the formerly all-white and all-black schools in the Camden attendance area, and the court's refusal to create a countywide Advisory Committee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appeal has also been taken by the plaintiff-intervenors (a group comprised of national churchmen, teachers students and parents of students in the school system).  These intervenors raise the same three contentions as are advanced by the United States.  In addition, they urge as error the district court's failure to order back pay relief for certain defense and emergency certified teachers whose contracts were not renewed, the refusal to adopt the Title IV Center's transportation plan, the failure to require immediare action to accomplish the matters covered in our mandate of January 10, 1972, the failure to prohibit the charging of janitorial fees to students, the refusal on financial grounds to order full implementation of the Title IV Center plan and to appoint a receiver, the failure to adopt findings of fact and conclusions of law, the failure to require the defendant Alabama State Department of Education to provide professional and economic assistance to the School Board and the postponement of the entry of an order requiring the payment of legal fees to the attorney representing the intervenors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These appeals were collectively docketed as Cause No. 73-3543 and were consolidated with the prior and still pending appeal, Cause No. 71-3018.  This court held a prehearing conference pursuant to FRAP 33.  Subsequently the parties filed supplemental briefs and reached agreement on the issue of attorneys' fees; this issue has now been resolved and is embodied in a decree of this court entered on February 25, 1974.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 7, 1972 the district court entered an order pursuant to this court's mandate of January 10, 1972 which directed the School Boars to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) desegregate the faculty and staff of the district pursuant to Singleton v.

The remaining recommendations of the Title IV Center report filed on June 28, 1973 relating to school district consolidations and pupil assignments were adopted by the court.  The School Board was ordered annually to file copies of its operating budget and property inventory with the court.  School principals were ordered to account properly for funds.  The School Board was prohibited from making capital expenditures without prior court approval.  The School Board was ordered to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) report new funds and fund sources to the court;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) make teacher assignments pursuant to Singleton;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) provide janitorial service, maintenance and upkeep for each school;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) adopt the Title IV Center's suggested Handbook of Student Rights;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) evidence its overall intent to comply with all Title IV Center recommendations, except as to Camden area consolidations and as to the creation and utilization of a countywide advisory council.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order prohibited the introduction of dogs or weapons upon school campuses, and enjoined all parties to seek outside financial assistance for the system and pretermitted ruling on attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE MAINTENANCE OF DUAL SCHOOLS IN THE CAMDEN AREA AND THE INSTITUTION OF A MINORITY TO MINORITY STUDENT TRANSFER POLICY</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, in the face of a preponderant black student majority and a white student exodus, sought to preserve some semblance of racial integration by permitting the relative handful of white students to elect to concentrate themselves in a formerly all-white facility-- the Wilcox County High School.  To accomplish this the court established parallel educational institutions at Camden Academy and at Wilcox County High School, both located within a mile of each other in the Camden attendance area, and by permitting the privilege of transfer to white students only.  Such an approach is not without some precedent.  See, Singleton, supra, 419 F.2d at 1221 (St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana).  In this case this court, en banc, found it unnecessary to require the division of a small number of minority whites amongst five schools in one portion of a predominantly black school system.  However, neither the physical situations of the two school districts nor the remedies utilized by the court there and here are sufficiently similar to warrant affirmance.  St. John the Baptist Parish is divided by the Mississippi River.  Its East bank schools were operated by the district on an integrated basis.  The district court permitted West bank students to exercise freedom of choice in selection the school they wished to attend.  In contrast, the record here indicates that the Wilcox County School Board has yet to demonstrate objectively its will to operate this system in a manner calculated to remedy past discriminatory practices and achieve unitary status.  In Wilcox County, the minority to minority transfer provision imposes a condition which is racially biased in every respect except literal appellation.  If and when this School Board removes itself from the shadow of contempt, the district court may then consider whether a racially neutral freedom of choice plan could be of benefit in bringing about a unitary system.  Because that day has not yet arrived, the district court erred in rejecting the general concept of the plan submitted by the Title IV Center for the consolidation of the Camden area schools, and in adopting a minority to minority transfer provision.  There portions of the order appealed from are reversed.  The district court is directed to implement the Title IV Center recommendations for Camden area schools effective at the commencement of the Fall 1974 school term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">COUNTYWIDE ADVISORY COUNCIL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Believing that the school system was 'over-committeed' and seeing no benefit from the creation of another school-related group, the district court rejected the Title IV Center's recommendation for the creation of an advisory committee drawn from the entire county.  This court is advised that each school is now served by trustees who, under Alabama law, represent the interests of the school in general and who deal with the School Board in general matters regarding their particular school.  Most, if not all, of the schools in the system also utilize the traditional parent-teacher organizations, which also function on an individual school basis.  The record evidence of poor relationships and lack of communication between teachers, students and their parents on the one hand and the School Board on the other, of open official encouragement of whites to frustrate unitary goals, and the fact that the district court considered it necessary to enjoin the School Board to permit the non-discriminatory function of parent-teacher associations as late as May of 1973, all operate to persuade this court that school trustees and parent-teacher organizations are not viable substitutes for a system-wide group chosen by the court to affect liaison between the community, school officials and the court in the manner prescribed in Singleton, Ellis and Hinds County, supra.  The district court is directed to create such a group promptly upon the remand of this case.  Should the district court determine that the type of committee envisioned in the recommendation of the Title IV Center would be superior to a typical biracial committee, it may choose to implement that portion of their plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">STATUS OF DEFENSE AND EMERGENCY CERTIFIED TEACHERS</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This issue raised by the intervenors was initially dealt with by the district court's decree of October 5, 1972.  The United States represents that it was subsequently the subject of correspondence from the court to counsel on April 20, 1973, and that, on August 22, 1973, it filed a memorandum containing certain financial information in compliance with the court's request.  The parties are presently under a directive from the district court to prepare an additional consent decree on this issue.  The matter is one which should be resolved by the district court in the first instance.  We do, however, note that the United States continues to contend that six other black teachers were discriminatorily dismissed in November 1971.  We are confident that the entire area of discriminatory teacher and staff dismissals and pay entitlement, which was a matter covered by our 1972 remand, will have the careful attention of the district court.  We decline to require the entry of any specific order on this matter in the present appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">THE TITLE IV CENTER'S TRANSPORTATION PLAN</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its order of March 7, 1972 the district court expressly ordered the reexamination and reconstitution of the School Board's transportation system under Singleton, supra.  In its order of September 26, 1973 it clearly indicated approval of the concepts contained in the Title IV Center plan and provided that compliance with the court's mandate would be measured by the amount of implementation of the Title IV Center plan which the School Board could achieve.  As with teacher and staff discrimination problems, solution of the complex problems interwoven into the creation and operation of an efficient non-discriminatory transportation system for Wilcox County schools must be the responsibility of the district court in the first instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FIXING SPECIFIC TIMES FOR ACCOMPLISHMENT OF DESEGREGATION GOALS</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here again it is for the district court to determine whether the adoption of a timetable is a worthwhile step in dealing with the myriad problems of desegregating the Wilcox County School system.  On the basis of the present record, we are not convinced that the district court is unwilling or unable to require compliance with the time-urgency mandate of Alexander v. Holmes County, 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19 (1969).  We decline to require the adoption of such a timetable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">STUDENT FEES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present record is without evidence indicating that students are being assessed fees for the 1973-74 school year.  Such assessments were specifically enjoined by the district court's order of October 5, 1972.  Paragraph 12 of the order of September 26, 1973 requiring the School Board to provide janitorial service, does not provide for the collection of any student fees and none may be collected.  The assessment of any course fees except those which have been traditional with this school system, was enjoined by the consent decree of October 5, 1972.  The terms of that order are correct and are sufficient to cover the claims advanced here.  Any asserted violations should be considered by the court below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION OF TITLE IV CENTER PLANS AND APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not interpret the district court's order of September 26, 1973 to require any less than the fullest possible implementation of the Title IV Center plan (except as discussed first above) which the financial resources of the county and system will permit.  Plan implementation is made the standard for School Board compliance with the spirit of the court's decree.  The desirability of further specific relief as to particular portions of the plan should be addressed to the court below.  The record does not demonstrate any inability of the district court to discharge its judicial functions in this cause without the assistance of supporting personnel in the form of a receiver or some type of special master.  No finding to this effect has been made.

While some of these areas are now moot, there does appear to be a desirability, if not a necessity, for the court to enter findings and conclusions as to some of these areas and others discussed on the present appeal.  An order by the district court making specific fact determinations on the issues now pending should be made to provide for this cause the bench marks essential to charging a course which will bring this litigation to the most prompt, just determination possible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DIRECTIONS TO THE DEFENDANT, ALABAMA STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL AND ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THE WILCOX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its order of October 5, 1972 the court ordered the State department of Education to assist the School Board as to matters of accreditation.  In its order of May 15, 1973 the State Board and the State Superintendent of Education were ordered to comment on the educational desirability of the Health, Education and Welfare plan and to recommend alternatives.  The order of September 26 enjoins all parties to seek outside financial assistance and to assist the Board with other financially related efforts.  The Board has taken the position that its direct financial involvement is limited by Alabama law to allocation of funds based upon average daily attendance and that it has no authority to make 'a special case' of Wilcox County.

At that time, the then totally segregated system enrolled 4300 black and 1500 white children.  The latest semi-annual report of the Wilcox County School Board (School Board) discloses that at the opening of the Fall 1973 session the system enrolled 3,733 black and 109 white students.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  All but four of the white students in the system now attend Wilcox County High School.  The system's subsequent history discloses a rapidly declining white enrollment.  Economically the county is among the nation's poorest, and some of the impediments to achieving a unitary school system are directly attributable to fiscal disabilities under a system of financing in which declining enrollment and lack of local effort reduce state funding.  The present appeal was initiated by the United States, the original plaintiff in the litigation, after the district court's order and report dated September 26, 1973.  The United States urges error in the district court's imposition of a minority to minority transfer policy, its refusal to implement the plan submitted by the Title IV Center of the University of South Alabama (Title IV Center) insofar as this plan called for the consolidation of the formerly all-white and all-black schools in the Camden attendance area, and the court's refusal to create a countywide Advisory Committee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appeal has also been taken by the plaintiff-intervenors (a group comprised of national churchmen, teachers students and parents of students in the school system).  These intervenors raise the same three contentions as are advanced by the United States.  In addition, they urge as error the district court's failure to order back pay relief for certain defense and emergency certified teachers whose contracts were not renewed, the refusal to adopt the Title IV Center's transportation plan, the failure to require immediare action to accomplish the matters covered in our mandate of January 10, 1972, the failure to prohibit the charging of janitorial fees to students, the refusal on financial grounds to order full implementation of the Title IV Center plan and to appoint a receiver, the failure to adopt findings of fact and conclusions of law, the failure to require the defendant Alabama State Department of Education to provide professional and economic assistance to the School Board and the postponement of the entry of an order requiring the payment of legal fees to the attorney representing the intervenors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These appeals were collectively docketed as Cause No. 73-3543 and were consolidated with the prior and still pending appeal, Cause No. 71-3018.

To accomplish this the court established parallel educational institutions at Camden Academy and at Wilcox County High School, both located within a mile of each other in the Camden attendance area, and by permitting the privilege of transfer to white students only.  Such an approach is not without some precedent.  See, Singleton, supra, 419 F.2d at 1221 (St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana).  In this case this court, en banc, found it unnecessary to require the division of a small number of minority whites amongst five schools in one portion of a predominantly black school system.  However, neither the physical situations of the two school districts nor the remedies utilized by the court there and here are sufficiently similar to warrant affirmance.  St. John the Baptist Parish is divided by the Mississippi River.  Its East bank schools were operated by the district on an integrated basis.  The district court permitted West bank students to exercise freedom of choice in selection the school they wished to attend.  In contrast, the record here indicates that the Wilcox County School Board has yet to demonstrate objectively its will to operate this system in a manner calculated to remedy past discriminatory practices and achieve unitary status.  In Wilcox County, the minority to minority transfer provision imposes a condition which is racially biased in every respect except literal appellation.  If and when this School Board removes itself from the shadow of contempt, the district court may then consider whether a racially neutral freedom of choice plan could be of benefit in bringing about a unitary system.  Because that day has not yet arrived, the district court erred in rejecting the general concept of the plan submitted by the Title IV Center for the consolidation of the Camden area schools, and in adopting a minority to minority transfer provision.  There portions of the order appealed from are reversed.  The district court is directed to implement the Title IV Center recommendations for Camden area schools effective at the commencement of the Fall 1974 school term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">COUNTYWIDE ADVISORY COUNCIL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Believing that the school system was 'over-committeed' and seeing no benefit from the creation of another school-related group, the district court rejected the Title IV Center's recommendation for the creation of an advisory committee drawn from the entire county.  This court is advised that each school is now served by trustees who, under Alabama law, represent the interests of the school in general and who deal with the School Board in general matters regarding their particular school.  Most, if not all, of the schools in the system also utilize the traditional parent-teacher organizations, which also function on an individual school basis.  The record evidence of poor relationships and lack of communication between teachers, students and their parents on the one hand and the School Board on the other, of open official encouragement of whites to frustrate unitary goals, and the fact that the district court considered it necessary to enjoin the School Board to permit the non-discriminatory function of parent-teacher associations as late as May of 1973, all operate to persuade this court that school trustees and parent-teacher organizations are not viable substitutes for a system-wide group chosen by the court to affect liaison between the community, school officials and the court in the manner prescribed in Singleton, Ellis and Hinds County, supra.  The district court is directed to create such a group promptly upon the remand of this case.  Should the district court determine that the type of committee envisioned in the recommendation of the Title IV Center would be superior to a typical biracial committee, it may choose to implement that portion of their plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">STATUS OF DEFENSE AND EMERGENCY CERTIFIED TEACHERS</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This issue raised by the intervenors was initially dealt with by the district court's decree of October 5, 1972.  The United States represents that it was subsequently the subject of correspondence from the court to counsel on April 20, 1973, and that, on August 22, 1973, it filed a memorandum containing certain financial information in compliance with the court's request.  The parties are presently under a directive from the district court to prepare an additional consent decree on this issue.  The matter is one which should be resolved by the district court in the first instance.  We do, however, note that the United States continues to contend that six other black teachers were discriminatorily dismissed in November 1971.  We are confident that the entire area of discriminatory teacher and staff dismissals and pay entitlement, which was a matter covered by our 1972 remand, will have the careful attention of the district court.  We decline to require the entry of any specific order on this matter in the present appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">THE TITLE IV CENTER'S TRANSPORTATION PLAN</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its order of March 7, 1972 the district court expressly ordered the reexamination and reconstitution of the School Board's transportation system under Singleton, supra.  In its order of September 26, 1973 it clearly indicated approval of the concepts contained in the Title IV Center plan and provided that compliance with the court's mandate would be measured by the amount of implementation of the Title IV Center plan which the School Board could achieve.  As with teacher and staff discrimination problems, solution of the complex problems interwoven into the creation and operation of an efficient non-discriminatory transportation system for Wilcox County schools must be the responsibility of the district court in the first instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FIXING SPECIFIC TIMES FOR ACCOMPLISHMENT OF DESEGREGATION GOALS</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here again it is for the district court to determine whether the adoption of a timetable is a worthwhile step in dealing with the myriad problems of desegregating the Wilcox County School system.  On the basis of the present record, we are not convinced that the district court is unwilling or unable to require compliance with the time-urgency mandate of Alexander v. Holmes County, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107993\"><a href=\"/opinion/107993/alexander-v-holmes-county-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107993\"><a href=\"/opinion/107993/alexander-v-holmes-county-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span> (1969).  We decline to require the adoption of such a timetable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">STUDENT FEES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present record is without evidence indicating that students are being assessed fees for the 1973-74 school year.  Such assessments were specifically enjoined by the district court's order of October 5, 1972.  Paragraph 12 of the order of September 26, 1973 requiring the School Board to provide janitorial service, does not provide for the collection of any student fees and none may be collected.  The assessment of any course fees except those which have been traditional with this school system, was enjoined by the consent decree of October 5, 1972.  The terms of that order are correct and are sufficient to cover the claims advanced here.  Any asserted violations should be considered by the court below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION OF TITLE IV CENTER PLANS AND APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not interpret the district court's order of September 26, 1973 to require any less than the fullest possible implementation of the Title IV Center plan (except as discussed first above) which the financial resources of the county and system will permit.  Plan implementation is made the standard for School Board compliance with the spirit of the court's decree.  The desirability of further specific relief as to particular portions of the plan should be addressed to the court below.  The record does not demonstrate any inability of the district court to discharge its judicial functions in this cause without the assistance of supporting personnel in the form of a receiver or some type of special master.  No finding to this effect has been made.  Until that court considers and decides the issue, any directive by this court to take such action would be premature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FAILURE TO MAKE FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The January 10, 1972 mandate of this court directed the district court to supplement the record in this case with findings of fact and conclusions of law as to whether maintenance and equipment were being handled by the district on a non-discriminatory basis, whether student expulsions and suspensions and textbook distribution were non-discriminatory, whether the School Board had discriminated in discharging, hiring or promotion of faculty or staff, and the manner in which actual pupil results under the court's plan compared with the attendance projected under the plan initially submitted by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.  While some of these areas are now moot, there does appear to be a desirability, if not a necessity, for the court to enter findings and conclusions as to some of these areas and others discussed on the present appeal.  An order by the district court making specific fact determinations on the issues now pending should be made to provide for this cause the bench marks essential to charging a course which will bring this litigation to the most prompt, just determination possible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DIRECTIONS TO THE DEFENDANT, ALABAMA STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL AND ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THE WILCOX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its order of October 5, 1972 the court ordered the State department of Education to assist the School Board as to matters of accreditation.  In its order of May 15, 1973 the State Board and the State Superintendent of Education were ordered to comment on the educational desirability of the Health, Education and Welfare plan and to recommend alternatives.  The order of September 26 enjoins all parties to seek outside financial assistance and to assist the Board with other financially related efforts.  The Board has taken the position that its direct financial involvement is limited by Alabama law to allocation of funds based upon average daily attendance and that it has no authority to make 'a special case' of Wilcox County.  Without prejudice to further consideration of the need for specific relief of this type, we decline to require action in this regard now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order appealed from is in part affirmed, in part reversed, and the cause is remanded for further consideration not inconsistent with this order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed, in part; reversed, in part; and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The school by school enrollment is as follows:</p>\n        <pre>                               Non-White  White\n                               ---------  -----\nALBERTA (B)                       120         0\nBOYKIN (B)                        178         0\nCAMDEN ACADEMY\n (GRADES 1-6) (B)                 310         0\nCAMDEN ACADEMY\n (GRADES 7-12) (B)                646         0\nMOORE ACADEMY\n (W)                              365         1\nPINE HILL CONSOLIDATED\n (GRADES 1-4) (B)                 361         2\nPINE HILL CONSOLIDATED\n (GRADES 5-8) (B)                 395         1\nPINE HILL HIGH\n SCHOOL (W)                       345         0\nTATES CHAPEL\n SCHOOL (B)                       174         0\nWILCOX COUNTY\n SCHOOL (W)                       466       105\nWILCOX COUNTY\n TRAINING\n SCHOOL (B)                       177         0\nWILLIAM J.
