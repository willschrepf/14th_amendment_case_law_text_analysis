This opinion is consistent with his\nvote at the panel's conference following oral argument on June 9, 1997.\n      2\n       The Honorable Jean C. Hamilton, Chief Judge, United States District Court for\nthe Eastern District of Missouri.\n\fupon\n\n\n\n\n       -2-\n\fa jury verdict in favor of Dr. Fred King, a former MCC\nphysician, and Anthony Gammon, superintendent of MCC. We\naffirm.\n\n                          I.\n\n    On October 24, 1991, Keeper submitted a medical\nservices request (MSR), complaining of headaches and\nblurred vision, but failed to appear for sick call. On\nOctober 28 Keeper complained of dizziness, abdominal pain,\nand blurred    vision and was examined by a nurse, who\ndiagnosed a likely muscle strain, prescribed Motrin, and\ntold Keeper to return the next morning. On October 29\nKeeper was examined by Dr. Hampton, who referred him to\nan ophthalmologist. On November 11 Keeper submitted an\nMSR, complaining of blurred vision and right eye and head\npain, but again failed to appear for sick call.         On\nNovember 18 Keeper, complaining of left-sided numbness,\nblurred vision, pain in the right eye, weakness, and an\ninability to stand at times, was again examined by Dr.\nHampton, who prescribed Elavil for headaches and ordered\na psychological examination, including testing.\n\n    On December 30 Keeper submitted two MSRs. At 4:20\np.m. he complained of headaches and blurred vision. A\nnurse examined and released him. At 6:00 p.m. he noted\nthat he had run out of Elavil and that his pain had\nreturned.    He requested a complete physical \"before\nsomething seriously does go wrong\" and also submitted a\nletter detailing his complaints of headaches, blurred\nvision, and left-sided weakness and numbness. Later that\nday, King reviewed Keeper's medical records and renewed\nhis prescription for Elavil. On January 1, 1992, Keeper\n\n                            -3-\n\fsubmitted another MSR, claiming his condition was worse\nand that he had had \"mild strokes off and on.\" On January\n2 Keeper was brought to the medical unit on a stretcher,\ncomplaining of difficulty standing, dizziness, headaches,\nand numbness. King examined him, but found \"no medical\nproblem\" and ordered that Keeper complete psychological\ntesting. Although Keeper walked out of the unit on his\nown, he was brought back by a guard a few minutes later\nbecause he could not stand.       King did not reexamine\nKeeper. However,\n\n\n\n\n                           -4-\n\fKeeper was placed in administrative segregation for\nmedical observation. As a routine matter, a nurse looked\nin on Keeper four times a day. He was also seen by a\nnurse on at least three other occasions, including January\n17, when he was found lying on the floor unable to move.\nAfter returning to his regular cell on January 21, he was\nagain found lying on the floor and was admitted to the\ninfirmary for overnight observation.     The next morning\nKeeper stated he was feeling fine and was discharged.\n\n    Keeper did not request or receive medical services\nagain until Saturday, February 29, when he was brought to\nthe medical unit after he was found sitting on a toilet\nunable to move or speak. A nurse called the MCC health\ncare supervisor, Debra Williams, who was at home.\nWilliams instructed the nurse to admit Keeper to the\ninfirmary, check his vital and neurological signs every\nhour, and contact King. Although nurses tried to reach\nKing by telephone several times on February 29, King, who\ndid not carry a pager, was finally reached on March 1 at\nnoon. King did not come to the infirmary, but instructed\nthe staff to observe Keeper. At 3:00 p.m. that day Keeper\nwas found lying on the floor wet with urine. His clothes\nwere changed and his mattress was placed on the floor. He\nwas found on the mattress wet with urine on Monday, March\n2, at 1:30 a.m and 6:30 a.m. At 7:35 a.m. King came to\nthe infirmary and examined Keeper. Although the doctor\nfound \"no apparent neurological defect\" and gave a\nprovisional diagnosis of conversion hysteria, King\ntransferred Keeper to a hospital to rule out an\nobstruction in the brain.     At the hospital a CAT scan\nrevealed that Keeper had had a large stroke to the right\nside of the brain. An examining doctor noted that the\n\n                            -5-\n\fslow progression of the stroke was \"a little unusual.\"\n\n    Keeper filed an action under 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 against\nKing and Gammon, alleging that they had been deliberately\nindifferent to his serious medical needs, in violation of\nthe Eighth Amendment.    At trial, Keeper, who was then\nforty-one years old, testified that he could no longer\nuse his left arm or leg, had difficulty speaking and\nseeing, and that his condition had worsened since the\nstroke. In addition to introducing the medical records,\nKeeper also presented the testimony of Debra Williams and\nDr. Peter Lewitt, a neurologist.\n\n    Williams testified that although King was the full-\ntime physician and Hampton was the part-time physician on\nthe medical unit staff, as health care supervisor she had\nthe over-all responsibility for the medical unit, and, in\nthe event of an emergency, could order an inmate's\ntransfer to a hospital.       Although Williams was not\ninvolved in the day-to-day treatment of patients, she\nstated she was familiar with Keeper's case. In November\n1991 she had reviewed his records and discussed his\ncondition with her staff after Gammon had informed her\nthat Keeper's mother had contacted him regarding Keeper's\ncondition. After her review, Williams reported to Gammon\nthat Keeper was being monitored. She was also aware that\nGammon had informed the unit that Keeper's mother had\nagain inquired about his condition on December 29.\nAccording to Williams, by mid-January Keeper's symptoms\nhad become consistent with transient ischemic attacks\n(TIA), which are brief neurological attacks that could be\nprecursors to a stroke.\n\n\n\n                           -6-\n\f    As to the events of February 29 to March 2, Williams\ntestified that she was at home when she received a call\nfrom a nurse informing her that Keeper had been brought to\nthe unit because he had difficulty moving his left leg and\ncould not move his left arm. Williams returned to work on\nMarch 2 and examined Keeper. Williams testified that she\nwas ''shocked\" that King had found \"no apparent\nneurological defect\" during his examination, because her\nexamination revealed that Keeper had facial drooping,\nhalting and slurred speech, and a limp left arm.\n\n    On cross-examination, Williams admitted that on\nFebruary 29 she had instructed her staff to call her at\nhome if they could not reach King or if Keeper's condition\nhad changed, but that no one called her. Williams also\nstated that she was aware that a list of physicians who\nwere on call was posted on a bulletin board in the medical\nunit, but admitted that she had never called a doctor on\nthe list and did not know how the list was to be used.\n\n    Dr. Lewitt, who practices and teaches neurology in\nMichigan, testified by video-taped deposition. He stated\nthat risk factors for a stroke were high blood pressure\nand an abnormal heart rhythm and that symptoms of a stroke\nincluded numbness, but generally not a headache. Based on\nhis review of     Keeper's medical records, Dr. Lewitt\nbelieved that as of December 30, 1991, Keeper presented a\nmedical emergency, and that a brain scan would have been\nappropriate. The doctor stated that on February 29 Keeper\nhad a stroke, and King's order to observe was an\ninappropriate response.    Lewitt believed that Keeper's\nstroke had progressed slowly, and that had it been\ndiagnosed and treated earlier there was a possibility that\n\n                            -7-\n\fsome of the effects of the stroke could have been\nprevented. In sum, the doctor believed that there was \"a\nmajor neglect of a treatable neurological condition.\"\n\n    Gammon testified that as superintendent of MCC he was\nresponsible for the over-all operation of the MCC, but\nthat he had no medical training or expertise.      Gammon\nstated that although he knew Keeper's name, he was not\npersonally familiar with him and had never received a\ngrievance or letter concerning Keeper's care.      Gammon\nstated that when he or his office had received telephone\ninquiries from Keeper's mother, the inquiries were\nreferred to Williams because she was responsible for the\noperation of the infirmary.\n\n    King, who at the time of trial was employed by the\nIowa Department of Corrections, testified that it was a\nnurse's responsibility to refer a patient to a physician,\nand in an emergency, if a nurse could not reach a doctor,\nthe nurse or the health care supervisor could order a\ntransfer of the inmate to a hospital. King admitted he\ndid not carry a pager, but explained that, although he\nvolunteered to see patients on nights and weekends, he was\nnot on call twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.\nInstead, he stated five to six physicians were on call.\nKing believed that he had treated Keeper's symptoms\nappropriately   and   explained   that  he   had   ordered\npsychological testing because some of Keeper's symptoms\ncould have been caused by a conversion hysteria,\n\n\n\n\n                            -8-\n\fa process whereby a person converts a mental problem into\nan actual physical problem, or by malingering, whereby a\nperson \"fakes\" symptoms. According to King, malingering\nwas a common problem in prison.      King stated that he\nreported that Keeper had \"no apparent neurological defect\"\non March 2 because physical examination revealed \"no\nevidence of pathological neurological signs,\" such as a\npositive Babinski response, deep tendon reflex, or ankle\nclonus.\n\n    King also presented the testimony of Dr. Michael\nHatlelid, a neurologist in private practice in St. Louis,\nMissouri, and on the faculty of a local medical school.\nThe doctor, who in the year before trial had treated three\nhundred stroke patients and three to four hundred headache\npatients, testified about the differences in symptoms\nbetween a TIA and a migraine headache. According to the\ndoctor, symptoms of a TIA were numbness on one side of the\nbody, double vision, blindness, and vertigo, but not as a\ngeneral rule dizziness and blurred vision. Symptoms of a\nmigraine headache were throbbing head pain, nausea,\nblurred vision, and numbness.    Dr. Hatlelid also noted\nthat, other than cigarette smoking, Keeper did not present\nthe major risk factors for stroke, such as high blood\npressure, blood clotting problems, heart disease, or\ndiabetes.\n    Although Dr. Hatlelid believed that before February\n29 Keeper's symptoms had been consistent with migraine\nheadaches, nonetheless the doctor testified that around\nmid-January   he   would   have  ordered   an   ultrasound\nexamination to determine whether there was an abnormality\nin the carotid artery in Keeper's neck. If the ultrasound\nshowed a significant abnormality, the doctor would have\n\n                            -9-\n\fperformed an angiogram of the artery to determine whether\nthere was a surgically correctable condition. However,\nDr. Hatlelid stated that had an ultrasound been performed\nin January, it would have been normal, since a March 3\nultrasound examination was essentially normal, showing\nonly \"minimal atherosclerotic disease of the carotid\nartery with a 0-19 percent diameter reduction of the\ninternal artery.\" The doctor also noted that additional\ntesting at the hospital failed to reveal the cause of the\nstroke.    Thus, according to the doctor, \"the fact\nadditional workup was not done in January 1992 ha[d] no\npractical significance.\"\n\n\n\n\n                           -10-\n\fBased on his review of the medical records, Dr. Hatlelid\nexpressed the opinion that Keeper did not have a series of\nstrokes, but had one single catastrophic stroke on\nFebruary 29, which was caused by a dissection, or a tear,\nof the carotid artery.       The doctor explained that\nirreversible damage occurs when the artery tears \"like\nthat, quickly,\" and it \"wouldn't have mattered if [Keeper]\nhad been transported . . . in seconds to any hospital.\"\n\n    The jury returned verdicts in favor of King and\nGammon. Keeper filed a motion for a judgment as a matter\nof law, or, in the alternative, for a new trial, which the\ndistrict court denied.\n\n                          II.\n\n    On appeal Keeper argues that the District Court erred\nin denying his motion for judgment as a matter of law or\nfor a new trial. \"We review de novo the District Court's\ndenial of [Keeper's] motion for judgment as a matter of\nlaw, applying the same standards as the District Court.\"\nNicks v. Missouri, 67 F.3d 699, 704 (8th Cir. 1995).\n\"Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate when the\nnonmoving party has not offered sufficient evidence 'to\nsupport a jury verdict in his or her favor.' \"        Id.\n(quoting Abbott v. City of Crocker, 30 F.3d 994, 997 (8th\nCir. 1994)). \" 'Our task in reviewing a judgment entered\non a jury verdict is simply to inquire whether, viewed in\nthe light most favorable to [the nonmoving party], the\nevidence at trial supports the verdict.' \" Id. (quoting\nRademaker v. Nebraska, 906 F.2d 1309, 1313 (8th Cir.\n1990)). In so doing, we give the nonmoving party \" 'the\nbenefit of all reasonable inferences from the evidence,'\n\n                           -11-\n\fand [we] may not reassess the jury's credibility\ndecisions.\" Id. (quoting Abbott, 30 F.3d at 997).\n\n    We review the district court's denial of Keeper's\nmotion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion. Keenan\nv. Computer Assoc. Int'l, Inc., 13 F.3d 1266, 1269 (8th\nCir. 1994). Where, as here, \"the basis of the motion for\na new trial is that the jury's\n\n\n\n\n                           -12-\n\fverdict is against the weight of the evidence, the\ndistrict court's denial of the motion 'is virtually\nunassailable on appeal.' \"   Id. (quoting Peterson v.\nGeneral Motors Corp.,904 F.2d 436, 439-40 (8th Cir.\n1990)). \"The key question is whether a new trial should\nhave been granted to avoid a miscarriage of justice.''\nId.\n\n    We now turn to Keeper's section 1983 claim. In this\ndeprivation-of-medical-care case, Keeper had to \"show that\nthe prison official[s] w[ere] deliberately indifferent to\n[his] serious medical needs.\" Coleman v. Rahija, 114 F.3d\n778, 784 (8th Cir. 1997).           To prove deliberate\nindifference, Keeper had to show that King and Gammon\n\"knew of, yet disregarded, an excessive risk to his\nhealth.\"    Logan v. Clarke, 119 F.3d 647, 649 (8th\nCir.1997) (citing Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837\n(1994)). In Farmer, the Supreme Court made clear that an\nofficial had to have actual knowledge of a serious risk.\nThe Court stated that \"an official's failure to alleviate\na significant risk that he should have perceived but did\nnot, while no cause for commendation, cannot . . . be\ncondemned\" under the Eighth Amendment. 511 U.S. at 838.\n\n\n\n    As   to Gammon, the district court did not err in\ndenying Keeper's motion for judgment or for a new trial.\nIt is well settled that \" '[r]espondeat superior is not\na basis for liability under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.' \" Kulow v.\nNix, 28 F.3d 855, 858 (8th Cir. 1994) (quoting Smith v.\nMarcantonio, 910 F.2d 500, 502 (8th Cir. 1990)).       In\nparticular, this Court has noted that \"a general\nresponsibility for supervising the operations of a prison\n\n                           -13-\n\fis insufficient to establish the personal involvement\nrequired to support liability.\" Camberos v. Branstad, 73\nF.3d 174, 176 (8th Cir. 1995). Because Gammon was not\ninvolved in treatment decisions made by the medical unit's\nstaff   and \"lacked medical expertise, [he] cannot be\nliable for the medical staff's diagnostic decision[s].\"\nId.   Moreover, Gammon    never received a complaint or\ngrievance from Keeper, and when his mother inquired about\nKeeper Gammon referred inquiries to Williams, who assured\nGammon that Keeper's condition was being monitored. \"In\nthese circumstances,       'if any claim of medical\nindifference . . . is to succeed, it must be brought\nagainst the individual[s] directly responsible for\n[Keeper's] medical care.' \" Kulow, 28 F.3d at 859\n\n\n\n\n                           -14-\n\f(quoting Brown v. Wallace, 957 F.2d 564, 566 (8th Cir.\n1992)).\n\n    The district court also did not err in denying\nKeeper's motion for judgment as to King.        Keeper is\ncorrect that \"[t]he factual determination that a prison\nofficial had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk\nmay be inferred from . . . the very fact that the risk was\nobvious.\"    Coleman, 114 F.3d at 786.       However, Dr.\nHatlelid's testimony was that the risk of stroke from\nKeeper's symptoms before February 29 was not obvious.\nEven Dr. Lewitt's testimony shows only a disagreement as\nto diagnosis, which is not actionable under the Eighth\nAmendment. See Vaughan v. Lacey, 49 F.3d 1344, 1346 (8th\nCir. 1995).     Keeper also relies on Dr. Hatlelid's\ntestimony that he would have ordered an ultrasound\nexamination in mid-January.        Keeper's reliance is\nmisplaced. \" '[W]hen [an] inmate alleges that the delay\nin treatment is the constitutional deprivation, the\nobjective seriousness of the deprivation should also be\nmeasured by     reference to the effect of delay in\ntreatment.' \" Crowley v. Hedgepeth, 109 F.3d 500, 502 (8th\nCir. 1997) (quoting Beyerbach v. Sears, 49 F.3d 1324, 1326\n(8th Cir. 1995)). In this case, Dr. Hatlelid testified\nthat although an ultrasound examination would have been\nappropriate, the fact that it was not ordered had \"no\npractical significance.\"    Thus, the doctor's testimony\ndoes not help Keeper's case.\n\n    It is undisputed that Keeper had a stroke on February\n29, and it is indeed regrettable that he was not\ntransferred to the hospital immediately, but instead was\nallowed to lie on a mattress on the floor, repeatedly\n\n                           -15-\n\fvoiding on himself. However, King cannot be held liable\nfor the nursing staff's failure to order an immediate\ntransfer, to contact another doctor, or to inform him\nfully of Keeper's condition. See Smith, 910 F.2d at 502\n(prison doctor could not be held liable for \"claims of\ninadequate treatment by other medical personnel\").      As\nKing points out, even Williams testified that although she\nhad instructed her staff to call her if they could not get\nin touch with King or if Keeper's condition had changed,\nno one called her. In any event, even if King had had\nactual knowledge of Keeper's condition on February 29, Dr.\nHatlelid's testimony that the delay in getting Keeper to\nthe hospital had no detrimental effect would support the\n\n\n\n\n                           -16-\n\fverdict.   See Coleman, 114 F.3d at 784; Crowley, 109 F.3d\nat 502.\n\n    Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in\ndenying Keeper's motion for a new trial as to King.\n\"[W]here reasonable [persons] can differ in evaluating\ncredible evidence, a new trial on the ground of weight of\nthe evidence should not be granted.\" White v. Pence, 961\nF.2d 776, 781 (8th Cir. 1992).     In addition, a motion\nshould not be granted merely \" 'because judges feel that\nother results are more reasonable.' \" Id. at 780 (quoting\nFireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Aalco Wrecking Co., 466 F.2d\n179, 186 (8th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 930\n(1973)). Although the jury could have chosen to believe\nWilliams's or Dr. Lewitt's testimony, it chose to believe\nDr. Hatlelid's testimony. Thus, the District Court did\nnot err in denying Keeper's motion for a new trial.\n    On appeal Keeper also raises evidentiary and\ninstructional issues. He argues that the District Court\nerred in sustaining King's motion in limine to exclude\nevidence relating to King's alleged mistreatment of other\ninmates and of King's alleged intoxication on two\noccasions in 1990 and 1991. However, as King points out,\nbecause Keeper failed to make offers of proof he has\nfailed to preserve the issues for review. Keeper suggests\nthat an offer of proof was unnecessary since the District\nCourt granted the motion in limine. We disagree. This\nCourt has indicated that, as a general rule, in order to\npreserve an evidentiary issue for appeal an offer of proof\nis necessary, even if the district court grants a motion\nin limine. Dupre v. Fru-Con Eng'g Inc., 112 F.3d 329, 336\n(8th Cir. 1997).    In this case, there is no reason to\ndepart from that rule. In particular, we note that in its\n\n                            -17-\n\fpretrial ruling the Court indicated that it would exclude\nevidence of King's alleged mistreatment of other inmates\nas to King, but might allow such evidence if relevant to\nestablish Gammon's knowledge.      When Keeper's counsel\nattempted to question Gammon about one of the incidents,\nthe District Court found the incident was not relevant,\nbut told Keeper's counsel \"[t]hat may well be something\nyou want to get in if Dr. King takes the stand.\" Despite\nthis invitation, counsel made no effort to question King\nconcerning the incident.      In any event, had Keeper\npreserved the issues for review we would find no abuse of\ndiscretion in excluding evidence\n\n\n\n\n                           -18-\n\frelating to King's alleged mistreatment of other inmates\nor King's alleged intoxication on other occasions.\n\n    Keeper also argues that the verdict director\ninstructions were incorrect statements of the law.\nHowever, he did not raise his objections in the District\nCourt.   \"Our law on this subject is crystal clear: to\npreserve an argument concerning a jury instruction for\nappellate review, a party must state distinctly the matter\nobjected to and the grounds of the objection on the\nrecord.\" Id. at 334.

We\naffirm.\n\n                          I.\n\n    On October 24, 1991, Keeper submitted a medical\nservices request (MSR), complaining of headaches and\nblurred vision, but failed to appear for sick call. On\nOctober 28 Keeper complained of dizziness, abdominal pain,\nand blurred    vision and was examined by a nurse, who\ndiagnosed a likely muscle strain, prescribed Motrin, and\ntold Keeper to return the next morning. On October 29\nKeeper was examined by Dr. Hampton, who referred him to\nan ophthalmologist. On November 11 Keeper submitted an\nMSR, complaining of blurred vision and right eye and head\npain, but again failed to appear for sick call.         On\nNovember 18 Keeper, complaining of left-sided numbness,\nblurred vision, pain in the right eye, weakness, and an\ninability to stand at times, was again examined by Dr.\nHampton, who prescribed Elavil for headaches and ordered\na psychological examination, including testing.\n\n    On December 30 Keeper submitted two MSRs. At 4:20\np.m. he complained of headaches and blurred vision. A\nnurse examined and released him. At 6:00 p.m. he noted\nthat he had run out of Elavil and that his pain had\nreturned.    He requested a complete physical \"before\nsomething seriously does go wrong\" and also submitted a\nletter detailing his complaints of headaches, blurred\nvision, and left-sided weakness and numbness. Later that\nday, King reviewed Keeper's medical records and renewed\nhis prescription for Elavil. On January 1, 1992, Keeper\n\n                            -3-\n\fsubmitted another MSR, claiming his condition was worse\nand that he had had \"mild strokes off and on.\" On January\n2 Keeper was brought to the medical unit on a stretcher,\ncomplaining of difficulty standing, dizziness, headaches,\nand numbness. King examined him, but found \"no medical\nproblem\" and ordered that Keeper complete psychological\ntesting. Although Keeper walked out of the unit on his\nown, he was brought back by a guard a few minutes later\nbecause he could not stand.       King did not reexamine\nKeeper. However,\n\n\n\n\n                           -4-\n\fKeeper was placed in administrative segregation for\nmedical observation. As a routine matter, a nurse looked\nin on Keeper four times a day. He was also seen by a\nnurse on at least three other occasions, including January\n17, when he was found lying on the floor unable to move.\nAfter returning to his regular cell on January 21, he was\nagain found lying on the floor and was admitted to the\ninfirmary for overnight observation.     The next morning\nKeeper stated he was feeling fine and was discharged.\n\n    Keeper did not request or receive medical services\nagain until Saturday, February 29, when he was brought to\nthe medical unit after he was found sitting on a toilet\nunable to move or speak. A nurse called the MCC health\ncare supervisor, Debra Williams, who was at home.\nWilliams instructed the nurse to admit Keeper to the\ninfirmary, check his vital and neurological signs every\nhour, and contact King. Although nurses tried to reach\nKing by telephone several times on February 29, King, who\ndid not carry a pager, was finally reached on March 1 at\nnoon. King did not come to the infirmary, but instructed\nthe staff to observe Keeper. At 3:00 p.m. that day Keeper\nwas found lying on the floor wet with urine. His clothes\nwere changed and his mattress was placed on the floor. He\nwas found on the mattress wet with urine on Monday, March\n2, at 1:30 a.m and 6:30 a.m. At 7:35 a.m. King came to\nthe infirmary and examined Keeper. Although the doctor\nfound \"no apparent neurological defect\" and gave a\nprovisional diagnosis of conversion hysteria, King\ntransferred Keeper to a hospital to rule out an\nobstruction in the brain.     At the hospital a CAT scan\nrevealed that Keeper had had a large stroke to the right\nside of the brain. An examining doctor noted that the\n\n                            -5-\n\fslow progression of the stroke was \"a little unusual.\"\n\n    Keeper filed an action under 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 against\nKing and Gammon, alleging that they had been deliberately\nindifferent to his serious medical needs, in violation of\nthe Eighth Amendment.    At trial, Keeper, who was then\nforty-one years old, testified that he could no longer\nuse his left arm or leg, had difficulty speaking and\nseeing, and that his condition had worsened since the\nstroke. In addition to introducing the medical records,\nKeeper also presented the testimony of Debra Williams and\nDr. Peter Lewitt, a neurologist.\n\n    Williams testified that although King was the full-\ntime physician and Hampton was the part-time physician on\nthe medical unit staff, as health care supervisor she had\nthe over-all responsibility for the medical unit, and, in\nthe event of an emergency, could order an inmate's\ntransfer to a hospital.       Although Williams was not\ninvolved in the day-to-day treatment of patients, she\nstated she was familiar with Keeper's case. In November\n1991 she had reviewed his records and discussed his\ncondition with her staff after Gammon had informed her\nthat Keeper's mother had contacted him regarding Keeper's\ncondition. After her review, Williams reported to Gammon\nthat Keeper was being monitored. She was also aware that\nGammon had informed the unit that Keeper's mother had\nagain inquired about his condition on December 29.\nAccording to Williams, by mid-January Keeper's symptoms\nhad become consistent with transient ischemic attacks\n(TIA), which are brief neurological attacks that could be\nprecursors to a stroke.\n\n\n\n                           -6-\n\f    As to the events of February 29 to March 2, Williams\ntestified that she was at home when she received a call\nfrom a nurse informing her that Keeper had been brought to\nthe unit because he had difficulty moving his left leg and\ncould not move his left arm. Williams returned to work on\nMarch 2 and examined Keeper. Williams testified that she\nwas ''shocked\" that King had found \"no apparent\nneurological defect\" during his examination, because her\nexamination revealed that Keeper had facial drooping,\nhalting and slurred speech, and a limp left arm.\n\n    On cross-examination, Williams admitted that on\nFebruary 29 she had instructed her staff to call her at\nhome if they could not reach King or if Keeper's condition\nhad changed, but that no one called her. Williams also\nstated that she was aware that a list of physicians who\nwere on call was posted on a bulletin board in the medical\nunit, but admitted that she had never called a doctor on\nthe list and did not know how the list was to be used.\n\n    Dr. Lewitt, who practices and teaches neurology in\nMichigan, testified by video-taped deposition. He stated\nthat risk factors for a stroke were high blood pressure\nand an abnormal heart rhythm and that symptoms of a stroke\nincluded numbness, but generally not a headache. Based on\nhis review of     Keeper's medical records, Dr. Lewitt\nbelieved that as of December 30, 1991, Keeper presented a\nmedical emergency, and that a brain scan would have been\nappropriate. The doctor stated that on February 29 Keeper\nhad a stroke, and King's order to observe was an\ninappropriate response.    Lewitt believed that Keeper's\nstroke had progressed slowly, and that had it been\ndiagnosed and treated earlier there was a possibility that\n\n                            -7-\n\fsome of the effects of the stroke could have been\nprevented. In sum, the doctor believed that there was \"a\nmajor neglect of a treatable neurological condition.\"\n\n    Gammon testified that as superintendent of MCC he was\nresponsible for the over-all operation of the MCC, but\nthat he had no medical training or expertise.      Gammon\nstated that although he knew Keeper's name, he was not\npersonally familiar with him and had never received a\ngrievance or letter concerning Keeper's care.      Gammon\nstated that when he or his office had received telephone\ninquiries from Keeper's mother, the inquiries were\nreferred to Williams because she was responsible for the\noperation of the infirmary.\n\n    King, who at the time of trial was employed by the\nIowa Department of Corrections, testified that it was a\nnurse's responsibility to refer a patient to a physician,\nand in an emergency, if a nurse could not reach a doctor,\nthe nurse or the health care supervisor could order a\ntransfer of the inmate to a hospital. King admitted he\ndid not carry a pager, but explained that, although he\nvolunteered to see patients on nights and weekends, he was\nnot on call twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.\nInstead, he stated five to six physicians were on call.\nKing believed that he had treated Keeper's symptoms\nappropriately   and   explained   that  he   had   ordered\npsychological testing because some of Keeper's symptoms\ncould have been caused by a conversion hysteria,\n\n\n\n\n                            -8-\n\fa process whereby a person converts a mental problem into\nan actual physical problem, or by malingering, whereby a\nperson \"fakes\" symptoms. According to King, malingering\nwas a common problem in prison.      King stated that he\nreported that Keeper had \"no apparent neurological defect\"\non March 2 because physical examination revealed \"no\nevidence of pathological neurological signs,\" such as a\npositive Babinski response, deep tendon reflex, or ankle\nclonus.\n\n    King also presented the testimony of Dr. Michael\nHatlelid, a neurologist in private practice in St. Louis,\nMissouri, and on the faculty of a local medical school.\nThe doctor, who in the year before trial had treated three\nhundred stroke patients and three to four hundred headache\npatients, testified about the differences in symptoms\nbetween a TIA and a migraine headache. According to the\ndoctor, symptoms of a TIA were numbness on one side of the\nbody, double vision, blindness, and vertigo, but not as a\ngeneral rule dizziness and blurred vision. Symptoms of a\nmigraine headache were throbbing head pain, nausea,\nblurred vision, and numbness.    Dr. Hatlelid also noted\nthat, other than cigarette smoking, Keeper did not present\nthe major risk factors for stroke, such as high blood\npressure, blood clotting problems, heart disease, or\ndiabetes.\n    Although Dr. Hatlelid believed that before February\n29 Keeper's symptoms had been consistent with migraine\nheadaches, nonetheless the doctor testified that around\nmid-January   he   would   have  ordered   an   ultrasound\nexamination to determine whether there was an abnormality\nin the carotid artery in Keeper's neck. If the ultrasound\nshowed a significant abnormality, the doctor would have\n\n                            -9-\n\fperformed an angiogram of the artery to determine whether\nthere was a surgically correctable condition. However,\nDr. Hatlelid stated that had an ultrasound been performed\nin January, it would have been normal, since a March 3\nultrasound examination was essentially normal, showing\nonly \"minimal atherosclerotic disease of the carotid\nartery with a 0-19 percent diameter reduction of the\ninternal artery.\" The doctor also noted that additional\ntesting at the hospital failed to reveal the cause of the\nstroke.    Thus, according to the doctor, \"the fact\nadditional workup was not done in January 1992 ha[d] no\npractical significance.\"\n\n\n\n\n                           -10-\n\fBased on his review of the medical records, Dr. Hatlelid\nexpressed the opinion that Keeper did not have a series of\nstrokes, but had one single catastrophic stroke on\nFebruary 29, which was caused by a dissection, or a tear,\nof the carotid artery.       The doctor explained that\nirreversible damage occurs when the artery tears \"like\nthat, quickly,\" and it \"wouldn't have mattered if [Keeper]\nhad been transported . . . in seconds to any hospital.\"\n\n    The jury returned verdicts in favor of King and\nGammon. Keeper filed a motion for a judgment as a matter\nof law, or, in the alternative, for a new trial, which the\ndistrict court denied.\n\n                          II.\n\n    On appeal Keeper argues that the District Court erred\nin denying his motion for judgment as a matter of law or\nfor a new trial. \"We review de novo the District Court's\ndenial of [Keeper's] motion for judgment as a matter of\nlaw, applying the same standards as the District Court.\"\nNicks v.

In this case, Dr. Hatlelid testified\nthat although an ultrasound examination would have been\nappropriate, the fact that it was not ordered had \"no\npractical significance.\"    Thus, the doctor's testimony\ndoes not help Keeper's case.\n\n    It is undisputed that Keeper had a stroke on February\n29, and it is indeed regrettable that he was not\ntransferred to the hospital immediately, but instead was\nallowed to lie on a mattress on the floor, repeatedly\n\n                           -15-\n\fvoiding on himself. However, King cannot be held liable\nfor the nursing staff's failure to order an immediate\ntransfer, to contact another doctor, or to inform him\nfully of Keeper's condition. See Smith, 910 F.2d at 502\n(prison doctor could not be held liable for \"claims of\ninadequate treatment by other medical personnel\").      As\nKing points out, even Williams testified that although she\nhad instructed her staff to call her if they could not get\nin touch with King or if Keeper's condition had changed,\nno one called her. In any event, even if King had had\nactual knowledge of Keeper's condition on February 29, Dr.\nHatlelid's testimony that the delay in getting Keeper to\nthe hospital had no detrimental effect would support the\n\n\n\n\n                           -16-\n\fverdict.   See Coleman, 114 F.3d at 784; Crowley, 109 F.3d\nat 502.\n\n    Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in\ndenying Keeper's motion for a new trial as to King.\n\"[W]here reasonable [persons] can differ in evaluating\ncredible evidence, a new trial on the ground of weight of\nthe evidence should not be granted.\" White v.

In addition, a motion\nshould not be granted merely \" 'because judges feel that\nother results are more reasonable.' \" Id. at 780 (quoting\nFireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Aalco Wrecking Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"305473\"><a href=\"/opinion/305473/firemans-fund-insurance-company-a-corporation-v-aalco-wrecking-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 186 (8th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">930</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1973)). Although the jury could have chosen to believe\nWilliams's or Dr. Lewitt's testimony, it chose to believe\nDr. Hatlelid's testimony. Thus, the District Court did\nnot err in denying Keeper's motion for a new trial.\n    On appeal Keeper also raises evidentiary and\ninstructional issues. He argues that the District Court\nerred in sustaining King's motion in limine to exclude\nevidence relating to King's alleged mistreatment of other\ninmates and of King's alleged intoxication on two\noccasions in 1990 and 1991. However, as King points out,\nbecause Keeper failed to make offers of proof he has\nfailed to preserve the issues for review. Keeper suggests\nthat an offer of proof was unnecessary since the District\nCourt granted the motion in limine. We disagree. This\nCourt has indicated that, as a general rule, in order to\npreserve an evidentiary issue for appeal an offer of proof\nis necessary, even if the district court grants a motion\nin limine.

In this case, there is no reason to\ndepart from that rule. In particular, we note that in its\n\n                            -17-\n\fpretrial ruling the Court indicated that it would exclude\nevidence of King's alleged mistreatment of other inmates\nas to King, but might allow such evidence if relevant to\nestablish Gammon's knowledge.      When Keeper's counsel\nattempted to question Gammon about one of the incidents,\nthe District Court found the incident was not relevant,\nbut told Keeper's counsel \"[t]hat may well be something\nyou want to get in if Dr. King takes the stand.\" Despite\nthis invitation, counsel made no effort to question King\nconcerning the incident.      In any event, had Keeper\npreserved the issues for review we would find no abuse of\ndiscretion in excluding evidence\n\n\n\n\n                           -18-\n\frelating to King's alleged mistreatment of other inmates\nor King's alleged intoxication on other occasions.\n\n    Keeper also argues that the verdict director\ninstructions were incorrect statements of the law.\nHowever, he did not raise his objections in the District\nCourt.   \"Our law on this subject is crystal clear: to\npreserve an argument concerning a jury instruction for\nappellate review, a party must state distinctly the matter\nobjected to and the grounds of the objection on the\nrecord.\" Id. at 334.
