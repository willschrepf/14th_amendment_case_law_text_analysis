The City also appeals\n\nthe denial of a motion for summary judgment regarding the validity of an\n\nappointment of a black firefighter to the position of deputy chief. For the reasons\n\nassigned, we affirm in part and reverse and render in part.\n\n                                 BACKGROUND\n\n      The Dallas Fire Department (DFD) has the following rank structure,\n\nbeginning with the entry level position: (1) fire and rescue officer, (2) driver-\n\nengineer, (3) lieutenant, (4) captain, (5) battalion chief, (6) deputy chief, (7)\n\nassistant chief, and (8) chief. Positions are filled only from within the department.\n\nThe city manager appoints the chief who in turn appoints the assistant and deputy\n\nchiefs. For battalion chief and below, firefighters become eligible to take a\n\npromotion examination for advancement to the next highest rank after a certain\n\namount of time in grade. Those passing the examination are placed on an\n\neligibility roster, listed in accordance with their scores. Vacancies occurring\n\nthereafter are filled by promoting individuals from the top of the eligibility list,\n\nunless there is a countervailing reason such as unsatisfactory performance,\n\ndisciplinary problems, or non-paramedic status.\n\n      In 1988 the City Council adopted a five-year affirmative action plan for the\n\nDFD, extending same for five years in 1992 with a few modifications. In an effort\n\n                                         3\n\fto increase minority and female representation the DFD promoted black, hispanic,\n\nand female firefighters ahead of male, nonminority firefighters who had scored\n\nhigher on the promotion examinations. Between 1991 and 1995 these promotions\n\noccasioned four lawsuits filed by the Dallas Fire Fighters Association on behalf of\n\nwhite and Native American male firefighters who were passed over for promotions.\n\nThese actions were consolidated by the district court.\n\n       The plaintiffs consist of four groups, three of which contend that the DFD\n\nimpermissibly denied them promotions to the ranks of driver-engineer, lieutenant,\n\nand captain respectively. Additionally, a fourth group of plaintiffs challenges the\n\nfire chief’s appointment of a black male to deputy chief in 1990. The plaintiffs\n\nclaim that the City and the fire chief, Dodd Miller, acting in his official capacity,\n\nviolated: (1) the fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution, 1 (2) the\n\nequal rights clause of the Texas Constitution, (3) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\n\nof 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., and (4) article 5221k of the Texas Civil\n\nStatutes.2\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs\n\nchallenging the out-of-rank promotions, finding violations of their constitutional\n\n\n   1\n    This claim is brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n   2\n    Now codified as Tex. Labor Code §§ 21.001 et seq.\n\n                                           4\n\fand statutorily protected rights. The court denied the City’s motions for summary\n\njudgment, and denied the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment as to the deputy\n\nchief appointment. The court subsequently entered an order consolidating the\n\naction that had yet to be resolved. Thereafter the court entered an agreed order\n\nregarding remedies and entered final judgment in the consolidated action. The City\n\ntimely appealed.\n\n                                     ANALYSIS\n\n1. Standard of Review\n\n       We review a district court’s entry of summary judgment de novo, applying\n\nthe same standards used by the district court.3 Summary judgment is only proper\n\nif there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.4\n\n2. The Out-of-Rank Promotions5\n\n       A. Race-Conscious Promotions\n\n       To survive an equal protection challenge under the fourteenth amendment,\n\n\n\n   3\n    Orleans Parish School Bd. v. Asbestos Corp., 114 F.3d 66 (5th Cir. 1997).\n   4\n    Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).\n   5\n    We address only the validity of the out-of-rank promotions and not the affirmative\naction plan as a whole.\n\n                                            5\n\fa racial classification must be tailored narrowly to serve a compelling\n\ngovernmental interest.6 That standard applies to classifications intended to be\n\nremedial, as well as to those based upon invidious discrimination.7 A governmental\n\nbody has a compelling interest in remedying the present effects of past\n\ndiscrimination.8 In analyzing race conscious remedial measures we essentially are\n\nguided by four factors: (1) necessity for the relief and efficacy of alternative\n\nremedies; (2) flexibility and duration of the relief; (3) relationship of the numerical\n\ngoals to the relevant labor market; and (4) impact of the relief on the rights of third\n\nparties.9\n\n          We conclude that on the record before us the race-based, out-of-rank\n\npromotions at issue herein violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth\n\namendment.10 The only evidence of discrimination contained in the record is the\n\n1976 consent decree between the City and the United States Department of Justice,\n\n\n   6\n    City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469 (1989).\n   7\n    Id.\n   8\n    Local 28 of Sheet Metal Workers’ Int’l Ass’n v. E.E.O.C., 478 U.S 421 (1986).\n   9\n   United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149 (1987) (4-justice plurality); Black Fire\nFighters Ass’n of Dallas v. City of Dallas, 19 F.3d 992 (5th Cir. 1994).\n   10\n    We also find a violation of the equal rights clause of the Texas constitution which is\nconstrued in conformity with the federal constitution. Rose v. Doctors Hospital, 801\nS.W.2d 841 (Tex. 1990).\n\n                                            6\n\fprecipitated by a DOJ finding that the City engaged in practices inconsistent with\n\nTitle VII, and a statistical analysis showing an underrepresentation of minorities in\n\nthe ranks to which the challenged promotions were made. The record is devoid of\n\nproof of a history of egregious and pervasive discrimination or resistance to\n\naffirmative action that has warranted more serious measures in other cases.11 We\n\nare aware that the out-of-rank promotions do not impose as great a burden on\n\nnonminorities as would a layoff or discharge. In light of the minimal record\n\nevidence of discrimination in the DFD, however, we perforce must conclude that\n\nthe City is not justified in interfering with the legitimate expectations of those\n\nwarranting promotion based upon their performance in the examinations. 12\n\n        There are other ways to remedy the effects of past discrimination. The City\n\ncontends, however, that alternative measures employed by the DFD, such as\n\nvalidating promotion exams, recruiting minorities, eliminating the addition of\n\n\n   11\n     Compare Paradise, 480 U.S. at 167 (finding “pervasive, systematic, and obstinate\ndiscriminatory conduct” which “created a profound need and a firm justification for the\nrace-conscious relief ordered by the District Court”); Sheet Metal Workers, 478 U.S. at\n421 (upholding race-based remedy where there was egregious record of discrimination\nand official resistance to practices aimed at ending discrimination); see also Black Fire\nFighters Ass’n, 19 F.3d at 996 (contrasting the DFD’s employment practices with that\nfound in Sheet Metal Workers and International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United\nStates, 431 U.S. 324 (1977), where there was “a pattern of lying to minority applicants\nand deliberately losing their applications.”).\n   12\n     See Black Fire Fighters Ass’n.\n\n                                            7\n\fseniority points to promotion exam scores, and initiating a tutoring program, have\n\nbeen unsuccessful, as evidenced by the continuing imbalance in the upper ranks of\n\nthe DFD. That minorities continue to be underrepresented does not necessarily\n\nmean that the alternative remedies have been ineffective, but merely that they\n\napparently do not operate as quickly as out-of-rank promotions. 13\n\n        B. Gender-Conscious Promotions\n\n        Applying the less exacting intermediate scrutiny analysis applicable to\n\ngender-based affirmative action,14 we nonetheless find the gender-based promotions\n\nunconstitutional. The record before us contains, as noted above, little evidence of\n\nracial discrimination; it contains even less evidence of gender discrimination.\n\nWithout a showing of discrimination against women in the DFD, or at least in the\n\nindustry in general, we cannot find that the promotions are related substantially to\n\nan important governmental interest.\n\n   13\n     The City points to several features of the promotional plan that weigh in favor of its\nconstitutionality, e.g., (1) only qualified individuals are promoted; (2) the DFD uses\nbanding of test scores to ensure that the beneficiaries of the out-of-rank promotions are\nequally qualified to those whom they pass over; (3) the affirmative action plan under\nwhich the promotions are made lasts only five years; (4) the affirmative action\npromotions to a rank will cease when the manifest imbalance in the rank is eliminated;\nand (5) only 50% of annual promotions to a rank may be made under the affirmative\naction plan. Although those factors support the City’s position, they are not enough to\novercome the minimal record evidence of discrimination that is sufficient to support only\nthe use of less intrusive alternative remedies.\n   14\n     See Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718 (1982).\n\n                                             8\n\fC. Title VII\n\n        Having struck down the out-of-rank promotions as unconstitutional, we need\n\nnot address their validity under Title VII or Texas article 5221k.\n\n3. The Deputy Chief Appointment\n\n        The City contends that the district court erred in failing to grant its motion\n\nfor summary judgment on the ground that Chief Miller’s appointment of Robert\n\nBailey, a black male, to deputy chief violated neither Title VII nor article 5221k.15\n\nTo determine the validity of the appointment we must examine whether it was\n\njustified by a manifest imbalance in a traditionally segregated job category and\n\nwhether the appointment unnecessarily trammeled the rights of nonminorities or\n\ncreated an absolute bar to their advancement.16 The plaintiffs do not dispute that\n\nthere is a manifest imbalance in the rank of deputy chief and we therefore limit our\n\ndiscussion to the second prong of the Johnson test.\n\n        The only summary judgment evidence specific to the Bailey appointment\n\n\n\n   15\n     Article 5221k states that it is intended to achieve the goals embodied in Title VII.\nSee also Chevron Corp. v. Redmon, 745 S.W.2d 314 (Tex. 1987). We note that neither\nthe parties nor the district court make any mention of the constitutionality of the deputy\nchief appointment. We therefore decline to address that issue.\n   16\n     Johnson v. Transportation Agency, 480 U.S. 616 (1987).\n\n                                            9\n\fis the affidavit of Chief Miller in which he states:\n\n\n      In 1990, I selected Robert Bailey as Deputy Chief because I believed\n      he was capable of performing the job responsibilities of the position\n      of Deputy Chief, and he was recommended by my executive staff. In\n      addition, the appointment of Chief Bailey was made pursuant to the\n      City of Dallas Affirmative Action Plan.\n\nThe City contends that Chief Miller’s statement reflects that, in appointing Bailey,\n\nhe considered race as one factor among many, making the appointment permissible\n\nunder Johnson. The plaintiffs concede that Bailey was qualified but insist that the\n\nreference to the affirmative action plan, and the failure of Chief Miller to explain\n\nhow Bailey compared to other candidates, established that Chief Miller based his\n\nfinal decision solely upon race. The plaintiffs also contend that the promotional\n\ngoals in the affirmative action plan are out of proportion to the percentage of\n\navailable candidates, demonstrating that the appointment was made to fulfill\n\nimpermissible goals and, thus, unnecessarily trammeled the rights of nonminorities.\n\n\n\n      The plaintiffs’ position is that any employment decision utilizing the\n\naffirmative action plan is illegal. We decline to accept that contention, particularly\n\nin light of the fact that the validity of the affirmative action plan is not in question\n\nherein. We are persuaded beyond peradventure that the mere reference to the\n\n\n                                          10\n\faffirmative action plan does not create a fact issue concerning whether Chief Miller\n\nhad an impermissible motive in promoting Bailey. The only relevant summary\n\njudgment evidence reflects that Chief Miller chose Bailey based upon substantially\n\nmore than just his race, and the opponents have failed to produce any acceptable\n\nmaterial evidence to the contrary.17 We therefore conclude that the appointment\n\ndid not unnecessarily trammel the rights of nonminorities or pose an absolute bar\n\nto their advancement. Accordingly, the appointment was consistent with Title VII\n\nand article 5221k and the district court erred in failing to grant the City’s motion\n\nfor summary judgment upholding its validity.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment striking down the out-\n\nof-rank promotions and we REVERSE and RENDER judgment in favor of the\n\nCity, upholding the validity of the deputy chief appointment.\n\n\n\n\n   17\n     The plaintiffs contend that a triable issue of fact exists because Chief Miller’s\naffidavit is inconsistent with the City’s response to an interrogatory concerning the reason\nfor Bailey’s appointment, which does not mention the recommendation by the executive\nstaff. This contention is wholly lacking in merit.\n\n                                            11\n\fJERRY E. SMITH, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part:\n\n\n\n      Although I join the panel opinion insofar as it affirms the judgment holding\n\nunconstitutional the Dallas Fire Department's “skip promotion” practice used to\n\nadvance the “goals” of its affirmative action plan, I would also affirm the district\n\ncourt's decision to allow those plaintiffs who sought the Deputy Chief position\n\n(“the Deputy Chief plaintiffs”) to proceed to trial on their claims. I therefore\n\nrespectfully dissent in part.\n\n      The Deputy Chief plaintiffs vary from the other plaintiffs in an important\n\nrespect. The promotion system for the other plaintiffs was strictly mathematical,\n\nso it is known that persons were promoted solely on the basis of race. The Deputy\n\nChief, on the other hand, was appointed by Chief Dodd Miller. It is possible that\n\nhe considered factors in addition to race in deciding whom to promote.\n\n      There is a genuine issue of material fact concerning Miller's motivations. He\n\nmay have followed the unconstitutional “skip promotion” practice by deciding who\n\nwas qualified for the job, then promoting the qualified minority candidate, if one\n\nexisted.   If he did so, the promotion was just as illegal as were the other\n\npromotions.\n\n      In his affidavit, Miller swears that he considered factors other than race. He\n\fnever states, however, that his decision was not ultimately controlled by the “goals”\n\nof the affirmative action plan.18 The existence of that generally-enforced plan, with\n\nits generally-applicable “goals,” creates a genuine issue of material fact concerning\n\nMiller's motivations. See Messer v. Meno, 130 F.3d 130, 137-39 (5th Cir. 1997).\n\nFor this reason, summary judgment was inappropriate, and this claim should\n\nproceed to trial.\n\n      Accordingly, because the judgment should be affirmed in its entirety, I\n\nrespectfully dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n      18\n        The “goals” applied to across-the-board hiring decisions, including\nthose regarding “Fire Executives,” such as Deputy Chiefs.\n\n                                         13\n\f",

The City also appeals\n\nthe denial of a motion for summary judgment regarding the validity of an\n\nappointment of a black firefighter to the position of deputy chief. For the reasons\n\nassigned, we affirm in part and reverse and render in part.\n\n                                 BACKGROUND\n\n      The Dallas Fire Department (DFD) has the following rank structure,\n\nbeginning with the entry level position: (1) fire and rescue officer, (2) driver-\n\nengineer, (3) lieutenant, (4) captain, (5) battalion chief, (6) deputy chief, (7)\n\nassistant chief, and (8) chief. Positions are filled only from within the department.\n\nThe city manager appoints the chief who in turn appoints the assistant and deputy\n\nchiefs. For battalion chief and below, firefighters become eligible to take a\n\npromotion examination for advancement to the next highest rank after a certain\n\namount of time in grade. Those passing the examination are placed on an\n\neligibility roster, listed in accordance with their scores. Vacancies occurring\n\nthereafter are filled by promoting individuals from the top of the eligibility list,\n\nunless there is a countervailing reason such as unsatisfactory performance,\n\ndisciplinary problems, or non-paramedic status.\n\n      In 1988 the City Council adopted a five-year affirmative action plan for the\n\nDFD, extending same for five years in 1992 with a few modifications. In an effort\n\n                                         3\n\fto increase minority and female representation the DFD promoted black, hispanic,\n\nand female firefighters ahead of male, nonminority firefighters who had scored\n\nhigher on the promotion examinations. Between 1991 and 1995 these promotions\n\noccasioned four lawsuits filed by the Dallas Fire Fighters Association on behalf of\n\nwhite and Native American male firefighters who were passed over for promotions.\n\nThese actions were consolidated by the district court.\n\n       The plaintiffs consist of four groups, three of which contend that the DFD\n\nimpermissibly denied them promotions to the ranks of driver-engineer, lieutenant,\n\nand captain respectively. Additionally, a fourth group of plaintiffs challenges the\n\nfire chief’s appointment of a black male to deputy chief in 1990. The plaintiffs\n\nclaim that the City and the fire chief, Dodd Miller, acting in his official capacity,\n\nviolated: (1) the fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution, 1 (2) the\n\nequal rights clause of the Texas Constitution, (3) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\n\nof 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., and (4) article 5221k of the Texas Civil\n\nStatutes.2\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs\n\nchallenging the out-of-rank promotions, finding violations of their constitutional\n\n\n   1\n    This claim is brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n   2\n    Now codified as Tex. Labor Code §§ 21.001 et seq.\n\n                                           4\n\fand statutorily protected rights. The court denied the City’s motions for summary\n\njudgment, and denied the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment as to the deputy\n\nchief appointment. The court subsequently entered an order consolidating the\n\naction that had yet to be resolved. Thereafter the court entered an agreed order\n\nregarding remedies and entered final judgment in the consolidated action. The City\n\ntimely appealed.\n\n                                     ANALYSIS\n\n1. Standard of Review\n\n       We review a district court’s entry of summary judgment de novo, applying\n\nthe same standards used by the district court.3 Summary judgment is only proper\n\nif there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.4\n\n2.

The record is devoid of\n\nproof of a history of egregious and pervasive discrimination or resistance to\n\naffirmative action that has warranted more serious measures in other cases.11 We\n\nare aware that the out-of-rank promotions do not impose as great a burden on\n\nnonminorities as would a layoff or discharge. In light of the minimal record\n\nevidence of discrimination in the DFD, however, we perforce must conclude that\n\nthe City is not justified in interfering with the legitimate expectations of those\n\nwarranting promotion based upon their performance in the examinations. 12\n\n        There are other ways to remedy the effects of past discrimination. The City\n\ncontends, however, that alternative measures employed by the DFD, such as\n\nvalidating promotion exams, recruiting minorities, eliminating the addition of\n\n\n   11\n     Compare Paradise, 480 U.S. at 167 (finding “pervasive, systematic, and obstinate\ndiscriminatory conduct” which “created a profound need and a firm justification for the\nrace-conscious relief ordered by the District Court”); Sheet Metal Workers, 478 U.S. at\n421 (upholding race-based remedy where there was egregious record of discrimination\nand official resistance to practices aimed at ending discrimination); see also Black Fire\nFighters Ass’n, 19 F.3d at 996 (contrasting the DFD’s employment practices with that\nfound in Sheet Metal Workers and International Brotherhood of Teamsters v.

That minorities continue to be underrepresented does not necessarily\n\nmean that the alternative remedies have been ineffective, but merely that they\n\napparently do not operate as quickly as out-of-rank promotions. 13\n\n        B. Gender-Conscious Promotions\n\n        Applying the less exacting intermediate scrutiny analysis applicable to\n\ngender-based affirmative action,14 we nonetheless find the gender-based promotions\n\nunconstitutional. The record before us contains, as noted above, little evidence of\n\nracial discrimination; it contains even less evidence of gender discrimination.\n\nWithout a showing of discrimination against women in the DFD, or at least in the\n\nindustry in general, we cannot find that the promotions are related substantially to\n\nan important governmental interest.\n\n   13\n     The City points to several features of the promotional plan that weigh in favor of its\nconstitutionality, e.g., (1) only qualified individuals are promoted; (2) the DFD uses\nbanding of test scores to ensure that the beneficiaries of the out-of-rank promotions are\nequally qualified to those whom they pass over; (3) the affirmative action plan under\nwhich the promotions are made lasts only five years; (4) the affirmative action\npromotions to a rank will cease when the manifest imbalance in the rank is eliminated;\nand (5) only 50% of annual promotions to a rank may be made under the affirmative\naction plan. Although those factors support the City’s position, they are not enough to\novercome the minimal record evidence of discrimination that is sufficient to support only\nthe use of less intrusive alternative remedies.\n   14\n     See Mississippi University for Women v.

Title VII\n\n        Having struck down the out-of-rank promotions as unconstitutional, we need\n\nnot address their validity under Title VII or Texas article 5221k.\n\n3. The Deputy Chief Appointment\n\n        The City contends that the district court erred in failing to grant its motion\n\nfor summary judgment on the ground that Chief Miller’s appointment of Robert\n\nBailey, a black male, to deputy chief violated neither Title VII nor article 5221k.15\n\nTo determine the validity of the appointment we must examine whether it was\n\njustified by a manifest imbalance in a traditionally segregated job category and\n\nwhether the appointment unnecessarily trammeled the rights of nonminorities or\n\ncreated an absolute bar to their advancement.16 The plaintiffs do not dispute that\n\nthere is a manifest imbalance in the rank of deputy chief and we therefore limit our\n\ndiscussion to the second prong of the Johnson test.\n\n        The only summary judgment evidence specific to the Bailey appointment\n\n\n\n   15\n     Article 5221k states that it is intended to achieve the goals embodied in Title VII.\nSee also Chevron Corp. v. Redmon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2467432\"><a href=\"/opinion/2467432/chevron-corp-v-redmon/\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1987). We note that neither\nthe parties nor the district court make any mention of the constitutionality of the deputy\nchief appointment. We therefore decline to address that issue.\n   16\n     Johnson v. Transportation Agency, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111846\"><a href=\"/opinion/111846/johnson-v-transportation-agency-santa-clara-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987).\n\n                                            9\n\fis the affidavit of Chief Miller in which he states:\n\n\n      In 1990, I selected Robert Bailey as Deputy Chief because I believed\n      he was capable of performing the job responsibilities of the position\n      of Deputy Chief, and he was recommended by my executive staff. In\n      addition, the appointment of Chief Bailey was made pursuant to the\n      City of Dallas Affirmative Action Plan.\n\nThe City contends that Chief Miller’s statement reflects that, in appointing Bailey,\n\nhe considered race as one factor among many, making the appointment permissible\n\nunder Johnson. The plaintiffs concede that Bailey was qualified but insist that the\n\nreference to the affirmative action plan, and the failure of Chief Miller to explain\n\nhow Bailey compared to other candidates, established that Chief Miller based his\n\nfinal decision solely upon race. The plaintiffs also contend that the promotional\n\ngoals in the affirmative action plan are out of proportion to the percentage of\n\navailable candidates, demonstrating that the appointment was made to fulfill\n\nimpermissible goals and, thus, unnecessarily trammeled the rights of nonminorities.\n\n\n\n      The plaintiffs’ position is that any employment decision utilizing the\n\naffirmative action plan is illegal. We decline to accept that contention, particularly\n\nin light of the fact that the validity of the affirmative action plan is not in question\n\nherein. We are persuaded beyond peradventure that the mere reference to the\n\n\n                                          10\n\faffirmative action plan does not create a fact issue concerning whether Chief Miller\n\nhad an impermissible motive in promoting Bailey. The only relevant summary\n\njudgment evidence reflects that Chief Miller chose Bailey based upon substantially\n\nmore than just his race, and the opponents have failed to produce any acceptable\n\nmaterial evidence to the contrary.17 We therefore conclude that the appointment\n\ndid not unnecessarily trammel the rights of nonminorities or pose an absolute bar\n\nto their advancement. Accordingly, the appointment was consistent with Title VII\n\nand article 5221k and the district court erred in failing to grant the City’s motion\n\nfor summary judgment upholding its validity.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment striking down the out-\n\nof-rank promotions and we REVERSE and RENDER judgment in favor of the\n\nCity, upholding the validity of the deputy chief appointment.\n\n\n\n\n   17\n     The plaintiffs contend that a triable issue of fact exists because Chief Miller’s\naffidavit is inconsistent with the City’s response to an interrogatory concerning the reason\nfor Bailey’s appointment, which does not mention the recommendation by the executive\nstaff. This contention is wholly lacking in merit.\n\n                                            11\n\fJERRY E. SMITH, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part:\n\n\n\n      Although I join the panel opinion insofar as it affirms the judgment holding\n\nunconstitutional the Dallas Fire Department's “skip promotion” practice used to\n\nadvance the “goals” of its affirmative action plan, I would also affirm the district\n\ncourt's decision to allow those plaintiffs who sought the Deputy Chief position\n\n(“the Deputy Chief plaintiffs”) to proceed to trial on their claims. I therefore\n\nrespectfully dissent in part.\n\n      The Deputy Chief plaintiffs vary from the other plaintiffs in an important\n\nrespect. The promotion system for the other plaintiffs was strictly mathematical,\n\nso it is known that persons were promoted solely on the basis of race. The Deputy\n\nChief, on the other hand, was appointed by Chief Dodd Miller. It is possible that\n\nhe considered factors in addition to race in deciding whom to promote.\n\n      There is a genuine issue of material fact concerning Miller's motivations. He\n\nmay have followed the unconstitutional “skip promotion” practice by deciding who\n\nwas qualified for the job, then promoting the qualified minority candidate, if one\n\nexisted.   If he did so, the promotion was just as illegal as were the other\n\npromotions.\n\n      In his affidavit, Miller swears that he considered factors other than race. He\n\fnever states, however, that his decision was not ultimately controlled by the “goals”\n\nof the affirmative action plan.18 The existence of that generally-enforced plan, with\n\nits generally-applicable “goals,” creates a genuine issue of material fact concerning\n\nMiller's motivations. See Messer v. Meno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"13573\"><a href=\"/opinion/13573/messer-v-meno/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 137-39 (5th Cir. 1997).\n\nFor this reason, summary judgment was inappropriate, and this claim should\n\nproceed to trial.\n\n      Accordingly, because the judgment should be affirmed in its entirety, I\n\nrespectfully dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n      18\n        The “goals” applied to across-the-board hiring decisions, including\nthose regarding “Fire Executives,” such as Deputy Chiefs.\n\n                                         13\n\f</pre>",
