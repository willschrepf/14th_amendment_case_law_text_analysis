If such an\ninmate meets the criteria enumerated in Penal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (e), he\nor she will be resentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines such\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.1 (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (f); People v. Yearwood (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 161, 168.)\n       After the Act went into effect, David John Valencia (defendant), an inmate serving\na term of 25 years to life following conviction of a felony that was not violent (as defined\nby § 667.5, subd. (c)) or serious (as defined by § 1192.7, subd. (c)), filed a petition for\nrecall of sentence and request for resentencing under the Act. Following a hearing, the\ntrial court found defendant to be an unreasonable risk to public safety and denied the\npetition.\n       We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the petition. In\nthe unpublished portion of our opinion, we reject defendant’s claims the trial court used\nthe wrong standard, failed to properly evaluate whether defendant posed an unreasonable\nrisk to society, and had to appoint an expert to evaluate defendant regarding current\ndangerousness; and his claim the prosecution did not meet its burden of establishing\ndangerousness; his claim his sentence of 25 years to life constitutes cruel and unusual\npunishment; and his claim the errors violated his right to due process. In the published\nportion, we conclude recently enacted section 1170.18, subdivision (c) does not modify\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (f). We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\f                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       On September 13, 2009, neighbors heard an argument between defendant and his\nwife, Carrie Kobel. They were yelling and screaming and Kobel was crying.2 Kobel was\nthen seen coming down her driveway, with defendant following. Defendant pushed\nKobel, causing her to fall to the ground, then punched her multiple times. When Kobel,\nwho was screaming for help, asked witnesses to call the police, defendant told them to\nmind their own business and became aggressive and intimidating toward them. When the\npolice arrived, Kobel related she and defendant had gotten into an argument when she\nwent to move her truck into the driveway so friends coming over would have a place to\npark. Kobel’s driver’s license had been suspended due to a vehicle accident in which she\nhad been under the influence of alcohol. Defendant objected to her driving because the\ncouple had been drinking and he thought she was going to leave. Kobel told him she was\nonly moving the truck, but when she went to do so, defendant hit her in the back of the\nhead. Defendant denied there had been a fight; he said Kobel was intoxicated and\nattempting to leave, and he was only trying to stop her. Although he denied hitting\nKobel, injuries to his knuckles were inconsistent with that claim. Kobel was treated for a\nlaceration on her head that was closed with staples.\n       At trial, a woman who had been in a relationship with defendant in 2000 testified\ndefendant had assaulted her by hitting her “full force” with his fist between her temple\nand ear. She suffered a ruptured eardrum from the incident.\n       On December 2, 2009, a jury convicted defendant of felony spousal abuse\n(§ 273.5). He admitted suffering five felony convictions, two of which constituted\nstrikes. On January 6, 2010, he was sentenced to prison for 25 years to life.\n\n\n2      The facts of defendant’s commitment offense are taken from our opinion in People\nv. Valencia (Mar. 3, 2011, F059244) [nonpub. opn.], which is contained in the clerk’s\ntranscript of the present appeal.\n\n\n\n                                            3.\n\f         On May 13, 2013, defendant filed a petition to recall sentence and request for\nresentencing under section 1170.126.3 Defendant represented his strike record consisted\nof a 1995 conviction for kidnapping (§ 207, subd. (a)) and a 1996 conviction for making\na criminal threat (§ 422). Appended to the petition was a letter from defendant’s parents,\nstating their support for him and willingness to assist him in obtaining psychological help\nand drug/alcohol treatment; a letter from the Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center\nin San Francisco, stating it appeared defendant was eligible for intake; letters from the\nDelancey Street Foundation in San Francisco, thanking defendant for his interest and\nexplaining how to apply upon release, but stating acceptance could not be guaranteed;4 an\ninformational “chrono,” dated March 8, 2010, documenting defendant requested\nsegregated housing because he feared for his safety after refusing to sign a petition being\nsubmitted by other White inmates, one of whom accused him of being a coward, after\nwhich defendant was told he had to stab the person who called him a coward or he would\nbe “‘dealt with’”; and an inmate request, dated March 12, 2013, in which defendant asked\nto be placed on waiting lists for anger management and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)\nmeetings. Defendant also related he had enrolled in a mail-order anger management\ncourse. He subsequently presented a certificate, dated May 15, 2013, attesting to his\ncompletion of the “‘Grant me the Serenity Workbook” for AA, and inmate passes\nshowing he was issued a pass allowing him to attend AA meetings on April 24, May 8,\nand May 15, 2013.5\n\n\n\n\n3     The petition was originally filed on April 15, 2013. It is unclear from the record\nwhy the petition was refiled.\n4        Several of the letters were from 2009.\n5        Although the passes contained spaces for arrival and departure times, none were\nnoted.\n\n\n\n                                              4.\n\f       The People opposed the petition. They asserted that in addition to the strike\nconvictions, defendant had felony convictions for violating section 273.5 in 2000,\nsection 69 in 1996, and Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (a) in 1996, in addition\nto 12 misdemeanor convictions between 1987 and 2007. The People set out the\ncomments made by the trial court when it denied defendant’s request to dismiss one of\nhis strikes for purposes of sentencing on his commitment offense, and argued\ncircumstances had not changed. They asserted defendant’s prior record documented his\nviolence, his continuous pattern of criminal conduct, and his failure to learn despite being\noffered treatment and rehabilitation programs. They also asserted defendant had not\nparticipated in any programs while imprisoned to address his violent tendencies.\nAccordingly, they argued he posed an unreasonable risk of danger.\n       In his reply to the opposition, defendant noted his commitment offense was not for\na serious or violent felony, so if he were sentenced now, the court would not have the\noption of sentencing him to 25 years to life; the prosecutor offered him a six-year\nsentence prior to trial; and the commitment offense involved him “wrestl[ing]” with his\nwife in an attempt to stop her from driving because she was intoxicated. Defendant\nargued the People had the burden of establishing he was an unreasonable risk to public\nsafety, and his crimes from a decade earlier were insufficient. He noted he had not had\nany further convictions while incarcerated, and asserted his prison record did not\ndemonstrate patterns of violent and predatory behavior.\n       The petition was heard August 9, 2013, before the judge who sentenced defendant\nto the third strike term.6 At the outset, the court found defendant eligible for\nresentencing, and placed the burden on the People with respect to whether resentencing\n\n\n6      We recite the evidence and argument at the hearing, and the court’s ruling, in\nsome detail due to the way defendant has excerpted minor portions — particularly of the\ncourt’s comments — as a basis for many of his claims on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                             5.\n\fdefendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Over the\nprosecutor’s objection, the trial court admitted a document showing defendant’s in-prison\nrisk classification was one, which was low.\n       The defense called witnesses at the hearing. Defendant’s mother testified she had\nnot seen defendant during his most recent prison stay until the Sunday before the hearing,\nas she was partially disabled and unable to travel, although they communicated by letter\nand sporadically by telephone. Since defendant was no longer under the influence of\nalcohol, his mother noticed his attitude was changing. He had apologized for being such\na disappointment. If defendant were released from prison, he would be able to live with\nhis parents in Sonora.\n       Defendant testified he had been in prison this last time almost four years, and he\nhad two prior prison terms.7 During his current term, he had no disciplinary actions.\nDuring his previous terms, he had one write-up for brewing alcohol. Defendant related\nthat during his current prison term, he was in AA and had been taking a mail-order course\non anger management and learning how to live a better life. Due to overcrowding, he\nwas “in reception” for 28 months, where nothing was offered. Now, however, he\nattended AA meetings once a week. The mail-order course, which he only recently\ndiscovered, involved a curriculum where the school sent information, the student\ncompleted and returned it, and the school gave a score. Defendant had done the first six\nlessons. He did not know how many were left before he received his certificate. He\nstarted both AA and the mail-order course around April 2013.\n\n\n\n7      The prison term defendant had before his current term was for felony domestic\nbattery. He pled guilty and was sentenced to four years. Defendant admitted having\nviolated probation at various times, but denied violating a protective order in his prior\ndomestic violence case. He completed a 52-week batterer’s course in conjunction with\nthat domestic violence case.\n\n\n\n                                              6.\n\f         Defendant related that since 2010, he had been housed in protective custody. He\nwas asked to stab someone and refused. He explained that the gangs run the prison, and\nif an inmate does not do what they say, he will be next. Because defendant did not want\nto be violent, he went into protective custody.\n         Prior to trial, defendant was offered a six-year sentence. He turned it down\nbecause his wife said she bumped her head when she got in the truck. Defendant did not\nremember much about the day the incident happened, but knew he stopped her from\ndrinking and driving. He did not make the right decisions, but was under the impression\nhe had some type of reduced culpability.\n         If defendant were released from prison, he planned to enter a residential program\nsuch as the Salvation Army or Delancey Street, so he could learn to change his life. Both\nwere one- or two-year programs. Defendant represented he was accepted into Delancey\nStreet earlier, and had been accepted into the Salvation Army program since he had been\nin prison.\n         Defendant apologized for what he had done and stated he had learned his lesson.\nHe professed a desire to change his life. He stated he was ready to change his life and be\nsober.\n         At the conclusion of the hearing, defense counsel argued that anyone with strike\npriors would have a history like defendant, so something more was needed to show he\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger. Counsel argued the strikes were 17 and 18\nyears old, and the felony before the commitment offense was nine years earlier. Counsel\npointed to defendant’s lack of in-prison disciplinary record, and noted that if the current\ncase occurred now, defendant’s maximum sentence would be eight years. Counsel\nargued defendant wanted to change his life and was going to go into a program. Given\nall the circumstances, he asserted, the People had not met their burden of showing\ndefendant was an unreasonable risk.\n\n\n\n                                              7.\n\f       The prosecutor argued that being a good prisoner was not the same thing as being\na safe citizen. He acknowledged that anyone in a three strikes case had a history, but in\ndefendant’s case, the nature of that history, intervening events, and conduct showed he\nwas an unreasonable risk in society. The prosecutor argued that defendant had been\ngiven “break after break” and “program after program,” but had done nothing to stop and\nin fact was continuing to be violent. The prosecutor noted that although defendant’s\nstrike convictions were some time ago, defendant continued criminal conduct in the\nintervening time, including violence against women that resulted in injury even after his\ncompletion of a 52-week batterers’ course. The prosecutor also pointed out that\ndefendant did not even start his AA or mail-order programs until a month before he filed\nhis petition.\n       This ensued:\n\n              “THE COURT: … My concern is not whether today he would be\n       facing the same charges.… I spent probably the last month almost thinking\n       about it …, because … this does kind of make me think about, did I make a\n       mistake in that sentence?\n\n              “I was well aware of Romero[8] when I sentenced him. I knew I\n       could strike a strike. I have struck prior strikes as the DA’s Office\n       knows.…\n\n               “I think that Prop. 36 was based on the idea that judges would be\n       sentencing people to prison … for like a billy club when you are a two\n       striker. They were for thefts when you were a two striker. They were for\n       drugs, possession and even transportation and maybe even possession with\n       intent to sell. All of those would have been the kind of things I think that\n       the public was looking at. It’s hard for me to think that they intended\n       somebody … who I do believe is dangerous to be out again. I can’t think\n       of a better predictor of future conduct than past conduct.\n\n             “And as [the prosecutor] points out, what you do in prison really\n       doesn’t have a whole lot to do with what you do when you’re outside there\n\n8      People v. Superior Court (Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497.\n\n\n\n                                            8.\n\fand you have access to drugs and alcohol. In this case, primarily alcohol, I\nthink. I picture the idea of his coming home and living on Stewart Street\nand there are bars within a block. [¶] … [¶]\n\n       “THE DEFENDANT: I won’t come back to Sonora. I’ll go to\nDelancey Street. My wife’s bipolar. I’m done with domestic violence and\nI’m done with drinking. I’m ready to change my life. You guys got me\nscared straight.\n\n       “THE COURT: But we’ve heard that before. [¶] … [¶] … You had\na previous alcohol program; did you not? What did you do that time?\n\n       “THE DEFENDANT: Stole a bottle —\n\n       “THE COURT: But you did a program for alcohol?\n\n       “THE DEFENDANT: Yeah.\n\n       “THE COURT: How long of a program?\n\n       “THE DEFENDANT: I don’t know. Like, I was in AA and stuff\nfor a year and I stayed sober the whole time. It’s when I stopped\nparticipating in recovery that —\n\n       “THE COURT: Then you did a fifty-two week domestic violence\nprogram, yet we still have this offense with very serious — I think any time\nyou have sutures, that’s a big deal. Most people can be hit … without\nrequiring sutures. This was serious.\n\n       “THE DEFENDANT: Yeah. But see —\n\n       “THE COURT: I cannot bring myself to do this. I think he is a\ndanger to public safety. And as I said during the sentencing, he had nine\ngrants of probation and was on probation when this happened. It was for\nsomething fairly minor.… [¶] … [¶] … But this was serious injuries to a\nvictim and unprovoked. I just thought unprovoked. I could not and the\njury could not buy the idea that you had to do something and that it was\nabsolutely necessary for you to clobber on her to make her not drive. That\nwas just pure nonsense and I thought so at the time and obviously the jury\ndid too. [¶] … [¶] … I cannot grant this. I just feel that he is a danger. He\nis an unreasonable risk to public safety. And, in particular, to the women\nhe’s around. I just can’t do this.\n\n       “So I’m going to deny the petition.… [¶] … [¶]\n\n\n\n                                     9.\n\f              “THE DEFENDANT: I will be appealing this then. I have a right to\n       an appeal .… [¶] … [¶] … I went to trial, so this new law will attach to it,\n       so I would like for you to file a Notice of Appeal. [¶] … [¶] … Because I\n       can show it’s more likely than not that the Court would have accepted my\n       plea, so it’s not really genuine that you believe I’m a risk to public safety,\n       because you — the other three strikers with the same case would take deals.\n       [¶] … [¶] … I’m not a risk to public safety. This is not right.”\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Defendant says the trial court erred by denying his petition because (1) the court\nused the wrong standard, (2) the court failed to properly evaluate whether defendant\nposed an unreasonable risk to society, (3) the prosecution failed to meet its burden of\nestablishing dangerousness by a preponderance of the evidence, (4) the prosecution failed\nto meet its burden of establishing some evidence that defendant currently posed an\nunreasonable risk, and (5) the court should have sua sponte appointed an expert to\nevaluate defendant with respect to current dangerousness. Defendant further contends a\nsentence of 25 years to life constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the\nEighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and that the various errors violated\nhis due process rights. Finally, defendant contends the definition of “unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety” contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) applies to\nresentencing proceedings under the Act. We reject his arguments.\n                                              I*\n              The trial court did not err by denying defendant’s petition.\n       In order to be eligible for resentencing as a second strike offender under the Act,\nthe inmate petitioner must satisfy the three criteria set out in subdivision (e) of\nsection 1170.126.9 (People v. Superior Court (Martinez) (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 979,\n\n*      See footnote, ante, page 1.\n9      “An inmate is eligible for resentencing if: [¶] (1) The inmate is serving an\nindeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed pursuant to paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (e) of Section 667 or subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12 for a conviction of a\nfelony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent felonies by subdivision (c)\n\n\n                                             10.\n\f989.) If the inmate satisfies all these criteria, as did defendant, he or she “shall be\nresentenced [as a second strike offender] unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f).) In exercising this discretion, “the court may consider:\n[¶] (1) The [inmate’s] criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes\ncommitted, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and\nthe remoteness of the crimes; [¶] (2) The [inmate’s] disciplinary record and record of\nrehabilitation while incarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its\ndiscretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (g).)\n       The plain language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126 calls for an\nexercise of the sentencing court’s discretion. “‘Discretion is the power to make the\ndecision, one way or the other.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Carmony (2004) 33 Cal.4th 367,\n375.) “Where, as here, a discretionary power is statutorily vested in the trial court, its\nexercise of that discretion ‘must not be disturbed on appeal except on a showing that the\ncourt exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that\nresulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (People v.\nRodrigues (1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125; see People v. Williams (1998) 17 Cal.4th\n148, 162 [abuse-of-discretion review asks whether ruling in question falls outside bounds\nof reason under applicable law and relevant facts].) “‘“[T]he burden is on the party\n\n\nof Section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7. [¶] (2) The inmate’s current\nsentence was not imposed for any of the offenses appearing in clauses (i) to (iii),\ninclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or\nclauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of\nSection 1170.12. [¶] (3) The inmate has no prior convictions for any of the offenses\nappearing in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of\nSection 667 or clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of\nSection 1170.12.” (§ 1170.126, subd.

[Citation.] In the absence of such a showing, the trial court is presumed to\nhave acted to achieve legitimate sentencing objectives, and its discretionary\ndetermination … will not be set aside on review.”’ [Citation.]” (People v. Carmony,\nsupra, 33 Cal.4th at pp. 376-377.)\n        “Because ‘all discretionary authority is contextual’ [citation], we cannot determine\nwhether a trial court has acted irrationally or arbitrarily … without considering the legal\nprinciples and policies that should have guided the court’s actions.” (People v. Carmony,\nsupra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 377.) “An abuse of discretion is shown when the trial court\napplies the wrong legal standard. [Citation.]” (Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior\nCourt (2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 733.)\n        Under the clear language of section 1170.126, we review the trial court’s ultimate\ndetermination whether to resentence a petitioner for abuse of discretion. Of course, if\nthere is no evidence in the record to support the decision, the decision constitutes an\nabuse of discretion. (See In re Robert L. (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1066.) Thus, the\nquestions arise which party has the burden of producing such evidence, and to what\ndegree of certainty, and what level of support — what standard of proof — is required for\na trial court to rely on such evidence? (See People v. Mower (2002) 28 Cal.4th 457,\n476.)\n        Division Three of the Second District Court of Appeal has stated that, where a\ncourt’s discretion under section 1170.126, subdivision (f) is concerned, the People bear\nthe burden of proving “dangerousness” by a preponderance of the evidence. (People v.\nSuperior Court (Kaulick) (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1301-1305 & fn. 25 (Kaulick);\nsee Evid. Code, § 115.) That court determined this is so — and Apprendi v. New Jersey\n(2000) 530 U.S. 466 (Apprendi) and its progeny do not apply — because “dangerousness\nis not a factor which enhances the sentence imposed when a defendant is resentenced\n\n\n\n                                             12.\n\funder the Act; instead, dangerousness is a hurdle which must be crossed in order for a\ndefendant to be resentenced at all.” (Kaulick, supra, at p. 1303.)\n       We agree with Kaulick that the applicable standard is preponderance of the\nevidence.10 This does not mean, however, that the trial court must apply that standard in\nmaking its ultimate determination whether to resentence a petitioner, or we must review\nthat determination for substantial evidence.11 Nor does it mean evidence of\ndangerousness must preponderate over evidence of rehabilitation in order for\nresentencing to be denied. Instead, taking into account the language of subdivisions (f)\nand (g) of section 1170.126, we conclude it means the People have the burden of\nestablishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts from which a determination\nresentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\ncan reasonably be made.12 Stated another way, evidence showing a petitioner poses a\n\n\n10     We have previously discussed Kaulick in the context of the initial determination\nwhether an inmate is eligible for resentencing under the Act. (People v. Blakely (2014)\n225 Cal.App.4th 1042, 1058, 1060-1061; People v. Osuna (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1020,\n1033, 1039-1040.) Nothing we say here should be taken as disagreement with or\nmodification of those opinions. We deal here with a different aspect of the retrospective\nportion of the Act and a subject not before us in our prior cases.\n11      The substantial evidence test applies to an appellate court’s review of findings\nmade under the preponderance of the evidence standard. (People v. Wong (2010) 186\nCal.App.4th 1433, 1444.) Under that test, the appellate court reviews the record in the\nlight most favorable to the challenged finding, to determine whether it discloses evidence\nthat is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could\nmake the finding by a preponderance of the evidence. The appellate court “resolve[s] all\nconflicts in the evidence and questions of credibility in favor of the [finding], and …\nindulge[s] every reasonable inference the [trier of fact] could draw from the evidence.\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n12     Courts and parties have assumed whatever burden exists is on the People. (E.g.,\nPeople v. Flores (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1075-1076; Kaulick, supra, 215\nCal.App.4th at p. 1301, fn. 25.) Such allocation is in harmony with the language of\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (f) that an eligible petitioner “shall be resentenced …\nunless” the court makes the required determination.\n\n\n\n                                            13.\n\frisk of danger to public safety must be proven by the People by a preponderance of the\nevidence. The reasons a trial court finds resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger, or its weighing of evidence showing dangerousness versus evidence showing\nrehabilitation, lie within the court’s discretion. The ultimate determination that\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger is a discretionary one. While the\ndetermination must be supported by record evidence established by a preponderance, the\ntrial court need not itself find an unreasonable risk of danger by a preponderance of the\nevidence. (See In re Robert L., supra, 21 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1065-1067 [discussing\nabuse of discretion and preponderance of the evidence standards].)\n       Such an interpretation is consistent with California’s noncapital sentencing\nscheme.13 Under the determinate sentencing law (DSL) as it existed prior to\nCunningham v. California (2007) 549 U.S. 270 (Cunningham), “three terms of\nimprisonment [were] specified by statute for most offenses. The trial court’s discretion in\nselecting among [those] options [was] limited by section 1170, subdivision (b), which\ndirect[ed] that ‘the court shall order imposition of the middle term, unless there are\ncircumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime.’” (People v. Black (2007) 41\nCal.4th 799, 808, fn. omitted.) Trial courts had “broad discretion” to impose the lower or\nupper term instead of the middle term of imprisonment (People v. Scott (1994) 9 Cal.4th\n331, 349), and generally were required by the statutes and sentencing rules to state\nreasons for their discretionary sentencing choices (ibid.). Such reasons had to be\n“supported by a preponderance of the evidence in the record” and reasonably related to\nthe particular sentencing determination. (Ibid.; see former Cal. Rules of Court,\nrule 4.420(b).) Even after the DSL was reformed and amended in response to\n\n13     The determination of the appropriate penalty in a capital case “‘is “essentially\nmoral and normative …, and therefore … there is no burden of proof or burden of\npersuasion. [Citation.]” [Citation.]’ [Citations.]” (People v. McKinzie (2012) 54\nCal.4th 1302, 1362.)\n\n\n\n                                             14.\n\fCunningham, so as to eliminate judicial factfinding in selection of the appropriate term\nwhen three possible prison terms are specified by statute, establishment of facts by a\npreponderance of the evidence remains necessary with respect to certain discretionary\nsentencing decisions. (See In re Coley (2012) 55 Cal.4th 524, 557-558.)14\n       In People v. Sandoval (2007) 41 Cal.4th 825, 850-851, the California Supreme\nCourt stated that, in making its discretionary sentencing choices post-Cunningham, “the\ntrial court need only ‘state [its] reasons’ [citation]; it is not required to identify\naggravating and mitigating factors, apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, or\nspecify the ‘ultimate facts’ that ‘justify[] the term selected.’ [Citations.] Rather, the\ncourt must ‘state in simple language the primary factor or factors that support the exercise\nof discretion.’ [Citation.]” (Italics added.)\n       We do not read the foregoing statement as suggesting the People bear no burden in\na proceeding to determine whether a petitioner should be resentenced under the Act.\nSubdivision (g) of section 1170.126 contemplates the trial court’s consideration of\nevidence. It stands to reason someone must produce that evidence. Under Evidence\nCode section 115, “‘[b]urden of proof’ means the obligation of a party to establish by\nevidence a requisite degree of belief concerning a fact in the mind of the trier of fact or\nthe court.… [¶] Except as otherwise provided by law, the burden of proof requires proof\nby a preponderance of the evidence.”\n\n\n\n\n14      After Cunningham concluded the DSL violated a defendant’s Sixth Amendment\nright to a jury trial (Cunningham, supra, 549 U.S. at p. 281), the Legislature amended\nsection 1170 so that now “(1) the middle term is no longer the presumptive term absent\naggravating or mitigating facts found by the trial judge; and (2) a trial judge has the\ndiscretion to impose an upper, middle or lower term based on reasons he or she states.”\n(People v. Wilson (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 988, 992.) Subdivision (b) of section 1170\nstates the court “shall select the term which, in the court’s discretion, best serves the\ninterests of justice.”\n\n\n\n                                                15.\n\f       However, the trial court’s ultimate determination when considering a petition for\nresentencing under section 1170.126 — whether resentencing the petitioner would pose\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety — is analogous to an evaluation of the\nrelative weight of mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Such an evaluation “is not\nequivalent to a factual finding.” (People v. Black, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 814, fn. 4.) It\nfollows, then, that the trial court need not apply a preponderance of the evidence\nstandard, in that it need not find resentencing the petitioner would, more likely than not,\npose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (See Kaulick, supra, 215\nCal.App.4th at p. 1305, fn. 28 [preponderance standard means “‘more likely than not’”].)\n       Kaulick found the prosecution bears the burden of establishing “dangerousness”\nby a preponderance of the evidence against a claim the Apprendi line of cases requires\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1302.)\nAs a result, it had no real occasion to address the interplay between the burden of proof\nand the trial court’s exercise of discretion as that issue is presented here, or to clarify\nwhether the prosecution is required to establish “dangerousness” in the sense of facts\nupon which the trial court may base the ultimate determination resentencing a petitioner\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, or in the sense of establishing\nthat determination itself. Nevertheless, we believe it supports our interpretation. Kaulick\nstated, in part: “The maximum sentence to which Kaulick, and those similarly situated to\nhim, is subject was, and shall always be, the indeterminate life term to which he was\noriginally sentenced. While [the Act] presents him with an opportunity to be resentenced\nto a lesser term, unless certain facts are established, he is nonetheless still subject to the\nthird strike sentence based on the facts established at the time he was originally\nsentenced. As such, a court’s discretionary decision to decline to modify the sentence in\nhis favor can be based on any otherwise appropriate factor (i.e., dangerousness), and\nsuch factor need not be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.” (Id.\nat p. 1303, italics added.) The court further stated: “[I]t is the general rule in California\n\n                                              16.\n\fthat once a defendant is eligible for an increased penalty, the trial court, in exercising its\ndiscretion to impose that penalty, may rely on factors established by a preponderance of\nthe evidence. [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 1305, italics added.)\n          Finally, Kaulick rejected the suggestion a trial court could determine resentencing\na petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, yet still have the\ndiscretion to resentence that petitioner to a second strike term. (Kaulick, supra, 215\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1293-1294, fn. 12.) The court explained: “The language of …\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (f), states that the petitioner shall be resentenced unless the\ncourt finds an unreasonable risk of danger. It does not state that if the court finds an\nunreasonable risk of danger, it can nonetheless resentence the petitioner. In any event,\nthe ballot arguments in support of Proposition 36 emphasized that the Act would not\nbenefit ‘“truly dangerous criminals.”’ [Citation.] It is impossible to believe that the\nvoters intended to allow a court the discretion to resentence defendants whose\nresentencing that court had already found would present an unreasonable risk of danger.”\n(Ibid.)\n          We concur with Kaulick’s rejection of the argument. Nevertheless, it seems to us\nthat if the prosecution had the burden of proving the ultimate issue in a resentencing\nproceeding, a trial court necessarily would be divested of its discretion to resentence in\nany case in which that burden of proof was met. Yet the language of section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f) expressly provides the petitioner shall be resentenced unless the court, in\nits discretion, makes a determination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk\nof danger. The statute does not say the petitioner shall be resentenced unless the People\nprove resentencing would pose such a risk.\n          To summarize, a trial court need not determine, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that resentencing a petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety before it can properly deny a petition for resentencing under the Act. Nor is\nthe court’s ultimate determination subject to substantial evidence review. Rather, its\n\n                                               17.\n\ffinding will be upheld if it does not constitute an abuse of discretion, i.e., if it falls within\n“the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances being considered. [Citations.]” (People\nv. Giminez (1975) 14 Cal.3d 68, 72.) The facts or evidence upon which the court’s\nfinding of unreasonable risk is based must be proven by the People by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, however, and are themselves subject to our review for substantial\nevidence.15 If a factor (for example, that the petitioner recently committed a battery, is\nviolent due to repeated instances of mutual combat, etc.) is not established by a\npreponderance of the evidence, it cannot form the basis for a finding of unreasonable risk.\n(See People v. Cluff (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 991, 998 [trial court abuses its discretion\nwhen factual findings critical to decision find no support in record]; cf. People v. Read\n(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 685, 689-691 [where trial court erroneously determined defendant\nwas statutorily ineligible for probation, reviewing court was required to determine\nwhether trial court gave sufficient other reasons, supported by facts of case, for probation\ndenial].)\n       Applying these principles to the present case, and examining the record as a\nwhole, rather than cherry-picked fragments, it is readily apparent the trial court did not\nerr by denying defendant’s petition. We generally presume a trial court has properly\nfollowed established law. Although this presumption does not apply where the law was\nunclear or uncertain when the lower court acted (People v. Diaz (1992) 3 Cal.4th 495,\n567), Kaulick was decided several months before the sentencing court ruled on\ndefendant’s petition. Moreover, the parties’ pleadings and arguments, and the court’s\nown comments (either at the hearing itself or on one of the occasions when the matter\n\n\n\n\n15     “Substantial evidence,” not the significantly more deferential “some evidence”\nstandard applicable to review of executive branch decisions in parole cases (see In re\nRosenkrantz (2002) 29 Cal.4th 616, 658, 665), is the appropriate appellate standard.\n\n\n\n                                               18.\n\fwas continued) show the court was aware of which party had to establish what and to\nwhat level of certainty.\n       Contrary to defendant’s claim, the manner in which the court mentioned its prior\nRomero ruling does not suggest it mistook its broad authority to resentence defendant\nunder section 1170.126 for the limited authority to dismiss a strike under that case. Nor\ndo we agree with defendant’s assertion the court failed to properly evaluate whether\ndefendant posed an unreasonable risk to public safety by basing its finding solely on\ninformation it had at the time of the original sentencing. Evidence concerning the factors\nset out in subdivision (g) of section 1170.126, including defendant’s lack of in-prison\ndisciplinary record, his low-risk assessment score, and his attendance of AA meetings\nand participation in a mail-order anger management class, was all before the court (as\nwas the fact defendant only started participating in AA and the mail-order class about one\nmonth before he filed his resentencing petition). That the trial court may not have\nexpressly mentioned some of these factors does not mean it failed to consider them and,\nin the absence of any showing to the contrary, we presume it did so. (Evid. Code, § 664;\nsee Denham v. Superior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564; cf. People v. Sparks (1968) 262\nCal.App.2d 597, 600-601.) Defendant’s true argument is that the court did not credit\nthem in the manner and to the extent defendant thinks is appropriate. We find the court\nacted well within its discretion, however, and — again contrary to defendant’s claim —\nmade its finding based on its view of defendant’s current risk to society, a view that was\nsupported by record evidence.\n       Defendant says the prosecution failed to meet its burden of establishing\ndangerousness by a preponderance of the evidence. He apparently bases this on the fact\nhe presented witnesses while the People did not. The prosecutor adduced evidence\nthrough his cross-examination of defendant and defendant’s mother, however, and was\nentitled to rely on information (such as defendant’s criminal history, the circumstances of\nthe commitment offense, and defendant’s presently belated and previously unsuccessful\n\n                                            19.\n\frehabilitation efforts) that was already before the trial court and established at least by a\npreponderance.16 We have explained the applicable burden and standard of proof, ante.\nThe evidence before the court was sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to conclude\nresentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, as\nrequired by section 1170.126, subdivision (f).\n       Apparently analogizing a resentencing proceeding under the Act to a parole\nproceeding for an inmate serving a life term (see § 3041; In re Lawrence (2008) 44\nCal.4th 1181, 1223-1224), defendant chides the court for failing to appoint, sua sponte,\nan expert to evaluate defendant with respect to current dangerousness and his\npsychological or mental attitude. He says it is “clear” expert psychological evidence was\nrequired to address the issue of defendant’s current threat to society, if any. He is wrong.\n       Defendant cites Evidence Code section 730 for the proposition an expert may be\nappointed by a court sua sponte for the purpose of obtaining an impartial expert\nopinion.17 (See Mercury Casualty Co. v. Superior Court (1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 1027,\n1032.) That statute “does not authorize the appointment of experts after trial in\nconnection with sentencing proceedings.” (People v. Stuckey (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th\n898, 905; id. at p. 913.) Regardless of whether a proceeding under section 1170.126 is\nlikened to a trial or is part of a sentencing proceeding, “a trial court has inherent power,\nindependent of statute, to exercise its discretion and control over all proceedings relating\n\n\n16      “‘Evidence’ means testimony, writings, material objects, or other things presented\nto the senses that are offered to prove the existence or nonexistence of a fact.” (Evid.\nCode, § 140.)\n17     Evidence Code section 730 provides, in relevant part: “When it appears to the\ncourt, at any time before or during the trial of an action, that expert evidence is or may be\nrequired by the court …, the court on its own motion … may appoint one or more experts\nto investigate, to render a report as may be ordered by the court, and to testify as an\nexpert at the trial of the action relative to the fact or matter as to which the expert\nevidence is or may be required.”\n\n\n\n                                              20.\n\fto the litigation before it [citation],” including “the power to obtain evidence upon which\nthe judgment of the court may rest [citation].” (Johnson v. Banducci (1963) 212\nCal.App.2d 254, 260; see Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 967.)\nThus, it appears a court could appoint an expert, on its own motion, to conduct an\nevaluation concerning the risk of danger currently posed to public safety by an inmate\nseeking resentencing under the Act.18\n       However, “[t]he decision on the need for the appointment of an expert lies within\nthe discretion of the trial court and the trial court’s decision will not be set aside absent an\nabuse of that discretion. [Citations.]” (People v. Gaglione (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1291,\n1304, disapproved on other grounds in People v. Martinez (1995) 11 Cal.4th 434, 452 &\nPeople v. Levesque (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 530, 539; accord, People v. Vatelli (1971) 15\nCal.App.3d 54, 61; see In re Eric A. (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1390, 1394, fn. 4.) Whatever\nthe similarities between the decisions whether to resentence under the Act and to grant\nparole to an inmate serving a life term, appointment of an expert did not fall outside the\nbounds of reason in this case. The question before the court was whether resentencing\ndefendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Given the\ninformation already before the court, the court could make the required determination\nitself, without the input of an expert. As has been stated in the context of a claim the\nword “unreasonable” is impermissibly vague, “Surely a superior court judge is capable of\nexercising discretion, justly applying the public safety exception, and determining\nwhether a lesser sentence would pose an unreasonable risk of harm to the public safety.\n[Citation.]” (People v. Flores, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1075.)19\n\n18     Accordingly, we need not determine the source of a court’s authority to do so.\n19      In re Lawrence, supra, 44 Cal.4th 1181, does not hold to the contrary. In that\ncase, the Governor reversed a parole grant in part based on negative language found in\nearly psychiatric evaluations of the inmate that suggested the inmate’s release would pose\nan unreasonable risk of danger to the public. (Id. at pp. 1190, 1223.) The California\n\n\n                                              21.\n\f       Defendant next contends his sentence of 25 years to life constitutes cruel and\nunusual punishment as prohibited by the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution. We question whether this issue is properly before us, since the trial court\ndid not impose sentence, but merely left intact a sentence we already concluded was\nconstitutional. (People v. Valencia, supra, F059244.)\n       In any event, for the reasons we cited in People v. Ingram (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th\n1397, 1412-1416, disapproved on another ground in People v. Dotson (1997) 16 Cal.4th\n547, 560, footnote 8, defendant’s history of habitual criminal behavior renders his claim\nmeritless. It is not the current charge that qualifies defendant for this term, but rather his\nhistory as a repeat offender. “[H]abitual offender statutes have long withstood the\nconstitutional claim of cruel or unusual punishment. [Citations.]” (Ingram, at p. 1413.)\nDefendant has proven he holds little regard for the law and is immune to resultant\npunishments for his conduct. In this instance, “it becomes the duty of government to\nseek some other method to curb his criminal propensities that he might not continue to\nfurther inflict himself upon law-abiding members of society. This, we think, may be\ndone even to the extent of depriving him permanently of his liberty.…” (In re\nRosencrantz (1928) 205 Cal. 534, 539.)\n       Defendant appears to base his claim on the premise that because now an offender\nin his position would be sentenced to no more than eight years for violating\nsection 273.5, defendant’s sentence is unconstitutionally disproportionate. He says:\n\n\nSupreme Court rejected the Governor’s conclusion, stating: “[T]he passage of time is\nhighly probative to the determination before us, and reliance upon outdated psychological\nreports — clearly contradicted by [the inmate’s] successful participation in years of\nintensive therapy, a long series of reports declaring [the inmate] to be free of\npsychological problems and no longer a threat to public safety, and [the inmate’s] own\ninsight into her participation in this crime — does not supply some evidence justifying\nthe Governor’s conclusion that [the inmate] continues to pose a threat to public safety.”\n(Id. at p. 1224.)\n\n\n\n                                              22.\n\f“The sentence imposed for a violation of … section 273.5 for any other defendant in any\njurisdiction in California is not the same as [defendant’s] sentence. [Defendant] was\nsentenced to an indeterminate sentence while any other defendant would be sentenced to\nno more than eight years.”\n       Defendant’s premise is faulty. Any third strike offender convicted of violating\nsection 273.5 before the Act amended sections 667 and 1170.12 is serving a sentence of\nat least 25 years to life, like defendant, unless he or she has been determined not to pose\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Defendant cites no authority for the\nproposition that a subsequent downward modification in a statutorily prescribed sentence\nrenders unconstitutional a punishment that was constitutional when imposed. (See, e.g.,\nEwing v. California (2003) 538 U.S. 11, 28-31 (lead opn. of O’Connor, J.) [three strikes\nsentence of 25 years to life not unconstitutionally disproportionate where current offense\nwas grand theft].)\n       Last, defendant contends the various errors committed by the trial court in the\nsection 1170.126 proceeding and the disproportionality of his sentence violated his due\nprocess rights. He says the section 1170.126 hearing was fundamentally unfair because\nof the trial court’s errors and because the hearing was defendant’s “only shot at\nresentencing.”\n       We have rejected all defendant’s claims of error and cruel and unusual\npunishment. To the extent defendant may be arguing section 1170.126, subdivision (b)\nviolates due process because it limits a defendant to the filing of a single petition and\nrequires that, unless good cause is shown, the petition must be filed within two years after\nthe effective date of the Act, we find no fundamental unfairness. We reach the same\nconclusion if we interpret defendant’s argument as a claim that, because of the two-year\nlimit, he was unfairly deprived of the opportunity to demonstrate a lengthy period of\nnonviolence that would have allayed the trial court’s concerns. The ability to seek\nresentencing “is not constitutionally required, but an act of lenity on the part of the\n\n                                             23.\n\felectorate.” (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1304.)20 There was no due process\nviolation.\n                                              II\n         Section 1170.18, subdivision (c), enacted pursuant to Proposition 47,\n                  does not modify section 1170.126, subdivision (f).\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, “the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act” (hereafter Proposition 47). It went into effect the next day. (Cal.\nConst., art. II, § 10, subd. (a).) Insofar as is pertinent here, Proposition 47 renders\nmisdemeanors certain drug- and theft-related offenses that previously were felonies or\n“wobblers,” unless they were committed by certain ineligible defendants. Proposition 47\nalso created a new resentencing provision — section 1170.18 — by which a person\ncurrently serving a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor, may\npetition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the\noffense statutes as added or amended by Proposition 47. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).) A\nperson who satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a) of section 1170.18 shall have his or her\nsentence recalled and be “resentenced to a misdemeanor … unless the court, in its\n\n\n\n\n20      We express no opinion whether an inmate could bring more than one petition, or\nfile a petition and then seek a lengthy continuance in order to establish a prolonged\nperiod of rehabilitation, or whether the desire to establish such a period would constitute\ngood cause for filing a petition beyond the two-year period. The record established\nprevious attempts to rehabilitate defendant (through, for example, a 52-week batterers’\ncourse) were woefully unsuccessful. The evidence further suggested his current belated\nefforts were undertaken not for purposes of true rehabilitation, but with a view toward\nconvincing the court to resentence him. Moreover, his crimes were not particularly\nremote and his most recent offense involved violence his record amply demonstrated was\nnot an instance of aberrant behavior.\n\n\n\n                                              24.\n\fdiscretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (b).)21\n       Hidden in the lengthy, fairly abstruse text of the proposed law, as presented in the\nofficial ballot pamphlet — and nowhere called to voters’ attention — is the provision at\nissue in the present appeal. Subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 provides: “As used\nthroughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\nof clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\nSection 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) lists the following felonies, sometimes called\n“super strike” offenses:\n\n              “(I) A ‘sexually violent offense’ as defined in subdivision (b) of\n       Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n              “(II) Oral copulation with a child who is under 14 years of age, and\n       who is more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section\n       288a, sodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more\n       than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 286, or sexual\n       penetration with another person who is under 14 years of age, and who is\n       more than 10 years younger than he or she, as defined by Section 289.\n\n              “(III) A lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of\n       age, in violation of Section 288.\n\n              “(IV) Any homicide offense, including any attempted homicide\n       offense, defined in Sections 187 to 191.5, inclusive.\n\n              “(V) Solicitation to commit murder as defined in Section 653f.\n\n              “(VI) Assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, as\n       defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 245.\n\n\n\n21    Proposition 47 also created a process whereby eligible persons who have already\ncompleted their sentences may have the particular conviction or convictions designated\nas misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18, subds. (f), (g).)\n\n\n\n                                                25.\n\f             “(VII) Possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as defined in\n       paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 11418.\n\n              “(VIII) Any serious and/or violent felony offense punishable in\n       California by life imprisonment or death.”\n       The question is whether section 1170.18, subdivision (c) now limits a trial court’s\ndiscretion to deny resentencing under the Act to those cases in which resentencing the\ndefendant would pose an unreasonable risk he or she will commit a new “super strike”\noffense. Defendant says it does. The People disagree. We agree with the People.22\n\n\n22     We solicited supplemental briefing concerning Proposition 47. Among the\nquestions we asked counsel to answer were whether defendant met the criteria for\nresentencing under section 1170.18 and, if so, whether we needed to determine the\napplicability, if any, of section 1170.18, subdivision (c) to resentencing proceedings\nunder section 1170.126. We are satisfied it is appropriate for us to reach the issue of\napplicability regardless of whether defendant might obtain resentencing under\nProposition 47.\n        It appears that a number of inmates will be eligible to seek resentencing under\nboth the Act and Proposition 47. Such an inmate need not wait to file a petition under\nProposition 47 until the trial court’s ruling on the inmate’s petition under the Act is final.\nA trial court is not divested of jurisdiction over a Proposition 47 petition by the fact a\npetition under the Act is pending, whether in a trial court or a Court of Appeal, with\nrespect to the same inmate. (Cf. People v. Mayfield (1993) 5 Cal.4th 220, 222-227;\nPeople v. Johnson (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1183, 1256-1257; People v. Alanis (2008) 158\nCal.App.4th 1467, 1472-1473.) While the general rule is that “an appeal from an order in\na criminal case removes the subject matter of that order from the jurisdiction of the trial\ncourt [citations]” (Anderson v. Superior Court (1967) 66 Cal.2d 863, 865), the subject\nmatter of a ruling on a petition under the Act is legally independent from a petition under\nProposition 47 (see People v. Superior Court (Gregory) (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 324,\n332).\n       In light of the differences between the two proceedings — for instance, an inmate\nresentenced under Proposition 47 is generally subject to one year of parole (§§ 1170.18,\nsubd. (d), 3000.08), while an inmate resentenced under the Act is subject to up to three\nyears of postrelease community supervision (§ 3451; People v. Tubbs (2014) 230\nCal.App.4th 578, 585-586, petn. for review pending, petn. filed Nov. 12, 2014; People v.\nEspinoza (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 635, 637-638) — we express no opinion concerning\nwhether the granting of a Proposition 47 petition would render moot resentencing\nproceedings, whether in a trial court or on appeal, under the Act.\n\n\n\n                                             26.\n\f       “‘In interpreting a voter initiative …, we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction. [Citation.]’ [Citation.] ‘“The fundamental purpose of statutory\nconstruction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of\nthe law. [Citations.]”’ [Citation.]” (People v. Superior Court (Cervantes) (2014) 225\nCal.App.4th 1007, 1014.) Thus, in the case of a provision adopted by the voters, “their\nintent governs. [Citations.]” (People v. Jones (1993) 5 Cal.4th 1142, 1146.)\n       To determine intent, “‘we look first to the words themselves. [Citations.]’”\n(People v. Superior Court (Cervantes), supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1014.) We give the\nstatute’s words “‘a plain and commonsense meaning. [Citation.] We do not, however,\nconsider the statutory language “in isolation.” [Citation.] Rather, we look to “the entire\nsubstance of the statute … in order to determine the scope and purpose of the\nprovision .… [Citation.]” [Citation.] That is, we construe the words in question “‘in\ncontext, keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute .…’ [Citation.]”\n[Citation.] We must harmonize “the various parts of a statutory enactment … by\nconsidering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a\nwhole.” [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Acosta (2002) 29 Cal.4th 105, 112.) We\n“accord[] significance, if possible, to every word, phrase and sentence in pursuance of the\nlegislative purpose. A construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.…\n[S]tatutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized, both\ninternally and with each other, to the extent possible. [Citations.]” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v.\nFair Employment & Housing Com. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387.)\n       “‘“When statutory language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for\nconstruction and courts should not indulge in it.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v.\nHendrix (1997) 16 Cal.4th 508, 512.) On its face, “[a]s used throughout this Code,” as\nemployed in section 1170.18, subdivision (c), clearly and unambiguously refers to the\nPenal Code, not merely section 1170.18 or the other provisions contained in\nProposition 47. (See People v. Bucchierre (1943) 57 Cal.App.2d 153, 164-165, 166; see\n\n                                            27.\n\falso Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist. (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1254-\n1255; People v. Vasquez (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 763, 766.)\n       This does not mean, however, that the definition contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) must inexorably be read into section 1170.126, subdivision (f). (Cf.\nMarshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist., supra, 119 Cal.App.4th at p. 1255.) “The\nliteral language of a statute does not prevail if it conflicts with the lawmakers’ intent .…\n[Citations.]” (People v.

City of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 726, 733.) Rather, “the literal meaning\nof a statute must be in accord with its purpose.” (People v. Mohammed (2008) 162\nCal.App.4th 920, 927.) “[I]t is settled that the language of a statute should not be given a\nliteral meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences that the [voters] did not\nintend” (In re Michele D. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 600, 606), or would “frustrate[] the manifest\npurposes of the legislation as a whole .…” (People v. Williams (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th\n1389, 1393.) “To this extent, therefore, intent prevails over the letter of the law and the\nletter will be read in accordance with the spirit of the enactment. [Citation.]” (In re\nMichele D., supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 606; accord, People v. Ledesma (1997) 16 Cal.4th 90,\n95.)\n       Thus, “‘we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be\nachieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy,\ncontemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the\nstatute is a part. [Citations.]’ [Citation.] We also ‘“refer to other indicia of the voters’\nintent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.”\n[Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1034.) We\nconsider “the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation” (Dyna-Med,\nInc. v. Fair Employment & Housing Com., supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1387), as well as “the\nwider historical circumstances” of the statute’s or statutes’ enactment (ibid.). “‘Using\n\n                                             28.\n\fthese extrinsic aids, we “select the construction that comports most closely with the\napparent intent of the [electorate], with a view to promoting rather than defeating the\ngeneral purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd\nconsequences.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 1034-1035.)\n       Proposition 47 and the Act address related, but not identical, subjects. As we\nexplain, reading them together, and considering section 1170.18, subdivision (c) in the\ncontext of the statutory framework as a whole (see People v. Acosta, supra, 29 Cal.4th at\np. 112; Lakin v. Watkins Associated Industries (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 658-659; In re\nCindy B. (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 771, 781), we conclude its literal meaning does not\ncomport with the purpose of the Act, and applying it to resentencing proceedings under\nthe Act would frustrate, rather than promote, that purpose and the intent of the electorate\nin enacting both initiative measures (see People v. Disibio (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1,\n5).\n       As is evidenced by its title, the Act was aimed solely at revising the three strikes\nlaw. That law, as originally enacted by the Legislature, was described by us as follows:\n\n               “Under the three strikes law, defendants are punished not just for\n       their current offense but for their recidivism. Recidivism in the\n       commission of multiple felonies poses a danger to society justifying the\n       imposition of longer sentences for subsequent offenses. [Citation.] The\n       primary goals of recidivist statutes are: ‘… to deter repeat offenders and, at\n       some point in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses\n       serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the\n       rest of society for an extended period of time. This segregation and its\n       duration are based not merely on that person’s most recent offense but also\n       on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which\n       he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. Like the line\n       dividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will\n       be deemed to have demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount\n       of time that the recidivist will be isolated from society are matters largely\n       within the discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.’ [Citation.]\n\n\n\n                                             29.\n\f               “By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature acknowledged the\n       will of Californians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and\n       incapacitation be given precedence in determining the appropriate\n       punishment for crimes. Further, those goals were best achieved by\n       ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater punishment’ for second and\n       third ‘strikers.’” (People v. Cooper (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 815, 823-\n       824.)23\n       A few months before the November 6, 2012, election, the California Supreme\nCourt observed: “One aspect of the [three strikes] law that has proven controversial is\nthat the lengthy punishment prescribed by the law may be imposed not only when … a\ndefendant [who has previously been convicted of one or more serious or violent felonies]\nis convicted of another serious or violent felony but also when he or she is convicted of\nany offense that is categorized under California law as a felony. This is so even when the\ncurrent, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely perceived as\nrelatively minor. [Citations.]” (In re Coley (2012) 55 Cal.4th 524, 528-529.)\n       Clearly, by approving the Act, voters resolved this controversy in favor of strike\noffenders. Thus, one of the “Findings and Declarations” of the Act stated the Act would\n“[r]estore the Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life\nsentences only when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.”\n(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of proposed law, § 1, p. 105.)\nNowhere, however, do the ballot materials for the Act suggest voters intended essentially\nto open the prison doors to existing third strike offenders in all but the most egregious\ncases, as would be the result if the definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\n\n23      The foregoing applies equally to the three strikes initiative measure that added\nsection 1170.12 to the Penal Code. The following statement of intent preceded the text of\nthe statute in Proposition 184, which was approved by voters on November 8, 1994: “‘It\nis the intent of the People of the State of California in enacting this measure to ensure\nlonger prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have\nbeen previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.’” (See Historical\nand Statutory Notes, 50C West’s Ann. Pen. Code (2004 ed.) foll. § 1170.12, p. 239.)\n\n\n\n                                            30.\n\fsafety’” contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) were engrafted onto resentencing\nproceedings under section 1170.126, subdivision (f). That voters did not intend such a\nresult is amply demonstrated by the fact an indeterminate life term remains mandatory\nunder the Act for a wide range of current offenses even if the offender does not have a\nprior conviction for a “super strike” offense (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)),\nand that an inmate is rendered ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 for an\narray of reasons beyond his or her having suffered such a prior conviction (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (e)(2)).\n       The Act clearly placed public safety above the cost savings likely to accrue as a\nresult of its enactment. Thus, uncodified section 7 of the Act provides: “This act is an\nexercise of the public power of the people of the State of California for the protection of\nthe health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of California, and shall be\nliberally construed to effectuate those purposes.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 6, 2012), supra, text of proposed law, p. 110, original italics omitted, italics\nadded.) As we explained in People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1036,\n“Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat [citation], ‘[e]nhancing public\nsafety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].”\n       In contrast, Proposition 47 — while titled “the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools\nAct” — emphasized monetary savings. The “Findings and Declarations” state: “The\npeople of the State of California find and declare as follows: [¶] The people enact the\nSafe Neighborhoods and Schools Act to ensure that prison spending is focused on violent\nand serious offenses, to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime, and to\ninvest the savings generated from this act into prevention and support programs in K-12\nschools, victim services, and mental health and drug treatment. This act ensures that\nsentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes like rape, murder, and child\nmolestation are not changed.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text\nof proposed law, § 2, p. 70.) Uncodified section 15 of the measure provides: “This act\n\n                                             31.\n\fshall be broadly construed to accomplish its purposes,” while uncodified section 18\nstates: “This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, text of proposed law, p. 74.)\nProposition 47 requires misdemeanor sentences for various drug possession and property\noffenses, unless the perpetrator has a prior conviction for a “super strike” offense or for\nan offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c).\n(Health & Saf. Code, §§ 11350, subd. (a), 11357, subd. (a), 11377, subd. (a); §§ 459.5,\nsubd. (a), 473, subd. (b), 476a, subd. (b), 490.2, subd. (a), 496, subd. (a), 666, subd. (b).)\nSection 1170.18 renders ineligible for resentencing only those inmates whose current\noffense would now be a misdemeanor, but who have a prior conviction for a “super\nstrike” offense or for an offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to\nsection 290, subdivision (c). (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (i).)\n       Nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47 were voters given any\nindication that initiative, which dealt with offenders whose current convictions would\nnow be misdemeanors rather than felonies, had any impact on the Act, which dealt with\noffenders whose current convictions would still be felonies, albeit not third strikes. For\ninstance, the Official Title and Summary stated, in pertinent part, that Proposition 47\nwould “[r]equire[] resentencing for persons serving felony sentences for these offenses[,\ni.e., offenses that require misdemeanor sentences under the measure] unless court finds\nunreasonable public safety risk.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014),\nsupra, official title and summary, p. 34.) In explaining what Proposition 47 would do,\nthe Legislative Analyst stated: “This measure reduces penalties for certain offenders\nconvicted of nonserious and nonviolent property and drug crimes. This measure also\nallows certain offenders who have been previously convicted of such crimes to apply for\nreduced sentences.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra,\nanalysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 35, italics added.) With respect to the\nresentencing provision, the Legislative Analyst explained:\n\n                                              32.\n\f               “This measure allows offenders currently serving felony sentences\n       for the above crimes[, i.e., grand theft, shoplifting, receiving stolen\n       property, writing bad checks, check forgery, and drug possession] to apply\n       to have their felony sentences reduced to misdemeanor sentences. In\n       addition, certain offenders who have already completed a sentence for a\n       felony that the measure changes could apply to the court to have their\n       felony conviction changed to a misdemeanor. However, no offender who\n       has committed a specified severe crime could be resentenced or have their\n       conviction changed. In addition, the measure states that a court is not\n       required to resentence an offender currently serving a felony sentence if the\n       court finds it likely that the offender will commit a specified severe crime.\n       Offenders who are resentenced would be required to be on state parole for\n       one year, unless the judge chooses to remove that requirement.” (Id. at\n       p. 36, italics added.)\n       Similarly, the arguments in favor of and against Proposition 47 spoke in terms\nsolely of Proposition 47, and never mentioned the Act. The Argument in Favor of\nProposition 47 spoke in terms of prioritizing serious and violent crime so as to stop\nwasting prison space “on petty crimes,” stop “wasting money on warehousing people in\nprisons for nonviolent petty crimes,” and stop California’s overcrowded prisons from\n“incarcerating too many people convicted of low-level, nonviolent offenses.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument in favor of Prop. 47,\np. 38.) The Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 47 reiterated these themes, and\nnever suggested Proposition 47 would have any effect on resentencing under the Act.\n(See Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.) Although the Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 47\nasserted 10,000 inmates would be eligible for early release under the measure, and that\nmany of them had prior convictions “for serious crimes, such as assault, robbery and\nhome burglary” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to\nargument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38), there is no suggestion the early release provisions\nwould extend to inmates whose current offenses remained felonies under the Act. The\nsame is true of the discussion of resentencing contained in the Argument Against\n\n\n\n\n                                            33.\n\fProposition 47. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.)\n       In light of the foregoing, we cannot reasonably conclude voters intended the\ndefinition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) to apply to that phrase as it appears in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), despite the former section’s preamble, “As used throughout this\nCode .…” Voters cannot intend something of which they are unaware.\n       We are cognizant one of the Act’s authors has taken the position Proposition 47’s\ndefinition of “unreasonable risk of danger” applies to resentencing proceedings under the\nAct. (St. John & Gerber, Prop. 47 Jolts Landscape of California Justice System (Nov. 5,\n2014) Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-ff-pol-\nproposition47-20141106-story.html> [as of Dec. 16, 2014].) Looking at the information\nconveyed to voters, however, this clearly was not their intent and so an author’s desire is\nof no import. (Cf. People v. Garcia (2002) 28 Cal.4th 1166, 1175-1176, fn. 5; People v.\nBradley (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 64, 83; Kaufman & Broad Communities, Inc. v.\nPerformance Plastering, Inc. (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 26, 30.)\n       We are also mindful “it has long been settled that ‘[t]he enacting body is deemed\nto be aware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is\nenacted’ [citation], ‘and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof’ [citation].\n‘This principle applies to legislation enacted by initiative. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]”\n(People v. Superior Court (Cervantes), supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1015; accord, In re\nLance W. (1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 890, fn. 11.) Thus, we presume voters were aware\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), had been judicially construed as not being impermissibly vague, but as\nnevertheless having no fixed definition. (People v. Garcia (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 763,\n769-770, petn. for review pending, petn. filed Nov. 18, 2014; People v. Flores (2014) 227\nCal.App.4th 1070, 1075.) Because nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47\n\n                                             34.\n\fwas it called to voters’ attention the definition of the phrase contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) would apply to resentencing proceedings under the Act, we simply cannot\nconclude voters intended Proposition 47 to alter the Act in that respect. Voters are not\nasked or presumed to be able to discern all potential effects of a proposed initiative\nmeasure; this is why they are provided with voter information guides containing not only\nthe actual text of such a measure, but also a neutral explanation and analysis by the\nLegislative Analyst and arguments in support of and in opposition to the measure. As we\nhave already observed, none of those materials so much as hinted that Proposition 47\ncould have the slightest effect on resentencing under the Act. (Cf. Marshall v. Pasadena\nUnified School Dist., supra, 119 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1255-1256 [legislative history of\nenactment included information bill would add definition of particular term to Public\nContract Code].)24\n       We are asked to infer an intent to extend section 1170.18, subdivision (c)’s\ndefinition to proceedings under section 1170.126 because the phrase in question only\nappears in those sections of the Penal Code. We cannot do so. The only resentencing\nmentioned in the Proposition 47 ballot materials was resentencing for inmates whose\ncurrent offenses would be reduced to misdemeanors, not those who would still warrant\nsecond strike felony terms. There is a huge difference, both legally and in public safety\nrisked, between someone with multiple prior serious and/or violent felony convictions\nwhose current offense is (or would be, if committed today) a misdemeanor, and someone\nwhose current offense is a felony. Accordingly, treating the two groups differently for\nresentencing purposes does not lead to absurd results, but rather is eminently logical.\n\n24     For the same reasons, we reject any suggestion the definition contained in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) was intended to clarify the true meaning of\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f). (Cf. Re-Open Rambla, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1995) 39\nCal.App.4th 1499, 1511; In re Connie M. (1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1225, 1238.)\n\n\n\n                                             35.\n\f       We recognize “[i]t is an established rule of statutory construction … that when\nstatutes are in pari materia similar phrases appearing in each should be given like\nmeanings. [Citations.]” (People v. Caudillo (1978) 21 Cal.3d 562, 585, overruled on\nanother ground in People v. Martinez (1999) 20 Cal.4th 225, 229, 237, fn. 6 &\ndisapproved on another ground in People v. Escobar (1992) 3 Cal.4th 740, 749-751 &\nfn. 5; see Robbins v. Omnibus R. Co. (1867) 32 Cal. 472, 474.) We question whether\nProposition 47 and the Act are truly in pari materia: That phrase means “[o]n the same\nsubject; relating to the same matter” (Black’s Law Dict. (9th ed. 2009) p. 862), and the\ntwo measures (albeit with some overlap) address different levels of offenses and\noffenders. In any event, “canons of statutory construction are merely aids to ascertaining\nprobable legislative intent” (Stone v. Superior Court (1982) 31 Cal.3d 503, 521, fn. 10);\nthey are “mere guides and will not be applied so as to defeat the underlying legislative\nintent otherwise determined [citation]” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing\nCom., supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1391).\n       The Act was intended to reform the three strikes law while keeping intact that\nscheme’s core commitment to public safety. Allowing trial courts broad discretion to\ndetermine whether resentencing an eligible petitioner under the Act “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)) clearly furthers the\nAct’s purpose. Whatever the wisdom of Proposition 47’s policy of near-universal\nresentencing where misdemeanants are concerned — and “[i]t is not for us to gainsay the\nwisdom of this legislative choice” (Bernard v. Foley (2006) 39 Cal.4th 794, 813) —\nconstraining that discretion so that all but the worst felony offenders are released\nmanifestly does not, nor does it comport with voters’ intent in enacting either measure.\n       Accordingly, Proposition 47 has no effect on defendant’s petition for resentencing\nunder the Act. Defendant is not entitled to a remand so the trial court can redetermine\ndefendant’s entitlement to resentencing under the Act utilizing the definition of\n\n\n\n                                             36.\n\f“‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c).25\n                                     DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n                                                                _____________________\n                                                                           DETJEN, J.\nI CONCUR:\n\n\n _____________________\n LEVY, Acting P.J.\n\n\n\n\n25     Recently, the Third District Court of Appeal held section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c)’s definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” does not\napply retroactively to defendants whose petitions for resentencing under the Act were\ndecided before the effective date of Proposition 47. (People v. Chaney (Dec. 1, 2014,\nC073949) ___ Cal.App.4th ___, ___-___ [2014 D.A.R. 15934, 15935-15936].) Chaney\ndid not decide whether Proposition 47’s definition applies prospectively to such petitions.\n(Chaney, supra, at p. ___, fn. 3 [2014 D.A.R. 15934, 15936, fn. 3].) Were we to\nconclude section 1170.18, subdivision (c) modifies section 1170.126, subdivision (f), we\nwould agree with Chaney that it does not do so retroactively. We believe, however, that\na finding of nonretroactivity inexorably leads to the possibility of prospective-only\napplication, and that prospective-only application of Proposition 47’s definition to\nresentencing petitions under the Act would raise serious, perhaps insurmountable, equal\nprotection issues. “Mindful of the serious constitutional questions that might arise were\nwe to accept a literal construction of the statutory language, and of our obligation\nwherever possible both to carry out the intent of the electorate and to construe statutes so\nas to preserve their constitutionality [citations]” (People v. Skinner (1985) 39 Cal.3d 765,\n769), we rest our holding on the reasoning set out in our opinion, ante.\n\n\n\n                                            37.\n\fPEÑA, J.,\n       I concur in the judgment and the majority opinion with the exception of part II. I\nagree defendant may not take advantage of Proposition 47’s1 newly enacted definition of\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as provided in Penal Code section\n1170.18, subdivision (c) (1170.18(c)). I do so not because there is any ambiguity in the\nlanguage used in section 1170.18(c) or the notion that the statute does not mean what it\nsays, i.e., that the new definition applies “throughout this Code.” Rather, in my view,\nthere is no indication the electorate, in enacting section 1170.18(c), intended it to apply\nretroactively to resentencing determinations under Proposition 36, the Three Strikes\nReform Act of 2012 (the Act).\nI.     After November 4, 2014, the definition of “unreasonable risk of danger” in\n       Section 1170.18(c) applies throughout the Penal Code\n       Section 1170.18(c) provides: “As used throughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a\nnew violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph\n(2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\n       This section and subdivision were enacted on November 4, 2014, when California\nvoters passed Proposition 47, long past the time of defendant’s resentencing hearing.\nUnless the legislation was designed or intended to apply retroactively, the definition in\nsection 1170.18(c) cannot apply to defendant. This is the only inquiry we must make to\nresolve the issue of whether the definition in section 1170.18(c) applies to defendant.\nHowever, the majority has opted to determine whether the new definition applies to any\nresentencing provisions under the Act, past, present, or future. I respectfully disagree\nwith the majority’s analysis and conclusion on this broader issue.\n\n\n1The Safe Neighborhood and Schools Act (Prop. 47, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014)).\n\f               “‘When construing a statute, we must “ascertain the intent of the\n       Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.”’ [Citations.] ‘[W]e\n       begin with the words of a statute and give these words their ordinary\n       meaning.’ [Citation.] ‘If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,\n       then we need go no further.’ [Citation.] If, however, the language supports\n       more than one reasonable construction, we may consider ‘a variety of\n       extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to\n       be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous\n       administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is\n       a part.’ [Citation.] Using these extrinsic aids, we ‘select the construction\n       that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with\n       a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,\n       and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.’\n       [Citation.]” (People v. Sinohui (2002) 28 Cal.4th 205, 211-212.)\n       Where the statutory language is so clear and unambiguous, there is no need for\nstatutory construction or to resort to legislative materials or other outside sources.\n(Quarterman v. Kefauver (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1371.) Absent ambiguity, it is\npresumed the voters intend the meaning apparent on the face of an initiative measure, and\nthe courts may not add to the statute or rewrite it to conform to a presumed intent not\napparent in its language. (People v. ex rel. Lungren v. Superior Court (1996) 14 Cal.4th\n294, 301.)\n       In determining whether the words enacted here are unambiguous, we do not write\non a blank slate. For example, in Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist. (2004) 119\nCal.App.4th 1241, 1255, the court stated there “is nothing ambiguous about the phrase\n‘as used in this code.’” It held the definition of “Emergency, as used in this code”\napplied to the entire Public Contract Code, and it was not limited to a particular chapter,\narticle, or division of that code. Also, in People v. Bucchierre (1943) 57 Cal.App.2d 153,\n166, the court held: “The words ‘as in this code provided’ (Penal Code, § 182) refer to\nthe Penal Code.”\n       In a similar vein, the court in People v. Leal (2004) 33 Cal.4th 999, 1007-1008,\napplied the plain meaning rule as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\f               “The statutory language of the provision defining ‘duress’ in each of\n       the rape statutes is clear and unambiguous. The definition of ‘duress’ in\n       both the rape and spousal rape statutes begins with the phrase, ‘As used in\n       this section, “duress” means ….’ (§§ 261, subd. (b), 262, subd. (c).) This\n       clear language belies any legislative intent to apply the definitions of\n       ‘duress’ in the rape and spousal rape statutes to any other sexual offenses.\n\n              “Starting from the premise that in 1990 the Legislature incorporated\n       into the rape statute a definition of ‘duress’ that already was in use for other\n       sexual offenses, defendant argues that the Legislature must have intended\n       its 1993 amendment of the definition of ‘duress’ in the rape statute, and the\n       incorporation of this new definition into the spousal rape statute, to apply as\n       well to other sexual offenses that use the term ‘duress.’ Defendant\n       observes: ‘The legislative history does not suggest any rationale for why\n       the Legislature would want its 1993 amendment of the definition of\n       “duress” to apply only to rape so that it would have one meaning when the\n       rape statutes use the phrase “force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of\n       immediate and unlawful bodily injury” but another, much more expansive\n       meaning when the identical phrase is used in the statutes defining sodomy,\n       lewd acts on a child, oral copulation and foreign object rape.’\n\n               “But the Legislature was not required to set forth its reasons for\n       providing a different definition of ‘duress’ for rape and spousal rape than\n       has been used in other sexual offenses; it is clear that it did so. ‘When\n       “‘statutory language is … clear and unambiguous there is no need for\n       construction, and courts should not indulge in it.’” [Citations.] The plain\n       meaning of words in a statute may be disregarded only when that meaning\n       is “‘repugnant to the general purview of the act,’ or for some other\n       compelling reason ….” [Citations.]’ [Citation.] As we said in an\n       analogous situation: ‘It is our task to construe, not to amend, the statute.\n       “In the construction of a statute … the office of the judge is simply to\n       ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not\n       to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted ….”\n       [Citation.] We may not, under the guise of construction, rewrite the law or\n       give the words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the\n       terms used.’ [Citation.]”\n       The majority pays lip service to the plain meaning rule and then ignores it. While\nacknowledging the language used is unambiguous, it nonetheless engages in statutory\nconstruction to determine whether the electorate really intended to say what it actually\nenacted. The end result is a rewriting of the statute so that it comports with the majority’s\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fview of what the voters really intended. The majority has rewritten section 1170.18(c) so\nthat it now states: “As used in this section only, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’ means ….” The majority does so without providing a compelling reason to do so\nand without showing the plain language used has a “‘meaning [that] is “‘repugnant to the\ngeneral purview of the act.’”’” (People v. Leal, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 1008.) Because\nthe Act had not previously defined the phrase “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety,” the definition in section 1170.18(c) cannot be repugnant or contradictory to the\nAct, nor does the majority claim the definition is repugnant to the general purview of\nProposition 47. For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with the majority on this part of\nthe opinion.\nII.    Section 1170.18(c) has no application to defendant’s resentencing under the\n       Act\n       I do concur in the result because there is nothing in Proposition 47 to indicate the\ndefinition enacted under section 1170.18(c) is to be applied retroactively to defendant\nunder the Act.\n       I begin my analysis with section 3 of the Penal Code, which provides that “[n]o\npart of it is retroactive, unless expressly so declared.” “Whether a statute operates\nprospectively or retroactively is, at least in the first instance, a matter of legislative intent.\nWhen the Legislature has not made its intent on the matter clear,” section 3 provides the\ndefault rule. (People v. Brown (2012) 54 Cal.4th 314, 319.) Proposition 47 is silent on\nthe question of whether it applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act. The\nanalysis of Proposition 47 by the legislative analyst and the arguments for and against\nProposition 47 are also silent on this question. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014) pp. 34-39.) Because the statute contains no express declaration that\nsection 1170.18(c) applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act, and there is no\nclearly implied intent of retroactivity in the legislative history, the default rule applies.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4.\n\f       Defendant relies on People v. Sandoval (2007) 41 Cal.4th 825 to support his\nposition the new definition should be applied retroactively to cases like his, which are\ncurrently pending appeal from a denial of resentencing under the Act. However, the\nSandoval case presented much different considerations from those present here. There,\nthe court granted review for the following reasons:\n\n       “[T]o determine whether defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights as defined in\n       Cunningham v. California (2007) 549 U.S. 270 … were violated by the\n       imposition of an upper term sentence and, if so, the remedy to which [he or]\n       she is entitled. In Cunningham, the United States Supreme Court disagreed\n       with this court’s decision in People v. Black (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1238 … and\n       held that California’s determinate sentencing law … violates a defendant’s\n       federal constitutional right to a jury trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth\n       Amendments to the United States Constitution by assigning to the trial\n       judge, rather than to the jury, the authority to find the facts that render a\n       defendant eligible for an upper term sentence. We conclude that\n       defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was violated and,\n       although harmless error analysis applies to such violations, the error in the\n       present case was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and the case must\n       be remanded for resentencing. For the reasons explained below, we also\n       conclude that upon remand, the trial court may exercise its discretion to\n       impose any of the three terms available for defendant’s offense.” (People\n       v. Sandoval, supra, 41 Cal.4th at pp. 831-832.)\n       In the interim between People v. Black, supra, 35 Cal.4th 1238 and People v.\nSandoval, supra, 41 Cal.4th 825, the Legislature amended the determinate sentencing law\nto cure its constitutional defect as found in Cunningham v. California, supra, 549 U.S.\n270. Although the Legislature failed to provide for retroactive application, the Sandoval\ncourt decided it was responsible for fashioning “a constitutional procedure for\nresentencing in cases in which Cunningham requires a reversal of an upper term\nsentence.” (People v. Sandoval, supra, at p. 846.) The court explained:\n\n              “If we assume that the new legislation does not apply directly to\n       cases pending on appeal that are remanded for resentencing, our task in\n       deciding the appropriate sentencing procedure to be applied by a trial court\n       on remand is somewhat analogous to what we faced in In re Hawthorne\n       [(2005)] 35 Cal.4th 40. There, the Legislature enacted a statute intended to\n\n\n                                             5.\n\f       implement the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Atkins v. Virginia\n       (2002) 536 U.S. 304, which held that the federal Constitution prohibits\n       execution of the mentally retarded. (See In re Hawthorne, supra, 35\n       Cal.4th at p. 44.) The legislation, however, did not provide for cases in\n       which the death penalty already had been imposed. (In re Hawthorne,\n       supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 45.) In such a situation, ‘[t]he task thus falls to this\n       court to formulate appropriate procedures for resolving postconviction\n       claims.’ (Ibid.)\n\n               “In Hawthorne, we adopted procedures for postconviction claims\n       that tracked the statute ‘as closely as logic and practicality permit,’ in order\n       ‘to maintain consistency with our own [state’s] legislation … and to avoid\n       due process and equal protection implications.’ (In re Hawthorne, supra,\n       35 Cal.4th at p. 47.) Likewise, in the present case, we direct that\n       sentencing proceedings to be held in cases that are remanded because the\n       sentence imposed was determined to be erroneous under Cunningham,\n       supra, 549 U.S. 270, are to be conducted in a manner consistent with the\n       amendments to the [determinate sentencing law] adopted by the\n       Legislature.” (People v. Sandoval, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 846.)\n       In this case, there is no constitutional violation in the manner the trial court\nconducted its sentencing determination. Thus, there is no occasion to remand this case,\nand we instead affirm the trial court’s determination. Defendant has identified no due\nprocess or equal protection concerns that might invalidate Proposition 47 or the Act if he\nis denied retroactive application.2 I perceive none.\n       Although defendant has not relied upon In re Estrada (1965) 63 Cal.2d 740 to\nargue retroactive application, the People have cited it as distinguishable from this case. I\ndiscuss the Estrada case out of an abundance of caution.\n       In Estrada, the court stated:\n\n       “When the Legislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment it\n       has obviously expressly determined that its former penalty was too severe\n       and that a lighter punishment is proper as punishment for the commission\n       of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable inference that the Legislature must\n       have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty now\n\n2Defendant   did not raise any due process or equal protection arguments relating to the\nretroactivity issue in his supplemental briefing.\n\n\n\n                                              6.\n\f       deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it\n       constitutionally could apply. The amendatory act imposing the lighter\n       punishment can be applied constitutionally to acts committed before its\n       passage provided the judgment convicting the defendant of the act is not\n       final. This intent seems obvious, because to hold otherwise would be to\n       conclude that the Legislature was motivated by a desire for vengeance, a\n       conclusion not permitted in view of modern theories of penology.” (In re\n       Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)\n       One may argue that under the Estrada case, unless there is a “savings clause”\nproviding for prospective application, a statute lessening punishment is presumed to\napply to all cases not yet reduced to a final judgment on the statute’s effective date. (In\nre Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at pp. 744-745, 747-748.) However, the Estrada case has\nbeen revisited by our Supreme Court on several occasions. In People v. Brown, supra, 54\nCal.4th at page 324 the court stated: “Estrada is today properly understood, not as\nweakening or modifying the default rule of prospective operation codified in [Penal\nCode] section 3, but rather as informing the rule’s application in a specific context by\narticulating the reasonable presumption that a legislative act mitigating the punishment\nfor a particular criminal offense is intended to apply to all nonfinal judgments.” “The\nholding in Estrada was founded on the premise that ‘“[a] legislative mitigation of the\npenalty for a particular crime represents a legislative judgment that the lesser penalty or\nthe different treatment is sufficient to meet the legitimate ends of the criminal law.”’”\n(Id. at p. 325.) In Brown, the court did not apply the Estrada rule because “a statute\nincreasing the rate at which prisoners may earn credits for good behavior does not\nrepresent a judgment about the needs of the criminal law with respect to a particular\ncriminal offense, and thus does not support an analogous inference of retroactive intent.”\n(People v. Brown, supra, at p. 325.)\n       Similarly here, Estrada does not control because applying the definition of\n“unreasonable risk to public safety” in Proposition 47 to petitions for resentencing under\nthe Act does not reduce punishment for a particular crime. Instead, the downward\nmodification of a sentence authorized by the Act is dependent not just on the current\n\n                                             7.\n\foffense but on any number of unlimited factors related to the individual offender,\nincluding criminal conviction history, disciplinary and rehabilitation records, and “[a]ny\nother evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding\nwhether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).)\n       Because section 1170.18(c)’s definition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety” does not apply retroactively to the Act, the sentencing court applied the correct\nstandard in exercising its discretion to not resentence defendant.3 Since defendant has\nfailed to show an abuse of that discretion, I concur in the majority’s affirmance of the\njudgment.\n\n                                                          __________________________\n                                                                             PEÑA, J.\n\n\n\n\n3Recently  in People v. Chaney (Oct. 29, 2014 C073949) __ Cal.App.4th __ the Third\nDistrict Court of Appeal held the definition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety” as provided in section 1170.18(c) does not apply retroactively. I agree.\n\n\n\n                                             8.\n\f",

(c)) or serious (as defined by § 1192.7, subd. (c)), filed a petition for\nrecall of sentence and request for resentencing under the Act. Following a hearing, the\ntrial court found defendant to be an unreasonable risk to public safety and denied the\npetition.\n       We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the petition. In\nthe unpublished portion of our opinion, we reject defendant’s claims the trial court used\nthe wrong standard, failed to properly evaluate whether defendant posed an unreasonable\nrisk to society, and had to appoint an expert to evaluate defendant regarding current\ndangerousness; and his claim the prosecution did not meet its burden of establishing\ndangerousness; his claim his sentence of 25 years to life constitutes cruel and unusual\npunishment; and his claim the errors violated his right to due process. In the published\nportion, we conclude recently enacted section 1170.18, subdivision (c) does not modify\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (f). We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\f                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       On September 13, 2009, neighbors heard an argument between defendant and his\nwife, Carrie Kobel. They were yelling and screaming and Kobel was crying.2 Kobel was\nthen seen coming down her driveway, with defendant following. Defendant pushed\nKobel, causing her to fall to the ground, then punched her multiple times. When Kobel,\nwho was screaming for help, asked witnesses to call the police, defendant told them to\nmind their own business and became aggressive and intimidating toward them. When the\npolice arrived, Kobel related she and defendant had gotten into an argument when she\nwent to move her truck into the driveway so friends coming over would have a place to\npark. Kobel’s driver’s license had been suspended due to a vehicle accident in which she\nhad been under the influence of alcohol. Defendant objected to her driving because the\ncouple had been drinking and he thought she was going to leave. Kobel told him she was\nonly moving the truck, but when she went to do so, defendant hit her in the back of the\nhead. Defendant denied there had been a fight; he said Kobel was intoxicated and\nattempting to leave, and he was only trying to stop her. Although he denied hitting\nKobel, injuries to his knuckles were inconsistent with that claim. Kobel was treated for a\nlaceration on her head that was closed with staples.\n       At trial, a woman who had been in a relationship with defendant in 2000 testified\ndefendant had assaulted her by hitting her “full force” with his fist between her temple\nand ear. She suffered a ruptured eardrum from the incident.\n       On December 2, 2009, a jury convicted defendant of felony spousal abuse\n(§ 273.5). He admitted suffering five felony convictions, two of which constituted\nstrikes. On January 6, 2010, he was sentenced to prison for 25 years to life.\n\n\n2      The facts of defendant’s commitment offense are taken from our opinion in People\nv. Valencia (Mar. 3, 2011, F059244) [nonpub. opn.], which is contained in the clerk’s\ntranscript of the present appeal.\n\n\n\n                                            3.\n\f         On May 13, 2013, defendant filed a petition to recall sentence and request for\nresentencing under section 1170.126.3 Defendant represented his strike record consisted\nof a 1995 conviction for kidnapping (§ 207, subd. (a)) and a 1996 conviction for making\na criminal threat (§ 422). Appended to the petition was a letter from defendant’s parents,\nstating their support for him and willingness to assist him in obtaining psychological help\nand drug/alcohol treatment; a letter from the Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center\nin San Francisco, stating it appeared defendant was eligible for intake; letters from the\nDelancey Street Foundation in San Francisco, thanking defendant for his interest and\nexplaining how to apply upon release, but stating acceptance could not be guaranteed;4 an\ninformational “chrono,” dated March 8, 2010, documenting defendant requested\nsegregated housing because he feared for his safety after refusing to sign a petition being\nsubmitted by other White inmates, one of whom accused him of being a coward, after\nwhich defendant was told he had to stab the person who called him a coward or he would\nbe “‘dealt with’”; and an inmate request, dated March 12, 2013, in which defendant asked\nto be placed on waiting lists for anger management and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)\nmeetings. Defendant also related he had enrolled in a mail-order anger management\ncourse. He subsequently presented a certificate, dated May 15, 2013, attesting to his\ncompletion of the “‘Grant me the Serenity Workbook” for AA, and inmate passes\nshowing he was issued a pass allowing him to attend AA meetings on April 24, May 8,\nand May 15, 2013.5\n\n\n\n\n3     The petition was originally filed on April 15, 2013. It is unclear from the record\nwhy the petition was refiled.\n4        Several of the letters were from 2009.\n5        Although the passes contained spaces for arrival and departure times, none were\nnoted.\n\n\n\n                                              4.\n\f       The People opposed the petition. They asserted that in addition to the strike\nconvictions, defendant had felony convictions for violating section 273.5 in 2000,\nsection 69 in 1996, and Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (a) in 1996, in addition\nto 12 misdemeanor convictions between 1987 and 2007. The People set out the\ncomments made by the trial court when it denied defendant’s request to dismiss one of\nhis strikes for purposes of sentencing on his commitment offense, and argued\ncircumstances had not changed. They asserted defendant’s prior record documented his\nviolence, his continuous pattern of criminal conduct, and his failure to learn despite being\noffered treatment and rehabilitation programs. They also asserted defendant had not\nparticipated in any programs while imprisoned to address his violent tendencies.\nAccordingly, they argued he posed an unreasonable risk of danger.\n       In his reply to the opposition, defendant noted his commitment offense was not for\na serious or violent felony, so if he were sentenced now, the court would not have the\noption of sentencing him to 25 years to life; the prosecutor offered him a six-year\nsentence prior to trial; and the commitment offense involved him “wrestl[ing]” with his\nwife in an attempt to stop her from driving because she was intoxicated. Defendant\nargued the People had the burden of establishing he was an unreasonable risk to public\nsafety, and his crimes from a decade earlier were insufficient. He noted he had not had\nany further convictions while incarcerated, and asserted his prison record did not\ndemonstrate patterns of violent and predatory behavior.\n       The petition was heard August 9, 2013, before the judge who sentenced defendant\nto the third strike term.6 At the outset, the court found defendant eligible for\nresentencing, and placed the burden on the People with respect to whether resentencing\n\n\n6      We recite the evidence and argument at the hearing, and the court’s ruling, in\nsome detail due to the way defendant has excerpted minor portions — particularly of the\ncourt’s comments — as a basis for many of his claims on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                             5.\n\fdefendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Over the\nprosecutor’s objection, the trial court admitted a document showing defendant’s in-prison\nrisk classification was one, which was low.\n       The defense called witnesses at the hearing. Defendant’s mother testified she had\nnot seen defendant during his most recent prison stay until the Sunday before the hearing,\nas she was partially disabled and unable to travel, although they communicated by letter\nand sporadically by telephone. Since defendant was no longer under the influence of\nalcohol, his mother noticed his attitude was changing. He had apologized for being such\na disappointment. If defendant were released from prison, he would be able to live with\nhis parents in Sonora.\n       Defendant testified he had been in prison this last time almost four years, and he\nhad two prior prison terms.7 During his current term, he had no disciplinary actions.\nDuring his previous terms, he had one write-up for brewing alcohol. Defendant related\nthat during his current prison term, he was in AA and had been taking a mail-order course\non anger management and learning how to live a better life. Due to overcrowding, he\nwas “in reception” for 28 months, where nothing was offered. Now, however, he\nattended AA meetings once a week. The mail-order course, which he only recently\ndiscovered, involved a curriculum where the school sent information, the student\ncompleted and returned it, and the school gave a score. Defendant had done the first six\nlessons. He did not know how many were left before he received his certificate. He\nstarted both AA and the mail-order course around April 2013.\n\n\n\n7      The prison term defendant had before his current term was for felony domestic\nbattery. He pled guilty and was sentenced to four years. Defendant admitted having\nviolated probation at various times, but denied violating a protective order in his prior\ndomestic violence case. He completed a 52-week batterer’s course in conjunction with\nthat domestic violence case.\n\n\n\n                                              6.\n\f         Defendant related that since 2010, he had been housed in protective custody. He\nwas asked to stab someone and refused. He explained that the gangs run the prison, and\nif an inmate does not do what they say, he will be next. Because defendant did not want\nto be violent, he went into protective custody.\n         Prior to trial, defendant was offered a six-year sentence. He turned it down\nbecause his wife said she bumped her head when she got in the truck. Defendant did not\nremember much about the day the incident happened, but knew he stopped her from\ndrinking and driving. He did not make the right decisions, but was under the impression\nhe had some type of reduced culpability.\n         If defendant were released from prison, he planned to enter a residential program\nsuch as the Salvation Army or Delancey Street, so he could learn to change his life. Both\nwere one- or two-year programs. Defendant represented he was accepted into Delancey\nStreet earlier, and had been accepted into the Salvation Army program since he had been\nin prison.\n         Defendant apologized for what he had done and stated he had learned his lesson.\nHe professed a desire to change his life. He stated he was ready to change his life and be\nsober.\n         At the conclusion of the hearing, defense counsel argued that anyone with strike\npriors would have a history like defendant, so something more was needed to show he\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger. Counsel argued the strikes were 17 and 18\nyears old, and the felony before the commitment offense was nine years earlier. Counsel\npointed to defendant’s lack of in-prison disciplinary record, and noted that if the current\ncase occurred now, defendant’s maximum sentence would be eight years. Counsel\nargued defendant wanted to change his life and was going to go into a program. Given\nall the circumstances, he asserted, the People had not met their burden of showing\ndefendant was an unreasonable risk.\n\n\n\n                                              7.\n\f       The prosecutor argued that being a good prisoner was not the same thing as being\na safe citizen. He acknowledged that anyone in a three strikes case had a history, but in\ndefendant’s case, the nature of that history, intervening events, and conduct showed he\nwas an unreasonable risk in society. The prosecutor argued that defendant had been\ngiven “break after break” and “program after program,” but had done nothing to stop and\nin fact was continuing to be violent. The prosecutor noted that although defendant’s\nstrike convictions were some time ago, defendant continued criminal conduct in the\nintervening time, including violence against women that resulted in injury even after his\ncompletion of a 52-week batterers’ course. The prosecutor also pointed out that\ndefendant did not even start his AA or mail-order programs until a month before he filed\nhis petition.\n       This ensued:\n\n              “THE COURT: … My concern is not whether today he would be\n       facing the same charges.… I spent probably the last month almost thinking\n       about it …, because … this does kind of make me think about, did I make a\n       mistake in that sentence?\n\n              “I was well aware of Romero[8] when I sentenced him. I knew I\n       could strike a strike. I have struck prior strikes as the DA’s Office\n       knows.…\n\n               “I think that Prop. 36 was based on the idea that judges would be\n       sentencing people to prison … for like a billy club when you are a two\n       striker. They were for thefts when you were a two striker. They were for\n       drugs, possession and even transportation and maybe even possession with\n       intent to sell. All of those would have been the kind of things I think that\n       the public was looking at. It’s hard for me to think that they intended\n       somebody … who I do believe is dangerous to be out again. I can’t think\n       of a better predictor of future conduct than past conduct.\n\n             “And as [the prosecutor] points out, what you do in prison really\n       doesn’t have a whole lot to do with what you do when you’re outside there\n\n8      People v.

In this case, primarily alcohol, I\nthink. I picture the idea of his coming home and living on Stewart Street\nand there are bars within a block.

What did you do that time?\n\n       “THE DEFENDANT: Stole a bottle —\n\n       “THE COURT: But you did a program for alcohol?\n\n       “THE DEFENDANT: Yeah.\n\n       “THE COURT: How long of a program?\n\n       “THE DEFENDANT: I don’t know.

I think he is a\ndanger to public safety. And as I said during the sentencing, he had nine\ngrants of probation and was on probation when this happened. It was for\nsomething fairly minor.… [¶] … [¶] … But this was serious injuries to a\nvictim and unprovoked. I just thought unprovoked.

This is not right.”\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Defendant says the trial court erred by denying his petition because (1) the court\nused the wrong standard, (2) the court failed to properly evaluate whether defendant\nposed an unreasonable risk to society, (3) the prosecution failed to meet its burden of\nestablishing dangerousness by a preponderance of the evidence, (4) the prosecution failed\nto meet its burden of establishing some evidence that defendant currently posed an\nunreasonable risk, and (5) the court should have sua sponte appointed an expert to\nevaluate defendant with respect to current dangerousness. Defendant further contends a\nsentence of 25 years to life constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the\nEighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and that the various errors violated\nhis due process rights. Finally, defendant contends the definition of “unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety” contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) applies to\nresentencing proceedings under the Act. We reject his arguments.\n                                              I*\n              The trial court did not err by denying defendant’s petition.\n       In order to be eligible for resentencing as a second strike offender under the Act,\nthe inmate petitioner must satisfy the three criteria set out in subdivision (e) of\nsection 1170.126.9 (People v. Superior Court (Martinez) (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

If the inmate satisfies all these criteria, as did defendant, he or she “shall be\nresentenced [as a second strike offender] unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (§ 1170.126, subd.

In exercising this discretion, “the court may consider:\n[¶] (1) The [inmate’s] criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes\ncommitted, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and\nthe remoteness of the crimes; [¶] (2) The [inmate’s] disciplinary record and record of\nrehabilitation while incarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its\ndiscretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (Id., subd.

Instead, taking into account the language of subdivisions (f)\nand (g) of section 1170.126, we conclude it means the People have the burden of\nestablishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts from which a determination\nresentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\ncan reasonably be made.12 Stated another way, evidence showing a petitioner poses a\n\n\n10     We have previously discussed Kaulick in the context of the initial determination\nwhether an inmate is eligible for resentencing under the Act.

We deal here with a different aspect of the retrospective\nportion of the Act and a subject not before us in our prior cases.\n11      The substantial evidence test applies to an appellate court’s review of findings\nmade under the preponderance of the evidence standard. (People v. Wong (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2305872\"><a href=\"/opinion/2305872/people-v-wong/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Under that test, the appellate court reviews the record in the\nlight most favorable to the challenged finding, to determine whether it discloses evidence\nthat is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could\nmake the finding by a preponderance of the evidence. The appellate court “resolve[s] all\nconflicts in the evidence and questions of credibility in favor of the [finding], and …\nindulge[s] every reasonable inference the [trier of fact] could draw from the evidence.\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n12     Courts and parties have assumed whatever burden exists is on the People. (E.g.,\nPeople v. Flores (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The reasons a trial court finds resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger, or its weighing of evidence showing dangerousness versus evidence showing\nrehabilitation, lie within the court’s discretion. The ultimate determination that\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger is a discretionary one. While the\ndetermination must be supported by record evidence established by a preponderance, the\ntrial court need not itself find an unreasonable risk of danger by a preponderance of the\nevidence. (See In re Robert L., supra, 21 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1065-1067 [discussing\nabuse of discretion and preponderance of the evidence standards].)\n       Such an interpretation is consistent with California’s noncapital sentencing\nscheme.13 Under the determinate sentencing law (DSL) as it existed prior to\nCunningham v.

Trial courts had “broad discretion” to impose the lower or\nupper term instead of the middle term of imprisonment (People v.

It stands to reason someone must produce that evidence. Under Evidence\nCode section 115, “‘[b]urden of proof’ means the obligation of a party to establish by\nevidence a requisite degree of belief concerning a fact in the mind of the trier of fact or\nthe court.… [¶] Except as otherwise provided by law, the burden of proof requires proof\nby a preponderance of the evidence.”\n\n\n\n\n14      After Cunningham concluded the DSL violated a defendant’s Sixth Amendment\nright to a jury trial (Cunningham, supra, 549 U.S. at p. 281), the Legislature amended\nsection 1170 so that now “(1) the middle term is no longer the presumptive term absent\naggravating or mitigating facts found by the trial judge; and (2) a trial judge has the\ndiscretion to impose an upper, middle or lower term based on reasons he or she states.”\n(People v. Wilson (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2252947\"><a href=\"/opinion/2252947/people-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Subdivision (b) of section 1170\nstates the court “shall select the term which, in the court’s discretion, best serves the\ninterests of justice.”\n\n\n\n                                                15.\n\f       However, the trial court’s ultimate determination when considering a petition for\nresentencing under section 1170.126 — whether resentencing the petitioner would pose\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety — is analogous to an evaluation of the\nrelative weight of mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Such an evaluation “is not\nequivalent to a factual finding.” (People v. Black, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 814, fn. 4.) It\nfollows, then, that the trial court need not apply a preponderance of the evidence\nstandard, in that it need not find resentencing the petitioner would, more likely than not,\npose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (See Kaulick, supra, 215\nCal.App.4th at p. 1305, fn. 28 [preponderance standard means “‘more likely than not’”].)\n       Kaulick found the prosecution bears the burden of establishing “dangerousness”\nby a preponderance of the evidence against a claim the Apprendi line of cases requires\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1302.)\nAs a result, it had no real occasion to address the interplay between the burden of proof\nand the trial court’s exercise of discretion as that issue is presented here, or to clarify\nwhether the prosecution is required to establish “dangerousness” in the sense of facts\nupon which the trial court may base the ultimate determination resentencing a petitioner\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, or in the sense of establishing\nthat determination itself. Nevertheless, we believe it supports our interpretation. Kaulick\nstated, in part: “The maximum sentence to which Kaulick, and those similarly situated to\nhim, is subject was, and shall always be, the indeterminate life term to which he was\noriginally sentenced. While [the Act] presents him with an opportunity to be resentenced\nto a lesser term, unless certain facts are established, he is nonetheless still subject to the\nthird strike sentence based on the facts established at the time he was originally\nsentenced. As such, a court’s discretionary decision to decline to modify the sentence in\nhis favor can be based on any otherwise appropriate factor (i.e., dangerousness), and\nsuch factor need not be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.” (Id.\nat p. 1303, italics added.) The court further stated: “[I]t is the general rule in California\n\n                                              16.\n\fthat once a defendant is eligible for an increased penalty, the trial court, in exercising its\ndiscretion to impose that penalty, may rely on factors established by a preponderance of\nthe evidence. [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 1305, italics added.)\n          Finally, Kaulick rejected the suggestion a trial court could determine resentencing\na petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, yet still have the\ndiscretion to resentence that petitioner to a second strike term. (Kaulick, supra, 215\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1293-1294, fn. 12.) The court explained: “The language of …\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (f), states that the petitioner shall be resentenced unless the\ncourt finds an unreasonable risk of danger. It does not state that if the court finds an\nunreasonable risk of danger, it can nonetheless resentence the petitioner. In any event,\nthe ballot arguments in support of Proposition 36 emphasized that the Act would not\nbenefit ‘“truly dangerous criminals.”’ [Citation.] It is impossible to believe that the\nvoters intended to allow a court the discretion to resentence defendants whose\nresentencing that court had already found would present an unreasonable risk of danger.”\n(Ibid.)\n          We concur with Kaulick’s rejection of the argument. Nevertheless, it seems to us\nthat if the prosecution had the burden of proving the ultimate issue in a resentencing\nproceeding, a trial court necessarily would be divested of its discretion to resentence in\nany case in which that burden of proof was met. Yet the language of section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f) expressly provides the petitioner shall be resentenced unless the court, in\nits discretion, makes a determination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk\nof danger. The statute does not say the petitioner shall be resentenced unless the People\nprove resentencing would pose such a risk.\n          To summarize, a trial court need not determine, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that resentencing a petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety before it can properly deny a petition for resentencing under the Act. Nor is\nthe court’s ultimate determination subject to substantial evidence review. Rather, its\n\n                                               17.\n\ffinding will be upheld if it does not constitute an abuse of discretion, i.e., if it falls within\n“the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances being considered.

The facts or evidence upon which the court’s\nfinding of unreasonable risk is based must be proven by the People by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, however, and are themselves subject to our review for substantial\nevidence.15 If a factor (for example, that the petitioner recently committed a battery, is\nviolent due to repeated instances of mutual combat, etc.) is not established by a\npreponderance of the evidence, it cannot form the basis for a finding of unreasonable risk.\n(See People v.

Nor\ndo we agree with defendant’s assertion the court failed to properly evaluate whether\ndefendant posed an unreasonable risk to public safety by basing its finding solely on\ninformation it had at the time of the original sentencing. Evidence concerning the factors\nset out in subdivision (g) of section 1170.126, including defendant’s lack of in-prison\ndisciplinary record, his low-risk assessment score, and his attendance of AA meetings\nand participation in a mail-order anger management class, was all before the court (as\nwas the fact defendant only started participating in AA and the mail-order class about one\nmonth before he filed his resentencing petition). That the trial court may not have\nexpressly mentioned some of these factors does not mean it failed to consider them and,\nin the absence of any showing to the contrary, we presume it did so. (Evid. Code, § 664;\nsee Denham v.

Defendant’s true argument is that the court did not credit\nthem in the manner and to the extent defendant thinks is appropriate. We find the court\nacted well within its discretion, however, and — again contrary to defendant’s claim —\nmade its finding based on its view of defendant’s current risk to society, a view that was\nsupported by record evidence.\n       Defendant says the prosecution failed to meet its burden of establishing\ndangerousness by a preponderance of the evidence. He apparently bases this on the fact\nhe presented witnesses while the People did not. The prosecutor adduced evidence\nthrough his cross-examination of defendant and defendant’s mother, however, and was\nentitled to rely on information (such as defendant’s criminal history, the circumstances of\nthe commitment offense, and defendant’s presently belated and previously unsuccessful\n\n                                            19.\n\frehabilitation efforts) that was already before the trial court and established at least by a\npreponderance.16 We have explained the applicable burden and standard of proof, ante.\nThe evidence before the court was sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to conclude\nresentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, as\nrequired by section 1170.126, subdivision (f).\n       Apparently analogizing a resentencing proceeding under the Act to a parole\nproceeding for an inmate serving a life term (see § 3041; In re Lawrence (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1223-1224), defendant chides the court for failing to appoint, sua sponte,\nan expert to evaluate defendant with respect to current dangerousness and his\npsychological or mental attitude.

Whatever\nthe similarities between the decisions whether to resentence under the Act and to grant\nparole to an inmate serving a life term, appointment of an expert did not fall outside the\nbounds of reason in this case. The question before the court was whether resentencing\ndefendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Given the\ninformation already before the court, the court could make the required determination\nitself, without the input of an expert. As has been stated in the context of a claim the\nword “unreasonable” is impermissibly vague, “Surely a superior court judge is capable of\nexercising discretion, justly applying the public safety exception, and determining\nwhether a lesser sentence would pose an unreasonable risk of harm to the public safety.\n[Citation.]” (People v.

It is not the current charge that qualifies defendant for this term, but rather his\nhistory as a repeat offender. “[H]abitual offender statutes have long withstood the\nconstitutional claim of cruel or unusual punishment. [Citations.]” (Ingram, at p. 1413.)\nDefendant has proven he holds little regard for the law and is immune to resultant\npunishments for his conduct. In this instance, “it becomes the duty of government to\nseek some other method to curb his criminal propensities that he might not continue to\nfurther inflict himself upon law-abiding members of society. This, we think, may be\ndone even to the extent of depriving him permanently of his liberty.…” (In re\nRosencrantz (1928) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3303793\"><a href=\"/opinion/3304343/in-re-rosencrantz/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 539.)\n       Defendant appears to base his claim on the premise that because now an offender\nin his position would be sentenced to no more than eight years for violating\nsection 273.5, defendant’s sentence is unconstitutionally disproportionate. He says:\n\n\nSupreme Court rejected the Governor’s conclusion, stating: “[T]he passage of time is\nhighly probative to the determination before us, and reliance upon outdated psychological\nreports — clearly contradicted by [the inmate’s] successful participation in years of\nintensive therapy, a long series of reports declaring [the inmate] to be free of\npsychological problems and no longer a threat to public safety, and [the inmate’s] own\ninsight into her participation in this crime — does not supply some evidence justifying\nthe Governor’s conclusion that [the inmate] continues to pose a threat to public safety.”\n(Id. at p. 1224.)\n\n\n\n                                              22.\n\f“The sentence imposed for a violation of … section 273.5 for any other defendant in any\njurisdiction in California is not the same as [defendant’s] sentence. [Defendant] was\nsentenced to an indeterminate sentence while any other defendant would be sentenced to\nno more than eight years.”\n       Defendant’s premise is faulty. Any third strike offender convicted of violating\nsection 273.5 before the Act amended sections 667 and 1170.12 is serving a sentence of\nat least 25 years to life, like defendant, unless he or she has been determined not to pose\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Defendant cites no authority for the\nproposition that a subsequent downward modification in a statutorily prescribed sentence\nrenders unconstitutional a punishment that was constitutional when imposed. (See, e.g.,\nEwing v. California (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127897\"><a href=\"/opinion/127897/ewing-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 28-31 (lead opn. of O’Connor, J.) [three strikes\nsentence of 25 years to life not unconstitutionally disproportionate where current offense\nwas grand theft].)\n       Last, defendant contends the various errors committed by the trial court in the\nsection 1170.126 proceeding and the disproportionality of his sentence violated his due\nprocess rights. He says the section 1170.126 hearing was fundamentally unfair because\nof the trial court’s errors and because the hearing was defendant’s “only shot at\nresentencing.”\n       We have rejected all defendant’s claims of error and cruel and unusual\npunishment. To the extent defendant may be arguing section 1170.126, subdivision (b)\nviolates due process because it limits a defendant to the filing of a single petition and\nrequires that, unless good cause is shown, the petition must be filed within two years after\nthe effective date of the Act, we find no fundamental unfairness. We reach the same\nconclusion if we interpret defendant’s argument as a claim that, because of the two-year\nlimit, he was unfairly deprived of the opportunity to demonstrate a lengthy period of\nnonviolence that would have allayed the trial court’s concerns. The ability to seek\nresentencing “is not constitutionally required, but an act of lenity on the part of the\n\n                                             23.\n\felectorate.” (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1304.)20 There was no due process\nviolation.\n                                              II\n         Section 1170.18, subdivision (c), enacted pursuant to Proposition 47,\n                  does not modify section 1170.126, subdivision (f).\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, “the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act” (hereafter Proposition 47). It went into effect the next day. (Cal.\nConst., art. II, § 10, subd. (a).) Insofar as is pertinent here, Proposition 47 renders\nmisdemeanors certain drug- and theft-related offenses that previously were felonies or\n“wobblers,” unless they were committed by certain ineligible defendants. Proposition 47\nalso created a new resentencing provision — section 1170.18 — by which a person\ncurrently serving a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor, may\npetition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the\noffense statutes as added or amended by Proposition 47. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).) A\nperson who satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a) of section 1170.18 shall have his or her\nsentence recalled and be “resentenced to a misdemeanor … unless the court, in its\n\n\n\n\n20      We express no opinion whether an inmate could bring more than one petition, or\nfile a petition and then seek a lengthy continuance in order to establish a prolonged\nperiod of rehabilitation, or whether the desire to establish such a period would constitute\ngood cause for filing a petition beyond the two-year period. The record established\nprevious attempts to rehabilitate defendant (through, for example, a 52-week batterers’\ncourse) were woefully unsuccessful. The evidence further suggested his current belated\nefforts were undertaken not for purposes of true rehabilitation, but with a view toward\nconvincing the court to resentence him. Moreover, his crimes were not particularly\nremote and his most recent offense involved violence his record amply demonstrated was\nnot an instance of aberrant behavior.\n\n\n\n                                              24.\n\fdiscretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (b).)21\n       Hidden in the lengthy, fairly abstruse text of the proposed law, as presented in the\nofficial ballot pamphlet — and nowhere called to voters’ attention — is the provision at\nissue in the present appeal. Subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 provides: “As used\nthroughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\nof clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\nSection 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) lists the following felonies, sometimes called\n“super strike” offenses:\n\n              “(I) A ‘sexually violent offense’ as defined in subdivision (b) of\n       Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n              “(II) Oral copulation with a child who is under 14 years of age, and\n       who is more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section\n       288a, sodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more\n       than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 286, or sexual\n       penetration with another person who is under 14 years of age, and who is\n       more than 10 years younger than he or she, as defined by Section 289.\n\n              “(III) A lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of\n       age, in violation of Section 288.\n\n              “(IV) Any homicide offense, including any attempted homicide\n       offense, defined in Sections 187 to 191.5, inclusive.\n\n              “(V) Solicitation to commit murder as defined in Section 653f.\n\n              “(VI) Assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, as\n       defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 245.\n\n\n\n21    Proposition 47 also created a process whereby eligible persons who have already\ncompleted their sentences may have the particular conviction or convictions designated\nas misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18, subds. (f), (g).)\n\n\n\n                                                25.\n\f             “(VII) Possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as defined in\n       paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 11418.\n\n              “(VIII) Any serious and/or violent felony offense punishable in\n       California by life imprisonment or death.”\n       The question is whether section 1170.18, subdivision (c) now limits a trial court’s\ndiscretion to deny resentencing under the Act to those cases in which resentencing the\ndefendant would pose an unreasonable risk he or she will commit a new “super strike”\noffense. Defendant says it does. The People disagree. We agree with the People.22\n\n\n22     We solicited supplemental briefing concerning Proposition 47. Among the\nquestions we asked counsel to answer were whether defendant met the criteria for\nresentencing under section 1170.18 and, if so, whether we needed to determine the\napplicability, if any, of section 1170.18, subdivision (c) to resentencing proceedings\nunder section 1170.126. We are satisfied it is appropriate for us to reach the issue of\napplicability regardless of whether defendant might obtain resentencing under\nProposition 47.\n        It appears that a number of inmates will be eligible to seek resentencing under\nboth the Act and Proposition 47. Such an inmate need not wait to file a petition under\nProposition 47 until the trial court’s ruling on the inmate’s petition under the Act is final.\nA trial court is not divested of jurisdiction over a Proposition 47 petition by the fact a\npetition under the Act is pending, whether in a trial court or a Court of Appeal, with\nrespect to the same inmate.

Disibio (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1,\n5).\n       As is evidenced by its title, the Act was aimed solely at revising the three strikes\nlaw. That law, as originally enacted by the Legislature, was described by us as follows:\n\n               “Under the three strikes law, defendants are punished not just for\n       their current offense but for their recidivism. Recidivism in the\n       commission of multiple felonies poses a danger to society justifying the\n       imposition of longer sentences for subsequent offenses. [Citation.] The\n       primary goals of recidivist statutes are: ‘… to deter repeat offenders and, at\n       some point in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses\n       serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the\n       rest of society for an extended period of time. This segregation and its\n       duration are based not merely on that person’s most recent offense but also\n       on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which\n       he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. Like the line\n       dividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will\n       be deemed to have demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount\n       of time that the recidivist will be isolated from society are matters largely\n       within the discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.’ [Citation.]\n\n\n\n                                             29.\n\f               “By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature acknowledged the\n       will of Californians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and\n       incapacitation be given precedence in determining the appropriate\n       punishment for crimes. Further, those goals were best achieved by\n       ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater punishment’ for second and\n       third ‘strikers.’” (People v. Cooper (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2247818\"><a href=\"/opinion/2247818/people-v-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

This is so even when the\ncurrent, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely perceived as\nrelatively minor. [Citations.]” (In re Coley (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 528-529.)\n       Clearly, by approving the Act, voters resolved this controversy in favor of strike\noffenders. Thus, one of the “Findings and Declarations” of the Act stated the Act would\n“[r]estore the Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life\nsentences only when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.”\n(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of proposed law, § 1, p. 105.)\nNowhere, however, do the ballot materials for the Act suggest voters intended essentially\nto open the prison doors to existing third strike offenders in all but the most egregious\ncases, as would be the result if the definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\n\n23      The foregoing applies equally to the three strikes initiative measure that added\nsection 1170.12 to the Penal Code. The following statement of intent preceded the text of\nthe statute in Proposition 184, which was approved by voters on November 8, 1994: “‘It\nis the intent of the People of the State of California in enacting this measure to ensure\nlonger prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have\nbeen previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.’” (See Historical\nand Statutory Notes, 50C West’s Ann. Pen. Code (2004 ed.) foll. § 1170.12, p. 239.)\n\n\n\n                                            30.\n\fsafety’” contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) were engrafted onto resentencing\nproceedings under section 1170.126, subdivision (f). That voters did not intend such a\nresult is amply demonstrated by the fact an indeterminate life term remains mandatory\nunder the Act for a wide range of current offenses even if the offender does not have a\nprior conviction for a “super strike” offense (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)),\nand that an inmate is rendered ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 for an\narray of reasons beyond his or her having suffered such a prior conviction (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (e)(2)).\n       The Act clearly placed public safety above the cost savings likely to accrue as a\nresult of its enactment. Thus, uncodified section 7 of the Act provides: “This act is an\nexercise of the public power of the people of the State of California for the protection of\nthe health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of California, and shall be\nliberally construed to effectuate those purposes.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 6, 2012), supra, text of proposed law, p. 110, original italics omitted, italics\nadded.) As we explained in People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1036,\n“Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat [citation], ‘[e]nhancing public\nsafety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].”\n       In contrast, Proposition 47 — while titled “the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools\nAct” — emphasized monetary savings. The “Findings and Declarations” state: “The\npeople of the State of California find and declare as follows: [¶] The people enact the\nSafe Neighborhoods and Schools Act to ensure that prison spending is focused on violent\nand serious offenses, to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime, and to\ninvest the savings generated from this act into prevention and support programs in K-12\nschools, victim services, and mental health and drug treatment. This act ensures that\nsentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes like rape, murder, and child\nmolestation are not changed.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text\nof proposed law, § 2, p. 70.) Uncodified section 15 of the measure provides: “This act\n\n                                             31.\n\fshall be broadly construed to accomplish its purposes,” while uncodified section 18\nstates: “This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, text of proposed law, p. 74.)\nProposition 47 requires misdemeanor sentences for various drug possession and property\noffenses, unless the perpetrator has a prior conviction for a “super strike” offense or for\nan offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c).\n(Health & Saf. Code, §§ 11350, subd. (a), 11357, subd. (a), 11377, subd. (a); §§ 459.5,\nsubd. (a), 473, subd. (b), 476a, subd. (b), 490.2, subd. (a), 496, subd. (a), 666, subd. (b).)\nSection 1170.18 renders ineligible for resentencing only those inmates whose current\noffense would now be a misdemeanor, but who have a prior conviction for a “super\nstrike” offense or for an offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to\nsection 290, subdivision (c). (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (i).)\n       Nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47 were voters given any\nindication that initiative, which dealt with offenders whose current convictions would\nnow be misdemeanors rather than felonies, had any impact on the Act, which dealt with\noffenders whose current convictions would still be felonies, albeit not third strikes. For\ninstance, the Official Title and Summary stated, in pertinent part, that Proposition 47\nwould “[r]equire[] resentencing for persons serving felony sentences for these offenses[,\ni.e., offenses that require misdemeanor sentences under the measure] unless court finds\nunreasonable public safety risk.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014),\nsupra, official title and summary, p. 34.) In explaining what Proposition 47 would do,\nthe Legislative Analyst stated: “This measure reduces penalties for certain offenders\nconvicted of nonserious and nonviolent property and drug crimes. This measure also\nallows certain offenders who have been previously convicted of such crimes to apply for\nreduced sentences.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra,\nanalysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 35, italics added.) With respect to the\nresentencing provision, the Legislative Analyst explained:\n\n                                              32.\n\f               “This measure allows offenders currently serving felony sentences\n       for the above crimes[, i.e., grand theft, shoplifting, receiving stolen\n       property, writing bad checks, check forgery, and drug possession] to apply\n       to have their felony sentences reduced to misdemeanor sentences. In\n       addition, certain offenders who have already completed a sentence for a\n       felony that the measure changes could apply to the court to have their\n       felony conviction changed to a misdemeanor. However, no offender who\n       has committed a specified severe crime could be resentenced or have their\n       conviction changed. In addition, the measure states that a court is not\n       required to resentence an offender currently serving a felony sentence if the\n       court finds it likely that the offender will commit a specified severe crime.\n       Offenders who are resentenced would be required to be on state parole for\n       one year, unless the judge chooses to remove that requirement.” (Id. at\n       p. 36, italics added.)\n       Similarly, the arguments in favor of and against Proposition 47 spoke in terms\nsolely of Proposition 47, and never mentioned the Act. The Argument in Favor of\nProposition 47 spoke in terms of prioritizing serious and violent crime so as to stop\nwasting prison space “on petty crimes,” stop “wasting money on warehousing people in\nprisons for nonviolent petty crimes,” and stop California’s overcrowded prisons from\n“incarcerating too many people convicted of low-level, nonviolent offenses.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument in favor of Prop. 47,\np. 38.) The Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 47 reiterated these themes, and\nnever suggested Proposition 47 would have any effect on resentencing under the Act.\n(See Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.) Although the Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 47\nasserted 10,000 inmates would be eligible for early release under the measure, and that\nmany of them had prior convictions “for serious crimes, such as assault, robbery and\nhome burglary” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to\nargument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38), there is no suggestion the early release provisions\nwould extend to inmates whose current offenses remained felonies under the Act. The\nsame is true of the discussion of resentencing contained in the Argument Against\n\n\n\n\n                                            33.\n\fProposition 47. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.)\n       In light of the foregoing, we cannot reasonably conclude voters intended the\ndefinition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) to apply to that phrase as it appears in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), despite the former section’s preamble, “As used throughout this\nCode .…” Voters cannot intend something of which they are unaware.\n       We are cognizant one of the Act’s authors has taken the position Proposition 47’s\ndefinition of “unreasonable risk of danger” applies to resentencing proceedings under the\nAct. (St. John & Gerber, Prop. 47 Jolts Landscape of California Justice System (Nov. 5,\n2014) Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-ff-pol-\nproposition47-20141106-story.html> [as of Dec. 16, 2014].) Looking at the information\nconveyed to voters, however, this clearly was not their intent and so an author’s desire is\nof no import. (Cf. People v.

Thus, we presume voters were aware\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), had been judicially construed as not being impermissibly vague, but as\nnevertheless having no fixed definition.

Voters are not\nasked or presumed to be able to discern all potential effects of a proposed initiative\nmeasure; this is why they are provided with voter information guides containing not only\nthe actual text of such a measure, but also a neutral explanation and analysis by the\nLegislative Analyst and arguments in support of and in opposition to the measure. As we\nhave already observed, none of those materials so much as hinted that Proposition 47\ncould have the slightest effect on resentencing under the Act. (Cf. Marshall v. Pasadena\nUnified School Dist., supra, 119 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1255-1256 [legislative history of\nenactment included information bill would add definition of particular term to Public\nContract Code].)24\n       We are asked to infer an intent to extend section 1170.18, subdivision (c)’s\ndefinition to proceedings under section 1170.126 because the phrase in question only\nappears in those sections of the Penal Code. We cannot do so. The only resentencing\nmentioned in the Proposition 47 ballot materials was resentencing for inmates whose\ncurrent offenses would be reduced to misdemeanors, not those who would still warrant\nsecond strike felony terms. There is a huge difference, both legally and in public safety\nrisked, between someone with multiple prior serious and/or violent felony convictions\nwhose current offense is (or would be, if committed today) a misdemeanor, and someone\nwhose current offense is a felony. Accordingly, treating the two groups differently for\nresentencing purposes does not lead to absurd results, but rather is eminently logical.\n\n24     For the same reasons, we reject any suggestion the definition contained in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) was intended to clarify the true meaning of\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f).

Allowing trial courts broad discretion to\ndetermine whether resentencing an eligible petitioner under the Act “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)) clearly furthers the\nAct’s purpose. Whatever the wisdom of Proposition 47’s policy of near-universal\nresentencing where misdemeanants are concerned — and “[i]t is not for us to gainsay the\nwisdom of this legislative choice” (Bernard v.

We believe, however, that\na finding of nonretroactivity inexorably leads to the possibility of prospective-only\napplication, and that prospective-only application of Proposition 47’s definition to\nresentencing petitions under the Act would raise serious, perhaps insurmountable, equal\nprotection issues. “Mindful of the serious constitutional questions that might arise were\nwe to accept a literal construction of the statutory language, and of our obligation\nwherever possible both to carry out the intent of the electorate and to construe statutes so\nas to preserve their constitutionality [citations]” (People v.

I\nagree defendant may not take advantage of Proposition 47’s1 newly enacted definition of\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as provided in Penal Code section\n1170.18, subdivision (c) (1170.18(c)). I do so not because there is any ambiguity in the\nlanguage used in section 1170.18(c) or the notion that the statute does not mean what it\nsays, i.e., that the new definition applies “throughout this Code.” Rather, in my view,\nthere is no indication the electorate, in enacting section 1170.18(c), intended it to apply\nretroactively to resentencing determinations under Proposition 36, the Three Strikes\nReform Act of 2012 (the Act).\nI.     After November 4, 2014, the definition of “unreasonable risk of danger” in\n       Section 1170.18(c) applies throughout the Penal Code\n       Section 1170.18(c) provides: “As used throughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a\nnew violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph\n(2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\n       This section and subdivision were enacted on November 4, 2014, when California\nvoters passed Proposition 47, long past the time of defendant’s resentencing hearing.\nUnless the legislation was designed or intended to apply retroactively, the definition in\nsection 1170.18(c) cannot apply to defendant. This is the only inquiry we must make to\nresolve the issue of whether the definition in section 1170.18(c) applies to defendant.\nHowever, the majority has opted to determine whether the new definition applies to any\nresentencing provisions under the Act, past, present, or future. I respectfully disagree\nwith the majority’s analysis and conclusion on this broader issue.\n\n\n1The Safe Neighborhood and Schools Act (Prop. 47, as approved by voters, Gen.

The definition of ‘duress’ in\n       both the rape and spousal rape statutes begins with the phrase, ‘As used in\n       this section, “duress” means ….’ (§§ 261, subd. (b), 262, subd. (c).) This\n       clear language belies any legislative intent to apply the definitions of\n       ‘duress’ in the rape and spousal rape statutes to any other sexual offenses.\n\n              “Starting from the premise that in 1990 the Legislature incorporated\n       into the rape statute a definition of ‘duress’ that already was in use for other\n       sexual offenses, defendant argues that the Legislature must have intended\n       its 1993 amendment of the definition of ‘duress’ in the rape statute, and the\n       incorporation of this new definition into the spousal rape statute, to apply as\n       well to other sexual offenses that use the term ‘duress.’ Defendant\n       observes: ‘The legislative history does not suggest any rationale for why\n       the Legislature would want its 1993 amendment of the definition of\n       “duress” to apply only to rape so that it would have one meaning when the\n       rape statutes use the phrase “force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of\n       immediate and unlawful bodily injury” but another, much more expansive\n       meaning when the identical phrase is used in the statutes defining sodomy,\n       lewd acts on a child, oral copulation and foreign object rape.’\n\n               “But the Legislature was not required to set forth its reasons for\n       providing a different definition of ‘duress’ for rape and spousal rape than\n       has been used in other sexual offenses; it is clear that it did so. ‘When\n       “‘statutory language is … clear and unambiguous there is no need for\n       construction, and courts should not indulge in it.’” [Citations.] The plain\n       meaning of words in a statute may be disregarded only when that meaning\n       is “‘repugnant to the general purview of the act,’ or for some other\n       compelling reason ….” [Citations.]’ [Citation.] As we said in an\n       analogous situation: ‘It is our task to construe, not to amend, the statute.\n       “In the construction of a statute … the office of the judge is simply to\n       ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not\n       to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted ….”\n       [Citation.] We may not, under the guise of construction, rewrite the law or\n       give the words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the\n       terms used.’ [Citation.]”\n       The majority pays lip service to the plain meaning rule and then ignores it. While\nacknowledging the language used is unambiguous, it nonetheless engages in statutory\nconstruction to determine whether the electorate really intended to say what it actually\nenacted. The end result is a rewriting of the statute so that it comports with the majority’s\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fview of what the voters really intended. The majority has rewritten section 1170.18(c) so\nthat it now states: “As used in this section only, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’ means ….” The majority does so without providing a compelling reason to do so\nand without showing the plain language used has a “‘meaning [that] is “‘repugnant to the\ngeneral purview of the act.’”’” (People v. Leal, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 1008.) Because\nthe Act had not previously defined the phrase “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety,” the definition in section 1170.18(c) cannot be repugnant or contradictory to the\nAct, nor does the majority claim the definition is repugnant to the general purview of\nProposition 47. For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with the majority on this part of\nthe opinion.\nII.    Section 1170.18(c) has no application to defendant’s resentencing under the\n       Act\n       I do concur in the result because there is nothing in Proposition 47 to indicate the\ndefinition enacted under section 1170.18(c) is to be applied retroactively to defendant\nunder the Act.\n       I begin my analysis with section 3 of the Penal Code, which provides that “[n]o\npart of it is retroactive, unless expressly so declared.” “Whether a statute operates\nprospectively or retroactively is, at least in the first instance, a matter of legislative intent.\nWhen the Legislature has not made its intent on the matter clear,” section 3 provides the\ndefault rule.

Proposition 47 is silent on\nthe question of whether it applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act. The\nanalysis of Proposition 47 by the legislative analyst and the arguments for and against\nProposition 47 are also silent on this question. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014) pp. 34-39.) Because the statute contains no express declaration that\nsection 1170.18(c) applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act, and there is no\nclearly implied intent of retroactivity in the legislative history, the default rule applies.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4.\n\f       Defendant relies on People v.

Although the Legislature failed to provide for retroactive application, the Sandoval\ncourt decided it was responsible for fashioning “a constitutional procedure for\nresentencing in cases in which Cunningham requires a reversal of an upper term\nsentence.” (People v.

The court explained:\n\n              “If we assume that the new legislation does not apply directly to\n       cases pending on appeal that are remanded for resentencing, our task in\n       deciding the appropriate sentencing procedure to be applied by a trial court\n       on remand is somewhat analogous to what we faced in In re Hawthorne\n       [(2005)] </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2581548\"><a href=\"/opinion/2581548/in-re-hawthorne/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

(See In re Hawthorne, supra, 35\n       Cal.4th at p. 44.) The legislation, however, did not provide for cases in\n       which the death penalty already had been imposed. (In re Hawthorne,\n       supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 45.) In such a situation, ‘[t]he task thus falls to this\n       court to formulate appropriate procedures for resolving postconviction\n       claims.’ (Ibid.)\n\n               “In Hawthorne, we adopted procedures for postconviction claims\n       that tracked the statute ‘as closely as logic and practicality permit,’ in order\n       ‘to maintain consistency with our own [state’s] legislation … and to avoid\n       due process and equal protection implications.’ (In re Hawthorne, supra,\n       35 Cal.4th at p. 47.) Likewise, in the present case, we direct that\n       sentencing proceedings to be held in cases that are remanded because the\n       sentence imposed was determined to be erroneous under Cunningham,\n       supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145761\"><a href=\"/opinion/145761/cunningham-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, are to be conducted in a manner consistent with the\n       amendments to the [determinate sentencing law] adopted by the\n       Legislature.” (People v. Sandoval, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 846.)\n       In this case, there is no constitutional violation in the manner the trial court\nconducted its sentencing determination. Thus, there is no occasion to remand this case,\nand we instead affirm the trial court’s determination. Defendant has identified no due\nprocess or equal protection concerns that might invalidate Proposition 47 or the Act if he\nis denied retroactive application.2 I perceive none.\n       Although defendant has not relied upon In re Estrada (1965) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1421177\"><a href=\"/opinion/1421177/in-re-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> to\nargue retroactive application, the People have cited it as distinguishable from this case. I\ndiscuss the Estrada case out of an abundance of caution.\n       In Estrada, the court stated:\n\n       “When the Legislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment it\n       has obviously expressly determined that its former penalty was too severe\n       and that a lighter punishment is proper as punishment for the commission\n       of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable inference that the Legislature must\n       have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty now\n\n2Defendant   did not raise any due process or equal protection arguments relating to the\nretroactivity issue in his supplemental briefing.\n\n\n\n                                              6.\n\f       deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it\n       constitutionally could apply. The amendatory act imposing the lighter\n       punishment can be applied constitutionally to acts committed before its\n       passage provided the judgment convicting the defendant of the act is not\n       final. This intent seems obvious, because to hold otherwise would be to\n       conclude that the Legislature was motivated by a desire for vengeance, a\n       conclusion not permitted in view of modern theories of penology.” (In re\n       Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)\n       One may argue that under the Estrada case, unless there is a “savings clause”\nproviding for prospective application, a statute lessening punishment is presumed to\napply to all cases not yet reduced to a final judgment on the statute’s effective date. (In\nre Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at pp. 744-745, 747-748.) However, the Estrada case has\nbeen revisited by our Supreme Court on several occasions. In People v. Brown, supra, 54\nCal.4th at page 324 the court stated: “Estrada is today properly understood, not as\nweakening or modifying the default rule of prospective operation codified in [Penal\nCode] section 3, but rather as informing the rule’s application in a specific context by\narticulating the reasonable presumption that a legislative act mitigating the punishment\nfor a particular criminal offense is intended to apply to all nonfinal judgments.” “The\nholding in Estrada was founded on the premise that ‘“[a] legislative mitigation of the\npenalty for a particular crime represents a legislative judgment that the lesser penalty or\nthe different treatment is sufficient to meet the legitimate ends of the criminal law.”’”\n(Id. at p. 325.) In Brown, the court did not apply the Estrada rule because “a statute\nincreasing the rate at which prisoners may earn credits for good behavior does not\nrepresent a judgment about the needs of the criminal law with respect to a particular\ncriminal offense, and thus does not support an analogous inference of retroactive intent.”\n(People v. Brown, supra, at p. 325.)\n       Similarly here, Estrada does not control because applying the definition of\n“unreasonable risk to public safety” in Proposition 47 to petitions for resentencing under\nthe Act does not reduce punishment for a particular crime. Instead, the downward\nmodification of a sentence authorized by the Act is dependent not just on the current\n\n                                             7.\n\foffense but on any number of unlimited factors related to the individual offender,\nincluding criminal conviction history, disciplinary and rehabilitation records, and “[a]ny\nother evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding\nwhether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).)\n       Because section 1170.18(c)’s definition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety” does not apply retroactively to the Act, the sentencing court applied the correct\nstandard in exercising its discretion to not resentence defendant.3 Since defendant has\nfailed to show an abuse of that discretion, I concur in the majority’s affirmance of the\njudgment.\n\n                                                          __________________________\n                                                                             PEÑA, J.\n\n\n\n\n3Recently  in People v.
