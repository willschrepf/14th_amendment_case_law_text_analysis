We reverse the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       The Honorable David R. Hansen stepped down as Chief Judge of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit at the close of business on March 31,\n2003. He has been succeeded by the Honorable James B. Loken.\n\f                                             I.\n\n      The grand jury charged Sabri with three counts of bribery in violation of 18\nU.S.C. § 666(a)(2).2 The indictment alleged the following facts. The City of\nMinneapolis (hereinafter \"City\") received approximately $28.8 million in federal\nfunds during the calendar year beginning January 1, 2001. The Minneapolis\nCommunity Development Agency (hereinafter \"MCDA\") is a City agency created to\nfund housing and economic development programs within the City. MCDA received\n\n\n      2\n          The statute provides, in relevant part, that:\n\n      (a) Whoever, if the circumstance described in subsection (b) of this\n      section exists–\n            ....\n            (2) corruptly gives, offers, or agrees to give anything of\n            value to any person, with intent to influence or reward an\n            agent of an organization or of a State, local or Indian\n            tribal government, or any agency thereof, in connection\n            with any business, transaction, or series of transactions\n            of such organization, government, or agency involving\n            anything of value of $5,000 or more;\n\n      shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or\n      both.\n\n      (b) The circumstance referred to in subsection (a) of this section is\n      that the organization, government, or agency receives, in any one year\n      period, benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal program\n      involving a grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance, or\n      other form of Federal assistance.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 666 (2000).\n                                             2\n\fapproximately $23 million in federal funds in the calendar year beginning January 1,\n2001. The Minneapolis Neighborhood Revitalization Program (hereinafter \"MNRP\")\nis an agency created by the City and other local government entities which provides\nfunding for the economic revitalization of City neighborhoods. MCDA wholly funds\nMNRP.\n\n       Sabri is a Minneapolis developer and landlord. During the spring and summer\nof 2001, Sabri was pursuing a commercial real estate project within the City's Eighth\nWard. From 1993 through July 2001, Brian Herron served on the City Council,\nrepresenting the Eighth Ward. He also served on the Board of Commissioners\noverseeing MCDA's budget. The government alleged that Sabri gave Herron $5000\nin an attempt to obtain Herron's assistance in receiving regulatory approval from the\nCity to commence the proposed real estate project; that Sabri offered Herron $10,000\nto threaten the current property owners that the City would use its powers of eminent\ndomain to take their property if they did not sell to Sabri; and that Sabri offered to\ngive Herron $80,000 as a 10% kickback in return for his assisting Sabri to obtain\n$800,000 in community economic development grants for the proposed real estate\nproject.\n\n      Sabri filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that § 666(a)(2)\nwas facially unconstitutional because it does not require the government to prove a\nnexus between the offense conduct–the offering of a bribe–and the federal funds.\nWithout such a \"jurisdictional hook,\" that is, a clause that purports to ensure that the\nlaw applies only to activity that falls within the federal lawmaking power, Sabri\nargued that the statute was outside Congress's legislative power. The district court\nagreed with Sabri's arguments and granted his motion to dismiss the indictment.3 We\n\n      3\n       To the extent that the district court, relying on United States v. Lopez, 514\nU.S. 549 (1995), concluded that § 666 contained no \"'express jurisdictional element'\nthat confer[red] federal court jurisdiction over the offenses described in § 666,\"\nUnited States v. Sabri, 183 F. Supp. 2d 1145, 1154 (D. Minn. 2002), it erred. The\n                                           3\n\fagree with the district court that as a matter of statutory construction the government\nneed not prove some nexus between the offense conduct and federal funds. We\nrespectfully disagree that the statute as construed is beyond Congress's power to\nlegislate.\n\n                                          II.\n\n       We first turn to the question of statutory construction: whether § 666 itself\nrequires that the government prove some connection between the offense conduct and\nthe expenditure or use of federal funds. We hold that § 666 contains no requirement\nthat the government prove some connection between the offense conduct and federal\nfunds beyond the express statutory requirement found in § 666(b) which requires\nproof that the relevant organization, government, or agency received benefits under\na federal program in excess of $10,000 in any one-year period.\n\n       The Supreme Court addressed this question of statutory construction in part in\nSalinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52 (1997). Salinas, a deputy sheriff who had\naccepted bribes in exchange for arranging \"contact visits\" between a federal prisoner\nhoused in the Hidalgo County jail and the prisoner's wife and girlfriend, argued that\n\"the Government must prove the bribe in some way affected federal funds, for\ninstance by diverting or misappropriating them\" before the statute was violated. Id.\nat 55. A unanimous Court rejected Salinas's argument, noting that the \"enactment's\n\n\nLopez Court's use of the word \"jurisdiction\" referred to the power of the Congress to\nenact legislation and not to the subject matter jurisdiction of the court. Lopez, 514\nU.S. at 561. The district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case because\nSabri was charged with an \"offense[] against the laws of the United States.\" 18\nU.S.C. § 3231 (2000). See, e.g., United States v. Ryan, 41 F.3d 361, 363 (8th Cir.\n1994) (en banc) (concluding that the express jurisdictional element contained in 18\nU.S.C. § 844(i) was merely an element of the offense and that \"the court [would] not\nby the failure of proof on that element [be] deprived of judicial jurisdiction\"), cert.\ndenied, 514 U.S. 1082 (1995).\n                                          4\n\fexpansive, unqualified language, both as to the bribes forbidden and the entities\ncovered, does not support the interpretation that federal funds must be affected to\nviolate\" the statute. Id. at 56-57. Specifically, the Court noted that the word \"'any,'\nwhich prefaces the business or transaction clause, undercuts the attempt to impose\nthis narrowing construction,\" id. at 57, and \"that, as a matter of statutory construction,\n§ 666(a)(1)(B) does not require the Government to prove the bribe in question had\nany particular influence on federal funds,\" id. at 61.\n\n       The only issue before the Salinas Court, however, was a narrow question of\nstatutory construction: whether \"§ 666 [is] limited to cases in which the bribe has a\ndemonstrated effect upon federal funds.\" Id. at 54 (emphasis added). The Court\nexplicitly left open the more sweeping question of whether § 666 requires the\ngovernment to demonstrate some other, less direct connection between the offense\nconduct and federal funds. Id. at 59 (\"We need not consider whether the statute\nrequires some other kind of connection between a bribe and the expenditure of federal\nfunds, for in this case the bribe was related to the housing of a prisoner in facilities\npaid for in significant part by federal funds themselves.\"); see also United States v.\nZwick, 199 F.3d 672, 679 (3d Cir. 1999) (stating that the Salinas Court resolved the\nquestion of whether the government must show that the offense conduct actually\naffected or involved federal funds but left open the question of whether § 666\nrequires some other connection between the offense conduct and the expenditure of\nfederal funds). Several of our sister circuits have addressed this more broad question.\n\n       The Seventh Circuit has given § 666 a broad reading, ultimately concluding\nthat \"[i]t [was] not [its] part to trim § 666 by giving its text a crabbed reading.\"\nUnited States v. Grossi, 143 F.3d 348, 350 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 879\n(1998). Likewise, the Sixth Circuit has concluded that \"18 U.S.C. § 666 does not\nrequire a nexus between the alleged bribes and the federal funding.\" United States\n\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\fv. Dakota, 197 F.3d 821, 826 (6th Cir. 1999).4 The Fifth Circuit also has eschewed\nany nexus requirement. In United States v. Westmoreland, 841 F.2d 572 (5th Cir.),\ncert. denied, 488 U.S. 820 (1988), a county supervisor was convicted of accepting\nbribes and kickbacks in connection with her duty to purchase supplies for the county's\nhighway construction projects. Id. at 573-74. The county received $222,949 in\nfederal funds, but those funds were segregated and the alleged criminal activity did\nnot affect or implicate federal monies. Id. 575. Nonetheless, the Fifth Circuit\nconcluded that:\n\n      [b]y the terms of section 666, when a local government agency receives\n      an annual benefit of more than $10,000 under a federal assistance\n      program, its agents are governed by the statute, and an agent violates\n      subsection (b) when he engages in the prohibited conduct in any\n      transaction or matter or series of transactions or matters . . . concerning\n      the affairs of the local government agency.\n\nId. at 576 (internal quotation omitted). The Fifth Circuit reaffirmed its position in\nUnited States v. Moeller, 987 F.2d 1134 (5th Cir. 1993), concluding that § 666\nrequired only a nexus between the offense conduct and the agency receiving federal\nfunds and that this nexus was satisfied by § 666(b). Id. at 1137. It confirmed its\nposition more recently in United States v. Lipscomb, 299 F.3d 303 (5th Cir. 2002),\nin an opinion the court itself described as suffering from \"tripartite fractionation.\" Id.\nat 305 (Wiener, J.). Despite their differences on other issues, see infra Part III. A.,\nn.5, all members of the Lipscomb panel agreed that Westmoreland is still the law of\n\n\n      4\n        Although the Sixth Circuit has applied Dakota as good law, it has questioned\nits validity. See United States v. Suarez, 263 F.3d 468, 489 (6th Cir. 2001) (stating\nthat if the court were writing on a clean slate, it \"might well agree that proper\napplication of 18 U.S.C. § 666 requires a minimal nexus between the alleged criminal\nactivity and the federal funding received pursuant to that statute,\" but in light of\nDakota, it was bound to conclude that § 666 requires no nexus), cert. denied, 535 U.S.\n991 (2002).\n                                            6\n\fthe Fifth Circuit. See id. at 313 (Wiener, J.), 354 (Duhé, J., concurring in part,\ndissenting in part), 365 (Smith, J., dissenting).\n\n      Two circuits, the Second and the Third, conclude that § 666 requires the\ngovernment to prove at least some minimal nexus between the bribery and the federal\nbenefits beyond that explicitly required in § 666(b). See Zwick, 199 F.3d at 682 n.7;\nUnited States v. Santopietro, 166 F.3d 88, 93 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\n       In Santopietro, the Second Circuit recognized that Salinas limited its decision\nin United States v. Foley, 73 F.3d 484 (2d Cir. 1996), but concluded that it left\nuntouched that part of Foley holding that § 666 \"requires at least some connection\nbetween the bribe and a risk to the integrity of the federal funded program.\"\nSantopietro, 166 F.3d at 93. The Foley Court reached the conclusion that § 666\nrequired the government to prove a connection between the bribe and the federal\nfunds only after finding the statute to be ambiguous and then turning to the legislative\nhistory to resolve that ambiguity. Foley, 73 F.3d at 489.\n\n        Despite the long-standing principle of statutory construction that the title of a\nstatute cannot control the plain language of the statute, the Third Circuit reasoned that\nthe title of § 666, \"Theft or bribery concerning programs receiving Federal funds,\"\nimplied that the statute contains a minimal nexus requirement. Zwick, 199 F.3d at\n682. It avoided the \"literal interpretation\" of the statute and instead relied upon\nlegislative history to construct a \"plausible, albeit more contextual[] alternative\"\nreading. Id. at 683. It reasoned that \"Salinas found § 666(a)(1)(B) clear and\nunambiguous only on the question of whether the government must prove that the\ncorrupt activity had a demonstrated effect on federal funds or programming,\" id. at\n682 n.7, but that \"nothing in Salinas prevent[ed it] from determining that §\n666(a)(1)(B) is ambiguous on the issue of whether there is a federal connection\nrequirement,\" id. We respectfully disagree with the proposition that § 666 is\nambiguous on the federal connection requirement.\n\n                                           7\n\f        As with any question of statutory construction, we look first to the text of the\nstatute itself. United States v. McIntosh, 236 F.3d 968, 971 (8th Cir.), cert. denied,\n532 U.S. 1022 (2001). Section 666(a)(2) makes it a crime to \"corruptly give[],\noffer[], or agree[] to give anything of value to any person, with intent to influence or\nreward an agent of a[] . . . local . . . government, . . . or any agency thereof, in\nconnection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such\norganization, government, or agency involving anything of value of $5,000 or more\"\nif the \"organization, government, or agency receives, in any one year period, benefits\nin excess of $10,000 under a Federal program involving a grant, contract, subsidy,\nloan, guarantee, insurance or other form of Federal assistance.\" 18 U.S.C. § 666\n(emphasis added). The plain language encompasses the activity of local agents\nwherever subsection (b) attains. There is no qualification that the prohibited conduct\nmust have some relation to federal funds. Indeed, the statute proscribes the conduct\nof local agents in connection with \"any\" agency business or transaction. The word\n\"any\" is unambiguous and unqualified. Salinas, 522 U.S. at 57; Mo. Mun. League v.\nF.C.C., 299 F.3d 949, 955 (8th Cir. 2002) (citing cases and stating that time and time\nagain the Court has held that the modifier \"any\" prohibits a narrow construction of\na statute), petition for cert. filed (Feb. 18, 2003) (No. 02-1238); Westmoreland, 841\nF.2d at 576 (\"[T]he relevant statutory language [is] plain and unambiguous.\"); United\nStates v. McCormack, 31 F. Supp. 2d 176, 186 (D. Mass. 1998) (stating Salinas\n\"announced that the statutory language, 'in connection with any business or\ntransaction,' is not ambiguous,\" that \"[t]he language is clear,\" and that \"the reach of\nthe statute is clearly broad\"). It is clear to us that the plain text of the statute does not\nrequire any connection between the federal funds received by the agency and the\noffense conduct. The statute applies to all offense conduct involving anything of\nvalue of $5000 or more that involves \"any\" agency business, transaction, or series of\ntransactions so long as the relevant agency received the requisite amount of federal\nbenefits ($10,000) within the defined time period as required in § 666(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f         The argument that § 666 is unambiguous as to the narrow question answered\nin Salinas but ambiguous as to the broad question presented here is unpersuasive. “A\nstatute can be unambiguous without addressing every interpretive theory offered. . .\n. It need only be plain to anyone reading the Act that the statute encompasses the\nconduct at issue.\" Salinas, 522 U.S. at 60 (internal quotation omitted). Thus, while\nit is true that the Salinas Court held only that the government need not prove that the\noffense conduct directly affected federal funds, the Salinas Court's characterization\nof the operative terms of the statute as broad and unqualified supports our conclusion\nthat the statute is also unambiguous as to the broader question presented here. See\nSalinas, 522 U.S. at 56 (stating that \"[t]he enactment's expansive, unqualified\nlanguage\" does not support a limiting interpretation of the statute), 57 (\"The\nprohibition is not confined to a business or transaction which affects federal funds.\"),\n57 (\"Furthermore, the broad definition of the 'circumstances' to which the statute\napplies provides no textual basis for limiting the reach of the bribery prohibition.\"),\n57 (\"The statute applies to all cases in which an 'organization, government, or agency'\nreceives the statutory amount of benefits under a federal program.\"), 57 (\"The\nstatute's plain language fails to provide any basis for limiting § 666(a)(1)(B) to bribes\naffecting federal funds.\"). The Court reaffirmed this broad reading of § 666 in\nFischer v. United States, 529 U.S. 667 (2000). There, the court described § 666 as\n\"expansive, both as to the conduct forbidden and the entities covered.\" Id. at 678\n(internal quotations and alteration omitted).\n\n       The fact that the Salinas Court construed § 666(a)(1)(B) and that this case\ninvolves § 666(a)(2) makes no difference in our analysis. Section (a)(1) and section\n(a)(2) are complementary provisions: one section criminalizes the solicitation or\nacceptance of bribes while the other criminalizes the offering or giving of bribes.\nBoth provisions, however, prohibit bribery in connection with \"any business,\ntransaction, or series of transactions\" of organizations which receive the requisite\namount of federal benefits required in subsection (b). Neither provision suggests that\nthe business or transaction in question must somehow implicate a federal program.\n\n                                           9\n\fFor the point under consideration here, the relevant terms of the two sections are\nidentical. Therefore, relying on the text of the statute and the Supreme Court's\ncharacterization of the operative language in the statute as broad and unqualified, we\nconclude that § 666 is unambiguous as to the question presented here.\n\n       Generally, where the text of a statute is unambiguous, the statute should be\nenforced as written, McIntosh, 236 F.3d at 972, and \"[o]nly the most extraordinary\nshowing of contrary intentions in the legislative history will justify a departure from\nthat language,\" United States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675, 680 (1985) (internal\nquotation omitted). We find no extraordinary showing of contrary intent that\nwarrants deviation from the plain text of the statute. Congress enacted § 666 to\n\"safeguard finite federal resources from corruption and to police those with control\nof federal funds.\" U.S. v. Rooney, 37 F.3d 847, 851 (2d Cir.1994); see also S. Rep.\nNo. 98-225, at 370 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3511 (\"[T]he\npurpose of this section [is] to protect the integrity of the vast sums of money\ndistributed through federal programs.\"). Prior to the enactment of § 666, however,\nthe task of protecting the integrity of federal funds was made more difficult because\nof gaps in the statutory scheme. Specifically, prior to the enactment of § 666:\n\n      thefts from other organizations or governments receiving federal\n      financial assistance [could have been] prosecuted under the general theft\n      of federal property statute, 18 U.S.C. 641, only if it [could have been]\n      shown that the property stolen [was] property of the United States. In\n      many cases, such prosecution [was] impossible because title ha[d]\n      passed to the recipient before the property [was] stolen, or the funds\n      [were] so commingled that the federal character of the funds [could not]\n      be shown. This situation [gave] rise to a serious gap in the law, since\n      even though title to the monies may have passed, the federal government\n      clearly retain[ed] a strong interest in assuring the integrity of such\n      program funds.\n\nS. Rep. No. 98-225, at 369, reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3510; see also United\nStates v. Ferrara, 990 F. Supp. 146, 149-50 (E.D.N.Y. 1998) (\"Moreover, [prior to the\n\n                                          10\n\fenactment of § 666,] successful prosecutions were impossible in those instances\nwhere title to the federal property had passed to a recipient before the property was\nstolen, or where the federal character of the funds was irredeemably lost due to\ncommingling with non-federal monies.\"). Section 666 was passed to fill the gaps in\nthe prior anticorruption scheme. Westmoreland, 841 F.2d at 577 (stating that\nCongress specifically chose to protect the integrity of federal funds \"by enacting a\ncriminal statute that would eliminate the need to trace the flow of federal monies and\nthat would avoid inconsistencies caused by the different ways that various federal\nprograms disburse funds and control their administration\"). Congress decided that\nthe most effective way to insure the integrity of federal funds disbursed to sub-\nnational agencies was to change the enforcement paradigm from one that monitored\nfederal funds to one that monitored the integrity of the recipient agencies. Fischer,\n529 U.S. at 678 (\"Coupled with the broad substantive prohibitions of subsection (a),\nthe language of subsection (b) reveals Congress's expansive, unambiguous intent to\nensure the integrity of organizations participating in federal assistance programs.\");\nUnited States v. Simas, 937 F.2d 459, 463 (9th Cir.1991) (\"By enacting section 666,\nCongress plainly decided to protect federal funds by preserving the integrity of the\nentities that receive the federal funds rather than requiring the tracing of federal funds\nto a particular illegal transaction.\"); Westmoreland, 841 F.2d at 578 (\"Congress seeks\nto preserve the integrity of federal funds by assuring the integrity of the organizations\nor agencies that receive them.\").\n\n       The legislative history reveals that § 666 was drafted and enacted to \"extend\nfederal bribery prohibitions to bribes offered to state and local officials employed by\nagencies receiving federal funds,\" Salinas, 522 U.S. at 58 (emphasis added), and not\nto limit the scope of the federal bribery prohibition. In addition, because § 666\nchanged the focus of federal anticorruption efforts from policing federal funds to\npolicing the agencies that receive and administer those funds, the argument that there\nmust be a nexus between the offense conduct and the federal funds beyond that\nexplicitly provided for in § 666(b) seems inconsistent with the statute. In any event,\n\n                                           11\n\fin light of the foregoing legislative history we conclude, at minimum, that there is no\nclear or extraordinary showing of contrary legislative intent sufficient to cause us to\noverride the text of a statute unambiguous on its face.\n\n       While we recognize that in construing statutes courts should avoid\nconstitutional questions where possible, we note that even if we were to conclude that\n§ 666 contained an unstated nexus requirement between the offense conduct and the\nfederal funds, that would not dispose of the lurking constitutional question. Simply\nconcluding that the statute contains an undefined nexus requirement ignores the\nconstitutional question of whether Congress had the power to enact this statute at all.\nNo amount of creative interpolation could save a statute that Congress lacked the\nauthority to enact. United States v. Morgan, 230 F.3d 1067, 1073 (8th Cir. 2000)\n(Bye, J., concurring) (\"Judicial efforts to render § 666 palatable by adding an element\nto the crime cannot alter our Constitution's basic limitation on federal legislative\npower. No amount of creative drafting permits the judiciary to preserve a statute that\nCongress plainly lacked the power to create.\"), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 825 (2001).\nBecause we conclude, however, that § 666 as construed is a law necessary and proper\nto the execution of the Spending Power, see infra Part III.B., we need not worry about\nlimiting the scope of a plainly written statute.\n\n       Given the plain and unambiguous language of the statute and the absence of\nany extraordinary contrary legislative history which suggests that we should deviate\nfrom the text, we are compelled to conclude that other than the threshhold showing\nthat the agency in question received more than $10,000 in federal benefits in any one-\nyear period, § 666 imposes no requirement that there be a connection between the\noffense conduct and the federal funds. See Morgan, 230 F.3d at 1073 (Bye, J.,\nconcurring) (concluding that a federal nexus requirement should not be read into §\n666 on the grounds that the court should not inject elements into plain and\nunambiguous statutes); George D.

We review this federal constitutional\nquestion de novo. United States v. Shepherd, 284 F.3d 965, 969 (8th Cir. 2002).\n\n      A.     Section 666 is not a condition placed on the receipt of federal\n             funds.\n\n        It is axiomatic that \"[e]very law enacted by Congress must be based on one or\nmore of its powers enumerated in the Constitution.\" United States v. Morrison, 529\nU.S. 598, 607 (2000). The courts that have applied § 666 agree that Congress enacted\n§ 666 pursuant to its spending powers. See, e.g., Fischer, 529 U.S. at 689-90 n.3\n(Thomas, J., dissenting); McCormack, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 186 n.18 (collecting cases).\nThe spending power is encompassed in Art. I., § 8, cl. 1, of the Constitution.\nPennhurst State Sch. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 9 n.5 (1981). It provides that the\n\"Congress shall have Power To . . . provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United\nStates.\" U.S. Const. art. I, cl. 1. The Supreme Court has \"repeatedly characterized\n. . . Spending Clause legislation as much in the nature of a contract: in return for\nfederal funds, the recipients agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.\"\nBarnes v. Gorman, 122 S. Ct. 2097, 2100-01 (2002) (internal quotation and alteration\nomitted). The government argues that § 666 can be sustained as a valid condition\nplaced on the receipt of federal funds. We disagree.\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f        While traditional Spending Clause legislation is in the \"nature\" of a contract,\nit is not a contract. Mo. Child Care Ass'n v. Cross, 294 F.3d 1034, 1041 (8th Cir.\n2002). Instead, \"contract\" is used only metaphorically to illuminate and explain\ncertain aspects of the relationship formed between the federal government and the\nrecipient of the federal funds. We find this metaphor useful to our discussion here,\nand we note that § 666 has none of the hallmarks of a contractual relationship which\ncharacterizes typical Spending Clause legislation.\n\n       Unlike typical Spending Clause enactments, § 666 imposes no affirmative\nobligation on the recipient of federal funds. Cf. South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203,\n205 (1987) (sustaining 23 U.S.C. § 158 (1982 ed. Supp. III), which directed the\nSecretary of Transportation to withhold a certain percentage of federal highway funds\nfrom states which had not yet made it illegal for a person under age 21 to purchase\nor possess alcohol, as a valid condition on the receipt of federal funds); Pennhurst,\n451 U.S. at 12-13 (noting that under the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and\nBill of Rights Act of 1975, 89 Stat. 486, the recipient of federal funds had to take\n\"'affirmative action' to hire qualified handicapped individuals,\" submit a plan\nevaluating services offered under the Act, and provide the federal government with\nassurances that each person serviced in the program had a habilitation plan); Fullilove\nv. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 474 (1980) (\"Congress has frequently employed the\nSpending Power to further broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal\nmoneys upon compliance by the recipient with federal . . . directives. This Court has\nrepeatedly upheld against constitutional challenge the use of this technique to induce\ngovernments and private parties to cooperate voluntarily with federal policy.\"), 474\n(\"The program conditions receipt of public works grants upon agreement by the state\nor local governmental grantee that at least 10% of the federal funds will be devoted\nto contracts with minority businesses.\"), overruled on other grounds by Adarand\nConstructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200 (1995).\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f      Nor does § 666 proscribe conduct of the recipient of the federal funds. Cf.\nBarnes, 122 S. Ct. at 2101 n.1 (concluding that valid Spending Clause legislation can\ninclude legislation that \"simply prohibits certain discriminatory conduct.\" (internal\nquotation and alteration omitted)); Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 122 S. Ct. 2268, 2272-73\n(2002) (describing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, 88 Stat.\n571, as a conditions statute which authorizes the withholding of federal funds from\neducational institutions that permit the release of education records without the\nconsent of the students); Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Ed., 526 U.S. 629, 638\n(1999) (discussing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373,\nwhich prohibits sex-based discrimination under any education program receiving\nfederal financial assistance); Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563, 566 (1974) (upholding\napplication of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 241, which prohibits\ndiscrimination in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance).\n\n       As such, § 666 has no contractual \"terms\" with which the recipient of federal\nfunds must comply. Barnes, 122 S. Ct. at 2101 (\"Just as a valid contract requires\noffer and acceptance of its terms, the legitimacy of Congress's power to legislate\nunder the spending power rests on whether the recipient voluntarily and knowingly\naccepts the terms of the 'contract.'\" (internal quotation and alteration omitted)). We\nconclude therefore that § 666 is not a conditions statute at all and that the traditional\nDole analysis is inapplicable here. United States v. Cantor, 897 F. Supp. 110, 113\n(S.D.N.Y. 1995) (\"18 U.S.C. § 666 does not impose a condition on the receipt of\nfederal funds. The statute neither requires a state's compliance with federal regulatory\nor administrative directives, nor prevents state action. . . . Section 666 does not\nderogate any state right. . . . Section 666 does not force the state government to do\nanything.\" (internal citations and quotations omitted)), aff'd 141 F.3d 1152 (2d Cir.),\ncert. denied, 525 U.S. 814 (1998).\n\n       The fact that § 666 directly regulates the conduct of third parties and not the\nrecipients of the federal benefits supports our conclusion that this is not a conditions\n\n                                           15\n\fstatute at all. Morgan, 230 F.3d at 1074 (Bye, J., concurring) (\"In enacting § 666, .\n. . Congress did not contract with states or local governments. . . . Section 666\nreaches beyond punishment of the state and local governments who receive those\nfunds to proscribe the conduct of third persons who aren't parties to the funding\ncontract.\"); Cantor, 897 F. Supp. at 113 (\"All Congress has done in Section 666 is to\npass a law making the conduct of individuals, not the state, criminal.\" (internal\nquotations omitted)). We could find no persuasive or authoritative case law\nsupporting the proposition that Congress, acting pursuant to its power to attach\nconditions to the receipt of federal funds, has the authority to directly regulate the\nconduct of third parties who are not actually the recipients of the federal funds.5\nInstead, the case law demonstrates that funding condition statutes may only directly\nregulate the recipients of the federal funds who then may or may not undertake action\nvis-a-vis third parties. See, e.g., Davis, 526 U.S. at 640 (\"[I]n return for federal funds,\nthe States agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.\" (internal quotation\nomitted) (emphasis added)), 641 (affirming statute because it was drafted in such a\nway that \"[t]he Government's enforcement power may only be exercised against the\nfunding recipient.\" (emphasis added)); Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524\nU.S. 274, 286 (1998) (\"The two statutes [Title VI and Title IX] operate in the same\nmanner, conditioning an offer of federal funding on a promise by the recipient not to\ndiscriminate, in what amounts essentially to a contract between the Government and\nthe recipient of funds.\" (emphasis added)); Dole, 483 U.S. at 206 (\"Congress may\nattach conditions on the receipt of federal funds, and has repeatedly employed the\n\n      5\n        The Fifth Circuit recently addressed the question of whether § 666 can be\nsustained as a condition on the receipt of federal funds. The panel could not generate\na majority for any position. Judge Wiener opined that § 666 was similar to a cross-\ncutting condition–one that applies to all grants of federal money–and applied the Dole\nconditions analysis. Lipscomb, 299 F.3d at 318-23 (Wiener, J., writing separately as\nto Part V. B.). Judge Duhé did not reach the issue because, he argued, it was not\nraised at trial or on appeal. Id. at 360 (Duhé, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). Judge Jerry E. Smith concluded that § 666 \"does not qualify as a conditional-\ngrant statute.\" Id. at 366 (Smith, J., dissenting).\n                                            16\n\fpower to further broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys\nupon compliance by the recipient with federal . . . directives.\" (emphasis added)\n(internal quotations omitted)); Oklahoma v.

Accordingly, we conclude that § 666 cannot be sustained as a condition\nattached to the receipt of federal funds because this statute is not a conditions statute\nat all. Section 666 is merely a general criminal statute which directly regulates the\nconduct of persons who are not parties to the funding \"contract.\"\n\n      B.     Section 666 is a necessary and proper exercise of Congressional\n             power.\n\n       Our conclusion that this statute is not a conditions-type statute does not\nnecessarily render it infirm. Indeed, the Supreme Court has intimated that § 666 is\na constitutional exercise of Congress's legislative power. See Salinas, 522 U.S. at 60\n(\"[T]here is no serious doubt about the constitutionality of § 666(a)(1)(B) as applied\nto the facts of this case.\"), 61 (\"We simply decide that . . . § 666(a)(1)(B) does not\nrequire the Government to prove the bribe in question had any particular influence\non federal funds and that under this construction the statute is constitutional as\napplied in this case.\"). Our brother Bye has previously concluded that the above\nquoted sentences are mere \"constitutional speculations.\" Morgan, 230 F.3d at 1072\nn.3. We find it significant that no member of the unanimous Salinas Court disagreed\nwith or qualified these statements. In addition, in Fischer, the Court resolved another\nissue of statutory construction arising under § 666, and no member of the Court\nsuggested that the statute might be constitutionally infirm. We think it ill-advised to\nnow declare that § 666 is void ab initio as being outside of Congress's legislative\ndomain after the Supreme Court has twice indicated that the statute can be\nconstitutional as applied. With that thought in mind, we look beyond the Spending\nClause to other provisions of the Constitution which may or may not provide legal\nauthority to sustain § 666.\n\n                                           17\n\f         So that the Constitution \"be not a splendid bauble,\" the framers of our\ngovernment inserted the Necessary and Proper Clause into the Constitution to\n\"remove all doubts respecting the right to legislate on that vast mass of incidental\npowers which must be involved in the constitution.\" M'Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S.\n(4 Wheat.) 316, 420-21 (1819). The Clause provides that \"[t]he Congress shall have\nPower . . . To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into\nExecution\" all the powers vested in the Government of the United States. U.S. Const.\nart. I, § 8, cl. 18. Both the Spending Power and the Necessary and Proper Clause are\ncontained in section 8 of the first Article, and the Necessary and Proper Clause\napplies to the spending power, enabling Congress to enact all laws which are\nconvenient to the exercise of disbursing federal funds. Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 474\n(\"[T]he power to 'provide for the . . . general Welfare' is an independent grant of\nlegislative authority, distinct from other broad congressional powers.\"); Buckley v.\nValeo, 424 U.S. 1, 90 (1976) (\"[T]he General Welfare Clause . . . is . . . a grant of\npower, the scope of which is quite expansive, particularly in view of the enlargement\nof power by the Necessary and Proper Clause.\"); M'Culloch, 17 U.S. at 421. We\nrecognize that the Necessary and Proper Clause does not confer upon the Congress\na broad police power. It does, however, allow Congress the luxury to choose from\nan array of means with which to implement its enumerated powers, including its\nSpending Power. Chief Justice Marshall has best articulated the relationship between\nconstitutional means and ends: \"[l]et the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope\nof the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted\nto that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the\nconstitution, are constitutional.\" M'Culloch, 17 U.S. at 421.\n\n      Applying the M'Culloch framework, we conclude that § 666 is a law necessary\nand proper to the execution of Congress's spending power. See United States v.\nEdgar, 304 F.3d 1320, 1325 (11th Cir.) (\"[W]e are persuaded that a basis for the\nenactment of § 666 may be found in Congress's authority, under the Necessary and\nProper Clause, to protect its capacity to fruitfully exercise the spending power.\"), cert.\n\n                                           18\n\fdenied, 123 S. Ct. 679 (2002); United States v. Bigler, 907 F. Supp. 401, 402 (S.D.\nFla. 1995) (\"Article I, § 8 gives Congress the power to 'provide for the ... general\nWelfare.' This power, in conjunction with the necessary and proper clause, gives\nCongress the power to enact § 666. In doing so, Congress did not violate the principle\nof federalism, nor did it violate the tenth amendment.\"). First, we think it an\nincontestable proposition that the disbursement of federal funds to subnational\nagencies to advance the general welfare is a legitimate end within the scope of the\nConstitution. We further quickly conclude that Congress also has a legitimate right\nto protect these disbursements from misappropriation once made. We also conclude\nthat § 666 is consistent with and does not contravene the letter or spirit of the\nConstitution.6 The difficult question in this case is whether § 666 is an appropriate\n\n\n       6\n         The dissent argues that this law is not \"proper,\" that is, it contravenes the letter\nand spirit of the Constitution by failing to recognize constitutional principles of\nlimited federal government and state sovereignty. In support of this argument, the\ndissent relies on Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706 (1999), Printz v. United States, 521\nU.S. 898 (1997), and New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992), for the\nproposition that \"[f]ederal laws that usurp the traditional domain of state authority are\n. . . not proper.\" Post at 4. We, respectfully, are of the view that the dissent reads\nthese cases too broadly. Alden, Printz, and New York answer only the limited\nquestion of when the central government is prohibited from acting directly on the\nStates or on the States' officers. See Alden, 527 U.S. at 712 (\"We hold that the\npowers delegated to Congress under Article I of the United States Constitution do not\ninclude the power to subject nonconsenting States to private suits for damages in state\ncourts.\"); Printz, 521 U.S. at 935 (holding that Congress cannot compel State officers\nto administer federal regulatory program); New York, 505 U.S. at 149 (holding that\nConstitution does not confer upon Congress the power to compel the States to enact\na regulatory program). These cases merely recognize the larger constitutional\nprinciple that \"the Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers upon Congress\nthe power to regulate individuals, not States,\" and that \"where Congress has the\nauthority under the Constitution to pass laws requiring or prohibiting certain acts it\nlacks the power directly to compel the States to require or prohibit those acts.\" New\nYork, 505 U.S. at 166; accord Alden, 527 U.S. at 714; Printz, 521 U.S. at 919-20.\nNone of these cases addresses the question presented here: whether Congress has the\n                                             19\n\fmeans plainly adapted to achieving Congress's end. The resolution of this inquiry\nraises two subsidiary questions: (1) whether Congress has the power to enact criminal\nlegislation pursuant to the Necessary and Proper Clause, and if so, (2) whether § 666\nis plainly adapted, i.e., rationally related, to achieving Congress's end.\n\n      As to the first question, we have no doubt that the creation of a general criminal\nlaw incident to a constitutional end is within the sovereign power of the federal\ngovernment. M'Culloch, 17 U.S. at 418 (\"The good sense of the public has\npronounced, without hesitation, that the power of punishment appertains to\nsovereignty, and may be exercised, whenever the sovereign has a right to act, as\nincidental to his constitutional powers.\"). Chief Justice Marshall provided concrete\nexamples of the scope of this power in M'Culloch:\n\n      Take, for example, the power 'to establish post-offices and post-roads.'\n      This power is executed, by the single act of making the establishment.\n      But, from this has been inferred the power and duty of carrying the mail\n      along the post-road, from one post-office to another. And from this\n      implied power, has again been inferred the right to punish those who\n      steal letters from the post-office, or rob the mail. . . . This right is indeed\n      essential to the beneficial exercise of the power, but not indispensably\n      necessary to its existence. So, of the punishment of the crimes of\n      stealing or falsifying a record or process of a court of the United States,\n      or of perjury in such court. To punish these offences, is certainly\n      conducive to the due administration of justice.\n\nId. at 417. More recently, our court has recognized that Congress has the authority\nto pass a criminal law of general application pursuant to the Necessary and Proper\n\n\nauthority to regulate the conduct of individuals, not States, who deal with\norganizations that receive federal benefits. Because there has been no clear signal\nfrom the Supreme Court that there are independent federalism-based limits on the\npower of Congress to regulate the conduct of individuals, we conclude that this\nstatute is \"proper\" and does not contravene the letter or spirit of the Constitution.\n                                            20\n\fClause. See United States v. Dittrich, 100 F.3d 84, 87 (8th Cir. 1996) (\"A law\nmaking it a crime to steal property from a Post Office is well within even the\nnarrowest construction of the Necessary and Proper Clause.\"), cert. denied, 520 U.S.\n1178 (1997); see also Dropps v. United States, 34 F.2d 15, 18 (8th Cir. 1929) (\"That\nCongress has power under the constitution to enact a law punishing bribe taking on\nthe part of officers of the United States and others acting in an official capacity for\nthe United States is patently within its general powers to make all laws necessary and\nproper for carrying into execution the particular powers specifically conferred upon\nit.\"), cert. denied, 281 U.S. 720 (1930). These authorities demonstrate that Congress\nhas the authority to enact general criminal legislation incident to its specifically\nenumerated powers.\n\n       As to the more specific question, we conclude that § 666 is a means plainly\nadapted, i.e., rationally related, to achieving the efficacious expenditure of federal\nfunds and is, therefore, a law necessary and proper to the execution of the spending\npower. In M'Culloch, Chief Justice Marshall determined that \"necessary\" had an\nexpansive meaning. The Clause does not restrain Congress's choice of means to only\nthose means that are absolutely or indispensably necessary to the exercise of its\npowers. Rather, the Necessary and Proper Clause allows Congress to exercise its\ndiscretion in choosing particular means that may not be \"necessary\" in the strict sense\nof the word, but instead are convenient or conducive to the exercise of its powers.\nThe Legal Tender Cases, 110 U.S. 421, 441 (1884) (\"Where various systems might\nbe adopted . . . , it might be said, with respect to each, that it was not necessary,\nbecause the end might be obtained by other means. Congress must possess the choice\nof means, and must be empowered to use any means which are in fact conducive to\nthe exercise of a power granted by the constitution.\"); M'Culloch, 17 U.S. at 420.\nThus, Chief Justice Marshall, relying on his expansive interpretation of \"necessary,\"\nconcluded that the power to establish post offices and post roads included the power\nto establish criminal penalties for interfering with the mail. Likewise, he concluded\nthat the federal government could incorporate a National Bank even though that\n\n                                          21\n\fpower is not enumerated in Article I. Chief Justice Marshall concluded that these so-\ncalled \"implied powers\" were constitutional exercises of the sovereign power because\neach reasonably advanced an enumerated power. M'Culloch thus teaches us that\nCongress may use means which are unspecified in the text of the constitution to\nachieve enumerated ends where there is a rational relationship between the means and\nthe ends. Here, we know the end is the efficacious disbursement of federal funds. To\ndetermine whether § 666 is rationally related to that end we must look to Congress's\nintent in passing the law and the specific mechanisms by which § 666 hopes to\nachieve the desired end.\n\n       As we have discussed above, § 666 was designed to protect the integrity of the\nvast sums of federal monies disbursed through federal programs. Section 666 could\nhave been more narrowly crafted to more directly advance this goal, for example, by\ncriminalizing the theft of the federal funds themselves while in the hands of the\nrecipient, or by requiring a direct nexus between the offense conduct and a federal\nprogram, but \"[t]he Constitution has never been regarded as denying to the Congress\nthe necessary resources of flexibility and practicality to perform its function.\" Yakus\nv. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 425 (1944) (internal quotation and alteration omitted).\nHere, Congress has made a determination that the most effective way to protect the\nintegrity of federal funds is to police the integrity of the agencies administering those\nfunds. As discussed in Part II, a more limited statutory scheme was rendered\ntoothless because of the difficulty of tracing federal funds once they had been\ndisbursed. In addition, we note that \"money is fungible and its effect transcends\nprogram boundaries.\" Grossi, 143 F.3d at 350. The maladministration of funds in\none part of an agency can affect the allocation of funds, whether federal or local in\norigin, throughout an entire agency. Thus, to suggest that corruption involving a\ndiscrete department or section of an agency that does not itself receive federal funds\nor administer a federal program can have no effect on the integrity or efficacy of a\nfederal program is to ignore the fact that money is fungible and that federal funds are\noften comingled with funds from other sources. Section 666 addresses this problem\n\n                                           22\n\fby policing the integrity of the entire organization that receives federal benefits. In\nsustaining the constitutionality of § 666 under the Necessary and Proper Clause , the\nEleventh Circuit recently has come to the same conclusion. See Edgar, 304 F.3d at\n1327 (\"It is reasonable for Congress to conclude that any corruption of such recipient\norganizations, regardless of whether the corruption involves the misappropriation of\nspecifically federal funds, endangers the comprehensive programs in which the\norganizations participate, and thus the effective exercise of the Congressional\nspending power as well.\").\n\n      The Court has approved this type of indirect enforcement mechanism in\nanother context. In Westfall v. United States, 274 U.S. 256 (1927), the Supreme\nCourt affirmed the constitutionality of the Federal Reserve Act, 38 Stat. 259, as\namended, 40 Stat. 232, which made it a crime to misapply the funds of a State bank\nthat was a member of the Federal Reserve System. The reasoning of the Court is\npersuasive on the issue presented in this case:\n\n      The argument is that Congress has no power to punish offences against\n      the property rights of State banks. It is said that the statute is so broad\n      that it covers such offenses when they could not result in any loss to the\n      Federal Reserve Banks. . . . [I]f a State bank chooses to come into the\n      System created by the United States, the United States may punish acts\n      injurious to the System, although done to a corporation that the State\n      also is entitled to protect. . . . That there is such a System and that the\n      Reserve Banks are interested in the solvency and financial condition of\n      the members also is too obvious to require a repetition of the careful\n      analysis presented by the Solicitor General. The only suggestion that\n      may deserve a word is that the statute applies indifferently whether there\n      is a loss to the Reserve Banks or not. But every fraud like the one before\n      us weakens the member bank and therefore weakens the System.\n      Moreover, when it is necessary in order to prevent an evil to make the\n      law embrace more than the precise thing to be prevented it may do so.\n\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fId. at 258-59 (internal citations omitted). As in Westfall, the government here has an\ninterest in ensuring that the system of subnational agencies that administer federal\nfunds remains strong even where there is not a direct loss to the federal funds\nthemselves. Congress could well have determined that an agency official who is\nwilling to take a bribe in the disbursements of nonfederal program money is not a\nperson who should be entrusted with federal program funds either.\n\n       Any concern that we may have had regarding the scope of this law is allayed\nby the statute itself. The statute is self-limiting to ensure that \"federal regulatory\npower [does not] tag along after federal money like a hungry dog.\" Morgan, 230 F.3d\nat 1074 (Bye, J., concurring) (internal quotations and emphasis omitted). Section\n666(b) is a jurisdictional provision that ensures in each particular case that the federal\npower will be exercised only where the federal government has a substantial interest\nat stake and where substantial federal funds may be at risk. See Fischer, 529 U.S. at\n689 n.3 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\"Title 18 U.S.C. § 666(b) is, after all, a\njurisdictional provision that allows federal prosecution only if the specific\norganization at issue received more than $10,000 in 'benefits.'\"), id. at 690 n.3\n(\"Without a jurisdiction provision that would ensure that in each case the exercise of\nfederal power is related to the federal interest in a federal program, § 666 would\ncriminalize routine acts of fraud or bribery.\"). The $10,000 threshold requirement\nand the $5000 transactional requirement create a sufficient nexus between the offense\nconduct and federal funds to ensure that federal power will not be extended to the\nprosecution of merely local matters that may not jeopardize in any significant manner\nthe integrity of federal programs.\n\n       More importantly, were we to conclude that Congress lacked the authority to\nlegislate in this area, then the protection of federal funds would be left to the whim\nof state and local officials–perhaps even the same officials who pose a threat to the\nintegrity of the federal funds in the first place and who therefore possess a strong\n\n\n\n                                           24\n\fdisincentive to protect them. The proposition that the federal government is\npowerless to vindicate its own interests is clearly untenable:\n\n      \"The government of the Union, though limited in its powers, is supreme\n      within its sphere of action. No trace is to be found in the constitution of\n      an intention to create a dependence of the government of the Union on\n      those of the states, for the execution of the great powers assigned to it.\n      Its means are adequate to its ends; and on those means alone was it\n      expected to rely for the accomplishment of its ends. To impose on it the\n      necessity of resorting to means which it cannot control, which another\n      government may furnish or withhold, would render its course\n      precarious, the result of its measures uncertain, and create a dependence\n      on other governments, which might disappoint its most important\n      designs, and is incompatible with the language of the constitution.\"\n\nLogan v. United States, 144 U.S. 263, 283 (1892), quoting M'Culloch, 17 U.S. at 424.\nWe reject it.\n\n       Accordingly, we hold that § 666 is a legitimate exercise of Congress's\nundisputed power to make a law that is necessary and proper for the carrying out of\nits enumerated power to provide for the general welfare of the United States.\n\n                                          IV.\n\n       To the extent that the district court held that 18 U.S.C. § 666 requires no nexus\nbetween the offense conduct and federal funds beyond that required in subsection (b),\nthe judgment of the district court is affirmed. We reverse that part of the district\ncourt's judgment finding § 666 is facially unconstitutional. We remand this case to\nthe district court for reinstatement of the indictment and for such further proceedings\nnot inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\fBYE, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n       No one doubts the constitutional authority of Congress to enact criminal laws\npunishing behavior affecting tangible federal interests. However, when Congress\nseeks to punish conduct with no connection to federal interests, conduct traditionally\npunished only by state and local governments exercising their general police powers,\nCongress exceeds its constitutional authority. The statute we review today, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 666(a)(2), punishes a broad swath of conduct bearing little relationship to any\nfederal interest. It establishes federal criminal liability for those who bribe state and\nlocal government officials, provided only that the government receives $10,000 per\nyear in federal program benefits. Id. § 666(a)(2), 666(b). A briber need not handle,\nmanage, administer or supervise the receipt or disbursement of federal funds, and the\npurpose of the bribe need not relate to federal program benefits. It is therefore\nlogically and legally untenable to assert a federal interest in punishing these bribers.\n\n       In my view, the majority's decision to uphold § 666(a)(2) despite this infirmity\nswims against the tide of governing law. A wave of recent Supreme Court decisions\nemphasizes Congress' limited ability to federalize criminal conduct, United States v.\nMorrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), and to\ninterfere in matters traditionally left to state governance, Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S.\n706 (1999), Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997). These decisions guide my\nreview of § 666(a)(2) and require my respectful dissent.\n\n                                            I\n\n      I do agree with the majority in one important respect: section 666(a)(2) cannot\nbe justified solely as an exercise of Congress' Spending Clause authority. The\nmajority properly rests this holding upon the absence of any statutory link between\nthe bribe and the state or local government's receipt or use of federal benefits.\nBecause § 666(a)(2) does not link the bribe to federal benefits, the statute\n\n                                           26\n\fencompasses and punishes conduct well beyond Congress' ability to \"provide for the\n. . . general Welfare of the United States.\" U.S. Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 1. Indeed, the\nstatute's breadth leads to absurd results: only by injecting a new element into the\nstatute can a court forestall the conviction of a person who bribes the city meat\ninspector while the city parks department receives $10,000 in federal benefits. See\nUnited States v. Santopietro, 166 F.3d 88, 93 (2d Cir. 1999). The majority wisely\nrejects the supposed Spending Clause moorings of § 666(a)(2).\n\n       Had the majority stopped at this point, I would have joined its opinion. The\nmajority continues onward, however, reaching beyond its Spending Clause analysis\nand \"resort[ing] to the last, best hope of those who defend ultra vires congressional\naction, the Necessary and Proper Clause.\" Printz, 521 U.S. at 923. The majority\napparently casts aside its earlier qualm that § 666(a)(2) requires no connection\nbetween the bribe and federal benefits. The majority instead perceives a bare,\n\"rational relationship\" between punishing bribers and maintaining the integrity of\nfederal programs, and on that basis declares the Necessary and Proper Clause a proper\nfont of congressional authority. This may be correct, but it answers only half the\nquestion we must decide.\n\n                                           II\n\n      In my view, the principal defect in the majority opinion is its inattention to the\nconjunctive \"and\" that separates the words \"necessary and proper.\" The majority\nadvances several arguments suggesting § 666(a)(2) is \"necessary,\" in the sense\nenvisioned in M'Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 420-21 (1819). But\nthe majority fails to ask—let alone resolve—whether the statute is also \"proper.\"\nThis is not merely a semantic dispute, for in Printz and Alden the Supreme Court\nadvanced an interpretation of \"proper\" that calls into question the constitutionality of\nfederal statutes that trespass upon the domain of state and local legislative power.\nSection 666(a)(2) is one such statute.\n\n                                          27\n\f       M'Culloch holds that Congress enjoys broad powers to select the means of\nenacting its objectives. Id. at 421. Thus, in determining whether a law is \"necessary,\"\ncourts must review Congress' law-making efforts with considerable deference. The\nmajority describes this deference in terms of rationality: courts may not demand of\nCongress anything more than a rational relationship between its chosen means and\nends. This reading of M'Culloch is, of course, received wisdom. Applying\nM'Culloch in this fashion, the majority makes a fairly convincing argument that the\n\"fit\" between § 666(a)(2) and Congress' underlying objective to preserve the integrity\nof federal programs is rational. However, because there is a rational relationship\nbetween Congress' aim and the law it enacted, under M'Culloch, the law is\n\"necessary.\" But M'Culloch says very little, if anything, about what makes a law\n\"proper.\" That specific question largely evaded the Court's attention until Printz and\nAlden.\n\n       Printz began bridging this doctrinal gap by drawing upon a law review article\nthat develops a legal and historical distinction between \"necessary\" laws and \"proper\"\nones. Gary Lawson & Patricia B. Granger, The \"Proper\" Scope of Federal Power: A\nJurisdictional Interpretation of the Sweeping Clause, 43 Duke L.J. 267 (1993). Printz\nrejected the argument that Congress could commandeer state officials to implement\ncertain federal mandates by using its Necessary and Proper Clause power to effectuate\nits Commerce Clause authority. 521 U.S. at 923-24. Relying solely on its\nunderstanding of what constitutes a \"proper\" law, the Court held the Necessary and\nProper Clause forbids Congress from enacting legislation that intrudes on state\nsovereignty.\n\n      When a \"La[w] . . . for carrying into Execution\" the Commerce Clause\n      violates the principle of state sovereignty reflected in [the Constitution,]\n      it is not a \"La[w] . . . proper for carrying into Execution the Commerce\n      Clause,\" and is thus, in the words of The Federalist, \"merely [an] ac[t]\n      of usurpation\" which \"deserve[s] to be treated as such.\"\n\n\n                                          28\n\fId. (emphasis in original; internal citations omitted). Like Printz, Alden recognized\nthe word \"proper\" restricts the scope of legislative power. Alden continued the\nCourt's analysis of \"proper\" laws by rejecting the argument that the Necessary and\nProper Clause conferred authority on Congress to subject unconsenting states to suit\nin state court \"as a means of achieving objectives otherwise within the scope of the\nenumerated powers.\" 527 U.S. at 732.\n\n       The Court's analysis in Printz and Alden rested entirely upon the propriety of\na statute, not whether that statute was necessary. A law is \"proper,\" the Court\nmaintained, if it respects both the Constitution's limits on federal power and its grants\nof power to the states and the people. Printz, 521 U.S. at 918-22, 923-24. These\ncases teach us that a law is \"proper\" for the enforcement of an enumerated power only\nif it hews to constitutional principles of limited federal government and state\nsovereignty. Federal laws that usurp the traditional domain of state authority are\ntherefore not \"proper.\"\n\n        I believe § 666(a)(2) lies outside the guideposts erected in Printz and Alden for\nassessing a \"proper\" law. The statute intrudes upon state and local concerns by\nfederalizing anticorruption law, which is traditionally the domain of state and local\nlegislation. See United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349 (1971) (\"Congress has\ntraditionally been reluctant to define as a federal crime conduct readily denounced as\ncriminal by the States. This congressional policy is rooted in the same concepts of\nAmerican federalism that have provided the basis for judge-made doctrines. . . . [W]e\nwill not be quick to assume that Congress has meant to effect a significant change in\nthe sensitive relation between federal and state criminal jurisdiction.\") (internal\ncitations omitted) (cited in Lopez, 514 U.S. at 561 n.3). Section 666(a)(2) thereby\noffends the Constitution's basic limitations on federal power. The only possible\nrelationship between § 666(a)(2) and federal interests is the sum of $10,000 in federal\nbenefits received each year by state or local governments. There is scarcely any limit\nto this relationship, however. Even under a narrow view of \"federal benefits,\" Fischer\n\n                                           29\n\fv. United States, 529 U.S. 667, 681 (2000), it is beyond dispute that every state—and\nnearly every county, tribe and city—receives that sum in yearly federal benefits.\nMoreover, the statute requires no connection between those federal benefits and the\nbribe. The lack of any connection makes all too real the risk that federal\nanticorruption efforts will swamp state and local efforts to combat bribery.\n\n       The majority suggests the federal interest in punishing bribery of state and local\ngovernment officials is at least as great as the federal interest in punishing those who\nmisapply funds belonging to state banks. Westfall v. United States, 274 U.S. 256,\n258-59 (1927). But the statute in Westfall included an element establishing a federal\ninterest in every prosecution—the state bank had to be a member of the Federal\nReserve System. Misapplication of a bank's funds weakened the entire membership\nof the Reserve, so the Supreme Court could easily identify the federal interest in\nprotecting each bank's assets. Westfall therefore adds nothing to the majority's\nargument. If anything, Westfall proves my point: Congress cannot enact criminal\nlaws absent a quantifiable federal interest in punishment.\n\n        Both the majority and the Eleventh Circuit in United States v. Edgar, 304 F.3d\n1320, 1326 (11th Cir. 2002), sanction this federalization of anticorruption law. They\nall but admit that once the federal government provides $10,000 in yearly benefits to\na state or local government, the federal government obtains an ongoing interest in the\nentire structure and operations of state and local governments, and in the credibility\nand integrity of their agents. Congress may, in effect, regulate (in this case,\ncriminalize) many activities that tangentially threaten that structure, credibility or\nintegrity. The real-world effects are truly startling. It is now a federal crime for an\nauto mechanic to induce a public high school principal to hire him to teach shop class\nby offering free car repair. This federalization of anticorruption law erodes the\nConstitution's limits on federal power.\n\n\n\n\n                                           30\n\f       The majority's sweeping view of the Necessary and Proper Clause calls to mind\nCongress' unbounded deployment of its Commerce Clause authority before Lopez and\nMorrison. Both Lopez and Morrison curtailed federal power, forbidding Congress\nfrom piling \"inference upon inference\" to demonstrate a relationship between crimes\nand federal interests. Lopez, 514 U.S. at 566; Morrison, 529 U.S. at 615. I fear\nCongress relied upon similarly weak and attenuated inferences in enacting §\n666(a)(2). For many of the same concerns articulated in Lopez and Morrison, I am\ntroubled by the majority's efforts to interpret the Necessary and Proper Clause to\npermit the federalization of criminal laws. \"Were the Federal Government to take\nover the regulation of entire areas of traditional state concern, areas having nothing\nto do with the regulation of commercial activities, the boundaries between the spheres\nof federal and state authority would blur.\" Lopez, 514 U.S. at 577. This is precisely\nwhat makes § 666(a)(2) not \"proper.\"\n\n       I recognize, of course, § 666(a)(2) does not preempt state or local power to\npunish corruption. Even though § 666(a)(2) lacks preemptive effect, the sheer size\nand funding of the federal government's criminal justice machinery suggests the\npossibility of state and local anticorruption efforts dwindling. It blinks at reality to\nbelieve § 666(a)(2) does no more than provide an additional weapon in the\nanticorruption arsenal. By inserting itself into a domain traditionally reserved for\nstate and local prosecutions, the federal government treats state governments, for\nexample, not with the respect and dignity due them as \"residuary sovereigns and joint\nparticipants in the Nation's governance,\" Alden, 527 U.S. at 748-49, but as\nuntrustworthy organs incapable of policing their own. The development and\nenforcement of sound ethical standards, and of political accountability to citizens for\nfailing to do so, lies at the very heart of sovereignty. See Printz, 521 U.S. at 920\n(\"The Constitution thus contemplates that a State's government will represent and\nremain accountable to its own citizens.\"); New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144,\n168-69 (1992).\n\n\n\n                                          31\n\f       Section 666(a)(2) upsets the delicate balance between federal and state\nauthority that animates our Constitution. See id. at 921; Alden, 527 U.S. at 751.\n\"Congress has no more power to punish theft from the beneficiaries of its largesse\nthan it has to punish theft from anyone else. . . . The Constitution does not\ncontemplate that federal regulatory power should tag along after federal money like\na hungry dog.\" United States v. Morgan, 230 F.3d 1067, 1074 (8th Cir. 2000) (Bye,\nJ., specially concurring) (quoting David E. Engdahl, The Spending Power, 44 Duke\nL.J. 1, 92 (1994)).\n\n                                           III\n\n       I do not believe § 666(a)(2) validly \"carr[ies] into [e]xecution\" Congress'\nSpending Clause authority because the statute sweeps within its ambit a wide range\nof criminal activity bearing little or no relation to federal interests. I am not alone in\nthis view. Even the government disavowed reliance on the Necessary and Proper\nClause when the question first arose at oral argument. The government never urged\nour court to uphold § 666(a)(2) on the strength of Congress' Necessary and Proper\nClause power, and, when pressed, the government expressed considerable discomfort\nwith such a notion. For the reasons expressed above, I share the government's\ndiscomfort with this argument, and therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n             Attest:\n\n                     CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                           32\n\f",

During the spring and summer\nof 2001, Sabri was pursuing a commercial real estate project within the City's Eighth\nWard. From 1993 through July 2001, Brian Herron served on the City Council,\nrepresenting the Eighth Ward. He also served on the Board of Commissioners\noverseeing MCDA's budget. The government alleged that Sabri gave Herron $5000\nin an attempt to obtain Herron's assistance in receiving regulatory approval from the\nCity to commence the proposed real estate project; that Sabri offered Herron $10,000\nto threaten the current property owners that the City would use its powers of eminent\ndomain to take their property if they did not sell to Sabri; and that Sabri offered to\ngive Herron $80,000 as a 10% kickback in return for his assisting Sabri to obtain\n$800,000 in community economic development grants for the proposed real estate\nproject.\n\n      Sabri filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that § 666(a)(2)\nwas facially unconstitutional because it does not require the government to prove a\nnexus between the offense conduct–the offering of a bribe–and the federal funds.\nWithout such a \"jurisdictional hook,\" that is, a clause that purports to ensure that the\nlaw applies only to activity that falls within the federal lawmaking power, Sabri\nargued that the statute was outside Congress's legislative power.

We hold that § 666 contains no requirement\nthat the government prove some connection between the offense conduct and federal\nfunds beyond the express statutory requirement found in § 666(b) which requires\nproof that the relevant organization, government, or agency received benefits under\na federal program in excess of $10,000 in any one-year period.\n\n       The Supreme Court addressed this question of statutory construction in part in\nSalinas v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118151\"><a href=\"/opinion/118151/salinas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997). Salinas, a deputy sheriff who had\naccepted bribes in exchange for arranging \"contact visits\" between a federal prisoner\nhoused in the Hidalgo County jail and the prisoner's wife and girlfriend, argued that\n\"the Government must prove the bribe in some way affected federal funds, for\ninstance by diverting or misappropriating them\" before the statute was violated. Id.\nat 55. A unanimous Court rejected Salinas's argument, noting that the \"enactment's\n\n\nLopez Court's use of the word \"jurisdiction\" referred to the power of the Congress to\nenact legislation and not to the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.

The Foley Court reached the conclusion that § 666\nrequired the government to prove a connection between the bribe and the federal\nfunds only after finding the statute to be ambiguous and then turning to the legislative\nhistory to resolve that ambiguity. Foley, 73 F.3d at 489.\n\n        Despite the long-standing principle of statutory construction that the title of a\nstatute cannot control the plain language of the statute, the Third Circuit reasoned that\nthe title of § 666, \"Theft or bribery concerning programs receiving Federal funds,\"\nimplied that the statute contains a minimal nexus requirement.

It is clear to us that the plain text of the statute does not\nrequire any connection between the federal funds received by the agency and the\noffense conduct. The statute applies to all offense conduct involving anything of\nvalue of $5000 or more that involves \"any\" agency business, transaction, or series of\ntransactions so long as the relevant agency received the requisite amount of federal\nbenefits ($10,000) within the defined time period as required in § 666(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f         The argument that § 666 is unambiguous as to the narrow question answered\nin Salinas but ambiguous as to the broad question presented here is unpersuasive. “A\nstatute can be unambiguous without addressing every interpretive theory offered. . .\n. It need only be plain to anyone reading the Act that the statute encompasses the\nconduct at issue.\" Salinas, 522 U.S. at 60 (internal quotation omitted). Thus, while\nit is true that the Salinas Court held only that the government need not prove that the\noffense conduct directly affected federal funds, the Salinas Court's characterization\nof the operative terms of the statute as broad and unqualified supports our conclusion\nthat the statute is also unambiguous as to the broader question presented here. See\nSalinas, 522 U.S. at 56 (stating that \"[t]he enactment's expansive, unqualified\nlanguage\" does not support a limiting interpretation of the statute), 57 (\"The\nprohibition is not confined to a business or transaction which affects federal funds.\"),\n57 (\"Furthermore, the broad definition of the 'circumstances' to which the statute\napplies provides no textual basis for limiting the reach of the bribery prohibition.\"),\n57 (\"The statute applies to all cases in which an 'organization, government, or agency'\nreceives the statutory amount of benefits under a federal program.\"), 57 (\"The\nstatute's plain language fails to provide any basis for limiting § 666(a)(1)(B) to bribes\naffecting federal funds.\"). The Court reaffirmed this broad reading of § 666 in\nFischer v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118365\"><a href=\"/opinion/118365/fischer-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000). There, the court described § 666 as\n\"expansive, both as to the conduct forbidden and the entities covered.\" Id. at 678\n(internal quotations and alteration omitted).\n\n       The fact that the Salinas Court construed § 666(a)(1)(B) and that this case\ninvolves § 666(a)(2) makes no difference in our analysis. Section (a)(1) and section\n(a)(2) are complementary provisions: one section criminalizes the solicitation or\nacceptance of bribes while the other criminalizes the offering or giving of bribes.\nBoth provisions, however, prohibit bribery in connection with \"any business,\ntransaction, or series of transactions\" of organizations which receive the requisite\namount of federal benefits required in subsection (b). Neither provision suggests that\nthe business or transaction in question must somehow implicate a federal program.\n\n                                           9\n\fFor the point under consideration here, the relevant terms of the two sections are\nidentical. Therefore, relying on the text of the statute and the Supreme Court's\ncharacterization of the operative language in the statute as broad and unqualified, we\nconclude that § 666 is unambiguous as to the question presented here.\n\n       Generally, where the text of a statute is unambiguous, the statute should be\nenforced as written, McIntosh, 236 F.3d at 972, and \"[o]nly the most extraordinary\nshowing of contrary intentions in the legislative history will justify a departure from\nthat language,\" United States v.

In addition, in Fischer, the Court resolved another\nissue of statutory construction arising under § 666, and no member of the Court\nsuggested that the statute might be constitutionally infirm. We think it ill-advised to\nnow declare that § 666 is void ab initio as being outside of Congress's legislative\ndomain after the Supreme Court has twice indicated that the statute can be\nconstitutional as applied. With that thought in mind, we look beyond the Spending\nClause to other provisions of the Constitution which may or may not provide legal\nauthority to sustain § 666.\n\n                                           17\n\f         So that the Constitution \"be not a splendid bauble,\" the framers of our\ngovernment inserted the Necessary and Proper Clause into the Constitution to\n\"remove all doubts respecting the right to legislate on that vast mass of incidental\npowers which must be involved in the constitution.\" M'Culloch v.

Both the Spending Power and the Necessary and Proper Clause are\ncontained in section 8 of the first Article, and the Necessary and Proper Clause\napplies to the spending power, enabling Congress to enact all laws which are\nconvenient to the exercise of disbursing federal funds.

We\nrecognize that the Necessary and Proper Clause does not confer upon the Congress\na broad police power.

See Alden, 527 U.S. at 712 (\"We hold that the\npowers delegated to Congress under Article I of the United States Constitution do not\ninclude the power to subject nonconsenting States to private suits for damages in state\ncourts.\"); Printz, 521 U.S. at 935 (holding that Congress cannot compel State officers\nto administer federal regulatory program); New York, 505 U.S. at 149 (holding that\nConstitution does not confer upon Congress the power to compel the States to enact\na regulatory program). These cases merely recognize the larger constitutional\nprinciple that \"the Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers upon Congress\nthe power to regulate individuals, not States,\" and that \"where Congress has the\nauthority under the Constitution to pass laws requiring or prohibiting certain acts it\nlacks the power directly to compel the States to require or prohibit those acts.\" New\nYork, 505 U.S. at 166; accord Alden, 527 U.S. at 714; Printz, 521 U.S. at 919-20.\nNone of these cases addresses the question presented here: whether Congress has the\n                                             19\n\fmeans plainly adapted to achieving Congress's end. The resolution of this inquiry\nraises two subsidiary questions: (1) whether Congress has the power to enact criminal\nlegislation pursuant to the Necessary and Proper Clause, and if so, (2) whether § 666\nis plainly adapted, i.e., rationally related, to achieving Congress's end.\n\n      As to the first question, we have no doubt that the creation of a general criminal\nlaw incident to a constitutional end is within the sovereign power of the federal\ngovernment. M'Culloch, 17 U.S. at 418 (\"The good sense of the public has\npronounced, without hesitation, that the power of punishment appertains to\nsovereignty, and may be exercised, whenever the sovereign has a right to act, as\nincidental to his constitutional powers.\"). Chief Justice Marshall provided concrete\nexamples of the scope of this power in M'Culloch:\n\n      Take, for example, the power 'to establish post-offices and post-roads.'\n      This power is executed, by the single act of making the establishment.\n      But, from this has been inferred the power and duty of carrying the mail\n      along the post-road, from one post-office to another. And from this\n      implied power, has again been inferred the right to punish those who\n      steal letters from the post-office, or rob the mail. . . . This right is indeed\n      essential to the beneficial exercise of the power, but not indispensably\n      necessary to its existence. So, of the punishment of the crimes of\n      stealing or falsifying a record or process of a court of the United States,\n      or of perjury in such court. To punish these offences, is certainly\n      conducive to the due administration of justice.\n\nId. at 417. More recently, our court has recognized that Congress has the authority\nto pass a criminal law of general application pursuant to the Necessary and Proper\n\n\nauthority to regulate the conduct of individuals, not States, who deal with\norganizations that receive federal benefits. Because there has been no clear signal\nfrom the Supreme Court that there are independent federalism-based limits on the\npower of Congress to regulate the conduct of individuals, we conclude that this\nstatute is \"proper\" and does not contravene the letter or spirit of the Constitution.\n                                            20\n\fClause.

These authorities demonstrate that Congress\nhas the authority to enact general criminal legislation incident to its specifically\nenumerated powers.\n\n       As to the more specific question, we conclude that § 666 is a means plainly\nadapted, i.e., rationally related, to achieving the efficacious expenditure of federal\nfunds and is, therefore, a law necessary and proper to the execution of the spending\npower. In M'Culloch, Chief Justice Marshall determined that \"necessary\" had an\nexpansive meaning. The Clause does not restrain Congress's choice of means to only\nthose means that are absolutely or indispensably necessary to the exercise of its\npowers. Rather, the Necessary and Proper Clause allows Congress to exercise its\ndiscretion in choosing particular means that may not be \"necessary\" in the strict sense\nof the word, but instead are convenient or conducive to the exercise of its powers.\nThe Legal Tender Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91050\"><a href=\"/opinion/91050/juilliard-v-greenman/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 441 (1884) (\"Where various systems might\nbe adopted . . . , it might be said, with respect to each, that it was not necessary,\nbecause the end might be obtained by other means. Congress must possess the choice\nof means, and must be empowered to use any means which are in fact conducive to\nthe exercise of a power granted by the constitution.\"); M'Culloch, 17 U.S. at 420.\nThus, Chief Justice Marshall, relying on his expansive interpretation of \"necessary,\"\nconcluded that the power to establish post offices and post roads included the power\nto establish criminal penalties for interfering with the mail. Likewise, he concluded\nthat the federal government could incorporate a National Bank even though that\n\n                                          21\n\fpower is not enumerated in Article I. Chief Justice Marshall concluded that these so-\ncalled \"implied powers\" were constitutional exercises of the sovereign power because\neach reasonably advanced an enumerated power. M'Culloch thus teaches us that\nCongress may use means which are unspecified in the text of the constitution to\nachieve enumerated ends where there is a rational relationship between the means and\nthe ends. Here, we know the end is the efficacious disbursement of federal funds. To\ndetermine whether § 666 is rationally related to that end we must look to Congress's\nintent in passing the law and the specific mechanisms by which § 666 hopes to\nachieve the desired end.\n\n       As we have discussed above, § 666 was designed to protect the integrity of the\nvast sums of federal monies disbursed through federal programs. Section 666 could\nhave been more narrowly crafted to more directly advance this goal, for example, by\ncriminalizing the theft of the federal funds themselves while in the hands of the\nrecipient, or by requiring a direct nexus between the offense conduct and a federal\nprogram, but \"[t]he Constitution has never been regarded as denying to the Congress\nthe necessary resources of flexibility and practicality to perform its function.\" Yakus\nv. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103950\"><a href=\"/opinion/103950/yakus-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 425 (1944) (internal quotation and alteration omitted).\nHere, Congress has made a determination that the most effective way to protect the\nintegrity of federal funds is to police the integrity of the agencies administering those\nfunds. As discussed in Part II, a more limited statutory scheme was rendered\ntoothless because of the difficulty of tracing federal funds once they had been\ndisbursed. In addition, we note that \"money is fungible and its effect transcends\nprogram boundaries.\" Grossi, 143 F.3d at 350. The maladministration of funds in\none part of an agency can affect the allocation of funds, whether federal or local in\norigin, throughout an entire agency. Thus, to suggest that corruption involving a\ndiscrete department or section of an agency that does not itself receive federal funds\nor administer a federal program can have no effect on the integrity or efficacy of a\nfederal program is to ignore the fact that money is fungible and that federal funds are\noften comingled with funds from other sources. Section 666 addresses this problem\n\n                                           22\n\fby policing the integrity of the entire organization that receives federal benefits. In\nsustaining the constitutionality of § 666 under the Necessary and Proper Clause , the\nEleventh Circuit recently has come to the same conclusion. See Edgar, 304 F.3d at\n1327 (\"It is reasonable for Congress to conclude that any corruption of such recipient\norganizations, regardless of whether the corruption involves the misappropriation of\nspecifically federal funds, endangers the comprehensive programs in which the\norganizations participate, and thus the effective exercise of the Congressional\nspending power as well.\").\n\n      The Court has approved this type of indirect enforcement mechanism in\nanother context. In Westfall v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101082\"><a href=\"/opinion/101082/westfall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1927), the Supreme\nCourt affirmed the constitutionality of the Federal Reserve Act, 38 Stat. 259, as\namended, 40 Stat. 232, which made it a crime to misapply the funds of a State bank\nthat was a member of the Federal Reserve System. The reasoning of the Court is\npersuasive on the issue presented in this case:\n\n      The argument is that Congress has no power to punish offences against\n      the property rights of State banks. It is said that the statute is so broad\n      that it covers such offenses when they could not result in any loss to the\n      Federal Reserve Banks. . . . [I]f a State bank chooses to come into the\n      System created by the United States, the United States may punish acts\n      injurious to the System, although done to a corporation that the State\n      also is entitled to protect. . . . That there is such a System and that the\n      Reserve Banks are interested in the solvency and financial condition of\n      the members also is too obvious to require a repetition of the careful\n      analysis presented by the Solicitor General. The only suggestion that\n      may deserve a word is that the statute applies indifferently whether there\n      is a loss to the Reserve Banks or not. But every fraud like the one before\n      us weakens the member bank and therefore weakens the System.\n      Moreover, when it is necessary in order to prevent an evil to make the\n      law embrace more than the precise thing to be prevented it may do so.\n\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fId. at 258-59 (internal citations omitted). As in Westfall, the government here has an\ninterest in ensuring that the system of subnational agencies that administer federal\nfunds remains strong even where there is not a direct loss to the federal funds\nthemselves. Congress could well have determined that an agency official who is\nwilling to take a bribe in the disbursements of nonfederal program money is not a\nperson who should be entrusted with federal program funds either.\n\n       Any concern that we may have had regarding the scope of this law is allayed\nby the statute itself. The statute is self-limiting to ensure that \"federal regulatory\npower [does not] tag along after federal money like a hungry dog.\" Morgan, 230 F.3d\nat 1074 (Bye, J., concurring) (internal quotations and emphasis omitted). Section\n666(b) is a jurisdictional provision that ensures in each particular case that the federal\npower will be exercised only where the federal government has a substantial interest\nat stake and where substantial federal funds may be at risk. See Fischer, 529 U.S. at\n689 n.3 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\"Title 18 U.S.C. § 666(b) is, after all, a\njurisdictional provision that allows federal prosecution only if the specific\norganization at issue received more than $10,000 in 'benefits.'\"), id. at 690 n.3\n(\"Without a jurisdiction provision that would ensure that in each case the exercise of\nfederal power is related to the federal interest in a federal program, § 666 would\ncriminalize routine acts of fraud or bribery.\"). The $10,000 threshold requirement\nand the $5000 transactional requirement create a sufficient nexus between the offense\nconduct and federal funds to ensure that federal power will not be extended to the\nprosecution of merely local matters that may not jeopardize in any significant manner\nthe integrity of federal programs.\n\n       More importantly, were we to conclude that Congress lacked the authority to\nlegislate in this area, then the protection of federal funds would be left to the whim\nof state and local officials–perhaps even the same officials who pose a threat to the\nintegrity of the federal funds in the first place and who therefore possess a strong\n\n\n\n                                           24\n\fdisincentive to protect them. The proposition that the federal government is\npowerless to vindicate its own interests is clearly untenable:\n\n      \"The government of the Union, though limited in its powers, is supreme\n      within its sphere of action. No trace is to be found in the constitution of\n      an intention to create a dependence of the government of the Union on\n      those of the states, for the execution of the great powers assigned to it.\n      Its means are adequate to its ends; and on those means alone was it\n      expected to rely for the accomplishment of its ends. To impose on it the\n      necessity of resorting to means which it cannot control, which another\n      government may furnish or withhold, would render its course\n      precarious, the result of its measures uncertain, and create a dependence\n      on other governments, which might disappoint its most important\n      designs, and is incompatible with the language of the constitution.\"\n\nLogan v.

However, when Congress\nseeks to punish conduct with no connection to federal interests, conduct traditionally\npunished only by state and local governments exercising their general police powers,\nCongress exceeds its constitutional authority. The statute we review today, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 666(a)(2), punishes a broad swath of conduct bearing little relationship to any\nfederal interest. It establishes federal criminal liability for those who bribe state and\nlocal government officials, provided only that the government receives $10,000 per\nyear in federal program benefits. Id. § 666(a)(2), 666(b). A briber need not handle,\nmanage, administer or supervise the receipt or disbursement of federal funds, and the\npurpose of the bribe need not relate to federal program benefits. It is therefore\nlogically and legally untenable to assert a federal interest in punishing these bribers.\n\n       In my view, the majority's decision to uphold § 666(a)(2) despite this infirmity\nswims against the tide of governing law.

These decisions guide my\nreview of § 666(a)(2) and require my respectful dissent.\n\n                                            I\n\n      I do agree with the majority in one important respect: section 666(a)(2) cannot\nbe justified solely as an exercise of Congress' Spending Clause authority. The\nmajority properly rests this holding upon the absence of any statutory link between\nthe bribe and the state or local government's receipt or use of federal benefits.\nBecause § 666(a)(2) does not link the bribe to federal benefits, the statute\n\n                                           26\n\fencompasses and punishes conduct well beyond Congress' ability to \"provide for the\n. . . general Welfare of the United States.\" U.S. Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 1. Indeed, the\nstatute's breadth leads to absurd results: only by injecting a new element into the\nstatute can a court forestall the conviction of a person who bribes the city meat\ninspector while the city parks department receives $10,000 in federal benefits. See\nUnited States v. Santopietro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760946\"><a href=\"/opinion/760946/united-states-of-america-appellant-cross-appellee-v-joseph-j-santopietro/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 93 (2d Cir. 1999). The majority wisely\nrejects the supposed Spending Clause moorings of § 666(a)(2).\n\n       Had the majority stopped at this point, I would have joined its opinion. The\nmajority continues onward, however, reaching beyond its Spending Clause analysis\nand \"resort[ing] to the last, best hope of those who defend ultra vires congressional\naction, the Necessary and Proper Clause.\" Printz, 521 U.S. at 923. The majority\napparently casts aside its earlier qualm that § 666(a)(2) requires no connection\nbetween the bribe and federal benefits. The majority instead perceives a bare,\n\"rational relationship\" between punishing bribers and maintaining the integrity of\nfederal programs, and on that basis declares the Necessary and Proper Clause a proper\nfont of congressional authority. This may be correct, but it answers only half the\nquestion we must decide.\n\n                                           II\n\n      In my view, the principal defect in the majority opinion is its inattention to the\nconjunctive \"and\" that separates the words \"necessary and proper.\" The majority\nadvances several arguments suggesting § 666(a)(2) is \"necessary,\" in the sense\nenvisioned in M'Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 420-21 (1819). But\nthe majority fails to ask—let alone resolve—whether the statute is also \"proper.\"\nThis is not merely a semantic dispute, for in Printz and Alden the Supreme Court\nadvanced an interpretation of \"proper\" that calls into question the constitutionality of\nfederal statutes that trespass upon the domain of state and local legislative power.\nSection 666(a)(2) is one such statute.\n\n                                          27\n\f       M'Culloch holds that Congress enjoys broad powers to select the means of\nenacting its objectives. Id. at 421. Thus, in determining whether a law is \"necessary,\"\ncourts must review Congress' law-making efforts with considerable deference. The\nmajority describes this deference in terms of rationality: courts may not demand of\nCongress anything more than a rational relationship between its chosen means and\nends. This reading of M'Culloch is, of course, received wisdom. Applying\nM'Culloch in this fashion, the majority makes a fairly convincing argument that the\n\"fit\" between § 666(a)(2) and Congress' underlying objective to preserve the integrity\nof federal programs is rational. However, because there is a rational relationship\nbetween Congress' aim and the law it enacted, under M'Culloch, the law is\n\"necessary.\" But M'Culloch says very little, if anything, about what makes a law\n\"proper.\" That specific question largely evaded the Court's attention until Printz and\nAlden.\n\n       Printz began bridging this doctrinal gap by drawing upon a law review article\nthat develops a legal and historical distinction between \"necessary\" laws and \"proper\"\nones. Gary Lawson & Patricia B. Granger, The \"Proper\" Scope of Federal Power: A\nJurisdictional Interpretation of the Sweeping Clause, 43 Duke L.J. 267 (1993). Printz\nrejected the argument that Congress could commandeer state officials to implement\ncertain federal mandates by using its Necessary and Proper Clause power to effectuate\nits Commerce Clause authority. 521 U.S. at 923-24. Relying solely on its\nunderstanding of what constitutes a \"proper\" law, the Court held the Necessary and\nProper Clause forbids Congress from enacting legislation that intrudes on state\nsovereignty.\n\n      When a \"La[w] . . . for carrying into Execution\" the Commerce Clause\n      violates the principle of state sovereignty reflected in [the Constitution,]\n      it is not a \"La[w] . . . proper for carrying into Execution the Commerce\n      Clause,\" and is thus, in the words of The Federalist, \"merely [an] ac[t]\n      of usurpation\" which \"deserve[s] to be treated as such.\"\n\n\n                                          28\n\fId. (emphasis in original; internal citations omitted). Like Printz, Alden recognized\nthe word \"proper\" restricts the scope of legislative power. Alden continued the\nCourt's analysis of \"proper\" laws by rejecting the argument that the Necessary and\nProper Clause conferred authority on Congress to subject unconsenting states to suit\nin state court \"as a means of achieving objectives otherwise within the scope of the\nenumerated powers.\" 527 U.S. at 732.\n\n       The Court's analysis in Printz and Alden rested entirely upon the propriety of\na statute, not whether that statute was necessary. A law is \"proper,\" the Court\nmaintained, if it respects both the Constitution's limits on federal power and its grants\nof power to the states and the people. Printz, 521 U.S. at 918-22, 923-24. These\ncases teach us that a law is \"proper\" for the enforcement of an enumerated power only\nif it hews to constitutional principles of limited federal government and state\nsovereignty. Federal laws that usurp the traditional domain of state authority are\ntherefore not \"proper.\"\n\n        I believe § 666(a)(2) lies outside the guideposts erected in Printz and Alden for\nassessing a \"proper\" law. The statute intrudes upon state and local concerns by\nfederalizing anticorruption law, which is traditionally the domain of state and local\nlegislation. See United States v. Bass, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108421\"><a href=\"/opinion/108421/united-states-v-bass/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 349 (1971) (\"Congress has\ntraditionally been reluctant to define as a federal crime conduct readily denounced as\ncriminal by the States.

Section 666(a)(2) thereby\noffends the Constitution's basic limitations on federal power. The only possible\nrelationship between § 666(a)(2) and federal interests is the sum of $10,000 in federal\nbenefits received each year by state or local governments. There is scarcely any limit\nto this relationship, however. Even under a narrow view of \"federal benefits,\" Fischer\n\n                                           29\n\fv.

But the statute in Westfall included an element establishing a federal\ninterest in every prosecution—the state bank had to be a member of the Federal\nReserve System. Misapplication of a bank's funds weakened the entire membership\nof the Reserve, so the Supreme Court could easily identify the federal interest in\nprotecting each bank's assets. Westfall therefore adds nothing to the majority's\nargument. If anything, Westfall proves my point: Congress cannot enact criminal\nlaws absent a quantifiable federal interest in punishment.\n\n        Both the majority and the Eleventh Circuit in United States v. Edgar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"75989\"><a href=\"/opinion/75989/united-states-v-daniel-m-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1326 (11th Cir. 2002), sanction this federalization of anticorruption law. They\nall but admit that once the federal government provides $10,000 in yearly benefits to\na state or local government, the federal government obtains an ongoing interest in the\nentire structure and operations of state and local governments, and in the credibility\nand integrity of their agents. Congress may, in effect, regulate (in this case,\ncriminalize) many activities that tangentially threaten that structure, credibility or\nintegrity. The real-world effects are truly startling. It is now a federal crime for an\nauto mechanic to induce a public high school principal to hire him to teach shop class\nby offering free car repair. This federalization of anticorruption law erodes the\nConstitution's limits on federal power.\n\n\n\n\n                                           30\n\f       The majority's sweeping view of the Necessary and Proper Clause calls to mind\nCongress' unbounded deployment of its Commerce Clause authority before Lopez and\nMorrison. Both Lopez and Morrison curtailed federal power, forbidding Congress\nfrom piling \"inference upon inference\" to demonstrate a relationship between crimes\nand federal interests. Lopez, 514 U.S. at 566; Morrison, 529 U.S. at 615. I fear\nCongress relied upon similarly weak and attenuated inferences in enacting §\n666(a)(2). For many of the same concerns articulated in Lopez and Morrison, I am\ntroubled by the majority's efforts to interpret the Necessary and Proper Clause to\npermit the federalization of criminal laws. \"Were the Federal Government to take\nover the regulation of entire areas of traditional state concern, areas having nothing\nto do with the regulation of commercial activities, the boundaries between the spheres\nof federal and state authority would blur.\" Lopez, 514 U.S. at 577. This is precisely\nwhat makes § 666(a)(2) not \"proper.\"\n\n       I recognize, of course, § 666(a)(2) does not preempt state or local power to\npunish corruption. Even though § 666(a)(2) lacks preemptive effect, the sheer size\nand funding of the federal government's criminal justice machinery suggests the\npossibility of state and local anticorruption efforts dwindling. It blinks at reality to\nbelieve § 666(a)(2) does no more than provide an additional weapon in the\nanticorruption arsenal. By inserting itself into a domain traditionally reserved for\nstate and local prosecutions, the federal government treats state governments, for\nexample, not with the respect and dignity due them as \"residuary sovereigns and joint\nparticipants in the Nation's governance,\" Alden, 527 U.S. at 748-49, but as\nuntrustworthy organs incapable of policing their own. The development and\nenforcement of sound ethical standards, and of political accountability to citizens for\nfailing to do so, lies at the very heart of sovereignty. See Printz, 521 U.S. at 920\n(\"The Constitution thus contemplates that a State's government will represent and\nremain accountable to its own citizens.\"); New York v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112768\"><a href=\"/opinion/112768/new-york-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n168-69 (1992).\n\n\n\n                                          31\n\f       Section 666(a)(2) upsets the delicate balance between federal and state\nauthority that animates our Constitution. See id. at 921; Alden, 527 U.S. at 751.\n\"Congress has no more power to punish theft from the beneficiaries of its largesse\nthan it has to punish theft from anyone else. . . .

I am not alone in\nthis view. Even the government disavowed reliance on the Necessary and Proper\nClause when the question first arose at oral argument. The government never urged\nour court to uphold § 666(a)(2) on the strength of Congress' Necessary and Proper\nClause power, and, when pressed, the government expressed considerable discomfort\nwith such a notion. For the reasons expressed above, I share the government's\ndiscomfort with this argument, and therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n             Attest:\n\n                     CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                           32\n\f</pre>",
