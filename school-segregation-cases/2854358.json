Anthony Riccardo, an\ninmate of the Centralia Correctional Center in Illinois,\nneeded a new cellmate after his former cellmate complained\nabout being housed with him. Normally that pairing would\nhave been made by Centralia’s placement office, but when\nthe evening of May 28, 1997, arrived and some inmates\nremained unassigned after the regular placement officers\nhad left, the task fell to Lt. Larry Rausch, who was serving\nthe second shift. Rausch matched Riccardo with Juan\n\f2                                                No. 02-1961\n\nGarcia, a pairing that should have lasted only until the\nplacement officers on the day shift could review matters.\nTwo days later Garcia sexually assaulted Riccardo, who\nsued Rausch under 42 U.S.C. §1983. A jury concluded that\nRausch had subjected Riccardo to cruel and unusual\npunishment and awarded $1.5 million in compensatory\ndamages. The district court entered judgment on this ver-\ndict, and Rausch appeals.\n  His lead-off argument is that Riccardo failed to use his\nadministrative remedies. If so, then 42 U.S.C. §1997e(a),\npart of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, forecloses this suit\neven though Riccardo challenges a discrete incident and\nwants a form of relief—money damages—that the ad-\nministrative process in Illinois does not provide. See Porter\nv. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002); Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S.\n731 (2001). Riccardo did file an administrative grievance,\nbut Rausch contends it was too late (in February 1998,\nwhile Illinois sets a limit of six months) and asked the state\nto prosecute Garcia rather than do anything about Rausch\nand the classification system.\n   Prisoners must follow state rules about the time and\ncontent of grievances. See Pozo v. McCaughtry, 286 F.3d\n1022 (7th Cir. 2002); Strong v. David, 297 F.3d 646 (7th Cir.\n2002). Failure to do this means failure to use (and thus to\nexhaust) available remedies. Yet the state’s administrative\napparatus did not reject Riccardo’s grievance as untimely;\nit accepted and denied the grievance on the merits. At the\ntime of these events, Illinois permitted a filing after six\nmonths when the prisoner had good cause, see 20 Ill.\nAdmin. Code §504.810 (1997). The official handling the\ngrievance must have found good cause; anyway, we held\nin Pozo that, when a state treats a filing as timely and\nresolves it on the merits, the federal judiciary will not\nsecond-guess that action, for the grievance has served its\nfunction of alerting the state and inviting corrective action.\n286 F.3d at 1025.\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                 3\n\n  As for the content of this grievance: true enough, its main\nobjective was to have Garcia prosecuted. (Riccardo deemed\ninadequate Garcia’s punishment within the prison system.)\nBut it also at least hinted at problems in prison administra-\ntion. Riccardo wrote: “[T]he administration don’t [sic] do\nthere [sic] job. [A sexual assault] should’ve never [sic]\nhappen again.” This language is ambiguous. There are two\nprincipal ways to reduce the number of sexual assaults in\nprison: better steps ex ante to separate potential aggressors\nfrom potential victims; and harsher penalties ex post in\norder to deter future assaults. Riccardo did not distinguish\nbetween the two, and a prison administration receiving\nsuch a grievance should have considered both. Illinois has\nnot adopted any rule governing the level of detail required\nof prisoners’ grievances. “When the administrative rulebook\nis silent, a grievance suffices if it alerts the prison to the\nnature of the wrong for which redress is sought. As in a\nnotice-pleading system, the grievant need not lay out the\nfacts, articulate legal theories, or demand particular relief.\nAll the grievance need do is object intelligibly to some\nasserted shortcoming.” Strong, 297 F.3d at 650. The\ndocument that Riccardo filed is at the border of intelligibil-\nity; it is hard to imagine much less that a prisoner could do\nand still alert the prison; yet this grievance did complain\nthat Garcia had committed a rape and that “the administra-\ntion don’t do there job.” A generous construction of this\ngrievance would have induced the prison to consider the\npossibility that the guards could have prevented this\nassault. So we conclude that Riccardo exhausted the\nadministrative process. If Illinois wants grievances to be\nmore detailed, it must adopt appropriate regulations and\ninform prisoners what is required of them. Riccardo is\nentitled to a decision on the merits of his constitutional\nclaim.\n  Because Riccardo prevailed at trial, we recap the facts\nin the light most favorable to his position. Riccardo was\n\f4                                              No. 02-1961\n\nanally raped by his cellmate at Cook County Jail, shortly\nafter his conviction for aggravated assault. When he arrived\nat Centralia Correctional Center in November 1996, he told\nthe prison psychologist that he did not feel safe. After a\nstint in segregation for violating prison rules, Riccardo\ndeclined to return to the general population. He told guards\nthat a cellmate in the segregation unit had stolen some of\nhis property and objected to spending another day with that\ncellmate. He believed that the responsible inmate belonged\nto the Latin Kings gang and that the Latin Kings may have\nbeen preparing to kill him—though he did not say why he\nbelieved this. But Centralia allows inmates to veto housing\nwith persons they declare to be enemies, so the prison found\nRiccardo a new cellmate. When, after a few days, that\ncellmate objected to spending more time with Riccardo,\nanother pairing was required. (The segregation unit was too\ncrowded to permit Riccardo a cell of his own.)\n   During the afternoon of May 28, Garcia had offered to\nhelp Riccardo retrieve his stolen property. Riccardo took\nthis as an ill omen rather than as a genuine offer of assis-\ntance and told Lt. Alemond that he feared for his life if\ncelled with Garcia. Although Alemond said that he would\n“take care of it,” he did nothing—he did not either find a\ncellmate for Riccardo or alert Lt. Rausch, Alemond’s\nreplacement on the next shift. About 9:30 that evening,\nRausch brought Garcia to Riccardo’s cell and told him that\nGarcia was his new cellmate. Before the cells were locked\nfor the night, Riccardo sought out Rausch in private and\ntold him that he believed that the Latin Kings had a “hit”\nout on him, and that he feared for his life if celled with\nGarcia. Rausch replied that there was no place else to put\nGarcia (or Riccardo) that evening, and that he could not\nrefuse housing while in segregation. Rausch then brought\nRiccardo and Garcia back together and asked each, in turn,\nif he had a problem with the other. Riccardo shook his head\nin the negative. Rausch took that as agreement to the\n\fNo. 02-1961                                               5\n\nassignment. That was Riccardo’s last contact with Rausch.\nAs we have mentioned, nothing untoward happened that\nevening or the next, but during the evening of May 30\nGarcia compelled Riccardo to perform oral sex. The record\ndoes not suggest that this assault had any connection to the\nLatin Kings. During the time between assignment and\nassault, Riccardo did not ask for a different cellmate\n(though he did file two grievances on May 29 about other\nmatters). Circumstances brought out at trial suggest that\nother guards should have recognized on May 30 that\nproblems had developed between Riccardo and Garcia; their\nfailure to intervene may be culpable but cannot be attrib-\nuted to Rausch, whose liability depends exclusively on his\nactions the evening of May 28.\n  Rausch did not assault Riccardo and is not vicariously\nliable for Garcia’s crime. Like other guards, however,\nRausch was required to refrain from placing Riccardo in\nharm’s way gratuitously. The qualification “gratuitously” is\nimportant, because prisons are dangerous places. Inmates\nget there by violent acts, and many prisoners have a\npropensity to commit more. Guards cannot turn away\npersons committed by the courts; nor do individual guards\nhave any control over crowding and other systemic circum-\nstances. All that can be expected is that guards act re-\nsponsibly under the circumstances that confront them. See\nMcGill v. Duckworth, 944 F.2d 344 (7th Cir. 1991). A guard\nmay be responsible without being credulous. Some prison-\ners are manipulative and cry “wolf” in an effort to have a\ncell to themselves or choose a favored cellmate. Other\nprisoners perceive specters in every shadow, even though\ntheir fears are unsupported. (There is, for example, no\nreason to think that the Latin Kings ever had it in for\nRiccardo. He did not belong to a rival gang, and there is no\nhistory of violent or overtly hostile encounters between\nRiccardo and any gang member.) Guards therefore must\ndiscriminate between serious risks of harm and feigned or\n\f6                                                No. 02-1961\n\nimagined ones, which is not an easy task given the brief\ntime and scant information available to make each of the\nmany decisions that fill every day’s work.\n  The eighth amendment does not demand that guards\nperform this task flawlessly. It does not even hold them to\nthe negligence standard. Liability is possible, instead, only\nwhen a guard is deliberately indifferent to a substantial\nrisk of serious harm. See Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S.\n25 (1993); Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294 (1991); Estelle v.\nGamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976). “Deliberate indifference” means\nsubjective awareness. See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825\n(1994). It is not enough, the Court held in Farmer, that the\nguard ought to have recognized the risk. Instead, “the\nofficial must both be aware of facts from which the infer-\nence could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm\nexists, and he must also draw the inference.” Id. at 837.\n  Rausch contends that Riccardo did not face a “substantial\nrisk of serious harm” from Garcia on the evening of May 28,\n1997; that, if such a risk was present, Rausch did not\nappreciate its existence; and that at all events he is entitled\nto qualified immunity because reasonable officers would not\nnecessarily have understood that the law clearly required\nRiccardo and Garcia to be in separate cells. The first two\nmatters (the objective and subjective components of the\neighth amendment) are for the jury in the first instance,\nwith appellate review limited to the question whether any\nreasonable juror could have found that the requisite level of\nrisk existed, and that Rausch knew it. Immunity, however,\nis a matter of law for the court, to be decided without\ndeference to the jury’s resolution—and preferably before the\ncase goes to the jury. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202\n(2001); Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635 (1987). The\ndistrict court brushed aside Rausch’s invocation of immu-\nnity, writing that a guard cannot benefit from immunity if\nthe action taken was not a reasonable response to a risk\nactually foreseen. That approach, which merges immunity\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                    7\n\nand the merits, is incompatible with Saucier and its\npredecessors. See 533 U.S. at 203-06. Immunity protects\nofficials who act at the “hazy border” (id. at 206) between\nthe lawful and the forbidden. That Rausch may have\noverstepped the line does not mean that every reasonable\nofficer would have been bound to know that Rausch acted\nimproperly. We need not pursue the immunity defense,\nhowever, because Saucier calls on appellate courts to\naddress the merits first, see id. at 201, and Rausch is\nentitled to prevail outright: no reasonable juror could have\nconcluded, on this record, that Rausch actually recognized\nthat placing Garcia and Riccardo together exposed Riccardo\nto substantial risk.\n  Now it might seem that Rausch had to appreciate the\nrisk, because (a) Riccardo claimed to fear for his life if celled\nwith any member of the Latin Kings, and (b) Garcia in fact\nharmed Riccardo. One problem with relying on how things\nturned out to show knowledge of risk beforehand is that\nGarcia did not act for the Latin Kings; he told Riccardo that\nhe was fulfilling a personal fantasy, and Riccardo believed\nthis explanation. Thus the risk that Riccardo professed to\nfear (a “hit”) did not come to pass. Even under the law of\nnegligence, this is an important distinction. If a school\ndistrict entrusts a bus to a driver with a bad drinking\nrecord, and the tipsy driver runs the bus off the road while\nspeeding, the school district is liable; but if instead there is\nan accident for which the driver is not at fault (a tree falls\non bus), or the driver collapses of a heart attack while on\nthe road, the district is not liable, because that was not the\ntype of risk created or increased by the negligent conduct\neven though hiring this particular driver was in the causal\nchain. See, e.g., Berry v. Sugar Notch Borough, 191 Pa. 345,\n43 A. 240 (1899). The risk from which Riccardo sought\nprotection was not realized; for all this record shows, the\n(objectively evaluated) risk to Riccardo of sharing a cell\nwith Garcia was no greater than the risk of sharing a cell\nwith any other prisoner.\n\f8                                                No. 02-1961\n\n  As for Rausch’s subjective assessment: though Riccardo\ninitially asserted mortal fear, when later asked whether\nhe “had a problem” with Garcia he shook his head to give a\nnegative answer. Rausch then had to decide which state-\nment to believe. Riccardo argues, and the jury evidently\nconcluded, that Rausch should have believed the first\nstatement, communicated in private, rather than the sec-\nond, communicated in Garcia’s presence. A rational jury\ncould have thought that guards should give priority to\nstatements made in private. (Rausch testified that, if\nRiccardo had claimed to “have a problem” with Garcia, they\nwould have been separated; but Riccardo might have feared\nthe consequences in a later encounter in the prison’s\ngeneral population.) Still, what Rausch should have\nbelieved is not the right question; we need to know what he\ndid believe. No reasonable jury could have found, in light of\nRiccardo’s denial of “a problem” with Garcia and Rausch’s\ndecision to act accordingly, that Rausch subjectively\nappreciated that his action would expose Riccardo to a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm.\n  As we have already explained, prisoners may object to\npotential cellmates in an effort to manipulate assignments,\nor out of ignorance; thus although a protest may demon-\nstrate risk it does not necessarily do so. The Constitution\ndoes not oblige guards to believe whatever inmates say.\nHow does a reasonable guard separate fact from fiction?\nRausch knew when making the assignment at least two\nthings beyond Riccardo’s contradictory assertions. First,\nRausch knew that Garcia was himself in segregation for\nprotection from the Latin Kings (or at least a subset of\nthem). Perhaps Garcia was manipulating the system him-\nself, falsely asserting to fear the Latin Kings so that he\ncould serve as their assassin; but at least at first cut Garcia\ncould not be deemed a gang enforcer (and, as we learned ex\npost, his attack on Riccardo was neither a “hit” nor gang\nrelated). Second, Rausch knew that Garcia had a clean\n\fNo. 02-1961                                               9\n\nrecord in prison. He had not been disciplined for acts of\nviolence (let alone for sexual assault). That makes it\nreasonable for Rausch to have deemed Riccardo’s initial\nprotestation unjustified. It is not as if Rausch housed\nRiccardo with a known sexual predator.\n   Lest this observation be thought to leave prisoners with-\nout protection from assaults by others with “clean” records,\nwe add that there may be other ways to show both an\nobjectively serious risk and the guards’ knowledge of that\nrisk. For example, Riccardo might have attempted to dem-\nonstrate that there is a strong correlation between pris-\noners’ professions of fear and actual violence. How many\nmurders (or homosexual assaults) occur in Centralia (or the\nIllinois prison system) per hundred inmate-years of cus-\ntody? How many violent events were preceded by requests\nfor protection? How many requests for protection were\ndishonored, yet nothing untoward happened? Data along\nthese lines would have enabled a jury (and the court) to\nevaluate actual risks even though Riccardo was unable to\nshow that Rausch should have deemed Garcia to present an\nespecial risk. If violence is common at Centralia, and\ninmates have good track records in identifying potential\naggressors, then guards who do not have their heads in the\nsand must actually (that is, subjectively) understand the\nrisk an inmate faces when a protest is disregarded. But if\nviolence is rare, or if there is poor correlation between\ninmates’ alarums and subsequent violence, then Riccardo’s\ninitial protest would not have provided Rausch with actual\nknowledge of an impending assault. The record does not\ncontain any evidence along these lines. That leaves only\nRiccardo’s say-so, and for reasons we have already given a\nprisoner’s bare assertion is not enough to make the guard\nsubjectively aware of a risk, if the objective indicators do\nnot substantiate the inmate’s assertion.\n  Rausch also was entitled to believe that his assignment\nof Garcia and Riccardo to share a cell would last for one\n\f10                                               No. 02-1961\n\nnight only. During the next day shift the placement office,\narmed with better information, was supposed to make a\nfresh evaluation and, if appropriate, a new assignment.\nApparently that did not happen; the record does not show\nwhy. (Maybe it did happen and the staff approved Rausch’s\naction.) If Rausch knew that the staff charged with this re-\nsponsibility routinely failed to carry it out, then he might\nhave been obliged to take additional precautions (such as\nseparate interviews of Garcia and Riccardo to probe these\nissues more deeply) before making an assignment. Rausch\nhimself testified that separate interviews would have been\nbetter practice, but the Constitution does not enforce all\n“better practices”; this is one respect in which the eighth\namendment standard differs from the negligence standard.\nBut Riccardo does not contend, and the record does not\ndemonstrate, that disregard of the classification system at\nCentralia was so common that Rausch was bound to know\nthat his assignment would last indefinitely. Nor was\nRausch bound to foresee that, if Riccardo was in genuine\nfear, he would neglect to complain the next day, when he\nreadily could have done so. (Recall that Riccardo filed two\ngrievances on May 29 about other subjects.) Riccardo tes-\ntified that he was too terrified to protest and was put off by\nRausch’s assertion that prisoners in segregation can’t refuse\nassignments; yet grievances are confidential (so Garcia\nwould not have known), and prisoners often appeal over the\nhead of a guard who has told them that something can’t or\nwon’t be done. Riccardo had already objected to, and\nobtained the removal of, at least one cellmate assigned to\nhim in segregation. At all events, the question on the table\nis what Rausch knew (or deliberately avoided learning) on\nMay 28; and there is no evidence that Rausch subjectively\nbelieved that Riccardo would fail to use his opportunity to\nseek further review the next day.\n  Illinois is free, if it wishes, to give prisoners veto power\nover the identity of their cellmates. But the eighth amend-\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                 11\n\nment does not do so of its own force, and prisoners cannot\nuse the Constitution to achieve this control indirectly by\nmaking unsubstantiated assertions. The constitutional\nquestion is not what Riccardo (initially) said, but what\nRausch actually believed. Some prisoners are manipulative,\nsome are mistaken, and some are not only honest but also\naccurate. The Constitution does not oblige guards to assume\n(on pain of absolute liability if an assault later occurs) that\nall prisoners are in the third category; Farmer articulates\na different, and more demanding, standard, preserving\nroom for both independent judgment and honest mistake on\nthe guards’ part. This record does not permit a reasonable\njury to find that Rausch knew or deliberately disregarded\nthe fact that his actions subjected Riccardo to a substantial\nrisk off serious harm, so the judgment is\n                                                   REVERSED.\n\n\n\n\n  WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, dissenting. While I agree that\nAnthony Riccardo did in fact exhaust his administrative\nremedies, I disagree with the majority’s decision to overturn\nthe judgment in this action as a reasonable jury had ample\nevidence to find that Lieutenant Larry Rausch was deliber-\nately indifferent to the substantial risk of harm Riccardo\nfaced by being celled with Juan Garcia. Therefore, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n  On May 30, 1997, while celled with Juan Garcia, a known\nmember of the Latin Kings, Riccardo’s head was forcibly\nshaven by Garcia such that Riccardo was “bleeding pretty\nbad.” Tr. I at 81-82. Garcia then attempted to sodomize\nRiccardo; however, he was able to resist. Tr. II at 50. After\n\f12                                                  No. 02-1961\n\nRiccardo resisted, Garcia ejaculated on Riccardo’s feet. Tr.\nI at 83-84. Riccardo was then forced to perform oral sex on\nGarcia for 15 to 20 minutes. Id. The assault ended when an\nofficer walked by the cell. As the majority notes, the events\nwhich give rise to Lt. Rausch’s liability are limited to the\nhappenings on the evening of May 28, 1997, when Lt.\nRausch replaced Lt. Alemond1 as the lieutenant in charge\nof the segregation and receiving units at Centralia prison.2\n  On appeal, Lt. Rausch contends, and the majority agrees,\nthat the evidence introduced at trial was legally insufficient\nto support a finding of liability under the Eighth Amend-\nment. To sustain overturning a jury verdict, the record\nmust demonstrate no “legally sufficient evidentiary basis\nfor a reasonable jury to find for the non-moving party.”\nPayne v. Milwaukee County, 146 F.3d 430, 432 (7th Cir.\n1998). While undertaking this assessment, we analyze the\n“the totality of the evidence,” Sheenan v. Donlen Corp., 173\nF.3d 1039, 1043 (7th Cir. 1999), and are obliged to leave the\njudgment undisturbed unless the moving party can show\nthat “no rational jury could have brought in a verdict\nagainst him.” EEOC v. G-K-G, Inc., 39 F.3d 740, 745 (7th\nCir. 1994). It is not within the province of the appellate\ncourts to “reweigh the evidence.” Knox v. State of Indiana,\n93 F.3d 1327, 1332 (7th Cir. 1996). Lastly, and most\nimportantly, all reasonable inferences must be analyzed in\nthe light most favorable to Riccardo as the non-moving\nparty. Sheenan, 173 F.3d at 1044.\n\n\n1\n  Riccardo previously complained to Lt. Alemond that he feared\nbeing celled with Garcia because he was a Latin King, however,\nthe record reveals that this previous complaint was not voiced to\nLt. Rausch and therefore may not support a finding of liability\nagainst him.\n2\n  Lt. Rausch testified that he had no recollection of the events\nwhich transpired on May 28. Tr. III at 68. Thus, the jury was left\nwith Riccardo’s testimony concerning the events of that evening.\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                 13\n\n  In Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994) the Court\nbifurcated the standard for Eighth Amendment liability\ninto an objective element and a subjective element. First,\nthe potential harm to the inmate must be objectively\nserious. Id. (citing Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298\n(1991)). Second, under the subjective prong, the prison\nofficial must “deliberately disregard” this potential harm by\nbeing “aware of facts from which the inference could be\ndrawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and\n[also] draw[ing] the inference.” Id. at 838.\n  The second inquiry is a question of fact, sustainable\nthrough circumstantial evidence, id. at 842, mandating an\n“inquiry into a prison official’s state of mind.” Id. at 837\n(quoting Wilson, 501 U.S. at 299). “A prisoner normally\nproves actual knowledge of impending harm by showing\nthat he complained to prison officials about a specific threat\nto his safety.” McGill v. Duckworth, 944 F.2d 344, 349 (7th\nCir. 1991) (reasoning that the scienter requirement is\nsatisfied when a prison guard, “[s]uspect[s] something is\ntrue but shut[s] [his] eyes for fear of what [he] will learn” or\n“[goes] out of [his] way to avoid acquiring unwelcomed\nknowledge”).\n  The Supreme Court also cautioned that an “Eighth\nAmendment claimant need not show that a prison official\nacted or failed to act believing that harm actually would\nbefall an inmate; it is enough that the official acted or failed\nto act despite his knowledge of a substantial risk of serious\nharm.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842. Likewise, a claimant need\nnot prove that a prison official was aware of the specific\ntype of harm which befell the prisoner, only that the prison\nofficial was aware that a substantial risk of some type of\ndanger existed. See Haley v. Gross, 86 F.3d 630, 643 n.33\n(7th Cir. 1996) (applying Farmer, 511 U.S. at 843) (uphold-\ning jury verdict for $1.65 million based on a finding that\nprison guards were deliberately indifferent by failing to\nrespond to a prisoner’s repeated request to be removed from\n\f14                                               No. 02-1961\n\ncell when his cellmate set fire to cell causing the cellmate’s\ndeath and plaintiff’s severe burns). Thus, it was Riccardo’s\nburden to show that Lt. Rausch actually knew that there\nwas a substantial risk that Garcia would harm Riccardo. Id.\nHowever, Lt. Rausch would be shielded from liability if no\nobjectively serious risk existed, he was unaware of the\nimpending risk, McGill, 944 F.2d at 349, or he took reason-\nable steps to abate it, whether successful or not, Farmer,\n511 U.S. at 844.\n  Admittedly, there is evidence in the record to support a\nfinding that Garcia did not objectively pose a substantial\nthreat to Riccardo—namely, the fact that Garcia was also\nplaced in segregation for “enemy protection,” allegedly from\nthe Latin Kings, and that Garcia had no history of sexual\nassault. However, that is not the standard by which this\ncase should be reviewed. The standard is whether there\nexists a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable\njury to find in favor of Riccardo. Payne, 146 F.3d at 432.\n  A jury could have reasonably believed that Lt. Rausch\nwas deliberately indifferent to the substantial risk of harm\nto Riccardo. It is undisputed that Garcia was a member of\nthe Latin Kings. In their first interaction, Riccardo pri-\nvately pulled Lt. Rausch aside and expressed his fear of\nbeing celled with Garcia. Thus, Riccardo has presented\nsufficient evidence to support the finding that Lt. Rausch\nwas made aware of the potential harm. See McGill, 944\nF.2d at 349. The jury could have further found that Lt.\nRausch’s decision to question Riccardo in front of Garcia\nwas not a reasonable way to abate the potential danger to\nRiccardo. Moreover, Lt. Rausch admitted that “[i]f\n[Riccardo] would have told me he feared for his life, if he\nrefused housing or thought there was a threat to his safe-\nty[,] he would not have been placed—they would not have\nbeen placed together.” Tr. III at 73. Thus, a jury could have\ndetermined that Lt. Rausch’s admission, coupled with his\nprior statements to Riccardo on May 28 that Riccardo could\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                    15\n\nnot turn down a housing assignment in segregation, and\nthat Riccardo could not be moved to another cell due to a\nlack of space, amounted to Lt. Rausch “deliberately”\navoiding learning that Riccardo was in danger.3 Such an\nanalysis avoids the use of ex post occurrences, such as the\nfact that Garcia did in fact assault Riccardo, to sustain a\nfinding of deliberate indifference. Moreover, the fact that\nLt. Rausch is able to point to evidence in the record to sup-\nport his position does not mandate reversal of the jury’s\nverdict. Our sole duty as an appellate court is to analyze\nwhether the record supports the jury’s determination. It is\nnot our function to reweigh the evidence. Knox, 93 F.3d at\n1332.\n  I am further troubled by the majority’s reliance on\nRiccardo’s second statement to Lt. Rausch (made in front of\nGarcia) to sustain overturning the jury’s verdict. As it\nstands, the deliberate indifference inquiry is an inherently\nfactual determination, Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842, which re-\nquires an “inquiry into a prison official’s state of mind,” id.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  Significantly, Riccardo was actually housed in the receiving unit\nas opposed to the segregation unit during the assault. The jury\nheard testimony that the receiving unit is only used to house\ninmates when the segregation unit is full. Tr. I at 24. Thus, Lt.\nRausch’s statement to Riccardo that there was no place else to\nhouse him carried even greater weight. The jury also heard tes-\ntimony that it would have required more work for Lt. Rausch to\nmove Riccardo from a cell in receiving to a cell in segregation due\nto the time of the alleged refusal and the occupancy of receiving\nand segregation, Tr. III at 75-77; further supporting Riccardo’s\nbelief that any additional complaints about his cell assignment\nwould have been futile. Finally, the jury was told a prisoner may\nbe moved from one cell to another at any time. Tr. I at 25. There-\nfore, the jury had ample evidence to support its finding that Lt.\nRausch’s actions rose to the level of deliberate indifference.\n\f16                                                    No. 02-1961\n\nat 837.4 Thus, whether this second statement is used to\nsupport the assertion that there was no “objective” risk to\nRiccardo or that Lt. Rausch was stripped of his “subjective”\nknowledge of the harm, it is clear that Lt. Rausch’s credibil-\nity and sincerity are integral components to the usefulness\nof this interaction. In essence, the majority accepts Lt.\nRausch’s assertion that his second discussion with Riccardo\nin front of Garcia was a sincere investigation of the poten-\ntial risk to Riccardo. However, the jury found otherwise.\nFurther, when asked to review the defendant’s Rule 50\nmotion, the district court aptly stated,\n     [T]here is ample evidence from which to conclude\n     that Rausch’s attempt to ascertain the seriousness\n     of the threat was mere pretense, and that because\n     he did not want to go to the extra effort to find dif-\n     ferent accommodations for Garcia, he recklessly\n     disregarded what he knew to be a dangerous situ-\n     ation. That decision to essentially disregard the\n     threat is where liability lies. A jury could have rea-\n     sonably inferred that Rausch crossed the line from\n\n\n4\n  The Supreme Court’s discussion only further highlights the\npropriety of allowing a jury to make this determination:\n     When instructing juries in deliberate indifference cases\n     with such issues of proof, courts should be careful to\n     ensure that the requirement of subjective culpability is\n     not lost. It is not enough to merely find that a reasonable\n     person would have known, or that the defendant should\n     have known, and juries should be instructed accordingly.\nId. at n.8; accord Lewis v. Richards, 107 F.3d 549, 556 (7th Cir.\n1997) (Flaum, C.J., concurring) (“In view of the Supreme Court,\nthe safeguard against jurors whose outrage at prison violence\nmight lead them to sanction officials in the absence of an Eighth\nAmendment violation is not a relaxed summary judgment stand-\nard, but jury instructions that properly convey the applicable law.\nLower federal courts, in my view, should exhibit a similar faith in\nthe willingness of juries to follow the law.”).\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                       17\n\n    gross negligence to deliberate indifference based on the\n    ludicrousness of “asking” each inmate if he had a\n    problem with the other. Credibility had to have been\n    the key to the jury’s analysis, thus the Court cannot\n    interject its own credibility determinations; and if it\n    could, having observed both parties’ testimony, it may\n    well have reached the same conclusion as the\n    jury. [. . .]\n    [A] prison official will only be freed from liability if he\n    responded reasonably to the risk. As mentioned above,\n    Rausch’s method of questioning could be perceived as\n    deliberately forcing plaintiff to make a Hobson’s choice.\nRiccardo v. Rausch, No. 99-CV-372-CJP, at 15 (S.D. Ill. Mar. 7,\n2002) (order denying F.R.C.P. Rule 50(b) motion) (citations\nomitted) (emphasis in original). By taking Lt. Rausch at his\nword, the majority’s decision has the effect of immunizing\nprison officials from liability based on potentially unreasonable\nor contrived actions, and sanctions Lt. Rausch’s admittedly\nunreasonable behavior.\n  In an attempt to break the causal link between Lt. Rausch’s\nactions and the harm to Riccardo, the majority asserts that “the\nrisk that Riccardo professed to fear (a ‘hit’) did not come to\npass.” Majority opinion at 7. The inquiry, however, is not\nwhether “a hit” was actually put out on Riccardo as that would\nconstitute the sort of impermissible ex post determination\neschewed by the majority. Rather, the focus is solely on\nwhether Rausch was made aware that a substantial risk of\nsome type of danger existed prior to the actual event. See Haley,\n86 F.3d at 643 n.33. Under the majority’s analysis are we to\npresume that Riccardo’s pleas for protection would only guard\nagainst murder or physical beating? For the purposes of an\nEighth Amendment inquiry, in the prison context, I find no real\ndistinction between “a hit” and a sexual assault.\n  The majority also frees Lt. Rausch of liability based on\nthe assertion that Lt. Rausch was under no duty to foresee\n\f18                                                  No. 02-1961\n\nthat Riccardo would not complain to other prison officials\nbetween May 28, the date of Lt. Rausch and Riccardo’s\ninteraction, and May 30, when the assault actually took\nplace. The record reveals, however, that Garcia closely\nwatched Riccardo’s actions impeding Riccardo’s ability to\nhave a private conversation with prison guards outside of\nGarcia’s presence. Tr. I at 76-82; Tr. II at 42-43. Further,\nwhen Riccardo attempted to alert prison officials, Garcia\nresponded with escalating violence. Tr. II at 46-47. In light\nof Riccardo’s reasonable belief that he could not refuse his\nhousing assignment and that there was no other available\ncell, see note 3, supra, Riccardo did not realistically have\nthe ability to complain to other guards without alerting\nGarcia and incurring his wrath.\n  The majority’s decision to question the adequacy of\nRiccardo’s pleas for protection by requiring evidence con-\ncerning the overall number of sexual assaults at Centralia\nprison is also curious. See Lewis, 107 F.3d at 556 (Flaum,\nC.J., concurring) (“[T]he majority’s emphasis upon the\nadequacy of Lewis’s pleas for protection strikes me as\ninappropriate.”) The prison recognizes that “some prisoners\nare manipulative and cry ‘wolf’,” majority opinion at 5, and\nhas created a procedure to deal with this recurring possibil-\nity. A prisoner’s request for a cell transfer is always hon-\nored if the prisoner alleges a fear for his personal safety, Tr.\nI at 44, but the prison deals with potential frivolity by\ntreating every request as a potential disciplinary violation.\nId.5 Thus, the prison has created a procedure whereby a\nprisoner is moved first, and questions concerning the\nsincerity of the request are asked later. In addition, the\ninquiry under the Eighth Amendment is an individualized\none, i.e., Riccardo was required to prove, based on the\n\n\n5\n  Major Lawrence Jefferson was clear that “if [a prisoner is] just\nrefusing housing just to refuse housing with no reason, then we’ll\nmove him for that, but he’ll get a ticket for that.” Id.\n\fNo. 02-1961                                               19\n\nindividual facts of his case, that he was subjected to an\nobjectively serious harm and that Lt. Rausch was “aware of\nfacts from which the inference could be drawn that a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm exist[ed].” Farmer, 511\nU.S. at 838.\n  Finally, though unpursued by the majority, defendant\nargues that should a constitutional violation be found, he is\nnevertheless entitled to qualified immunity. According to\nRausch, previous case law must show that “no reasonable\nprison official would have believed it was constitutional\neither to cell an inmate with someone who gave conflicting\nanswers when asked (in the other inmate’s presence) if he\nhad a problem with that inmate, or to rely on a policy\nrequiring review of all placement decisions for suitability\nwithin hours.” Appellant’s Brief at 33. However, the\nSupreme Court in Hope v. Pelzer, expressly rejected the\nnotion that in order for a right to be “clearly established”\nprevious case law must contain facts which are “materially\nsimilar” to the facts contained in the underlying action. 536\nU.S. 730, 739 (2002); see also Burgess v. Lowery, 201 F.3d\n942, 944-45 (7th Cir. 2000). Rather, the Court focused on\nwhether the prior case law would place officers on notice\nthat their conduct is unlawful. Id. It is clear that Farmer\nput prison guards on notice that they have a duty, under\nthe Eighth Amendment, to protect inmates from being\ngratuitously beaten or raped by other inmates. See id. at\n833; see also Haley, 86 F.3d at 646 (rejecting qualified\nimmunity defense in light of Farmer decision which further\nelucidated “deliberate indifference” standard).\n  In light of the aforementioned, I must agree with the trial\ncourt that a reasonable jury had ample evidence to sustain\nthis verdict and thus I respectfully dissent.\n\f20                                                 No. 02-1961\n\n  Before FLAUM, Chief Judge, and POSNER, EASTERBROOK,\nRIPPLE, MANION, KANNE, ROVNER, DIANE P. WOOD, EVANS,\nand WILLIAMS, Circuit Judges.†\n  Plaintiff-appellee filed a petition for rehearing and\nrehearing en banc on March 12, 2004. In response to this\npetition, the panel has amended its opinion; the amend-\nments are reflected in the immediately preceding revised\nopinion. A majority of the judges on the panel voted to deny\nrehearing. A judge called for a vote on the petition for\nrehearing en banc, but a majority of the active judges did\nnot favor rehearing en banc. Accordingly, the petition is\ndenied.\n\n\n\n\n  RIPPLE, Circuit Judge, with whom ROVNER, DIANE P.\nWOOD and WILLIAMS, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting from\nthe denial of rehearing en banc. Today, the court allows to\nstand the decision of a panel majority that imposes on\nprison inmates a new and impossibly high standard of proof\nfor establishing deliberate indifference in prison condition\ncases. The panel majority strongly suggests that, in order\nto show deliberate indifference, a prisoner must not only\nidentify with particularity the harm he fears but also\nbolster his own account with a special showing containing\nmaterial such as statistical evidence of a “strong correlation\nbetween prisoners’ professions and actual violence.”\nRiccardo v. Rausch, slip op. at 9. Neither of these require-\n\n\n†\n  Circuit Judge Sykes did not participate in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                  21\n\nments find support in circuit or Supreme Court precedent.\nConsequently, the panel majority’s imposition of these\nrequirements not only does violence to our Eighth Amend-\nment jurisprudence, but it also effectively amends, without\nany legislative mandate, the standard for judgment as a\nmatter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 for\ncases brought by prisoners.\n\n\n                             1.\n  Mr. Riccardo told Lt. Rausch that the Latin Kings had put\nout a “hit” on him and that placement in a cell with Garcia,\na known Latin King, would endanger his life. Two days\nlater, Mr. Riccardo was forced to perform sexual acts with\nGarcia. The panel majority nevertheless concludes that this\nevidence is not sufficient to establish that Lt. Rausch\nshould have appreciated a serious risk to Mr. Riccardo\nbecause the “risk from which Riccardo sought protection\nwas not realized.” Id. at 7-8. In short, in the panel major-\nity’s view, because Mr. Riccardo was raped, but not killed,\nLt. Rausch cannot be held liable for his failure to respond\nto Mr. Riccardo’s fears.\n  The Supreme Court in Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825\n(1994), eschewed this sort of distinction. The Court made\nclear that a prison official cannot escape\n    liability for deliberate indifference by showing that,\n    while he was aware of an obvious, substantial risk\n    to inmate safety, he did not know that the com-\n    plainant was especially likely to be assaulted by the\n    specific prisoner who eventually committed the\n    assault. The question under the Eighth Amendment\n    is whether prison officials, acting with deliberate\n    indifference, exposed a prisoner to a sufficiently\n    substantial “risk of serious damage to his future\n    health,” Helling [v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 35\n\f22                                                No. 02-1961\n\n     (1993),] and it does not matter whether the risk\n     comes from a single source or multiple sources, any\n     more than it matters whether a prisoner faces an\n     excessive risk of attack for reasons personal to him\n     or because all prisoners in his situation face such a\n     risk.\nId. at 843 (emphasis added). Just as Mr. Riccardo did not\nneed to identify the member of the Latin Kings who would\nmete out the retaliatory action that he feared, he did not\nneed to identify the specific sort of bodily harm that would\nbe inflicted upon him. Indeed, our case law makes crystal\nclear that such precision with respect to identifying risks is\nnot required:\n     While there must be some link between the risk of\n     which the official was aware and the harm that\n     actually occurred—as it would be unfair to hold offi-\n     cials liable for risks they could not have anticipated\n     simply because they ignored other unrelated\n     risks—prison officials need not be specifically aware\n     of the precise risk that unfolds.\nHaley v. Gross, 86 F.3d 630, 643 n.33 (7th Cir. 1996).\nMr. Riccardo feared reprisal by the Latin Kings. Garcia, a\nmember of that gang, committed an act of physical violence\nupon Mr. Riccardo. The fact that Mr. Riccardo did not suffer\na worse fate does not negate the seriousness or the validity\nof the threat to Mr. Riccardo that was communicated to Lt.\nRausch.\n\n\n                              2.\n The panel majority further opines that Mr. Riccardo\nmight have overcome the infirmity in his case by showing\n     that there is a strong correlation between prisoners’\n     professions of fear and actual violence. How many\n     murders (or homosexual assaults) occur in Central-\n\fNo. 02-1961                                               23\n\n    ia (or the Illinois prison system) per hundred\n    inmate-years of custody? How many violent events\n    were preceded by requests for protection? How\n    many requests for protection were dishonored, yet\n    nothing untoward happened? Data along these lines\n    would have enabled a jury (and the court) to evalu-\n    ate actual risks. . . .\nRiccardo, slip op. at 9. Neither this court, other courts of\nappeals, nor the Supreme Court ever has required a show-\ning that expressed fears and violence were related in some\nstatistically significant way. It always has been sufficient\nthat the prisoner articulated his fear, that the prison\nofficial believed the inmate, but that the official failed to\ntake reasonable actions to protect the prisoner from harm.\nWe often have stated that\n    [i]f “the circumstances suggest that the defendant-\n    official being sued had been exposed to information\n    concerning the risk and thus ‘must have known’\n    about it, then such evidence could be sufficient to\n    permit a trier of fact to find that the defendant-\n    official had actual knowledge of the risk.”\nSanville v. McCaughtry, 266 F.3d 724, 737 (7th Cir. 2001)\n(quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842-43; emphasis added). The\nquestion of whether the prison official had the “requisite\nknowledge is a question of fact” reserved for the jury. Id.\nRequiring the sort of statistical evidence suggested by the\npanel majority in order to establish the existence of such a\nrisk imposes on inmates a practical burden that is im-\npossible for prisoners to meet. Prisoners certainly should\nnot be relieved of meeting their burden of proof, but, like\nother litigants, they ought to be permitted to come forward\nwith any evidence, direct or circumstantial, that is proba-\ntive of the knowledge of prison officials concerning threats\nreported to them. The judicial inquiry ought not be whether\nthere was statistical evidence from which a jury could\nconclude that the threat was “real” or should be taken\nseriously, but whether the record contains any evidence\n\f24                                                No. 02-1961\n\nfrom which the jury reasonably could conclude that the\nprison official knew that the prisoner was subject to a risk\nof serious harm. Moreover, there indeed may be times and\ncircumstances when the representation of the prisoner will\nbe a sufficient basis to require action on the part of the\nprison official. I see no reason for a categorical rule that,\nunder no circumstances, can such a representation be suf-\nficient.\n  There is no question that Mr. Riccardo articulated to Lt.\nRausch his fear of physical violence if celled with a member\nof the Latin Kings. In violation of Centralia’s own pol-\nicy—one presumably founded on a recognized correlation\nbetween complaints and violence—Lt. Rausch did not move\nMr. Riccardo to another cell; instead, Lt. Rausch forced Mr.\nRiccardo to articulate any concerns in the presence of the\nvery source of Mr. Riccardo’s fears, Garcia. As the district\ncourt determined in rejecting the defendant’s Rule 50\nmotion, there was\n     ample evidence from which to conclude that\n     Rausch’s attempt to ascertain the seriousness of the\n     threat was a mere pretense, and that because he\n     did not want to go to the extra effort to find dif-\n     ferent accommodations for Garcia, he recklessly\n     disregarded what he knew to be a dangerous situ-\n     ation. That decision to essentially disregard the\n     threat is where liability lies. A jury could have rea-\n     sonably inferred that Rausch crossed the line from\n     gross negligence to deliberate indifference based on\n     the ludicrousness of “asking” each inmate if he\n     had a problem with the other. Credibility had to\n     have been the key to the jury’s analysis, this Court\n     cannot interject its own credibility determinations;\n     and if it could, having observed both parties’ tes-\n     timony, it may very well have reached the same\n     conclusion as the jury.\nR.64 at 15-16.\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                 25\n\n   The panel majority makes clear its disagreement with the\njury’s view of the evidence. The evidence in favor of Mr.\nRiccardo may not be overwhelming, but it is certainly not\nlegally insufficient. When the evidence is viewed in the\nlight most favorable to Mr. Riccardo, as it must be, a jury\ncould reasonably conclude that Lt. Rausch knew of a serious\nrisk of harm to Mr. Riccardo but failed to take reasonable\nsteps to prevent it. The panel majority may have come to a\ndifferent conclusion if it had sat as the trier of fact, but its\ndisagreement in that respect is certainly not an appropriate\noccasion for revising Eighth Amendment and Rule 50\nstandards.\n  The panel majority opinion not only deprives Mr. Riccardo\nof his right to a jury trial, it also takes a very significant\nstep in depriving individuals incarcerated in this circuit of\na realistic opportunity to meet their burden of proof in these\ncases. I therefore respectfully dissent from the denial of\nrehearing en banc.\n\n\n\n\n  WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, with whom RIPPLE, ROVNER,\nand DIANE P. WOOD, Circuit Judges, join in dissenting from\nthe denial of rehearing en banc. The majority’s opinion has\nincorrectly resolved and unjustifiably reframed both the\nEighth Amendment standard for deliberate indifference as\nwell as the Rule 50 standard to set aside a jury verdict.\n  With regard to the Eighth Amendment inquiry, the\nmajority opinion highlights a major gap in the case law.\nParticularly, what is required to prove the objective prong\nof the deliberate indifference standard? The Court in\n\f26                                                No. 02-1961\n\nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 n.3 (1994) did not\naddress this issue. On page 9, the majority asks a plethora\nof questions which go to this issue, i.e., the overall threat of\nviolence at the prison. Perhaps the dearth of case law on\nthis point is due in part to the general knowledge that\nprisons are dangerous places where rape and assault occur\nfrequently and therefore threats, such as the one in this\ncase, must be handled with more caution than exhibited by\nRausch. See Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003,42 U.S.C.\n§ 15601-02 (2004) (“The purpose of this chapter is to: (1)\nestablish a zero-tolerance standard for the incidence of\nprison rape in prisons in the United States. (6) increase the\naccountability of prison officials who fail to detect, prevent,\nreduce, and punish prison rape.”) (“Congress makes the\nfollowing findings: (2) Insufficient research has been\nconducted and insufficient data reported on the extent of\nprison rape. . . . Many inmates have suffered repeated as-\nsaults. (13) The high incidence of sexual assault within\nprisons involves actual and potential violations of the\nUnited States Constitution.”). Centralia Prison’s policy, to\nmove prisoners first and discipline them later for baseless\nrequests, is further proof of the objective danger. Again,\nevidence of the prison’s policy does not hold Rausch liable\nfor mere negligence; rather, it reflects the understood en-\nvironment in the prison, as accepted by prison officials,\nguards, and administrators, that threats of violence have a\nhigh probability of leading to attacks. Riccardo, therefore,\nproved that the asserted danger was objectively serious.\n  Under the more specific inquiry of Farmer’s subjective\nprong, the prison official must “deliberately disregard” a\npotential harm by being “aware of facts from which the\ninference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious\nharm exists, and [also] draw[ing] the inference.” Id. at 838.\nThis seems to me to create two questions: (1) what facts\nwere presented to Rausch, and (2) did he accept them as\ntrue or did his actions evince his intent to purposefully\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                 27\n\nignore those apparent facts? Once again, the inquiry is a\nparticularized one, focused on the officer’s knowledge.\nWithout repeating what I have already set out in my dis-\nsent, the jury was presented with evidence that Riccardo\ntold Rausch he did not want to be celled with Garcia be-\ncause he was in fear of an attack. “A prisoner normally\nproves actual knowledge of impending harm by showing\nthat he complained to prison officials about a specific threat\nto his safety.” McGill v. Duckworth, 944 F.2d 344, 349 (7th\nCir. 1991). Therefore, contrary to the majority’s assertion,\nthe first part of this inquiry is satisfied.\n  Accepting the majority’s point that Riccardo’s mere “say-\nso” is not enough to establish Eighth Amendment liability,\nthere were plenty of “objective indicators” to support the\njury’s finding that Rausch’s actions amounted to deliberate\nindifference. The jury heard evidence that Rausch put\nthe two men in front of each other to determine whether a\nproblem existed. It is this act, which the majority uses to\nexonerate Rausch from liability. However, it is this very act\nwhich evinces Rausch’s deliberate indifference as found by\nthe jury and reiterated by the district court. What is more,\nthis court has already defined such action as unacceptable\nunder the Eighth Amendment. Id. at 349 (reasoning that\nthe scienter requirement is satisfied when a prison guard,\n“[s]uspect[s] something is true but shut[s] [his] eyes for fear\nof what [he] will learn” or “[goes] out of [his] way to avoid\nacquiring unwelcomed knowledge”). The jury found that no\nreasonable guard would think that asking Riccardo to admit\nfear of Garcia with Garcia present, would illicit an honest\nresponse. Again, it is this act that crosses the line. Recog-\nnizing that these specific actions were inconsistent with the\nEighth Amendment would not create per se liability for\nprison officials. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the\ncourt’s decision not to rehear this case en banc.\n\f28                                        No. 02-1961\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                    ________________________________\n                    Clerk of the United States Court of\n                      Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n               USCA-02-C-0072—7-12-04\n\f",

Anthony Riccardo, an\ninmate of the Centralia Correctional Center in Illinois,\nneeded a new cellmate after his former cellmate complained\nabout being housed with him. Normally that pairing would\nhave been made by Centralia’s placement office, but when\nthe evening of May 28, 1997, arrived and some inmates\nremained unassigned after the regular placement officers\nhad left, the task fell to Lt. Larry Rausch, who was serving\nthe second shift. Rausch matched Riccardo with Juan\n\f2                                                No. 02-1961\n\nGarcia, a pairing that should have lasted only until the\nplacement officers on the day shift could review matters.\nTwo days later Garcia sexually assaulted Riccardo, who\nsued Rausch under 42 U.S.C. §1983. A jury concluded that\nRausch had subjected Riccardo to cruel and unusual\npunishment and awarded $1.5 million in compensatory\ndamages. The district court entered judgment on this ver-\ndict, and Rausch appeals.\n  His lead-off argument is that Riccardo failed to use his\nadministrative remedies. If so, then 42 U.S.C. §1997e(a),\npart of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, forecloses this suit\neven though Riccardo challenges a discrete incident and\nwants a form of relief—money damages—that the ad-\nministrative process in Illinois does not provide.

Riccardo did file an administrative grievance,\nbut Rausch contends it was too late (in February 1998,\nwhile Illinois sets a limit of six months) and asked the state\nto prosecute Garcia rather than do anything about Rausch\nand the classification system.\n   Prisoners must follow state rules about the time and\ncontent of grievances.

Failure to do this means failure to use (and thus to\nexhaust) available remedies. Yet the state’s administrative\napparatus did not reject Riccardo’s grievance as untimely;\nit accepted and denied the grievance on the merits. At the\ntime of these events, Illinois permitted a filing after six\nmonths when the prisoner had good cause, see 20 Ill.\nAdmin. Code §504.810 (1997). The official handling the\ngrievance must have found good cause; anyway, we held\nin Pozo that, when a state treats a filing as timely and\nresolves it on the merits, the federal judiciary will not\nsecond-guess that action, for the grievance has served its\nfunction of alerting the state and inviting corrective action.\n286 F.3d at 1025.\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                 3\n\n  As for the content of this grievance: true enough, its main\nobjective was to have Garcia prosecuted. (Riccardo deemed\ninadequate Garcia’s punishment within the prison system.)\nBut it also at least hinted at problems in prison administra-\ntion. Riccardo wrote: “[T]he administration don’t [sic] do\nthere [sic] job. [A sexual assault] should’ve never [sic]\nhappen again.” This language is ambiguous. There are two\nprincipal ways to reduce the number of sexual assaults in\nprison: better steps ex ante to separate potential aggressors\nfrom potential victims; and harsher penalties ex post in\norder to deter future assaults. Riccardo did not distinguish\nbetween the two, and a prison administration receiving\nsuch a grievance should have considered both. Illinois has\nnot adopted any rule governing the level of detail required\nof prisoners’ grievances. “When the administrative rulebook\nis silent, a grievance suffices if it alerts the prison to the\nnature of the wrong for which redress is sought. As in a\nnotice-pleading system, the grievant need not lay out the\nfacts, articulate legal theories, or demand particular relief.\nAll the grievance need do is object intelligibly to some\nasserted shortcoming.” Strong, 297 F.3d at 650. The\ndocument that Riccardo filed is at the border of intelligibil-\nity; it is hard to imagine much less that a prisoner could do\nand still alert the prison; yet this grievance did complain\nthat Garcia had committed a rape and that “the administra-\ntion don’t do there job.” A generous construction of this\ngrievance would have induced the prison to consider the\npossibility that the guards could have prevented this\nassault. So we conclude that Riccardo exhausted the\nadministrative process. If Illinois wants grievances to be\nmore detailed, it must adopt appropriate regulations and\ninform prisoners what is required of them. Riccardo is\nentitled to a decision on the merits of his constitutional\nclaim.\n  Because Riccardo prevailed at trial, we recap the facts\nin the light most favorable to his position. Riccardo was\n\f4                                              No. 02-1961\n\nanally raped by his cellmate at Cook County Jail, shortly\nafter his conviction for aggravated assault. When he arrived\nat Centralia Correctional Center in November 1996, he told\nthe prison psychologist that he did not feel safe. After a\nstint in segregation for violating prison rules, Riccardo\ndeclined to return to the general population. He told guards\nthat a cellmate in the segregation unit had stolen some of\nhis property and objected to spending another day with that\ncellmate. He believed that the responsible inmate belonged\nto the Latin Kings gang and that the Latin Kings may have\nbeen preparing to kill him—though he did not say why he\nbelieved this. But Centralia allows inmates to veto housing\nwith persons they declare to be enemies, so the prison found\nRiccardo a new cellmate. When, after a few days, that\ncellmate objected to spending more time with Riccardo,\nanother pairing was required. (The segregation unit was too\ncrowded to permit Riccardo a cell of his own.)\n   During the afternoon of May 28, Garcia had offered to\nhelp Riccardo retrieve his stolen property. Riccardo took\nthis as an ill omen rather than as a genuine offer of assis-\ntance and told Lt. Alemond that he feared for his life if\ncelled with Garcia. Although Alemond said that he would\n“take care of it,” he did nothing—he did not either find a\ncellmate for Riccardo or alert Lt. Rausch, Alemond’s\nreplacement on the next shift. About 9:30 that evening,\nRausch brought Garcia to Riccardo’s cell and told him that\nGarcia was his new cellmate. Before the cells were locked\nfor the night, Riccardo sought out Rausch in private and\ntold him that he believed that the Latin Kings had a “hit”\nout on him, and that he feared for his life if celled with\nGarcia. Rausch replied that there was no place else to put\nGarcia (or Riccardo) that evening, and that he could not\nrefuse housing while in segregation. Rausch then brought\nRiccardo and Garcia back together and asked each, in turn,\nif he had a problem with the other. Riccardo shook his head\nin the negative. Rausch took that as agreement to the\n\fNo. 02-1961                                               5\n\nassignment. That was Riccardo’s last contact with Rausch.\nAs we have mentioned, nothing untoward happened that\nevening or the next, but during the evening of May 30\nGarcia compelled Riccardo to perform oral sex. The record\ndoes not suggest that this assault had any connection to the\nLatin Kings. During the time between assignment and\nassault, Riccardo did not ask for a different cellmate\n(though he did file two grievances on May 29 about other\nmatters). Circumstances brought out at trial suggest that\nother guards should have recognized on May 30 that\nproblems had developed between Riccardo and Garcia; their\nfailure to intervene may be culpable but cannot be attrib-\nuted to Rausch, whose liability depends exclusively on his\nactions the evening of May 28.\n  Rausch did not assault Riccardo and is not vicariously\nliable for Garcia’s crime. Like other guards, however,\nRausch was required to refrain from placing Riccardo in\nharm’s way gratuitously. The qualification “gratuitously” is\nimportant, because prisons are dangerous places. Inmates\nget there by violent acts, and many prisoners have a\npropensity to commit more. Guards cannot turn away\npersons committed by the courts; nor do individual guards\nhave any control over crowding and other systemic circum-\nstances. All that can be expected is that guards act re-\nsponsibly under the circumstances that confront them. See\nMcGill v. Duckworth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567976\"><a href=\"/opinion/567976/herbert-f-mcgill-plaintiff-appelleecross-appellant-v-jack-r-duckworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1991). A guard\nmay be responsible without being credulous. Some prison-\ners are manipulative and cry “wolf” in an effort to have a\ncell to themselves or choose a favored cellmate. Other\nprisoners perceive specters in every shadow, even though\ntheir fears are unsupported. (There is, for example, no\nreason to think that the Latin Kings ever had it in for\nRiccardo. He did not belong to a rival gang, and there is no\nhistory of violent or overtly hostile encounters between\nRiccardo and any gang member.) Guards therefore must\ndiscriminate between serious risks of harm and feigned or\n\f6                                                No. 02-1961\n\nimagined ones, which is not an easy task given the brief\ntime and scant information available to make each of the\nmany decisions that fill every day’s work.\n  The eighth amendment does not demand that guards\nperform this task flawlessly. It does not even hold them to\nthe negligence standard. Liability is possible, instead, only\nwhen a guard is deliberately indifferent to a substantial\nrisk of serious harm. See Helling v. McKinney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112888\"><a href=\"/opinion/112888/helling-v-mckinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993); Wilson v.

It is not enough, the Court held in Farmer, that the\nguard ought to have recognized the risk. Instead, “the\nofficial must both be aware of facts from which the infer-\nence could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm\nexists, and he must also draw the inference.” Id. at 837.\n  Rausch contends that Riccardo did not face a “substantial\nrisk of serious harm” from Garcia on the evening of May 28,\n1997; that, if such a risk was present, Rausch did not\nappreciate its existence; and that at all events he is entitled\nto qualified immunity because reasonable officers would not\nnecessarily have understood that the law clearly required\nRiccardo and Garcia to be in separate cells. The first two\nmatters (the objective and subjective components of the\neighth amendment) are for the jury in the first instance,\nwith appellate review limited to the question whether any\nreasonable juror could have found that the requisite level of\nrisk existed, and that Rausch knew it. Immunity, however,\nis a matter of law for the court, to be decided without\ndeference to the jury’s resolution—and preferably before the\ncase goes to the jury. See Saucier v. Katz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 202\n(2001); Anderson v.

The\ndistrict court brushed aside Rausch’s invocation of immu-\nnity, writing that a guard cannot benefit from immunity if\nthe action taken was not a reasonable response to a risk\nactually foreseen. That approach, which merges immunity\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                    7\n\nand the merits, is incompatible with Saucier and its\npredecessors. See 533 U.S. at 203-06. Immunity protects\nofficials who act at the “hazy border” (id. at 206) between\nthe lawful and the forbidden. That Rausch may have\noverstepped the line does not mean that every reasonable\nofficer would have been bound to know that Rausch acted\nimproperly. We need not pursue the immunity defense,\nhowever, because Saucier calls on appellate courts to\naddress the merits first, see id. at 201, and Rausch is\nentitled to prevail outright: no reasonable juror could have\nconcluded, on this record, that Rausch actually recognized\nthat placing Garcia and Riccardo together exposed Riccardo\nto substantial risk.\n  Now it might seem that Rausch had to appreciate the\nrisk, because (a) Riccardo claimed to fear for his life if celled\nwith any member of the Latin Kings, and (b) Garcia in fact\nharmed Riccardo. One problem with relying on how things\nturned out to show knowledge of risk beforehand is that\nGarcia did not act for the Latin Kings; he told Riccardo that\nhe was fulfilling a personal fantasy, and Riccardo believed\nthis explanation. Thus the risk that Riccardo professed to\nfear (a “hit”) did not come to pass. Even under the law of\nnegligence, this is an important distinction. If a school\ndistrict entrusts a bus to a driver with a bad drinking\nrecord, and the tipsy driver runs the bus off the road while\nspeeding, the school district is liable; but if instead there is\nan accident for which the driver is not at fault (a tree falls\non bus), or the driver collapses of a heart attack while on\nthe road, the district is not liable, because that was not the\ntype of risk created or increased by the negligent conduct\neven though hiring this particular driver was in the causal\nchain. See, e.g., Berry v. Sugar Notch Borough, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1899). The risk from which Riccardo sought\nprotection was not realized; for all this record shows, the\n(objectively evaluated) risk to Riccardo of sharing a cell\nwith Garcia was no greater than the risk of sharing a cell\nwith any other prisoner.\n\f8                                                No. 02-1961\n\n  As for Rausch’s subjective assessment: though Riccardo\ninitially asserted mortal fear, when later asked whether\nhe “had a problem” with Garcia he shook his head to give a\nnegative answer. Rausch then had to decide which state-\nment to believe. Riccardo argues, and the jury evidently\nconcluded, that Rausch should have believed the first\nstatement, communicated in private, rather than the sec-\nond, communicated in Garcia’s presence. A rational jury\ncould have thought that guards should give priority to\nstatements made in private. (Rausch testified that, if\nRiccardo had claimed to “have a problem” with Garcia, they\nwould have been separated; but Riccardo might have feared\nthe consequences in a later encounter in the prison’s\ngeneral population.) Still, what Rausch should have\nbelieved is not the right question; we need to know what he\ndid believe. No reasonable jury could have found, in light of\nRiccardo’s denial of “a problem” with Garcia and Rausch’s\ndecision to act accordingly, that Rausch subjectively\nappreciated that his action would expose Riccardo to a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm.\n  As we have already explained, prisoners may object to\npotential cellmates in an effort to manipulate assignments,\nor out of ignorance; thus although a protest may demon-\nstrate risk it does not necessarily do so. The Constitution\ndoes not oblige guards to believe whatever inmates say.\nHow does a reasonable guard separate fact from fiction?\nRausch knew when making the assignment at least two\nthings beyond Riccardo’s contradictory assertions. First,\nRausch knew that Garcia was himself in segregation for\nprotection from the Latin Kings (or at least a subset of\nthem). Perhaps Garcia was manipulating the system him-\nself, falsely asserting to fear the Latin Kings so that he\ncould serve as their assassin; but at least at first cut Garcia\ncould not be deemed a gang enforcer (and, as we learned ex\npost, his attack on Riccardo was neither a “hit” nor gang\nrelated). Second, Rausch knew that Garcia had a clean\n\fNo. 02-1961                                               9\n\nrecord in prison. He had not been disciplined for acts of\nviolence (let alone for sexual assault). That makes it\nreasonable for Rausch to have deemed Riccardo’s initial\nprotestation unjustified. It is not as if Rausch housed\nRiccardo with a known sexual predator.\n   Lest this observation be thought to leave prisoners with-\nout protection from assaults by others with “clean” records,\nwe add that there may be other ways to show both an\nobjectively serious risk and the guards’ knowledge of that\nrisk. For example, Riccardo might have attempted to dem-\nonstrate that there is a strong correlation between pris-\noners’ professions of fear and actual violence. How many\nmurders (or homosexual assaults) occur in Centralia (or the\nIllinois prison system) per hundred inmate-years of cus-\ntody? How many violent events were preceded by requests\nfor protection? How many requests for protection were\ndishonored, yet nothing untoward happened? Data along\nthese lines would have enabled a jury (and the court) to\nevaluate actual risks even though Riccardo was unable to\nshow that Rausch should have deemed Garcia to present an\nespecial risk. If violence is common at Centralia, and\ninmates have good track records in identifying potential\naggressors, then guards who do not have their heads in the\nsand must actually (that is, subjectively) understand the\nrisk an inmate faces when a protest is disregarded. But if\nviolence is rare, or if there is poor correlation between\ninmates’ alarums and subsequent violence, then Riccardo’s\ninitial protest would not have provided Rausch with actual\nknowledge of an impending assault. The record does not\ncontain any evidence along these lines. That leaves only\nRiccardo’s say-so, and for reasons we have already given a\nprisoner’s bare assertion is not enough to make the guard\nsubjectively aware of a risk, if the objective indicators do\nnot substantiate the inmate’s assertion.\n  Rausch also was entitled to believe that his assignment\nof Garcia and Riccardo to share a cell would last for one\n\f10                                               No. 02-1961\n\nnight only. During the next day shift the placement office,\narmed with better information, was supposed to make a\nfresh evaluation and, if appropriate, a new assignment.\nApparently that did not happen; the record does not show\nwhy. (Maybe it did happen and the staff approved Rausch’s\naction.) If Rausch knew that the staff charged with this re-\nsponsibility routinely failed to carry it out, then he might\nhave been obliged to take additional precautions (such as\nseparate interviews of Garcia and Riccardo to probe these\nissues more deeply) before making an assignment. Rausch\nhimself testified that separate interviews would have been\nbetter practice, but the Constitution does not enforce all\n“better practices”; this is one respect in which the eighth\namendment standard differs from the negligence standard.\nBut Riccardo does not contend, and the record does not\ndemonstrate, that disregard of the classification system at\nCentralia was so common that Rausch was bound to know\nthat his assignment would last indefinitely. Nor was\nRausch bound to foresee that, if Riccardo was in genuine\nfear, he would neglect to complain the next day, when he\nreadily could have done so. (Recall that Riccardo filed two\ngrievances on May 29 about other subjects.) Riccardo tes-\ntified that he was too terrified to protest and was put off by\nRausch’s assertion that prisoners in segregation can’t refuse\nassignments; yet grievances are confidential (so Garcia\nwould not have known), and prisoners often appeal over the\nhead of a guard who has told them that something can’t or\nwon’t be done. Riccardo had already objected to, and\nobtained the removal of, at least one cellmate assigned to\nhim in segregation. At all events, the question on the table\nis what Rausch knew (or deliberately avoided learning) on\nMay 28; and there is no evidence that Rausch subjectively\nbelieved that Riccardo would fail to use his opportunity to\nseek further review the next day.\n  Illinois is free, if it wishes, to give prisoners veto power\nover the identity of their cellmates. But the eighth amend-\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                 11\n\nment does not do so of its own force, and prisoners cannot\nuse the Constitution to achieve this control indirectly by\nmaking unsubstantiated assertions. The constitutional\nquestion is not what Riccardo (initially) said, but what\nRausch actually believed. Some prisoners are manipulative,\nsome are mistaken, and some are not only honest but also\naccurate. The Constitution does not oblige guards to assume\n(on pain of absolute liability if an assault later occurs) that\nall prisoners are in the third category; Farmer articulates\na different, and more demanding, standard, preserving\nroom for both independent judgment and honest mistake on\nthe guards’ part. This record does not permit a reasonable\njury to find that Rausch knew or deliberately disregarded\nthe fact that his actions subjected Riccardo to a substantial\nrisk off serious harm, so the judgment is\n                                                   REVERSED.\n\n\n\n\n  WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, dissenting. While I agree that\nAnthony Riccardo did in fact exhaust his administrative\nremedies, I disagree with the majority’s decision to overturn\nthe judgment in this action as a reasonable jury had ample\nevidence to find that Lieutenant Larry Rausch was deliber-\nately indifferent to the substantial risk of harm Riccardo\nfaced by being celled with Juan Garcia. Therefore, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n  On May 30, 1997, while celled with Juan Garcia, a known\nmember of the Latin Kings, Riccardo’s head was forcibly\nshaven by Garcia such that Riccardo was “bleeding pretty\nbad.” Tr. I at 81-82. Garcia then attempted to sodomize\nRiccardo; however, he was able to resist. Tr. II at 50. After\n\f12                                                  No. 02-1961\n\nRiccardo resisted, Garcia ejaculated on Riccardo’s feet. Tr.\nI at 83-84. Riccardo was then forced to perform oral sex on\nGarcia for 15 to 20 minutes. Id. The assault ended when an\nofficer walked by the cell. As the majority notes, the events\nwhich give rise to Lt. Rausch’s liability are limited to the\nhappenings on the evening of May 28, 1997, when Lt.\nRausch replaced Lt. Alemond1 as the lieutenant in charge\nof the segregation and receiving units at Centralia prison.2\n  On appeal, Lt. Rausch contends, and the majority agrees,\nthat the evidence introduced at trial was legally insufficient\nto support a finding of liability under the Eighth Amend-\nment.

First,\nthe potential harm to the inmate must be objectively\nserious. Id. (citing Wilson v.

Likewise, a claimant need\nnot prove that a prison official was aware of the specific\ntype of harm which befell the prisoner, only that the prison\nofficial was aware that a substantial risk of some type of\ndanger existed. See Haley v. Gross, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"719764\"><a href=\"/opinion/719764/arzel-haley-v-boniface-gross-lieutenant-mckee-and-michael-ellis/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 643 n.33\n(7th Cir. 1996) (applying Farmer, 511 U.S. at 843) (uphold-\ning jury verdict for $1.65 million based on a finding that\nprison guards were deliberately indifferent by failing to\nrespond to a prisoner’s repeated request to be removed from\n\f14                                               No. 02-1961\n\ncell when his cellmate set fire to cell causing the cellmate’s\ndeath and plaintiff’s severe burns). Thus, it was Riccardo’s\nburden to show that Lt. Rausch actually knew that there\nwas a substantial risk that Garcia would harm Riccardo. Id.\nHowever, Lt. Rausch would be shielded from liability if no\nobjectively serious risk existed, he was unaware of the\nimpending risk, McGill, 944 F.2d at 349, or he took reason-\nable steps to abate it, whether successful or not, Farmer,\n511 U.S. at 844.\n  Admittedly, there is evidence in the record to support a\nfinding that Garcia did not objectively pose a substantial\nthreat to Riccardo—namely, the fact that Garcia was also\nplaced in segregation for “enemy protection,” allegedly from\nthe Latin Kings, and that Garcia had no history of sexual\nassault. However, that is not the standard by which this\ncase should be reviewed. The standard is whether there\nexists a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable\njury to find in favor of Riccardo. Payne, 146 F.3d at 432.\n  A jury could have reasonably believed that Lt. Rausch\nwas deliberately indifferent to the substantial risk of harm\nto Riccardo. It is undisputed that Garcia was a member of\nthe Latin Kings. In their first interaction, Riccardo pri-\nvately pulled Lt. Rausch aside and expressed his fear of\nbeing celled with Garcia. Thus, Riccardo has presented\nsufficient evidence to support the finding that Lt. Rausch\nwas made aware of the potential harm. See McGill, 944\nF.2d at 349. The jury could have further found that Lt.\nRausch’s decision to question Riccardo in front of Garcia\nwas not a reasonable way to abate the potential danger to\nRiccardo. Moreover, Lt. Rausch admitted that “[i]f\n[Riccardo] would have told me he feared for his life, if he\nrefused housing or thought there was a threat to his safe-\nty[,] he would not have been placed—they would not have\nbeen placed together.” Tr. III at 73. Thus, a jury could have\ndetermined that Lt. Rausch’s admission, coupled with his\nprior statements to Riccardo on May 28 that Riccardo could\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                    15\n\nnot turn down a housing assignment in segregation, and\nthat Riccardo could not be moved to another cell due to a\nlack of space, amounted to Lt. Rausch “deliberately”\navoiding learning that Riccardo was in danger.3 Such an\nanalysis avoids the use of ex post occurrences, such as the\nfact that Garcia did in fact assault Riccardo, to sustain a\nfinding of deliberate indifference. Moreover, the fact that\nLt. Rausch is able to point to evidence in the record to sup-\nport his position does not mandate reversal of the jury’s\nverdict. Our sole duty as an appellate court is to analyze\nwhether the record supports the jury’s determination. It is\nnot our function to reweigh the evidence. Knox, 93 F.3d at\n1332.\n  I am further troubled by the majority’s reliance on\nRiccardo’s second statement to Lt. Rausch (made in front of\nGarcia) to sustain overturning the jury’s verdict. As it\nstands, the deliberate indifference inquiry is an inherently\nfactual determination, Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842, which re-\nquires an “inquiry into a prison official’s state of mind,” id.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  Significantly, Riccardo was actually housed in the receiving unit\nas opposed to the segregation unit during the assault. The jury\nheard testimony that the receiving unit is only used to house\ninmates when the segregation unit is full. Tr. I at 24. Thus, Lt.\nRausch’s statement to Riccardo that there was no place else to\nhouse him carried even greater weight. The jury also heard tes-\ntimony that it would have required more work for Lt. Rausch to\nmove Riccardo from a cell in receiving to a cell in segregation due\nto the time of the alleged refusal and the occupancy of receiving\nand segregation, Tr. III at 75-77; further supporting Riccardo’s\nbelief that any additional complaints about his cell assignment\nwould have been futile. Finally, the jury was told a prisoner may\nbe moved from one cell to another at any time. Tr. I at 25. There-\nfore, the jury had ample evidence to support its finding that Lt.\nRausch’s actions rose to the level of deliberate indifference.\n\f16                                                    No. 02-1961\n\nat 837.4 Thus, whether this second statement is used to\nsupport the assertion that there was no “objective” risk to\nRiccardo or that Lt. Rausch was stripped of his “subjective”\nknowledge of the harm, it is clear that Lt. Rausch’s credibil-\nity and sincerity are integral components to the usefulness\nof this interaction. In essence, the majority accepts Lt.\nRausch’s assertion that his second discussion with Riccardo\nin front of Garcia was a sincere investigation of the poten-\ntial risk to Riccardo. However, the jury found otherwise.\nFurther, when asked to review the defendant’s Rule 50\nmotion, the district court aptly stated,\n     [T]here is ample evidence from which to conclude\n     that Rausch’s attempt to ascertain the seriousness\n     of the threat was mere pretense, and that because\n     he did not want to go to the extra effort to find dif-\n     ferent accommodations for Garcia, he recklessly\n     disregarded what he knew to be a dangerous situ-\n     ation. That decision to essentially disregard the\n     threat is where liability lies. A jury could have rea-\n     sonably inferred that Rausch crossed the line from\n\n\n4\n  The Supreme Court’s discussion only further highlights the\npropriety of allowing a jury to make this determination:\n     When instructing juries in deliberate indifference cases\n     with such issues of proof, courts should be careful to\n     ensure that the requirement of subjective culpability is\n     not lost. It is not enough to merely find that a reasonable\n     person would have known, or that the defendant should\n     have known, and juries should be instructed accordingly.\nId. at n.8; accord Lewis v.

[. . .]\n    [A] prison official will only be freed from liability if he\n    responded reasonably to the risk. As mentioned above,\n    Rausch’s method of questioning could be perceived as\n    deliberately forcing plaintiff to make a Hobson’s choice.\nRiccardo v. Rausch, No. 99-CV-372-CJP, at 15 (S.D. Ill. Mar. 7,\n2002) (order denying F.R.C.P. Rule 50(b) motion) (citations\nomitted) (emphasis in original). By taking Lt. Rausch at his\nword, the majority’s decision has the effect of immunizing\nprison officials from liability based on potentially unreasonable\nor contrived actions, and sanctions Lt. Rausch’s admittedly\nunreasonable behavior.\n  In an attempt to break the causal link between Lt. Rausch’s\nactions and the harm to Riccardo, the majority asserts that “the\nrisk that Riccardo professed to fear (a ‘hit’) did not come to\npass.” Majority opinion at 7. The inquiry, however, is not\nwhether “a hit” was actually put out on Riccardo as that would\nconstitute the sort of impermissible ex post determination\neschewed by the majority. Rather, the focus is solely on\nwhether Rausch was made aware that a substantial risk of\nsome type of danger existed prior to the actual event. See Haley,\n86 F.3d at 643 n.33. Under the majority’s analysis are we to\npresume that Riccardo’s pleas for protection would only guard\nagainst murder or physical beating? For the purposes of an\nEighth Amendment inquiry, in the prison context, I find no real\ndistinction between “a hit” and a sexual assault.\n  The majority also frees Lt. Rausch of liability based on\nthe assertion that Lt. Rausch was under no duty to foresee\n\f18                                                  No. 02-1961\n\nthat Riccardo would not complain to other prison officials\nbetween May 28, the date of Lt. Rausch and Riccardo’s\ninteraction, and May 30, when the assault actually took\nplace. The record reveals, however, that Garcia closely\nwatched Riccardo’s actions impeding Riccardo’s ability to\nhave a private conversation with prison guards outside of\nGarcia’s presence. Tr. I at 76-82; Tr. II at 42-43. Further,\nwhen Riccardo attempted to alert prison officials, Garcia\nresponded with escalating violence. Tr. II at 46-47. In light\nof Riccardo’s reasonable belief that he could not refuse his\nhousing assignment and that there was no other available\ncell, see note 3, supra, Riccardo did not realistically have\nthe ability to complain to other guards without alerting\nGarcia and incurring his wrath.\n  The majority’s decision to question the adequacy of\nRiccardo’s pleas for protection by requiring evidence con-\ncerning the overall number of sexual assaults at Centralia\nprison is also curious. See Lewis, 107 F.3d at 556 (Flaum,\nC.J., concurring) (“[T]he majority’s emphasis upon the\nadequacy of Lewis’s pleas for protection strikes me as\ninappropriate.”) The prison recognizes that “some prisoners\nare manipulative and cry ‘wolf’,” majority opinion at 5, and\nhas created a procedure to deal with this recurring possibil-\nity. A prisoner’s request for a cell transfer is always hon-\nored if the prisoner alleges a fear for his personal safety, Tr.\nI at 44, but the prison deals with potential frivolity by\ntreating every request as a potential disciplinary violation.\nId.5 Thus, the prison has created a procedure whereby a\nprisoner is moved first, and questions concerning the\nsincerity of the request are asked later. In addition, the\ninquiry under the Eighth Amendment is an individualized\none, i.e., Riccardo was required to prove, based on the\n\n\n5\n  Major Lawrence Jefferson was clear that “if [a prisoner is] just\nrefusing housing just to refuse housing with no reason, then we’ll\nmove him for that, but he’ll get a ticket for that.” Id.\n\fNo. 02-1961                                               19\n\nindividual facts of his case, that he was subjected to an\nobjectively serious harm and that Lt. Rausch was “aware of\nfacts from which the inference could be drawn that a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm exist[ed].” Farmer, 511\nU.S. at 838.\n  Finally, though unpursued by the majority, defendant\nargues that should a constitutional violation be found, he is\nnevertheless entitled to qualified immunity. According to\nRausch, previous case law must show that “no reasonable\nprison official would have believed it was constitutional\neither to cell an inmate with someone who gave conflicting\nanswers when asked (in the other inmate’s presence) if he\nhad a problem with that inmate, or to rely on a policy\nrequiring review of all placement decisions for suitability\nwithin hours.” Appellant’s Brief at 33. However, the\nSupreme Court in Hope v.

See id. at\n833; see also Haley, 86 F.3d at 646 (rejecting qualified\nimmunity defense in light of Farmer decision which further\nelucidated “deliberate indifference” standard).\n  In light of the aforementioned, I must agree with the trial\ncourt that a reasonable jury had ample evidence to sustain\nthis verdict and thus I respectfully dissent.\n\f20                                                 No. 02-1961\n\n  Before FLAUM, Chief Judge, and POSNER, EASTERBROOK,\nRIPPLE, MANION, KANNE, ROVNER, DIANE P.

Today, the court allows to\nstand the decision of a panel majority that imposes on\nprison inmates a new and impossibly high standard of proof\nfor establishing deliberate indifference in prison condition\ncases. The panel majority strongly suggests that, in order\nto show deliberate indifference, a prisoner must not only\nidentify with particularity the harm he fears but also\nbolster his own account with a special showing containing\nmaterial such as statistical evidence of a “strong correlation\nbetween prisoners’ professions and actual violence.”\nRiccardo v.

Rausch\nshould have appreciated a serious risk to Mr. Riccardo\nbecause the “risk from which Riccardo sought protection\nwas not realized.” Id. at 7-8. In short, in the panel major-\nity’s view, because Mr. Riccardo was raped, but not killed,\nLt. Rausch cannot be held liable for his failure to respond\nto Mr. Riccardo’s fears.\n  The Supreme Court in Farmer v.

The Court made\nclear that a prison official cannot escape\n    liability for deliberate indifference by showing that,\n    while he was aware of an obvious, substantial risk\n    to inmate safety, he did not know that the com-\n    plainant was especially likely to be assaulted by the\n    specific prisoner who eventually committed the\n    assault.

McKinney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112888\"><a href=\"/opinion/112888/helling-v-mckinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35\n\f22                                                No. 02-1961\n\n     (1993),] and it does not matter whether the risk\n     comes from a single source or multiple sources, any\n     more than it matters whether a prisoner faces an\n     excessive risk of attack for reasons personal to him\n     or because all prisoners in his situation face such a\n     risk.\nId. at 843 (emphasis added). Just as Mr. Riccardo did not\nneed to identify the member of the Latin Kings who would\nmete out the retaliatory action that he feared, he did not\nneed to identify the specific sort of bodily harm that would\nbe inflicted upon him. Indeed, our case law makes crystal\nclear that such precision with respect to identifying risks is\nnot required:\n     While there must be some link between the risk of\n     which the official was aware and the harm that\n     actually occurred—as it would be unfair to hold offi-\n     cials liable for risks they could not have anticipated\n     simply because they ignored other unrelated\n     risks—prison officials need not be specifically aware\n     of the precise risk that unfolds.\nHaley v.

Garcia, a\nmember of that gang, committed an act of physical violence\nupon Mr. Riccardo. The fact that Mr. Riccardo did not suffer\na worse fate does not negate the seriousness or the validity\nof the threat to Mr. Riccardo that was communicated to Lt.\nRausch.\n\n\n                              2.\n The panel majority further opines that Mr. Riccardo\nmight have overcome the infirmity in his case by showing\n     that there is a strong correlation between prisoners’\n     professions of fear and actual violence. How many\n     murders (or homosexual assaults) occur in Central-\n\fNo. 02-1961                                               23\n\n    ia (or the Illinois prison system) per hundred\n    inmate-years of custody? How many violent events\n    were preceded by requests for protection? How\n    many requests for protection were dishonored, yet\n    nothing untoward happened? Data along these lines\n    would have enabled a jury (and the court) to evalu-\n    ate actual risks. . . .\nRiccardo, slip op. at 9. Neither this court, other courts of\nappeals, nor the Supreme Court ever has required a show-\ning that expressed fears and violence were related in some\nstatistically significant way. It always has been sufficient\nthat the prisoner articulated his fear, that the prison\nofficial believed the inmate, but that the official failed to\ntake reasonable actions to protect the prisoner from harm.\nWe often have stated that\n    [i]f “the circumstances suggest that the defendant-\n    official being sued had been exposed to information\n    concerning the risk and thus ‘must have known’\n    about it, then such evidence could be sufficient to\n    permit a trier of fact to find that the defendant-\n    official had actual knowledge of the risk.”\nSanville v. McCaughtry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775041\"><a href=\"/opinion/775041/martha-sanville-individually-and-as-trustee-for-the-heirs-and-next-of-kin/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 737 (7th Cir. 2001)\n(quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842-43; emphasis added). The\nquestion of whether the prison official had the “requisite\nknowledge is a question of fact” reserved for the jury. Id.\nRequiring the sort of statistical evidence suggested by the\npanel majority in order to establish the existence of such a\nrisk imposes on inmates a practical burden that is im-\npossible for prisoners to meet. Prisoners certainly should\nnot be relieved of meeting their burden of proof, but, like\nother litigants, they ought to be permitted to come forward\nwith any evidence, direct or circumstantial, that is proba-\ntive of the knowledge of prison officials concerning threats\nreported to them. The judicial inquiry ought not be whether\nthere was statistical evidence from which a jury could\nconclude that the threat was “real” or should be taken\nseriously, but whether the record contains any evidence\n\f24                                                No. 02-1961\n\nfrom which the jury reasonably could conclude that the\nprison official knew that the prisoner was subject to a risk\nof serious harm. Moreover, there indeed may be times and\ncircumstances when the representation of the prisoner will\nbe a sufficient basis to require action on the part of the\nprison official. I see no reason for a categorical rule that,\nunder no circumstances, can such a representation be suf-\nficient.\n  There is no question that Mr. Riccardo articulated to Lt.\nRausch his fear of physical violence if celled with a member\nof the Latin Kings. In violation of Centralia’s own pol-\nicy—one presumably founded on a recognized correlation\nbetween complaints and violence—Lt. Rausch did not move\nMr. Riccardo to another cell; instead, Lt. Rausch forced Mr.\nRiccardo to articulate any concerns in the presence of the\nvery source of Mr. Riccardo’s fears, Garcia. As the district\ncourt determined in rejecting the defendant’s Rule 50\nmotion, there was\n     ample evidence from which to conclude that\n     Rausch’s attempt to ascertain the seriousness of the\n     threat was a mere pretense, and that because he\n     did not want to go to the extra effort to find dif-\n     ferent accommodations for Garcia, he recklessly\n     disregarded what he knew to be a dangerous situ-\n     ation. That decision to essentially disregard the\n     threat is where liability lies. A jury could have rea-\n     sonably inferred that Rausch crossed the line from\n     gross negligence to deliberate indifference based on\n     the ludicrousness of “asking” each inmate if he\n     had a problem with the other. Credibility had to\n     have been the key to the jury’s analysis, this Court\n     cannot interject its own credibility determinations;\n     and if it could, having observed both parties’ tes-\n     timony, it may very well have reached the same\n     conclusion as the jury.\nR.64 at 15-16.\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                 25\n\n   The panel majority makes clear its disagreement with the\njury’s view of the evidence. The evidence in favor of Mr.\nRiccardo may not be overwhelming, but it is certainly not\nlegally insufficient. When the evidence is viewed in the\nlight most favorable to Mr. Riccardo, as it must be, a jury\ncould reasonably conclude that Lt. Rausch knew of a serious\nrisk of harm to Mr. Riccardo but failed to take reasonable\nsteps to prevent it. The panel majority may have come to a\ndifferent conclusion if it had sat as the trier of fact, but its\ndisagreement in that respect is certainly not an appropriate\noccasion for revising Eighth Amendment and Rule 50\nstandards.\n  The panel majority opinion not only deprives Mr. Riccardo\nof his right to a jury trial, it also takes a very significant\nstep in depriving individuals incarcerated in this circuit of\na realistic opportunity to meet their burden of proof in these\ncases. I therefore respectfully dissent from the denial of\nrehearing en banc.\n\n\n\n\n  WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, with whom RIPPLE, ROVNER,\nand DIANE P. WOOD, Circuit Judges, join in dissenting from\nthe denial of rehearing en banc. The majority’s opinion has\nincorrectly resolved and unjustifiably reframed both the\nEighth Amendment standard for deliberate indifference as\nwell as the Rule 50 standard to set aside a jury verdict.\n  With regard to the Eighth Amendment inquiry, the\nmajority opinion highlights a major gap in the case law.\nParticularly, what is required to prove the objective prong\nof the deliberate indifference standard? The Court in\n\f26                                                No. 02-1961\n\nFarmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 834 n.3 (1994) did not\naddress this issue. On page 9, the majority asks a plethora\nof questions which go to this issue, i.e., the overall threat of\nviolence at the prison. Perhaps the dearth of case law on\nthis point is due in part to the general knowledge that\nprisons are dangerous places where rape and assault occur\nfrequently and therefore threats, such as the one in this\ncase, must be handled with more caution than exhibited by\nRausch. See Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003,42 U.S.C.\n§ 15601-02 (2004) (“The purpose of this chapter is to: (1)\nestablish a zero-tolerance standard for the incidence of\nprison rape in prisons in the United States. (6) increase the\naccountability of prison officials who fail to detect, prevent,\nreduce, and punish prison rape.”) (“Congress makes the\nfollowing findings: (2) Insufficient research has been\nconducted and insufficient data reported on the extent of\nprison rape. . . . Many inmates have suffered repeated as-\nsaults. (13) The high incidence of sexual assault within\nprisons involves actual and potential violations of the\nUnited States Constitution.”). Centralia Prison’s policy, to\nmove prisoners first and discipline them later for baseless\nrequests, is further proof of the objective danger. Again,\nevidence of the prison’s policy does not hold Rausch liable\nfor mere negligence; rather, it reflects the understood en-\nvironment in the prison, as accepted by prison officials,\nguards, and administrators, that threats of violence have a\nhigh probability of leading to attacks. Riccardo, therefore,\nproved that the asserted danger was objectively serious.\n  Under the more specific inquiry of Farmer’s subjective\nprong, the prison official must “deliberately disregard” a\npotential harm by being “aware of facts from which the\ninference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious\nharm exists, and [also] draw[ing] the inference.” Id. at 838.\nThis seems to me to create two questions: (1) what facts\nwere presented to Rausch, and (2) did he accept them as\ntrue or did his actions evince his intent to purposefully\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                 27\n\nignore those apparent facts? Once again, the inquiry is a\nparticularized one, focused on the officer’s knowledge.\nWithout repeating what I have already set out in my dis-\nsent, the jury was presented with evidence that Riccardo\ntold Rausch he did not want to be celled with Garcia be-\ncause he was in fear of an attack. “A prisoner normally\nproves actual knowledge of impending harm by showing\nthat he complained to prison officials about a specific threat\nto his safety.” McGill v. Duckworth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567976\"><a href=\"/opinion/567976/herbert-f-mcgill-plaintiff-appelleecross-appellant-v-jack-r-duckworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 349 (7th\nCir. 1991). Therefore, contrary to the majority’s assertion,\nthe first part of this inquiry is satisfied.\n  Accepting the majority’s point that Riccardo’s mere “say-\nso” is not enough to establish Eighth Amendment liability,\nthere were plenty of “objective indicators” to support the\njury’s finding that Rausch’s actions amounted to deliberate\nindifference. The jury heard evidence that Rausch put\nthe two men in front of each other to determine whether a\nproblem existed. It is this act, which the majority uses to\nexonerate Rausch from liability. However, it is this very act\nwhich evinces Rausch’s deliberate indifference as found by\nthe jury and reiterated by the district court. What is more,\nthis court has already defined such action as unacceptable\nunder the Eighth Amendment. Id. at 349 (reasoning that\nthe scienter requirement is satisfied when a prison guard,\n“[s]uspect[s] something is true but shut[s] [his] eyes for fear\nof what [he] will learn” or “[goes] out of [his] way to avoid\nacquiring unwelcomed knowledge”). The jury found that no\nreasonable guard would think that asking Riccardo to admit\nfear of Garcia with Garcia present, would illicit an honest\nresponse. Again, it is this act that crosses the line. Recog-\nnizing that these specific actions were inconsistent with the\nEighth Amendment would not create per se liability for\nprison officials. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the\ncourt’s decision not to rehear this case en banc.\n\f28                                        No. 02-1961\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                    ________________________________\n                    Clerk of the United States Court of\n                      Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n               USCA-02-C-0072—7-12-04\n\f</pre>",
