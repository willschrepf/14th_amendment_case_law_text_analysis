(RR: Vol. 60 p.\n\n77) On December 25, 2012 she went to pick up Shania at Ms. Dibrell’s house in the\n\nmorning and met the children’s father, Franklin Davis. (RR: Vol. 60 p. 79)\n\n      The witness testified that Shania was given a white blackberry cell phone by\n\nMs. Dibrell and Mr. Davis as partial payment for babysitting for them.

I just can’t have you right now.”\n\n(RR: Vol. 60 p. 87) She said they then went to Jennifer Dibrell’s house where she\n\ntold her that the children’s father was sending inappropriate text messages to her\n\ndaughter.

(RR: Vol. 60 p. 90)\n\n      Shania confided in Jasmine Adams and then spoke with Jasmine’s mother,\n\nShirley Brown. (RR: Vol. 60 p. 100) She met with the three woman and Shania told\n\nher that Franklin Davis had sexually assaulted her multiple times while she was\n\nbaby-sitting multiple times.

(RR: Vol. 60 p. 117)\n\nWhen she arrived at school she spoke with Shania on the phone and was told “Okay,\n\nMom, I’m wrapping up. I’ll be down in a little bit.” At approximately 4:20 she called\n\nher but didn’t get an answer. (RR: Vol. 60 p. 118)\n\n\n                                           2\n\f      A student showed her the physics room where Shania was having tutoring, but\n\nshe was not there.

(RR:\n\nVol. 68 p. 57) He said an escape is not necessarily a predictive factor that the person\n\nwill escape again. (RR: Vol. 68 p. 58) He said there will always be contraband and\n\ndrugs smuggled into prisons, but not every inmate is involved in illegal activity.\n\n                                          47\n\f(RR: Vol. 68 p. 60) He said that some inmates have what he calls “juice” and are the\n\ninmates have the power and control and intimidate other inmates.

(RR: Vol. 68 p. 61) He said the only reason they stay alive and well is\n\nbecause of the professionalism of the staff and the systems that are employed. (RR:\n\nVol. 68 p. 61)\n\n      He said that because of the underlying factors and as well as the offense he was\n\nconvicted of, the Defendant would be at the bottom of the list of having “juice” or\n\nhaving power.

(RR: Vol. 68 p. 62) He said that the Defendant will\n\nnot be an influence and his major issue with him would be keeping him alive if he\n\nwas ever exposed to the general population.

(RR: Vol. 68 p. 87) He thought the Defendant would go in as a G4\n\nwhich was fairly restrictive and would have an escape designation. (RR: Vol. 68 p.\n\n                                         48\n\f89) He said at the very best the Defendant would remain in this designation for a\n\nminimum of ten years. (RR: Vol. 68 p. 89) He said if he had a serious, violent\n\nincident against a staff member, the inmate is place in G5 which is the most\n\nrestrictive general population.(RR: Vol. 68 p. 89) He said that because of the\n\npremeditation of the act of assaulting the officer and escaping, the Defendant should\n\nbe placed in administrative segregation for a long time.

(RR: Vol. 68 p. 112) She said Frank was an excellent father who took care\n\nof Kurstyne needs and even her other children. (RR: Vol. 68 p. 112) She said her\n\nother daughter, Skyler, also called him “Dad.” (RR: Vol. 68 p. 112) She said Frank\n\n                                         49\n\falways came to Kurstyne’s birthday parties and was always there for her.

(RR: Vol. 68 p. 128) She said she\n\nwanted to come to court to see him and let the jury know that she loved him very\n\nmuch. (RR: Vol. 68 p. 128)\n\nThe State on Rebuttal in Punishment\n\n53) Testimony of Sherry Gray-James: Sherry Gray-James, mother of the deceased,\n\ntestified that on December 5th she received a phone call from Detective Dena\n\nWilliams of the Carrollton Police Department telling her that Frank Davis had\n\nescaped from custody.

(RR: Vol. 70 p. 20)\n\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\f                               SUMMARY OF ISSUES\n\n      Appellant raises issues in this brief that are categorized into the following\n\ngroups: I. Voir Dire Issues. Three issues on voir dire involving Appellant’s Batson\n\nchallenge. II. Pretrial Issues. In the fourth issue, Appellant argues that the trial court\n\nerred in dismissing Juror John Bigley, finding that he was disabled due to an\n\nemotional problem involving employment which conclusion was not supported by\n\nthe statement of facts. In the fifth issue Appellant argues that the trial court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to quash the indictment because the indictment failed to specify\n\nthe manner and means by which he allegedly committed the offense of obstruction\n\nwith sufficient specificity to allow Appellant to defend himself. Issue six is\n\nconcerned with the trial court’s error and abuse of discretion in denying Appellant’s\n\nmotion for continuance in order to develop information that defense counsel had just\n\nreceived about an extensive history of sexual abuse perpetrated on the Defendant. In\n\nIssues Nos. 7, 8, 9, and 10 Appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nmotion to suppress evidence which was obtained as a result of search warrants. III.\n\nGuilt/Innocence Issues. In the eleventh issue, Appellant argues the evidence\n\npresented at trial was insufficient to support the conviction for capital murder. In\n\nissue no. 12, Appellant argues that the trial court erred in overruling his objection two\n\nphotographs as being more prejudicial than probative. Appellant argues in Issue Nos.\n\n                                           51\n\f13-19 that the trial court erred in sustaining Defense Exhibits A-G which were\n\nrecordings made of the victim. Appellant sought to introduce these compilation of\n\nrecordings of the victim to support his defense that he did not commit the aggravating\n\noffense of obstruction which elevates this murder case to the potential death penalty\n\npunishment option. In issues nos. 20, 21, and 22 Appellant argues that the trial court\n\nerred in sustaining the State’s objection to the witness Arty Hayes, Ashley Sims and\n\nLamar Leggiton who were called by the defense. Appellant argues that the statements\n\nmade by Appellant to any of these three witnesses that the proffered evidence was\n\nadmissible as non hearsay prior consistent statements. In Issue 23 Appellant argues\n\nthat the trial court erred in denying Appellant’s request for a charge on anti-\n\nspeculation during the guilt/innocence stage of the trial. Appellant’s requested\n\ncharge to the jury not to base their verdict on speculation was a correct statement of\n\nthe law and should have been given to accurately guide the jury in its deliberations.\n\nAppellant argues in Issue No. 24 the trial court erred in overruling Appellant’s\n\nobjection to the State’s counsel’s jury argument when he struck at Appellant over\n\ndefense counsel’s shoulders and shifted the burden to Appellant. IV. Punishment\n\nIssues. Appellant has 18 objections to the language in the body of the Court’s\n\ninstructions to the jury in the punishment stage of the trial. In issues nos. 26 through\n\n35 involve Appellant’s objections to the punishment verdict form. V. Issues\n\n                                          52\n\finvolving constitutional challenges that have been previously raised and denied by\n\nthis Court in order to preserve these issues for possible future review in federal court.\n\n                                 VOIR DIRE ISSUES\n\n                            BATSON’ ISSUES NOS. 1-3\n\n                            APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 1\n\n      THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING APPELLANT’S\n      OBJECTION TO THE JURY PANEL BASED ON THE STATE’S\n      MISUSE OF ITS PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE IN REGARD TO\n      JUROR, SYRENE MITCHELL, IN VIOLATION OF THE DOCTRINE\n      ESTABLISHED IN BATSON V. KENTUCKY\n\n  (Appellant’s Issues Nos. 1-3 are grouped as each involves the same or similar\nissue of law. In each issue Nos. 1-3 Appellant argues that Appellant established a\n    ‘prima facie’ case for a ‘Batson’ objection. The Defendant is an African-\n     American. An objection by Appellant was made concerning the racially\n discriminatory manner in which the State exercised its peremptory challenges.)\n\n      Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Reporter’s Record\n\nVolume 53 page 26 at which the trial court conducted a ‘Batson’ Hearing. Appellant\n\nobjected to the State’s strike against Syrene Mitchell, an African-American (RR: Vol.\n\n53 p. 26) . The trial court denied Appellant’s Batson Challenge. (RR: Vol. 53 p.29)\n\n      In reviewing the qualification stage of voir dire, the record shows that the State\n\nchallenged this juror; however, the trial court denied their challenge and the juror was\n\nqualified. (RR: Vol. 22 p. 157) Mr. Mitchell had previously been a grand juror on a\n\ngrand jury and stated that his grand jury had true billed two capital murder cases. Mr.\n\n                                          53\n\fMitchell testified that his nephew was a police officer in New Orleans. (RR: Vol. 22\n\np. 94) He further testified that, as he wrote on his questionnaire, he would follow the\n\nlaw. (RR: Vol. 22 p. 96) When explaining why he circled number 3 on the second\n\nquestion of the questionnaire he stated (RR: Vol. 22 p. 99) :\n\n   A. Well, that’s a - - It’s sort of a - - The was I feel about the death penalty, in some\ncases I thing the death penalty should be imposed. In other cases, I do not. My\ndecision would be based on the type of trial and the type - - the type of murder, if\nmurder occurred and there was evidence to support that murder. The evidence has to\nbe there.\n   Q. Yeah, that make sense. We’re going to talk about the burden of proof that we\nhave as prosecutors on this case because you know that we are - - it’s our job to prove\nthe case. The State of Texas has the burden of proof in this.\n\n      Mr. Mitchell stated that there were some cases that were worthy of the death\n\npenalty, for example, “an innocence child being molested and killed, for whatever\n\nreason, by an older person. Those are the kind I would draw the line on.” (RR: Vol.\n\n22 p. 105-106) Appellant submits that this should have been the type of juror the\n\nState would want on the jury given the young age of the victim and the underlying\n\noffense of sexual assault. Concerning his religious beliefs, Mr. Mitchell stated (RR:\n\nVol. 22 p. 118):\n\n   A. I certainly don’t have any religious beliefs against capital - - capital murder.\nI’m not one of those types of individuals. I look at everything that’s involved, the\nevidence, but my religious affiliations with my particular church has nothing to do\nwith it.\n\n\n\n\n                                           54\n\f      When asked to explain his answer of “uncertain” to the statement “The death\n\npenalty should be abolished” the following occurred (RR: Vol. 22 p. 127):\n\n\n   A. It’s kind of like middle of the road. It’s kind of, like, middle of the road. I\ndon’t necessarily agree the death penalty should be abolished. Here, again, it\ndepends on whatever situation that occurs. As I stated earlier, certain situations, in\nmy opinion, warrant the death penalty, and other situations do not.\n   Q. And those situations that warrant the death penalty, are you - - are you the type\nof person that could give the death penalty?\n   A. Yes.\n\n      When asked on the questionnaire if he had “ any moral, religious or personal\n\nbeliefs that would prevent you from sitting in judgement of another human being”,\n\nMr. Mitchell checked the answer “no.” (Questionnaire p. 2) He also checked the\n\nanswer “no” when asked in the following question “Do you have any moral, religious\n\nor personal beliefs that would prevent you from returning a verdict which would\n\nresult in the execution of another human being?” Appellant submits that 21 of the\n\njurors accepted by the State answered these two questions with the same answer. Ms.\n\nKaren Coyne, No. 141A, who was seated on the jury, answered Question No. 3 as\n\n“yes” and commented that it was a very serious position to be in and the evidence\n\nwould need to be very compelling to convict any individual of murder. Furthermore,\n\nMr. Mitchell agreed that the intentional murder of an individual during the course of\n\ncommitting or attempting to commit the offense of obstruction should be a capital\n\n\n\n                                         55\n\foffense, as did all jurors accepted by the State. He had not heard about the case as\n\ndid sixteen jurors accepted by the State. When asked to rank how strongly he\n\nbelieved in using the death penalty, he ranked himself a 6. (Questionnaire P. 5)\n\nAppellant submits that Daniel Rudnisky, Brenda Morgan, Josh Stephens, Donald\n\nReeves and Kelly Cook, all jurors accepted by the State, ranked themselves a six or\n\nlower. Mr. Mitchell was a qualified juror who supported the death penalty. Appellant\n\nargues that the record supports his claim that this juror was qualified as to imposition\n\nof the death penalty and had answers similar to other jurors who were qualified as\n\njurors.\n\n                           APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 2\n\n    THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING APPELLANT’S\nOBJECTION TO THE JURY PANEL BASED ON THE STATE’S MISUSE OF\n  ITS PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE IN REGARD TO JUROR, LOUISE\n  HORSLEY, IN VIOLATION OF THE DOCTRINE ESTABLISHED IN\n                   BATSON V. KENTUCKY\n\n      Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Reporter’s Record\n\nVolume 43 page 19 at which the trial court conducted a ‘Batson Hearing’. Appellant\n\nobjected to the State’s strike against Louise Horsley (RR: Vol. 53 p. 26) . The trial\n\ncourt denied Appellant’s Batson Challenge. (RR: Vol. 53 p.29)\n\n      The State did not challenge Ms. Horsely during the qualification voir dire.\n\n(RR: Vol. 33 p. 73) The State argued that the reason they struck Ms. Horsely was\n\n                                          56\n\fbecause she circled a three on question number two on the juror questionnaire. (RR:\n\nVol. 53 p. 29) During the qualification stage of voir dire the testimony of Ms.\n\nHorsely showed that she was a qualified juror who could assess the death penalty.\n\nWhen the State explained the process of putting a person to death, she stated (RR:\n\nVol. 33 p. 28):\n\n   A. I could be a part of that decision and I did put some of the instances where I\nthought that the death penalty was justified. So it would have to based upon the facts\nand information that I heard as to whether or not I would decide for the death penalty\nor not.\n   Q. And I understand that.\n   A. But I could make that decision under the right circumstances and depending on\nthe evidence. I could make that decision.\n\n\n      Ms. Horsely spent twenty years in the United States Air Force before retiring.\n\nShe taught students in DISD the game of chess and some of her students won\n\nchampionships. (RR: Vol. 33 p. 48) Ms. Horsely agreed with the punishment range\n\nfor the intentional murder of person during the course of committing or attempting to\n\ncommit the offense of obstruction. (Questionnaire p. 4) All jurors accepted by the\n\nState also agreed with question number 12 of the questionnaire. Ms. Horsely thought\n\nthat the death penalty had not been applied fairly and had been misused.\n\n(Questionnaire p. 5-6) Appellant submits that jurors Eric Hoy, Beth Cummings and\n\nWilliam Dawson who were accepted by the State had similar answers to Ms. Horsely.\n\n\n\n                                         57\n\fAppellant submits that Ms. Horsely was an intelligent, articulate woman who would\n\nhave been able to assess the death penalty. Appellant argues that the record supports\n\nhis claim that this juror was qualified as to imposition of the death penalty and had\n\nanswers similar to other jurors who were qualified as jurors.\n\n                           APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 3\n\n     THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING APPELLANT’S\nOBJECTION TO THE JURY PANEL BASED ON THE STATE’S MISUSE OF\n  ITS PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE IN REGARD TO JUROR, FREDDIE\n    WATSON, IN VIOLATION OF THE DOCTRINE ESTABLISHED IN\n                    BATSON V. KENTUCKY\n\n\n      Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Reporter’s Record\n\nVolume 43 page 19 at which the trial court conducted a ‘Batson Hearing’. Appellant\n\nspecifically objected to the State’s strike against Freddie Watson (RR: Vol. 53 p.26) .\n\nThe trial court denied Appellant’s Batson Challenge. (RR: Vol. 53 p. 31) The State\n\nstated that they struck Mr. Watson because he had heard about the case and wrote on\n\nhis questionnaire that “life with parole would be better for me.” (RR: Vol. 53 p. 29-\n\n30) The State also argued that Mr. Watson wanted people charged with crimes to go\n\nfree while the case was ongoing. (RR: Vol. 53 p. 30)\n\n      Concerning the State’s assertion that they struck Mr. Watson in part because he\n\nwrote on his questionnaire “life with parole would be better for me” after answering\n\n\n\n                                          58\n\fthe question on punishment range on killing a witness, Appellant submits the answers\n\ngiven by Mr. Watson when asked about killing a witness as rising to the level of\n\ncapital murder, Mr. Watson stated (RR: Vol. 38 p. 21):\n\n       Q. . . ..But if you’re saying killing a witness, that doesn’t rise to the level, to\nme, of what a capital murder is that has that punishment range of the death sentence.\nHow do you feel about that?\n    A. I think it does.\n    Q. It does?\n    A. I think it does. If you kill a witness or some potential witness testifying against\nsomebody, and it’s proven that they’re responsible for it, yeah, I think that could be\nclassified as a capital murder.\n    Q. Classified as a capital murder that could have one of those two punishment\nranges if everyone lines up where it’s life without the possibility of parole or the\ndeath sentence if the facts fit that?\n    A. Right.\n    Q. Why do you think that?\n    A. Well, because there’s you know, just other avenues that a person can take. It\nwould seem like to me that to get rid of somebody for the sole case of not being able\nto testify against you, like I say, to me it just rises to the standard of a capital murder.\n\n\n      When Mr. Watson asked the prosecutor about a person being locked up until\n\ntheir trial, the State explained how a person could post bond and the reasoning for\n\nrequiring a bond. (RR: Vol. 38 p. 48-49) Mr. Watson repeatedly agreed the State,\n\nreplying “right” when it was explained to him.\n\n      Mr. Watson circled 2 on the second question concerning which statement\n\nrepresents his feelings on the death penalty. The second statement is “I believe that\n\nthe death penalty is appropriate in some murder cases, and I could return a verdict in\n\n                                            59\n\fa proper case which assessed the death penalty. (Questionnaire p. 1) All Twenty-two\n\njurors accepted by the State also circled 2 on the second question of the\n\nquestionnaire. When asked on the questionnaire if he had “ any moral, religious or\n\npersonal beliefs that would prevent you from sitting in judgement of another human\n\nbeing”, Mr. Watson checked the answer “no.” (Questionnaire p. 2) He also checked\n\nthe answer “no” when asked in the following question “Do you have any moral,\n\nreligious or personal beliefs that would prevent you from returning a verdict which\n\nwould result in the execution of another human being?”\n\n      Appellant submits that 21 of the jurors accepted by the State answered these\n\ntwo questions with the same answer. Ms. Karen Coyne, No. 141A, who was seated\n\non the jury, answered Question No. 3 as “yes” and commented that it was a very\n\nserious position to be in and the evidence would need to be very compelling to\n\nconvict any individual of murder. Appellant argues that this shows that Mr. Watson\n\nwas a stronger supporter of the death penalty than Ms. Coyne, a white woman. Mr.\n\nWatson checked “yes” when asked if he was in favor of the death penalty and further\n\nstated “Some crimes are so bad that whoever committed it, man or woman, deserve to\n\ndie.” (Questionnaire p. 1) Appellant submits that Mr. Watson was a strong proponent\n\nfor the death penalty. Mr. Watson had not heard about the case. (Questionnaire p. 4)\n\nSix of the jurors accepted by the State had heard about the case and one, Jose Vega,\n\n                                         60\n\fwrote that he had heard about the case on television and had discussed it with friends.\n\n(Questionnaire p. 4) On question number 15, a scale from 1 to 10 with 1 being the\n\nleast and 10 being most, Mr. Watson circled 8 as how strongly he believed in the\n\ndeath penalty. (Questionnaire p. 5) Nine jurors accepted by the State circled No. 8\n\nand six jurors accepted by the State circled numbers lower than 8 as to how strongly\n\nthey supported the death penalty.\n\n       In reviewing the qualification stage of voir dire, the record shows that the State\n\ndid not challenge Mr. Watson for cause. (RR: Vol. 38 p. 92) Appellant argues that\n\nthe record supports his claim that this juror was qualified as to imposition of the\n\ndeath penalty and had answers similar to other jurors who were qualified as jurors.\n\n                     ARGUMENT AS TO ALL IMPROPERLY\n                       STRUCK JURORS BY THE STATE\n\n       Appellant submits that three of the six “qualified” minority members were\n\nstruck by the State. Defense counsel made the following argument (RR: Vol. 53 p.\n\n26):\n       MR. PARKS: We object to the composition of the jury, Your Honor, for the\nfollowing reasons. There were six potential African-American jurors within the\nstrike range that we reached, Of those, the defense struck one, the very first juror, that\nbeing Johnson.\n    Two jurors, African-American jurors are actually seated. And the State struck\nthree African-American jurors, 50 percent of the available panel. That would be\nNumber 15, Syrene Mitchell, Number 27, Louise Horsely, and Number 34, Freddie\nWatson.\n\n\n\n                                          61\n\f   Fifty percent of the panel, we would suggest to the Court, shows a prima facie\ncase of a Batson violation. And we would ask that these three jurors be seated.\n\n      Appellant submits that the record supports the claim that the State violated the\n\nequal protection clause of the United States Constitution when it used its peremptory\n\nstrikes against potential jurors Syrene Mitchell, Louise Horsley and Freddie Watson\n\nin a racially discriminatory manner contrary to the holding of Batson v. Kentucky,\n\n476 U. S. 79, 106 S. C. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1988). The State’s proffered reasons\n\nfor being neutral were in fact a pretext. See Lopez v. State, 940 S. W. 2d 388 (Tex.\n\nApp.-Austin, 1997); Musick v. State, 862 S.W. 2d 794 (Tex. App. – El Paso 1999);\n\nRamirez v. State, 862 S. W. 2d 648 (Tex. App. – Dallas 1993); Esteves v. State, 859\n\nS. W. 2d 613 (Tex. App. – Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, pet. ref’d) and Everson v. State,\n\n851 S. W. 2d 269 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993)\n\n      The answers given by these three prospective jurors were similar to answers\n\ngiven by the non minority jurors as described in the three previous issues.\n\n      The Defendant has shown purposeful discrimination pursuant to Miller-El v.\n\nCockrell, 537 U.S. 322 (2003) The exercise of even one peremptory challenge for\n\nracial reasons invalidates the entire jury selection and mandates a new trial. See.\n\nLinscomb v. State, 829 S. W. 2d 164, 166 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992); Keeton v. State,\n\n724 S. W. 2d 58, 65 n. 5 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987) The aggrieved party need not show\n\n\n\n                                          62\n\fmultiple instances of racial prejudice in jury selection to prove a constitutional\n\nviolation. Linscomb at 166. Either of the three strikes by the State, or all together,\n\ninvalidate the jury selection process and mandate a new trial based on Appellant’s\n\n‘Batson’ objections.\n\n      Under Batson, one should be concerned with the question of whether the State\n\nwas racially motivated in the exercise of its peremptory challenges against even one\n\njuror of discernable race. Linscomb, at 167. Each of the prosecutor’s explanations\n\nshould be examined to determine whether the evidence supports the so-called\n\n“neutral” reasons for the strike or whether they are merely a pretext for a racially\n\nmotivated peremptory challenge. Whitsey v. State, 796 S. W. 2d 707, 713 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1989)\n\n             COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS—DISPARATE TREATMENT\n\n      The trial judge’s decision on whether the Appellant proves a Batson claim\n\nturns, in part, on the trial court’s observations during voir dire examination. As the\n\nvoir dire supervisor, the trial judge can readily perceive discrepancies during jury\n\nselection process. These discrepancies may include:\n\n      (1) the prosecutor failing to question any of the minority jurors yet striking\nthem anyway;\n      (2) the prosecutor striking minority jurors who gave answers similar to those of\nmajority jurors whom the prosecutor did not strike; and\n\n\n\n                                           63\n\f        (3) the prosecutor striking minority jurors who had the same characteristics\nprofessionally, socially, religiously, etc. as majority jurors whom the prosecutor did\nnot strike.\n\n      These factors may show disparate treatment of prospective jurors. These\n\nfactors should enter into the trial judge’s assessment of the prosecutor’s credibility\n\nand eventually the trial judge’s determination of the racial neutrality of the\n\nprosecutor’s peremptory challenges. See Young v. State, 826 S. W. 2d 141, 145 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1999).\n\n      In Young v. State, it was held that where the record shows there exists a\n\ndisparate treatment in the use of a valid reason for the use of peremptory strikes, as in\n\nthis case, then the trial court erred in its denial of the Batson challenge as the clearly\n\nerroneous standard is satisfied, as in this case where the only distinguishable factor,\n\nafter a careful reading of the voir dire of all the jurors, between the jurors is race. The\n\nevidence in this case indicates that the trial judge erred in allowing the prosecution to\n\nstrike three jurors on the basis of race, despite the rationale offered by the State to\n\ncover its true motivation. See Ramirez v. State, 862 S. W. 2d 648 (Tex. App. – Dallas\n\n1993). The State used 3 of its 12 peremptory strikes to eliminate 50% of the African-\n\nAmericans on the qualified prospective jury panel. (RR: Vol. 43 p. 19)\n\n      The Court in Greer v. State, No. 05-08-00146 (Tex. App.-Dallas June 9, 2009)\n\nfound it significant that the State in that case struck 100% of the African-American\n\n\n                                           64\n\fjurors. That Court referenced Miller-El in stating, “This remarkable disproportionate\n\nuse of peremptory strikes weighs heavily in our analysis.” The Supreme Court in\n\nMiller-El stated that striking 10 of 11 available African-Americans were\n\n“remarkable” and not likely caused by “[h]appenstance.” The fact that the State’s\n\nreasons for striking these minority veniremembers were, in large part, applied to\n\nother panel members who were not struck is evidence of pretext. See Miller-El,\n\nsupra and Snyder v. Louisiana, 128 S.Ct. 1203 (2008). The disparate-treatment\n\nevidence in this case is strongly reinforced by the State’s disproportionate use of\n\nperemptory strikes against African- Americans, just as it was in Greer.\n\n      In this case the trial court unreasonably failed to apply clearly established law\n\nto the facts by failing to examine not just the validity of the reason but the credibility\n\nof the prosecutor. See Hayes v. Thaler, 361, Fed App. 563 (C.A.5 (Tex.)) 2010 WL\n\n183395 citing Miller-El v. Drekte, 545 U.S. 231 (2005) and Reed v. Quaterman, 555\n\nF3d 304 (45th Cir.2009) .\n\n      In Reed v.Quarterman, ibid, there is relevant discussion concerning the third\n\nstep in evaluating a ‘Batson Claim’ for purposeful discrimination. The Fifth Circuit\n\nCourt of Appeals stated that:\n\n   “implausible or fantastic justifications may (and probably will) be found to be\npretexts for purposeful discrimination” citing Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765 (1995).\n\n\n\n                                           65\n\f        For these reasons Appellant submits reversible error is present based on a\n\nconstitutional violation that requires reversal.\n\n                                  PRETRIAL ISSUES\n\n                             APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 4\n\n        THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DISMISSING JUROR NUMBER 4,\n                 JOHN BIGLEY, FROM THE JURY PANEL\n\n\n        Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to RR: Vol. 56 page 5 at\n\nwhich hearing was held to determine under article 36.29(b) C.C.P. whether juror No.\n\n4, John Bigley, had become disabled. The Court stated that the juror was adamant\n\nthat because of his work situation he simply did not feel like he would be able to be\n\nfair and impartial to both sides and to carefully weigh the evidence because his mind\n\nwould be elsewhere.\n\n        The juror was examined by State’s counsel and defense counsel. (RR: Vol. 56\n\np.12)\n\n        The Texas Constitution requires a jury in a felony criminal trial to be\n\ncomposed of twelve members. TEX. CONST. Art. V, sec. 13. The Texas\n\nConstitution further provides, however, that “when, pending the trial of any case, one\n\nor more jurors not exceeding three, may die or be disabled from sitting, the remainder\n\nof the jury shall have the power to render the verdict; provided, that the Legislature\n\n\n                                           66\n\fmay change or modify the rule authorizing less than the whole number of the jury to\n\nrender a verdict.” Id. Article 36.29 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure tracks\n\nthe language of the Constitution and provides that “ not less than twelve jurors can\n\nrender and return a verdict in a felony case.” Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. Art.\n\n36.29(a) (Vernon Supp. 1999) However, the legislature has limited the number of\n\njurors who can be excused due to death or disability during the pendency of a trial in\n\na felony case to one. Id.\n\n      A juror is disabled only when the juror is physically, emotionally or mentally\n\nimpaired in some way which hinders his ability to perform his duty as a juror. See\n\nBrooks v. State, 990 S.W.2d 278, 286 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S.\n\n956, 120 S.Ct. 384, 145 L.Ed.2d 300 (1999). The determination as to whether a juror\n\nis disabled is within the discretion of the trial court. See id. whether a juror is\n\ndisabled is within the discretion of the trial court. See id. Absent an abuse of that\n\ndiscretion, no reversible error will be found. See id.\n\n      The time-line of when this inquiry as to the juror’s status took place is relevant.\n\nThe jury apparently when he filled out his questionnaire was unemployed. He\n\nbecame employed and apparently knew of the pending trial date. He was\n\nunconcerned about attending some seminars or workshops at Microsoft in September.\n\n\n\n\n                                           67\n\fThere was a pending motion for continuance by the defense at the time of the\n\nhearing. The continuance was granted and trial was held on November 11, 2013.\n\n      The decision to discharge a juror under article 36.29(a) lies within the trial\n\ncourt’s discretion. However, the trial court’s power to discharge a juror for a\n\ndisability is limited to those instances where there exists some physical illness,\n\nmental condition, or emotional state which hinders the juror’s ability to perform his\n\nduties. Landrum v. State, 788 S.W.2d 577, 579 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990); Hughes v.\n\nState, 787 S.W.2d 193, 195 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 190, pet. ref’d). A juror may\n\nnot be discharged because of bias or prejudice against the defendant or against the\n\nlaw applicable to the case. Landrum,, 788 S.W.2d 579.\n\n      The trial court in the case at bar found that the juror was disabled due to an\n\nemotional problem involving employment. That conclusion is not supported by the\n\nstatement of facts. The record contains no evidence that Juror Bigley was so\n\nemotionally distraught about being able to serve as a juror that his concern amounted\n\nto an emotion problem as in the case of Freeman v. State, 838 S.W. 2d 772 (Tex.\n\nApp. Corpus Christi 1992).\n\n      A review of the testimony shows that defense counsel summarized his\n\nobjection to the proposed dismissal of juror, Bigley as (RR: Vol. 56 p. 78-79):\n\n\n\n\n                                          68\n\f       ...\n       MR. JOHNSON: I want to take a moment to address our Juror Number 6, Mr.\nBigley, and some of his testimony that he gave to the Court yesterday.\n    The Court was kind enough to give us a transcript of his voir dire testimony. And\non page 12 of that, that is where the issue of his schedule is addressed. And he tells\nus that he has a new job and that he is the channel manager for Microsoft. He’s\nworking for a new company.\n    And his big concern at that time, what he told us, was that he needed to be\nfinished with our trial in time to take some seminars in early September with\nMicrosoft.\n    He never said - - he basically told us yesterday that he told us all of these things\nabout how, well - - that he was going to have all of this stuff afterwards and he was\ngoing to be concerned about.\n    All he said - - told us was that he was concerned about seminars with Microsoft in\nSeptember. He’s going to be able to do that.\n    And I will also point out to the Court, number one, based on his testimony and his\ncross-examination, or whatever you want to call it with Mr. – with Phillip Hayes\nyesterday, he indicated to the Court that, yes, he could still do this and that he could\ngive his attention to this trial.\n    That he would have to work around it. And we think he is still capable of being a\njuror on this. I don’t think that he got to the point where he would be excused.\n    And another big concern would be that, you know, it is going to leave us with just\none alternate I we let him go.\n    And if we start having other jurors coming down here and start telling us, I’m just\nworried about the precedent this would set if we start letting these people off just\nbecause they say that they’ve got some issues with work, which are not legal issues to\nbe excused from the jury at this point.\n    He is now a juror. He is not a prospective juror. He is a juror now, and I think the\nrules are a little different for him. And I just want to point out to the Court that what\nhe told us yesterday is not consistent with what he said he told us at his interview.\n\n      Appellant submits that the trial court’s inquiry into the emotional state of the\n\njuror in question did not go far enough to establish the fact that the juror was so\n\nemotionally unfit that it impaired his ability to continue. It is obvious from the initial\n\ninquiry that the juror was aware of the trial date when he became employed.\n\n                                           69\n\f         Appellant submits that there was no inquiry as to postponement of the\n\nproceeding if the continuance was granted; which would allow the juror to address\n\nhis concerns. The issue is of constitutional dimension as to the right of the accused\n\nto have his case determined by the twelve people selected and to not have its jury\n\nselection strategy destroyed by a subsequent employment issue that was actually\n\nresolved with the granting of defendant’s continuance. Therefore, the court abused\n\nits discretion in dismissing this juror without full development of the issue; an action\n\nwhich violated Appellant’s constitutional right and was harmful to his right to a fair\n\ntrial.\n\n                             APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 5\n\n            THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT’S\n                  MOTION TO QUASH THE INDICTMENT\n\n\n         Appellant directs this Honorable court’s attention to Reporter’s Record\n\nVolume 58 at which a hearing was heard on Defendant’s Motion to Quash the\n\nIndictment. See also Clerk’s Record Volume 3 pp. 127-128. The trial court\n\ncharacterized the challenge to the indictment was that “the term “obstruction” in the\n\nindictment in and of itself is not sufficient to give you the required due process notice\n\nso that you can prepare an adequate defense.” The motion was denied. (RR: Vol. 58\n\np. 6)\n\n\n                                           70\n\f         The indictment in this case states in relevant part as follows:\n\n   On or about the 6th day of September A.D. 2012 in the County of Dallas and said\nState, did unlawfully then and there intentionally cause the death of SHANIA GRAY,\nan individual, hereinafter called deceased by SHOOTING THE DECEASED WITH\nA FIREARM, A DEADLY with a FIREARM, a DEADLY WEAPON, AND BY\nASPHYXIATING THE DECEASED, and the defendant was then and there in the\ncourse of committing and attempting to commit the offense of OBSTRUCTION.\n\n      V.T.P.C. Penal Code § 36.06 defines the offense of Obstruction or Retaliation\n\n(a)      A person commits an offense if he intentionally or knowingly harms or\n         threatens to harm another by an unlawful act:\n      (1) in retaliation for or on account of the service or status of another as:\n         (A) public servant, witness, prospective witness, or informant; or\n         (B) person who has reported or who the actor knows intends to report the\n         occurrence of a crime;\n         or\n      (2) to prevent or delay the service of another as a :\n         (A) public servant, witness, prospective witness, or informant; or\n         (B) person who has reported or who the actor know intends to report the\n         occurrence of a crime.\n         ...\n\n         The Court of Criminal Appeals has pointed out that section 36.06(a)(1)(A) has\n\neight different elements, several of which have distinct alternatives that may or may\n\nnot be included in an indictment. Cada v. State, 334 S.W.3d 766, 770 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2011); See also TEX. Penal Code § 36.06(a)(1)(A).\n\n         Appellant argues that the indictment fails to allege an offense against Mr.\n\nDavis with that degree of certainty that will give him notice of the particular offense\n\nwith which he is charged in violation of Art. 21.11 C.C.P. and fails to inform\n\n\n                                             71\n\fDefendant of the nature and cause of the accusation against him in violation of Art. 1,\n\nSec. 10 of the Constitution of the State of Texas, and the Sixth Amendment and Due\n\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States\n\nin that said indictment fails to specify the manner and means by which he allegedly\n\ncommitted the offense of obstruction with sufficient specificity to allow Defendant to\n\ndefend himself.\n\n      The phrase “in the course of committing and attempting to commit the offense\n\nof OBSTRUCTION does not place this Defendant on notice of what part of Art.\n\n36.06, TEX PENAL CODE he is supposed to have violated, who was obstructed, and\n\nwhy. Consequently, the indictment does not set forth in plain and intelligible\n\nlanguage sufficient information to enable the accused to prepare his defense. A\n\nmotion to quash should be granted where the language in the charging instrument\n\nconcerning the defendant’s conduct is so vague or indefinite as to deny him effective\n\nnotice of the acts allegedly committed. Haecker v. State, 571 S.W.2d 920 (Tex.\n\nCrim.App 1978); Adams v. State, 707 S.W.2d 900 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986)\n\n      Therefore, Appellant was denied due process of law pursuant to the 14th\n\nAmendment of the United States Constitution because he was denied the proper\n\nnotice of allegations to which he would be required to defend against. This denied\n\nhim a fair trial. The only proper remedy is to grant him a new trial.\n\n\n                                          72\n\f                           APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 6\n\n      THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED IT’S DISCRETION\n  IN DENYING APPELLANT’S MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE FILED ON\n                      NOVEMBER 1, 2013\n\n\n      Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Clerk’s Record pp. 137-\n\n140 and Reporter’s Record Volume 60 pp. at which Defense Counsel presented a\n\nmotion for continuance to develop information that he had received in the afternoon\n\nof October 31, 2013 about an extensive history of sexual abuse perpetrated on the\n\nDefendant. Counsel argued that this category of information was very relevant and\n\nmust be investigated for both the guilt/innocence and punishment stage of the trial.\n\n      The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that any death penalty\n\nproceeding must fully consider the defendant’s mental capacity, whether for the\n\npurpose of determining whether the defendant has adequate mental capacity to be\n\ntried, e.g. Cooper v. Oklahoma, 517 U.S. 348, 354 (1996), or for full consideration by\n\njurors as a mitigating factor, e.g. Penry v. Johnson, 532 U.S. 782, 796-797 (2001).\n\nThe trial court denied the Defendant a fair and non prejudicial procedural process in\n\norder to show mitigating evidence of the defendant’s extensive history of sexual\n\nabuse.

The trial court issued an order denying the motion. Clerk’s Record Vol. 3 p. 71,\n\n82 and 97. During the guilt/innocence stage of trial defense counsel reurged this\n\nmotion (RR: Vol. 60 p. 239-241)\n\n      Trial Counsel made the following argument:\n\n    MR. JOHNSON: Now, the affidavits in each those three search warrants are\nidentical except for a little additional language in the affidavit for the search of the\ncar.\n    Basically, let’s start with the search warrant for the DNA, the buccal swab. The\nfirst problem that the State has with that search warrant is that it alleges no crime. It\ndoesn’t set out that the crime has been committed. There’s some language that says\nthat there’s a missing person, but that is the extent of it. No crime - - no crime is\nalleged.\n    Then you go into the probable cause part of the search warrant, and the search\nwarrant is based on the fact that they got exigent access to some phone records for\nShania Gray. And when they got those, they saw that there was another phone\nnumber on there that has a 903 area code.\n                                           75\n\f    They saw that that 903 - - then they got exigent circumstances request for\ninformation on the 903 phone number, and saw that another person had been called\nfrom that phone.\n    And so they called that other phone number and spoke to a person that identified\nhimself as Shamica Mosley. Now, obviously, this is just a phone call to somebody\nthat answered th phone. They have no prior knowledge of this person.\n    This person said that they’re - - who they are, and then they say that, yes. They got\na phone call, and that they believe that that person could have been Frank Davis.\nAnd they base that on the fact that they have a - - this Shamica, this person they’re\ntalking to, has a girlfriend that is in a dating relationship with a person named Frank\nDavis.\n    And she claims that this person who talked to her said something that led her to\nbelieve that it was Frank Davis, but it doesn’t allege what it was that they said.\nThere’s nothing about this person that would suggest that there’s any reason to\nbelieve that this individual, Shamica Mosley, is credible or that what they tell them\nactually helps them in any way.\n    And then it goes on to say that the two phone numbers, the ones for Shania, and\nthe one - - the 903 number that they now believe, based on Shamica Mosley saying it\ncould have been Frank Davis, they find that those two phone numbers were in the\nsame proximity. But we - - that is the only - -the word they used was proximity.\nQuite frankly, I’m not sure that that actually connects the in any way at all. All\nphones are in the same proximity, I guess, if they talk to each other.\n    The only other thing that they have in there is that they say they have become\naware that the defendant, Franklin Davis, is - - is somebody that is accused of a\nsexual offense - - sexual assault offense of this- - this girl that is now a missing\nperson.\n    The last problem that they have - - and I tell the Court - - I say the Court - - I\nsubmit to the Court that none of that reaches to the level of probable cause to begin\nwith to be able to get a search warrant for the buccal swab to get the DNA evidence.\n    And the last problem is, is that they don’t have anything to even compare the\nDNA evidence to. So it doesn’t even say that there’s any real basis for getting that\nevidence.\n    So - - in the totality of the four corners of that affidavit, it fails to reach the level\nof - - of a valid search warrant.\n    Now, we will move on to the next search warrant, which is going to the premises.\nAnd it is based on this same - - it is based on the same affidavit. Now, one difference\nin that search warrant is, is that at the beginning of that search warrant, they actually\nallege that they’re investigating the offense of kidnapping,. But, again, there’s\n\n                                            76\n\fnothing in any of the documents to suggest that there was a kidnapping,\n    There’s nothing other than the fact that the mother says that she went to pick up\nher daughter at the school and she wasn’t there.\n    And there’s no evidence to suggest that Shania was taken against her will, so\nthere’s no - - there’s absolutely nothing in any of these search warrants that say\notherwise to suggest that there was a kidnapping.\n    Then we go to the one for the car. It also alleges the kidnapping. And the only\ndifference in it is, is that in that affidavit, they do put - -\n    THE COURT: Can I ask you a question, Mr. Johnson?\n    MR. JOHNSON: Yes, sir.\n    THE COURT: Did you say in the buccal swab search warrant that there was no\ncrime alleged?\n    MR. JOHNSON: That is correct.\n    THE COURT: What about paragraph three of the affidavit.\n    MR. JOHNSON: Okay. They do actually allege kidnapping. But again, there’s\nno - - I apologize to the Court.\n    That is in a different part of the search warrant where I saw the kidnapping in the\nother one. It is actually alleged earlier in the other one.\n    THE COURT: I’m not criticizing you.\n    MR. JOHNSON: Okay. Okay.\n    Anyway the problem is, is that there’s no evidence that there was a kidnapping.\nThere’s nothing in any of these things that actually say that there was a kidnapping.\nAnd it certainly doesn’t say that there’s anything to compare the DNA to, which is\nessential for a search warrant for DNA.\n    Now, when we get on - - we’ll continue on to the last search warrant, the third\nsearch warrant. And that is the one for the car. They do add an additional paragraph\nin the affidavit that says that - - that they did see Mr. Davis driving that vehicle, and\nthat is the only thing that’s different in the search warrant of those three search\nwarrants.\n    Now, and that is our argument on all of those search warrants, Judge.\n    THE COURT: Okay.\n    MR. JOHNSON: Now, as to the fourth search warrant, that one was actually\nobtained at a later date.\n    ...\n        There are four motions to suppress evidence found pursuant to search warrants.\n\nThe fourth is dated September 12, 2012. It is based on information obtained through\n\n\n                                          77\n\fthe searches conducted pursuant to the other three search warrants as well as\n\nconversations with the defendant after the other three search warrants were executed\n\nand those conversations pertained directly to some of the evidence obtained through\n\nthe other three searches. The three initial search warrants are dated September 8,\n\n2012 and have almost identical affidavits attached to them and will be addressed as\n\none .\n\n        The search warrants at issue lay out a factual history about Shania Gray’s\n\ndisappearance and of the ongoing criminal case pending between Ms. Gray and Mr.\n\nDavis, but nothing to indicate that Mr. Davis is remotely related to Ms. Gray being\n\nmissing. The only connection comes from an individual unknown to law\n\nenforcement that identified herself as Shakeema Morsley over the phone in a brief\n\nconversation with detectives.\n\n        Officers get phone records on a number with a 903 area code that appears on\n\nMs. Grays phone records as someone she has communicated with. They randomly\n\ncall numbers that are associated with that phone and a stranger answers one of those\n\nphone calls. She identifies herself as Shakeema Morsley and as a friend of Franklin\n\nDavis’ girlfriend (Ms. Arrington). She goes on to say that she received a call from\n\nthe 903 number and believes it was Franklin Davis based on “communications”. It is\n\ninteresting to note that she does not say the individual identified himself as Franklin\n\n\n                                          78\n\fDavis but rather deduced it from “communications”. It is also interesting that she\n\nclaims to have a close relationship with Ms. Arrington but describes the relationship\n\nwith Mr. Davis as a “dating relationship” in the search warrant, when according to\n\nMs Arrington’s own testimony she had been married to Franklin Davis since June\n\n2011 (RR: Vol 65 p. 349) over a year before the search warrant was issued.\n\n      The information in the affidavit attributed to coming from Shakeema Morsley\n\nis the only nexus between Ms. Gray and Mr. Davis aside from the ongoing criminal\n\ncase. Without that information probable cause can not be found to exist in the\n\nunderlying affidavit for these search warrants. In order for probable cause to be\n\npredicated on this uncorroborated statement the must be some reason to believe the\n\ninformation is truthful or reliable, neither of which is possible in this case.\n\n      When probable cause is based upon information from an informant, “the\n\nveracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge are still relevant considerations in the\n\ntotality of the circumstances analysis” Carroll v. State 911 SW.2d 210, 216. The\n\nsituation before the court in this case involves someone with even more tenuous ties\n\nto law enforcement than an informant. The affiant of these three search warrants\n\nrelied on the words of an individual that he met for the first time over the phone in\n\nthe very phone call, the subject of which is the information in the search warrant.\n\n\n\n\n                                           79\n\f      When an anonymous tip is relied upon to furnish probable cause, the informer\n\nmust assert personal knowledge or there must be additional facts showing reason to\n\nbelieve that the contraband sought will probably be where the information indicates it\n\nwill be.” Rojas v. State, 797 S.W.2d 41, 44 (Tex.Crim.App.1990) (citing Gates, 462\n\nU.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527; Angulo v. State, 727 S.W.2d 276\n\n(Tex.Crim.App.1987)).      The instant case is similar to an anonymous informant due\n\nto the fact that no one has any knowledge of who the person is that identifies\n\nthemselves as Ms. Morsley. In addition, the proponent has also shown not to have\n\nreliable information in regard to Mr. Davis since she did not even know he had\n\nmarried her “coworker” over a year before this. Not only is there no indicia that the\n\nproponent of the information is truthful, accurate, or reliable, to the contrary the\n\nuncorroborated individual has shown to have false information.\n\n      For these reasons all three motions to suppress evidence from the search\n\nwarrants should have been granted and all evidence suppressed. When these three\n\nare suppressed it leaves no legally obtained information to base the fourth search\n\nwarrant on since most of the information found in the search warrant affidavit was\n\nbased on the three searched done with invalid search warrants.\n\n\n\n\n                                           80\n\f                    TRIAL ISSUES IN GUILT/INNOCENCE\n\n                          APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 11\n\nTHE EVIDENCE IS LEGALLY INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE JURY’S\n  VERDICT THAT APPELLANT WAS GUILTY OF THE OFFENSE OF\n                     CAPITAL MURDER\n\n\n                             STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      The State attempted to present evidence in this case to show a murder was\n\ncommitted after an alleged abduction in order to prevent the victim from testifying\n\nagainst Defendant in an aggravated sexual assault case. The indictment states:\n\nFranklin B. Davis on or about the 65th day of September, A.D., 2013 in the County of\nDallas and said State, did unlawfully then and there intentionally cause the death of\nSHANIA GRAY, an individual, hereinafter called deceased, by SHOOTING THE\nDECEASED WITH A FIREARM, A DEADLY WEAPON, AND BY\nASPHYXIATING THE DECEASED, and the defendant was then and there in the\ncourse of committing and attempting to commit the offense of OBSTRUCTION.\n\n      Appellant submits that the State failed to present evidence that he was in the\n\n“course of committing and attempting to commit the offense of obstruction.” The\n\nState failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant’s motive in murdering\n\nShania Gray was to prevent her future testimony against him in his trial on the\n\noffenses of sexual assault. Appellant argues that he murdered Shania Gray because,\n\nas he had testified, she had ruined his life by lying about him. (RR: Vol. 65 p. 102)\n\n\n\n\n                                          81\n\fThe deceased had accused Appellant of four instances of sexual assault. Appellant\n\nvehemently denied these allegations and was prepared to take the case to trial. For\n\nover a year, Appellant implored the police and his legal counsel to investigate the\n\ncase. Detective Brandon Snyder of the Mesquite Police Department, the detective\n\nthat investigated the sexual allegation regarding Franklin Davis, did not investigate\n\nthe case. The Detective did not investigate why, on the night before the outcry, Ms.\n\nGrey went to stay with her grandmother or what had occurred with her mother that\n\npreceded the outcry. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 40-41) He did not investigate the fact that one of\n\nthe outcry witnesses wrote in their statement that Ms. Grey had changed her story.\n\n(RR: Vol. 64 p. 40) The detective testified that he became aware that there were other\n\npeople present when the supposed sexual assaults occurred but he did not interview\n\nthese people. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 43) He said Mr. Davis adamantly denied the\n\nallegations. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 44) He stated that he did not look at any other boys or\n\nmen in connection with this case. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 52) The Detective said that after\n\nspeaking to the outcry witnesses who told him that Shania had been kicked out of the\n\nhouse and had switched her story, he did not do any further investigation. (RR: Vol.\n\n64 p. 53) He never spoke with the children she was babysitting when the alleged\n\nassaults occurred. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 55) He did not talk to the children’s mother,\n\nJennifer. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 55) He never went to the home or apartment where the\n\n\n                                         82\n\falleged assaults occurred. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 57) He did not consider asking Mr. Davis\n\nto take a polygraph examination. (RR:Vol. 64 p. 62) The witness testified that there\n\nwere no witnesses to the alleged sexual assaults. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 64)\n\n      The Detective testified that he never spoke to Dezire, the daughter of the\n\nDefendant and the child that Shania was babysitting, to ask if she ever saw anything\n\nunusual between her father and Shania. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 103) Furthermore, the\n\nDetective stated that it was possible that Shania had a crush on Franklin Davis. (RR:\n\nVol. 64 p. 114)\n\n      Appellant also had difficulty getting his counsel to investigate his case or to\n\nprepare for a trial. He testified that his first attorney was only interested in making a\n\nplea deal. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 154) He stated that he was innocent and did not want to\n\ntake any deal. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 154) He paid a second attorney over $10,000 which\n\nincluded the title to his car, but when his unemployment ran out and he could no\n\nlonger pay him, the attorney went before a judge and was dismissed from the case.\n\n(RR: Vol. 64 p. 169) He said Mr. Cox never filed any motions, never had him meet\n\nwith an investigator or talk to him about the State’s file. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 169) He told\n\nhim that he wanted to take a polygraph test but was told that he would have to pay\n\n$800 or $900 to take it. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 169) Mr. Hugo Aguilar was then appointed\n\n\n\n\n                                           83\n\fto take his case but he never saw him at his office and his calls were never returned.\n\n(RR: Vol. 64 p. 172)\n\n      At this point, Appellant began his own investigation by looking online about\n\nShania’s reputation. (RR: Vol. 65 p. 21-22) He bought a throw away phone for his\n\ninvestigation and sent a text to Shania, telling her he was someone else and that he\n\nwanted to get to know her. (RR: Vol. 65 p. 27) He made seven recordings of their\n\nconversations. (RR: Vol. 65 p. 30) He said that she spoke of the sexual assaults but\n\nher stories conflicted with the account she gave to CPS and the police. (RR: Vol. 65\n\np. 32) He said that these proved she kept changing her story. (RR: Vol. 65 p. 32) He\n\nplayed the recordings to his family to prove his innocence to them. (RR: Vol. 65 p.\n\n33) Appellant was certain that if he went to trial, he would be found innocent and to\n\nthis end he began his own preparation for trial. In addition to the recordings he\n\nmade, he also sent Ms. Grey fake text messages, hoping this would help clear him of\n\nthe charges. (RR: Vol. 65 p. 39)\n\n      Appellant argues that after the false allegations were made by Shania Grey, his\n\nsettled, happy life fell apart. He wanted to go to trial, to prove his innocence and to\n\nhave his life restored, but his trial was repeatedly postponed. He said his life was\n\nvery happy until the allegations were made. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 144-145) Mr. Davis\n\ntestified that Shania’s lies changed his life and he lost his job when he was arrested.\n\n\n                                          84\n\f(RR: Vol. 64 p. 145) He said he was in jail for 30 days after which he could not pass\n\nthe background check at Dr. Pepper to be rehired because of the four sexual assault\n\ncharges pending against him. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 146) His relationship with Jawanna, his\n\nwife, went downhill because of the allegations and the loss of his job. (RR: Vol. 64 p.\n\n148) He stated that he could not find another job because of the background checks.\n\n(RR: Vol. 64 p. 14) He filed for unemployment. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 149) He said\n\nJawanna started looking at him like he was less than a man. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 151) He\n\nsaid when they argued, she would throw it in his face that he wasn’t working and not\n\ncontributing. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 152) He couldn’t provide for his family anymore. He\n\nhad lost everything. The trauma of all he had been through and his frustration with\n\nthe legal system led him to purchasing a gun in order to kill himself. (RR: Vol. 65 p.\n\n41)\n\n      He said he began thinking about hurting Shania because she had ruined his life\n\nwith her lies. (RR: Vol. 65 p. 47) Appellant’s downward spiral ended with the\n\nmurder of Shania Grey, not because she was going to testify against him, but because\n\nof the hatred he felt for her because she had ruined the life he had struggled so hard\n\nto make for himself. Appellant had been accused of sexual assault, a crime which to\n\nhim was abhorrent because he and his mother had been victims of sexual abuse. His\n\nmother had been sexually assaulted before she was murdered.\n\n\n                                          85\n\f        Appellant submits that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nhe murdered Shania Grey to keep her from testifying against him. He never stated\n\nthat was the reason he murdered her, even though all the detectives tried to get him to\n\nadmit this. Appellant repeatedly told detectives that the reason he murdered Shania\n\nGrey was because “Fucked up everything. I couldn’t take care of my kids, my\n\nhousehold. Had to get rid of my car. I went from having diamond earrings and a nice\n\njob to being wiped out completely.” Appellant murdered her out of revenge and\n\nanger, which is first degree murder, not capital murder.\n\n                                   Standard of Review\n\n        Capital Murder in relevant part is defined in §19.03 of the Texas Penal Code\n\nas:\n\n.....\n\n (2) the person intentionally commits the murder in the course of committing or\nattempting to commit kidnapping, burglary, robbery, aggravated sexual assault,\narson, obstruction or retaliation, or terroristic threat under Section 22.07 (a)(1), (3),\n(4), (5), or (6);\n\n        When an appellant questions the sufficiency of evidence, the Appellate Court\n\nreviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. The Court must\n\ndetermine whether any rational trier of fact could have found each element of the\n\ncrime beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S.307, 319, 99 S.Ct.\n\n2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); Butler v. State, 769 S.W.2d 234, 239 (Tex.\n\n                                           86\n\fCrim.App. 1989). This standard of review applies to circumstantial evidence cases as\n\nwell as to direct evidence cases. Houston v. State, 663 S.W.2d 455, 456 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp.1984).\n\n      Texas law requires that the State establish:(1) the offense was actually\n\ncommitted; and (2) the accused was the person who either committed or participated\n\nin the crime. See Johnson v. State, 673 S.W.2d 190, 197 (Tex. Crim. App.1984).\n\nThe State must prove more than just a plausible explanation of the crime. Reeves v.\n\nState, 806 S.W.2d 540, 543 (Tex. Crim. App.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 984, 111\n\nS.Ct. 641, 113 L.Ed.2d 736 (1991). While the trier of fact is the sole judge of the\n\nweight and credibility of the witnesses, Coe v. State, 683 S.W.2d 431, 438\n\n(Tex.Crim.App.1984); Williams v. State, 692 S.W.2d 671, 676\n\n(Tex.Crim.App.1984).\n\n      A review of the testimony shows that the record is insufficient to show\n\nAppellant committed the aggravating offense of obstruction to the primary offense of\n\nmurder to make this case a capital murder rather than murder.\n\n      The state has failed to prove a necessary element in order to sustain a\n\nconviction for capital murder. The state has alleged that the underlying murder in the\n\ninstant capital murder allegation was committed in order to further the offense of\n\nObstruction (Tex. Penal Code 36.06 (2)). In a typical prosecution for murder the\n\n\n                                         87\n\fprosecution is quick to point out that it is not necessary to prove a motive. This is not\n\nthe case in this specific prosecution, the element that raises the instant murder case to\n\na capital murder is the assertion that the motive is not only provable but to the extent\n\nthat any other motive can be ruled out. Specifically, it must be proved that the\n\nmotive for the murder was Obstruction and if any other motive is responsible then the\n\ncase before us is not a capital murder but simply murder.\n\n      There are a number of underlying offenses that can raise a murder charge to a\n\ncapital murder as long as the specific intent exists, however those underlying offenses\n\nare not interchangeable. The state can not allege a capital murder based on\n\nobstruction and prove it by putting forth evidence of retaliation any more than they\n\ncould prove it by putting forth evidence of robbery. When obstruction is alleged it\n\nbecomes incumbent on the state to prove obstruction, if the state can not or does not\n\nthen a conviction for capital murder can not stand.\n\n      Obstruction and Retaliation are both enumerated offenses that can raise a\n\nmurder to capital murder if properly alleged, indicted, and proven. They are also\n\nfound in the same section of the penal code. They initially seem like similar offense\n\nbut upon further reflection they are exact opposites. They are opposing sides of the\n\nsame coin. Obstruction is triggered when the harm done is intended to prevent\n\nfuture behavior and that intention is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Retaliation\n\n\n                                          88\n\fon the other hand is triggered when the harm done is intended as revenge for past\n\nbehavior and that intention is proved beyond a reasonable doubt\n\n      Obstruction requires in part that an actor “…harms or threatens another by an\n\nunlawful act to prevent or delay the service of another as a…witness or prospective\n\nwitness…or person who has reported or who the actor knows intends to report the\n\noccurrence of a crime.” (Texas Penal Code 36.06 (2)) There was no evidence\n\npresented at trial to support a theory of conviction under that section of the penal\n\ncode. To the contrary all evidence as to motive followed along that that would be\n\nnecessary to support the allegation of retaliation.\n\n      Mr. Davis not only testified at his trial, but he also gave multiple statements to\n\nlaw enforcement and gave four interviews to television media outlets. Mr. Davis\n\ninitially denied involvement in the incident but when he gave a recorded confession\n\nabout the murder to Detective Chevellier, he explained it was because the\n\ncomplainant has ruined his life with the allegation (See States Exhibit 57 and 57B).\n\nWhen he spoke with Detective Williams in a fourth interview, he went as far to say\n\nhe had been trying to get it to court the whole time so he could get his life back (RR:\n\nVol. 63 p. 60). He also explained that he thought the recordings he had\n\nsurreptitiously made would help clear his name and was anxious to play them for a\n\n\n\n\n                                          89\n\fjury (RR: Vol 65 pps. 104-105) and that his attorney felt that these recordings would\n\nbe helpful at trial (RR: Vol. 63 p. 61).\n\n      Every interview he gave to the media (Defendant’s Exhibits 4 and 5) he gave\n\nthe same explanation for the murder, that she had ruined his life with the allegations.\n\nIt was not until he saw his daughter with holes in her shoes that the full gravity of\n\nwhat the complainant had done to his life with her accusations and he started crying\n\n(RR: Vol. 65 p. 72). At that point he retaliated against her and committed this brutal\n\nmurder.\n\n      The effort and optimism that Mr. Davis demonstrated are inconsistent with\n\nsomeone who did not want the complainant to testify—he was preparing for trial and\n\nwas feeling good about his chances of acquittal. There is an abundance of evidence\n\nthat Mr. Davis acted against Ms. Gray for the perceived wrong that she had caused\n\nhim. His motive for the killing never waivered and is summed up best in his own\n\ntestimony:\n\n      Q: Why did you hate her [the complainant] so much?\n      A: Because she lied. She ruined my life. She took everything from me.\n         Everything that I worked so hard to get, she took it. (RR: Vol. 65 p. 102).\n\n\n      The state chose to indict this case as capital murder based on the extra element\n\nof Obstruction and presented no evidence to the jury as to that element. There is not\n\na scintilla of evidence that indicates that Mr. Davis’s actions had anything to do with\n\n                                           90\n\fcurbing future action by Ms. Gray and everything points that it was revenge for past\n\nactions attributed to her by Mr. Davis.\n\n      The jury was presented a clear motive by the defendant for his actions, in order\n\nto convict him the jury would have had to ignored all evidence of that motive and\n\ninstead engage in utter guess work to come up with another one. When a motive is\n\nrequired to be proved as in this case that must be done with evidence and not mere\n\nconjecture.\n\n                           APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 12\n\n    THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING APPELLANT’S\nOBJECTION TO STATE’S EXHIBIT NUMBERS 40 AN 41, PHOTOGRAPHS\n\n\n      Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Reporter’s Record\n\nVolume 61 p. 116 at which defense counsel objected to the prejudicial value\n\noutweighed any probative value of the photograph depicting. The court overruled\n\nthe objection.\n\n                     We’re going to offer 38-41\n              (State’s Exhibits 38 through 41 were offered.)\n              THE COURT: Will there be objection?\n              MR. HAYES: Your Honor, we have no objection to State’s Exhibits 38\nand 39. I believe that they do show the terrain which the State is attempting to get at.\n       40 and 41, we do object to. I don’t - - they’re pictures of the body floating in\nthe river. I don’t believe that there's a probative value added to the testimony at this\ntime. I simply believe it’s a prejudicial photograph and it doesn’t really seem to add\nanything to the testimony, the terrain or the environment.\n\n\n                                          91\n\f             I’d ask the Court to take a look at them and do a 403 balancing test on\n40 and 41, Your Honor.\n             MR. BIRMINGHAM: Response. Judge, this is the first offer that\nsecured - -\n             THE COURT: Just let me see them.\n             MR. BIRMINGHAM: Yes, sir.\n             THE COURT: The Court concludes that the probative value of State’s\nExhibits 40 and 41 substantially outweighs the prejudicial affect. Objection is\noverruled.\n\n      Prior to the admission of the complained of photographs the Court must\n\ndetermine whether the photograph is relevant to any fact that the prosecution must\n\nprove. The Court must then determine whether any probative value that the picture\n\nmay have is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under Tex. R.\n\nEvid. 403. Reese v. State, 33 S.W.3d. 238 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). Prior to ruling\n\non the admissibility of photographs, the court must determine, reasonably (1) how\n\nprobative is the evidence, (2) the potential of the evidence to impress the jury in some\n\nirrational, but nevertheless indelible way; (3) the time the proponent needs to develop\n\nthe evidence; and (4) the proponents’ need for the evidence. Montgomery v. State,\n\n810 S.W.2d 372, 389-390 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990, op. on reh’g).\n\n                        ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\n      Rule 403 of the Texas Rules of Evidence states:\n\n      Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is\n\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or\n\n\n                                          92\n\fmisleading the jury or by consideration of undue delay, or needless presentation of\n\ncumulative evidence.\n\n      Rule 403 favors the admission of relevant evidence and carries a presumption\nthat relevant evidence will be more probative than prejudicial. Montgomery v. State,\n\n810 S.W.2d 372, 376 (Tex. Crim. App.1990) (op. on original submission). A trial\ncourt’s decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless it falls outside the zone of\n\nreasonable disagreement. Jones v. State, 944 S.W.2d 644, 651 (Tex. Crim.\nApp.1996).\n      Many factors should be used in determining whether the probative value of\nphotographs is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. These\nfactors include:\n             - the number of exhibits offered,\n             - the gruesomeness of the exhibits,\n             - the detail in the exhibits,\n             - size of the photographs,\n             - whether the photographs are in color or black and white,\n             - whether the photos are close-up, and\n             - whether the body depicted is clothed or naked.\n\n      The photographs of the victim floating in the water were extremely gruesome.\n\n      See Wyatt v. State, 23 S.W.3d 18, 29 (Tex. Crim. App.2000). The availability\n\nof other means of proof and the circumstances unique to each individual case should\nalso be noted. Id.\n\n      Appellant asserts that the trial court erred in allowing the State to introduce the\nphotographs in what appears to be an attempt by the prosecution to introduce\n\n\n                                          93\n\fevidence meant to appeal to emotion rather than the fact finding process. Taken\ntogether, the prejudicial effect of the State’s photographs far outweighed any possible\n\nprobative value. Wyatt v. State, 23 S.W.3d at 29.\n      Appellant asks this Honorable Court to:\n\n      1.     Review the photographs identified as objectionable by the Appellant;\n\n      2.     determine if the content/subject matter of each of the photographs is\n\n             relevant to a disputed issue that must be established by the State;\n\n      3.     determine if the photograph possesses any probative value;\n\n      4.     determine if any probative value is substantially outweighed by the\n\n             prejudicial effect of the subject matter of the photograph;\n\n      5.     consider the number, color, and prejudicial effect of the photograph(s)\n\n             itself separate and apart from the prejudicial effect of the subject matter;\n\n      6.     Find that the photographs identified by the Defendant were not\n\n             admissible upon the trial of this case.\n\n      The unfairly prejudicial effect of the above listed photographs influenced the\njury in a prejudicial manner and denied Appellant a fair trial especially in light of the\n\nfact that there was no controverted issue as to cause of death. There was no question\nfor the jury as to how the victim died. The trial court judgement and sentence should\nbe reversed and the case remanded. Appellant submits that the error raised in this\nissue affected the substantial right of Appellant to a fair trial absent prejudicial\n\nevidence (Rule. 44.2.(b) C.C.P.).\n\n                                           94\n\f            APPELLANT’S ISSUE NOS. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, AND 18\n\n      THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN SUSTAINING THE STATE’S\n   OBJECTIONS TO DEFENSE EXHIBIT A, B, C, E, F, & G WHICH ARE\n                 RECORDINGS OF THE VICTIM\n\n       (Appellant submits these issues as combined separate issues each for the\n proffer by the defense of each separate defense exhibit; A,B,C, E,F &G as each\n  involves separate parts of recordings of the victim on separate subjects. The\n Court made separate rulings as to each preferred exhibit. Each issue involves\nthe same or similar legal issues regarding the trial court’s denial of admissibility\ninto evidence for the jury’s consideration.) (Exhibit D is omitted as there was no\n                                    objection.)\n\n\n      Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Reporter’s Record\n\nVolume 63 pp. 98-115 at which the defense proffered 7 separate audio recordings of\n\nthe victim and the defendant. The State objected to each separately; which objections\n\nwere each sustained by the trial court. The Reporter’s Record shows the following:\n\n                          ...\n\n              These recordings are of Frank pretending to be somebody named \"D\"\nwhen he's talking to Shania; is that correct?\n              A. That's the way it appeared to me, yes.\n              MR. JOHNSON: We'd like to publish those recordings, Judge.\n              MR. BIRMINGHAM: Your Honor, I informed the Defense I had a\n      motion before he did that. At least Mr. Wyatt. I would like the rulings from\n      the Court before that happens.\n              ...\n              The State had the following objections:\n\n              MR. BIRMINGHAM: The first -- one of -- the title one of the tapes is\n       \"First Time Having Sex,\" and that is Shania talking about the first time that\n       she had sex. I don't see how that's relevant. I believe that it's protected under\n                                         95\n\f412 as well.\n        THE COURT: Hold on. Response to that?\n        MR. WYATT: My response she says in the DCAC interview and to\nDetective Snyder the first time she ever had sex was with Franklin Davis.\n        MR. BIRMINGHAM: I actually dispute that.\n        MR. WYATT: Okay.\n        THE COURT: Because if it’s another person, I’m going to sustain that.\n        ...\n        MR. BIRMINGHAM: Yes. The first objection, Judge, there's, I\nbelieve, six recordings in addition to the one that we played in front of this\njury.\n        Okay. I'll go through with each recording and make my objection if\nthat's all right with the Court.\n        THE COURT: Go ahead.\n        MR. BIRMINGHAM: The first recording is literally a ten-second\nrecording where Mr. Davis calls and he says, \"Okay, I'm going to call her\nright now to prove my innocence.\"And the call never goes through. It goes\nstraight to voice mail. So there is nothing from the complaining witness on\nthat case.\n        So we object under 403 and under the hearsay rules that it's an\nout-of-court statement made to the truth of the matter asserted by the\ndefendant.\n        THE COURT: I'm familiar.\n        MR. BIRMINGHAM: Yes, sir.\n        THE COURT: Okay. That's sustained.\n        MR. PARKS: Okay.\n        MR. BIRMINGHAM: No. 2 is entitled on the Exhibit 19\n\"incomplete.\" Actually, the second one on there -- I may be wrong about the\ntitle, but the substance is he's asking whether or not she has a boyfriend, has\never had a boyfriend. She goes into a story where basically she was caught\nwith a guy, and apparently they were having sex when that happened.\n        Her mom expected her to be somewhere she was not. So she leaves\nthere with this guy to go to where her mother is, and they get pulled over by\na police officer. And that's when she apparently finds out he's 22 years old,\nand she had thought he was 20.\n        And that is basically the extent of that conversation. It's about eight\nminutes long, I believe, maybe 12 minutes long.\n        Our objections there are relevance, the Rule 412, and also hearsay.\n\n                                 96\n\f       THE COURT: Response?\n       MR. PARKS: Judge, I think it probably -that it goes to the state of\nmind of the complainant, who I believe has led police to believe at least at\none point that she -- that this assault was the first sexual encounter that she\nhad ever had. And it just shows a general consistency with the defendant's\ntheory of the case.\n       THE COURT: Okay.\n       MR. BIRMINGHAM: I -\n       THE COURT: You don't need to respond.\n       The objection is sustained on all of the grounds that you mentioned,\nbut primarily 412.\n       MR. BIRMINGHAM: Thank you.\n       The next conversation is entitled \"First time having sex.\" I will state\nthat I believe that this is a partial recording and that there doesn't appear to\nbe an obvious beginning to the conversation. Okay.\n       But there is about -- again, about eight minutes, I believe, on this one.\n       And it says -essentially, he is asking her the first time she had sex.\nThey talk a little bit more about the conversation the Court just ruled\ninadmissible.\n       He says things like, You sound crazy. How many boyfriends have\nyou had? How many have you had? How many times have you had sex in\nthe past? How long -- basically how old were you the first time that you\nhad sex in the past?\n       She talks about the first time that she had sex was with this guy that\nwas in the Army that was 20 years old. She says -- he asks her, How many\ntimes or how many partners have you had?\n       And then they start talking about how, you know, who was doing\nmost of the work. I'm assuming they're -- I don't want to speculate, but\nthey're talking about during the sexual encounter, who's doing most of the\nwork.\n       I would object under 403, 412, also under 803.\n       MR. PARKS: Judge, to the -\n       THE COURT: 803?\n       MR. BIRMINGHAM: Hearsay.\n       THE COURT: Respond.\n       MR. PARKS: To the previous objections, we would also add this\nwould be impeachment testimony. This has already been admitted before\nthe jury as to her prior inconsistent statements.\n\n                                  97\n\f       THE COURT: Has Detective Williams listened to these tapes y'all are\ntalking about?\n       MR. BIRMINGHAM: Yes.\n       MR. PARKS: Yes.\n       MR. JOHNSON: She testified she did.\n       THE COURT: Okay. So y'all are going to try to offer these through\nher?\n       MR. PARKS: I believe, yes.\n       MR. JOHNSON: We've already made that offer.\n       MR. PARKS: He's already made the offer.\n       THE COURT: Response to what he just said on this particular -\n       MR. BIRMINGHAM: Judge, it does not directly contradict anything\nthat she said in the video -- audiotape that is in evidence right now.\n       THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection to what I'm calling Recording\nC for the reasons you stated.\n       Next.\n       MR. BIRMINGHAM: There's a recording and the title of it is \"AU\n3.\"     And it's basically five seconds and unintelligible, in my opinion.\nCould be Shania. There's nothing said on there. I don't see how there's\nrelevant information in there at all.\n       THE COURT: Response.\n       MR. PARKS: No objection.\n       THE COURT: Sustained.\n       MR. BIRMINGHAM: The next one is audio 0007. They're talking\nabout the fact that she's singing in church. She was on YouTube. He's\nasking her to \"Tell me a big secret\" and \"I want a big secret from you.\" And\nshe says, no, she's not going to tell him a big secret.\n       Talk about how she's built. And he mentioned 350 and she's small,\nfive-two, that's where she got her name, \"Average Height.\"\n       He talks about how he doesn't like to date females with children\nbecause there's too much drama that comes along with it. They talk about\nhow this 20-year-old she was talking about before had a child and she knew\nthat. He asks her if she ever snuck anyone through the window. She says no.\nShe ever snuck out of the house. She says no. And then they start talking\nabout the car that he's driving, which is an Impala.\n       So I would object under 403, and also self-serving hearsay. Also, I\nguess to tie back to the dude with the Army -- from the Army, that violates\n412 as well.\n\n                                 98\n\f       THE COURT: Response.\n       MR. WYATT: That's already come in about the Army stuff, Your\nHonor, when Franklin Davis -- if I can have a moment.\n                              (Off the record discussion.)\n       MR. WYATT: Judge, we'll lodge the same objections Mr. Parks has\nmade, especially the impeachment, Your Honor.\n       THE COURT: You mean theory of admissibility; you don't mean the\nobjections?\n       MR. WYATT: Excuse me, Your Honor?\n       THE COURT: You mean theory of admissibility, not objections.\n       MR. WYATT: Yes, I do, Your Honor. With the impeachment, Your\nHonor -- of all these recordings, even the ones that have already been ruled\ninadmissible, there are statements by Shania Gray. There are statements in\nthe REACH Clinic reports. There are contradictions in the Mesquite Police\nDepartment report versus what she said on the DCAC interview, versus\nwhat she said in the recordings, Judge. And that's why we feel all of these\nneed to come in together to give context to exactly what the theory of the\ndefense is, is that Shania Gray is lying about the sexual assaults coming in;\nthat Franklin Davis did not commit these sexual assaults.\n       Now, I think it's clear from the record we developed that theory very\nwell up until this point, Your Honor. And having those recordings not\ncome in to give context to exactly the veracity of Shania Gray or lack\nthereof of her veracity, handicaps the Defense to the point we don't feel we\ncan put on a proper defense.\n       THE COURT: Response to that.\n       MR. BIRMINGHAM: Yes, sir. There has not been any evidence of a\nREACH exam on Shania Gray, nor has there been any evidence about what\nshe has said to a DCAC interviewer yet.\n       And so -- as a matter of fact, Judge, they're the ones that brought up\nthe DCAC interview during their cross-examination of other officers. We\ndidn't bring that up. So they're trying to open their own door, in my\nopinion.\n       THE COURT: Response to that.\n       MR. WYATT: Also Your Honor, if we want to wait and put these in\nthrough Detective Snyder, they're going to call Detective Snyder, then we\ncan do it through Detective Snyder. If he wants what's in his case report,\nwhat's in his case file when he's called, we'll talk about that too, Judge.\nSo if we want to wait and have this hearing until after Detective Snyder\n\n                                 99\n\ftestifies to lay down a proper predicate to show about the veracity that we're\ntalking about, or the lack thereof the veracity of Shania Gray, we can wait\nuntil then.\n        THE COURT: Okay. Do you care to respond to that?\n        MR. BIRMINGHAM: Yeah. The problem is I can't call Shania Gray\nas a witness to this case because she's been murdered by Franklin Davis.\n        THE COURT: The objection to recording E is sustained. F?\n        MR. BIRMINGHAM: Actually Russell has this one, Judge.\n        MR. WILSON: Judge, F is -- we lodge the same objection with the\nexception of 412. There's not actually discussion of sexual history in there,\nbut it talks some about her baby-sitting her brother. He talks more about his\ncar and what types of customizations he's trying to do to his car.\n        He talks about a completely made-up incident of somebody passing\naway who hit their head and asked her if she's ever lost somebody like that.\n        Then it gets into -- she mentioned some things about being annoyed\nabout not being able to go to movies, the mall, or get a piercing.\n        She talks about church and some activities that she's getting ready to\nparticipate in where she might get a $400 shopping spree.\n  Again, 401, 402, 403 and 803, the discussions they had aren't relevant to\nissues in this case. I don't know how it bolsters anything that they're trying\nto do, which is, you know, to try to smear her name or anything like that. It\ndoesn't do that.\n        Again, though, it's irrelevant and, you know, if we're going to move\nalong expeditiously, we should focus on what does and doesn't prove the\nelements in the indictment. And the context -\n        THE COURT: That's enough, Mr. Wilson.\n        MR. WYATT: Judicial economy aside, trying to take Mr. Davis's life,\nyou know, I'll defer to the Court on that issue. But when we're talking about\nthe context the entire, the State put in one of the recordings. So this is a\nwhole group of recordings. It's the whole set of recordings.\n        They're trying to make Mr. Davis out to be some kind of sneaky fiend\nby saying that he's doing all these surreptitious recordings and that's part of\nwhy he's a bad person. Okay?\n        He's doing his own investigation. They put in an hour-and-11-minute\naudio recording of him doing his own investigation. Well, let's put in the\nrest of the audio recordings about his investigation and what he uncovered\nduring that investigation. And, really, it's all one set of facts. It's all one set\nof recordings. Under the rule of optional completeness, they should all come\n\n                                   100\n\f       in also.\n              THE COURT: The objection to recording F is sustained. 401, 402,\n              403 as well as 803.\n              Are there other tapes?\n              MR. BIRMINGHAM: This is the last one, Judge. It's entitled\n       \"Random One.\"\n              THE COURT: That's six? You told me six, now there's seven?\n              MR. BIRMINGHAM: Six that I did, Judge. Russell did one. The next\n       one is entitled \"Random One,\" and they're talking about how she can sing.\n       She's got an upcoming audition. She actually sings to him.\n              She talks about how she wants a particular type of purse, that she\n       used to go to Horn, and she was planning on going and moving to\n       Carrollton. That's the extent of that one. We object under 401, '2, and '3,\n       also under hearsay from the defendant.\n              THE COURT: Response.\n              MR. WYATT: Same.\n              MR. PARKS: We just re-urge on the objections previously made.\n              THE COURT: Thank you. I appreciate your defense on the case, and\n       I want to make it clear none of these rulings are being made for judicial\n       economy. That's not rationale.\n              The objection's sustained on the -- what we'll call G recording.\n              Anything else before we bring the jury back in?\n              MR. PARKS: Have those been -- I'm not sure, have they been offered\n       for the record? We offer all the recordings -\n                           (Defense Exhibits A-G offered.)\n              THE COURT: They're admitted for the record.\n                     (Defense Exhibits A-G admitted.)\n\n      As to recording A dealing with a statement by the victim about her first time\n\nof having sex in a child abuse interview concerning the allegation of sexual assault\n\nby the Defendant before this case arose. The Court sustained the State’s objection.\n\nAppellant sought to introduce this recording as part of a compilation of recordings\n\nof the victim to support his defense that he did not commit the aggravating offense\n\n\n                                        101\n\fof obstruction to elevate this murder case to the potential death penalty punishment\n\noption. The item was not submitted for the truth of the matter asserted. It showed\n\nthe victim’s state of mind concerning her mindset as to its preoccupation with\n\nsexual activity and contributed to show how she fabricated the accusations of\n\nsexual misconduct against the defendant.\n\n      The “B” recording involves the complainant about being caught with a guy\n\nhaving sex. The “C” recording involves “first time having sex” (RR: Vol. 63 p.\n\n106) and having boyfriends. The “D” recording was unintelligible and the defense\n\ndid not object to its inadmissibility. The “E” recording involves singing in church\n\nand her physically and other conduct. The “F” recording involves general\n\ndiscussion of automobiles and personal relationships. The “G” recording involves a\n\npurse and moving to Carrollton. All of the objections were sustained.\n\n      In Sanders v. State, 687 S.W.2d 60 (Tex. App.-Dallas, 1985) it was stated\n\nthat the excluded evidence constituted part of the circumstances surrounding the\n\nkilling. This time of offense does not occur in a vacuum and all of the evidence of\n\nthe surrounding facts may be properly admitted. The evidence of the words spoken\n\nduring the events surrounding the killing was not offered to prove the matters\n\nasserted, but rather as proof that the statements were made. The statement was\n\n\n\n\n                                        102\n\fexplanatory of the circumstances surrounding the killing, and would enable the jury\n\nto evaluate the evidence. See Article 38.36 Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n       Art. 38.36 EVIDENCE IN PROSECUTIONS FOR MURDER. (a) In all\n\nprosecutions for murder, the state or the defendant shall be permitted to offer\n\ntestimony as to all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the killing and the\n\nprevious relationship existing between the accused and the deceased, together with\n\nall relevant facts and circumstances going to show the condition of the mind of the\n\naccused at the time of the offense.\n\nTherefore, the trial court reversibly erred in denying each proffered recording to be\n\nadmitted into evidence; which would have affected his constitutional right to due\n\nprocess and a fair trial.\n\n                            APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 19\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN SUSTAINING THE STATE’S OBJECTION\n  TO THE DEFENSE’S PROFFERED TESTIMONY OF PASTOR ARTY\n      HAYES, THE BROTHER -IN-LAW OF THE DEFENDANT\n\n          Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Reporter Record\n\nVolume 65 p. 253-262 at which the defense proffered testimony of the defendant’s\n\nbrother in law concerning “what Franklin Davis did in the meantime after the sexual\n\nassaults arose but before the murder case and what he had done to counsel Frank” as\n\nprior consistent statements. The Court ruled that the proffer was not prior consistent\n\n\n                                         103\n\fstatements or undue influence and would not allow it. The proffered evidence was\n\npresented sub rosa (RR: Vol. 65 p. 259-262)\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 20\n\n     THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN SUSTAINING THE STATE’S\n OBJECTION TO WITNESS, ASHLEY SIMS, PROFFERED TESTIMONY\n\nAppellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Reporter’s Record Volume 65\n\np. 280-283 at which the defense in a sub rosa hearing presented the proffered\n\ntestimony of the witness Ashley Sims as a prior consistent statement.\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 21\n\n      THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN SUSTAINING THE STATE’S\n     OBJECTION TO WITNESS, LAMAR LEGGITON, PROFFERED\n                        TESTIMONY\n\n        Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Reporter’s Record\n\nVolume 65 p. 283-287 at which the defense in a sub rosa hearing presented the\n\nproffered testimony of the witness Lamar Leggiton as a prior consistent statement.\n\n(These three issues are grouped together as they involve the same issues of law\n                              and similar facts.)\n\n       Rule 801(e)(1)(B) gives substantive, non-hearsay status to prior consistent\n\nstatements of a witness “offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the\n\ndeclarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or notice.” This rule mirrors\n\nthat of Federal Rule 801(d)(1)(B) and thus federal decisions provide helpful\n\n\n                                        104\n\fanalysis. The Supreme Court has explained the four requirements that must be met\n\nfor prior consistent statements to be admissible under Federal Rul 801(d)(1)(B):\n\n      (1) the declarant must testify at trial and be subject to cross-examination;\n      (2) there must be an express or implied charge of recent fabrication or\nimproper influence or motive of the declarant’s testimony by the opponent;\n\n       (3) the proponent must offer a prior statement that is consistent with the\ndeclarant’s challenged in-court testimony; and ,\n       (4) the prior consistent statement must be made prior to the time that the\nsupposed motive to falsify arose;\n\n       See Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. 150, 156-58, 115 S.Cyt. 696, 130\n\nL.Ed.2d 574 (1995).\n\n       Defense counsel made the following argument for admissibility of the\n\nproffered testimony:\n\n               MR. WYATT: Yes. The witness that will be called is Pastor Arty\nHayes from Texarkana. He is the brother-in-law of Franklin Davis. The testimony\nthat we anticipate coming from Mr. Hayes is about what Franklin Davis did in the\nmeantime after the sexual assaults arose but before the murder case and what he\nhad done to counsel Frank, what he had talked about with Frank, but - - and we\nbelieve all that is absolutely admissible.\n               But we wanted to bring to the State’s attention that there are prior\nconsistent statements which will be asked of Mr. Hayes. And we wanted to give\nthe State - - tell them exactly what was going to be - - what we anticipate the\ntestimony is going to be.\n               THE COURT: How is the talking with the defendant not being offered\nby the defendant and therefore subject to hearsay rule?\n               MR. WYATT: We’re not asking about hearsay, Your Honor. We’re\nasking about what happened. Not specifically about what exactly was said, but\nwhat exactly happened.\n               We don’t believe it’s hearsay. We don’t believe it’s hearsay because\nit’s his statements about exactly what he was going through firsthand from the\n\n                                        105\n\fdefendant, Your Honor. And under the rules, under 801(d)1(B), when we look at -\n- sorry. When we look at prior consistent statements, there’s a four-prong test that\nmust be adhered to.\n              Your Honor, under Hammons v. State, Court of Criminal Appeals 239\nS.W.3d 798, 2000, Texas Court of Criminal Appeals case, Your Honor, and in that,\nwe believe that the prongs of the prior consistent statement testimony have been\nmet, Your Honor. Those prongs - - would you like me to - -\n              THE COURT: Are you referring to 801(e)1(B)?\n              MR. WYATT: I’m sorry, yes.\n              THE COURT: It’s not the rule you cited.\n              MR. WYATT: Yes, I cited the federal rule that they had in this case,\nYour Honor, so I was mistaken in that.\n              The four-prong test that they have is the declarant must testify at trial\nand be subject to cross-examination, as Mr. Davis has done.\n              There must be an expressed or implied charge of recent fabrication or\nimproper influential motive of the declarant’s testimony by the opponent that’s\nbeen taken care of by cross-examination of Mr. Davis.\n              The proponent must offer a prior state in-court testimony. That prong\nhas also been adhered to or satisfied in this case.\n              And No. 4, the prior consistency statement must be made prior to the\ntime that the supposed motive to falsify arose, which is the murder charge.\n              All four prongs of that have been met, Your Honor, and we believe\nthat Franklin’s prior consistent statements, since they have been put into question\nby the prosecution, that they can absolutely come in at this point in time that he did\nnot have sex with Shania Gray.\n              That’s been questioned by the State, asked by the Defense in the\nexhibits that have been put in, all the videotapes that have been put in. So - - and\nthe recordings by the State that Franklin Davis made. All those things that have\nbeen put into evidence satisfy those four prongs. We believe that we can call\nwitnesses to testify to prior consistent statements of Mr. Davis in the guilt/innocent\nphase of the trial.\n....\n              In this case, they have put in his mental state as an issue. In the\nindictment - - from all the way from the indictment up until the cross-examination\nof Mr. Davis by Mr. Birmingham. When they go into his medical records whether\nor not he’s sought help at the hospital that day or back in May of 2010 or 2011, any\nof those times, they put that directly at issue by bringing that up. So we can\nabsolutely bring up testimony and evidence to rebut that during guilt/innocence.\n\n                                         106\n\fThat’s exactly what it’s for, Your Honor.\n              THE COURT: Okay. You may call the witness. You will not be\nallowed to put on any consistent statements. It is not a recent fabrication or\nimproper influence, as Mr. Wilson correctly argued, but you may put the witness on\nfor the other matters that you indicated. Make sure you instruct him not to go into\nany prior consistent statements. You understand that?\n\n       This Court has provided an in depth discussion of the use of the rule of\n\nevidence 801.(e)(1)(B) concerning prior consistent statements in Hammons v.\n\nState, 239 S.W.3d 798 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) and Klien v. State, 273 S.W.3d 297)\n\nTex. Crim. App. 2008). Appellant submits that pursuant to trial counsel’s proffer\n\nof the evidence of prior consistent statements in reference to statements made by\n\nAppellant to any of these three witnesses that the proffered evidence was\n\nadmissible as non hearsay prior consistent statements. The trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying Appellant’s evidentiary proffer. This denied Appellant’s\n\nright to due process of law and a fair trial in denying Appellant his right to defend\n\nthe charge that he committed the offense of obstruction as alleged in the\n\nindictment.\n\n                          APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 22\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT REQUEST FOR\n        A CHARGE ON ANTI-SPECULATION DURING THE\n           GUILT/INNOCENCE STAGE OF THE TRIAL\n\n       Appellant directs this Court’s attention to Reporter’s Record Volume 66 pp.\n\n19-20 at which defense counsel requested a charge to the jury that they must render\n                                         107\n\fa verdict based solely on the evidence that they heard and not upon speculation.\n\nThe trial court denied the request. Appellant’s requested charge to the jury not to\n\nbase their verdict on speculation was a correct statement of the law and should\n\nhave been given to accurately guide the jury in its deliberations. In King v. State,\n\n254 S.W.3d 579 (Tex. App.-Amarillo, 2008) it was held in relevant part that:\n\n       Juries are not permitted to reach conclusions based on mere speculation or\n\nfactually unsupported inferences or presumptions. In Hooper, the Court of\n\nCriminal Appeals further distinguished inferences from speculation, defining an\n\ninference as “a conclusion reached by considering other facts and deducing a\n\nlogical consequence from them” and speculation as “mere theorizing or guessing\n\nabout the possible meaning of facts and evidence presented.” The court noted that\n\n“[a] conclusion reached by speculation may not be completely unreasonable, but it\n\nis not sufficiently based on facts or evidence to support a finding beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.” Hooper, 214 S.W.3d 9 (Texas Crim. App. 2007)\n\n       It would be a denial of due process for any defendant to be convicted or\n\npunished on speculation by the jury. It is true that jury, sitting as the trier of facts,\n\nmay accept or reject any or all of the testimony adduced. Ables v. State, 519\n\nS.W.2d 464, 465 (Tex. Cr. App. 1973); Esquivel v. State, 506 S.W.2d 613, 615\n\n(Tex. Cr. App. 1974). See also Reese v. State, 653 S.W.2d 550 (Tex. App.-\n\n\n                                           108\n\fBeaumont-1983). A jury, however, may not reach a verdict based on speculation.\n\nReese v. State, supra.\n\n       It was reasonable and an accurate statement of the law for the defense to\n\nrequest an instruction to the jury not to speculate. (See by example, Thomas v.\n\nState, 2006 WL 2022404 Tex. App. Dallas, 2006).\n\n       Appellant submits that he was denied due process of law in violation of the\n\n14th Amendment to the United States Constitution by the trial court denying his\n\nrequested instruction which would have properly instructed the jury as to how to\n\ndeliberate and consider the evidence adduced at trial.\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 23\n\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING APPELLANT’S\nOBJECTION TO STATE COUNSEL’S JURY ARGUMENT CLAIMING IT\n IMPROPERLY STRIKING AT THE DEFENDANT OVER COUNSEL’S\n            SHOULDER AND SHIFTS THE BURDEN\n\n       Appellant directs this Court’s attention to Reporter’s Record Volume 66 pp.\n\n68-69 at which appears the complained of argument\n\n        . . . He wants you to give him credit and find him guilty of the lesser\nincluded offense of murder. They keep bringing up the punishment range. They\nwant you to think about the punishment range. Make you feel better about doing\nsomething that’s not supported by what Franklin says.\n               MR. HAYES: Judge, now I have to object. I think that’s properly\nstriking at the defendant over counsel’s should and it shifts the burden.\n               THE COURT: Fair reply. Overruled.\n               Ten minutes.\n               MR. BIRMINGHAM: That’s why they do that. They want you to\n                                        109\n\flook everywhere but what happened on the shores of the Trinity River.\n           ...\n\n         Permissible jury argument generally falls into one of four areas: (1)\n\nsummation of the evidence; (2) reasonable deduction from the evidence; (3) an\n\nanswer to the argument of opposing counsel; or (4) a plea for law enforcement.\n\nDavis v. State, 329 S.W.3d 798, 821 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010, cert denied - - U.S. - -\n\n, 132 S.Ct. 128, 181 L.Ed.2d 50 (2011); Cannady v. State, 11 S.W.3d 205, 213\n\n(Tex. Crim. App.) cert denied 531 U.S. 850, 121 S.Ct. 12148 L.Ed.2d 80 (2000).\n\nWhen a prosecutor makes uninvited and unsubstantiated accusations of improper\n\nconduct directed toward a defendant’s attorney, in an attempt to prejudice the jury\n\nagainst the defendant, courts refer to this as striking a defendant over the shoulders\n\nof his counsel. Phillips v. State, 130 S.W.3d 343, 355 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2004, pet. ref’d) (op. on reh’g), aff’d at 193 S.W.3d 904 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2006).\n\n         The Court of Criminal Appeals has consistently held that argument that\n\nstrikes at a defendant over the shoulders of defense counsel is improper. Gallo v.\n\nState, 239 S.W.3d 757, 767 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007), cert filed, #07-9590, February\n\n29, 2008. “It is axiomatic that the state may not strike at a defendant over the\n\nshoulders of his counsel or accuse defense counsel of bad faith and insincerity.”\n\nFuentes v. State, 664 S.W. 2d 333, 335 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984). This Court has\n\n                                          110\n\f“long recognized that prosecutors’ arguments which attack the personal morals or\n\ntrustworthiness of defense counsel are manifestly improper because they undermine\n\nthe adversarial system by unfairly prejudicing the jury against the defendant’s\n\nattorney.” Fuentes v. State, 991 S.W.2d 267, 274 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). The\n\nimpact of improper closing jury arguments should be noted because they are the\n\nlast thing the jury hears before deliberations and that an instruction to disregard\n\nmay be insufficient to remove the prejudice of some such arguments. Norris v.\n\nState, 902 S.W.2d 428, 443 (Tex. Rim. Ap. 1995). In the instant case, the\n\nprosecutor’s challenged comments were made during the second closing argument\n\nand were thus part of the last thing the jury heard before deliberations.\n\n       “A prosecutor runs a risk of improperly striking at a defendant over the\n\nshoulder of counsel when the argument is made in terms of defense counsel\n\npersonally and when the argument explicitly impugns defense counsel’s character.”\n\nMosley v. State, 983 S.W.2d 249, 259 (Tex. Crim.App. 1998). In the instant case,\n\nthe prosecutor referred to defense counsel’s alleged attempt to direct the jury away\n\nfrom the guilt/innocent stage of the trial. Thus in the instant case, the prosecutor\n\ndid improperly strike at appellant over the shoulder of his trial counsel. The\n\nprosecutor’s arguments that Appellants trial attorney was misleading the jury\n\n\n\n\n                                         111\n\fbrought into question veracity and credibility-important issues for the jury to\n\nresolve.\n\n       It is appropriate to object to defense jury argument if the state believes the\n\nargument is attempting to mislead the jury regarding applicable principles of law;\n\nthe trial court can then rule on such an objection. However it is inappropriate to\n\nfail to object to such a defense jury argument and then respond by arguing that\n\ndefense counsel is attempting to mislead the jury. Such an attack is a classic\n\nexample of striking at the defendant over the shoulders of defense counsel.\n\n       In Fuentes v. State, 664 S.W.2d 333 (Tex. Crim.App. 1984), it was held that\n\na prosecutor’s comments that defense counsel was acting “in bad faith like usual”\n\nand that evidence which defense counsel was seeking to elicit was “garbage,” were\n\nmanifestly improper, harmful, and prejudicial, and thus constituted reversible error.\n\nIn Gomez v. State, 704 S.W.2d 770, 771-72 (Tex. Crim.App. 1985), the Court held\n\nthat a prosecutor’s juror argument accusing defense counsel of manufacturing\n\nevidence was not cured by an instruction to disregard and was thus reversible error.\n\n       In this case, the state’s jury arguments attacking defense counsel were\n\nmanifestly improper, harmful, and prejudicial and were compounded by the trial\n\ncourt’s overruling of the objection.\n\n\n\n\n                                         112\n\f                               PUNISHMENT ISSUES\n\n                           APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 24\n\nTHE EVIDENCE IS LEGALLY INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT\nTHE JURY’S ANSWER TO SPECIAL ISSUE NO. 1 IN THE PUNISHMENT\n                   STAGE OF THE TRIAL\n\n\n         Appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence of future\n\ndangerousness because he had no prior violent offense convictions and the defense\n\nwitnesses testified that he essentially was a low risk for future dangerousness.\n\n         In the case of Huffman v. State, 746 S.W.2d 212 (Tex. Crim. App. 1988) it\n\nwas held that:\n\n         “In Roney v. State, 632 S.W.2d 598,603 (Tex. Cr. App. 1982), this court\n\nwrote:\n\n   “Although this was a senseless murder, that fact is true of every murder in the\n   course of a robbery. The facts of this offense, standing alone, do not carry the\n   marks of a ‘calculated and cold-blooded crime,’ such as appeared in O’Bryan v.\n   State, 591 S.W.2s 464, 480 (Tex. Cr. Ap. 1979), where the defendant for months\n   planned the candy poisoning of his own child to collect life insurance. To\n   support a ‘yes’ answer to the second punishment issue, the evidence must show\n   beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability appellant would commit\n   criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society. To\n   hold that the facts of this offense, standing alone, would support such a verdict,\n   would mean that virtually every murder in the course of a robbery would\n   warrant the death penalty. Such a construction would destroy the purpose of the\n   punishment stage in capital murder cases, which is to provide a reasonable and\n   controlled decision on whether the death penalty should be imposed, and to\n   guard against its capricious and arbitrary imposition. Jurek v. State,522 S.W.2d\n\n                                          113\n\f   934 (Tex. Cr. App. 1975); Jurek v. Texas, 428 U.S. 262, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 49\n   L.Ed.2d 929 (1976).”\n\n      Benz v. State, 233 S.W.3d 847 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). This Court should\n\nreform the judgement to life imprisonment. Holberg v. State 38 S.W.3d 137, 139\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2000) and Art. 44.251 (a).\n\n      According to the State’s evidence in the instant murder case the murder was\n\nclearly senseless and unnecessary. Given the circumstances of the offense, as brutal\n\nand uncalled for as they were, this Court should hold that there was sufficient\n\nevidence to support the affirmative finding in question standing alone.\n\n       The punishment evidence shows that the Defendant had children that he\n\ncared and provided for. Labrena Henderson, a former girlfriend and mother of the\n\nDefendant’s son testified that he always sent child support and visited until he was\n\nincarcerated on the current charge. (RR: Vol. 66 p. 125-126) She described Frank\n\nas being slow to anger and told defense counsel in an interview that “He was pretty\n\neasy going and never really saw him get mad.” (RR: Vol. 66 p. 131) Latrice\n\nBrown, the mother of the Defendant’s daughter, Kurstyne, testified that when she\n\nwas arrested, Frank stepped in and cared for Kurstyne for three years.(RR: Vol. 68\n\np. 109-110) She said Frank continued to support Kurstyne and her other children.\n\n(RR: Vol. 68 p. 112)\n\n\n                                         114\n\f      Mr. Davis was never convicted of a violent offense. Margaret Brown-Lewis,\n\na detective with the Dallas County Sheriff’s Department in the identification\n\nsection testified that the Defendant was convicted for theft $1,500 but less than\n\n$2,000, revoked and punishment set at 15 months in State jail; evading arrest\n\nFebruary 26, 2001; failure to identify on February 26, 2001 and the misdemeanor\n\noffense of fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer on October 1, 2007.\n\n      The State presented evidence that Mr. Davis escaped from Parkland Hospital\n\nin 2012. Deputy Steven Underwood testified that while removing Mr. Davis’\n\nhandcuffs so he could shower, Mr. Davis told him “Sorry, man” , took his gun and\n\nran out of the hospital room. During this episode Mr. Davis knocked on the door of\n\nMary Cassio but did not enter, threaten her or show the gun when she would not let\n\nhim into the house. (RR: Vol. 66 p. 196) He left the gun he had taken from the\n\ndeputy wrapped in his sock in the front yard of Ms. Cassio. (RR: Vol. 66 p. 189)\n\nMr. Davis was arrested a short time later without incident. (RR: Vol. 67 p. 67)\n\nAppellant submits that in his escape attempt, Mr. Davis was not violent.\n\n      Ed Chattaway of the Texarkana Police Department testified that Mr. Davis\n\ngave him information about a pending armed robbery and Mr. Davis helped the\n\npolice take his uncle off the streets. (RR: Vol. 67 p. 196-197) Mr. Davis grew up in\n\na very violent neighborhood in St. Louis Missouri and at a young age his mother\n\n                                        115\n\fwas shot in the head point blank with a 12-gauge shotgun after she had been raped\n\nand sodomized. (RR: Vol. 67 p. 168)\n\n      Rose McGill, a foster mother, testified that she cared for Frank Davis when\n\nhe was 15 years old and he was well behaved during the year he lived in her home.\n\n(RR: Vol. 67 p. 227) Brenda Griffin testified that when Frank was in the Youth\n\nHome in Little Rock, Arkansas he was never a discipline problem. (RR: Vol. 68 p.\n\n28) Pat Gill, a counselor, also testified that while Frank was in the Youth Home,\n\nhe was always respectful, polite and got along with everybody. (RR: Vol. 68 p. 34)\n\n      Appellant submits that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury’s\n\naffirmative answer to Special Issue No. 1. See also Beltran v. State of Texas, 728\n\nS.W. 2d 382 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987), Ellason v. State, 815 S.W.2d 656 (Tex.\n\nCrim.App. 1991) and cases cited therein, Benz v. State, 233 S.W.3d 847 (Tex.Crim.\n\nApp. 2007)\n\n\n\n\n                                        116\n\f         DEFENSE REQUESTED PUNISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS\n\n    Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Reporter’s Record\nVolume 3 p. 174-189 and to Defense’s Pretrial Motions objection to the charge\nin punishment.(Clerk’s Record Vol. 2 pp. 120-138) Trial counsel filed two sets\nof objections and/or motions either objecting to the statutory charge in Art.\n37.071 C.C.P. or requesting that the issues and instructions that were to be\nsubmitted be altered to provide definitions in greater specificity in the special\nissues for the jury. The Court overruled or denied all the Defense’s objections\nor requested instructions.\n   Appellant’s counsel on appeal believes this Court has addressed the issues\nraised by objection or requested instructions on appeal previously over an\nextended period of time. Appellant is submitting each objection or requested\ninstruction as a separate issue on appeal. Even though this Court has\npreviously overruled the issues raised in a same or similar context previously,\ntrial counsel raised them in written pretrial motions. Appellant’s appellate\ncounsel seeks to preserve each sub-issue without waiver for any potential\nFederal review of the issues in the future. Additionally, Appellant moves this\nCourt to reconsider prior rulings on each requested jury charge instruction on\nobjection as it applies to the case at bar.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25\n\n THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT’S OBJECTION\n     TO CERTAIN LANGUAGE IN THE BODY OF THE COURT’S\n    INSTRUCTIONS TO THE JURY IN THE PUNISHMENT STAGE\n\n        Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Reporter’s Record\n\nVol. 3 pp. 174-189 at which the following objections to the punishment charge\n\nwere made. Appellant made the following objection to the language used in the\n\npunishment charge:\n\n\n\n\n                                      117\n\f OBJECTIONS TO LANGUAGE IN THE BODY OF THE INSTRUCTIONS\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (1)\n\n      1. The Defendant objects to the Court's use of the language \"In order for the\n\nCourt to assess proper punishment...\". This language minimizes each juror's role\n\nand diminishes their sense of responsibility for the ultimate sentence in the case,\n\nparticularly a death sentence. This failure violates the protections afforded to the\n\nDefendant under the 8th ,11th and 14th Amendments to the United States\n\nConstitution. Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320 (1985).\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (2)\n\n      2. The Defendant objects to the Court's instructing each juror as if it he/she\n\nwere one decision making body. The jurors are individuals, each of them is making\n\nan individual decision, not a group decision. It only takes one to return a life\n\nverdict. Wiggins v. Smith, 123 S.Ct. -252,7 (2003).\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (3)\n\n      3. The Defendant objects to the Court's instructing each juror that he or she is\n\nto \"determine\" or \"shall answer\" and using language such as \"arriving at the\n\nanswers to\" any of the Special Issues. Tex.C.Crim. P. Art. 37.071 does not require\n\nthat each juror agree on answers to any of the Special Issues. If there is a failure to\n\nagree, a life sentence results. Jurors should be instructed using some form of the\n\n                                          118\n\fword \"consider\" rather than \"determine\" or \"answer\" and in no event should they\n\nbe instructed that they \"shall\" answer any Special Issue.\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (4)\n\n      4. The Defendant objects to the Court instructing the jurors that \"The\n\nmandatory punishment for the offense of capital murder\" is death or life\n\nimprisonment. Death is not a mandatory punishment. Tex.P.C.§,12.31. When the\n\npenalties of life imprisonment and death are used together, they should be referred\n\nto as \"mandatory options\".\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (5)\n\n      5. The Defendant objects to the Court instructing each juror that in\n\nconsidering the Special Issues that each is to consider \"...all evidence submitted to\n\nthem in the whole trial.\" This incorrectly assumes that all evidence that has been\n\noffered during the culpability phase of the trial is relevant to the individual jurors'\n\nconsideration of the individual Special Issues. This language encourages each juror\n\nto return a general verdict of death that may be totally unrelated to the specific\n\nquestions contained in the Special Issues.\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (6)\n\n      6. Subject to objections raised herein to the court's use of the phrase \"all of\n\nthe evidence\", the Defendant objects to the failure of the Court to instruct the jury\n\n                                          119\n\fthat its directive to consider \"all of the evidence\" set forth in the special issue\n\nregarding mitigation, controls over the definition of \"mitigating evidence\" set forth\n\nelsewhere in the charge.\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (7)\n\n      7. The Defendant objects, on multiple grounds, to the Court instructing each\n\njuror that he or she is to consider evidence that \"militates for or mitigates against\n\nthe imposition of the death penalty.\n\n      (a) The language of Tex.C.Crim.P. Art. 37.071 Sec.2 limits sentencing phase\n\n      evidence of character, background and circumstances of the offense to that\n\n      which \"mitigates against the imposition of the death penalty\". The statute\n\n      does not say that this evidence can be used to militate in favor of the death\n\n      penalty. It is inappropriate to instruct the jury (although elsewhere the statute\n\n      requires it) when such instruction is inconsistent with express language of\n\n      Art. 37.071 as to what is admissible in the sentencing phase of the trial.\n\n      (b)Each juror will be instructed to consider specific Special Issues, not to\n\n      return a general verdict of life or death. This instruction encourages them to\n\n      disregard the specific questions embodied in the Special Issues and return a\n\n      general verdict based on the view of whether the Defendant deserves the\n\n      death penalty.\n\n                                          120\n\f      (c) Tex.C.Crim.P.Art. 37.071 mandates that each juror be instructed with\n\n      this language only with respect to Special Issue #1 (future danger issue) and\n\n      Special Issue #2 (and-parties i when applicable. It is not appropriate for\n\n      juror's consideration of Special Issue #3 (the mitigation issue) and the Court\n\n      has not made this clear.\n\n      (d) The Defendant objects to the proposed charge, at page            , inasmuch as\n\n      it instructs the jury to \"consider all evidence ... that militates for ... the\n\n      imposition of the death penalty.\" There is no basis in law for this instruction,\n\n      which lies outside the special issues and obviates the constitutionally\n\n      mandated requirement that specific, statutorily sanctioned aggravators—and\n\n      only such aggravators—be used to distinguish capital Defendants for whom\n\n      the death penalty is appropriate from those for whom it is not.\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (8)\n\n      8. Without waiving the foregoing objections, the Defendant objects to the\n\nCourt's failure to define the word \"militates\" as used in the instructions on page of\n\nthe charge so that the Defendant's age, race, sex, national origin, religion, political\n\nviewpoints, sexual orientation or other irrational factors may not be used to support\n\na death sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                           121\n\f                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (9)\n\n      9. The Defendant objects to the proposed instruction, on page        ,\n\napparently derived from CCP Art. 37.071 Sec. 2(d)(1), to the extent that it charges\n\nthe jury that, in deliberating upon the special issue on \"future dangerousness,\" it \"...\n\nshall consider the evidence of the Defendant's background or character or the\n\ncircumstances of the offense ...\". This instruction permits and encourages each\n\njuror to nullify the terms and elements of the future dangerousness special issue,\n\n(by using or even substituting background, character and the facts of the offense as\n\naggravators) and to return an affirmative finding on that issue, which is not based\n\non a juror's honest assessment of the future threat posed by the Defendant.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (10)\n\n      10. The Defendant objects to the Court wording the instructions so that the\n\n\"death option\" is always listed first, such as when reference is made to the\n\nsentencing options of life or death or the possible answers \"YES\" or \"NO\" that\n\nwould lead to a life or death sentence. There is no presumption that death is the\n\nappropriate punishment. In fact, life is presumed and the law is always satisfied\n\nwith a life verdict. Tex.P.C. § 12.31 \"Capital Felony\" provides that a Defendant in\n\na capital case where death is sought \"shall be punished by imprisonment in the\n\ninstitutional division for life or by death\". If the punishment phase were stopped at\n\n                                          122\n\fany time prior to a \"NO\" answer to the mitigation issue, the mandatory verdict\n\nwould be life. These instructions erroneously imply that death is the \"preferred\" or\n\n\"default\" punishment.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (11)\n\n      11. The Defendant objects to the Court instructing jurors that \"You may not\n\nanswer Special Issue No. 1 \"NO\", (that the Defendant is NOT a future danger)\n\nunless ten (10) or more jurors agree. This statement (although contained in Art.\n\n37.071) is not truthful. If the jurors cannot agree to the answer on any special issue,\n\nthe Defendant is automatically sentenced to life. There is nothing significant to ten\n\n(10) jurors other than the arbitrarily high number chosen by the legislature to\n\nmislead each juror, to discourage and effect the intimidation of minority holdout\n\njurors so that the number of death verdicts returned in the state are maximized.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (12)\n\n      12. As noted in the Preamble to these Objections, studies of jury instructions\n\nhave found that each juror rarely understands them. This is in part because of\n\nconfusing language chosen by the legislature and the Courts. The Defendant\n\nobjects to the following language used in the proposed charge: \"Members of the\n\njury need not agree on what particular evidence supports a negative answer to\n\nSpecial Issue No. 1\". Each juror should be more clearly instructed that \"None of\n\n                                         123\n\fyou have to agree on why you vote \"NO\" on Special Issue No. 1 or why you vote\n\n\"YES\" on Issue No. 2 (the mitigation issue). The Defendant objects to the Court's\n\nfailure to so charge each juror in this case.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (13)\n\n      13.The Defendant objects to the Court instructing each juror that the State's\n\nproof must only exclude \"all reasonable doubt\".\n\n   (a) Art. 37.071, as well as the 8th Amendment jurisprudence, (see Apprendi,\n\n   Ring and Blakely cited herein) requires the State to prove \"future\n\n   dangerousness\" and \"antiparties\" issues beyond a reasonable doubt, meaning\n\n   that less than a reasonable doubt remains in the jurors mind before the burden is\n\n   established. The Court's instruction negates the important meaning of the word\n\n   \"beyond\".\n\n   (b) This is an attempt by the court to define what is a reasonable doubt is in\n\n   violation of Paulson v. State, 28 S.W.3d 570 (Tex.Crim. App. 2000).\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (14)\n\n      14. The Defendant objects to the Court failing to instruct each juror that each\n\nof them, individually, is to determine what \"a reasonable doubt\" means to them.\n\nThe Defendant requests the Court to provide this instruction.\n\n\n\n\n                                          124\n\f                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (15)\n\n      15. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure, to require the State to\n\nnegate, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of a circumstance, that would\n\njustify a sentence of life rather than death. See Ring v. Arizona, 121 S.Ct. 1263\n\n(2002); Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000) and Blakely v. Washington,\n\n124 S.Ct. 2783 (2004).\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (16)\n\n      16. The Defendant objects to the Court's limitation on the scope of\n\nmitigating evidence to that which a juror might regard as \"reducing the Defendant's\n\nmoral blameworthiness\". Tennard v. Dretke, 124 S.Ct. 2562 (2004), Lockett v.\n\nOhio, 438 -U.S. 586 (1978), Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104(1982) and\n\nHitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U.S. 393 (1987).\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (17)\n\n      17. The Defendant objects to the Court instructing each juror that he or she is\n\nnot to be \"-swayed by mere sentiment, conjecture or sympathy...\" when referring to\n\nthe jurors consideration of the mitigation issue. While this limiting admonition is\n\ncertainly appropriate when addressing the jurors consideration of any victim impact\n\nevidence (and this Defendant specifically requests the Court to so instruct each\n\njuror), this limiting admonition unlawfully and unconstitutionally limits the scope\n\n                                         125\n\fof mitigating evidence and or circumstances that a juror may consider in returning\n\na life sentence.\n\n                       APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (18)\n\n      18. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to instruct each juror that:\n\n    The opinion of each juror is to be respected. No juror shall bully, harass or\nintimidate another juror for any reason. Should any juror feel that he or she is being\nbullied or intimidated, he or she is to inform the court by passing a note to the\nbailiff who will immediately deliver such note to the court.\" The person chosen as\nforeperson is charged with the responsibility to ensure that the opinion of each\njuror is to be respected and that no juror is bullied, harassed or intimidated.\n\n                       APPELLANT’S ISSUE NOS. 26-34\n\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE ENUMERATED\n DEFENDANT’S OBJECTION TO THE PUNISHMENT VERDICT FORM\n\n      Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Clerk’s Record Volume\n\n pp. 180-189 at which the following objections to the punishment charge verdict\n\nform were made. Appellant made the following objections to the verdict form:\n\n   ....\n\n      The Defendant hereby requests the Court to include this language in the\n\ncharge to each of the jurors.\n\n      Appellant argues that he should have been given these requested instructions\n\nand or his objections to the punishment charge should have been granted as\n\nrequested by trial counsel contrary to the cases of Threadgill v.

See Jones v. U.S.,\n\n526 U.S. 227 (1999). Ring v. Arizona, 121 S.Ct. 1263 (2002); Apprendi v.

The Defendant objects to the failure of the Court to instruct each juror that\n\nthe word \"probability\" as used in the first special issue, inquiring into future\n\ndangerousness, means a high probability, at least 95%, and to make a proper\n\napplication of such law to the facts.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 28 (2)\n\n      2.

If the Court overrules the above objections, the Defendant objects to the\n\nfailure of the Court to instruct each juror that the word \"probability\" as used in the\n\nfirst special issue, inquiring into future dangerousness, means a high probability, at\n\nleast 60%, and to make a proper application of such law to the facts.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 28 (9)\n\n      9. If the Court overrules the above objections, the Defendant objects to the\n\nfailure of the Court to instruct each juror that the word \"probability\" as used in the\n\nfirst special issue, inquiring into future dangerousness, means a high probability, at\n\nleast 55%, and to make a proper application of such law to the facts.\n\n                       APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 28 (10)\n\n      10. If the Court overrules the above objections, the Defendant objects to the\n\nfailure of the Court to instruct each juror that the word \"probability\" as used in the\n\nfirst special issue, inquiring into future dangerousness, means a high probability, at\n\nleast a standard of \"more likely than not\", and to make a proper application of such\n\nlaw to the facts.\n\n\n\n                                         130\n\f                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 28 (11)\n\n      11. Without intending to waive his above objections, but still insisting\n\nthereon, the Defendant objects to the failure of the Court to instruct each juror that\n\nthe word \"probability\" as used in the first special issue, inquiring into future\n\ndangerousness, means \"more likely than not\".\n\n                      \"CRIMINAL ACTS OF VIOLENCE\"\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 29 (1)\n\n      12. The Defendant objects to the failure of the Court to instruct each juror\n\nthat the phrase \"criminal acts of violence\" as used in the first special issue,\n\ninquiring into future dangerousness, DOES MEAN serious criminal activity,\n\ncausing serious bodily injury or death; not trivial, accidental, reckless, or highly\n\nprovoked acts and to make a proper application of such law to the facts.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 29 (2)\n\n      13. The Defendant objects to the failure of the Court to instruct each juror\n\nthat the phrase \"criminal acts of violence\" as used in the first special issue,\n\ninquiring into future dangerousness, DOES NOT MEAN mere property crimes, not\n\nin conjunction or combination with crimes causing serious bodily injury or death,\n\nand to make a proper application of such law to the facts.\n\n\n\n                                          131\n\f                   \"CONTINUING THREAT TO SOCIETY\"\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 30 (1)\n\n      14. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to instruct each juror that\n\n\"continuing threat to society\" does not mean \"any threat of harm or death, no matter\n\nhow minor or remote, that might hypothetically be posed, in any place, in or out of\n\nprison, for any length of time after the jury verdict, no matter how short,\" but\n\ninstead means \"a clear and present threat of serious bodily injury or death to others\n\nwhile in prison, if serving a life sentence.\"\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 30 (2)\n\n      15.The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to instruct each juror that\n\n\"continuing threat to society\" does not mean \"any threat of harm or death, no matter\n\nhow minor or remote, that might hypothetically be posed, in any place, in or out of\n\nprison, for any length of time after the jury verdict, no matter how short,\" but\n\ninstead means that the Defendant will be so incorrigible that his acts of violence\n\nwill continue throughout his life.\"\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 30 (3)\n\n      16. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to submit a definitional\n\ninstruction to each of the jurors defining \"continuing threat to society\" so as to\n\nselect only the \"worst of the worst\" for the death penalty.\n\n                                          132\n\f                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 30 (4)\n\n      17. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to define these terms because\n\nthe term \"probability\" without proper explanation, may mean to a juror no more\n\nthan a bare chance, criminal acts of violence may mean no more than traffic\n\nviolations, \"threat\" no more than minor property damage or loss, and \"continuing\"\n\nmay similarly mean only for a very short time. The failure to define such important\n\nterms may well be regarded by jurors as strategic in that it implies that death is the\n\npreferred sentence and amounts to a subtle comment on the weight of the evidence\n\nto be considered under both special issues. Consideration of mitigating\n\ncircumstances may then become conditional upon, and perhaps related to, a \"future\n\ndangerousness\" finding far too easily made. Given such an invitation to trivialize\n\nthe process as this language affords, jurors may well fail to give serious\n\nconsideration to any of the mitigating evidence before them.\n\n                        \"VICTIM IMPACT EVIDENCE\"\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 31 (1)\n\n      18. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to limit each juror's\n\nconsideration of victim impact evidence such that it is not to be considered in\n\nconnection with the future dangerousness special issue.\n\n\n\n                                         133\n\f                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 31 (2)\n\n      19. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to instruct each juror that\n\nvictim character or impact evidence does not meet or relieve the State of its burden\n\nto prove the continuing threat issue beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 31 (3)\n\n      20. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to instruct each juror he or\n\nshe is not to use the victim evidence to make any comparative worth analysis which\n\nwould include victim's worth to the community, or to his family, as compared to\n\nother members of society, or victim's worth compared to worth of the Defendant.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 31 (4)\n\n      21. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to instruct each juror to\n\ndisregard victim impact evidence that was not shown to be within the knowledge or\n\nreasonable expectation of the Defendant. See also Will v. State, 2004 WL 3093238\n\n(2004) and Espada v. State, 2008 WL 4809235 (2008).\n\n                              MITIGATION ISSUE\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 32 (1)\n\n      22. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure, to require the State to\n\nnegate, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of a circumstance, that would\n\njustify a sentence of life rather than death. See Ring v. Arizona, 121 S.Ct. 1263\n\n                                         134\n\f(2002); Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000) and Blakely v.

(Renumbered) The Defendant objects to the failure of the Court's\n\ninstructions to explain to each juror that his or her finding of guilt in the first phase\n\nof the trial does not foreclose consideration of evidence which they believe could\n\nserve as a basis for a sentence less than death.\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 32 (3)\n\n      23. The Defendant objects to the Court instructing each juror that he or she is\n\nto consider whether there is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances\n\nto warrant that a sentence of imprisonment rather than a death sentence be imposed.\n\nThis is unnecessarily confusing to a juror because if \"one circumstance\" is enough,\n\nwhy is each juror instructed to consider circumstances (plural)?\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 32 (4)\n\n      24. The Defendant objects to the Court instructing each juror to consider if a\n\ncircumstance or circumstances is sufficient to \"warrant that a sentence of life\n\nimprisonment rather than a death sentence be imposed\". This instruction\n\nerroneously implies to each juror that a \"YES\" answer on the mitigation issue is\n\nrequited to rescue the Defendant from a death verdict that is already in place. This\n\n                                          135\n\fis an inaccurate and misleading statement of the law. If there is anything but a\n\n\"NO\" answer on the mitigation issue, the mandatory verdict is LIFE.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 32 (5)\n\n       25. The Defendant objects to the failure of the Court to provide a rational\n\nsentencing process in that the punishment charge fails to inform the jury whether\n\nthe phrase \"personal moral culpability,\" used in the special issue regarding\n\nmitigation, has the same meaning as the phrase \"moral blameworthiness\" in the\n\ndefinition of mitigating evidence related to that special issue.\n\n      The mitigation issue instructs the jurors to consider the Defendant's\n\n\"personal moral culpability\" in determining if there is a sufficient \"mitigating\n\ncircumstance\" that would justify a sentence of life. They are then told that\n\n\"mitigating evidence\" is evidence that a juror might regard as reducing the\n\ndefendant's \"moral blameworthiness\". The term \"mitigating evidence\" is not used\n\nin the definition. The failure to define terms and the confusing way in which terms\n\n(and terms similar to terms) denies to the Defendant, and to each juror, the benefits\n\nof a constitutionally mandated sentencing process.\n\n      26. Omitted\n\n\n\n\n                                         136\n\f                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 32 (6)\n\n      27. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to provide a reasoned and\n\nrational moral process for the consideration and giving of effect to mitigating\n\ncircumstances. (i.e., no burden of proof, no standard of proof, no guidance as to the\n\nnature and strength of the presumption in favor of death that may arise, if at all,\n\nfrom the future dangerousness finding, etc.).\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 33 (7)\n\n      28. The Defendant objects to the failure of the Court to provide a rational\n\nsentencing process in that the punishment charge fails to inform the jury of any\n\ndifference in the meaning of the phrase \"personal moral culpability,\" used in the\n\nspecial issue regarding mitigation, and the phrase \"moral blameworthiness\" in the\n\ndefinition of mitigating evidence related to that special issue.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 32 (8)\n\n      29. The Defendant objects to the failure of the Court to provide a clear,\n\nunderstandable and rational sentencing process which does not require the jury to\n\nnullify or ignore one part of the charge in order to follow another. The court's\n\ndirective to consider \"all of the evidence\" set forth in Special Issue No. 2 regarding\n\nmitigation, conflicts with the definition of \"mitigating evidence\" set forth\n\nelsewhere, at page in the charge, resulting in an irrational process which interferes\n\n                                         137\n\fwith the jury's ability to make a reasoned moral response to the evidence before\n\nthem. Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302 (1989)(Penry I); Penry v. Johnson, 121 S.\n\nCt. 1910 (2001)(Penry II)\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 32 (9)\n\n      30. The Defendant objects to the punishment charge as a whole because it\n\nfails to permit a discretionary grant of mercy based on mitigating circumstances\n\nunburdened by the jurors' perhaps strong desire to deter others from committing\n\nsimilar crimes or unbound by the unconstitutional requirement that there be a nexus\n\nbetween the mitigating evidence and the Defendant's \"moral blameworthiness\" for\n\nthe commission of the offense.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 33 (1)\n\n                             MISLEADING JURORS\n\n      31.The Defendant objects to the failure of the Court's charge to inform each\n\njuror that if he or she does not unanimously agree on any special issue that a life\n\nverdict is the automatic sentence. This failure to inform the jury of all their options\n\nprovided by our law renders our capital sentencing process irrational and unreliable\n\nunder the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and allows for a wanton and freakish\n\napplication of the death penalty. The making of such a material omission of\n\napplicable law in the charge to the jury denies the jurors the equal protection of the\n\n                                         138\n\flaw and due process of law in that it subverts and distorts their right to freely\n\nparticipate in the criminal justice system. The judge, the prosecutors, the defense\n\ncounsel, even the bailiff, likely know the effect of a holdout juror; the jurors\n\nthemselves deserve, and through the undersigned counsel, demand fair and equal\n\ntreatment under the law. Since the jurors are not in a position to assert their rights\n\nin this regard, the Defendant may do so. See Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79\n\n(1986).\n\n      The Supreme Court granted relief in Penry v. Johnson, 532 U.S. 782 (2001)\n\nbecause the jurors were requited to give false answers in their verdict in order to\n\ngive effect to mitigating circumstances. The Court's proposed instruction may\n\nlikely give jurors cause to give a false answer only because a juror would feel it\n\nimpossible to convince nine (9) other jurors to vote with them. This charge also\n\nviolates C.C.P. Art. 36.14, which requires the Court to give a charge that\n\n\"distinctly\" sets forth the \"law applicable to the case.\" Art. 36.14 simply carries out\n\nand gives effect to the Texas \"due course of law\" clause of the Texas Constitution\n\nand the-Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution; it must control over\n\nArt. 37.071, Sec. 3(3)(i), which seeks to suppress and conceal important\n\ninformation from the jurors. See also Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154\n\n(1994), requiting truth in capital sentencing.\n\n                                          139\n\f                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 33 (2)\n\n      32. The Defendant objects to the failure of the Court’s charge to inform the\n\njury that no mistrial will result from their deliberations according to the instructions\n\ngiven them by the Court.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 34 (1)\n\n                   JONES, APPRENDI, RING AND BLAKELY\n\n      33. The Defendant objects to the punishment charge as a whole because the\n\nCourt has failed to include a verbatim copy of the indictment to the charge, and\n\nfailed to instruct the jury to disregard any facts militating toward death, but not\n\nalleged in the indictment.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 34 (2)\n\n      34. The Defendant further objects to the submission of Special Issue\n\nNumber One as there is no allegation in the indictment that the grand jury found\n\nthat there is a probability that the Defendant would commit criminal acts of\n\nviolence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.\n\n                           APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 35\n\n                             PRESUMPTION OF LIFE\n\n      35. The Defendant objects to the Court’s failure to instruct each juror that\n\nthere is no presumption in favor of death, even if they find the Defendant to be a\n\n                                         140\n\f“future danger” in answer to Special Issue Number One. The Defendant requests\n\nthe Court to instruct each juror that the law presumes life, that state law is always\n\nsatisfied with a life verdict.\n\n                    APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 36 AND NO. 37\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT’S REQUESTED\n  INSTRUCTION DEFINING EVIDENCE THAT REDUCES “MORAL\n                  BLAMEWORTHINESS”\n\n (This issues are presented together as they involve the same issues of law and\n                             are similar in nature.)\n\n\n       Defendant’s trial counsel filed three separate motions entitled “defense’s\n\nrequested Charge Defining Evidence That Reduces “Moral Blameworthiness:\n\n(Clerk’s Record Vol. 2 pp. 120,126,132 respectively. The argument and\n\nauthorities cited therein are incorporated herein by reference as if set out verbatim.\n\n       The first motion pp. 132-136 attacks Article 37.071 sec. 2(f)(4) as limiting\n\nthe jury’s consideration of mitigating evidence to factors that reduce the\n\ndefendant’s moral blameworthiness and creates an unacceptable risk that the death\n\npenalty would be imposed despite the existence of evidence that would infer the\n\nbasis for a sentence less than death. The instruction is unconstitutional and\n\nnarrows the jury’s discretion to factors that only concern moral blameworthiness.\n\n\n\n                                         141\n\f      The second motion found at Clerk’s Record 2 pp. 126-130 further attacks the\n\nlaws limiting the jury’s consideration in violation of the U.S. Supreme Court’s\n\nholding that relevant mitigation evidence is “evidence which tends logically to\n\nprove or disprove same fact or circumstance which a fact finder could reasonably\n\ndeem to have mitigating value.” Tennard v. Drecke, 159 L.Ed.2d 384, 124 S.Ct.\n\n2567, 2570 (2004).\n\n      The State’s response to the motions is found at Clerk’s Record Vol. 2 pp.\n\n138-140 which further clarifies the state of the law on the issue.

(RR:\n\nVol. 68 p. 57) He said an escape is not necessarily a predictive factor that the person\n\nwill escape again. (RR: Vol. 68 p. 58) He said there will always be contraband and\n\ndrugs smuggled into prisons, but not every inmate is involved in illegal activity.\n\n                                          47\n\f(RR: Vol. 68 p. 60) He said that some inmates have what he calls “juice” and are the\n\ninmates have the power and control and intimidate other inmates.

(RR: Vol. 68 p. 61) He said the only reason they stay alive and well is\n\nbecause of the professionalism of the staff and the systems that are employed. (RR:\n\nVol. 68 p. 61)\n\n      He said that because of the underlying factors and as well as the offense he was\n\nconvicted of, the Defendant would be at the bottom of the list of having “juice” or\n\nhaving power.

(RR: Vol. 68 p. 62) He said that the Defendant will\n\nnot be an influence and his major issue with him would be keeping him alive if he\n\nwas ever exposed to the general population.

(RR: Vol. 68 p. 82) He said a prisoner always goes into the system as a\n\nG3, never lower. (RR: Vol. 68 p. 87) He thought the Defendant would go in as a G4\n\nwhich was fairly restrictive and would have an escape designation. (RR: Vol. 68 p.\n\n                                         48\n\f89) He said at the very best the Defendant would remain in this designation for a\n\nminimum of ten years. (RR: Vol. 68 p. 89) He said if he had a serious, violent\n\nincident against a staff member, the inmate is place in G5 which is the most\n\nrestrictive general population.(RR: Vol. 68 p. 89) He said that because of the\n\npremeditation of the act of assaulting the officer and escaping, the Defendant should\n\nbe placed in administrative segregation for a long time.

(RR: Vol. 68 p. 111-112) She said\n\nthey worked it out and she got custody, but Frank could visit as regularly as he\n\nwanted. (RR: Vol. 68 p. 112) She said Frank was an excellent father who took care\n\nof Kurstyne needs and even her other children. (RR: Vol. 68 p. 112) She said her\n\nother daughter, Skyler, also called him “Dad.” (RR: Vol. 68 p. 112) She said Frank\n\n                                         49\n\falways came to Kurstyne’s birthday parties and was always there for her.

(RR: Vol. 68 p. 21)\n\nThe jury answered “yes” to Special Issue No. 1 and “no” to Special Issue No. 2.\n\n(RR: Vol. 70 p. 19-20) The trial court decreed that a sentence of death be imposed\n\nin accordance with the laws of the State of Texas and the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure. (RR: Vol. 70 p. 20)\n\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\f                               SUMMARY OF ISSUES\n\n      Appellant raises issues in this brief that are categorized into the following\n\ngroups: I. Voir Dire Issues. Three issues on voir dire involving Appellant’s Batson\n\nchallenge. II. Pretrial Issues. In the fourth issue, Appellant argues that the trial court\n\nerred in dismissing Juror John Bigley, finding that he was disabled due to an\n\nemotional problem involving employment which conclusion was not supported by\n\nthe statement of facts. In the fifth issue Appellant argues that the trial court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to quash the indictment because the indictment failed to specify\n\nthe manner and means by which he allegedly committed the offense of obstruction\n\nwith sufficient specificity to allow Appellant to defend himself. Issue six is\n\nconcerned with the trial court’s error and abuse of discretion in denying Appellant’s\n\nmotion for continuance in order to develop information that defense counsel had just\n\nreceived about an extensive history of sexual abuse perpetrated on the Defendant. In\n\nIssues Nos. 7, 8, 9, and 10 Appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nmotion to suppress evidence which was obtained as a result of search warrants. III.\n\nGuilt/Innocence Issues. In the eleventh issue, Appellant argues the evidence\n\npresented at trial was insufficient to support the conviction for capital murder. In\n\nissue no. 12, Appellant argues that the trial court erred in overruling his objection two\n\nphotographs as being more prejudicial than probative. Appellant argues in Issue Nos.\n\n                                           51\n\f13-19 that the trial court erred in sustaining Defense Exhibits A-G which were\n\nrecordings made of the victim. Appellant sought to introduce these compilation of\n\nrecordings of the victim to support his defense that he did not commit the aggravating\n\noffense of obstruction which elevates this murder case to the potential death penalty\n\npunishment option. In issues nos. 20, 21, and 22 Appellant argues that the trial court\n\nerred in sustaining the State’s objection to the witness Arty Hayes, Ashley Sims and\n\nLamar Leggiton who were called by the defense. Appellant argues that the statements\n\nmade by Appellant to any of these three witnesses that the proffered evidence was\n\nadmissible as non hearsay prior consistent statements. In Issue 23 Appellant argues\n\nthat the trial court erred in denying Appellant’s request for a charge on anti-\n\nspeculation during the guilt/innocence stage of the trial. Appellant’s requested\n\ncharge to the jury not to base their verdict on speculation was a correct statement of\n\nthe law and should have been given to accurately guide the jury in its deliberations.\n\nAppellant argues in Issue No. 24 the trial court erred in overruling Appellant’s\n\nobjection to the State’s counsel’s jury argument when he struck at Appellant over\n\ndefense counsel’s shoulders and shifted the burden to Appellant. IV. Punishment\n\nIssues. Appellant has 18 objections to the language in the body of the Court’s\n\ninstructions to the jury in the punishment stage of the trial. In issues nos. 26 through\n\n35 involve Appellant’s objections to the punishment verdict form. V. Issues\n\n                                          52\n\finvolving constitutional challenges that have been previously raised and denied by\n\nthis Court in order to preserve these issues for possible future review in federal court.\n\n                                 VOIR DIRE ISSUES\n\n                            BATSON’ ISSUES NOS. 1-3\n\n                            APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 1\n\n      THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING APPELLANT’S\n      OBJECTION TO THE JURY PANEL BASED ON THE STATE’S\n      MISUSE OF ITS PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE IN REGARD TO\n      JUROR, SYRENE MITCHELL, IN VIOLATION OF THE DOCTRINE\n      ESTABLISHED IN BATSON V. KENTUCKY\n\n  (Appellant’s Issues Nos. 1-3 are grouped as each involves the same or similar\nissue of law. In each issue Nos. 1-3 Appellant argues that Appellant established a\n    ‘prima facie’ case for a ‘Batson’ objection. The Defendant is an African-\n     American. An objection by Appellant was made concerning the racially\n discriminatory manner in which the State exercised its peremptory challenges.)\n\n      Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Reporter’s Record\n\nVolume 53 page 26 at which the trial court conducted a ‘Batson’ Hearing. Appellant\n\nobjected to the State’s strike against Syrene Mitchell, an African-American (RR: Vol.\n\n53 p. 26) . The trial court denied Appellant’s Batson Challenge. (RR: Vol. 53 p.29)\n\n      In reviewing the qualification stage of voir dire, the record shows that the State\n\nchallenged this juror; however, the trial court denied their challenge and the juror was\n\nqualified. (RR: Vol. 22 p. 157) Mr. Mitchell had previously been a grand juror on a\n\ngrand jury and stated that his grand jury had true billed two capital murder cases. Mr.\n\n                                          53\n\fMitchell testified that his nephew was a police officer in New Orleans. (RR: Vol. 22\n\np. 94) He further testified that, as he wrote on his questionnaire, he would follow the\n\nlaw. (RR: Vol. 22 p. 96) When explaining why he circled number 3 on the second\n\nquestion of the questionnaire he stated (RR: Vol. 22 p. 99) :\n\n   A. Well, that’s a - - It’s sort of a - - The was I feel about the death penalty, in some\ncases I thing the death penalty should be imposed. In other cases, I do not. My\ndecision would be based on the type of trial and the type - - the type of murder, if\nmurder occurred and there was evidence to support that murder. The evidence has to\nbe there.\n   Q. Yeah, that make sense. We’re going to talk about the burden of proof that we\nhave as prosecutors on this case because you know that we are - - it’s our job to prove\nthe case. The State of Texas has the burden of proof in this.\n\n      Mr. Mitchell stated that there were some cases that were worthy of the death\n\npenalty, for example, “an innocence child being molested and killed, for whatever\n\nreason, by an older person. Those are the kind I would draw the line on.” (RR: Vol.\n\n22 p. 105-106) Appellant submits that this should have been the type of juror the\n\nState would want on the jury given the young age of the victim and the underlying\n\noffense of sexual assault. Concerning his religious beliefs, Mr. Mitchell stated (RR:\n\nVol. 22 p. 118):\n\n   A. I certainly don’t have any religious beliefs against capital - - capital murder.\nI’m not one of those types of individuals. I look at everything that’s involved, the\nevidence, but my religious affiliations with my particular church has nothing to do\nwith it.\n\n\n\n\n                                           54\n\f      When asked to explain his answer of “uncertain” to the statement “The death\n\npenalty should be abolished” the following occurred (RR: Vol. 22 p. 127):\n\n\n   A. It’s kind of like middle of the road. It’s kind of, like, middle of the road. I\ndon’t necessarily agree the death penalty should be abolished. Here, again, it\ndepends on whatever situation that occurs. As I stated earlier, certain situations, in\nmy opinion, warrant the death penalty, and other situations do not.\n   Q. And those situations that warrant the death penalty, are you - - are you the type\nof person that could give the death penalty?\n   A. Yes.\n\n      When asked on the questionnaire if he had “ any moral, religious or personal\n\nbeliefs that would prevent you from sitting in judgement of another human being”,\n\nMr. Mitchell checked the answer “no.” (Questionnaire p. 2) He also checked the\n\nanswer “no” when asked in the following question “Do you have any moral, religious\n\nor personal beliefs that would prevent you from returning a verdict which would\n\nresult in the execution of another human being?” Appellant submits that 21 of the\n\njurors accepted by the State answered these two questions with the same answer. Ms.\n\nKaren Coyne, No. 141A, who was seated on the jury, answered Question No. 3 as\n\n“yes” and commented that it was a very serious position to be in and the evidence\n\nwould need to be very compelling to convict any individual of murder. Furthermore,\n\nMr. Mitchell agreed that the intentional murder of an individual during the course of\n\ncommitting or attempting to commit the offense of obstruction should be a capital\n\n\n\n                                         55\n\foffense, as did all jurors accepted by the State. He had not heard about the case as\n\ndid sixteen jurors accepted by the State. When asked to rank how strongly he\n\nbelieved in using the death penalty, he ranked himself a 6. (Questionnaire P. 5)\n\nAppellant submits that Daniel Rudnisky, Brenda Morgan, Josh Stephens, Donald\n\nReeves and Kelly Cook, all jurors accepted by the State, ranked themselves a six or\n\nlower. Mr. Mitchell was a qualified juror who supported the death penalty. Appellant\n\nargues that the record supports his claim that this juror was qualified as to imposition\n\nof the death penalty and had answers similar to other jurors who were qualified as\n\njurors.\n\n                           APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 2\n\n    THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING APPELLANT’S\nOBJECTION TO THE JURY PANEL BASED ON THE STATE’S MISUSE OF\n  ITS PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE IN REGARD TO JUROR, LOUISE\n  HORSLEY, IN VIOLATION OF THE DOCTRINE ESTABLISHED IN\n                   BATSON V. KENTUCKY\n\n      Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Reporter’s Record\n\nVolume 43 page 19 at which the trial court conducted a ‘Batson Hearing’. Appellant\n\nobjected to the State’s strike against Louise Horsley (RR: Vol. 53 p. 26) . The trial\n\ncourt denied Appellant’s Batson Challenge. (RR: Vol. 53 p.29)\n\n      The State did not challenge Ms. Horsely during the qualification voir dire.\n\n(RR: Vol. 33 p. 73) The State argued that the reason they struck Ms. Horsely was\n\n                                          56\n\fbecause she circled a three on question number two on the juror questionnaire. (RR:\n\nVol. 53 p. 29) During the qualification stage of voir dire the testimony of Ms.\n\nHorsely showed that she was a qualified juror who could assess the death penalty.\n\nWhen the State explained the process of putting a person to death, she stated (RR:\n\nVol. 33 p. 28):\n\n   A. I could be a part of that decision and I did put some of the instances where I\nthought that the death penalty was justified. So it would have to based upon the facts\nand information that I heard as to whether or not I would decide for the death penalty\nor not.\n   Q. And I understand that.\n   A. But I could make that decision under the right circumstances and depending on\nthe evidence. I could make that decision.\n\n\n      Ms. Horsely spent twenty years in the United States Air Force before retiring.\n\nShe taught students in DISD the game of chess and some of her students won\n\nchampionships. (RR: Vol. 33 p. 48) Ms. Horsely agreed with the punishment range\n\nfor the intentional murder of person during the course of committing or attempting to\n\ncommit the offense of obstruction. (Questionnaire p. 4) All jurors accepted by the\n\nState also agreed with question number 12 of the questionnaire. Ms. Horsely thought\n\nthat the death penalty had not been applied fairly and had been misused.\n\n(Questionnaire p. 5-6) Appellant submits that jurors Eric Hoy, Beth Cummings and\n\nWilliam Dawson who were accepted by the State had similar answers to Ms. Horsely.\n\n\n\n                                         57\n\fAppellant submits that Ms. Horsely was an intelligent, articulate woman who would\n\nhave been able to assess the death penalty. Appellant argues that the record supports\n\nhis claim that this juror was qualified as to imposition of the death penalty and had\n\nanswers similar to other jurors who were qualified as jurors.\n\n                           APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 3\n\n     THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING APPELLANT’S\nOBJECTION TO THE JURY PANEL BASED ON THE STATE’S MISUSE OF\n  ITS PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE IN REGARD TO JUROR, FREDDIE\n    WATSON, IN VIOLATION OF THE DOCTRINE ESTABLISHED IN\n                    BATSON V. KENTUCKY\n\n\n      Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Reporter’s Record\n\nVolume 43 page 19 at which the trial court conducted a ‘Batson Hearing’. Appellant\n\nspecifically objected to the State’s strike against Freddie Watson (RR: Vol. 53 p.26) .\n\nThe trial court denied Appellant’s Batson Challenge. (RR: Vol. 53 p. 31) The State\n\nstated that they struck Mr. Watson because he had heard about the case and wrote on\n\nhis questionnaire that “life with parole would be better for me.” (RR: Vol. 53 p. 29-\n\n30) The State also argued that Mr. Watson wanted people charged with crimes to go\n\nfree while the case was ongoing. (RR: Vol. 53 p. 30)\n\n      Concerning the State’s assertion that they struck Mr. Watson in part because he\n\nwrote on his questionnaire “life with parole would be better for me” after answering\n\n\n\n                                          58\n\fthe question on punishment range on killing a witness, Appellant submits the answers\n\ngiven by Mr. Watson when asked about killing a witness as rising to the level of\n\ncapital murder, Mr. Watson stated (RR: Vol. 38 p. 21):\n\n       Q. . . ..But if you’re saying killing a witness, that doesn’t rise to the level, to\nme, of what a capital murder is that has that punishment range of the death sentence.\nHow do you feel about that?\n    A. I think it does.\n    Q. It does?\n    A. I think it does. If you kill a witness or some potential witness testifying against\nsomebody, and it’s proven that they’re responsible for it, yeah, I think that could be\nclassified as a capital murder.\n    Q. Classified as a capital murder that could have one of those two punishment\nranges if everyone lines up where it’s life without the possibility of parole or the\ndeath sentence if the facts fit that?\n    A. Right.\n    Q. Why do you think that?\n    A. Well, because there’s you know, just other avenues that a person can take. It\nwould seem like to me that to get rid of somebody for the sole case of not being able\nto testify against you, like I say, to me it just rises to the standard of a capital murder.\n\n\n      When Mr. Watson asked the prosecutor about a person being locked up until\n\ntheir trial, the State explained how a person could post bond and the reasoning for\n\nrequiring a bond. (RR: Vol. 38 p. 48-49) Mr. Watson repeatedly agreed the State,\n\nreplying “right” when it was explained to him.\n\n      Mr. Watson circled 2 on the second question concerning which statement\n\nrepresents his feelings on the death penalty. The second statement is “I believe that\n\nthe death penalty is appropriate in some murder cases, and I could return a verdict in\n\n                                            59\n\fa proper case which assessed the death penalty. (Questionnaire p. 1) All Twenty-two\n\njurors accepted by the State also circled 2 on the second question of the\n\nquestionnaire. When asked on the questionnaire if he had “ any moral, religious or\n\npersonal beliefs that would prevent you from sitting in judgement of another human\n\nbeing”, Mr. Watson checked the answer “no.” (Questionnaire p. 2) He also checked\n\nthe answer “no” when asked in the following question “Do you have any moral,\n\nreligious or personal beliefs that would prevent you from returning a verdict which\n\nwould result in the execution of another human being?”\n\n      Appellant submits that 21 of the jurors accepted by the State answered these\n\ntwo questions with the same answer. Ms. Karen Coyne, No. 141A, who was seated\n\non the jury, answered Question No. 3 as “yes” and commented that it was a very\n\nserious position to be in and the evidence would need to be very compelling to\n\nconvict any individual of murder. Appellant argues that this shows that Mr. Watson\n\nwas a stronger supporter of the death penalty than Ms. Coyne, a white woman. Mr.\n\nWatson checked “yes” when asked if he was in favor of the death penalty and further\n\nstated “Some crimes are so bad that whoever committed it, man or woman, deserve to\n\ndie.” (Questionnaire p. 1) Appellant submits that Mr. Watson was a strong proponent\n\nfor the death penalty. Mr. Watson had not heard about the case. (Questionnaire p. 4)\n\nSix of the jurors accepted by the State had heard about the case and one, Jose Vega,\n\n                                         60\n\fwrote that he had heard about the case on television and had discussed it with friends.\n\n(Questionnaire p. 4) On question number 15, a scale from 1 to 10 with 1 being the\n\nleast and 10 being most, Mr. Watson circled 8 as how strongly he believed in the\n\ndeath penalty. (Questionnaire p. 5) Nine jurors accepted by the State circled No. 8\n\nand six jurors accepted by the State circled numbers lower than 8 as to how strongly\n\nthey supported the death penalty.\n\n       In reviewing the qualification stage of voir dire, the record shows that the State\n\ndid not challenge Mr. Watson for cause. (RR: Vol. 38 p. 92) Appellant argues that\n\nthe record supports his claim that this juror was qualified as to imposition of the\n\ndeath penalty and had answers similar to other jurors who were qualified as jurors.\n\n                     ARGUMENT AS TO ALL IMPROPERLY\n                       STRUCK JURORS BY THE STATE\n\n       Appellant submits that three of the six “qualified” minority members were\n\nstruck by the State. Defense counsel made the following argument (RR: Vol. 53 p.\n\n26):\n       MR. PARKS: We object to the composition of the jury, Your Honor, for the\nfollowing reasons. There were six potential African-American jurors within the\nstrike range that we reached, Of those, the defense struck one, the very first juror, that\nbeing Johnson.\n    Two jurors, African-American jurors are actually seated. And the State struck\nthree African-American jurors, 50 percent of the available panel. That would be\nNumber 15, Syrene Mitchell, Number 27, Louise Horsely, and Number 34, Freddie\nWatson.\n\n\n\n                                          61\n\f   Fifty percent of the panel, we would suggest to the Court, shows a prima facie\ncase of a Batson violation. And we would ask that these three jurors be seated.\n\n      Appellant submits that the record supports the claim that the State violated the\n\nequal protection clause of the United States Constitution when it used its peremptory\n\nstrikes against potential jurors Syrene Mitchell, Louise Horsley and Freddie Watson\n\nin a racially discriminatory manner contrary to the holding of Batson v.

Crim.\n\nApp. 1989)\n\n             COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS—DISPARATE TREATMENT\n\n      The trial judge’s decision on whether the Appellant proves a Batson claim\n\nturns, in part, on the trial court’s observations during voir dire examination. As the\n\nvoir dire supervisor, the trial judge can readily perceive discrepancies during jury\n\nselection process. These discrepancies may include:\n\n      (1) the prosecutor failing to question any of the minority jurors yet striking\nthem anyway;\n      (2) the prosecutor striking minority jurors who gave answers similar to those of\nmajority jurors whom the prosecutor did not strike; and\n\n\n\n                                           63\n\f        (3) the prosecutor striking minority jurors who had the same characteristics\nprofessionally, socially, religiously, etc. as majority jurors whom the prosecutor did\nnot strike.\n\n      These factors may show disparate treatment of prospective jurors. These\n\nfactors should enter into the trial judge’s assessment of the prosecutor’s credibility\n\nand eventually the trial judge’s determination of the racial neutrality of the\n\nprosecutor’s peremptory challenges. See Young v.

State, it was held that where the record shows there exists a\n\ndisparate treatment in the use of a valid reason for the use of peremptory strikes, as in\n\nthis case, then the trial court erred in its denial of the Batson challenge as the clearly\n\nerroneous standard is satisfied, as in this case where the only distinguishable factor,\n\nafter a careful reading of the voir dire of all the jurors, between the jurors is race. The\n\nevidence in this case indicates that the trial judge erred in allowing the prosecution to\n\nstrike three jurors on the basis of race, despite the rationale offered by the State to\n\ncover its true motivation. See Ramirez v.

App. – Dallas\n\n1993). The State used 3 of its 12 peremptory strikes to eliminate 50% of the African-\n\nAmericans on the qualified prospective jury panel. (RR: Vol. 43 p. 19)\n\n      The Court in Greer v. State, No. 05-08-00146 (Tex. App.-Dallas June 9, 2009)\n\nfound it significant that the State in that case struck 100% of the African-American\n\n\n                                           64\n\fjurors. That Court referenced Miller-El in stating, “This remarkable disproportionate\n\nuse of peremptory strikes weighs heavily in our analysis.” The Supreme Court in\n\nMiller-El stated that striking 10 of 11 available African-Americans were\n\n“remarkable” and not likely caused by “[h]appenstance.” The fact that the State’s\n\nreasons for striking these minority veniremembers were, in large part, applied to\n\nother panel members who were not struck is evidence of pretext. See Miller-El,\n\nsupra and Snyder v.

The Court stated that the juror was adamant\n\nthat because of his work situation he simply did not feel like he would be able to be\n\nfair and impartial to both sides and to carefully weigh the evidence because his mind\n\nwould be elsewhere.\n\n        The juror was examined by State’s counsel and defense counsel. (RR: Vol. 56\n\np.12)\n\n        The Texas Constitution requires a jury in a felony criminal trial to be\n\ncomposed of twelve members. TEX. CONST. Art. V, sec. 13. The Texas\n\nConstitution further provides, however, that “when, pending the trial of any case, one\n\nor more jurors not exceeding three, may die or be disabled from sitting, the remainder\n\nof the jury shall have the power to render the verdict; provided, that the Legislature\n\n\n                                           66\n\fmay change or modify the rule authorizing less than the whole number of the jury to\n\nrender a verdict.” Id. Article 36.29 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure tracks\n\nthe language of the Constitution and provides that “ not less than twelve jurors can\n\nrender and return a verdict in a felony case.” Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. Art.\n\n36.29(a) (Vernon Supp. 1999) However, the legislature has limited the number of\n\njurors who can be excused due to death or disability during the pendency of a trial in\n\na felony case to one.

That conclusion is not supported by the\n\nstatement of facts.

JOHNSON: I want to take a moment to address our Juror Number 6, Mr.\nBigley, and some of his testimony that he gave to the Court yesterday.\n    The Court was kind enough to give us a transcript of his voir dire testimony. And\non page 12 of that, that is where the issue of his schedule is addressed. And he tells\nus that he has a new job and that he is the channel manager for Microsoft. He’s\nworking for a new company.\n    And his big concern at that time, what he told us, was that he needed to be\nfinished with our trial in time to take some seminars in early September with\nMicrosoft.\n    He never said - - he basically told us yesterday that he told us all of these things\nabout how, well - - that he was going to have all of this stuff afterwards and he was\ngoing to be concerned about.\n    All he said - - told us was that he was concerned about seminars with Microsoft in\nSeptember. He’s going to be able to do that.\n    And I will also point out to the Court, number one, based on his testimony and his\ncross-examination, or whatever you want to call it with Mr. – with Phillip Hayes\nyesterday, he indicated to the Court that, yes, he could still do this and that he could\ngive his attention to this trial.\n    That he would have to work around it. And we think he is still capable of being a\njuror on this. I don’t think that he got to the point where he would be excused.\n    And another big concern would be that, you know, it is going to leave us with just\none alternate I we let him go.\n    And if we start having other jurors coming down here and start telling us, I’m just\nworried about the precedent this would set if we start letting these people off just\nbecause they say that they’ve got some issues with work, which are not legal issues to\nbe excused from the jury at this point.\n    He is now a juror. He is not a prospective juror. He is a juror now, and I think the\nrules are a little different for him. And I just want to point out to the Court that what\nhe told us yesterday is not consistent with what he said he told us at his interview.\n\n      Appellant submits that the trial court’s inquiry into the emotional state of the\n\njuror in question did not go far enough to establish the fact that the juror was so\n\nemotionally unfit that it impaired his ability to continue. It is obvious from the initial\n\ninquiry that the juror was aware of the trial date when he became employed.\n\n                                           69\n\f         Appellant submits that there was no inquiry as to postponement of the\n\nproceeding if the continuance was granted; which would allow the juror to address\n\nhis concerns. The issue is of constitutional dimension as to the right of the accused\n\nto have his case determined by the twelve people selected and to not have its jury\n\nselection strategy destroyed by a subsequent employment issue that was actually\n\nresolved with the granting of defendant’s continuance. Therefore, the court abused\n\nits discretion in dismissing this juror without full development of the issue; an action\n\nwhich violated Appellant’s constitutional right and was harmful to his right to a fair\n\ntrial.\n\n                             APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 5\n\n            THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT’S\n                  MOTION TO QUASH THE INDICTMENT\n\n\n         Appellant directs this Honorable court’s attention to Reporter’s Record\n\nVolume 58 at which a hearing was heard on Defendant’s Motion to Quash the\n\nIndictment.

The trial court issued an order denying the motion. Clerk’s Record Vol. 3 p. 71,\n\n82 and 97. During the guilt/innocence stage of trial defense counsel reurged this\n\nmotion (RR: Vol. 60 p. 239-241)\n\n      Trial Counsel made the following argument:\n\n    MR. JOHNSON: Now, the affidavits in each those three search warrants are\nidentical except for a little additional language in the affidavit for the search of the\ncar.\n    Basically, let’s start with the search warrant for the DNA, the buccal swab. The\nfirst problem that the State has with that search warrant is that it alleges no crime. It\ndoesn’t set out that the crime has been committed. There’s some language that says\nthat there’s a missing person, but that is the extent of it. No crime - - no crime is\nalleged.\n    Then you go into the probable cause part of the search warrant, and the search\nwarrant is based on the fact that they got exigent access to some phone records for\nShania Gray. And when they got those, they saw that there was another phone\nnumber on there that has a 903 area code.\n                                           75\n\f    They saw that that 903 - - then they got exigent circumstances request for\ninformation on the 903 phone number, and saw that another person had been called\nfrom that phone.\n    And so they called that other phone number and spoke to a person that identified\nhimself as Shamica Mosley. Now, obviously, this is just a phone call to somebody\nthat answered th phone. They have no prior knowledge of this person.\n    This person said that they’re - - who they are, and then they say that, yes. They got\na phone call, and that they believe that that person could have been Frank Davis.\nAnd they base that on the fact that they have a - - this Shamica, this person they’re\ntalking to, has a girlfriend that is in a dating relationship with a person named Frank\nDavis.\n    And she claims that this person who talked to her said something that led her to\nbelieve that it was Frank Davis, but it doesn’t allege what it was that they said.\nThere’s nothing about this person that would suggest that there’s any reason to\nbelieve that this individual, Shamica Mosley, is credible or that what they tell them\nactually helps them in any way.\n    And then it goes on to say that the two phone numbers, the ones for Shania, and\nthe one - - the 903 number that they now believe, based on Shamica Mosley saying it\ncould have been Frank Davis, they find that those two phone numbers were in the\nsame proximity. But we - - that is the only - -the word they used was proximity.\nQuite frankly, I’m not sure that that actually connects the in any way at all. All\nphones are in the same proximity, I guess, if they talk to each other.\n    The only other thing that they have in there is that they say they have become\naware that the defendant, Franklin Davis, is - - is somebody that is accused of a\nsexual offense - - sexual assault offense of this- - this girl that is now a missing\nperson.\n    The last problem that they have - - and I tell the Court - - I say the Court - - I\nsubmit to the Court that none of that reaches to the level of probable cause to begin\nwith to be able to get a search warrant for the buccal swab to get the DNA evidence.\n    And the last problem is, is that they don’t have anything to even compare the\nDNA evidence to. So it doesn’t even say that there’s any real basis for getting that\nevidence.\n    So - - in the totality of the four corners of that affidavit, it fails to reach the level\nof - - of a valid search warrant.\n    Now, we will move on to the next search warrant, which is going to the premises.\nAnd it is based on this same - - it is based on the same affidavit. Now, one difference\nin that search warrant is, is that at the beginning of that search warrant, they actually\nallege that they’re investigating the offense of kidnapping,. But, again, there’s\n\n                                            76\n\fnothing in any of the documents to suggest that there was a kidnapping,\n    There’s nothing other than the fact that the mother says that she went to pick up\nher daughter at the school and she wasn’t there.\n    And there’s no evidence to suggest that Shania was taken against her will, so\nthere’s no - - there’s absolutely nothing in any of these search warrants that say\notherwise to suggest that there was a kidnapping.\n    Then we go to the one for the car. It also alleges the kidnapping. And the only\ndifference in it is, is that in that affidavit, they do put - -\n    THE COURT: Can I ask you a question, Mr. Johnson?\n    MR. JOHNSON: Yes, sir.\n    THE COURT: Did you say in the buccal swab search warrant that there was no\ncrime alleged?\n    MR. JOHNSON: That is correct.\n    THE COURT: What about paragraph three of the affidavit.\n    MR. JOHNSON: Okay. They do actually allege kidnapping. But again, there’s\nno - - I apologize to the Court.\n    That is in a different part of the search warrant where I saw the kidnapping in the\nother one. It is actually alleged earlier in the other one.\n    THE COURT: I’m not criticizing you.\n    MR. JOHNSON: Okay. Okay.\n    Anyway the problem is, is that there’s no evidence that there was a kidnapping.\nThere’s nothing in any of these things that actually say that there was a kidnapping.\nAnd it certainly doesn’t say that there’s anything to compare the DNA to, which is\nessential for a search warrant for DNA.\n    Now, when we get on - - we’ll continue on to the last search warrant, the third\nsearch warrant. And that is the one for the car. They do add an additional paragraph\nin the affidavit that says that - - that they did see Mr. Davis driving that vehicle, and\nthat is the only thing that’s different in the search warrant of those three search\nwarrants.\n    Now, and that is our argument on all of those search warrants, Judge.\n    THE COURT: Okay.\n    MR. JOHNSON: Now, as to the fourth search warrant, that one was actually\nobtained at a later date.\n    ...\n        There are four motions to suppress evidence found pursuant to search warrants.\n\nThe fourth is dated September 12, 2012. It is based on information obtained through\n\n\n                                          77\n\fthe searches conducted pursuant to the other three search warrants as well as\n\nconversations with the defendant after the other three search warrants were executed\n\nand those conversations pertained directly to some of the evidence obtained through\n\nthe other three searches. The three initial search warrants are dated September 8,\n\n2012 and have almost identical affidavits attached to them and will be addressed as\n\none .\n\n        The search warrants at issue lay out a factual history about Shania Gray’s\n\ndisappearance and of the ongoing criminal case pending between Ms. Gray and Mr.\n\nDavis, but nothing to indicate that Mr. Davis is remotely related to Ms. Gray being\n\nmissing. The only connection comes from an individual unknown to law\n\nenforcement that identified herself as Shakeema Morsley over the phone in a brief\n\nconversation with detectives.\n\n        Officers get phone records on a number with a 903 area code that appears on\n\nMs. Grays phone records as someone she has communicated with. They randomly\n\ncall numbers that are associated with that phone and a stranger answers one of those\n\nphone calls. She identifies herself as Shakeema Morsley and as a friend of Franklin\n\nDavis’ girlfriend (Ms. Arrington). She goes on to say that she received a call from\n\nthe 903 number and believes it was Franklin Davis based on “communications”. It is\n\ninteresting to note that she does not say the individual identified himself as Franklin\n\n\n                                          78\n\fDavis but rather deduced it from “communications”. It is also interesting that she\n\nclaims to have a close relationship with Ms. Arrington but describes the relationship\n\nwith Mr. Davis as a “dating relationship” in the search warrant, when according to\n\nMs Arrington’s own testimony she had been married to Franklin Davis since June\n\n2011 (RR: Vol 65 p. 349) over a year before the search warrant was issued.\n\n      The information in the affidavit attributed to coming from Shakeema Morsley\n\nis the only nexus between Ms. Gray and Mr. Davis aside from the ongoing criminal\n\ncase. Without that information probable cause can not be found to exist in the\n\nunderlying affidavit for these search warrants. In order for probable cause to be\n\npredicated on this uncorroborated statement the must be some reason to believe the\n\ninformation is truthful or reliable, neither of which is possible in this case.\n\n      When probable cause is based upon information from an informant, “the\n\nveracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge are still relevant considerations in the\n\ntotality of the circumstances analysis” Carroll v. State 911 SW.2d 210, 216. The\n\nsituation before the court in this case involves someone with even more tenuous ties\n\nto law enforcement than an informant. The affiant of these three search warrants\n\nrelied on the words of an individual that he met for the first time over the phone in\n\nthe very phone call, the subject of which is the information in the search warrant.\n\n\n\n\n                                           79\n\f      When an anonymous tip is relied upon to furnish probable cause, the informer\n\nmust assert personal knowledge or there must be additional facts showing reason to\n\nbelieve that the contraband sought will probably be where the information indicates it\n\nwill be.” Rojas v.

The instant case is similar to an anonymous informant due\n\nto the fact that no one has any knowledge of who the person is that identifies\n\nthemselves as Ms. Morsley. In addition, the proponent has also shown not to have\n\nreliable information in regard to Mr. Davis since she did not even know he had\n\nmarried her “coworker” over a year before this. Not only is there no indicia that the\n\nproponent of the information is truthful, accurate, or reliable, to the contrary the\n\nuncorroborated individual has shown to have false information.\n\n      For these reasons all three motions to suppress evidence from the search\n\nwarrants should have been granted and all evidence suppressed. When these three\n\nare suppressed it leaves no legally obtained information to base the fourth search\n\nwarrant on since most of the information found in the search warrant affidavit was\n\nbased on the three searched done with invalid search warrants.\n\n\n\n\n                                           80\n\f                    TRIAL ISSUES IN GUILT/INNOCENCE\n\n                          APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 11\n\nTHE EVIDENCE IS LEGALLY INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE JURY’S\n  VERDICT THAT APPELLANT WAS GUILTY OF THE OFFENSE OF\n                     CAPITAL MURDER\n\n\n                             STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      The State attempted to present evidence in this case to show a murder was\n\ncommitted after an alleged abduction in order to prevent the victim from testifying\n\nagainst Defendant in an aggravated sexual assault case. The indictment states:\n\nFranklin B. Davis on or about the 65th day of September, A.D., 2013 in the County of\nDallas and said State, did unlawfully then and there intentionally cause the death of\nSHANIA GRAY, an individual, hereinafter called deceased, by SHOOTING THE\nDECEASED WITH A FIREARM, A DEADLY WEAPON, AND BY\nASPHYXIATING THE DECEASED, and the defendant was then and there in the\ncourse of committing and attempting to commit the offense of OBSTRUCTION.\n\n      Appellant submits that the State failed to present evidence that he was in the\n\n“course of committing and attempting to commit the offense of obstruction.” The\n\nState failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant’s motive in murdering\n\nShania Gray was to prevent her future testimony against him in his trial on the\n\noffenses of sexual assault. Appellant argues that he murdered Shania Gray because,\n\nas he had testified, she had ruined his life by lying about him. (RR: Vol. 65 p. 102)\n\n\n\n\n                                          81\n\fThe deceased had accused Appellant of four instances of sexual assault. Appellant\n\nvehemently denied these allegations and was prepared to take the case to trial. For\n\nover a year, Appellant implored the police and his legal counsel to investigate the\n\ncase. Detective Brandon Snyder of the Mesquite Police Department, the detective\n\nthat investigated the sexual allegation regarding Franklin Davis, did not investigate\n\nthe case. The Detective did not investigate why, on the night before the outcry, Ms.\n\nGrey went to stay with her grandmother or what had occurred with her mother that\n\npreceded the outcry. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 40-41) He did not investigate the fact that one of\n\nthe outcry witnesses wrote in their statement that Ms. Grey had changed her story.\n\n(RR: Vol. 64 p. 40) The detective testified that he became aware that there were other\n\npeople present when the supposed sexual assaults occurred but he did not interview\n\nthese people. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 43) He said Mr. Davis adamantly denied the\n\nallegations. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 44) He stated that he did not look at any other boys or\n\nmen in connection with this case. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 52) The Detective said that after\n\nspeaking to the outcry witnesses who told him that Shania had been kicked out of the\n\nhouse and had switched her story, he did not do any further investigation. (RR: Vol.\n\n64 p. 53) He never spoke with the children she was babysitting when the alleged\n\nassaults occurred. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 55) He did not talk to the children’s mother,\n\nJennifer. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 55) He never went to the home or apartment where the\n\n\n                                         82\n\falleged assaults occurred. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 57) He did not consider asking Mr. Davis\n\nto take a polygraph examination. (RR:Vol. 64 p. 62) The witness testified that there\n\nwere no witnesses to the alleged sexual assaults. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 64)\n\n      The Detective testified that he never spoke to Dezire, the daughter of the\n\nDefendant and the child that Shania was babysitting, to ask if she ever saw anything\n\nunusual between her father and Shania. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 103) Furthermore, the\n\nDetective stated that it was possible that Shania had a crush on Franklin Davis. (RR:\n\nVol. 64 p. 114)\n\n      Appellant also had difficulty getting his counsel to investigate his case or to\n\nprepare for a trial. He testified that his first attorney was only interested in making a\n\nplea deal. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 154) He stated that he was innocent and did not want to\n\ntake any deal. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 154) He paid a second attorney over $10,000 which\n\nincluded the title to his car, but when his unemployment ran out and he could no\n\nlonger pay him, the attorney went before a judge and was dismissed from the case.\n\n(RR: Vol. 64 p. 169) He said Mr. Cox never filed any motions, never had him meet\n\nwith an investigator or talk to him about the State’s file. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 169) He told\n\nhim that he wanted to take a polygraph test but was told that he would have to pay\n\n$800 or $900 to take it. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 169) Mr. Hugo Aguilar was then appointed\n\n\n\n\n                                           83\n\fto take his case but he never saw him at his office and his calls were never returned.\n\n(RR: Vol. 64 p. 172)\n\n      At this point, Appellant began his own investigation by looking online about\n\nShania’s reputation. (RR: Vol. 65 p. 21-22) He bought a throw away phone for his\n\ninvestigation and sent a text to Shania, telling her he was someone else and that he\n\nwanted to get to know her. (RR: Vol. 65 p. 27) He made seven recordings of their\n\nconversations. (RR: Vol. 65 p. 30) He said that she spoke of the sexual assaults but\n\nher stories conflicted with the account she gave to CPS and the police. (RR: Vol. 65\n\np. 32) He said that these proved she kept changing her story. (RR: Vol. 65 p. 32) He\n\nplayed the recordings to his family to prove his innocence to them. (RR: Vol. 65 p.\n\n33) Appellant was certain that if he went to trial, he would be found innocent and to\n\nthis end he began his own preparation for trial. In addition to the recordings he\n\nmade, he also sent Ms. Grey fake text messages, hoping this would help clear him of\n\nthe charges. (RR: Vol. 65 p. 39)\n\n      Appellant argues that after the false allegations were made by Shania Grey, his\n\nsettled, happy life fell apart. He wanted to go to trial, to prove his innocence and to\n\nhave his life restored, but his trial was repeatedly postponed. He said his life was\n\nvery happy until the allegations were made. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 144-145) Mr. Davis\n\ntestified that Shania’s lies changed his life and he lost his job when he was arrested.\n\n\n                                          84\n\f(RR: Vol. 64 p. 145) He said he was in jail for 30 days after which he could not pass\n\nthe background check at Dr. Pepper to be rehired because of the four sexual assault\n\ncharges pending against him. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 146) His relationship with Jawanna, his\n\nwife, went downhill because of the allegations and the loss of his job. (RR: Vol. 64 p.\n\n148) He stated that he could not find another job because of the background checks.\n\n(RR: Vol. 64 p. 14) He filed for unemployment. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 149) He said\n\nJawanna started looking at him like he was less than a man. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 151) He\n\nsaid when they argued, she would throw it in his face that he wasn’t working and not\n\ncontributing. (RR: Vol. 64 p. 152) He couldn’t provide for his family anymore. He\n\nhad lost everything. The trauma of all he had been through and his frustration with\n\nthe legal system led him to purchasing a gun in order to kill himself. (RR: Vol. 65 p.\n\n41)\n\n      He said he began thinking about hurting Shania because she had ruined his life\n\nwith her lies. (RR: Vol. 65 p. 47) Appellant’s downward spiral ended with the\n\nmurder of Shania Grey, not because she was going to testify against him, but because\n\nof the hatred he felt for her because she had ruined the life he had struggled so hard\n\nto make for himself. Appellant had been accused of sexual assault, a crime which to\n\nhim was abhorrent because he and his mother had been victims of sexual abuse. His\n\nmother had been sexually assaulted before she was murdered.\n\n\n                                          85\n\f        Appellant submits that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nhe murdered Shania Grey to keep her from testifying against him. He never stated\n\nthat was the reason he murdered her, even though all the detectives tried to get him to\n\nadmit this. Appellant repeatedly told detectives that the reason he murdered Shania\n\nGrey was because “Fucked up everything. I couldn’t take care of my kids, my\n\nhousehold. Had to get rid of my car. I went from having diamond earrings and a nice\n\njob to being wiped out completely.” Appellant murdered her out of revenge and\n\nanger, which is first degree murder, not capital murder.\n\n                                   Standard of Review\n\n        Capital Murder in relevant part is defined in §19.03 of the Texas Penal Code\n\nas:\n\n.....\n\n (2) the person intentionally commits the murder in the course of committing or\nattempting to commit kidnapping, burglary, robbery, aggravated sexual assault,\narson, obstruction or retaliation, or terroristic threat under Section 22.07 (a)(1), (3),\n(4), (5), or (6);\n\n        When an appellant questions the sufficiency of evidence, the Appellate Court\n\nreviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. The Court must\n\ndetermine whether any rational trier of fact could have found each element of the\n\ncrime beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v.

The state has alleged that the underlying murder in the\n\ninstant capital murder allegation was committed in order to further the offense of\n\nObstruction (Tex. Penal Code 36.06 (2)). In a typical prosecution for murder the\n\n\n                                         87\n\fprosecution is quick to point out that it is not necessary to prove a motive. This is not\n\nthe case in this specific prosecution, the element that raises the instant murder case to\n\na capital murder is the assertion that the motive is not only provable but to the extent\n\nthat any other motive can be ruled out. Specifically, it must be proved that the\n\nmotive for the murder was Obstruction and if any other motive is responsible then the\n\ncase before us is not a capital murder but simply murder.\n\n      There are a number of underlying offenses that can raise a murder charge to a\n\ncapital murder as long as the specific intent exists, however those underlying offenses\n\nare not interchangeable. The state can not allege a capital murder based on\n\nobstruction and prove it by putting forth evidence of retaliation any more than they\n\ncould prove it by putting forth evidence of robbery. When obstruction is alleged it\n\nbecomes incumbent on the state to prove obstruction, if the state can not or does not\n\nthen a conviction for capital murder can not stand.\n\n      Obstruction and Retaliation are both enumerated offenses that can raise a\n\nmurder to capital murder if properly alleged, indicted, and proven. They are also\n\nfound in the same section of the penal code. They initially seem like similar offense\n\nbut upon further reflection they are exact opposites. They are opposing sides of the\n\nsame coin. Obstruction is triggered when the harm done is intended to prevent\n\nfuture behavior and that intention is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Retaliation\n\n\n                                          88\n\fon the other hand is triggered when the harm done is intended as revenge for past\n\nbehavior and that intention is proved beyond a reasonable doubt\n\n      Obstruction requires in part that an actor “…harms or threatens another by an\n\nunlawful act to prevent or delay the service of another as a…witness or prospective\n\nwitness…or person who has reported or who the actor knows intends to report the\n\noccurrence of a crime.” (Texas Penal Code 36.06 (2)) There was no evidence\n\npresented at trial to support a theory of conviction under that section of the penal\n\ncode. To the contrary all evidence as to motive followed along that that would be\n\nnecessary to support the allegation of retaliation.\n\n      Mr. Davis not only testified at his trial, but he also gave multiple statements to\n\nlaw enforcement and gave four interviews to television media outlets. Mr. Davis\n\ninitially denied involvement in the incident but when he gave a recorded confession\n\nabout the murder to Detective Chevellier, he explained it was because the\n\ncomplainant has ruined his life with the allegation (See States Exhibit 57 and 57B).\n\nWhen he spoke with Detective Williams in a fourth interview, he went as far to say\n\nhe had been trying to get it to court the whole time so he could get his life back (RR:\n\nVol. 63 p. 60). He also explained that he thought the recordings he had\n\nsurreptitiously made would help clear his name and was anxious to play them for a\n\n\n\n\n                                          89\n\fjury (RR: Vol 65 pps. 104-105) and that his attorney felt that these recordings would\n\nbe helpful at trial (RR: Vol. 63 p. 61).\n\n      Every interview he gave to the media (Defendant’s Exhibits 4 and 5) he gave\n\nthe same explanation for the murder, that she had ruined his life with the allegations.\n\nIt was not until he saw his daughter with holes in her shoes that the full gravity of\n\nwhat the complainant had done to his life with her accusations and he started crying\n\n(RR: Vol. 65 p. 72). At that point he retaliated against her and committed this brutal\n\nmurder.\n\n      The effort and optimism that Mr. Davis demonstrated are inconsistent with\n\nsomeone who did not want the complainant to testify—he was preparing for trial and\n\nwas feeling good about his chances of acquittal. There is an abundance of evidence\n\nthat Mr. Davis acted against Ms. Gray for the perceived wrong that she had caused\n\nhim. His motive for the killing never waivered and is summed up best in his own\n\ntestimony:\n\n      Q: Why did you hate her [the complainant] so much?\n      A: Because she lied. She ruined my life. She took everything from me.\n         Everything that I worked so hard to get, she took it. (RR: Vol. 65 p. 102).\n\n\n      The state chose to indict this case as capital murder based on the extra element\n\nof Obstruction and presented no evidence to the jury as to that element. There is not\n\na scintilla of evidence that indicates that Mr. Davis’s actions had anything to do with\n\n                                           90\n\fcurbing future action by Ms. Gray and everything points that it was revenge for past\n\nactions attributed to her by Mr. Davis.\n\n      The jury was presented a clear motive by the defendant for his actions, in order\n\nto convict him the jury would have had to ignored all evidence of that motive and\n\ninstead engage in utter guess work to come up with another one. When a motive is\n\nrequired to be proved as in this case that must be done with evidence and not mere\n\nconjecture.\n\n                           APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 12\n\n    THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING APPELLANT’S\nOBJECTION TO STATE’S EXHIBIT NUMBERS 40 AN 41, PHOTOGRAPHS\n\n\n      Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Reporter’s Record\n\nVolume 61 p. 116 at which defense counsel objected to the prejudicial value\n\noutweighed any probative value of the photograph depicting.

HAYES: Your Honor, we have no objection to State’s Exhibits 38\nand 39. I believe that they do show the terrain which the State is attempting to get at.\n       40 and 41, we do object to. I don’t - - they’re pictures of the body floating in\nthe river. I don’t believe that there's a probative value added to the testimony at this\ntime. I simply believe it’s a prejudicial photograph and it doesn’t really seem to add\nanything to the testimony, the terrain or the environment.\n\n\n                                          91\n\f             I’d ask the Court to take a look at them and do a 403 balancing test on\n40 and 41, Your Honor.\n             MR.

BIRMINGHAM: Yes, sir.\n             THE COURT: The Court concludes that the probative value of State’s\nExhibits 40 and 41 substantially outweighs the prejudicial affect. Objection is\noverruled.\n\n      Prior to the admission of the complained of photographs the Court must\n\ndetermine whether the photograph is relevant to any fact that the prosecution must\n\nprove. The Court must then determine whether any probative value that the picture\n\nmay have is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under Tex. R.\n\nEvid. 403. Reese v. State, 33 S.W.3d. 238 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). Prior to ruling\n\non the admissibility of photographs, the court must determine, reasonably (1) how\n\nprobative is the evidence, (2) the potential of the evidence to impress the jury in some\n\nirrational, but nevertheless indelible way; (3) the time the proponent needs to develop\n\nthe evidence; and (4) the proponents’ need for the evidence.

Id.\n\n      Appellant asserts that the trial court erred in allowing the State to introduce the\nphotographs in what appears to be an attempt by the prosecution to introduce\n\n\n                                          93\n\fevidence meant to appeal to emotion rather than the fact finding process. Taken\ntogether, the prejudicial effect of the State’s photographs far outweighed any possible\n\nprobative value. Wyatt v. State, 23 S.W.3d at 29.\n      Appellant asks this Honorable Court to:\n\n      1.     Review the photographs identified as objectionable by the Appellant;\n\n      2.     determine if the content/subject matter of each of the photographs is\n\n             relevant to a disputed issue that must be established by the State;\n\n      3.     determine if the photograph possesses any probative value;\n\n      4.     determine if any probative value is substantially outweighed by the\n\n             prejudicial effect of the subject matter of the photograph;\n\n      5.     consider the number, color, and prejudicial effect of the photograph(s)\n\n             itself separate and apart from the prejudicial effect of the subject matter;\n\n      6.     Find that the photographs identified by the Defendant were not\n\n             admissible upon the trial of this case.\n\n      The unfairly prejudicial effect of the above listed photographs influenced the\njury in a prejudicial manner and denied Appellant a fair trial especially in light of the\n\nfact that there was no controverted issue as to cause of death. There was no question\nfor the jury as to how the victim died. The trial court judgement and sentence should\nbe reversed and the case remanded. Appellant submits that the error raised in this\nissue affected the substantial right of Appellant to a fair trial absent prejudicial\n\nevidence (Rule. 44.2.(b) C.C.P.).\n\n                                           94\n\f            APPELLANT’S ISSUE NOS. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, AND 18\n\n      THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN SUSTAINING THE STATE’S\n   OBJECTIONS TO DEFENSE EXHIBIT A, B, C, E, F, & G WHICH ARE\n                 RECORDINGS OF THE VICTIM\n\n       (Appellant submits these issues as combined separate issues each for the\n proffer by the defense of each separate defense exhibit; A,B,C, E,F &G as each\n  involves separate parts of recordings of the victim on separate subjects. The\n Court made separate rulings as to each preferred exhibit. Each issue involves\nthe same or similar legal issues regarding the trial court’s denial of admissibility\ninto evidence for the jury’s consideration.) (Exhibit D is omitted as there was no\n                                    objection.)\n\n\n      Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Reporter’s Record\n\nVolume 63 pp. 98-115 at which the defense proffered 7 separate audio recordings of\n\nthe victim and the defendant. The State objected to each separately; which objections\n\nwere each sustained by the trial court. The Reporter’s Record shows the following:\n\n                          ...\n\n              These recordings are of Frank pretending to be somebody named \"D\"\nwhen he's talking to Shania; is that correct?\n              A. That's the way it appeared to me, yes.\n              MR. JOHNSON: We'd like to publish those recordings, Judge.\n              MR. BIRMINGHAM: Your Honor, I informed the Defense I had a\n      motion before he did that. At least Mr. Wyatt. I would like the rulings from\n      the Court before that happens.\n              ...\n              The State had the following objections:\n\n              MR. BIRMINGHAM: The first -- one of -- the title one of the tapes is\n       \"First Time Having Sex,\" and that is Shania talking about the first time that\n       she had sex. I don't see how that's relevant. I believe that it's protected under\n                                         95\n\f412 as well.\n        THE COURT: Hold on. Response to that?\n        MR. WYATT: My response she says in the DCAC interview and to\nDetective Snyder the first time she ever had sex was with Franklin Davis.\n        MR. BIRMINGHAM: I actually dispute that.\n        MR. WYATT: Okay.\n        THE COURT: Because if it’s another person, I’m going to sustain that.\n        ...\n        MR. BIRMINGHAM: Yes. The first objection, Judge, there's, I\nbelieve, six recordings in addition to the one that we played in front of this\njury.\n        Okay. I'll go through with each recording and make my objection if\nthat's all right with the Court.\n        THE COURT: Go ahead.\n        MR. BIRMINGHAM: The first recording is literally a ten-second\nrecording where Mr. Davis calls and he says, \"Okay, I'm going to call her\nright now to prove my innocence.\"And the call never goes through. It goes\nstraight to voice mail. So there is nothing from the complaining witness on\nthat case.\n        So we object under 403 and under the hearsay rules that it's an\nout-of-court statement made to the truth of the matter asserted by the\ndefendant.\n        THE COURT: I'm familiar.\n        MR. BIRMINGHAM: Yes, sir.\n        THE COURT: Okay. That's sustained.\n        MR. PARKS: Okay.\n        MR. BIRMINGHAM: No. 2 is entitled on the Exhibit 19\n\"incomplete.\" Actually, the second one on there -- I may be wrong about the\ntitle, but the substance is he's asking whether or not she has a boyfriend, has\never had a boyfriend. She goes into a story where basically she was caught\nwith a guy, and apparently they were having sex when that happened.\n        Her mom expected her to be somewhere she was not. So she leaves\nthere with this guy to go to where her mother is, and they get pulled over by\na police officer. And that's when she apparently finds out he's 22 years old,\nand she had thought he was 20.\n        And that is basically the extent of that conversation. It's about eight\nminutes long, I believe, maybe 12 minutes long.\n        Our objections there are relevance, the Rule 412, and also hearsay.\n\n                                 96\n\f       THE COURT: Response?\n       MR. PARKS: Judge, I think it probably -that it goes to the state of\nmind of the complainant, who I believe has led police to believe at least at\none point that she -- that this assault was the first sexual encounter that she\nhad ever had. And it just shows a general consistency with the defendant's\ntheory of the case.\n       THE COURT: Okay.\n       MR. BIRMINGHAM: I -\n       THE COURT: You don't need to respond.\n       The objection is sustained on all of the grounds that you mentioned,\nbut primarily 412.\n       MR. BIRMINGHAM: Thank you.\n       The next conversation is entitled \"First time having sex.\" I will state\nthat I believe that this is a partial recording and that there doesn't appear to\nbe an obvious beginning to the conversation. Okay.\n       But there is about -- again, about eight minutes, I believe, on this one.\n       And it says -essentially, he is asking her the first time she had sex.\nThey talk a little bit more about the conversation the Court just ruled\ninadmissible.\n       He says things like, You sound crazy. How many boyfriends have\nyou had? How many have you had? How many times have you had sex in\nthe past? How long -- basically how old were you the first time that you\nhad sex in the past?\n       She talks about the first time that she had sex was with this guy that\nwas in the Army that was 20 years old. She says -- he asks her, How many\ntimes or how many partners have you had?\n       And then they start talking about how, you know, who was doing\nmost of the work. I'm assuming they're -- I don't want to speculate, but\nthey're talking about during the sexual encounter, who's doing most of the\nwork.\n       I would object under 403, 412, also under 803.\n       MR. PARKS: Judge, to the -\n       THE COURT: 803?\n       MR. BIRMINGHAM: Hearsay.\n       THE COURT: Respond.\n       MR. PARKS: To the previous objections, we would also add this\nwould be impeachment testimony. This has already been admitted before\nthe jury as to her prior inconsistent statements.\n\n                                  97\n\f       THE COURT: Has Detective Williams listened to these tapes y'all are\ntalking about?\n       MR. BIRMINGHAM: Yes.\n       MR. PARKS: Yes.\n       MR. JOHNSON: She testified she did.\n       THE COURT: Okay. So y'all are going to try to offer these through\nher?\n       MR. PARKS: I believe, yes.\n       MR. JOHNSON: We've already made that offer.\n       MR. PARKS: He's already made the offer.\n       THE COURT: Response to what he just said on this particular -\n       MR. BIRMINGHAM: Judge, it does not directly contradict anything\nthat she said in the video -- audiotape that is in evidence right now.\n       THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection to what I'm calling Recording\nC for the reasons you stated.\n       Next.\n       MR. BIRMINGHAM: There's a recording and the title of it is \"AU\n3.\"     And it's basically five seconds and unintelligible, in my opinion.\nCould be Shania. There's nothing said on there. I don't see how there's\nrelevant information in there at all.\n       THE COURT: Response.\n       MR. PARKS: No objection.\n       THE COURT: Sustained.\n       MR. BIRMINGHAM: The next one is audio 0007. They're talking\nabout the fact that she's singing in church. She was on YouTube. He's\nasking her to \"Tell me a big secret\" and \"I want a big secret from you.\" And\nshe says, no, she's not going to tell him a big secret.\n       Talk about how she's built. And he mentioned 350 and she's small,\nfive-two, that's where she got her name, \"Average Height.\"\n       He talks about how he doesn't like to date females with children\nbecause there's too much drama that comes along with it. They talk about\nhow this 20-year-old she was talking about before had a child and she knew\nthat. He asks her if she ever snuck anyone through the window. She says no.\nShe ever snuck out of the house. She says no. And then they start talking\nabout the car that he's driving, which is an Impala.\n       So I would object under 403, and also self-serving hearsay. Also, I\nguess to tie back to the dude with the Army -- from the Army, that violates\n412 as well.\n\n                                 98\n\f       THE COURT: Response.\n       MR. WYATT: That's already come in about the Army stuff, Your\nHonor, when Franklin Davis -- if I can have a moment.\n                              (Off the record discussion.)\n       MR. WYATT: Judge, we'll lodge the same objections Mr. Parks has\nmade, especially the impeachment, Your Honor.\n       THE COURT: You mean theory of admissibility; you don't mean the\nobjections?\n       MR. WYATT: Excuse me, Your Honor?\n       THE COURT: You mean theory of admissibility, not objections.\n       MR. WYATT: Yes, I do, Your Honor. With the impeachment, Your\nHonor -- of all these recordings, even the ones that have already been ruled\ninadmissible, there are statements by Shania Gray. There are statements in\nthe REACH Clinic reports. There are contradictions in the Mesquite Police\nDepartment report versus what she said on the DCAC interview, versus\nwhat she said in the recordings, Judge. And that's why we feel all of these\nneed to come in together to give context to exactly what the theory of the\ndefense is, is that Shania Gray is lying about the sexual assaults coming in;\nthat Franklin Davis did not commit these sexual assaults.\n       Now, I think it's clear from the record we developed that theory very\nwell up until this point, Your Honor. And having those recordings not\ncome in to give context to exactly the veracity of Shania Gray or lack\nthereof of her veracity, handicaps the Defense to the point we don't feel we\ncan put on a proper defense.\n       THE COURT: Response to that.\n       MR. BIRMINGHAM: Yes, sir. There has not been any evidence of a\nREACH exam on Shania Gray, nor has there been any evidence about what\nshe has said to a DCAC interviewer yet.\n       And so -- as a matter of fact, Judge, they're the ones that brought up\nthe DCAC interview during their cross-examination of other officers. We\ndidn't bring that up. So they're trying to open their own door, in my\nopinion.\n       THE COURT: Response to that.\n       MR. WYATT: Also Your Honor, if we want to wait and put these in\nthrough Detective Snyder, they're going to call Detective Snyder, then we\ncan do it through Detective Snyder. If he wants what's in his case report,\nwhat's in his case file when he's called, we'll talk about that too, Judge.\nSo if we want to wait and have this hearing until after Detective Snyder\n\n                                 99\n\ftestifies to lay down a proper predicate to show about the veracity that we're\ntalking about, or the lack thereof the veracity of Shania Gray, we can wait\nuntil then.\n        THE COURT: Okay. Do you care to respond to that?\n        MR. BIRMINGHAM: Yeah. The problem is I can't call Shania Gray\nas a witness to this case because she's been murdered by Franklin Davis.\n        THE COURT: The objection to recording E is sustained. F?\n        MR. BIRMINGHAM: Actually Russell has this one, Judge.\n        MR. WILSON: Judge, F is -- we lodge the same objection with the\nexception of 412. There's not actually discussion of sexual history in there,\nbut it talks some about her baby-sitting her brother. He talks more about his\ncar and what types of customizations he's trying to do to his car.\n        He talks about a completely made-up incident of somebody passing\naway who hit their head and asked her if she's ever lost somebody like that.\n        Then it gets into -- she mentioned some things about being annoyed\nabout not being able to go to movies, the mall, or get a piercing.\n        She talks about church and some activities that she's getting ready to\nparticipate in where she might get a $400 shopping spree.\n  Again, 401, 402, 403 and 803, the discussions they had aren't relevant to\nissues in this case. I don't know how it bolsters anything that they're trying\nto do, which is, you know, to try to smear her name or anything like that. It\ndoesn't do that.\n        Again, though, it's irrelevant and, you know, if we're going to move\nalong expeditiously, we should focus on what does and doesn't prove the\nelements in the indictment. And the context -\n        THE COURT: That's enough, Mr. Wilson.\n        MR. WYATT: Judicial economy aside, trying to take Mr. Davis's life,\nyou know, I'll defer to the Court on that issue. But when we're talking about\nthe context the entire, the State put in one of the recordings. So this is a\nwhole group of recordings. It's the whole set of recordings.\n        They're trying to make Mr. Davis out to be some kind of sneaky fiend\nby saying that he's doing all these surreptitious recordings and that's part of\nwhy he's a bad person. Okay?\n        He's doing his own investigation. They put in an hour-and-11-minute\naudio recording of him doing his own investigation. Well, let's put in the\nrest of the audio recordings about his investigation and what he uncovered\nduring that investigation. And, really, it's all one set of facts. It's all one set\nof recordings. Under the rule of optional completeness, they should all come\n\n                                   100\n\f       in also.\n              THE COURT: The objection to recording F is sustained. 401, 402,\n              403 as well as 803.\n              Are there other tapes?\n              MR. BIRMINGHAM: This is the last one, Judge. It's entitled\n       \"Random One.\"\n              THE COURT: That's six? You told me six, now there's seven?\n              MR. BIRMINGHAM: Six that I did, Judge. Russell did one. The next\n       one is entitled \"Random One,\" and they're talking about how she can sing.\n       She's got an upcoming audition. She actually sings to him.\n              She talks about how she wants a particular type of purse, that she\n       used to go to Horn, and she was planning on going and moving to\n       Carrollton. That's the extent of that one. We object under 401, '2, and '3,\n       also under hearsay from the defendant.\n              THE COURT: Response.\n              MR. WYATT: Same.\n              MR. PARKS: We just re-urge on the objections previously made.\n              THE COURT: Thank you. I appreciate your defense on the case, and\n       I want to make it clear none of these rulings are being made for judicial\n       economy. That's not rationale.\n              The objection's sustained on the -- what we'll call G recording.\n              Anything else before we bring the jury back in?\n              MR. PARKS: Have those been -- I'm not sure, have they been offered\n       for the record? We offer all the recordings -\n                           (Defense Exhibits A-G offered.)\n              THE COURT: They're admitted for the record.\n                     (Defense Exhibits A-G admitted.)\n\n      As to recording A dealing with a statement by the victim about her first time\n\nof having sex in a child abuse interview concerning the allegation of sexual assault\n\nby the Defendant before this case arose. The Court sustained the State’s objection.\n\nAppellant sought to introduce this recording as part of a compilation of recordings\n\nof the victim to support his defense that he did not commit the aggravating offense\n\n\n                                        101\n\fof obstruction to elevate this murder case to the potential death penalty punishment\n\noption. The item was not submitted for the truth of the matter asserted. It showed\n\nthe victim’s state of mind concerning her mindset as to its preoccupation with\n\nsexual activity and contributed to show how she fabricated the accusations of\n\nsexual misconduct against the defendant.\n\n      The “B” recording involves the complainant about being caught with a guy\n\nhaving sex. The “C” recording involves “first time having sex” (RR: Vol. 63 p.\n\n106) and having boyfriends. The “D” recording was unintelligible and the defense\n\ndid not object to its inadmissibility. The “E” recording involves singing in church\n\nand her physically and other conduct. The “F” recording involves general\n\ndiscussion of automobiles and personal relationships. The “G” recording involves a\n\npurse and moving to Carrollton. All of the objections were sustained.\n\n      In Sanders v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">687</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.-Dallas, 1985) it was stated\n\nthat the excluded evidence constituted part of the circumstances surrounding the\n\nkilling. This time of offense does not occur in a vacuum and all of the evidence of\n\nthe surrounding facts may be properly admitted. The evidence of the words spoken\n\nduring the events surrounding the killing was not offered to prove the matters\n\nasserted, but rather as proof that the statements were made. The statement was\n\n\n\n\n                                        102\n\fexplanatory of the circumstances surrounding the killing, and would enable the jury\n\nto evaluate the evidence. See Article 38.36 Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n       Art. 38.36 EVIDENCE IN PROSECUTIONS FOR MURDER. (a) In all\n\nprosecutions for murder, the state or the defendant shall be permitted to offer\n\ntestimony as to all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the killing and the\n\nprevious relationship existing between the accused and the deceased, together with\n\nall relevant facts and circumstances going to show the condition of the mind of the\n\naccused at the time of the offense.\n\nTherefore, the trial court reversibly erred in denying each proffered recording to be\n\nadmitted into evidence; which would have affected his constitutional right to due\n\nprocess and a fair trial.\n\n                            APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 19\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN SUSTAINING THE STATE’S OBJECTION\n  TO THE DEFENSE’S PROFFERED TESTIMONY OF PASTOR ARTY\n      HAYES, THE BROTHER -IN-LAW OF THE DEFENDANT\n\n          Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Reporter Record\n\nVolume 65 p. 253-262 at which the defense proffered testimony of the defendant’s\n\nbrother in law concerning “what Franklin Davis did in the meantime after the sexual\n\nassaults arose but before the murder case and what he had done to counsel Frank” as\n\nprior consistent statements. The Court ruled that the proffer was not prior consistent\n\n\n                                         103\n\fstatements or undue influence and would not allow it.

The testimony\nthat we anticipate coming from Mr. Hayes is about what Franklin Davis did in the\nmeantime after the sexual assaults arose but before the murder case and what he\nhad done to counsel Frank, what he had talked about with Frank, but - - and we\nbelieve all that is absolutely admissible.\n               But we wanted to bring to the State’s attention that there are prior\nconsistent statements which will be asked of Mr. Hayes. And we wanted to give\nthe State - - tell them exactly what was going to be - - what we anticipate the\ntestimony is going to be.\n               THE COURT: How is the talking with the defendant not being offered\nby the defendant and therefore subject to hearsay rule?\n               MR. WYATT: We’re not asking about hearsay, Your Honor. We’re\nasking about what happened. Not specifically about what exactly was said, but\nwhat exactly happened.\n               We don’t believe it’s hearsay. We don’t believe it’s hearsay because\nit’s his statements about exactly what he was going through firsthand from the\n\n                                        105\n\fdefendant, Your Honor. And under the rules, under 801(d)1(B), when we look at -\n- sorry. When we look at prior consistent statements, there’s a four-prong test that\nmust be adhered to.\n              Your Honor, under Hammons v. State, Court of Criminal Appeals </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2356094\"><a href=\"/opinion/2356094/hammons-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2000, Texas Court of Criminal Appeals case, Your Honor, and in that,\nwe believe that the prongs of the prior consistent statement testimony have been\nmet, Your Honor. Those prongs - - would you like me to - -\n              THE COURT: Are you referring to 801(e)1(B)?\n              MR. WYATT: I’m sorry, yes.\n              THE COURT: It’s not the rule you cited.\n              MR. WYATT: Yes, I cited the federal rule that they had in this case,\nYour Honor, so I was mistaken in that.\n              The four-prong test that they have is the declarant must testify at trial\nand be subject to cross-examination, as Mr. Davis has done.\n              There must be an expressed or implied charge of recent fabrication or\nimproper influential motive of the declarant’s testimony by the opponent that’s\nbeen taken care of by cross-examination of Mr. Davis.\n              The proponent must offer a prior state in-court testimony. That prong\nhas also been adhered to or satisfied in this case.\n              And No. 4, the prior consistency statement must be made prior to the\ntime that the supposed motive to falsify arose, which is the murder charge.\n              All four prongs of that have been met, Your Honor, and we believe\nthat Franklin’s prior consistent statements, since they have been put into question\nby the prosecution, that they can absolutely come in at this point in time that he did\nnot have sex with Shania Gray.\n              That’s been questioned by the State, asked by the Defense in the\nexhibits that have been put in, all the videotapes that have been put in. So - - and\nthe recordings by the State that Franklin Davis made. All those things that have\nbeen put into evidence satisfy those four prongs. We believe that we can call\nwitnesses to testify to prior consistent statements of Mr. Davis in the guilt/innocent\nphase of the trial.\n....\n              In this case, they have put in his mental state as an issue. In the\nindictment - - from all the way from the indictment up until the cross-examination\nof Mr. Davis by Mr. Birmingham. When they go into his medical records whether\nor not he’s sought help at the hospital that day or back in May of 2010 or 2011, any\nof those times, they put that directly at issue by bringing that up. So we can\nabsolutely bring up testimony and evidence to rebut that during guilt/innocence.\n\n                                         106\n\fThat’s exactly what it’s for, Your Honor.\n              THE COURT: Okay. You may call the witness. You will not be\nallowed to put on any consistent statements. It is not a recent fabrication or\nimproper influence, as Mr. Wilson correctly argued, but you may put the witness on\nfor the other matters that you indicated. Make sure you instruct him not to go into\nany prior consistent statements. You understand that?\n\n       This Court has provided an in depth discussion of the use of the rule of\n\nevidence 801.(e)(1)(B) concerning prior consistent statements in Hammons v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2356094\"><a href=\"/opinion/2356094/hammons-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.

During this episode Mr. Davis knocked on the door of\n\nMary Cassio but did not enter, threaten her or show the gun when she would not let\n\nhim into the house. (RR: Vol. 66 p. 196) He left the gun he had taken from the\n\ndeputy wrapped in his sock in the front yard of Ms. Cassio. (RR: Vol. 66 p. 189)\n\nMr. Davis was arrested a short time later without incident. (RR: Vol. 67 p. 67)\n\nAppellant submits that in his escape attempt, Mr. Davis was not violent.\n\n      Ed Chattaway of the Texarkana Police Department testified that Mr. Davis\n\ngave him information about a pending armed robbery and Mr. Davis helped the\n\npolice take his uncle off the streets. (RR: Vol. 67 p. 196-197) Mr. Davis grew up in\n\na very violent neighborhood in St. Louis Missouri and at a young age his mother\n\n                                        115\n\fwas shot in the head point blank with a 12-gauge shotgun after she had been raped\n\nand sodomized. (RR: Vol. 67 p. 168)\n\n      Rose McGill, a foster mother, testified that she cared for Frank Davis when\n\nhe was 15 years old and he was well behaved during the year he lived in her home.\n\n(RR: Vol. 67 p. 227) Brenda Griffin testified that when Frank was in the Youth\n\nHome in Little Rock, Arkansas he was never a discipline problem. (RR: Vol. 68 p.\n\n28) Pat Gill, a counselor, also testified that while Frank was in the Youth Home,\n\nhe was always respectful, polite and got along with everybody. (RR: Vol. 68 p. 34)\n\n      Appellant submits that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury’s\n\naffirmative answer to Special Issue No. 1. See also Beltran v.

The Court overruled or denied all the Defense’s objections\nor requested instructions.\n   Appellant’s counsel on appeal believes this Court has addressed the issues\nraised by objection or requested instructions on appeal previously over an\nextended period of time. Appellant is submitting each objection or requested\ninstruction as a separate issue on appeal. Even though this Court has\npreviously overruled the issues raised in a same or similar context previously,\ntrial counsel raised them in written pretrial motions. Appellant’s appellate\ncounsel seeks to preserve each sub-issue without waiver for any potential\nFederal review of the issues in the future. Additionally, Appellant moves this\nCourt to reconsider prior rulings on each requested jury charge instruction on\nobjection as it applies to the case at bar.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25\n\n THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT’S OBJECTION\n     TO CERTAIN LANGUAGE IN THE BODY OF THE COURT’S\n    INSTRUCTIONS TO THE JURY IN THE PUNISHMENT STAGE\n\n        Appellant directs this Honorable Court’s attention to Reporter’s Record\n\nVol. 3 pp. 174-189 at which the following objections to the punishment charge\n\nwere made. Appellant made the following objection to the language used in the\n\npunishment charge:\n\n\n\n\n                                      117\n\f OBJECTIONS TO LANGUAGE IN THE BODY OF THE INSTRUCTIONS\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (1)\n\n      1. The Defendant objects to the Court's use of the language \"In order for the\n\nCourt to assess proper punishment...\". This language minimizes each juror's role\n\nand diminishes their sense of responsibility for the ultimate sentence in the case,\n\nparticularly a death sentence. This failure violates the protections afforded to the\n\nDefendant under the 8th ,11th and 14th Amendments to the United States\n\nConstitution. Caldwell v.

The Defendant objects to the Court's instructing each juror as if it he/she\n\nwere one decision making body. The jurors are individuals, each of them is making\n\nan individual decision, not a group decision. It only takes one to return a life\n\nverdict. Wiggins v. Smith, 123 S.Ct. -252,7 (2003).\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (3)\n\n      3. The Defendant objects to the Court's instructing each juror that he or she is\n\nto \"determine\" or \"shall answer\" and using language such as \"arriving at the\n\nanswers to\" any of the Special Issues. Tex.C.Crim. P. Art. 37.071 does not require\n\nthat each juror agree on answers to any of the Special Issues. If there is a failure to\n\nagree, a life sentence results. Jurors should be instructed using some form of the\n\n                                          118\n\fword \"consider\" rather than \"determine\" or \"answer\" and in no event should they\n\nbe instructed that they \"shall\" answer any Special Issue.\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (4)\n\n      4. The Defendant objects to the Court instructing the jurors that \"The\n\nmandatory punishment for the offense of capital murder\" is death or life\n\nimprisonment. Death is not a mandatory punishment. Tex.P.C.§,12.31. When the\n\npenalties of life imprisonment and death are used together, they should be referred\n\nto as \"mandatory options\".\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (5)\n\n      5. The Defendant objects to the Court instructing each juror that in\n\nconsidering the Special Issues that each is to consider \"...all evidence submitted to\n\nthem in the whole trial.\" This incorrectly assumes that all evidence that has been\n\noffered during the culpability phase of the trial is relevant to the individual jurors'\n\nconsideration of the individual Special Issues. This language encourages each juror\n\nto return a general verdict of death that may be totally unrelated to the specific\n\nquestions contained in the Special Issues.\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (6)\n\n      6. Subject to objections raised herein to the court's use of the phrase \"all of\n\nthe evidence\", the Defendant objects to the failure of the Court to instruct the jury\n\n                                          119\n\fthat its directive to consider \"all of the evidence\" set forth in the special issue\n\nregarding mitigation, controls over the definition of \"mitigating evidence\" set forth\n\nelsewhere in the charge.\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (7)\n\n      7. The Defendant objects, on multiple grounds, to the Court instructing each\n\njuror that he or she is to consider evidence that \"militates for or mitigates against\n\nthe imposition of the death penalty.\n\n      (a) The language of Tex.C.Crim.P. Art. 37.071 Sec.2 limits sentencing phase\n\n      evidence of character, background and circumstances of the offense to that\n\n      which \"mitigates against the imposition of the death penalty\". The statute\n\n      does not say that this evidence can be used to militate in favor of the death\n\n      penalty. It is inappropriate to instruct the jury (although elsewhere the statute\n\n      requires it) when such instruction is inconsistent with express language of\n\n      Art. 37.071 as to what is admissible in the sentencing phase of the trial.\n\n      (b)Each juror will be instructed to consider specific Special Issues, not to\n\n      return a general verdict of life or death. This instruction encourages them to\n\n      disregard the specific questions embodied in the Special Issues and return a\n\n      general verdict based on the view of whether the Defendant deserves the\n\n      death penalty.\n\n                                          120\n\f      (c) Tex.C.Crim.P.Art. 37.071 mandates that each juror be instructed with\n\n      this language only with respect to Special Issue #1 (future danger issue) and\n\n      Special Issue #2 (and-parties i when applicable. It is not appropriate for\n\n      juror's consideration of Special Issue #3 (the mitigation issue) and the Court\n\n      has not made this clear.\n\n      (d) The Defendant objects to the proposed charge, at page            , inasmuch as\n\n      it instructs the jury to \"consider all evidence ... that militates for ... the\n\n      imposition of the death penalty.\" There is no basis in law for this instruction,\n\n      which lies outside the special issues and obviates the constitutionally\n\n      mandated requirement that specific, statutorily sanctioned aggravators—and\n\n      only such aggravators—be used to distinguish capital Defendants for whom\n\n      the death penalty is appropriate from those for whom it is not.\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (8)\n\n      8. Without waiving the foregoing objections, the Defendant objects to the\n\nCourt's failure to define the word \"militates\" as used in the instructions on page of\n\nthe charge so that the Defendant's age, race, sex, national origin, religion, political\n\nviewpoints, sexual orientation or other irrational factors may not be used to support\n\na death sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                           121\n\f                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (9)\n\n      9. The Defendant objects to the proposed instruction, on page        ,\n\napparently derived from CCP Art. 37.071 Sec. 2(d)(1), to the extent that it charges\n\nthe jury that, in deliberating upon the special issue on \"future dangerousness,\" it \"...\n\nshall consider the evidence of the Defendant's background or character or the\n\ncircumstances of the offense ...\". This instruction permits and encourages each\n\njuror to nullify the terms and elements of the future dangerousness special issue,\n\n(by using or even substituting background, character and the facts of the offense as\n\naggravators) and to return an affirmative finding on that issue, which is not based\n\non a juror's honest assessment of the future threat posed by the Defendant.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (10)\n\n      10. The Defendant objects to the Court wording the instructions so that the\n\n\"death option\" is always listed first, such as when reference is made to the\n\nsentencing options of life or death or the possible answers \"YES\" or \"NO\" that\n\nwould lead to a life or death sentence. There is no presumption that death is the\n\nappropriate punishment. In fact, life is presumed and the law is always satisfied\n\nwith a life verdict. Tex.P.C. § 12.31 \"Capital Felony\" provides that a Defendant in\n\na capital case where death is sought \"shall be punished by imprisonment in the\n\ninstitutional division for life or by death\". If the punishment phase were stopped at\n\n                                          122\n\fany time prior to a \"NO\" answer to the mitigation issue, the mandatory verdict\n\nwould be life. These instructions erroneously imply that death is the \"preferred\" or\n\n\"default\" punishment.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (11)\n\n      11. The Defendant objects to the Court instructing jurors that \"You may not\n\nanswer Special Issue No. 1 \"NO\", (that the Defendant is NOT a future danger)\n\nunless ten (10) or more jurors agree. This statement (although contained in Art.\n\n37.071) is not truthful. If the jurors cannot agree to the answer on any special issue,\n\nthe Defendant is automatically sentenced to life. There is nothing significant to ten\n\n(10) jurors other than the arbitrarily high number chosen by the legislature to\n\nmislead each juror, to discourage and effect the intimidation of minority holdout\n\njurors so that the number of death verdicts returned in the state are maximized.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (12)\n\n      12. As noted in the Preamble to these Objections, studies of jury instructions\n\nhave found that each juror rarely understands them. This is in part because of\n\nconfusing language chosen by the legislature and the Courts. The Defendant\n\nobjects to the following language used in the proposed charge: \"Members of the\n\njury need not agree on what particular evidence supports a negative answer to\n\nSpecial Issue No. 1\". Each juror should be more clearly instructed that \"None of\n\n                                         123\n\fyou have to agree on why you vote \"NO\" on Special Issue No. 1 or why you vote\n\n\"YES\" on Issue No. 2 (the mitigation issue). The Defendant objects to the Court's\n\nfailure to so charge each juror in this case.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (13)\n\n      13.The Defendant objects to the Court instructing each juror that the State's\n\nproof must only exclude \"all reasonable doubt\".\n\n   (a) Art. 37.071, as well as the 8th Amendment jurisprudence, (see Apprendi,\n\n   Ring and Blakely cited herein) requires the State to prove \"future\n\n   dangerousness\" and \"antiparties\" issues beyond a reasonable doubt, meaning\n\n   that less than a reasonable doubt remains in the jurors mind before the burden is\n\n   established. The Court's instruction negates the important meaning of the word\n\n   \"beyond\".\n\n   (b) This is an attempt by the court to define what is a reasonable doubt is in\n\n   violation of Paulson v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1754997\"><a href=\"/opinion/1754997/paulson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.Crim.

The Defendant objects to the Court failing to instruct each juror that each\n\nof them, individually, is to determine what \"a reasonable doubt\" means to them.\n\nThe Defendant requests the Court to provide this instruction.\n\n\n\n\n                                          124\n\f                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 25 (15)\n\n      15.

If the Court overrules the above objections, the Defendant objects to the\n\nfailure of the Court to instruct each juror that the word \"probability\" as used in the\n\nfirst special issue, inquiring into future dangerousness, means a high probability, at\n\nleast 60%, and to make a proper application of such law to the facts.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 28 (9)\n\n      9.

If the Court overrules the above objections, the Defendant objects to the\n\nfailure of the Court to instruct each juror that the word \"probability\" as used in the\n\nfirst special issue, inquiring into future dangerousness, means a high probability, at\n\nleast a standard of \"more likely than not\", and to make a proper application of such\n\nlaw to the facts.\n\n\n\n                                         130\n\f                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 28 (11)\n\n      11. Without intending to waive his above objections, but still insisting\n\nthereon, the Defendant objects to the failure of the Court to instruct each juror that\n\nthe word \"probability\" as used in the first special issue, inquiring into future\n\ndangerousness, means \"more likely than not\".\n\n                      \"CRIMINAL ACTS OF VIOLENCE\"\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 29 (1)\n\n      12. The Defendant objects to the failure of the Court to instruct each juror\n\nthat the phrase \"criminal acts of violence\" as used in the first special issue,\n\ninquiring into future dangerousness, DOES MEAN serious criminal activity,\n\ncausing serious bodily injury or death; not trivial, accidental, reckless, or highly\n\nprovoked acts and to make a proper application of such law to the facts.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 29 (2)\n\n      13. The Defendant objects to the failure of the Court to instruct each juror\n\nthat the phrase \"criminal acts of violence\" as used in the first special issue,\n\ninquiring into future dangerousness, DOES NOT MEAN mere property crimes, not\n\nin conjunction or combination with crimes causing serious bodily injury or death,\n\nand to make a proper application of such law to the facts.\n\n\n\n                                          131\n\f                   \"CONTINUING THREAT TO SOCIETY\"\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 30 (1)\n\n      14. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to instruct each juror that\n\n\"continuing threat to society\" does not mean \"any threat of harm or death, no matter\n\nhow minor or remote, that might hypothetically be posed, in any place, in or out of\n\nprison, for any length of time after the jury verdict, no matter how short,\" but\n\ninstead means \"a clear and present threat of serious bodily injury or death to others\n\nwhile in prison, if serving a life sentence.\"\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 30 (2)\n\n      15.The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to instruct each juror that\n\n\"continuing threat to society\" does not mean \"any threat of harm or death, no matter\n\nhow minor or remote, that might hypothetically be posed, in any place, in or out of\n\nprison, for any length of time after the jury verdict, no matter how short,\" but\n\ninstead means that the Defendant will be so incorrigible that his acts of violence\n\nwill continue throughout his life.\"\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 30 (3)\n\n      16. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to submit a definitional\n\ninstruction to each of the jurors defining \"continuing threat to society\" so as to\n\nselect only the \"worst of the worst\" for the death penalty.\n\n                                          132\n\f                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 30 (4)\n\n      17. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to define these terms because\n\nthe term \"probability\" without proper explanation, may mean to a juror no more\n\nthan a bare chance, criminal acts of violence may mean no more than traffic\n\nviolations, \"threat\" no more than minor property damage or loss, and \"continuing\"\n\nmay similarly mean only for a very short time. The failure to define such important\n\nterms may well be regarded by jurors as strategic in that it implies that death is the\n\npreferred sentence and amounts to a subtle comment on the weight of the evidence\n\nto be considered under both special issues. Consideration of mitigating\n\ncircumstances may then become conditional upon, and perhaps related to, a \"future\n\ndangerousness\" finding far too easily made. Given such an invitation to trivialize\n\nthe process as this language affords, jurors may well fail to give serious\n\nconsideration to any of the mitigating evidence before them.\n\n                        \"VICTIM IMPACT EVIDENCE\"\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 31 (1)\n\n      18. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to limit each juror's\n\nconsideration of victim impact evidence such that it is not to be considered in\n\nconnection with the future dangerousness special issue.\n\n\n\n                                         133\n\f                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 31 (2)\n\n      19. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to instruct each juror that\n\nvictim character or impact evidence does not meet or relieve the State of its burden\n\nto prove the continuing threat issue beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 31 (3)\n\n      20. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to instruct each juror he or\n\nshe is not to use the victim evidence to make any comparative worth analysis which\n\nwould include victim's worth to the community, or to his family, as compared to\n\nother members of society, or victim's worth compared to worth of the Defendant.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 31 (4)\n\n      21. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to instruct each juror to\n\ndisregard victim impact evidence that was not shown to be within the knowledge or\n\nreasonable expectation of the Defendant.

(Renumbered) The Defendant objects to the failure of the Court's\n\ninstructions to explain to each juror that his or her finding of guilt in the first phase\n\nof the trial does not foreclose consideration of evidence which they believe could\n\nserve as a basis for a sentence less than death.\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 32 (3)\n\n      23. The Defendant objects to the Court instructing each juror that he or she is\n\nto consider whether there is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances\n\nto warrant that a sentence of imprisonment rather than a death sentence be imposed.\n\nThis is unnecessarily confusing to a juror because if \"one circumstance\" is enough,\n\nwhy is each juror instructed to consider circumstances (plural)?\n\n                         APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 32 (4)\n\n      24. The Defendant objects to the Court instructing each juror to consider if a\n\ncircumstance or circumstances is sufficient to \"warrant that a sentence of life\n\nimprisonment rather than a death sentence be imposed\". This instruction\n\nerroneously implies to each juror that a \"YES\" answer on the mitigation issue is\n\nrequited to rescue the Defendant from a death verdict that is already in place. This\n\n                                          135\n\fis an inaccurate and misleading statement of the law. If there is anything but a\n\n\"NO\" answer on the mitigation issue, the mandatory verdict is LIFE.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 32 (5)\n\n       25. The Defendant objects to the failure of the Court to provide a rational\n\nsentencing process in that the punishment charge fails to inform the jury whether\n\nthe phrase \"personal moral culpability,\" used in the special issue regarding\n\nmitigation, has the same meaning as the phrase \"moral blameworthiness\" in the\n\ndefinition of mitigating evidence related to that special issue.\n\n      The mitigation issue instructs the jurors to consider the Defendant's\n\n\"personal moral culpability\" in determining if there is a sufficient \"mitigating\n\ncircumstance\" that would justify a sentence of life. They are then told that\n\n\"mitigating evidence\" is evidence that a juror might regard as reducing the\n\ndefendant's \"moral blameworthiness\". The term \"mitigating evidence\" is not used\n\nin the definition. The failure to define terms and the confusing way in which terms\n\n(and terms similar to terms) denies to the Defendant, and to each juror, the benefits\n\nof a constitutionally mandated sentencing process.\n\n      26. Omitted\n\n\n\n\n                                         136\n\f                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 32 (6)\n\n      27. The Defendant objects to the Court's failure to provide a reasoned and\n\nrational moral process for the consideration and giving of effect to mitigating\n\ncircumstances. (i.e., no burden of proof, no standard of proof, no guidance as to the\n\nnature and strength of the presumption in favor of death that may arise, if at all,\n\nfrom the future dangerousness finding, etc.).\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 33 (7)\n\n      28. The Defendant objects to the failure of the Court to provide a rational\n\nsentencing process in that the punishment charge fails to inform the jury of any\n\ndifference in the meaning of the phrase \"personal moral culpability,\" used in the\n\nspecial issue regarding mitigation, and the phrase \"moral blameworthiness\" in the\n\ndefinition of mitigating evidence related to that special issue.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 32 (8)\n\n      29. The Defendant objects to the failure of the Court to provide a clear,\n\nunderstandable and rational sentencing process which does not require the jury to\n\nnullify or ignore one part of the charge in order to follow another. The court's\n\ndirective to consider \"all of the evidence\" set forth in Special Issue No. 2 regarding\n\nmitigation, conflicts with the definition of \"mitigating evidence\" set forth\n\nelsewhere, at page in the charge, resulting in an irrational process which interferes\n\n                                         137\n\fwith the jury's ability to make a reasoned moral response to the evidence before\n\nthem.

The Defendant objects to the punishment charge as a whole because it\n\nfails to permit a discretionary grant of mercy based on mitigating circumstances\n\nunburdened by the jurors' perhaps strong desire to deter others from committing\n\nsimilar crimes or unbound by the unconstitutional requirement that there be a nexus\n\nbetween the mitigating evidence and the Defendant's \"moral blameworthiness\" for\n\nthe commission of the offense.\n\n                        APPELLANT’S ISSUE NO. 33 (1)\n\n                             MISLEADING JURORS\n\n      31.The Defendant objects to the failure of the Court's charge to inform each\n\njuror that if he or she does not unanimously agree on any special issue that a life\n\nverdict is the automatic sentence. This failure to inform the jury of all their options\n\nprovided by our law renders our capital sentencing process irrational and unreliable\n\nunder the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and allows for a wanton and freakish\n\napplication of the death penalty. The making of such a material omission of\n\napplicable law in the charge to the jury denies the jurors the equal protection of the\n\n                                         138\n\flaw and due process of law in that it subverts and distorts their right to freely\n\nparticipate in the criminal justice system. The judge, the prosecutors, the defense\n\ncounsel, even the bailiff, likely know the effect of a holdout juror; the jurors\n\nthemselves deserve, and through the undersigned counsel, demand fair and equal\n\ntreatment under the law. Since the jurors are not in a position to assert their rights\n\nin this regard, the Defendant may do so. See Batson v. Kentucky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1986).\n\n      The Supreme Court granted relief in Penry v.

This charge also\n\nviolates C.C.P.
