Seigel appeal the\n\ndistrict court’s denial of a preliminary injunction and grant of the motion for\n\ndismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) made by Defendants-Appellees Salt\n\nLake City Corporation, Ross C. Anderson, and Corporation of the Presiding\n\nBishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. We exercise\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and affirm.\n\n\n\n                                    Background\n\n      In 1999, Salt Lake City (the “City”) sold a block-long section of Main\n\nStreet to Appellee Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus\n\nChrist of Latter-Day Saints (the “LDS Church”). The City allowed public\n\nexpression on Main Street before it was sold. Main Street was sold to enable the\n\nChurch to build a Plaza, which the City hoped would promote downtown\n\npedestrian traffic and stimulate business. The Plaza’s objective attributes and\n\nprimary purpose are different from the former Main Street. For example, the\n\nwalking surface differs from that of an ordinary sidewalk or street, the entrances\n\nare marked by large planters, waterfalls, and stone signs, and the Plaza’s stated\n\n                                        -4-\n\fpurpose is to act as an ecclesiastical park. Utah Gospel Mission v. Salt Lake City\n\nCorp., 316 F. Supp. 2d 1201, 1207-08 (D. Utah. 2004). The City’s deed reserved\n\nan easement for public access and passage, but provided that the LDS Church\n\ncould prohibit expressive conduct on the property. The property was valued at\n\n$8.124 million without reduction for the value of the easement, and the Church\n\npaid the entire amount with the easement. Id. at 1238 n.44. The Church\n\nprohibited soliciting, begging, demonstrations, protests, leafleting, and other\n\nactivities perceived as disruptive. After the Plaza was built, a group of plaintiffs\n\nsued, claiming that the City’s access and passage easement constituted a public\n\nforum. We agreed, holding that the easement was a public forum upon which\n\ncontent-based restrictions on speech could not be enforced. First Unitarian\n\nChurch of Salt Lake City v. Salt Lake City Corp., 308 F.3d 1114, 1132 (10th Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n         Following First Unitarian Church, the City sold the easement, valued at\n\napproximately $500,000, in return for 2.17 acres of land in a low income\n\nneighborhood and a $5 million recreation center to be built on that land. The\n\nsettlement agreement and amended deed specifically stated: “No Right of Public\n\nAccess – It is the intent of the Parties to eliminate any right of public access or\n\npassage enforceable by the City or by members of the public in relation to the\n\nMain Street Plaza Property.” Utah Gospel Mission, 316 F. Supp. 2d at 1231.\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fHowever, the City retained a right of reentry that could be exercised if the Church\n\nfailed to maintain the Plaza as a “landscaped space.” Additionally, the City\n\nretained certain utility easements allowing pipes and electrical conduits to pass\n\nunder the Plaza.\n\n      On August 7, 2003, another group of plaintiffs sued the City and the LDS\n\nChurch, claiming (1) that the Plaza remains a public forum despite the sale of the\n\naccess and passage easement, and (2) that the sale of the easement to the Church\n\nviolated the Establishment Clause. Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary\n\ninjunction to prevent the Church from restricting free speech activities on the\n\nPlaza on November 7, 2003. The Church then moved to dismiss the complaint.\n\nOn May 3, 2004, the district court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary\n\ninjunction and granted the Church’s motion to dismiss, holding that (1) the Plaza\n\nis now entirely privately owned and “thus beyond the reach of the First\n\nAmendment,” (2) the secular purposes supporting the easement were “both\n\nobvious and numerous,” and (3) the sale of the easement, as a matter of law, did\n\nnot advance or endorse religion because the sale was in exchange for adequate\n\nconsideration. Utah Gospel Mission, 316 F. Supp. 2d at 1224, 1238, 1239.\n\nPlaintiffs filed timely notice of appeal.\n\n\n\n                                      Discussion\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f      We review a dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) de novo. Summum v.\n\nCallaghan, 130 F.3d 906, 913 (10th Cir. 1997). Accordingly, we “must accept all\n\nthe well-pleaded allegations of the complaint as true and must construe them in\n\nthe light most favorable to the plaintiff.” Id. (internal quotations and citations\n\nomitted). The court will uphold a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal “only when it appears\n\nthat the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claims that would\n\nentitle him to relief.” Id. (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\n      The district court relied upon materials outside the complaint in resolving\n\nthe motion to dismiss, including an amended deed and settlement agreement,\n\nwhich were referenced, but not included in the complaint. Generally, a district\n\ncourt must convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment when\n\nmatters outside the pleadings are relied upon. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b); Miller v.\n\nGlanz, 948 F.2d 1562, 1565 (10th Cir. 1991). A motion to dismiss considers the\n\nconduct alleged in the complaint, whereas a motion for summary judgment\n\nconsiders the evidence (or lack thereof) upon which the allegations are based.\n\nBell v. Fur Breeders Agric. Coop., 348 F.3d 1224, 1230 (10th Cir. 2003). We\n\nhave recognized however, that a document central to the plaintiff’s claim and\n\nreferred to in the complaint may be considered in resolving a motion to dismiss,\n\nat least where the document’s authenticity is not in dispute. County of Santa Fe\n\nv. Pub. Serv. Co. of N.M., 311 F.3d 1031, 1045 (10th Cir. 2002); GFF Corp. v.\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fAssociated Wholesale Grocers, Inc., 130 F.3d 1381, 1384 (10th Cir. 1997). The\n\ndistrict court also properly took judicial notice of a 2003 ordinance. Zimomra v.\n\nAlamo Rent-A-Car, Inc., 111 F.3d 1495, 1503 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\n      The district court declined to convert the motion to dismiss into one for\n\nsummary judgment, so of course no notice issue is presented. Utah Gospel\n\nMission, 316 F. Supp. 2d at 1205 n.5, 1246 n.52. It declined a motion to strike\n\nother evidentiary material in support of the motion to dismiss after stating that it\n\ndid not rely on such material. Id. at 1246. The court then stated that Plaintiffs\n\ncould not have claimed surprise had it converted the motion to one for summary\n\njudgment without notice. Id. at 1246 n.52. This was because (1) Plaintiffs were\n\nallowed discovery in connection with their request for a preliminary injunction,\n\nand (2) Plaintiffs argued in a supplemental authority letter that the City’s\n\nmotivation to sell the easement was “uniquely factual” and could not be dismissed\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(6) or Rule 56. Id. The court then observed that consideration\n\nof extrinsic evidence “bolsters the court’s conclusion that Plaintiffs’ claims must\n\nbe dismissed because Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that a material disputed\n\nfact existed about any genuine issue.” Id.\n\n      We reject this dicta. It is true that constructive notice or a non-movant’s\n\nreliance upon evidentiary materials in response to a motion to dismiss may\n\nobviate the need for formal notice by the court of conversion. Alexander v.\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fOklahoma, 382 F.3d 1206, 1214 (10th Cir. 2004). But neither exception seems\n\napplicable here, and the non-movant should not have to guess about the court’s\n\nintention. Not having provided such notice, it is at best premature for the district\n\ncourt to express such an opinion. We treat the district court’s disposition as a\n\nruling on a motion to dismiss.\n\n      On appeal, Plaintiffs contend that this case is about motives, arguing that\n\n“the motives of both the City and the LDS Church are totally transparent.” Aplt.\n\nBr. at 36, 41. Plaintiffs claim that at the very least, they are entitled to the benefit\n\nof the allegations in their complaint that the City’s vacating the easement was “a\n\npretext for content and viewpoint discrimination,” id. at 36, and “a sham or\n\nfacade adopted to conceal an improper religious motive.” Id. at 43. They suggest\n\nthat such motivation “is a uniquely factual determination that is inappropriate for\n\ndisposition under [Rule] 12(b)(6).” Id. at 36. While this might be the case, the\n\nPlaintiffs’ position can permissibly be evaluated within the context of the\n\nhundreds of factual allegations contained in their complaint, and the express\n\npurposes of the transaction contained in the settlement agreement, amended deed,\n\nand ordinance. Having reviewed those items, and for reasons discussed below,\n\nwe conclude that the district court was correct in concluding that the complaint\n\nfailed to state a claim.\n\n      A. Failure to State a Free Speech Claim\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f      “It is, of course, a commonplace that the constitutional guarantee of free\n\nspeech is a guarantee only against abridgment by government, federal or state.”\n\nHudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.S. 507, 513 (1976). Thus, to prove a violation of the\n\nFirst Amendment right to free speech, Plaintiffs must either demonstrate that the\n\nChurch, as the sole owner of the Plaza, is a state actor, or that the Plaza is\n\nnevertheless a public forum in spite of its sale to a private owner. The Court first\n\nfound that a private property owner can be a state actor for First Amendment\n\npurposes in Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 501 (1946). In that case, the Court\n\nconcluded that the property interests of Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation, the\n\nprivate owner of a company town that did “not function differently from any other\n\ntown,” id. at 508, did not allow the company to regulate speech more strictly than\n\na municipality. Id. at 508-09.\n\n      Applying this theory, the Court found that a private entity performs a public\n\nfunction when it operates a park that is public in nature and attempts to enforce\n\nracial restrictions. Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296, 302 (1966) (“[T]he public\n\ncharacter of this park requires that it be treated as a public institution subject to\n\nthe command of the Fourteenth Amendment, regardless of who now has title\n\nunder state law.”). Evans has since been limited to the unique facts involved.\n\nFlagg Bros. Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U.S. 149, 159 n.8 (1978) (noting that Evans\n\ninvolved “extraordinary circumstances” and distinguishing that case because there\n\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\fwas “actual involvement of the city in the daily maintenance and care of the\n\npark”). At one point, the Court expanded the public function doctrine to\n\nencompass the activities of a private shopping center. Amalgamated Food\n\nEmployees Union Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc., 391 U.S. 308 (1968).\n\nHowever, the Court later overruled this expansion. Hudgens, 424 U.S. at 507\n\n(“[W]e make clear now, if it was not clear before, that the rationale of Logan\n\nValley did not survive the Court’s decision in [Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U.S.\n\n551 (1972)].”).\n\n      Accordingly, the public function doctrine has essentially been limited to the\n\nfacts of Marsh and Evans, which differ greatly from the facts of the instant case.\n\nWhile Marsh involved a privately owned town with all the normal attributes of a\n\ntypical municipality, such as stores, churches, utilities, sidewalks, and streets, the\n\nPlaza is an open space clearly delineated from the surrounding streets and\n\nsidewalks. Similarly, Evans involved a city’s attempt to enforce racially\n\nrestrictive covenants governing a privately owned park that the city maintained.\n\nThe Plaza at issue here is maintained solely by the LDS Church; it is not operated\n\nor maintained by the City. Moreover, following Marsh and Evans, Plaintiffs can\n\npoint to no case in which a court has found that a private entity’s control is so\n\npervasive that it is performing a public function. Marsh and Evans are factually\n\ninapposite; the speech restrictions by the LDS Church do not constitute state\n\n\n                                         - 11 -\n\faction under the public function doctrine.\n\n      Alternatively, Plaintiffs argue that even if the Church is not a state actor,\n\nthe Plaza, by its nature, is still a public forum. Certainly, property does not\n\nbecome a public forum simply because a private owner generally opens his\n\nproperty to the public. Hudgens, 424 U.S. at 519-21; Lloyd Corp., 407 U.S. at\n\n569. On appeal, Plaintiffs argue that notwithstanding its private ownership, the\n\nPlaza is a public forum.\n\n      First, Plaintiffs seem to argue that a public forum may never be sold to a\n\nprivate entity, or that if it is sold, it remains a public forum. This argument is\n\nforeclosed by our precedent. The fact that the Plaza “used to be a public street\n\ndoes not render it a traditional public forum.” Hawkins v. City & County of\n\nDenver, 170 F.3d 1281, 1287-88 (10th Cir. 1999) (determining that a former\n\npublic street that was converted into an open-air, glass covered pedestrian\n\nwalkway that led to a performing arts center is not a public forum). Moreover,\n\nthe government “always retains authority to close a public forum[] by selling the\n\nproperty.” Int’l Soc’y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 699-\n\n700 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring); see also First Unitarian Church, 308 F.3d at\n\n1132 (stating that City may relinquish easement so property becomes entirely\n\nprivate). Plaintiffs’ argument to the contrary is without merit.\n\n      Next, Plaintiffs claim that for a street or sidewalk to be changed from a\n\n\n                                         - 12 -\n\fpresumptively public forum to private property, the physical characteristics must\n\nalso change. See, e.g., Lee, 505 U.S. at 700 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (explaining\n\nthat to change a property’s public forum status, the state “must alter the objective\n\nphysical character or uses of the property”); Venetian Casino Resort L.L.C. v.\n\nLocal Joint Exec. Bd. of Las Vegas, 257 F.3d 937, 944 (9th Cir. 2001) (finding no\n\nalteration because the sidewalk still performed the same role as it did previously).\n\n      However, Plaintiffs’ reliance on Justice Kennedy’s concurrence in Lee and\n\nthe Ninth Circuit’s opinion in Venetian is not persuasive in this case. The test for\n\na public forum proposed by Justice Kennedy asks if “the objective, physical\n\ncharacteristics of the property at issue and the actual public access and uses that\n\nhave been permitted by the government indicate that expressive activity would be\n\nappropriate and compatible with those uses, [then] the property is a public\n\nforum.” Lee, 505 U.S. at 698 (Kennedy, J., concurring). In this case, because of\n\nthe signs posted at all entrances to the Plaza and its differentiation from the\n\nsurrounding sidewalks, the objective, physical characteristics demonstrate that the\n\nPlaza is privately owned. Further, although the easement required the government\n\nto allow expressive activity, the Plaza is no longer owned or controlled by the\n\ngovernment. Id. at 698.\n\n      Plaintiffs urge us to look at the history, function, and purpose of the Plaza\n\nand conclude that the Plaza is a public forum in accordance with the principles\n\n\n                                         - 13 -\n\femployed in First Unitarian Church. We did not go so far in First Unitarian\n\nChurch. There, we concluded that the easement, not the surrounding Plaza\n\nproperty, was a public forum and our holding was so limited. First Unitarian\n\nChurch, 308 F.3d at 1131. Any doubt about the limitation of our holding is belied\n\nby our extensive prior discussion concluding that an easement allowing the\n\ngovernment rights to the property subjects it to forum analysis. Id. at 1121-24.\n\nAbsent the easement, we have no reason to doubt that “[p]roviding for a religious\n\npark” is now the purpose of the entire property held in private ownership. Id. at\n\n1128 n.10. The City simply does not own the Plaza, having sold it in the first\n\ninstance for over $8 million. It relinquished its legally significant remaining\n\nownership interest, namely the easement, for consideration valued at $5.375\n\nmillion.\n\n       Third, Plaintiffs argue that the City’s retained right of reentry, requiring\n\nthat the Plaza be maintained as a landscaped space, is sufficient to render the\n\nPlaza a public forum. Clearly, “[e]ither government ownership or regulation is\n\nsufficient for a First Amendment forum of some kind to exist.” Id. at 1122.\n\nHowever, unlike the case with an easement, our precedent dictates that a similar\n\nfuture interest, the possibility of reverter, is not a present estate. Woodville,\n\nOkla. v. United States, 152 F.2d 735, 738 (10th Cir. 1946) (“[A] possibility or\n\nright of reverter . . . does not constitute an actual estate . . . All the estate rests in\n\n\n                                            - 14 -\n\fthe first grantee, notwithstanding the qualifications annexed to it.”) (internal\n\nquotations and citations omitted); Mount Olivet Cemetery Ass’n v. Salt Lake City,\n\n164 F.3d 480, 485 (10th Cir. 1998) (possibility of reverter owned by the United\n\nStates was “minimal and speculative” and insufficient to constitute property\n\nowned by the United States for purposes of preempting state authority).\n\nMoreover, because such future interests are not entitled to compensation under\n\nthe Fifth Amendment, Woodville, Okla., 152 F.2d at 738; see also Restatement\n\n(First) of Property § 53, the right of reentry is not a constitutionally cognizable\n\nproperty interest. See First Unitarian Church, 308 F.3d at 1122-23. Thus, the\n\nCity’s right of reentry is insufficient to render the Plaza a public forum.\n\n      Plaintiffs also argue that the right of reverter is a property interest\n\nsubstantial enough to support their claims, citing Hampton v. City of Jacksonville,\n\n304 F.2d 320 (5th Cir. 1962), United States v. Mississippi, 499 F.2d 425, 430-32\n\n(5th Cir. 1974), and Eaton v. Grubbs, 329 F.2d 710 (4th Cir. 1964). In each of\n\nthese cases, courts found state action where the government owned a reversionary\n\ninterest in a segregated, privately operated golf course, school or hospital. We\n\nthink that those cases are readily distinguishable. In Hampton and Eaton, the\n\ngovernmental entity was inextricably intertwined with the ongoing operations of\n\nthe private entity, and the property served the same primary function as before. In\n\nUnited States v. Mississippi, the local governmental entity leased an unused\n\n\n                                         - 15 -\n\fschool facility to a civic association which in turn leased it to a private segregated\n\nschool. The court determined that the arrangement resulted in the establishment\n\nand continuation of a segregated school using state resources, in obvious\n\ncontravention of a directive to the local governmental entity to desegregate.\n\nUnited States v. Mississippi, 499 F.2d at 432.\n\n      As noted, the property in this case serves a very different primary function\n\nthan when under City ownership, and the right of reverter does not require that\n\nthe Plaza be used only for a particular purpose, grant the public a right of access,\n\ngive the City the right to control expressive activities on the Plaza, or prohibit the\n\nLDS Church from erecting fences or closing the Plaza altogether. The right of\n\nreverter merely acts to preserve the property as a landscaped space, maintain the\n\nview corridor, and allow for public utility easements. To the extent that these\n\nsubsidiary functions are encouraged, the City is not inextricably intertwined with\n\nthe ongoing operations of the LDS Church or the Plaza.\n\n      Finally, Plaintiffs argue that cases from our sister circuits, which have\n\nfound sidewalks to be public fora because they so closely resembled ordinary\n\npublic sidewalks, dictate that we find the Plaza to be a public forum. We\n\ndisagree. In Venetian, the Ninth Circuit was faced with the issue of “whether a\n\nsidewalk constructed on private property to replace a public sidewalk,\n\naccommodating pedestrian traffic adjacent to Las Vegas Boulevard, is a public\n\n\n                                         - 16 -\n\fforum subject to the protection of the First Amendment.” 257 F.3d at 939. In\n\nthat case, the court noted that the function of the sidewalk in question was the\n\nsame as those on either side of the property, the purpose was the same as any\n\nother sidewalk, there was a recorded servitude on the property requiring the\n\nVenetian to dedicate it to public use, and the sidewalk was indistinguishable from\n\nadjoining sidewalks. Id. at 942-45.\n\n      Our consideration of these factors militates a decision in favor of\n\nDefendants. First, the function of the Plaza, at least when the Church chooses to\n\nleave it open to the public and pedestrians use it as a shortcut to other downtown\n\ndestinations, is similar to that of any other sidewalk or designated pedestrian\n\nthoroughfare. Thus, although the Plaza might at other times have different\n\nfunctions, if left open to and used by the public, it “still performs the same role as\n\na thoroughfare for pedestrian traffic.” Venetian, 257 F.3d at 944. However, the\n\nsimilarities between Venetian and the instant case begin and end there.\n\n      The asserted purpose of the Plaza, unlike that of a normal sidewalk or other\n\npublic forum, is to act as an ecclesiastical park. Next, unlike the sidewalk in\n\nVenetian, there is no recorded servitude requiring that the Church allow public\n\naccess. Rather, the deed conveying the servitude, as referenced in Plaintiffs’\n\ncomplaint and relied upon by the district court, specifically states that the Church\n\nis in no way required to allow public access to the Plaza. Utah Gospel Mission,\n\n\n                                         - 17 -\n\f316 F. Supp. 2d at 1216-17; see also Venetian, 257 F.3d at 948 (“While the mall\n\nowners in Lloyd and Hudgens were free to barricade their walkways, or close\n\ntheir malls outright, without giving patrons any legal ground to complain, the\n\nVenetian is not.”). Finally, the Plaza absent an easement is not “seamlessly\n\nconnected to public sidewalks.” Venetian, 257 F.3d at 943; see also United States\n\nv. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 180 (1983) (“There is no separation, no fence, and no\n\nindication whatever to persons stepping from the street to the curb and sidewalk[]\n\n. . . that they have entered some special type of enclave.”). Instead, the Plaza is\n\nlandscaped, the walking surface is different from that of the City sidewalks, and\n\nwaterfalls, planters, and stone signs announce to entrants that the Plaza is the\n\nproperty of the LDS Church. Utah Gospel Mission, 316 F. Supp. 2d at 1207-08.\n\nAlthough the function of the Plaza is the same as any public thoroughfare, every\n\nother factor considered by the Venetian court requires a result in favor of\n\nDefendants.\n\n      Plaintiffs also argue that United Church of Christ v. Gateway Economic\n\nDevelopment Corp., 383 F.3d 449 (6th Cir. 2004), is controlling. In that case, the\n\nSixth Circuit considered whether the common areas and sidewalks surrounding\n\nGateway Park in Cleveland are public fora in spite of the fact that the stadium is\n\nprivately owned. The court noted that the sidewalk encircling the complex “looks\n\nand feels like a typical public sidewalk” and “blends into the urban grid.” Id. at\n\n\n                                         - 18 -\n\f452. Second, the court found that the sidewalk was a “public thoroughfare,”\n\nwhich “contributes to the City’s downtown transportation grid and is open to the\n\npublic for general pedestrian passage.” Id. On these facts, the court found that\n\nthe sidewalks surrounding the stadium were public fora.\n\n      United Church of Christ also weighs in favor of Defendants. First, the\n\nPlaza does not look like a typical public sidewalk, since it is composed of a\n\ndifferent material and is clearly marked as private property owned by the LDS\n\nChurch. Second, although the Plaza contributes to the downtown transportation\n\ngrid by facilitating pedestrian passage, the easement deed and sale agreement\n\nspecifically stated that the Plaza need not be held open to the general public and\n\nthe LDS Church could restrict entry. Thus, both of the factors considered by the\n\nSixth Circuit weigh against finding that the Plaza is a public forum. Because\n\nPlaintiffs have failed to show either that the Church is a state actor or that the\n\nPlaza constitutes a public forum under the First Amendment, the district court\n\nproperly dismissed Plaintiffs’ claims.\n\n      B. Failure to State an Establishment Clause Claim\n\n      The traditional standard used for analysis of Establishment Clause claims\n\nwas developed in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612-13 (1971). Under\n\nLemon, “the [given municipal action] must have a secular legislative purpose;\n\nsecond, [the action’s] principal or primary effect must be one that neither\n\n\n                                         - 19 -\n\fadvances nor inhibits religion; [and,] finally, the [action] must not foster an\n\nexcessive government entanglement with religion.” Id. (internal quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted). No consideration of the second or third criterion is\n\nnecessary if a statute does not have a clearly secular purpose. Wallace v. Jaffree,\n\n472 U.S. 38, 56 (1985). Thus, to succeed, Plaintiffs must allege facts which\n\nsuggest a violation of any part of the analysis. Bauchman v. W. High Sch., 132\n\nF.3d 542, 552-53 (10th Cir. 1997). Although this analysis has come under\n\nvigorous attack by Justices and commentators alike, see id. at 551 (listing cases\n\nand articles), “Lemon ‘has not been overruled’ and thus remains the starting point\n\nfor our Establishment Clause analysis.” Summum, 297 F.3d at 1009 (citation\n\nomitted); see also Lamb’s Chapel v. Ctr. Moriches Union Free Sch. Dist., 508\n\nU.S. 384, 395 n.7 (1993) (reiterating that Lemon has not been overruled).\n\n      1. Secular Purpose\n\n      The First Amendment requires that a governmental action be invalidated “if\n\nit is entirely motivated by a purpose to advance religion.” Wallace, 472 U.S. at\n\n56. In making this determination, it is appropriate to ask “whether the\n\ngovernment’s actual purpose is to endorse or disapprove of religion.” Lynch v.\n\nDonnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 690 (1984). “The Court has invalidated legislation or\n\ngovernmental action on the ground that a secular purpose was lacking, but only\n\nwhen it has concluded there was no question that the statute or activity was\n\n\n                                         - 20 -\n\fmotivated wholly by religious considerations.” Id. at 680.\n\n      When the government professes a secular purpose for an arguably religious\n\npolicy, the government’s characterization is entitled to some deference. Santa Fe\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist. v. Doe, 530 U.S. 290, 308 (2000). It remains our duty, though,\n\nto “‘distinguis[h] a sham secular purpose from a sincere one.’” Id. (quoting\n\nWallace, 472 U.S. at 75 (O’Connor, J., concurring)). However, we are\n\n“reluctan[t] to attribute unconstitutional motives to the states, particularly when a\n\nplausible secular purpose for the state’s program may be discerned from the face\n\nof the statute.” Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 394-95 (1983); see also Bowen v.\n\nKendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 602 (1998) (legitimate secular purpose behind a program\n\ncreated to eliminate or reduce social and economic problems caused by teenage\n\npregnancy and parenthood); Lynch, 465 U.S. at 680-81 (legitimate secular\n\npurpose behind the annual display of a nativity scene in place to celebrate the\n\nsecular aspects of Christmas); McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 444-45\n\n(1961) (legitimate secular purpose behind Sunday Blue Laws in place to improve\n\npublic health, morals, and safety).\n\n      Secular purposes exist for the sale of the easement. First, the City was well\n\ncompensated, receiving $5 million in exchange for an easement valued at\n\n$500,000. Second, the City was able to extricate itself from perceived\n\nentanglement with the Church and thereby reduce public outcry by eliminating\n\n\n                                         - 21 -\n\fjoint ownership of the Plaza. Similarly, the City could reasonably conclude that if\n\nit were left with the responsibility of regulating protected expressive activities on\n\nthe Plaza, this responsibility would likely result in litigation. Utah Gospel\n\nMission, 316 F. Supp. 2d at 1215-16 (reiterating City’s reasons for selling the\n\neasement). Finally, in First Unitarian Church, this court specifically stated that\n\n“[i]f it wants an easement, the City must permit speech on the easement.\n\nOtherwise, it must relinquish the easement so the parcel becomes entirely\n\nprivate.” 308 F.3d at 1132. The City and Church could conclude that by\n\nchoosing one of the options presented, each could avoid further litigation\n\ninvolving potential constitutional violations.\n\n      Thus, Defendants have advanced numerous plausible legitimate secular\n\npurposes for the sale, which are entitled to some degree of deference. Bauchman,\n\n132 F.3d at 554. Moreover, the fact that some religious purpose may be\n\nadvanced by the sale does not constitute an establishment of religion given the\n\nsecular purposes advanced here. In spite of the purported religious purposes\n\nbehind the transaction, we agree with the district court that there are “obvious and\n\nnumerous” secular purposes, including resolving the legal dispute over the\n\neasement, eliminating the City’s responsibility to regulate activities on the Plaza,\n\nenabling the construction of a new community center, and promoting tourism and\n\neconomic development. Utah Gospel Mission, 316 F. Supp. 2d at 1238.\n\n\n                                         - 22 -\n\fAccordingly, the sale of the easement does not violate the purpose prong of the\n\nLemon test.\n\n      2. Primary Effect\n\n      The second part of the Lemon test asks whether the principal or primary\n\neffect of the given governmental action either endorses or inhibits religion.\n\nLemon, 403 U.S. at 612 (citation omitted). “Endorsement” in this context is akin\n\nto “promotion.” County of Allegheny v. ACLU, 492 U.S. 573, 593 (1989).\n\nSymbolic benefit to religion is enough; it “need not be material and tangible\n\nadvancement.” Friedman v. Bd. of County Comm’rs of Bernalillo County, 781\n\nF.2d 777, 781 (10th Cir. 1985).\n\n      Of particular importance within the effect prong is “whether the challenged\n\npolicy ensures government ‘neutrality towards religion.’” Summum, 297 F.3d at\n\n1010 (quoting Good News Club v. Milford Cent. Sch., 533 U.S. 98, 114 (2001)).\n\nIn essence, the court “must consider not only whether the government is actually\n\nacting neutrally but also whether a reasonable observer, reasonably informed as to\n\nthe relevant circumstances, would perceive the government to be acting\n\nneutrally.” Id.; see also Bd. of Educ. v. Grumet, 512 U.S. 687, 696 (1994). Thus,\n\na governmental action is not “unconstitutional simply because it allows churches\n\nto advance religion, which is their very purpose. For a law to have forbidden\n\n‘effects’ under Lemon, it must be fair to say that the government itself has\n\n\n                                        - 23 -\n\fadvanced religion through its own activities and influence.” Corp. of the\n\nPresiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Amos, 483\n\nU.S. 327, 337 (1987) (emphasis in original).\n\n      Accordingly, the Court held that an “equal access” policy would not violate\n\nthe Establishment Clause. See Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13; see also Bd. of Educ.\n\nv. Allen, 392 U.S. 236 (1968) (upholding expenditure of public money for\n\ntextbooks supplied to church-sponsored schools); Everson v. Bd. of Educ., 330\n\nU.S. 1 (1947) (upholding expenditure of public funds for transportation of\n\nstudents to church-sponsored schools); Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672 (1971)\n\n(upholding federal grants for college buildings to church-sponsored institutions of\n\nhigher learning); Roemer v. Bd. of Pub. Works, 426 U.S. 736 (1976) (upholding\n\nnoncategorical grants to church-sponsored colleges and universities).\n\n      At the opposite end of the spectrum, the Court has found that a\n\ngovernmental subsidy directed at religious institutions and not required by the\n\nFree Exercise Clause conveys a message of endorsement. Tex. Monthly, Inc. v.\n\nBullock, 489 U.S. 1 (1989); see also Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist., 530 U.S. at 305-\n\n06 (finding that although the school characterized the prayer program as “hands\n\noff,” “the realities of the situation plainly reveal that its policy involves both\n\nperceived and actual endorsement of religion”); Foremaster v. City of St. George,\n\n882 F.2d 1485, 1489 (10th Cir. 1989) (holding that an electric subsidy given by\n\n\n                                          - 24 -\n\fthe City impermissibly advanced the LDS Church).\n\n      Looked at objectively, the instant case is one of neutrality and equal access,\n\nin which the City does nothing to advance religion, but merely enables the LDS\n\nChurch to advance itself. Although Plaintiffs contend that this is a case of\n\nimplicit endorsement or promotion of the Church’s message, when viewed\n\nobjectively as a transfer of property from the government to a private entity,\n\nwhich happens to be a church, the sale of the easement cannot be held to violate\n\nthe effect prong of Lemon. In essence, because neutrality toward religion by the\n\nstate is the key, the City must transact indiscriminately with both religious and\n\nnon-religious buyers.\n\n      3. Excessive Entanglement\n\n      Lemon’s final prong provides that a challenged governmental action “must\n\nnot foster ‘an excessive government entanglement with religion.’” Lemon, 403\n\nU.S. at 613 (citation omitted). Total separation between church and state is not\n\npossible in an absolute sense. “Fire inspections, building and zoning regulations,\n\nand state requirements under compulsory school-attendance laws are examples of\n\nnecessary and permissible contacts.” Id. at 614. “In order to determine whether\n\nthe government entanglement with religion is excessive, we must examine the\n\ncharacter and purposes of the institutions that are benefited, the nature of the aid\n\nthat the State provides, and the resulting relationship between the government and\n\n\n                                         - 25 -\n\fthe religious authority.” Id. at 615.\n\n      First, while First Unitarian Church held that the easement is a public forum,\n\nby no means did we state that the City could never sell the easement. Instead, we\n\nstated that because the easement is a public forum, the city must either permit\n\nspeech on it, or “relinquish the easement so the parcel becomes entirely private.”\n\nFirst Unitarian Church, 308 F.3d at 1132. Second, one of the secular purposes for\n\nthe transaction is that the City wanted to rid itself of the responsibility of\n\nregulating activities on the Plaza and the attendant public outcry. Utah Gospel\n\nMission, 316 F. Supp. 2d at 1215. Thus, this transaction shows an attempt by the\n\nCity to extricate itself from the task of regulating the Plaza. Therefore, because\n\nthe Church and City are ending this part of their relationship, there is no\n\nexcessive entanglement of church and state.\n\n      C. Sale of Easement Not a Sham Transaction\n\n      Within their Free Speech and Establishment Clause arguments, Plaintiffs\n\nclaim that the reasons stated by the City for selling the easement are a pretext for\n\nviewpoint discrimination by the Church. Thus, the compensation exchanged for\n\nthe easement was a facade, and the sale of the easement was a sham transaction\n\nentered into by the City only to allow the Church to more effectively convey its\n\nmessage. In so arguing, Plaintiffs claim that the motives of the City and the LDS\n\nChurch are transparent, and the determination of motive is a factual issue not\n\n\n                                          - 26 -\n\fappropriate for disposition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n\n      The numerous cases cited by Plaintiffs, in which the government had some\n\nsort of continuing interest in the property, are distinguishable from the situation at\n\nbar, where the government has relinquished the property. Plaintiffs argue that\n\nbecause they have alleged that the City was motivated by a desire to protect the\n\nChurch’s interest in controlling the property, the existence of other valid\n\nconsiderations leading to the government’s decision is irrelevant. Cornelius v.\n\nNAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788 (1985). However,\n\nCornelius, as well as the other cases cited by Plaintiffs for this proposition, see\n\nAplt. Br. at 34-35, all concern situations in which the government continues to\n\npossess a significant property interest. As for religious discrimination, Plaintiffs\n\nrely upon statements that implicate policy choices in a democracy. We, like the\n\ndistrict court, decline to enter that morass. The fact that the mayor changed his\n\nmind by first vocally opposing the sale of the easement and later supporting it or\n\nthat this issue was controversial simply does not support the claim that the\n\ntransaction was a sham.\n\n      This case contains no well-pleaded factual assertions that suggest a sham.\n\nHaving spent over $8 million to acquire the Plaza, it is not surprising that the\n\nChurch, like any other property owner, would take steps to preserve its quiet\n\nenjoyment. Nothing indicates that the exchange allowed the City to exercise\n\n\n                                         - 27 -\n\fsignificant control over the property, that there was a grossly disproportionate\n\nexchange of value from the City’s perspective, that no consideration was\n\nreceived, or that the City continued to maintain the property. Although Plaintiffs\n\nargue that the City and the Church made a secret oral agreement that the Church\n\nwould continue to allow public access to the Plaza, that is completely belied by\n\nthe settlement agreement, which contains an integration clause, and the special\n\nwarranty deed, which recites the parties’ unequivocal intent to terminate the right\n\nof public access. Aplt. App. 397, 404. It is simply not enough to allege in\n\nconclusory fashion that the transaction was a product of undue influence,\n\ndemonstrating a desire to circumvent this court’s decision in First Unitarian\n\nChurch, a most curious allegation since the panel provided the roadmap for\n\nprivate ownership. There are clearly reasonable grounds for the sale of the\n\neasement since, among other benefits, the City received over $5 million in\n\ncompensation for an easement appraised at $500,000. Though Plaintiffs\n\nundoubtedly were opposed to the transaction, the democratic process reached a\n\ndifferent conclusion. Plaintiffs’ unsupported allegations of pretext are\n\ninsufficient for us to ignore the numerous legitimate reasons for the transaction.\n\n      D. Denial of Preliminary Injunction Not Abuse of Discretion\n\n      We review a district court’s denial of a preliminary injunction for an abuse\n\nof discretion. ACLU v. Johnson, 194 F.3d 1149, 1155 (10th Cir. 1999). An\n\n\n                                        - 28 -\n\fabuse of discretion occurs “only when the trial court bases its decision on an\n\nerroneous conclusion of law or where there is no rational basis in the evidence for\n\nthe ruling.” Hawkins, 170 F.3d at 1292.\n\n      To obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party must establish: “(1)\n\nsubstantial likelihood that the movant will eventually prevail on the merits; (2) a\n\nshowing that the movant will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction issues;\n\n(3) proof that the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the\n\nproposed injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) a showing that the\n\ninjunction, if issued, would not be adverse to the public interest.” SCFC ILC,\n\nInc. v. Visa USA, Inc., 936 F.2d 1096, 1098 (10th Cir. 1991) (citation and\n\ninternal quotations omitted). Having determined that the district court properly\n\ndismissed Plaintiffs’ claim for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be\n\ngranted, see Parts A and B supra, we agree with the district court that Plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on the merits. For that\n\nreason, Plaintiffs have failed to meet the first part of the test for preliminary\n\ninjunction, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying their\n\nprayer for injunctive relief.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 29 -\n\f",

The City allowed public\n\nexpression on Main Street before it was sold. Main Street was sold to enable the\n\nChurch to build a Plaza, which the City hoped would promote downtown\n\npedestrian traffic and stimulate business. The Plaza’s objective attributes and\n\nprimary purpose are different from the former Main Street. For example, the\n\nwalking surface differs from that of an ordinary sidewalk or street, the entrances\n\nare marked by large planters, waterfalls, and stone signs, and the Plaza’s stated\n\n                                        -4-\n\fpurpose is to act as an ecclesiastical park.

The City’s deed reserved\n\nan easement for public access and passage, but provided that the LDS Church\n\ncould prohibit expressive conduct on the property. The property was valued at\n\n$8.124 million without reduction for the value of the easement, and the Church\n\npaid the entire amount with the easement. Id. at 1238 n.44. The Church\n\nprohibited soliciting, begging, demonstrations, protests, leafleting, and other\n\nactivities perceived as disruptive. After the Plaza was built, a group of plaintiffs\n\nsued, claiming that the City’s access and passage easement constituted a public\n\nforum. We agreed, holding that the easement was a public forum upon which\n\ncontent-based restrictions on speech could not be enforced. First Unitarian\n\nChurch of Salt Lake City v.

The\n\nsettlement agreement and amended deed specifically stated: “No Right of Public\n\nAccess – It is the intent of the Parties to eliminate any right of public access or\n\npassage enforceable by the City or by members of the public in relation to the\n\nMain Street Plaza Property.” Utah Gospel Mission, 316 F.

Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary\n\ninjunction to prevent the Church from restricting free speech activities on the\n\nPlaza on November 7, 2003. The Church then moved to dismiss the complaint.\n\nOn May 3, 2004, the district court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary\n\ninjunction and granted the Church’s motion to dismiss, holding that (1) the Plaza\n\nis now entirely privately owned and “thus beyond the reach of the First\n\nAmendment,” (2) the secular purposes supporting the easement were “both\n\nobvious and numerous,” and (3) the sale of the easement, as a matter of law, did\n\nnot advance or endorse religion because the sale was in exchange for adequate\n\nconsideration.

Utah Gospel\n\nMission, 316 F. Supp. 2d at 1205 n.5, 1246 n.52. It declined a motion to strike\n\nother evidentiary material in support of the motion to dismiss after stating that it\n\ndid not rely on such material. Id. at 1246. The court then stated that Plaintiffs\n\ncould not have claimed surprise had it converted the motion to one for summary\n\njudgment without notice. Id. at 1246 n.52. This was because (1) Plaintiffs were\n\nallowed discovery in connection with their request for a preliminary injunction,\n\nand (2) Plaintiffs argued in a supplemental authority letter that the City’s\n\nmotivation to sell the easement was “uniquely factual” and could not be dismissed\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(6) or Rule 56. Id. The court then observed that consideration\n\nof extrinsic evidence “bolsters the court’s conclusion that Plaintiffs’ claims must\n\nbe dismissed because Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that a material disputed\n\nfact existed about any genuine issue.” Id.\n\n      We reject this dicta. It is true that constructive notice or a non-movant’s\n\nreliance upon evidentiary materials in response to a motion to dismiss may\n\nobviate the need for formal notice by the court of conversion. Alexander v.\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fOklahoma, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">382</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1206</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1214 (10th Cir. 2004). But neither exception seems\n\napplicable here, and the non-movant should not have to guess about the court’s\n\nintention. Not having provided such notice, it is at best premature for the district\n\ncourt to express such an opinion. We treat the district court’s disposition as a\n\nruling on a motion to dismiss.\n\n      On appeal, Plaintiffs contend that this case is about motives, arguing that\n\n“the motives of both the City and the LDS Church are totally transparent.” Aplt.\n\nBr. at 36, 41. Plaintiffs claim that at the very least, they are entitled to the benefit\n\nof the allegations in their complaint that the City’s vacating the easement was “a\n\npretext for content and viewpoint discrimination,” id. at 36, and “a sham or\n\nfacade adopted to conceal an improper religious motive.” Id. at 43. They suggest\n\nthat such motivation “is a uniquely factual determination that is inappropriate for\n\ndisposition under [Rule] 12(b)(6).” Id. at 36. While this might be the case, the\n\nPlaintiffs’ position can permissibly be evaluated within the context of the\n\nhundreds of factual allegations contained in their complaint, and the express\n\npurposes of the transaction contained in the settlement agreement, amended deed,\n\nand ordinance. Having reviewed those items, and for reasons discussed below,\n\nwe conclude that the district court was correct in concluding that the complaint\n\nfailed to state a claim.\n\n      A. Failure to State a Free Speech Claim\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f      “It is, of course, a commonplace that the constitutional guarantee of free\n\nspeech is a guarantee only against abridgment by government, federal or state.”\n\nHudgens v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109390\"><a href=\"/opinion/109390/hudgens-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 513 (1976). Thus, to prove a violation of the\n\nFirst Amendment right to free speech, Plaintiffs must either demonstrate that the\n\nChurch, as the sole owner of the Plaza, is a state actor, or that the Plaza is\n\nnevertheless a public forum in spite of its sale to a private owner. The Court first\n\nfound that a private property owner can be a state actor for First Amendment\n\npurposes in Marsh v. Alabama, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104216\"><a href=\"/opinion/104216/marsh-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1946). In that case, the Court\n\nconcluded that the property interests of Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation, the\n\nprivate owner of a company town that did “not function differently from any other\n\ntown,” id. at 508, did not allow the company to regulate speech more strictly than\n\na municipality. Id. at 508-09.\n\n      Applying this theory, the Court found that a private entity performs a public\n\nfunction when it operates a park that is public in nature and attempts to enforce\n\nracial restrictions. Evans v. Newton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107137\"><a href=\"/opinion/107137/evans-v-newton/\"><span class=\"volume\">382</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 302 (1966) (“[T]he public\n\ncharacter of this park requires that it be treated as a public institution subject to\n\nthe command of the Fourteenth Amendment, regardless of who now has title\n\nunder state law.”). Evans has since been limited to the unique facts involved.\n\nFlagg Bros. Inc. v. Brooks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109861\"><a href=\"/opinion/109861/flagg-bros-inc-v-brooks/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 159 n.8 (1978) (noting that Evans\n\ninvolved “extraordinary circumstances” and distinguishing that case because there\n\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\fwas “actual involvement of the city in the daily maintenance and care of the\n\npark”). At one point, the Court expanded the public function doctrine to\n\nencompass the activities of a private shopping center. Amalgamated Food\n\nEmployees Union Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107692\"><a href=\"/opinion/107692/food-employees-v-logan-valley-plaza-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1968).\n\nHowever, the Court later overruled this expansion. Hudgens, 424 U.S. at 507\n\n(“[W]e make clear now, if it was not clear before, that the rationale of Logan\n\nValley did not survive the Court’s decision in [Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108592\"><a href=\"/opinion/108592/lloyd-corp-v-tanner/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972)].”).\n\n      Accordingly, the public function doctrine has essentially been limited to the\n\nfacts of Marsh and Evans, which differ greatly from the facts of the instant case.\n\nWhile Marsh involved a privately owned town with all the normal attributes of a\n\ntypical municipality, such as stores, churches, utilities, sidewalks, and streets, the\n\nPlaza is an open space clearly delineated from the surrounding streets and\n\nsidewalks. Similarly, Evans involved a city’s attempt to enforce racially\n\nrestrictive covenants governing a privately owned park that the city maintained.\n\nThe Plaza at issue here is maintained solely by the LDS Church; it is not operated\n\nor maintained by the City. Moreover, following Marsh and Evans, Plaintiffs can\n\npoint to no case in which a court has found that a private entity’s control is so\n\npervasive that it is performing a public function. Marsh and Evans are factually\n\ninapposite; the speech restrictions by the LDS Church do not constitute state\n\n\n                                         - 11 -\n\faction under the public function doctrine.\n\n      Alternatively, Plaintiffs argue that even if the Church is not a state actor,\n\nthe Plaza, by its nature, is still a public forum. Certainly, property does not\n\nbecome a public forum simply because a private owner generally opens his\n\nproperty to the public. Hudgens, 424 U.S. at 519-21; Lloyd Corp., 407 U.S. at\n\n569. On appeal, Plaintiffs argue that notwithstanding its private ownership, the\n\nPlaza is a public forum.\n\n      First, Plaintiffs seem to argue that a public forum may never be sold to a\n\nprivate entity, or that if it is sold, it remains a public forum. This argument is\n\nforeclosed by our precedent. The fact that the Plaza “used to be a public street\n\ndoes not render it a traditional public forum.” Hawkins v. City & County of\n\nDenver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762529\"><a href=\"/opinion/762529/jack-hawkins-individually-and-as-president-of-the-denver-area-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1281</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1287-88 (10th Cir. 1999) (determining that a former\n\npublic street that was converted into an open-air, glass covered pedestrian\n\nwalkway that led to a performing arts center is not a public forum). Moreover,\n\nthe government “always retains authority to close a public forum[] by selling the\n\nproperty.” Int’l Soc’y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v.

Plaintiffs’ argument to the contrary is without merit.\n\n      Next, Plaintiffs claim that for a street or sidewalk to be changed from a\n\n\n                                         - 12 -\n\fpresumptively public forum to private property, the physical characteristics must\n\nalso change. See, e.g., Lee, 505 U.S. at 700 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (explaining\n\nthat to change a property’s public forum status, the state “must alter the objective\n\nphysical character or uses of the property”); Venetian Casino Resort L.L.C. v.\n\nLocal Joint Exec. Bd. of Las Vegas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774097\"><a href=\"/opinion/774097/venetian-casino-resort-llc-a-delaware-limited-liability-company-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">937</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 944 (9th Cir. 2001) (finding no\n\nalteration because the sidewalk still performed the same role as it did previously).\n\n      However, Plaintiffs’ reliance on Justice Kennedy’s concurrence in Lee and\n\nthe Ninth Circuit’s opinion in Venetian is not persuasive in this case. The test for\n\na public forum proposed by Justice Kennedy asks if “the objective, physical\n\ncharacteristics of the property at issue and the actual public access and uses that\n\nhave been permitted by the government indicate that expressive activity would be\n\nappropriate and compatible with those uses, [then] the property is a public\n\nforum.” Lee, 505 U.S. at 698 (Kennedy, J., concurring). In this case, because of\n\nthe signs posted at all entrances to the Plaza and its differentiation from the\n\nsurrounding sidewalks, the objective, physical characteristics demonstrate that the\n\nPlaza is privately owned. Further, although the easement required the government\n\nto allow expressive activity, the Plaza is no longer owned or controlled by the\n\ngovernment. Id. at 698.\n\n      Plaintiffs urge us to look at the history, function, and purpose of the Plaza\n\nand conclude that the Plaza is a public forum in accordance with the principles\n\n\n                                         - 13 -\n\femployed in First Unitarian Church. We did not go so far in First Unitarian\n\nChurch. There, we concluded that the easement, not the surrounding Plaza\n\nproperty, was a public forum and our holding was so limited. First Unitarian\n\nChurch, 308 F.3d at 1131. Any doubt about the limitation of our holding is belied\n\nby our extensive prior discussion concluding that an easement allowing the\n\ngovernment rights to the property subjects it to forum analysis. Id. at 1121-24.\n\nAbsent the easement, we have no reason to doubt that “[p]roviding for a religious\n\npark” is now the purpose of the entire property held in private ownership. Id. at\n\n1128 n.10. The City simply does not own the Plaza, having sold it in the first\n\ninstance for over $8 million. It relinquished its legally significant remaining\n\nownership interest, namely the easement, for consideration valued at $5.375\n\nmillion.\n\n       Third, Plaintiffs argue that the City’s retained right of reentry, requiring\n\nthat the Plaza be maintained as a landscaped space, is sufficient to render the\n\nPlaza a public forum. Clearly, “[e]ither government ownership or regulation is\n\nsufficient for a First Amendment forum of some kind to exist.” Id. at 1122.\n\nHowever, unlike the case with an easement, our precedent dictates that a similar\n\nfuture interest, the possibility of reverter, is not a present estate.

See First Unitarian Church, 308 F.3d at 1122-23. Thus, the\n\nCity’s right of reentry is insufficient to render the Plaza a public forum.\n\n      Plaintiffs also argue that the right of reverter is a property interest\n\nsubstantial enough to support their claims, citing Hampton v. City of Jacksonville,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"257487\"><a href=\"/opinion/257487/frank-hampton-v-city-of-jacksonville-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1962), United States v.

In each of\n\nthese cases, courts found state action where the government owned a reversionary\n\ninterest in a segregated, privately operated golf course, school or hospital. We\n\nthink that those cases are readily distinguishable. In Hampton and Eaton, the\n\ngovernmental entity was inextricably intertwined with the ongoing operations of\n\nthe private entity, and the property served the same primary function as before. In\n\nUnited States v. Mississippi, the local governmental entity leased an unused\n\n\n                                         - 15 -\n\fschool facility to a civic association which in turn leased it to a private segregated\n\nschool. The court determined that the arrangement resulted in the establishment\n\nand continuation of a segregated school using state resources, in obvious\n\ncontravention of a directive to the local governmental entity to desegregate.\n\nUnited States v. Mississippi, 499 F.2d at 432.\n\n      As noted, the property in this case serves a very different primary function\n\nthan when under City ownership, and the right of reverter does not require that\n\nthe Plaza be used only for a particular purpose, grant the public a right of access,\n\ngive the City the right to control expressive activities on the Plaza, or prohibit the\n\nLDS Church from erecting fences or closing the Plaza altogether. The right of\n\nreverter merely acts to preserve the property as a landscaped space, maintain the\n\nview corridor, and allow for public utility easements. To the extent that these\n\nsubsidiary functions are encouraged, the City is not inextricably intertwined with\n\nthe ongoing operations of the LDS Church or the Plaza.\n\n      Finally, Plaintiffs argue that cases from our sister circuits, which have\n\nfound sidewalks to be public fora because they so closely resembled ordinary\n\npublic sidewalks, dictate that we find the Plaza to be a public forum. We\n\ndisagree. In Venetian, the Ninth Circuit was faced with the issue of “whether a\n\nsidewalk constructed on private property to replace a public sidewalk,\n\naccommodating pedestrian traffic adjacent to Las Vegas Boulevard, is a public\n\n\n                                         - 16 -\n\fforum subject to the protection of the First Amendment.” 257 F.3d at 939. In\n\nthat case, the court noted that the function of the sidewalk in question was the\n\nsame as those on either side of the property, the purpose was the same as any\n\nother sidewalk, there was a recorded servitude on the property requiring the\n\nVenetian to dedicate it to public use, and the sidewalk was indistinguishable from\n\nadjoining sidewalks. Id. at 942-45.\n\n      Our consideration of these factors militates a decision in favor of\n\nDefendants. First, the function of the Plaza, at least when the Church chooses to\n\nleave it open to the public and pedestrians use it as a shortcut to other downtown\n\ndestinations, is similar to that of any other sidewalk or designated pedestrian\n\nthoroughfare. Thus, although the Plaza might at other times have different\n\nfunctions, if left open to and used by the public, it “still performs the same role as\n\na thoroughfare for pedestrian traffic.” Venetian, 257 F.3d at 944. However, the\n\nsimilarities between Venetian and the instant case begin and end there.\n\n      The asserted purpose of the Plaza, unlike that of a normal sidewalk or other\n\npublic forum, is to act as an ecclesiastical park. Next, unlike the sidewalk in\n\nVenetian, there is no recorded servitude requiring that the Church allow public\n\naccess. Rather, the deed conveying the servitude, as referenced in Plaintiffs’\n\ncomplaint and relied upon by the district court, specifically states that the Church\n\nis in no way required to allow public access to the Plaza. Utah Gospel Mission,\n\n\n                                         - 17 -\n\f316 F.

Finally, the Plaza absent an easement is not “seamlessly\n\nconnected to public sidewalks.” Venetian, 257 F.3d at 943; see also United States\n\nv. Grace, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110918\"><a href=\"/opinion/110918/united-states-v-grace/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 180 (1983) (“There is no separation, no fence, and no\n\nindication whatever to persons stepping from the street to the curb and sidewalk[]\n\n. . . that they have entered some special type of enclave.”). Instead, the Plaza is\n\nlandscaped, the walking surface is different from that of the City sidewalks, and\n\nwaterfalls, planters, and stone signs announce to entrants that the Plaza is the\n\nproperty of the LDS Church. Utah Gospel Mission, 316 F. Supp. 2d at 1207-08.\n\nAlthough the function of the Plaza is the same as any public thoroughfare, every\n\nother factor considered by the Venetian court requires a result in favor of\n\nDefendants.\n\n      Plaintiffs also argue that United Church of Christ v. Gateway Economic\n\nDevelopment Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787711\"><a href=\"/opinion/787711/the-united-church-of-christ-ronald-fujiyoshi-gary-quarles-juan-reyna/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2004), is controlling. In that case, the\n\nSixth Circuit considered whether the common areas and sidewalks surrounding\n\nGateway Park in Cleveland are public fora in spite of the fact that the stadium is\n\nprivately owned. The court noted that the sidewalk encircling the complex “looks\n\nand feels like a typical public sidewalk” and “blends into the urban grid.” Id. at\n\n\n                                         - 18 -\n\f452. Second, the court found that the sidewalk was a “public thoroughfare,”\n\nwhich “contributes to the City’s downtown transportation grid and is open to the\n\npublic for general pedestrian passage.” Id. On these facts, the court found that\n\nthe sidewalks surrounding the stadium were public fora.\n\n      United Church of Christ also weighs in favor of Defendants. First, the\n\nPlaza does not look like a typical public sidewalk, since it is composed of a\n\ndifferent material and is clearly marked as private property owned by the LDS\n\nChurch. Second, although the Plaza contributes to the downtown transportation\n\ngrid by facilitating pedestrian passage, the easement deed and sale agreement\n\nspecifically stated that the Plaza need not be held open to the general public and\n\nthe LDS Church could restrict entry. Thus, both of the factors considered by the\n\nSixth Circuit weigh against finding that the Plaza is a public forum. Because\n\nPlaintiffs have failed to show either that the Church is a state actor or that the\n\nPlaza constitutes a public forum under the First Amendment, the district court\n\nproperly dismissed Plaintiffs’ claims.\n\n      B. Failure to State an Establishment Clause Claim\n\n      The traditional standard used for analysis of Establishment Clause claims\n\nwas developed in Lemon v. Kurtzman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108380\"><a href=\"/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 612-13 (1971). Under\n\nLemon, “the [given municipal action] must have a secular legislative purpose;\n\nsecond, [the action’s] principal or primary effect must be one that neither\n\n\n                                         - 19 -\n\fadvances nor inhibits religion; [and,] finally, the [action] must not foster an\n\nexcessive government entanglement with religion.” Id. (internal quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted). No consideration of the second or third criterion is\n\nnecessary if a statute does not have a clearly secular purpose. Wallace v.

Secular Purpose\n\n      The First Amendment requires that a governmental action be invalidated “if\n\nit is entirely motivated by a purpose to advance religion.” Wallace, 472 U.S. at\n\n56. In making this determination, it is appropriate to ask “whether the\n\ngovernment’s actual purpose is to endorse or disapprove of religion.” Lynch v.\n\nDonnelly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111113\"><a href=\"/opinion/111113/lynch-v-donnelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 690 (1984). “The Court has invalidated legislation or\n\ngovernmental action on the ground that a secular purpose was lacking, but only\n\nwhen it has concluded there was no question that the statute or activity was\n\n\n                                         - 20 -\n\fmotivated wholly by religious considerations.” Id. at 680.\n\n      When the government professes a secular purpose for an arguably religious\n\npolicy, the government’s characterization is entitled to some deference.

However, we are\n\n“reluctan[t] to attribute unconstitutional motives to the states, particularly when a\n\nplausible secular purpose for the state’s program may be discerned from the face\n\nof the statute.” Mueller v.

First, the City was well\n\ncompensated, receiving $5 million in exchange for an easement valued at\n\n$500,000. Second, the City was able to extricate itself from perceived\n\nentanglement with the Church and thereby reduce public outcry by eliminating\n\n\n                                         - 21 -\n\fjoint ownership of the Plaza. Similarly, the City could reasonably conclude that if\n\nit were left with the responsibility of regulating protected expressive activities on\n\nthe Plaza, this responsibility would likely result in litigation. Utah Gospel\n\nMission, 316 F. Supp. 2d at 1215-16 (reiterating City’s reasons for selling the\n\neasement). Finally, in First Unitarian Church, this court specifically stated that\n\n“[i]f it wants an easement, the City must permit speech on the easement.\n\nOtherwise, it must relinquish the easement so the parcel becomes entirely\n\nprivate.” 308 F.3d at 1132. The City and Church could conclude that by\n\nchoosing one of the options presented, each could avoid further litigation\n\ninvolving potential constitutional violations.\n\n      Thus, Defendants have advanced numerous plausible legitimate secular\n\npurposes for the sale, which are entitled to some degree of deference. Bauchman,\n\n132 F.3d at 554. Moreover, the fact that some religious purpose may be\n\nadvanced by the sale does not constitute an establishment of religion given the\n\nsecular purposes advanced here. In spite of the purported religious purposes\n\nbehind the transaction, we agree with the district court that there are “obvious and\n\nnumerous” secular purposes, including resolving the legal dispute over the\n\neasement, eliminating the City’s responsibility to regulate activities on the Plaza,\n\nenabling the construction of a new community center, and promoting tourism and\n\neconomic development. Utah Gospel Mission, 316 F.

Primary Effect\n\n      The second part of the Lemon test asks whether the principal or primary\n\neffect of the given governmental action either endorses or inhibits religion.\n\nLemon, 403 U.S. at 612 (citation omitted). “Endorsement” in this context is akin\n\nto “promotion.” County of Allegheny v.

In essence, because neutrality toward religion by the\n\nstate is the key, the City must transact indiscriminately with both religious and\n\nnon-religious buyers.\n\n      3. Excessive Entanglement\n\n      Lemon’s final prong provides that a challenged governmental action “must\n\nnot foster ‘an excessive government entanglement with religion.’” Lemon, 403\n\nU.S. at 613 (citation omitted). Total separation between church and state is not\n\npossible in an absolute sense. “Fire inspections, building and zoning regulations,\n\nand state requirements under compulsory school-attendance laws are examples of\n\nnecessary and permissible contacts.” Id. at 614. “In order to determine whether\n\nthe government entanglement with religion is excessive, we must examine the\n\ncharacter and purposes of the institutions that are benefited, the nature of the aid\n\nthat the State provides, and the resulting relationship between the government and\n\n\n                                         - 25 -\n\fthe religious authority.” Id. at 615.\n\n      First, while First Unitarian Church held that the easement is a public forum,\n\nby no means did we state that the City could never sell the easement. Instead, we\n\nstated that because the easement is a public forum, the city must either permit\n\nspeech on it, or “relinquish the easement so the parcel becomes entirely private.”\n\nFirst Unitarian Church, 308 F.3d at 1132. Second, one of the secular purposes for\n\nthe transaction is that the City wanted to rid itself of the responsibility of\n\nregulating activities on the Plaza and the attendant public outcry. Utah Gospel\n\nMission, 316 F. Supp. 2d at 1215. Thus, this transaction shows an attempt by the\n\nCity to extricate itself from the task of regulating the Plaza. Therefore, because\n\nthe Church and City are ending this part of their relationship, there is no\n\nexcessive entanglement of church and state.\n\n      C. Sale of Easement Not a Sham Transaction\n\n      Within their Free Speech and Establishment Clause arguments, Plaintiffs\n\nclaim that the reasons stated by the City for selling the easement are a pretext for\n\nviewpoint discrimination by the Church. Thus, the compensation exchanged for\n\nthe easement was a facade, and the sale of the easement was a sham transaction\n\nentered into by the City only to allow the Church to more effectively convey its\n\nmessage. In so arguing, Plaintiffs claim that the motives of the City and the LDS\n\nChurch are transparent, and the determination of motive is a factual issue not\n\n\n                                          - 26 -\n\fappropriate for disposition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n\n      The numerous cases cited by Plaintiffs, in which the government had some\n\nsort of continuing interest in the property, are distinguishable from the situation at\n\nbar, where the government has relinquished the property. Plaintiffs argue that\n\nbecause they have alleged that the City was motivated by a desire to protect the\n\nChurch’s interest in controlling the property, the existence of other valid\n\nconsiderations leading to the government’s decision is irrelevant. Cornelius v.\n\nNAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111517\"><a href=\"/opinion/111517/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985). However,\n\nCornelius, as well as the other cases cited by Plaintiffs for this proposition, see\n\nAplt. Br. at 34-35, all concern situations in which the government continues to\n\npossess a significant property interest. As for religious discrimination, Plaintiffs\n\nrely upon statements that implicate policy choices in a democracy. We, like the\n\ndistrict court, decline to enter that morass. The fact that the mayor changed his\n\nmind by first vocally opposing the sale of the easement and later supporting it or\n\nthat this issue was controversial simply does not support the claim that the\n\ntransaction was a sham.\n\n      This case contains no well-pleaded factual assertions that suggest a sham.\n\nHaving spent over $8 million to acquire the Plaza, it is not surprising that the\n\nChurch, like any other property owner, would take steps to preserve its quiet\n\nenjoyment. Nothing indicates that the exchange allowed the City to exercise\n\n\n                                         - 27 -\n\fsignificant control over the property, that there was a grossly disproportionate\n\nexchange of value from the City’s perspective, that no consideration was\n\nreceived, or that the City continued to maintain the property. Although Plaintiffs\n\nargue that the City and the Church made a secret oral agreement that the Church\n\nwould continue to allow public access to the Plaza, that is completely belied by\n\nthe settlement agreement, which contains an integration clause, and the special\n\nwarranty deed, which recites the parties’ unequivocal intent to terminate the right\n\nof public access. Aplt. App. 397, 404. It is simply not enough to allege in\n\nconclusory fashion that the transaction was a product of undue influence,\n\ndemonstrating a desire to circumvent this court’s decision in First Unitarian\n\nChurch, a most curious allegation since the panel provided the roadmap for\n\nprivate ownership. There are clearly reasonable grounds for the sale of the\n\neasement since, among other benefits, the City received over $5 million in\n\ncompensation for an easement appraised at $500,000. Though Plaintiffs\n\nundoubtedly were opposed to the transaction, the democratic process reached a\n\ndifferent conclusion. Plaintiffs’ unsupported allegations of pretext are\n\ninsufficient for us to ignore the numerous legitimate reasons for the transaction.\n\n      D. Denial of Preliminary Injunction Not Abuse of Discretion\n\n      We review a district court’s denial of a preliminary injunction for an abuse\n\nof discretion. ACLU v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158785\"><a href=\"/opinion/158785/aclu-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1155 (10th Cir. 1999). An\n\n\n                                        - 28 -\n\fabuse of discretion occurs “only when the trial court bases its decision on an\n\nerroneous conclusion of law or where there is no rational basis in the evidence for\n\nthe ruling.” Hawkins, 170 F.3d at 1292.\n\n      To obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party must establish: “(1)\n\nsubstantial likelihood that the movant will eventually prevail on the merits; (2) a\n\nshowing that the movant will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction issues;\n\n(3) proof that the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the\n\nproposed injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) a showing that the\n\ninjunction, if issued, would not be adverse to the public interest.” SCFC ILC,\n\nInc. v. Visa USA, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563731\"><a href=\"/opinion/563731/scfc-ilc-inc-dba-mountainwest-financial-inc-v-visa-usa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1096</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1098 (10th Cir. 1991) (citation and\n\ninternal quotations omitted). Having determined that the district court properly\n\ndismissed Plaintiffs’ claim for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be\n\ngranted, see Parts A and B supra, we agree with the district court that Plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on the merits. For that\n\nreason, Plaintiffs have failed to meet the first part of the test for preliminary\n\ninjunction, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying their\n\nprayer for injunctive relief.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 29 -\n\f</pre>",
