By four issues, which can be properly\r\ncategorized as three, the District argues that the trial court erred in denying its plea to the\r\njurisdiction because:  (1) Garcia failed to allege jurisdictional facts vesting subject-matter\r\njurisdiction in the trial court; (2) Garcia's lawsuit was not timely filed under the Texas\r\nCommission on Human Rights Act (\"TCHRA\"), <em>see</em> Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.254 (Vernon\r\n2006); and (3) the District is not an \"employer\" within the context of the TCHRA, and, thus,\r\nthere is no waiver of sovereign immunity.  We affirm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>I. Background</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tInitially, this case involved three terminated school-district employees--Garcia,\r\nMelinda Sotuyo, and Deborah Medina--who filed lawsuits against the District and its\r\nsuperintendent, H.F. \"Jackie\" Dyer, alleging violations of the TCHRA and various common-law claims.<sup> (1)</sup>  <em>See Mission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Garcia</em>, 166 S.W.3d 902, 903 (Tex.\r\nApp.-Corpus Christi 2005), <em>aff'd in part, rev'd in part</em>, 253 S.W.3d 653 (Tex. 2008).  The\r\nDistrict filed a plea to the jurisdiction in each case asserting immunity under section\r\n101.106 of the Texas Tort Claims Act, and the trial court denied the District's pleas.  <em>See</em>\r\nTex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 101.106 (Vernon 2005).  On original submission to this\r\nCourt, we affirmed the trial court's denial of the pleas, concluding that section 101.106 of\r\nthe Texas Tort Claims Act did not apply to the underlying claims.  <em>See Garcia</em>, 166 S.W.3d\r\nat 905.   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn further appeal, the supreme court concluded that:  (1) the Texas Tort Claims\r\nAct's election-of-remedies provision governs all lawsuits filed against a governmental unit;\r\n(2) the employees' common-law claims against the District and the superintendent were\r\nbarred by the Texas Tort Claims Act's election-of-remedies provision; and (3) the Texas\r\nTort Claims Act's election scheme did not bar the employees' recovery under the TCHRA\r\n\"because the Legislature has consented to suits against the government under the TCHRA\r\n. . . and a suit that is based on the TCHRA is not one brought under the [Texas] Tort\r\nClaims Act.\"  <em>Garcia</em>, 253 S.W.3d at 654, 660-61 (stating, in particular, that \"[w]hile this\r\nCourt has not previously addressed the issue, all the courts of appeals that have\r\nconsidered it have concluded that the TCHRA clearly and unambiguously waives immunity,\r\nand we agree. . . .  In this case . . . Garcia's TCHRA claims against the ISD survive\").</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn remand, the District filed another plea to the jurisdiction<sup> (2)</sup> contending that:  (1)\r\nGarcia failed to allege in her original petition jurisdictional facts demonstrating that she had\r\nbeen discriminated or retaliated against by the District; (2) Garcia failed to comply with the\r\nnotice provisions contained in the TCHRA, <em>see</em> Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.254; and (3) the\r\nDistrict is not an \"employer\" within the context of the TCHRA, and, therefore, the trial court\r\nlacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Garcia's claims.  <em>See id. </em>§ 21.002(8) (Vernon Supp.\r\n2009).  After a hearing, the trial court denied the District's plea to the jurisdiction. \r\nThereafter, the District filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The trial\r\ncourt did not issue any fact findings or conclusions; this accelerated interlocutory appeal\r\nensued.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 28.1; <em>see also</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. §§\r\n51.014(a)(8) (Vernon 2008), 101.001(3)(B) (Vernon 2005).   <strong>II. Standard of Review</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tA plea to the jurisdiction is a dilatory plea used to defeat a cause of action without\r\nregard to whether the claims asserted have merit.  <em>Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue</em>, 34\r\nS.W.3d 547, 554 (Tex. 2000).  The plea challenges the trial court's subject-matter\r\njurisdiction.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>see Tex. Dep't of Transp. v. Jones</em>, 8 S.W.3d 636, 638 (Tex. 1999). \r\nWhether a trial court has subject-matter jurisdiction and whether the pleader has alleged\r\nfacts that affirmatively demonstrate the trial court's subject-matter jurisdiction are questions\r\nof law that we review de novo.  <em>Tex. Dep't of Parks &amp; Wildlife v. Miranda</em>, 133 S.W.3d 217,\r\n226 (Tex. 2004); <em>Tex. Natural Res. Conservation Comm'n v. IT-Davy</em>, 74 S.W.3d 849, 855\r\n(Tex. 2002).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe plaintiff has the burden to plead facts affirmatively showing that the trial court\r\nhas jurisdiction.  <em>Tex. Ass'n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd.</em>, 852 S.W.2d 440, 446 (Tex.\r\n1993); <em>Univ. of N. Tex. v. Harvey</em>, 124 S.W.3d 216, 220 (Tex. App.-Fort Worth 2003, pet.\r\ndenied).  We construe the pleadings liberally in favor of the pleader, look to the pleader's\r\nintent, and accept as true the factual allegations in the pleadings.  <em>See Miranda</em>, 133\r\nS.W.3d at 226, 228; <em>City of Fort Worth v. Crockett</em>, 142 S.W.3d 550, 552 (Tex. App.-Fort\r\nWorth 2004, pet. denied).  If a plea to the jurisdiction challenges the existence of\r\njurisdictional facts, we consider relevant evidence submitted by the parties when necessary\r\nto resolve the jurisdictional issues raised, as the trial court is required to do, even those\r\nfacts which may implicate the merits of the cause of action.  <em>Miranda</em>, 133 S.W.3d at 227;\r\n<em>Blue</em>, 34 S.W.3d at 555 (confining evidentiary review to evidence that is relevant to the\r\njurisdictional issue); <em>see</em> <em>City of Waco v. Kirwan</em>, No. 08-0121, 2009 Tex. LEXIS 969, at *6\r\n(Tex. Nov. 20, 2009). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tA trial court's review of a plea to the jurisdiction challenging the existence of\r\njurisdictional facts mirrors that of a traditional motion for summary judgment.  <em>Miranda</em>, 133\r\nS.W.3d at 228; <em>see</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c).  The governmental unit is required to meet the\r\nsummary judgment standard of proof for its assertion that the trial court lacks jurisdiction. \r\n<em>Miranda</em>, 133 S.W.3d at 228.  Once the governmental unit meets its burden, the plaintiff\r\nis then required to show that there is a disputed material fact regarding the jurisdictional\r\nissue.  <em>Id.</em>  If the evidence creates a fact question regarding jurisdiction, the trial court must\r\ndeny the plea to the jurisdiction and leave its resolution to the fact finder.  <em>Id.</em> at 227-28. \r\nBut, if the evidence is undisputed or fails to raise a fact question on the jurisdictional issue,\r\nthe trial court rules on the plea to the jurisdiction as a matter of law.  <em>Id. </em>at 228.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\"In considering this evidence, we 'take as true all evidence favorable to the\r\nnonmovant' and 'indulge every reasonable inference and resolve any doubts in the\r\nnonmovant's favor.'\"  <em>Kirwan</em>, 2009 Tex. LEXIS 969, at *6 <em> </em>(quoting <em>Miranda</em>, 133 S.W.3d\r\nat 228).  Further, a defendant cannot simply deny the existence of jurisdictional facts and\r\nforce the plaintiff to raise a fact issue.<em>  See Johnson v. Brewer &amp; Pritchard, P.C.</em>, 73\r\nS.W.3d 193, 207 (Tex. 2002);<em> see also County of Cameron v. Brown</em>, 80 S.W.3d 549, 555\r\n(Tex. 2002) (\"In deciding a plea to the jurisdiction, a court may not weigh the claims' merits\r\nbut must consider only the plaintiffs' pleadings and evidence pertinent to the jurisdictional\r\ninquiry.\"). \t</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>III. Analysis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A. \tWhether Garcia's Original Petition Contained Sufficient Jurisdictional Facts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its first issue, the District contends that Garcia failed to allege in her original\r\npetition sufficient jurisdictional facts to make out a prima facie case of discrimination or\r\nretaliation.  Garcia counters that the pleadings sufficiently invoke the subject-matter\r\njurisdiction of the trial court.  Garcia further argues that the trial court's denial of the\r\nDistrict's plea to the jurisdiction was proper because the District is attempting to resolve the\r\nunderlying merits of the case, which is an inappropriate use of a plea to the jurisdiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t<strong>1.\tApplicable Law</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe TCHRA prohibits an employer from discharging or in any other way\r\ndiscriminating against an employee because of the employee's race, color, disability,\r\nreligion, sex, national origin, or age.  Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.051 (Vernon 2006). \r\nSpecifically, section 21.051 of the labor code provides the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAn employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race,\r\ncolor, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t(1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\r\ndiscriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with\r\ncompensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\t(2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\r\nemployment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an individual\r\nof any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any other manner the\r\nstatus of an employee.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><em>Id.</em>  The TCHRA also prohibits employers from retaliating or discriminating against an\r\nemployee who:  \"(1) opposes discriminatory practice; (2) makes or files a charge; (3) files\r\na complaint; or (4) testifies, assists, or participates in any manner in an investigation,\r\nproceeding, or hearing.\"  <em>Id.</em> § 21.055 (Vernon 2006).  Because one of the purposes of the\r\nTCHRA is to correlate state law with federal law with respect to employment discrimination,\r\nwe may look to federal law in interpreting provisions of the TCHRA.  <em>See id. </em>§ 21.001\r\n(Vernon 2006);<em> see also M.D. Anderson Hosp. v. Tumor Inst. v. Willrich</em>, 28 S.W.3d 22, 24\r\n(Tex. 2000);<em> NME Hosps., Inc. v. Rennels</em>, 994 S.W.2d 142, 144 (Tex. 1999).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>\t2. \tDiscussion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn her original petition, Garcia noted that she first began working for the District in\r\nOctober 1976, and \"performed all the duties assigned to her with loyalty, dedication[,] and\r\nhard work.\"  However, on or about February 19, 2003, she was \"wrongfully discharged by\r\na management employee of Defendant [the District] for illegal and discriminatory reasons,\r\nincluding, but not limited to, participating in an investigation involving another district\r\nemployee . . . and for exercising her protected right to freedom of association.\"  Garcia\r\nfurther alleged that \"she was discriminated against by the Defendant School District due\r\nto her race and national origin, namely--Hispanic/Mexican-American descent,\r\ngender--female, and due to her age, 48 (d.o.b.--06/15/1954)\" and that \"her termination\r\nwas part of a larger unwritten plan or scheme of the Defendant School District to\r\ndiscriminate against older Hispanic female employees who were politically associated with\r\npersons adverse to the Administration.\"  Garcia also stated that \"there was no legitimate\r\nbusiness justification for her termination\" because she \"had always performed a\r\nsatisfactory job for the Defendant during her employment . . . and that there was work\r\navailable and there continues to be work available which [Garcia] could perform\" and that\r\nshe had fulfilled all statutory prerequisites before filing this action.   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn response to Garcia's original petition, the District filed a plea to the jurisdiction,\r\nwhich the trial court denied.  The District contended that Garcia failed to allege\r\njurisdictional facts demonstrating that she had been discriminated or retaliated against by\r\nthe District.  Specifically, the District argued that the trial court lacked subject-matter\r\njurisdiction over Garcia's discrimination claims because the employee selected to replace\r\nGarcia is of the same gender, national origin, and race and is three years older than\r\nGarcia.  The District further argued that the trial court did not have subject-matter\r\njurisdiction over Garcia's retaliation claim because she \"did not participate in an\r\ninvestigation related to a claim brought pursuant to Chapter 21 [of the labor code].\"  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAt the hearing on the District's plea to the jurisdiction, two affidavits were admitted\r\nas part of the District's evidence.  The first affidavit was executed by Dr. Rebecca Morrison,\r\nthe Director of Human Resources for the District, which averred that:  (1) Dr. Morrison had\r\nreviewed Garcia's employment records; (2) Garcia had served as \"one of two\r\nCommunity/Home School Liaisons for Veterans Memorial High School\"; and (3) the next\r\nperson hired to fill Garcia's position was Zoila Longoria.  The second affidavit, executed\r\nby Longoria, provided the following personal information pertaining to Longoria:  (1) her\r\nbirthday is April 14, 1951; (2) she is Hispanic; (3) she is a female; and (4) her national\r\norigin is Mexican-American.  Beyond its bare assertions at the hearing on the plea to the\r\njurisdiction, the District did not present any evidence addressing Garcia's retaliation claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tWe find that the evidence submitted by the District merely attacks the merits of\r\nGarcia's underlying causes of action and does not defeat subject-matter jurisdiction.  <em>See\r\nMiranda</em>, 133 S.W.3d at 228 (\"We adhere to the fundamental precept that a court must not\r\nproceed on the merits of a case until legitimate challenges to its jurisdiction have been\r\ndecided. . . .  However, by reserving for the fact finder the resolution of disputed\r\njurisdictional facts that implicate the merits of the claim or defense, we preserve the parties'\r\nright to present the merits of their case at trial.\"); <em>see also</em> <em>Brown</em>, 80 S.W.3d at 555. \r\nAccepting as true the factual allegations made by Garcia in her original petition, taking as\r\ntrue all evidence favorable to Garcia, and indulging every reasonable inference and\r\nresolving any doubts in Garcia's favor, we conclude that Garcia has pleaded sufficient facts\r\ndemonstrating that the trial court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this dispute, and\r\ntherefore, we cannot say that the trial court erred in denying the District's plea to the\r\njurisdiction.<sup> (3)</sup>  <em>See Kirwan</em>, 2009 Tex. LEXIS 969, at *6; <em>Miranda</em>, 133 S.W.3d at 226, 228;\r\n<em>see also Crockett</em>, 142 S.W.3d at 552.  Accordingly, we overrule the District's first issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>B. \tWhether Garcia Complied With Section 21.254 of the Labor Code</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tBy its second issue, the District asserts that Garcia failed to comply with the\r\nmandatory and jurisdictional notice requirements contained in the TCHRA.  <em>See</em> Tex. Lab.\r\nCode Ann. § 21.254.  Garcia contends that she filed suit within the sixty-day deadline\r\nimposed by the TCHRA and that she exercised due diligence in serving the District with\r\nnotice of her lawsuit. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe labor code establishes two timelines with which an aggrieved employee must\r\ncomply.  First, an employee must file an administrative complaint within 180 days of any\r\nalleged discriminatory acts.  <em>See id. </em>§ 21.202(a) (Vernon 2006);<em> Rice v. Russell-Stanley,\r\nL.P.</em>, 131 S.W.3d 510, 513 (Tex. App.-Waco 2004, pet. denied);<em> see also Schroeder v.\r\nTex. Iron Works, Inc.</em>, 813 S.W.2d 483, 485-86 (Tex. 1991).  This requirement is\r\n\"mandatory and jurisdictional\"; thus, \"failing to comply deprives the court of subject[-]matter\r\njurisdiction.\"  <em>Schroeder</em>, 813 S.W.2d at 486;<em> Czerwinski v. Univ. of Tex. Health Sci. Ctr.</em>,\r\n116 S.W.3d 119, 121 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, pet. denied); <em>see Vela v.\r\nWaco Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 69 S.W.3d 695, 700 (Tex. App.-Waco 2002, pet. withdrawn). \r\nWhether Garcia complied with this timeline is not in dispute in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tSecond, the employee must file suit within sixty days of receiving a right-to-sue letter\r\nfrom the administrative agency.  <em>See Vela</em>, 69 S.W.3d at 699; <em>see also </em>Tex. Lab. Code\r\nAnn. § 21.254.  The Texas Supreme Court has not addressed whether the sixty-day filing\r\nperiod is jurisdictional.  <em>See Tex. Dep't of Criminal Justice v. Guard</em>, No. 10-06-00065-CV,\r\n2007 Tex. App. LEXIS 2859, at **7-8 (Tex. App.-Waco Apr. 11, 2007, no pet.) (mem. op.). \r\nSeveral of our sister courts, however, have concluded that the sixty-day filing period is not\r\njurisdictional.  <em>See id. </em>at **9-10 (citing <em>Tex. Dep't of Transp. v. Beckner</em>, 74 S.W.3d 98, 103\r\n(Tex. App.-Waco 2002, no pet.); <em>Middleton v. Gould</em>, 952 F. Supp. 435, 438 (S.D. Tex.\r\n1996); <em>Corner v. Gates of Cedar Hill</em>, No. 3-00-CV-2499-N, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16944,\r\nat **6-7 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 9, 2002)); <em>Windle v. Mary Kay, Inc.</em>, No. 05-02-00252-CV, 2003\r\nTex. App. LEXIS 5594, at *4 (Tex. App.-Dallas July 1, 2003, pet. denied) (mem. op.)\r\n(holding that section 21.254 does not establish a jurisdictional bar; instead, it merely affects\r\na plaintiff's right to maintain suit under the TCHRA) (citing <em>Lottinger v. Shell Oil Co.</em>, 143\r\nF. Supp. 2d 743, 753 (S.D. Tex. 2001) (interpreting the TCHRA); <em>Dubai Petroleum Co. v.\r\nKazi</em>, 12 S.W.3d 71, 76-77 (Tex. 2000) (holding that section 71.031 of the civil practice and\r\nremedies code is not a jurisdictional bar but affects a plaintiff's right to maintain a suit)).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tWe agree with our sister courts that section 21.254 does not establish a\r\njurisdictional bar but does affect Garcia's right to maintain a suit under the TCHRA.  <em>See\r\nBeckner</em>, 74 S.W.3d at 103 (holding that the forty-day filing period in a workers'\r\ncompensation case is a limitations period and not a jurisdiction bar and stating that\r\n\"statutory requirements are not 'jurisdictional' merely because they impose a mandatory\r\nrequirement on the plaintiff before judicial relief may be sought\");<em> see also Guard</em>, 2007\r\nTex. App. LEXIS 2859, at **7-9 (holding that \"Chapter 21's 60-day filing period is not\r\njurisdictional\" and \"a filing period is not an act that must be performed <em>prior</em> to filing suit and\r\nso is not a statutory prerequisite\" (emphasis in original)); <em>Windle</em>, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS\r\n5594, at *4.  Because we have concluded that the sixty-day filing period is not jurisdictional,\r\nit cannot serve as the proper basis for a plea to the jurisdiction, and therefore, we cannot\r\naddress it on interlocutory appeal.<sup> (4)</sup>  <em>See Tex. Educ. Agency v. Donna Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>,\r\n221 S.W.3d 791, 796 n.3 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 2007, no pet.)

Lab. Code Ann. § 21.002(8). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn original submission, the Texas Supreme Court held that immunity is waived as\r\nto a school district under chapter 21 of the labor code.  <em>See Garcia</em>, 253 S.W.3d at 660;\r\n<em>see also Copperas Cove Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Brown</em>, No. 10-09-00047-CV, 2009 Tex. App.\r\nLEXIS 9814, at **1-2 (Tex. App.-Waco Dec. 30, 2009, no pet h.) (mem. op.) (rejecting a\r\nschool district's argument that school districts are not \"employers\" as defined by Chapter\r\n21, and therefore, immunity is not waived).  On appeal, the District essentially asks us to\r\nreconsider the supreme court's resolution of this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tWe first note that the \"law of the case\" doctrine requires that \"questions of law\r\ndecided on appeal to a court of last resort will govern the case throughout its subsequent\r\nstages.\"  <em>Hudson v. Wakefield</em>, 711 S.W.2d 628, 630 (Tex. 1986).  Furthermore, this Court\r\nis bound to follow the supreme court's resolution of this issue.<em>  See Lubbock County v.\r\nTrammel's Lubbock Bail Bonds</em>, 80 S.W.3d 580, 585 (Tex. 2002) (\"It is not the function of\r\na court of appeals to abrogate or modify established precedent. . . .  That function lies\r\nsolely with this Court. . . .  Generally, the doctrine of stare decisis dictates that once the\r\nSupreme Court announces a proposition of law, the decision is considered binding\r\nprecedent.\").  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe District argues that <em>Garcia</em> is not the \"law of the case\" because the specific\r\nissue of whether a school district is immune under the TCHRA was never fully briefed or\r\nargued.  It further argues that the supreme court's more recent decision in<em> Harris County\r\nHospital District v. Tomball Regional Hospital </em>calls <em>Garcia</em> into question.  <em>See </em>283 S.W.3d\r\n838 (Tex. 2009).  We are unpersuaded by these arguments.  Notwithstanding the lack of\r\nbriefing or argument, the supreme court considered the waiver issue<sup> (5)</sup> and concluded that\r\nthe \"TCHRA clearly and unambiguously waives immunity.\"  <em>Garcia</em>, 253 S.W.3d at 660. \r\nThus, we must conclude that the definition of \"employer\" in chapter 21 of the labor code\r\nincludes school districts, and therefore, immunity is waived.<sup> (6)</sup>  Accordingly, we overrule the\r\nDistrict's third issue.   </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>IV. Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tHaving overruled all of the District's issues on appeal, we affirm the judgment of the\r\ntrial court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>                                               </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDORI CONTRERAS GARZA,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJustice</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Delivered and filed the</p>\r\n\r\n<p>28th day of January, 2010.\r\n</p><p>1.  Garcia filed her original petition on July 2, 2004, asserting various wrongful termination, defamation,\r\nnegligent misrepresentation, and fraudulent misrepresentation claims.  The record does not contain\r\ninformation regarding the status of Sotuyo's and Medina's lawsuits; however, they are not parties to this\r\nappeal.  Furthermore, Garcia acknowledges on appeal that Dyer was dismissed from the underlying suit. \r\n</p><p>2.  We are compelled to note that the District's jurisdictional complaints raised in the plea to the\r\njurisdiction at bar could have been raised in the initial plea to the jurisdiction filed in 2004.  While there appears\r\nto be no prohibition on such a piecemeal approach, this practice should be discouraged because of the\r\ninevitable delay and additional expense.  <em>See</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 10.001(1) (Vernon 2002)\r\n(providing, among other things, that \"[t]he signing of a pleading or motion . . . constitutes a certificate by the\r\nsignatory that to the signatory's best knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry . .\r\n. the pleading or motion is not being presented for any improper purpose, including to harass or<em> to cause\r\nunnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation </em>. . . \") (emphasis added);<em> see also Columbia\r\nMed. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Inc. v. Hogue</em>, 271 S.W.3d 238, 258 (Tex. 2008) (Brister, J., concurring) (quoting\r\n<em>Iley v. Hughes</em>, 158 Tex. 362, 311 S.W.2d 648, 651 (1958) (\"'Our courts have always frowned upon piecemeal\r\ntrials, deeming the public interest, the interests of litigants[,] and the administration of justice to be better\r\nserved by rules of trial which avoid a multiplicity of suits.'\")); <em>Transp.

Our conclusion is further supported by the supreme court's determination that the District is not\r\nimmune from suit within the context of the TCHRA.  <em>See Mission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Garcia</em>, 253\r\nS.W.3d 653, 660 (Tex. 2008); <em>see also Tex. Dep't of Parks &amp; Wildlife v. Miranda</em>, 133 S.W.3d 217, 224 (Tex.\r\n2004) (holding that immunity from suit deprives a court of subject-matter jurisdiction);<em> Sweeny Cmty. Hosp.\r\nv. Mendez</em>, 226 S.W.3d 584, 589 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.) (same).\r\n</p><p>4.  The District argues that Garcia's alleged failure to notify the District of her suit within the sixty-day\r\nfiling period deprived the trial court of subject-matter jurisdiction, considering section 311.034 of the\r\ngovernment code provides that \"[s]tatutory prerequisites to a suit, including the provision of notice, are\r\njurisdictional requirements in all suits against a governmental entity.\"  <em>See</em> Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 311.034\r\n(Vernon Supp. 2009).  However, the language referenced by the District was not included in the version of\r\nsection 311.034 that was in effect when Garcia filed suit on July 2, 2004.  <em>See</em> Act of June 15, 2001, 77th Leg.,\r\nR.S., ch. 1158, § 8, 2001 Tex. Gen. Laws 2374, 2433 (amended 2005) (current version at Tex. Gov't Code\r\nAnn. § 311.034).  In fact, the predecessor to section 311.034 provided the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tSec. 311.034 WAIVER OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn order to preserve the legislature's interest in managing state fiscal matters through the\r\nappropriations process, a statute shall not be construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity\r\nunless the waiver is effected by clear and unambiguous language.  In a statute, the use of\r\n\"person\" as defined by Section 311.005 to include governmental entities does not indicate\r\nlegislative intent to waive sovereign immunity unless the context of the statute indicates no\r\nother reasonable construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><em>Id.</em>  Because the predecessor to section 311.034 is silent as to statutory prerequisites and jurisdictional\r\nrequirements, we do not consider the District's argument to be persuasive.\r\n</p><p>5.  \"Here, Garcia alleges that the Legislature waived the ISD's immunity in the TCHRA.\"  <em>Garcia</em>, 253\r\nS.W.3d at 660.\r\n</p><p>6.  We also note that the District, in arguing that it is not an \"employer\" within the context of Chapter 21\r\nof the labor code, argues that it is neither a \"political subdivision\" of the State of Texas nor a \"state\r\ninstrumentality.\"  If this were true, then, in reconciling chapter 21 of the labor code with section 51.014 of the\r\ncivil practice and remedies code (the statute authorizing certain interlocutory appeals), the District would not\r\nbe entitled to appeal the trial court's interlocutory order in this case.  <em>Compare</em> Tex. Lab. Code Ann. §\r\n21.002(8) <em>with</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 51.014(a)(8) (providing that a governmental unit as defined\r\nby section 101.001 of the civil practice and remedies code may appeal from an interlocutory order granting\r\nor denying a plea to the jurisdiction); <em>see</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 101.001(3)(B) (defining a\r\n\"[g]overnmental unit\" as \"a political subdivision of this state including any . . . <em>school district </em>. . . \") (emphasis\r\nadded).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",

By four issues, which can be properly\r\ncategorized as three, the District argues that the trial court erred in denying its plea to the\r\njurisdiction because:  (1) Garcia failed to allege jurisdictional facts vesting subject-matter\r\njurisdiction in the trial court; (2) Garcia's lawsuit was not timely filed under the Texas\r\nCommission on Human Rights Act (\"TCHRA\"), <em>see</em> Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.254 (Vernon\r\n2006); and (3) the District is not an \"employer\" within the context of the TCHRA, and, thus,\r\nthere is no waiver of sovereign immunity.  We affirm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>I. Background</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tInitially, this case involved three terminated school-district employees--Garcia,\r\nMelinda Sotuyo, and Deborah Medina--who filed lawsuits against the District and its\r\nsuperintendent, H.F. \"Jackie\" Dyer, alleging violations of the TCHRA and various common-law claims.<sup> (1)</sup>  <em>See Mission Consol.

The\r\nDistrict filed a plea to the jurisdiction in each case asserting immunity under section\r\n101.106 of the Texas Tort Claims Act, and the trial court denied the District's pleas.  <em>See</em>\r\nTex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 101.106 (Vernon 2005).  On original submission to this\r\nCourt, we affirmed the trial court's denial of the pleas, concluding that section 101.106 of\r\nthe Texas Tort Claims Act did not apply to the underlying claims.  <em>See Garcia</em>, 166 S.W.3d\r\nat 905.   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn further appeal, the supreme court concluded that:  (1) the Texas Tort Claims\r\nAct's election-of-remedies provision governs all lawsuits filed against a governmental unit;\r\n(2) the employees' common-law claims against the District and the superintendent were\r\nbarred by the Texas Tort Claims Act's election-of-remedies provision; and (3) the Texas\r\nTort Claims Act's election scheme did not bar the employees' recovery under the TCHRA\r\n\"because the Legislature has consented to suits against the government under the TCHRA\r\n. . . and a suit that is based on the TCHRA is not one brought under the [Texas] Tort\r\nClaims Act.\"  <em>Garcia</em>, 253 S.W.3d at 654, 660-61 (stating, in particular, that \"[w]hile this\r\nCourt has not previously addressed the issue, all the courts of appeals that have\r\nconsidered it have concluded that the TCHRA clearly and unambiguously waives immunity,\r\nand we agree. . . .  In this case . . . Garcia's TCHRA claims against the ISD survive\").</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn remand, the District filed another plea to the jurisdiction<sup> (2)</sup> contending that:  (1)\r\nGarcia failed to allege in her original petition jurisdictional facts demonstrating that she had\r\nbeen discriminated or retaliated against by the District; (2) Garcia failed to comply with the\r\nnotice provisions contained in the TCHRA, <em>see</em> Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.254; and (3) the\r\nDistrict is not an \"employer\" within the context of the TCHRA, and, therefore, the trial court\r\nlacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Garcia's claims.  <em>See id. </em>§ 21.002(8) (Vernon Supp.\r\n2009).  After a hearing, the trial court denied the District's plea to the jurisdiction. \r\nThereafter, the District filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The trial\r\ncourt did not issue any fact findings or conclusions; this accelerated interlocutory appeal\r\nensued.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 28.1; <em>see also</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.

If a plea to the jurisdiction challenges the existence of\r\njurisdictional facts, we consider relevant evidence submitted by the parties when necessary\r\nto resolve the jurisdictional issues raised, as the trial court is required to do, even those\r\nfacts which may implicate the merits of the cause of action.  <em>Miranda</em>, 133 S.W.3d at 227;\r\n<em>Blue</em>, 34 S.W.3d at 555 (confining evidentiary review to evidence that is relevant to the\r\njurisdictional issue); <em>see</em> <em>City of Waco v.

R. Civ. P. 166a(c).  The governmental unit is required to meet the\r\nsummary judgment standard of proof for its assertion that the trial court lacks jurisdiction. \r\n<em>Miranda</em>, 133 S.W.3d at 228.  Once the governmental unit meets its burden, the plaintiff\r\nis then required to show that there is a disputed material fact regarding the jurisdictional\r\nissue.  <em>Id.</em>  If the evidence creates a fact question regarding jurisdiction, the trial court must\r\ndeny the plea to the jurisdiction and leave its resolution to the fact finder.  <em>Id.</em> at 227-28. \r\nBut, if the evidence is undisputed or fails to raise a fact question on the jurisdictional issue,\r\nthe trial court rules on the plea to the jurisdiction as a matter of law.  <em>Id. </em>at 228.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\"In considering this evidence, we 'take as true all evidence favorable to the\r\nnonmovant' and 'indulge every reasonable inference and resolve any doubts in the\r\nnonmovant's favor.'\"  <em>Kirwan</em>, 2009 Tex.

Analysis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A. \tWhether Garcia's Original Petition Contained Sufficient Jurisdictional Facts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its first issue, the District contends that Garcia failed to allege in her original\r\npetition sufficient jurisdictional facts to make out a prima facie case of discrimination or\r\nretaliation.  Garcia counters that the pleadings sufficiently invoke the subject-matter\r\njurisdiction of the trial court.  Garcia further argues that the trial court's denial of the\r\nDistrict's plea to the jurisdiction was proper because the District is attempting to resolve the\r\nunderlying merits of the case, which is an inappropriate use of a plea to the jurisdiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t<strong>1.\tApplicable Law</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe TCHRA prohibits an employer from discharging or in any other way\r\ndiscriminating against an employee because of the employee's race, color, disability,\r\nreligion, sex, national origin, or age.

Code Ann. § 21.051 (Vernon 2006). \r\nSpecifically, section 21.051 of the labor code provides the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAn employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race,\r\ncolor, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t(1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\r\ndiscriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with\r\ncompensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\t(2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\r\nemployment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an individual\r\nof any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any other manner the\r\nstatus of an employee.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><em>Id.</em>  The TCHRA also prohibits employers from retaliating or discriminating against an\r\nemployee who:  \"(1) opposes discriminatory practice; (2) makes or files a charge; (3) files\r\na complaint; or (4) testifies, assists, or participates in any manner in an investigation,\r\nproceeding, or hearing.\"  <em>Id.</em> § 21.055 (Vernon 2006).  Because one of the purposes of the\r\nTCHRA is to correlate state law with federal law with respect to employment discrimination,\r\nwe may look to federal law in interpreting provisions of the TCHRA.  <em>See id. </em>§ 21.001\r\n(Vernon 2006);<em> see also M.D. Anderson Hosp. v.

The District contended that Garcia failed to allege\r\njurisdictional facts demonstrating that she had been discriminated or retaliated against by\r\nthe District.  Specifically, the District argued that the trial court lacked subject-matter\r\njurisdiction over Garcia's discrimination claims because the employee selected to replace\r\nGarcia is of the same gender, national origin, and race and is three years older than\r\nGarcia.  The District further argued that the trial court did not have subject-matter\r\njurisdiction over Garcia's retaliation claim because she \"did not participate in an\r\ninvestigation related to a claim brought pursuant to Chapter 21 [of the labor code].\"  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAt the hearing on the District's plea to the jurisdiction, two affidavits were admitted\r\nas part of the District's evidence.  The first affidavit was executed by Dr. Rebecca Morrison,\r\nthe Director of Human Resources for the District, which averred that:  (1) Dr. Morrison had\r\nreviewed Garcia's employment records; (2) Garcia had served as \"one of two\r\nCommunity/Home School Liaisons for Veterans Memorial High School\"; and (3) the next\r\nperson hired to fill Garcia's position was Zoila Longoria.  The second affidavit, executed\r\nby Longoria, provided the following personal information pertaining to Longoria:  (1) her\r\nbirthday is April 14, 1951; (2) she is Hispanic; (3) she is a female; and (4) her national\r\norigin is Mexican-American.  Beyond its bare assertions at the hearing on the plea to the\r\njurisdiction, the District did not present any evidence addressing Garcia's retaliation claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tWe find that the evidence submitted by the District merely attacks the merits of\r\nGarcia's underlying causes of action and does not defeat subject-matter jurisdiction.  <em>See\r\nMiranda</em>, 133 S.W.3d at 228 (\"We adhere to the fundamental precept that a court must not\r\nproceed on the merits of a case until legitimate challenges to its jurisdiction have been\r\ndecided. . . .  However, by reserving for the fact finder the resolution of disputed\r\njurisdictional facts that implicate the merits of the claim or defense, we preserve the parties'\r\nright to present the merits of their case at trial.\"); <em>see also</em> <em>Brown</em>, 80 S.W.3d at 555. \r\nAccepting as true the factual allegations made by Garcia in her original petition, taking as\r\ntrue all evidence favorable to Garcia, and indulging every reasonable inference and\r\nresolving any doubts in Garcia's favor, we conclude that Garcia has pleaded sufficient facts\r\ndemonstrating that the trial court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this dispute, and\r\ntherefore, we cannot say that the trial court erred in denying the District's plea to the\r\njurisdiction.<sup> (3)</sup>  <em>See Kirwan</em>, 2009 Tex.

Accordingly, we overrule the District's first issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>B. \tWhether Garcia Complied With Section 21.254 of the Labor Code</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tBy its second issue, the District asserts that Garcia failed to comply with the\r\nmandatory and jurisdictional notice requirements contained in the TCHRA.  <em>See</em> Tex. Lab.\r\nCode Ann. § 21.254.  Garcia contends that she filed suit within the sixty-day deadline\r\nimposed by the TCHRA and that she exercised due diligence in serving the District with\r\nnotice of her lawsuit. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe labor code establishes two timelines with which an aggrieved employee must\r\ncomply.  First, an employee must file an administrative complaint within 180 days of any\r\nalleged discriminatory acts.  <em>See id. </em>§ 21.202(a) (Vernon 2006);<em> Rice v.

Lab. Code Ann. § 21.002(8). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn original submission, the Texas Supreme Court held that immunity is waived as\r\nto a school district under chapter 21 of the labor code.  <em>See Garcia</em>, 253 S.W.3d at 660;\r\n<em>see also Copperas Cove Indep.

(rejecting a\r\nschool district's argument that school districts are not \"employers\" as defined by Chapter\r\n21, and therefore, immunity is not waived).  On appeal, the District essentially asks us to\r\nreconsider the supreme court's resolution of this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tWe first note that the \"law of the case\" doctrine requires that \"questions of law\r\ndecided on appeal to a court of last resort will govern the case throughout its subsequent\r\nstages.\"  <em>Hudson v.

Furthermore, this Court\r\nis bound to follow the supreme court's resolution of this issue.<em>  See Lubbock County v.\r\nTrammel's Lubbock Bail Bonds</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1768247\"><a href=\"/opinion/1768247/lubbock-county-v-trammels-bail-bonds/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span>, 585 (Tex. 2002) (\"It is not the function of\r\na court of appeals to abrogate or modify established precedent. . . .

Generally, the doctrine of stare decisis dictates that once the\r\nSupreme Court announces a proposition of law, the decision is considered binding\r\nprecedent.\").  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe District argues that <em>Garcia</em> is not the \"law of the case\" because the specific\r\nissue of whether a school district is immune under the TCHRA was never fully briefed or\r\nargued.  It further argues that the supreme court's more recent decision in<em> Harris County\r\nHospital District v. Tomball Regional Hospital </em>calls <em>Garcia</em> into question.  <em>See </em><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895112\"><a href=\"/opinion/895112/harris-county-hosp-dist-v-tomball/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">838</span></a></span> (Tex. 2009).  We are unpersuaded by these arguments.  Notwithstanding the lack of\r\nbriefing or argument, the supreme court considered the waiver issue<sup> (5)</sup> and concluded that\r\nthe \"TCHRA clearly and unambiguously waives immunity.\"  <em>Garcia</em>, 253 S.W.3d at 660. \r\nThus, we must conclude that the definition of \"employer\" in chapter 21 of the labor code\r\nincludes school districts, and therefore, immunity is waived.<sup> (6)</sup>  Accordingly, we overrule the\r\nDistrict's third issue.   </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>IV.

The record does not contain\r\ninformation regarding the status of Sotuyo's and Medina's lawsuits; however, they are not parties to this\r\nappeal.  Furthermore, Garcia acknowledges on appeal that Dyer was dismissed from the underlying suit. \r\n</p><p>2.  We are compelled to note that the District's jurisdictional complaints raised in the plea to the\r\njurisdiction at bar could have been raised in the initial plea to the jurisdiction filed in 2004.  While there appears\r\nto be no prohibition on such a piecemeal approach, this practice should be discouraged because of the\r\ninevitable delay and additional expense.  <em>See</em> Tex. Civ.

The District argues that Garcia's alleged failure to notify the District of her suit within the sixty-day\r\nfiling period deprived the trial court of subject-matter jurisdiction, considering section 311.034 of the\r\ngovernment code provides that \"[s]tatutory prerequisites to a suit, including the provision of notice, are\r\njurisdictional requirements in all suits against a governmental entity.\"  <em>See</em> Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 311.034\r\n(Vernon Supp. 2009).  However, the language referenced by the District was not included in the version of\r\nsection 311.034 that was in effect when Garcia filed suit on July 2, 2004.  <em>See</em> Act of June 15, 2001, 77th Leg.,\r\nR.S., ch. 1158, § 8, 2001 Tex. Gen. Laws 2374, 2433 (amended 2005) (current version at Tex. Gov't Code\r\nAnn. § 311.034).  In fact, the predecessor to section 311.034 provided the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tSec. 311.034 WAIVER OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn order to preserve the legislature's interest in managing state fiscal matters through the\r\nappropriations process, a statute shall not be construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity\r\nunless the waiver is effected by clear and unambiguous language.  In a statute, the use of\r\n\"person\" as defined by Section 311.005 to include governmental entities does not indicate\r\nlegislative intent to waive sovereign immunity unless the context of the statute indicates no\r\nother reasonable construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><em>Id.</em>  Because the predecessor to section 311.034 is silent as to statutory prerequisites and jurisdictional\r\nrequirements, we do not consider the District's argument to be persuasive.\r\n</p><p>5.  \"Here, Garcia alleges that the Legislature waived the ISD's immunity in the TCHRA.\"  <em>Garcia</em>, 253\r\nS.W.3d at 660.\r\n</p><p>6.  We also note that the District, in arguing that it is not an \"employer\" within the context of Chapter 21\r\nof the labor code, argues that it is neither a \"political subdivision\" of the State of Texas nor a \"state\r\ninstrumentality.\"  If this were true, then, in reconciling chapter 21 of the labor code with section 51.014 of the\r\ncivil practice and remedies code (the statute authorizing certain interlocutory appeals), the District would not\r\nbe entitled to appeal the trial court's interlocutory order in this case.  <em>Compare</em> Tex. Lab. Code Ann. §\r\n21.002(8) <em>with</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 51.014(a)(8) (providing that a governmental unit as defined\r\nby section 101.001 of the civil practice and remedies code may appeal from an interlocutory order granting\r\nor denying a plea to the jurisdiction); <em>see</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 101.001(3)(B) (defining a\r\n\"[g]overnmental unit\" as \"a political subdivision of this state including any . . . <em>school district </em>. . . \") (emphasis\r\nadded).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
