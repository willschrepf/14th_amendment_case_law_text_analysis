Cowper was convicted of retail theft in 2003, which resulted in a\n\nprobation violation. The trial court sentenced Cowper to 27 months of imprisonment for\n\nthe probation violation. In 2012, Cowper filed his complaint alleging negligence against\n\nthe Saline County circuit clerk, Randy Nyberg, and the Saline County sheriff, Keith\n\nBrown, for not transmitting to the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) the accurate\n\nnumber of days he had served in jail for which he was to receive credit against the\n\n27-month sentence. As a result of the incorrect credit against his sentence, Cowper was\n\n                                                1\n\fincarcerated beyond his legal release date. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss\n\nCowper's complaint pursuant to section 2-615 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS\n\n5/2-615 (West 2010)).     The trial court granted the motion and dismissed Cowper's\n\ncomplaint. Cowper appeals and argues that section 5-4-1(e)(4) of the Unified Code of\n\nCorrections (730 ILCS 5/5-4-1(e)(4) (West 2010)) imposes legal duties upon the\n\ndefendants to compile and transmit to the IDOC the days of credit against a sentence of\n\nimprisonment. He also claims that he has a right to pursue a private cause of action\n\nagainst these defendants for breach of those duties.\n\n¶2                                        FACTS\n\n¶3      On May 12, 2011, Cowper pled guilty to three counts of a 2003 felony case. The\n\ncourt sentenced him to 27 months' imprisonment with 1 year of mandatory supervised\n\nrelease upon discharge. The judgment-sentence filed on June 1, 2011, included a lengthy\n\nsummary of the days Cowper spent in custody for which he was to receive credit. The\n\njudgment-sentence order gave Cowper 275 days of credit against the 27-month sentence.\n\nCowper was transferred to prison on June 2, 2011. After application of the 275 days of\n\ncredit, Cowper's sentence was reduced from 27 months to 13 months and 15 days. On\n\nJune 23, 2011, Cowper filed a motion in the Saline County criminal court to recalculate the\n\ntime.    On November 22, 2011, the State filed its response, stating that after an\n\ninvestigation, the State concluded that the 275 days calculation of credit was wrong. The\n\nState's investigation revealed that Cowper was in Saline County custody from January 8,\n\n2008, until February 2, 2008, and from November 29, 2010, until May 11, 2011, and that\n\nthe State did not give him credit for those days in the original judgment-sentence. The\n                                             2\n\fcourt entered an order directing the State to prepare an amended mittimus to reflect the\n\ncorrect number of days of credit for time served.          The State filed its amended\n\njudgment-sentence directed to the IDOC on November 22, 2011. Cowper had already\n\nbeen released from the Illinois Department of Corrections on October 16, 2011, after\n\nserving the full sentence. The corrected mittimus allowed an additional 191 days' credit\n\nfor time served–for a total of 466 days of credit. As a result of his release from prison,\n\nCowper received no benefit from the additional 191 days of credit for time served.\n\n¶4     On January 20, 2012, Cowper filed suit against the defendants alleging negligence.\n\nHe claimed that each defendant had a duty to transmit the accurate number of days for\n\nwhich he was entitled to credit. Cowper claims that this duty is derived from section\n\n5-4-1(e)(4) of the Unified Code of Corrections (730 ILCS 5/5-4-1(e)(4) (West 2010)). He\n\nalleged that if he had received proper credit for time served, the credit would have been\n\ngreater than the sentence–that defendants breached their duty by failing to transmit to the\n\nIDOC the accurate number of days Cowper had been in custody for which he was entitled\n\ncredit against his sentence. Because of the error in credit against his sentence, Cowper\n\nwas incarcerated from June 2, 2011, through October 16, 2011–a period of 137 days.\n\nCowper alleged that as a direct and proximate result of defendants' negligence, he was\n\ndeprived of his freedom and liberties which resulted in his inability to find and retain\n\nemployment and an inability to be with and care for his family. Cowper asked the court to\n\naward him compensatory damages.\n\n¶5     On March 1, 2012, defendants filed a motion seeking to dismiss Cowper's\n\ncomplaint pursuant to section 2-615 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2-615\n                                            3\n\f(West 2010)). Defendants claimed that Cowper's complaint was defective on its face and\n\ndid not allege sufficient facts upon which a negligence cause of action could be sustained.\n\nDefendants argued that section 5-4-1(e)(4) of the Unified Code of Corrections did not\n\nallow a private cause of action for negligence.\n\n¶6     On July 6, 2012, the trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss. The trial\n\ncourt's stated reasoning frames the issues on appeal, and so we include portions of that\n\norder for reference:\n\n              \"Before the Court is [Defendant]s'        Motion to Dismiss.       The Court\n\n       GRANTS said Motion in respect to the [Defendant] Clerk. [Pursuant to the\n\n       statute], the Clerk is required to send to DOC information he receives from the\n\n       Sheriff concerning time served. No allegation has been made by [Plaintiff] that the\n\n       [Defendant] Clerk failed to transmit such information. As transmission of such\n\n       information is the only duty of the [Defendant] Clerk pursuant to said statute, and no\n\n       allegation has been made that the [Defendant] Clerk failed to do so, [Plaintiff] has\n\n       failed to allege a duty on the part of the [Defendant] Clerk, a breach of which would\n\n       result in a cause of action. As [Defendant]'s Motion pertains to the [Defendant]\n\n       Sheriff, said Motion is GRANTED as well for the reason that said statute fails to\n\n       convey a private cause of action. *** [Plaintiff] could have appealed from his\n\n       sentence and/or filed a post-conviction petition to correct any wrong calculation of\n\n       his good time credit. Therefore this action is not necessary to correct that wrong.\n\n       Additionally, the statute is a criminal sentencing statute. [Plaintiff] is not part of\n\n       the class of persons for whose benefit the statute was designed. None of the other\n                                             4\n\f       requirements are satisfied as well. [Plaintiff]'s Complaint is therefore dismissed.\"\n\n¶7     Cowper appeals this order.\n\n¶8                                   LAW AND ANALYSIS\n\n¶9     When the trial court is presented with a motion to dismiss a case for failure to state a\n\ncause of action pursuant to section 2-615 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS\n\n5/2-615 (West 2010)), the court must determine whether the complaint sets forth sufficient\n\nfacts that, if established, could entitle the plaintiff to relief. Bryson v. News America\n\nPublications, Inc., 174 Ill. 2d 77, 86, 672 N.E.2d 1207, 1214 (1996). The trial court must\n\naccept all well-pleaded facts in the complaint as true and draw reasonable inferences from\n\nthose facts that are favorable to the plaintiff. Bryson, 174 Ill. 2d at 86, 672 N.E.2d at 1213.\n\nBecause the trial court is not being called upon to judge any witness's credibility or weigh\n\nfacts, on appeal we review the matter de novo. Jackson v. Michael Reese Hospital &\n\nMedical Center, 294 Ill. App. 3d 1, 9, 689 N.E.2d 205, 211 (1997).\n\n¶ 10   We begin the legal analysis in this case by determining whether an inmate can\n\npursue a private cause of action pursuant to section 5-4-1(e)(4) of the Unified Code of\n\nCorrections (Code) (730 ILCS 5/5-4-1(e)(4) (West 2010)). We note that Cowper has not\n\ncited, nor have we found, any reported case addressing whether an inmate can file a civil\n\ncause of action pursuant to section 5-4-1(e)(4) of the Code for errors in calculating credits.\n\n¶ 11   In analyzing Cowper's claim that section 5-4-1(e)(4) of the Code allows a private\n\ncause of action, we review the statute itself to determine whether an express cause of action\n\nis allowed. Moore v. Lumpkin, 258 Ill. App. 3d 980, 989, 630 N.E.2d 982, 989 (1994);\n\nJordan v. O'Fallon Township High School District No. 203 Board of Education, 302 Ill.\n                                              5\n\fApp. 3d 1070, 1079, 706 N.E.2d 137, 143 (1999).              If the court can determine the\n\nlegislature's intent from the plain language of the statute, then the court should not resort to\n\nother interpretative aids. Jordan, 302 Ill. App. 3d at 1079, 706 N.E.2d at 143 (citing\n\nPeople v. Fitzpatrick, 158 Ill. 2d 360, 364-65, 633 N.E.2d 685, 687 (1994)).\n\n¶ 12   Section 5-4-1(e)(4) of the Unified Code of Corrections provides:\n\n              \"(e) The clerk of the court shall transmit to the department, agency or\n\n       institution, if any, to which the defendant is committed, the following:\n\n                                                    ***\n\n                      (4) the number of days, if any, which the defendant has been in\n\n              custody and for which he is entitled to credit against the sentence, which\n\n              information shall be provided to the clerk by the sheriff[.]\" 730 ILCS\n\n              5/5-4-1(e)(4) (West 2010).\n\n¶ 13   Section 5-4-1(e)(4) sets forth the actions the clerk of the court and the county sheriff\n\nmust take in compiling and transmitting information regarding a defendant's credits against\n\nsentence. The use of the word \"shall\" generally indicates that the legislative intent is\n\nmandatory. People v. Woodard, 175 Ill. 2d 435, 445, 677 N.E.2d 935, 940 (1997).\n\nHowever, the language of the statute does not set forth any inmate rights in the event of an\n\nerror in credit calculation. Thus, we find that the Code fails to provide an inmate with an\n\nexpress right to pursue a cause of action for an improper calculation of credits against\n\nsentence.\n\n¶ 14   The fact that the wording of the statute does not expressly allow a private cause of\n\naction for violations is not necessarily dispositive of whether the court will allow one.\n                                               6\n\fSawyer Realty Group, Inc. v. Jarvis Corp., 89 Ill. 2d 379, 386, 432 N.E.2d 849, 852 (1982).\n\nThe court can imply a private cause of action where it is consistent with the underlying\n\npurpose of the statute and necessary to achieve the aim of the legislature. Id. The public\n\npolicy underlying the statutory enactments may implicate a private right of action for\n\ncertain individuals when they belong to a class of persons that the Code was designed to\n\nprotect. Id. at 386-87, 432 N.E.2d at 852.\n\n¶ 15   In order for Cowper to bring his claim under the statute, he must establish that he\n\nmeets the criteria for an implied cause of action. Case law has established four factors\n\nwhich must be met to imply a private cause of action:\n\n       \"(1) a plaintiff is a member of the class for whose benefit a piece of legislation was\n\n       enacted; (2) it is consistent with the underlying purpose of the legislation; (3) a\n\n       plaintiff's injury is one the legislation was designed to prevent; and (4) it is\n\n       necessary to provide an adequate remedy for violations of the legislation.\" Noyola\n\n       v. Board of Education of the City of Chicago, 284 Ill. App. 3d 128, 131-32, 671\n\n       N.E.2d 802, 805 (1996), aff'd, 179 Ill. 2d 121, 688 N.E.2d 81 (1997).\n\nCorgan v. Muehling, 143 Ill. 2d 296, 312-13, 574 N.E.2d 602, 609 (1991); Sawyer Realty\n\nGroup, Inc., 89 Ill. 2d at 388-89, 432 N.E.2d at 853; Rodgers v. St. Mary's Hospital of\n\nDecatur, 149 Ill. 2d 302, 308, 597 N.E.2d 616, 619 (1992).\n\n¶ 16   In considering Cowper's argument for an implied cause of action, we first review\n\nthe stated purpose of the Unified Code of Corrections.\n\n              \"§ 1-1-2. Purposes. The purposes of this Code of Corrections are to:\n\n              (a) prescribe sanctions proportionate to the seriousness of the offenses and\n                                             7\n\f       permit the recognition of differences in rehabilitation possibilities among individual\n\n       offenders;\n\n              (b) forbid and prevent the commission of offenses;\n\n              (c) prevent arbitrary or oppressive treatment of persons adjudicated\n\n       offenders or delinquents; and\n\n              (d) restore offenders to useful citizenship.\" 730 ILCS 5/1-1-2 (West 2010).\n\n¶ 17   We now turn to the analysis of the four factors necessary to imply a statutory private\n\ncause of action.\n\n¶ 18   First, we determine whether Cowper belongs to one of the classes of people for\n\nwhose benefit the statute was enacted. Cowper alleges that he was wrongly detained in an\n\nIDOC facility for 137 days. A plain reading of the Unified Code of Corrections purposes\n\nsection makes it clear that an adjudicated offender who claims to be wrongly deprived of\n\nhis liberty places Cowper in one of the classes of people for whose benefit the statute was\n\nenacted, i.e., \"(c) prevent arbitrary or oppressive treatment of persons adjudicated\n\noffenders or delinquents; and (d) restore offenders to useful citizenship\" (730 ILCS\n\n5/1-1-2(c), (d) (West 2010)).\n\n¶ 19   Second, we determine whether a private cause of action is consistent with the\n\npurpose of the legislation. The defendants argue that the underlying purpose of the Code\n\nis for the protection of the public and not for inmates' rights. Consequently, defendants\n\nargue that allowing an inmate to bring a private cause of action would be inconsistent with\n\nthis purpose. We disagree with this statutory interpretation. The plain language of the\n\nstatute and the case law set forth dual purposes directed toward both the public and the\n                                             8\n\fadjudicated offenders. The purposes of the Code are \"designed to protect society from\n\nfuture criminal conduct by past offenders (730 ILCS 5/1-1-2(b) (West 1994)), prevent\n\narbitrary or oppressive deprivations of the liberties of offenders (730 ILCS 5/1-1-2(c)\n\n(West 1994)), and restore offenders to useful citizenship (730 ILCS 5/1-1-2(d) (West\n\n1994)).\" Turner v. Campagna, 281 Ill. App. 3d 1090, 1094, 667 N.E.2d 683, 685 (1996).\n\n\"The general purpose of the Code of Corrections is to rehabilitate the offender, if possible,\n\nand to restore him to useful citizenship.\" People v. Mahle, 57 Ill. 2d 279, 285, 312 N.E.2d\n\n267, 271 (1974).\n\n¶ 20   Defendants cite to McNeil v. Carter in support of their argument that a private cause\n\nof action is inconsistent with the purpose of the Code. McNeil v. Carter, 318 Ill. App. 3d\n\n939, 943, 742 N.E.2d 1277, 1281 (2001). The McNeil court held that the Code did not\n\nimply a private cause of action for an inmate who allegedly received inadequate medical\n\nattention. Id. In so holding, the court noted that \"the primary purpose and function of the\n\nCode is to protect the public.\" Id. To the extent that McNeil finds this purpose to be\n\noverarching, excluding the dual purpose directed toward the treatment and rehabilitation of\n\ninmates, we reject the court's reasoning.      However, we find McNeil inapposite.        In\n\napplying the holding in McNeil, defendants conflate the type of liberty interests in\n\nMcNeil–those more related to the ordinary day-to-day incidents of prison life, with the type\n\nof liberty interests in the instant case–freedom from restraint. The courts must necessarily\n\nbalance prison management concerns with the prisoners' liberty in determining the amount\n\nof process due. Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 478 (1995). Furthermore, we believe\n\nthat the crux of the McNeil decision revolves around factor four–whether a private cause of\n                                             9\n\faction is necessary to provide an adequate remedy, which we will discuss in turn under the\n\nfourth factor analysis.\n\n¶ 21   Third, we determine whether the Cowper's injury is one the legislation was designed\n\nto prevent. Cowper suffered a 137-day incarceration beyond his legal release date. The\n\nprevention of this type of injury is consistent with the stated statutory goals of preventing\n\narbitrary and oppressive treatment and returning offenders to useful citizenship.\n\nFurthermore, section 5-4-1(e)(4) of the Code states, \"The clerk of the court shall transmit\n\nto the department, agency or institution, if any, to which the defendant is committed, the\n\nfollowing: *** (4) the number of days, if any, which the defendant has been in custody and\n\nfor which he is entitled to credit against the sentence, which information shall be provided\n\nto the clerk by the sheriff.\" (Emphasis added.) 730 ILCS 5/5-4-1(e)(4) (West 2010).\n\n\"Generally, the use of the word 'shall' in a statute is regarded as indicating a mandatory\n\nrather than a directory intent.\" Woodard, 175 Ill. 2d at 445, 677 N.E.2d at 940. The\n\nstatutory designation of persons responsible for the mandatory assembling of and\n\ntransmission of the credit against sentence data is additional evidence of the statutory intent\n\nto prevent a prisoner's wrongful confinement.\n\n¶ 22   Fourth, we determine whether a private cause of action is necessary to provide an\n\nadequate remedy for violations of the statute. Citing McNeil v. Carter, defendants argue\n\nthat a private cause of action is not necessary because section 3-8-8 of the Code (730 ILCS\n\n5/3-8-8 (West 2010)) allows for a grievance procedure before the administrative review\n\nboard where relief may be obtained. McNeil v. Carter, 318 Ill. App. 3d 939, 742 N.E.2d\n\n1277 (2001). The facts in McNeil warrant further review since McNeil involved grievance\n                                              10\n\fissues that were internal to the IDOC, unlike the case before us. In McNeil, plaintiff, an\n\ninmate, filed suit against several IDOC employees. Id. at 940, 742 N.E.2d at 1279.\n\nCount I alleged that the defendants did not adequately test and segregate inmates with\n\ninfectious diseases, forcing healthy inmates to share cells with infectious inmates. Id. at\n\n941, 742 N.E.2d at 1279. Count I further alleged that plaintiff was incorrectly placed on a\n\nspecial medical diet and not properly monitored. Id. Plaintiff claimed that these acts\n\nviolated several sections of the Code. Id. In applying the fourth factor to count I, the\n\ncourt found that a private cause of action under the Code was unnecessary to provide an\n\nadequate remedy because (1) the inmate could bring a claim of misconduct before the\n\nadministrative review board, or (2) the inmate could file a federal cause of action under the\n\neighth amendment. Id. at 943, 742 N.E.2d at 1281.\n\n¶ 23   Defendants' reliance on McNeil is misplaced, as the absence of other remedies\n\ndistinguishes this case from McNeil. Cowper has no administrative remedy because the\n\nIDOC lacks the authority to modify a sentence it receives from the sentencing court. Two\n\nCourt of Claims cases are instructive. Evans v. State, 55 Ill. Ct. Cl. 395 (2002); Patton v.\n\nState, 47 Ill. Ct. Cl. 174 (1994). The Evans case involved an incarceration extended\n\nbeyond the legal release date. Evans, 55 Ill. Ct. Cl. at 395. Evans sued the IDOC on a\n\ntheory of negligent incarceration claiming that the IDOC knew or should have known that\n\nhis sentence contained an error in the credit calculation for good time served. Id. at 397.\n\nThe Court of Claims held that the IDOC has no authority to correct a sentencing court's\n\norder and consequently is not responsible for sentencing errors. Id. at 398. The only\n\nrelief was to be found in the sentencing court. Id. In so holding the court stated: \"The\n                                             11\n\ferror in the original mittimus in this case was made by the circuit court, possibly due to an\n\nerror or omission by the circuit court clerk's office or the sheriff's office. Whatever its\n\nsource, the error was fixed in the circuit court sentencing order, which IDOC was duty\n\nbound to enforce, and could not unilaterally correct.\" Id. The Evans court went on to\n\nstate, \"The statutes place the duty of transmitting convicts [sic] sentencing data to IDOC on\n\nthe county sheriff and the circuit clerk, as this court noted in Patton, supra (see, e.g.,\n\nUnified Code of Corrections, //5-4-1, 3-8-1; 730 ILCS 5/5-4-1, 5/3-8-1).\" Id. In Patton,\n\nthe defendant was sentenced to five years in the IDOC. Patton, 47 Ill. Ct. Cl. at 176. The\n\nsentencing order provided that the defendant was to be given credit for time served while in\n\njail awaiting trial, but did not quantify the credit or a projected \"out date.\" Id. There was\n\nno evidence proving the IDOC ever received any jail credit data from either the circuit\n\nclerk or the sheriff.      Id. at 178.   Plaintiff sued the state claiming that the IDOC\n\nnegligently kept him in confinement beyond his legal release date. Id. The court held\n\nthat the State was not responsible for the county's failure to transfer the jail credit data.\n\nThe Patton court stated:\n\n              \"The Unified Code of Corrections imposes on the county sheriff and circuit\n\n       clerk the duties of assembling that data and transmitting it to Respondent. Section\n\n       5-4-1(e)(4) requires the sheriff to provide the information to the circuit clerk, who in\n\n       turn is to then transmit it to Respondent. (730 ILCS 5/5-4-1(e)(4).) Section\n\n       3-8-1(a) imposes a separate duty on the sheriff to independently transmit that data to\n\n       Respondent. (730 ILCS 5/3-8-1(a).) Thus, if all had operated according to the\n\n       statutory scheme, Respondent would have received the jail credit data here twice,\n                                              12\n\f       once from the circuit clerk and once again from the sheriff.\" Id. at 179-80.\n\n¶ 24   It is clear from the holdings in Evans and Patton that Cowper could not have\n\nobtained any relief by filing a grievance with the administrative review board, as the IDOC\n\nhas no authority to correct sentencing errors in a court order.\n\n¶ 25   More recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has\n\naddressed this issue in Shaw v. Germain, 496 F. App'x 646 (7th Cir. 2012). In Shaw, an\n\ninmate brought a section 1983 suit against IDOC officials alleging an eighth amendment\n\nviolation based on a sentencing error. Id. at 647. The Seventh Circuit held that the IDOC\n\ndid not have the authority to amend a sentencing order issued by an Illinois court, citing to\n\nsections 5-4-1(e) and 3-8-1 of the Code (730 ILCS 5/5-4-1(e), 3-8-1 (West 2008)) and\n\nEvans, 55 Ill. Ct. Cl. at 397-98. Shaw, 496 F. App'x at 649. The court stated, \"Shaw\n\nshould have sought relief from the state court.\" Id.\n\n¶ 26   Defendants also cite to Abbasi v. Paraskevoulakos in support of their argument that\n\na private cause of action is not necessary to provide Cowper with an adequate remedy.\n\nAbbasi v. Paraskevoulakos, 187 Ill. 2d 386, 718 N.E.2d 181 (1999). In Abbasi, the\n\nplaintiff sought damages for injuries she incurred from ingesting lead-based paint. Id. at\n\n388, 718 N.E.2d at 182. The plaintiff pled both common law negligence evidenced by\n\nviolation of the Lead Poisoning Prevention Act and a private cause of action under the\n\nLead Poisoning Prevention Act. Id. at 389, 718 N.E.2d at 183. The Illinois Supreme\n\nCourt held that it would not imply a private cause of action under the Act because there\n\nalready existed an adequate remedy under plaintiff's common law negligence theory. Id.\n\nat 393, 718 N.E.2d at 185. The court stated, \"A private cause of action under the Act\n                                             13\n\fwould be identical to plaintiff's common law negligence action pending in the circuit\n\ncourt.\" Id. The important distinction between Abbasi and this case is the type of statute\n\nat issue. The fact that the Lead Poisoning Prevention Act was a statute \"designed to\n\nprotect human life\" allowed plaintiff to plead the violation of the Act as prima facie\n\nevidence of negligence. It is settled law that a \"violation of a statute or ordinance\n\ndesigned to protect human life or property is prima facie evidence of negligence.\" Kalata\n\nv. Anheuser-Busch Cos., 144 Ill. 2d 425, 434, 581 N.E.2d 656, 661 (1991). \"Statutes [that\n\nare] designed to protect human life or property establish the standard of conduct required\n\nof a reasonable person.\" Bier v. Leanna Lakeside Property Ass'n, 305 Ill. App. 3d 45, 58,\n\n711 N.E.2d 773, 783 (1999) (citing Noyola v. Board of Education of the City of Chicago,\n\n179 Ill. 2d 121, 130, 688 N.E.2d 81, 84-85 (1997)). We believe that the statute in question\n\nhere cannot be characterized as a safety statute so as to allow Cowper to plead the statutory\n\nviolation as a common law negligence theory. Therefore, unlike in Abbasi, a finding of an\n\nimplied cause of action under the Unified Code of Corrections does not duplicate an\n\nexisting remedy.\n\n¶ 27   Nor does Cowper's suit against the circuit clerk and the sheriff serve as a basis for a\n\nconstitutional claim. In Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 328 (1986), a prisoner brought\n\nan action in federal district court under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against a deputy sheriff for\n\ninjuries he alleged he sustained when falling on a pillow negligently left on a stairway by\n\nthe deputy. Id. The United States Supreme Court held that the due process clause is not\n\nimplicated by an official's negligent act causing unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty,\n\nor property. Id. In so holding the Court went on to state, \"That injuries inflicted by\n                                              14\n\fgovernmental negligence are not addressed by the United States Constitution is not to say\n\nthat they may not raise significant legal concerns and lead to the creation of protectible\n\nlegal interests.\"   Id. at 333.    \"Whatever other provisions of state law or general\n\njurisprudence he may rightly invoke, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution does not afford him a remedy.\" Id. at 336. Incarcerating a prisoner beyond\n\nhis legal release date does not implicate the eighth amendment unless it is the product of\n\n\"deliberate indifference.\" Campbell v. Peters, 256 F.3d 695, 700 (7th Cir. 2001). Here,\n\nit is clear that because Cowper's claims against the circuit clerk and the sheriff sound in\n\nnegligence, he is not afforded a constitutional remedy.\n\n¶ 28   Also relevant to our analysis is the nature of the defendants' alleged negligent\n\nconduct with respect to the potential for an immunity defense. In general, public officials\n\ncannot be held liable for discretionary acts performed within the scope of their authority.\n\nMora v. State, 68 Ill. 2d 223, 233-34, 369 N.E.2d 868, 873 (1977). If an act is ministerial\n\nin nature, the official may be subject to liability for the negligent performance of that duty.\n\nHicks v. Williams, 104 Ill. App. 3d 172, 177, 432 N.E.2d 1278, 1281 (1982). \"Ministerial\n\nacts are those that a person performs on a given state of facts in a prescribed manner, in\n\nobedience to the mandate of legal authority, and without reference to the official's\n\ndiscretion as to the propriety of the act.\" Koltes v. St. Charles Park District, 293 Ill. App.\n\n3d 171, 176, 687 N.E.2d 543, 546 (1997). We believe that the legislative use of the\n\nlanguage \"shall\" in describing the defendants' duties indicates a mandatory intent.\n\nWoodard, 175 Ill. 2d at 445, 677 N.E.2d at 940. We find the described conduct to be\n\nministerial. People v. Scott, 277 Ill. App. 3d 565, 566, 660 N.E.2d 1316, 1316-17 (1996)\n                                              15\n\f(granting pretrial-custody credit against a fine pursuant to section 110-14 of the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure of 1963 (725 ILCS 5/110-14 (West 1994)) is a simple ministerial act).\n\n¶ 29   By dismissing the complaint, the trial court here effectively found that Cowper was\n\nnot entitled to any relief from being wrongfully incarcerated for 137 days. Cowper's\n\ntimely posttrial motion to recalculate his time went unaddressed by the court for almost\n\nfive months. By the time the State conceded the mistake and a new mittimus was issued,\n\nCowper realized no benefit, as he had already been released from prison. At this juncture,\n\ncompensatory damages are the only relief that will make Cowper whole. While Cowper's\n\ninjury may not be a constitutionally protectable liberty interest as pled, we believe that\n\npublic policy dictates that the wrongful deprivation of one's liberty raises significant legal\n\nconcerns that must be redressed.\n\n¶ 30   We find that as an incarcerated adjudicated offender, Cowper was a member of one\n\nof the classes for whose benefit the statute was enacted; that implication of a private cause\n\nof action is consistent with two of the stated purposes of the Code–to prevent arbitrary or\n\noppressive treatment of adjudicated offenders and to restore offenders to useful\n\ncitizenship; that Cowper's wrongful incarceration is an injury the statute is designed to\n\nprevent; and that a civil private cause of action for compensatory damages is necessary to\n\nprovide an adequate remedy for the breach of the mandated duties of both the sheriff and\n\nthe clerk. Under these circumstances, we recognize an implied private right of action for\n\ndamages.\n\n¶ 31   We conclude that section 5-4-1(e)(4) of the Unified Code of Corrections places the\n\nduty of assembling and transmitting the prisoner's sentencing data to the IDOC on the\n                                             16\n\fsheriff and the circuit court clerk–the sheriff to assemble the credit against sentence data\n\nand transmit that information to the clerk, and the clerk to transmit the information\n\nreceived from the sheriff to the IDOC. At the pleading stage we view the facts and their\n\ninferences in a light most favorable to Cowper and find that he has adequately pled duty,\n\nbreach, proximate cause, and damages sufficient to state a cause of action implied by the\n\nstatute.\n\n¶ 32                                   CONCLUSION\n\n¶ 33     We hold that the trial court erred in granting the dismissal of Cowper's statutory\n\nclaim.     Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause for further\n\nproceedings consistent with our holding.\n\n\n\n¶ 34     Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f                              2014 IL App (5th) 120415\n\n                                    NO. 5-12-0415\n\n                                      IN THE\n\n                        APPELLATE COURT OF ILLINOIS\n\n                               FIFTH DISTRICT\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nDEANGELO M.

Cowper was convicted of retail theft in 2003, which resulted in a\n\nprobation violation. The trial court sentenced Cowper to 27 months of imprisonment for\n\nthe probation violation. In 2012, Cowper filed his complaint alleging negligence against\n\nthe Saline County circuit clerk, Randy Nyberg, and the Saline County sheriff, Keith\n\nBrown, for not transmitting to the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) the accurate\n\nnumber of days he had served in jail for which he was to receive credit against the\n\n27-month sentence. As a result of the incorrect credit against his sentence, Cowper was\n\n                                                1\n\fincarcerated beyond his legal release date. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss\n\nCowper's complaint pursuant to section 2-615 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS\n\n5/2-615 (West 2010)).     The trial court granted the motion and dismissed Cowper's\n\ncomplaint. Cowper appeals and argues that section 5-4-1(e)(4) of the Unified Code of\n\nCorrections (730 ILCS 5/5-4-1(e)(4) (West 2010)) imposes legal duties upon the\n\ndefendants to compile and transmit to the IDOC the days of credit against a sentence of\n\nimprisonment. He also claims that he has a right to pursue a private cause of action\n\nagainst these defendants for breach of those duties.\n\n¶2                                        FACTS\n\n¶3      On May 12, 2011, Cowper pled guilty to three counts of a 2003 felony case. The\n\ncourt sentenced him to 27 months' imprisonment with 1 year of mandatory supervised\n\nrelease upon discharge. The judgment-sentence filed on June 1, 2011, included a lengthy\n\nsummary of the days Cowper spent in custody for which he was to receive credit. The\n\njudgment-sentence order gave Cowper 275 days of credit against the 27-month sentence.\n\nCowper was transferred to prison on June 2, 2011. After application of the 275 days of\n\ncredit, Cowper's sentence was reduced from 27 months to 13 months and 15 days. On\n\nJune 23, 2011, Cowper filed a motion in the Saline County criminal court to recalculate the\n\ntime.    On November 22, 2011, the State filed its response, stating that after an\n\ninvestigation, the State concluded that the 275 days calculation of credit was wrong. The\n\nState's investigation revealed that Cowper was in Saline County custody from January 8,\n\n2008, until February 2, 2008, and from November 29, 2010, until May 11, 2011, and that\n\nthe State did not give him credit for those days in the original judgment-sentence. The\n                                             2\n\fcourt entered an order directing the State to prepare an amended mittimus to reflect the\n\ncorrect number of days of credit for time served.          The State filed its amended\n\njudgment-sentence directed to the IDOC on November 22, 2011. Cowper had already\n\nbeen released from the Illinois Department of Corrections on October 16, 2011, after\n\nserving the full sentence. The corrected mittimus allowed an additional 191 days' credit\n\nfor time served–for a total of 466 days of credit. As a result of his release from prison,\n\nCowper received no benefit from the additional 191 days of credit for time served.\n\n¶4     On January 20, 2012, Cowper filed suit against the defendants alleging negligence.\n\nHe claimed that each defendant had a duty to transmit the accurate number of days for\n\nwhich he was entitled to credit. Cowper claims that this duty is derived from section\n\n5-4-1(e)(4) of the Unified Code of Corrections (730 ILCS 5/5-4-1(e)(4) (West 2010)). He\n\nalleged that if he had received proper credit for time served, the credit would have been\n\ngreater than the sentence–that defendants breached their duty by failing to transmit to the\n\nIDOC the accurate number of days Cowper had been in custody for which he was entitled\n\ncredit against his sentence. Because of the error in credit against his sentence, Cowper\n\nwas incarcerated from June 2, 2011, through October 16, 2011–a period of 137 days.\n\nCowper alleged that as a direct and proximate result of defendants' negligence, he was\n\ndeprived of his freedom and liberties which resulted in his inability to find and retain\n\nemployment and an inability to be with and care for his family. Cowper asked the court to\n\naward him compensatory damages.\n\n¶5     On March 1, 2012, defendants filed a motion seeking to dismiss Cowper's\n\ncomplaint pursuant to section 2-615 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2-615\n                                            3\n\f(West 2010)). Defendants claimed that Cowper's complaint was defective on its face and\n\ndid not allege sufficient facts upon which a negligence cause of action could be sustained.\n\nDefendants argued that section 5-4-1(e)(4) of the Unified Code of Corrections did not\n\nallow a private cause of action for negligence.\n\n¶6     On July 6, 2012, the trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss. The trial\n\ncourt's stated reasoning frames the issues on appeal, and so we include portions of that\n\norder for reference:\n\n              \"Before the Court is [Defendant]s'        Motion to Dismiss.       The Court\n\n       GRANTS said Motion in respect to the [Defendant] Clerk. [Pursuant to the\n\n       statute], the Clerk is required to send to DOC information he receives from the\n\n       Sheriff concerning time served. No allegation has been made by [Plaintiff] that the\n\n       [Defendant] Clerk failed to transmit such information. As transmission of such\n\n       information is the only duty of the [Defendant] Clerk pursuant to said statute, and no\n\n       allegation has been made that the [Defendant] Clerk failed to do so, [Plaintiff] has\n\n       failed to allege a duty on the part of the [Defendant] Clerk, a breach of which would\n\n       result in a cause of action. As [Defendant]'s Motion pertains to the [Defendant]\n\n       Sheriff, said Motion is GRANTED as well for the reason that said statute fails to\n\n       convey a private cause of action. *** [Plaintiff] could have appealed from his\n\n       sentence and/or filed a post-conviction petition to correct any wrong calculation of\n\n       his good time credit. Therefore this action is not necessary to correct that wrong.\n\n       Additionally, the statute is a criminal sentencing statute.

Purposes. The purposes of this Code of Corrections are to:\n\n              (a) prescribe sanctions proportionate to the seriousness of the offenses and\n                                             7\n\f       permit the recognition of differences in rehabilitation possibilities among individual\n\n       offenders;\n\n              (b) forbid and prevent the commission of offenses;\n\n              (c) prevent arbitrary or oppressive treatment of persons adjudicated\n\n       offenders or delinquents; and\n\n              (d) restore offenders to useful citizenship.\" 730 ILCS 5/1-1-2 (West 2010).\n\n¶ 17   We now turn to the analysis of the four factors necessary to imply a statutory private\n\ncause of action.\n\n¶ 18   First, we determine whether Cowper belongs to one of the classes of people for\n\nwhose benefit the statute was enacted. Cowper alleges that he was wrongly detained in an\n\nIDOC facility for 137 days. A plain reading of the Unified Code of Corrections purposes\n\nsection makes it clear that an adjudicated offender who claims to be wrongly deprived of\n\nhis liberty places Cowper in one of the classes of people for whose benefit the statute was\n\nenacted, i.e., \"(c) prevent arbitrary or oppressive treatment of persons adjudicated\n\noffenders or delinquents; and (d) restore offenders to useful citizenship\" (730 ILCS\n\n5/1-1-2(c), (d) (West 2010)).\n\n¶ 19   Second, we determine whether a private cause of action is consistent with the\n\npurpose of the legislation. The defendants argue that the underlying purpose of the Code\n\nis for the protection of the public and not for inmates' rights. Consequently, defendants\n\nargue that allowing an inmate to bring a private cause of action would be inconsistent with\n\nthis purpose. We disagree with this statutory interpretation. The plain language of the\n\nstatute and the case law set forth dual purposes directed toward both the public and the\n                                             8\n\fadjudicated offenders. The purposes of the Code are \"designed to protect society from\n\nfuture criminal conduct by past offenders (730 ILCS 5/1-1-2(b) (West 1994)), prevent\n\narbitrary or oppressive deprivations of the liberties of offenders (730 ILCS 5/1-1-2(c)\n\n(West 1994)), and restore offenders to useful citizenship (730 ILCS 5/1-1-2(d) (West\n\n1994)).\" Turner v.

Carter in support of their argument that a private cause\n\nof action is inconsistent with the purpose of the Code. McNeil v. Carter, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">939</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 943, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2220593\"><a href=\"/opinion/2220593/mcneil-v-carter/\"><span class=\"volume\">742</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1277</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1281 (2001). The McNeil court held that the Code did not\n\nimply a private cause of action for an inmate who allegedly received inadequate medical\n\nattention. Id. In so holding, the court noted that \"the primary purpose and function of the\n\nCode is to protect the public.\" Id. To the extent that McNeil finds this purpose to be\n\noverarching, excluding the dual purpose directed toward the treatment and rehabilitation of\n\ninmates, we reject the court's reasoning.      However, we find McNeil inapposite.        In\n\napplying the holding in McNeil, defendants conflate the type of liberty interests in\n\nMcNeil–those more related to the ordinary day-to-day incidents of prison life, with the type\n\nof liberty interests in the instant case–freedom from restraint. The courts must necessarily\n\nbalance prison management concerns with the prisoners' liberty in determining the amount\n\nof process due. Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 478 (1995). Furthermore, we believe\n\nthat the crux of the McNeil decision revolves around factor four–whether a private cause of\n                                             9\n\faction is necessary to provide an adequate remedy, which we will discuss in turn under the\n\nfourth factor analysis.\n\n¶ 21   Third, we determine whether the Cowper's injury is one the legislation was designed\n\nto prevent. Cowper suffered a 137-day incarceration beyond his legal release date. The\n\nprevention of this type of injury is consistent with the stated statutory goals of preventing\n\narbitrary and oppressive treatment and returning offenders to useful citizenship.\n\nFurthermore, section 5-4-1(e)(4) of the Code states, \"The clerk of the court shall transmit\n\nto the department, agency or institution, if any, to which the defendant is committed, the\n\nfollowing: *** (4) the number of days, if any, which the defendant has been in custody and\n\nfor which he is entitled to credit against the sentence, which information shall be provided\n\nto the clerk by the sheriff.\" (Emphasis added.) 730 ILCS 5/5-4-1(e)(4) (West 2010).\n\n\"Generally, the use of the word 'shall' in a statute is regarded as indicating a mandatory\n\nrather than a directory intent.\" Woodard, 175 Ill. 2d at 445, 677 N.E.2d at 940. The\n\nstatutory designation of persons responsible for the mandatory assembling of and\n\ntransmission of the credit against sentence data is additional evidence of the statutory intent\n\nto prevent a prisoner's wrongful confinement.\n\n¶ 22   Fourth, we determine whether a private cause of action is necessary to provide an\n\nadequate remedy for violations of the statute. Citing McNeil v. Carter, defendants argue\n\nthat a private cause of action is not necessary because section 3-8-8 of the Code (730 ILCS\n\n5/3-8-8 (West 2010)) allows for a grievance procedure before the administrative review\n\nboard where relief may be obtained. McNeil v. Carter, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">939</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2220593\"><a href=\"/opinion/2220593/mcneil-v-carter/\"><span class=\"volume\">742</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1277</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001). The facts in McNeil warrant further review since McNeil involved grievance\n                                              10\n\fissues that were internal to the IDOC, unlike the case before us. In McNeil, plaintiff, an\n\ninmate, filed suit against several IDOC employees. Id. at 940, 742 N.E.2d at 1279.\n\nCount I alleged that the defendants did not adequately test and segregate inmates with\n\ninfectious diseases, forcing healthy inmates to share cells with infectious inmates. Id. at\n\n941, 742 N.E.2d at 1279. Count I further alleged that plaintiff was incorrectly placed on a\n\nspecial medical diet and not properly monitored. Id. Plaintiff claimed that these acts\n\nviolated several sections of the Code. Id. In applying the fourth factor to count I, the\n\ncourt found that a private cause of action under the Code was unnecessary to provide an\n\nadequate remedy because (1) the inmate could bring a claim of misconduct before the\n\nadministrative review board, or (2) the inmate could file a federal cause of action under the\n\neighth amendment. Id. at 943, 742 N.E.2d at 1281.\n\n¶ 23   Defendants' reliance on McNeil is misplaced, as the absence of other remedies\n\ndistinguishes this case from McNeil. Cowper has no administrative remedy because the\n\nIDOC lacks the authority to modify a sentence it receives from the sentencing court. Two\n\nCourt of Claims cases are instructive. Evans v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. Ct. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">395</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002); Patton v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. Ct. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994). The Evans case involved an incarceration extended\n\nbeyond the legal release date. Evans, 55 Ill. Ct. Cl. at 395. Evans sued the IDOC on a\n\ntheory of negligent incarceration claiming that the IDOC knew or should have known that\n\nhis sentence contained an error in the credit calculation for good time served. Id. at 397.\n\nThe Court of Claims held that the IDOC has no authority to correct a sentencing court's\n\norder and consequently is not responsible for sentencing errors. Id. at 398. The only\n\nrelief was to be found in the sentencing court. Id. In so holding the court stated: \"The\n                                             11\n\ferror in the original mittimus in this case was made by the circuit court, possibly due to an\n\nerror or omission by the circuit court clerk's office or the sheriff's office. Whatever its\n\nsource, the error was fixed in the circuit court sentencing order, which IDOC was duty\n\nbound to enforce, and could not unilaterally correct.\" Id. The Evans court went on to\n\nstate, \"The statutes place the duty of transmitting convicts [sic] sentencing data to IDOC on\n\nthe county sheriff and the circuit clerk, as this court noted in Patton, supra (see, e.g.,\n\nUnified Code of Corrections, //5-4-1, 3-8-1; 730 ILCS 5/5-4-1, 5/3-8-1).\" Id. In Patton,\n\nthe defendant was sentenced to five years in the IDOC. Patton, 47 Ill. Ct. Cl. at 176. The\n\nsentencing order provided that the defendant was to be given credit for time served while in\n\njail awaiting trial, but did not quantify the credit or a projected \"out date.\" Id. There was\n\nno evidence proving the IDOC ever received any jail credit data from either the circuit\n\nclerk or the sheriff.      Id. at 178.   Plaintiff sued the state claiming that the IDOC\n\nnegligently kept him in confinement beyond his legal release date. Id. The court held\n\nthat the State was not responsible for the county's failure to transfer the jail credit data.\n\nThe Patton court stated:\n\n              \"The Unified Code of Corrections imposes on the county sheriff and circuit\n\n       clerk the duties of assembling that data and transmitting it to Respondent. Section\n\n       5-4-1(e)(4) requires the sheriff to provide the information to the circuit clerk, who in\n\n       turn is to then transmit it to Respondent. (730 ILCS 5/5-4-1(e)(4).) Section\n\n       3-8-1(a) imposes a separate duty on the sheriff to independently transmit that data to\n\n       Respondent. (730 ILCS 5/3-8-1(a).) Thus, if all had operated according to the\n\n       statutory scheme, Respondent would have received the jail credit data here twice,\n                                              12\n\f       once from the circuit clerk and once again from the sheriff.\" Id. at 179-80.\n\n¶ 24   It is clear from the holdings in Evans and Patton that Cowper could not have\n\nobtained any relief by filing a grievance with the administrative review board, as the IDOC\n\nhas no authority to correct sentencing errors in a court order.\n\n¶ 25   More recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has\n\naddressed this issue in Shaw v. Germain, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. App'x</span> <span class=\"page\">646</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2012). In Shaw, an\n\ninmate brought a section 1983 suit against IDOC officials alleging an eighth amendment\n\nviolation based on a sentencing error. Id. at 647. The Seventh Circuit held that the IDOC\n\ndid not have the authority to amend a sentencing order issued by an Illinois court, citing to\n\nsections 5-4-1(e) and 3-8-1 of the Code (730 ILCS 5/5-4-1(e), 3-8-1 (West 2008)) and\n\nEvans, 55 Ill. Ct. Cl. at 397-98. Shaw, 496 F. App'x at 649. The court stated, \"Shaw\n\nshould have sought relief from the state court.\" Id.\n\n¶ 26   Defendants also cite to Abbasi v. Paraskevoulakos in support of their argument that\n\na private cause of action is not necessary to provide Cowper with an adequate remedy.\n\nAbbasi v. Paraskevoulakos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2052637\"><a href=\"/opinion/2052637/abbasi-ex-rel-abbasi-v-paraskevoulakos/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2052637\"><a href=\"/opinion/2052637/abbasi-ex-rel-abbasi-v-paraskevoulakos/\"><span class=\"volume\">718</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999). In Abbasi, the\n\nplaintiff sought damages for injuries she incurred from ingesting lead-based paint. Id. at\n\n388, 718 N.E.2d at 182. The plaintiff pled both common law negligence evidenced by\n\nviolation of the Lead Poisoning Prevention Act and a private cause of action under the\n\nLead Poisoning Prevention Act. Id. at 389, 718 N.E.2d at 183. The Illinois Supreme\n\nCourt held that it would not imply a private cause of action under the Act because there\n\nalready existed an adequate remedy under plaintiff's common law negligence theory. Id.\n\nat 393, 718 N.E.2d at 185. The court stated, \"A private cause of action under the Act\n                                             13\n\fwould be identical to plaintiff's common law negligence action pending in the circuit\n\ncourt.\" Id. The important distinction between Abbasi and this case is the type of statute\n\nat issue. The fact that the Lead Poisoning Prevention Act was a statute \"designed to\n\nprotect human life\" allowed plaintiff to plead the violation of the Act as prima facie\n\nevidence of negligence. It is settled law that a \"violation of a statute or ordinance\n\ndesigned to protect human life or property is prima facie evidence of negligence.\" Kalata\n\nv.

We believe that the statute in question\n\nhere cannot be characterized as a safety statute so as to allow Cowper to plead the statutory\n\nviolation as a common law negligence theory. Therefore, unlike in Abbasi, a finding of an\n\nimplied cause of action under the Unified Code of Corrections does not duplicate an\n\nexisting remedy.\n\n¶ 27   Nor does Cowper's suit against the circuit clerk and the sheriff serve as a basis for a\n\nconstitutional claim. In Daniels v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111555\"><a href=\"/opinion/111555/daniels-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 328 (1986), a prisoner brought\n\nan action in federal district court under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against a deputy sheriff for\n\ninjuries he alleged he sustained when falling on a pillow negligently left on a stairway by\n\nthe deputy. Id. The United States Supreme Court held that the due process clause is not\n\nimplicated by an official's negligent act causing unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty,\n\nor property. Id. In so holding the Court went on to state, \"That injuries inflicted by\n                                              14\n\fgovernmental negligence are not addressed by the United States Constitution is not to say\n\nthat they may not raise significant legal concerns and lead to the creation of protectible\n\nlegal interests.\"   Id. at 333.    \"Whatever other provisions of state law or general\n\njurisprudence he may rightly invoke, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution does not afford him a remedy.\" Id. at 336. Incarcerating a prisoner beyond\n\nhis legal release date does not implicate the eighth amendment unless it is the product of\n\n\"deliberate indifference.\" Campbell v. Peters, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773977\"><a href=\"/opinion/773977/don-campbell-aka-donald-lee-plaintiff-appelleecross-appellant-v-howard/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">695</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 700 (7th Cir. 2001). Here,\n\nit is clear that because Cowper's claims against the circuit clerk and the sheriff sound in\n\nnegligence, he is not afforded a constitutional remedy.\n\n¶ 28   Also relevant to our analysis is the nature of the defendants' alleged negligent\n\nconduct with respect to the potential for an immunity defense. In general, public officials\n\ncannot be held liable for discretionary acts performed within the scope of their authority.\n\nMora v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2057587\"><a href=\"/opinion/2057587/mora-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 233-34, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2057587\"><a href=\"/opinion/2057587/mora-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 873 (1977).

Cowper's\n\ntimely posttrial motion to recalculate his time went unaddressed by the court for almost\n\nfive months. By the time the State conceded the mistake and a new mittimus was issued,\n\nCowper realized no benefit, as he had already been released from prison. At this juncture,\n\ncompensatory damages are the only relief that will make Cowper whole. While Cowper's\n\ninjury may not be a constitutionally protectable liberty interest as pled, we believe that\n\npublic policy dictates that the wrongful deprivation of one's liberty raises significant legal\n\nconcerns that must be redressed.\n\n¶ 30   We find that as an incarcerated adjudicated offender, Cowper was a member of one\n\nof the classes for whose benefit the statute was enacted; that implication of a private cause\n\nof action is consistent with two of the stated purposes of the Code–to prevent arbitrary or\n\noppressive treatment of adjudicated offenders and to restore offenders to useful\n\ncitizenship; that Cowper's wrongful incarceration is an injury the statute is designed to\n\nprevent; and that a civil private cause of action for compensatory damages is necessary to\n\nprovide an adequate remedy for the breach of the mandated duties of both the sheriff and\n\nthe clerk. Under these circumstances, we recognize an implied private right of action for\n\ndamages.\n\n¶ 31   We conclude that section 5-4-1(e)(4) of the Unified Code of Corrections places the\n\nduty of assembling and transmitting the prisoner's sentencing data to the IDOC on the\n                                             16\n\fsheriff and the circuit court clerk–the sheriff to assemble the credit against sentence data\n\nand transmit that information to the clerk, and the clerk to transmit the information\n\nreceived from the sheriff to the IDOC. At the pleading stage we view the facts and their\n\ninferences in a light most favorable to Cowper and find that he has adequately pled duty,\n\nbreach, proximate cause, and damages sufficient to state a cause of action implied by the\n\nstatute.\n\n¶ 32                                   CONCLUSION\n\n¶ 33     We hold that the trial court erred in granting the dismissal of Cowper's statutory\n\nclaim.     Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause for further\n\nproceedings consistent with our holding.\n\n\n\n¶ 34     Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f                              2014 IL App (5th) 120415\n\n                                    NO. 5-12-0415\n\n                                      IN THE\n\n                        APPELLATE COURT OF ILLINOIS\n\n                               FIFTH DISTRICT\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nDEANGELO M.
