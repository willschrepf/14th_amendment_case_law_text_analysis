This matter\n\nstems from Lea’s post-divorce filing of an enforcement action against Scott. At\n\nthe conclusion of trial, Scott was awarded sanctions against Lea for her having\n\nfiled a frivolous motion. All matters between the parties were heard in the 309th\n\nJudicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, the Honorable Sherry Y. Dean,\n\npresiding.\n\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\f                                     Statement of Facts\n\n      To correct certain inaccuracies contained in Appellant’s Statement of Facts,\n\nScott offers this Statement of Facts.\n\n      Lea and Scott, each a medical doctor by training, were married, but on\n\nFebruary 4, 2009, Lea filed a divorce action. (RR 1:46).\n\n      In their divorce action, Lea’s counsel was J.D. Bucky Allshouse\n\n(“Allshouse”), and Scott’s counsel was Richard L. Flowers, Jr. (“Flowers”) (PE 1).\n\nThe parties attended two mediation sessions in an effort to resolve the issues in\n\ntheir divorce. (RR 3:45) They reached an agreement at mediation, which was\n\nultimately memorialized in a Final Decree of Divorce (“Decree”) (PE 1) and an\n\nAgreement Incident to Divorce (“AID”) (PE 2). The parties signed the AID and\n\nthe trial court entered the Decree on September 3, 2010. (PE 1 & 2).\n\n      On September 7, 2010 – four days following the divorce – Flowers sent a\n\nletter to Allshouse, which, included the following pertinent statements:\n\n                   • “I’m sending an assignment for Scott’s share of the savings\n                     bonds. However, I think the bonds will have to be endorsed.”\n\n                   • “The Lincoln Investment account is being divided as per the\n                     AID. The actual securities are being divided so Lea will need\n                     to let Ross McLaurin 1 know where he is to send her share of\n                     these securities.”\n\n                   • “Otherwise, here’s what I see as the remaining action items:\n\n\n      1\n          Ross McLaurin shall be hereinafter referred to as “Ross.”\n\n\n                                                9\n\f                         1. The savings bonds need to be divided. Lea has\n                            possession of all the bonds so I need to know when\n                            and where to pick them up from her.\n                         2. Scott will exchange the diamond for his Rolex.\n                            Again, please let me know when Lea’s ready to do\n                            that.\n                         3. Scott needs to get the plates, Christmas ornaments and\n                            stuffed animals ready for Lea to pick up.\n                         4. The parties need to make arrangements for copying\n                            photos and videos.”\n\n(RE 20). The letter was part of Scott’s effort to divide the property awarded to\n\neach of the parties pursuant to the AID and Decree. (RR 6:25).\n\n      Following the September 7 letter, Scott received additional documents from\n\nAllshouse that he was to sign in order to transfer “things” to Lea. (RR 5:154).\n\n      On September 8, 2010, Scott executed three transfer documents, assigning to\n\nLea various assets. (RE 22). Scott signed these documents in an effort to promptly\n\neffectuate transfer following the conclusion of the divorce. (RR 6:26). Later,\n\nFlowers sent a “corrected Assignment of Interest” to Allshouse for Lea’s signature\n\n(R 23) to effectively divide the savings bonds. (RR 6:28).\n\n      On Tuesday, January 4, 2011, Lea, by and through Daniel Lemkuil\n\n(“Lemkuil”) filed a Motion to Enforce Final Decree of Divorce and Agreement\n\nIncident to Divorce (the “Original Enforcement”) (Supp. CR 37). In the Original\n\nEnforcement, Lea sought (generally and in addition to various unfounded tort\n\nclaims) to enforce the transfer of ten items awarded to Lea in the AID: (i) a\n\ndiamond given to Lea by Patrick Brannan (“Item 1”); (ii) “coins belonging to Lea\n\n                                         10\n\for Christopher” (the parties’ son) (“Item 2”); (iii) real property in Oklahoma (“Item\n\n3”); (iv) a First Colony Life Insurance Policy (“Item 4”); (v) a portion of an\n\naccount with Lincoln Investments (“Item 5”); (vi) various United States Savings\n\nBonds (“Item 6”); (vii) a 2006 Lexus GX470 (“Item 7”); (viii) the award of “fifty\n\npercent (50%) net of taxes of ANY bonuses or reimbursements received by\n\nHusband through April 30, 2010” (“Item 8”); (ix) the contents of safety deposit\n\nboxes at BBVA Compass and Wells Fargo banks (“Item 9”); and (x) various\n\nChristmas ornaments and other personal property (“Item 10”). (Supp. CR 37-44).\n\n      Upon learning of the Original Enforcement, Flowers sent Lemkuil a letter\n\ndated January 11, 2011, which – in pertinent part – said:\n\n                   As a vital part of the reasonable inquiry you\n                   are required to have done prior to initiating\n                   this motion, I’m assuming you have spoken\n                   to Bucky Allshouse and members of his\n                   staff, including Rebecca Tipton about the\n                   efforts they made along with my office to\n                   conclude the property transfers. I invite you\n                   to call Ross McLaurin, telephone number\n                   713/789-0800, and inquire about his many\n                   efforts to date to transfer property to your\n                   client. You (sic) client refuses to cooperate\n                   with anyone. She also refuses to transfer\n                   property she has to my client.\n\n(RE 24).\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f       On January 25, 2011, Flowers sent a letter to Lemkuil “following up to\n\nschedule a meeting to discuss what remains to be done to close this case.” (RE\n\n26).\n\n       On February 1, 2011, Lemkuil sent a letter to Flowers, asking Flowers to\n\nmake Items 1 through 10 available to him at a meeting scheduled for February 3,\n\n2011. (RE 25).\n\n       On February 3, 2011, Flowers and Lemkuil met at Flowers’ office,\n\nostensibly to resolve the matter. (RR 6:133; RE 27). Lemkuil abruptly ended the\n\nmeeting after a short period. Flowers then sent an email outlining Scott’s position\n\nrelative to the Original Enforcement, stating, “The September 7th letter [to\n\nAllshouse] addresses nearly every item made the basis of your enforcement action.\n\nVirtually every issue not addressed in my September 7th letter but made the basis\n\nof your enforcement suit has never been requested or addressed until you filed your\n\nlawsuit.” (RE 27). Flowers specifically addressed the following issues:\n\n                                Item 1 (Diamond)\n\n            “We’ve always stood ready to exchange the diamond for\n            my client’s Rolex watch, but Lea refuses.”\n\n                  Items 4 & 6 (First Colony & Savings Bonds)\n\n            “Also attached are copies of assignments signed by my\n            client last September and October which we’ve had ready\n            to exchange for the assignments from your client to\n            mine.”\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\f                          Item 5 (Lincoln Investments)\n\n            “In my January 11, 2011 letter to you I invited you to call\n            my client’s financial advisor, Ross McLaurin, and\n            provided his telephone number, 713/789 – 0800. I know\n            you never called Ross. If you had you would have\n            learned about his efforts to transfer funds to your client.\n            You also seemed to know nothing about the financial\n            advisor Lea hired who Ross has been working with. You\n            also knew nothing about the information Ross and Lea’s\n            financial advisor had exchanged about the very issue\n            made the basis of your lawsuit. You could have asked\n            Ross to provide the documentation your client wants\n            about the Lincoln account.”\n\n                        Item 10 (Christmas Ornaments)\n\n            “[Lea has] never attempted to arrange to pick up the\n            plates, ornaments, and other items which have been\n            boxed and ready to exchange for months.”\n\nId. Flowers concluded, stating, “Dan, if you pursue this lawsuit without making\n\nany inquiry I will immediately file a bad faith claim against you and your client.\n\nHandle it correctly and we’ll get it resolved.”     Id.   In response to Flowers’\n\nFebruary 3 email, Lemkuil pithily stated, “You are wrong. Strike three.” Id.\n\n      On March 15, 2015, at 10:34 a.m., Lea non-suited the Original Enforcement.\n\n(Supp. CR 47).\n\n      That same day, at 2:09 p.m., Lea filed a Motion to Enforce Final Decree of\n\nDivorce and Agreement Incident to Divorce (the “New Enforcement”). (Supp. CR\n\n48). In her brief, Lea claims that she filed the New Enforcement after “having\n\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\fnarrowed the issues,” but Items 1 through 10 in the New Enforcement were\n\nidentical to the Original Enforcement. (Supp. CR 37).\n\n      On April 25, 2011, upon learning of the filing of the New Enforcement,\n\nFlowers agreed to accept service on Scott’s behalf, and inquired as to Lemkuil’s\n\nauthority for serving a precept in what amounted to a breach of contract case. (RE\n\n28). The record is void of any response from Lemkuil.\n\n      On April 27, 2011, Flowers, having accepted service of a precept, inquired\n\nas to the legal authority upon which Lemkuil relied. Lemkuil refused to discuss\n\nthe matter. (RE 29). At the conclusion of his April 27 letter, Flowers stated, “You\n\nare urged once again to immediately non-suit this bad faith claim so as to mitigate\n\nany further unnecessary expense to my client. It’s been very obvious since you\n\nfirst appeared in this matter that you have made no inquiry into these facts\n\nwhatsoever.” Id. The record is void of any response from Lemkuil.\n\n      Later in the day on April 27, 2011, Flowers sent a follow-up letter,\n\ncorrecting a misunderstanding about a hearing date. (RE 30). At the conclusion of\n\nthe second April 27 letter, Flowers gave a similar warning to Lemkuil. Id. The\n\nrecord is void of any response from Lemkuil.\n\n      On Sunday, May 1, 2011, Flowers sent another email to Lemkuil, which\n\nsays, in part, “You’ve failed to respond to my letters regarding the improvident\n\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\fmotion to enforce and the show cause order and precept you had issued.” (RE 31).\n\nThe record is void of any response from Lemkuil.\n\n      On June 21, 2011, Flowers’ office sent another letter, again addressing each\n\nof the items raised in the New Enforcement. (RE 32). The June 21 letter begins,\n\n“I have called your office several times to discuss closing this case. I have not\n\nheard back from you.      This is another effort at resolving this matter and to\n\nminimize the time and unnecessary expenses accruing in concluding this matter.”\n\nId. Moreover, the June 21 letter specifically addresses each of Items 1 through 10.\n\nId. Rather than recite the entire contents of the June 21 letter, a true and correct\n\ncopy has been attached hereto as Appendix 1.\n\n      After a few months, on August 18, 2011, Scott filed a Motion for Sanctions\n\nfor Bad Faith Filing, but Scott proceeded to trial on his Second Amended Motion\n\nfor Sanctions for Bad Faith Filing (“Sanctions Motion”).        (CR 3-8).     In the\n\nSanctions Motion, Scott sought recovery of his attorney’s fees, court costs, and\n\nlitigation expenses, jointly and severally from Lea and from Lemkuil. (Id.)\n\n      On September 7, 2011, Flowers sent yet another email to Lemkuil after Lea\n\nhad appeared, unannounced, at Flowers’ office. (RE 33). The letter concludes,\n\n“This is another amazing chapter of a ridiculously difficult case. There is no\n\nconceivable way this could be worth the time and money which has been and will\n\nbe spent.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\f      On May 25, 2012, Flowers sent “another attempt at settlement” to Lemkuil.\n\n(RE 37). (The letter dated May 25, 2012 is among the voluminous attachments to\n\nRE 37. For ease of reference and to save the Court’s time in reviewing exhibits, a\n\ntrue and correct copy of the letter is attached hereto as Appendix 2 and cited as\n\n“RE 37-A.”) In Flowers’ May 25 letter, he again tracks Items 1 through 10, states\n\nhis belief that each of the Items had been resolved, and offers to settle the matter.\n\n(RE 37-A)\n\n      On November 9, 2012, Lea filed a First Amended Motion to Enforce Final\n\nDecree of Divorce and Agreement Incident to Divorce (the “1st Amended\n\nEnforcement”), in which she restated the allegations contained in the Original\n\nEnforcement and the New Enforcement. (Supp. CR 58). Over the course of the\n\nlitigation, Lea filed five different versions of her enforcement pleading, amended\n\nher pleading four times, each time, either omitting causes of action that were\n\nclearly not valid OR not changing the allegations in the pleading – AT ALL.\n\n(Supp. CR 66, 71, 144)\n\n      On March 27, 2013, Lea filed her Fourth Amended Motion to Enforce Final\n\nDecree of Divorce and Agreement Incident to Divorce (“4th Amended\n\nEnforcement”), in which she abandoned all prior allegations, EXCEPT for the\n\nfollowing:\n\n             • The award of the diamond given by Patrick Brannan, and located\n               in a safe deposit box at Chase Bank, Medical Center location;\n\n                                         16\n\f               • The “fifty percent (50%) net of taxes of ANY bonuses or\n                 reimbursements received by Husband through April 30, 2010”; and\n\n               • A cause of action for conversion against Scott.\n(RE 55).\n\n         During trial, each side testified on their own behalf. In addition, Scott called\n\none fact witness to present evidence of some of the difficulties that had been\n\nencountered in transferring property to Lea. Given Lea’s sufficiency challenges\n\nand challenges to the findings of fact, it is important to review a summary of the\n\npertinent testimony adduced at trial.\n\n         Scott’s Testimony\n\n         During trial, Scott testified that at the beginning of the lawsuit, he\n\nrecognized that he was being sued over a list of “about 10 things,” initially. (RR\n\n6:68):\n\n         Item 1 (Diamond) – Scott testified that there was some confusion, at least in\n\nhis mind, about which diamond Lea had, which diamond was in question, and\n\nwhich diamond he was obligated to turn over to Lea. (RR 6:74). Scott said that he\n\nturned over both the “mine cut diamond” and the “Brandon (sic) diamond.” (RR\n\n5:129). He testified that he found one diamond in his safe, and – thinking it was\n\nthe Patrick Brannan Diamond –gave it to Lea. (RR 5:149). He later found a\n\nsecond diamond, and turned it over to Lea, too. (RR 5:150). He further testified\n\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\fthat each time Lea insisted that he had the Patrick Brannan Diamond, he looked for\n\nit, and was unable to find it. (RR 6:74)\n\n      Item 2 (Coins) – Scott testified that he did not have any of the coins\n\nreferenced in the AID.     (RR 5:133).      Flowers’ office confirmed as much to\n\nLemkuil in writing. (RE 32).\n\n      Item 3 (Oklahoma Property) – Scott testified that he was not given a deed to\n\nsign, transferring any interest in the Oklahoma property, but that when Lea finally\n\ndid send a deed, he “accepted it.” (RR 6:57-58) Correspondence from Flowers’\n\noffice informed Lea and Lemkuil of this fact. (RE 32)\n\n      Item 4 (Life Insurance Policy) – Scott testified that he did not recall any\n\ndocument pertaining to transfer of the First Colony Life Insurance policy to Lea\n\n(RR 5:159-160); however, Scott did sign an Assignment of Interest dated\n\nSeptember 8, 2010, and received from Allshouse, which purported to transfer the\n\npolicy to Lea. (RE 22).\n\n      Item 5 (Lincoln Investments) – Scott testified that he signed a document\n\ntransferring the Lincoln account to Lea. (RR 5:143).\n\n      Item 6 (Savings Bonds) – Scott testified that he signed documents\n\ntransferring the applicable savings bonds to Lea, around the time their divorce was\n\nfinalized. (RR 5:159; RE 20, 22). Scott further testified on cross-examination that\n\nhe executed transfer documents for the savings bonds awarded to Lea “every time\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\f[he] was asked to do it.” (RR 5:107). Correspondence from Flowers’ office\n\nconfirms Scott’s testimony. (RE 20, 22, 27, 32, 37-A). Although at one point\n\nduring the litigation, Lea claimed that all of the savings bonds were lost, in fact,\n\nLea had some in her possession, and Scott had none. (RR 6:22).\n\n      Item 7 (Lexus) – Scott maintained that he did not possess Lea’s Lexus keys.\n\n(RR 5:132). Correspondence from Flowers’ office informed Lea and Lemkuil of\n\nthis fact. (RE 32, 37-A).\n\n      Item 8 (Bonus & Reimbursement) – Scott testified that he recognized that he\n\nhad an obligation to pay Lea a portion of bonuses and reimbursement that he\n\nreceived by April 21, 2010. (RR 5:139). Scott further testified that he was paid a\n\nbonus for the first quarter 2010, but that he did not receive it until the end of April,\n\n2010 – after April 21. (RR 6:10). Scott presented a copy of his bonus check (RE\n\n7), identified the net amount of the bonus received, and testified that he paid Lea\n\none-half of that amount.      (RR 6:11-12).     Scott identified the cashier’s check\n\npayable to Lea for half of his first quarter 2010 bonus. (RE 9; RR 6:12). Finally,\n\nScott testified that while investigating whether he had paid the correct amount of\n\nbonus, he realized that on May 3, 2010, he received his “February draw check,”\n\nand gave a reason for the delay in payment. (RE 5 & 6; RR 6:14-17). Scott\n\nconfirmed this additional draw check was paid after the date the parties signed the\n\nAID. He further confirmed that Lea had never claimed any interest in this draw,\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\fbut that upon receipt, he tendered to Lea a cashier’s check for half. (RE 8; RR\n\n6:18-19).\n\n      Item 9 (Safe Deposit Boxes) – Although Scott did not testify regarding the\n\nexistence (or not) of a safety deposit box to which Lea was entitled, RE 32 and 37-\n\nA both state, “Scott doesn’t have a document listing the contents of the safe deposit\n\nboxes at BBVA Compass or Wells Fargo Bank as of September 3, 2010.”\n\n      Item 10 (Christmas Ornaments) – Scott testified that he made the Christmas\n\nornaments and other related personal property available for Lea, as required by the\n\nAID, and the items sat, boxed at his residence for 1.5 years, and then at Flowers’\n\noffice because Lea refused to retrieve them. (RR 5:111-112).\n\n      Lea’s Testimony\n\n      Lea, in response to the questions, “What inquiries did you make into\n\nwhether or not Mr. McLaurin had your things before you sued him about it?” and\n\n“You filed a lawsuit that preceded this one on the same issues, right, virtually?,”\n\nstated:\n\n                                 “I have no idea.”\n\n(RR 3:103 & 60, respectively). Lea further testified that she did not see any of her\n\npleadings prior to filing, and could not vouch for their contents because she had not\n\nread them. (RR 4:30). Lea testified that she was unaware of any of the efforts\n\nmade to settle the case (RR 4:32), but then – moments later – testified about a letter\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\fLemkuil had received (RE 37), and admitted that she was aware of settlement\n\nefforts. (RR 4:33).\n\n       Testifying over the course of 4 of the 5 days that the case was presented, Lea\n\nspoke at length about Items 1 through 10. Although Lea’s testimony was difficult\n\nto follow at times and she received several admonishments from the trial court\n\nconcerning her answers (See, e.g. RR 2:50, 2:55, 2:60, 2:68, 3:20, 3:25, 3:28, 3:31,\n\n3:39, 3:40, 3:42, 3:45, 3:57, 3:65, 3:101, 3:126, 3:1372, 4:16, 4:20, 4:36, 4:40,\n\n4:44, 4:46, 5:18, 5:21, and 5:45), her testimony may be summarized as follows:\n\n       Item 1 (Diamond) – Lea testified that she was awarded the Brannan\n\nDiamond in the AID. (RR 2:48). She testified that she received a diamond from\n\nScott following their divorce, but that it was not the Brannan Diamond. (RR 2:54).\n\nLea, later, testified that it was possible that she had received the Brannan Diamond.\n\n(RR 3:7). Later still, she testified that Scott had showed her the inside of his safe\n\ndeposit box, and that it contained 2 diamonds. (RR 3:117). Lea confirmed that she\n\nis not a jewelry collector; has no specialized knowledge of diamonds; and has no\n\nspecial training or knowledge to enable her to discern one diamond from another.\n\n(RR 3:119-120).         Lea further admitted that she was “unsure” whether the\n\ndescription of the Brannan Diamond contained in her pleading was accurate. (RR\n\n3:131). Finally, Flowers asked: “You’ve made these comparisons if it wasn’t the\n\n       2\n          The trial court admonished Lea, this time, by saying, “And ma’am, I’m telling you right\nnow, if I hear you ask one more question, I’m going to fine you. Do you understand that?”\n\n\n                                               21\n\fround cut diamond it’s the old mine cut diamond. You put it in your pleading.\n\nThat’s what I’m asking you about. I’m asking you what investigation research,\n\ninquiry, what sort of legwork, if you will, did you do to investigate that claim\n\nbefore you made it?” (RR 3:138). Lea’s response: “Nothing.” Id.\n\n       Item 2 (Coins) – In response to Flowers’ question “Did you ever send a\n\ndemand asking your husband -- former husband for coins and stamps out of the\n\nsafe deposit box?,” Lea stated, “I have no idea.” (RR 3:66). Moreover, despite\n\nher testimony that she and Scott do not communicate via email and that she only\n\n“occasionally” speaks to him on the telephone (RR 3:67), Lea testified that she\n\nasked him for the coins (and stamps) on more than one occasion before she filed\n\nthe New Enforcement, but could not recall when or how many times. (RR 3:66-\n\n67).\n\n       Item 3 (Oklahoma) – Lea testified that she had asked Scott to execute a\n\nQuitclaim deed to the Oklahoma property “several times,” but that he never signed\n\nit. (RR 2:56-57). On cross examination, however, she stated that she did present\n\nScott with a deed, but did bring a copy to trial because she did not know to. She\n\ntestified that she gave the deed to Scott directly, but that the document was also\n\nsent “by the attorney” to Scott and to Flowers’ office; and that she “had no idea”\n\nwhether anyone responded to the request. (RR 3:102-103). The record is void of\n\nany such document, and Lea abandoned the issue at trial. (RE 55).\n\n\n\n                                       22\n\f      Item 4 (Life Insurance) – Lea testified that she believed Scott was holding\n\nthe copy of the life insurance policy that she was awarded pursuant to the AID\n\nbecause “he’s mean” and for “revenge,” but had “no idea” whether he had\n\neconomic reasons for holding the policy. (RR 3:89) (emphasis added). She further\n\ntestified that prior to filing for divorce, , she had taken “some boxes” with “some”\n\nfinancial documents out of the house. (RR 3:92). Lea’s removal of financial\n\ndocuments would dove-tail with Scott’s assertion that he did not have the\n\ninsurance documents.\n\n      Item 5 (Lincoln) – Regarding the Lincoln Investments account, Lea testified\n\nthat: (i) she hired Allen Weiner, a third party, to assist with dividing the Lincoln\n\naccount (RR 3:81); (ii) she refused to sign documents that would have transferred\n\nher share of the Lincoln account to her (RR 3:78); (iii) she “had no idea” that the\n\nfunds could not be transferred to her without her providing account information\n\n(RR 3:85); (iv) she – finally – admitted that she did not provide an account into\n\nwhich her share could be transferred until August, 2012 (RR 3:85), (v) she was no\n\nlonger pursuing a claim against Scott related to the Lincoln account (RR 3:86), and\n\n(vi) she had “no idea” how much money Scott had spent on lawyers dealing with\n\nthat issue (RR 3:87).\n\n      Issue 6 (Bonds) – Lea admitted that she refused to sign documents that\n\nwould transfer her share of the savings bonds to her (RR 3:78), but she had also\n\n\n\n                                        23\n\falready received all of the savings bonds to which she believed she was entitled.\n\n(RR 3:14).\n\n      Issue 7 (Lexus) – Lea testified that, if she had sent a written demand for\n\nreturn of the key prior to filing suit, she did not bring a copy of that demand with\n\nher to court. (RR 3:66). When asked whether she received a letter from Flowers’\n\noffice, stating that Scott does not have the keys to the Lexus, Lea replied, “I have\n\nno idea.” (RR 3:65). Lea gave the same response to an inquiry as to the value of\n\nthe Lexus key for which she sued. (RR 3:66). Lea was, in fact, advised in writing\n\nthat Scott did not have her Lexus key. (RE 32, 37-A).\n\n      Issue 8 (Bonus & Reimbursement) – During cross-examination, the\n\nfollowing exchange occurred:\n\n             Q:          (By Mr. Flowers) In that first paragraph [of page 3 of the\n                         4th Amended Enforcement], just for clarity, I’ll read it\n                         and you tell me if I read it correctly. ‘The bonuses and\n                         reimbursements referenced in the Agreement Incident to\n                         Divorce include all bonuses or reimbursements earned or\n                         received net of taxes only from February 1, 2009 through\n                         April 30th, 2010 in an amount not less than $8,526.31 nor\n                         more than $75,310.89 prior to interest on the IMED pay,\n                         together with other bonuses and reimbursement claims as\n                         expressed below for an additional pre-interest claim of\n                         $31,618.95.’\n                         Did I read that correctly?\n             A:          Umm, okay.\n             Q:          Did I read it correctly?\n             A:          Yes.\n                                        *    *      *\n\n\n                                        24\n\f            Q:           (By Mr. Flowers) Can you please tell the Court what in\n                         the world that means?\n            A:           That he has agreed to pay me 50 percent net of taxes of\n                         any bonus or reimbursement.\n            Q:           Where did you get the number $8,526.31?

Bad question. Let\n                         me start with IMED pay. Prior to interest on the IMED\n                         pay, what is the interest on the IMED pay?\n            A:           I’m not sure.\n\n(RR 4:19-21).\n\n      Ultimately, Lea was unable to testify as to an exact amount of money that\n\nshe was seeking or as to how any amount was calculated. (RR 4:26). At first, she\n\nindicated that she needed additional paperwork, but could not identify any\n\ndocument that had not been produced (RR 4:27), and admitted that she had not\n\nasked the trial court to order production of documents. (RR 4:28).\n\n      The following day, Lea testified that she was “not sure” whether she had\n\never itemized her reimbursement claim for Scott (RR 5:71) or had ever sent the list\n\nof expenses (RR 5:72-73). Lea “believed” the total amount owed to her was\n\n$98,000 (RR 5:73), but was unable to offer any basis for the amount of the claim.\n\n(RR 5:75-76).\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\f      Issue 9 (Safe Deposit Boxes) – Lea testified that, pursuant to the AID, she\n\nwas to receive the contents of two safe deposit boxes, one at BBVA Compass, and\n\none at Wells Fargo. (RR 2:70). She maintained she received the entire contents of\n\nthe Wells Fargo box, but was abandoning the claim. (RR 2:70-71). The record is\n\nvoid of any accounting of items from the Wells Fargo safe deposit box to which\n\nLea claimed she was entitled.\n\n      Issue 10 (Christmas Ornaments) – Lea testified that she (i) requested the\n\nChristmas ornaments from Scott by sending him typewritten letters, (ii) “may or\n\nmay not” have copies of the letters, (iii) did not bring any such letters to court (RR\n\n3:56), and (iv) could not remember the time frame of sending the letters.\n\n(RR3:58). Although Lea testified that she believed she did not receive all of her\n\nChristmas things, she did not ask the trial court to make any orders concerning\n\nthem (RR 3:14), and the record is void of any reference to any specific item still\n\noutstanding.\n\n      Ross McLaurin\n\n      Scott called Ross McLaurin, his brother. Ross is employed with Lincoln\n\nInvestments, and acted as the parties’ investment advisor both before and during\n\nthe parties’ marriage. (RR 4:71-72). During the time that Ross managed the\n\nparties’ money, Lea never complained about fees, did not question Ross’ honesty,\n\nand did not write complaint letters to Lincoln. (RR 4:122). After the parties’\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\fdivorce, Ross was to divide the accounts in conformity with the mediated\n\nsettlement agreement. (RR 4:75). A brokerage account and a retirement account\n\nwere to be divided. (RR 4:76). The retirement account called for a specific\n\namount to go to Lea, but in the brokerage account, he “took a pro-rata share of\n\neach investment and each accounting that’s shared and divided it to each party.”\n\n(RR 4:75-76). In arriving at the division, Ross “…was trying to be as impartial as\n\n[he] could to give each person the equal share, after tax benefit, of the assets.” (RR\n\n4:100).\n\n      Ross testified that in order to initiate a transfer to Lea, she needed to provide\n\nthe account into which she wanted her shares placed, and that he had difficulty in\n\nobtaining that information from Lea. (RR 4:75-76). Ross made effort to obtain the\n\ninformation from Lea directly and from Mr. Weiner. (RR 4:78).\n\n      Ross calculated the division of the account in September, 2010. (RR 4:90).\n\nHe discussed those calculations with Mr. Weiner in mid-November, 2010. (RR\n\n4:79). Ross segregated Scott’s portion of the account into a separate account on\n\nDecember 21, 2010. (RR 4:90). In early January, Ross also removed Scott’s share\n\nof dividends that were paid into the account. (RR 4:91). The interest, dividends,\n\ngains, and losses on Lea’s portion of the account remained with Lea. (RR 4:111).\n\n      In speaking with Mr. Weiner in mid-November, 2010, Ross explained the\n\nmethod by which the account was divided, and Mr. Weiner voiced no objection.\n\n\n\n                                         27\n\f(RR 4:79). Lea did not send any letters to Lincoln Investments, objecting to Ross’\n\ndivision of the account or his management of it. (RR 4:99) Even after Ross and\n\nMr. Weiner reviewed a “spreadsheet with all of the details,” neither of them were\n\nable to get Lea to designate an account for the transfer or sign paperwork necessary\n\nto effect transfer of the Lincoln Investments account. (RR 4:79-80).\n\n      Nearly two years later, Ross received a Brokerage and Client Account\n\nTransfer Form, signed by Lea and dated August 22, 2012, that finally designated\n\nthe account into which Lea wanted her assets transferred.          (RR 4:81).    Ross\n\ntestified that Scott signed the document within less than a week following receipt,\n\nand the assets eventually were transferred to Lea. (RR 4:82-83).\n\n      Ross testified that at the end of 2012, when Lea attempted to transfer the\n\nassets, she did not include all of the paperwork necessary to effectuate the transfer,\n\nso “…[he] provided additional documentation to make the transfer occur, including\n\na letter from Scott, which he signed immediately, to expedite the transfer and make\n\nit happen.” (RR 4:85). The transfer was completed on January 4, 2013, but the\n\ndelay was not a result of anything that Scott did. Id. Moreover, Ross testified that\n\nhe asked Lemkuil for assistance in expediting the transfer of Lea’s assets, and that\n\nLemkuil told him he would not assist. (RR 4:86-87).\n\n\n\n\n                                         28\n\f      Despite any whatever complaints she may have had, Lea still asked Ross to\n\ntransfer the assets to her Vanguard account (RR 4:125), and had dropped Lincoln\n\nInvestments complaint by the time of trial. (RR 4:126-127).\n\n      Flowers Testimony\n\n      Testifying as an expert on the issue of attorney’s fees, Flowers first received\n\nnotice of Lea’s enforcement action before any attempt at service via an email he\n\nreceived from the district clerk’s office.    (RR 6:119).     Almost immediately,\n\nFlowers reached out to Lemkuil in an effort to resolve the matter. When Flowers\n\ninitially inquired as to whether Lemkuil had reviewed the file, Lemkuil responded,\n\n“why would he review the file, this is a new case.” (RR 6:120). From that point,\n\nFlowers began to investigate the case himself, and realized that the breach of\n\ncontract matter had been improperly filed as a contempt case, with the issuance of\n\na precept (rather than citation). Id. Ultimately, that issue was resolved, but before\n\nFlowers filed a motion and prevailed at the hearing. (RR 6:121).\n\n      In addition to attending to the matter of the improperly issued precept,\n\nFlowers continued his efforts to resolve the case. (RR 6:122; see e.g. RE 32, 37-\n\nA). Flowers discovered that no effort had been made by Lemkuil or Lea to make\n\ninquiry into the claims asserted prior to filing either lawsuit. Id. As early as\n\nFebruary, 2011, Flowers informed Lemkuil of his belief that no investigation had\n\nbeen made. (RR 6:133-134).\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\f      Lea (through Lemkuil) served written discovery to which Scott (through\n\nFlowers) had to respond (RR 6:122). Lea (through Lemkuil) noticed several\n\ndepositions which Flowers attended. (RR 6:124). There were several discovery\n\ndisputes, each of which required a discovery hearing before Judge David Farr,\n\n312th Judicial District Court. Id. In November, 2011, everyone realized that Judge\n\nFarr had previously mediated the parties’ temporary orders during a time when he\n\nwas not on the bench, so the matter was assigned to the 309th. Id. All of these\n\nancillary matters consumed substantial time and effort from Flowers and his staff.\n\n      In addition to the several court appearances and trial resets that occurred\n\n(RR 6:125), it proved necessary for Flowers to spend an extraordinary amount of\n\ntime trying to “sort out the very nebulous claims that had been made.” Id. Flowers\n\ntestified that “…up to this moment we didn’t know what the claims were. It’s been\n\ndifficult. It was very difficult to sort through that…a lot of attorney time to sort\n\nthrough these various things to figure out what it was she claimed was missing.”\n\n(RR 6:125-126).\n\n      Flowers testified that the total amount invoiced by his firm was $68,844.25\n\nbased upon three invoices, which were collectively admitted into evidence. (RR\n\n6:126; RE 36). Flowers further testified to an additional amount of $25,000.00,\n\nwhich were the attorney’s fees Scott incurred through the trial of the case. (RR\n\n6:127).\n\n\n\n                                        30\n\f      Trial Court Ruling\n\n      At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court took the matter under\n\nadvisement. (RR 6:148). On March 3, 2014, the trial court rendered its ruling, and\n\non April 8, 2014, the trial court entered its Final Judgment on Lea Percy\n\nMcLaurin’s Motion to Enforce and Scott Sutton McLaurin’s Motion for Sanctions\n\nand Bad Faith Filing (the “Sanctions Judgment”). (CR 12).\n\n      The Sanctions Judgment denied Lea the relief she sought (CR 13), granted\n\nthe Sanctions Motion (CR 13-15), and ordered sanctions, stating, in pertinent part:\n\n                The Court having considered the pleadings,\n                evidence, and arguments of counsel finds that the\n                allegations    contained      in    LEA   PERCY\n                                  th\n                McLAURIN’s 4 Amended Motion to Enforce\n                Final Decree of Divorce and Agreement Incident\n                to Divorce are generally false, groundless and\n                brought in bad faith. The lawyer filing these\n                pleadings failed to make reasonable inquiry before\n                filing said groundless and bad faith pleadings.\n                Rule 13, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. The\n                Court makes the following findings in support of\n                this final judgment for sanctions, to wit\n\n                                     *   *    *\n\n                The attorney who filed these pleadings failed to\n                make the reasonable inquiry required prior to filing\n                the suit. Further, after these fact were brought to\n                the attention of the attorney during a meeting with\n                the undersigned, he continued to refuse to dismiss\n                this frivolous suit.\n\n                The Court having considered the pleadings,\n                evidence and argument of counsel GRANTS the\n\n                                         31\n\f                Motion for Sanctions for Bad Faith Filing filed by\n                SCOTT SUTTON MCLAURIN. It is therefore,\n\n                ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that\n                SCOTT SUTTON MCLAURIN is hereby granted\n                a judgment against LEA PERCY MCLAURIN as\n                reimbursement for attorney’s fees incurred and\n                paid in this case in the amount of Fifty Two\n                Thousand Three Hundred Seventy Eight and\n                88/100 Dollars ($52,378.88).        It is further\n                ORDERED that all Lea PERCY MCLAURIN\n                shall pay to SCOTT SUTTON MCLAURIN the\n                judgment amount of $52,378.88 by cash, cashier’s\n                check or money order on or before June 12, 2014\n                at or before 3:00 PM, by delivering cash, cashier’s\n                check or a money order in said amount payable to\n                SCOTT SUTTON MCLAURIN at the law offices\n                of Flowers & Frankfort, attention Richard L.\n                Flowers, Jr., 5020 Montrose Blvd., Suite 700,\n                Houston, Texas.\n\n(CR 13-15).\n\n      Lea timely appealed the Sanctions Judgment (CR 62), but has neither\n\nsuperseded nor paid the amount of the judgment.\n\n      Given the evidence presented at trial, the trial court was well within its\n\ndiscretion to: (i) issue the Sanctions Order, (ii) to include a date and time certain by\n\nwhich Lea was to comply with the sanctions issued, and (iii) to deny Lea the relief\n\nshe sought.\n\n      The Sanctions Order should be AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          32\n\f                   Summary of the Argument\n\n  I.

LEA’S SUIT WAS FRIVOLOUS AND BROUGHT IN BAD\n           FAITH, SO SANCTIONS WERE PROPER (APPELLANT\n           ISSUE I. A. & B.)3\n\n           A. STANDARD OF REVIEW & REQUIREMENTS FOR SANCTIONS\n\n       Standard of Review\n\n       A court’s imposition of a sanction order under is to be reviewed for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d 609, 614 (Tex. 2007); see also GTE\n\nCommunications Sys. Corp. v. Tanner, 856 S.W.2d 725, 730 (Tex. 1993) (applying\n\nabuse of discretion standard for review of Rule 13 sanctions). The trial court’s\n\nruling should only be reversed upon a showing that the trial court “acted without\n\nreference to any guiding rules and principals, such that its ruling was arbitrary or\n\nunreasonable.” Id.; Cire v. Cummings, 134 S.W.3d 835, 838 (Tex. 2004). “The\n\ntrial court does not abuse its discretion if it bases its decision on conflicting\n\nevidence and some evidence supports its decision.” Unifund CCR Partners v.\n\nVilla, 299 S.W.3d 92, 97 (Tex. 2009) (citing In re Barber, 982 S.W.2d 364, 366\n\n(Tex. 1998)).\n\n       In conducting its review, the appellate court “must indulge every legal\n\npresumption in favor of the trial court’s ruling and view the evidence in the light\n\n\n       3\n         To avoid confusion, the issue raised by Appellant’s Brief is listed (in parentheses) to\nwhich the indicated heading is responsive.\n\n\n                                                34\n\fmost favorable to the trial court’s ruling.” Hatteberg v. Hatteberg, 933 S.W.2d\n\n522, 526 (Tex. App. 1994, no writ). A mere error in judgment by the trial court\n\ndoes not constitute an abuse of discretion. Bradt v. Sebek, 14 S.W.3d 756, 761\n\n(Tex. App. – Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, pet. denied). The Supreme Court of Texas\n\n“…will not hold that a trial court abused its discretion in levying sanctions if some\n\nevidence supports its decision.” Nath v. Texas Children’s Hosp., 446 S.W.3d 355,\n\n361 (Tex. 2014).\n\n      Moreover, “[t]he mere fact that a trial judge may decide a matter within his\n\ndiscretionary authority in a different manner than an appellate judge in a similar\n\ncircumstance does not demonstrate that an abuse of discretion has occurred.”\n\nDowner v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 242 (Tex. 1985). The\n\nappellate court should “…make an independent inquiry of the entire record to\n\ndetermine whether the trial court abused its discretion in imposing the particular\n\nsanctions.” Westergren v. Jennings, 441 S.W.3d 670, 677 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.) No abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court decision is\n\nbased upon conflicting evidence where some evidence supports the decision.\n\nBarber, 982 S.W.2d at 366. (Tex. 1998).\n\n      Importantly, “[t]he degree of discretion afforded the trial court is…greater\n\nwhen sanctions are imposed for groundless pleadings than when imposed for\n\n\n\n\n                                          35\n\fdiscovery abuse.” Falk & Mayfield L.L.P. v. Molzan, 974 S.W.2d 821, 827 (Tex.\n\nApp. – Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, writ denied).\n\n      Rule 13\n\n      “Courts impose sanctions against parties filing frivolous claims to deter\n\nsimilar conduct in the future and to compensate the aggrieved party by reimbursing\n\nthe costs incurred in responding to baseless pleadings.” Scott & White Mem'l\n\nHosp. v. Schexnider, 940 S.W.2d 594, 596-97 (Tex. 1996). Rule 13 of the Texas\n\nRules of Civil Procedure provides, in relevant part, the following:\n\n                   The signatures of attorneys or parties constitute a\n                   certificate by them that they have read the\n                   pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of\n                   their knowledge, information, and belief formed\n                   after reasonable inquiry the instrument is not\n                   groundless and brought in bad faith or groundless\n                   and brought for the purpose of harassment... If a\n                   pleading, motion or other paper is signed in\n                   violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or\n                   upon its own initiative, after notice and hearing,\n                   shall impose an appropriate sanction available\n                   under Rule 215-2b, upon the person who signed it,\n                   a represented party, or both.\n\nTex. R. Civ. P. 13. As used in Rule 13, the term “groundless” means that the suit\n\n“had no basis in law or fact and [was] not warranted by good faith argument for the\n\nextension, modification, or reversal of existing law.”         Id.    In making its\n\ndetermination of whether a pleading was groundless, the trial court should use the\n\nobjective standard of whether the party and her counsel made a reasonable inquiry\n\n\n\n                                         36\n\finto the legal and factual basis of the claim, looking “to the facts available to the\n\nlitigant and circumstances at the time the suit was filed.” Harrison v. Harrison,\n\n363 S.W.3d 859, 863 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, no pet.).               In\n\naddition, the trial court may consider the entire history of the case. Greene v.\n\nYoung, 174 S.W.3d 291, 301 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, pet. denied).\n\n      In addition to showing that the offending pleading is groundless, the party\n\nseeking sanctions must further demonstrate that it was brought in bad faith. Tex.\n\nR. Civ. P. 13. “A party acts in bad faith when discovery puts him on notice that his\n\nunderstanding of the facts may be incorrect, and he does not make reasonable\n\ninquiry into the facts before filing the pleading.” Elkins v. Stotts-Brown, 103\n\nS.W.3d 664, 668-69 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2003, no pet.) In other words, sanctions\n\nmay be imposed “…for a party’s or his counsel’s failure to inquire into the facts\n\nafter he is on notice the facts are not what he believes.” Monroe v. Grider, 884\n\nS.W.2d 811, 817 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1994), writ denied (citing Robinson v.\n\nNational Cash Register Co., 808 F.2d 1119, 1131 (5th Cir.1987), overruled on\n\nother grounds, 836 F.2d 866 (5th Cir.1988)).\n\n      In this case, Lemkuil was notified that his understanding of the facts may be\n\nincorrect as early as January, 2011, but he did not make further inquiry into the\n\nfacts. (RE 24, 25, 26, 27,) Instead, he filed the New Enforcement. (Supp. CR 48\n\n& ___). Lemkuil’s investigation of Lea’s claims was minimal at best, but was\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\fcertainly not adequate. At trial, Lea ended up abandoning all but 2 of the initial\n\nItems 1 through 10 (RE 55), but not before Scott had to endure years of litigation\n\nin disproving Lea’s nebulous claims. Lea admitted that she did “nothing” to\n\ninvestigate her claims related to the Brannan Diamond (RR 3:138), and could not\n\nsubstantiate any of the $98,000 bonus/reimbursement claim. (RR 5:73-75).\n\n       The trial court properly granted sanctions because – examining the facts at\n\nthe time the New Enforcement was filed and considering the entire history of the\n\ncase, Lea’s pleading was groundless and, after she (or her lawyer) learned that the\n\nfacts may not what she believed, no reasonable inquiry was made. The trial court’s\n\njudgment should be affirmed.\n\n       Chapter 10 – Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\n       Similar to Rule 13, Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code\n\nprovides further relief for litigants, stating:\n\n                 The signing of a pleading or motion as required by the\n                 Texas Rules of Civil Procedure constitutes a\n                 certificate by the signatory that to the signatory's best\n                 knowledge, information, and belief, formed after\n                 reasonable inquiry:\n\n                 (1) the pleading or motion is not being presented for\n                 any improper purpose, including to harass or to cause\n                 unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of\n                 litigation;\n\n                 (2) each claim, defense, or other legal contention in\n                 the pleading or motion is warranted by existing law or\n                 by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,\n\n                                            38\n\f                modification, or reversal of existing law or the\n                establishment of new law;\n\n                (3) each allegation or other factual contention in the\n                pleading or motion has evidentiary support or, for a\n                specifically identified allegation or factual contention,\n                is likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable\n                opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and\n\n                (4) each denial in the pleading or motion of a factual\n                contention is warranted on the evidence or, for a\n                specifically identified denial, is reasonably based on a\n                lack of information or belief.\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 10.001 (Vernon).\n\n      In other words, “[s]anctions under chapter 10 of the Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code are authorized if the evidence establishes that (1) a pleading or\n\nmotion was brought for an improper purpose, (2) there were no grounds for legal\n\narguments advanced, or (3) a factual allegation or denial lacked evidentiary\n\nsupport.” Mattox v. Grimes County Com'rs Court, 305 S.W.3d 375, 386 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, pet. denied). When a court determines that a\n\nlitigant has filed a pleading in violation of Sec. 10.001, it may impose a sanction,\n\nwhich may include “an order to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable\n\nexpenses incurred by the other party because of the filing of the pleading or\n\nmotion, including reasonable attorney’s fees.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann.\n\n§ 10.004 (Vernon). Furthermore, “[t]he court may award to a party prevailing on a\n\nmotion under this section the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred in\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\fpresenting or opposing the motion, and if no due diligence is shown the court may\n\naward to the prevailing party all costs for inconvenience, harassment, and out-of-\n\npocket expenses incurred or caused by the subject litigation.” Tex. Civ. Prac. &\n\nRem. Code Ann. § 10.002 (Vernon).\n\n         B.   LEA  DID NOT MAKE THE APPROPRIATE INQUIRY BEFORE\n              FILING THE NEW ENFORCEMENT, SO TRIAL COURT WAS\n              WITHIN ITS DISCRETION TO ORDER SANCTIONS AGAINST HER.\n\n      To support the Sanctions Motion, Scott needed competent proof that (1) a\n\nreasonable inquiry into Lea’s allegations would have disclosed that not all the\n\nallegations pled had or would likely have evidentiary support, and (2) Lea did not\n\nmake a reasonable inquiry before filing suit. Unifund, 299 S.W.3d at 97 (Tex.\n\n2009) (citing Low, 221 S.W.3d at 617 (Tex. 2007))..\n\n      Flowers notified Lemkuil that Lea’s claims were frivolous in January, 2011\n\n(RE 24), at least twice in February, 2011 (RR 6:133; RE 27), at least twice in\n\nApril, 2011 (RE 29 & 30), and at least once in May, 2011 (RE 31). In June, 2011,\n\nFlowers’ office sent Lemkuil a detailed letter, specifically addressing Items 1\n\nthrough 10.    (RE 32).     The record is void of any evidence of Lemkuil’s\n\ninvestigation of Lea’s claims following his receipt of any of these notifications\n\n(especially after Flowers’ June, 2011 letter); instead, Lemkuil proceeded with\n\nserving written discovery and noticing depositions, causing Scott’s prolonged\n\ninvolvement in frivolous litigation – at great expense. (RR 6:122, 124, 125).\n\n\n\n                                        40\n\f      Lea has taken the position that her amending her pleadings to eliminate moot\n\nissues renders the Sanctions Order improper because it is based, in part, on the\n\neliminated allegations, a situation similar to that presented in Scott & White\n\nMemorial Hospital v. Schexnider. In Scott & White, the plaintiffs filed suit against\n\nsome 33 defendants in a medical malpractice suit. Scott & White, 940 S.W.2d at\n\n595 (Tex. 1996). All 33 defendants, filed a motion for summary judgment, but\n\nbefore the trial court could rule, plaintiffs nonsuited all but two defendants by\n\nomitting them from an amended pleading. Id. The trial court ended up granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the remaining defendants, after which all\n\ndefendants moved for sanctions pursuant to Rule 13, which the trial court granted.\n\nId. The Austin Court of Appeals overruled the sanctions order. Id. In overturning\n\nthe court of appeals, the Supreme Court of Texas followed the United States\n\nSupreme Court holding interpreting Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (prior to\n\nthat rule’s amendment to allow a “safe-harbor”):\n\n                   Baseless filing puts the machinery of justice\n                   in motion, burdening courts and individuals\n                   alike with needless expense and delay. Even\n                   if the careless litigant quickly dismisses the\n                   action, the harm triggering Rule 11’s\n                   concerns has already occurred. Therefore, a\n                   litigant who violates Rule 11 merits\n                   sanctions even after a dismissal. Moreover,\n                   the imposition of such sanctions on abusive\n                   litigants is useful to deter such misconduct.\n                   If a litigant could purge his violation of Rule\n                   11 merely by taking a dismissal, he would\n\n                                         41\n\f                   lose all incentive to “stop, think and\n                   investigate more carefully before serving\n                   and filing papers.\n\nId. at 597 (quoting Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 398, 110 S.Ct.\n\n2447, 2457, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990) (citation omitted); see also Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n11).\n\n       Similarly, Lea should not be permitted to escape sanctions for her frivolous\n\nclaims on the basis that she eliminated those claims along the way. Lea did not\n\nconduct any investigation of her claims prior to filing suit, and had she done so, the\n\nensuing two and a half years of litigation would probably not have occurred. The\n\nSanctions Order should be affirmed.\n\n          C. THE SANCTIONS ORDERED BY THE TRIAL COURT ARE “JUST,”\n             AND SHOULD BE UPHELD.\n\n       In considering whether sanctions ordered by a trial court comport with due\n\nprocess, the Supreme Court of Texas, in TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp. v.\n\nPowell, adopted a two prong test. See Nath, 446 S.W.3d at 363 (Tex. 2014).\n\n“First, a direct relationship must exist between the offensive conduct and the\n\nsanction imposed. This means that that a just sanction must be directed against the\n\nabuse and toward remedying the prejudice caused the innocent party.”\n\nTransAmerican Natural Gas Corp. v. Powell, 811 S.W.2d 913, 917 (Tex. 2002).\n\n“Second, just sanctions must not be excessive. The punishment should fit the\n\ncrime.” Id.\n\n                                         42\n\fIn this case, the trial court heard the following evidence:\n\n          • Scott was in the process of executing\n            documents to effectuate the transfer of Lea’s\n            property almost immediately following their\n            divorce. (RR 5:154, 6:26).\n\n          • Without warning or investigation, Lea filed\n            a contempt action in an effort to enforce the\n            AID, a contract. (Supp. CR 37; RR 6:119-\n            120).\n\n          • When Flowers attempted to resolve the\n            matter before protracted litigation occurred,\n            it became apparent that no investigation had\n            occurred. (RR 6:120).\n\n          • After Flowers informed Lemkuil that the\n            facts may not be as Lemkuil understood,\n            Lemkuil     non-suited       the     Original\n            Enforcement    and      filed    the    New\n            Enforcement, a virtually identical pleading.\n            (RE 27; Supp CR 47 & 48)\n\n          • Substantial attorney and staff time was\n            devoted to responding to discovery and\n            attempting to figure out what property Lea\n            claimed she did not receive. (RR 6:125-\n            126).\n\n          • Lea conducted several depositions of\n            witnesses (RR 6:124), but the record does\n            not reflect that any of them were used at\n            trial.\n\n          • By trial, Lea had abandoned all but two of\n            the claims related to Items 1 through 10:\n            issues related to the Brannan Diamond and\n            bonus/reimbursements. (RE 55).\n\n\n                                   43\n\f               • Lea did “nothing” to investigate her claims\n                 related to the Brannan Diamond before\n                 filing suit. (RR 3:138).\n\n               • Lea has no special training or knowledge to\n                 enable her to discern one diamond from\n                 another (RR 3:119-120), and it was possible\n                 that she had received the Brannan Diamond.\n                 (RR 3:7).\n\n               • On April 30, 2010, Scott received a bonus\n                 for the first quarter of 2010 in the net\n                 amount of $12,955.27 (RE 7), and prior to\n                 her filing the Original Enforcement or the\n                 New Enforcement, he paid Lea the sum of\n                 $6,877.63, by cashier’s check. (RE 9).\n\n               • Lea was “not sure” how the damages related\n                 to bonus/reimbursement contained in her\n                 pleading were calculated. (RR 4:19-21).\n\n               • In defending against the frivolous suit(s) Lea\n                 filed, Scott incurred attorney’s fees and\n                 expenses in the amount of $68,844.25 (RE\n                 36; RR 6:126), plus an additional\n                 $25,000.00 incurred through the trial of the\n                 case (RR 6:127).\n\n      Scott incurred $93,844.25 in attorney’s fees, and asked the trial court to\n\nsanction Lea in that amount. (RR 6:127). After considering the evidence, the trial\n\ncourt sanctioned Lea in the amount of $52,378.88 (CR 29), an amount that is over\n\n$41,000 less than the amount Scott requested.\n\n\n\n\n                                       44\n\f      A sanction “…should be no more severe than necessary to satisfy its\n\nlegitimate purposes.” Nath, 446 S.W.3d at 363 (Tex. 2014). Two legitimate\n\npurposes of sanctions against frivolous claimants are the deterrence of similar\n\nconduct in the future, and the compensation of the aggrieved party by reimbursing\n\nthe costs incurred in responding to baseless pleadings. Scott & White, 940 S.W.2d\n\nat 597 (Tex. 1996).\n\n      Here, Lea, through her abusive litigation and her failure to “stop, think and\n\ninvestigate more carefully before serving and filing papers,” caused Scott to incur\n\nnearly $100,000.00 in attorney’s fees and expense related to his defense. Cooter &\n\nGell, 496 U.S. at 398, 110 S.Ct. at 2457, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990). Moreover, in\n\nissuing sanctions, the trial court may consider the entire history of the case.\n\nGreene, 174 S.W.3d at 301 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, pet. denied).\n\n      The trial court made specific findings related to certain of Items 1 through\n\n10, considered the pleadings and evidence presented (including the entire case\n\nhistory), and, based upon such evidence and findings, “therefore” ordered\n\nsanctions against Lea. (CR 13-15).\n\n      The sanctions ordered by the trial court were directly related to Lea’s and\n\nLemkuil’s conduct, were directed against the abuse and towards remedying the\n\nprejudice caused to Scott, and were not excessive; therefore, the Sanctions Order\n\nshould be affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                        45\n\f    II.   LEA DID NOT PRESERVE ERROR CONCERNING THE\n          SANCTIONS ORDER, AND THE SANCTIONS ORDER\n          PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR SANCTIONS. (APPELLANT\n          ISSUE I. D.)\n\n          A. LEA’S FAILURE TO PRESERVE ANY PERCEIVED ERROR IN THE\n             SANCTIONS ORDER RESULTS IN HER WAIVING COMPLAINTS ON\n             APPEAL.\n\n      It is well established – since the beginning of Texas jurisprudence – that\n\n“…to preserve a complaint for appellate review, a party must present to the trial\n\ncourt a timely request objection or motion, state the specific grounds therefor, and\n\nobtain a ruling.” Bushell v. Dean, 803 S.W.2d 711, 712 (Tex. 1991) (op. on reh’g);\n\nLewis v. Texas Emp. Ins. Ass'n, 151 Tex. 95, 97-98, 246 S.W.2d 599, 600 (1952);\n\nsee also O'Connor v. Towns, 1 Tex. 107 (1846); Tex. R. App. P. 33.1. It follows\n\nthat an appellant must object to a lack of particularity of a sanctions order in the\n\ntrial court before it may raise the complaint on appeal. Alexander v. Alexander,\n\n956 S.W.2d 712, 714 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1997, pet. denied); accord\n\nSMB Partners, Ltd. v. Wightman, 01-99-00217-CV, 1999 WL 994057, at *1-2\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Oct. 28, 1999, no pet.) (not designated for\n\npublication).\n\n      In the instant case, the record is devoid of any objection by Lea to the lack of\n\nspecificity of the Sanctions Order, about which she now complains. Lea’s point of\n\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\ferror relating to the specificity of the Sanctions Order, accordingly, should be\n\noverruled. Alexander, 956 S.W.2d at 714.\n\n\n\n\n                                      47\n\f          B. EVEN IF LEA HAD PRESERVED ERROR, IT IS HARMLESS ERROR,\n             SO THE SANCTIONS ORDER SHOULD BE AFFIRMED.\n\n      “A Rule 13 sanction order must be supported by specific allegations of good\n\ncause,” and the failure to do so may be an abuse of discretion. Gaspard v. Beadle,\n\n36 S.W.3d 229, 239 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, pet. denied). Such a\n\nfailure may be harmless error if a trial court’s findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw provide the particulars of good cause. Id. The Corpus Christi Court of\n\nAppeals has concluded that error by the trial court in failing to state the particulars\n\nof good cause may be harmless based upon whether the trial court “…did not so\n\n‘obscure its reasoning’ as to prevent…being able to present [the] issue on appeal.”\n\nRudisell v. Paquette, 89 S.W.3d 233, 238 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002, no\n\npet.) (citations omitted); see also, Tex. R. App. P. 44.1.\n\n      In the instant case, the trial court made specific findings in the Sanctions\n\nOrder concerning Item 1 (diamond), Item 2 (coins), Item 3 (Oklahoma property),\n\nItem 5 (Lincoln Investment account), Item 6 (savings bonds), and Item 10\n\n(Christmas ornaments, etc.). (CR 28-29). In addition, the trial court’s Findings of\n\nFact and Conclusions of Law (collectively, the “Findings of Fact”) made specific\n\nfindings regarding each of the items addressed in the Sanctions Order. (CR 34-38).\n\nOn the final page of the Findings of Fact, the trial court judge interlineated on the\n\ntypewritten document, which concluded, “After the facts surrounding Lea’s, by\n\n                                          48\n\fand through her attorney of record, failure to make reasonable inquiry were\n\nbrought to their attention in a meeting with Scott’s attorney of record, he continued\n\nto pursue a trial regarding Lea’s allegations.” (CR 38)\n\n      Even if Lea had not waived her objection to the Sanctions Order’s lack of\n\nparticularity, the Sanctions Order and the Findings of Fact contain sufficient\n\nparticularity such that the trial court did not obscure its reasoning to the extent that\n\nLea was prevented from being able to present the issue for appeal. (See CR 13-15,\n\n34-38). Moreover, the findings contained in the Sanctions Order and the Findings\n\nof Fact give sufficient evidence that the sanctions ordered by the trial court\n\n“…were carefully weighed and imposed in an appropriate manner when justified\n\nby the circumstances.” Keith v. Keith, 221 S.W.3d 156, 165 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 2006, no pet.).\n\n      The Sanctions Order should be affirmed.\n\n   III.   THE TRIAL COURT WAS WITHIN ITS DISCRETION TO\n          IMPOSE A DATE AND TIME CERTAIN FOR APPELLANT\n          TO PAY THE SANCTIONS ORDERED. (APPELLANT ISSUE\n          II.)\n\n          A. LEA DID NOT SUPERSEDE THE SANCTION ORDER WHILE ON\n             APPEAL, AS PERMITTED UNDER TEXAS LAW.\n\n      Texas Courts have an affirmative duty to enforce their judgments. In re\n\nCrow-Billingsley Air Park, Ltd., 98 S.W.3d 178, 179 (Tex. 2003); Tex. R. Civ. P.\n\n308. Lea has taken the position that her having appealed the Sanctions Order\n\n                                          49\n\fshould – in effect – abate the trial court’s ability to enforce it; however, the\n\nSupreme Court of Texas and the other appellate courts have held otherwise. Id.\n\n(“Our procedural rules allow a judgment debtor to supersede a judgment, thereby\n\nsuspending enforcement, by posting security set by the trial court, not by merely\n\nfiling an appeal.”); Byrnes v. Ketterman, 440 S.W.3d 688, 690 (Tex. App.—El\n\nPaso 2013, no pet.) (holding that the losing party “has a choice to either submit to\n\nthe judgment or supersede the judgment by filing of a proper bond while the case is\n\npending appellate review”).\n\n      The Supreme Court of Texas addressed an issue with a similar argument in\n\nBraden v. Downey, a mandamus proceeding where a district judge ordered a\n\nlitigant to pay sanctions, and gave a specific deadline by which the sanctions\n\nneeded to be paid. Braden v. Downey, 811 S.W.2d 922, 924 (Tex. 1991). In\n\nBraden, the deadline for payment preceded the final resolution of the litigation in\n\nthe trial court. Id. The relator contended that the imposition of the monetary\n\nsanctions would threaten his ability to continue the litigation. Id. In determining\n\nthe circumstances under which appeal would provide an adequate remedy at law,\n\nthe Braden court reasoned that deferral of the due date for payment of the sanction\n\nuntil entry of a final judgment would afford the sanctioned party an opportunity to\n\nsupersede the judgment and perfect his appeal. Id. at 929 (citing Thomas v.\n\nCapital Sec. Services, Inc., 836 F.2d 866, 868 (5th Cir. 1988)).\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\f      In the instant case, the Sanctions Order allowed Lea a period of over two (2)\n\nmonths to pay the sanctions, giving her plenty of time to have superseded the\n\nSanctions Order, pending the outcome of this appeal; however, she did not avail\n\nherself of supersedeas relief, so Lea’s Issue 2 should be overruled. See Elec. Data\n\nSys. Corp. v. Tyson, 862 S.W.2d 728, 734 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1993, no writ).\n\n         B. LEA DID NOT ADEQUATELY BRIEF ISSUE 2, SO THIS            COURT\n            SHOULD AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE TRIAL COURT.\n\n      Aside from one case relating to waiver of appeal upon payment of judgment\n\n– an issue Scott does not contest – Lea cites no authority for the position she\n\nadopts related to the deadline for payment of the sanctions imposed by the trial\n\ncourt, as required by Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i). Her failure to do so constitutes a\n\nwaiver of the issue on appeal, so Issue 2 should be overruled, and the Sanctions\n\nOrder should be affirmed. Franz v. Katy Indep. Sch. Dist., 35 S.W.3d 749, 755\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, no pet.); Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i).\n\n         C. THIS COURT   HAS RULED ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THE\n            SANCTIONS ORDERED BY THE TRIAL COURT CONSTITUTE A\n            DEBT, SO SCOTT DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT ISSUE HERE\n\n      In her Issue 2, Appellant has taken the position that the sanction awarded in\n\nthe Sanction Order is an “adjudicated debt” for which she cannot, constitutionally,\n\nbe imprisoned, an issue which the parties briefed extensively in No. 01-14-00920-\n\nCV, Appellant’s habeas application. This Court granted Lea’s petition for habeas\n\nrelief on the basis that “Lea cannot be imprisoned pursuant to either civil or\n\n                                        51\n\fcriminal contempt for failing to pay a debt.” In re McLaurin, 01-14-00920-CV,\n\n2015 WL 1967536, at *4 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Apr. 30, 2015, no pet.).\n\nBased on this Court’s prior ruling, Scott will not address whether the awarded\n\nsanction constitutes a debt.\n\n   IV.     ALTHOUGH THIS COURT IS NOT BOUND BY FINDINGS\n           OF FACT, SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE EXISTS IN SUPPORT\n           OF THE FINDINGS, THE SANCTIONS ORDER, AND THE\n           DENIAL OF LEA’S REQUESTED RELIEF. (APPELLANT’S\n           ISSUES I.C. AND 3)4\n\n           A. APPELLATE  COURTS MUST INDEPENDENTLY REVIEW THE\n              ENTIRE RECORD WHEN EXAMINING A SANCTIONS ORDER, SO\n              THEY ARE NOT BOUND BY THE TRIAL COURT’S FINDINGS OF\n              FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW. (APPELLANT ISSUE I. C.)\n\n       “In reviewing sanctions orders, the appellate courts are not bound by a trial\n\ncourt's findings of fact and conclusions of law; rather, appellate courts must\n\nindependently review the entire record to determine whether the trial court abused\n\nits discretion.” Am. Flood Research, Inc. v. Jones, 192 S.W.3d 581, 583 (Tex.\n\n2006). Since appellate courts are not bound by the trial court’s findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law, it seems that Lea’s point challenging them should be\n\ndisregarded as moot.\n\n\n\n       4\n         Out of an abundance of caution, Lea’s challenges to the findings of fact and conclusions\nof law will be addressed; however, in an effort to most efficiently present this Court with the\nappropriate factual review, Scott will review the trial court evidence only one time, in response\nto Lea’s various challenges.\n\n\n                                               52\n\f           B. STANDARD   OF REVIEW FOR CHALLENGED FINDINGS OF FACT\n                                           5\n               AND FOR FACTUAL SUFFICIENCY\n\n       Findings of fact following a bench trial are reviewable for factual sufficiency\n\nof the evidence under the same standards used to review a jury’s finding. Catalina\n\nv. Blasdel, 881 S.W.2nd 295, 297 (Tex. 1994).                      In determining a factual\n\nsufficiency challenge, the reviewing court must weigh and consider all of the\n\nevidence and determine (i) whether the evidence in support of a finding is so weak\n\nas to be clearly wrong and unjust, or (ii) whether the finding is so against the great\n\nweight and preponderance of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and manifestly\n\nunjust. Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 242 (Tex. 2001); Pool v. Ford\n\nMotor Co., 715 S.W.2d 629, 635 (Tex. 1986); In re King's Estate, 150 Tex. 662,\n\n244 S.W.2d 660, 661 (1951).\n\n       Unchallenged findings of fact with a reporter’s record are binding on an\n\nappellate court unless the contrary is established as a matter of law or if there is no\n\nevidence to support the finding. McGalliard v. Kuhlmann, 733 S.W.2d 694, 696-\n\n97 (Tex. 1986).\n\n           C. SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE EXISTS TO SUPPORT EACH OF THE TRIAL\n              COURT’S FINDINGS OF FACT AND THE DENIAL OF LEA’S\n               REQUESTED RELIEF\n\n\n       5\n          While Lea, in Appellant’s Brief, does not specifically state that she is challenging the\nfactual sufficiency of the evidence supporting the denial of her requested relief, she does seem to\napply the same standard, stating that “great weight and preponderance of the evidence supported\n[her position].” Again, out of an abundance of caution, Scott has included a discussion of the\nfactual sufficiency standard.\n\n\n                                                53\n\f       Lea has challenged 24 of the 29 findings of fact issued by the trial court as\n\nwell as the factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting the denial of Lea’s\n\nrequested relief. Sufficient evidence exists in support of each of the challenged\n\nfindings, as follows 6:\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         Rather than recite each individual finding of fact herein, Scott has attached the Findings\nof Fact as Appendix 3, for ease of referral by this Court.\n\n\n                                                54\n\f      Findings 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 – Amended Enforcement Pleadings\n\n      At Flowers’ request, the trial court took judicial notice of its file, including\n\nthe Original Enforcement and each amendment to the Original Enforcement, over\n\nLea’s objection. (RR 3:38). Lea’s statements to the effect that the clerk’s record\n\ndoes not contain such a motion are curious in that Lea designated the original\n\nclerk’s record, omitting each amended enforcement pleading, even though a\n\nreference to each amended enforcement pleading is contained in the Findings of\n\nFact. The Original Enforcement is, in fact, contained in the clerk’s record (Supp.\n\nCR 48-55), as are the 1st Amended enforcement pleading (Supp. CR 58-65), the 2nd\n\nAmended enforcement pleading (Supp. CR 66-70), the 3rd Amended enforcement\n\npleading (Supp. CR 71-76), and the 4th Amended enforcement pleading (Supp. CR\n\n144-148).\n\n      Additionally, the record is replete with references, by Lemkuil, to the\n\nvarious causes of action that Lea had, at one point, included, but had since\n\nabandoned. (See, e.g. RR 2:57, 58, 69). The argument that the trial court did not\n\nconsider the allegations contained in these pleadings is untenable.\n\n      Additionally, the Findings of Fact specifically refer to each of the amended\n\nenforcement pleadings, stating, “Lea, by and through her attorney of record, failed\n\nto make reasonable inquiry into the facts surrounding the allegations contained in\n\n\n\n                                         55\n\fthe [New] Enforcement, the [1st] Amended Enforcement, the 2nd Amended\n\nEnforcement, the 3rd Amended Enforcement, or the 4th Amended Enforcement,\n\nprior to filing each such pleading.”\n\n      The trial court took judicial notice of its file and these documents are\n\ncontained as part of the clerk’s record, so Findings 3 through 7 are appropriate.\n\n      Findings 11, 12, & 13 – Savings Bonds Assignments of Interest\n\n      The evidence adduced at trial was that, more than once, Scott signed\n\ndocuments purporting to transfer the applicable savings bonds to Lea. (RR 5:159;\n\nRE 20). The assignment document referenced in Finding 11 was prepared by\n\nLea’s then counsel of record, and Scott signed it. (RR 5:154-155). During the\n\ncourse of the litigation, Lemkuil determined that the parties were not using the\n\nappropriate forms for the transfer of these documents, and, as referenced in\n\nFinding 13, asked that new documents be executed, which Scott received on March\n\n8, 2015, and executed on March 19, 2013. (See RR 5:146).\n\n      The purpose of the assignment document referenced in Finding 12 (included\n\nin RE 23) was to transfer savings bonds to Scott, which – as indicated in\n\nAppellant’s Brief – is “of no moment.”\n\n      Finding 14 – Attempted exchange of Rolex for Diamonds\n\n      Flowers attempted to exchange the Brannan Diamond for Scott’s Rolex\n\nwatch on several occasions, all of which are included in the record. (RE 20, 27,\n\n\n\n                                         56\n\fand 32). Moreover, Flowers conducted an extensive cross-examination of Lea\n\nconcerning the Rolex watch, its whereabouts, and whether she was asked to return\n\nit (RR 3:94-101); Lea gave the following responses:\n\n                 • “I never swore I didn’t have it. You didn’t\n                   ask for it.” (RR 3:94).\n\n                 • That the divorce had been over for 2 years\n                   before sending the watch. (RR 3:95-96).\n\n                 • “I don’t know when [you asked for it.]”\n                   (RR 3:97).\n\n                 • In response to the question, “Is it still your\n                   testimony that there were no written\n                   demands made of you for that watch before\n                   you sent that watch to my office through Mr.\n                   Lemkuil almost two years after the fact?,”\n                   Lea replied, “I don’t know.” (RR 3:101).\n\nFor Lea to now take the position that no evidence was presented at trial concerning\n\nthe Rolex watch and a proposed exchange for the Brannan Diamond is simply\n\nunfounded.\n\n        Finding 15 – Delivery of Diamonds\n\n        Lea testified that it is possible that she received the Brannan Diamond. (RR\n\n3:7).\n\n        Findings 16, 17, 18, & 19 – Christmas Ornaments & Photos\n\n        Like the Rolex watch, Flowers, on Scott’s behalf, tried to make\n\narrangements for Lea to retrieve the Christmas ornaments, etc. on numerous\n\n\n                                         57\n\foccasions, each of which is reflected in the record. (RR 5:111-112; RE 27, 32, 33,\n\n37-A). Moreover, Lea did appear, unannounced at Flowers’ office for the purpose\n\nof retrieving these items, mentioned that not all of the property was present, and\n\ntook the property that WAS present, but never specified what items she believed to\n\nbe missing (RE 33).\n\n      Findings 20 & 21 – Bonus/Reimbursement\n\n      Lea did not, in fact, make demand for any alleged money due prior to filing\n\nthe Original Enforcement or the New Enforcement, as none is apparent from the\n\nrecord.   The record reference given in Appellant’s Brief in support of their\n\n“response” to Finding 20 deals with the transfer of the Lincoln Investments\n\naccount, which is not the subject matter of the finding.\n\n      Scott testified that a week prior to giving testimony on September 16, 2013,\n\nhe became aware that during the 1st quarter of 2010, he received mileage checks\n\ntotaling $150, and that Lea should receive 50% of that amount. (RR 5:140)\n\n      Findings 22, 23 & 24 – Oklahoma Property\n\n      The evidence concerning a deed to the Oklahoma property was not\n\nconflicting, as Lea asserts; on any of the 5 days of trial, she could not produce a\n\ncopy of a deed that she had sent to Scott for signature. (RR 3:102-103) Lea\n\nfurther admitted that she “had no idea” whether she checked into the deed issue\n\n\n\n\n                                         58\n\fbefore filing suit about it. Id. Scott agrees that Lea did not send a deed for Scott’s\n\nsignature until after the litigation had started, on May 3, 2012.\n\n      Findings 25, 26, & 27 – Lincoln Investment\n\n      Lea has taken the position that the attempts and difficulties experienced in\n\ntransferring her portion of the Lincoln Investment account are “irrelevant”;\n\nhowever, Lea did not object as to relevance to ANY of the questions asked of her,\n\nof Scott, or of Ross concerning these items, so the objection would be waived.\n\nMoreover, the individual Lea hired to review the transfer of these funds approved\n\nRoss’ calculations of the division. (RR 4:79). The fact that Lea delayed in\n\nproviding an account into which assets should be transferred is undisputed. Scott\n\nand Ross tried for nearly 2 years to receive the information from her (RR 4:81),\n\nand she did not complain about any of the calculations until August, 2012. (See\n\nPE 19).\n\n      Lea testified that: (i) she hired Allen Weiner, a third party, to assist with\n\ndividing the Lincoln account (RR 3:81); (ii) she refused to sign documents that\n\nwould have transferred her share of the Lincoln account to her (RR 3:78); (iii) she\n\n“had no idea” that the funds could not be transferred to her without her providing\n\naccount information (RR 3:85); (iv) she – finally – admitted that she did not\n\nprovide an account into which her share could be transferred until August, 2012\n\n(RR 3:85), (v) she was no longer pursuing a claim against Scott related to the\n\n\n\n                                          59\n\fLincoln account (RR 3:86), and (vi) she had “no idea” how much money Scott had\n\nspent on lawyers dealing with that issue (RR 3:87).\n\n      Lea has not cited any evidence of the “more accurate percentage” for which\n\nshe was hoping by filing suit.\n\n      Findings 28 & 29 – Reasonable Inquiry\n\n      Scott has reviewed evidence in support of these findings, above, in Section\n\nI.B., and disagrees that these findings are not the basis for sanctions. See Scott &\n\nWhite, 940 S.W.2d at 596 (Tex. 1996).\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\n\n      Lea’s suit was frivolous and brought in bad faith because she did not make\n\nadequate inquiry into the facts prior to filing, and even after she learned that the\n\nfacts may not be as she believed, she and her lawyer continued to pursue a trial\n\nregarding Lea’s spurious claims. The Sanctions Order and the Findings of Fact are\n\nsufficiently specific to support sanctions. Sufficient evidence exists to support the\n\nFindings of Fact, the sanctions ordered, and the entry of a take nothing judgment\n\ndenying Lea’s claims. For these reasons, the judgment of the trial court should be\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         60\n\f                        Respectfully submitted,\n                        FLOWERS & FRANKFORT,\n                            ATTORNEYS AT LAW\n\n                        By: /s/ Todd Frankfort\n                               TODD FRANKFORT\n                               State Bar No. 00790711\n                               RICHARD L.

I have not\n     heard back from you.\n\n            This is another effort at resolving this matter and to m1mm1ze the time and\n     unnecessary expenses accruing in concluding this matter.

Scott will execute a quitclaim deed for the Oklahoma property if you provide\n               one;\n\n            4.

Scott's financial advisor, Ross Mclaurin, had been working with Lea's\n               financial advisor, Allen Weiner, to transfer Lea's share of the Lincoln account\n               ending 0305. That effort apparently broke down when Lea refused to provide\n               information for an account where she wants her share of the Lincoln account\n                                      g;    EXHIBIT\n                                      ~\n\n                                      i fl-.~2\n\f1\\   ~   _   r'\\ -   ·- • -   I    I   I   ___ I . .   .

Scott has executed forms Bucky Allshouse sent for transferring the savings\n                        bonds. Copies of those documents were sent to Mr. Allshouse . If you want\n                        Scott to sign different forms, please provide the completed forms and we'll\n                        exchange them for Scott's bonds that Lea has and similar transfer documents\n                        signed by Lea .\n\n                     7 . Scott does not have any keys to Lea's Lexus GX4 70;\n\n                     8. Bonus/reimbursement        Documents reflecting · Scott's bonuses and\n                        reimbursements were previously provided and additional copies are attached\n                        for your convenience. Scott received no reimbursements during the period in\n                        question.\n\n                              On May 28, 2010 Scott received a bonus from GHA in the amount of\n                              $12,648.31. I understand that on the date the divorce decree was entered\n                              Lea received a $6,877.47 check, which is $553.32 more than half of the\n                              bonus . She was reportedly upset that day about the amount of the check.\n                              However, she accepted and negotiated the check.\n\n                              Scott's now aware of the overpayment. Scott offers to allow Lea to let keep\n                              the overpayment if that ends this matter. If that's not agreeable, Lea owes\n                              Scott $553 .32 .\n\n                     9. Scott doesn't have a document listing the contents of the safe deposit boxes\n                        at BBVA Compass or Wells Fargo Bank as of September 3, 2010;\n\n                     10. Scott has previously offered to make the Christmas ornaments, Gibson\n                         plates, and stuffed animals available for Lea to pick up but she never\n                         arranged to do so . Let us know when she wants to do that.\n\n                     11 . We will also arrange to have the family photographs and videos delivered to a\n                          commercial copying service for duplication . Let us know which service Lea\n                          wants to use . Each party is responsible for half of the copying charges.\n\n                     12. Finally, page 12 of the AID states the amount Scott received for his 2009 tax\n                         refund : $31,943 .00 . Lea was provided with a copy of the U.S. Treasury\n                         Department refund check. Lea received a check for $16,000.00 when the\n                         decree was entered. The amount owed is a sum certain and Lea accepted\n                         the check. It's outside the scope of discovery to request Scott's tax return.\n\fIVIr. Oan1e1   J.   LemKUII\n\nPage   I3\n               However, in a further effort to settle this matter Scott offers to provide a copy\n               of his tax return in exchange for a copy of Lea's. If she received a refund she\n               never disclosed such to Scott. Again, he's willing to let that go it we can end\n               this.\n\n       I hope you'll view this as I do - a simple matter of coordinating the exchange of\nproperty. Thank you for your assistance in wrapping this up. I look forward to hearing\nfrom you soon.\n\n\n\n\nLCB:dmh\nEnclosure\n\ncc:     ScottS.

This matter\n\nstems from Lea’s post-divorce filing of an enforcement action against Scott. At\n\nthe conclusion of trial, Scott was awarded sanctions against Lea for her having\n\nfiled a frivolous motion. All matters between the parties were heard in the 309th\n\nJudicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, the Honorable Sherry Y. Dean,\n\npresiding.\n\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\f                                     Statement of Facts\n\n      To correct certain inaccuracies contained in Appellant’s Statement of Facts,\n\nScott offers this Statement of Facts.\n\n      Lea and Scott, each a medical doctor by training, were married, but on\n\nFebruary 4, 2009, Lea filed a divorce action. (RR 1:46).\n\n      In their divorce action, Lea’s counsel was J.D. Bucky Allshouse\n\n(“Allshouse”), and Scott’s counsel was Richard L. Flowers, Jr. (“Flowers”) (PE 1).\n\nThe parties attended two mediation sessions in an effort to resolve the issues in\n\ntheir divorce. (RR 3:45) They reached an agreement at mediation, which was\n\nultimately memorialized in a Final Decree of Divorce (“Decree”) (PE 1) and an\n\nAgreement Incident to Divorce (“AID”) (PE 2). The parties signed the AID and\n\nthe trial court entered the Decree on September 3, 2010. (PE 1 & 2).\n\n      On September 7, 2010 – four days following the divorce – Flowers sent a\n\nletter to Allshouse, which, included the following pertinent statements:\n\n                   • “I’m sending an assignment for Scott’s share of the savings\n                     bonds. However, I think the bonds will have to be endorsed.”\n\n                   • “The Lincoln Investment account is being divided as per the\n                     AID. The actual securities are being divided so Lea will need\n                     to let Ross McLaurin 1 know where he is to send her share of\n                     these securities.”\n\n                   • “Otherwise, here’s what I see as the remaining action items:\n\n\n      1\n          Ross McLaurin shall be hereinafter referred to as “Ross.”\n\n\n                                                9\n\f                         1. The savings bonds need to be divided. Lea has\n                            possession of all the bonds so I need to know when\n                            and where to pick them up from her.\n                         2. Scott will exchange the diamond for his Rolex.\n                            Again, please let me know when Lea’s ready to do\n                            that.\n                         3. Scott needs to get the plates, Christmas ornaments and\n                            stuffed animals ready for Lea to pick up.\n                         4. The parties need to make arrangements for copying\n                            photos and videos.”\n\n(RE 20). The letter was part of Scott’s effort to divide the property awarded to\n\neach of the parties pursuant to the AID and Decree. (RR 6:25).\n\n      Following the September 7 letter, Scott received additional documents from\n\nAllshouse that he was to sign in order to transfer “things” to Lea. (RR 5:154).\n\n      On September 8, 2010, Scott executed three transfer documents, assigning to\n\nLea various assets. (RE 22). Scott signed these documents in an effort to promptly\n\neffectuate transfer following the conclusion of the divorce. (RR 6:26). Later,\n\nFlowers sent a “corrected Assignment of Interest” to Allshouse for Lea’s signature\n\n(R 23) to effectively divide the savings bonds. (RR 6:28).\n\n      On Tuesday, January 4, 2011, Lea, by and through Daniel Lemkuil\n\n(“Lemkuil”) filed a Motion to Enforce Final Decree of Divorce and Agreement\n\nIncident to Divorce (the “Original Enforcement”) (Supp. CR 37). In the Original\n\nEnforcement, Lea sought (generally and in addition to various unfounded tort\n\nclaims) to enforce the transfer of ten items awarded to Lea in the AID: (i) a\n\ndiamond given to Lea by Patrick Brannan (“Item 1”); (ii) “coins belonging to Lea\n\n                                         10\n\for Christopher” (the parties’ son) (“Item 2”); (iii) real property in Oklahoma (“Item\n\n3”); (iv) a First Colony Life Insurance Policy (“Item 4”); (v) a portion of an\n\naccount with Lincoln Investments (“Item 5”); (vi) various United States Savings\n\nBonds (“Item 6”); (vii) a 2006 Lexus GX470 (“Item 7”); (viii) the award of “fifty\n\npercent (50%) net of taxes of ANY bonuses or reimbursements received by\n\nHusband through April 30, 2010” (“Item 8”); (ix) the contents of safety deposit\n\nboxes at BBVA Compass and Wells Fargo banks (“Item 9”); and (x) various\n\nChristmas ornaments and other personal property (“Item 10”). (Supp. CR 37-44).\n\n      Upon learning of the Original Enforcement, Flowers sent Lemkuil a letter\n\ndated January 11, 2011, which – in pertinent part – said:\n\n                   As a vital part of the reasonable inquiry you\n                   are required to have done prior to initiating\n                   this motion, I’m assuming you have spoken\n                   to Bucky Allshouse and members of his\n                   staff, including Rebecca Tipton about the\n                   efforts they made along with my office to\n                   conclude the property transfers. I invite you\n                   to call Ross McLaurin, telephone number\n                   713/789-0800, and inquire about his many\n                   efforts to date to transfer property to your\n                   client. You (sic) client refuses to cooperate\n                   with anyone. She also refuses to transfer\n                   property she has to my client.\n\n(RE 24).\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f       On January 25, 2011, Flowers sent a letter to Lemkuil “following up to\n\nschedule a meeting to discuss what remains to be done to close this case.” (RE\n\n26).\n\n       On February 1, 2011, Lemkuil sent a letter to Flowers, asking Flowers to\n\nmake Items 1 through 10 available to him at a meeting scheduled for February 3,\n\n2011. (RE 25).\n\n       On February 3, 2011, Flowers and Lemkuil met at Flowers’ office,\n\nostensibly to resolve the matter. (RR 6:133; RE 27). Lemkuil abruptly ended the\n\nmeeting after a short period. Flowers then sent an email outlining Scott’s position\n\nrelative to the Original Enforcement, stating, “The September 7th letter [to\n\nAllshouse] addresses nearly every item made the basis of your enforcement action.\n\nVirtually every issue not addressed in my September 7th letter but made the basis\n\nof your enforcement suit has never been requested or addressed until you filed your\n\nlawsuit.” (RE 27). Flowers specifically addressed the following issues:\n\n                                Item 1 (Diamond)\n\n            “We’ve always stood ready to exchange the diamond for\n            my client’s Rolex watch, but Lea refuses.”\n\n                  Items 4 & 6 (First Colony & Savings Bonds)\n\n            “Also attached are copies of assignments signed by my\n            client last September and October which we’ve had ready\n            to exchange for the assignments from your client to\n            mine.”\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\f                          Item 5 (Lincoln Investments)\n\n            “In my January 11, 2011 letter to you I invited you to call\n            my client’s financial advisor, Ross McLaurin, and\n            provided his telephone number, 713/789 – 0800. I know\n            you never called Ross. If you had you would have\n            learned about his efforts to transfer funds to your client.\n            You also seemed to know nothing about the financial\n            advisor Lea hired who Ross has been working with. You\n            also knew nothing about the information Ross and Lea’s\n            financial advisor had exchanged about the very issue\n            made the basis of your lawsuit. You could have asked\n            Ross to provide the documentation your client wants\n            about the Lincoln account.”\n\n                        Item 10 (Christmas Ornaments)\n\n            “[Lea has] never attempted to arrange to pick up the\n            plates, ornaments, and other items which have been\n            boxed and ready to exchange for months.”\n\nId. Flowers concluded, stating, “Dan, if you pursue this lawsuit without making\n\nany inquiry I will immediately file a bad faith claim against you and your client.\n\nHandle it correctly and we’ll get it resolved.”     Id.   In response to Flowers’\n\nFebruary 3 email, Lemkuil pithily stated, “You are wrong. Strike three.” Id.\n\n      On March 15, 2015, at 10:34 a.m., Lea non-suited the Original Enforcement.\n\n(Supp. CR 47).\n\n      That same day, at 2:09 p.m., Lea filed a Motion to Enforce Final Decree of\n\nDivorce and Agreement Incident to Divorce (the “New Enforcement”). (Supp. CR\n\n48). In her brief, Lea claims that she filed the New Enforcement after “having\n\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\fnarrowed the issues,” but Items 1 through 10 in the New Enforcement were\n\nidentical to the Original Enforcement. (Supp. CR 37).\n\n      On April 25, 2011, upon learning of the filing of the New Enforcement,\n\nFlowers agreed to accept service on Scott’s behalf, and inquired as to Lemkuil’s\n\nauthority for serving a precept in what amounted to a breach of contract case. (RE\n\n28). The record is void of any response from Lemkuil.\n\n      On April 27, 2011, Flowers, having accepted service of a precept, inquired\n\nas to the legal authority upon which Lemkuil relied. Lemkuil refused to discuss\n\nthe matter. (RE 29). At the conclusion of his April 27 letter, Flowers stated, “You\n\nare urged once again to immediately non-suit this bad faith claim so as to mitigate\n\nany further unnecessary expense to my client. It’s been very obvious since you\n\nfirst appeared in this matter that you have made no inquiry into these facts\n\nwhatsoever.” Id. The record is void of any response from Lemkuil.\n\n      Later in the day on April 27, 2011, Flowers sent a follow-up letter,\n\ncorrecting a misunderstanding about a hearing date. (RE 30). At the conclusion of\n\nthe second April 27 letter, Flowers gave a similar warning to Lemkuil. Id. The\n\nrecord is void of any response from Lemkuil.\n\n      On Sunday, May 1, 2011, Flowers sent another email to Lemkuil, which\n\nsays, in part, “You’ve failed to respond to my letters regarding the improvident\n\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\fmotion to enforce and the show cause order and precept you had issued.” (RE 31).\n\nThe record is void of any response from Lemkuil.\n\n      On June 21, 2011, Flowers’ office sent another letter, again addressing each\n\nof the items raised in the New Enforcement. (RE 32). The June 21 letter begins,\n\n“I have called your office several times to discuss closing this case. I have not\n\nheard back from you.      This is another effort at resolving this matter and to\n\nminimize the time and unnecessary expenses accruing in concluding this matter.”\n\nId. Moreover, the June 21 letter specifically addresses each of Items 1 through 10.\n\nId. Rather than recite the entire contents of the June 21 letter, a true and correct\n\ncopy has been attached hereto as Appendix 1.\n\n      After a few months, on August 18, 2011, Scott filed a Motion for Sanctions\n\nfor Bad Faith Filing, but Scott proceeded to trial on his Second Amended Motion\n\nfor Sanctions for Bad Faith Filing (“Sanctions Motion”).        (CR 3-8).     In the\n\nSanctions Motion, Scott sought recovery of his attorney’s fees, court costs, and\n\nlitigation expenses, jointly and severally from Lea and from Lemkuil. (Id.)\n\n      On September 7, 2011, Flowers sent yet another email to Lemkuil after Lea\n\nhad appeared, unannounced, at Flowers’ office. (RE 33). The letter concludes,\n\n“This is another amazing chapter of a ridiculously difficult case. There is no\n\nconceivable way this could be worth the time and money which has been and will\n\nbe spent.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\f      On May 25, 2012, Flowers sent “another attempt at settlement” to Lemkuil.\n\n(RE 37). (The letter dated May 25, 2012 is among the voluminous attachments to\n\nRE 37. For ease of reference and to save the Court’s time in reviewing exhibits, a\n\ntrue and correct copy of the letter is attached hereto as Appendix 2 and cited as\n\n“RE 37-A.”) In Flowers’ May 25 letter, he again tracks Items 1 through 10, states\n\nhis belief that each of the Items had been resolved, and offers to settle the matter.\n\n(RE 37-A)\n\n      On November 9, 2012, Lea filed a First Amended Motion to Enforce Final\n\nDecree of Divorce and Agreement Incident to Divorce (the “1st Amended\n\nEnforcement”), in which she restated the allegations contained in the Original\n\nEnforcement and the New Enforcement. (Supp. CR 58). Over the course of the\n\nlitigation, Lea filed five different versions of her enforcement pleading, amended\n\nher pleading four times, each time, either omitting causes of action that were\n\nclearly not valid OR not changing the allegations in the pleading – AT ALL.\n\n(Supp. CR 66, 71, 144)\n\n      On March 27, 2013, Lea filed her Fourth Amended Motion to Enforce Final\n\nDecree of Divorce and Agreement Incident to Divorce (“4th Amended\n\nEnforcement”), in which she abandoned all prior allegations, EXCEPT for the\n\nfollowing:\n\n             • The award of the diamond given by Patrick Brannan, and located\n               in a safe deposit box at Chase Bank, Medical Center location;\n\n                                         16\n\f               • The “fifty percent (50%) net of taxes of ANY bonuses or\n                 reimbursements received by Husband through April 30, 2010”; and\n\n               • A cause of action for conversion against Scott.\n(RE 55).\n\n         During trial, each side testified on their own behalf. In addition, Scott called\n\none fact witness to present evidence of some of the difficulties that had been\n\nencountered in transferring property to Lea. Given Lea’s sufficiency challenges\n\nand challenges to the findings of fact, it is important to review a summary of the\n\npertinent testimony adduced at trial.\n\n         Scott’s Testimony\n\n         During trial, Scott testified that at the beginning of the lawsuit, he\n\nrecognized that he was being sued over a list of “about 10 things,” initially. (RR\n\n6:68):\n\n         Item 1 (Diamond) – Scott testified that there was some confusion, at least in\n\nhis mind, about which diamond Lea had, which diamond was in question, and\n\nwhich diamond he was obligated to turn over to Lea. (RR 6:74). Scott said that he\n\nturned over both the “mine cut diamond” and the “Brandon (sic) diamond.” (RR\n\n5:129). He testified that he found one diamond in his safe, and – thinking it was\n\nthe Patrick Brannan Diamond –gave it to Lea. (RR 5:149). He later found a\n\nsecond diamond, and turned it over to Lea, too. (RR 5:150). He further testified\n\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\fthat each time Lea insisted that he had the Patrick Brannan Diamond, he looked for\n\nit, and was unable to find it. (RR 6:74)\n\n      Item 2 (Coins) – Scott testified that he did not have any of the coins\n\nreferenced in the AID.     (RR 5:133).      Flowers’ office confirmed as much to\n\nLemkuil in writing. (RE 32).\n\n      Item 3 (Oklahoma Property) – Scott testified that he was not given a deed to\n\nsign, transferring any interest in the Oklahoma property, but that when Lea finally\n\ndid send a deed, he “accepted it.” (RR 6:57-58) Correspondence from Flowers’\n\noffice informed Lea and Lemkuil of this fact. (RE 32)\n\n      Item 4 (Life Insurance Policy) – Scott testified that he did not recall any\n\ndocument pertaining to transfer of the First Colony Life Insurance policy to Lea\n\n(RR 5:159-160); however, Scott did sign an Assignment of Interest dated\n\nSeptember 8, 2010, and received from Allshouse, which purported to transfer the\n\npolicy to Lea. (RE 22).\n\n      Item 5 (Lincoln Investments) – Scott testified that he signed a document\n\ntransferring the Lincoln account to Lea. (RR 5:143).\n\n      Item 6 (Savings Bonds) – Scott testified that he signed documents\n\ntransferring the applicable savings bonds to Lea, around the time their divorce was\n\nfinalized. (RR 5:159; RE 20, 22). Scott further testified on cross-examination that\n\nhe executed transfer documents for the savings bonds awarded to Lea “every time\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\f[he] was asked to do it.” (RR 5:107). Correspondence from Flowers’ office\n\nconfirms Scott’s testimony. (RE 20, 22, 27, 32, 37-A). Although at one point\n\nduring the litigation, Lea claimed that all of the savings bonds were lost, in fact,\n\nLea had some in her possession, and Scott had none. (RR 6:22).\n\n      Item 7 (Lexus) – Scott maintained that he did not possess Lea’s Lexus keys.\n\n(RR 5:132). Correspondence from Flowers’ office informed Lea and Lemkuil of\n\nthis fact. (RE 32, 37-A).\n\n      Item 8 (Bonus & Reimbursement) – Scott testified that he recognized that he\n\nhad an obligation to pay Lea a portion of bonuses and reimbursement that he\n\nreceived by April 21, 2010. (RR 5:139). Scott further testified that he was paid a\n\nbonus for the first quarter 2010, but that he did not receive it until the end of April,\n\n2010 – after April 21. (RR 6:10). Scott presented a copy of his bonus check (RE\n\n7), identified the net amount of the bonus received, and testified that he paid Lea\n\none-half of that amount.      (RR 6:11-12).     Scott identified the cashier’s check\n\npayable to Lea for half of his first quarter 2010 bonus. (RE 9; RR 6:12). Finally,\n\nScott testified that while investigating whether he had paid the correct amount of\n\nbonus, he realized that on May 3, 2010, he received his “February draw check,”\n\nand gave a reason for the delay in payment. (RE 5 & 6; RR 6:14-17). Scott\n\nconfirmed this additional draw check was paid after the date the parties signed the\n\nAID. He further confirmed that Lea had never claimed any interest in this draw,\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\fbut that upon receipt, he tendered to Lea a cashier’s check for half. (RE 8; RR\n\n6:18-19).\n\n      Item 9 (Safe Deposit Boxes) – Although Scott did not testify regarding the\n\nexistence (or not) of a safety deposit box to which Lea was entitled, RE 32 and 37-\n\nA both state, “Scott doesn’t have a document listing the contents of the safe deposit\n\nboxes at BBVA Compass or Wells Fargo Bank as of September 3, 2010.”\n\n      Item 10 (Christmas Ornaments) – Scott testified that he made the Christmas\n\nornaments and other related personal property available for Lea, as required by the\n\nAID, and the items sat, boxed at his residence for 1.5 years, and then at Flowers’\n\noffice because Lea refused to retrieve them. (RR 5:111-112).\n\n      Lea’s Testimony\n\n      Lea, in response to the questions, “What inquiries did you make into\n\nwhether or not Mr. McLaurin had your things before you sued him about it?” and\n\n“You filed a lawsuit that preceded this one on the same issues, right, virtually?,”\n\nstated:\n\n                                 “I have no idea.”\n\n(RR 3:103 & 60, respectively). Lea further testified that she did not see any of her\n\npleadings prior to filing, and could not vouch for their contents because she had not\n\nread them. (RR 4:30). Lea testified that she was unaware of any of the efforts\n\nmade to settle the case (RR 4:32), but then – moments later – testified about a letter\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\fLemkuil had received (RE 37), and admitted that she was aware of settlement\n\nefforts. (RR 4:33).\n\n       Testifying over the course of 4 of the 5 days that the case was presented, Lea\n\nspoke at length about Items 1 through 10. Although Lea’s testimony was difficult\n\nto follow at times and she received several admonishments from the trial court\n\nconcerning her answers (See, e.g. RR 2:50, 2:55, 2:60, 2:68, 3:20, 3:25, 3:28, 3:31,\n\n3:39, 3:40, 3:42, 3:45, 3:57, 3:65, 3:101, 3:126, 3:1372, 4:16, 4:20, 4:36, 4:40,\n\n4:44, 4:46, 5:18, 5:21, and 5:45), her testimony may be summarized as follows:\n\n       Item 1 (Diamond) – Lea testified that she was awarded the Brannan\n\nDiamond in the AID. (RR 2:48). She testified that she received a diamond from\n\nScott following their divorce, but that it was not the Brannan Diamond. (RR 2:54).\n\nLea, later, testified that it was possible that she had received the Brannan Diamond.\n\n(RR 3:7). Later still, she testified that Scott had showed her the inside of his safe\n\ndeposit box, and that it contained 2 diamonds. (RR 3:117). Lea confirmed that she\n\nis not a jewelry collector; has no specialized knowledge of diamonds; and has no\n\nspecial training or knowledge to enable her to discern one diamond from another.\n\n(RR 3:119-120).         Lea further admitted that she was “unsure” whether the\n\ndescription of the Brannan Diamond contained in her pleading was accurate. (RR\n\n3:131). Finally, Flowers asked: “You’ve made these comparisons if it wasn’t the\n\n       2\n          The trial court admonished Lea, this time, by saying, “And ma’am, I’m telling you right\nnow, if I hear you ask one more question, I’m going to fine you. Do you understand that?”\n\n\n                                               21\n\fround cut diamond it’s the old mine cut diamond. You put it in your pleading.\n\nThat’s what I’m asking you about. I’m asking you what investigation research,\n\ninquiry, what sort of legwork, if you will, did you do to investigate that claim\n\nbefore you made it?” (RR 3:138). Lea’s response: “Nothing.” Id.\n\n       Item 2 (Coins) – In response to Flowers’ question “Did you ever send a\n\ndemand asking your husband -- former husband for coins and stamps out of the\n\nsafe deposit box?,” Lea stated, “I have no idea.” (RR 3:66). Moreover, despite\n\nher testimony that she and Scott do not communicate via email and that she only\n\n“occasionally” speaks to him on the telephone (RR 3:67), Lea testified that she\n\nasked him for the coins (and stamps) on more than one occasion before she filed\n\nthe New Enforcement, but could not recall when or how many times. (RR 3:66-\n\n67).\n\n       Item 3 (Oklahoma) – Lea testified that she had asked Scott to execute a\n\nQuitclaim deed to the Oklahoma property “several times,” but that he never signed\n\nit. (RR 2:56-57). On cross examination, however, she stated that she did present\n\nScott with a deed, but did bring a copy to trial because she did not know to. She\n\ntestified that she gave the deed to Scott directly, but that the document was also\n\nsent “by the attorney” to Scott and to Flowers’ office; and that she “had no idea”\n\nwhether anyone responded to the request. (RR 3:102-103). The record is void of\n\nany such document, and Lea abandoned the issue at trial. (RE 55).\n\n\n\n                                       22\n\f      Item 4 (Life Insurance) – Lea testified that she believed Scott was holding\n\nthe copy of the life insurance policy that she was awarded pursuant to the AID\n\nbecause “he’s mean” and for “revenge,” but had “no idea” whether he had\n\neconomic reasons for holding the policy. (RR 3:89) (emphasis added). She further\n\ntestified that prior to filing for divorce, , she had taken “some boxes” with “some”\n\nfinancial documents out of the house. (RR 3:92). Lea’s removal of financial\n\ndocuments would dove-tail with Scott’s assertion that he did not have the\n\ninsurance documents.\n\n      Item 5 (Lincoln) – Regarding the Lincoln Investments account, Lea testified\n\nthat: (i) she hired Allen Weiner, a third party, to assist with dividing the Lincoln\n\naccount (RR 3:81); (ii) she refused to sign documents that would have transferred\n\nher share of the Lincoln account to her (RR 3:78); (iii) she “had no idea” that the\n\nfunds could not be transferred to her without her providing account information\n\n(RR 3:85); (iv) she – finally – admitted that she did not provide an account into\n\nwhich her share could be transferred until August, 2012 (RR 3:85), (v) she was no\n\nlonger pursuing a claim against Scott related to the Lincoln account (RR 3:86), and\n\n(vi) she had “no idea” how much money Scott had spent on lawyers dealing with\n\nthat issue (RR 3:87).\n\n      Issue 6 (Bonds) – Lea admitted that she refused to sign documents that\n\nwould transfer her share of the savings bonds to her (RR 3:78), but she had also\n\n\n\n                                        23\n\falready received all of the savings bonds to which she believed she was entitled.\n\n(RR 3:14).\n\n      Issue 7 (Lexus) – Lea testified that, if she had sent a written demand for\n\nreturn of the key prior to filing suit, she did not bring a copy of that demand with\n\nher to court. (RR 3:66). When asked whether she received a letter from Flowers’\n\noffice, stating that Scott does not have the keys to the Lexus, Lea replied, “I have\n\nno idea.” (RR 3:65). Lea gave the same response to an inquiry as to the value of\n\nthe Lexus key for which she sued. (RR 3:66). Lea was, in fact, advised in writing\n\nthat Scott did not have her Lexus key. (RE 32, 37-A).\n\n      Issue 8 (Bonus & Reimbursement) – During cross-examination, the\n\nfollowing exchange occurred:\n\n             Q:          (By Mr. Flowers) In that first paragraph [of page 3 of the\n                         4th Amended Enforcement], just for clarity, I’ll read it\n                         and you tell me if I read it correctly. ‘The bonuses and\n                         reimbursements referenced in the Agreement Incident to\n                         Divorce include all bonuses or reimbursements earned or\n                         received net of taxes only from February 1, 2009 through\n                         April 30th, 2010 in an amount not less than $8,526.31 nor\n                         more than $75,310.89 prior to interest on the IMED pay,\n                         together with other bonuses and reimbursement claims as\n                         expressed below for an additional pre-interest claim of\n                         $31,618.95.’\n                         Did I read that correctly?\n             A:          Umm, okay.\n             Q:          Did I read it correctly?\n             A:          Yes.\n                                        *    *      *\n\n\n                                        24\n\f            Q:           (By Mr. Flowers) Can you please tell the Court what in\n                         the world that means?\n            A:           That he has agreed to pay me 50 percent net of taxes of\n                         any bonus or reimbursement.\n            Q:           Where did you get the number $8,526.31?

Where did you get the number $75,310.89?\n            A:           I’m not sure.\n                                         *    *   *\n            Q:           Okay. Let me break it up. I’m sorry. Bad question. Let\n                         me start with IMED pay. Prior to interest on the IMED\n                         pay, what is the interest on the IMED pay?\n            A:           I’m not sure.\n\n(RR 4:19-21).\n\n      Ultimately, Lea was unable to testify as to an exact amount of money that\n\nshe was seeking or as to how any amount was calculated. (RR 4:26). At first, she\n\nindicated that she needed additional paperwork, but could not identify any\n\ndocument that had not been produced (RR 4:27), and admitted that she had not\n\nasked the trial court to order production of documents. (RR 4:28).\n\n      The following day, Lea testified that she was “not sure” whether she had\n\never itemized her reimbursement claim for Scott (RR 5:71) or had ever sent the list\n\nof expenses (RR 5:72-73). Lea “believed” the total amount owed to her was\n\n$98,000 (RR 5:73), but was unable to offer any basis for the amount of the claim.\n\n(RR 5:75-76).\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\f      Issue 9 (Safe Deposit Boxes) – Lea testified that, pursuant to the AID, she\n\nwas to receive the contents of two safe deposit boxes, one at BBVA Compass, and\n\none at Wells Fargo. (RR 2:70). She maintained she received the entire contents of\n\nthe Wells Fargo box, but was abandoning the claim. (RR 2:70-71). The record is\n\nvoid of any accounting of items from the Wells Fargo safe deposit box to which\n\nLea claimed she was entitled.\n\n      Issue 10 (Christmas Ornaments) – Lea testified that she (i) requested the\n\nChristmas ornaments from Scott by sending him typewritten letters, (ii) “may or\n\nmay not” have copies of the letters, (iii) did not bring any such letters to court (RR\n\n3:56), and (iv) could not remember the time frame of sending the letters.\n\n(RR3:58). Although Lea testified that she believed she did not receive all of her\n\nChristmas things, she did not ask the trial court to make any orders concerning\n\nthem (RR 3:14), and the record is void of any reference to any specific item still\n\noutstanding.\n\n      Ross McLaurin\n\n      Scott called Ross McLaurin, his brother. Ross is employed with Lincoln\n\nInvestments, and acted as the parties’ investment advisor both before and during\n\nthe parties’ marriage. (RR 4:71-72). During the time that Ross managed the\n\nparties’ money, Lea never complained about fees, did not question Ross’ honesty,\n\nand did not write complaint letters to Lincoln. (RR 4:122). After the parties’\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\fdivorce, Ross was to divide the accounts in conformity with the mediated\n\nsettlement agreement. (RR 4:75). A brokerage account and a retirement account\n\nwere to be divided. (RR 4:76). The retirement account called for a specific\n\namount to go to Lea, but in the brokerage account, he “took a pro-rata share of\n\neach investment and each accounting that’s shared and divided it to each party.”\n\n(RR 4:75-76). In arriving at the division, Ross “…was trying to be as impartial as\n\n[he] could to give each person the equal share, after tax benefit, of the assets.” (RR\n\n4:100).\n\n      Ross testified that in order to initiate a transfer to Lea, she needed to provide\n\nthe account into which she wanted her shares placed, and that he had difficulty in\n\nobtaining that information from Lea. (RR 4:75-76). Ross made effort to obtain the\n\ninformation from Lea directly and from Mr. Weiner. (RR 4:78).\n\n      Ross calculated the division of the account in September, 2010. (RR 4:90).\n\nHe discussed those calculations with Mr. Weiner in mid-November, 2010. (RR\n\n4:79). Ross segregated Scott’s portion of the account into a separate account on\n\nDecember 21, 2010. (RR 4:90). In early January, Ross also removed Scott’s share\n\nof dividends that were paid into the account. (RR 4:91). The interest, dividends,\n\ngains, and losses on Lea’s portion of the account remained with Lea. (RR 4:111).\n\n      In speaking with Mr. Weiner in mid-November, 2010, Ross explained the\n\nmethod by which the account was divided, and Mr. Weiner voiced no objection.\n\n\n\n                                         27\n\f(RR 4:79). Lea did not send any letters to Lincoln Investments, objecting to Ross’\n\ndivision of the account or his management of it. (RR 4:99) Even after Ross and\n\nMr. Weiner reviewed a “spreadsheet with all of the details,” neither of them were\n\nable to get Lea to designate an account for the transfer or sign paperwork necessary\n\nto effect transfer of the Lincoln Investments account. (RR 4:79-80).\n\n      Nearly two years later, Ross received a Brokerage and Client Account\n\nTransfer Form, signed by Lea and dated August 22, 2012, that finally designated\n\nthe account into which Lea wanted her assets transferred.          (RR 4:81).    Ross\n\ntestified that Scott signed the document within less than a week following receipt,\n\nand the assets eventually were transferred to Lea. (RR 4:82-83).\n\n      Ross testified that at the end of 2012, when Lea attempted to transfer the\n\nassets, she did not include all of the paperwork necessary to effectuate the transfer,\n\nso “…[he] provided additional documentation to make the transfer occur, including\n\na letter from Scott, which he signed immediately, to expedite the transfer and make\n\nit happen.” (RR 4:85). The transfer was completed on January 4, 2013, but the\n\ndelay was not a result of anything that Scott did. Id. Moreover, Ross testified that\n\nhe asked Lemkuil for assistance in expediting the transfer of Lea’s assets, and that\n\nLemkuil told him he would not assist. (RR 4:86-87).\n\n\n\n\n                                         28\n\f      Despite any whatever complaints she may have had, Lea still asked Ross to\n\ntransfer the assets to her Vanguard account (RR 4:125), and had dropped Lincoln\n\nInvestments complaint by the time of trial. (RR 4:126-127).\n\n      Flowers Testimony\n\n      Testifying as an expert on the issue of attorney’s fees, Flowers first received\n\nnotice of Lea’s enforcement action before any attempt at service via an email he\n\nreceived from the district clerk’s office.    (RR 6:119).     Almost immediately,\n\nFlowers reached out to Lemkuil in an effort to resolve the matter. When Flowers\n\ninitially inquired as to whether Lemkuil had reviewed the file, Lemkuil responded,\n\n“why would he review the file, this is a new case.” (RR 6:120). From that point,\n\nFlowers began to investigate the case himself, and realized that the breach of\n\ncontract matter had been improperly filed as a contempt case, with the issuance of\n\na precept (rather than citation). Id. Ultimately, that issue was resolved, but before\n\nFlowers filed a motion and prevailed at the hearing. (RR 6:121).\n\n      In addition to attending to the matter of the improperly issued precept,\n\nFlowers continued his efforts to resolve the case. (RR 6:122; see e.g. RE 32, 37-\n\nA). Flowers discovered that no effort had been made by Lemkuil or Lea to make\n\ninquiry into the claims asserted prior to filing either lawsuit. Id. As early as\n\nFebruary, 2011, Flowers informed Lemkuil of his belief that no investigation had\n\nbeen made. (RR 6:133-134).\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\f      Lea (through Lemkuil) served written discovery to which Scott (through\n\nFlowers) had to respond (RR 6:122). Lea (through Lemkuil) noticed several\n\ndepositions which Flowers attended. (RR 6:124). There were several discovery\n\ndisputes, each of which required a discovery hearing before Judge David Farr,\n\n312th Judicial District Court. Id. In November, 2011, everyone realized that Judge\n\nFarr had previously mediated the parties’ temporary orders during a time when he\n\nwas not on the bench, so the matter was assigned to the 309th. Id. All of these\n\nancillary matters consumed substantial time and effort from Flowers and his staff.\n\n      In addition to the several court appearances and trial resets that occurred\n\n(RR 6:125), it proved necessary for Flowers to spend an extraordinary amount of\n\ntime trying to “sort out the very nebulous claims that had been made.” Id. Flowers\n\ntestified that “…up to this moment we didn’t know what the claims were. It’s been\n\ndifficult. It was very difficult to sort through that…a lot of attorney time to sort\n\nthrough these various things to figure out what it was she claimed was missing.”\n\n(RR 6:125-126).\n\n      Flowers testified that the total amount invoiced by his firm was $68,844.25\n\nbased upon three invoices, which were collectively admitted into evidence. (RR\n\n6:126; RE 36). Flowers further testified to an additional amount of $25,000.00,\n\nwhich were the attorney’s fees Scott incurred through the trial of the case. (RR\n\n6:127).\n\n\n\n                                        30\n\f      Trial Court Ruling\n\n      At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court took the matter under\n\nadvisement. (RR 6:148). On March 3, 2014, the trial court rendered its ruling, and\n\non April 8, 2014, the trial court entered its Final Judgment on Lea Percy\n\nMcLaurin’s Motion to Enforce and Scott Sutton McLaurin’s Motion for Sanctions\n\nand Bad Faith Filing (the “Sanctions Judgment”). (CR 12).\n\n      The Sanctions Judgment denied Lea the relief she sought (CR 13), granted\n\nthe Sanctions Motion (CR 13-15), and ordered sanctions, stating, in pertinent part:\n\n                The Court having considered the pleadings,\n                evidence, and arguments of counsel finds that the\n                allegations    contained      in    LEA   PERCY\n                                  th\n                McLAURIN’s 4 Amended Motion to Enforce\n                Final Decree of Divorce and Agreement Incident\n                to Divorce are generally false, groundless and\n                brought in bad faith. The lawyer filing these\n                pleadings failed to make reasonable inquiry before\n                filing said groundless and bad faith pleadings.\n                Rule 13, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. The\n                Court makes the following findings in support of\n                this final judgment for sanctions, to wit\n\n                                     *   *    *\n\n                The attorney who filed these pleadings failed to\n                make the reasonable inquiry required prior to filing\n                the suit.

(RR 5:73-75).\n\n       The trial court properly granted sanctions because – examining the facts at\n\nthe time the New Enforcement was filed and considering the entire history of the\n\ncase, Lea’s pleading was groundless and, after she (or her lawyer) learned that the\n\nfacts may not what she believed, no reasonable inquiry was made.

LEA  DID NOT MAKE THE APPROPRIATE INQUIRY BEFORE\n              FILING THE NEW ENFORCEMENT, SO TRIAL COURT WAS\n              WITHIN ITS DISCRETION TO ORDER SANCTIONS AGAINST HER.\n\n      To support the Sanctions Motion, Scott needed competent proof that (1) a\n\nreasonable inquiry into Lea’s allegations would have disclosed that not all the\n\nallegations pled had or would likely have evidentiary support, and (2) Lea did not\n\nmake a reasonable inquiry before filing suit. Unifund, 299 S.W.3d at 97 (Tex.\n\n2009) (citing Low, 221 S.W.3d at 617 (Tex. 2007))..\n\n      Flowers notified Lemkuil that Lea’s claims were frivolous in January, 2011\n\n(RE 24), at least twice in February, 2011 (RR 6:133; RE 27), at least twice in\n\nApril, 2011 (RE 29 & 30), and at least once in May, 2011 (RE 31). In June, 2011,\n\nFlowers’ office sent Lemkuil a detailed letter, specifically addressing Items 1\n\nthrough 10.    (RE 32).     The record is void of any evidence of Lemkuil’s\n\ninvestigation of Lea’s claims following his receipt of any of these notifications\n\n(especially after Flowers’ June, 2011 letter); instead, Lemkuil proceeded with\n\nserving written discovery and noticing depositions, causing Scott’s prolonged\n\ninvolvement in frivolous litigation – at great expense. (RR 6:122, 124, 125).\n\n\n\n                                        40\n\f      Lea has taken the position that her amending her pleadings to eliminate moot\n\nissues renders the Sanctions Order improper because it is based, in part, on the\n\neliminated allegations, a situation similar to that presented in Scott & White\n\nMemorial Hospital v. Schexnider. In Scott & White, the plaintiffs filed suit against\n\nsome 33 defendants in a medical malpractice suit. Scott & White, 940 S.W.2d at\n\n595 (Tex. 1996). All 33 defendants, filed a motion for summary judgment, but\n\nbefore the trial court could rule, plaintiffs nonsuited all but two defendants by\n\nomitting them from an amended pleading. Id. The trial court ended up granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the remaining defendants, after which all\n\ndefendants moved for sanctions pursuant to Rule 13, which the trial court granted.\n\nId. The Austin Court of Appeals overruled the sanctions order. Id. In overturning\n\nthe court of appeals, the Supreme Court of Texas followed the United States\n\nSupreme Court holding interpreting Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (prior to\n\nthat rule’s amendment to allow a “safe-harbor”):\n\n                   Baseless filing puts the machinery of justice\n                   in motion, burdening courts and individuals\n                   alike with needless expense and delay. Even\n                   if the careless litigant quickly dismisses the\n                   action, the harm triggering Rule 11’s\n                   concerns has already occurred. Therefore, a\n                   litigant who violates Rule 11 merits\n                   sanctions even after a dismissal.

See Nath, 446 S.W.3d at 363 (Tex. 2014).\n\n“First, a direct relationship must exist between the offensive conduct and the\n\nsanction imposed.

(RR 5:154, 6:26).\n\n          • Without warning or investigation, Lea filed\n            a contempt action in an effort to enforce the\n            AID, a contract. (Supp. CR 37; RR 6:119-\n            120).\n\n          • When Flowers attempted to resolve the\n            matter before protracted litigation occurred,\n            it became apparent that no investigation had\n            occurred. (RR 6:120).\n\n          • After Flowers informed Lemkuil that the\n            facts may not be as Lemkuil understood,\n            Lemkuil     non-suited       the     Original\n            Enforcement    and      filed    the    New\n            Enforcement, a virtually identical pleading.\n            (RE 27; Supp CR 47 & 48)\n\n          • Substantial attorney and staff time was\n            devoted to responding to discovery and\n            attempting to figure out what property Lea\n            claimed she did not receive.

(RR 3:138).\n\n               • Lea has no special training or knowledge to\n                 enable her to discern one diamond from\n                 another (RR 3:119-120), and it was possible\n                 that she had received the Brannan Diamond.\n                 (RR 3:7).\n\n               • On April 30, 2010, Scott received a bonus\n                 for the first quarter of 2010 in the net\n                 amount of $12,955.27 (RE 7), and prior to\n                 her filing the Original Enforcement or the\n                 New Enforcement, he paid Lea the sum of\n                 $6,877.63, by cashier’s check. (RE 9).\n\n               • Lea was “not sure” how the damages related\n                 to bonus/reimbursement contained in her\n                 pleading were calculated. (RR 4:19-21).\n\n               • In defending against the frivolous suit(s) Lea\n                 filed, Scott incurred attorney’s fees and\n                 expenses in the amount of $68,844.25 (RE\n                 36; RR 6:126), plus an additional\n                 $25,000.00 incurred through the trial of the\n                 case (RR 6:127).\n\n      Scott incurred $93,844.25 in attorney’s fees, and asked the trial court to\n\nsanction Lea in that amount. (RR 6:127). After considering the evidence, the trial\n\ncourt sanctioned Lea in the amount of $52,378.88 (CR 29), an amount that is over\n\n$41,000 less than the amount Scott requested.\n\n\n\n\n                                       44\n\f      A sanction “…should be no more severe than necessary to satisfy its\n\nlegitimate purposes.” Nath, 446 S.W.3d at 363 (Tex. 2014). Two legitimate\n\npurposes of sanctions against frivolous claimants are the deterrence of similar\n\nconduct in the future, and the compensation of the aggrieved party by reimbursing\n\nthe costs incurred in responding to baseless pleadings. Scott & White, 940 S.W.2d\n\nat 597 (Tex. 1996).\n\n      Here, Lea, through her abusive litigation and her failure to “stop, think and\n\ninvestigate more carefully before serving and filing papers,” caused Scott to incur\n\nnearly $100,000.00 in attorney’s fees and expense related to his defense.

Since appellate courts are not bound by the trial court’s findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law, it seems that Lea’s point challenging them should be\n\ndisregarded as moot.\n\n\n\n       4\n         Out of an abundance of caution, Lea’s challenges to the findings of fact and conclusions\nof law will be addressed; however, in an effort to most efficiently present this Court with the\nappropriate factual review, Scott will review the trial court evidence only one time, in response\nto Lea’s various challenges.\n\n\n                                               52\n\f           B. STANDARD   OF REVIEW FOR CHALLENGED FINDINGS OF FACT\n                                           5\n               AND FOR FACTUAL SUFFICIENCY\n\n       Findings of fact following a bench trial are reviewable for factual sufficiency\n\nof the evidence under the same standards used to review a jury’s finding. Catalina\n\nv. Blasdel, 881 S.W.2nd 295, 297 (Tex. 1994).                      In determining a factual\n\nsufficiency challenge, the reviewing court must weigh and consider all of the\n\nevidence and determine (i) whether the evidence in support of a finding is so weak\n\nas to be clearly wrong and unjust, or (ii) whether the finding is so against the great\n\nweight and preponderance of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and manifestly\n\nunjust.

SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE EXISTS TO SUPPORT EACH OF THE TRIAL\n              COURT’S FINDINGS OF FACT AND THE DENIAL OF LEA’S\n               REQUESTED RELIEF\n\n\n       5\n          While Lea, in Appellant’s Brief, does not specifically state that she is challenging the\nfactual sufficiency of the evidence supporting the denial of her requested relief, she does seem to\napply the same standard, stating that “great weight and preponderance of the evidence supported\n[her position].” Again, out of an abundance of caution, Scott has included a discussion of the\nfactual sufficiency standard.\n\n\n                                                53\n\f       Lea has challenged 24 of the 29 findings of fact issued by the trial court as\n\nwell as the factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting the denial of Lea’s\n\nrequested relief. Sufficient evidence exists in support of each of the challenged\n\nfindings, as follows 6:\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         Rather than recite each individual finding of fact herein, Scott has attached the Findings\nof Fact as Appendix 3, for ease of referral by this Court.\n\n\n                                                54\n\f      Findings 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 – Amended Enforcement Pleadings\n\n      At Flowers’ request, the trial court took judicial notice of its file, including\n\nthe Original Enforcement and each amendment to the Original Enforcement, over\n\nLea’s objection. (RR 3:38). Lea’s statements to the effect that the clerk’s record\n\ndoes not contain such a motion are curious in that Lea designated the original\n\nclerk’s record, omitting each amended enforcement pleading, even though a\n\nreference to each amended enforcement pleading is contained in the Findings of\n\nFact. The Original Enforcement is, in fact, contained in the clerk’s record (Supp.\n\nCR 48-55), as are the 1st Amended enforcement pleading (Supp. CR 58-65), the 2nd\n\nAmended enforcement pleading (Supp. CR 66-70), the 3rd Amended enforcement\n\npleading (Supp. CR 71-76), and the 4th Amended enforcement pleading (Supp. CR\n\n144-148).\n\n      Additionally, the record is replete with references, by Lemkuil, to the\n\nvarious causes of action that Lea had, at one point, included, but had since\n\nabandoned. (See, e.g. RR 2:57, 58, 69). The argument that the trial court did not\n\nconsider the allegations contained in these pleadings is untenable.\n\n      Additionally, the Findings of Fact specifically refer to each of the amended\n\nenforcement pleadings, stating, “Lea, by and through her attorney of record, failed\n\nto make reasonable inquiry into the facts surrounding the allegations contained in\n\n\n\n                                         55\n\fthe [New] Enforcement, the [1st] Amended Enforcement, the 2nd Amended\n\nEnforcement, the 3rd Amended Enforcement, or the 4th Amended Enforcement,\n\nprior to filing each such pleading.”\n\n      The trial court took judicial notice of its file and these documents are\n\ncontained as part of the clerk’s record, so Findings 3 through 7 are appropriate.\n\n      Findings 11, 12, & 13 – Savings Bonds Assignments of Interest\n\n      The evidence adduced at trial was that, more than once, Scott signed\n\ndocuments purporting to transfer the applicable savings bonds to Lea. (RR 5:159;\n\nRE 20). The assignment document referenced in Finding 11 was prepared by\n\nLea’s then counsel of record, and Scott signed it. (RR 5:154-155). During the\n\ncourse of the litigation, Lemkuil determined that the parties were not using the\n\nappropriate forms for the transfer of these documents, and, as referenced in\n\nFinding 13, asked that new documents be executed, which Scott received on March\n\n8, 2015, and executed on March 19, 2013. (See RR 5:146).\n\n      The purpose of the assignment document referenced in Finding 12 (included\n\nin RE 23) was to transfer savings bonds to Scott, which – as indicated in\n\nAppellant’s Brief – is “of no moment.”\n\n      Finding 14 – Attempted exchange of Rolex for Diamonds\n\n      Flowers attempted to exchange the Brannan Diamond for Scott’s Rolex\n\nwatch on several occasions, all of which are included in the record. (RE 20, 27,\n\n\n\n                                         56\n\fand 32). Moreover, Flowers conducted an extensive cross-examination of Lea\n\nconcerning the Rolex watch, its whereabouts, and whether she was asked to return\n\nit (RR 3:94-101); Lea gave the following responses:\n\n                 • “I never swore I didn’t have it. You didn’t\n                   ask for it.” (RR 3:94).\n\n                 • That the divorce had been over for 2 years\n                   before sending the watch. (RR 3:95-96).\n\n                 • “I don’t know when [you asked for it.]”\n                   (RR 3:97).\n\n                 • In response to the question, “Is it still your\n                   testimony that there were no written\n                   demands made of you for that watch before\n                   you sent that watch to my office through Mr.\n                   Lemkuil almost two years after the fact?,”\n                   Lea replied, “I don’t know.” (RR 3:101).\n\nFor Lea to now take the position that no evidence was presented at trial concerning\n\nthe Rolex watch and a proposed exchange for the Brannan Diamond is simply\n\nunfounded.\n\n        Finding 15 – Delivery of Diamonds\n\n        Lea testified that it is possible that she received the Brannan Diamond. (RR\n\n3:7).\n\n        Findings 16, 17, 18, & 19 – Christmas Ornaments & Photos\n\n        Like the Rolex watch, Flowers, on Scott’s behalf, tried to make\n\narrangements for Lea to retrieve the Christmas ornaments, etc. on numerous\n\n\n                                         57\n\foccasions, each of which is reflected in the record. (RR 5:111-112; RE 27, 32, 33,\n\n37-A). Moreover, Lea did appear, unannounced at Flowers’ office for the purpose\n\nof retrieving these items, mentioned that not all of the property was present, and\n\ntook the property that WAS present, but never specified what items she believed to\n\nbe missing (RE 33).\n\n      Findings 20 & 21 – Bonus/Reimbursement\n\n      Lea did not, in fact, make demand for any alleged money due prior to filing\n\nthe Original Enforcement or the New Enforcement, as none is apparent from the\n\nrecord.   The record reference given in Appellant’s Brief in support of their\n\n“response” to Finding 20 deals with the transfer of the Lincoln Investments\n\naccount, which is not the subject matter of the finding.\n\n      Scott testified that a week prior to giving testimony on September 16, 2013,\n\nhe became aware that during the 1st quarter of 2010, he received mileage checks\n\ntotaling $150, and that Lea should receive 50% of that amount. (RR 5:140)\n\n      Findings 22, 23 & 24 – Oklahoma Property\n\n      The evidence concerning a deed to the Oklahoma property was not\n\nconflicting, as Lea asserts; on any of the 5 days of trial, she could not produce a\n\ncopy of a deed that she had sent to Scott for signature. (RR 3:102-103) Lea\n\nfurther admitted that she “had no idea” whether she checked into the deed issue\n\n\n\n\n                                         58\n\fbefore filing suit about it. Id. Scott agrees that Lea did not send a deed for Scott’s\n\nsignature until after the litigation had started, on May 3, 2012.\n\n      Findings 25, 26, & 27 – Lincoln Investment\n\n      Lea has taken the position that the attempts and difficulties experienced in\n\ntransferring her portion of the Lincoln Investment account are “irrelevant”;\n\nhowever, Lea did not object as to relevance to ANY of the questions asked of her,\n\nof Scott, or of Ross concerning these items, so the objection would be waived.\n\nMoreover, the individual Lea hired to review the transfer of these funds approved\n\nRoss’ calculations of the division. (RR 4:79). The fact that Lea delayed in\n\nproviding an account into which assets should be transferred is undisputed. Scott\n\nand Ross tried for nearly 2 years to receive the information from her (RR 4:81),\n\nand she did not complain about any of the calculations until August, 2012. (See\n\nPE 19).\n\n      Lea testified that: (i) she hired Allen Weiner, a third party, to assist with\n\ndividing the Lincoln account (RR 3:81); (ii) she refused to sign documents that\n\nwould have transferred her share of the Lincoln account to her (RR 3:78); (iii) she\n\n“had no idea” that the funds could not be transferred to her without her providing\n\naccount information (RR 3:85); (iv) she – finally – admitted that she did not\n\nprovide an account into which her share could be transferred until August, 2012\n\n(RR 3:85), (v) she was no longer pursuing a claim against Scott related to the\n\n\n\n                                          59\n\fLincoln account (RR 3:86), and (vi) she had “no idea” how much money Scott had\n\nspent on lawyers dealing with that issue (RR 3:87).\n\n      Lea has not cited any evidence of the “more accurate percentage” for which\n\nshe was hoping by filing suit.\n\n      Findings 28 & 29 – Reasonable Inquiry\n\n      Scott has reviewed evidence in support of these findings, above, in Section\n\nI.B., and disagrees that these findings are not the basis for sanctions. See Scott &\n\nWhite, 940 S.W.2d at 596 (Tex. 1996).\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\n\n      Lea’s suit was frivolous and brought in bad faith because she did not make\n\nadequate inquiry into the facts prior to filing, and even after she learned that the\n\nfacts may not be as she believed, she and her lawyer continued to pursue a trial\n\nregarding Lea’s spurious claims. The Sanctions Order and the Findings of Fact are\n\nsufficiently specific to support sanctions. Sufficient evidence exists to support the\n\nFindings of Fact, the sanctions ordered, and the entry of a take nothing judgment\n\ndenying Lea’s claims. For these reasons, the judgment of the trial court should be\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         60\n\f                        Respectfully submitted,\n                        FLOWERS & FRANKFORT,\n                            ATTORNEYS AT LAW\n\n                        By: /s/ Todd Frankfort\n                               TODD FRANKFORT\n                               State Bar No. 00790711\n                               RICHARD L.

I have not\n     heard back from you.\n\n            This is another effort at resolving this matter and to m1mm1ze the time and\n     unnecessary expenses accruing in concluding this matter. I am confident that if you'll\n     call me back we can coordinate an agreeable date and time to exchange the following\n     documents and other things necessary to end this.\n\n            Outstanding issues as per your February 1, 2011 letter:\n\n            1. Scott will exchange the diamond given to Lea by Patrick Brannan for his\n               Rolex watch.\n\n            2. Scott does not have any coins belonging to Lea or Christopher;\n\n            3. Scott will execute a quitclaim deed for the Oklahoma property if you provide\n               one;\n\n            4. Scott doesn't have the First Colony life insurance policy number 5164362;\n\n            5. Scott's financial advisor, Ross Mclaurin, had been working with Lea's\n               financial advisor, Allen Weiner, to transfer Lea's share of the Lincoln account\n               ending 0305. That effort apparently broke down when Lea refused to provide\n               information for an account where she wants her share of the Lincoln account\n                                      g;    EXHIBIT\n                                      ~\n\n                                      i fl-.~2\n\f1\\   ~   _   r'\\ -   ·- • -   I    I   I   ___ I . .   .

Scott has executed forms Bucky Allshouse sent for transferring the savings\n                        bonds. Copies of those documents were sent to Mr. Allshouse . If you want\n                        Scott to sign different forms, please provide the completed forms and we'll\n                        exchange them for Scott's bonds that Lea has and similar transfer documents\n                        signed by Lea .\n\n                     7 . Scott does not have any keys to Lea's Lexus GX4 70;\n\n                     8. Bonus/reimbursement        Documents reflecting · Scott's bonuses and\n                        reimbursements were previously provided and additional copies are attached\n                        for your convenience. Scott received no reimbursements during the period in\n                        question.\n\n                              On May 28, 2010 Scott received a bonus from GHA in the amount of\n                              $12,648.31. I understand that on the date the divorce decree was entered\n                              Lea received a $6,877.47 check, which is $553.32 more than half of the\n                              bonus . She was reportedly upset that day about the amount of the check.\n                              However, she accepted and negotiated the check.\n\n                              Scott's now aware of the overpayment. Scott offers to allow Lea to let keep\n                              the overpayment if that ends this matter. If that's not agreeable, Lea owes\n                              Scott $553 .32 .\n\n                     9. Scott doesn't have a document listing the contents of the safe deposit boxes\n                        at BBVA Compass or Wells Fargo Bank as of September 3, 2010;\n\n                     10. Scott has previously offered to make the Christmas ornaments, Gibson\n                         plates, and stuffed animals available for Lea to pick up but she never\n                         arranged to do so . Let us know when she wants to do that.\n\n                     11 . We will also arrange to have the family photographs and videos delivered to a\n                          commercial copying service for duplication . Let us know which service Lea\n                          wants to use . Each party is responsible for half of the copying charges.\n\n                     12. Finally, page 12 of the AID states the amount Scott received for his 2009 tax\n                         refund : $31,943 .00 . Lea was provided with a copy of the U.S. Treasury\n                         Department refund check. Lea received a check for $16,000.00 when the\n                         decree was entered. The amount owed is a sum certain and Lea accepted\n                         the check. It's outside the scope of discovery to request Scott's tax return.\n\fIVIr. Oan1e1   J.   LemKUII\n\nPage   I3\n               However, in a further effort to settle this matter Scott offers to provide a copy\n               of his tax return in exchange for a copy of Lea's. If she received a refund she\n               never disclosed such to Scott. Again, he's willing to let that go it we can end\n               this.\n\n       I hope you'll view this as I do - a simple matter of coordinating the exchange of\nproperty. Thank you for your assistance in wrapping this up. I look forward to hearing\nfrom you soon.\n\n\n\n\nLCB:dmh\nEnclosure\n\ncc:     ScottS.
