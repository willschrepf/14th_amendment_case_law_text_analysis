The district court dismissed\nBertha’s suit with prejudice because of perceived deficiencies in his original complaint.\n\n\n      *\n         We have agreed to decide the case without oral argument because the briefs and\nrecord adequately present the facts and legal arguments, and oral argument would not\nsignificantly aid the court. FED. R. APP. P. 34(a)(2)(A)(C).\n\fNo. 16-3916                                                                        Page 2\n\nBy then, however, Bertha had filed, as a matter of course, an amended complaint that\nthe district judge refused to consider. Because the judge did not have discretion to\nignore Bertha’s amended complaint, we vacate the dismissal and remand for further\nproceedings.\n\n        Bertha twice was arrested in October 2013 when he tried to enter the\nKane County jail to visit a client after being told to leave. He was charged with trespass\nin separate cases. During the criminal proceedings he personally drafted and submitted\nmotions and letters crudely berating and threatening the participating judges. He then\nwas charged with criminal contempt. Questions about Bertha’s competence have\ndelayed the criminal proceedings significantly, and all three cases remain ongoing in\none way or another. As best we can tell, he was convicted and served an eight-month\nsentence for criminal contempt, but a judge vacated that conviction and ordered a series\nof fitness examinations and a new trial. As for the trespass cases, it appears that one of\nthem has gone to trial and resulted in a guilty verdict, but both the sentencing in that\ncase and further proceedings in the second trespass case were delayed when Bertha was\nfound incompetent—a finding that since has been reversed.\n\n       While these state proceedings were unfolding, Bertha turned to federal court. His\noriginal complaint named as defendants the Kane County state’s attorney and his office,\nan assistant prosecutor, the Kane County sheriff’s office, eight judges, and the\nmental-health evaluator appointed to assess Bertha’s fitness to stand trial. Bertha\nalleged a litany of constitutional claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The district judge\nscreened the complaint, see 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B); Rowe v. Shake, 196 F.3d 778, 783\n(7th Cir. 1999), and allowed Bertha to proceed. The defendants did not answer the\ncomplaint. Instead (in two groups) they filed motions to dismiss under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6). The motions raised broad defenses including\nabstention, the Eleventh Amendment, judicial and prosecutorial immunity, the statute\nof limitations, and lack of personal involvement.\n\n       Ten days after the first motion to dismiss was filed, and five days after the\nsecond, Bertha filed an amended complaint. See FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a)(1)(B). He tried to\nblunt the concerns raised in the motions to dismiss by removing the offices of the state’s\nattorney and sheriff as defendants, and naming all defendants in their individual\ncapacity only. (Because of this we have amended the caption for this appeal to replace\nthe Kane County state’s attorney’s office, which Bertha removed as a defendant, with\nJudge Michael Sullivan, the first named defendant in the amended complaint.) Bertha\nalso added as defendants fifteen jail employees and other law-enforcement officers.\n\fNo. 16-3916                                                                           Page 3\n\n       The amended complaint, as clarified by its attached “memorandum of law” and\nBertha’s appellate briefs, see Williamson v. Curran, 714 F.3d 432, 436 (7th Cir. 2013); Smith\nv. Knox County Jail, 666 F.3d 1037, 1039 (7th Cir. 2012), sets forth the following\nallegations against the named defendants: (1) jail employees banned him from the Kane\nCounty jail without due process, (2) law-enforcement officers twice arrested him\nwithout probable cause for allegedly trespassing at the jail, (3) the chief judge of the\nCircuit Court of Kane County denied him due process by entering into evidence in his\ntrespass cases the letters he sent the various judges, (4) the judges and prosecutors\ndenied him due process and violated his right to free speech by bringing and entering a\nconviction on the charge of criminal contempt, (5) during his trials several\nlaw-enforcement officers physically assaulted and removed him from the Kane County\ncourthouse without cause, (6) jail employees subjected him to an unreasonable strip\nsearch while he was serving his sentence for criminal contempt, and (7) jail employees\nsubjected him to cruel and unusual punishment by placing him in segregated housing\nduring that sentence. The amended complaint seeks damages and dismissal of the\ncontempt case that is awaiting retrial.\n\n        The district judge disregarded Bertha’s amended complaint and proceeded with\na hearing on the motions to dismiss the superseded initial complaint. From the bench at\nthat hearing, the judge dismissed the original complaint, citing judicial immunity,\nprosecutorial immunity, and the ongoing state-court proceedings. The judge did not say\nanything about the substance of the particular claims but declared that Bertha’s original\ncomplaint did not “state federal jurisdiction or causes of action.” When Bertha\nreminded the judge that he had filed an amended complaint, the judge said Bertha\ncould not “file an amended complaint without leave of the Court” and, since Bertha had\nnot sought leave, there was “nothing before the Court.” Later that day the judge entered\na minute order concerning the hearing: “For the reasons stated in open court\ndefendants’ motions to Dismiss for Failure to state a Claim . . . are granted. Plaintiff is\ngranted leave to file a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. Civil case\nterminated.” Bertha responded to this minute entry by moving for leave to amend,\nwhich prompted two additional minute orders. In the first, the judge “corrected” his\nearlier entry to “strike the language granting Plaintiff leave to file an amended\ncomplaint” because, the judge said, “[t]here was no pending motion to file an amended\ncomplaint when the parties appeared before the Court.” In the second order, the judge\ndenied Bertha leave to amend his complaint, saying that Bertha’s “original complaint\nwas dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the dismissal was therefore\nwith prejudice.” Bertha then filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\fNo. 16-3916                                                                            Page 4\n\n        Bertha argues that the district judge erred by not addressing his amended\ncomplaint and by denying him leave to amend. The defendants frame this as a question\nof the district judge’s discretion to allow Bertha to amend his complaint, but that is a red\nherring. Bertha points out that, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15, a “party may\namend its pleading once as a matter of course.” Specifically, Rule 15 authorizes a party\nto amend an unanswered complaint within “21 days after service of a motion under\nRule 12(b).” FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a)(1)(B). Bertha filed his amended complaint within that\ntime limit, so permission from the judge was unnecessary. See id.; Swanigan v. City of\nChicago, 775 F.3d 953, 963 (7th Cir. 2015) (explaining that, because of Rule 15(a)(1)(B),\n“whether to allow an amendment” after an answer or motion to dismiss “was out of the\ncourt’s hands entirely”); Ramirez v. County of San Bernardino, 806 F.3d 1002, 1007–08\n(9th Cir. 2015) (describing ability to amend complaint under Rule 15(a)(1)(B) as\n“automatic right”). The amended complaint became the operative complaint, see Riley\nv. Elkhart Community Schools, 829 F.3d 886, 890 (7th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 1328\n(2017), making the pending motions to dismiss the original complaint irrelevant,\nsee Fawzy v. Wauquiez Boats SNC, 873 F.3d 451, 455 (4th Cir. 2017) (holding that district\ncourt “ruled on a mooted complaint, not the operative one” since plaintiff already had\nfiled timely amendment under Rule 15(a)(1)(B)).\n\n        We note that in Fawzy the Fourth Circuit concluded that its jurisdiction was\naffected by the identical procedural posture. 873 F.3d at 455. The Fourth Circuit\ndismissed the plaintiff’s appeal from the dismissal of his lawsuit, reasoning that there\nwas no final judgment because the district court had not addressed the amended\ncomplaint. Id. But that analysis ignores the key to finality—did the district judge finish\nwith the case? See Hernandez v. Dart, 814 F.3d 836, 840–41 (7th Cir. 2016) (noting that this\ncourt had jurisdiction over appeal given “multiple indicia that the district court was\nfinished with the case”); Martinez v. City of Chicago, 499 F.3d 721, 726 (7th Cir. 2007)\n(same). We cannot tell from the Fawzy opinion if the Fourth Circuit disagrees with our\nunderstanding of finality or if the court simply overlooked the question. But if the\nFourth Circuit meant to adopt a different standard, we reject it. Here, it is clear the\ndistrict judge was finished with Bertha’s case. The judge declared that the case was\n“terminated,” and then he later clarified that he would not allow amendments to the\ncomplaint and that the dismissal was with prejudice. We do not lack jurisdiction just\nbecause the reasoning underlying the dismissal is wrong; rather, we must correct the\nerror.\n\n        Because the district judge had never addressed Bertha’s amended complaint, he\neffectively dismissed the action sua sponte, which was error. Bertha was proceeding in\n\fNo. 16-3916                                                                            Page 5\n\nforma pauperis, so the judge could have screened the amended complaint under\n§ 1915(e)(2)(B), see Rowe, 196 F.3d at 783, and dismissed the lawsuit if that review\nshowed the case to be frivolous. But the judge did not screen the amended complaint.\nInstead the judge emphasized that the case had been dismissed with prejudice on the\nground that the court lacked “subject matter jurisdiction” over the superseded original\ncomplaint. And since the defendants had not moved to dismiss Bertha’s amended\ncomplaint, the judge could not dismiss sua sponte without first disclosing his intentions\nand giving Bertha a chance to respond. See Aljabri v. Holder, 745 F.3d 816, 819 (7th Cir.\n2014); Dawson v. Newman, 419 F.3d 656, 660 (7th Cir. 2005). Here the judge did not even\nconsider the amended complaint, much less disclose any concerns he may have had\nwith the allegations contained in it.\n\n        The district judge’s concern about subject-matter jurisdiction changes nothing. At\nthe motions hearing, the judge did not identify a specific jurisdictional bar; he said only\nthat “this Court has no jurisdiction to interfere in a state court matter” and that the\noriginal complaint did not “state federal jurisdiction or causes of action.” To the extent\nthe judge was alluding to the abstention doctrine of Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971),\nhe was mistaken—Younger concerns whether a district court might have reason to\nrefrain from exercising its jurisdiction. See Sprint Comm’cns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 134 S. Ct. 584,\n588 (2013) (noting that abstention is exception to general rule that federal courts must\nhear cases “within the scope of federal jurisdiction”); Mulholland v. Marion Cty. Election\nBd., 746 F.3d 811, 815 (7th Cir. 2014) (same). And if the judge’s reference to\nsubject-matter jurisdiction instead was directed at the Eleventh Amendment defense\nraised by some of the defendants in response to Bertha’s original complaint, see Garcia\nv. City of Chicago, 24 F.3d 966, 969 (7th Cir. 1994), Bertha already had eliminated that\ndefense by amending his complaint to name only individual defendants in their\nindividual capacity. See Peirick v. Ind. Univ.-Purdue Univ. Indianapolis Athletics Dep’t,\n510 F.3d 681, 695 (7th Cir. 2007). Thus subject-matter jurisdiction is not an obstacle.\n\n        We do not mean to suggest that Bertha’s amended complaint will allow him to\ndodge what appear to be significant defenses. Some, like absolute judicial immunity,\nare obvious, and the list likely includes Younger abstention and prosecutorial immunity.\nBut we cannot say that Bertha’s suit is frivolous, in particular some of his allegations\nagainst the law-enforcement officers working at the jail and courthouse. See Richman\nv. Sheahan, 512 F.3d 876, 881 (7th Cir. 2008) (noting that courthouse beating could\nsupport claim of excessive force if committed “maliciously and sadistically for the very\npurpose of causing harm”); Calhoun v. DeTella, 319 F.3d 936, 939 (7th Cir. 2003) (noting\nthat strip search may support Eighth Amendment claim if “conducted in a harassing\n\fNo. 16-3916                                                                       Page 6\n\nmanner intended to humiliate and inflict psychological pain”). Rather than sift through\na complaint that has never been reviewed by the district judge and might be amended\nagain with the judge’s permission, we leave it to the district judge to address Bertha’s\namended complaint and any possible defenses in the first instance. We thus express no\nopinion about these issues. See Dawson, 419 F.3d at 660.\n\n                                                          VACATED and REMANDED.\n\f",

From the bench at\nthat hearing, the judge dismissed the original complaint, citing judicial immunity,\nprosecutorial immunity, and the ongoing state-court proceedings. The judge did not say\nanything about the substance of the particular claims but declared that Bertha’s original\ncomplaint did not “state federal jurisdiction or causes of action.” When Bertha\nreminded the judge that he had filed an amended complaint, the judge said Bertha\ncould not “file an amended complaint without leave of the Court” and, since Bertha had\nnot sought leave, there was “nothing before the Court.” Later that day the judge entered\na minute order concerning the hearing: “For the reasons stated in open court\ndefendants’ motions to Dismiss for Failure to state a Claim . . . are granted. Plaintiff is\ngranted leave to file a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. Civil case\nterminated.” Bertha responded to this minute entry by moving for leave to amend,\nwhich prompted two additional minute orders. In the first, the judge “corrected” his\nearlier entry to “strike the language granting Plaintiff leave to file an amended\ncomplaint” because, the judge said, “[t]here was no pending motion to file an amended\ncomplaint when the parties appeared before the Court.” In the second order, the judge\ndenied Bertha leave to amend his complaint, saying that Bertha’s “original complaint\nwas dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the dismissal was therefore\nwith prejudice.” Bertha then filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\fNo. 16-3916                                                                            Page 4\n\n        Bertha argues that the district judge erred by not addressing his amended\ncomplaint and by denying him leave to amend. The defendants frame this as a question\nof the district judge’s discretion to allow Bertha to amend his complaint, but that is a red\nherring. Bertha points out that, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15, a “party may\namend its pleading once as a matter of course.” Specifically, Rule 15 authorizes a party\nto amend an unanswered complaint within “21 days after service of a motion under\nRule 12(b).” FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a)(1)(B). Bertha filed his amended complaint within that\ntime limit, so permission from the judge was unnecessary. See id.; Swanigan v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1328</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2017), making the pending motions to dismiss the original complaint irrelevant,\nsee Fawzy v. Wauquiez Boats SNC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 455 (4th Cir. 2017) (holding that district\ncourt “ruled on a mooted complaint, not the operative one” since plaintiff already had\nfiled timely amendment under Rule 15(a)(1)(B)).\n\n        We note that in Fawzy the Fourth Circuit concluded that its jurisdiction was\naffected by the identical procedural posture. 873 F.3d at 455. The Fourth Circuit\ndismissed the plaintiff’s appeal from the dismissal of his lawsuit, reasoning that there\nwas no final judgment because the district court had not addressed the amended\ncomplaint. Id. But that analysis ignores the key to finality—did the district judge finish\nwith the case? See Hernandez v. Dart, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 840–41 (7th Cir. 2016) (noting that this\ncourt had jurisdiction over appeal given “multiple indicia that the district court was\nfinished with the case”); Martinez v. City of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1362480\"><a href=\"/opinion/1362480/martinez-v-city-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 726 (7th Cir. 2007)\n(same). We cannot tell from the Fawzy opinion if the Fourth Circuit disagrees with our\nunderstanding of finality or if the court simply overlooked the question. But if the\nFourth Circuit meant to adopt a different standard, we reject it. Here, it is clear the\ndistrict judge was finished with Bertha’s case. The judge declared that the case was\n“terminated,” and then he later clarified that he would not allow amendments to the\ncomplaint and that the dismissal was with prejudice. We do not lack jurisdiction just\nbecause the reasoning underlying the dismissal is wrong; rather, we must correct the\nerror.\n\n        Because the district judge had never addressed Bertha’s amended complaint, he\neffectively dismissed the action sua sponte, which was error. Bertha was proceeding in\n\fNo. 16-3916                                                                            Page 5\n\nforma pauperis, so the judge could have screened the amended complaint under\n§ 1915(e)(2)(B), see Rowe, 196 F.3d at 783, and dismissed the lawsuit if that review\nshowed the case to be frivolous. But the judge did not screen the amended complaint.\nInstead the judge emphasized that the case had been dismissed with prejudice on the\nground that the court lacked “subject matter jurisdiction” over the superseded original\ncomplaint. And since the defendants had not moved to dismiss Bertha’s amended\ncomplaint, the judge could not dismiss sua sponte without first disclosing his intentions\nand giving Bertha a chance to respond. See Aljabri v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 819 (7th Cir.\n2014); Dawson v.

Here the judge did not even\nconsider the amended complaint, much less disclose any concerns he may have had\nwith the allegations contained in it.\n\n        The district judge’s concern about subject-matter jurisdiction changes nothing. At\nthe motions hearing, the judge did not identify a specific jurisdictional bar; he said only\nthat “this Court has no jurisdiction to interfere in a state court matter” and that the\noriginal complaint did not “state federal jurisdiction or causes of action.” To the extent\nthe judge was alluding to the abstention doctrine of Younger v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108263\"><a href=\"/opinion/108263/younger-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971),\nhe was mistaken—Younger concerns whether a district court might have reason to\nrefrain from exercising its jurisdiction. See Sprint Comm’cns, Inc. v. Jacobs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2645422\"><a href=\"/opinion/2645422/sprint-communications-inc-v-jacobs/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n588 (2013) (noting that abstention is exception to general rule that federal courts must\nhear cases “within the scope of federal jurisdiction”); Mulholland v. Marion Cty. Election\nBd., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">811</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 815 (7th Cir. 2014) (same). And if the judge’s reference to\nsubject-matter jurisdiction instead was directed at the Eleventh Amendment defense\nraised by some of the defendants in response to Bertha’s original complaint, see Garcia\nv. City of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670572\"><a href=\"/opinion/670572/rafael-garcia-v-city-of-chicago-illinois-anna-gall-county-of-cook/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 969 (7th Cir. 1994), Bertha already had eliminated that\ndefense by amending his complaint to name only individual defendants in their\nindividual capacity. See Peirick v. Ind. Univ.-Purdue Univ. Indianapolis Athletics Dep’t,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1389987\"><a href=\"/opinion/1389987/peirick-v-iupui-athletics-dept/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 695 (7th Cir. 2007). Thus subject-matter jurisdiction is not an obstacle.\n\n        We do not mean to suggest that Bertha’s amended complaint will allow him to\ndodge what appear to be significant defenses. Some, like absolute judicial immunity,\nare obvious, and the list likely includes Younger abstention and prosecutorial immunity.\nBut we cannot say that Bertha’s suit is frivolous, in particular some of his allegations\nagainst the law-enforcement officers working at the jail and courthouse. See Richman\nv. Sheahan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1445974\"><a href=\"/opinion/1445974/richman-v-sheahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 881 (7th Cir. 2008) (noting that courthouse beating could\nsupport claim of excessive force if committed “maliciously and sadistically for the very\npurpose of causing harm”); Calhoun v. DeTella, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780878\"><a href=\"/opinion/780878/tyrone-calhoun-v-george-e-detella/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">936</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 939 (7th Cir. 2003) (noting\nthat strip search may support Eighth Amendment claim if “conducted in a harassing\n\fNo. 16-3916                                                                       Page 6\n\nmanner intended to humiliate and inflict psychological pain”). Rather than sift through\na complaint that has never been reviewed by the district judge and might be amended\nagain with the judge’s permission, we leave it to the district judge to address Bertha’s\namended complaint and any possible defenses in the first instance. We thus express no\nopinion about these issues. See Dawson, 419 F.3d at 660.\n\n                                                          VACATED and REMANDED.\n\f</pre>",
