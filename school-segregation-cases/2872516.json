The parties are familiar with the facts, so we will not set forth the\n\fcase’s history in detail. In summary, Lock filed his complaint1 pursuant to Bivens v. Six\n\nUnknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), regarding\n\nevents while he was housed at FCI-Schuylkill. Specifically, his claims are based on\n\nincidents on January 24, 2002 and May 8, 2003, when he was sexually assaulted by other\n\ninmates; in October 2002, when his request for a transfer to another prison was denied;\n\nand during 2002 and 2003, when he spent a prolonged period in segregation. Lock\n\nsought damages and injunctive relief. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the\n\ncomplaint, arguing, inter alia, that Lock failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, as\n\nrequired by 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). Lock filed a response. The District Court dismissed\n\nthe complaint, finding that Lock failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Lock\n\nappeals and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. We have\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n       Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), exhaustion of administrative\n\nremedies is required for all actions concerning prison conditions brought under federal\n\nlaw. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 227 (3d Cir. 2004). In Spruill,\n\nwe held that the PLRA required “proper” exhaustion, meaning that the inmate must\n\nfollow the procedural requirements of the prison grievance system. Spruill, 372 F.3d at\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        As noted by the District Court, Lock originally filed his complaint on January\n14, 2004, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The matter\nwas transferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a) to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,\nthen was transferred again to the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\n\n                                             2\n\f228, 231. If the prisoner fails to follow the procedural requirements, then his claims are\n\nprocedurally defaulted.\n\n       Under the Federal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) administrative remedy procedures,\n\nan inmate must first submit an attempt at informal resolution to his unit team. 28 C.F.R.\n\n§ 542.13(a). If the concern is not resolved, the inmate may submit an administrative\n\nremedy request to the Warden, then to the BOP Regional Director, then to the BOP\n\nCentral Office. 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.14-15. Informal resolution and submission of a formal\n\nwritten Administrative Remedy Request, on the appropriate form (BP-9), must be\n\ncompleted within twenty calendar days after the incident date. 28 C.F.R. § 542.14(a).\n\n       As relevant to this case, although the record contains documentation relating to the\n\nfactual background of his other claims, Lock attempted to pursue administrative remedies\n\nwith respect to only the May 8, 2003 sexual assault. The twenty-day period for\n\nsubmitting an administrative remedy request expired on May 28, 2003. However, Lock\n\nwaited until June 4, 2003, when he submitted a request to prison staff, stating that he\n\nwished to begin the administrative remedy process regarding the May 8, 2003 incident.\n\nHe filed a request for relief to the Northeast Regional Office. On June 18, 2003, the\n\nRegional Office rejected the submission, explaining that it had been submitted to the\n\nwrong level and should have been filed at the institution. Lock filed at the institutional\n\nlevel an unsuccessful informal resolution request, followed by a request for administrative\n\nremedy on July 31, 2003. The request was rejected as untimely. Lock then attempted to\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fappeal to the Regional Office. He asserted that in June 2003, a prison officer asked him\n\nto defer his filing, and in July 2003, that same officer told him he had plenty of time to\n\nfile his complaint. The Regional Office rejected the appeal as untimely. Lock attempted\n\nto appeal to BOP Central Office, which rejected the appeal as untimely, concurring with\n\nthe prison’s and Regional Office’s reasons for rejecting Lock’s filings.\n\n       Upon careful review of the record, we agree with the District Court that Lock\n\nfailed to exhaust his administrative remedies. We also agree that Lock’s reliance on a\n\nprison officer’s advice in June and July 2003 to delay his filings is unavailing, because\n\nthe twenty-day period for filing an administrative remedy request had already passed by\n\nthen. We discern no error in the dismissal of Lock’s complaint on the basis of failure to\n\nexhaust under section 1997e(a).\n\n       We will dismiss this appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f",
