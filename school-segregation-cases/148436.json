This appeal arises from the district court’s 1995 decision to terminate its\n\njurisdiction over the School District, finding the School District had eliminated\n\nthe vestiges of de jure discrimination to the extent practicable. Appellants\n\nWilfred Keyes and others 1 (”Appellants”) do not appeal the termination of\n\njurisdiction, but rather appeal the district court’s decision insofar as it opined\n\nupon the constitutionality of Article IX, Section 8 of the Colorado Constitution\n\n(“the Busing Clause”) and two Colorado statutory provisions. See Colo. Rev.\n\nStat. §§ 22-36-101(3), 22-30.5-104(3). Those issues, however, are not justiciable.\n\nAs a consequence, there is no case or controversy as required by Article III,\n\nSection 2 of the United States Constitution, and this appeal is dismissed for lack\n\nof jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       The district court removed the claims of the Congress of Hispanic\nEducators to a separate and independent civil action under the Equal Educational\nOpportunities Act of 1974. See Keyes v. Congress of Hispanic Educators, 902 F.\nSupp. 1274, 1275 (D. Colo. 1995).\n\f                               I. BACKGROUND\n\n      This case originated in June of 1969, when children in the Denver public\n\nschools challenged the School District’s deliberate policy of racial segregation.\n\nSee Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, 303 F. Supp. 279 (D. Colo. 1969). Since that\n\nchallenge, this case has evolved through several stages of litigation during which\n\nthis and other courts have rendered numerous opinions. 2 A brief summary of the\n\nhistory of the case provides necessary context.\n\n      From 1960 through 1969, the School District established and maintained de\n\njure segregation in the Denver public schools. Keyes XIX, 902 F. Supp. 1274,\n\n\n      2\n       See Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, 303 F. Supp. 279 (D. Colo. 1969) (“Keyes\nI”), modified, 303 F. Supp. 289 (D.

Colo. 1995) (“Keyes XIX”).\n\n                                        -7-\n\f1276 (D. Colo. 1995). In 1969 and 1970, the district court found that the School\n\nDistrict had engaged in seven specific de jure segregative acts by attempting to\n\nmaintain predominantly white schools in the Park Hill neighborhood. See Keyes\n\nXIX, 902 F. Supp. 1274, 1278 (D. Colo. 1995) (citing Keyes I, 303 F. Supp. 279,\n\n282-85 (D. Colo. 1969); Keyes II, 303 F. Supp. 289, 295 (D. Colo. 1969); Keyes\n\nIV, 313 F. Supp. 61 (D. Colo., 1970)). As a consequence, it ordered a\n\ndesegregation plan for the Park Hill area schools in 1970. Keyes V, 313 F. Supp.\n\n90, 96-99 (10th Cir. 1970).\n\n      On appeal, the United States Supreme Court broadened the scope of the\n\ndistrict court’s jurisdiction. Instead of limiting the desegregation plan to the Park\n\nHill area, the Supreme Court determined that the entire Denver school system was\n\na dual system 3 requiring desegregation. Keyes VII, 413 U.S. 189, 201-02 (1973).\n\nThus, in 1974, the district court ordered a city-wide desegregation plan. See\n\nKeyes XIX, 902 F. Supp. at 1279. This court, however, found that plan\n\ninadequate. Keyes X, 521 F.2d 465, 475-79 (10th Cir. 1975). Finally in 1976, the\n\n\n      3\n        The Supreme Court stated: “[W]here plaintiffs prove that the school\nauthorities have carried out a systematic program of segregation affecting a\nsubstantial portion of the students, schools, teachers, and facilities within the\nschool system, it is only common sense to conclude that there exists a predicate\nfor a finding of the existence of a dual system.” Keyes VII, 413 U.S. at 201. On\nremand, the district court conducted a second trial and concluded: “The Supreme\nCourt’s viewpoint based on the record before it is that the Denver school system\nis a dual system. There can be no doubt as to its view . . . .” Keyes VIII, 368 F.\nSupp. at 210.\n\n                                          -8-\n\fparties agreed to a remedial plan which was approved and implemented. See\n\nKeyes XIX, 902 F. Supp. at 1279. The remedial plan required, among other\n\nthings, pairing elementary schools, changing attendance zones, establishing\n\npercentage ratios of Anglo to minority students, and transporting students by bus\n\nto implement the plan. Id.\n\n      Following the implementation of the remedial plan, the School District\n\npassed Resolution 2233 to direct continued desegregation efforts. In 1984, the\n\nSchool District moved to terminate the court’s jurisdiction. Keyes XIV, 609 F.\n\nSupp. 1491, 1518-20 (D. Colo. 1985). The district court denied the motion,\n\nfinding the School District had not yet achieved unitary status and that Resolution\n\n2233 was too vague. Id.\n\n      In an effort to remedy the vagueness of Resolution 2233, the School\n\nDistrict passed Resolution 2314 in 1987. Resolution 2314 called for continuing\n\nteacher assignment and student transfer policies that enhanced integration and\n\nrequired annual reports of progress toward achieving a unitary school district.\n\nThe School District again sought to terminate jurisdiction and the court again\n\nrefused. Instead, the court authorized existing plans to remedy the vestiges of\n\npast discrimination and ordered a meeting with counsel to issue a permanent\n\ninjunction against the School District. Keyes XVI, 653 F. Supp. 1536, 1539-40,\n\n42 (D. Colo. 1987). Still later that same year, the court entered an Interim\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fDecree, superseding all prior remedial actions. Keyes XVII, 670 F. Supp. at 1516-\n\n17. That decree diminished the court’s jurisdiction by freeing the School District\n\nto make changes in its existing plans to accommodate new situations. Id.\n\n      On appeal, this court affirmed the denials of the motions to terminate\n\njurisdiction, but invalidated some portions of the Interim Decree which merely\n\nrequired the School District to obey the law. See Keyes XIX, 902 F. Supp. at\n\n1281; Keyes XVIII, 895 F.2d 659, 666-69 (10th Cir. 1990). The School District\n\nthus remained under the district court’s jurisdiction to remedy past discrimination,\n\nbut could develop its own plans to do so. See Keyes XIX, 902 F. Supp. at 1281.\n\n      In 1992 the School District moved again to terminate the district court’s\n\njurisdiction. See id. at 1275. This time Appellants requested the court to rule on\n\nthe constitutionality of Colorado’s Busing Clause before it decided whether to\n\nterminate jurisdiction. 4 The Busing Clause, Article IX, Section 8 of the Colorado\n\nConstitution, provides in pertinent part that no school pupil shall “be assigned or\n\ntransported to any public educational institution for the purpose of achieving\n\nracial balance.” Appellants asserted that after termination of the court’s\n\n\n      4\n        Appellants argued the district court should not completely terminate its\njurisdiction. Although Appellants agreed that “the indicia of de jure segregation\nha[d] been removed from student assignments, faculty, staff, transportation, extra\ncurricular activities and facilities,” they requested the court retain residual control\nover the School District on the ground that vestiges of the dual system remained\nin the form of racial disparity in discipline, drop-out rates, and gifted and talented\nprograms.\n\n                                         -10-\n\fjurisdiction, the Busing Clause would impede the School District’s ability to\n\nimplement Resolutions 2233 and 2314 and other policies adopted to change pupil\n\nassignments. Keyes XIX, 902 F. Supp. at 1275.\n\n      The School District agreed with that claim and stipulated that the School\n\nDistrict’s plans would conflict with the Busing Clause. Id. at 1275, 1283.\n\nAppellants also requested a determination of the constitutionality of certain\n\nsections of two Colorado statutory provisions: The Colorado Public Schools of\n\nChoice Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. § 22-36-101(3)(d), and the Colorado Charter Schools\n\nAct, Colo. Rev. Stat. § 22-30.5-104(3). The Attorney General of the State of\n\nColorado was allowed to intervene and defend the validity of the Busing Clause.\n\nKeyes XIX, 902 F. Supp at 1275.\n\n      In a comprehensive opinion based on evidence received during hearings on\n\nAugust 23-25, 1994, the district court granted the School District’s motion to\n\nterminate jurisdiction, stating the School District had complied with the\n\ndesegregation decrees and that past de jure segregation had been eliminated to the\n\nextent practicable. Id. at 1275, 1285, 1308-09. Additionally, the district court\n\nfound that the School District’s existing policies did not conflict with the Busing\n\nClause. Id. at 1285. In dicta, the court passed upon the issue of the\n\nconstitutionality of the Busing Clause itself, indicating that it is consistent with\n\nthe 14th Amendment. Id. The district court stated that its consideration of the\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fBusing Clause issue was “to guide the District upon termination of . . .\n\njurisdiction.” Id. at 1275. The district court did not decide whether the Colorado\n\nSchools of Choice Act and the Charter Schools Act are valid under the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, stating only: “Comment on each\n\n[of the state and federal statutory requirements which the School District must\n\nnow follow] is inappropriate, and this court may not give advisory opinions.” Id.\n\nat 1285.\n\n      It is from the district court’s decision that Appellants now appeal.\n\nAppellants do not, however, appeal the termination of jurisdiction. They instead\n\nargue that the district court’s opinion was ambiguous 5 and, to the extent that the\n\nissue was actually decided, appeal any determination that the Busing Clause, the\n\nPublic Schools of Choice Act, and the Charter Schools Act are constitutional. 6\n\n      5\n        After the district court’s decision was issued in 1995, Appellants made a\nMotion for Clarification pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(b). Specifically,\nAppellants requested clarification regarding whether the district court had\ndetermined the School District could or could not maintain its existing plans in\nlight of the Busing Clause. In denying the motion, the district court stated that its\nopinion “resolved the only question properly presented on the record before it\nregarding the validity of the Busing Clause under the United States Constitution.\nTo extend the findings and conclusions in the manner suggested would violate the\nprohibition against rendering advisory opinions.”\n      6\n        The district court was correct to refuse to address the constitutionality of\nthe Public Schools of Choice Act and the Charter Schools Act, and we likewise\ndo not address them in this opinion. For the same reason this court does not have\njurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of the Busing Clause, we cannot\npass upon the constitutionality of the Public Schools of Choice Act or the Charter\nSchools Act. As is further elucidated below, the only justiciable issue before the\n\n                                         -12-\n\f                                   II. ANALYSIS\n\n      This appeal presents serious issues concerning the court’s jurisdiction.\n\nUnder Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution, federal courts are\n\ncourts of limited jurisdiction. Superimposed upon the specified subject matter of\n\nfederal court jurisdiction is the general limitation of that jurisdiction to cases or\n\ncontroversies. See U.S. Const. art. III, § 2; United States National Bank of\n\nOregon v. Independent Insur. Agents of America, 508 U.S. 439, 446 (1993). The\n\nconstitutional case or controversy requirement for federal court jurisdiction in\n\nturn includes the necessity of justiciability, the very issue before the court in this\n\nappeal. See Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 95 (1968).\n\n      The Memorandum Opinion and Order of the district court elaborately\n\nprovides the context for consideration of this court’s jurisdiction under Article III\n\nand the referenced restrictions on that jurisdiction. Both the format and content\n\nof the district court’s opinion is instructive. The format includes three sections:\n\n“History;” “The Future;” and “Findings of Fact,” analyzing the status of the\n\nSchool District as of the August, 1994 hearing. Keyes XIX, 902 F. Supp. at 1276,\n\n1282, 1286. While there is necessary overlap in the various sections of the\n\n\n\n\ndistrict court was whether or not to terminate jurisdiction. Any additional\ndiscussion of the constitutionality of either the Busing Clause or Colorado\nstatutes is merely advisory “to guide the district upon termination of . . .\njurisdiction.” Keyes XIX at 1275. Such “guidance” is dicta.\n\n                                          -13-\n\fdistrict court’s opinion, it essentially divides this case and the desegregation of\n\nthe School District into the past, the present, and the future. Those time frames\n\nare critical in this court’s consideration of jurisdiction.\n\n      The district court was charged with the obligation to determine whether the\n\nSchool District had complied in good faith with the court’s various desegregation\n\ndecrees, had eliminated to the extent practicable the vestiges and effects of its\n\npast discriminatory acts, and had thereby altered the Denver schools from a\n\nsegregated dual system to unitary status. See Board of Educ. v. Dowell, 498 U.S.\n\n237, 245-50 (1991). As a consequence, it was necessary to analyze the present in\n\nlight of the past. The district court resolved the issues in favor of the School\n\nDistrict. The district court further held that the pupil assignment plan in place at\n\nthe time of the hearing did not violate the Busing Clause. Keyes XIX, 902 F. Supp\n\nat 1285. The court held that the School District’s motivation in implementing the\n\nplan was the eradication of segregation vestiges, rather than the achievement of\n\nracial balance, which would be prohibited by the Busing Clause. Id.\n\n      Beyond addressing the past and present, the district court considered the\n\nBusing Clause in the future. Having resolved that the School District’s pupil\n\nassignment plan did not conflict with the Colorado Busing Clause, the court\n\nnevertheless unnecessarily opined that the clause was consistent with the\n\n\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fFourteenth Amendment. Id. 7 The court also opined that the Busing Clause and\n\nrelated education statutes will provide challenges to the School District and will\n\nbe fodder for future litigation. Id. at 1283. The district court, however, chose not\n\nto comment further on the effect or applicability of federal or state statutes,\n\npremising its reticence on the prohibition of advisory opinions. Id. at 1285.\n\n      A. RIPENESS\n\n      Adhering to the district court’s past, present and future format, we address\n\nAppellants’ claims. Specifically, Appellants only challenge the district court’s\n\ndicta concerning the future. Appellants do not challenge any of the court’s\n\nrulings with respect to the present. They neither challenge the district court’s\n\ndecision to terminate jurisdiction, 8 nor do they appear to challenge the district\n\ncourt’s statement that the School District’s policies in effect at the time of the\n\nAugust, 1995 hearing did not conflict with the Busing Clause. 9 Appellants’ sole\n\n\n      7\n       The district court stated: “The Busing Clause is preceded by a prohibition\non the use of race or color in making any distinction or classification of pupils.\nThat is entirely consistent with the 14th Amendment.” Keyes XIX, 902 F. Supp. at\n1285.\n      8\n       In their Opening Brief, Appellants state: “The district court, over the\nlimited objections of the plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors, granted the School\nDistrict’s Motion to Terminate Jurisdiction and issued a final Judgment\ndismissing the case. No parties are appealing from that determination.”\nAppellant Br. at 6 (citation omitted).\n      9\n       Rather than specifically appealing the latter determination, Appellants\nargue that it is unclear whether the district court found there was a conflict\nbetween the School District’s policies and the Busing Clause and ask this court to\n\n                                         -15-\n\frequest is that this court resolve whether the Busing Clause is constitutional, an\n\nissue for the future.\n\n      The case or controversy requirement of Article III admonishes federal\n\ncourts to avoid “premature adjudication” and to abstain from “entangling\n\nthemselves in abstract disagreements.” Abbott Lab. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136,\n\n148 (1967). “[T]he doctrine of ripeness is intended to forestall judicial\n\ndeterminations of disputes until the controversy is presented in clean-cut and\n\nconcrete form.” Trierweiler v. Croxton & Trench Holding Corp., 90 F.3d 1523,\n\n1545 (10th Cir. 1996) (quoting New Mexicans for Bill Richardson v. Gonzales, 64\n\nF.3d 1495, 1499 (10th Cir. 1995) (citations and quotations omitted)).\n\n      Ripeness is a question of law, reviewed de novo. See New Mexicans for\n\nBill Richardson v. Gonzalez, 64 F.3d 1495, 1499 (10th Cir. 1995) (citing Powder\n\nRiver Basin Resource Council v. Babbitt, 54 F.3d 1477, 1483 (10th Cir. 1995)).\n\nAs a jurisdictional prerequisite, ripeness may be examined by this court sua\n\nsponte. See Metropolitan Wash. Airports Auth. v. Citizens for the Abatement of\n\nAircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U.S. 252, 265 n.13 (1991). The resolution of ripeness\n\n\n\n\n“resolve the ambiguity.” Appellant Reply Br. at 12. We have difficulty\nunderstanding the thrust of this argument, in light of the district court’s\nunequivocal statement: “The pupil assignment plan in effect at the time of the\nAugust, 1994 hearing does not violate the Busing Clause because it was not\nadopted for the purpose of achieving racial balance.” Keyes XIX, 902 F. Supp. at\n1285.\n\n                                         -16-\n\f“requir[es] us to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and\n\nthe hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.” Abbott, 387 U.S.\n\nat 149. This court must therefore apply the ripeness factors of fitness and\n\nhardship to the sole issue appealed, the constitutionality of the Busing Clause.\n\n      Appellants and the School District requested that the district court resolve\n\nthe constitutionality of the Busing Clause in order to guide the School District for\n\nthe future after the termination of jurisdiction. 10 The parties essentially stipulated\n\nto the existence of a conflict between the School District’s policies and the\n\nBusing Clause in order to receive a ruling on the constitutionality of the clause.\n\nThe parties, however, cannot create a case or controversy simply by agreement.\n\nSee Wilson v. Glenwood Intermountain Properties, Inc., 98 F.3d 590, 593 (10th\n\nCir. 1996) (finding “parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on the courts\n\nby agreement”).\n\n      Appellants did not challenge an extant School District policy, nor did they\n\nclaim the Busing Clause caused the School District to refrain from adopting a\n\nspecific policy. Rather, they requested the district court to render an opinion in a\n\n\n\n      10\n        The School District sought “to remove [the Busing Clause] as a possible\nobstacle to terminating jurisdiction over the District and to clarify what the\nDistrict’s duties would be once jurisdiction was terminated.” The School District\nacknowledged in its brief that it is now satisfied that by terminating jurisdiction\nand stating that there was no conflict between any extant policies and the Busing\nClause, the district court’s opinion resolved both matters.\n\n                                          -17-\n\fvacuum. Any statement by the district court in response, however, was\n\nnecessarily dicta. 11\n\n       Constitutional analysis requires the application of the challenged provision\n\nin a case or controversy. Appellants’ failure to appeal rulings relevant to the\n\npresent and failure to reference a conflict between the Busing Clause and an\n\nactual or proposed School District policy deprives the analysis of a case or\n\ncontroversy within which to test the clause’s constitutionality. See Wilson, 98\n\nF.3d at 594 (because plaintiffs did not appeal district court’s denial of claims of\n\nreligious discrimination in housing, a case or controversy surrounding gender\n\n\n\n\n       11\n         During oral arguments, Timothy M. Tymkovich, Solicitor General for the\nState of Colorado, acknowledged that the decision to terminate jurisdiction could\nhave been made without a discussion of the constitutionality of the Busing\nClause:\n              The Court: Could the district court in your view have\n       terminated jurisdiction without passing on the constitutional\n       questions?\n              Mr. Tymkovich: Yes. In fact we argued--that was our lead\n       argument below to Judge Matsch. We thought that a future problem\n       of the Busing Clause on Denver School District’s post-Keyes conduct\n       was a case for another day, so we asked Judge Matsch not to rule on\n       the constitutionality. We said it was irrelevant to the finding of\n       unitary status . . . .\n              ....\n              Mr. Tymkovich: I think the court made that clear in his\n       response on the motion to clarify because he said that for him to\n       comment on the post-decree conduct of the school district would be\n       advisory--and by that I mean dicta.\n\n                                        -18-\n\fdiscrimination claims was lacking). As a consequence, the issue is not fit for a\n\njudicial resolution and lacks ripeness. See Abbott, 387 U.S. at 149.\n\n      Appellants argue that the Busing Clause prevents or has prevented the\n\nSchool District and individual schools from instituting any potential voluntary\n\nintegration plans based on race. They argue that this exemplifies a violation of\n\nthe Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by interdicting benefits,\n\nsuch as integration plans, to citizens when those benefits are based solely on race.\n\nAppellants, however, make no effort to establish that any particular school desires\n\nto implement voluntary integration plans, let alone that any school has been\n\ndeterred by the Busing Clause from implementing such a plan. This court cannot\n\nspeculate whether any school will propose an integration plan, what the plan\n\nmight be, and thus whether such a plan is prohibited by Colorado’s Busing\n\nClause. Appellants have failed to present this court with any specific integration\n\nproposal to juxtapose with the Busing Clause. Moreover, the State of Colorado\n\nhas expressly and unequivocally conceded that it has no plans to challenge the\n\nSchool District’s existing policies, thus confirming the absence of a case or\n\ncontroversy. 12\n\n\n      12\n         The following colloquy between this court and Mr. Tymkovich occurred\nat oral argument:\n              The Court: Are you then saying on behalf of the State of\n       Colorado that Colorado does not believe that the present programs in\n       effect which involve busing in the Denver School District constitute\n\n                                         -19-\n\f      This court may not speculate about future conflicts between the Busing\n\nClause and the School District’s policies, but rather must focus its analysis on any\n\ncontroversy as it exists today. See Sierra Club v. Yuetter, 911 F.2d 1405, 1416\n\n(10th Cir. 1990) (holding court must avoid “decision where the harm [is]\n\ncontingent upon uncertain or speculative future administrative action”). Because\n\nAppellants cannot demonstrate a present controversy, we lack jurisdiction to hear\n\nthis appeal.\n\n      B. STANDING\n\n      For many of the same reasons this case is not ripe for review, Appellants do\n\nnot have standing to appeal. Standing is a threshold, jurisdictional issue. Doyle\n\nv. Oklahoma Bar Ass’n, 998 F.2d 1559, 1566 (10th Cir. 1993). “[A] plaintiff\n\nmust maintain standing at all times throughout the litigation for a court to retain\n\n\n\n      busing for the purpose of achieving racial balance?\n             Mr. Tymkovich: Yes, your Honor. I want to be very clear\n      about that because I think what we’re talking about is a potential\n      issue for another day as to whether the school district has\n      impermissibly intruded on the commands of the Busing Clause. . . .\n      We don’t believe that the school district today is violating those\n      provisions of law. . . .\n             ....\n             . . . The Court: My question now is, under the practices and\n      policies now in effect, the State of Colorado, are they committing\n      that they will not challenge those under the state constitutional\n      provision prohibiting busing for the purpose of achieving racial\n      balance?\n             Mr. Tymkovich: As we understand those policies today, your\n      Honor, the answer is “no.”\n\n                                         -20-\n\fjurisdiction.” Powder River, 54 F.3d at 1485 (finding that when plaintiff no\n\nlonger has injury, Article III requirements of case or controversy are no longer\n\nmet).\n\n        To have standing, plaintiffs “must have suffered an ‘injury-in-fact.’”\n\nClajon Production Corp. v. Petera, 70 F.3d 1566, 1572 (10th Cir. 1995) (quoting\n\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)). This injury-in-fact\n\nelement in turn requires plaintiffs to demonstrate “an invasion of a legally\n\nprotected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or\n\nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (citations and\n\nquotations omitted).\n\n        The impediments to ripeness are equally impediments to standing. This\n\ncourt’s focus is on past and present injury; possible future injury is insufficient to\n\ncreate standing. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61. Appellants have failed to\n\ndemonstrate that the School District or any school has withdrawn policies,\n\ninstituted policies, or refrained from withdrawing or instituting policies as a result\n\nof the Busing Clause. 13 Consequently, any injury flowing from the application of\n\n\n\n        Although not reflected in the record, the School District has begun\n        13\n\ndismantling aspects of its prior plans which involved race-based pupil assignment\nor transportation. Appellants suggest that the only reason the School District has\nbegun dismantling its existing policies is because of a perceived conflict with the\nBusing Clause. They offer no support for this reasoning, and Michael H. Jackson,\ncounsel for the School District, expressly denied at oral argument any nexus\nbetween the Busing Clause and the dismantling of any plan or program:\n\n                                          -21-\n\fthe Busing Clause constitutes possible future injury, not past or present injury.\n\nAppellants thus lack standing. 14\n\n\n\n\n             The Court: Does the existence of the Busing Clause cause the\n      district to feel compelled to dismantle any remedial plan in effect?\n             Mr. Jackson: I do not believe so.\n             The Court: So you’re representing that the district feels no\n      compulsion from the presence of the Busing Clause, either on its face\n      or as applied?\n             Mr. Jackson: That’s correct.\n             The Court: So any fears that Mr. Greiner or his clients have\n      would not be fears based on the present, they would be fears based\n      upon the as yet, inchoate, future?\n             Mr. Jackson: I believe that’s true and I believe that the\n      arguments of Mr. Greiner and Mr. Tymkovich this morning confirm\n      that.\n      14\n         Appellants’ final argument in their attempt to create standing is indeed\ncreative. They argue that any statements about the constitutionality of the Busing\nClause in the district court’s opinion could be used by the State of Colorado and\nthe School District under the doctrines of claim preclusion or issue preclusion to\nprevent further litigation over the Busing Clause. Claim preclusion bars claims\nwhen “the prior action involved identical claims and the same parties or their\nprivies.” Frandsen v. Westinghouse Corp., 46 F.3d 975, 978 (10th Cir. 1995).\nOn the other hand, issue preclusion can bar future litigation even when the parties\nare not identical. Id.\n       It is true that the district court’s opinion contains a discussion regarding the\nconstitutionality of the Busing Clause. That discussion, however, was not\nessential to any issue properly before the district court. Because the court’s\nstatements regarding the constitutionality of the Busing Clause were not essential\nto the decision to terminate jurisdiction, the sole issue before the court, that\nlanguage was dicta. See Rohrbaugh v. Celotex Corp., 53 F.3d 1181, 1184 (10th\nCir. 1995). As such, it presents no threat under the doctrines of claim or issue\npreclusion.\n\n                                         -22-\n\f                             III. CONCLUSION\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, this appeal is DISMISSED for lack of\n\njurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\f",

This appeal arises from the district court's 1995 decision to terminate its jurisdiction over the School District, finding the School District had eliminated the vestiges of de jure discrimination to the extent practicable.  Appellants Wilfred Keyes and others<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> (\"Appellants\") do not appeal the termination of jurisdiction, but rather appeal the district court's decision insofar as it opined upon the constitutionality of Article IX, Section 8 of the Colorado Constitution (\"the Busing Clause\") and two Colorado statutory provisions.  See Colo.Rev.Stat. &#167;&#167; 22-36-101(3), 22-30.5-104(3).  Those issues, however, are not justiciable.  As a consequence, there is no case or controversy as required by Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution, and this appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case originated in June of 1969, when children in the Denver public schools challenged the School District's deliberate policy of racial segregation.  See Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, 303 F.Supp. 279 (D.Colo.1969).  Since that challenge, this case has evolved through several stages of litigation during which this and other courts have rendered numerous opinions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  A brief summary of the history of the case provides necessary context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1960 through 1969, the School District established and maintained de jure segregation in the Denver public schools.  Keyes v. Congress of Hispanic Educators, 902 F.Supp. 1274, 1276 (D.Colo.1995).  In 1969 and 1970, the district court found that the School District had engaged in seven specific de jure segregative acts by attempting to maintain predominantly white schools in the Park Hill neighborhood.  See Keyes, 902 F.Supp. 1274, 1278 (D.Colo.1995) (citing Keyes I, 303 F.Supp. 279, 282-85 (D.Colo.1969);  Keyes II, 303 F.Supp. 289, 295 (D.Colo.1969);  Keyes IV, 313 F.Supp. 61 (D.Colo.1970)).  As a consequence, it ordered a desegregation plan for the Park Hill area schools in 1970.  Keyes V, 313 F.Supp. 90, 96-99 (10th Cir.1970).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the United States Supreme Court broadened the scope of the district court's jurisdiction.  Instead of limiting the desegregation plan to the Park Hill area, the Supreme Court determined that the entire Denver school system was a dual system<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> requiring desegregation.  Keyes VII, 413 U.S. 189, 201-02, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 2694-95, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973).  Thus, in 1974, the district court ordered a city-wide desegregation plan.  See Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1279.   This court, however, found that plan inadequate.  Keyes X, 521 F.2d 465, 475-79 (10th Cir.1975).  Finally in 1976, the parties agreed to a remedial plan which was approved and implemented.   See Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1279.   The remedial plan required, among other things, pairing elementary schools, changing attendance zones, establishing percentage ratios of Anglo to minority students, and transporting students by bus to implement the plan.   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the implementation of the remedial plan, the School District passed Resolution 2233 to direct continued desegregation efforts.  In 1984, the School District moved to terminate the court's jurisdiction.  Keyes XIV, 609 F.Supp. 1491, 1518-20 (D.Colo.1985).  The district court denied the motion, finding the School District had not yet achieved unitary status and that Resolution 2233 was too vague.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to remedy the vagueness of Resolution 2233, the School District passed Resolution 2314 in 1987.  Resolution 2314 called for continuing teacher assignment and student transfer policies that enhanced integration and required annual reports of progress toward achieving a unitary school district.  The School District again sought to terminate jurisdiction and the court again refused.  Instead, the court authorized existing plans to remedy the vestiges of past discrimination and ordered a meeting with counsel to issue a permanent injunction against the School District.  Keyes XVI, 653 F.Supp. 1536, 1539-40, 1542 (D.Colo.1987).  Still later that same year, the court entered an Interim Decree, superseding all prior remedial actions.  Keyes XVII, 670 F.Supp. at 1516-17.   That decree diminished the court's jurisdiction by freeing the School District to make changes in its existing plans to accommodate new situations.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, this court affirmed the denials of the motions to terminate jurisdiction, but invalidated some portions of the Interim Decree which merely required the School District to obey the law.  See Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1281;  Keyes XVIII, 895 F.2d 659, 666-69 (10th Cir.1990).  The School District thus remained under the district court's jurisdiction to remedy past discrimination, but could develop its own plans to do so.  See Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1281.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1992 the School District moved again to terminate the district court's jurisdiction.   See id. at 1275.   This time Appellants requested the court to rule on the constitutionality of Colorado's Busing Clause before it decided whether to terminate jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The Busing Clause, Article IX, Section 8 of the Colorado Constitution, provides in pertinent part that no school pupil shall \"be assigned or transported to any public educational institution for the purpose of achieving racial balance.\"   Appellants asserted that after termination of the court's jurisdiction, the Busing Clause would impede the School District's ability to implement Resolutions 2233 and 2314 and other policies adopted to change pupil assignments.  Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1275.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The School District agreed with that claim and stipulated that the School District's plans would conflict with the Busing Clause.   Id. at 1275, 1283.   Appellants also requested a determination of the constitutionality of certain sections of two Colorado statutory provisions:  The Colorado Public Schools of Choice Act, Colo.Rev.Stat. &#167; 22-36-101(3)(d), and the Colorado Charter Schools Act, Colo.Rev.Stat. &#167; 22-30.5-104(3).  The Attorney General of the State of Colorado was allowed to intervene and defend the validity of the Busing Clause.  Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1275.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a comprehensive opinion based on evidence received during hearings on August 23-25, 1994, the district court granted the School District's motion to terminate jurisdiction, stating the School District had complied with the desegregation decrees and that past de jure segregation had been eliminated to the extent practicable.  Id. at 1275, 1285, 1308-09.   Additionally, the district court found that the School District's existing policies did not conflict with the Busing Clause.   Id. at 1285.   In dicta, the court passed upon the issue of the constitutionality of the Busing Clause itself, indicating that it is consistent with the 14th Amendment.   Id. The district court stated that its consideration of the Busing Clause issue was \"to guide the District upon termination of ... jurisdiction.\"  Id. at 1275.   The district court did not decide whether the Colorado Schools of Choice Act and the Charter Schools Act are valid under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, stating only:  \"Comment on each [of the state and federal statutory requirements which the School District must now follow] is inappropriate, and this court may not give advisory opinions.\"  Id. at 1285.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is from the district court's decision that Appellants now appeal.  Appellants do not, however, appeal the termination of jurisdiction.  They instead argue that the district court's opinion was ambiguous<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and, to the extent that the issue was actually decided, appeal any determination that the Busing Clause, the Public Schools of Choice Act, and the Charter Schools Act are constitutional.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal presents serious issues concerning the court's jurisdiction.  Under Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution, federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  Superimposed upon the specified subject matter of federal court jurisdiction is the general limitation of that jurisdiction to cases or controversies.  See U.S. Const. art.  III, &#167; 2;  United States National Bank of Oregon v. Independent Insur.  Agents of America, 508 U.S. 439, 446, 113 S.Ct. 2173, 2178, 124 L.Ed.2d 402 (1993).  The constitutional case or controversy requirement for federal court jurisdiction in turn includes the necessity of justiciability, the very issue before the court in this appeal.  See Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 95, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1949-50, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Memorandum Opinion and Order of the district court elaborately provides the context for consideration of this court's jurisdiction under Article III and the referenced restrictions on that jurisdiction.  Both the format and content of the district court's opinion is instructive.  The format includes three sections:  \"History;\" \"The Future;\" and \"Findings of Fact,\" analyzing the status of the School District as of the August, 1994 hearing.  Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1276, 1282, 1286.   While there is necessary overlap in the various sections of the district court's opinion, it essentially divides this case and the desegregation of the School District into the past, the present, and the future.  Those time frames are critical in this court's consideration of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was charged with the obligation to determine whether the School District had complied in good faith with the court's various desegregation decrees, had eliminated to the extent practicable the vestiges and effects of its past discriminatory acts, and had thereby altered the Denver schools from a segregated dual system to unitary status.  See Board of Educ. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 245-50, 111 S.Ct. 630, 635-38, 112 L.Ed.2d 715 (1991).  As a consequence, it was necessary to analyze the present in light of the past.  The district court resolved the issues in favor of the School District.  The district court further held that the pupil assignment plan in place at the time of the hearing did not violate the Busing Clause.  Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1285.   The court held that the School District's motivation in implementing the plan was the eradication of segregation vestiges, rather than the achievement of racial balance, which would be prohibited by the Busing Clause.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond addressing the past and present, the district court considered the Busing Clause in the future.  Having resolved that the School District's pupil assignment plan did not conflict with the Colorado Busing Clause, the court nevertheless unnecessarily opined that the clause was consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The court also opined that the Busing Clause and related education statutes will provide challenges to the School District and will be fodder for future litigation.  Id. at 1283.   The district court, however, chose not to comment further on the effect or applicability of federal or state statutes, premising its reticence on the prohibition of advisory opinions.  Id. at 1285.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. RIPENESS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adhering to the district court's past, present and future format, we address Appellants' claims.  Specifically, Appellants only challenge the district court's dicta concerning the future.  Appellants do not challenge any of the court's rulings with respect to the present.  They neither challenge the district court's decision to terminate jurisdiction,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> nor do they appear to challenge the district court's statement that the School District's policies in effect at the time of the August, 1995 hearing did not conflict with the Busing Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Appellants' sole request is that this court resolve whether the Busing Clause is constitutional, an issue for the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case or controversy requirement of Article III admonishes federal courts to avoid \"premature adjudication\" and to abstain from \"entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.\"  Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967).  \"[T]he doctrine of ripeness is intended to forestall judicial determinations of disputes until the controversy is presented in clean-cut and concrete form.\"  Trierweiler v. Croxton &amp; Trench Holding Corp., 90 F.3d 1523, 1545 (10th Cir.1996) (quoting New Mexicans for Bill Richardson v. Gonzales, 64 F.3d 1495, 1499 (10th Cir.1995) (citations and quotations omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ripeness is a question of law, reviewed de novo.  See New Mexicans for Bill Richardson v. Gonzales, 64 F.3d 1495, 1499 (10th Cir.1995) (citing Powder River Basin Resource Council v. Babbitt, 54 F.3d 1477, 1483 (10th Cir.1995)).  As a jurisdictional prerequisite, ripeness may be examined by this court sua sponte.  See Metropolitan Wash.  Airports Auth. v. Citizens for the Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U.S. 252, 265 n. 13, 111 S.Ct. 2298, 2306 n. 13, 115 L.Ed.2d 236 (1991).  The resolution of ripeness \"requir[es] us to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\"  Abbott, 387 U.S. at 149, 87 S.Ct. at 1515.   This court must therefore apply the ripeness factors of fitness and hardship to the sole issue appealed, the constitutionality of the Busing Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants and the School District requested that the district court resolve the constitutionality of the Busing Clause in order to guide the School District for the future after the termination of jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  The parties essentially stipulated to the existence of a conflict between the School District's policies and the Busing Clause in order to receive a ruling on the constitutionality of the clause.  The parties, however, cannot create a case or controversy simply by agreement.  See Wilson v. Glenwood Intermountain Properties, Inc., 98 F.3d 590, 593 (10th Cir.1996) (finding \"parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on the courts by agreement\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants did not challenge an extant School District policy, nor did they claim the Busing Clause caused the School District to refrain from adopting a specific policy.  Rather, they requested the district court to render an opinion in a vacuum.  Any statement by the district court in response, however, was necessarily dicta.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Constitutional analysis requires the application of the challenged provision in a case or controversy.  Appellants' failure to appeal rulings relevant to the present and failure to reference a conflict between the Busing Clause and an actual or proposed School District policy deprives the analysis of a case or controversy within which to test the clause's constitutionality.  See Wilson, 98 F.3d at 594 (because plaintiffs did not appeal district court's denial of claims of religious discrimination in housing, a case or controversy surrounding gender discrimination claims was lacking).  As a consequence, the issue is not fit for a judicial resolution and lacks ripeness.  See Abbott, 387 U.S. at 149, 87 S.Ct. at 1515-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the Busing Clause prevents or has prevented the School District and individual schools from instituting any potential voluntary integration plans based on race.  They argue that this exemplifies a violation of the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by interdicting benefits, such as integration plans, to citizens when those benefits are based solely on race.  Appellants, however, make no effort to establish that any particular school desires to implement voluntary integration plans, let alone that any school has been deterred by the Busing Clause from implementing such a plan.  This court cannot speculate whether any school will propose an integration plan, what the plan might be, and thus whether such a plan is prohibited by Colorado's Busing Clause.  Appellants have failed to present this court with any specific integration proposal to juxtapose with the Busing Clause.  Moreover, the State of Colorado has expressly and unequivocally conceded that it has no plans to challenge the School District's existing policies, thus confirming the absence of a case or controversy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court may not speculate about future conflicts between the Busing Clause and the School District's policies, but rather must focus its analysis on any controversy as it exists today.  See Sierra Club v. Yeutter, 911 F.2d 1405, 1416 (10th Cir.1990) (holding court must avoid \"decision where the harm [is] contingent upon uncertain or speculative future administrative action\").  Because Appellants cannot demonstrate a present controversy, we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. STANDING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For many of the same reasons this case is not ripe for review, Appellants do not have standing to appeal.  Standing is a threshold, jurisdictional issue.  Doyle v. Oklahoma Bar Ass'n, 998 F.2d 1559, 1566 (10th Cir.1993).  \"[A] plaintiff must maintain standing at all times throughout the litigation for a court to retain jurisdiction.\"  Powder River, 54 F.3d at 1485 (finding that when plaintiff no longer has injury, Article III requirements of case or controversy are no longer met).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To have standing, plaintiffs \"must have suffered an 'injury-in-fact.' \"  Clajon Production Corp. v. Petera, 70 F.3d 1566, 1572 (10th Cir.1995) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)).  This injury-in-fact element in turn requires plaintiffs to demonstrate \"an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. at 2136 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The impediments to ripeness are equally impediments to standing.  This court's focus is on past and present injury;  possible future injury is insufficient to create standing.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61, 112 S.Ct. at 2136-37.   Appellants have failed to demonstrate that the School District or any school has withdrawn policies, instituted policies, or refrained from withdrawing or instituting policies as a result of the Busing Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Consequently, any injury flowing from the application of the Busing Clause constitutes possible future injury, not past or present injury.  Appellants thus lack standing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

In fact we argued--that was our lead argument below to Judge Matsch.  We thought that a future problem of the Busing Clause on Denver School District's post-Keyes conduct was a case for another day, so we asked Judge Matsch not to rule on the constitutionality.  We said it was irrelevant to the finding of unitary status....</p>\n        <p>....</p>\n        <p>Mr. Tymkovich:  I think the court made that clear in his response on the motion to clarify because he said that for him to comment on the post-decree conduct of the school district would be advisory--and by that I mean dicta.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The following colloquy between this court and Mr. Tymkovich occurred at oral argument:</p>\n        <p>The Court:  Are you then saying on behalf of the State of Colorado that Colorado does not believe that the present programs in effect which involve busing in the Denver School District constitute busing for the purpose of achieving racial balance?</p>\n        <p>Mr. Tymkovich:  Yes, your Honor.  I want to be very clear about that because I think what we're talking about is a potential issue for another day as to whether the school district has impermissibly intruded on the commands of the Busing Clause....  We don't believe that the school district today is violating those provisions of law</p>\n        <p>....</p>\n        <p>... The Court:  My question now is, under the practices and policies now in effect, the State of Colorado, are they committing that they will not challenge those under the state constitutional provision prohibiting busing for the purpose of achieving racial balance?</p>\n        <p>Mr. Tymkovich:  As we understand those policies today, your Honor, the answer is \"no.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Although not reflected in the record, the School District has begun dismantling aspects of its prior plans which involved race-based pupil assignment or transportation.  Appellants suggest that the only reason the School District has begun dismantling its existing policies is because of a perceived conflict with the Busing Clause.  They offer no support for this reasoning, and Michael H. Jackson, counsel for the School District, expressly denied at oral argument any nexus between the Busing Clause and the dismantling of any plan or program:</p>\n        <p>The Court:  Does the existence of the Busing Clause cause the district to feel compelled to dismantle any remedial plan in effect?</p>\n        <p>Mr. Jackson:  I do not believe so.</p>\n        <p>The Court:  So you're representing that the district feels no compulsion from the presence of the Busing Clause, either on its face or as applied?</p>\n        <p>Mr. Jackson:  That's correct.</p>\n        <p>The Court:  So any fears that Mr. Greiner or his clients have would not be fears based on the present, they would be fears based upon the as yet, inchoate, future?</p>\n        <p>Mr. Jackson:  I believe that's true and I believe that the arguments of Mr. Greiner and Mr. Tymkovich this morning confirm that.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Appellants' final argument in their attempt to create standing is indeed creative.  They argue that any statements about the constitutionality of the Busing Clause in the district court's opinion could be used by the State of Colorado and the School District under the doctrines of claim preclusion or issue preclusion to prevent further litigation over the Busing Clause.  Claim preclusion bars claims when \"the prior action involved identical claims and the same parties or their privies.\"  Frandsen v. Westinghouse Corp., 46 F.3d 975, 978 (10th Cir.1995).  On the other hand, issue preclusion can bar future litigation even when the parties are not identical.  Id</p>\n        <p>It is true that the district court's opinion contains a discussion regarding the constitutionality of the Busing Clause.  That discussion, however, was not essential to any issue properly before the district court.  Because the court's statements regarding the constitutionality of the Busing Clause were not essential to the decision to terminate jurisdiction, the sole issue before the court, that language was dicta.  See Rohrbaugh v. Celotex Corp., 53 F.3d 1181, 1184 (10th Cir.1995).  As such, it presents no threat under the doctrines of claim or issue preclusion.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

This appeal arises from the district court's 1995 decision to terminate its jurisdiction over the School District, finding the School District had eliminated the vestiges of de jure discrimination to the extent practicable.  Appellants Wilfred Keyes and others<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> (\"Appellants\") do not appeal the termination of jurisdiction, but rather appeal the district court's decision insofar as it opined upon the constitutionality of Article IX, Section 8 of the Colorado Constitution (\"the Busing Clause\") and two Colorado statutory provisions.  See Colo.Rev.Stat. &#167;&#167; 22-36-101(3), 22-30.5-104(3).  Those issues, however, are not justiciable.  As a consequence, there is no case or controversy as required by Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution, and this appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case originated in June of 1969, when children in the Denver public schools challenged the School District's deliberate policy of racial segregation.  See Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1623201\"><a href=\"/opinion/1623201/keyes-v-school-district-number-one-denver-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span> (D.Colo.1969).  Since that challenge, this case has evolved through several stages of litigation during which this and other courts have rendered numerous opinions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  A brief summary of the history of the case provides necessary context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1960 through 1969, the School District established and maintained de jure segregation in the Denver public schools.  Keyes v. Congress of Hispanic Educators, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1274</span></span>, 1276 (D.Colo.1995).  In 1969 and 1970, the district court found that the School District had engaged in seven specific de jure segregative acts by attempting to maintain predominantly white schools in the Park Hill neighborhood.  See Keyes, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1274</span></span>, 1278 (D.Colo.1995) (citing Keyes I, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1623201\"><a href=\"/opinion/1623201/keyes-v-school-district-number-one-denver-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span> (D.Colo.1970)).  As a consequence, it ordered a desegregation plan for the Park Hill area schools in 1970.  Keyes V, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1968989\"><a href=\"/opinion/1968989/keyes-v-school-district-number-one-denver-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Instead of limiting the desegregation plan to the Park Hill area, the Supreme Court determined that the entire Denver school system was a dual system<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> requiring desegregation.  Keyes VII, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108844\"><a href=\"/opinion/108844/keyes-v-school-dist-no-1-denver/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span>, 201-02, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108844\"><a href=\"/opinion/108844/keyes-v-school-dist-no-1-denver/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span> (1973).  Thus, in 1974, the district court ordered a city-wide desegregation plan.  See Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1279.   This court, however, found that plan inadequate.  Keyes X, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"329565\"><a href=\"/opinion/329565/wilfred-keyes-plaintiffs-appellees-cross-appellants-number-74-1350-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span>, 475-79 (10th Cir.1975).  Finally in 1976, the parties agreed to a remedial plan which was approved and implemented.   See Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1279.   The remedial plan required, among other things, pairing elementary schools, changing attendance zones, establishing percentage ratios of Anglo to minority students, and transporting students by bus to implement the plan.   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the implementation of the remedial plan, the School District passed Resolution 2233 to direct continued desegregation efforts.  In 1984, the School District moved to terminate the court's jurisdiction.  Keyes XIV, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1887209\"><a href=\"/opinion/1887209/keyes-v-school-dist-no-1-denver-colo/\"><span class=\"volume\">609</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1491</span></a></span>, 1518-20 (D.Colo.1985).  The district court denied the motion, finding the School District had not yet achieved unitary status and that Resolution 2233 was too vague.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to remedy the vagueness of Resolution 2233, the School District passed Resolution 2314 in 1987.  Resolution 2314 called for continuing teacher assignment and student transfer policies that enhanced integration and required annual reports of progress toward achieving a unitary school district.  The School District again sought to terminate jurisdiction and the court again refused.  Instead, the court authorized existing plans to remedy the vestiges of past discrimination and ordered a meeting with counsel to issue a permanent injunction against the School District.  Keyes XVI, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2400873\"><a href=\"/opinion/2400873/keyes-v-school-dist-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">653</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1536</span></a></span>, 1539-40, 1542 (D.Colo.1987).  Still later that same year, the court entered an Interim Decree, superseding all prior remedial actions.  Keyes XVII, 670 F.Supp. at 1516-17.   That decree diminished the court's jurisdiction by freeing the School District to make changes in its existing plans to accommodate new situations.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, this court affirmed the denials of the motions to terminate jurisdiction, but invalidated some portions of the Interim Decree which merely required the School District to obey the law.  See Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1281;  Keyes XVIII, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536137\"><a href=\"/opinion/536137/wilfred-keyes-and-congress-of-hispanic-educators/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span>, 666-69 (10th Cir.1990).  The School District thus remained under the district court's jurisdiction to remedy past discrimination, but could develop its own plans to do so.  See Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1281.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1992 the School District moved again to terminate the district court's jurisdiction.   See id. at 1275.   This time Appellants requested the court to rule on the constitutionality of Colorado's Busing Clause before it decided whether to terminate jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The Busing Clause, Article IX, Section 8 of the Colorado Constitution, provides in pertinent part that no school pupil shall \"be assigned or transported to any public educational institution for the purpose of achieving racial balance.\"   Appellants asserted that after termination of the court's jurisdiction, the Busing Clause would impede the School District's ability to implement Resolutions 2233 and 2314 and other policies adopted to change pupil assignments.  Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1275.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The School District agreed with that claim and stipulated that the School District's plans would conflict with the Busing Clause.   Id. at 1275, 1283.   Appellants also requested a determination of the constitutionality of certain sections of two Colorado statutory provisions:  The Colorado Public Schools of Choice Act, Colo.Rev.Stat. &#167; 22-36-101(3)(d), and the Colorado Charter Schools Act, Colo.Rev.Stat. &#167; 22-30.5-104(3).  The Attorney General of the State of Colorado was allowed to intervene and defend the validity of the Busing Clause.  Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1275.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a comprehensive opinion based on evidence received during hearings on August 23-25, 1994, the district court granted the School District's motion to terminate jurisdiction, stating the School District had complied with the desegregation decrees and that past de jure segregation had been eliminated to the extent practicable.  Id. at 1275, 1285, 1308-09.   Additionally, the district court found that the School District's existing policies did not conflict with the Busing Clause.   Id. at 1285.   In dicta, the court passed upon the issue of the constitutionality of the Busing Clause itself, indicating that it is consistent with the 14th Amendment.   Id. The district court stated that its consideration of the Busing Clause issue was \"to guide the District upon termination of ... jurisdiction.\"  Id. at 1275.   The district court did not decide whether the Colorado Schools of Choice Act and the Charter Schools Act are valid under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, stating only:  \"Comment on each [of the state and federal statutory requirements which the School District must now follow] is inappropriate, and this court may not give advisory opinions.\"  Id. at 1285.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is from the district court's decision that Appellants now appeal.  Appellants do not, however, appeal the termination of jurisdiction.  They instead argue that the district court's opinion was ambiguous<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and, to the extent that the issue was actually decided, appeal any determination that the Busing Clause, the Public Schools of Choice Act, and the Charter Schools Act are constitutional.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal presents serious issues concerning the court's jurisdiction.  Under Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution, federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  Superimposed upon the specified subject matter of federal court jurisdiction is the general limitation of that jurisdiction to cases or controversies.  See U.S. Const. art.  III, &#167; 2;  United States National Bank of Oregon v. Independent Insur.  Agents of America, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112877\"><a href=\"/opinion/112877/united-states-nat-bank-of-ore-v-independent-ins-agents-of-america-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span>, 446, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112877\"><a href=\"/opinion/112877/united-states-nat-bank-of-ore-v-independent-ins-agents-of-america-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span> (1993).  The constitutional case or controversy requirement for federal court jurisdiction in turn includes the necessity of justiciability, the very issue before the court in this appeal.  See Flast v.

Both the format and content of the district court's opinion is instructive.  The format includes three sections:  \"History;\" \"The Future;\" and \"Findings of Fact,\" analyzing the status of the School District as of the August, 1994 hearing.  Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1276, 1282, 1286.   While there is necessary overlap in the various sections of the district court's opinion, it essentially divides this case and the desegregation of the School District into the past, the present, and the future.  Those time frames are critical in this court's consideration of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was charged with the obligation to determine whether the School District had complied in good faith with the court's various desegregation decrees, had eliminated to the extent practicable the vestiges and effects of its past discriminatory acts, and had thereby altered the Denver schools from a segregated dual system to unitary status.  See Board of Educ. v. Dowell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112520\"><a href=\"/opinion/112520/board-of-ed-of-oklahoma-city-public-schools-v-dowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span>, 245-50, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112520\"><a href=\"/opinion/112520/board-of-ed-of-oklahoma-city-public-schools-v-dowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court resolved the issues in favor of the School District.  The district court further held that the pupil assignment plan in place at the time of the hearing did not violate the Busing Clause.  Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1285.   The court held that the School District's motivation in implementing the plan was the eradication of segregation vestiges, rather than the achievement of racial balance, which would be prohibited by the Busing Clause.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond addressing the past and present, the district court considered the Busing Clause in the future.  Having resolved that the School District's pupil assignment plan did not conflict with the Colorado Busing Clause, the court nevertheless unnecessarily opined that the clause was consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The court also opined that the Busing Clause and related education statutes will provide challenges to the School District and will be fodder for future litigation.  Id. at 1283.   The district court, however, chose not to comment further on the effect or applicability of federal or state statutes, premising its reticence on the prohibition of advisory opinions.

This court must therefore apply the ripeness factors of fitness and hardship to the sole issue appealed, the constitutionality of the Busing Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants and the School District requested that the district court resolve the constitutionality of the Busing Clause in order to guide the School District for the future after the termination of jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  The parties essentially stipulated to the existence of a conflict between the School District's policies and the Busing Clause in order to receive a ruling on the constitutionality of the clause.  The parties, however, cannot create a case or controversy simply by agreement.  See Wilson v. Glenwood Intermountain Properties, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"154079\"><a href=\"/opinion/154079/wilson-v-glennwood-properties/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span>, 593 (10th Cir.1996) (finding \"parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on the courts by agreement\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants did not challenge an extant School District policy, nor did they claim the Busing Clause caused the School District to refrain from adopting a specific policy.  Rather, they requested the district court to render an opinion in a vacuum.  Any statement by the district court in response, however, was necessarily dicta.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Constitutional analysis requires the application of the challenged provision in a case or controversy.  Appellants' failure to appeal rulings relevant to the present and failure to reference a conflict between the Busing Clause and an actual or proposed School District policy deprives the analysis of a case or controversy within which to test the clause's constitutionality.  See Wilson, 98 F.3d at 594 (because plaintiffs did not appeal district court's denial of claims of religious discrimination in housing, a case or controversy surrounding gender discrimination claims was lacking).  As a consequence, the issue is not fit for a judicial resolution and lacks ripeness.  See Abbott, 387 U.S. at 149, 87 S.Ct. at 1515-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the Busing Clause prevents or has prevented the School District and individual schools from instituting any potential voluntary integration plans based on race.  They argue that this exemplifies a violation of the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by interdicting benefits, such as integration plans, to citizens when those benefits are based solely on race.  Appellants, however, make no effort to establish that any particular school desires to implement voluntary integration plans, let alone that any school has been deterred by the Busing Clause from implementing such a plan.  This court cannot speculate whether any school will propose an integration plan, what the plan might be, and thus whether such a plan is prohibited by Colorado's Busing Clause.  Appellants have failed to present this court with any specific integration proposal to juxtapose with the Busing Clause.  Moreover, the State of Colorado has expressly and unequivocally conceded that it has no plans to challenge the School District's existing policies, thus confirming the absence of a case or controversy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court may not speculate about future conflicts between the Busing Clause and the School District's policies, but rather must focus its analysis on any controversy as it exists today.

On remand, the district court conducted a second trial and concluded:  \"The Supreme Court's viewpoint based on the record before it is that the Denver school system is a dual system.  There can be no doubt as to its view....\"  Keyes VIII, 368 F.Supp. at 210</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Appellants argued the district court should not completely terminate its jurisdiction.  Although Appellants agreed that \"the indicia of de jure segregation ha[d] been removed from student assignments, faculty, staff, transportation, extra curricular activities and facilities,\" they requested the court retain residual control over the School District on the ground that vestiges of the dual system remained in the form of racial disparity in discipline, drop-out rates, and gifted and talented programs</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> After the district court's decision was issued in 1995, Appellants made a Motion for Clarification pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(b).  Specifically, Appellants requested clarification regarding whether the district court had determined the School District could or could not maintain its existing plans in light of the Busing Clause.  In denying the motion, the district court stated that its opinion \"resolved the only question properly presented on the record before it regarding the validity of the Busing Clause under the United States Constitution.  To extend the findings and conclusions in the manner suggested would violate the prohibition against rendering advisory opinions.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The district court was correct to refuse to address the constitutionality of the Public Schools of Choice Act and the Charter Schools Act, and we likewise do not address them in this opinion.  For the same reason this court does not have jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of the Busing Clause, we cannot pass upon the constitutionality of the Public Schools of Choice Act or the Charter Schools Act.  As is further elucidated below, the only justiciable issue before the district court was whether or not to terminate jurisdiction.  Any additional discussion of the constitutionality of either the Busing Clause or Colorado statutes is merely advisory \"to guide the district upon termination of ... jurisdiction.\"  Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1275.   Such \"guidance\" is dicta</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The district court stated:  \"The Busing Clause is preceded by a prohibition on the use of race or color in making any distinction or classification of pupils.  That is entirely consistent with the 14th Amendment.\"  Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1285</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In their Opening Brief, Appellants state:  \"The district court, over the limited objections of the plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors, granted the School District's Motion to Terminate Jurisdiction and issued a final Judgment dismissing the case.  No parties are appealing from that determination.\"   Appellant Br. at 6 (citation omitted)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Rather than specifically appealing the latter determination, Appellants argue that it is unclear whether the district court found there was a conflict between the School District's policies and the Busing Clause and ask this court to \"resolve the ambiguity.\"   Appellant Reply Br. at 12.  We have difficulty understanding the thrust of this argument, in light of the district court's unequivocal statement:  \"The pupil assignment plan in effect at the time of the August, 1994 hearing does not violate the Busing Clause because it was not adopted for the purpose of achieving racial balance.\"  Keyes XIX, 902 F.Supp. at 1285</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The School District sought \"to remove [the Busing Clause] as a possible obstacle to terminating jurisdiction over the District and to clarify what the District's duties would be once jurisdiction was terminated.\"   The School District acknowledged in its brief that it is now satisfied that by terminating jurisdiction and stating that there was no conflict between any extant policies and the Busing Clause, the district court's opinion resolved both matters</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> During oral arguments, Timothy M. Tymkovich, Solicitor General for the State of Colorado, acknowledged that the decision to terminate jurisdiction could have been made without a discussion of the constitutionality of the Busing Clause:</p>\n        <p>The Court:  Could the district court in your view have terminated jurisdiction without passing on the constitutional questions?</p>\n        <p>Mr. Tymkovich:  Yes.  In fact we argued--that was our lead argument below to Judge Matsch.  We thought that a future problem of the Busing Clause on Denver School District's post-Keyes conduct was a case for another day, so we asked Judge Matsch not to rule on the constitutionality.  We said it was irrelevant to the finding of unitary status....</p>\n        <p>....</p>\n        <p>Mr. Tymkovich:  I think the court made that clear in his response on the motion to clarify because he said that for him to comment on the post-decree conduct of the school district would be advisory--and by that I mean dicta.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The following colloquy between this court and Mr. Tymkovich occurred at oral argument:</p>\n        <p>The Court:  Are you then saying on behalf of the State of Colorado that Colorado does not believe that the present programs in effect which involve busing in the Denver School District constitute busing for the purpose of achieving racial balance?</p>\n        <p>Mr. Tymkovich:  Yes, your Honor.  I want to be very clear about that because I think what we're talking about is a potential issue for another day as to whether the school district has impermissibly intruded on the commands of the Busing Clause....  We don't believe that the school district today is violating those provisions of law</p>\n        <p>....</p>\n        <p>... The Court:  My question now is, under the practices and policies now in effect, the State of Colorado, are they committing that they will not challenge those under the state constitutional provision prohibiting busing for the purpose of achieving racial balance?</p>\n        <p>Mr. Tymkovich:  As we understand those policies today, your Honor, the answer is \"no.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Although not reflected in the record, the School District has begun dismantling aspects of its prior plans which involved race-based pupil assignment or transportation.  Appellants suggest that the only reason the School District has begun dismantling its existing policies is because of a perceived conflict with the Busing Clause.  They offer no support for this reasoning, and Michael H. Jackson, counsel for the School District, expressly denied at oral argument any nexus between the Busing Clause and the dismantling of any plan or program:</p>\n        <p>The Court:  Does the existence of the Busing Clause cause the district to feel compelled to dismantle any remedial plan in effect?</p>\n        <p>Mr. Jackson:  I do not believe so.</p>\n        <p>The Court:  So you're representing that the district feels no compulsion from the presence of the Busing Clause, either on its face or as applied?</p>\n        <p>Mr. Jackson:  That's correct.</p>\n        <p>The Court:  So any fears that Mr. Greiner or his clients have would not be fears based on the present, they would be fears based upon the as yet, inchoate, future?</p>\n        <p>Mr. Jackson:  I believe that's true and I believe that the arguments of Mr. Greiner and Mr. Tymkovich this morning confirm that.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Appellants' final argument in their attempt to create standing is indeed creative.  They argue that any statements about the constitutionality of the Busing Clause in the district court's opinion could be used by the State of Colorado and the School District under the doctrines of claim preclusion or issue preclusion to prevent further litigation over the Busing Clause.  Claim preclusion bars claims when \"the prior action involved identical claims and the same parties or their privies.\"  Frandsen v. Westinghouse Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687701\"><a href=\"/opinion/687701/john-w-frandsen-v-westinghouse-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span>, 978 (10th Cir.1995).  On the other hand, issue preclusion can bar future litigation even when the parties are not identical.  Id</p>\n        <p>It is true that the district court's opinion contains a discussion regarding the constitutionality of the Busing Clause.  That discussion, however, was not essential to any issue properly before the district court.  Because the court's statements regarding the constitutionality of the Busing Clause were not essential to the decision to terminate jurisdiction, the sole issue before the court, that language was dicta.  See Rohrbaugh v. Celotex Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"695263\"><a href=\"/opinion/695263/susan-rohrbaugh-barbara-ann-clay-debra-mae-ambler-individually-and-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></a></span>, 1184 (10th Cir.1995).  As such, it presents no threat under the doctrines of claim or issue preclusion.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
