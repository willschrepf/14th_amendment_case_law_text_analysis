HOLDER, ATTORNEY\n              GENERAL, ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n          THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 12–96. Argued February 27, 2013—Decided June 25, 2013\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to address entrenched racial\n  discrimination in voting, “an insidious and pervasive evil which had\n  been perpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting\n  and ingenious defiance of the Constitution.” South Carolina v. Kat-\n  zenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 309. Section 2 of the Act, which bans any\n  “standard, practice, or procedure” that “results in a denial or\n  abridgement of the right of any citizen . . . to vote on account of race\n  or color,” 42 U. S. C. §1973(a), applies nationwide, is permanent, and\n  is not at issue in this case. Other sections apply only to some parts of\n  the country. Section 4 of the Act provides the “coverage formula,” de-\n  fining the “covered jurisdictions” as States or political subdivisions\n  that maintained tests or devices as prerequisites to voting, and had\n  low voter registration or turnout, in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n  §1973b(b). In those covered jurisdictions, §5 of the Act provides that\n  no change in voting procedures can take effect until approved by\n  specified federal authorities in Washington, D. C. §1973c(a). Such\n  approval is known as “preclearance.”\n     The coverage formula and preclearance requirement were initially\n  set to expire after five years, but the Act has been reauthorized sev-\n  eral times. In 2006, the Act was reauthorized for an additional 25\n  years, but the coverage formula was not changed. Coverage still\n  turned on whether a jurisdiction had a voting test in the 1960s or\n  1970s, and had low voter registration or turnout at that time. Short-\n  ly after the 2006 reauthorization, a Texas utility district sought to\n  bail out from the Act’s coverage and, in the alternative, challenged\n  the Act’s constitutionality. This Court resolved the challenge on\n  statutory grounds, but expressed serious doubts about the Act’s con-\n\f2                    SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    tinued constitutionality. See Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist.\n    No. One v. Holder, 557 U. S. 193.\n      Petitioner Shelby County, in the covered jurisdiction of Alabama,\n    sued the Attorney General in Federal District Court in Washington,\n    D. C., seeking a declaratory judgment that sections 4(b) and 5 are fa-\n    cially unconstitutional, as well as a permanent injunction against\n    their enforcement. The District Court upheld the Act, finding that\n    the evidence before Congress in 2006 was sufficient to justify reau-\n    thorizing §5 and continuing §4(b)’s coverage formula. The D. C. Cir-\n    cuit affirmed. After surveying the evidence in the record, that court\n    accepted Congress’s conclusion that §2 litigation remained inade-\n    quate in the covered jurisdictions to protect the rights of minority\n    voters, that §5 was therefore still necessary, and that the coverage\n    formula continued to pass constitutional muster.\nHeld: Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional; its formula\n can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to pre-\n clearance. Pp. 9–25.\n    (a) In Northwest Austin, this Court noted that the Voting Rights\n Act “imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs”\n and concluded that “a departure from the fundamental principle of\n equal sovereignty requires a showing that a statute’s disparate geo-\n graphic coverage is sufficiently related to the problem that it targets.”\n 557 U. S., at 203. These basic principles guide review of the question\n presented here. Pp. 9–17.\n      (1) State legislation may not contravene federal law. States re-\n tain broad autonomy, however, in structuring their governments and\n pursuing legislative objectives. Indeed, the Tenth Amendment re-\n serves to the States all powers not specifically granted to the Federal\n Government, including “the power to regulate elections.” Gregory v.\n Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 461–462. There is also a “fundamental prin-\n ciple of equal sovereignty” among the States, which is highly perti-\n nent in assessing disparate treatment of States. Northwest Austin,\n supra, at 203.\n    The Voting Rights Act sharply departs from these basic principles.\n It requires States to beseech the Federal Government for permission\n to implement laws that they would otherwise have the right to enact\n and execute on their own. And despite the tradition of equal sover-\n eignty, the Act applies to only nine States (and additional counties).\n That is why, in 1966, this Court described the Act as “stringent” and\n “potent,” Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 308, 315, 337. The Court nonethe-\n less upheld the Act, concluding that such an “uncommon exercise of\n congressional power” could be justified by “exceptional conditions.”\n Id., at 334. Pp. 9–12.\n      (2) In 1966, these departures were justified by the “blight of ra-\n\f                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncial discrimination in voting” that had “infected the electoral process\nin parts of our country for nearly a century,” Katzenbach, 383 U. S.,\nat 308. At the time, the coverage formula—the means of linking the\nexercise of the unprecedented authority with the problem that war-\nranted it—made sense. The Act was limited to areas where Congress\nfound “evidence of actual voting discrimination,” and the covered ju-\nrisdictions shared two characteristics: “the use of tests and devices\nfor voter registration, and a voting rate in the 1964 presidential elec-\ntion at least 12 points below the national average.” Id., at 330. The\nCourt explained that “[t]ests and devices are relevant to voting dis-\ncrimination because of their long history as a tool for perpetrating\nthe evil; a low voting rate is pertinent for the obvious reason that\nwidespread disenfranchisement must inevitably affect the number of\nactual voters.” Ibid. The Court therefore concluded that “the cover-\nage formula [was] rational in both practice and theory.” Ibid.\nPp. 12–13.\n     (3) Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically.\nLargely because of the Voting Rights Act, “[v]oter turnout and regis-\ntration rates” in covered jurisdictions “now approach parity. Blatant-\nly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. And minority\ncandidates hold office at unprecedented levels.” Northwest Austin,\nsupra, at 202. The tests and devices that blocked ballot access have\nbeen forbidden nationwide for over 40 years. Yet the Act has not\neased §5’s restrictions or narrowed the scope of §4’s coverage formula\nalong the way. Instead those extraordinary and unprecedented fea-\ntures have been reauthorized as if nothing has changed, and they\nhave grown even stronger. Because §5 applies only to those jurisdic-\ntions singled out by §4, the Court turns to consider that provision.\nPp. 13–17.\n   (b) Section 4’s formula is unconstitutional in light of current condi-\ntions. Pp. 17–25.\n     (1) In 1966, the coverage formula was “rational in both practice\nand theory.” Katzenbach, supra, at 330. It looked to cause (discrimi-\nnatory tests) and effect (low voter registration and turnout), and tai-\nlored the remedy (preclearance) to those jurisdictions exhibiting both.\nBy 2009, however, the “coverage formula raise[d] serious constitu-\ntional questions.” Northwest Austin, supra, at 204. Coverage today\nis based on decades-old data and eradicated practices. The formula\ncaptures States by reference to literacy tests and low voter registra-\ntion and turnout in the 1960s and early 1970s. But such tests have\nbeen banned for over 40 years. And voter registration and turnout\nnumbers in covered States have risen dramatically. In 1965, the\nStates could be divided into those with a recent history of voting tests\nand low voter registration and turnout and those without those char-\n\f4                     SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    acteristics. Congress based its coverage formula on that distinction.\n    Today the Nation is no longer divided along those lines, yet the Vot-\n    ing Rights Act continues to treat it as if it were. Pp. 17–18.\n         (2) The Government attempts to defend the formula on grounds\n    that it is “reverse-engineered”—Congress identified the jurisdictions\n    to be covered and then came up with criteria to describe them. Kat-\n    zenbach did not sanction such an approach, reasoning instead that\n    the coverage formula was rational because the “formula . . . was rele-\n    vant to the problem.” 383 U. S., at 329, 330. The Government has a\n    fallback argument—because the formula was relevant in 1965, its\n    continued use is permissible so long as any discrimination remains in\n    the States identified in 1965. But this does not look to “current polit-\n    ical conditions,” Northwest Austin, supra, at 203, instead relying on a\n    comparison between the States in 1965. But history did not end in\n    1965. In assessing the “current need[ ]” for a preclearance system\n    treating States differently from one another today, history since 1965\n    cannot be ignored. The Fifteenth Amendment is not designed to pun-\n    ish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future. To serve\n    that purpose, Congress—if it is to divide the States—must identify\n    those jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes sense in\n    light of current conditions. Pp. 18–21.\n         (3) Respondents also rely heavily on data from the record com-\n    piled by Congress before reauthorizing the Act. Regardless of how\n    one looks at that record, no one can fairly say that it shows anything\n    approaching the “pervasive,” “flagrant,” “widespread,” and “rampant”\n    discrimination that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions\n    from the rest of the Nation in 1965. Katzenbach, supra, at 308, 315,\n    331. But a more fundamental problem remains: Congress did not use\n    that record to fashion a coverage formula grounded in current condi-\n    tions. It instead re-enacted a formula based on 40-year-old facts hav-\n    ing no logical relation to the present day. Pp. 21–22.\n679 F. 3d 848, reversed.\n\n  ROBERTS, C.

ERIC\n   H. HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 25, 2013] \n\n\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 employed extraordinary\nmeasures to address an extraordinary problem. Section 5\nof the Act required States to obtain federal permission\nbefore enacting any law related to voting—a drastic depar-\nture from basic principles of federalism. And §4 of the Act\napplied that requirement only to some States—an equally\ndramatic departure from the principle that all States\nenjoy equal sovereignty. This was strong medicine, but\nCongress determined it was needed to address entrenched\nracial discrimination in voting, “an insidious and perva-\nsive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of\nour country through unremitting and ingenious defiance\nof the Constitution.” South Carolina v. Katzenbach,\n383 U. S. 301, 309 (1966). As we explained in upholding\nthe law, “exceptional conditions can justify legislative\nmeasures not otherwise appropriate.” Id., at 334. Reflect-\ning the unprecedented nature of these measures, they\nwere scheduled to expire after five years. See Voting\nRights Act of 1965, §4(a), 79 Stat. 438.\n\f2               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Nearly 50 years later, they are still in effect; indeed,\nthey have been made more stringent, and are now sched-\nuled to last until 2031. There is no denying, however, that\nthe conditions that originally justified these measures no\nlonger characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions. By\n2009, “the racial gap in voter registration and turnout\n[was] lower in the States originally covered by §5 than it\n[was] nationwide.” Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist.\nNo. One v. Holder, 557 U. S. 193, 203–204 (2009). Since\nthat time, Census Bureau data indicate that African-\nAmerican voter turnout has come to exceed white voter\nturnout in five of the six States originally covered by §5,\nwith a gap in the sixth State of less than one half of one\npercent. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, Re-\nported Voting and Registration, by Sex, Race and His-\npanic Origin, for States (Nov. 2012) (Table 4b).\n  At the same time, voting discrimination still exists; no\none doubts that. The question is whether the Act’s ex-\ntraordinary measures, including its disparate treatment of\nthe States, continue to satisfy constitutional requirements.\nAs we put it a short time ago, “the Act imposes current\nburdens and must be justified by current needs.” North-\nwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 203.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   The Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870, in the\nwake of the Civil War. It provides that “[t]he right of\ncitizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or\nabridged by the United States or by any State on account\nof race, color, or previous condition of servitude,” and it\ngives Congress the “power to enforce this article by appro-\npriate legislation.”\n   “The first century of congressional enforcement of the\nAmendment, however, can only be regarded as a failure.”\nId., at 197. In the 1890s, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana,\n\f                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia\nbegan to enact literacy tests for voter registration and\nto employ other methods designed to prevent African-\nAmericans from voting. Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 310.\nCongress passed statutes outlawing some of these practices\nand facilitating litigation against them, but litigation\nremained slow and expensive, and the States came up with\nnew ways to discriminate as soon as existing ones were\nstruck down. Voter registration of African-Americans\nbarely improved. Id., at 313–314.\n    Inspired to action by the civil rights movement, Con-\ngress responded in 1965 with the Voting Rights Act.\nSection 2 was enacted to forbid, in all 50 States, any\n“standard, practice, or procedure . . . imposed or applied\n. . . to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United\nStates to vote on account of race or color.” 79 Stat. 437.\nThe current version forbids any “standard, practice, or\nprocedure” that “results in a denial or abridgement of the\nright of any citizen of the United States to vote on account\nof race or color.” 42 U. S. C. §1973(a). Both the Federal\nGovernment and individuals have sued to enforce §2, see,\ne.g., Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997 (1994), and\ninjunctive relief is available in appropriate cases to block\nvoting laws from going into effect, see 42 U. S. C.\n§1973j(d). Section 2 is permanent, applies nationwide,\nand is not at issue in this case.\n    Other sections targeted only some parts of the country.\nAt the time of the Act’s passage, these “covered” jurisdic-\ntions were those States or political subdivisions that had\nmaintained a test or device as a prerequisite to voting as\nof November 1, 1964, and had less than 50 percent voter\nregistration or turnout in the 1964 Presidential election.\n§4(b), 79 Stat. 438. Such tests or devices included literacy\nand knowledge tests, good moral character requirements,\nthe need for vouchers from registered voters, and the like.\n§4(c), id., at 438–439. A covered jurisdiction could “bail\n\f4               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nout” of coverage if it had not used a test or device in the\npreceding five years “for the purpose or with the effect of\ndenying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or\ncolor.” §4(a), id., at 438. In 1965, the covered States\nincluded Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South\nCarolina, and Virginia. The additional covered subdivi-\nsions included 39 counties in North Carolina and one in\nArizona. See 28 CFR pt. 51, App. (2012).\n  In those jurisdictions, §4 of the Act banned all such tests\nor devices. §4(a), 79 Stat. 438. Section 5 provided that no\nchange in voting procedures could take effect until it was\napproved by federal authorities in Washington, D. C.—\neither the Attorney General or a court of three judges. Id.,\nat 439. A jurisdiction could obtain such “preclearance”\nonly by proving that the change had neither “the purpose\n[nor] the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on\naccount of race or color.” Ibid.\n  Sections 4 and 5 were intended to be temporary; they\nwere set to expire after five years. See §4(a), id., at 438;\nNorthwest Austin, supra, at 199. In South Carolina v.\nKatzenbach, we upheld the 1965 Act against constitutional\nchallenge, explaining that it was justified to address “vot-\ning discrimination where it persists on a pervasive scale.”\n383 U. S., at 308.\n  In 1970, Congress reauthorized the Act for another five\nyears, and extended the coverage formula in §4(b) to juris-\ndictions that had a voting test and less than 50 percent\nvoter registration or turnout as of 1968. Voting Rights Act\nAmendments of 1970, §§3–4, 84 Stat. 315. That swept in\nseveral counties in California, New Hampshire, and New\nYork. See 28 CFR pt. 51, App. Congress also extended\nthe ban in §4(a) on tests and devices nationwide. §6, 84\nStat. 315.\n  In 1975, Congress reauthorized the Act for seven more\nyears, and extended its coverage to jurisdictions that had\na voting test and less than 50 percent voter registration or\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nturnout as of 1972. Voting Rights Act Amendments of\n1975, §§101, 202, 89 Stat. 400, 401. Congress also amend-\ned the definition of “test or device” to include the practice\nof providing English-only voting materials in places where\nover five percent of voting-age citizens spoke a single\nlanguage other than English. §203, id., at 401–402. As a\nresult of these amendments, the States of Alaska, Arizona,\nand Texas, as well as several counties in California, Flor-\nida, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and South Da-\nkota, became covered jurisdictions. See 28 CFR pt. 51, App.\nCongress correspondingly amended sections 2 and 5 to\nforbid voting discrimination on the basis of membership in\na language minority group, in addition to discrimination\non the basis of race or color. §§203, 206, 89 Stat. 401, 402.\nFinally, Congress made the nationwide ban on tests and\ndevices permanent. §102, id., at 400.\n   In 1982, Congress reauthorized the Act for 25 years, but\ndid not alter its coverage formula. See Voting Rights Act\nAmendments, 96 Stat. 131. Congress did, however, amend\nthe bailout provisions, allowing political subdivisions of\ncovered jurisdictions to bail out. Among other prerequi-\nsites for bailout, jurisdictions and their subdivisions must\nnot have used a forbidden test or device, failed to receive\npreclearance, or lost a §2 suit, in the ten years prior to\nseeking bailout. §2, id., at 131–133.\n   We upheld each of these reauthorizations against con-\nstitutional challenge. See Georgia v. United States, 411\nU. S. 526 (1973); City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S.\n156 (1980); Lopez v. Monterey County, 525 U. S. 266\n(1999).\n   In 2006, Congress again reauthorized the Voting Rights\nAct for 25 years, again without change to its coverage\nformula. Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta\nScott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amend-\nments Act, 120 Stat. 577. Congress also amended §5 to\nprohibit more conduct than before. §5, id., at 580–\n\f6                SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n581; see Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 528 U. S. 320,\n341 (2000) (Bossier II); Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461,\n479 (2003). Section 5 now forbids voting changes with\n“any discriminatory purpose” as well as voting changes\nthat diminish the ability of citizens, on account of race,\ncolor, or language minority status, “to elect their preferred\ncandidates of choice.” 42 U. S. C. §§1973c(b)–(d).\n   Shortly after this reauthorization, a Texas utility district\nbrought suit, seeking to bail out from the Act’s cover-\nage and, in the alternative, challenging the Act’s constitu-\ntionality. See Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 200–201. A\nthree-judge District Court explained that only a State or\npolitical subdivision was eligible to seek bailout under the\nstatute, and concluded that the utility district was not a\npolitical subdivision, a term that encompassed only “coun-\nties, parishes, and voter-registering subunits.” Northwest\nAustin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Mukasey, 573\nF. Supp. 2d 221, 232 (DC 2008). The District Court also\nrejected the constitutional challenge. Id., at 283.\n   We reversed. We explained that “ ‘normally the Court\nwill not decide a constitutional question if there is some\nother ground upon which to dispose of the case.’ ” North-\nwest Austin, supra, at 205 (quoting Escambia County v.\nMcMillan, 466 U. S. 48, 51 (1984) (per curiam)). Conclud-\ning that “underlying constitutional concerns,” among other\nthings, “compel[led] a broader reading of the bailout provi-\nsion,” we construed the statute to allow the utility district\nto seek bailout. Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 207. In\ndoing so we expressed serious doubts about the Act’s con-\ntinued constitutionality.\n   We explained that §5 “imposes substantial federalism\ncosts” and “differentiates between the States, despite our his-\ntoric tradition that all the States enjoy equal sovereignty.”\nId., at 202, 203 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nWe also noted that “[t]hings have changed in the South.\nVoter turnout and registration rates now approach parity.\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U.

And minority candidates hold office at unprece-\ndented levels.” Id., at 202. Finally, we questioned whether\nthe problems that §5 meant to address were still “concen-\ntrated in the jurisdictions singled out for preclearance.”\nId., at 203.\n   Eight Members of the Court subscribed to these views,\nand the remaining Member would have held the Act un-\nconstitutional. Ultimately, however, the Court’s construc-\ntion of the bailout provision left the constitutional issues\nfor another day.\n                              B\n   Shelby County is located in Alabama, a covered jurisdic-\ntion. It has not sought bailout, as the Attorney General\nhas recently objected to voting changes proposed from\nwithin the county. See App. 87a–92a. Instead, in 2010,\nthe county sued the Attorney General in Federal District\nCourt in Washington, D. C., seeking a declaratory judg-\nment that sections 4(b) and 5 of the Voting Rights Act are\nfacially unconstitutional, as well as a permanent injunc-\ntion against their enforcement. The District Court ruled\nagainst the county and upheld the Act. 811 F. Supp. 2d\n424, 508 (2011). The court found that the evidence before\nCongress in 2006 was sufficient to justify reauthorizing §5\nand continuing the §4(b) coverage formula.\n   The Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit affirmed. In\nassessing §5, the D. C. Circuit considered six primary\ncategories of evidence: Attorney General objections to\nvoting changes, Attorney General requests for more in-\nformation regarding voting changes, successful §2 suits in\ncovered jurisdictions, the dispatching of federal observers\nto monitor elections in covered jurisdictions, §5 preclear-\nance suits involving covered jurisdictions, and the deter-\nrent effect of §5. See 679 F. 3d 848, 862–863 (2012). After\nextensive analysis of the record, the court accepted Con-\n\f8                SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngress’s conclusion that §2 litigation remained inadequate\nin the covered jurisdictions to protect the rights of minori-\nty voters, and that §5 was therefore still necessary. Id.,\nat 873.\n   Turning to §4, the D. C. Circuit noted that the evidence\nfor singling out the covered jurisdictions was “less robust”\nand that the issue presented “a close question.” Id., at\n879. But the court looked to data comparing the number\nof successful §2 suits in the different parts of the country.\nCoupling that evidence with the deterrent effect of §5, the\ncourt concluded that the statute continued “to single out\nthe jurisdictions in which discrimination is concentrated,”\nand thus held that the coverage formula passed constitu-\ntional muster. Id., at 883.\n   Judge Williams dissented. He found “no positive cor-\nrelation between inclusion in §4(b)’s coverage formula and\nlow black registration or turnout.” Id., at 891. Rather,\nto the extent there was any correlation, it actually went\nthe other way: “condemnation under §4(b) is a marker of\nhigher black registration and turnout.” Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). Judge Williams also found that “[c]overed juris-\ndictions have far more black officeholders as a proportion\nof the black population than do uncovered ones.” Id., at\n892. As to the evidence of successful §2 suits, Judge Wil-\nliams disaggregated the reported cases by State, and\nconcluded that “[t]he five worst uncovered jurisdictions . . .\nhave worse records than eight of the covered jurisdic-\ntions.” Id., at 897. He also noted that two covered juris-\ndictions—Arizona and Alaska—had not had any successful\nreported §2 suit brought against them during the entire 24\nyears covered by the data. Ibid. Judge Williams would\nhave held the coverage formula of §4(b) “irrational” and\nunconstitutional. Id., at 885.\n   We granted certiorari. 568 U. S. ___ (2012).\n\f                    Cite as: 570 U.

S., at 203. And we concluded that “a departure\nfrom the fundamental principle of equal sovereignty re-\nquires a showing that a statute’s disparate geographic\ncoverage is sufficiently related to the problem that it\ntargets.” Ibid. These basic principles guide our review of\nthe question before us.1\n                               A\n   The Constitution and laws of the United States are “the\nsupreme Law of the Land.” U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.\nState legislation may not contravene federal law. The\nFederal Government does not, however, have a general\nright to review and veto state enactments before they go\ninto effect. A proposal to grant such authority to “nega-\ntive” state laws was considered at the Constitutional\nConvention, but rejected in favor of allowing state laws to\ntake effect, subject to later challenge under the Supremacy\nClause. See 1 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787,\npp. 21, 164–168 (M. Farrand ed. 1911); 2 id., at 27–29,\n390–392.\n   Outside the strictures of the Supremacy Clause, States\nretain broad autonomy in structuring their governments\nand pursuing legislative objectives. Indeed, the Constitu-\ntion provides that all powers not specifically granted to the\nFederal Government are reserved to the States or citizens.\nAmdt. 10. This “allocation of powers in our federal system\npreserves the integrity, dignity, and residual sovereignty\nof the States.” Bond v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___\n——————\n  1 Both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were at issue in\n\nNorthwest Austin, see Juris. Statement i, and Brief for Federal Appel-\nlee 29–30, in Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder,\nO.

But the federal balance “is not just\nan end in itself: Rather, federalism secures to citizens the\nliberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign power.”\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   More specifically, “ ‘the Framers of the Constitution\nintended the States to keep for themselves, as provided in\nthe Tenth Amendment, the power to regulate elections.’ ”\nGregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 461–462 (1991) (quot-\ning Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U. S. 634, 647 (1973); some\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Of course, the Federal\nGovernment retains significant control over federal elec-\ntions. For instance, the Constitution authorizes Congress\nto establish the time and manner for electing Senators and\nRepresentatives. Art. I, §4, cl. 1; see also Arizona v. Inter\nTribal Council of Ariz., Inc., ante, at 4–6. But States have\n“broad powers to determine the conditions under which\nthe right of suffrage may be exercised.” Carrington v.\nRash, 380 U. S. 89, 91 (1965) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also Arizona, ante, at 13–15. And “[e]ach\nState has the power to prescribe the qualifications of its\nofficers and the manner in which they shall be chosen.”\nBoyd v. Nebraska ex rel. Thayer, 143 U. S. 135, 161 (1892).\nDrawing lines for congressional districts is likewise “pri-\nmarily the duty and responsibility of the State.” Perry v.\nPerez, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 3)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Not only do States retain sovereignty under the Consti-\ntution, there is also a “fundamental principle of equal\nsovereignty” among the States. Northwest Austin, supra,\nat 203 (citing United States v. Louisiana, 363 U. S. 1, 16\n(1960); Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 223 (1845);\nand Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725–726 (1869); emphasis\nadded). Over a hundred years ago, this Court explained\nthat our Nation “was and is a union of States, equal in\npower, dignity and authority.” Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S.\n559, 567 (1911). Indeed, “the constitutional equality of the\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates is essential to the harmonious operation of the\nscheme upon which the Republic was organized.” Id., at\n580. Coyle concerned the admission of new States, and\nKatzenbach rejected the notion that the principle operated\nas a bar on differential treatment outside that context.\n383 U. S., at 328–329. At the same time, as we made clear\nin Northwest Austin, the fundamental principle of equal\nsovereignty remains highly pertinent in assessing subse-\nquent disparate treatment of States. 557 U. S., at 203.\n   The Voting Rights Act sharply departs from these basic\nprinciples. It suspends “all changes to state election law—\nhowever innocuous—until they have been precleared\nby federal authorities in Washington, D. C.” Id., at 202.\nStates must beseech the Federal Government for permis-\nsion to implement laws that they would otherwise have\nthe right to enact and execute on their own, subject of\ncourse to any injunction in a §2 action. The Attorney\nGeneral has 60 days to object to a preclearance request,\nlonger if he requests more information. See 28 CFR\n§§51.9, 51.37. If a State seeks preclearance from a three-\njudge court, the process can take years.\n   And despite the tradition of equal sovereignty, the Act\napplies to only nine States (and several additional coun-\nties). While one State waits months or years and expends\nfunds to implement a validly enacted law, its neighbor\ncan typically put the same law into effect immediately,\nthrough the normal legislative process. Even if a noncov-\nered jurisdiction is sued, there are important differences\nbetween those proceedings and preclearance proceedings;\nthe preclearance proceeding “not only switches the burden\nof proof to the supplicant jurisdiction, but also applies\nsubstantive standards quite different from those govern-\ning the rest of the nation.” 679 F. 3d, at 884 (Williams, J.,\ndissenting) (case below).\n   All this explains why, when we first upheld the Act in\n1966, we described it as “stringent” and “potent.” Katzen-\n\f12              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbach, 383 U. S., at 308, 315, 337. We recognized that it\n“may have been an uncommon exercise of congressional\npower,” but concluded that “legislative measures not oth-\nerwise appropriate” could be justified by “exceptional con-\nditions.” Id., at 334. We have since noted that the Act\n“authorizes federal intrusion into sensitive areas of state\nand local policymaking,” Lopez, 525 U. S., at 282, and\nrepresents an “extraordinary departure from the tradi-\ntional course of relations between the States and the\nFederal Government,” Presley v. Etowah County Comm’n,\n502 U. S. 491, 500–501 (1992). As we reiterated in\nNorthwest Austin, the Act constitutes “extraordinary\nlegislation otherwise unfamiliar to our federal system.”\n557 U. S., at 211.\n                             B\n  In 1966, we found these departures from the basic fea-\ntures of our system of government justified. The “blight of\nracial discrimination in voting” had “infected the electoral\nprocess in parts of our country for nearly a century.”\nKatzenbach, 383 U. S., at 308. Several States had enacted\na variety of requirements and tests “specifically designed\nto prevent” African-Americans from voting. Id., at 310.\nCase-by-case litigation had proved inadequate to prevent\nsuch racial discrimination in voting, in part because\nStates “merely switched to discriminatory devices not\ncovered by the federal decrees,” “enacted difficult new\ntests,” or simply “defied and evaded court orders.” Id., at\n314. Shortly before enactment of the Voting Rights Act,\nonly 19.4 percent of African-Americans of voting age were\nregistered to vote in Alabama, only 31.8 percent in Louisi-\nana, and only 6.4 percent in Mississippi. Id., at 313.\nThose figures were roughly 50 percentage points or more\nbelow the figures for whites. Ibid.\n  In short, we concluded that “[u]nder the compulsion of\nthese unique circumstances, Congress responded in a\n\f                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npermissibly decisive manner.” Id., at 334, 335. We also\nnoted then and have emphasized since that this extra-\nordinary legislation was intended to be temporary, set to\nexpire after five years. Id., at 333; Northwest Austin,\nsupra, at 199.\n   At the time, the coverage formula—the means of linking\nthe exercise of the unprecedented authority with the\nproblem that warranted it—made sense. We found that\n“Congress chose to limit its attention to the geographic\nareas where immediate action seemed necessary.” Kat-\nzenbach, 383 U. S., at 328. The areas where Congress\nfound “evidence of actual voting discrimination” shared\ntwo characteristics: “the use of tests and devices for voter\nregistration, and a voting rate in the 1964 presidential\nelection at least 12 points below the national average.”\nId., at 330. We explained that “[t]ests and devices are\nrelevant to voting discrimination because of their long\nhistory as a tool for perpetrating the evil; a low voting rate\nis pertinent for the obvious reason that widespread disen-\nfranchisement must inevitably affect the number of actual\nvoters.” Ibid. We therefore concluded that “the coverage\nformula [was] rational in both practice and theory.” Ibid.\nIt accurately reflected those jurisdictions uniquely charac-\nterized by voting discrimination “on a pervasive scale,”\nlinking coverage to the devices used to effectuate discrimi-\nnation and to the resulting disenfranchisement. Id., at\n308. The formula ensured that the “stringent remedies\n[were] aimed at areas where voting discrimination ha[d]\nbeen most flagrant.” Id., at 315.\n                             C\n   Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramati-\ncally. Shelby County contends that the preclearance re-\nquirement, even without regard to its disparate coverage,\nis now unconstitutional. Its arguments have a good deal\nof force. In the covered jurisdictions, “[v]oter turnout and\n\f14              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nregistration rates now approach parity. Blatantly discrim-\ninatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. And minority\ncandidates hold office at unprecedented levels.” Northwest\nAustin, 557 U. S., at 202. The tests and devices that\nblocked access to the ballot have been forbidden nation-\nwide for over 40 years. See §6, 84 Stat. 315; §102, 89 Stat.\n400.\n   Those conclusions are not ours alone. Congress said the\nsame when it reauthorized the Act in 2006, writing that\n“[s]ignificant progress has been made in eliminating first\ngeneration barriers experienced by minority voters, in-\ncluding increased numbers of registered minority voters,\nminority voter turnout, and minority representation in\nCongress, State legislatures, and local elected offices.”\n§2(b)(1), 120 Stat. 577. The House Report elaborated that\n“the number of African-Americans who are registered and\nwho turn out to cast ballots has increased significantly\nover the last 40 years, particularly since 1982,” and noted\nthat “[i]n some circumstances, minorities register to vote\nand cast ballots at levels that surpass those of white vot-\ners.” H. R. Rep. No. 109–478, p. 12 (2006). That Report\nalso explained that there have been “significant increases\nin the number of African-Americans serving in elected\noffices”; more specifically, there has been approximately\na 1,000 percent increase since 1965 in the number of\nAfrican-American elected officials in the six States origi-\nnally covered by the Voting Rights Act. Id., at 18.\n   The following chart, compiled from the Senate and\nHouse Reports, compares voter registration numbers from\n1965 to those from 2004 in the six originally covered\nStates. These are the numbers that were before Congress\nwhen it reauthorized the Act in 2006:\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U.

Rep. No. 109–295, p. 11 (2006); H. R. Rep. No. 109–\n478, at 12. The 2004 figures come from the Census Bu-\nreau. Census Bureau data from the most recent election\nindicate that African-American voter turnout exceeded\nwhite voter turnout in five of the six States originally\ncovered by §5, with a gap in the sixth State of less than\none half of one percent. See Dept. of Commerce, Census\nBureau, Reported Voting and Registration, by Sex, Race\nand Hispanic Origin, for States (Table 4b). The preclear-\nance statistics are also illuminating. In the first decade\nafter enactment of §5, the Attorney General objected to\n14.2 percent of proposed voting changes. H. R Rep. No.\n109–478, at 22. In the last decade before reenactment, the\nAttorney General objected to a mere 0.16 percent. S. Rep.\nNo. 109–295, at 13.\n  There is no doubt that these improvements are in large\npart because of the Voting Rights Act. The Act has proved\nimmensely successful at redressing racial discrimination\nand integrating the voting process. See §2(b)(1), 120 Stat.\n577. During the “Freedom Summer” of 1964, in Philadel-\nphia, Mississippi, three men were murdered while work-\ning in the area to register African-American voters. See\nUnited States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 790 (1966). On\n“Bloody Sunday” in 1965, in Selma, Alabama, police beat\n\f16              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand used tear gas against hundreds marching in sup-\nport of African-American enfranchisement. See Northwest\nAustin, supra, at 220, n. 3 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part). Today both of\nthose towns are governed by African-American mayors.\nProblems remain in these States and others, but there is\nno denying that, due to the Voting Rights Act, our Nation\nhas made great strides.\n   Yet the Act has not eased the restrictions in §5 or nar-\nrowed the scope of the coverage formula in §4(b) along the\nway. Those extraordinary and unprecedented features\nwere reauthorized—as if nothing had changed. In fact,\nthe Act’s unusual remedies have grown even stronger.\nWhen Congress reauthorized the Act in 2006, it did so for\nanother 25 years on top of the previous 40—a far cry from\nthe initial five-year period. See 42 U. S. C. §1973b(a)(8).\nCongress also expanded the prohibitions in §5. We had\npreviously interpreted §5 to prohibit only those redistrict-\ning plans that would have the purpose or effect of worsen-\ning the position of minority groups. See Bossier II, 528\nU. S., at 324, 335–336. In 2006, Congress amended §5\nto prohibit laws that could have favored such groups but\ndid not do so because of a discriminatory purpose, see 42\nU. S. C. §1973c(c), even though we had stated that such\nbroadening of §5 coverage would “exacerbate the substan-\ntial federalism costs that the preclearance procedure\nalready exacts, perhaps to the extent of raising concerns\nabout §5’s constitutionality,” Bossier II, supra, at 336\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In addi-\ntion, Congress expanded §5 to prohibit any voting law\n“that has the purpose of or will have the effect of diminish-\ning the ability of any citizens of the United States,” on\naccount of race, color, or language minority status, “to\nelect their preferred candidates of choice.” §1973c(b). In\nlight of those two amendments, the bar that covered juris-\ndictions must clear has been raised even as the conditions\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njustifying that requirement have dramatically improved.\n   We have also previously highlighted the concern that\n“the preclearance requirements in one State [might]\nbe unconstitutional in another.” Northwest Austin, 557\nU. S., at 203; see Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S., at 491\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring) (“considerations of race that\nwould doom a redistricting plan under the Fourteenth\nAmendment or §2 [of the Voting Rights Act] seem to be\nwhat save it under §5”). Nothing has happened since to\nalleviate this troubling concern about the current applica-\ntion of §5.\n   Respondents do not deny that there have been im-\nprovements on the ground, but argue that much of this\ncan be attributed to the deterrent effect of §5, which dis-\nsuades covered jurisdictions from engaging in discrimina-\ntion that they would resume should §5 be struck down.\nUnder this theory, however, §5 would be effectively im-\nmune from scrutiny; no matter how “clean” the record\nof covered jurisdictions, the argument could always be\nmade that it was deterrence that accounted for the good\nbehavior.\n   The provisions of §5 apply only to those jurisdictions\nsingled out by §4. We now consider whether that coverage\nformula is constitutional in light of current conditions.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n  When upholding the constitutionality of the coverage\nformula in 1966, we concluded that it was “rational in both\npractice and theory.” Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 330. The\nformula looked to cause (discriminatory tests) and ef-\nfect (low voter registration and turnout), and tailored the\nremedy (preclearance) to those jurisdictions exhibiting\nboth.\n  By 2009, however, we concluded that the “coverage\nformula raise[d] serious constitutional questions.” North-\n\f18               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 204. As we explained, a stat-\nute’s “current burdens” must be justified by “current\nneeds,” and any “disparate geographic coverage” must be\n“sufficiently related to the problem that it targets.” Id., at\n203. The coverage formula met that test in 1965, but no\nlonger does so.\n  Coverage today is based on decades-old data and eradi-\ncated practices. The formula captures States by reference\nto literacy tests and low voter registration and turnout in\nthe 1960s and early 1970s. But such tests have been\nbanned nationwide for over 40 years. §6, 84 Stat. 315;\n§102, 89 Stat. 400. And voter registration and turnout\nnumbers in the covered States have risen dramatically in\nthe years since. H. R. Rep. No. 109–478, at 12. Racial\ndisparity in those numbers was compelling evidence justi-\nfying the preclearance remedy and the coverage formula.\nSee, e.g., Katzenbach, supra, at 313, 329–330. There is no\nlonger such a disparity.\n  In 1965, the States could be divided into two groups:\nthose with a recent history of voting tests and low voter\nregistration and turnout, and those without those charac-\nteristics. Congress based its coverage formula on that\ndistinction. Today the Nation is no longer divided along\nthose lines, yet the Voting Rights Act continues to treat it\nas if it were.\n                              B\n  The Government’s defense of the formula is limited.\nFirst, the Government contends that the formula is “re-\nverse-engineered”: Congress identified the jurisdictions to\nbe covered and then came up with criteria to describe\nthem.

Under that\nreasoning, there need not be any logical relationship be-\ntween the criteria in the formula and the reason for\ncoverage; all that is necessary is that the formula happen\nto capture the jurisdictions Congress wanted to single out.\n\f                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Government suggests that Katzenbach sanctioned\nsuch an approach, but the analysis in Katzenbach was\nquite different. Katzenbach reasoned that the coverage\nformula was rational because the “formula . . . was rele-\nvant to the problem”: “Tests and devices are relevant to\nvoting discrimination because of their long history as a\ntool for perpetrating the evil; a low voting rate is pertinent\nfor the obvious reason that widespread disenfranchise-\nment must inevitably affect the number of actual voters.”\n383 U. S., at 329, 330.\n   Here, by contrast, the Government’s reverse-\nengineering argument does not even attempt to demon-\nstrate the continued relevance of the formula to the problem\nit targets. And in the context of a decision as significant\nas this one—subjecting a disfavored subset of States\nto “extraordinary legislation otherwise unfamiliar to our\nfederal system,” Northwest Austin, supra, at 211—that\nfailure to establish even relevance is fatal.\n   The Government falls back to the argument that be-\ncause the formula was relevant in 1965, its continued use\nis permissible so long as any discrimination remains in the\nStates Congress identified back then—regardless of how\nthat discrimination compares to discrimination in States\nunburdened by coverage. Brief for Federal Respondent\n49–50. This argument does not look to “current political\nconditions,” Northwest Austin, supra, at 203, but instead\nrelies on a comparison between the States in 1965. That\ncomparison reflected the different histories of the North\nand South. It was in the South that slavery was upheld by\nlaw until uprooted by the Civil War, that the reign of Jim\nCrow denied African-Americans the most basic freedoms,\nand that state and local governments worked tirelessly to\ndisenfranchise citizens on the basis of race. The Court\ninvoked that history—rightly so—in sustaining the dis-\nparate coverage of the Voting Rights Act in 1966. See\nKatzenbach, supra, at 308 (“The constitutional propriety of\n\f20              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965 must be judged with refer-\nence to the historical experience which it reflects.”).\n   But history did not end in 1965. By the time the Act\nwas reauthorized in 2006, there had been 40 more years of\nit. In assessing the “current need[ ]” for a preclearance\nsystem that treats States differently from one another\ntoday, that history cannot be ignored. During that time,\nlargely because of the Voting Rights Act, voting tests were\nabolished, disparities in voter registration and turnout\ndue to race were erased, and African-Americans attained\npolitical office in record numbers. And yet the coverage\nformula that Congress reauthorized in 2006 ignores these\ndevelopments, keeping the focus on decades-old data rel-\nevant to decades-old problems, rather than current data\nreflecting current needs.\n   The Fifteenth Amendment commands that the right to\nvote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race or\ncolor, and it gives Congress the power to enforce that\ncommand. The Amendment is not designed to punish for\nthe past; its purpose is to ensure a better future. See Rice\nv. Cayetano, 528 U. S. 495, 512 (2000) (“Consistent with\nthe design of the Constitution, the [Fifteenth] Amendment\nis cast in fundamental terms, terms transcending the\nparticular controversy which was the immediate impetus\nfor its enactment.”). To serve that purpose, Congress—if it\nis to divide the States—must identify those jurisdictions to\nbe singled out on a basis that makes sense in light of\ncurrent conditions. It cannot rely simply on the past. We\nmade that clear in Northwest Austin, and we make it clear\nagain today.\n                             C\n  In defending the coverage formula, the Government, the\nintervenors, and the dissent also rely heavily on data from\nthe record that they claim justify disparate coverage.\nCongress compiled thousands of pages of evidence before\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreauthorizing the Voting Rights Act. The court below and\nthe parties have debated what that record shows—they\nhave gone back and forth about whether to compare cov-\nered to noncovered jurisdictions as blocks, how to dis-\naggregate the data State by State, how to weigh §2 cases\nas evidence of ongoing discrimination, and whether to\nconsider evidence not before Congress, among other is-\nsues. Compare, e.g., 679 F. 3d, at 873–883 (case below),\nwith id., at 889–902 (Williams, J., dissenting). Regardless\nof how to look at the record, however, no one can fairly say\nthat it shows anything approaching the “pervasive,” “fla-\ngrant,” “widespread,” and “rampant” discrimination that\nfaced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the\ncovered jurisdictions from the rest of the Nation at that\ntime. Katzenbach, supra, at 308, 315, 331; Northwest\nAustin, 557 U. S., at 201.\n   But a more fundamental problem remains: Congress did\nnot use the record it compiled to shape a coverage formula\ngrounded in current conditions. It instead reenacted a\nformula based on 40-year-old facts having no logical rela-\ntion to the present day. The dissent relies on “second-\ngeneration barriers,” which are not impediments to the\ncasting of ballots, but rather electoral arrangements that\naffect the weight of minority votes. That does not cure the\nproblem. Viewing the preclearance requirements as tar-\ngeting such efforts simply highlights the irrationality of\ncontinued reliance on the §4 coverage formula, which is\nbased on voting tests and access to the ballot, not vote\ndilution. We cannot pretend that we are reviewing an\nupdated statute, or try our hand at updating the statute\nourselves, based on the new record compiled by Congress.\nContrary to the dissent’s contention, see post, at 23, we are\nnot ignoring the record; we are simply recognizing that it\nplayed no role in shaping the statutory formula before us\ntoday.\n   The dissent also turns to the record to argue that, in\n\f22              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlight of voting discrimination in Shelby County, the county\ncannot complain about the provisions that subject it to\npreclearance. Post, at 23–30. But that is like saying that\na driver pulled over pursuant to a policy of stopping all\nredheads cannot complain about that policy, if it turns out\nhis license has expired. Shelby County’s claim is that the\ncoverage formula here is unconstitutional in all its appli-\ncations, because of how it selects the jurisdictions sub-\njected to preclearance. The county was selected based on\nthat formula, and may challenge it in court.\n                             D\n   The dissent proceeds from a flawed premise. It quotes\nthe famous sentence from McCulloch v. Maryland, 4\nWheat. 316, 421 (1819), with the following emphasis: “Let\nthe end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the\nconstitution, and all means which are appropriate, which\nare plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited,\nbut consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution,\nare constitutional.” Post, at 9 (emphasis in dissent). But\nthis case is about a part of the sentence that the dissent\ndoes not emphasize—the part that asks whether a legisla-\ntive means is “consist[ent] with the letter and spirit of the\nconstitution.” The dissent states that “[i]t cannot tenably\nbe maintained” that this is an issue with regard to the\nVoting Rights Act, post, at 9, but four years ago, in an\nopinion joined by two of today’s dissenters, the Court\nexpressly stated that “[t]he Act’s preclearance require-\nment and its coverage formula raise serious constitutional\nquestions.” Northwest Austin, supra, at 204. The dissent\ndoes not explain how those “serious constitutional ques-\ntions” became untenable in four short years.\n   The dissent treats the Act as if it were just like any\nother piece of legislation, but this Court has made clear\nfrom the beginning that the Voting Rights Act is far from\nordinary. At the risk of repetition, Katzenbach indicated\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the Act was “uncommon” and “not otherwise appro-\npriate,” but was justified by “exceptional” and “unique”\nconditions. 383 U. S., at 334, 335. Multiple decisions\nsince have reaffirmed the Act’s “extraordinary” nature.\nSee, e.g., Northwest Austin, supra, at 211. Yet the dissent\ngoes so far as to suggest instead that the preclearance\nrequirement and disparate treatment of the States should\nbe upheld into the future “unless there [is] no or almost no\nevidence of unconstitutional action by States.” Post, at 33.\n   In other ways as well, the dissent analyzes the ques-\ntion presented as if our decision in Northwest Austin never\nhappened. For example, the dissent refuses to con-\nsider the principle of equal sovereignty, despite Northwest\nAustin’s emphasis on its significance. Northwest Austin\nalso emphasized the “dramatic” progress since 1965, 557\nU. S., at 201, but the dissent describes current levels of\ndiscrimination as “flagrant,” “widespread,” and “perva-\nsive,” post, at 7, 17 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nDespite the fact that Northwest Austin requires an Act’s\n“disparate geographic coverage” to be “sufficiently related”\nto its targeted problems, 557 U. S., at 203, the dissent\nmaintains that an Act’s limited coverage actually eases\nCongress’s burdens, and suggests that a fortuitous rela-\ntionship should suffice. Although Northwest Austin stated\ndefinitively that “current burdens” must be justified by\n“current needs,” ibid., the dissent argues that the coverage\nformula can be justified by history, and that the required\nshowing can be weaker on reenactment than when the law\nwas first passed.\n   There is no valid reason to insulate the coverage for-\nmula from review merely because it was previously enacted\n40 years ago. If Congress had started from scratch in\n2006, it plainly could not have enacted the present cover-\nage formula. It would have been irrational for Congress to\ndistinguish between States in such a fundamental way\nbased on 40-year-old data, when today’s statistics tell an\n\f24              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nentirely different story. And it would have been irrational\nto base coverage on the use of voting tests 40 years ago,\nwhen such tests have been illegal since that time. But\nthat is exactly what Congress has done.\n                         *    *    *\n   Striking down an Act of Congress “is the gravest and\nmost delicate duty that this Court is called on to perform.”\nBlodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, J.,\nconcurring). We do not do so lightly. That is why, in 2009,\nwe took care to avoid ruling on the constitutionality of\nthe Voting Rights Act when asked to do so, and instead\nresolved the case then before us on statutory grounds. But\nin issuing that decision, we expressed our broader con-\ncerns about the constitutionality of the Act. Congress\ncould have updated the coverage formula at that time, but\ndid not do so. Its failure to act leaves us today with no\nchoice but to declare §4(b) unconstitutional. The formula\nin that section can no longer be used as a basis for subject-\ning jurisdictions to preclearance.\n   Our decision in no way affects the permanent, nation-\nwide ban on racial discrimination in voting found in §2.\nWe issue no holding on §5 itself, only on the coverage\nformula. Congress may draft another formula based on\ncurrent conditions. Such a formula is an initial prerequi-\nsite to a determination that exceptional conditions still\nexist justifying such an “extraordinary departure from the\ntraditional course of relations between the States and the\nFederal Government.” Presley, 502 U. S., at 500–501. Our\ncountry has changed, and while any racial discrimination\nin voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the\nlegislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to\ncurrent conditions.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 570 U.

The Court’s opinion sets forth the\nreasons.\n    “The Voting Rights Act of 1965 employed extraordinary\nmeasures to address an extraordinary problem.” Ante, at\n1. In the face of “unremitting and ingenious defiance” of\ncitizens’ constitutionally protected right to vote, §5 was\nnecessary to give effect to the Fifteenth Amendment in\nparticular regions of the country. South Carolina v. Katzen-\nbach, 383 U. S. 301, 309 (1966). Though §5’s preclear-\nance requirement represented a “shar[p] depart[ure]” from\n“basic principles” of federalism and the equal sovereignty\nof the States, ante, at 9, 11, the Court upheld the measure\nagainst early constitutional challenges because it was\nnecessary at the time to address “voting discrimination\nwhere it persist[ed] on a pervasive scale.” Katzenbach,\nsupra, at 308.\n    Today, our Nation has changed. “[T]he conditions that\noriginally justified [§5] no longer characterize voting in the\ncovered jurisdictions.” Ante, at 2. As the Court explains:\n“ ‘[V]oter turnout and registration rates now approach\nparity. Blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal de-\n\f2                SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\ncrees are rare. And minority candidates hold office at un-\nprecedented levels.’ ” Ante, at 13–14 (quoting Northwest\nAustin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U. S.\n193, 202 (2009)).\n   In spite of these improvements, however, Congress\nincreased the already significant burdens of §5. Following\nits reenactment in 2006, the Voting Rights Act was\namended to “prohibit more conduct than before.” Ante,\nat 5. “Section 5 now forbids voting changes with ‘any dis-\ncriminatory purpose’ as well as voting changes that dimin-\nish the ability of citizens, on account of race, color, or\nlanguage minority status, ‘to elect their preferred candi-\ndates of choice.’ ” Ante, at 6. While the pre-2006 version of\nthe Act went well beyond protection guaranteed under the\nConstitution, see Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 520\nU. S. 471, 480–482 (1997), it now goes even further.\n   It is, thus, quite fitting that the Court repeatedly points\nout that this legislation is “extraordinary” and “unprece-\ndented” and recognizes the significant constitutional\nproblems created by Congress’ decision to raise “the bar\nthat covered jurisdictions must clear,” even as “the condi-\ntions justifying that requirement have dramatically im-\nproved.” Ante, at 16–17. However one aggregates the\ndata compiled by Congress, it cannot justify the consider-\nable burdens created by §5. As the Court aptly notes:\n“[N]o one can fairly say that [the record] shows anything\napproaching the ‘pervasive,’ ‘flagrant,’ ‘widespread,’ and\n‘rampant’ discrimination that faced Congress in 1965, and\nthat clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions from\nthe rest of the Nation at that time.” Ante, at 21. Indeed,\ncircumstances in the covered jurisdictions can no longer be\ncharacterized as “exceptional” or “unique.” “The extensive\npattern of discrimination that led the Court to previously\nuphold §5 as enforcing the Fifteenth Amendment no longer\nexists.” Northwest Austin, supra, at 226 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).\n\f                  Cite as: 570 U.

By leaving the\ninevitable conclusion unstated, the Court needlessly pro-\nlongs the demise of that provision. For the reasons stated\nin the Court’s opinion, I would find §5 unconstitutional.\n\f                    Cite as: 570 U.

Congress was of\nanother mind. Recognizing that large progress has been\nmade, Congress determined, based on a voluminous rec­\nord, that the scourge of discrimination was not yet extir­\npated. The question this case presents is who decides\nwhether, as currently operative, §5 remains justifiable,1\nthis Court, or a Congress charged with the obligation to\nenforce the post-Civil War Amendments “by appropriate\nlegislation.” With overwhelming support in both Houses,\nCongress concluded that, for two prime reasons, §5 should\ncontinue in force, unabated. First, continuance would\nfacilitate completion of the impressive gains thus far\nmade; and second, continuance would guard against back­\nsliding. Those assessments were well within Congress’\nprovince to make and should elicit this Court’s unstinting\napprobation.\n                             I\n  “[V]oting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that.”\n——————\n   1 The Court purports to declare unconstitutional only the coverage\n\nformula set out in §4(b). See ante, at 24. But without that formula, §5\nis immobilized.\n\f2               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nAnte, at 2. But the Court today terminates the remedy\nthat proved to be best suited to block that discrimination.\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) has worked to com­\nbat voting discrimination where other remedies had been\ntried and failed. Particularly effective is the VRA’s re­\nquirement of federal preclearance for all changes to voting\nlaws in the regions of the country with the most aggravated\nrecords of rank discrimination against minority voting\nrights.\n   A century after the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amend­\nments guaranteed citizens the right to vote free of dis­\ncrimination on the basis of race, the “blight of racial\ndiscrimination in voting” continued to “infec[t] the\nelectoral process in parts of our country.” South Carolina v.\nKatzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308 (1966). Early attempts to\ncope with this vile infection resembled battling the Hydra.\nWhenever one form of voting discrimination was identified\nand prohibited, others sprang up in its place. This Court\nrepeatedly encountered the remarkable “variety and\npersistence” of laws disenfranchising minority citizens.\nId., at 311. To take just one example, the Court, in 1927,\nheld unconstitutional a Texas law barring black voters\nfrom participating in primary elections, Nixon v. Herndon,\n273 U. S. 536, 541; in 1944, the Court struck down a\n“reenacted” and slightly altered version of the same law,\nSmith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 658; and in 1953, the\nCourt once again confronted an attempt by Texas to “cir­\ncumven[t]” the Fifteenth Amendment by adopting yet\nanother variant of the all-white primary, Terry v. Adams,\n345 U. S. 461, 469.\n   During this era, the Court recognized that discrimina­\ntion against minority voters was a quintessentially politi­\ncal problem requiring a political solution. As Justice\nHolmes explained: If “the great mass of the white popula­\ntion intends to keep the blacks from voting,” “relief from\n[that] great political wrong, if done, as alleged, by the\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\npeople of a State and the State itself, must be given by\nthem or by the legislative and political department of\nthe government of the United States.” Giles v. Harris, 189\nU. S. 475, 488 (1903).\n   Congress learned from experience that laws targeting\nparticular electoral practices or enabling case-by-case\nlitigation were inadequate to the task. In the Civil Rights\nActs of 1957, 1960, and 1964, Congress authorized and\nthen expanded the power of “the Attorney General to seek\ninjunctions against public and private interference with\nthe right to vote on racial grounds.” Katzenbach, 383\nU. S., at 313. But circumstances reduced the ameliorative\npotential of these legislative Acts:\n    “Voting suits are unusually onerous to prepare, some­\n    times requiring as many as 6,000 man-hours spent\n    combing through registration records in preparation\n    for trial. Litigation has been exceedingly slow, in part\n    because of the ample opportunities for delay afforded\n    voting officials and others involved in the proceed­\n    ings. Even when favorable decisions have finally been\n    obtained, some of the States affected have merely\n    switched to discriminatory devices not covered by the\n    federal decrees or have enacted difficult new tests de­\n    signed to prolong the existing disparity between white\n    and Negro registration. Alternatively, certain local of­\n    ficials have defied and evaded court orders or have\n    simply closed their registration offices to freeze the\n    voting rolls.” Id., at 314 (footnote omitted).\nPatently, a new approach was needed.\n   Answering that need, the Voting Rights Act became one\nof the most consequential, efficacious, and amply justified\nexercises of federal legislative power in our Nation’s his­\ntory. Requiring federal preclearance of changes in voting\nlaws in the covered jurisdictions—those States and locali­\nties where opposition to the Constitution’s commands were\n\f4                SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nmost virulent—the VRA provided a fit solution for minor­\nity voters as well as for States. Under the preclearance\nregime established by §5 of the VRA, covered jurisdictions\nmust submit proposed changes in voting laws or proce­\ndures to the Department of Justice (DOJ), which has 60\ndays to respond to the changes. 79 Stat. 439, codified at\n42 U. S. C. §1973c(a). A change will be approved unless\nDOJ finds it has “the purpose [or] . . . the effect of denying\nor abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.”\nIbid. In the alternative, the covered jurisdiction may seek\napproval by a three-judge District Court in the District of\nColumbia.\n   After a century’s failure to fulfill the promise of the\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, passage of the\nVRA finally led to signal improvement on this front. “The\nJustice Department estimated that in the five years after\n[the VRA’s] passage, almost as many blacks registered [to\nvote] in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, North\nCarolina, and South Carolina as in the entire century\nbefore 1965.” Davidson, The Voting Rights Act: A Brief\nHistory, in Controversies in Minority Voting 7, 21 (B.\nGrofman & C. Davidson eds. 1992). And in assessing the\noverall effects of the VRA in 2006, Congress found that\n“[s]ignificant progress has been made in eliminating first\ngeneration barriers experienced by minority voters, in­\ncluding increased numbers of registered minority voters,\nminority voter turnout, and minority representation in\nCongress, State legislatures, and local elected offices. This\nprogress is the direct result of the Voting Rights Act of\n1965.” Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott\nKing Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments\nAct of 2006 (hereinafter 2006 Reauthorization), §2(b)(1),\n120 Stat. 577. On that matter of cause and effects there\ncan be no genuine doubt.\n   Although the VRA wrought dramatic changes in the\nrealization of minority voting rights, the Act, to date,\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U.

City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 181\n(1980). Congress also found that as “registration and\nvoting of minority citizens increas[ed], other measures\nmay be resorted to which would dilute increasing minority\nvoting strength.” Ibid. (quoting H.

Efforts to reduce the impact of minority votes,\nin contrast to direct attempts to block access to the bal­\nlot, are aptly described as “second-generation barriers” to\nminority voting.\n   Second-generation barriers come in various forms. One\nof the blockages is racial gerrymandering, the redrawing\nof legislative districts in an “effort to segregate the races\nfor purposes of voting.” Id., at 642. Another is adoption of\na system of at-large voting in lieu of district-by-district\nvoting in a city with a sizable black minority. By switch­\ning to at-large voting, the overall majority could control\nthe election of each city council member, effectively elimi­\nnating the potency of the minority’s votes.

As the\n1982 reauthorization approached its 2007 expiration date,\nCongress again considered whether the VRA’s preclear­\nance mechanism remained an appropriate response to the\nproblem of voting discrimination in covered jurisdictions.\n   Congress did not take this task lightly.

The House and Senate\nJudiciary Committees held 21 hearings, heard from scores\nof witnesses, received a number of investigative reports\nand other written documentation of continuing discrimina­\ntion in covered jurisdictions. In all, the legislative record\nCongress compiled filled more than 15,000 pages.\nH. R. Rep. 109–478, at 5, 11–12; S. Rep. 109–295, at 2–4,\n15.

Extensive “[e]vidence of continued discrim­\nination,” Congress concluded, “clearly show[ed] the con­\ntinued need for Federal oversight” in covered jurisdictions.\n§§2(b)(4)–(5), id., at 577–578. The overall record demon­\nstrated to the federal lawmakers that, “without the con­\ntinuation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 protections,\nracial and language minority citizens will be deprived of\nthe opportunity to exercise their right to vote, or will have\ntheir votes diluted, undermining the significant gains\nmade by minorities in the last 40 years.” §2(b)(9), id., at\n578.\n  Based on these findings, Congress reauthorized pre­\nclearance for another 25 years, while also undertaking to\nreconsider the extension after 15 years to ensure that the\nprovision was still necessary and effective. 42 U.

The question before\nthe Court is whether Congress had the authority under\nthe Constitution to act as it did.\n                             II\n   In answering this question, the Court does not write on\na clean slate. It is well established that Congress’ judg­\nment regarding exercise of its power to enforce the Four­\nteenth and Fifteenth Amendments warrants substantial\ndeference. The VRA addresses the combination of race\ndiscrimination and the right to vote, which is “preserva­\ntive of all rights.” Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 370\n(1886). When confronting the most constitutionally invid­\nious form of discrimination, and the most fundamental\nright in our democratic system, Congress’ power to act is\nat its height.\n\f                     Cite as: 570 U.

The Fifteenth Amend­\nment, which targets precisely and only racial discrimina­\ntion in voting rights, states that, in this domain, “Congress\nshall have power to enforce this article by appropriate\nlegislation.”2 In choosing this language, the Amendment’s\nframers invoked Chief Justice Marshall’s formulation of\nthe scope of Congress’ powers under the Necessary and\nProper Clause:\n     “Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of\n     the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,\n     which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not\n     prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the\n     constitution, are constitutional.” McCulloch v. Mary-\n     land, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819) (emphasis added).\n  It cannot tenably be maintained that the VRA, an Act of\nCongress adopted to shield the right to vote from racial\ndiscrimination, is inconsistent with the letter or spirit of\nthe Fifteenth Amendment, or any provision of the Consti­\ntution read in light of the Civil War Amendments. No­\nwhere in today’s opinion, or in Northwest Austin,3 is there\n——————\n   2 The Constitution uses the words “right to vote” in five separate\n\nplaces: the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-Fourth, and\nTwenty-Sixth Amendments. Each of these Amendments contains the\nsame broad empowerment of Congress to enact “appropriate legisla­\ntion” to enforce the protected right. The implication is unmistakable:\nUnder our constitutional structure, Congress holds the lead rein in\nmaking the right to vote equally real for all U. S. citizens. These\nAmendments are in line with the special role assigned to Congress in\nprotecting the integrity of the democratic process in federal elections.\nU. S. Const., Art. I, §4 (“[T]he Congress may at any time by Law make\nor alter” regulations concerning the “Times, Places and Manner of\nholding Elections for Senators and Representatives.”); Arizona v. Inter\nTribal Council of Ariz., Inc., ante, at 5–6.\n   3 Acknowledging the existence of “serious constitutional questions,”\n\nsee ante, at 22 (internal quotation marks omitted), does not suggest\nhow those questions should be answered.\n\f10              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nclear recognition of the transformative effect the Fifteenth\nAmendment aimed to achieve. Notably, “the Founders’\nfirst successful amendment told Congress that it could\n‘make no law’ over a certain domain”; in contrast, the Civil\nWar Amendments used “language [that] authorized trans­\nformative new federal statutes to uproot all vestiges of\nunfreedom and inequality” and provided “sweeping en­\nforcement powers . . . to enact ‘appropriate’ legislation\ntargeting state abuses.” A. Amar, America’s Constitution:\nA Biography 361, 363, 399 (2005). See also McConnell,\nInstitutions and Interpretation: A Critique of City of\nBoerne v. Flores, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 153, 182 (1997)\n(quoting Civil War-era framer that “the remedy for the\nviolation of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments\nwas expressly not left to the courts. The remedy was\nlegislative.”).\n   The stated purpose of the Civil War Amendments was to\narm Congress with the power and authority to protect all\npersons within the Nation from violations of their rights\nby the States. In exercising that power, then, Congress\nmay use “all means which are appropriate, which are\nplainly adapted” to the constitutional ends declared by\nthese Amendments. McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 421. So\nwhen Congress acts to enforce the right to vote free from\nracial discrimination, we ask not whether Congress has\nchosen the means most wise, but whether Congress has\nrationally selected means appropriate to a legitimate end.\n“It is not for us to review the congressional resolution of\n[the need for its chosen remedy]. It is enough that we be\nable to perceive a basis upon which the Congress might\nresolve the conflict as it did.” Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384\nU. S. 641, 653 (1966).\n   Until today, in considering the constitutionality of the\nVRA, the Court has accorded Congress the full measure of\nrespect its judgments in this domain should garner. South\nCarolina v. Katzenbach supplies the standard of review:\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n“As against the reserved powers of the States, Congress\nmay use any rational means to effectuate the constitu­\ntional prohibition of racial discrimination in voting.” 383\nU. S., at 324. Faced with subsequent reauthorizations of\nthe VRA, the Court has reaffirmed this standard. E.g.,\nCity of Rome, 446 U. S., at 178. Today’s Court does not\npurport to alter settled precedent establishing that the\ndispositive question is whether Congress has employed\n“rational means.”\n   For three reasons, legislation reauthorizing an existing\nstatute is especially likely to satisfy the minimal require­\nments of the rational-basis test. First, when reauthorization\nis at issue, Congress has already assembled a legislative\nrecord justifying the initial legislation. Congress is en­\ntitled to consider that preexisting record as well as the\nrecord before it at the time of the vote on reauthorization.\nThis is especially true where, as here, the Court has re­\npeatedly affirmed the statute’s constitutionality and Con­\ngress has adhered to the very model the Court has upheld.\nSee id., at 174 (“The appellants are asking us to do noth­\ning less than overrule our decision in South Carolina v.\nKatzenbach . . . , in which we upheld the constitutionality\nof the Act.”); Lopez v. Monterey County, 525 U. S. 266, 283\n(1999) (similar).\n   Second, the very fact that reauthorization is necessary\narises because Congress has built a temporal limitation\ninto the Act. It has pledged to review, after a span of\nyears (first 15, then 25) and in light of contemporary\nevidence, the continued need for the VRA. Cf. Grutter v.\nBollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 343 (2003) (anticipating, but not\nguaranteeing, that, in 25 years, “the use of racial prefer­\nences [in higher education] will no longer be necessary”).\n   Third, a reviewing court should expect the record sup­\nporting reauthorization to be less stark than the record\noriginally made. Demand for a record of violations equiva­\nlent to the one earlier made would expose Congress to a\n\f12               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ncatch-22. If the statute was working, there would be less\nevidence of discrimination, so opponents might argue that\nCongress should not be allowed to renew the statute. In\ncontrast, if the statute was not working, there would be\nplenty of evidence of discrimination, but scant reason to\nrenew a failed regulatory regime. See Persily 193–194.\n  This is not to suggest that congressional power in this\narea is limitless. It is this Court’s responsibility to ensure\nthat Congress has used appropriate means. The question\nmeet for judicial review is whether the chosen means are\n“adapted to carry out the objects the amendments have in\nview.” Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 346 (1880). The\nCourt’s role, then, is not to substitute its judgment for that\nof Congress, but to determine whether the legislative\nrecord sufficed to show that “Congress could rationally\nhave determined that [its chosen] provisions were appro­\npriate methods.” City of Rome, 446 U. S., at 176–177.\n  In summary, the Constitution vests broad power in\nCongress to protect the right to vote, and in particular to\ncombat racial discrimination in voting. This Court has\nrepeatedly reaffirmed Congress’ prerogative to use any\nrational means in exercise of its power in this area. And\nboth precedent and logic dictate that the rational-means\ntest should be easier to satisfy, and the burden on the\nstatute’s challenger should be higher, when what is at\nissue is the reauthorization of a remedy that the Court has\npreviously affirmed, and that Congress found, from con­\ntemporary evidence, to be working to advance the legisla­\nture’s legitimate objective.\n                               III\n  The 2006 reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act fully\nsatisfies the standard stated in McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at\n421: Congress may choose any means “appropriate” and\n“plainly adapted to” a legitimate constitutional end. As we\nshall see, it is implausible to suggest otherwise.\n\f                  Cite as: 570 U.

The surest\nway to evaluate whether that remedy remains in order is\nto see if preclearance is still effectively preventing discrim­\ninatory changes to voting laws. See City of Rome, 446\nU. S., at 181 (identifying “information on the number and\ntypes of submissions made by covered jurisdictions and\nthe number and nature of objections interposed by the\nAttorney General” as a primary basis for upholding the\n1975 reauthorization). On that score, the record before\nCongress was huge. In fact, Congress found there were\nmore DOJ objections between 1982 and 2004 (626) than\nthere were between 1965 and the 1982 reauthorization\n(490). 1 Voting Rights Act: Evidence of Continued Need,\nHearing before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of\nthe House Committee on the Judiciary, 109th Cong., 2d\nSess., p. 172 (2006) (hereinafter Evidence of Continued\nNeed).\n   All told, between 1982 and 2006, DOJ objections blocked\nover 700 voting changes based on a determination that the\nchanges were discriminatory. H. R. Rep. No. 109–478, at\n21. Congress found that the majority of DOJ objections\nincluded findings of discriminatory intent, see 679 F. 3d,\nat 867, and that the changes blocked by preclearance were\n“calculated decisions to keep minority voters from fully\nparticipating in the political process.” H. R. Rep. 109–478,\nat 21. On top of that, over the same time period the DOJ\nand private plaintiffs succeeded in more than 100 actions\nto enforce the §5 preclearance requirements. 1 Evidence\nof Continued Need 186, 250.\n   In addition to blocking proposed voting changes through\npreclearance, DOJ may request more information from a\njurisdiction proposing a change. In turn, the jurisdiction\nmay modify or withdraw the proposed change. The num­\nber of such modifications or withdrawals provides an\n\f14                 SHELBY COUNTY v.

Litigation occurs only after\nthe fact, when the illegal voting scheme has already been\nput in place and individuals have been elected pursuant to\nit, thereby gaining the advantages of incumbency. 1 Evi­\ndence of Continued Need 97.

HOLDER\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Congress further received evidence indicating that\nformal requests of the kind set out above represented only\nthe tip of the iceberg. There was what one commentator\ndescribed as an “avalanche of case studies of voting rights\nviolations in the covered jurisdictions,” ranging from\n“outright intimidation and violence against minority\nvoters” to “more subtle forms of voting rights depriva­\ntions.” Persily 202 (footnote omitted). This evidence gave\nCongress ever more reason to conclude that the time had\nnot yet come for relaxed vigilance against the scourge of\nrace discrimination in voting.\n   True, conditions in the South have impressively im­\nproved since passage of the Voting Rights Act. Congress\nnoted this improvement and found that the VRA was the\ndriving force behind it. 2006 Reauthorization §2(b)(1).\nBut Congress also found that voting discrimination had\nevolved into subtler second-generation barriers, and that\neliminating preclearance would risk loss of the gains that\nhad been made. §§2(b)(2), (9). Concerns of this order, the\nCourt previously found, gave Congress adequate cause to\nreauthorize the VRA. City of Rome, 446 U. S., at 180–182\n(congressional reauthorization of the preclearance re­\nquirement was justified based on “the number and nature\nof objections interposed by the Attorney General” since\nthe prior reauthorization; extension was “necessary to pre­\nserve the limited and fragile achievements of the Act and\nto promote further amelioration of voting discrimination”)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Facing such evidence\nthen, the Court expressly rejected the argument that\ndisparities in voter turnout and number of elected officials\n——————\nprecleared the law after adopting both interpretations as an express\n“condition of preclearance.” Id., at 37–38.

Ibid.\n                              B\n  I turn next to the evidence on which Congress based its\ndecision to reauthorize the coverage formula in §4(b).\nBecause Congress did not alter the coverage formula, the\nsame jurisdictions previously subject to preclearance\ncontinue to be covered by this remedy. The evidence just\ndescribed, of preclearance’s continuing efficacy in blocking\nconstitutional violations in the covered jurisdictions, itself\ngrounded Congress’ conclusion that the remedy should be\nretained for those jurisdictions.\n  There is no question, moreover, that the covered juris­\ndictions have a unique history of problems with racial\ndiscrimination in voting. Ante, at 12–13. Consideration of\nthis long history, still in living memory, was altogether\nappropriate. The Court criticizes Congress for failing to\nrecognize that “history did not end in 1965.” Ante, at 20.\nBut the Court ignores that “what’s past is prologue.” W.\nShakespeare, The Tempest, act 2, sc. 1. And “[t]hose who\ncannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” 1\nG. Santayana, The Life of Reason 284 (1905). Congress\nwas especially mindful of the need to reinforce the gains\nalready made and to prevent backsliding. 2006 Reauthor­\nization §2(b)(9).\n  Of particular importance, even after 40 years and thou­\nsands of discriminatory changes blocked by preclearance,\nconditions in the covered jurisdictions demonstrated that\nthe formula was still justified by “current needs.” North-\nwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 203.\n  Congress learned of these conditions through a report,\nknown as the Katz study, that looked at §2 suits between\n1982 and 2004. To Examine the Impact and Effectiveness\nof the Voting Rights Act: Hearing before the Subcommit­\ntee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the\n\f20                  SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nJudiciary, 109th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 964–1124 (2005)\n(hereinafter Impact and Effectiveness). Because the pri­\nvate right of action authorized by §2 of the VRA applies\nnationwide, a comparison of §2 lawsuits in covered and\nnoncovered jurisdictions provides an appropriate yardstick\nfor measuring differences between covered and noncovered\njurisdictions. If differences in the risk of voting discrimi­\nnation between covered and noncovered jurisdictions had\ndisappeared, one would expect that the rate of successful\n§2 lawsuits would be roughly the same in both areas.6 The\nstudy’s findings, however, indicated that racial discrimi­\nnation in voting remains “concentrated in the jurisdictions\nsingled out for preclearance.” Northwest Austin, 557 U. S.,\nat 203.\n  Although covered jurisdictions account for less than 25\npercent of the country’s population, the Katz study re­\nvealed that they accounted for 56 percent of successful\n§2 litigation since 1982. Impact and Effectiveness 974.\nControlling for population, there were nearly four times as\nmany successful §2 cases in covered jurisdictions as there\nwere in noncovered jurisdictions. 679 F. 3d, at 874. The\nKatz study further found that §2 lawsuits are more likely\nto succeed when they are filed in covered jurisdictions\nthan in noncovered jurisdictions. Impact and Effective­\nness 974. From these findings—ignored by the Court—\nCongress reasonably concluded that the coverage formula\ncontinues to identify the jurisdictions of greatest concern.\n  The evidence before Congress, furthermore, indicated\nthat voting in the covered jurisdictions was more racially\npolarized than elsewhere in the country. H. R. Rep. No.\n109–478, at 34–35. While racially polarized voting alone\n——————\n  6 Because preclearance occurs only in covered jurisdictions and can be\n\nexpected to stop the most obviously objectionable measures, one would\nexpect a lower rate of successful §2 lawsuits in those jurisdictions if\nthe risk of voting discrimination there were the same as elsewhere in the\ncountry.\n\f                  Cite as: 570 U.

The reason is twofold.\nFirst, racial polarization means that racial minorities are\nat risk of being systematically outvoted and having their\ninterests underrepresented in legislatures. Second, “when\npolitical preferences fall along racial lines, the natural\ninclinations of incumbents and ruling parties to entrench\nthemselves have predictable racial effects. Under circum­\nstances of severe racial polarization, efforts to gain politi­\ncal advantage translate into race-specific disadvantages.”\nAnsolabehere, Persily, & Stewart, Regional Differences\nin Racial Polarization in the 2012 Presidential Election:\nImplications for the Constitutionality of Section 5 of the\nVoting Rights Act, 126 Harv. L. Rev. Forum 205, 209\n(2013).\n  In other words, a governing political coalition has an\nincentive to prevent changes in the existing balance of\nvoting power. When voting is racially polarized, efforts by\nthe ruling party to pursue that incentive “will inevitably\ndiscriminate against a racial group.” Ibid. Just as build­\nings in California have a greater need to be earthquake­\nproofed, places where there is greater racial polarization\nin voting have a greater need for prophylactic measures to\nprevent purposeful race discrimination. This point was\nunderstood by Congress and is well recognized in the\nacademic literature. See 2006 Reauthorization §2(b)(3),\n120 Stat. 577 (“The continued evidence of racially polar­\nized voting in each of the jurisdictions covered by the\n[preclearance requirement] demonstrates that racial and\nlanguage minorities remain politically vulnerable”); H. R.\nRep. No. 109–478, at 35; Davidson, The Recent Evolution\nof Voting Rights Law Affecting Racial and Language\nMinorities, in Quiet Revolution 21, 22.\n  The case for retaining a coverage formula that met\nneeds on the ground was therefore solid. Congress might\n\f22              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nhave been charged with rigidity had it afforded covered\njurisdictions no way out or ignored jurisdictions that\nneeded superintendence. Congress, however, responded to\nthis concern. Critical components of the congressional\ndesign are the statutory provisions allowing jurisdictions\nto “bail out” of preclearance, and for court-ordered “bail\nins.” See Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 199. The VRA\npermits a jurisdiction to bail out by showing that it has\ncomplied with the Act for ten years, and has engaged in\nefforts to eliminate intimidation and harassment of vot­\ners. 42 U. S. C. §1973b(a) (2006 ed. and Supp. V). It also\nauthorizes a court to subject a noncovered jurisdiction to\nfederal preclearance upon finding that violations of the\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments have occurred\nthere. §1973a(c) (2006 ed.).\n   Congress was satisfied that the VRA’s bailout mecha­\nnism provided an effective means of adjusting the VRA’s\ncoverage over time. H. R. Rep. No. 109–478, at 25 (the\nsuccess of bailout “illustrates that: (1) covered status is\nneither permanent nor over-broad; and (2) covered status\nhas been and continues to be within the control of the\njurisdiction such that those jurisdictions that have a genu­\ninely clean record and want to terminate coverage have\nthe ability to do so”). Nearly 200 jurisdictions have suc­\ncessfully bailed out of the preclearance requirement, and\nDOJ has consented to every bailout application filed by an\neligible jurisdiction since the current bailout procedure\nbecame effective in 1984. Brief for Federal Respondent 54.\nThe bail-in mechanism has also worked. Several jurisdic­\ntions have been subject to federal preclearance by court\norders, including the States of New Mexico and Arkansas.\nApp. to Brief for Federal Respondent 1a–3a.\n   This experience exposes the inaccuracy of the Court’s\nportrayal of the Act as static, unchanged since 1965.\nCongress designed the VRA to be a dynamic statute, capa­\nble of adjusting to changing conditions.

The same cannot be\nsaid of the Court’s opinion today. The Court makes no\ngenuine attempt to engage with the massive legislative\nrecord that Congress assembled. Instead, it relies on\nincreases in voter registration and turnout as if that were\nthe whole story. See supra, at 18–19. Without even\nidentifying a standard of review, the Court dismissively\nbrushes off arguments based on “data from the record,” and\ndeclines to enter the “debat[e about] what [the] record\nshows.” Ante, at 20–21. One would expect more from an\nopinion striking at the heart of the Nation’s signal piece of\ncivil-rights legislation.\n  I note the most disturbing lapses. First, by what right,\ngiven its usual restraint, does the Court even address\nShelby County’s facial challenge to the VRA? Second, the\nCourt veers away from controlling precedent regarding the\n“equal sovereignty” doctrine without even acknowledging\nthat it is doing so. Third, hardly showing the respect\nordinarily paid when Congress acts to implement the Civil\nWar Amendments, and as just stressed, the Court does not\neven deign to grapple with the legislative record.\n                             A\n  Shelby County launched a purely facial challenge to the\nVRA’s 2006 reauthorization. “A facial challenge to a\nlegislative Act,” the Court has other times said, “is, of\ncourse, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,\nsince the challenger must establish that no set of circum­\n\f24              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nstances exists under which the Act would be valid.” United\nStates v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987).\n   “[U]nder our constitutional system[,] courts are not\nroving commissions assigned to pass judgment on the\nvalidity of the Nation’s laws.” Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413\nU. S. 601, 610–611 (1973). Instead, the “judicial Power” is\nlimited to deciding particular “Cases” and “Controversies.”\nU. S. Const., Art. III, §2. “Embedded in the traditional\nrules governing constitutional adjudication is the principle\nthat a person to whom a statute may constitutionally be\napplied will not be heard to challenge that statute on the\nground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitution­\nally to others, in other situations not before the Court.”\nBroadrick, 413 U. S., at 610. Yet the Court’s opinion in\nthis case contains not a word explaining why Congress\nlacks the power to subject to preclearance the particular\nplaintiff that initiated this lawsuit—Shelby County, Ala­\nbama. The reason for the Court’s silence is apparent, for\nas applied to Shelby County, the VRA’s preclearance\nrequirement is hardly contestable.\n   Alabama is home to Selma, site of the “Bloody Sunday”\nbeatings of civil-rights demonstrators that served as the\ncatalyst for the VRA’s enactment. Following those events,\nMartin Luther King, Jr., led a march from Selma to Mont­\ngomery, Alabama’s capital, where he called for passage of\nthe VRA. If the Act passed, he foresaw, progress could be\nmade even in Alabama, but there had to be a steadfast\nnational commitment to see the task through to comple­\ntion. In King’s words, “the arc of the moral universe is\nlong, but it bends toward justice.” G. May, Bending To­\nward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transfor­\nmation of American Democracy 144 (2013).\n   History has proved King right. Although circumstances\nin Alabama have changed, serious concerns remain.\nBetween 1982 and 2005, Alabama had one of the highest\nrates of successful §2 suits, second only to its VRA-covered\n\f                      Cite as: 570 U.

In other words, even while subject to the\nrestraining effect of §5, Alabama was found to have\n“deni[ed] or abridge[d]” voting rights “on account of race or\ncolor” more frequently than nearly all other States in the\nUnion. 42 U. S. C. §1973(a). This fact prompted the\ndissenting judge below to concede that “a more narrowly\ntailored coverage formula” capturing Alabama and a\nhandful of other jurisdictions with an established track\nrecord of racial discrimination in voting “might be defensi­\nble.” 679 F. 3d, at 897 (opinion of Williams, J.). That is an\nunderstatement. Alabama’s sorry history of §2 violations\nalone provides sufficient justification for Congress’ deter­\nmination in 2006 that the State should remain subject to\n§5’s preclearance requirement.7\n  A few examples suffice to demonstrate that, at least in\nAlabama, the “current burdens” imposed by §5’s preclear­\nance requirement are “justified by current needs.” North-\nwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 203. In the interim between the\nVRA’s 1982 and 2006 reauthorizations, this Court twice\nconfronted purposeful racial discrimination in Alabama.\nIn Pleasant Grove v. United States, 479 U. S. 462 (1987),\nthe Court held that Pleasant Grove—a city in Jefferson\nCounty, Shelby County’s neighbor—engaged in purposeful\ndiscrimination by annexing all-white areas while rejecting\nthe annexation request of an adjacent black neighborhood.\nThe city had “shown unambiguous opposition to racial\n——————\n  7 This lawsuit was filed by Shelby County, a political subdivision of\n\nAlabama, rather than by the State itself. Nevertheless, it is appropri­\nate to judge Shelby County’s constitutional challenge in light of in­\nstances of discrimination statewide because Shelby County is subject to\n§5’s preclearance requirement by virtue of Alabama’s designation as a\ncovered jurisdiction under §4(b) of the VRA. See ante, at 7. In any\nevent, Shelby County’s recent record of employing an at-large electoral\nsystem tainted by intentional racial discrimination is by itself sufficient\nto justify subjecting the county to §5’s preclearance mandate. See infra,\nat 26.\n\f26              SHELBY COUNTY v.

S. 222 (1985), struck down a provision\nof the Alabama Constitution that prohibited individuals\nconvicted of misdemeanor offenses “involving moral turpi­\ntude” from voting. Id., at 223 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The provision violated the Fourteenth Amend­\nment’s Equal Protection Clause, the Court unanimously\nconcluded, because “its original enactment was motivated\nby a desire to discriminate against blacks on account of\nrace[,] and the [provision] continues to this day to have\nthat effect.” Id., at 233.\n  Pleasant Grove and Hunter were not anomalies. In\n1986, a Federal District Judge concluded that the at-large\nelection systems in several Alabama counties violated §2.\nDillard v. Crenshaw Cty., 640 F. Supp. 1347, 1354–1363\n(MD Ala. 1986). Summarizing its findings, the court\nstated that “[f ]rom the late 1800’s through the present,\n[Alabama] has consistently erected barriers to keep black\npersons from full and equal participation in the social,\neconomic, and political life of the state.” Id., at 1360.\n  The Dillard litigation ultimately expanded to include\n183 cities, counties, and school boards employing discrim­\ninatory at-large election systems. Dillard v. Baldwin Cty.\nBd. of Ed., 686 F. Supp. 1459, 1461 (MD Ala. 1988). One\nof those defendants was Shelby County, which eventually\nsigned a consent decree to resolve the claims against it.\nSee Dillard v. Crenshaw Cty., 748 F.

In 2008, for\nexample, the city of Calera, located in Shelby County,\nrequested preclearance of a redistricting plan that “would\nhave eliminated the city’s sole majority-black district,\nwhich had been created pursuant to the consent decree in\nDillard.” 811 F. Supp. 2d 424, 443 (DC 2011). Although\nDOJ objected to the plan, Calera forged ahead with elec­\ntions based on the unprecleared voting changes, resulting\nin the defeat of the incumbent African-American council­\nman who represented the former majority-black district.\nIbid. The city’s defiance required DOJ to bring a §5 en­\nforcement action that ultimately yielded appropriate\nredress, including restoration of the majority-black dis­\ntrict. Ibid.; Brief for Respondent-Intervenors Earl Cun­\nningham et al. 20.\n    A recent FBI investigation provides a further window\ninto the persistence of racial discrimination in state poli­\ntics. See United States v. McGregor, 824 F. Supp. 2d 1339,\n1344–1348 (MD Ala. 2011). Recording devices worn by\nstate legislators cooperating with the FBI’s investigation\ncaptured conversations between members of the state\nlegislature and their political allies. The recorded conver­\nsations are shocking. Members of the state Senate deri­\nsively refer to African-Americans as “Aborigines” and talk\nopenly of their aim to quash a particular gambling-related\nreferendum because the referendum, if placed on the\nballot, might increase African-American voter turnout.\nId., at 1345–1346 (internal quotation marks omitted). See\nalso id., at 1345 (legislators and their allies expressed\nconcern that if the referendum were placed on the ballot,\n“ ‘[e]very black, every illiterate’ would be ‘bused [to the\npolls] on HUD financed buses’ ”). These conversations oc­\ncurred not in the 1870’s, or even in the 1960’s, they took\nplace in 2010. Id., at 1344–1345. The District Judge\npresiding over the criminal trial at which the recorded\nconversations were introduced commented that the “re­\n\f28                 SHELBY COUNTY v.

Id., at 1347. Racist sentiments, the\njudge observed, “remain regrettably entrenched in the\nhigh echelons of state government.” Ibid.\n  These recent episodes forcefully demonstrate that §5’s\npreclearance requirement is constitutional as applied to\nAlabama and its political subdivisions.8 And under our\ncase law, that conclusion should suffice to resolve this\ncase. See United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 24–25\n(1960) (“[I]f the complaint here called for an application of\nthe statute clearly constitutional under the Fifteenth\nAmendment, that should have been an end to the question\nof constitutionality.”). See also Nevada Dept. of Human\nResources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721, 743 (2003) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting) (where, as here, a state or local government\nraises a facial challenge to a federal statute on the ground\nthat it exceeds Congress’ enforcement powers under the\nCivil War Amendments, the challenge fails if the opposing\nparty is able to show that the statute “could constitution­\nally be applied to some jurisdictions”).\n  This Court has consistently rejected constitutional\nchallenges to legislation enacted pursuant to Congress’\nenforcement powers under the Civil War Amendments\nupon finding that the legislation was constitutional as\napplied to the particular set of circumstances before the\nCourt.

A similar approach is warranted here.9\n  The VRA’s exceptionally broad severability provision\nmakes it particularly inappropriate for the Court to allow\nShelby County to mount a facial challenge to §§4(b) and 5\nof the VRA, even though application of those provisions to\nthe county falls well within the bounds of Congress’ legis­\nlative authority. The severability provision states:\n     “If any provision of [this Act] or the application\n     thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid,\n     the remainder of [the Act] and the application of the\n     provision to other persons not similarly situated or\n     to other circumstances shall not be affected thereby.”\n     42 U. S. C. §1973p.\nIn other words, even if the VRA could not constitutionally\nbe applied to certain States—e.g., Arizona and Alaska, see\nante, at 8—§1973p calls for those unconstitutional applica­\ntions to be severed, leaving the Act in place for juris­\ndictions as to which its application does not transgress\nconstitutional limits.\n——————\n   9 The Court does not contest that Alabama’s history of racial discrim­\n\nination provides a sufficient basis for Congress to require Alabama and\nits political subdivisions to preclear electoral changes. Nevertheless,\nthe Court asserts that Shelby County may prevail on its facial chal­\nlenge to §4’s coverage formula because it is subject to §5’s preclearance\nrequirement by virtue of that formula. See ante, at 22 (“The county\nwas selected [for preclearance] based on th[e] [coverage] formula.”).\nThis misses the reality that Congress decided to subject Alabama to\npreclearance based on evidence of continuing constitutional violations\nin that State.

Just last Term, however, the Court rejected this\nvery argument when addressing a materially identical\nseverability provision, explaining that such a provision is\n“Congress’ explicit textual instruction to leave unaffected\nthe remainder of [the Act]” if any particular “application is\nunconstitutional.” National Federation of Independent\nBusiness v. Sebelius, 567 U. S. __, __ (2012) (plurality\nopinion) (slip op., at 56) (internal quotation marks omit­\nted); id., at __ (GINSBURG, J., concurring in part, concur­\nring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (slip op.,\nat 60) (agreeing with the plurality’s severability analysis).\nSee also Raines, 362 U. S., at 23 (a statute capable of some\nconstitutional applications may nonetheless be susceptible\nto a facial challenge only in “that rarest of cases where\nthis Court can justifiably think itself able confidently to\ndiscern that Congress would not have desired its legisla­\ntion to stand at all unless it could validly stand in its every\napplication”). Leaping to resolve Shelby County’s facial\nchallenge without considering whether application of the\nVRA to Shelby County is constitutional, or even address­\ning the VRA’s severability provision, the Court’s opinion\ncan hardly be described as an exemplar of restrained and\nmoderate decisionmaking. Quite the opposite. Hubris is a\nfit word for today’s demolition of the VRA.\n                              B\n  The Court stops any application of §5 by holding that\n§4(b)’s coverage formula is unconstitutional. It pins this\nresult, in large measure, to “the fundamental principle of\nequal sovereignty.” Ante, at 10–11, 23. In Katzenbach,\nhowever, the Court held, in no uncertain terms, that the\nprinciple “applies only to the terms upon which States are\nadmitted to the Union, and not to the remedies for local\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U.

S., at\n328–329 (emphasis added).\n   Katzenbach, the Court acknowledges, “rejected the\nnotion that the [equal sovereignty] principle operate[s] as\na bar on differential treatment outside [the] context [of the\nadmission of new States].” Ante, at 11 (citing 383 U. S., at\n328–329) (emphasis omitted). But the Court clouds that\nonce clear understanding by citing dictum from Northwest\nAustin to convey that the principle of equal sovereignty\n“remains highly pertinent in assessing subsequent dispar­\nate treatment of States.” Ante, at 11 (citing 557 U. S., at\n203). See also ante, at 23 (relying on Northwest Austin’s\n“emphasis on [the] significance” of the equal-sovereignty\nprinciple). If the Court is suggesting that dictum in\nNorthwest Austin silently overruled Katzenbach’s limita­\ntion of the equal sovereignty doctrine to “the admission of\nnew States,” the suggestion is untenable. Northwest\nAustin cited Katzenbach’s holding in the course of declin-\ning to decide whether the VRA was constitutional or even\nwhat standard of review applied to the question. 557\nU. S., at 203–204. In today’s decision, the Court ratchets\nup what was pure dictum in Northwest Austin, attributing\nbreadth to the equal sovereignty principle in flat contra­\ndiction of Katzenbach. The Court does so with nary an\nexplanation of why it finds Katzenbach wrong, let alone\nany discussion of whether stare decisis nonetheless coun­\nsels adherence to Katzenbach’s ruling on the limited “sig­\nnificance” of the equal sovereignty principle.\n   Today’s unprecedented extension of the equal sover­\neignty principle outside its proper domain—the admission\nof new States—is capable of much mischief. Federal statutes\nthat treat States disparately are hardly novelties. See,\ne.g., 28 U. S. C. §3704 (no State may operate or permit a\nsports-related gambling scheme, unless that State con­\nducted such a scheme “at any time during the period\nbeginning January 1, 1976, and ending August 31, 1990”);\n\f32              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n26 U. S. C. §142(l) (EPA required to locate green building\nproject in a State meeting specified population criteria); 42\nU. S. C. §3796bb (at least 50 percent of rural drug en­\nforcement assistance funding must be allocated to States\nwith “a population density of fifty-two or fewer persons per\nsquare mile or a State in which the largest county has\nfewer than one hundred and fifty thousand people, based\non the decennial census of 1990 through fiscal year 1997”);\n§§13925, 13971 (similar population criteria for funding to\ncombat rural domestic violence); §10136 (specifying rules\napplicable to Nevada’s Yucca Mountain nuclear waste site,\nand providing that “[n]o State, other than the State of\nNevada, may receive financial assistance under this sub­\nsection after December 22, 1987”). Do such provisions\nremain safe given the Court’s expansion of equal sover­\neignty’s sway?\n   Of gravest concern, Congress relied on our pathmarking\nKatzenbach decision in each reauthorization of the VRA.\nIt had every reason to believe that the Act’s limited geo­\ngraphical scope would weigh in favor of, not against, the\nAct’s constitutionality. See, e.g., United States v. Morri-\nson, 529 U. S. 598, 626–627 (2000) (confining preclearance\nregime to States with a record of discrimination bolstered\nthe VRA’s constitutionality). Congress could hardly have\nforeseen that the VRA’s limited geographic reach would\nrender the Act constitutionally suspect. See Persily 195\n(“[S]upporters of the Act sought to develop an evidentiary\nrecord for the principal purpose of explaining why the\ncovered jurisdictions should remain covered, rather than\njustifying the coverage of certain jurisdictions but not\nothers.”).\n   In the Court’s conception, it appears, defenders of the\nVRA could not prevail upon showing what the record\noverwhelmingly bears out, i.e., that there is a need for\ncontinuing the preclearance regime in covered States. In\naddition, the defenders would have to disprove the exist­\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U.

See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n61–62 (suggesting that proof of egregious episodes of racial\ndiscrimination in covered jurisdictions would not suffice to\ncarry the day for the VRA, unless such episodes are shown\nto be absent elsewhere). I am aware of no precedent for\nimposing such a double burden on defenders of legislation.\n                              C\n   The Court has time and again declined to upset legisla­\ntion of this genre unless there was no or almost no evi­\ndence of unconstitutional action by States. See, e.g., City\nof Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 530 (1997) (legislative\nrecord “mention[ed] no episodes [of the kind the legislation\naimed to check] occurring in the past 40 years”). No such\nclaim can be made about the congressional record for the\n2006 VRA reauthorization. Given a record replete with\nexamples of denial or abridgment of a paramount federal\nright, the Court should have left the matter where it\nbelongs: in Congress’ bailiwick.\n   Instead, the Court strikes §4(b)’s coverage provision\nbecause, in its view, the provision is not based on “current\nconditions.” Ante, at 17. It discounts, however, that one\nsuch condition was the preclearance remedy in place in\nthe covered jurisdictions, a remedy Congress designed\nboth to catch discrimination before it causes harm, and to\nguard against return to old ways. 2006 Reauthorization\n§2(b)(3), (9). Volumes of evidence supported Congress’ de­\ntermination that the prospect of retrogression was real.\nThrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is\ncontinuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like\nthrowing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you\nare not getting wet.\n   But, the Court insists, the coverage formula is no good;\nit is based on “decades-old data and eradicated practices.”\nAnte, at 18. Even if the legislative record shows, as engag­\ning with it would reveal, that the formula accurately\n\f34               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nidentifies the jurisdictions with the worst conditions of\nvoting discrimination, that is of no moment, as the Court\nsees it. Congress, the Court decrees, must “star[t] from\nscratch.” Ante, at 23. I do not see why that should be so.\n   Congress’ chore was different in 1965 than it was in\n2006. In 1965, there were a “small number of States . . .\nwhich in most instances were familiar to Congress by\nname,” on which Congress fixed its attention. Katzenbach,\n383 U. S., at 328. In drafting the coverage formula, “Con­\ngress began work with reliable evidence of actual voting\ndiscrimination in a great majority of the States” it sought\nto target. Id., at 329. “The formula [Congress] eventually\nevolved to describe these areas” also captured a few States\nthat had not been the subject of congressional factfinding.\nIbid. Nevertheless, the Court upheld the formula in its\nentirety, finding it fair “to infer a significant danger of the\nevil” in all places the formula covered. Ibid.\n   The situation Congress faced in 2006, when it took up\nreauthorization of the coverage formula, was not the same.\nBy then, the formula had been in effect for many years,\nand all of the jurisdictions covered by it were “familiar\nto Congress by name.” Id., at 328. The question before\nCongress: Was there still a sufficient basis to support\ncontinued application of the preclearance remedy in each\nof those already-identified places? There was at that point\nno chance that the formula might inadvertently sweep in\nnew areas that were not the subject of congressional\nfindings. And Congress could determine from the record\nwhether the jurisdictions captured by the coverage for­\nmula still belonged under the preclearance regime. If they\ndid, there was no need to alter the formula. That is why\nthe Court, in addressing prior reauthorizations of the\nVRA, did not question the continuing “relevance” of the\nformula.\n   Consider once again the components of the record before\nCongress in 2006. The coverage provision identified a\n\f                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            35\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nknown list of places with an undisputed history of serious\nproblems with racial discrimination in voting. Recent\nevidence relating to Alabama and its counties was there\nfor all to see. Multiple Supreme Court decisions had\nupheld the coverage provision, most recently in 1999.\nThere was extensive evidence that, due to the preclear­\nance mechanism, conditions in the covered jurisdictions\nhad notably improved. And there was evidence that pre­\nclearance was still having a substantial real-world effect,\nhaving stopped hundreds of discriminatory voting changes\nin the covered jurisdictions since the last reauthorization.\nIn addition, there was evidence that racial polarization in\nvoting was higher in covered jurisdictions than elsewhere,\nincreasing the vulnerability of minority citizens in those\njurisdictions. And countless witnesses, reports, and case\nstudies documented continuing problems with voting dis­\ncrimination in those jurisdictions. In light of this rec­\nord, Congress had more than a reasonable basis to\nconclude that the existing coverage formula was not out of\nsync with conditions on the ground in covered areas. And\ncertainly Shelby County was no candidate for release\nthrough the mechanism Congress provided. See supra, at\n22–23, 26–28.\n   The Court holds §4(b) invalid on the ground that it is\n“irrational to base coverage on the use of voting tests 40\nyears ago, when such tests have been illegal since that\ntime.” Ante, at 23. But the Court disregards what Con­\ngress set about to do in enacting the VRA. That extraor­\ndinary legislation scarcely stopped at the particular tests\nand devices that happened to exist in 1965. The grand\naim of the Act is to secure to all in our polity equal citizen­\nship stature, a voice in our democracy undiluted by race.\nAs the record for the 2006 reauthorization makes abun­\ndantly clear, second-generation barriers to minority voting\nrights have emerged in the covered jurisdictions as at­\ntempted substitutes for the first-generation barriers that\n\f36               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\noriginally triggered preclearance in those jurisdictions.\nSee supra, at 5–6, 8, 15–17.\n   The sad irony of today’s decision lies in its utter failure\nto grasp why the VRA has proven effective. The Court\nappears to believe that the VRA’s success in eliminating\nthe specific devices extant in 1965 means that preclear­\nance is no longer needed. Ante, at 21–22, 23–24. With\nthat belief, and the argument derived from it, history\nrepeats itself. The same assumption—that the problem\ncould be solved when particular methods of voting discrim­\nination are identified and eliminated—was indulged and\nproved wrong repeatedly prior to the VRA’s enactment.\nUnlike prior statutes, which singled out particular tests or\ndevices, the VRA is grounded in Congress’ recognition of\nthe “variety and persistence” of measures designed to\nimpair minority voting rights. Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at\n311; supra, at 2. In truth, the evolution of voting discrim­\nination into more subtle second-generation barriers is\npowerful evidence that a remedy as effective as preclear­\nance remains vital to protect minority voting rights and\nprevent backsliding.\n   Beyond question, the VRA is no ordinary legislation. It\nis extraordinary because Congress embarked on a mission\nlong delayed and of extraordinary importance: to realize\nthe purpose and promise of the Fifteenth Amendment.\nFor a half century, a concerted effort has been made to\nend racial discrimination in voting. Thanks to the Voting\nRights Act, progress once the subject of a dream has been\nachieved and continues to be made.\n   The record supporting the 2006 reauthorization of\nthe VRA is also extraordinary. It was described by the\nChairman of the House Judiciary Committee as “one of\nthe most extensive considerations of any piece of legisla­\ntion that the United States Congress has dealt with in the\n27½ years” he had served in the House. 152 Cong. Rec.\nH5143 (July 13, 2006) (statement of Rep. Sensenbrenner).\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U.

That determination of the body empowered to\nenforce the Civil War Amendments “by appropriate legis­\nlation” merits this Court’s utmost respect. In my judg­\nment, the Court errs egregiously by overriding Congress’\ndecision.\n                      *     *    *\n  For the reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals.\n\f",

Other sections apply only to some parts of\n  the country. Section 4 of the Act provides the “coverage formula,” de-\n  fining the “covered jurisdictions” as States or political subdivisions\n  that maintained tests or devices as prerequisites to voting, and had\n  low voter registration or turnout, in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n  §1973b(b). In those covered jurisdictions, §5 of the Act provides that\n  no change in voting procedures can take effect until approved by\n  specified federal authorities in Washington, D. C. §1973c(a). Such\n  approval is known as “preclearance.”\n     The coverage formula and preclearance requirement were initially\n  set to expire after five years, but the Act has been reauthorized sev-\n  eral times. In 2006, the Act was reauthorized for an additional 25\n  years, but the coverage formula was not changed.

After surveying the evidence in the record, that court\n    accepted Congress’s conclusion that §2 litigation remained inade-\n    quate in the covered jurisdictions to protect the rights of minority\n    voters, that §5 was therefore still necessary, and that the coverage\n    formula continued to pass constitutional muster.\nHeld: Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional; its formula\n can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to pre-\n clearance.

S., at 203. These basic principles guide review of the question\n presented here. Pp. 9–17.\n      (1) State legislation may not contravene federal law. States re-\n tain broad autonomy, however, in structuring their governments and\n pursuing legislative objectives. Indeed, the Tenth Amendment re-\n serves to the States all powers not specifically granted to the Federal\n Government, including “the power to regulate elections.” Gregory v.\n Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112632\"><a href=\"/opinion/112632/gregory-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 461–462. There is also a “fundamental prin-\n ciple of equal sovereignty” among the States, which is highly perti-\n nent in assessing disparate treatment of States. Northwest Austin,\n supra, at 203.\n    The Voting Rights Act sharply departs from these basic principles.\n It requires States to beseech the Federal Government for permission\n to implement laws that they would otherwise have the right to enact\n and execute on their own. And despite the tradition of equal sover-\n eignty, the Act applies to only nine States (and additional counties).\n That is why, in 1966, this Court described the Act as “stringent” and\n “potent,” Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 308, 315, 337. The Court nonethe-\n less upheld the Act, concluding that such an “uncommon exercise of\n congressional power” could be justified by “exceptional conditions.”\n Id., at 334. Pp. 9–12.\n      (2) In 1966, these departures were justified by the “blight of ra-\n\f                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncial discrimination in voting” that had “infected the electoral process\nin parts of our country for nearly a century,” Katzenbach, 383 U. S.,\nat 308. At the time, the coverage formula—the means of linking the\nexercise of the unprecedented authority with the problem that war-\nranted it—made sense. The Act was limited to areas where Congress\nfound “evidence of actual voting discrimination,” and the covered ju-\nrisdictions shared two characteristics: “the use of tests and devices\nfor voter registration, and a voting rate in the 1964 presidential elec-\ntion at least 12 points below the national average.” Id., at 330. The\nCourt explained that “[t]ests and devices are relevant to voting dis-\ncrimination because of their long history as a tool for perpetrating\nthe evil; a low voting rate is pertinent for the obvious reason that\nwidespread disenfranchisement must inevitably affect the number of\nactual voters.” Ibid. The Court therefore concluded that “the cover-\nage formula [was] rational in both practice and theory.” Ibid.\nPp. 12–13.\n     (3) Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically.\nLargely because of the Voting Rights Act, “[v]oter turnout and regis-\ntration rates” in covered jurisdictions “now approach parity. Blatant-\nly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. And minority\ncandidates hold office at unprecedented levels.” Northwest Austin,\nsupra, at 202. The tests and devices that blocked ballot access have\nbeen forbidden nationwide for over 40 years. Yet the Act has not\neased §5’s restrictions or narrowed the scope of §4’s coverage formula\nalong the way. Instead those extraordinary and unprecedented fea-\ntures have been reauthorized as if nothing has changed, and they\nhave grown even stronger. Because §5 applies only to those jurisdic-\ntions singled out by §4, the Court turns to consider that provision.\nPp. 13–17.\n   (b) Section 4’s formula is unconstitutional in light of current condi-\ntions. Pp. 17–25.\n     (1) In 1966, the coverage formula was “rational in both practice\nand theory.” Katzenbach, supra, at 330. It looked to cause (discrimi-\nnatory tests) and effect (low voter registration and turnout), and tai-\nlored the remedy (preclearance) to those jurisdictions exhibiting both.\nBy 2009, however, the “coverage formula raise[d] serious constitu-\ntional questions.” Northwest Austin, supra, at 204. Coverage today\nis based on decades-old data and eradicated practices. The formula\ncaptures States by reference to literacy tests and low voter registra-\ntion and turnout in the 1960s and early 1970s. But such tests have\nbeen banned for over 40 years. And voter registration and turnout\nnumbers in covered States have risen dramatically. In 1965, the\nStates could be divided into those with a recent history of voting tests\nand low voter registration and turnout and those without those char-\n\f4                     SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    acteristics. Congress based its coverage formula on that distinction.\n    Today the Nation is no longer divided along those lines, yet the Vot-\n    ing Rights Act continues to treat it as if it were. Pp. 17–18.\n         (2) The Government attempts to defend the formula on grounds\n    that it is “reverse-engineered”—Congress identified the jurisdictions\n    to be covered and then came up with criteria to describe them. Kat-\n    zenbach did not sanction such an approach, reasoning instead that\n    the coverage formula was rational because the “formula . . . was rele-\n    vant to the problem.” 383 U. S., at 329, 330. The Government has a\n    fallback argument—because the formula was relevant in 1965, its\n    continued use is permissible so long as any discrimination remains in\n    the States identified in 1965. But this does not look to “current polit-\n    ical conditions,” Northwest Austin, supra, at 203, instead relying on a\n    comparison between the States in 1965. But history did not end in\n    1965. In assessing the “current need[ ]” for a preclearance system\n    treating States differently from one another today, history since 1965\n    cannot be ignored. The Fifteenth Amendment is not designed to pun-\n    ish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future. To serve\n    that purpose, Congress—if it is to divide the States—must identify\n    those jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes sense in\n    light of current conditions. Pp. 18–21.\n         (3) Respondents also rely heavily on data from the record com-\n    piled by Congress before reauthorizing the Act. Regardless of how\n    one looks at that record, no one can fairly say that it shows anything\n    approaching the “pervasive,” “flagrant,” “widespread,” and “rampant”\n    discrimination that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions\n    from the rest of the Nation in 1965. Katzenbach, supra, at 308, 315,\n    331. But a more fundamental problem remains: Congress did not use\n    that record to fashion a coverage formula grounded in current condi-\n    tions. It instead re-enacted a formula based on 40-year-old facts hav-\n    ing no logical relation to the present day.

Section 5\nof the Act required States to obtain federal permission\nbefore enacting any law related to voting—a drastic depar-\nture from basic principles of federalism. And §4 of the Act\napplied that requirement only to some States—an equally\ndramatic departure from the principle that all States\nenjoy equal sovereignty. This was strong medicine, but\nCongress determined it was needed to address entrenched\nracial discrimination in voting, “an insidious and perva-\nsive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of\nour country through unremitting and ingenious defiance\nof the Constitution.” South Carolina v. Katzenbach,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107182\"><a href=\"/opinion/107182/south-carolina-v-katzenbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 309 (1966). As we explained in upholding\nthe law, “exceptional conditions can justify legislative\nmeasures not otherwise appropriate.” Id., at 334. Reflect-\ning the unprecedented nature of these measures, they\nwere scheduled to expire after five years. See Voting\nRights Act of 1965, §4(a), 79 Stat. 438.\n\f2               SHELBY COUNTY v.

There is no denying, however, that\nthe conditions that originally justified these measures no\nlonger characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions. By\n2009, “the racial gap in voter registration and turnout\n[was] lower in the States originally covered by §5 than it\n[was] nationwide.” Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist.\nNo. One v.

Since\nthat time, Census Bureau data indicate that African-\nAmerican voter turnout has come to exceed white voter\nturnout in five of the six States originally covered by §5,\nwith a gap in the sixth State of less than one half of one\npercent. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, Re-\nported Voting and Registration, by Sex, Race and His-\npanic Origin, for States (Nov. 2012) (Table 4b).\n  At the same time, voting discrimination still exists; no\none doubts that. The question is whether the Act’s ex-\ntraordinary measures, including its disparate treatment of\nthe States, continue to satisfy constitutional requirements.\nAs we put it a short time ago, “the Act imposes current\nburdens and must be justified by current needs.” North-\nwest Austin, 557 U.

It provides that “[t]he right of\ncitizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or\nabridged by the United States or by any State on account\nof race, color, or previous condition of servitude,” and it\ngives Congress the “power to enforce this article by appro-\npriate legislation.”\n   “The first century of congressional enforcement of the\nAmendment, however, can only be regarded as a failure.”\nId., at 197.

Katzenbach, 383 U.

Voter registration of African-Americans\nbarely improved. Id., at 313–314.\n    Inspired to action by the civil rights movement, Con-\ngress responded in 1965 with the Voting Rights Act.\nSection 2 was enacted to forbid, in all 50 States, any\n“standard, practice, or procedure . . . imposed or applied\n. . . to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United\nStates to vote on account of race or color.” 79 Stat. 437.\nThe current version forbids any “standard, practice, or\nprocedure” that “results in a denial or abridgement of the\nright of any citizen of the United States to vote on account\nof race or color.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §1973(a).

In 1965, the covered States\nincluded Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South\nCarolina, and Virginia. The additional covered subdivi-\nsions included 39 counties in North Carolina and one in\nArizona. See 28 CFR pt. 51, App. (2012).\n  In those jurisdictions, §4 of the Act banned all such tests\nor devices. §4(a), 79 Stat. 438. Section 5 provided that no\nchange in voting procedures could take effect until it was\napproved by federal authorities in Washington, D. C.—\neither the Attorney General or a court of three judges.

As a\nresult of these amendments, the States of Alaska, Arizona,\nand Texas, as well as several counties in California, Flor-\nida, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and South Da-\nkota, became covered jurisdictions. See 28 CFR pt. 51, App.\nCongress correspondingly amended sections 2 and 5 to\nforbid voting discrimination on the basis of membership in\na language minority group, in addition to discrimination\non the basis of race or color. §§203, 206, 89 Stat. 401, 402.\nFinally, Congress made the nationwide ban on tests and\ndevices permanent. §102, id., at 400.\n   In 1982, Congress reauthorized the Act for 25 years, but\ndid not alter its coverage formula. See Voting Rights Act\nAmendments, 96 Stat. 131. Congress did, however, amend\nthe bailout provisions, allowing political subdivisions of\ncovered jurisdictions to bail out. Among other prerequi-\nsites for bailout, jurisdictions and their subdivisions must\nnot have used a forbidden test or device, failed to receive\npreclearance, or lost a §2 suit, in the ten years prior to\nseeking bailout. §2, id., at 131–133.\n   We upheld each of these reauthorizations against con-\nstitutional challenge.

Id.,\nat 873.\n   Turning to §4, the D. C. Circuit noted that the evidence\nfor singling out the covered jurisdictions was “less robust”\nand that the issue presented “a close question.” Id., at\n879. But the court looked to data comparing the number\nof successful §2 suits in the different parts of the country.\nCoupling that evidence with the deterrent effect of §5, the\ncourt concluded that the statute continued “to single out\nthe jurisdictions in which discrimination is concentrated,”\nand thus held that the coverage formula passed constitu-\ntional muster. Id., at 883.\n   Judge Williams dissented. He found “no positive cor-\nrelation between inclusion in §4(b)’s coverage formula and\nlow black registration or turnout.” Id., at 891. Rather,\nto the extent there was any correlation, it actually went\nthe other way: “condemnation under §4(b) is a marker of\nhigher black registration and turnout.” Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). Judge Williams also found that “[c]overed juris-\ndictions have far more black officeholders as a proportion\nof the black population than do uncovered ones.” Id., at\n892. As to the evidence of successful §2 suits, Judge Wil-\nliams disaggregated the reported cases by State, and\nconcluded that “[t]he five worst uncovered jurisdictions . . .\nhave worse records than eight of the covered jurisdic-\ntions.” Id., at 897. He also noted that two covered juris-\ndictions—Arizona and Alaska—had not had any successful\nreported §2 suit brought against them during the entire 24\nyears covered by the data. Ibid.

Coyle concerned the admission of new States, and\nKatzenbach rejected the notion that the principle operated\nas a bar on differential treatment outside that context.\n383 U. S., at 328–329. At the same time, as we made clear\nin Northwest Austin, the fundamental principle of equal\nsovereignty remains highly pertinent in assessing subse-\nquent disparate treatment of States. 557 U. S., at 203.\n   The Voting Rights Act sharply departs from these basic\nprinciples. It suspends “all changes to state election law—\nhowever innocuous—until they have been precleared\nby federal authorities in Washington, D.

The “blight of\nracial discrimination in voting” had “infected the electoral\nprocess in parts of our country for nearly a century.”\nKatzenbach, 383 U. S., at 308. Several States had enacted\na variety of requirements and tests “specifically designed\nto prevent” African-Americans from voting. Id., at 310.\nCase-by-case litigation had proved inadequate to prevent\nsuch racial discrimination in voting, in part because\nStates “merely switched to discriminatory devices not\ncovered by the federal decrees,” “enacted difficult new\ntests,” or simply “defied and evaded court orders.” Id., at\n314. Shortly before enactment of the Voting Rights Act,\nonly 19.4 percent of African-Americans of voting age were\nregistered to vote in Alabama, only 31.8 percent in Louisi-\nana, and only 6.4 percent in Mississippi. Id., at 313.\nThose figures were roughly 50 percentage points or more\nbelow the figures for whites. Ibid.\n  In short, we concluded that “[u]nder the compulsion of\nthese unique circumstances, Congress responded in a\n\f                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npermissibly decisive manner.” Id., at 334, 335. We also\nnoted then and have emphasized since that this extra-\nordinary legislation was intended to be temporary, set to\nexpire after five years. Id., at 333; Northwest Austin,\nsupra, at 199.\n   At the time, the coverage formula—the means of linking\nthe exercise of the unprecedented authority with the\nproblem that warranted it—made sense. We found that\n“Congress chose to limit its attention to the geographic\nareas where immediate action seemed necessary.” Kat-\nzenbach, 383 U. S., at 328. The areas where Congress\nfound “evidence of actual voting discrimination” shared\ntwo characteristics: “the use of tests and devices for voter\nregistration, and a voting rate in the 1964 presidential\nelection at least 12 points below the national average.”\nId., at 330. We explained that “[t]ests and devices are\nrelevant to voting discrimination because of their long\nhistory as a tool for perpetrating the evil; a low voting rate\nis pertinent for the obvious reason that widespread disen-\nfranchisement must inevitably affect the number of actual\nvoters.” Ibid. We therefore concluded that “the coverage\nformula [was] rational in both practice and theory.” Ibid.\nIt accurately reflected those jurisdictions uniquely charac-\nterized by voting discrimination “on a pervasive scale,”\nlinking coverage to the devices used to effectuate discrimi-\nnation and to the resulting disenfranchisement. Id., at\n308. The formula ensured that the “stringent remedies\n[were] aimed at areas where voting discrimination ha[d]\nbeen most flagrant.” Id., at 315.\n                             C\n   Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramati-\ncally. Shelby County contends that the preclearance re-\nquirement, even without regard to its disparate coverage,\nis now unconstitutional. Its arguments have a good deal\nof force. In the covered jurisdictions, “[v]oter turnout and\n\f14              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nregistration rates now approach parity. Blatantly discrim-\ninatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. And minority\ncandidates hold office at unprecedented levels.” Northwest\nAustin, 557 U. S., at 202. The tests and devices that\nblocked access to the ballot have been forbidden nation-\nwide for over 40 years. See §6, 84 Stat. 315; §102, 89 Stat.\n400.\n   Those conclusions are not ours alone. Congress said the\nsame when it reauthorized the Act in 2006, writing that\n“[s]ignificant progress has been made in eliminating first\ngeneration barriers experienced by minority voters, in-\ncluding increased numbers of registered minority voters,\nminority voter turnout, and minority representation in\nCongress, State legislatures, and local elected offices.”\n§2(b)(1), 120 Stat. 577. The House Report elaborated that\n“the number of African-Americans who are registered and\nwho turn out to cast ballots has increased significantly\nover the last 40 years, particularly since 1982,” and noted\nthat “[i]n some circumstances, minorities register to vote\nand cast ballots at levels that surpass those of white vot-\ners.” H. R. Rep. No. 109–478, p. 12 (2006). That Report\nalso explained that there have been “significant increases\nin the number of African-Americans serving in elected\noffices”; more specifically, there has been approximately\na 1,000 percent increase since 1965 in the number of\nAfrican-American elected officials in the six States origi-\nnally covered by the Voting Rights Act. Id., at 18.\n   The following chart, compiled from the Senate and\nHouse Reports, compares voter registration numbers from\n1965 to those from 2004 in the six originally covered\nStates.

Census Bureau data from the most recent election\nindicate that African-American voter turnout exceeded\nwhite voter turnout in five of the six States originally\ncovered by §5, with a gap in the sixth State of less than\none half of one percent. See Dept. of Commerce, Census\nBureau, Reported Voting and Registration, by Sex, Race\nand Hispanic Origin, for States (Table 4b). The preclear-\nance statistics are also illuminating. In the first decade\nafter enactment of §5, the Attorney General objected to\n14.2 percent of proposed voting changes. H. R Rep. No.\n109–478, at 22. In the last decade before reenactment, the\nAttorney General objected to a mere 0.16 percent. S. Rep.\nNo. 109–295, at 13.\n  There is no doubt that these improvements are in large\npart because of the Voting Rights Act. The Act has proved\nimmensely successful at redressing racial discrimination\nand integrating the voting process. See §2(b)(1), 120 Stat.\n577.

Those extraordinary and unprecedented features\nwere reauthorized—as if nothing had changed. In fact,\nthe Act’s unusual remedies have grown even stronger.\nWhen Congress reauthorized the Act in 2006, it did so for\nanother 25 years on top of the previous 40—a far cry from\nthe initial five-year period. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §1973b(a)(8).\nCongress also expanded the prohibitions in §5. We had\npreviously interpreted §5 to prohibit only those redistrict-\ning plans that would have the purpose or effect of worsen-\ning the position of minority groups. See Bossier II, 528\nU. S., at 324, 335–336. In 2006, Congress amended §5\nto prohibit laws that could have favored such groups but\ndid not do so because of a discriminatory purpose, see </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §1973c(c), even though we had stated that such\nbroadening of §5 coverage would “exacerbate the substan-\ntial federalism costs that the preclearance procedure\nalready exacts, perhaps to the extent of raising concerns\nabout §5’s constitutionality,” Bossier II, supra, at 336\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In addi-\ntion, Congress expanded §5 to prohibit any voting law\n“that has the purpose of or will have the effect of diminish-\ning the ability of any citizens of the United States,” on\naccount of race, color, or language minority status, “to\nelect their preferred candidates of choice.” §1973c(b).

S., at 203; see Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S., at 491\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring) (“considerations of race that\nwould doom a redistricting plan under the Fourteenth\nAmendment or §2 [of the Voting Rights Act] seem to be\nwhat save it under §5”). Nothing has happened since to\nalleviate this troubling concern about the current applica-\ntion of §5.\n   Respondents do not deny that there have been im-\nprovements on the ground, but argue that much of this\ncan be attributed to the deterrent effect of §5, which dis-\nsuades covered jurisdictions from engaging in discrimina-\ntion that they would resume should §5 be struck down.\nUnder this theory, however, §5 would be effectively im-\nmune from scrutiny; no matter how “clean” the record\nof covered jurisdictions, the argument could always be\nmade that it was deterrence that accounted for the good\nbehavior.\n   The provisions of §5 apply only to those jurisdictions\nsingled out by §4. We now consider whether that coverage\nformula is constitutional in light of current conditions.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n  When upholding the constitutionality of the coverage\nformula in 1966, we concluded that it was “rational in both\npractice and theory.” Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 330. The\nformula looked to cause (discriminatory tests) and ef-\nfect (low voter registration and turnout), and tailored the\nremedy (preclearance) to those jurisdictions exhibiting\nboth.\n  By 2009, however, we concluded that the “coverage\nformula raise[d] serious constitutional questions.” North-\n\f18               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 204. As we explained, a stat-\nute’s “current burdens” must be justified by “current\nneeds,” and any “disparate geographic coverage” must be\n“sufficiently related to the problem that it targets.” Id., at\n203. The coverage formula met that test in 1965, but no\nlonger does so.\n  Coverage today is based on decades-old data and eradi-\ncated practices. The formula captures States by reference\nto literacy tests and low voter registration and turnout in\nthe 1960s and early 1970s. But such tests have been\nbanned nationwide for over 40 years. §6, 84 Stat. 315;\n§102, 89 Stat. 400. And voter registration and turnout\nnumbers in the covered States have risen dramatically in\nthe years since. H. R. Rep. No. 109–478, at 12. Racial\ndisparity in those numbers was compelling evidence justi-\nfying the preclearance remedy and the coverage formula.\nSee, e.g., Katzenbach, supra, at 313, 329–330. There is no\nlonger such a disparity.\n  In 1965, the States could be divided into two groups:\nthose with a recent history of voting tests and low voter\nregistration and turnout, and those without those charac-\nteristics. Congress based its coverage formula on that\ndistinction. Today the Nation is no longer divided along\nthose lines, yet the Voting Rights Act continues to treat it\nas if it were.\n                              B\n  The Government’s defense of the formula is limited.\nFirst, the Government contends that the formula is “re-\nverse-engineered”: Congress identified the jurisdictions to\nbe covered and then came up with criteria to describe\nthem. Brief for Federal Respondent 48–49. Under that\nreasoning, there need not be any logical relationship be-\ntween the criteria in the formula and the reason for\ncoverage; all that is necessary is that the formula happen\nto capture the jurisdictions Congress wanted to single out.\n\f                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Government suggests that Katzenbach sanctioned\nsuch an approach, but the analysis in Katzenbach was\nquite different. Katzenbach reasoned that the coverage\nformula was rational because the “formula . . . was rele-\nvant to the problem”: “Tests and devices are relevant to\nvoting discrimination because of their long history as a\ntool for perpetrating the evil; a low voting rate is pertinent\nfor the obvious reason that widespread disenfranchise-\nment must inevitably affect the number of actual voters.”\n383 U. S., at 329, 330.\n   Here, by contrast, the Government’s reverse-\nengineering argument does not even attempt to demon-\nstrate the continued relevance of the formula to the problem\nit targets. And in the context of a decision as significant\nas this one—subjecting a disfavored subset of States\nto “extraordinary legislation otherwise unfamiliar to our\nfederal system,” Northwest Austin, supra, at 211—that\nfailure to establish even relevance is fatal.\n   The Government falls back to the argument that be-\ncause the formula was relevant in 1965, its continued use\nis permissible so long as any discrimination remains in the\nStates Congress identified back then—regardless of how\nthat discrimination compares to discrimination in States\nunburdened by coverage. Brief for Federal Respondent\n49–50. This argument does not look to “current political\nconditions,” Northwest Austin, supra, at 203, but instead\nrelies on a comparison between the States in 1965. That\ncomparison reflected the different histories of the North\nand South. It was in the South that slavery was upheld by\nlaw until uprooted by the Civil War, that the reign of Jim\nCrow denied African-Americans the most basic freedoms,\nand that state and local governments worked tirelessly to\ndisenfranchise citizens on the basis of race. The Court\ninvoked that history—rightly so—in sustaining the dis-\nparate coverage of the Voting Rights Act in 1966. See\nKatzenbach, supra, at 308 (“The constitutional propriety of\n\f20              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965 must be judged with refer-\nence to the historical experience which it reflects.”).\n   But history did not end in 1965. By the time the Act\nwas reauthorized in 2006, there had been 40 more years of\nit. In assessing the “current need[ ]” for a preclearance\nsystem that treats States differently from one another\ntoday, that history cannot be ignored. During that time,\nlargely because of the Voting Rights Act, voting tests were\nabolished, disparities in voter registration and turnout\ndue to race were erased, and African-Americans attained\npolitical office in record numbers. And yet the coverage\nformula that Congress reauthorized in 2006 ignores these\ndevelopments, keeping the focus on decades-old data rel-\nevant to decades-old problems, rather than current data\nreflecting current needs.\n   The Fifteenth Amendment commands that the right to\nvote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race or\ncolor, and it gives Congress the power to enforce that\ncommand. The Amendment is not designed to punish for\nthe past; its purpose is to ensure a better future. See Rice\nv. Cayetano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118340\"><a href=\"/opinion/118340/rice-v-cayetano/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 512 (2000) (“Consistent with\nthe design of the Constitution, the [Fifteenth] Amendment\nis cast in fundamental terms, terms transcending the\nparticular controversy which was the immediate impetus\nfor its enactment.”). To serve that purpose, Congress—if it\nis to divide the States—must identify those jurisdictions to\nbe singled out on a basis that makes sense in light of\ncurrent conditions. It cannot rely simply on the past. We\nmade that clear in Northwest Austin, and we make it clear\nagain today.\n                             C\n  In defending the coverage formula, the Government, the\nintervenors, and the dissent also rely heavily on data from\nthe record that they claim justify disparate coverage.\nCongress compiled thousands of pages of evidence before\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U.

The court below and\nthe parties have debated what that record shows—they\nhave gone back and forth about whether to compare cov-\nered to noncovered jurisdictions as blocks, how to dis-\naggregate the data State by State, how to weigh §2 cases\nas evidence of ongoing discrimination, and whether to\nconsider evidence not before Congress, among other is-\nsues. Compare, e.g., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">679</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 873–883 (case below),\nwith id., at 889–902 (Williams, J., dissenting). Regardless\nof how to look at the record, however, no one can fairly say\nthat it shows anything approaching the “pervasive,” “fla-\ngrant,” “widespread,” and “rampant” discrimination that\nfaced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the\ncovered jurisdictions from the rest of the Nation at that\ntime. Katzenbach, supra, at 308, 315, 331; Northwest\nAustin, 557 U. S., at 201.\n   But a more fundamental problem remains: Congress did\nnot use the record it compiled to shape a coverage formula\ngrounded in current conditions. It instead reenacted a\nformula based on 40-year-old facts having no logical rela-\ntion to the present day. The dissent relies on “second-\ngeneration barriers,” which are not impediments to the\ncasting of ballots, but rather electoral arrangements that\naffect the weight of minority votes. That does not cure the\nproblem. Viewing the preclearance requirements as tar-\ngeting such efforts simply highlights the irrationality of\ncontinued reliance on the §4 coverage formula, which is\nbased on voting tests and access to the ballot, not vote\ndilution. We cannot pretend that we are reviewing an\nupdated statute, or try our hand at updating the statute\nourselves, based on the new record compiled by Congress.\nContrary to the dissent’s contention, see post, at 23, we are\nnot ignoring the record; we are simply recognizing that it\nplayed no role in shaping the statutory formula before us\ntoday.\n   The dissent also turns to the record to argue that, in\n\f22              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlight of voting discrimination in Shelby County, the county\ncannot complain about the provisions that subject it to\npreclearance. Post, at 23–30. But that is like saying that\na driver pulled over pursuant to a policy of stopping all\nredheads cannot complain about that policy, if it turns out\nhis license has expired. Shelby County’s claim is that the\ncoverage formula here is unconstitutional in all its appli-\ncations, because of how it selects the jurisdictions sub-\njected to preclearance. The county was selected based on\nthat formula, and may challenge it in court.\n                             D\n   The dissent proceeds from a flawed premise. It quotes\nthe famous sentence from McCulloch v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85272\"><a href=\"/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 421 (1819), with the following emphasis: “Let\nthe end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the\nconstitution, and all means which are appropriate, which\nare plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited,\nbut consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution,\nare constitutional.” Post, at 9 (emphasis in dissent). But\nthis case is about a part of the sentence that the dissent\ndoes not emphasize—the part that asks whether a legisla-\ntive means is “consist[ent] with the letter and spirit of the\nconstitution.” The dissent states that “[i]t cannot tenably\nbe maintained” that this is an issue with regard to the\nVoting Rights Act, post, at 9, but four years ago, in an\nopinion joined by two of today’s dissenters, the Court\nexpressly stated that “[t]he Act’s preclearance require-\nment and its coverage formula raise serious constitutional\nquestions.” Northwest Austin, supra, at 204. The dissent\ndoes not explain how those “serious constitutional ques-\ntions” became untenable in four short years.\n   The dissent treats the Act as if it were just like any\nother piece of legislation, but this Court has made clear\nfrom the beginning that the Voting Rights Act is far from\nordinary. At the risk of repetition, Katzenbach indicated\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U.

S., at 334, 335. Multiple decisions\nsince have reaffirmed the Act’s “extraordinary” nature.\nSee, e.g., Northwest Austin, supra, at 211. Yet the dissent\ngoes so far as to suggest instead that the preclearance\nrequirement and disparate treatment of the States should\nbe upheld into the future “unless there [is] no or almost no\nevidence of unconstitutional action by States.” Post, at 33.\n   In other ways as well, the dissent analyzes the ques-\ntion presented as if our decision in Northwest Austin never\nhappened. For example, the dissent refuses to con-\nsider the principle of equal sovereignty, despite Northwest\nAustin’s emphasis on its significance. Northwest Austin\nalso emphasized the “dramatic” progress since 1965, 557\nU. S., at 201, but the dissent describes current levels of\ndiscrimination as “flagrant,” “widespread,” and “perva-\nsive,” post, at 7, 17 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nDespite the fact that Northwest Austin requires an Act’s\n“disparate geographic coverage” to be “sufficiently related”\nto its targeted problems, 557 U. S., at 203, the dissent\nmaintains that an Act’s limited coverage actually eases\nCongress’s burdens, and suggests that a fortuitous rela-\ntionship should suffice. Although Northwest Austin stated\ndefinitively that “current burdens” must be justified by\n“current needs,” ibid., the dissent argues that the coverage\nformula can be justified by history, and that the required\nshowing can be weaker on reenactment than when the law\nwas first passed.\n   There is no valid reason to insulate the coverage for-\nmula from review merely because it was previously enacted\n40 years ago. If Congress had started from scratch in\n2006, it plainly could not have enacted the present cover-\nage formula. It would have been irrational for Congress to\ndistinguish between States in such a fundamental way\nbased on 40-year-old data, when today’s statistics tell an\n\f24              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nentirely different story. And it would have been irrational\nto base coverage on the use of voting tests 40 years ago,\nwhen such tests have been illegal since that time. But\nthat is exactly what Congress has done.\n                         *    *    *\n   Striking down an Act of Congress “is the gravest and\nmost delicate duty that this Court is called on to perform.”\nBlodgett v.

We do not do so lightly. That is why, in 2009,\nwe took care to avoid ruling on the constitutionality of\nthe Voting Rights Act when asked to do so, and instead\nresolved the case then before us on statutory grounds. But\nin issuing that decision, we expressed our broader con-\ncerns about the constitutionality of the Act. Congress\ncould have updated the coverage formula at that time, but\ndid not do so. Its failure to act leaves us today with no\nchoice but to declare §4(b) unconstitutional. The formula\nin that section can no longer be used as a basis for subject-\ning jurisdictions to preclearance.\n   Our decision in no way affects the permanent, nation-\nwide ban on racial discrimination in voting found in §2.\nWe issue no holding on §5 itself, only on the coverage\nformula. Congress may draft another formula based on\ncurrent conditions.

Though §5’s preclear-\nance requirement represented a “shar[p] depart[ure]” from\n“basic principles” of federalism and the equal sovereignty\nof the States, ante, at 9, 11, the Court upheld the measure\nagainst early constitutional challenges because it was\nnecessary at the time to address “voting discrimination\nwhere it persist[ed] on a pervasive scale.” Katzenbach,\nsupra, at 308.\n    Today, our Nation has changed. “[T]he conditions that\noriginally justified [§5] no longer characterize voting in the\ncovered jurisdictions.” Ante, at 2.

However one aggregates the\ndata compiled by Congress, it cannot justify the consider-\nable burdens created by §5.

Congress was of\nanother mind. Recognizing that large progress has been\nmade, Congress determined, based on a voluminous rec­\nord, that the scourge of discrimination was not yet extir­\npated. The question this case presents is who decides\nwhether, as currently operative, §5 remains justifiable,1\nthis Court, or a Congress charged with the obligation to\nenforce the post-Civil War Amendments “by appropriate\nlegislation.” With overwhelming support in both Houses,\nCongress concluded that, for two prime reasons, §5 should\ncontinue in force, unabated. First, continuance would\nfacilitate completion of the impressive gains thus far\nmade; and second, continuance would guard against back­\nsliding. Those assessments were well within Congress’\nprovince to make and should elicit this Court’s unstinting\napprobation.\n                             I\n  “[V]oting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that.”\n——————\n   1 The Court purports to declare unconstitutional only the coverage\n\nformula set out in §4(b).

But the Court today terminates the remedy\nthat proved to be best suited to block that discrimination.\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) has worked to com­\nbat voting discrimination where other remedies had been\ntried and failed. Particularly effective is the VRA’s re­\nquirement of federal preclearance for all changes to voting\nlaws in the regions of the country with the most aggravated\nrecords of rank discrimination against minority voting\nrights.\n   A century after the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amend­\nments guaranteed citizens the right to vote free of dis­\ncrimination on the basis of race, the “blight of racial\ndiscrimination in voting” continued to “infec[t] the\nelectoral process in parts of our country.” South Carolina v.\nKatzenbach, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107182\"><a href=\"/opinion/107182/south-carolina-v-katzenbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308 (1966). Early attempts to\ncope with this vile infection resembled battling the Hydra.\nWhenever one form of voting discrimination was identified\nand prohibited, others sprang up in its place. This Court\nrepeatedly encountered the remarkable “variety and\npersistence” of laws disenfranchising minority citizens.\nId., at 311.

In the Civil Rights\nActs of 1957, 1960, and 1964, Congress authorized and\nthen expanded the power of “the Attorney General to seek\ninjunctions against public and private interference with\nthe right to vote on racial grounds.” Katzenbach, 383\nU. S., at 313. But circumstances reduced the ameliorative\npotential of these legislative Acts:\n    “Voting suits are unusually onerous to prepare, some­\n    times requiring as many as 6,000 man-hours spent\n    combing through registration records in preparation\n    for trial. Litigation has been exceedingly slow, in part\n    because of the ample opportunities for delay afforded\n    voting officials and others involved in the proceed­\n    ings. Even when favorable decisions have finally been\n    obtained, some of the States affected have merely\n    switched to discriminatory devices not covered by the\n    federal decrees or have enacted difficult new tests de­\n    signed to prolong the existing disparity between white\n    and Negro registration. Alternatively, certain local of­\n    ficials have defied and evaded court orders or have\n    simply closed their registration offices to freeze the\n    voting rolls.” Id., at 314 (footnote omitted).\nPatently, a new approach was needed.\n   Answering that need, the Voting Rights Act became one\nof the most consequential, efficacious, and amply justified\nexercises of federal legislative power in our Nation’s his­\ntory.

In the alternative, the covered jurisdiction may seek\napproval by a three-judge District Court in the District of\nColumbia.\n   After a century’s failure to fulfill the promise of the\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, passage of the\nVRA finally led to signal improvement on this front. “The\nJustice Department estimated that in the five years after\n[the VRA’s] passage, almost as many blacks registered [to\nvote] in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, North\nCarolina, and South Carolina as in the entire century\nbefore 1965.” Davidson, The Voting Rights Act: A Brief\nHistory, in Controversies in Minority Voting 7, 21 (B.\nGrofman & C. Davidson eds. 1992). And in assessing the\noverall effects of the VRA in 2006, Congress found that\n“[s]ignificant progress has been made in eliminating first\ngeneration barriers experienced by minority voters, in­\ncluding increased numbers of registered minority voters,\nminority voter turnout, and minority representation in\nCongress, State legislatures, and local elected offices.

The Fifteenth Amend­\nment, which targets precisely and only racial discrimina­\ntion in voting rights, states that, in this domain, “Congress\nshall have power to enforce this article by appropriate\nlegislation.”2 In choosing this language, the Amendment’s\nframers invoked Chief Justice Marshall’s formulation of\nthe scope of Congress’ powers under the Necessary and\nProper Clause:\n     “Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of\n     the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,\n     which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not\n     prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the\n     constitution, are constitutional.” McCulloch v.

Each of these Amendments contains the\nsame broad empowerment of Congress to enact “appropriate legisla­\ntion” to enforce the protected right. The implication is unmistakable:\nUnder our constitutional structure, Congress holds the lead rein in\nmaking the right to vote equally real for all U. S. citizens. These\nAmendments are in line with the special role assigned to Congress in\nprotecting the integrity of the democratic process in federal elections.\nU. S. Const., Art. I, §4 (“[T]he Congress may at any time by Law make\nor alter” regulations concerning the “Times, Places and Manner of\nholding Elections for Senators and Representatives.”); Arizona v.

Notably, “the Founders’\nfirst successful amendment told Congress that it could\n‘make no law’ over a certain domain”; in contrast, the Civil\nWar Amendments used “language [that] authorized trans­\nformative new federal statutes to uproot all vestiges of\nunfreedom and inequality” and provided “sweeping en­\nforcement powers . . . to enact ‘appropriate’ legislation\ntargeting state abuses.” A. Amar, America’s Constitution:\nA Biography 361, 363, 399 (2005). See also McConnell,\nInstitutions and Interpretation: A Critique of City of\nBoerne v. Flores, 111 Harv. L.

The remedy was\nlegislative.”).\n   The stated purpose of the Civil War Amendments was to\narm Congress with the power and authority to protect all\npersons within the Nation from violations of their rights\nby the States. In exercising that power, then, Congress\nmay use “all means which are appropriate, which are\nplainly adapted” to the constitutional ends declared by\nthese Amendments. McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 421. So\nwhen Congress acts to enforce the right to vote free from\nracial discrimination, we ask not whether Congress has\nchosen the means most wise, but whether Congress has\nrationally selected means appropriate to a legitimate end.\n“It is not for us to review the congressional resolution of\n[the need for its chosen remedy].

S., at 324. Faced with subsequent reauthorizations of\nthe VRA, the Court has reaffirmed this standard. E.g.,\nCity of Rome, 446 U. S., at 178. Today’s Court does not\npurport to alter settled precedent establishing that the\ndispositive question is whether Congress has employed\n“rational means.”\n   For three reasons, legislation reauthorizing an existing\nstatute is especially likely to satisfy the minimal require­\nments of the rational-basis test. First, when reauthorization\nis at issue, Congress has already assembled a legislative\nrecord justifying the initial legislation. Congress is en­\ntitled to consider that preexisting record as well as the\nrecord before it at the time of the vote on reauthorization.\nThis is especially true where, as here, the Court has re­\npeatedly affirmed the statute’s constitutionality and Con­\ngress has adhered to the very model the Court has upheld.\nSee id., at 174 (“The appellants are asking us to do noth­\ning less than overrule our decision in South Carolina v.\nKatzenbach . . . , in which we upheld the constitutionality\nof the Act.”); Lopez v. Monterey County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118257\"><a href=\"/opinion/118257/lopez-v-monterey-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 283\n(1999) (similar).\n   Second, the very fact that reauthorization is necessary\narises because Congress has built a temporal limitation\ninto the Act. It has pledged to review, after a span of\nyears (first 15, then 25) and in light of contemporary\nevidence, the continued need for the VRA. Cf. Grutter v.\nBollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 343 (2003) (anticipating, but not\nguaranteeing, that, in 25 years, “the use of racial prefer­\nences [in higher education] will no longer be necessary”).\n   Third, a reviewing court should expect the record sup­\nporting reauthorization to be less stark than the record\noriginally made. Demand for a record of violations equiva­\nlent to the one earlier made would expose Congress to a\n\f12               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ncatch-22. If the statute was working, there would be less\nevidence of discrimination, so opponents might argue that\nCongress should not be allowed to renew the statute. In\ncontrast, if the statute was not working, there would be\nplenty of evidence of discrimination, but scant reason to\nrenew a failed regulatory regime. See Persily 193–194.\n  This is not to suggest that congressional power in this\narea is limitless. It is this Court’s responsibility to ensure\nthat Congress has used appropriate means. The question\nmeet for judicial review is whether the chosen means are\n“adapted to carry out the objects the amendments have in\nview.” Ex parte Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90041\"><a href=\"/opinion/90041/ex-parte-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 346 (1880). The\nCourt’s role, then, is not to substitute its judgment for that\nof Congress, but to determine whether the legislative\nrecord sufficed to show that “Congress could rationally\nhave determined that [its chosen] provisions were appro­\npriate methods.” City of Rome, 446 U. S., at 176–177.\n  In summary, the Constitution vests broad power in\nCongress to protect the right to vote, and in particular to\ncombat racial discrimination in voting. This Court has\nrepeatedly reaffirmed Congress’ prerogative to use any\nrational means in exercise of its power in this area. And\nboth precedent and logic dictate that the rational-means\ntest should be easier to satisfy, and the burden on the\nstatute’s challenger should be higher, when what is at\nissue is the reauthorization of a remedy that the Court has\npreviously affirmed, and that Congress found, from con­\ntemporary evidence, to be working to advance the legisla­\nture’s legitimate objective.\n                               III\n  The 2006 reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act fully\nsatisfies the standard stated in McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at\n421: Congress may choose any means “appropriate” and\n“plainly adapted to” a legitimate constitutional end. As we\nshall see, it is implausible to suggest otherwise.\n\f                  Cite as: 570 U.

The surest\nway to evaluate whether that remedy remains in order is\nto see if preclearance is still effectively preventing discrim­\ninatory changes to voting laws. See City of Rome, 446\nU. S., at 181 (identifying “information on the number and\ntypes of submissions made by covered jurisdictions and\nthe number and nature of objections interposed by the\nAttorney General” as a primary basis for upholding the\n1975 reauthorization). On that score, the record before\nCongress was huge. In fact, Congress found there were\nmore DOJ objections between 1982 and 2004 (626) than\nthere were between 1965 and the 1982 reauthorization\n(490). 1 Voting Rights Act: Evidence of Continued Need,\nHearing before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of\nthe House Committee on the Judiciary, 109th Cong., 2d\nSess., p. 172 (2006) (hereinafter Evidence of Continued\nNeed).\n   All told, between 1982 and 2006, DOJ objections blocked\nover 700 voting changes based on a determination that the\nchanges were discriminatory. H. R. Rep. No. 109–478, at\n21. Congress found that the majority of DOJ objections\nincluded findings of discriminatory intent, see </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">679</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nat 867, and that the changes blocked by preclearance were\n“calculated decisions to keep minority voters from fully\nparticipating in the political process.” H.

On top of that, over the same time period the DOJ\nand private plaintiffs succeeded in more than 100 actions\nto enforce the §5 preclearance requirements. 1 Evidence\nof Continued Need 186, 250.\n   In addition to blocking proposed voting changes through\npreclearance, DOJ may request more information from a\njurisdiction proposing a change.

Congress\nreceived evidence that more than 800 proposed changes\nwere altered or withdrawn since the last reauthorization\nin 1982. H. R. Rep. No. 109–478, at 40–41.4 Congress also\nreceived empirical studies finding that DOJ’s requests for\nmore information had a significant effect on the degree to\nwhich covered jurisdictions “compl[ied] with their obliga­\ntio[n]” to protect minority voting rights. 2 Evidence of\nContinued Need 2555.\n   Congress also received evidence that litigation under §2\nof the VRA was an inadequate substitute for preclearance\nin the covered jurisdictions.

There was what one commentator\ndescribed as an “avalanche of case studies of voting rights\nviolations in the covered jurisdictions,” ranging from\n“outright intimidation and violence against minority\nvoters” to “more subtle forms of voting rights depriva­\ntions.” Persily 202 (footnote omitted). This evidence gave\nCongress ever more reason to conclude that the time had\nnot yet come for relaxed vigilance against the scourge of\nrace discrimination in voting.\n   True, conditions in the South have impressively im­\nproved since passage of the Voting Rights Act. Congress\nnoted this improvement and found that the VRA was the\ndriving force behind it. 2006 Reauthorization §2(b)(1).\nBut Congress also found that voting discrimination had\nevolved into subtler second-generation barriers, and that\neliminating preclearance would risk loss of the gains that\nhad been made. §§2(b)(2), (9). Concerns of this order, the\nCourt previously found, gave Congress adequate cause to\nreauthorize the VRA. City of Rome, 446 U.

Ibid.\n                              B\n  I turn next to the evidence on which Congress based its\ndecision to reauthorize the coverage formula in §4(b).\nBecause Congress did not alter the coverage formula, the\nsame jurisdictions previously subject to preclearance\ncontinue to be covered by this remedy. The evidence just\ndescribed, of preclearance’s continuing efficacy in blocking\nconstitutional violations in the covered jurisdictions, itself\ngrounded Congress’ conclusion that the remedy should be\nretained for those jurisdictions.\n  There is no question, moreover, that the covered juris­\ndictions have a unique history of problems with racial\ndiscrimination in voting. Ante, at 12–13. Consideration of\nthis long history, still in living memory, was altogether\nappropriate. The Court criticizes Congress for failing to\nrecognize that “history did not end in 1965.” Ante, at 20.\nBut the Court ignores that “what’s past is prologue.” W.\nShakespeare, The Tempest, act 2, sc. 1. And “[t]hose who\ncannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” 1\nG. Santayana, The Life of Reason 284 (1905). Congress\nwas especially mindful of the need to reinforce the gains\nalready made and to prevent backsliding. 2006 Reauthor­\nization §2(b)(9).\n  Of particular importance, even after 40 years and thou­\nsands of discriminatory changes blocked by preclearance,\nconditions in the covered jurisdictions demonstrated that\nthe formula was still justified by “current needs.” North-\nwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 203.\n  Congress learned of these conditions through a report,\nknown as the Katz study, that looked at §2 suits between\n1982 and 2004. To Examine the Impact and Effectiveness\nof the Voting Rights Act: Hearing before the Subcommit­\ntee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the\n\f20                  SHELBY COUNTY v.

Because the pri­\nvate right of action authorized by §2 of the VRA applies\nnationwide, a comparison of §2 lawsuits in covered and\nnoncovered jurisdictions provides an appropriate yardstick\nfor measuring differences between covered and noncovered\njurisdictions. If differences in the risk of voting discrimi­\nnation between covered and noncovered jurisdictions had\ndisappeared, one would expect that the rate of successful\n§2 lawsuits would be roughly the same in both areas.6 The\nstudy’s findings, however, indicated that racial discrimi­\nnation in voting remains “concentrated in the jurisdictions\nsingled out for preclearance.” Northwest Austin, 557 U. S.,\nat 203.\n  Although covered jurisdictions account for less than 25\npercent of the country’s population, the Katz study re­\nvealed that they accounted for 56 percent of successful\n§2 litigation since 1982.

From these findings—ignored by the Court—\nCongress reasonably concluded that the coverage formula\ncontinues to identify the jurisdictions of greatest concern.\n  The evidence before Congress, furthermore, indicated\nthat voting in the covered jurisdictions was more racially\npolarized than elsewhere in the country. H. R. Rep. No.\n109–478, at 34–35. While racially polarized voting alone\n——————\n  6 Because preclearance occurs only in covered jurisdictions and can be\n\nexpected to stop the most obviously objectionable measures, one would\nexpect a lower rate of successful §2 lawsuits in those jurisdictions if\nthe risk of voting discrimination there were the same as elsewhere in the\ncountry.\n\f                  Cite as: 570 U.

The reason is twofold.\nFirst, racial polarization means that racial minorities are\nat risk of being systematically outvoted and having their\ninterests underrepresented in legislatures. Second, “when\npolitical preferences fall along racial lines, the natural\ninclinations of incumbents and ruling parties to entrench\nthemselves have predictable racial effects. Under circum­\nstances of severe racial polarization, efforts to gain politi­\ncal advantage translate into race-specific disadvantages.”\nAnsolabehere, Persily, & Stewart, Regional Differences\nin Racial Polarization in the 2012 Presidential Election:\nImplications for the Constitutionality of Section 5 of the\nVoting Rights Act, 126 Harv. L. Rev. Forum 205, 209\n(2013).\n  In other words, a governing political coalition has an\nincentive to prevent changes in the existing balance of\nvoting power. When voting is racially polarized, efforts by\nthe ruling party to pursue that incentive “will inevitably\ndiscriminate against a racial group.” Ibid. Just as build­\nings in California have a greater need to be earthquake­\nproofed, places where there is greater racial polarization\nin voting have a greater need for prophylactic measures to\nprevent purposeful race discrimination. This point was\nunderstood by Congress and is well recognized in the\nacademic literature. See 2006 Reauthorization §2(b)(3),\n120 Stat. 577 (“The continued evidence of racially polar­\nized voting in each of the jurisdictions covered by the\n[preclearance requirement] demonstrates that racial and\nlanguage minorities remain politically vulnerable”); H. R.\nRep. No. 109–478, at 35; Davidson, The Recent Evolution\nof Voting Rights Law Affecting Racial and Language\nMinorities, in Quiet Revolution 21, 22.\n  The case for retaining a coverage formula that met\nneeds on the ground was therefore solid. Congress might\n\f22              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nhave been charged with rigidity had it afforded covered\njurisdictions no way out or ignored jurisdictions that\nneeded superintendence. Congress, however, responded to\nthis concern. Critical components of the congressional\ndesign are the statutory provisions allowing jurisdictions\nto “bail out” of preclearance, and for court-ordered “bail\nins.” See Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 199. The VRA\npermits a jurisdiction to bail out by showing that it has\ncomplied with the Act for ten years, and has engaged in\nefforts to eliminate intimidation and harassment of vot­\ners. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §1973b(a) (2006 ed. and Supp. V). It also\nauthorizes a court to subject a noncovered jurisdiction to\nfederal preclearance upon finding that violations of the\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments have occurred\nthere. §1973a(c) (2006 ed.).\n   Congress was satisfied that the VRA’s bailout mecha­\nnism provided an effective means of adjusting the VRA’s\ncoverage over time. H. R. Rep. No. 109–478, at 25 (the\nsuccess of bailout “illustrates that: (1) covered status is\nneither permanent nor over-broad; and (2) covered status\nhas been and continues to be within the control of the\njurisdiction such that those jurisdictions that have a genu­\ninely clean record and want to terminate coverage have\nthe ability to do so”). Nearly 200 jurisdictions have suc­\ncessfully bailed out of the preclearance requirement, and\nDOJ has consented to every bailout application filed by an\neligible jurisdiction since the current bailout procedure\nbecame effective in 1984. Brief for Federal Respondent 54.\nThe bail-in mechanism has also worked.

The same cannot be\nsaid of the Court’s opinion today. The Court makes no\ngenuine attempt to engage with the massive legislative\nrecord that Congress assembled. Instead, it relies on\nincreases in voter registration and turnout as if that were\nthe whole story. See supra, at 18–19. Without even\nidentifying a standard of review, the Court dismissively\nbrushes off arguments based on “data from the record,” and\ndeclines to enter the “debat[e about] what [the] record\nshows.” Ante, at 20–21. One would expect more from an\nopinion striking at the heart of the Nation’s signal piece of\ncivil-rights legislation.\n  I note the most disturbing lapses. First, by what right,\ngiven its usual restraint, does the Court even address\nShelby County’s facial challenge to the VRA? Second, the\nCourt veers away from controlling precedent regarding the\n“equal sovereignty” doctrine without even acknowledging\nthat it is doing so. Third, hardly showing the respect\nordinarily paid when Congress acts to implement the Civil\nWar Amendments, and as just stressed, the Court does not\neven deign to grapple with the legislative record.\n                             A\n  Shelby County launched a purely facial challenge to the\nVRA’s 2006 reauthorization. “A facial challenge to a\nlegislative Act,” the Court has other times said, “is, of\ncourse, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,\nsince the challenger must establish that no set of circum­\n\f24              SHELBY COUNTY v.

S., at 610. Yet the Court’s opinion in\nthis case contains not a word explaining why Congress\nlacks the power to subject to preclearance the particular\nplaintiff that initiated this lawsuit—Shelby County, Ala­\nbama. The reason for the Court’s silence is apparent, for\nas applied to Shelby County, the VRA’s preclearance\nrequirement is hardly contestable.\n   Alabama is home to Selma, site of the “Bloody Sunday”\nbeatings of civil-rights demonstrators that served as the\ncatalyst for the VRA’s enactment. Following those events,\nMartin Luther King, Jr., led a march from Selma to Mont­\ngomery, Alabama’s capital, where he called for passage of\nthe VRA. If the Act passed, he foresaw, progress could be\nmade even in Alabama, but there had to be a steadfast\nnational commitment to see the task through to comple­\ntion.

Leaping to resolve Shelby County’s facial\nchallenge without considering whether application of the\nVRA to Shelby County is constitutional, or even address­\ning the VRA’s severability provision, the Court’s opinion\ncan hardly be described as an exemplar of restrained and\nmoderate decisionmaking.

But the Court clouds that\nonce clear understanding by citing dictum from Northwest\nAustin to convey that the principle of equal sovereignty\n“remains highly pertinent in assessing subsequent dispar­\nate treatment of States.” Ante, at 11 (citing 557 U. S., at\n203). See also ante, at 23 (relying on Northwest Austin’s\n“emphasis on [the] significance” of the equal-sovereignty\nprinciple). If the Court is suggesting that dictum in\nNorthwest Austin silently overruled Katzenbach’s limita­\ntion of the equal sovereignty doctrine to “the admission of\nnew States,” the suggestion is untenable. Northwest\nAustin cited Katzenbach’s holding in the course of declin-\ning to decide whether the VRA was constitutional or even\nwhat standard of review applied to the question. 557\nU. S., at 203–204. In today’s decision, the Court ratchets\nup what was pure dictum in Northwest Austin, attributing\nbreadth to the equal sovereignty principle in flat contra­\ndiction of Katzenbach. The Court does so with nary an\nexplanation of why it finds Katzenbach wrong, let alone\nany discussion of whether stare decisis nonetheless coun­\nsels adherence to Katzenbach’s ruling on the limited “sig­\nnificance” of the equal sovereignty principle.\n   Today’s unprecedented extension of the equal sover­\neignty principle outside its proper domain—the admission\nof new States—is capable of much mischief.

No such\nclaim can be made about the congressional record for the\n2006 VRA reauthorization. Given a record replete with\nexamples of denial or abridgment of a paramount federal\nright, the Court should have left the matter where it\nbelongs: in Congress’ bailiwick.\n   Instead, the Court strikes §4(b)’s coverage provision\nbecause, in its view, the provision is not based on “current\nconditions.” Ante, at 17. It discounts, however, that one\nsuch condition was the preclearance remedy in place in\nthe covered jurisdictions, a remedy Congress designed\nboth to catch discrimination before it causes harm, and to\nguard against return to old ways. 2006 Reauthorization\n§2(b)(3), (9). Volumes of evidence supported Congress’ de­\ntermination that the prospect of retrogression was real.\nThrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is\ncontinuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like\nthrowing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you\nare not getting wet.\n   But, the Court insists, the coverage formula is no good;\nit is based on “decades-old data and eradicated practices.”\nAnte, at 18. Even if the legislative record shows, as engag­\ning with it would reveal, that the formula accurately\n\f34               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nidentifies the jurisdictions with the worst conditions of\nvoting discrimination, that is of no moment, as the Court\nsees it. Congress, the Court decrees, must “star[t] from\nscratch.” Ante, at 23. I do not see why that should be so.\n   Congress’ chore was different in 1965 than it was in\n2006. In 1965, there were a “small number of States . . .\nwhich in most instances were familiar to Congress by\nname,” on which Congress fixed its attention. Katzenbach,\n383 U. S., at 328. In drafting the coverage formula, “Con­\ngress began work with reliable evidence of actual voting\ndiscrimination in a great majority of the States” it sought\nto target. Id., at 329. “The formula [Congress] eventually\nevolved to describe these areas” also captured a few States\nthat had not been the subject of congressional factfinding.\nIbid. Nevertheless, the Court upheld the formula in its\nentirety, finding it fair “to infer a significant danger of the\nevil” in all places the formula covered. Ibid.\n   The situation Congress faced in 2006, when it took up\nreauthorization of the coverage formula, was not the same.\nBy then, the formula had been in effect for many years,\nand all of the jurisdictions covered by it were “familiar\nto Congress by name.” Id., at 328. The question before\nCongress: Was there still a sufficient basis to support\ncontinued application of the preclearance remedy in each\nof those already-identified places? There was at that point\nno chance that the formula might inadvertently sweep in\nnew areas that were not the subject of congressional\nfindings. And Congress could determine from the record\nwhether the jurisdictions captured by the coverage for­\nmula still belonged under the preclearance regime. If they\ndid, there was no need to alter the formula. That is why\nthe Court, in addressing prior reauthorizations of the\nVRA, did not question the continuing “relevance” of the\nformula.\n   Consider once again the components of the record before\nCongress in 2006. The coverage provision identified a\n\f                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            35\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nknown list of places with an undisputed history of serious\nproblems with racial discrimination in voting. Recent\nevidence relating to Alabama and its counties was there\nfor all to see. Multiple Supreme Court decisions had\nupheld the coverage provision, most recently in 1999.\nThere was extensive evidence that, due to the preclear­\nance mechanism, conditions in the covered jurisdictions\nhad notably improved. And there was evidence that pre­\nclearance was still having a substantial real-world effect,\nhaving stopped hundreds of discriminatory voting changes\nin the covered jurisdictions since the last reauthorization.\nIn addition, there was evidence that racial polarization in\nvoting was higher in covered jurisdictions than elsewhere,\nincreasing the vulnerability of minority citizens in those\njurisdictions. And countless witnesses, reports, and case\nstudies documented continuing problems with voting dis­\ncrimination in those jurisdictions. In light of this rec­\nord, Congress had more than a reasonable basis to\nconclude that the existing coverage formula was not out of\nsync with conditions on the ground in covered areas. And\ncertainly Shelby County was no candidate for release\nthrough the mechanism Congress provided. See supra, at\n22–23, 26–28.\n   The Court holds §4(b) invalid on the ground that it is\n“irrational to base coverage on the use of voting tests 40\nyears ago, when such tests have been illegal since that\ntime.” Ante, at 23. But the Court disregards what Con­\ngress set about to do in enacting the VRA. That extraor­\ndinary legislation scarcely stopped at the particular tests\nand devices that happened to exist in 1965. The grand\naim of the Act is to secure to all in our polity equal citizen­\nship stature, a voice in our democracy undiluted by race.\nAs the record for the 2006 reauthorization makes abun­\ndantly clear, second-generation barriers to minority voting\nrights have emerged in the covered jurisdictions as at­\ntempted substitutes for the first-generation barriers that\n\f36               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\noriginally triggered preclearance in those jurisdictions.\nSee supra, at 5–6, 8, 15–17.\n   The sad irony of today’s decision lies in its utter failure\nto grasp why the VRA has proven effective. The Court\nappears to believe that the VRA’s success in eliminating\nthe specific devices extant in 1965 means that preclear­\nance is no longer needed. Ante, at 21–22, 23–24. With\nthat belief, and the argument derived from it, history\nrepeats itself. The same assumption—that the problem\ncould be solved when particular methods of voting discrim­\nination are identified and eliminated—was indulged and\nproved wrong repeatedly prior to the VRA’s enactment.\nUnlike prior statutes, which singled out particular tests or\ndevices, the VRA is grounded in Congress’ recognition of\nthe “variety and persistence” of measures designed to\nimpair minority voting rights. Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at\n311; supra, at 2. In truth, the evolution of voting discrim­\nination into more subtle second-generation barriers is\npowerful evidence that a remedy as effective as preclear­\nance remains vital to protect minority voting rights and\nprevent backsliding.\n   Beyond question, the VRA is no ordinary legislation. It\nis extraordinary because Congress embarked on a mission\nlong delayed and of extraordinary importance: to realize\nthe purpose and promise of the Fifteenth Amendment.\nFor a half century, a concerted effort has been made to\nend racial discrimination in voting. Thanks to the Voting\nRights Act, progress once the subject of a dream has been\nachieved and continues to be made.\n   The record supporting the 2006 reauthorization of\nthe VRA is also extraordinary. It was described by the\nChairman of the House Judiciary Committee as “one of\nthe most extensive considerations of any piece of legisla­\ntion that the United States Congress has dealt with in the\n27½ years” he had served in the House. 152 Cong.

That determination of the body empowered to\nenforce the Civil War Amendments “by appropriate legis­\nlation” merits this Court’s utmost respect.
