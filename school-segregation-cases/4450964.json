The trial court erred by granting summary judgment that the lease\n         terminated because Escondido did not correctly reconcile royalty\n         underpayment. ..............................................................................................33\n         A.        Texas law disfavors lease termination and prohibits termination\n                   absent clear, unequivocal, and unambiguous lease language. ...........33\n         B.        Paragraph XIV does not provide that the lease terminates for a\n                   failure to reconcile underpaid royalties. .............................................37\n                   1.       The lease treats underpayment and nonpayment\n                            differently, with different words in different provisions. ........38\n                   2.       Paragraph XIV terminates for nonpayment of royalties,\n                            not underpayment.....................................................................44\n                   3.       Paragraph XIV does not address remedies for failure to\n                            reconcile underpayment. ..........................................................46\n\n                   4.       In any event, Paragraph XIV cannot support termination\n                            so long as Escondido’s interpretation is reasonable. ...............49\n\n         C.        Independently, termination is improper because Justapor did\n                   not establish Escondido was required to reconcile any\n                   underpayment. ....................................................................................49\n\n\n\n\n                                                             4\n\f             1.       Justapor did not establish any underpayment for\n                      production months February 2012 – January 2013 based\n                      on unambiguous lease terms. ...................................................50\n                      a.       The special pricing provision replaced all pricing\n                               measures, or alternatively was ambiguous. ...................51\n                      b.       The royalty price measure on which Justapor relies\n                               is ambiguous or meaningless. ........................................54\n             2.       Fact issues exist regarding production months November\n                      2011 – January 2012. ...............................................................55\n      D.     Independently, lease termination is improper because it is\n             inequitable on these facts. ..................................................................57\n             1.       It would be inequitable to enforce a termination in light\n                      of Justapor’s conduct. ..............................................................58\n             2.       Forfeiture is inequitable because it would be\n                      disproportionate with the alleged breach. ................................61\n\n             3.       Forfeiture would be inequitable because Jones did not\n                      raise it for 18 months after the alleged termination. ................62\n\n      E.     Remedy: the summary judgment should be reversed in its\n             entirety and partial summary judgment rendered that there was\n             no termination.....................................................................................62\n\nII.   Regardless of whether the lease terminated, Justapor did not\n      conclusively establish Escondido was a bad-faith trespasser.......................63\n\n      A.     Escondido was not a bad-faith trespasser per se because it\n             lawfully entered into possession of the land. .....................................64\n      B.     Justapor also did not conclusively establish that Escondido\n             lacked a good-faith belief in the superiority of its title. .....................67\n\n      C.     Because Escondido was not a bad-faith trespasser, the judgment\n             should be reversed and the case remanded for further\n             proceedings. ........................................................................................69\n\n\n\n\n                                                      5\n\fIII.     The trial court erred by granting summary judgment declaring the\n         parties’ rights and requiring conveyance of Escondido’s leasehold\n         interests regarding the “vacancy tract.” ........................................................71\n         A.        Justapor did not conclusively establish its declaratory judgment\n                   claim. ..................................................................................................72\n                   1.       Justapor did not conclusively establish that the interests\n                            to be conveyed include leasehold interests. .............................73\n                   2.       Unless “mineral interests” and “additional interests”\n                            mean the same thing, the letter agreement is ambiguous. .......75\n                   3.       Justapor did not establish that it had chosen an entity to\n                            which any interests should be conveyed. .................................76\n                   4.       Justapor did not identify any leasehold interest that\n                            should have been, but was not, conveyed. ...............................77\n         B.        Justapor was not entitled to specific performance. ............................77\nConclusion and Prayer ............................................................................................80\nCertificate of Compliance .......................................................................................82\nCertificate of Service ..............................................................................................82\n\nAppendix .................................................................................................................83\n\n\n\n\n                                                              6\n\f                                       INDEX OF AUTHORITIES\n\n\n                                                                                                     Page(s)\n\nCases\nAm.

Joe\n                          Lopez\n\nTrial Court Disposition   Summary judgment in favor of plaintiff, Justapor,\n                          Ranch Company, L.C. In its judgment the trial\n                          court:\n\n                             • Declared that the mineral lease terminated\n                               on March 2, 2012 and that ownership of\n                               minerals reverted to Justapor;\n                             • Awarded more than $12 million from\n                               Escondido to Justapor in trespass damages\n                               consisting of all production proceeds for all\n                               oil-and-gas sales from March 2, 2012 to\n                               August 2014. The judgment did not credit\n                               Escondido for either the costs of production\n                               or for improvements;\n                             • Awarded Justapor all production proceeds\n                               after August 2014 until the date Escondido\n                               relinquishes possession, again with no\n                               deductions for costs or improvements;\n                             • Declared Escondido a bad-faith trespasser\n                               at all times; and\n                             • Ruled that Escondido takes nothing on its\n                               counter claims, which means it receives\n                               nothing for its $33 million in\n                               improvements.\n\n                          CR3:1859-62. The court severed Justapor’s\n                          claims for exemplary or punitive damages (based\n                          on the claim of bad-faith trespass) and its claims\n                          for attorney’s fees, expert witness fees, and\n                          accounting costs. CR3:1897-98. Those claims are\n                          now stayed.\n\n\n\n                                     13\n\f                                 ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n      1.     Lease termination. Did the trial court err in granting Justapor’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment and in denying Escondido’s cross motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment? Specifically, did it err in ruling that the Justapor lease\n\nterminated based on an underpayment of royalties, and in granting the relief that\n\nflowed from that ruling, when:\n\n   • paragraph XIV of the lease did not provide that an underpayment of\n\n      royalties or failure to reconcile an underpayment terminated the lease;\n\n   • Justapor’s claim of termination turns on words in the lease that do not\n\n      support termination or, alternatively, are ambiguous; and\n\n   • equity does not favor termination and forfeiture here?\n\n      2.     Bad-faith trespass. Did the trial court err in declaring Escondido a\n\nbad-faith trespasser as a matter of law when (1) Escondido lawfully exercised its\n\nright to possession when it entered the property, and (2) Escondido presented\n\nevidence that it did not believe the lease terminated, which negates bad faith?\n\n      3.     Vacancy tract. Did the trial court err in rendering summary judgment\n\non Justapor’s declaratory judgment claim? Further, did the trial court err in\n\nawarding specific performance regarding conveyance of interests in the “vacancy\n\ntract?”\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\f                            STATEMENT OF THE FACTS\n\nOverview\n\n      This appeal concerns an oil-and-gas lease between Justapor Ranch\n\nCompany, L.C. (the lessor) and Escondido Resources II, L.L.C. (the lessee).\n\nEscondido spent more than $33 million to drill seven gas wells and to make other\n\ncapital improvements to the property. CR3:1149 (¶5). Escondido paid Justapor\n\nmore than $5.7 million in royalties for the first five years of production. CR3:1148.\n\n      But Justapor stands to profit much more on its legal claims that the lease\n\nterminated in 2012 and that Escondido has been a bad-faith trespasser. The reason?\n\nAs Justapor reads the lease, royalties were underpaid by about $81,000. CR3:1148;\n\nCR1:331-332. And as Justapor reads the lease, any amount of underpayment not\n\nreconciled by March 1 of any year terminates the lease. The trial court agreed,\n\ngranting summary judgment that:\n\n   • the lease terminated on March 2, 2012;\n   • Escondido owes more than $12 million in gross production proceeds from\n     March 2, 2012 through August 2014 with no deduction for Escondido’s\n     costs of production;\n   • Escondido owes all gross production proceeds from August 2014 through\n     the date Escondido relinquishes possession, again with no deductions;\n   • Escondido recovers none of its $33 million in improvements; and\n   • Escondido faces punitive damages in a severed proceeding because the trial\n     court ruled it was a bad-faith trespasser as a matter of law.\n\nCR3:1859-61; 1796-99.\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\fThe parties\n\n      Justapor owns an 803-acre ranch in Webb County. CR3:1325 (¶1). The sole\n\nowner of Justapor is Jimmy Jones. CR3:1022. Jones is a trial lawyer whose\n\npractice includes “land, oil and gas.” CR3:1023.\n\n      In May 2008 Jones contacted Escondido, an oil-and-gas production and\n\ndevelopment company, to ask whether it was interested in leasing mineral interests\n\non the ranch. CR3:1325 (¶2).\n\nLease negotiation and terms\n\n      In early June 2008, when Jones was discussing with Escondido a possible\n\nlease of minerals from Justapor, Jones also offered to represent Escondido as its\n\nattorney in negotiating other oil and gas leases. CR3:1328 (¶¶12-13); CR3:1325-26\n\n(¶¶3-5). Beginning in mid-June, Jones represented Escondido in negotiating two\n\nother leases. CR3:1328 (¶13). As compensation, Escondido agreed to Jones’\n\nrequest to give him an overriding royalty interest on one lease. CR3:1328 (¶14).\n\n      During this same time, Jones also negotiated his own lease, for Justapor,\n\nwith Escondido’s Vice President, David Wrather. CR3:1325 (¶1-2). Escondido was\n\nnot represented by separate counsel in negotiating the Justapor lease, and Jones\n\nnever suggested that his client retain separate counsel. Id. (¶2). Jones drafted both\n\nthe lease and an amendment that the parties signed on the same day, June 24, 2008.\n\nCR3:1325-26. This dispute turns on three sections of the lease and the amendment.\n\n\n                                         16\n\f      1 – Gas-royalty provision and its amendment—Paragraph III(b)\n\n      Jones drafted a gas-royalty provision that appeared verbatim in the ultimate\n\nlease. CR3:982 (¶III(b)); CR3:1231-32 (¶III(b); CR3:1325 (¶3). This paragraph,\n\nIII(b), provided that Escondido shall calculate and pay a 25% royalty on gas from\n\nthe lease based on the highest of four price measures:\n\n      ... Lessee shall calculate and pay royalties to Lessor on One-Fourth\n      (1/4th) of all gas produced from this lease and its constituents and\n      products sold or used therefrom, which royalties shall be calculated\n      and paid to Lessor based upon the highest of (i) the CURRENT\n      MARKET VALUE of such gas production from this lease which is\n      sold by, through or under Lessee or used by, through or under Lessee,\n      (ii) the CURRENT HOUSTON SHIP CHANNEL PRICE for such gas\n      production, as hereinafter defined, or (iii) the CURRENT\n      PROCEEDS REALIZED BY LESSEE for such gas production,\n      without deduction of any costs or expense except as hereinafter\n      stipulated or, (iv) the highest sales price of any gas were gas produced\n      from the property could be present when sold to a third party.\n\nCR3:982 (¶III(b)). The first three pricing measures—CURRENT MARKET\n\nVALUE, CURRENT HOUSTON SHIP CHANNEL PRICE, and CURRENT\n\nPROCEEDS REALIZED BY LESSEE—are further defined in part III(b). Id. But\n\nthe fourth pricing measure—part III(b)(iv)—is not defined in the lease and is not a\n\ncustomary royalty provision. Id.; CR3:1137 (¶2).\n\n      Wrather told Jones that Escondido did not want to base royalty payments on\n\nthe highest of these four price measures, but instead wanted to base the royalty on\n\nthe sale price Escondido had negotiated with a purchaser, Enterprise. CR1325 (¶4).\n\nWhen the parties signed the lease in June 2008, the Enterprise pipeline was the\n\n\n                                        17\n\fonly market readily available to purchase and transport gas from the Justapor\n\nRanch. CR3:1326 (¶5). Wrather sent Jones Enterprise’s purchase terms. Id.;\n\nCR3:1274.\n\n      Jones responded that Justapor would agree to a royalty based on the\n\nEnterprise price, but only for as long as Escondido held the lease and did not\n\nassign it to another party. CR3:1325 (¶4). To accomplish this, Jones proposed a\n\nnon-assignable amendment that (1) would incorporate the pricing terms of\n\nEscondido’s agreement with Enterprise, but (2) would apply only to Escondido,\n\nnot any assignee. Id. The parties ultimately agreed to an amendment “to provide a\n\nspecial royalty pricing provision, based on the Enterprise price.” CR3:1326 (¶4).\n\nJones drafted this amendment. Id. CR3:1325 (¶4).\n\n      This special pricing provision was reflected in the following sentence of the\n\nlease amendment:\n\n      Provided however, Lessee shall have the right to enter into gas sales’\n      contracts that will determine the price upon which gas royalty is\n      calculated if such contracts provide no less than a price\n      redetermination every six months and provide the following minimum\n      terms....\n\nCR3:1015 (minimum terms omitted); CR3:1326 (¶5). But the amendment, as\n\ndrafted by Jones, placed this provision in a paragraph labeled as an amendment to\n\nParagraph III “(b) ii.” CR3:1014-15. It appeared at the end of a long paragraph that\n\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\fdefined “HOUSTON SHIP CHANNEL PRICE” using the same language as the\n\noriginal lease. CR3:1015.\n\n      Escondido understood that the amendment’s special pricing provision was a\n\nsubstitute for all four pricing provisions in Paragraph III(b) of the lease. CR1326\n\n(¶5). But Justapor later took the position that the purpose of the amendment was\n\n“to amend specifically the Houston Ship Channel price to reflect what they were\n\ngetting from Enterprise.” CR3:1036.\n\n      2 – Accounting and adjustment provision—Paragraph III(g)\n\n      Oil-and-gas producers frequently receive adjusted information from\n\npurchasers that changes the volume and price on which a royalty payment was\n\nbased, often months after the royalty was paid. CR3:1149 (¶6). And producers\n\noften make mistakes in royalty calculations or disagree lessors about prices,\n\nvolumes, or methodology used to calculate royalty. CR3:1138 (¶7). Accordingly,\n\nparagraph III(g) of the lease is a lengthy clause that addresses a number of subjects\n\nrelating to discrepancies in royalty payments, such as accounting for royalties,\n\nnotice and disputes over royalty deductions, adjustments for overpayment of\n\nroyalty, and adjustments for underpayment. CR3:987-98 (III(g)). Several aspects\n\nof this clause are relevant.\n\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\f      Accounting—Escondido was required to provide Justapor with a detailed\n\naccounting of specific aspects of the royalty calculation on a monthly basis.\n\nCR3:987 (III(g)).\n\n      Overpayment—Paragraph III(g) also addressed how the parties would\n\nreconcile overpayment of royalty:\n\n      If it is agreed by Lessor or the royalty owner in question that a royalty\n      owner was overpaid, then the overpaid royalty owner has the option of\n      repaying such overpayment or allowing Lessee to recoup such\n      overpayment out of future royalty payments on a schedule and in\n      monthly amounts agreed to by such overpaid royalty owner and\n      Lessee. Any overpaid royalty owner shall not be charged interest on\n      overpaid sums.\n\nCR3:987-88 (III(g)).\n\n      Underpayment—Paragraph III(g) also addressed how the parties would\n\nreconcile underpayment of royalty:\n\n      In the event the prices and/or volumes used by Lessee in calculating\n      and payment of production royalties paid to Lessor was less than\n      those required to be paid, Lessee shall issue its check to make up the\n      difference on or before March 1st of each year.\n\nId. Justapor has conceded that no language in paragraph III(g) says the failure to\n\nreconcile underpayment by March 1 terminates the lease. CR3:1043:18-22.\n\n      Escondido reviewed prices and volumes on a monthly basis. CR3:1117:24-\n\n1118:14. Over the life of the lease, Escondido made 15 reconciliation payments to\n\nJustapor, which totaled more than $441,000. CR3:1149 (¶8).\n\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\f      3 – Nonpayment provision—Paragraph XIV\n\n      Paragraph XIV of the lease addressed the nonpayment of royalties.\n\nCR3:996-97. The following is the relevant part of this paragraph, with the key\n\ndisputed language in bold:\n\n      Royalties payable to Lessor in the manner hereinabove provided\n      for are due and payable to Lessor within a period of sixty (60)\n      days following each month’s production of oil or gas produced\n      and sold from the premises. Thereafter, such payments shall be\n      delinquent and will bear interest at the rate of Ten (10%) percent per\n      annum, compounded monthly, until paid. In the event that such\n      royalties are not paid and become delinquent, and there is no title\n      dispute or title defect, this lease shall terminate ipso facto on the\n      date that such royalties were due and not paid. In the event such\n      royalties are not paid and become delinquent, Lessor without other\n      notice than this paragraph, shall be authorized to file suit in the\n      District Court of Webb County, Texas, for recovery of such\n      delinquent royalties....\n\nCR3:996-97 (¶XIV) (bold added, underlining in original).\n\n      Justapor has conceded that Escondido never failed to pay monthly royalties\n\nwithin 60 days following monthly production, as Article XIV requires.\n\nCR3:1041:17-1042:3. Instead, it claims that some royalties were paid in the wrong\n\namount. Id.\n\n      While Jones and Wrather were negotiating the Justapor lease, Jones told\n\nWrather that he had drafted a “tough agreement” in case Escondido ever assigned\n\nits rights under the Lease Agreement to another party. CR3:1329 (¶17). But Jones\n\ntold Wrather that he would work out with Escondido any issues that might arise\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\fbetween them. Id. Based on that conversation and the fact that Jones was\n\nEscondido’s attorney in other matters, Wrather believed the parties would\n\namicably resolve any differences. CR3:1329. Jones never mentioned that he\n\nbelieved the termination provision meant that the lease could terminate for\n\nunderpayment of royalties, no matter how small. CR3:1329 (¶17).\n\nEscondido drilled wells, made site improvements, and paid royalties\n\n      After the lease was signed, Escondido made more than $33.1 million in\n\nimprovements to the Justapor Ranch. CR3:1149 (¶5); CR3:1112:24-1113:11.\n\nThese included roads and ponds as well as seven wells. CR3:1113:10-16. Of this\n\namount, about $10 million was spent on drilling costs and other improvements\n\nafter March 2, 2012, the date on which Justapor claims the lease terminated.\n\nCR3:1220-21.\n\n      To transport gas from Justapor Ranch to Enterprise, Escondido built a meter\n\nsite and a pipeline across the ranch to connect with the Enterprise pipeline system.\n\nCR3:1326 (¶6). To facilitate this, Escondido and Justapor signed a Surface Site\n\nAgreement, which Escondido then assigned to Enterprise. Id.; CR3:1282-88.\n\n      Escondido first paid royalties in June 2009. CR3:1148 (¶3). In 2011\n\nEnterprise reduced the amount of gas it purchased from Escondido because of\n\ncapacity constraints on its pipeline system. CR3:1326 (¶7). To make up for the\n\n\n\n\n                                        22\n\freduction in sales to Enterprise, Escondido sold gas from the Justapor Ranch to\n\nKinder Morgan. Id.\n\n      From its first production in June 2009 until April 2014, Escondido paid\n\nJustapor more than $5.7 million in royalties. CR3:1148 (¶3). Justapor has not\n\ndisputed the amount of royalties that were paid for production occurring before\n\nOctober 2011. See CR3:330-31.\n\nJones first claims that the lease terminated\n\n      Before the current dispute arose, Justapor claimed that the lease terminated\n\non another ground.\n\n      In June 2011, Jones told Escondido that the lease had terminated “ipso\n\nfacto” when Escondido purportedly underpaid a compensatory royalty under article\n\nV of the lease. CR3:1070:5-1071:11; CR3:1072:11-1074:17. But Jones later\n\nadmitted that the lease did not terminate as the result of an underpayment.\n\nCR3:1073:3-1074:13. The parties ultimately resolved their disagreement over the\n\ncompensatory royalty by letter agreement dated August 9, 2011. CR1:445-48;\n\nCR3:1308-11.\n\n      As part of this letter agreement, Escondido agreed to convey, to an entity of\n\nJustapor’s choice, certain interests in a 42-acre tract known as the “vacancy tract.”\n\nCR3:977. Two different versions, both initialed and signed on the same date, use\n\ndifferent words to memorialize the parties’ agreement. One version requires\n\n\n                                         23\n\fEscondido to convey mineral interests it already has acquired in the Justapor\n\nRanch “as well as all other mineral mineral [sic] interests [Escondido] acquire[s]\n\nin this land after [Justapor’s] approval & consent.” CR3:1310 (emphasis added).\n\nThe other version requires Escondido to convey mineral interests it already has\n\nacquired in the Justapor Ranch “as well as all other additional interests we acquire\n\nin this land after your approval and consent.” CR1:447 (emphasis added).\n\nEscondido gave Jones executed deeds conveying all mineral interests owned or\n\nsubsequently acquired by Escondido in the Vacancy Tract. CR3:1327-28 (¶11).\n\nJustapor later asserted that Escondido must convey not only mineral interests\n\nacquired in Justapor Ranch, but also all leasehold interests. CR1:255.\n\nJones’ actions prevent Escondido’s sales to Enterprise\n\n      In October 2011 Enterprise announced it would resume purchasing gas from\n\nthe Justapor Ranch because its capacity constraints had lifted. CR3:1326 (¶8). But\n\nin the same month, Jones sent Enterprise a letter announcing that the Enterprise\n\nsales meter Surface Site Agreement between Justapor and Enterprise terminated\n\nbecause Enterprise missed one $4,500 yearly lease payment in May. CR3:1299,\n\n1326 (¶8), 1092:5-11, CR3:1282. Jones also told Enterprise that it could not use\n\nthe meter and that he was going to seize its equipment. CR3:1092:7-19. The\n\nSurface Site Agreement did not provide for automatic termination upon default,\n\nbut instead provided that Justapor must give notice and an opportunity to correct\n\n\n                                        24\n\fthe late payment before the lease terminated. RR3:1284 (¶15). Justapor gave no\n\nnotice and no opportunity to cure, and refused to accept Enterprise’s late rental\n\ncheck. RR3:1054:17-1059:13. As a result of Jones’ claim of termination,\n\nEnterprise could not purchase gas from the Justapor Ranch. CR3:1326-27 (¶8).\n\n      Unable to sell to Enterprise, Escondido could only sell to Kinder Morgan at\n\na lower daily spot price or shut in the wells until it found a purchaser for a higher\n\nprice. CR1:341:5-13; CR3:1327 (¶9). It began negotiating sales to other higher-\n\npriced markets in order to sell several months later. Id. In the meantime, rather than\n\nsell to Kinder Morgan at the lower daily spot price, Escondido proposed to shut-in\n\nthe wells until it could finalize these higher-price deals or secure a new surface-site\n\nagreement between Jones and Enterprise. CR3:1326-27 (¶¶8-9). Escondido also\n\ntold Jones that the price to be realized from the sale of gas at the daily spot price\n\nwould be lower. Id. (¶9). But Jones insisted that Escondido sell gas at the lower\n\ndaily spot price and not shut-in the wells for any time. Id.\n\n      Escondido made sales at the lower daily spot price for three months\n\nbeginning in October 2011, which resulted in royalties to Justapor that were $3,851\n\nless than the Enterprise special pricing provision set out in the amendment.\n\nCR1:340:13-23; CR3:1148 (¶4). It has not made up this $3,851 underpayment\n\nbecause Justapor caused it to receive a lower price and because Jones verbally\n\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\fagreed to the royalty he was going to get based on the lower daily spot price.\n\nCR1:340:20-341:20; CR3:1089:13-20.\n\n      Dispute over royalties for production months after January 2012\n\n      In May 2013, Justapor hired Charlie Graham to audit Escondido’s records\n\nregarding the calculation of royalties. CR3:1025:24-1026:18. Graham determined\n\nthat Escondido’s calculations of royalties on a price-received basis were correct.\n\nCR3:1337:8-19; 1338:8-24. Graham did not audit the royalty calculations on other\n\nbases, such as market value or the Houston Ship Channel price. CR3:1336:6-17.\n\nGraham believed that Escondido was trying to properly calculate the quantity and\n\nprice of gas sales. CR3:1339:18-20.\n\n      Justapor sued Escondido in August 2013, claiming the lease had terminated\n\ndue to an underpayment of royalties. CR1:22, and 25. Before suing, Justapor gave\n\nEscondido no notice that it believed Escondido had underpaid gas royalties.\n\nCR3:1044:20-1045:9. And it gave Escondido no opportunity to cure. Id.\n\n      Justapor initially claimed that the lease terminated “as early as April 2012”\n\nbecause royalty payments for production beginning in February, 2012, were based\n\non a weighted average price in breach of pricing provision III(b)(iv). RR3:1304,\n\n1305. Justapor claimed that the lease terminated because of the underpayment\n\nalone. RR3:1304. Justapor later amended its claim to assert, for the first time, that\n\nan underpayment triggered termination if it was not corrected by March 1 of the\n\n\n                                         26\n\ffollowing year. CR1:150. Later, Justapor’s expert identified two periods in which\n\nhe claims Escondido underpaid the royalty:\n\n   • October 2011 – January 2012 production: alleged underpayment of\n     $3,851;\n\n   • February 2012 – January 2013 production: alleged underpayment of\n     $77,107.\n\nCR1:320, 331-32; CR3:1148 (¶4).\n\n      The parties’ experts disagree over whether royalties were underpaid at all\n\nbetween February 2012 and January 2013. If the special pricing provision in the\n\namendment replaced the lease’s royalty price entirely, as Escondido contends, then\n\nEscondido correctly calculated the royalty based on current proceeds. CR1150\n\n(¶11). Justapor presented no summary-judgment evidence of any underpayment\n\nbased on that measure. But if the special pricing provision in the lease amendment\n\nreplaced only the Houston Ship Channel Price, as Justapor contends, then the\n\namount of these underpayments was disputed by two experts. According to\n\nJustapor’s expert, the amount of underpayment would be $77,107. CR1:331;\n\nCR3:1148 (¶4). But according to Escondido’s expert, even assuming Justapor’s\n\ninterpretation of the contract, the correct amount of underpayment would be\n\n$22,107. Id. (¶¶11, 13).\n\n\n\n\n                                       27\n\fSummary judgment proceedings and final judgment\n\n      Justapor and Escondido filed cross motions for summary judgment on the\n\nissue of whether the lease had terminated. The trial court denied Escondido’s\n\nmotion, granted Justapor’s motion, and signed a final judgment in Justapor’s favor.\n\nCR3:1796-99; 1857-62. The court ruled that the lease terminated on March 2, 2012\n\nand that all of Escondido’s interests under the lease reverted to Justapor at that\n\ntime. CR3:1859.\n\n      The court declared Escondido a bad-faith trespasser and that it has never\n\nbeen a good-faith trespasser. CR3:1859. As a result of that ruling, the court\n\nawarded not only an accounting of all underpaid royalties, but also awarded\n\nJustapor all of Escondido’s post-March 2, 2012 production proceeds, with no\n\ndeduction for expenses. CR3:1861. The amount awarded through August 31, 2014\n\nwas more than $12 million, with an unspecified award of all additional production\n\nproceeds from that date through the date Escondido relinquishes possession. Id.\n\nThe court dismissed Escondido’s counterclaims, including its claims for\n\nreimbursement based on Escondido’s improvements to the property. CR3:1860;\n\nCR1:142-43. The court severed Justapor’s claims to recover punitive damages and\n\nattorney’s fees based on this judgment. CR3:1897-1900.\n\n      Justapor also moved for summary judgment on its claim for declaratory\n\njudgment, asking the court to interpret the letter agreement as requiring Escondido\n\n\n                                        28\n\fto convey both “mineral and leasehold” interests acquired by Escondido in\n\nJustapor Ranch. CR1:155 (¶34), 254-55. The trial court granted summary judgment\n\ndeclaring that the letter agreement requires conveyance of both mineral and\n\nleasehold interests acquired by Escondido in the Justapor Ranch. CR3:1797. In\n\naddition, the trial court awarded specific performance requiring Escondido to\n\nconvey these interests to Justapor on or before the date the judgment becomes final\n\nand non-appealable. CR3:1858-59.\n\n\n\n\n                                        29\n\f                             SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      Termination and forfeiture. Texas law requires a heightened level of\n\nclarity in lease language before an automatic-termination clause can legally kill a\n\nlease. The point is to disfavor forfeiture of a lessee’s rights unless the lessor makes\n\nexplicit that draconian intent. Under Texas law, an enforceable termination clause\n\nmust be clear, unequivocal, and unambiguous.\n\n      The termination clause in this lease fails that test. Paragraph XIV does not\n\nprovide that a payment pennies less than owed divests the lessee of its rights,\n\nconverts its capital investments, and threatens punitive damages. Rather, it\n\nterminates only for nonpayment of monthly royalties. It specifically addresses\n\ninstances in which the lessor goes to the mail, only to find no monthly check. It\n\nsays that the lease will terminate if “such royalties are not paid.…”\n\n      Paragraph III(g) is the remedy for payments made that are less than owed—\n\npayments that are “less than those required to be paid.” Nothing in that paragraph\n\neven hints at the capital punishment Justapor seeks. The nonpayment paragraph\n\nprovides for termination; the underpayment paragraph does not.\n\n      The trial court’s ruling that the lease terminated based on underpayment of\n\nroyalties violates basic rules governing lease termination and forfeiture provisions.\n\nIt blurs the line in the oil-and-gas industry that distinguishes royalty nonpayment\n\nfrom underpayment. Because the trial court’s core legal ruling is wrong, Justapor’s\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\fjudgment must be reversed. And Escondido is entitled to summary judgment that\n\nthe lease survives.\n\n      Bad faith. Even if the lease had terminated as a matter of law, the trial court\n\nwrongly concluded that Escondido was a bad-faith trespasser as a matter of law.\n\nEscondido entered into possession of the land under the Justapor lease before any\n\nadverse claim and long before Jones embarked on his windfall-litigation strategy.\n\nEscondido did not believe the lease terminated—for good reason that should\n\nsurvive even an affirmance of the trial court’s core holding. Bad faith is inherently\n\na fact question for a jury. The evidence here could not conclusively establish that\n\nEscondido was a bad-faith trespasser.\n\n      Vacancy tract conveyance. The trial court also erred by granting summary\n\njudgment on Justapor’s declaratory judgment claim regarding the vacancy tract,\n\nbecause the parties’ letter agreement unambiguously requires Escondido to convey\n\nonly mineral interests, not leasehold interests.\n\n      Appellate courts exist for cases like this.\n\n\n\n\n                                          31\n\f                                    ARGUMENT\n\nStandard of Review\n\n      “When both parties move for summary judgment, each party must carry its\n\nown burden, and neither can prevail because of the failure of the other to discharge\n\nits burden.” Williams Consol. I, Ltd./BSI Holdings, Inc. v. TIG Ins. Co., 230\n\nS.W.3d 895, 900 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, no pet.). “Because each\n\nparty was a movant, the burden for each was the same: to establish entitlement to a\n\nsummary judgment by conclusively proving all elements of the claim or defense as\n\na matter of law.” Id. Thus, the questions presented by the standard of review are:\n\n   • Issue 1: Termination: Did the lease terminate as a matter of law? Or did the\n\n      evidence conclusively establish that it did not terminate?\n\n   • Issue 2: Bad faith: Did the summary-judgment evidence conclusively\n\n      establish Escondido was a bad-faith trespasser?\n\n   • Issue 3: Vacancy tract: Did Justapor conclusively establish its\n\n      interpretation of the letter agreement or its (unpleaded) right to specific\n\n      performance?\n\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\fI.    The trial court erred by granting summary judgment that the lease\n      terminated because Escondido did not correctly reconcile royalty\n      underpayment.\n\n      This is not an ordinary contract construction case. Under Texas law, lease\n\nlanguage must meet a heightened level of clarity and plain language in order to\n\nprovide for automatic termination. If the conditions for termination are not clear,\n\nunequivocal, and unambiguous, the lease will not terminate. Nor will termination\n\nbe enforced if forfeiture would be inequitable.\n\n      The trial court erred in granting summary judgment that the lease\n\nterminated, and it erred in denying Escondido’s cross-motion for partial summary\n\njudgment that it did not terminate, for three independent reasons:\n\n      (1) the lease did not clearly, unequivocally, and unambiguously provide for\n\n      termination based on failure to reconcile underpayment of royalty;\n\n      (2) Justapor did not conclusively establish that Escondido failed to correctly\n\n      reconcile any underpayment of royalty; and\n\n      (3) termination and forfeiture are impermissible under Texas law because\n\n      they would be inequitable on these facts.\n\n      A.     Texas law disfavors lease termination and prohibits termination\n             absent clear, unequivocal, and unambiguous lease language.\n\n      The automatic termination of a lease or other contract is a forfeiture. Walker\n\nv. Fed. Kemper Life Assurance Co., 828 S.W.2d 442, 446 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 1992, writ denied); Guleke v. Humble Oil & Ref. Co., 126 S.W.2d 38, 40\n\n\n                                         33\n\f(Tex. Civ. App.—Amarillo 1939, no writ). The forfeiture sought by Justapor is\n\ndisproportionately large. Under Justapor’s reading of the contract, Escondido’s\n\nfailure to correct any underpayments, no matter how small, causes Escondido to\n\nforfeit its rights and lose its investment of more than $33 million in this lease,\n\nsubjects it to trespass damages in excess of $12 million, and exposes it to punitive\n\ndamages.\n\n      Texas law disfavors lease forfeiture. XTO Energy, Inc. v. Pennebaker, 07-\n\n10-00396-CV, 2011 WL 6846196, at *3 (Tex. App.—Amarillo Dec. 29, 2011, no\n\npet.) (mem. op.). “Forfeitures are not favored in Texas, and contracts are construed\n\nto avoid them.” Aquaplex, Inc. v. Rancho La Valencia, Inc., 297 S.W.3d 768, 774\n\n(Tex. 2009). In general, “[f]orfeiture is a harsh and punitive remedy, and it is not\n\nfavored in law or equity.” Outdoor Sys., Inc. v. BBE, L.L.C., 105 S.W.3d 66, 70\n\n(Tex. App.—Eastland 2003, pet. denied). And specifically with regard to the claim\n\nhere, Texas law applies a rule of strict construction to “forfeiture provisions based\n\non failure to make proper and timely payment of royalty.” Vinson Minerals, Ltd. v.\n\nXTO Energy, Inc., 335 S.W.3d 344, 354 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2010, pet.\n\ndenied) (quoting Patrick H. Martin & Bruce M. Kramer, 3 Williams & Meyers, Oil\n\nand Gas Law § 656.2 (2008)).\n\n\n\n\n                                         34\n\f      So unlike an ordinary contract dispute, special rules of construction—\n\napplying a heightened standard—apply to lease forfeitures. These principles\n\ninclude the following:\n\n      1. All doubts resolved against forfeiture. “Texas courts will not construe a\n\ncontract to result in a forfeiture unless it cannot be construed in any other way.”\n\nKirby Lake Dev., Ltd. v. Clear Lake City Water Auth., 320 S.W.3d 829, 841-42\n\n(Tex. 2010) (quoting REO Indus., Inc. v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of Am., 932\n\nF.2d 447, 454 (5th Cir.1991). Thus, “If the terms of a contract are fairly susceptible\n\nof an interpretation which will prevent a forfeiture, they will be so construed.”\n\nHenshaw v. Tex. Natural Res. Found., 147 Tex. 436, 444, 216 S.W.2d 566, 570\n\n(1949). This rule has been applied specifically to oil-and-gas leases. If a “lease\n\ncontract is susceptible of two reasonable interpretations, it should be construed as\n\nto prevent a forfeiture.” Vinson Minerals, 335 S.W.3d at 354 (citing Ryan v. Kent,\n\n36 S.W.2d 1007, 1011 (Tex. Comm’n App. 1931, judgm’t adopted)).\n\n      2. Clear and unequivocal language required. The right to forfeiture may\n\nbe found only in language that is plain, clear, and unequivocal. Outdoor Sys., 105\n\nS.W.3d at 71. The cause of forfeiture must be “plainly and clearly stated,” and “the\n\ntime definitely fixed.” Id. (quoting 41 Tex. Jur. 3d Forfeitures and Penalties § 6\n\n(1998)). As the Supreme Court of Texas has recognized:\n\n      The authority to forfeit a vested right or estate should not rest in\n      provisions whose meaning is uncertain and obscure. It should be\n\n                                         35\n\f      found only in language which is plain and clear—whose unequivocal\n      character may render its exercise fair and rightful.\n\nW.T. Waggoner Estate v. Sigler Oil Co., 118 Tex. 509, 522, 19 S.W.2d 27, 31\n\n(1929) (quoting Decker v. Kirlicks, 110 Tex. 90, 94, 216 S.W. 385, 386 (1919)).\n\n      When the contractual termination provision is not clear, forfeiture is\n\nforbidden. See, e.g., Benavides v. Hunt, 79 Tex. 383, 392, 15 S.W. 396, 399 (1891)\n\n(holding that termination could not be based on a condition requiring lessee “to use\n\nall economy in the conduct and management of said mining enterprise” because\n\nthat language is “too uncertain to recognize as a condition on which a forfeiture\n\nmight rest.”).\n\n      3. Forfeiture cannot result from an ambiguous provision. It follows from\n\nthe two previous rules that, “[i]f the provision is ambiguous, that alone condemns it\n\nas a forfeiture provision.” Decker v. Kirlicks, 110 Tex. 90, 94, 216 S.W. 385, 386\n\n(Tex. 1919). Forfeiture cannot be based on the breach of an ambiguous provision.\n\n“[I]f there is any uncertainty in the language [of a mineral lease] so as to make it\n\nambiguous or of doubtful meaning,” a request for forfeiture should be denied.\n\nKnight v. Chicago Corp., 188 S.W.2d 564, 566 (Tex. 1945) (emphasis added).\n\n      Given the gravity of terminating a contract, this rule makes sense:\n\n      A forfeiture should rest upon surer ground. Where a contract is so\n      vague in its terms that a court cannot determine its meaning, it would\n      be unjust to enforce a forfeiture under it against one whose only fault\n      has been to possibly mistake its meaning. Forfeitures are harsh and\n      punitive in their operation. They are not favored by the law, and ought\n\n\n                                         36\n\f      not to be. The authority to forfeit a vested right or estate should not\n      rest in provisions whose meaning is uncertain and obscure.\n\nDecker, 110 Tex. at 94, 216 S.W. at 386.\n\n      4. Consider general customs and practices. In construing forfeiture\n\nprovisions in lease contracts, courts will take into consideration general customs\n\nand practices, as well as the law affecting the matters contracted about, and will\n\npresume that the parties contracted with such customs, practices, and laws in mind,\n\nunless the contrary clearly appears from the terms of the contract. Gulf Prod. Co. v.\n\nCruse, 271 S.W. 886, 886-87 (Tex. Comm’n App. 1925).\n\n      5. No forfeiture if inequitable. Ordinarily, Texas courts resolve issues of\n\nconstruction without reference to equity. But forfeiture lies at the intersection of\n\nlaw and equity, and courts consider the equities of an asserted forfeiture.\n\n“Although parties may contract to provide for forfeiture upon default, where\n\nequities are shown which justify a continuation of the contract rather than\n\nforfeiture of it, the forfeiture will be prevented.” T-Anchor Corp. v. Travarillo\n\nAssocs., 529 S.W.2d 622, 627 (Tex. Civ. App.—Amarillo 1975, no writ) (citing\n\nauthorities and holding that equities prevented forfeiture).\n\n      B.     Paragraph XIV does not provide that the lease terminates for a\n             failure to reconcile underpaid royalties.\n\n      Paragraph XIV of the lease does not clearly, unequivocally, and\n\nunambiguously provide for termination based on either an underpayment of\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\froyalties or a failure to reconcile underpayment. Instead, it addresses only\n\nnonpayment of monthly royalties. In this particular lease, nonpayment and\n\nunderpayment are treated separately and differently—(1) addressed in separate\n\nprovisions, (2) referred to with different terminology, (3) and dealt with under\n\ndifferent procedures, timelines, and consequences. The plain language of\n\nparagraph XIV addresses only nonpayment of royalties. No part of paragraph XIV\n\nrefers in any way to underpayment, the underpayment provision, or a failure to\n\nreconcile underpayment.\n\n             1.     The lease treats underpayment and nonpayment differently,\n                    with different words in different provisions.\n\n      To construe a contract, Texas courts “examine and consider the entire\n\nwriting in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all the provisions of the\n\ncontract so that none will be rendered meaningless.” Italian Cowboy Partners, Ltd.\n\nv. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 341 S.W.3d 323, 333 (Tex. 2011). The beginning of\n\nthis analysis is “the contract’s express language.” Id.\n\n      This lease contains two separate provisions with different procedures for (1)\n\nadjustments of past royalty payments including overpayment and underpayment,\n\nand (2) nonpayment. The key language of these provisions is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\fIII(g)—royalty adjustments, overpayment,               XIV—nonpayment\n           and underpayment                      CR3:996-97 (¶XIV) (bold emphasis\n   CR3:987-88 (¶III(g)) (emphasis added)                     added).\n\n“In accounting to Lessor for royalties payable“Royalties payable to Lessor in the\nhereunder, Lessee shall be required, on a     manner hereinabove provided for\nmonthly basis, if requested by Lessor, to     are due and payable to Lessor\naccount to Lessor for each well on leased     within a period of sixty (60) days\npremises based upon the volume of             following each month’s production\nproduction…the BTU…content of such            of oil or gas produced and sold from\nproduction, the royalty interest in such      the premises. Thereafter, such\nproduction and the amount owed and paid to    payments shall be delinquent and will\nsuch royalty interest owner.…”                bear interest at the rate of Ten (10%)\n                                              percent per annum, compounded\n “If it is agreed by Lessor or the royalty    monthly, until paid. In the event that\nowner in question that a royalty owner was    such royalties are not paid and\noverpaid, then the overpaid royalty owner has become delinquent, and there is no\nthe option of repaying such overpayment or    title dispute or title defect, this lease\nallowing Lessee to recoup such overpayment shall terminate ipso facto on the\nout of future royalty payments on a schedule date that such royalties were due\nand in monthly amounts agreed to by such      and not paid. In the event such\noverpaid royalty owner and Lessee.”           royalties are not paid and become\n                                              delinquent, Lessor without other\n “In the event the prices and/or volumes      notice than this paragraph, shall be\nused by Lessee in calculating and payment authorized to file suit in the District\nof production royalties paid to Lessor was Court of Webb County, Texas, for\nless than those required to be paid, Lessee recovery of such delinquent\nshall issue its check to make up the          royalties.…”\n                                     st\ndifference on or before March 1 of each\nyear.”\n\n        Several differences between paragraphs III(g) and XIV demonstrate that\n\n these paragraphs address distinct subjects and have different effects.\n\n        a. The provisions use different words. The discussion of underpayment in\n\n III(g) refers to an amount of payment: “payment of production royalties paid to\n\n Lessor” that are “less than those required to be paid.” And other parts of paragraph\n\n                                          39\n\fIII(g) refer to adjustments to past royalty amounts for deductions, overpayment,\n\nand underpayment. In contrast paragraph XIV expressly refers to a failure to pay\n\nmonthly royalties on time: “such royalties are not paid and become delinquent.”\n\nCR3:996 (¶XIV).\n\n      The use of different phrasing is consistent with industry custom and usage.\n\nThe oil-and-gas industry does not equate an underpayment of royalty with a\n\nnonpayment. CR3:1137 (¶3). Nor does the industry consider neglecting to\n\nreconcile a prior underpayment as failing to make a payment at all. Id.\n\n      b. The provisions address different concepts. Just as the oil-and-gas\n\nindustry differentiates royalty nonpayment from royalty underpayment, CR1:1137\n\n(¶3), so does this lease.\n\n      Paragraph III(g)—including parts not quoted above—addresses topics all\n\nrelating to adjustments to royalties. These topics include accounting, deductions,\n\nwithholding of taxes, reconciliation of overpayment, and reconciliation of\n\nunderpayment (“on or before March 1st of each year”). These detailed adjustment\n\nprovisions exist because gas purchasers frequently send the producer adjusted data\n\nabout volume or price many months after the royalty is paid, thus requiring a\n\nroyalty adjustment. CR3:1149 (¶6).\n\n      In contrast, paragraph XIV applies only to the deadline for monthly royalty\n\npayments (“sixty (60) days following each month’s production”), and the\n\n\n                                        40\n\fconsequences of nonpayment. The first sentence provides when monthly royalties\n\nare due—providing a different due date than reconciliation payments (60 days vs.\n\nMarch 1st). CR3:996-97 (¶XIV). The second sentence addresses late-payment\n\ninterest for monthly royalties that are not paid—not reconciliation payments for\n\nunderpaid royalties. The third sentence addresses termination when “such\n\nroyalties” are not paid within 60 days. Id. And the final sentence authorizes a\n\nparticular venue for suit to recover “such royalties [that] are not paid.” Id.\n\n      Each sentence in paragraph XIV addresses only monthly royalty\n\nnonpayment—the failure to meet the 60-day deadline. But here, monthly royalty\n\nnonpayment is not at issue. Justapor admitted that Escondido always paid monthly\n\nroyalties within 60 days. CR3:1041:17-1042:3. Rather, because Justapor seeks to\n\nrecover for alleged underpayment of royalties, paragraph III(g) applies. It\n\naddresses royalty adjustments and reconciliation of underpayment.\n\n      c. The      provisions have       different, inconsistent      procedures   for\n\nunderpayment and nonpayment. These two provisions provide separate paths for\n\n(1) underpayment and adjustments, versus (2) nonpayment.\n\n      If Escondido underpays by using the incorrect price or volume, the\n\nconsequence is not termination but instead the covenant that Escondido will make\n\na reconciliation payment by March 1 of the following year. CR3:987-88 (¶III(g)).\n\nParagraph III(g) does not specify a remedy, termination or otherwise, for a breach\n\n\n                                          41\n\fof that covenant, leaving available an ordinary action for breach of contract and\n\ndamages. See Rogers v. Ricane Enters., Inc., 772 S.W.2d 76, 79 (Tex. 1989).\n\n      Unlike paragraph III(g), paragraph XIV does not provide a grace period until\n\nthe following March 1. Instead, it provides that the failure to meet the 60-day\n\ndeadline for monthly payment of royalties allows a series of immediate remedies:\n\n(1) termination “on the date that such royalties were due and not paid,” (2)\n\nimmediate accrual of 10% interest, and (3) the immediate right to sue “without\n\nother notice than this paragraph.” CR3:996-97 (¶XIV).\n\n      It would be inconsistent with the lease’s plain language to treat a breach of\n\nparagraph III(g) as a trigger for termination under paragraph XIV. Paragraph III(g)\n\nprovides a grace period to make up underpayment and provides no express\n\nremedies for a failure to make up underpayment above and beyond contract law. In\n\ncontrast, Paragraph XIV provides immediate and severe consequences, which\n\nmakes sense for nonpayment but not for a royalty payment that often later requires\n\nadjustment. The two provisions in completely different parts of this contract do not\n\naddress the same subject.\n\n      d.    Unlike the long process for adjusting underpayment, the remedy\n\nof “ipso facto” termination is immediate and based on an instance that shows\n\nan obvious breach. Under paragraph XIV “ipso facto” termination occurs\n\nimmediately. CR3:996-97 (¶XIV). Unless the event triggering termination would\n\n\n                                        42\n\fbe immediate and obvious, parties would have no marker to know that their legal\n\nrelationship has automatically changed.\n\n      Nonpayment of royalties within 60 days is exactly the sort of event that\n\nwould be instantaneously obvious to the parties so that they know termination has\n\noccurred.\n\n      In contrast, an underpayment or failure to reconcile an underpayment is not\n\nan immediately apparent breach and therefore cannot result in an instant lease\n\ntermination. If paragraph XIV applied to underpayment or the failure to make a\n\nreconciliation payment by March 1, the lease could easily terminate without either\n\nparty knowing. But oil-and-gas producers frequently receive information from\n\npurchasers many months later that affect the volume or price on which the payment\n\nwas made. CR3:1149 (¶6). Under Justapor’s interpretation, if such information\n\nwere received about a December royalty payment in the following April, for\n\ninstance, the lease would have terminated on March 2 without either party’s\n\nknowledge. That interpretation is not what the contract says and is not reasonable.\n\n      An ipso facto termination provision provides a bright line that allows both\n\nparties to know the lease has immediately terminated and to adjust their conduct\n\naccordingly. Here, Justapor first claimed termination 20 months after the initial\n\nunderpayment and 18 months after the March 1 deadline for reconciliation\n\npayments. CR1:22; CR3:1044:20-1045:9. Such a strained interpretation would\n\n\n                                          43\n\fpermit no-fault terminations that a producer who has invested more than $33\n\nmillion in the lease has no ability to correct. It makes no sense to apply the ipso\n\nfacto termination language to underpayment or the failure to timely reconcile\n\nunderpayment.\n\n            2.     Paragraph XIV terminates for nonpayment of royalties, not\n                   underpayment.\n\n      Justapor initially asserted that the lease terminated ipso facto under\n\nparagraph XIV when Escondido first made an underpayment. CR3:1304, 1307. But\n\nJustapor later adjusted its interpretation, conceding that the lease does not\n\nterminate   immediately    upon    any    underpayment.    CR3:1027:18-1028:12;\n\nCR3:1073:3-1074:13. Instead, Justapor now says that Escondido’s failure to\n\nreconcile underpaid royalties by March 1 of the following year results in\n\ntermination. CR1:248-49; CR3:1027:18-1028:12; CR3:1073:3-1074:13.\n\n      The plain language of paragraph XIV has nothing to do with underpayment\n\nat all—whether an underpayment by itself or a failure to reconcile an\n\nunderpayment. Instead, Paragraph XIV provides for termination when “such\n\nroyalties”—the monthly royalties due in 60 days discussed throughout the\n\nparagraph—“are not paid and become delinquent.” CR3:996-97 (¶XIV) (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n      Nothing in this paragraph refers back to the underpayment of royalties,\n\nwhich is addressed separately in paragraph III(g). Under the express terms of\n\n\n                                         44\n\fIII(g), underpayment must be rectified by the March 1 deadline rather than a 60-\n\nday deadline. CR3:988 (¶III(g)). The lease does not even use the same language in\n\nparagraph XIV (“delinquent payments”) that it uses to describe underpayment in\n\nparagraph III(g) (“royalties paid ... less than those required to be paid”). Compare\n\nCR3:988 (¶III(g)) with CR3:996-97 (¶XIV). Instead, the only thing that triggers\n\ntermination is nonpayment—which occurs immediately when the monthly\n\nroyalties due in 60 days “are not paid and become delinquent.” CR3:996-97\n\n(¶XIV).\n\n      If the lease were to terminate upon the date of any underpayment, the March\n\n1 reconciliation deadline would be meaningless. A violation of paragraph XIV\n\nresults in immediate termination, immediate accrual of interest, and immediate\n\nauthorization to sue. CR3:996-97 (¶XIV). If those consequences also apply at the\n\nmoment Escondido makes any underpayment, then it would be meaningless to\n\nprovide a reconciliation procedure and a March 1 deadline for reconciliation\n\npayments. A court should “give effect to all contract provisions, and render none\n\nmeaningless.” King v. Dall. Fire Ins. Co., 85 S.W.3d 185, 193 (Tex. 2002).\n\n      The parties did not draft the lease to terminate immediately upon\n\nunderpayment. Paragraph XIV does not provide for termination based on royalties\n\n“not paid in whole or in part.” It does not provide for termination based on\n\nroyalties “paid less than those required to be paid.” And it does not provide for\n\n\n                                        45\n\ftermination based on nonpayment “of any amounts due to the Lessor hereunder.”\n\nCf. Outdoor Sys., 105 S.W.3d at 69. The parties did not use the sort of language\n\nnecessary to specify clearly and plainly that the lease terminates in the event of an\n\nunderpayment.\n\n             3.    Paragraph XIV does not address remedies for failure to\n                   reconcile underpayment.\n\n      Justapor’s new interpretation, advanced in its summary-judgment motion,\n\nwas that paragraph XIV is triggered by Escondido’s failure to make March 1\n\nreconciliation payments. That interpretation is unreasonable for a number of\n\nreasons.\n\n      First, it has no support in the plain language. No part of paragraph XIV\n\nrefers to reconciliation payments of underpaid royalties or their March 1 deadline.\n\nInstead, the sentence about ipso facto termination uses the phrase “such royalties”\n\nto refer to the monthly royalties due within 60 days under the prior sentences of the\n\nparagraph. CR3:996-97 (¶XIV).\n\n      Second, Justapor’s interpretation also requires adding or implying language\n\nto the lease. Courts “may neither rewrite the parties’ contract nor add to its\n\nlanguage.” Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schaefer, 124 S.W.3d 154, 162 (Tex. 2003).\n\nSpecifically, when construing a lease, a court should not imply “terms in\n\nopposition to the express language that the parties themselves have written into the\n\ncontracts.” Rogers, 772 S.W.2d at 79 (quoting Dallas Power & Light Co. v.\n\n\n                                         46\n\fCleghorn, 623 S.W.2d 310, 311 (Tex. 1981)). And because termination requires\n\nplain and unequivocal language, courts cannot imply grounds for termination that\n\nare not expressly stated in the termination provision. W.T. Waggoner Estate, 118\n\nTex. at 522, 19 S.W.2d at 31.\n\n      Yet Justapor’s interpretation would require that words be added. It would\n\nrequire changing:\n\n      In the event that such royalties are not paid and become delinquent, ...\n      this lease shall terminate ipso facto on the date that such royalties\n      were due and not paid.\n\nto add or imply the following highlighted language to the lease:\n\n      In the event that such royalties are not paid and become delinquent, or\n      in the event that underpayment of royalties are not reconciled by\n      March 1 of the following year under paragraph III(g) of this lease, ...\n      this lease shall terminate ipso facto on the date that such royalties\n      were due and not paid.\n\nThe parties could have written the highlighted language. But it does not appear in\n\nthis lease. Nor should the Court add it or imply it, especially when lease\n\ntermination under Texas law requires clear and unequivocal language.\n\n      Third, Justapor’s interpretation is unreasonable and oppressive. A court\n\nshould avoid an interpretation of a contract that renders it “unreasonable,\n\ninequitable, or oppressive.” Reilly v. Rangers Mgmt., Inc., 727 S.W.2d 527, 530\n\n(Tex. 1987) (cited in Fortis Benefits v. Cantu, 234 S.W.3d 642, 650 n.54 (Tex.\n\n2007) and In re Ford Motor Co., 211 S.W.3d 295, 299 (Tex. 2006)) (per curiam;\n\n\n\n                                        47\n\forig. proceeding). The parties to oil-and-gas leases frequently disagree about the\n\nprices and volumes used in royalty calculations. CR3:1138 (¶7). New information\n\nmay be received months later that requires an adjustment of the royalty. CR3:1138\n\n(¶6). If the failure to reconcile underpayment by March 1 results in immediate\n\ntermination, the lessee would risk losing its lease based on a disagreement about\n\nthe methodology, pricing, or volumes to be used in royalty calculations, or if it\n\nmade a mistake. CR3:1138 (¶7). Such an interpretation would allow lessors\n\neffectively to blackmail a lessee by disputing every reconciliation. Id. And it would\n\nallow, as in this case, a lessor to conduct audits months or years after the claimed\n\ntermination event, looking for any type of uncorrected underpayment in order to\n\nhijack a valuable mineral lease and improvements to property and recover over a\n\nyear of past proceeds. Id.\n\n      Paragraph XIV does not clearly and unequivocally provide for termination\n\nbased on a failure to make reconciliation payments by March 1. By its plain\n\nlanguage, paragraph XIV does not provide for termination of the lease based on\n\nunderpayment at all. Instead, paragraph XIV provides for termination only for a\n\nnonpayment of monthly royalties within 60 days after the production month.\n\nAccordingly, this Court should reverse the summary judgment in its entirety and\n\nrender partial summary judgment that the lease did not terminate.\n\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\f             4.    In any event, Paragraph XIV cannot support termination so\n                   long as Escondido’s interpretation is reasonable.\n\n      Even if Justapor’s competing interpretation were somehow defensible, the\n\nfact that Escondido’s interpretation is reasonable would, at a minimum, mean that\n\nJimmy Jones drafted a lease agreement that is fundamentally ambiguous. Because\n\nan ambiguous termination or forfeiture provision cannot support that draconian\n\nremedy, the trial court erred in concluding that Escondido’s lease expired. See\n\nKnight, 188 S.W.2d at 566. “If the provision is ambiguous, that alone condemns it\n\nas a forfeiture provision.” Decker, 110 Tex. at 94, 216 S.W. at 386. Upon\n\nconcluding two reasonable interpretations exist, the result is not a fact issue on the\n\nprovision’s proper meaning, but instead a ruling as a matter of law against\n\ntermination. See Knight, 188 S.W.2d at 566; Decker, 110 Tex. at 94, 216 S.W. at\n\n386. This court should therefore render judgment that the lease did not terminate.\n\n      C.     Independently, termination is improper because Justapor did not\n             establish Escondido was required to reconcile any underpayment.\n\n      An independent reason to reverse the trial court’s holding of termination is\n\nthat Justapor failed to establish conclusively that Escondido breached the contract\n\nby failing to reconcile alleged underpayments. Although the Court could decide the\n\nissue of termination without deciding whether Escondido breached the contract, it\n\nis necessary for the Court to address this part I.C in order to rule on the summary\n\njudgment determination of breach of contract as a matter of law, the award of\n\n\n\n                                         49\n\f$3,619 in contract damages, and the severed claim for attorney’s fees and other\n\nfees. See CR3:1861, 1897-98.\n\n      Justapor’s claim of breach is based on two different periods and amounts of\n\nalleged underpayment: (1) $77,107 for production months February 2012 through\n\nJanuary 2013; and (2) $3,851 for production months October 2011 through January\n\n2012. Because the theory and defenses for these two periods are different, we\n\naddress them separately.\n\n             1.    Justapor did not establish any underpayment for\n                   production months February 2012 – January 2013 based on\n                   unambiguous lease terms.\n\n      There are two respects in which Justapor’s argument for termination is not\n\nunambiguously supported by the royalty-price provisions: (1) the effect of the\n\nspecial royalty pricing provision in the first lease amendment, and (2) the effect of\n\nthe royalty pricing prong on which Justapor relies. Summary judgment on the issue\n\nof breach was improper because the lease unambiguously supports Escondido’s\n\nreading of the amendment. Alternately, the lease is ambiguous, precluding\n\nsummary judgment. Reilly v. Rangers Mgmt., Inc., 727 S.W.2d 527, 529 (Tex.\n\n1987). Further, if there is any ambiguity, uncertainty, or doubt in the lease\n\nlanguage triggering termination, forfeiture is prohibited as a matter of law. Knight,\n\n188 S.W.2d at 566. Thus, Justapor’s motion should have been denied and partial\n\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\fsummary judgment of no termination should have been granted in Escondido’s\n\nfavor.\n\n                     a.     The special pricing provision replaced all pricing\n                            measures, or alternatively was ambiguous.\n\n         The parties’ dispute over the royalty price concerns the effect of the lease\n\namendment on the pricing provision in paragraph III(b), which provided that the\n\n25% royalty “shall be calculated and paid to [Justapor] based upon the highest of”\n\nfour different gas prices: (i) “CURRENT MARKET VALUE,” (ii) the\n\n“CURRENT          HOUSTON       SHIP     CHANNEL        PRICE,”     (iii)   “CURRENT\n\nPROCEEDS REALIZED BY LESSEE” [Escondido], and (iv) “the highest sales\n\nprice of any gas were gas produced from the property could be present when sold\n\nto a third party.” CR3:982 (¶III(b)). The first three of these prices were defined in\n\ndetail; the last was not defined at all. CR3:982-83 (¶III(b)(i)–(iii)).\n\n         In the lease amendment, the special pricing provision stated:\n\n         Provided however, Lessee shall have the right to enter into gas sales’\n         contracts that will determine the price upon which gas royalty is\n         calculated if such contracts provide no less than a price\n         redetermination every six months and provide the following minimum\n         terms....\n\nCR3:1015 (minimum terms omitted); CR3:1326 (¶5). The amendment, as drafted,\n\nplaced this provision in a paragraph labeled as an amendment to Paragraph III “(b)\n\nii.” It appeared at the end of a long paragraph in which the first parts of the\n\nparagraph define “HOUSTON SHIP CHANNEL PRICE.” CR3:1015.\n\n\n                                           51\n\f      The parties offer two competing interpretations:\n\n      1 – Escondido’s interpretation: The special pricing provision, on its face,\n\n      modifies “the price upon which gas royalty is calculated.” It replaces all four\n\n      alternate price measures as the single price on which gas royalty is\n\n      calculated.\n\n      2 – Justapor’s interpretation: The special pricing provision only modifies\n\n      the Houston Ship Channel Price—which means that any of the other three\n\n      alternate prices govern if it is higher. See CR3:1669.\n\nThere are several reasons why Escondido’s interpretation is the only reasonable\n\none, or alternatively, the amendment is at least ambiguous.\n\n      First, the special pricing provision does not modify only the Houston Ship\n\nChannel Price as Justapor claims. CR3:1015. The sentence does not mention the\n\nHouston Ship Channel Price. Instead, the sentence states in global terms that its\n\nmeasure “will determine the price upon which gas royalty is calculated.” Id.\n\nJustapor’s reading of this sentence contradicts its plain language. Justapor attempts\n\nto transform “price upon which gas royalty is calculated” into the Houston Ship\n\nChannel Price. But the gas royalty is not calculated on the Houston Ship Channel\n\nPrice under the original lease when the Houston Ship Channel Price is not the\n\nhighest of the four measures. The plain language of the special price provision\n\nmodifies the whole royalty price, not just the Houston Ship Channel Price.\n\n\n                                         52\n\f      Second, Justapor’s best argument is based, not on the language of this\n\nsentence, but on its label and location—at the end of a long paragraph that begins\n\nwith the title “(b) ii” and that, apart from this sentence, consists of a definition of\n\nthe Houston Ship Channel Price. But the location and label of the paragraph do not\n\ndetermine its meaning when the plain language requires a different construction.\n\nAlthough “in certain cases courts may consider the title of a contract provision or\n\nsection to interpret a contract, ‘the greater weight is given to the operative\n\ncontractual clauses of the agreement.’” Enter. Leasing Co. v. Barrios, 156 S.W.3d\n\n547, 549 (Tex. 2004) (per curiam) (quoting Neece v. A.A.A. Realty Co., 159 Tex.\n\n403, 322 S.W.2d 597, 600 (1959)).\n\n      Third, it would make no sense for the special pricing provision to modify\n\njust the Houston Ship Channel Price. If the special pricing provision were to\n\nmodify only the Ship Channel price, then it would be redundant with part (iii) of\n\nthe 4-prong royalty in the original lease, which also is based on a “current\n\nproceeds” measure. Under Justapor’s reading, the amendment would make parts\n\n(ii) and (iii) redundant, therefore rendering one of them meaningless surplusage. A\n\ncourt should avoid an interpretation that renders a term meaningless. Italian\n\nCowboy, 341 S.W.3d at 333. Instead, the special pricing provision is a measure of\n\nroyalty price based on the current proceeds that Escondido receives from contracts\n\nthat meet minimum pricing requirements. That has nothing to do with the Ship\n\n\n                                          53\n\fChannel Price, but is a replacement for all of the royalty measures and therefore\n\n“will determine the price upon which gas royalty is calculated.” CR3:1015.\n\n      Fourth, the surrounding circumstances, including the parties’ prior\n\nnegotiations, demonstrate that Justapor’s interpretation is unreasonable. See\n\nHouston Exploration Co. v. Wellington Underwriting Ags., Ltd., 352 S.W.3d 462,\n\n469 (Tex. 2011) (noting that courts may consider “surrounding circumstances that\n\ninform, rather than vary from or contradict, the contract text”). Wrather told Jones\n\nthat Escondido did not want to use the royalty calculation in the original lease, but\n\ninstead wanted to base pricing on Escondido’s agreement with Enterprise.\n\nCR3:1325 (¶4); CR3:1274. And Jones agreed to such a non-assignable\n\namendment. CR3:1325-26 (¶4). These negotiations, consistent with Escondido’s\n\ninterpretation, render Justapor’s interpretation unreasonable.\n\n                   b.     The royalty price measure on which Justapor relies is\n                          ambiguous or meaningless.\n\n      Justapor’s motion for summary judgment argued that Escondido underpaid\n\nroyalties by around $77,100 for one year of production starting in February 2012\n\nbecause it did not use the fourth pricing measure in the original lease:\n\n      (iv) the highest sales price of any gas were gas produced from the\n      property could be present when sold to a third party.\n\nCR3:982 (¶III(b)); see also CR1:233-235 (motion for summary judgment);\n\nCR1:330-332 (expert calculations of underpayment). Justapor argued that this\n\n\n\n                                         54\n\fmeasure resulted in the highest gas price and should have been applied after\n\nFebruary 2012. CR1:233-35; CR1:330-332.\n\n      This provision is ambiguous at best, and meaningless at worst. Even if it is\n\nassumed that “were” is a typo and should mean “where,” this provision still makes\n\nno sense. For instance, would “where gas is sold” refer to the highest sales from a\n\nparticular well, from anywhere on the property, or to market price in the area?\n\nDoes “when sold” refer to the highest sales price at the exact time of the sale, the\n\nday of the sale, the month of the sale? And does “when sold to a third party” refer\n\nto the highest sales price for that particular purchaser or to any purchaser?\n\n      There was ample summary-judgment testimony that this language is\n\nmeaningless in the industry. According to Energy Law Professor Lowe, “[a]\n\ntypical lessee in the oil-and-gas industry would not know how to apply this\n\nprovision to the calculation of royalty payments” and it “could be interpreted in\n\nalternative ways....” CR3:1137 (¶2). It is not a “customary or usual royalty\n\nprovision” and is “unclear and ambiguous.” Id. According to CPA Abington, this\n\nprovision is “unclear” and is not defined. CR3:1150 (¶10). This provision was\n\ninherently ambiguous.\n\n             2.     Fact issues exist regarding production months November\n                    2011 – January 2012.\n\n      The issue for the alleged $3,851 underpayment for production months\n\nNovember 2011 through January 2012 is different. There is no dispute that\n\n\n                                          55\n\fEscondido paid Justapor royalties that were $3,851 less than the Enterprise special\n\npricing provision set out in the amendment. CR1:340:13-23; CR3:1148 (¶4). But it\n\ndid not make up that amount because (1) Justapor caused it to receive a lower price\n\nduring this period by terminating the Enterprise ground lease and insisting that\n\nEscondido continue to sell at the daily spot price, and (2) Jones verbally agreed to\n\nthe royalty he was going to get based on the lower daily spot price. CR1:340:20-\n\n341:20; CR3:1089:13-20; see also supra p. 24-25. Further, Jones did not complain\n\nabout this alleged nonpayment for over 18 months as he continued to accept\n\nroyalties from Escondido. CR3:1044:20-1045:9. During this time Escondido\n\ncontinued to invest an additional $10 million into its $33 million investment,\n\nincluding drilling costs and other improvements CR3:1220-21.\n\n      This evidence at least created a fact issue on Escondido’s defenses of waiver\n\nand estoppel. CR2:928. Jones’ verbal agreement to the reduced royalty, plus his\n\ncontinued acceptance of royalties for 18 months without complaint, raises a fact\n\nissue on waiver. See G.H. Bass & Co. v. Dalsan Properties-Abilene, 885 S.W.2d\n\n572, 578 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1994, no writ) (holding evidence that landlord\n\naccepted less than full payment raised a fact issue of waiver precluding summary\n\njudgment).\n\n      Similarly, the evidence supports an inference that Jones concealed his\n\ncomplaint and his belief that the lease terminated as Escondido poured an\n\n\n                                        56\n\fadditional $10 million into drilling costs and improvements. This meets the\n\nelements of equitable estoppel: (1) a false representation or concealment of\n\nmaterial facts; (2) made with knowledge, actual or constructive, of those facts; (3)\n\nwith the intention that it should be acted on; (4) to a party without knowledge or\n\nmeans of obtaining knowledge of the facts; (5) who detrimentally relies on the\n\nrepresentations. Johnson & Higgins of Tex., Inc. v. Kenneco Energy, Inc., 962\n\nS.W.2d 507, 515-16 (Tex. 1998).\n\n      Accordingly, the summary judgment and the awards based on termination\n\nand breach of contract should be reversed, summary judgment rendered that there\n\nwas no termination, and the breach-of-contract issue remanded for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n      D.       Independently, lease termination is improper because it is\n               inequitable on these facts.\n\n      Because this case involves forfeiture, equity is an independent ground to\n\nreverse the termination finding. Equitable defenses are available to a claim of lease\n\ntermination. See Humble Oil & Ref. Co. v. Harrison, 146 Tex. 216, 226, 205\n\nS.W.2d 355, 361 (Tex. 1947). Even if the lease clearly, plainly, and\n\nunambiguously provided for termination in these circumstances, the equities\n\n“justify a continuation of the contract rather than forfeiture of it....” T-Anchor, 529\n\nS.W.2d at 627. “[E]quity will consider the conduct of the adversary, the\n\nrequirements of public policy, and the relation of the misconduct to the subject\n\n\n                                          57\n\fmatter of the suit and to [the party asserting clean hands].” Pac. Mut. Life Ins. Co.\n\nv. Westglen Park Inc., 160 Tex. 1, 6, 325 S.W.2d 113, 117 (1959).\n\n              1.     It would be inequitable to enforce a termination in light of\n                     Justapor’s conduct.\n\n       Justapor’s claim of forfeiture disregards its apparent scheme to lay a trap.\n\nJones, while representing Escondido in other matters, drafted a lease that, under his\n\ninterpretation, enhanced the likelihood both of Escondido’s forfeiture and\n\nJustapor’s windfall. The evidence supports an inference that Justapor told\n\nEscondido that the “tough” aspects of the lease would not apply to it and that any\n\nproblems would be resolved by negotiation. Then, after reaping the benefit of\n\nEscondido’s $33 million in improvements, Justapor made every effort to find a\n\ntechnical reason to terminate the lease and caused Escondido to lose its highest-\n\npaying gas purchaser. This evidence of Justapor’s unclean hands should have\n\nprecluded summary judgment for Justapor. See Truly v. Austin, 744 S.W.2d 934,\n\n938 (Tex. 1988) (preventing a party who caused the failure of a project to impose\n\nliability on others for its failure).\n\n       The negotiation and drafting of the lease. Before entering this lease, Jones\n\ngained Escondido’s trust by making reassurances about any future problems with\n\nthis lease and even becoming Escondido’s fiduciary in negotiating other leases.\n\n       Jones drafted the Justapor lease and the amendment. CR3:1325-26. He was\n\nalso acting as Escondido’s attorney. Although Jones did not represent Escondido in\n\n\n                                         58\n\fnegotiating this lease, he was Escondido’s attorney in other matters during some of\n\nthe negotiations and at the time this lease was signed. CR3:1328 (¶¶12-13);\n\nCR3:1325-26 (¶¶3-5); CR3:1328 (¶13). The situation is similar to a lawyer who\n\nalready represents a client when he negotiates an attorney-client agreement with\n\nthat client. Because a lawyer's fiduciary duty to a client covers contract\n\nnegotiations between them, such contracts are closely scrutinized. Anglo-Dutch\n\nPetroleum Int'l, Inc. v. Greenberg Peden, P.C., 352 S.W.3d 445, 450 (Tex. 2011).\n\nAnd although Escondido was a sophisticated party, it was not represented by\n\nindependent counsel, nor did Jones suggest that it retain counsel. CR3:1325 (¶2).\n\n      Jones assured Escondido that it would not be subject to the original lease’s\n\npricing terms and that any disagreements would be negotiated. He told Escondido\n\nJustapor would agree to payment of royalty based on the Enterprise pricing terms,\n\nbut only so long as the lease was held by Escondido. CR1325 (¶4). And he agreed\n\nto draft the “special royalty pricing provision, based upon the Enterprise price.”\n\nCR1325-26(¶4). He told Escondido that he had drafted a “tough agreement” in\n\ncase Escondido ever assigned its rights under the Lease Agreement to another\n\nparty, but that he would work out with Escondido any issues that might arise.\n\nCR3:1329 (¶17). He never told Escondido that he interpreted the termination\n\nprovision to mean that the lease could terminate based on an underpayment of\n\n\n\n\n                                        59\n\froyalties, a circumstance the lease covered under a separate provision. CR3:1329\n\n(¶17).\n\n         Despite these representations and Jones’ fiduciary relationship with\n\nEscondido, he now seeks to do the opposite—argue that the royalties were not\n\ngoverned by the Enterprise price agreement and assert that the lease terminated\n\nipso facto, without notice, and without any attempt to work out any issues that\n\nmight arise.\n\n         Justapor’s creation of the circumstances resulting in underpayment.\n\nJones, acting on behalf of Justapor, created the situation that gave rise to the first\n\nunderpayment. No gas royalty payments were disputed until Jones terminated the\n\nEnterprise Surface Site Agreement unilaterally. Justapor improperly terminated\n\nthat agreement because Enterprise was late on one $4,500 lease payment.\n\nCR3:1326 (¶8); CR 3:1092:5-11; CR3:1282. Justapor refused to give Enterprise\n\nthe notice of default and opportunity to cure required by the lease, and it even\n\nrefused to accept Enterprise’s subsequent rental check. CR3:1054:17-1059:13. It\n\ntold Enterprise that Enterprise could not use the meter and that Justapor was going\n\nto take their equipment. CR3:1092:7-19. And Justapor insisted Escondido sell gas\n\nat a lower daily spot price to Kinder Morgan rather than shutting in the wells until\n\nEscondido could negotiate a better price. CR3:1326-27 (¶8). This prevented\n\n\n\n\n                                         60\n\fEnterprise from purchasing gas produced on the Justapor Ranch and forced\n\nEscondido to sell gas for a lower price. CR3:1326-27 (¶8); CR1:341:5-13.\n\n      Justapor’s agreement to the underpayment. There was evidence that\n\nJones verbally agreed to the royalty price based on the lower daily spot price.\n\nCR1:340:20-341:20; CR3:1089:13-20. Although this verbal modification of the\n\nlease may not be enforceable, it is evidence that Justapor led Escondido to believe\n\nthe lower royalty payment was not a problem. This is especially true in light of\n\nJones earlier promise to Wrather that, notwithstanding the lease’s “tough” terms\n\ndesigned for assignees, Justapor would work out any problems that arose with\n\nEscondido. It would be inequitable to terminate the lease based on an\n\nunderpayment to which Justapor consented.\n\n      The evidence supports an inference that Justapor terminated the Enterprise\n\nSurface Site Agreement to cause Escondido to lose that purchaser, provoking an\n\nact of default resulting in forfeiture. Equity should not reward that scheme.\n\n             2.    Forfeiture is inequitable because               it    would   be\n                   disproportionate with the alleged breach.\n\n      The trial court terminated Escondido’s lease in which it had invested more\n\nthan $33 million, and awarded well more than $12 million in damages, as legal\n\nremedies to Escondido’s royalty underpayment of somewhere between $3,800 and\n\n$81,000, or somewhere between .00067 and .014 of the $5.7 million in royalties\n\npreviously paid to Justapor.\n\n\n                                         61\n\f      Even if the lease clearly and unambiguously provided for termination, the\n\ninequity of such disproportionate result does not justify a forfeiture. See T-Anchor\n\nCorp., 529 S.W.2d at 627.\n\n             3.    Forfeiture would be inequitable because Jones did not raise\n                   it for 18 months after the alleged termination.\n\n      Justapor first notified Escondido that it believed there had been any\n\nunderpayment of gas royalties when it sued Escondido in August 2013. CR1:22;\n\nCR3:1044:20-1045:9. This was 20 months after the underpayment of October 2011\n\nroyalties and 17 months after the March 2, 2012 date Justapor alleges, and the trial\n\ncourt held, that the lease terminated. CR3:1859. During this time Escondido\n\ncontinued to invest an additional $10 million into its $33 million investment,\n\nincluding drilling costs and other improvements CR3:1220-21. Yet under the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment, Escondido loses all of its investment, must return all revenues\n\nfrom that 18-month period, and cannot deduct its expenses during that period. See\n\nCR3:1859-61. That result is neither fair nor equitable.\n\n      E.     Remedy: the summary judgment should be reversed in its entirety\n             and partial summary judgment rendered that there was no\n             termination.\n\n      Both Justapor’s grounds for summary judgment and all affirmative relief\n\ngranted to it in the judgment were premised on the termination of the lease. See\n\nCR1:260-61; CR3:1858-1861. Accordingly, the summary judgment granting\n\nJustapor’s affirmative claims should be reversed in its entirety.\n\n\n                                         62\n\f      Additionally, because the lease did not terminate as a matter of law,\n\njudgment should be rendered in Escondido’s favor denying the following causes of\n\naction asserted by Justapor, all of which are premised on lease termination:\n\ntrespass (including claims of bad-faith trespass and punitive damages), trespass to\n\ntry title, and its request for an accounting and declaratory relief. CR1:153-155;\n\nCR2:812. Justapor’s claim of breach of contract should be remanded for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this Court’s judgment.\n\nII.   Regardless of whether the lease terminated, Justapor did not\n      conclusively establish Escondido was a bad-faith trespasser.\n\n      In its final judgment and summary-judgment orders, the trial court found\n\n“that from March 2, 2012 through the date hereof [Escondido] has remained, and\n\nremains, in unlawful possession of minerals covered by the Justapor Lease as a\n\nbad-faith trespasser, and is not, and never has been, a good faith trespasser.…”\n\nCR3:1760, 1797, 1859. Based on this ruling, the trial court declared that Justapor is\n\nentitled to damages in the amount of all proceeds from the sale of oil and gas\n\nproduced from the Justapor Lease from March 2, 2012 until the date of final, non-\n\nappealable judgment in this matter, less royalties already paid by Escondido, but\n\nwithout any deduction for production costs or other expenses incurred by\n\nEscondido with regard to the Lease. CR3:1860; see also CR1:254.\n\n      Justapor’s claim that Escondido is a trespasser rests on the finding that the\n\nLease terminated. CR1:250-54. As shown in part I above, the trial court erred in\n\n\n                                         63\n\fthat ruling. Accordingly, as a matter of law, Escondido remained the lessee and\n\nwas not a trespasser at all, much less a trespasser in bad faith. If the Court reverses\n\nthe trial court’s ruling that the lease terminated, it should reverse the summary\n\njudgment on the bad-faith trespass claim without the need to examine this separate\n\nissue.\n\n         But even if the lease had terminated as a matter of law, Justapor did not\n\nconclusively establish bad-faith trespass, and the trial court’s summary judgment\n\nshould be reversed.\n\n         A.    Escondido was not a bad-faith trespasser per se because it lawfully\n               entered into possession of the land.\n\n         The question of whether Escondido was a bad-faith trespasser turns on\n\nwhether, as a matter of law, Escondido transformed from a lessee in lawful\n\npossession of land under a lease into a bad-faith trespasser at the moment Justapor\n\ncontends the Lease terminated (i.e., on March 2, 2012). In general, the question of\n\na defendant’s good faith in entering upon land and developing oil-and-gas\n\nproduction is one of fact. Gulf Prod. Co. v. Spear, 125 Tex. 530, 539, 84 S.W.2d\n\n452, 457 (1935). To be in good faith, a party must have both an honest and\n\nreasonable belief in the superiority of one’s title. Id.; Mayfield, 693 S.W.2d at 504.\n\n         The law will conclusively presume that a person is a bad-faith trespasser\n\nonly when he enters into possession of land and makes improvements thereon with\n\nfull knowledge of the pendency of an action to enforce an adverse claim to the\n\n\n                                          64\n\fpremises. Houston Prod. Co. v. Mecom Oil Co., 62 S.W.2d 75, 76 (Tex. Comm’n\n\nApp. 1933); Mayfield v. de Benavides, 693 S.W.2d 500, 504 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 1985, writ ref’d n.r.e.). The conclusive-presumption standard does not\n\nfocus on when the person enters on to the land, but rather when he enters into\n\npossession of the land. Thus, Texas law distinguishes between: (1) a person who\n\nenters into peaceable possession of land under a valid lease before any adverse\n\nclaim is filed; and (2) a person whose first entry on the land does not occur until\n\nafter a lawsuit has been filed to enforce an adverse claim. Mecom, 62 S.W.2d at 76.\n\n      When a lessee in good faith enters into peaceable possession of land under a\n\nvalid oil-and-gas lease, and under a claim of right produces oil and gas from it, and\n\nthe lease later is declared invalid or otherwise terminated in a suit to enforce an\n\nadverse claim, the lessee is not a bad-faith trespasser per se. Id.; Barnes v. Winona\n\nOil Co., 200 P. 985, 986 (Okla. 1921) (quoted and discussed in Mecom). The\n\nconclusive presumption will not arise if the lessee has taken possession of land\n\nunder a lease in good faith, but later learns that the lease does not afford him the\n\nright to develop the minerals. Mecom, 62 S.W.2d at 76; Barnes, 200 P. at 986.\n\nOnly when a person first enters into possession of land with full knowledge of the\n\npendency of a lawsuit to enforce an adverse claim—i.e., there is no prior\n\npossession by the lessee—does Texas law classify the person as a bad-faith\n\n\n\n\n                                         65\n\ftrespasser per se, such that he cannot recover the cost of his improvements.\n\nMecom, 62 S.W.2d at 76-77.\n\n      This rule reflects Texas policy to encourage the recovery of minerals and to\n\ndiscourage waste in the production of oil and gas. Key Operating & Equip., Inc. v.\n\nHegar, 435 S.W.3d 794, 798 (Tex. 2014). When a lessee acquires peaceable\n\npossession of the land prior to a lawsuit on an adverse claim, allowing continued\n\nproduction pending resolution of a later claim furthers the recovery of minerals and\n\nlowers the risk of waste. Subjecting oil and gas lessees to the risk that, upon the\n\nfiling of an adverse claim (no matter how arguable or spurious), the lessee must\n\ncease operations until the claim is resolved would discourage lessees from agreeing\n\nto develop oil and gas production. Moreover, punishing a lessee who has obtained\n\npossession in an orderly manner without creating a breach of the peace, and who is\n\noperating under a lease that has not yet been declared invalid or void, would give\n\nthe landowner an unjust windfall. See Barnes, 200 P. at 986.\n\n      A lessee who enters into possession of land under a lease before the filing of\n\na lawsuit, i.e., without any knowledge of a pending action to enforce an adverse\n\nclaim, does not fall under the conclusive presumption standard and cannot be a\n\nbad-faith trespasser per se. See Mecom, 62 S.W.2d at 76-77. Continuing to possess\n\nthe land after receiving notice of an adverse claim does not prohibit a finding of\n\ngood faith, although it is a circumstance a jury may consider in answering the fact\n\n\n                                        66\n\fquestion. Mayfield, 693 S.W.2d at 505. This rule recognizes that, even though a\n\ndefendant may know there is title in another superior to the defendant’s title, he\n\nmight believe, and have good grounds to believe, in his own claim to the property.\n\nLowder v. Schluter, 78 Tex. 103, 108, 14 S.W. 205, 206, rev’d on reh’g on other\n\ngrounds,1 78 Tex. 109, 14 S.W. 207 (1890). Belief in one’s own superior right is\n\ndetermined from all the facts in evidence, the titles, and other circumstances, as\n\nviewed by persons of ordinary intelligence and prudence. Lowder, 78 Tex. at 108,\n\n14 S.W. at 206.\n\n       It is undisputed that Escondido entered lawful possession of the land before\n\nMarch 2, 2012. CR3:981, 1326 (¶5). 2 Justapor has neither alleged nor proven that\n\nthe lease terminated before that date. Accordingly, Escondido cannot be a bad-faith\n\ntrespasser per se. See Mecom, 62 S.W.2d at 76-77.\n\n       B.     Justapor also did not conclusively establish that Escondido lacked\n              a good-faith belief in the superiority of its title.\n\n       Aside from the per se bad faith established when a lawsuit is filed before a\n\nparty first gains possession of land, good faith may become a question of law if\n\n1\n  On rehearing, the Court determined there was no evidence defendants had adverse possession\nthat would entitle them to recover the value of any improvements, rendering harmless the jury\ncharge error on which the Court initially reversed and remanded. 78 Tex. at 109, 14 S.W. at 207.\n2\n  Justapor’s lawsuit was not filed until August 20, 2013. CR1:22. Escondido was not served with\nthe lawsuit until September 23. CR1:9. Even if the conclusive presumption could apply,\nEscondido could not have acted “with full knowledge of the pendency of an action to enforce an\nadverse claim to the premises” until September 23, 2013, a date over 18 months after the date on\nwhich the trial court concluded Escondido became a bad-faith trespasser. See CR3:1760, 1797,\n1859.\n\n\n                                              67\n\fthere is no conflict in the evidence. Covington v. Travelers Indem. Co., 122 S.W.3d\n\n330, 334-35 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2003, no pet.). On the other hand, if there is\n\nevidence on both sides, bad faith presents a fact question precluding summary\n\njudgment. See Covington, 122 S.W.3d at 335; Vela v. Pennzoil Prod. Co., 723\n\nS.W.2d 199, 205 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1986, writ ref’d n.r.e.); Elliott v. Davis,\n\n553 S.W.2d 223, 226-27 (Tex. Civ. App.—Amarillo 1977, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\nRendering summary judgment where such a fact question exists not only\n\ncontravenes Texas law, but also deprives the defendant of its “exceptionally broad\n\njury trial right” under the Texas Constitution. Universe Life Ins. Co. v. Giles, 950\n\nS.W.2d 48, 56 (Tex. 1997).\n\n      In this case, the weight of the summary-judgment evidence indicates that\n\nEscondido had a good-faith belief in the superiority of its title. Justapor contends\n\nthe Lease terminated because of alleged royalty underpayment. CR1:246-49.\n\nEscondido, on the other hand, contends the termination provision is triggered only\n\nby nonpayment of monthly royalties; for this and other reasons, any alleged\n\nunderpayment     did   not   terminate   the   Lease.   CR3:959-66.    Escondido’s\n\ninterpretation, supported by expert testimony about industry and custom, provided\n\ngood grounds to believe the Lease continued in effect, even if Escondido’s belief\n\nultimately turns out to be mistaken. CR3:1137-138 (¶¶2-9); CR3:1149-51 (¶¶6-11).\n\nAdditionally, there was evidence that Escondido believed its interpretation of the\n\n\n                                         68\n\fpricing and termination provisions was correct. CR3:1325-26 (¶¶4-5), 1329-30\n\n(¶17); see Brannon v. Gulf States Energy Co., 562 S.W.2d 219, 224 (Tex. 1977)\n\n(holding one may be completely mistaken about superior title and still trespass in\n\ngood faith); Lowder, 78 Tex. at 108, 14 S.W. at 206 (allowing that good grounds to\n\nbelieve in one’s own claim even when one knows there is superior title in another).\n\nThere was no evidence that Escondido ever believed that the lease terminated and\n\nthat it was a trespasser.\n\n      At most Escondido may have established its good faith as a matter of law; at\n\nleast, the issue presents a question of fact that a jury must decide. See Spear, 125\n\nTex. at 539, 84 S.W.2d at 457; Covington, 122 S.W.3d at 335. As a result, the trial\n\ncourt’s summary-judgment ruling that Justapor was a bad-faith trespasser\n\n(including both liability findings and all damages awards) should be reversed and\n\nthe claim remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Court’s opinion.\n\n      C.     Because Escondido was not a bad-faith trespasser, the judgment\n             should be reversed and the case remanded for further\n             proceedings.\n\n      Several aspects of the judgment were premised on the ruling that Escondido\n\nis a bad-faith trespasser. If this Court holds the lease terminated, but reverses the\n\nruling that Escondido is a bad-faith trespasser, then other aspects of the judgment\n\nalso must be reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         69\n\f      Trespass damages. Escondido’s measure and evidence of damages to\n\nsupport the judgment award of $12,038,042 in trespass damages require that\n\nEscondido be a bad-faith trespasser. See CR3:1676, 1860, 1861. But if the bad-\n\nfaith ruling is reversed, Escondido’s measure is incorrect because it fails to deduct\n\ndrilling and operating costs. See Moore v. Jet Stream Investments, Ltd., 261\n\nS.W.3d 412, 428 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008, pet. denied). In cases involving\n\ngood-faith oil-and-gas trespass, courts measure damages by “net profits.” Maxvill-\n\nGlasco Drilling, Co., Inc. v. Royal Oil & Gas Corp., 800 S.W.2d 384, 386 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Corpus Christi 1990, writ denied). A party “who drills a well in good faith\n\nis entitled to reimbursement.” Wagner & Brown, Ltd. v. Sheppard, 282 S.W.3d\n\n419, 426 (Tex. 2008). The award of trespass damages must be reversed and the\n\nissue remanded.\n\n      Accounting. The judgment orders an accounting and payment of all\n\nproceeds of production from March 2, 2012 through August 31, 2014 and from\n\nSeptember 1, 2014 until Escondido relinquishes possession. CR3:1859. This relief\n\nshould be reversed to allow deductions for drilling and operating costs. See Moore,\n\n261 S.W.3d at 428.\n\n      Prejudgment interest. The judgment’s award of prejudgment interest is\n\nbased on the improper damage awards and thus should be reversed. See CR3:1861.\n\n\n\n\n                                         70\n\f       Relief under Texas Property Code. The judgment denied Escondido’s\n\ncounterclaim under Texas Property Code Sections 22.021-0.24, including its claim\n\nto recover the value of improvements. CR2:930; CR3:1860. Section 22.021\n\nprovides that a trespasser who possessed property in good faith and made valuable\n\nimprovements to it is either:\n\n       (1) entitled to recover the amount by which the estimated value of the\n       defendant's improvements exceeds the estimated value of the\n       defendant's use and occupation of and waste or other injury to the\n       property; or\n\n       (2) liable for the amount by which the value of the use and occupation\n       of and waste and other injury to the property exceeds the value of the\n       improvements and for costs.\n\nTex. Prop. Code Ann. § 22.021(a); see also Brannon, 562 S.W.2d at 224 (holding\n\ndriller under invalid lease entitled to reimbursement of reasonable drilling\n\nexpenditures if it drilled “in good faith belief in the superiority of its lease”).\n\n       If the bad-faith ruling is reversed, the case should be remanded for trial of\n\nthis claim because there was evidence that Escondido made $33.1 million in\n\nimprovements to the land, including approximately $10 million after March 2,\n\n2012. CR3:1149 (¶5); CR3:1220-21.\n\nIII.   The trial court erred by granting summary judgment declaring the\n       parties’ rights and requiring conveyance of Escondido’s leasehold\n       interests regarding the “vacancy tract.”\n\n       Justapor also sought summary judgment on declaratory judgment concerning\n\n42 acres known as the “vacancy tract.” The dispute concerns the meaning and\n\n\n                                           71\n\feffect of the August 9, 2011 letter agreement regarding the “vacancy tract” and\n\nwhether Justapor is entitled to a conveyance of the vacancy tract. CR1:255. The\n\ntrial court’s summary judgment ruling did not specifically address the vacancy\n\ntract. But its Final Judgment provided broadly that Justapor is entitled to a\n\nconveyance from Escondido “of mineral interests acquired under the Justapor\n\nRanch,...” and “all other additional interests and improvements acquired in or\n\nunder the Justapor Ranch, such as mineral interests, leasehold interests, or any\n\nother interests acquired by lease, deed or otherwise.” CR3:1858 (emphasis added).\n\nThe trial court also ordered specific performance: that Escondido “shall effectuate\n\nsuch conveyance on or before the date this judgment becomes a final, non-\n\nappealable judgment….” CR3:1858-59.\n\n      Escondido seeks to reverse this broad relief in the judgment, in part, because\n\nof the improper ruling on lease termination. But because the vacancy tract was a\n\nseparate summary-judgment ground, and appears to fall within the broad relief\n\ngranted, this separate issue addresses why Justapor is not entitled to a conveyance\n\nof interests specifically in the vacancy tract.\n\n      A.     Justapor did not conclusively establish its declaratory judgment\n             claim.\n\n      Justapor did not conclusively establish (1) that its interpretation of the letter\n\nagreement was correct, or (2) the existence of a justiciable controversy.\n\nDeclarations interpreting a contract are appropriately rendered by summary\n\n\n                                           72\n\fjudgment only if the contract provision at issue is unambiguous. See Barrand, Inc.\n\nv. Whataburger, Inc., 214 S.W.3d 122, 129 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2006, pet.\n\ndenied). Declaratory judgment is proper only if a real and substantial controversy\n\ninvolving a genuine conflict of tangible interests exists, not merely a theoretical\n\ndispute. See Bonham State Bank v. Beadle, 907 S.W.2d 465, 467 (Tex. 1995).\n\n            1.     Justapor did not conclusively establish that the interests to\n                   be conveyed include leasehold interests.\n\n      Based on the letter agreement as a whole, the only reasonable interpretation\n\nis that Escondido agreed to convey only “mineral interests”—not leasehold\n\ninterests. The summary judgment record contains two versions of the letter\n\nagreement. CR1:445-48; CR3:1308-11. Both are initialed. Both are signed. Both\n\nhave the same date.\n\n      The letter agreement attached to Escondido’s summary judgment response\n\nprovides:\n\n      Additionally, we have agreed to convey to an entity of your choice,\n      mineral interests we have acquired under the referenced 803 acres, as\n      well as all other mineral mineral [sic.] interests we acquire in this\n      land after your approval & consent.\n\nCR3:1310 (emphasis added). A different version of the letter agreement attached to\n\nJustapor’s summary judgment motion provides:\n\n      Additionally, we have agreed to convey to an entity of your choice,\n      mineral interests we have acquired under the referenced 803 acres as\n      well as all other additional interests we acquire in this land after your\n      approval and consent.\n\n\n                                         73\n\fCR1:447 (emphasis added).\n\n      Based on these two versions and the letter agreement as a whole, “mineral\n\ninterests” and “additional interests” should mean the same thing. Interpreting the\n\ntwo versions to have the same meaning is consistent with the fact that both\n\nagreements are initialed and dated the same day. These writings must be\n\nconsidered together. See DeWitt Cnty. Elec. Co-op., Inc. v. Parks, 1 S.W.3d 96,\n\n102 (Tex. 1999).\n\n      The letter agreement attached to Justapor’s summary judgment motion\n\nprovides that Escondido will convey “mineral interests we have acquired under the\n\nreferenced 803 acres, as well as all other additional interests we acquire in this\n\nland after your approval and consent.” CR1:447 (emphasis added). The general\n\nterm “additional interests we acquire” refers back to the specific term “mineral\n\ninterests.” See Hilco Elec. Co-op., Inc. v. Midlothian Butane Gas Co., 111 S.W.3d\n\n75, 81 (Tex. 2003). In other words, Escondido agreed as to not only mineral\n\ninterests acquired at the time the agreement was signed, but also any mineral\n\ninterests acquired with Justapor’s approval and consent after signing. See\n\nCR1:447. In contract interpretation, specific and exact terms are given greater\n\nweight than general language. Worldwide Asset Purchasing, L.L.C. v. Rent-A-\n\nCenter E., Inc., 290 S.W.3d 554, 560-61 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, no pet.). When\n\nwords of a general nature are used in connection with the designation of particular\n\n\n                                        74\n\fobjects or classes of persons or things, the meaning of the general words will be\n\nrestricted to the particular designation. Hilco Elec., 111 S.W.3d at 81.\n\n      In order to hold that “additional” means something other than “mineral”\n\ninterests, the Court would have to strike out the term “mineral” from that version\n\nof the letter agreement and add the term “additional.” In contrast, interpreting\n\n“additional” to mean “mineral” interests harmonizes the two versions and prevents\n\na conflict that would render the term “mineral interests” in that version of the letter\n\nagreement meaningless. See Frost Nat’l Bank v. L & F Distribs., Ltd., 165 S.W.3d\n\n310, 312 (Tex. 2005) (per curiam).\n\n      Justapor acknowledged mineral interests do not include leasehold interests.\n\nCR3:1679 (¶38). Justapor’s position that “additional” means a different type of\n\ninterest, as opposed to additional interests of the same type acquired at a later date,\n\nwould require the Court to violate fundamental rules of contract interpretation and\n\ncommon sense. The letter agreement unambiguously requires conveyance only of\n\n“mineral interests,” which do not include leasehold interests. Accordingly, the trial\n\ncourt erred in granting summary judgment that the letter agreement requires\n\nconveyance of interests other than mineral interests.\n\n             2.     Unless “mineral interests” and “additional interests” mean\n                    the same thing, the letter agreement is ambiguous.\n\n      If the Court disagrees, however, the face of the summary judgment record at\n\nleast shows the letter agreement is ambiguous. If “mineral interests” and\n\n\n                                          75\n\f“additional interests” are given different meanings, it is unclear whether the parties\n\nintended to require Escondido to convey “mineral interests” or “additional\n\ninterests” and what “additional interests” might include. Compare CR1:447 with\n\nCR3:1310. This ambiguity would create fact questions about the letter agreement’s\n\nmeaning and effect, precluding summary judgment on Justapor’s vacancy tract\n\nclaim. See Reilly, 727 S.W.2d at 529.\n\n             3.    Justapor did not establish that it had chosen an entity to\n                   which any interests should be conveyed.\n\n      The letter agreement provided that Escondido was obligated to convey either\n\n“mineral interests” or “additional interests” “to an entity of [Justapor’s] choice….”\n\nCR1:447; CR3:1310. Justapor provided no summary judgment evidence that it\n\nidentified its chosen entity to Escondido, and neither the summary judgment\n\nmotion nor the judgment identifies the entity to whom Escondido is required to\n\nconvey unidentified “leasehold interests, or any other interests acquired by lease,\n\ndeed, or otherwise ….” CR1:254-55; CR3:1760.\n\n      Unless and until Justapor chose an entity to whom any later interests could\n\nbe conveyed, there is no basis to conclude that Escondido “failed” to convey any\n\nsuch interest or that it must convey any interest now.\n\n\n\n\n                                         76\n\f             4.     Justapor did not identify any leasehold interest that should\n                    have been, but was not, conveyed.\n\n      Justapor also did not identify any leasehold or other interest that Escondido\n\nacquired in the vacancy tract after Justapor’s approval and consent. The most the\n\nsummary judgment record shows is that Escondido has leased some interests from\n\nowners of the vacancy tract, but there is no evidence as to when these interests\n\nwere acquired or whether they were acquired “after [Justapor’s] approval and\n\nconsent.” CR1:355 (Deupree deposition). Affidavit testimony by Justapor’s Jones\n\nthat “Escondido has failed to convey all of its leasehold interest in the Vacancy\n\nTract” is conclusory and constitutes no evidence. Compare CR1:315-16 (¶8) with\n\nParagon Gen. Contractors, Inc. v. Larco Constr., Inc., 227 S.W.3d 876, 883-84\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 2007, no pet.). This testimony does not identify any lease,\n\nestablish it concerns the vacancy tract, or establish it was acquired after Justapor’s\n\napproval and consent.\n\n      Justapor’s claim for declaratory relief sought an advisory ruling regarding a\n\nphantom interest to be conveyed to a never-chosen entity. It is no support for any\n\nportion of the trial court’s judgment.\n\n      B.     Justapor was not entitled to specific performance.\n\n      Neither Justapor’s pleading nor its summary judgment motion requested\n\nspecific performance, but instead only a declaration that Justapor “is entitled to a\n\nconveyance of all of Escondido’s interest in the Vacancy Tract....” CR1:153 (¶¶22-\n\n\n                                         77\n\f24); CR1:255. A summary judgment cannot be sustained on a ground not set forth\n\nin the motion. McConnell v. Southside Indep. Sch. Dist., 858 S.W.2d 337, 339, 341\n\n(Tex. 1993). Nor is summary judgment proper on an unpleaded claim. See DeBord\n\nv. Muller, 446 S.W.2d 299, 301 (Tex. 1969) (holding summary judgment\n\nunavailable to defendant on unpleaded affirmative defense).\n\n      The trial court granted specific performance when it added to the judgment:\n\n“and [Escondido] shall effectuate such conveyance on or before the date this\n\njudgment becomes a final, non-appealable judgment ….” CR3:1858-59. This grant\n\nof relief is beyond the summary judgment motion. Compare CR1:255 with\n\nCR3:1858-59.\n\n      Even if Justapor had pleaded or sought summary judgment for specific\n\nperformance, Justapor did not show it was entitled to such relief. Claims for\n\ndeclaratory relief and specific performance are not interchangeable. A\n\ndetermination that an agreement is enforceable—i.e., a declaration of the parties’\n\nrights under an agreement—does not equate to a determination that a party is\n\nentitled to specific performance. Levetz v. Sutton, 404 S.W.3d 798, 805 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2013, pet. denied). A party seeking specific performance must\n\nestablish that it has performed, or tendered performance of, its obligations under\n\nthe contract. Stafford v. S. Vanity Magazine, Inc., 231 S.W.3d 530, 535 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2007, pet. denied); Am. Apparel Prods., Inc. v. Brabs, Inc., 880\n\n\n                                       78\n\fS.W.2d 267, 269 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, no writ). By failing to\n\nprovide any evidence (much less, conclusively establish) that it had chosen an\n\nentity to whom any interests should be conveyed, Justapor was not entitled to\n\nsummary judgment affording specific performance.\n\n      In addition, a party seeking specific performance must establish that the\n\nother party has breached the contract. Luccia v. Ross, 274 S.W.3d 140, 146 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. denied). If the letter agreement does not\n\nprovide unambiguously that Escondido is required to convey only mineral\n\ninterests, not leasehold interests, specific performance is improper. A contract is\n\nsubject to specific performance if its essential terms are expressed with such\n\ncertainty and clarity that it may be understood without recourse to parol evidence.\n\nPaciwest, Inc. v. Warner Alan Props., LLC, 266 S.W.3d 559, 571 (Tex. App.—\n\nFort Worth 2008, pet. denied). The heightened degree of certainty required for\n\nspecific performance is a product not only of its equitable nature, but also of its\n\nultimate goal: to require exact performance of a contract in the specific form in\n\nwhich it was made. Levetz, 404 S.W.3d at 805.\n\n      Justapor did not conclusively establish its right to specific performance,\n\nrequiring reversal of this portion of the trial court’s judgment. See City of Houston\n\nv. Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 678 (Tex. 1979).\n\n\n\n\n                                         79\n\f                            CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n   Escondido prays that the Court:\n\n• reverse the trial court’s summary judgment in Justapor’s favor in its entirety;\n\n• either:\n\n      o render partial summary judgment in Escondido’s favor that the lease\n\n            did not terminate and therefore dismiss Justapor’s causes of action for\n\n            trespass, trespass to try title, its request for an accounting and\n\n            declaratory relief; or\n\n      o alternatively, reverse the trial court’s summary judgment that\n\n            Escondido was a bad-faith trespasser and all relief based on that\n\n            finding, including the accounting ordered by the trial court, all awards\n\n            of past and future proceeds from the sale of oil and gas, prejudgment\n\n            interest, costs, and post-judgment interest; and\n\n• and remand this case for further proceedings on the remaining claims\n\n   consistent with this Court’s opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                        80\n\f                            Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                     /s/Robert Dubose\nJames P.

In\n   the event no prIce Index publlcatlon can be agreed upon as reliable, then a reliable\n   governmental or other non-partisan publication evaluating the same Information shall\n   be used, with current payments to be made on the most current Information available\n   and then adjusted, as necessary, within thirty (30) days following the availability of the\n   governmental data or other non-partIsan publication, or If no such publication Is\n   available for purposes, hereof, this standard, as an element for calculation of Lessors\n   royaltIes, shall cease to exist.\n\n          (111) The term \"CURRENT PROCEEDS REAUZED BY LESSEE\" shall be construed to\n  mean the price or value which Is equal to all proceeds actually received by Lessee from\n  Its purchaser (whether affiliated or unaffiliated) for the sale of the gas produced from\n  this lease.\n\n          (c) Lessee specifically agrees to Install, maintain and operate a properly\n  calibrated gas metering device at each gas wellhead for the purpose of accurate\n  measurement of all gas production produced from each gas well on this lease, which\n  gas measurement shall be made pursuant to the measurement law referred to under\n  Article III, paragraph (b) of this lease. Such gas meter shall be avajlable for Inspection\n  as to its calibration, orifice size and measurements at any time or times by Lessor (or\n  Lessor's representative) and no \"by-pass\" valves or connections shall be authorized to\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                983\n\f be made which do not provide for proper and accurate metering of gas production from\nany such gas well. Each such gas metering device and orifice plates shall be Installed\nand maintained In accordance with the provisions of the current American Gas\nAssociation Report No. 3 (A.G.A. Report #3), as now existing. Further, to assure\ncompliance with American Gas Association Report No. 3 (A.G.A. Report #3), as now\n published, such meters shall be Inspected and re-callbrated monthly by Lessee after\nnotice to Lessor with sufficient time for Lessor to arrange to be present, either\npersonally or through Lessor's representative. Lessee shall also Install, operate and\nmaintain a separate gas meter on this lease at each point of exit of a pipeline\ntransporting gas production off of this lease and shall report such gas production\nvolumes taken from this lease, on a monthly basis, to lessor. All gas volume\nmeasurements at the point of exit (whether one or more) shall be compared to the\naggregate of all the Individual wellhead gas volume measurements, and for the purpose\nof royalty payment calculations, Lessee shall use whichever volume Is greater. lessee\nshall report such gas production volumes taken from this lease, and the discrepancies If\nany on a monthly baSiS, to lessor. Lessee shall be required to perform an accurate gas\nanalysis on all gas production, on a well-by-well baSiS, periodically, but at least monthly\nfrom date of first production of each gas well drilled and completed hereunder, which\nanalYSis shall extend to the BTU content of such gas production and other commercial\nconstituents thereof. A copy of such gas analysis shall be furnished to Lessor as\nobtained by Lessee if requested by Lessor. In the event that any distillate or other liquid\nhydrocarbons are contained In the gas stream of any gas well on this lease, In\ncommercial quantities, then lessee Is required to extract such liquid hydrocarbons on\nthis lease and to store and to sell and market the same separately from the gas\nproduction, paying Lessor's royalties thereon. In the event that the gas production\ncontains distillate, condensate, or other liquid hydrocarbons, or water, such gas\nproduction shall first be separated at the wellhead prior to measurement of such gas\nproductfon as provided above. All liquid hydrocarbons removed from the gas stream\nthrough such separator shall be stored In steel distillate or condensate tanks at each\nwell site and such liquid hydrocarbons shall be purchased by Lessee at the current\npricing provisions specified under subparagraph a) of this Article III, Lessee being\nrequired to pay and account to Lessor for Lessor's royalties on all of such separated and\nstored liquid hydrocarbons on a monthly basis. In the event that the gas .production\nfrom this lease needs to be compressed, the compression thereof shall occur through\nfac1l1tles located on this lease In a manner designed to maximize production. In the\nevent that Lessee drills and completes several wells on this lease, Lessee may provide\nfor one or more central facilities for heating, dehydration, separation and compression\nof such gas production with storage tanks for distillate or condensate being also located\nat such central facility, which central facility or central facilities, must In be located upon\nthis lease In a location to be deSignated by Lessor. Lessee shall be prohibited from\ncommingling of third party gas production through such proceSSing or central facilities.\nFurther, any gas produc.tlon which has a fractional 011 and gas royalty Interest p~yable\nto Lessor different from other 011 and gas production royalties payable to Lessor\nhereunder, shall require Lessee to separately process and meter such 011 and gas\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  984\n\fproduction upon thIs lease In whIch Lessor has a different net royalty Interest therein\nand account to Lessor, accordingly.\n\n        In addition, Lessor shall be authorized to Install and maintain Its own check\nmeter on any 011 or gas well upon such leased premIses, or on the sales meter of\nproduction from this lease, In order to verify the amount of productIon from any well or\nwells on this lease; provided that IF Lessor elects to Install theIr own check meter or\nmeters, such shall be Installed under the supelVlslon of an engineer and after thirty (30)\ndays' written notice to Lessee. In this connection, Lessee shall have the right to make\nsuch Installation Itself of Lessor's check meter or meters, In order that such Installation\ndoes not Interfere with Lessee's operations, provided such Installation Is performed by\nLessee pursuant to Lessor's speclflcatlons within a reasonable time, not exceeding thirty\n(30) days following written request of Lessor. calibration of such meter (whether one or\nmore), Its maintenance, Its charts, and computation of production, shall be perFormed\nby Lessor at Lessor's sole cost and expense. In this connection, If requested by Lessee,\nLessor shall calibrate any such meter In the presence of Lessee. All gas production from\nthis lease must be measured on thIs lease In the manner stated above prior to point of\nexit of such gas production from this lease. calculation of volume of gas production,\nadjusted for btu content at stated herein, for royalty payment purposes hereunder shall\nbe computed from such exit meter, (whether one or more) or the aggregate of all\nIndIvidual wellhead gas measurement meters at each gas wellhead on this lease,\nwhichever volume amount Is the greater.\n\n         (d) Lessee agrees that all other gas and Its constituents and products whIch do\n not extend to condensate covered by the preceding subparagraph c) of thIs Article fit\n:may be further processed by Lessee at a gas processing plant located off of this lease\n'and In such event, Lessee shall calculate and pay to Lessor, Its herein reselVed\n royalties, based upon the higher of the market value thereof or the price paId by such\n plant operator to Lessee herein for constItuents and products extracted from the gas\n stream and the .resIdue gas remaining after such extractton. Lessee Is prohibited from\n marketing gas production and Its products through a processing plant, as referred to\n hereIn, unless the combined royalties paid to Lessor for such plant products and residue\n gas, exceed the value of the royalties payable by Lessee to Lessor on the unprocessed\n gas stream from this lease as provided for under subparagraph (b) of Article III of thIs\n lease.\n\n       (e) Lessor and Lessee herein agree that Lessor reselVes and shall have the\ncontinuing option to take all or any part of'liNenty-five (25%) percent of all of the gas\nproduced from this lease In kind (such 25% of all gas production from this lease,\nsometimes referred to hereIn as \"Royalty Gas'1, and Lessor shall be entitled, upon not\nless than sIxty (60) days prIor written notice mailed to the Operator of the lease, to\nrequire that Lessee commence, as of the effectIve date and hour of Lessor's election,\ndelivering to the connecting gas gatherIng and transmission systems for the account of\nthe owners of the Royalty Gas or their designated marketer or purchaser or otherwise,\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              985\n\f   all of such designated volume of the subsequently accruing Royalty Gas, on a dally\n   basis, for such duration or period as Lessor designates in Its written notice to Lessee\n   (hereinafter called \"In kind ga5'1, which delivery Into such gas gathering and\n   transmission systems shall be made ratably and transported and delivered by the\n   Lessee and Its transporters In accordance with the Instructions of Lessor, or Lessor's\n   designated marketer or purchaser. Because all deliveries of Lessor's Royalty Gas are to\n   be made ratably, on a dally basis, with the volumes of gas actually being marketed and\n   delivered by Lessee to Lessor's purchaser, no gas Imbalances shall be permitted to\n   accrue as a result of Lessor's election to take Its Royalty Gas In kind.

My name is David Wrather. I am employed with Escondido Resources II, LLC\n(\"Escondido\") in the position of Senior Vice President. My position includes responsibility for\nland operations, including involvement in the negotiation of oil and gas leases on behalf of\nEscondido. I participated in the lease negotiations between Escondido and Justapor Ranch\nCompany, L.C. (\"Justapor\") for the lease of oil and gas interests on an 803-acre ranch owned by\nJustapor in Webb County, Texas (the \"Justapor Ranch\"). I negotiated the lease with James &.\nJones (\"Jones\") who I understood to be the owner of Justapor. As a result, I have personal\nknowledge of the facts set fOlih in this affidavit and they are true and conect.\n\n        2.     Jones contacted me in May, 2008, to inquire about Escondido's interest in leasing\nthe oil and gas minerals on the Justapor Ranch. Jones informed me that he was a lawyer in\nWebb County, Texas. Escondido did not have separate counsel representing it in the negotiation\nor execution of the lease between it and Justapor.\n\n        3.    On June 4, 2008, Jones e-mailed me a lease agreement form for the Justapor\nRanch. On June 6, 2008, I e-mailed Jones comments to the lease form and an example of a\nproposed royalty provision which Escondido had rccently used in another lease. A hue and\ncorrect copy of the e-mail chain and fOlm are attached to Escondido's response to Jones' Motion\nfor Summary Judgment (the \"Response\") at Exhibit 1.\n\n        4.      During our negotiations, I told Jones that Escondido wanted to base its royalty\npayment obligations upon the pricing (enns Escondido had negotiated with Enterprise for a gas\nsales agreement (the \"Enterprise Gas Sales Agreement\") as a minimum price that Escondido\nwould pay for purposes of royalty payments. On June 13, 2008, I e-mailed Jones the pricing\nterms we had negotiated with Enterprisc for thc paymcnt of gas. A true and correct copy of this\ne-mail is attached to the Response as Exhibit J. Jones infOlmed me that Justapor would agree to\nthe payment of royalty based upon the Enterprise pricing terms with Escondido, but not with any\nsubsequent assignee of Escondido. Jones informed me that Justapor wanted an amendment to\nthe proposed lease that would incorporate special pricing terms related to Escondido's price\narrangement with Enterprise. Jones provided me with a draft of the proposed amendment. On\n\n                                               1\n\n\n                                                                                                   1325\n                                            Ex. S\n\fJune 13, 2008, I e-mailed Jones connnents to the proposed amendment wherein I referenced in\nc()mlection with the pricing provision, \"as per Enterprise offer\". A hue and correct copy of this e-\nmail and the attached draft are attached to the Response as Exhibit K. Based upon my\ndiscussions and negotiations with Jones, the parties agreed that an amendment was to be drafted\nto provide a special royalty pricing provision, based upon the Enterprise price, that would be\navailable only to Escondido, and not any subsequent assignee.\n\n        5.     Escondido and Justapor entered into the oil and gas lease dated June 24, 2008,\ncovering the lease of minerals on the Justapor Ranch (the \"Lease Agreement\"). On the same\ndate, Escondido and Justapor also entered into an amendment to the Lease Agreement titled\n\"Amendment to Oil and Gas Lease\" (\"Amendment No. I \"). Based upon the negotiations and\nagreement reached with Jones, Escondido understood and believed Amendment No. I, and its\nspecial pricing provision, to be a replacement provision for the pricing provisions contained in\nAlticle III(b) of the Lease Agreement. The patties entered into Amendment No. I so that\nEscondido's royalty obligations under the Lease Agreement would correlate to the pricing terms\nof the Enterprise Gas Sales Agreement. At the time the Lease Agreement and Amendment No. I\nwere executed, Enterprise was the only market readily available to transpOit and purchase gas\nproduced from the Justapor Ranch.\n\n        6.     In order to sell gas produced fi'om the Justapor Ranch to Enterprise, Escondido\nneeded to constlUct a meter site on the Justapor Ranch and build a pipeline from the Justapor\nRanch across other adjacent propetties to a cOlll1ection point on the Enterprise System.\nEscondido acquired the right of way necessary to constlUct the pipeline. As part of this project,\nEscondido and Justapor executed a Surface Site Agreement which included a pipeline right of\nway and meter station surface site on the Justapor Ranch, a copy of which is attached to the\nResponse as Exhibit L. It was discussed with Jones that the Smface Site Agreement and pipeline\nwould be conveyed to Enterprise when the facilities were conshucted. Escondido did constlUct\nthe pipeline and ultimately assigned the Surface Site Agreement ,md pipeline to Enterprise with\nthe consent of Justapor, a copy of which is attached to the Response as Exhibit M.\n\n        7.     By 201 I, capacity constraints on the Enterprise pipeline system caused Entelprise\nto limit the volume of gas which was purchased fi'om Escondido, including gas produced fi'om\nthe Justapor Ranch. During this period of time, Escondido made sales of gas produced from the\nJustapor Ranch to an altemative market, Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, LLC (\"Kinder\nMorgan\"). Gas was delivered to Kinder Morgan via a gathering system installed by a new\nmidstream company that had entered the area, Meritage Midstream Services, LLC. Meritage\nacquired a meter site for their pipeline fi'om Justapor and acquired right of way to take\nEscondido's gas, including Justapor's gas, to Kinder Morgan.\n\n        8.     In October 2011, Enterprise informed Escondido that it had capacity available on\nits system, and intended to re-initiate gas purchases from the Justapor Ranch. The price which\nwould be realized from the sale of gas to Enterprise was greater than the price available from\nKinder Morgan. Escondido made plans and was prepared to sell gas from the Justapor Ranch to\nEnterprise. However, by letter dated October 19, 20ll, Jones communicated to Entelprise that\nthe Surface Site Agreement was terminated. Entelprise informed me that it could not purchase\ngas from the Justapor Ranch as a result of the termination notice sent to it by Jones and Jones\n\n\n                                                 2\n\n\n                                                                                                       1326\n\finformed me that he now owned the Enterprise meter and equipment located on the meter site.\nJones informed me that Escondido could not sell gas from the Justapor Ranch to Enterprise as a\nresult of the termination of the Surface Site Agreement. Because of the termination of the\nEnterprise Surface Site Agreement, the right of way and meter station on the Justapor Ranch\nwere not available to Enterprise to accept gas from the Justapor Ranch. Jones informed me that\nJustapor would negotiate with Entelprise for a new surface site agreement containing additional\nterms.\n\n        9.      During the same period of time, Escondido was attempting to access additional\nmarkets for gas produced from the Justapor Ranch. Escondido negotiated processing contracts\nwith ConocoPhillips Company (dated September 1,2011) and Copano Processing, L.P. (dated\nOctober 25,2011), and expected these additional markets to be available by the end of 2011 or\nearly 2012. Escondido also believed, based upon Jones' statements regarding negotiations with\nEnterprise, that a new surface site agreement would soon be executed again providing Escondido\nwith access to the Enterprise market. Each of these alternative markets was expected to provide\na higher price for the Justapor Ranch gas than that available from Kinder Morgan, due in part to\nprocessing capability. As a result of the timing ofthe termination of the Surface Site Agreement,\nand the expected availability of markets fi'om Copano and ConocoPhillips in the near future,\nEscondido decided to shut-in the wells on the Justapor Ranch until those higher-priced markets\nbecame available. I informed Jones that Escondido wanted to shut-in the wells on the Justapor\nRanch nntil higher-price markets became available. The only shOlt-term market available to\nEscondido at that point in time, due to the termination of the Surface Site Agreement with\nEnterprise, was sales to Kinder Morgan based upon a daily spot price. At that point in time, the\ndaily spot price was lower than the price which would have been paid by Entelprise if the\nSurface Site Agreement had not been tClminated, and lower than the price Escondido expected to\nreceive in the future for sales to Copano and ConocoPhillips. Jones directed me to continue sales\nand not shut-in the wells. I explained to him that Escondido wanted to sell gas to Entelprise and\nbelieved that Jones and Enterprise were working on resolving their issues and that Escondido\nwould rather shut-in the wells rather than sell the gas at the lower gas daily spot price, without\nprocessing. Jones stated that he wanted Escondido to proceed with sales, even though processing\nwas not available.\n\n         10.   Also in 2011, a disagreement arose between Escondido and Justapor over the\ncalculation of a compensatory royalty payment relating to a well drilled on propelty adjacent to\nthe Justapor Ranch. There were also issues outstanding between the patties related to drilling\ncOllllnitments under the Lease Agreement; a working interest owned by another Jones entity,\nJAK Passive Minerals, L.C.; and mineral interests owned by third parties on a portion of acreage\nwithin the Justapor Ranch referred to by the parties as the \"Vacancy Tract\". Each of these issues\nwas addressed in a letter agreement entered into between Escondido and Justapor dated August\n9,2011 (the \"Letter Agreement\").\n\n       II.      Since execution of the Letter Agreement, Escondido has supplied Jones with\nexecuted deeds conveying all mineral interests owned by Escondido at that time, or subsequently\nacquired, for the Vacancy Tract. Escondido is not cUlTently the owner of any mineral interests in\nthe Vacancy Tract or the Justapor Ranch which has not been previously conveyed to Justapor or\nanother entity owned or controlled by Jones as a result of deeds signed and delivered by\n\n\n                                                3\n\n\n                                                                                                     1327\n\fEscondido to Jones. It was never discussed, contemplated, 01' agreed that Escondido would\nconvey any leasehold interest which it currently holds on the Justapor Ranch in connection with\nthe Letter Agreement.\n\n        12.    Also in May, 2008, Escondido was attempting to secure leases of minerals on\nother propelties in the Webb County area. In particular, Escondido was negotiating to obtain a\nmineral lease from William S. Hatte (the \"Harte Lease\") and one other propelty. These other\nleasing negotiations were underway in the same period of time during which Escondido was also\nengaged in negotiations with Jones for a mineral lease on the Justapor Ranch.\n\n        13.     In late May, 2008, Escondido sent leasing proposals for two negotiations it was\nengaged in, one of which was the Harte Lease. In early June, 2008, and prior to the execution of\nthe Justapor Lease, Jones informed me that he could represent Escondido in cOllllection with its\nleasing efforts in Webb County. I informed Jones of Escondido's interest in acquiring the Harte\nLease and, at least, one other. Jones informed me thaI he knew the parties involved with both\nlease negotiations and that he could represent Escondido in negotiating and securing the Harte\nlease. On June 10,2008, I e-mailed Jones with the terms of the lease offer Escondido had made\nin connection with one of the negotiations. A hue and COHect copy of the e-mail transmitting the\nBenavides Lease offer and the offer itself are attached to Escondido's Response to the Lawyer\nJones Motion for Summary Judgment (the \"Lawyer Jones Response\") as Exhibit Y (filed under\nseal). Negotiations on that Lease did not progress beyond the preliminary stage. However,\nEscondido continued negotiations in connection with the Harte Lease.\n\n         14.    Between June 10,2008, and June 16,2008, Jones and I discussed the terms under\nwhich Jones would undertake the representation of Escondido in connection with the Harte\nLease. Jones informed me that he would represent Escondido in connection with its effOlts to\nnegotiate and acquire the Harte Lease in exchange for the payment to Jones of a fee in the form\nof an overriding royalty interest on the Hatte Lease if the negotiations lead to the execution of a\nlease. Jones informed me that in exchange for Escondido's agreement to pay an overriding\nroyalty interest, he would represent Escondido in connection with the Harte Lease. On June 16,\n2008, I spoke with others at Escondido regarding the payment of an overriding royalty interest to\nJones as requested for his legal services. After these discussions, I e-mailed Jones on June 16,\n2008, confirming Escondido's agreement to engage Jones in connection with obtaining and\nnegotiating the Hatte Lease and Escondido's agreement to pay Jones an overriding royalty\ninterest. Exhibit Z to the Lawyer Jones Response is a true and conect copy of an e-mail\nexchange between me and Jones dated June 16,2008 through June 17,2008. The first e-mail in\nthis exchange on June 16, 2008, is the e-mail setting out the tenns of Escondido's engagement of\nJones. On June 17, 2008, Jones e-mailed me a request to send him a copy of Escondido's\nproposal for the Harte Lease as referenced in Exhibit Z, which I did. Jones' e-mail also requested\nthat I call him. I telephoned Jones on the 17th at which time we discussed his representation of\nEscondido in connection with the Harte Lease and the terms of the overriding royalty interest\nwhich Escondido had agreed to pay Jones in connection with that representation. Jones stated he\nwould represent Escondido in connection with the Hade Lease. At no time did Jones infonll me\nthat he had not agreed to undertake any representation of Escondido as of that time. As a result\nof my conversations with Jones, I understood and believed him to be engaged at that time as\nEscondido's counsel in cOlmection with the Harte Lease and other potential leasing effOlts. Jones\n\n\n                                                4\n\n\n                                                                                                      1328\n\fconfIrmed this understanding during out' conversation of June 17, 2008, when the Harte Lease\nproposal was discussed, Jones never advised me during this time period that he had not agreed\nto represent Escondido, There was no subsequent telephone conversation during the months of\nJuly 01' August, 2008, during which Jones told me he had decided to represent Escondido, I am\naware of no other writing between myself or others at Escondido, on the one hand, and Joncs, on\nthe other hand, constituting an engagement agreement for Jones other than the e-mail of June 16,\n2008, marked as Exhibit Z to the Lawyer Jones Response,\n\n        15,    Jones did proceed to represcnt Escondido as its attorncy in cOlUlection with the\nHarte Lease, Exhibit AA to the Lawyer Jones Response is a copy of a July 23, 2008 e-mail I\nsent Jones containing information related to Harte's legal representative, On June 24, 2008, I\nsent Mr, Harte an email (Exhibit FF to the Lawyer Jones Response) informing him that Jones\nwas representing Escondido and to expect a call from him, Exhibit BB to the Lawyer Jones\nResponse is an e-mail sent to me by Jones relaying to me information regarding his\nconversations wlth Harte's attorney and the status of negotiations, Exhibit CC to the Lawyer\nJones Response is an e-mail from Jones to me dated January 7, 2009, setting fOlih his opinions\nregarding the terms of the proposed Harte Lease, Exhibits DD and EE to the Lawyer Jones\nResponse are e-mails from Jones to me dated Jammry 7, 2009, wlth redlined comments to the\nproposed Harte Lease,\n\n        16,     At no time did Jones advise me that Escondido should engage separate counsel in\nconnection with the negotiation and execution of the Lease Agreement. At no time did Jones\nrequest 01' obtain Escondido's written consent to his representation of Escondido at the same time\nhe was negotiating with Escondido the Lease Agreement for the Justapor Ranch,\n\n         17,     While we were negotiating the Lease Agreement for the Justapor Ranch, Jones\ntold me that he had drafted a tough agreement in case Escondido ever assigned its rights under\nthe Lease Agreement to another party, but that he would work out with Escondido any issues\nWllich might arise, Based upon this conversation, and the fact that Jones was acting as\nEscondido's attol'lley, I assumed that any disagreements which might arise between Escondido\nand Justapor would be resolved through a negotiation process, During lease negotiations, Jones\nand I never discussed his interpretation of pricing provision III(b)(iv) of the Lease Agreement.\nWe also did not discuss the termination provision contained in Article XIV, I did request one\nchange to the annual certification requirement contained in Article III(g); however, Jones and I\nnever discussed his understanding or interpretation of Article III(g) insofar as it relates to the\nobligation to make allllualrcconciliation payments, Prior to this lawsuit, Jones never informed\nme that it was his position 01' Justapor's position that the Lease Agreement would terminate if\nthere were ever an underpayment of royalties which was not correctly and fully reconciled and\npaid by March I of the succeeding year, Jones never informed me that it was his position or\nJustapor's position that the Lease Agreement would terminate if there was an underpayment of\nroyalties, Jones never informed me of his 01' Justapor's interpretations of the pricing provisions\nin Article III of the Lease Agreement as asselied in this lawsuit, If, prior to the execution of the\nLease Agreement, Jones had informed me of the interpretation and construction being advanced\nby him and Justapor in this case, I would not have agreed to the Lease Agreement without further\nclarification 01' modification, In particular, Escondido would not have agreed to the pricing\nprovision contained in Article III(b) of the Lease Agreement if it were not modified by\n\n                                                5\n\n                                                                                                   1329\n\fAmendment No. 1 as Escondido understood based on its conversations with Jones. Escondido\nwould not have agreed to a lease which provided a remedy for underpayment of royalty as\nargued by Justapor in this case. Escondido would not have agreed to a lease which provided for\ntermination for a failure to reconcile an alleged royalty underpayment as argued by Justapor in\nthis case. None of these arguments 01' interpretations was explained to me by Jones prior to\nexecution of the Justapor Lease.\n\n\n       FURTHER AFFIANT SAYETH NOT.\n\n\n                                                   David Wrather\n\n\nSUBSCRIBED and SWORN to before me this the        ~;\\I day of Sf PTLMlSy;R         ,2014.\n\n\n\n                       CTRAVIS WAlNE               Notary Public, State of Texas\n                     My Comml&slon Expires\n                       January 25.2016\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\n\n                                                                                                  1330\n\f                                                                                                                  Filed\n                                                                                                  9/5/2014 3:46:44 PM\n                                                                                                     Esther Degollado\n                                                                                                         District Clerk\n                                                                                                         Webb District\n                                                                                                 2013-cv7 -001396-D1\n\n                                    NO.2013-CV7-001396-DI\n\nJUSTAPOR RANCH COMPANY, L.C.,                 §       IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF\n     Plaintiff,                               §\n                                              §\nV.                                            §       WEBB COUNTY, TEXAS\n                                              §\n                                              §\nESCONDIDO RESOURCES II, LLC,                  §\n     Defendant.                               §       49th JUDICIAL DISTRICT\n\n                               AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN S.

Lowe, who after being h me duly sworn, stated under oath:\n\n     1. My name is John S. Lowe. I am the George W. Hutchison ProfeSl;or of Energy Law at\n Southern Methodist University's Dedman School of Law. I have more than 35 years' experience\nteaching courses on issues related to property law, oil and gas law, and oil and gas contracts. I\nam also an attorney and member of the bars of Texas, Oklahoma, and Ohio. I am Past President\nof the Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Foundation, and Past Chair of the Section of\nEnvironmental, Encrgy, and Resources Law of the American Bar Association. I have published\nnumerous atiicles dealing with oil and gas contracts. I have also written, or co-written with\nothers, books on oil and gas leases and contracts. I often present lectures and papers on issues\nrelated to oil and gas leases and contract~. Additional information regarding my experience and\nqualifications is set out in my resume, a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as\nExhibit I and incorporated herein by reference. I am familiar with and have an understanding of\nthe customary terms used in oil and gas lease agreements, and industry custom, practicc, and\nusage in applying those terms. I have specialized knowledge, skill, education, and experience\nregarding oil and gas lease provisions and issues related to the custom, usage, and practice in the\noil and gas industry related to provisiops in oil and gas leases, including but not limited to\nroyalty-calculation provisions, royalty-payment provisions, and audit provisions. I have\nreviewcd the oil and gas lease dated June 24, 2008 (the \"Lease\") that is the subject of this lawsuit\nalong with amendments thereto including the Amendment to Oil and Gas Lease dated June 24,\n2008 (\"Amendment No. I \"). I have also reviewed Plaintiffs First Amended Petition and exhibits\nthereto; deposition testimony of Jimmy K. Jones, David Wrather, William Deupree, Kurt von\nPlonski, and Charlie E. Graham; Plaintiffs Designation of Expert Witnesses; Escondido's\nDesignations of Expert Witnesses; Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment; and, deposition\nexhibits 2A, 2B, 3, 11,42,48,57,59,61,62,64,69, and 74. I have personal knowledge of the\nfacts set forth herein, and am competent to testifY thereto. The facts stated in this affidavit are\ntrue atld correct.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  1\n                                            Ex. F                                                  1136\n\f     2. Article III(b)(iv) of the Lease is not a customary or usual royalty provision. This\nprovision is unclear and ambiguous. A tyPical lessee in the oil and gas industry would not know\nhow to apply this provision to the calculation of royalty payments. Unlike the other royalty\nprovisions contained in the Lease, there is no defined term or definition for the meaning of\nroyalty provision (iv). Justapor, in the deposition of James K. Jones, contends that royalty-\nprovision (iv) contains an error in that the word \"were\" should be \"where.\" Even if the word\n\"were\" was changed to \"where,\" royalty-provision (iv) would remain unclear and ambiguous. As\ndrafted, pricing-provision (iv) could be interpreted in alternative ways by a typical industry\nlessee. The uncertainlY and lack of clarity with regard to the meaning of royalty provision (iv) is\nincreased by Amendment No. 1. In this instance, it appears Amendment No. I was executed\nsimultaneous to the Lease in order to afford the lessee, Escondido Resources II, L.L.C.\n(\"Escondido\"), with a special pricing provision available only to it, and not to subsequent\nassignees. Escondido appears to have operated with the understanding that the provisions of\nparagraph 2 of Amendment No. 1 amending Article III of the Lease provided an alternative\nroyalty methodology that supplanted each of the four royalty provisions contained in Article\nIII(b) of the Lease. It is reasonable and consistent with industry custom and practice for\nEscondido to pay royalties in a manner consistent with this interpretation and wlderstanding of\nthe effect of Amendment No.1 on the Lease royalty-payment provisions.\n\n    3. Industry custom and practice would apply the termination clause contained in Article\nXIV of the Lease only to non-payment of royalty. The termination clause would not apply to\nImderpayment or miscalculation of royalty. The industry differentiates royalty non-payment\nfrom royalty underpayment. It is unusual, but not unheard of, to have lease provisions calling for\ntemlination if a royalty is not paid. But it is unheard of to have a termination provision in the\nevent of an underpayment. The industry does not consider non-payment of royalty to be the same\nas an underpayment of royalty. An unqerpayment is an underpayment, not a non-payment; in\nother words, if there is an underpayment, a subsequent failure to correct the llilderpayment does\nnot change the nature of the underpayment to a non-payment of royalty. Because the termination\nprovision contained in Article XIV does not expressly apply to the underpayment of royalties, it\nalso does not apply to a failure to correct an underpayment of royalty through a review or\nreconciliation process. A11icle XIV does not condition the continuation of the Lease on the\ncorrection of any or all royalty underpayments by March 1 of the succeeding calendar year.\nIndustry custom and practice does not consider royalty underpayments to be the same as a failure\nto pay royalty. Likewise, industry custom and practice would not consider a failure to reconcile\na royalty underpayment by March I of the succeeding year to be a non-payment of royalty. It is\nnot usual or customary to have a lease-termination clause for underpayment of royalties or for\nthe failure to correct or reconcile an underpayment.\n\n    4. Article XIV of the Lease states it does not apply in the event of a title dispute or title\ndefect. That \"carve out\" is included because it is industry custom and practice to hold payment\nof royalties \"in suspense\" when there is a title dispute or title defect. The carve out for a title\ndispute or title defect protects the lessee from termination for non-payment of royalty if there is a\nsuspension due to a title issue. The inclusion of the carve-out language for title disputes and\ndefects further evidences that the intent of the parties was that the termination provision\ncontained in Article XIV would apply to instances of non-payment, rather than instances of\nunderpayment. This is consistent with industry custom and practice.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n                                                                                                    1137\n\f    5. Article III(g) of the Lease calls for the lessee to review prices and production volumes\nused in its calculation of royalty payments against the price and production volumes required to\nbe paid under the terms of the lease by January 31 of each year, and to issue make up payments\nfor the difference on or before March 1 of each year. From an industry custom and practice\npoint of view, Escondido appears to have complied with this provision through its periodic\nmonitoring of prices and volumes throughout the course of the year, and through its periodic\nreconciliation payments made to the lessor.\n\n    6. The reconciliation provision contained in paragraph IIl(g) deals with underpayments of\nroyalties. Article JII(g) does not contain any term or condition which would terminate the Lease\nin the event lessee fails to correct any underpayment of royalties by the date set forth therein.\nThis is consistent with industry custom and usage. It is not be customary nor usual to apply a\nremedy of termination to a failure to correct royalty underpayments. Industry custom and usage\nwould not consider the provisions of Article XIV dealing with non-payment of royalties to be\ntriggered by any non-compliance with the provisions of Atiicle IIl(g) dealing with reconciliation\npayments.\n\n     7. Industry custom and usage would not interpret a provision relating to the \"true up\" or\nreconciliation of royalty underpayments such as is contained in paragraph III(g) to constitute a\nlease-termination event. In the lessorllessee context, there are frequently misunderstandings,\nissues, disagreements, and disputes relating to the prices and volumes used to make royalty\npayments, and applying a termination provision to underpayment of royalties in these sorts of\ncircumstances is not customary or usual. A lessee would be placed in an untenable position if it\nwas at risk of losing its lease in the event of disagreement about the methodology, pricing, or\nvolumes to be used in royalty calculations, or, if it made a mistake. The lessor would effectively\nbe able to blackmail a lessee, or conduct audits looking for any type of uncorrected\nunderpayment in order to declare a lease terminated. The industry does not conduct business in\nthis manner.\n\n    8. Applying industry custom and Practice, it appears Escondido acted reasonably in its\ncalculation and payment of royalties. The alleged underpayments at issue in this case appear to\nhave been made using accepted industry practices for the making of royalty payments and appear\nto have been done in compliance with at least one of the pricing prongs made the subject of the\nroyalty-payment provisions and Amendment No. 1. Escondido's conduct in making the royalty\npayments in this fashion would not be considered to have been done in \"bad faith\" from an\nindustry point of view and standard, but instead appear to have been made in good faith.\n\n    9. The parties included specific termination provisions in the Lease at Aliicles X and XIV.\nArticle X allows for tetmination in the event lessee is not conducting \"operations\" in compliance\nwith the terms of the Lease and fails to correct such non-compliance following notice by lessor.\nLikewise, as set forth above, the provisions of Article XIV relate to termination for the non-\npayment of royalties, not the underpayment of royalties. The inclusion of these two termination\nprovisions in the Lease coupled with the fact that the Lease does not contain a provision that\ncalls for termination in the event of an underpayment of royalties or a failure to correct an\nunderpayment of royalties suggests that the intent of the parties was not to include an\nunderpayment of royalties or a failure to correct a royalty underpayment as a terminable event.\nThis is consistent with industry practice.\n\n\n\n\n                                               3\n                                                                                                    1138\n\f    10. According to the deposition testimony and reports of other experts, Escondido has\ninvested over $30 million making improvement associated with the Lease. Applying a\ntermination clause to the underpayment of royalties as presented by the circumstances of this\ncase would, under industry standards, impose a harsh, unusual, disadvantageous, costly, unfair,\nand unreasonable consequence upon Escondido.\n\n     II. Forfeiture is a harsh remedy. It is the usual and customary practice in the industry to\nspecify, with clarity, the terms tmder which a lease may terminate. In the absence of an express\nand specific provision, industry practice would not consider an act or omission of the lessee to be\na termination event. In this case, the plain language of Article XIV addresses temlination for the\nnonpayment of a royalty. Article XIV does not expressly or specifically provide for termination\ndue to underpayment of a royalty or a failure to reconcile an underpayment. Similarly, Article\nXIV does not provide for termination of the lease agreement when there is it dispute between the\nlessee and the lessor regarding the calculation of royalty payments.\n\n    12. The oil and gas industry recognizes the \"doctrine of obstmction,\" which includes an\nimplied covenant on the part of the lessor not to interfere with the lessee's performance of the\nlease agreement. In this case, testimony indicates that the lessor's termination of the Enterprise\nsurface-site lease prevented Escondido fwm selling to the high-priced Enterprise market. If the\nlessor's termination was not done in accordance with the surface-site lease, then the termination\nwas not proper and may have prevented Escondido from achieving a higher price for pwduction.\nSuch conduct would be inconsistent with and contrary to the implied covenant on the part of the\nlessor arising under the \"doctrine of obstmction.\"\n\n   FURTHER AFFIANT SA YETH NOT.\n\n\n                                               ~.c-)\n     .9,.,.,J;UBSCRlBED AND SWORN TO BEFORE ME, the undersigned authority, on this\nthty<.:_~_':t day of August, 2014, to certify which witness my hand and seal of office.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 MARIANNE HUNT\n                                                                 NoIary Pubic.

Additional information\nregarding my qualifications is set out in my resume, a tme and correct copy of which is included\nin Exhibit I attached hereto. I have personal knowledge of the facts set fOlth hcrein, and alll\ncompetent to testilY thereto.\n    2. Attached as Exhibit 1 to my affidavit is a true and correct copy of my report prepared in\nthis case.\n\n    3. I have calculated the royalties Escondido paid Justapor in cOllllection with the Lease\nAgreement. Escondido paid Justapol' $5,749,323 in royalty payments for production under the\npal1ies' Lease Agreement from June, 2009, through April, 2014.\n\n    4. According to the expert l'epOli prepared by Chal'les E. Graham, Ill, Escondido allegedly\n\"underpaid\" Justapol' royalties totaling $80,958. This alleged \"underpayment\" represents 1.4%\nof total royalties paid to Justapol' dUl'ing the period of time set forth in the preceding paragraph.\nMr. Graham alleges royalties in the amount of $3,851 were underpaid for the months of October,\n20 II, November, 2011, and Januaty, 2012. This amount represents 0.00067 of the total royalty\npaid.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   1\n                                             Ex.

Escondido incurred $33,100,287 of costs on capital\n improvements to the propel1y which is the subject of the pat1ies' Lease Agreement.\n\n    6. Article III and Article XIV ofthe Lease Agreement both address royalties; however, they\naddress two different accounting aspects of royalty payment. Al1iclc III of the parties' Lease\nAgreement addresses the accounting of how to calculate royalty and when to make adjustments\nto the royalty calculation. Article XIV of the Lease Agreement addresses the accounting of\nwhen royalty payments are to be paid to the lessor. At1icle lU(g) describes when to make\nadjustments, 01' \"hue-ups\" to the royalty calculation. Article III does not call for the Lease\nAgreement to terminate if adjustments are not identified by lessee and processed by March I of\nthe succeeding year. It is common in the oil and gas industry for companies to periodically\nreview royalty calculations and to make hue-up payments. It is also common for producers to\nreceive adjustments from purchasers that impact the volume or the price upon which the royalty\npayment was based. These adjllstments may be received numerous months following the initial\nroyalty payment and require the company to make a tme up payment to the royalty owner.\n\n     7. At-ticle XIV describes the timing of when the royalty payment is due, for both existing\nand first production, and describes the consequences for not making the royalty payment.\nSpecifically, Article XIV states \"Royalties payable to Lessor in the malmer hereinabove provided\nfor are due and payable to Lessor within a period of sixty (60) days following each month's\nproduction of oil 01' gas produced and sold from the premises\". Unlike At1icle III(g), which\ndescribes the manner and timing to account for potential adjustments to royalty, At1icle XIV\ndescribes when the initial payment on monthly production should be accounted for to the royalty\nowner and the penalty for a delinquent payment. In other words, it addresses lIOn-payment of the\nroyalty in a timely manner. The reference to a title dispute 01' defect demonstrates this point. If a\ntitle dispute 01' a title defect exists, royalty payments are typically not paid and are instead\naccounted for as \"suspense\" and held accordingly until the title matter can be resolved. In such\ncircumstances, Article XIV provides an exception for non-payment of royalty on a timely basis.\nThe lease termination clause contained in Article XIV is tied to the monthly production and\nrequirement to pay royalty within 60 days following each month's production. Underpayments\nand adjustments to underpayments are not addressed in Al1icle XIV.\n\n    8. I have reviewed the royalty payment information related to the pat1ies' Lease Agreement.\nProduction under the Lease Agreement began during June, 2009. Escondido has routinely made\nroyalty payments to Justapor for production since that time. Additionally, Escondido has made\ntrue-up 01' reconciliation payments to Justapor over the life of the Lease Agreement. Escondido\nmade 15 true-up or reconciliation payments to Justapor fl'om September, 2009, through June,\n2014, totaling $441,596.\n\n    9. Escondido's interpretation of the methodology for royalty payment calculation is\nreasonable. David Wrather of Escondido testified that he believed Alnendment No. 1 to the\nLease Agreement replaced the entire pricing provision contained in Article III of the Lease\nAgreement so that the pricing provision would mirror the Enterprise contract and limit\nEscondido's royalty exposure to what it was receiving fi'om Enterprise. Lease agreements often\ncontain language providing that royalties will be paid based on the lessee's proceeds. Oil and gas\ncompanies generally strive to align their cash outflows (in this case royalty payments), to their\n\n\n\n                                                 2                                                      1149\n\f cash inflow (in this case gas sales). Gas accounting involves many complexities, and companies\n generally desire to pay royalties bused on the same pricc which the company sold the gas to a\n third party.\n\n     10. The royalty pricing provisions in the, tease Agreement are not entirely clear. Article\nIII(b) of the Lease Agreement, as it reads without Amendment No.1, sets f011h a royalty pricing\nmethodology calling for gas royalties to paid at the highest of:\n\n        (i)     Current Market Value\n\n        (ii)    Current Houston Ship Channel Price\n\n        (iii)   Current Proceeds Realized by Lessee, 01'\n\n        (iv)    The highest sales price of any gas were gas produced from the property\n                could be present when sold to a third pat1y.\n\nOil and gas leases commonly include pricing provisions based on current market value, the\nHOllston Ship Channel Price and/or cllrrent proceeds. Even so, the Lease Agreement goes on to\nprovide definitions of each of three terms. An accountant can detemline the value associated\nwith each of these provisions. However, the fourth provision appears unclear, but the Lease\nAgreement does not define this provision.\n\n    11. Amendment No. 1 to the Lease Agreement sets forth pricing amendments to Article III of\nthe Lease Agreement. Amendment No. 1 includes a paragraph that addresses the Houston Ship\nChannel Price. At the end of this pat'agraph, a provision states, in patt:\n\n       \"provided, however, Lessee shall have the right to enter into gas sales contracts\n       that will determine the price upon which gas royalty is calculated if such contracts\n       provide no less than a price redetermination every six months and provide the\n       following minimum terms:\"\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the \"Pricing Provision\").\n\nAlthough the Pricing Provision is inclUded in the satUe section that describes the Houston Ship\nChannel Price, Mr. Wrather testified that he believed the Pricing Provision replaced the royalty\npricing terms :110m the Lease Agreement. Interpreting the Pricing Provision to only relate to the\nHoustoll Ship Channel Price, as Justapor contends, appears to bhu' the meaning of the pricing\npoints contained in Alticle Ill(b) of the Lease Agreement. Accountants are routinely required to\nread and apply oil and gas royalty pricing terms in leases. The language in Amendment No. I\nthat describes the circumstances of the Pricing Provision is describing a current proceeds\ncircumstance. Therefore, if the Pricing Provision in Amendment No. I amends the entire royalty\npricing terms set forth in the Lease Agreement, as testified to by MI'. Wrather, royalties would be\ncalculated based upon the CUI'rcnt proceeds so long as the sales price is greater than the minimum\nprice set forth in the Pricing Provision. This interpretation allows each pricing point to\nconcurrently exist in the Lease Agreement, as atllended. However, if the Pricing Provision\napplies only 10 the Houston Ship Chanllel Price, then the Pricing Provision is stating that the\ncurrent proceeds can be paid instead of the Houston Ship Chmmel Price. Further, if such currcnt\n\n\n\n                                                  3                                                   1150\n\fproceeds are received from a third party at an arms-length basis, then those proceeds represent a\nmarket value transaction. Thus, if the Pricing Provision only applies to the Houston Ship\nChannel Price, then the Houston Ship Channel Price would be the same as currcnt proceeds and\nwould be the same as market value price. This intelpretation appears to blur the distinction of\nthe pricing points and appears to create two different definitions of current proceeds.\n\n     12. The affidavit of Charles E. Graham, III and the copy of his report attached thereto, both\nincluded as Exhibit F to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, sets out alleged trespass\ndamages in the amount of $10,413,114 from March 2, 2012, to Feb11lary 28, 2014, or\nalternatively, $4,825,866 from March 2,2013, to February 28, 2014. According to the Graham\nreport, these numbers are calculated based on \"net proceeds\" but subtract only royalties and taxes\npaid from gross proceeds. The amounts set fOlih by MI'. Graham in his affidavit and report do\nnot account for other operating costs incurred by Escondido. An acc\\ll'ate calculation of the\nvalue of the net proceeds to Escondido would include a reduction for the costs associated with\nproduction. Taking into account the operating costs incuned, the actual value of the net\nproceeds realized by Escondido was $6,671,268 from March, 2012, to February, 2014, and\n$2,820,095 from March, 2013, through February, 2014. A monthly breakdown of these amounts\nis set forth in my report attached hereto as Exhibit I.\n     13. The Graham report alleges royalties were underpaid in the amount of $77,107 for the\ntime period of February, 2012, through January, 2013. It appears the Graham repoli does not\nconsider two factors relating to the calculation of this amount. First, the Graham report does not\naccount for the time period from February 1,2012, tlU'ough February 21, 2012, when Escondido\nwas selling gas only to Kindel' Morgan. Instead, the Gmham report calculates an alleged\nunderpayment related to Escondido's use of a weighted average price for the entire month,\nthereby applying the higher Conoco sales price to the time period during which Escondido was\nnot selling to Conoco. Second, it appears that the Graham report does not consider the difference\nbetween the entrained NGL mix that exists in the Justapor gas stream and the NGL composition\nof the co-mingled gas stream delivered to Conoeo for processing. I have calculated adjustments\nto the alleged underpayment for the two above factors, which result in a decrease of more than\n$55,000 to the alleged underpayment amount of $77, 107. A similar adjustment may be in order\nfor the entmined NGL mix of sales to Copano.\n\n   14. The facts stated in this affidavit are true and correct.\n   FURTHER AFFIANT SA YETH NOT.\n\n\n                                               William BAbington\n\n        SUBSCRIBED AND SWORN TO BEFORE ME, the undersigned authorHy, on this\nthe :') ~ day of September, 2014, to certify which witness my hand and seal of office.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n                                                                                                     1151\n\f                                                                                                                  Filed\n                                                                                                  9/5/2014 3:46:44 PM\n                                                                                                     Esther Degollado\n                                                                                                         District Clerk\n                                                                                                         Webb District\n                                                                                                 2013-cv7 -001396-D1\n\n\n\n\n                                (\n\n\n\n\nEscondido Resources II, llC\n526 Kingwood Drive, /1353\nKingwood, Texas 77339\n(lSl) 359-6780 oHice\n(281) 361·6780 fax\nblll@es(:ondldo·resources,com\n\nAugust 9, 2011\n\nMr. James I<.

Joint venturer filed\ncounterclaims and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Parties entered into a memorandum\nof settlement agreement (MSA). Joint venturer then added claim of fraudulent inducement to\nenter the MSA. Following directed verdict against developer on all claims, and jury trial on\njoint venturer's claims, the 201st District Court, Travis County, Suzanne Covington, J., entered\njudgment for venturer on fraudulent inducement claim and awarded declaratory and injunctive\nrelief and attorney fees for breach of JVA. Developer appealed. The Amarillo Court of Appeals,\nMackey K. Hancock, J., 253 S.W.3d 728, reversed and rendered. Review was granted.\n\n\n\nHoldings: The Supreme Court held that:\n\n[1] developer's assignment of right, title, and interest in joint venture was a security interest and,\ntherefore, did not divest developer of its interest;\n\n[2] evidence supported finding of developer's intent not to perform the MSA; and\n\n[3] evidence supported an award of damages, but not amount awarded.\n\n\nAffirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\n\n\n West Headnotes (20)\n\n\n [1]     Damages         Nature and theory of compensation\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Rancho took out a $2.4 million loan from OmniBank\nto develop the property, with Turner as the guarantor. Problems arose during the development,\nso OmniBank required Rancho to bring in a new partner before it would continue financing.\nA Rancho employee put Turner in touch with Eddie Jones who agreed to a joint venture. For\npurposes of the joint venture, Jones established Aquaplex, Inc. Rancho and Aquaplex (through\ntheir representatives Turner and Jones) then signed the Tumbleweed Investment Joint Venture\nAgreement (JVA), which included the following provisions:\n\n   • Contributions: Rancho would contribute the property and existing project; Aquaplex would\n      contribute $400,000.\n\n    *771 • Loans: Only Rancho and the property remained responsible for the existing $2.4 million\n      OmniBank loan—Aquaplex had no liability. Aquaplex also made a $644,000 loan to the joint\n      venture, with repayment priority second only to the OmniBank loan.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 89\n\n\n   • Ownership Interest: Aquaplex—60%; Rancho—40%.\n\n   • Management: Aquaplex would be managing partner and would be paid up to a $6,000 monthly\n      management fee. Aquaplex could make all but “major decisions” without Rancho's approval.\n      One “major decision” was selling any of the development's properties for less than $60,000\n      per unit. Even in a major decision, however, a partner could not unreasonably withhold its\n      approval.\n\n   • Cash Calls: Aquaplex, as managing partner, could issue a cash call when needed and both\n     partners would be responsible for their pro-rata share. If a partner failed to comply with the\n     cash call, then the other partner could either contribute the amount, loan the joint venture the\n     amount, or could seek to dissolve the joint venture.\n\n   • Third-party Offers: On an offer of purchase by a third-party of the property, either party that\n      dissented to the sale could make a matching offer to buy the property. If no offer was made,\n      the sale would go through.\n\nDisputes between Aquaplex and Rancho arose soon after the JVA was signed. Aquaplex\nterminated the project manager and took over the day-to-day management. Aquaplex also\ndemolished the clubhouse, which Rancho had already completed. Aquaplex then issued a cash\ncall under the terms of the JVA, but Rancho refused to contribute. Rancho sued Aquaplex,\nalleging fraud, breach of duties under the JVA, and conversion and destruction of partnership\nassets. Rancho claimed that Aquaplex overstated the budgetary needs that led to the cash call and\nwas needlessly destroying property. Aquaplex counter-claimed, alleging frivolous suit, negligent\nmisrepresentation, fraud, breach of the JVA, and breach of warranty. Aquaplex claimed that, prior\nto the JVA, Rancho misrepresented the status of the project and Rancho's own financial ability to\nmeet continuing financial obligations. In the meantime, Rancho's loan with OmniBank went into\ndefault, causing concerns about a potential foreclosure.\n\nThe parties proceeded to mediation. They entered into a Rule 11 memorandum of settlement\nagreement (MSA), which envisioned selling the property or ending the joint venture within six\nmonths. The terms of the MSA provided that:\n\n   • OmniBank would roll all existing interest into the note and extend it for six months.\n\n   • Rancho would deposit $100,000 into an OmniBank account to pay all interest, taxes, and\n     expenses on the property for those six months.\n\n   • The property would be listed for six months at $5 million, but that the property could be sold\n      at any price exceeding $4 million. Rancho retained a right of first refusal on any offer.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 7\n\fAquaplex, Inc. v. Rancho La Valencia, Inc., 297 S.W.3d 768 (2009)\n53 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 89\n\n\n   • Rancho could acquire Aquaplex's interest in the joint venture for $1,645,425 (the approximate\n      amount of Aquaplex's capital contribution, loan, interest, and management fees) at any time\n      in the next six months.\n\n   • If the property was not sold or acquired in six months, Rancho's interest passed to Aquaplex.\n\nOmniBank also agreed under a forbearance agreement not to post the property for foreclosure\nand if the property was not sold, to extend the maturity of the note *772 with interest at the\nthen-existing federal funds rate. The MSA contemplated the later execution of a formal settlement\nagreement. However, Rancho never established the $100,000 account and a formal settlement\nagreement was never executed, causing OmniBank's forbearance agreement to lapse.\n\nAfter the collapse of the settlement, the case proceeded to trial. A few days before trial, Rancho's\ntrial counsel filed a motion to withdraw, claiming that his services were being used to perpetuate\na fraud. Rancho then filed for bankruptcy, which temporarily stayed the trial court proceedings.\nDuring the bankruptcy, an individual named Jeff Greenberg offered to purchase the Tumbleweed\nProperty (the “Greenberg Offer”) for $4.05 million. Rancho refused to consent to the sale and filed\na lis pendens on the property to prevent a sale of the property until the dispute was adjudicated.\nThe bankruptcy court later dismissed Rancho's bankruptcy suit as a bad-faith filing. The trial then\nresumed. Aquaplex amended its petition to include allegations of breach and fraud related to the\nMSA. At the close of Rancho's case in chief, the court directed a verdict against Rancho on all\nof its claims, ruling that Rancho breached the MSA as a matter of law for failing to fund the\n$100,000 account. This left Aquaplex's claims as the subject of the remainder of the trial. In a video\ndeposition shown at trial, Rancho's former attorney testified under the crime-fraud exception about\nhis dealings with Turner. See TEX.R. EVID. 503(d)(1) (“There is no [attorney-client privilege] ...\n[i]f the services of the lawyer were sought or obtained to enable or aid anyone to commit or plan\nto commit what the client knew or reasonably should have known to be a crime or fraud.”). The\nformer attorney testified that he discovered that Rancho did not intend to put up the $100,000\ndeposit required under the MSA and that Rancho was negotiating with bankruptcy attorneys on\nthe side during the settlement process. The jury found that Rancho had breached both the JVA and\nthe MSA and also committed fraud in connection with both. The jury also found that Rancho had\nassigned its interest in the joint venture to OmniBank in an earlier document.\n\nAquaplex elected to recover damages for fraud under the MSA and pursued declaratory and\ninjunctive relief for the breach of the JVA. The trial court entered judgment on the jury verdict,\nwhich awarded Aquaplex:\n\n   • actual damages for fraudulent inducement under the MSA, itemized as:\n\n      # $597,183.70 for the loss of the Greenberg Offer;\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In its initial opinion, the court of appeals reversed the trial court's judgment,\nholding that: (1) the single injury doctrine precluded recovery under both the JVA and the MSA; 2\n(2) there was no evidence that fraud relating to the MSA caused damages to Aquaplex; and (3)\nAquaplex was barred from punitive damages because it did not prove actual damages. 253 S.W.3d\n728, 732–36 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 2007). On rehearing, the court of appeals acknowledged that its\ninitial opinion failed to address the declaratory and injunctive relief awarded for Rancho's breach\nof the JVA. 297 S.W.3d 781, 783. The court held that there was no evidence supporting this relief\nand rendered judgment that Aquaplex take nothing. Id. at 783.\n\n [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] The trial court's judgment declared that Rancho no longer had any interest\nin the joint venture because the interest was divested by one or more of: (1) the MSA; (2) an\nassignment of Rancho's interest in the joint venture to OmniBank; (3) paragraph 5.2(j) of the\nJVA; 3 or (4) paragraph 5.9 of the JVA. 4 We agree with the court of appeals that none of these\nis a proper basis for this relief. First, Aquaplex's counter-claim for declaratory and injunctive\nrelief was premised on breach of the JVA, not the MSA. Second, the unambiguous language of\nthe “assignment” makes clear it was a security interest. It states that Rancho “assigns, transfers\nand conveys unto OMNIBANK ... all of Assignor's right, title and interest in and to Assignor's\n40% ownership in [the joint venture] ... including, but not limited to all rights to cash and other\ndistributions from the Venture.” It states that “[t]his assignment is given in consideration of and\nas security for the payment of all the indebtedness ... owing by Assignor ... to Lender.” It further\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 89\n\nprovides that “[s]o long as there shall exist no default ... Assignor shall have the right to collect ...\nproperty and other distribution rights ... pursuant to the terms of the [JVA].” In addition, OmniBank\nwould not be obligated to perform any duties or be obligated for any liabilities under the JVA and,\nupon default, OmniBank could notify the joint venture that all further distributions under the JVA\nshall be made to OmniBank. Lastly, it provided that, upon payment in full, the assignment was\nvoid. An “assignment” such as this, where the creditor does not assume any obligations and the\neffectiveness of the instrument is terminated on final payment, is a security interest. See Amco\nTrust, Inc. v. Naylor, 159 Tex. 146, 317 S.W.2d 47, 51 (1958). Nevertheless, we agree with the\ncourt of appeals that nothing in the record indicates OmniBank ever elected to exercise any rights\nit had under the “assignment” upon Rancho's default. Finally, relief cannot *774 be premised on\nParagraphs 5.2(j) and 5.9 of the JVA. Under 5.2(j), Aquaplex, as managing venturer, had a right\nto sell the property as long as the amount of the sale equaled $60,000 or more per condo. The\nGreenberg sale would have fit that description. Under 5.9, Rancho could have offered to buy out\nAquaplex, but did not. There is some evidence that Rancho's actions prevented the Greenberg sale.\nBut none of the contractual provisions cited by Aquaplex in the JVA or MSA explicitly supports a\nforfeiture of interest in the event of a breach. Forfeitures are not favored in Texas, and contracts are\nconstrued to avoid them. See Sirtex Oil Indus., Inc. v. Erigan, 403 S.W.2d 784, 787 (Tex.1966).\nGenerally, the proper remedy for breach is damages. See Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785,\n788 (Tex.1991).\n\n [7] As held by the court of appeals, the injunctive relief can no longer stand because there was no\nevidence to support the trial court's declaratory relief under the JVA. Thus, the denial of injunctive\nrelief is proper as there was no threat of imminent harm. See Schneider Nat'l Carriers, Inc. v.\nBates, 147 S.W.3d 264, 285 (Tex.2004).\n\n[8] [9] [10] While we agree with the court of appeals with regard to relief under the JVA, we\ndo not agree with regard to the fraud claim under the MSA. The elements of fraud are:\n\n             (1) that a material representation was made; (2) the representation was false;\n             (3) when the representation was made, the speaker knew it was false or made it\n             recklessly without any knowledge of the truth and as a positive assertion; (4) the\n             speaker made the representation with the intent that the other party should act\n             upon it; (5) the party acted in reliance on the representation; and (6) the party\n             thereby suffered injury.\n\nIn re FirstMerit Bank, N.A., 52 S.W.3d 749, 758 (Tex.2001) (citing Formosa Plastics Corp. v.\nPresidio Eng'rs & Contractors, Inc., 960 S.W.2d 41, 47 (Tex.1998)). The court of appeals focused\non the injury (or damages) element, holding that no evidence supported the damages awarded by\nthe trial court. But first we consider whether, as Rancho argues, the intent element is not supported\nby legally sufficient evidence. 5 In reviewing a verdict for legal sufficiency, we “must view the\nevidence in the light favorable to the verdict, crediting favorable evidence if reasonable jurors\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 89\n\ncould, and disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not.” City of Keller v.\nWilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 807 (Tex.2005).\n\n [11] [12] [13] “A promise of future performance constitutes an actionable misrepresentation if\nthe promise was made with no intention of performing at the time it was made.” Formosa Plastics,\n960 S.W.2d at 48. “Proving that a party had no intention *775 of performing at the time a contract\nwas made is not easy, as intent to defraud is not usually susceptible to direct proof.” Tony Gullo\nMotors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 305 (Tex.2006) (citing Spoljaric v. Percival Tours, Inc.,\n708 S.W.2d 432, 435 (Tex.1986)). While breach of the contract alone is not evidence that a party\ndid not intend to perform, “breach combined with ‘slight circumstantial evidence’ of fraud” is some\nevidence of fraudulent intent, enough to support a verdict. Id. “[A] party's intent is determined at\nthe time the party made the representation, [but] it may be inferred from the party's subsequent\nacts after the representation is made.” Spoljaric, 708 S.W.2d at 434 (citing Chicago, T. & M.C.\nRy. Co. v. Titterington, 84 Tex. 218, 19 S.W. 472, 474 (1892)).\n\n [14] Here, Rancho's attorney withdrew and then testified that he believed his client was\nperpetrating a fraud. The timing of the bankruptcy, filed just after the execution of the MSA,\nconstitutes further circumstantial evidence of Rancho's lack of intent to perform. These examples\nsatisfy the “slight circumstantial evidence” standard enunciated in Tony Gullo Motors I and\nSpoljaric, and when combined with Rancho's breach, establish the fraudulent intent requirement.\nSee, e.g., Tony Gullo Motors I, 212 S.W.3d at 305–06 (breach plus spoliation of evidence and\nforged signatures met standard); Spoljaric, 708 S.W.2d at 435–36 (breach plus evidence that\nemployer refused to commit bonus plan to writing and remained silent when asked if plan would\nbe approved after it had already been approved met standard). Contrary to the court of appeals'\nconclusion, there is legally sufficient evidence to support a finding of fraudulent intent.\n\n [15] [16] The court of appeals held that no evidence supported the award of damages. 253\nS.W.3d at 736. We disagree. “Texas recognizes two measures of direct damages for common-\nlaw fraud: the out-of-pocket measure and the benefit-of-the-bargain measure. The out-of-pocket\nmeasure computes the difference between the value paid and the value received, while the benefit-\nof-the-bargain measure computes the difference between the value as represented and the value\nreceived.” Formosa Plastics, 960 S.W.2d at 49 (citations omitted); see also Baylor Univ. v.\nSonnichsen, 221 S.W.3d 632, 636 (Tex.2007) (per curiam) (observing that out-of-pocket damages\n“derive from a restitutionary theory,” while benefit-of-the-bargain damages “derive from an\nexpectancy theory”).\n\nThe trial court entered judgment on the jury verdict, which awarded the following monetary\ndamages: (1) $35,000 in attorney's fees and expenses incurred by Aquaplex as a result of Rancho's\nbankruptcy proceedings; (2) $597,183.70 as the amount Aquaplex lost due to Rancho's failure to\npermit a sale of the property after the execution of the MSA; (3) $100,000 as the amount Rancho\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 89\n\nwas obligated to provide under the MSA; and (4) $279,000 as the amount that Aquaplex lost due\nto the loss of the OmniBank forbearance agreement. Under the benefit-of-the-bargain measure,\nAquaplex suffered some damages under each of these categories.\n\nRancho argues that there is no evidence supporting a causal relationship between the alleged fraud\nand the $35,000 attorney's fees awarded in relation to the bankruptcy filing. But the bankruptcy\ndelay was in direct contradiction to the purpose of the MSA—to end the litigation. The attorney's\ntestimony that Rancho was consulting with bankruptcy counsel and that it did not intend to fund\nthe $100,000 as it agreed in the MSA, along with the evidence of the bad faith bankruptcy filing\nis *776 legally sufficient evidence to support these damages.\n\n [17] Some evidence also supports Aquaplex's claim that it lost the benefit of the sale of\nthe property due to Rancho's fraud. “Under the benefit-of-the bargain measure, lost profits\non the bargain may be recovered if such damages are proved with reasonable certainty.”\nFormosa Plastics, 960 S.W.2d at 50. But the damages cannot be based upon an “entirely\nhypothetical, speculative bargain that was never struck and would not have been consummated.”\nId. “[D]etermining whether lost profits have been proved with reasonable certainty is a fact-\nintensive determination dependent upon the circumstances of a particular case,” but “[w]hen a\nreview of the surrounding circumstances establishes that the profits are not reasonably certain,\nthere is no evidence to support the lost profits award.” Id. at 50 n. 3. Here, there is some evidence\nthat Aquaplex lost profits due to the fraud—specifically the loss of a sale to Greenberg. Greenberg\noffered $4.05 million for the property, which under the terms of the MSA, satisfied the minimum\noffer amount of $4 million. Rancho refused to consent to the sale and filed a lis pendens, effectively\nblocking the sale. The court of appeals held, and Rancho argues, that there is no evidence as to\nwhy the Greenberg Offer failed, and it is thus speculative to claim the alleged fraud caused its\nfailure. But both parties testified that they knew of the Greenberg Offer, and Rancho testified that\nit filed the lis pendens to prevent the sale. This is sufficient evidence that the sale fell through due\nto Rancho's actions. Therefore, damages were proper.\n\n [18] The damages were calculated incorrectly, however. The jury and trial court awarded\n$597,183.70 for the loss of the sale. It appears from the record that this figure was reached by\nsubtracting Aquaplex's original investment of $1,044,000 ($400,000 in contribution and $644,000\nloan) from $1,641,183.70, which is the amount Aquaplex argued it was due (including interest)\nunder the JVA had the property been sold to Greenberg. But this figure does not take into account\nthat Aquaplex still received an interest in the property by way of its interest in the joint venture,\nwhich survived the failed sale under the Greenberg Offer. The damages figure must reflect this\noffset. See Formosa Plastics, 960 S.W.2d at 49–50. Therefore, the trial court's award was not\nproper and must be recalculated.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 12\n\fAquaplex, Inc. v. Rancho La Valencia, Inc., 297 S.W.3d 768 (2009)\n53 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 89\n\n [19] The trial court also awarded $100,000 for the OmniBank account Rancho failed to fund. The\ncourt of appeals held that there was no evidence that the money was to be paid to Aquaplex or that\nAquaplex had to make the payments in lieu of Rancho. 253 S.W.3d at 736. Aquaplex argues that\nthe $100,000 was a benefit-of-the-bargain, and that it was damaged by Rancho's failure to fund\nthe $100,000 because the property remained encumbered with this amount. The court of appeals\nis partially correct: Rancho's failure to fund the $100,000 damaged the joint venture because its\nasset is encumbered by additional interest. Because of its ownership interest in the joint venture,\nAquaplex was injured and may recover to the extent of that injury. This amount, though, would\nnot necessarily be $100,000, and must be recalculated.\n\nThe court of appeals also held that the evidence did not support $279,000 in damages for the loss of\nthe forbearance agreement because Aquaplex put on evidence of damages over a two-year period\nwhen the agreement at issue was only a one-year period. 253 S.W.3d at 735. The court of appeals\nis correct here. Aquaplex outlined the value of a two-year forbearance agreement in a chart at trial,\nbut the agreement *777 introduced into evidence was only for one year. Thus, while there may\nhave been damages, it was only for one year and Aquaplex failed to put on any evidence of the\nappropriate amount of damages for a one-year period.\n\n [20] We hold that some evidence supported an award of damages for fraud under the MSA, just\nnot at the level awarded by the trial court. This Court may not order a remittitur, but the courts of\nappeals may. TEX.R.APP. P. 46.3; Tony Gullo Motors I, 212 S.W.3d at 310. Therefore, we affirm\nthe portion of the court of appeals' judgment rejecting Aquaplex's declaratory and injunctive relief,\nand reverse the portion of the court of appeals' judgment related to the monetary damages. We\nremand the case to the court of appeals so that it may determine whether to remand for a new\ntrial on damages, see Formosa Plastics, 960 S.W.2d at 51, or whether to suggest a remittitur, see\nTEX.R.APP. P. 46.3; Tony Gullo Motors I, 212 S.W.3d at 310. Furthermore, because we hold\nthat actual damages were proper, the court of appeals must reconsider whether punitive damages\nare appropriate. See Twin City Fire Ins. Co. v. Davis, 904 S.W.2d 663, 665 (Tex.1995) (“[A]ctual\ndamages sustained from a tort must be proven before punitive damages are available.”). The court\nof appeals must also consider the factual sufficiency issues raised by Rancho, but not yet addressed\nby the court of appeals. See TEX.R.APP. P. 53.4.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n53 Tex.

J. 89\n\n2      We do not reach the single injury issue or consider whether Aquaplex suffered more than one injury. An application of the single\n       injury rule does not arise unless there is more than one recovery for a single injury. See Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212\n       S.W.3d 299, 303 (Tex.2006). Under our holding, Aquaplex has only one recovery.\n3      This provision in the JVA listed Aquaplex's authority as “managing venturer.” It provided that Aquaplex is authorized to “[sell] all\n       or a portion of the Land or the Project for $60,000.00 per condominium unit or more.”\n4      This provision in the JVA discussed third-party offers. It provided that if an offer was made, a dissenting partner may buy out the\n       other partner for the amount that partner would have made if the sale went through and the joint venture was immediately liquidated.\n       Otherwise, the third-party offer shall be accepted.\n5      Rancho did not raise this alternative ground for affirmance as a cross-point in its response to the petition for review. It raised it for\n       the first time in its brief on the merits. Aquaplex argues Rancho has waived this point. See TEX.R.APP. P. 53.3(c)(2) (providing\n       that the issues presented section in the response to the petition for review must include any “independent grounds for affirmance of\n       the court of appeals' judgment”). Rancho's “Issues Presented” section did not assert that the court of appeals could have found no\n       evidence supporting the intent element. But Rule 53.4 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure provides: “[T]o request that the Supreme\n       Court consider [points briefed in the court of appeals but not decided by that court], a party may raise those issues or points in the\n       petition, the response, the reply, any brief, or a motion for rehearing.” TEX.R.APP. P. 53.4. The court of appeals did not consider\n       the intent element, but Rancho raised that issue before the court of appeals and its brief on the merits before this Court. Therefore,\n       the point is not waived.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Kirlicks, 110 Tex. 90 (1919)\n216 S.W. 385\n\n[1] The ruling of the Court of Civil Appeals that under the Act of 1913 the peremptory direction of\nthe verdict was subject to challenge on the appeal though not objected to in the trial court before\nread to the jury, presented a conflict with decisions of other Courts of Civil Appeals, and we\ngranted a writ of error in order to settle the question. We decided it at the last term in Walker v.\nHaley which involved a similar conflict. 109 Tex. --, 214 S. W. 295. That decision sustains the\nholding of the Court of Civil Appeals in the present case.\n\n[2] The oil lease contained this provision:\n         ‘It is further agreed that in the event oil is found in paying quantities in said\n         first well, then the lessee agrees and covenants that within thirty days from the\n         completion of such successful well he will begin the boring of a second well on\n         some other acre of said tract herein leased, and continue to bore additional wells\n         with due diligence in such order as to additional wells on the tract herein leased\n         as developments may justify, until at least five or six wells have been completed,\n         or the acre upon which said second party has failed to drill a well reverts to the\n         first party by written notice to that effect being served upon said second party by\n         said first party.’\n\n\n\n\nThe tract of land leased embraced about 20 acres and was laid off in acre blocks. Decker bored his\nfirst two wells upon different acres. He completed five wells with due diligence, but four of them\n *94 were upon the same acre. **386 Upon the question as to whether this provision in the lease\nwould sustain a forfeiture because of a failure to bore all of the five wells upon different acres, the\nCourt of Civil Appeals held that the provision was ambiguous and that its meaning should have\nbeen submitted to the jury for decision.\n [3] If the provision is ambiguous, that alone condemns it as a forfeiture provision. A forfeiture\nshould rest upon surer ground. Where a contract is so vague in its terms that a court cannot\ndetermine its meaning, it would be unjust to enforce a forfeiture under it against one whose only\nfault has been to possibly mistake its meaning. Forfeitures are harsh and punitive in their operation.\nThey are not favored by the law, and ought not to be. The authority to forfeit a vested right or\nestate should not rest in provisions whose meaning is uncertain and obscure. It should be found\nonly in language which is plain and clear, whose unequivocal character may render its exercise\nfair and rightful.\n\n\nIt is not necessary that we determine whether this clause in the lease requires the boring of the five\nwells upon five different acres, or sanctions their location upon but two different acres. If it be\nconceded that it admits of the first construction, it is not certain that such is its true construction.\nIt does not plainly say that each of the wells shall be upon a different acre. It is only by inference,\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    3\n\fDecker v.

W. 396.\n\nAnother clause in the lease was as follows:\n         ‘It is further mutually agreed that in case lessee abandons said property; or in case\n         he fails to operate any particular well which is in actual operation on said tract,\n         which is producing either oil or gas, for the period of thirty days, and fails to operate\n         same for said period, unless such failure is unavoidable and is because of broken\n         machinery that cannot by proper care and diligence be sooner replaced or put in\n         order, or because of the wells clogging so as to reasonably require a longer time\n         to clean and put them in order, then this lease and such producing well and the\n         land hereinabove provided to operate it, shall revert to the lessors, and the lessors\n         shall in such event have the right to take possession of said premises and such well,\n         together with all of its equipments, and operate same, or have same operated for\n         their own benefit without further proceedings, or any legal proceedings, of any\n         kind or character but in such event the lessee shall have the right to remove his\n         equipments and machinery from such well so forfeited, and from said land herein\n         leased on which said well is directly located, and not to exceed one acre in area,\n         but in no event to so operate as to interfere with other wells operated by lessee\n         or with other drilling by him for other wells unless the lessors shall within thirty\n          *95 days after such forfeiture elect to pay and do pay to the lessee fifty per cent.\n         of the market price for the piping in such well or wells, and the market value of all\n         equipments retained, and should lessors fail to make such payment within thirty\n         days after such forfeiture on the part of lessee and the taking over of said well by\n         lessors, the lessee shall have the right to remove said pipe and equipment from\n         such well and from such land.’\n\n\nA further ruling of the Court of Civil Appeals, complained of here by Decker, was that in the state\nof the proof an issue of fact was presented as to whether under this clause Decker had forfeited\nthe lease in whole or in part.\n\nThe clause provides two different conditions as grounds for forfeiture, and different measures\nof forfeiture as the consequence: (1) an abandonment of the property, whereon the entire lease\nshould terminate; and (2) a failure to operate a producing well for thirty days unless due to an\nexcepted cause, whereon such well and the immediate land upon which it was located in extent\nsufficient for its operation but not to exceed one acre, should revert to the lessors. In the event of\nthe latter happening, the lessee is given the right to remove his machinery and equipment from\nsuch forfeited well and land unless within 30 days after such forfeiture the lessors shall pay him\ntherefor as stipulated.\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Kirlicks, 110 Tex. 90 (1919)\n216 S.W. 385\n\n [4] As we understand its opinion the Court of Civil Appeals did not construe the clause as\nauthorizing a forfeiture of the entire lease upon a failure to operate one of the producing wells. It\nheld that there was evidence tending to establish an entire abandonment of the land by the lessee,\nand also evidence of his failure to operate producing wells for 30 days and longer. Its ruling simply\nwas that such being the record the issues both of an entire forfeiture and a partial forfeiture should\nhave been submitted to the jury.\n\n\nIf we have jurisdiction to review this holding of the Court of Civil Appeals, it is in virtue\nof subdivision 6 of article 1521 as amended by the Act of 1917 (chapter 75), by which the\nappellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is now governed. That is, it must appear that the\nruling constitutes ‘an error of law * * * of such importance to the jurisprudence of the State, as\nin the opinion of the Supreme Court requires correction.’ The amendment of this subdivision by\nthe Act of 1917 was plainly intended to further limit the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as\nconferred by the Act of 1913. Whether the Court of Civil Appeals ‘has erroneously declared the\nsubstantive law of the case’ is no longer the test as applied to cases falling within the subdivision.\nThe amendment declares, in effect, that it is not enough that the error of law be obvious, in the\nopinion of the Supreme Court; nor that it be of importance to the aggrieved party; nor **387\nthat its correction be necessary in the view of the Supreme Court to prevent an injustice in the\nimmediate case; nor even that it be ‘of importance’ to the jurisprudence of the *96 State. For\nthe Supreme Court to be invested with the power to revise the ruling, it is required that it amount\nto an error of law ‘of such importance’ to the jurisprudence of the State as in the opinion of the\ncourt requires correction. This clearly presupposes a ruling of such erroneous consequence as, if\npermitted to stand, would constitute a serious departure from the established law or introduce a\ndoctrine violative of fundamental principles.\n\nWhatever may be the difficulties of its administration, this is the theory and plain meaning of the\namendment. It is the written law, and our duty is to give it effect.\n [5] We do not consider a ruling of the Court of Civil Appeals in a particular case either that there\nwas some evidence warranting the submission of a given issue to the jury, or that there was no\nevidence justifying its submission, as within the purview of the amendment unless it can be fairly\nregarded as so flagrantly wrong as to amount to a virtual denial and abrogation of the established\nrules of law which, in the one instance, enjoin upon the trial court the exercise of its essential\nfunction, and in the other preserve the right of jury trial. Where these questions are presented, our\npractice is to examine the record; but unless it discloses that the ruling is of the character stated,\nwe do not regard it as one within the court's power to revise.\n\n\nWe have examined the record here under the assignment challenging the ruling of the Court of\nCivil Appeals above noted. If erroneous at all, the ruling was not so clearly wrong as to bring it\nproperly within the Supreme Court's jurisdiction.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Kirlicks, 110 Tex. 90 (1919)\n216 S.W. 385\n\n\nOther questions are presented, but they are equally without our jurisdiction.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Civil of Appeals reversing that of the District Court is affirmed, but\nwith the direction that the further trial of the case be in accordance with this opinion.\n\nHAWKINS, J.\n\nIn so much of the foregoing majority opinion by our Chief Justice as deals with issues of which\nthis court has entertained jurisdiction I concur; but I do not concur entirely in the application made,\nin that opinion, of amended subdivision 6, R. S. art. 1521, Acts of 1917.\n\nIt is my opinion that whenever it is shown here, to the satisfaction of this court, that a Court of\nCivil Appeals has held erroneously that a given issue is or is not supported by some evidence,\nthereby determining whether such issue is or is not properly referable to the jury, such error should\nbe treated by this court as being, in and of itself, of such importance to the jurisprudence of the\nstate as to require correction.\n\nI believe that the requirements of this jurisdictional statute are met in every such instance, and that\nintrinsically such error is of the stated importance, even though such error may have been *97\ncommitted in treating an issue which is not of frequently recurring nature or of general interest,\nand even though such erroneous ruling may not have been intended as an assertion of a general\nprinciple or a general rule of practice.\n\nI think that a holding by the Court of Civil Appeals, approving or directing the submission by the\ndistrict court to the jury of a given issue when in the opinion of the Supreme Court there is no\nevidence to support it, or approving or directing refusal of a district court to submit to the jury a\ngiven issue when in the opinion of the Supreme Court there is evidence to support it, constitutes\ninevitably in every instance ‘a serious departure from the established law,’ and introduces into our\njurisprudence ‘a doctrine violative of fundamental principles.’ Instances of the former character\ninvolve refusal of the trial court to perform an ‘essential function’-to discharge a legal duty which\nought not to be shifted to the jury; and instances of the latter character involve a practical denial\nof the right of trial by jury, in plain contravention of our state Constitution.\n\nSuch errors very naturally will occur occasionally, and that is bad enough, even though all such\nerrors be subject to correction by our Supreme Court; but for any such error to be recognized\nby this court and yet not be subject to correction by it, for lack of jurisdiction in this court, is, I\nthink, a very serious reproach to our jurisprudence. In view of the phraseology of said amended\nsubdivision 6 I cannot concur in a construction of it which entails that deplorable result.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Our former opinion and judgment dated November 14, 2002, are withdrawn,\nand our opinion and judgment dated March 20, 2003, are substituted therefor.\n\n\n\n                                                     Opinion\n\nThe controlling issue in this case is whether the landlord's written notice of default because of\nnonpayment of rent was legally sufficient to permit forfeiture of two billboard ground leases. We\nhold that the notice was insufficient, as a matter of law, because the notice was not specific; the\nnotice was excessive, imprecise, and unreasonable; and the notice required the tenant to perform,\nin order to cure the default, certain acts not required in the leases.\n\nThe trial court, in a nonjury trial, found that the tenant, Outdoor Systems, Inc. (Outdoor Systems),\nbreached the leases and awarded the landlord, BBE, L.L.C. a/k/a BBE/Arromid, L.L.C. (BBE),\ndamages of $80,034.71, title to the two billboards located on the land, and attorney's fees. We\nreverse and render in part; modify in part; and, as modified, affirm in part.\n\nThe significant economic issue between the parties is who owns the two billboards located in\nDallas. If the forfeiture was effective, the billboards are owned by the landlord, BBE. If the\nforfeiture was ineffective, the billboards are owned by the tenant, Outdoor Systems, who has the\nright under the leases to come upon the land and remove the billboards. In 1998, the city of Dallas\nenacted a moratorium prohibiting the construction of new billboards within the city limits. The\neffect of that moratorium significantly increased *69 the value of the two billboards. The trial\ncourt found that the value of the billboards as constructed on the land is substantial and that the\nvalue of the billboards removed from the land is minimal.\n\nThe two leases were dated July 20, 1987, and each provided for a primary term of 10 years. After\nthe expiration of the 10–year term, each lease was automatically renewed for 1–year terms unless\nterminated in writing by either party 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the respective lease.\nThe anniversary date for each lease was September 1.\n\nIn February of 1997, Outdoor Systems acquired the leasehold interest in two tracts of land which\ncontained a billboard on each tract. At that time, the land was owned by Sun NLF Limited\nPartnership. BBE purchased the land from Sun on or about June 29, 1999. On or about June 28,\n1999, Sun sent a letter to its tenant, Outdoor Systems, advising Outdoor Systems that it was selling\nthe land to BBE and that future rent payments should be sent to BBE. Before receiving the letter,\nOutdoor Systems had mailed the July rent to Sun.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

BBE, L.L.C., 105 S.W.3d 66 (2003)\n\n\n\nOn July 2, 1999, BBE sent a letter (first default notice) to Outdoor Systems stating that future rent\npayments under the two leases should be mailed to BBE. Upon receipt of the July 2 letter, Tanya\nLillie, an employee of Outdoor Systems, contacted Donald L. Woodsmall, BBE's manager, and\ntold Woodsmall that the July rent had been sent to Sun. Because Sun had returned the July rent\npayment to Outdoor Systems and because Outdoor Systems only cut rent checks once a month,\nLillie asked Woodsmall if Outdoor Systems could reissue the July payment when the rent check for\nAugust was sent out. Woodsmall told Lillie that he would get back to her regarding her proposal.\nWoodsmall did not get back in touch with Lillie.\n\nOn July 16, 1999, BBE sent a second letter (second default notice) to Outdoor Systems. This\nletter stated that Outdoor Systems had miscalculated the amount of rent owed under the leases\nand demanded that Outdoor Systems perform other acts within ten days or the leases would be in\ndefault and BBE would look “to all of our remedies both at law and under the Leases.” The July\nrent, as calculated by Outdoor Systems, was tendered with the August payment. 1 BBE rejected\nboth the July and August payments.\n\nEach lease contained the following provisions:\n\n   4. Rentals.\n\n   (c) It shall be deemed a default by Lessee under the terms of this Agreement if Lessee fails to\n   make any payment to Lessor pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and such failure continues\n   for a period of ten (10) days following receipt by Lessee of written notice from Lessor specifying\n   such default.\n\n   5. Termination.\n\n   (a) Lessor may terminate this Agreement at any time following the nonpayment by Lessee of\n   any amounts due to Lessor hereunder, and the failure to pay *70 such amounts within the\n   applicable cure period set forth in Paragraph 4 above.\n\n   (c) Upon termination of this Agreement by Lessee or Lessor, for any reason other than default\n   by Lessee, Lessee shall have the right for a period of sixty (60) days following the date of\n   such termination to remove the Board and any other associated facilities which had previously\n   been installed by Lessee in connection with the operation of the Board. Lessor shall cooperate\n   with Lessee in order to accomplish such removal. In the event of default by Lessee Board shall\n   become sole property of Lessor and Lessee has no further recourse or claim to the board or\n   against Lessor.

(Emphasis added)\n   The July 16, 1999, letter from Donald Woodsmall provides in part:\n\n      Dear Ms. Lillie:\n\n      In reviewing the payments made under the Leases in the last year, it is apparent that Outdoor\n      Systems has been miscalculating how the payments are to work. The payments are not to\n      fluctuate on a monthly basis, but a new minimum is to be set each year based on 25% of the\n      previous year's gross billings. Outdoor Systems method miscalculates the Lease payments\n      owing and results in an understatement of the true payments. The arrearages for the last\n      ten months alone equal $878.50. The amount of the arrearages prior to the last ten months\n      is unknown to us as we do not have the information needed to calculate those payments.\n      Inasmuch as BBE, l.l.c. has succeeded to all of the rights, title and interest of the previous\n      Property owner in and to the Leases, these arrearages under the Leases belong to BBE. I\n      would appreciate receiving within ten days from the date hereof both the $878.50 relating to\n      the last ten months and the total arrearages from the inception of the Leases up to the last\n      ten months; failing which, Outdoor Systems will be in default under the Leases and we will\n      look to all of our remedies both at law and under the Leases.\n\n      We would also ask that you forward to us your advertising contracts from the inception of the\n      Leases to the present so that we may audit and calculate the percentage payments that are\n      owed throughout the term of the Leases. We are preserving all of our rights with regard to\n      the previous underpayments of rent until such audit has been performed. (Emphasis added)\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

BBE, L.L.C., 105 S.W.3d 66 (2003)\n\n\n\nUnder the leases, in order for there to be a “default” for nonpayment of rent, BBE was required to\ngive Outdoor Systems written notice “specifying such default.”\n\nForfeiture is a harsh and punitive remedy, and it is not favored in law or equity. 41 TEX. JUR.\n3D Forfeitures and Penalties § 5 (1998). Some of the appropriate *71 rules regarding forfeiture\npursuant to a contract are discussed in 41 TEX. JUR. 3D Forfeitures and Penalties § 6 (1998):\n\n   Forfeiture under a contract will not be declared unless the language of the contract can be\n   construed in no other way. A forfeiture will be avoided when another reasonable reading of the\n   contract exists.\n\n   The right to a forfeiture may be found only in language that is plain, clear, and unequivocal.\n   Thus, when forfeitures are intended to take place upon the happening of certain events, cause\n   of forfeiture is to be plainly and clearly stated, and the time definitely fixed. Where grounds for\n   a forfeiture are specified in a contract, a forfeiture cannot be had on other grounds.\n\nThe court in Wendlandt v. Sommers Drug Stores Company, 551 S.W.2d 488 (Tex.Civ.App.-Austin\n1977, no writ), discussed the general rules regarding notice:\n\n            Notice of default in payment of rent must convey a message that the notifier\n            is initiating steps necessary to finally assert his legal rights that if default is\n            not cured, he may take final action as provided in the contract. In this respect\n            see: Moore v. Richfield Oil Corp., 233 Or. 39, 377 P.2d 32 (1962); Hocker v.\n            Heins, 231 N.Y.S.2d 481 (Sup.Ct. of Suffolk County, N.Y.1962)....The cases in\n            this State hold that a landlord cannot forfeit the lease of his tenant for failure\n            to comply with the provisions without first making demand upon the tenant for\n            performance. Gray v. Vogelsang, 236 S.W. 122 (Tex.Civ.App.1921, no writ);\n            Shepherd v. Sorrells, 182 S.W.2d 1009 (Tex.Civ.App.1944, no writ); Conn v.\n            Southern Pine Lumber Co., 11 S.W.2d 199 (Tex.Civ.App.1928, no writ).\n\nSee 41 TEX. JUR.3d Forfeitures and Penalties § 16 (1998).\n\nRegarding the sufficiency of a demand, it is stated in 51C C.J.S. Landlord & Tenant § 114(2)(b)\n(1968):\n\n            Where forfeiture of a lease is dependent on the making of a demand for\n            performance, the demand must be a proper, specific, and reasonable one.\n\nThe demand for rent must not be excessive. It is stated in 49 AM. JUR.2d Landlord and Tenant\n§ 303 (1995):\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

BBE, L.L.C., 105 S.W.3d 66 (2003)\n\n\n\n\n            As a general rule, the demand for rent, for the nonpayment of which the lessor\n            may declare the lease forfeited, must be for the precise amount of rent due, and\n            if an excessive amount is demanded the demand will be ineffectual.\n\n[1] [2] The notice by BBE of default and the demand upon Outdoor Systems to pay the rent\npursuant to the leases was necessary in order to provide Outdoor Systems an opportunity to cure the\ndefault prior to the harsh consequences of forfeiture. Cf. Ogden v. Gibraltar Savings Association,\n640 S.W.2d 232, 234 (Tex.1982).\n\nThe July 2 letter made no demand. It was merely a reminder that the July rent had not been\npaid. The July 16 letter demanded too much. The demand was not specific but was excessive,\nunreasonable, imprecise, and required Outdoor Systems to perform acts not required by the leases.\n\n [3] The July 16 letter demanded that Outdoor Systems, within 10 days, pay to BBE an unspecified\namount based upon “total arrearages from the inception of the Leases.” The leases were signed by\nthe original tenant and landlord in 1987. Lillie, an employee of Outdoor Systems, testified that she\nwas responsible for calculating and paying the rent on the billboards. Lillie testified that, assuming\nthere was an arrearage owed on the two leases, neither she nor anyone else at Outdoor Systems\nhad the information or ability to calculate, within the 10–day period, any arrearage *72 that might\nhave been owed back to 1987. The trial court, in its findings of fact, found that Outdoor Systems\nignored the July 16 demand from BBE and that Outdoor Systems made no effort to calculate\nor pay any rental arrearages. We look at the notice of default that was sent to Outdoor Systems\nby BBE to determine if the notice was sufficient. The response of Outdoor Systems does not\ndetermine the legal sufficiency of the notice. The demand letter purported to address both of the\nleases; however, it failed to segregate the amount demanded to cure the alleged default under each\nagreement. Furthermore, BBE demanded that Outdoor Systems provide advertising contracts from\nthe inception of the leases so that BBE could audit and calculate the percentage payments that\nwere owed throughout the term of the leases.\n\n [4] Outdoor Systems was not personally liable for any unpaid rent prior to the time it became the\ntenant under the leases in February 1997. See Regency Advantage Limited Partnership v. Bingo\nIdea–Watauga, Inc., 936 S.W.2d 275 (Tex.1996); 49 AM. JUR.2d Landlord and Tenant § 1145\n(1995). There is no requirement or obligation in the leases on the part of the tenant to provide the\nlandlord with advertising contracts relating to the billboards. A landlord cannot base a forfeiture\non the breach of an obligation that does not exist in the lease. See Deauville Corporation v. Garden\nSuburbs Golf and Country Club, 164 F.2d 430 (5th Cir.1947), cert. den'd, 333 U.S. 881, 68 S.Ct.\n912, 92 L.Ed. 1156 (1948).\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Kelley Manufacturing Company, 162 Tex. 534, 349 S.W.2d 95\n(1961). The issues involved in this appeal were not discussed in Rohrt. There, the court observed\nthat the effect of the default notice was not “disputed.”\n\nNeither the July 2 letter nor the July 16 letter was a sufficient notice of default. On August 11,\n1999, BBE sent a “Notice of Termination” to Outdoor Systems purporting to terminate both leases\nand to declare that title to the billboards had “automatically” vested in BBE. We hold that the\nnotice of termination was ineffective because it was not preceded by a proper notice of default.\nSee Ogden v. Gibraltar Savings Association, supra.\n\nOutdoor Systems refused to vacate the land and continued to operate the billboards and tender\nmonthly rental payments to BBE who rejected each of the tendered rent payments. On May 12,\n2000, BBE sent a letter to Outdoor Systems stating that the leases had terminated because of\nnumerous defaults by Outdoor Systems. However, to remove any misunderstanding, BBE notified\nOutdoor Systems that, pursuant to Paragraph 3(b) of the leases, the May 12 letter constituted\nOutdoor Systems's 60–day notice of termination. The letter stated, “The Leases shall not renew\nbut shall cease and expire on the anniversary date thereof, which can in no event be later than\nSeptember 1, 2000.” Outdoor Systems agrees that this was a proper termination of the leases\nbetween the parties.\n\nOutdoor Systems vacated the land prior to the September 1, 2000, anniversary date and advised\nBBE that it was prepared to remove the billboards. BBE objected to the removal of the billboards\nand refused to permit Outdoor Systems to remove the structures.\n\nWe reverse the trial court's judgment awarding title to the two billboards to BBE, and we render\njudgment that the two billboards located on the separate tracts of real property described in the\njudgment as Exhibits A and B are owned by Outdoor Systems and that Outdoor Systems *73 has\nthe right to remove the two billboards.\n\nIn its conclusions of law, the trial court found that the leases terminated on August 11, 1999, and\nthat Outdoor Systems violated TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 80.002 et seq. (Vernon\n1997 & Supp.2002) by remaining in possession after that date and by failing to remove advertising\nfrom the billboards after August 11. The court assessed trespass damages against Outdoor Systems\nin the amount of $75,604.58. We reverse this award and render judgment that Outdoor Systems\nis not liable to BBE for trespass damages because the leases did not terminate on August 11. The\ntermination letter was ineffective because it was based upon an insufficient notice of default.\n\nAs part of its damages award, the trial court found that Outdoor Systems was liable to BBE for\nunpaid rent of $4,430.13. Outdoor Systems does not challenge this finding. We, therefore, will\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

BBE, L.L.C., 105 S.W.3d 66 (2003)\n\n\n\nmodify the trial court's judgment to provide that BBE recover judgment against Outdoor Systems\nin the amount of $4,430.13.\n\n [5] [6] The trial court awarded BBE attorney's fees of $75,000.00 through trial and additional\nattorney's fees in the event of an appeal. Outdoor Systems contends that BBE is not entitled to\nattorney's fees because BBE's demand was excessive. A creditor who makes an excessive demand\nupon a debtor is not entitled to attorney's fees for subsequent litigation required to recover the\ndebt. Collingsworth v. King, 155 Tex. 93, 283 S.W.2d 30 (1955); Ingham v. Harrison, 148 Tex.\n380, 224 S.W.2d 1019 (1949). The court in Findlay v. Cave, 611 S.W.2d 57 (Tex.1981), observed\nthat Collingsworth and Ingham involved liquidated sums. However, the court stated that a party\ncould make an excessive demand for an unliquidated sum. The court said:\n\n            Certainly one can conceive of circumstances in which a demand for an\n            unliquidated sum would have to be characterized as excessive, and attorney's\n            fees denied.\n\nThe Findlay court also held:\n\n            [W]e do not find a sufficient level of unreasonableness or bad faith to warrant\n            finding excessive demand as a matter of law.\n\nWe find in the present case, as a matter of law, that the demand made by BBE in the July 16\nletter was an excessive demand for an unliquidated sum and, thus, discharged any liability for fees\nexpended thereafter.\n\nBBE's demand was not for a specific liquidated sum. As pointed out earlier in this opinion, the July\n16 letter demanded that Outdoor Systems, within 10 days, pay BBE an unspecified amount based\nupon “total arrearages from the inception of the Leases.” The original lessor and lessee executed\nthe leases in 1987. Outdoor Systems acquired the leasehold interest in 1997. BBE demanded that\nOutdoor Systems provide advertising contracts from the inception of the leases. The leases were\nforfeited by the trial court, and title to the billboards was awarded to BBE. We have reversed that\nfinding. The trial court found that Outdoor Systems was a trespasser because it failed to comply\nwith the demand and awarded BBE $75,604.58. We have reversed that finding. Under our decision,\nBBE has a judgment against Outdoor Systems for $4,430.13. Unlike the court in Findlay, we do\nfind a sufficient “level of unreasonableness ... to warrant finding excessive demand as a matter\nof law.”\n\n[7] BBE argues that Outdoor Systems cannot rely upon the defense of “excessive demand”\nbecause Outdoor Systems failed to expressly plead the defense. See Tuthill *74 v. Southwestern\nPublic Service Company, 614 S.W.2d 205, 212 (Tex.Civ.App.-Amarillo 1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\nThe record in this case reveals that, after the evidence closed and before judgment was entered,\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In Paragraph IV of BBE's trial brief submitted to the trial court, BBE\nstated:\n\n   Excessive Demand—A creditor who makes an excessive demand upon a debtor is not entitled\n   to attorneys' fees for subsequent litigation. An excessive demand is one which is manifestly\n   unreasonable, or made in bad faith. Findlay v. Cave, 611 S.W.2d 57, 58 (Tex.1981). Where\n   the demand in Findlay was for more than a jury awarded the close of the trial, the Court\n   found that was some evidence of excessive demand, but not enough to support the “manifestly\n   unreasonable” or “bad faith” standard. The court noted that the cases on excessive demand\n   occurred where the amount in controversy was liquidated and the creditor made demand for\n   more than it was entitled. Clearly the testimony in this case shows that BBE's demand for a\n   specific sum of money was for less than the amount due and that its further demand was for\n   an amount that could reasonably be thought to be within the knowledge and control of Outdoor\n   Systems. There is no authority to support that an excessive demand is otherwise void or vitiated.\n\nBBE did not argue in the trial court that Outdoor Systems had failed to sufficiently plead the\ndefense. On the contrary, it is apparent that the issue was before the court, as evidenced by BBE's\nbriefing and argument presented to the trial court. We hold that Outdoor Systems's “excessive\ndemand” defense to any liability for attorney's fees was tried by implied consent. See City of Los\nFresnos v. Gonzalez, 848 S.W.2d 910 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1993, no writ). The award of\nattorney's fees, both trial and appellate, to BBE is reversed; and we render judgment that Outdoor\nSystems is not responsible for attorney's fees.\n\n[8] In its brief, under issues presented, Outdoor Systems states:\n\n            [T]his case should be remanded for consideration of Outdoor Systems'\n            counterclaims, including its claim for conversion of the billboards. (Emphasis\n            added)\n\nOutdoor Systems argues that, because the trial court erroneously concluded that BBE's termination\ncomplied with the leases, the trial court improperly failed to consider Outdoor Systems's\ncounterclaims. This was a conventional nonjury trial on the merits. The judgment provides that\n“all relief not expressly granted herein is denied.” The trial court considered the counterclaims,\nand they were denied. We overrule Outdoor Systems's request that its counterclaims be remanded\nto the trial court for consideration.\n\n[9]    [10]    [11] Finally, Outdoor Systems seeks a remand of this matter to the trial court in order to\nseek the recovery of the billboards pursuant to our holding. 2 It would appear that Outdoor Systems\nhas an avenue for seeking the recovery of the billboards without the case being remanded to the\ntrial court. Texas courts have long held that a party obtaining any advantage or benefit through a\ntrial court's judgment that is later reversed must return the benefit to the other party.

Hoffman, 521 S.W.2d 922, 925 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1975, no\nwrit). As noted in Salgo v. Hoffman, supra at 925:\n\n\n   When an erroneous judgment has not been suspended pending appeal, and the relief granted has\n   already been obtained, the successful appellant may reclaim what he has been deprived of, and\n   if his demands are wrongfully resisted, he is entitled to the assistance of the courts.\n [12] [13] The assistance which the successful appellant is entitled to seek from the courts is\ncharacterized as the right of restitution. Currie v. Drake, supra at 740 (“The right of restitution\nof what one has lost by the enforcement of a judgment subsequently reversed has long been\nrecognized.”) A party may have restitution upon its own motion after an evidentiary hearing\nestablishing with certainty what he has lost. Currie v. Drake, supra at 740. Furthermore, the\nsuccessful appellant is entitled to seek restitution in the same proceeding without resorting to a\nnew suit. Cleveland v.

We, therefore, decline Outdoor Systems's request for a\nremand of this case in light of the existing procedure for Outdoor Systems to seek restitution after\nour judgment becomes final by the issuance of our mandate. See TEX.R.APP.P. 18.1(a).\n\nThe judgment of the trial court is reversed and rendered in part; modified in part; and, as modified,\naffirmed in part.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n*    Austin McCloud, Retired Chief Justice, Court of Appeals, 11th District of Texas at Eastland sitting by assignment.\n\n1    The method used by Outdoor Systems to calculate the rent had been used for several years by a prior tenant. None of the prior\n       landlords had complained. At trial, Outdoor Systems attempted to prove an alleged oral modification between a prior tenant and\n       landlord. The trial court agreed with BBE that Outdoor Systems and prior tenants had not followed the contract in the method used\n       to calculate the rent. The trial court found that the alleged modification was invalid. Outdoor Systems argues that the earlier conduct\n       of BBE and its predecessors waived, as a matter of law, any claimed forfeiture arising from payment of reduced rents. Because we\n       hold that the forfeiture was invalid, it is not necessary that we reach this argument urged by Outdoor Systems.

Travarillo Associates, 529 S.W.2d 622 (1975)\n\n\n\n\nThe right to forfeiture which T—Anchor claims and upon which it bases its suit for injunction\nis contained in paragraph XIII of the contract of sale. After setting out that time shall be of the\nessence, the contract further provided that if the buyer fails to pay any of the installments or\nbreaches any of the conditions of the contract, the seller shall have the right, after giving written\nnotice to the buyer, to declare the contract forfeited and cancelled and of no further force and effect.\n\nAppellant asserts its entitlement to exercise its contractual right of forfeiture by reason of default\non the part of the buyer and its assignee in making the required installment payments. We note\nthat, among other contentions, appellee insists that appellant's claim for possession and title\nbased on termination or forfeiture of the contract was not raised at the trial level and cannot\nproperly be advanced for the first time and considered in this appeal. However, after reviewing the\nentire record, including the pleadings and the evidence admitted, we have determined to consider\nappellant's asserted rights concerning the alleged forfeiture and the injunctive relief sought.\n\nAfter trial on the merits, the trial court rendered its judgment which decreed that: (1) certain\ninterlocutory orders be dissolved which had restrained and enjoined Travarillo Associates, the\nassignee of Young Properties, the original purchaser, from the taking possession of the Travelodge\nWest Motel, the subject of the contract of sale entered into on April 4, 1973; (2) Travarillo is\nthe owner and holder of all rights of ‘purchaser’ as formerly held by Young Properties under the\ncontract of sale; (3) the contract of sale is in full force and effect, and Travarillo with its acquired\nrights as purchaser is entitled to possession of the Travelodge West Motel described therein; (4)\ncertain monies tendered into the registry of the court by Travarillo be paid to T—Anchor, the seller,\nand that the balance in the registry be paid to Travarillo; (5) the only real parties in interest in this\ncase are T—Anchor and Travarillo; and (6) all other parties named as defendants have no interest\nin this controversy and are dismissed from the suit. Subsequent to the judgment, the trial court\nordered that the agreement of the parties with respect to the payment and receipt of the monies\npaid out from the registry of the court would not constitute any agreement to the judgment entered\nin this cause by T—Anchor nor in any manner affect T—Anchor's notice and right of appeal.\n\nUpon request, findings of fact and conclusions of law were made by the trial court. Since this\nappeal is determinable from competing equitable considerations necessarily based upon a series of\nacts and conduct of the parties, we shall set out what we deem to be the court's significant factual\nfindings and legal conclusions.\n\nAmong other facts found by the trial court were that: on April 4, 1973, T—Anchor, the seller,\nentered into a contract for the sale of the Travelodge West Motel in Amarillo, Texas, with Young,\nthe buyer; as a part of the same transaction, Young and Travarillo entered into an agreement of\npurchase and sale of the motel whereby Travarillo acquired all of Young's interest *625 in the\nmotel; T—Anchor consented to the assignment of the contract interest from Young to Travarillo\nupon the terms that Travarillo could acquire all of Young's interest in the motel if Young should\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Travarillo Associates, 529 S.W.2d 622 (1975)\n\n\n\ndefault in its contract payments to Travarillo; and on the same date, April 4, 1973, Young was\nplaced in possession of the motel under a leaseback agreement with Travarillo.\n\nAlthough there was evidence of prior late payments and acceptance thereof by T—Anchor, the\ntrial court found that beginning with the payment due in November, 1973, Young defaulted in its\nmonthly payments to T—Anchor in the amount of $10,812.17 each, and in each of its monthly\nlease payments to Travarillo in the amount of $6,471.00. The court further found that pursuant to\na proceeding brought by Young, on October 31, 1973, a bankruptcy court in California entered\nits order restraining all creditors of Young from accelerating or attempting to accelerate any\nindebtedness of Young, from enforcing any rights or remedies provided in any agreements with\nYoung, and from cancelling any such agreements or commencing any kind of forfeiture proceeding\nagainst Young; and that throughout the restraining period ordered by the bankruptcy court, Young\nremained in possession of the motel, but made no payments to T—Anchor or to Travarillo.\n\nAdditionally, the court found that: T—Anchor defaulted in the first and second lien payments\nwhich it was required to make to Home Savings and Loan Association of Waterloo, Iowa, and to\nAmarillo National Bank of Amarillo, Texas, under the sale contract with Young; both T—Anchor\nand Travarillo appeared in the bankruptcy proceeding seeking relief from the bankruptcy court's\nrestraining order, T—Anchor seeking cancellation of the sales contract and Travarillo seeking\ncancellation of the lease agreement and possession of the motel; T—Anchor, in its pleadings in\nbankruptcy court, fully recognized that Travarillo was the assignee of Young and held all of the\ninterest of Young in the motel and that Young was only a defaulting lessee at the time of the\nbankruptcy; on April 2, 1974, the bankruptcy court entered an order directing Young to vacate\nthe motel ten days after the date of the order, and dissolving the restraining orders against T—\nAnchor and Travarillo on or about April 12, 1974; as of the date of the dissolution of the restraining\norders, Travarillo was the owner of all of the interest of Young in the sales contract with T—\nAnchor; immediately after the bankruptcy court entered its order on April 2, 1974, the general\npartner of Travarillo tendered full payment of all delinquent land sales contract installments to\nT—Anchor and otherwise tendered performance of all delinquent obligations of Young to T—\nAnchor to make performance current under the contract; and T—Anchor wrongfully refused the\ntender by Travarillo and assumed possession of the motel as Young vacated.\n\nThe trial court further found that: the money contributed to the purchase of the motel was\nprincipally that of Travarillo in the amount of $300,000; T—Anchor received as cash consideration\nfor the motel $137,500; and some $200,884.32 was required to bring the obligations of Young\ncurrent under the land sales contract, including delinquent interest and penalty due from T—\nAnchor to the first lienholder plus attorneys' fees paid by T—Anchor in attempting to secure\nperformance of the contract or possession, all of which, ought equitably to be reimbursed to T\n—Anchor.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Travarillo Associates, 529 S.W.2d 622 (1975)\n\n\n\n\nAlso, the court made findings that: since T—Anchor was in possession of the motel from April 20,\n1974, to the time of trial on the merits, it had realized from motel operations a profit of $113,097.09\nafter expenses; after deducting the profits of T—Anchor from the amount required to bring the\ncontract obligations current, the sum of $87,787.23 was found to be owing to T—Anchor by\nTravarillo; Travarillo paid into the registry of the trial court the sum of $100,000, a sum sufficient\nto make T—Anchor whole under the land sales contract; and *626 receipt of $87,787.23 thereof\nby T—Anchor would fully adjust the equities of the parties and all accounts between them up to\nSeptember 5, 1974, the date of the trial on the merits.\n\nAdditionally, the trial court found that: it would be exceptionally harsh and unjust to forfeit the\nmonies contributed by Travarillo to the motel project and an unjust enrichment to T—Anchor by\nallowing forfeiture of the purchaser's rights under the land sales contract in the face of unusual\ncircumstances where a debtor in bankruptcy was continued in possession of the property while\nmaking payments to no one; it would be unreasonable to refuse Travarillo the right to pick up\nthe obligations of Young once the bankruptcy restraining order was terminated; upon payment\nto T—Anchor of $87,787.23 from the registry of the trial court Travarillo would be entitled to\npossession of the motel as owner and holder of the land sales contract of April 4, 1973, and the\ncontract is in full force and effect with all payments due thereunder made current through the\nmonth of September, 1974.\n\nThe conclusions of law by the trial court were that: (1) Travarillo is entitled to equitable relief\nfrom forfeiture of the purchaser's rights under the land sales contract; (2) the land sales contract\nis in full force and effect and that Travarillo is the owner of all the rights of purchaser thereunder;\n(3) T—Anchor is entitled to recover from the registry of the trial court $87,787.23; (4) Travarillo\nis entitled to possession of the motel; and (5) T—Anchor is not entitled to any injunctive relief.\n\nT—Anchor predicated its appeal upon thirty-two points of error. For convenience we shall discuss\nT—Anchor's points of error in the same groupings as in its brief.\n [1] [2] In its first two points T—Anchor contends that the judgment of the trial court denying\nforfeiture of the contract cannot be supported without findings of waiver and default on the part of\nT—Anchor. T—Anchor requested amended and additional findings of fact and conclusions of law\nwhich would have established and held that T—Anchor did not waive its right under the contract\nto forfeiture and that through the effective date of forfeiture, T—Anchor fulfilled its obligations\nunder the contract. Both of these theories of waiver and default by T—Anchor as requested are\ninconsistent with and contrary to the findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the trial court.\nThe trial court need not make findings of fact or conclusions of law which are in conflict with\nthe original findings and conclusions made. Neither is the trial court required to make findings\nof fact on evidentiary matters as distinguished from controlling matters. Plaza Co. v. White, 160\nS.W.2d 312 (Tex.Civ.App.—San Antonio 1942, writ ref'd); Wade v. Taylor, 228 S.W.2d 922\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Amarillo 1949, no writ).

Travarillo Associates, 529 S.W.2d 622 (1975)\n\n\n\nby T—Anchor either are evidentiary if no forfeiture was found to exist prior to a possible waiver\nor default by T—Anchor, or, if they are controlling matters, then such requested findings and\nconclusions are in conflict with the findings of fact and conclusions of law originally made by\nthe trial court that no forfeiture occurred. Further, in view of the holding of the trial court that\nTravarillo is entitled to equitable relief from forfeiture, a finding of waiver or default by T—\nAnchor is not necessary to support the judgment. Points of error numbers 1 and 2 are overruled.\n\n [3] In points of error numbers 3 through 11, T—Anchor contends that the tender of performance\nby Travarillo was deficient and thus cannot operate to prevent forfeiture of the contract of sale.\nPoints of error numbers 3, 5—7, and 9—11 all concern the amount of the tender of money made\nby Travarillo. T—Anchor contends that a tender of the amount necessary to bring the contract\npayments current is not tender of a sufficient amount to put Travarillo in possession of the motel as\nits owner. Such a contention by T—Anchor is *627 predicated upon its assertion that the contract\nwas, indeed, forfeited; therefore, T—Anchor contends that the only amount that can be tendered\nby Travarillo to put Travarillo in possession of the motel is the balance of the unpaid purchase\nprice under the contract of sale. However, the holding of the trial court was that the contract was in\nfull force and effect so that the equity of redemption mentioned in paragraph XIII of the contract\nwas not required to be invoked. Thus, Travarillo was not required to pay the balance of the unpaid\npurchase price since it had never forfeited the contract. By bringing the contract obligations up to\ndate, Travarillo made T—Anchor whole under the contract of sale which was held to be in full\nforce and effect.\n\n\nFurther, in points of error numbers 3—11, T—Anchor contends that the equities are in its favor\nto allow a forfeiture and not in favor of Travarillo to deny forfeiture. The trial court found that it\nwould be exceptionally harsh and unjust to forfeit the monies contributed to the motel project and\nunjust enrichment to T—Anchor to allow forfeiture of Travarillo's rights under the contract in the\nface of unusual circumstances, namely, that the debtor in bankruptcy, Young, was continued in\npossession of the motel while paying no one. The trial court held that the order of the bankruptcy\ncourt prevented forfeiture of the contract until April 12, 1974. The trial court further held that since\nTravarillo was tendering performance in full prior to April 12, 1974, it would be unreasonable\nto refuse Travarillo the right to pick up the contract obligations of its assignor Young upon\ntermination of the restraining order of the bankruptcy court. The trial court found that T—Anchor\ndefaulted on its first and second lien payments because of the restaining orders which continued\nYoung in possession without requiring Young to make contract payments to T—Anchor.\n [4] [5] It is our opinion that the evidence supports the holding of the trial court that Travarillo\nwas entitled to equitable relief from forfeiture. It is an established rule of law that forfeitures are\ndisfavored. Although parties may contract to provide for forfeiture upon default, where equities\nare shown which justify a continuation of the contract rather than forfeiture of it, the forfeiture will\nbe prevented.

Clinton Park Development Co., 224 S.W.2d 729 (Tex.Civ.App.—Galveston 1949, no\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In view of the disfavor with which the law looks upon forfeitures in a contract for the sale\nof land and in the light of the unusual chain of events which eventually left Travarillo as the buyer\nunder the contract ready, willing and able to perform, we overrule points of error numbers 3—11.\n\n [6] T—Anchor contends in point of error number 12 that the trial court erred in holding that\nthe net profits of the motel earned during a period of possession and operation by T—Anchor\nwere the property of Travarillo as owner of complete title to the motel. T—Anchor presupposes\nthat a forfeiture has, in fact, occurred. The trial court held that a forfeiture was prevented by the\nrestraining order of the bankruptcy court. Therefore, possession of the motel by T—Anchor was\nduring a period when Travarillo was entitled to possession, and, under the holding of the trial\ncourt that the contract is in full force and effect, Travarillo is, and T—Anchor is not, entitled to\nthe profits of the operation. It is our opinion that the holding of the trial court is sustained by the\nevidence and the equities of this particular situation. Point of error number 12 is overruled.\n\n [7] In points of error numbers 13—15, T—Anchor contends that it was error to hold that\ndefault in the payment of monthly installments by Young commenced with the failure to make\nthe November, 1973 payment. T—Anchor points to undisputed testimony that payments were\nlate in more than one month prior to November, 1973, and that notices of default were sent to\nYoung. The trial court made no express *628 finding of waiver by T—Anchor. We recognize\nthat where express findings of fact are made by the trial court, independent issuable facts may not\nbe supplied by extension of the express findings. Duncan v. Willis, 157 Tex. 316, 302 S.W.2d\n627 (1957), McKenzie v. Carte, 385 S.W.2d 520 (Tex.Civ.App.—Corpus Christi 1964, writ ref'd\nn.r.e.). However, the same evidence that would support a finding of waiver by T—Anchor supports\nthe trial court's application of equitable principles which would efficiently prevent forfeiture of\nthe contract sale. Testimony by Boyce Box, president of T—Anchor, revealed that T—Anchor\nultimately received purchase money installments up to the payment due in November, 1973, and\nthat an oral extension of time until October 11 was agreed to by T—Anchor after the September,\n1973 payment was made late. This testimony tends to show that T—Anchor considered the\ncontract as continuing after making its initial gesture with respect to forfeiture, and supports the\ngranting of equitable relief to prevent forfeiture. Points of error numbers 13—15 are overruled.\n\n\nIn points of error numbers 16—22, T—Anchor next contends that the trial court erred in failing\nto find certain facts since such findings are, as stated in T—Anchor's brief, ‘supported by the\nuncontroverted evidence.’ The findings requested by T—Anchor relate to the defaults, notices of\nsuch defaults sent to Young and absence of tender of performance by Young, prior to November,\n1973, as claimed by T—Anchor to establish forfeiture of the contract and termination of Young's\nand, therefore, Travarillo's interest under the contract.\n [8] Even if the specific findings requested by T—Anchor had been made, the result reached by\nthe trial court would not necessarily be changed. In fact, the record reveals that there is evidence\nof conduct by T—Anchor showing an intent not to terminate the contract but to continue in a\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   9\n\fT-Anchor Corp. v. Travarillo Associates, 529 S.W.2d 622 (1975)\n\n\n\ncontractual relationship. Even after giving notice concerning forfeiture, T—Anchor accepted late\npayments of purchase price installments although Young failed to comply with its agreement to\nbring the delinquent payments to a current status or to vacate the motel. The findings requested\nby T—Anchor even if made would not, in the light of all the evidence, compel a conclusion of\nlaw by the trial court that the contract was forfeited and cancelled in October, 1973, as contended\nby T—Anchor. The trial court need not make findings of fact on mere evidentiary matters with\nrespect to the ultimate issue. Plaza Co. v. White, supra; Wade v. Taylor, supra. Points of error\nnumbers 16—22 are overruled.\n\n [9] With respect to points of error numbers 23—28 we believe that the requested findings of fact\non which they are grounded relate only to evidentiary matters not required to be included in the\ntrial court's findings of fact. The facts they seek to establish would show that Travarillo failed to\nmake various payments to T—Anchor prior to trial. Such facts, even if included in the trial court's\nfindings of fact, would not compel a result different from that reached by the trial court since there\nwas evidence that Travarillo made tender of performance to bring its contract obligations current\nearly in April, 1973, just prior to dissolution of the Young bankruptcy restraining order. Points of\nerror numbers 23—28 are overruled.\n\n\nThe testimony reveals that after this suit was filed and hearing had on temporary injunction,\nTravarillo attempted to put the motel under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court by filing for\nan arrangement under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act. By its points numbered 29—32, T—\nAnchor contends it was error for the trial court to fail to find that by this action, Travarillo, in\neffect, failed to do equity and effectively withdrew its tender of any sums to T—Anchor, resulting\nin the defeat of any right to prevent forfeiture.\n\nThe trial court made no findings of fact with respect to the Chapter XI proceeding initiated\nby Travarillo. There is much controversy *629 about the reasons for filing the petition for\narrangement under Chapter XI. T—Anchor insists that Travarillo sought to repeat the actions of\nYoung, and thus remain in possession of the motel without being required to make payments to\nT—Anchor. Travarillo insists, on the other hand, that by filing a bankruptcy petition it was only\n‘trying to litigate in every conceivable form’ to protect its rights. Travarillo contends that it wanted\nto use the Chapter XI proceeding ‘to get a court to make a determination that (it) had a right\nto cure because (it) had substantial equities' it was in danger of losing. Morgan Jones, a lawyer\nfor Travarillo, testified that it was upon his advice that the Chapter XI proceeding was initiated,\nasserting that insolvency is not presumed in a Chapter XI proceeding. The only evidence before\nus on the issue of solvency is that Travarillo was solvent.\n [10] [11] The purpose of Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act is to provide a quick and economical\nmeans of facilitating simple compositions among general creditors who have been deemed by\nCongress to need only the minimal disinterested protection provided by the Chapter.

Travarillo Associates, 529 S.W.2d 622 (1975)\n\n\n\nin establishing Chapter XI is to provide for an efficient and orderly method by which the claims of\nunsecured or common creditors of a debtor might be satisfied without resort to general bankruptcy.\n9 Remington on Bankruptcy s 3565, p. 32 (Supp.1975).\n\n [12] In any event, we do not think that the trial court was required to make a finding that Travarillo\nfiled a petition under Chapter XI because such a finding would be evidentiary. Plaza Co. v. White,\nsupra; Wade v. Taylor, supra. Moreover, the evidentiary finding would not necessarily compel\na different conclusion by the trial court regarding such ultimate and vital issue of termination of\nthe contract.\n\n\nFurther, it is our opinion that the case of Smith v. Owen, 43 Tex.Civ.App. 51, 107 S.W. 929 (1908,\nwrit ref'd), cited in appellant's brief in support of its contention that tender had been withdrawn, is\nnot applicable to the facts in the instant case. In that case the vendee pleaded defenses inconsistent\nwith his tender of the purchase money; the court held that the plea of limitation title precluded the\nadjustment of any equities in the vendee's favor that might allow him to pay the unpaid balance\nof the purchase money and hold the land. Id. at 930. The court stated in Smith v. Owens, supra,\nthere were no equities pleaded or proved that would entitle the vendee to defeat the remedy of\nrescission of the contract sought in that case.\n\nIn the instant case we have no pleading by Travarillo of any theory inconsistent with its tender\nof whatever amount the trial court determined to be owing. Further, in the instant case, we find\nevidence to support a judgment in favor of Travarillo upon equitable grounds. By way of cross-\naction Travarillo invoked the equity jurisdiction of the trial court to deny cancellation of the\ncontract.\n\nHere, Travarillo had paid into the registry of the trial court which, in turn, has paid to T—Anchor,\nan amount making Travarillo current in its obligations. The Chapter XI proceeding initiated\nby Travarillo was dismissed, with no change in possession resulting from the proceeding. T—\nAnchor's conduct with reference to the forfeiture that it claims occurred on October 11, 1973\nwas not consistent with such claim of forfeiture. By accepting late payments and by making a\nsubsequent agreement for cure of defects T—Anchor indicated that it continued to consider the\ncontract in force. This is a case where the seller recognized the contract as still in force even\nafter default. Hoover v. General Crude Oil Co., 147 Tex. 89, 212 S.W.2d 140 (1948); Tom v.\nWollhoefer, 61 Tex. 277 (1884). Although it may be contended that T—Anchor may have made\nmoves toward some definite action to exercise its right of forfeiture, yet there is evidence of\nprobative force to support a finding that T—Anchor had not unequivocally *630 declared the\ncontract cancelled at the time Young went into bankruptcy on October 31, 1973.\n [13] [14] Whether the seller has effectively exercised an option of forfeiture for default in\npayment depends not upon the number of hours or days that have elapsed since the default in\nquestion, but upon whether the circumstances are such that the buyer has, by the conduct of the\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Travarillo Associates, 529 S.W.2d 622 (1975)\n\n\n\nseller, been led reasonably to believe that strict application of the right of forfeiture will not be\ninsisted upon, for the time being. A. L. Carter Lumber Co. v. Saide, 140 Tex. 523, 168 S.W.2d 629\n(1943). Suspension of the right of forfeiture depends upon the facts in each case. 77 AmJur.2d,\nVendor and Purchaser, s 589, p. 716; 91 C.J.S. Vendor & Purchaser, s 137, pp. 1076—1077, s 144.\n\n\nT—Anchor cites Stevenson v. Lohman, supra, in support of its contention that equitable relief\nshould be denied. It is noted that the buyer in Stevenson made no tender of all or part of the contract\npayments until after suit in trespass to try title was filed. The buyer advised the seller that he would\nmake no further monthly payments, and the seller treated the contract as abandoned. Travarillo\nhas tendered performance to bring the contract obligations up to date before this suit was filed\nin April, 1974. In the instant case there is evidence that subsequent to the time when T—Anchor\ncontends it first declared a forfeiture, it treated the contract as continuing and not as abandoned.\nAlso, in Stevenson, the court significantly pointed out that the vendor's right of possession upon\ndefault could be defeated by the vendees ‘upon pleading and proving such facts as would make it\ninequitable to enforce it.’ In view of the equities pleaded and proved here, points of error numbers\n29—32 are overruled.\n\nWe recognize that this is a case that requires the weighing of competing equities and that the\nequities do not lie wholly in favor of either party. However, we hold that the trial court's judgment,\nbased on a balancing of equities, is supported by the record, and that the findings requested by T\n—Anchor, even if established, would not compel the trial court to reach a different result.\n\nThe judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\nEnd of Document                                              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(XTO) filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the Vinsons'\nclaims relating to ten oil and gas leases covering the Vinsons' ranch in Wise County, Texas. The\ntrial court granted XTO's motion and denied the Vinsons' motion. The Vinsons, as one or more of\nthe lessors in each of the leases, contend that they are entitled to terminate the leases with XTO, as\nsuccessor lessee, because XTO failed to make “undisputed payments” after demand. Because we\nhold that the Vinsons presented no evidence that they provided XTO with a proper written notice\nor demand for payment as required by the leases, we affirm.\n\n\n\n                                             II. BACKGROUND\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   5\n\fVinson Minerals, Ltd. v. XTO Energy, Inc., 335 S.W.3d 344 (2010)\n\n\n\nThe oil and gas leases at issue originated in 2001 between Johnny Vinson, Vinson Minerals, Ltd.,\nand others as lessors and Threshold Development Company as lessee. Threshold is a Vinson family\ncompany *347 in that the owners, officers, and directors are members of the Vinson family. In\n2003, Antero Resources Corporation bought Threshold's interests as lessee in the leases for $25\nmillion.\n\nIn early 2005, the Vinsons began disputing Antero's calculations of royalty payments to the\nVinsons from 2003 to 2005 and commenced an audit of Antero's accounting records of royalties.\nBy letter of January 25, 2005, the Vinsons informed Antero that they were “waiting on requested\ninformation to complete [the] audit of production and royalty payments” and that the Vinsons'\n“potential claim” for royalty underpayment was $2 million. In March 2005, the Vinsons provided\nAntero with audit exceptions listing, among other complaints, improper deductions from royalty\npayments for compression, fuel, treating, and transportation charges by an “affiliated” pipeline\nowned by Antero “to be determined” but “estimated ... to be in the range of $600,000.” 1\n\nThe relationship between the parties deteriorated as the Vinsons raised other issues, including\nclaims for reassignment of undeveloped acreage, drill site issues, and road and surface damage\nissues. On July 11, 2005, the Vinsons filed suit against Antero for numerous claims—including\ntrespass, breach of contract, incorrect calculation and underpayment of royalties and other\nproduction costs, surface damages, and failure to develop—seeking an unspecified amount of\ndamages and attorney fees.\n\nIn the meantime, two months before the Vinsons filed suit, XTO acquired Antero and the leases.\nXTO was made aware of the outstanding issues claimed by the Vinsons at the time it acquired\nthe leases. In March 2005, the Vinsons faxed XTO a copy of its January 25 letter to Antero\nregarding the status of their claims. By letter dated August 5, 2005, XTO's outside litigation\ncounsel initiated settlement dialogue with the Vinsons' counsel, requesting that the Vinsons (1)\namend their pleadings to substitute XTO as the sole defendant, (2) agree to suspend their ongoing\naudit during litigation, and (3) consider opening discussions with XTO “to see if some or all\nof these issues can be resolved, and good working relations restored, before pursuing litigation\naggressively.” 2\n\nIn a January 18, 2006 letter to the Vinsons' counsel, confirming delivery of documents in response\nto discovery, XTO's counsel reaffirmed its “intention to resolve the royalty payment issues both\nprospectively and [as] to past months, by an agreed method of changed payment and a lump sum\nsettlement for past months once the new payment method is agreed upon.” A few days later,\nXTO's and the Vinsons' accountants and legal counsel met to discuss settlement of all issues in\nthe suit, including the issue of the new methodology to be agreed upon in order to recalculate\nthe disputed royalties. Under the methodology proposed by XTO, its “estimated” preliminary\ncalculation of royalty payments owed to the Vinsons for the period from November 2003 through\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

XTO described this number as an estimate,\nsubject to adjustment as XTO continued reviewing Antero's boxes of accounting *348 records. 3\nThe Vinsons and XTO agreed at this meeting to continue working, without the presence of legal\ncounsel, on the changed methodology to recalculate the disputed royalty payments owed to the\nVinsons during both the Antero period and the period after May 2005, when XTO acquired Antero\n(the XTO period). In this regard, the parties obtained a Rule 408 Agreed Protective Order from\nthe trial court that included a provision for informal meetings of representatives of the parties to\ndiscuss royalty accounting issues. 4\n\nOn March 16, 2006, XTO's counsel wrote the Vinsons' counsel, summarizing the current status\nof the ongoing settlement discussions on all issues and proposing that XTO recalculate all prior\nroyalties under a revised methodology and format and “in due course, make a retroactive payment\nto bring all prior periods up to the new payment methodology.” The letter requested that the\nVinsons present a settlement demand “to resolve all issues in the case” as follows:\n\n            Please discuss these issues with your client and present XTO a settlement\n            demand to resolve all issues in the case. If we have misunderstood your pleading\n            in any respect, or if you would need to discuss any of these issues prior to\n            submitting a demand, please call me at your convenience.\n\nOn May 12, 2006, the Vinsons' counsel responded with a three-page letter faxed to XTO's counsel\n(the May 12 letter). The letter began with the following paragraph:\n\n   In response to your March 16, 2006, letter regarding possible settlement of this matter, [the\n   Vinsons have] been thoroughly engaged in reviewing all of the information available related\n   to this dispute. Now that this review is complete [the Vinsons are] prepared to respond in full\n   to your suggestion as to “what XTO might offer to attempt to resolve the rest of the claims in\n   the lawsuit.”\n\nIn the May 12 letter, the Vinsons' counsel characterized their claims as falling into two major\ncategories, summarized as “surface/lessor issues” and “working interest/reassignment issues,”\nwith four main causes of action. He discussed those issues in detail, including the following:\n\n   Royalty/Accounting Issues. If XTO makes a retroactive payment as represented, including\n   interest and attorney fees, and revises the format for making future payments then this issue\n   should be resolved. Until agreement on each of these matters is reached, in accordance with the\n   terms of [the Vinson] leases ... demand is hereby made for all undisputed payments due under\n   the Wise County leases. As a part of any *349 settlement of this issue XTO will also have to\n   confirm that it will provide [the Vinsons] with daily production information....\n\nThe letter concluded with the following paragraph:\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

XTO Energy, Inc., 335 S.W.3d 344 (2010)\n\n\n\n\n            Considering each of these factors, [the Vinsons] conservatively believe [ ]this\n            case has a value greatly in excess of $30,000,000. Recognizing the risks of\n            litigation and the costs associated therewith, I have been authorized to settle\n            all claims in exchange for a payment in the amount of $9,500,000 and XTO\n            bringing itself into compliance with the Barnett Shale Project Agreement\n            by signing JOA's correctly identifying Threshold's before and after payout\n            working interests after XTO acquired Sinclair Oil Corporation's interest in said\n            agreement, in the same manner as all previously executed JOA's.\n\nOn May 25, 2006, XTO paid the Vinsons the amount of $103,047.68, representing underpayments\nfor royalties owed for the XTO period, and using the new methodology that had been discussed. 5\nThe Vinsons accepted that payment. XTO then began using the new methodology to adjust the\nroyalty calculations previously made by Antero from the 348 boxes of accounting documents,\nwhich were incompatible with XTO's computer system, in order to calculate amounts to be paid\nfor the Antero period. 6\n\nSixty days after sending the May 12 letter, the Vinsons filed an amended petition substituting XTO\nas the defendant. In addition to the claims for damages previously asserted, the Vinsons alleged\nthat XTO was in breach of contract by failing to make “undisputed royalty payments” demanded\nby the Vinsons in the May 12 letter. By the new pleading, the Vinsons added a request for a\ndeclaratory judgment seeking termination of the leases under the following portion of Section 3\n(entitled “Royalty Payment”) of the leases: 7\n\n\n   3. Royalty Payment. Royalties on oil, gas, and other substances produced and saved hereunder\n   shall be paid by [XTO] to [the Vinsons] as follows: ...\n\n      e. ... If [XTO] wrongfully or unreasonably withholds any undisputed payment or payments\n      due to [the Vinsons] for a period of sixty (60) days after written demand for payment is made\n      by [the Vinsons] on [XTO at the above address (or such other address as may be specified in\n      writing hereafter by XTO) ], at the election of [the Vinsons] this lease may be terminated. The\n      foregoing sentence *350 shall not apply to payments withheld by [XTO] because [XTO]\n      contests such payments in good faith so long as [XTO] has timely paid to lessor all undisputed\n     payments due to [the Vinsons]. 8\nOn October 16, 2006, the Vinsons filed a partial motion for summary judgment asking the trial\ncourt to declare the leases terminated under Section 3(e) of the leases because of XTO's failure to\ncomply with the Vinsons' alleged May 12 demand that “all undisputed amounts” be paid within\nsixty days. 9\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

XTO Energy, Inc., 335 S.W.3d 344 (2010)\n\n\n\nOn November 1, 2006, XTO paid the Vinsons $725,942—the “estimated” amount of $643,548.19\nin royalty underpayments during the Antero period for improper transportation charges on the\nAntero affiliated pipeline, plus $61,006 in interest and $21,387 in surface damages. XTO made\nsubsequent payments of $16,972.79 and $2,380.82 to the Vinsons later in November 2006 as\nfurther adjustments for the underpaid amounts by Antero, as well as $150,000 in attorney's\nfees. After a hearing, the trial court denied the Vinsons' motion for partial summary judgment.\nEventually, the parties settled all other claims and issues, with the Vinsons reserving their right\nto pursue the lease forfeiture claim.\n\nXTO then filed a motion to exclude the May 12 letter under Texas Rule of Evidence 408, together\nwith a motion for no-evidence summary judgment. XTO's no-evidence summary judgment motion\nasserted that the Vinsons had no evidence\n\n   (1) that it fully and sufficiently described in writing the alleged breach or default and properly\n   notified XTO of the forfeiture to result from said breach;\n\n   (2) that undisputed royalty payments were due and owing under the Leases;\n\n   (3) that undisputed payments were withheld in bad faith; and\n\n   (4) that undisputed payments were wrongfully or unreasonably withheld.\n\nThe Vinsons responded to XTO's motion and also requested that the court reconsider their motion\nfor partial summary judgment. The trial court granted XTO's motions to exclude and for summary\njudgment without specifying the grounds relied on, denied the Vinsons' motion for reconsideration,\nand dismissed the Vinsons' case with prejudice. This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n                                                   III. ISSUES\n\nOn appeal, the Vinsons raise three issues. First, they contend that the trial court erred by denying\ntheir motion for summary judgment and granting XTO's motion for summary judgment because\nthe Vinsons made written demand for payment of undisputed sums in the May 12 letter, XTO\nfailed to pay those sums within sixty days, and the leases expressly provide that they may be\nterminated if “undisputed” sums are not paid within sixty days of written demand. Second, the\nVinsons assert that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding from evidence the May 12\nletter, which they contend was their “written demand” pursuant to the terms of the leases. Third,\nthe Vinsons argue that the trial court erred by excusing XTO from complying with the leases and\nby *351 applying the doctrine of disproportionate forfeiture.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

XTO Energy, Inc., 335 S.W.3d 344 (2010)\n\n\n\nXTO responds that the trial court correctly excluded the May 12 letter from evidence and that\nthe trial court correctly granted its summary judgment motion because the Vinsons produced no\nevidence of a proper demand, no evidence that unpaid royalties were “undisputed,” no evidence\nthat amounts claimed were “wrongfully or unreasonably” withheld, and no evidence that the\nVinsons gave proper notice “fully describing” any breach or default by XTO as required by the\nleases for forfeiture. XTO further asserts that the Vinsons were made whole by the payments they\naccepted, which foreclosed any election to sue for forfeiture of the leases.\n\n\n\n                                                IV. ANALYSIS\n\nAt the core of the Vinsons' appeal is their complaint that the trial court abused its discretion\nby excluding from evidence and refusing to consider the May 12 letter, which the Vinsons\ncharacterize as their “Demand Letter.” The Vinsons contend that the May 12 letter was admissible\nand was a proper written demand that met the requirements of Section 3(e) of the leases. We will\nfirst consider whether the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the May 12 letter from\nevidence.\n\n\nA. The May 12 Letter Was Not a “Demand Letter.”\n [1] The Vinsons argue that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the May 12 letter\nfrom evidence under Texas Rule of Evidence 408 as a compromise offer because the letter was\nnot a compromise settlement demand but was clearly a “Demand Letter” notifying XTO of its\nobligation to pay an amount that XTO knew it owed but was withholding until all issues could be\nresolved. The Vinsons point out that the letter contained wording from Section 3(e) of the leases\nmaking “demand ... for all undisputed payments due” and that it expressly referred to the Wise\nCounty leases, which was, according to the Vinsons, sufficient language to put XTO on notice that\nthe leases gave it sixty days to respond in order to defeat forfeiture of the leases. Thus, the Vinsons\nargue that the letter was admissible as evidence of a demand. XTO replies that the language of\nthe letter is couched as a global settlement demand offering to compromise all issues in the case\nfor a total specific amount (the only amount demanded in the letter); that the amount owed for\nroyalties was disputed; that if the Vinsons intended a demand for payment in the letter, it was not\nrecognized as such by XTO's forty-year veteran oil and gas litigation attorney; and that the alleged\ndemand was misleading and surreptitious with no specified amount to cure a default and did not\nspecify a time within which to pay but, instead, indicated it would remain open until settlement.\nThus, XTO argues the May 12 letter was properly excluded by the trial court.\n\n[2] Offers of settlement are not admissible to prove liability or invalidity of a claim or its amount.\nTex.R.

Whether the evidence is being\nimpermissibly offered as evidence of liability or for some other valid reason is a matter within the\ntrial court's discretion. Tatum, 881 S.W.2d at 837. Only when the trial court abuses its discretion\nwill its ruling be disturbed on appeal. 10 See id.\n\nXTO contends that, when the “demand” language is properly viewed in the context of the\nremainder of the May 12 letter and the parties' ongoing negotiations, the letter was clearly a part of\nsettlement negotiations, not a demand for payment of undisputed amounts triggering forfeiture of\nthe leases if not paid. 11 XTO points out that the May 12 letter's first paragraph begins: “In response\nto your March 16, 2006, letter regarding possible settlement of this matter, ....” [Emphasis added.]\nMoreover, the very paragraph of the letter the Vinsons rely upon as setting forth the demand\nbegins by expressly acknowledging, immediately before the words they claim to be a demand\nfor payment, that a settlement had not been reached, stating: “Until agreement on each of these\nmatters is reached. ...” [Emphasis added.] Immediately following the demand language, that same\nparagraph references payment of such undisputed amounts as a part of a proposed settlement,\nstating that “[A]s a part of any settlement of this issue, XTO will also have to confirm” that it will\nprovide various production information in a timely manner. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThen, as XTO notes, the letter closes with a straightforward compromise settlement demand for\nthe entire case, stating that the Vinsons value the case at more than $30 million, but “[r]ecognizing\nthe risks of litigation and the costs associated therewith, I have been authorized to settle all claims\nin exchange for a payment in the amount of $9,500,000.” [Emphasis added.] The Vinsons deny\nthat the last paragraph of the letter was intended to constitute a settlement demand for all claims\n—including their claim for unpaid royalties—and insist that the letter made clear that the Vinsons'\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

XTO Energy, Inc., 335 S.W.3d 344 (2010)\n\n\n\ncounsel was only authorized to settle all other matters for a specified amount. We disagree with\nthe Vinsons' post hoc interpretation. “All claims” necessarily includes the Vinsons' *353 claim\nfor unpaid royalties, which were sought in the pending litigation.\n\nThe May 12 letter speaks for itself. It begins with a discussion of settlement, states that it is in\nresponse to XTO's request for a settlement demand, clearly and unambiguously concludes with a\nsettlement demand for “all claims,” and was written during the parties' ongoing negotiations for\nsettlement of an existing lawsuit that included the Vinsons' claim for underpayment of royalties.\nThe May 12 letter also concludes by conceding a right to which the Vinsons believe they are\nentitled. See Mercedes–Benz, 720 S.W.2d at 857 (holding that an offer of compromise exists when\na party concedes some right to which he believes he is entitled to bring about a mutual settlement).\nSpecifically, the letter concludes with a valuation of “this case” greatly in excess of $30 million\nand an offer to settle “all claims” for $9.5 million. The language and context of the letter negate\nany reasonable interpretation of the language buried in the middle of a sentence, buried in the\nmiddle of a paragraph, and buried in the middle of the three-page letter as a stand-alone “demand”\nfor payment under Section 3(e) of the leases that can be considered separate and apart from the\nrest of the letter.\n\n [5] The purpose of rule 408 is to encourage settlement. See MG Bldg. Materials, Ltd. v. Moses\nLopez Custom Homes, Inc., 179 S.W.3d 51, 61 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2005, pet. denied); State\nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Wilborn, 835 S.W.2d 260, 261 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1992,\norig. proceeding) (noting settlement offers are excluded to allow a party to “buy his peace and\nencourage settlement of claims outside the courthouse”). Permitting a party to recharacterize, after\nthe fact, what was clearly a settlement demand as a “Demand Letter,” to use the Vinsons' label,\nbased upon part of a sentence inserted in the middle of a letter otherwise ostensibly devoted from\nbeginning to end to compromise and settlement, in order to invoke the harsh consequences of\nforfeiture, would reward obfuscation and “gotcha” tactics and would chill rather than encourage\nparties to negotiate in good faith toward a compromise and settlement of their claims.\n\nBy granting XTO's motion to exclude, the trial court could have found, within its discretion, that\nthe May 12 letter was not a “demand letter” sufficient to trigger a forfeiture under the terms of\nthe leases but was part of a settlement demand inadmissible under rule 408 offered solely to prove\nXTO's liability for forfeiture of its leases. Cf. Mercedes–Benz, 720 S.W.2d at 857 (holding trial\ncourt was within its discretion to determine a letter “was more in the nature of an ultimatum than\nan offer to compromise” and, therefore, admissible into evidence). We will not disturb the exercise\nof the trial court's discretion in excluding the May 12 letter from the summary judgment evidence.\nSee id.; Allen v. Avery, 537 S.W.2d 789, 791 (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1976, no writ) (upholding\ntrial court's exclusion of compromise settlement from evidence). We overrule the Vinsons' second\nissue.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               12\n\fVinson Minerals, Ltd. v. XTO Energy, Inc., 335 S.W.3d 344 (2010)\n\n\n\n\nB. Insufficient Evidence Existed to Raise an Issue of Fact as to Notice and Demand to\nEntitle the Vinsons to Forfeiture of the Leases.\n [6] The Vinsons contend in their first issue that the trial court erred by denying their motion for\nsummary judgment and granting XTO's motion for summary judgment because the May 12 letter\nconstituted written demand for payment, XTO failed to pay those sums within sixty days, and the\nleases expressly provide that they may be terminated if “undisputed” sums are not paid within\nsixty days of written *354 demand. But even if the trial court erred by excluding the May 12\nletter from evidence as a demand, the Vinsons were only entitled to damages, not forfeiture of\nthe leases. Thus, the Vinsons have failed to show how the exclusion of the May 12 letter led to\nrendition of an improper judgment. See Tex.R.App. P. 44.1(a).\n\n [7] The promise to pay royalties is generally a covenant, 12 which will give rise only to a remedy\nof damages in absence of a specific clause allowing the option of termination of the lease upon\nthe lessee's failure to pay. Blackmon, 276 S.W.3d at 606 (citing Linton E. Barbee, The Lessor's\nRemedies for Nonpayment of Royalty, 45 Tex. L.Rev. 132, 159 (1966)). As XTO acknowledges,\nthe Vinson leases are among the “few” that contain a specific clause making non-payment of\nroyalties a condition subsequent, expressly permitting the Vinsons, as lessors, to elect to seek\nforfeiture of the lease. See Barbee, 45 Tex. L.Rev. at 159–60.\n\n [8] [9] Upon breach of a condition subsequent, the lessor must elect between seeking damages\nor forfeiture; the lease is not automatically terminated upon breach. Blackmon, 276 S.W.3d at 605;\nsee Chicago, T. & M.C. Ry. Co. v. Titterington, 84 Tex. 218, 223–24, 19 S.W. 472, 474 (1892).\nThe lessor must take affirmative steps by re-entering or seeking a judicial declaration of forfeiture\nas the Vinsons did in this case. See Barbee, 45 Tex. L.Rev. at 159.\n\n [10] [11] The rule of strict construction disfavoring forfeiture applies when a forfeiture is\nclaimed for breach of a condition subsequent. Coastal Oil & Gas Corp. v. Roberts, 28 S.W.3d 759,\n763 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 2000, pet. granted, judgm't vacated w.r.m.); Tickner v. Luse, 220\nS.W. 578, 580 (Tex.Civ.App.-El Paso 1920, writ ref'd); see Patrick H. Martin & Bruce M. Kramer,\n3 Williams & Meyers, Oil and Gas Law § 656.2 (2008) (stating that strict construction “governs\nforfeiture provisions based on failure to make proper and timely payment of royalty”). It is settled\nlaw that the rule of construction against the right of forfeiture applies to oil and gas leases. Wisdom\nv. Minchen, 154 S.W.2d 330, 334 (Tex.Civ.App.-Galveston 1941, writ ref'd w.o.m.) (citing Ryan\nv. Kent, 36 S.W.2d 1007, 1011 (Tex. Comm'n App.1931, judgm't adopted)). Thus, if the lease\ncontract is susceptible of two reasonable interpretations, it should be construed as to prevent a\nforfeiture. Ryan, 36 S.W.2d at 1011; Wisdom, 154 S.W.2d at 334.\n\n[12] Additionally, if the lease contains a provision giving the lessee a right of notice of any breach\nor default before declaring any forfeiture, it must be “literally complied with.” Coastal, 28 S.W.3d\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Stribling, 142 S.W.2d 564, 566 (Tex.Civ.App.-Austin 1940, no writ)).\nUnder such a provision, the lessor cannot claim a forfeiture without giving the lessee the benefit\nof notice of any default and an opportunity to remedy it. Wisdom, 154 S.W.2d at 334.\n\nThe Vinsons contend that this case is controlled by Coastal Oil & Gas Corp. v. Roberts, in which\na global demand referencing no stated amount of royalties due, and not mentioning termination,\nwas nevertheless held sufficient to entitle the lessor to forfeiture of a lease under a provision that,\naccording to the Vinsons, is almost identical to Section 3(e) of their *355 leases. See 28 S.W.3d at\n764–65. We agree that Coastal is similar to this case but find it distinguishable in material respects.\n\nParagraph 3 of the Coastal leases, specifically regarding royalties and other payments for\nproduction, and similar to section 3(e) of the Vinsons' leases, provided:\n\n            Royalties and other payments for production shall be due and owing to Lessor\n            within 120 days from the date of first production.... If Lessee wrongfully or\n            unreasonably withholds any such payment or payments due to Lessor for a\n            period of thirty (30) days after written demand for payment is made by Lessor\n            on Lessee at the above address (or other such address as made by [sic] specified\n            in writing hereafter by Lessee), at the election of Lessor this lease may be\n            terminated.\n\nId. at 761–62.\n\nLitigation had been pending by the lessor against Coastal for several years for underpaid royalties\non several other leases, but not for the “E” or “F” lease. See id. at 761. Coastal, as lessee, failed\nto pay any royalties due on the F–6 well on its “F” lease by the 120th day after first production\nof gas from the well it drilled on that property. See id. at 762. Coastal suspended payment of any\nroyalties due on the F–6 well while it awaited return of a signed division order from the lessor.\nSee id. Without returning the division order, the lessor sent a written demand letter that read, in\ntoto, as follows:\n\n            Plaintiffs hereby make demand for all royalties due and owing pursuant to each\n            paragraph 3 of the (a.) Coates “E” lease and (b.) Coates “F” lease. Plaintiffs\n            demand payment in full from each separate defendant, their proportionate share\n            of all amounts due. You have thirty (30) days, after receipt of this letter, to pay\n            said amounts. We appreciate your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nId. The lessor subsequently amended its pleadings in the existing suit and sought to terminate\nthe lease based upon Coastal's “wrongful or unreasonable” failure to pay royalties after written\ndemand for payment. See id. Coastal contended that the lessor failed to give proper notice because\nthe generic written demand letter did not explain the amounts owed, how Coastal had improperly\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  14\n\fVinson Minerals, Ltd. v. XTO Energy, Inc., 335 S.W.3d 344 (2010)\n\n\n\ncalculated royalties, or how the lessor wished royalties to be calculated, and was thus “insufficient,\ndeliberately vague and written in such a way as to keep [Coastal] from being able to adequately\nrespond.” Id. The Corpus Christi Court of Appeals affirmed a summary judgment for the lessor,\nholding that the written demand sufficed to invoke the right of the lessor to terminate, despite\nthe rule that oil and gas leases must be construed against forfeiture, 13 and despite the additional\nrule that the prerequisites of notice of forfeiture must be “literally complied with” 14 because the\nCoastal lease did not require the lessor to explain the particulars of the breach or to specify how\nthe lessee had defaulted and, thus, the lessor's global demand did “literally compl[y]” with the\nrequirement of written demand for *356 payment. Id. at 763–65. Coastal differs significantly\nfrom this case. First, the demand in Coastal was clearly a “written demand” as required by the\nlease, unlike the alleged demand here, which was contained within a letter offering to settle\nthe pending litigation. See id. at 762. Coastal clearly recognized the demand as such because it\nresponded and complained that the demand letter was inadequate. See id. Most significantly, the\nCorpus Christi court's holding in Coastal that the lessor “literally complied” with the forfeiture\nclause rests upon the absence of any language in that lease requiring the lessor to describe the\nbreach or specify the particulars of the default. See id. at 764. Holding that “literal compliance”\nwith the prerequisite of notice to forfeit did not require the lessor to identify the specifics of the\nbreach, the court of appeals noted in a footnote:\n\n\n   An example of a clause in a lease requiring the lessor to indicate the specifics of the breach is\n   found in 4 HOWARD R. WILLIAMS & CHARLES J. MEYERS, OIL & GAS LAW § 682.1,\n   at 340 (1984) (citing Ridl v. E.P. Operating Limited Partnership, 553 N.W.2d 784 (N.D.1996)).\n   The clause provides, in relevant part, “In the event the Lessor considers that Lessee has failed to\n   comply with an obligation hereunder, express or implied, Lessor shall notify Lessee in writing\n   specifying in what respect Lessor claims Lessee has breached this lease....”\n   Id. at 764 n. 3.\nThe leases in this case, unlike the one in Coastal, do contain such a clause as the example cited\nin the footnote, requiring the Vinsons, as lessors, to provide written notice “fully describing the\nbreach or default” to entitle them to forfeiture of the leases. Section 11 of the leases, applicable\nto all breaches or defaults, states:\n\n            No litigation shall be initiated by [the Vinsons] for damages, forfeiture, or\n            cancellation with respect to any breach or default by [XTO] hereunder, for a\n            period of at least sixty (60) days after [the Vinsons] ha[ve] given [XTO] written\n            notice fully describing the breach or default, and then only if [XTO] fails to\n            remedy the breach or default within such period. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThe lease in Coastal contained no such provision, and the court refused to write into the contract\na requirement that it did not provide. Id. at 764–65.

They offered no answer to the prerequisites of notice and\ncure under Section 11 of the leases in their opening brief except to assert that Sections 11 and\n3(e) involve “different circumstances.” For the first time in their reply brief, they argue that\nthey repeatedly made their complaints *357 known in writing in their audit exceptions provided\nto XTO as early as March 2005, and more than 60 days expired before they brought suit. But\nnone of those communications specified any amount due or gave XTO a time within which to\ncure the alleged default. For example, the Vinsons' audit exception with respect to the improper\ntransportation charges stated only that “the Dollar amount ... to be determined but is estimated ...\nto be in the range of $600,000.” And none of their communications claimed any amount to be\n“undisputed.” 15 Thus, even if the language in the May 12 letter was intended to constitute notice, it\nwas for an unspecified amount to be paid by an unspecified time for unspecified claims or charges,\nas to all of which XTO was left to guess. Where forfeiture of a lease is dependent on the making of\na demand for performance, the demand must be proper, specific, and reasonable. Outdoor Sys., Inc.\nv. BBE, L.L.C., 105 S.W.3d 66, 71 (Tex.App.-Eastland 2003, pet. denied) (holding that a lessor's\ndemand letter was excessive, unreasonable, and imprecise when it demanded payment within ten\ndays of an unspecified amount based upon “total arrearages from the inception of the Leases”).\n\nThe Vinsons' May 12 letter states neither a time limit within which XTO is to make the payments\nnor notice of any amount other than the $9.5 million proposed for settlement of all claims. See id.\nMoreover, the Vinsons have never identified any amount that was “undisputed” either in the trial\ncourt or in this court. The Vinsons acknowledge as much in their reply brief in this court, conceding\nthat they “could not know what was undisputed by XTO; thus, [they] could not demand a specific\namount.” If the Vinsons could not know the amount they were demanding to be paid by XTO, it\nis difficult to see how they can argue that XTO had notice of what amount was “undisputed.”\n\nThe Vinsons' solution to this conundrum is to argue that “[e]ven if XTO was uncertain as to exactly\nhow much money it owed, it clearly knew (from the parties' prior dealings and discussions) that it\nowed [the Vinsons] in excess of $600,000; accordingly, it had a duty to tender the portion that was\nundisputed.” The Vinsons also quote from the September 25, 2006 deposition of XTO's accounting\nrepresentative, in which she stated that upon recalculating the monies due to the Vinsons, she\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

XTO Energy, Inc., 335 S.W.3d 344 (2010)\n\n\n\ncame up with an amount “in the neighborhood of $650,000 to $700,000,” that she estimated the\namount owed for the Antero period for transportation charges was $643,548.19, and that she agreed\nwith the Vinsons' counsel's estimate that XTO recognized since at least January of 2006 that it\nowed “something north of $600,000” for past due royalty. The Vinsons cite no authority defining\n“undisputed” to include an “estimated” amount, nor do we agree that “in the neighborhood of” or\n“something north of” a particular amount equates to an “undisputed amount.”\n\nThe May 12 letter is insufficiently specific to constitute “written notice fully describing the\nbreach or default” as required *358 by Section 11 of the leases, particularly in the context of\nthe remainder of the letter and the ongoing negotiations for settlement. See id.; see also Cedar\nRapids Television Co. v.

Specifically,\nwritten notice seeking to invoke the harsh remedy of termination or forfeiture must be clear and\nunambiguous. See Ogden v. Gibraltar Sav. Ass'n, 640 S.W.2d 232, 233–34 (Tex.1982) (holding\nthat equity demands clear and unequivocal notice be given of a party's intent to exercise such harsh\nconsequences as acceleration or foreclosure); see also Shumway v.

XTO Energy, Inc., 335 S.W.3d 344 (2010)\n\n\n\nThe Vinsons argue that the reference in the letter to the Wise County leases and the words\n“undisputed payments” and “demand” were sufficient to alert XTO that the Vinsons were seeking\nto invoke Section 3(e) of the leases, which allowed an election for forfeiture. Even if the letter\nwas sufficient to invoke Section 3(e) as a demand for payment, it was not sufficient for them to\ninvoke termination under Section 11. The May 12 letter was written in the context of settlement\nnegotiations for numerous claims for alleged breaches of covenants and conditions. At best, an\nanalogy may be made to cases under the Uniform Commercial Code, where attempted notices\nof termination of a contract—“mixed” with words of negotiation and compromise—have been\nheld ineffective as a matter of law. See, e.g., Stovall v. Pub. Paper Co., 284 Or. 53, 584 P.2d\n1375, 1380 (1978) (holding notice of termination insufficient where it mixed words of termination\nwith words of compromise, negotiation, and present obligation); Morris Silverman, 284 F.Supp.2d\nat 974 (holding notice of termination ineffective where *359 party made repeated oral and\nwritten statements that it intended to continue contract); Gatt Trading Inc. v. Sears, Roebuck, &\nCo., No. 02–CV–1573–B, 2004 WL 2511894, at *10 (N.D.Tex. Nov. 8, 2004) (holding letter\nattempting to terminate insufficient where it invited further negotiation); Accu–Weather, 644\nA.2d at 1254 (holding notice of termination that made reference to continuing contract to later\ndate held “ineffectively ambiguous”); cf. Dresser Indus., Inc. v. Pyrrhus AG, 936 F.2d 921, 930\n(7th Cir.1991) (holding notice clearly invoking termination clause that also indicated willingness\nto negotiate sufficient where notice also stated further discussions would not limit effect of\ntermination notice).\n\nBecause we have determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the May\n12 letter from evidence, and because we conclude that the May 12 letter was also insufficient as\na matter of law to constitute a proper written notice fully describing the breach or default in order\nfor the Vinsons to seek forfeiture, we hold that the May 12 letter is no evidence that the Vinsons\nprovided XTO with a proper “written demand” for payment or notice of default as required by the\nleases, entitling them to a declaratory judgment forfeiting the leases.\n\n [16] Alternatively, the Vinsons argue that they made a sufficient demand by filing their amended\npetition and attaching the May 12 letter with all three pages of text redacted except the few words\nin the middle of the letter that they contend is a demand. However, by precluding initiation of\nlitigation until notice has been provided, the lease agreements effectively prevent the use of a\npleading to make a demand. Moreover, the Vinsons did not make a “demand” by their amended\npleading. Rather, they used XTO's alleged failure to pay within sixty days after May 12, 2006, as\nthe reason to assert their election to terminate.\n\nAs previously discussed, Section 11 of the leases precluded the Vinsons from “initiat[ing]\nlitigation” unless XTO had received “written notice fully describing the breach or default” and\nhad “fail[ed] to remedy the breach or default within” sixty days of receiving the notice. Because\nsuit could not be filed until XTO had at least sixty days after notice in which to remedy the breach\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

XTO Energy, Inc., 335 S.W.3d 344 (2010)\n\n\n\nor default, the letter's attachment to the Vinsons' amended petition could not serve as the required\nnotice of default. See Deace, 142 S.W.2d at 566 (holding prerequisite of thirty days' written\nnotice to cancel or terminate lease prior to filing of suit not literally complied with and, therefore,\nineffective where suit was brought twenty-five days after notice); see also Westwind Exploration\nInc. v. Homestate Sav. Ass'n, 696 S.W.2d 378, 382 (Tex.1985) (holding that contracting parties\nintend every clause to have some effect); Lacquement v. Handy, 876 S.W.2d 932, 937 (Tex.App.-\nFort Worth 1994, no writ) (stating that language in contracts is given its plain, ordinary meaning).\n\nMoreover, we do not agree that attaching the redacted letter to XTO's amended petition was\nsufficient to meet the leases' pre-suit notification requirement. See Huff v. Fid. Union Life Ins.\nCo., 158 Tex. 433, 443, 312 S.W.2d 493, 500 (1958) (holding that neither the filing of a lawsuit\n“arising out of a contract nor the allegation of a demand in the pleadings constitutes presentment\nof a demand” to entitle a party to attorney fees as required by Chapter 38 of the Texas Civil\nPractice and Remedies Code); see also Richardson v. Foster & Sear, L.L.P., 257 S.W.3d 782, 785\n(Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2008, no pet.) (stating that the filing of a lawsuit does not constitute the\nsixty-day pre-suit notice of a Deceptive Trade Practices Act claim as *360 required by section\n17.505(a) of the business and commerce code).\n\nAbsent proper notice under Section 11 of the leases, the Vinsons are not entitled to forfeiture of the\nleases, even if the May 12 letter constituted a proper “written demand” for payment. Finding no\nevidence that the Vinsons provided XTO legally sufficient written notice or demand for payment\nof undisputed sums as required by the terms of the leases, we hold that the trial court correctly\ngranted XTO's no-evidence motion for summary judgment. For the same reasons, we hold that\nthe Vinsons failed to establish entitlement to a traditional summary judgment declaring the leases\nforfeited for XTO's failure to pay undisputed amounts within sixty days of a written demand. We\noverrule the Vinsons' first issue. 16\n\n\n\n                                              V. CONCLUSION\n\nHaving overruled the Vinsons' first and second issues and having found it unnecessary to address\nthe Vinsons' third issue, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n\n\n\nLIVINGSTON, C.J. filed a concurring opinion.\n\nTERRIE LIVINGSTON, Chief Justice, concurring.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  19\n\fVinson Minerals, Ltd. v. XTO Energy, Inc., 335 S.W.3d 344 (2010)\n\n\n\nI respectfully concur with the majority opinion and write separately only to make some distinctions\nregarding the rule 408 admissibility question raised by the Vinsons' May 12, 2006 “demand” letter\nand the sufficiency of their “election of forfeiture.” See Tex.R. Evid. 408.\n\nTexas Rule of Evidence 408 mandates exclusion of evidence of settlement offers unless offered for\nsome reason other than to establish liability. Id. Additionally, the burden is on the objecting party\nto show that the evidence was not offered for some other reason or purpose allowed by rule 408.\nSee In re Univar USA, Inc., 311 S.W.3d 175, 182 (Tex.App.-Beaumont 2010, orig. proceeding).\nAnd courts have recognized the admission of some portions of settlement agreements if relevant\nfor proof of some other element than liability. Id.\n\nBecause the letter was written in response to XTO's request to provide such a “settlement demand,”\nthe Vinson demand letter must be read in context with that preceding request. Basically, XTO\nasks, “What will it take to settle all the various other/remaining claims [other than the accounting/\nroyalty issues] asserted in the Vinsons' latest pleading?” In other words, XTO's letter implies\nthat it believes they have basically resolved the accounting/royalty issues. And apparently, the\nMay 12, 2006 Vinson letter acknowledges this: “[T]his issue should be resolved.” However, that\nbelief is clearly contingent upon XTO's performance in accordance with the representations it had\nmade to the Vinsons regarding the accounting/royalty issues. Furthermore, the Vinsons follow this\nstatement with a clear demand for “all undisputed payments due under the Wise County leases.” As\nthe Vinsons point out, XTO admits that it has calculated and is ready to pay undisputed amounts,\namounts that necessarily can only be fully determined by XTO. Thus, I believe that this *361\nportion of the May 12, 2006 letter is a demand for payment of undisputed amounts, not evidence\nof a settlement offer, and that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding this portion of the\nVinsons' response under rule 408. This portion of the letter was admissible because it was offered\nfor “another purpose than validity of the claim.” Tex.R. Evid. 408.\n\nAs to the forfeiture issue, we are to construe oil and gas leases disfavoring forfeiture. See Coastal\nOil & Gas Corp. v. Roberts, 28 S.W.3d 759, 763 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 2000, pet. dism'd by\nagr.). If a lease states how to give notice of demand or forfeiture, such notice must comport with\nthe lease. Id. at 764.\n\nHere, the remaining question is whether this portion of the letter is a sufficient demand and whether\nit made clear that failure to perform within a certain time would result in the Vinsons exercising\ntheir forfeiture rights. I would agree with the majority as to the insufficiency of the forfeiture. The\naccounting/royalty demand portion gave no notice of a time limit within which to perform, which\nthe lease states can be no less than sixty days with prior written notice. Furthermore, and more\nimportantly, the last paragraph of the letter, which would have also had to have been admitted,\nincludes the value of the entire “case” and is an offer to settle “all claims.” Again, there is no\nnotice or mention of the possibility of forfeiture. And as XTO points out, the last paragraph refutes\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  20\n\fVinson Minerals, Ltd. v. XTO Energy, Inc., 335 S.W.3d 344 (2010)\n\n\n\nthe claim of forfeiture because the Vinsons offered to settle all aspects of the case for a sum\ncertain. Thus, I believe, and would conclude, that the letter, although admissible in part, provided\ninsufficient notice of what performance was required and when and insufficient notice that the\nfailure to timely perform would result in the exercise of the election to forfeit the leases.\n\nBecause my analysis would result in the same affirmance of the trial court's granting of XTO's\nmotion for summary judgment, I join in the judgment of the court and concur only to set forth\nthese distinctions.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    In his affidavit, Threshold's CFO stated, “Although I was unable to calculate a precise figure at that time because I had not received\n        all documentation I had requested, I was able to arrive at the estimate within a matter of hours, and I noted it in the audit exceptions.”\n2       In the letter, XTO observed that “relations between Antero and [the Vinsons] had deteriorated to a point that discussions for a\n        reasonable resolution of some or all of the issues of the lawsuit became impossible.”\n3       Following XTO's acquisition of Antero, XTO received 348 boxes of Antero records. To establish the $643,548.19 estimate, XTO\n        “pieced together” information contained in 59 boxes from Antero labeled “accounting records.” However, at the time of this estimate,\n        XTO was finding numerous accounting records in the other 289 boxes. The document XTO provided to the Vinsons that contained\n        its estimate was titled “Preliminary Accounting Review” and included the following notation: “These are preliminary findings only.\n        All calculations are subject to further examination and revision by XTO Energy, Inc. Accounting personnel.”\n4       The last paragraph of the order, in part, states:\n              [The Vinsons] and [XTO] further agree that at certain times in this Lawsuit, it may be necessary for representatives of both [the\n              Vinsons] and [XTO] to meet in person or via telephone, without counsel for either [the Vinsons] or [XTO] present, to discuss\n              certain accounting issues raised in this Lawsuit. Such informal meetings ... shall be governed by Texas Rule of Evidence 408.\n5       Joni Van Meter, XTO's accounting representative, explained in her September 2007 deposition that she was able to calculate\n        applicable charges for gathering and transporting already in XTO's own computer system, to give them separate deduct codes, and\n        to flag royalties for each individual owner as being exempt from those deductions.\n6       The Vinsons dispute that the “methodology” issue had anything to do with the amounts they claim for underpaid royalties but had\n        to do with Antero's improper use of weighted averages and composite rates in calculating the royalties. According to the Vinsons,\n        royalties were not being calculated on the higher of the proceeds from sale of the gas or the market value but simply on the amount\n        realized, contrary to the leases, and XTO's proposal was to use an index price to simplify calculations. The Vinsons provide no\n        record references to support this proposition but contend that the changed methodology would have no effect on the “undisputed\n        amounts” at issue.\n7       The Vinsons' amended pleading attached a copy of the May 12 letter with all parts redacted except the single paragraph relied upon\n        by the Vinsons as their demand for payment. Only when this amended pleading was filed did XTO's counsel learn of the Vinsons'\n        interpretation of the May 12 letter as a “demand” that allegedly entitled them to termination of the leases.\n8       The Vinsons omitted the last sentence of Section 3(e) of the leases in their amended petition and in their opening brief in this Court.\n        Because we resolve this appeal on other grounds, we do not reach XTO's cross-point that the summary judgment may be upheld on\n        the ground, raised in its motion for summary judgment and not addressed by the Vinsons on appeal, that the Vinsons produced no\n        evidence that the payments were not contested by XTO in good faith.\n9       The Vinsons sought partial summary judgment because other claims were pending at the time the motion was filed.\n\n10      The abuse of discretion standard of review is limited to the trial court's determination to exclude the May 12 letter from evidence.\n        We review the trial court's summary judgment ruling de novo. Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp Advisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d\n        844, 848 (Tex.2009).\n11      As late as October 2007, the Vinsons represented to the trial court in a “Memorandum of Settlement,” filed in response to an order\n        of the trial court prior to a scheduling conference, that the “bulk of the parties' settlement discussions to date have focused on [the\n        Vinsons'] royalty claims.”\n12      There are three primary qualifications generally imposed on the various ownership interests created by an oil and gas lease: (1)\n        general and special limitations, (2) conditions subsequent, and (3) covenants.

To the extent that both interpretations may be reasonable, we must adopt the\n       construction that avoids forfeiture. Coastal, 28 S.W.3d at 763; Wisdom, 154 S.W.2d at 334. We conclude that the term “undisputed”\n       as used in Section 3(e) of the leases requires a specific amount to be undisputed by both parties, which was never the case here.\n16     Because the summary judgment in favor of XTO may be upheld based upon no evidence of a sufficient demand, we need not\n       consider the Vinsons' third issue as to whether the trial court erred by excusing XTO's compliance and by applying the doctrine of\n       disproportionate forfeiture, nor need we consider XTO's alternative grounds raised in the trial court to sustain its summary judgment\n       based on no evidence that it “wrongfully or unreasonably” withheld undisputed payments or did not act in “good faith” in contesting\n       such payments under Section 3(e).

The trial court erred by granting summary judgment that the lease\n         terminated because Escondido did not correctly reconcile royalty\n         underpayment. ..............................................................................................33\n         A.        Texas law disfavors lease termination and prohibits termination\n                   absent clear, unequivocal, and unambiguous lease language. ...........33\n         B.        Paragraph XIV does not provide that the lease terminates for a\n                   failure to reconcile underpaid royalties. .............................................37\n                   1.       The lease treats underpayment and nonpayment\n                            differently, with different words in different provisions. ........38\n                   2.       Paragraph XIV terminates for nonpayment of royalties,\n                            not underpayment.....................................................................44\n                   3.       Paragraph XIV does not address remedies for failure to\n                            reconcile underpayment. ..........................................................46\n\n                   4.       In any event, Paragraph XIV cannot support termination\n                            so long as Escondido’s interpretation is reasonable. ...............49\n\n         C.        Independently, termination is improper because Justapor did\n                   not establish Escondido was required to reconcile any\n                   underpayment. ....................................................................................49\n\n\n\n\n                                                             4\n\f             1.       Justapor did not establish any underpayment for\n                      production months February 2012 – January 2013 based\n                      on unambiguous lease terms. ...................................................50\n                      a.       The special pricing provision replaced all pricing\n                               measures, or alternatively was ambiguous. ...................51\n                      b.       The royalty price measure on which Justapor relies\n                               is ambiguous or meaningless. ........................................54\n             2.       Fact issues exist regarding production months November\n                      2011 – January 2012. ...............................................................55\n      D.     Independently, lease termination is improper because it is\n             inequitable on these facts. ..................................................................57\n             1.       It would be inequitable to enforce a termination in light\n                      of Justapor’s conduct. ..............................................................58\n             2.       Forfeiture is inequitable because it would be\n                      disproportionate with the alleged breach. ................................61\n\n             3.       Forfeiture would be inequitable because Jones did not\n                      raise it for 18 months after the alleged termination. ................62\n\n      E.     Remedy: the summary judgment should be reversed in its\n             entirety and partial summary judgment rendered that there was\n             no termination.....................................................................................62\n\nII.   Regardless of whether the lease terminated, Justapor did not\n      conclusively establish Escondido was a bad-faith trespasser.......................63\n\n      A.     Escondido was not a bad-faith trespasser per se because it\n             lawfully entered into possession of the land. .....................................64\n      B.     Justapor also did not conclusively establish that Escondido\n             lacked a good-faith belief in the superiority of its title. .....................67\n\n      C.     Because Escondido was not a bad-faith trespasser, the judgment\n             should be reversed and the case remanded for further\n             proceedings. ........................................................................................69\n\n\n\n\n                                                      5\n\fIII.     The trial court erred by granting summary judgment declaring the\n         parties’ rights and requiring conveyance of Escondido’s leasehold\n         interests regarding the “vacancy tract.” ........................................................71\n         A.        Justapor did not conclusively establish its declaratory judgment\n                   claim. ..................................................................................................72\n                   1.       Justapor did not conclusively establish that the interests\n                            to be conveyed include leasehold interests. .............................73\n                   2.       Unless “mineral interests” and “additional interests”\n                            mean the same thing, the letter agreement is ambiguous. .......75\n                   3.       Justapor did not establish that it had chosen an entity to\n                            which any interests should be conveyed. .................................76\n                   4.       Justapor did not identify any leasehold interest that\n                            should have been, but was not, conveyed. ...............................77\n         B.        Justapor was not entitled to specific performance. ............................77\nConclusion and Prayer ............................................................................................80\nCertificate of Compliance .......................................................................................82\nCertificate of Service ..............................................................................................82\n\nAppendix .................................................................................................................83\n\n\n\n\n                                                              6\n\f                                       INDEX OF AUTHORITIES\n\n\n                                                                                                     Page(s)\n\nCases\nAm.

Joe\n                          Lopez\n\nTrial Court Disposition   Summary judgment in favor of plaintiff, Justapor,\n                          Ranch Company, L.C. In its judgment the trial\n                          court:\n\n                             • Declared that the mineral lease terminated\n                               on March 2, 2012 and that ownership of\n                               minerals reverted to Justapor;\n                             • Awarded more than $12 million from\n                               Escondido to Justapor in trespass damages\n                               consisting of all production proceeds for all\n                               oil-and-gas sales from March 2, 2012 to\n                               August 2014. The judgment did not credit\n                               Escondido for either the costs of production\n                               or for improvements;\n                             • Awarded Justapor all production proceeds\n                               after August 2014 until the date Escondido\n                               relinquishes possession, again with no\n                               deductions for costs or improvements;\n                             • Declared Escondido a bad-faith trespasser\n                               at all times; and\n                             • Ruled that Escondido takes nothing on its\n                               counter claims, which means it receives\n                               nothing for its $33 million in\n                               improvements.\n\n                          CR3:1859-62. The court severed Justapor’s\n                          claims for exemplary or punitive damages (based\n                          on the claim of bad-faith trespass) and its claims\n                          for attorney’s fees, expert witness fees, and\n                          accounting costs. CR3:1897-98. Those claims are\n                          now stayed.\n\n\n\n                                     13\n\f                                 ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n      1.     Lease termination. Did the trial court err in granting Justapor’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment and in denying Escondido’s cross motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment? Specifically, did it err in ruling that the Justapor lease\n\nterminated based on an underpayment of royalties, and in granting the relief that\n\nflowed from that ruling, when:\n\n   • paragraph XIV of the lease did not provide that an underpayment of\n\n      royalties or failure to reconcile an underpayment terminated the lease;\n\n   • Justapor’s claim of termination turns on words in the lease that do not\n\n      support termination or, alternatively, are ambiguous; and\n\n   • equity does not favor termination and forfeiture here?\n\n      2.     Bad-faith trespass. Did the trial court err in declaring Escondido a\n\nbad-faith trespasser as a matter of law when (1) Escondido lawfully exercised its\n\nright to possession when it entered the property, and (2) Escondido presented\n\nevidence that it did not believe the lease terminated, which negates bad faith?\n\n      3.     Vacancy tract. Did the trial court err in rendering summary judgment\n\non Justapor’s declaratory judgment claim? Further, did the trial court err in\n\nawarding specific performance regarding conveyance of interests in the “vacancy\n\ntract?”\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\f                            STATEMENT OF THE FACTS\n\nOverview\n\n      This appeal concerns an oil-and-gas lease between Justapor Ranch\n\nCompany, L.C. (the lessor) and Escondido Resources II, L.L.C. (the lessee).\n\nEscondido spent more than $33 million to drill seven gas wells and to make other\n\ncapital improvements to the property. CR3:1149 (¶5). Escondido paid Justapor\n\nmore than $5.7 million in royalties for the first five years of production. CR3:1148.\n\n      But Justapor stands to profit much more on its legal claims that the lease\n\nterminated in 2012 and that Escondido has been a bad-faith trespasser. The reason?\n\nAs Justapor reads the lease, royalties were underpaid by about $81,000. CR3:1148;\n\nCR1:331-332. And as Justapor reads the lease, any amount of underpayment not\n\nreconciled by March 1 of any year terminates the lease. The trial court agreed,\n\ngranting summary judgment that:\n\n   • the lease terminated on March 2, 2012;\n   • Escondido owes more than $12 million in gross production proceeds from\n     March 2, 2012 through August 2014 with no deduction for Escondido’s\n     costs of production;\n   • Escondido owes all gross production proceeds from August 2014 through\n     the date Escondido relinquishes possession, again with no deductions;\n   • Escondido recovers none of its $33 million in improvements; and\n   • Escondido faces punitive damages in a severed proceeding because the trial\n     court ruled it was a bad-faith trespasser as a matter of law.\n\nCR3:1859-61; 1796-99.\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\fThe parties\n\n      Justapor owns an 803-acre ranch in Webb County. CR3:1325 (¶1). The sole\n\nowner of Justapor is Jimmy Jones. CR3:1022. Jones is a trial lawyer whose\n\npractice includes “land, oil and gas.” CR3:1023.\n\n      In May 2008 Jones contacted Escondido, an oil-and-gas production and\n\ndevelopment company, to ask whether it was interested in leasing mineral interests\n\non the ranch. CR3:1325 (¶2).\n\nLease negotiation and terms\n\n      In early June 2008, when Jones was discussing with Escondido a possible\n\nlease of minerals from Justapor, Jones also offered to represent Escondido as its\n\nattorney in negotiating other oil and gas leases. CR3:1328 (¶¶12-13); CR3:1325-26\n\n(¶¶3-5). Beginning in mid-June, Jones represented Escondido in negotiating two\n\nother leases. CR3:1328 (¶13). As compensation, Escondido agreed to Jones’\n\nrequest to give him an overriding royalty interest on one lease. CR3:1328 (¶14).\n\n      During this same time, Jones also negotiated his own lease, for Justapor,\n\nwith Escondido’s Vice President, David Wrather. CR3:1325 (¶1-2). Escondido was\n\nnot represented by separate counsel in negotiating the Justapor lease, and Jones\n\nnever suggested that his client retain separate counsel. Id. (¶2). Jones drafted both\n\nthe lease and an amendment that the parties signed on the same day, June 24, 2008.\n\nCR3:1325-26. This dispute turns on three sections of the lease and the amendment.\n\n\n                                         16\n\f      1 – Gas-royalty provision and its amendment—Paragraph III(b)\n\n      Jones drafted a gas-royalty provision that appeared verbatim in the ultimate\n\nlease. CR3:982 (¶III(b)); CR3:1231-32 (¶III(b); CR3:1325 (¶3). This paragraph,\n\nIII(b), provided that Escondido shall calculate and pay a 25% royalty on gas from\n\nthe lease based on the highest of four price measures:\n\n      ... Lessee shall calculate and pay royalties to Lessor on One-Fourth\n      (1/4th) of all gas produced from this lease and its constituents and\n      products sold or used therefrom, which royalties shall be calculated\n      and paid to Lessor based upon the highest of (i) the CURRENT\n      MARKET VALUE of such gas production from this lease which is\n      sold by, through or under Lessee or used by, through or under Lessee,\n      (ii) the CURRENT HOUSTON SHIP CHANNEL PRICE for such gas\n      production, as hereinafter defined, or (iii) the CURRENT\n      PROCEEDS REALIZED BY LESSEE for such gas production,\n      without deduction of any costs or expense except as hereinafter\n      stipulated or, (iv) the highest sales price of any gas were gas produced\n      from the property could be present when sold to a third party.\n\nCR3:982 (¶III(b)). The first three pricing measures—CURRENT MARKET\n\nVALUE, CURRENT HOUSTON SHIP CHANNEL PRICE, and CURRENT\n\nPROCEEDS REALIZED BY LESSEE—are further defined in part III(b). Id. But\n\nthe fourth pricing measure—part III(b)(iv)—is not defined in the lease and is not a\n\ncustomary royalty provision. Id.; CR3:1137 (¶2).\n\n      Wrather told Jones that Escondido did not want to base royalty payments on\n\nthe highest of these four price measures, but instead wanted to base the royalty on\n\nthe sale price Escondido had negotiated with a purchaser, Enterprise. CR1325 (¶4).\n\nWhen the parties signed the lease in June 2008, the Enterprise pipeline was the\n\n\n                                        17\n\fonly market readily available to purchase and transport gas from the Justapor\n\nRanch. CR3:1326 (¶5). Wrather sent Jones Enterprise’s purchase terms. Id.;\n\nCR3:1274.\n\n      Jones responded that Justapor would agree to a royalty based on the\n\nEnterprise price, but only for as long as Escondido held the lease and did not\n\nassign it to another party. CR3:1325 (¶4). To accomplish this, Jones proposed a\n\nnon-assignable amendment that (1) would incorporate the pricing terms of\n\nEscondido’s agreement with Enterprise, but (2) would apply only to Escondido,\n\nnot any assignee. Id. The parties ultimately agreed to an amendment “to provide a\n\nspecial royalty pricing provision, based on the Enterprise price.” CR3:1326 (¶4).\n\nJones drafted this amendment. Id. CR3:1325 (¶4).\n\n      This special pricing provision was reflected in the following sentence of the\n\nlease amendment:\n\n      Provided however, Lessee shall have the right to enter into gas sales’\n      contracts that will determine the price upon which gas royalty is\n      calculated if such contracts provide no less than a price\n      redetermination every six months and provide the following minimum\n      terms....\n\nCR3:1015 (minimum terms omitted); CR3:1326 (¶5). But the amendment, as\n\ndrafted by Jones, placed this provision in a paragraph labeled as an amendment to\n\nParagraph III “(b) ii.” CR3:1014-15. It appeared at the end of a long paragraph that\n\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\fdefined “HOUSTON SHIP CHANNEL PRICE” using the same language as the\n\noriginal lease. CR3:1015.\n\n      Escondido understood that the amendment’s special pricing provision was a\n\nsubstitute for all four pricing provisions in Paragraph III(b) of the lease. CR1326\n\n(¶5). But Justapor later took the position that the purpose of the amendment was\n\n“to amend specifically the Houston Ship Channel price to reflect what they were\n\ngetting from Enterprise.” CR3:1036.\n\n      2 – Accounting and adjustment provision—Paragraph III(g)\n\n      Oil-and-gas producers frequently receive adjusted information from\n\npurchasers that changes the volume and price on which a royalty payment was\n\nbased, often months after the royalty was paid. CR3:1149 (¶6). And producers\n\noften make mistakes in royalty calculations or disagree lessors about prices,\n\nvolumes, or methodology used to calculate royalty. CR3:1138 (¶7). Accordingly,\n\nparagraph III(g) of the lease is a lengthy clause that addresses a number of subjects\n\nrelating to discrepancies in royalty payments, such as accounting for royalties,\n\nnotice and disputes over royalty deductions, adjustments for overpayment of\n\nroyalty, and adjustments for underpayment. CR3:987-98 (III(g)). Several aspects\n\nof this clause are relevant.\n\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\f      Accounting—Escondido was required to provide Justapor with a detailed\n\naccounting of specific aspects of the royalty calculation on a monthly basis.\n\nCR3:987 (III(g)).\n\n      Overpayment—Paragraph III(g) also addressed how the parties would\n\nreconcile overpayment of royalty:\n\n      If it is agreed by Lessor or the royalty owner in question that a royalty\n      owner was overpaid, then the overpaid royalty owner has the option of\n      repaying such overpayment or allowing Lessee to recoup such\n      overpayment out of future royalty payments on a schedule and in\n      monthly amounts agreed to by such overpaid royalty owner and\n      Lessee. Any overpaid royalty owner shall not be charged interest on\n      overpaid sums.\n\nCR3:987-88 (III(g)).\n\n      Underpayment—Paragraph III(g) also addressed how the parties would\n\nreconcile underpayment of royalty:\n\n      In the event the prices and/or volumes used by Lessee in calculating\n      and payment of production royalties paid to Lessor was less than\n      those required to be paid, Lessee shall issue its check to make up the\n      difference on or before March 1st of each year.\n\nId. Justapor has conceded that no language in paragraph III(g) says the failure to\n\nreconcile underpayment by March 1 terminates the lease. CR3:1043:18-22.\n\n      Escondido reviewed prices and volumes on a monthly basis. CR3:1117:24-\n\n1118:14. Over the life of the lease, Escondido made 15 reconciliation payments to\n\nJustapor, which totaled more than $441,000. CR3:1149 (¶8).\n\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\f      3 – Nonpayment provision—Paragraph XIV\n\n      Paragraph XIV of the lease addressed the nonpayment of royalties.\n\nCR3:996-97. The following is the relevant part of this paragraph, with the key\n\ndisputed language in bold:\n\n      Royalties payable to Lessor in the manner hereinabove provided\n      for are due and payable to Lessor within a period of sixty (60)\n      days following each month’s production of oil or gas produced\n      and sold from the premises. Thereafter, such payments shall be\n      delinquent and will bear interest at the rate of Ten (10%) percent per\n      annum, compounded monthly, until paid. In the event that such\n      royalties are not paid and become delinquent, and there is no title\n      dispute or title defect, this lease shall terminate ipso facto on the\n      date that such royalties were due and not paid. In the event such\n      royalties are not paid and become delinquent, Lessor without other\n      notice than this paragraph, shall be authorized to file suit in the\n      District Court of Webb County, Texas, for recovery of such\n      delinquent royalties....\n\nCR3:996-97 (¶XIV) (bold added, underlining in original).\n\n      Justapor has conceded that Escondido never failed to pay monthly royalties\n\nwithin 60 days following monthly production, as Article XIV requires.\n\nCR3:1041:17-1042:3. Instead, it claims that some royalties were paid in the wrong\n\namount. Id.\n\n      While Jones and Wrather were negotiating the Justapor lease, Jones told\n\nWrather that he had drafted a “tough agreement” in case Escondido ever assigned\n\nits rights under the Lease Agreement to another party. CR3:1329 (¶17). But Jones\n\ntold Wrather that he would work out with Escondido any issues that might arise\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\fbetween them. Id. Based on that conversation and the fact that Jones was\n\nEscondido’s attorney in other matters, Wrather believed the parties would\n\namicably resolve any differences. CR3:1329. Jones never mentioned that he\n\nbelieved the termination provision meant that the lease could terminate for\n\nunderpayment of royalties, no matter how small. CR3:1329 (¶17).\n\nEscondido drilled wells, made site improvements, and paid royalties\n\n      After the lease was signed, Escondido made more than $33.1 million in\n\nimprovements to the Justapor Ranch. CR3:1149 (¶5); CR3:1112:24-1113:11.\n\nThese included roads and ponds as well as seven wells. CR3:1113:10-16. Of this\n\namount, about $10 million was spent on drilling costs and other improvements\n\nafter March 2, 2012, the date on which Justapor claims the lease terminated.\n\nCR3:1220-21.\n\n      To transport gas from Justapor Ranch to Enterprise, Escondido built a meter\n\nsite and a pipeline across the ranch to connect with the Enterprise pipeline system.\n\nCR3:1326 (¶6). To facilitate this, Escondido and Justapor signed a Surface Site\n\nAgreement, which Escondido then assigned to Enterprise. Id.; CR3:1282-88.\n\n      Escondido first paid royalties in June 2009. CR3:1148 (¶3). In 2011\n\nEnterprise reduced the amount of gas it purchased from Escondido because of\n\ncapacity constraints on its pipeline system. CR3:1326 (¶7). To make up for the\n\n\n\n\n                                        22\n\freduction in sales to Enterprise, Escondido sold gas from the Justapor Ranch to\n\nKinder Morgan. Id.\n\n      From its first production in June 2009 until April 2014, Escondido paid\n\nJustapor more than $5.7 million in royalties. CR3:1148 (¶3). Justapor has not\n\ndisputed the amount of royalties that were paid for production occurring before\n\nOctober 2011. See CR3:330-31.\n\nJones first claims that the lease terminated\n\n      Before the current dispute arose, Justapor claimed that the lease terminated\n\non another ground.\n\n      In June 2011, Jones told Escondido that the lease had terminated “ipso\n\nfacto” when Escondido purportedly underpaid a compensatory royalty under article\n\nV of the lease. CR3:1070:5-1071:11; CR3:1072:11-1074:17. But Jones later\n\nadmitted that the lease did not terminate as the result of an underpayment.\n\nCR3:1073:3-1074:13. The parties ultimately resolved their disagreement over the\n\ncompensatory royalty by letter agreement dated August 9, 2011. CR1:445-48;\n\nCR3:1308-11.\n\n      As part of this letter agreement, Escondido agreed to convey, to an entity of\n\nJustapor’s choice, certain interests in a 42-acre tract known as the “vacancy tract.”\n\nCR3:977. Two different versions, both initialed and signed on the same date, use\n\ndifferent words to memorialize the parties’ agreement. One version requires\n\n\n                                         23\n\fEscondido to convey mineral interests it already has acquired in the Justapor\n\nRanch “as well as all other mineral mineral [sic] interests [Escondido] acquire[s]\n\nin this land after [Justapor’s] approval & consent.” CR3:1310 (emphasis added).\n\nThe other version requires Escondido to convey mineral interests it already has\n\nacquired in the Justapor Ranch “as well as all other additional interests we acquire\n\nin this land after your approval and consent.” CR1:447 (emphasis added).\n\nEscondido gave Jones executed deeds conveying all mineral interests owned or\n\nsubsequently acquired by Escondido in the Vacancy Tract. CR3:1327-28 (¶11).\n\nJustapor later asserted that Escondido must convey not only mineral interests\n\nacquired in Justapor Ranch, but also all leasehold interests. CR1:255.\n\nJones’ actions prevent Escondido’s sales to Enterprise\n\n      In October 2011 Enterprise announced it would resume purchasing gas from\n\nthe Justapor Ranch because its capacity constraints had lifted. CR3:1326 (¶8). But\n\nin the same month, Jones sent Enterprise a letter announcing that the Enterprise\n\nsales meter Surface Site Agreement between Justapor and Enterprise terminated\n\nbecause Enterprise missed one $4,500 yearly lease payment in May. CR3:1299,\n\n1326 (¶8), 1092:5-11, CR3:1282. Jones also told Enterprise that it could not use\n\nthe meter and that he was going to seize its equipment. CR3:1092:7-19. The\n\nSurface Site Agreement did not provide for automatic termination upon default,\n\nbut instead provided that Justapor must give notice and an opportunity to correct\n\n\n                                        24\n\fthe late payment before the lease terminated. RR3:1284 (¶15). Justapor gave no\n\nnotice and no opportunity to cure, and refused to accept Enterprise’s late rental\n\ncheck. RR3:1054:17-1059:13. As a result of Jones’ claim of termination,\n\nEnterprise could not purchase gas from the Justapor Ranch. CR3:1326-27 (¶8).\n\n      Unable to sell to Enterprise, Escondido could only sell to Kinder Morgan at\n\na lower daily spot price or shut in the wells until it found a purchaser for a higher\n\nprice. CR1:341:5-13; CR3:1327 (¶9). It began negotiating sales to other higher-\n\npriced markets in order to sell several months later. Id. In the meantime, rather than\n\nsell to Kinder Morgan at the lower daily spot price, Escondido proposed to shut-in\n\nthe wells until it could finalize these higher-price deals or secure a new surface-site\n\nagreement between Jones and Enterprise. CR3:1326-27 (¶¶8-9). Escondido also\n\ntold Jones that the price to be realized from the sale of gas at the daily spot price\n\nwould be lower. Id. (¶9). But Jones insisted that Escondido sell gas at the lower\n\ndaily spot price and not shut-in the wells for any time. Id.\n\n      Escondido made sales at the lower daily spot price for three months\n\nbeginning in October 2011, which resulted in royalties to Justapor that were $3,851\n\nless than the Enterprise special pricing provision set out in the amendment.\n\nCR1:340:13-23; CR3:1148 (¶4). It has not made up this $3,851 underpayment\n\nbecause Justapor caused it to receive a lower price and because Jones verbally\n\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\fagreed to the royalty he was going to get based on the lower daily spot price.\n\nCR1:340:20-341:20; CR3:1089:13-20.\n\n      Dispute over royalties for production months after January 2012\n\n      In May 2013, Justapor hired Charlie Graham to audit Escondido’s records\n\nregarding the calculation of royalties. CR3:1025:24-1026:18. Graham determined\n\nthat Escondido’s calculations of royalties on a price-received basis were correct.\n\nCR3:1337:8-19; 1338:8-24. Graham did not audit the royalty calculations on other\n\nbases, such as market value or the Houston Ship Channel price. CR3:1336:6-17.\n\nGraham believed that Escondido was trying to properly calculate the quantity and\n\nprice of gas sales. CR3:1339:18-20.\n\n      Justapor sued Escondido in August 2013, claiming the lease had terminated\n\ndue to an underpayment of royalties. CR1:22, and 25. Before suing, Justapor gave\n\nEscondido no notice that it believed Escondido had underpaid gas royalties.\n\nCR3:1044:20-1045:9. And it gave Escondido no opportunity to cure. Id.\n\n      Justapor initially claimed that the lease terminated “as early as April 2012”\n\nbecause royalty payments for production beginning in February, 2012, were based\n\non a weighted average price in breach of pricing provision III(b)(iv). RR3:1304,\n\n1305. Justapor claimed that the lease terminated because of the underpayment\n\nalone. RR3:1304. Justapor later amended its claim to assert, for the first time, that\n\nan underpayment triggered termination if it was not corrected by March 1 of the\n\n\n                                         26\n\ffollowing year. CR1:150. Later, Justapor’s expert identified two periods in which\n\nhe claims Escondido underpaid the royalty:\n\n   • October 2011 – January 2012 production: alleged underpayment of\n     $3,851;\n\n   • February 2012 – January 2013 production: alleged underpayment of\n     $77,107.\n\nCR1:320, 331-32; CR3:1148 (¶4).\n\n      The parties’ experts disagree over whether royalties were underpaid at all\n\nbetween February 2012 and January 2013. If the special pricing provision in the\n\namendment replaced the lease’s royalty price entirely, as Escondido contends, then\n\nEscondido correctly calculated the royalty based on current proceeds. CR1150\n\n(¶11). Justapor presented no summary-judgment evidence of any underpayment\n\nbased on that measure. But if the special pricing provision in the lease amendment\n\nreplaced only the Houston Ship Channel Price, as Justapor contends, then the\n\namount of these underpayments was disputed by two experts. According to\n\nJustapor’s expert, the amount of underpayment would be $77,107. CR1:331;\n\nCR3:1148 (¶4). But according to Escondido’s expert, even assuming Justapor’s\n\ninterpretation of the contract, the correct amount of underpayment would be\n\n$22,107. Id. (¶¶11, 13).\n\n\n\n\n                                       27\n\fSummary judgment proceedings and final judgment\n\n      Justapor and Escondido filed cross motions for summary judgment on the\n\nissue of whether the lease had terminated. The trial court denied Escondido’s\n\nmotion, granted Justapor’s motion, and signed a final judgment in Justapor’s favor.\n\nCR3:1796-99; 1857-62. The court ruled that the lease terminated on March 2, 2012\n\nand that all of Escondido’s interests under the lease reverted to Justapor at that\n\ntime. CR3:1859.\n\n      The court declared Escondido a bad-faith trespasser and that it has never\n\nbeen a good-faith trespasser. CR3:1859. As a result of that ruling, the court\n\nawarded not only an accounting of all underpaid royalties, but also awarded\n\nJustapor all of Escondido’s post-March 2, 2012 production proceeds, with no\n\ndeduction for expenses. CR3:1861. The amount awarded through August 31, 2014\n\nwas more than $12 million, with an unspecified award of all additional production\n\nproceeds from that date through the date Escondido relinquishes possession. Id.\n\nThe court dismissed Escondido’s counterclaims, including its claims for\n\nreimbursement based on Escondido’s improvements to the property. CR3:1860;\n\nCR1:142-43. The court severed Justapor’s claims to recover punitive damages and\n\nattorney’s fees based on this judgment. CR3:1897-1900.\n\n      Justapor also moved for summary judgment on its claim for declaratory\n\njudgment, asking the court to interpret the letter agreement as requiring Escondido\n\n\n                                        28\n\fto convey both “mineral and leasehold” interests acquired by Escondido in\n\nJustapor Ranch. CR1:155 (¶34), 254-55. The trial court granted summary judgment\n\ndeclaring that the letter agreement requires conveyance of both mineral and\n\nleasehold interests acquired by Escondido in the Justapor Ranch. CR3:1797. In\n\naddition, the trial court awarded specific performance requiring Escondido to\n\nconvey these interests to Justapor on or before the date the judgment becomes final\n\nand non-appealable. CR3:1858-59.\n\n\n\n\n                                        29\n\f                             SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      Termination and forfeiture. Texas law requires a heightened level of\n\nclarity in lease language before an automatic-termination clause can legally kill a\n\nlease. The point is to disfavor forfeiture of a lessee’s rights unless the lessor makes\n\nexplicit that draconian intent. Under Texas law, an enforceable termination clause\n\nmust be clear, unequivocal, and unambiguous.\n\n      The termination clause in this lease fails that test. Paragraph XIV does not\n\nprovide that a payment pennies less than owed divests the lessee of its rights,\n\nconverts its capital investments, and threatens punitive damages. Rather, it\n\nterminates only for nonpayment of monthly royalties. It specifically addresses\n\ninstances in which the lessor goes to the mail, only to find no monthly check. It\n\nsays that the lease will terminate if “such royalties are not paid.…”\n\n      Paragraph III(g) is the remedy for payments made that are less than owed—\n\npayments that are “less than those required to be paid.” Nothing in that paragraph\n\neven hints at the capital punishment Justapor seeks. The nonpayment paragraph\n\nprovides for termination; the underpayment paragraph does not.\n\n      The trial court’s ruling that the lease terminated based on underpayment of\n\nroyalties violates basic rules governing lease termination and forfeiture provisions.\n\nIt blurs the line in the oil-and-gas industry that distinguishes royalty nonpayment\n\nfrom underpayment. Because the trial court’s core legal ruling is wrong, Justapor’s\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\fjudgment must be reversed. And Escondido is entitled to summary judgment that\n\nthe lease survives.\n\n      Bad faith. Even if the lease had terminated as a matter of law, the trial court\n\nwrongly concluded that Escondido was a bad-faith trespasser as a matter of law.\n\nEscondido entered into possession of the land under the Justapor lease before any\n\nadverse claim and long before Jones embarked on his windfall-litigation strategy.\n\nEscondido did not believe the lease terminated—for good reason that should\n\nsurvive even an affirmance of the trial court’s core holding. Bad faith is inherently\n\na fact question for a jury. The evidence here could not conclusively establish that\n\nEscondido was a bad-faith trespasser.\n\n      Vacancy tract conveyance. The trial court also erred by granting summary\n\njudgment on Justapor’s declaratory judgment claim regarding the vacancy tract,\n\nbecause the parties’ letter agreement unambiguously requires Escondido to convey\n\nonly mineral interests, not leasehold interests.\n\n      Appellate courts exist for cases like this.\n\n\n\n\n                                          31\n\f                                    ARGUMENT\n\nStandard of Review\n\n      “When both parties move for summary judgment, each party must carry its\n\nown burden, and neither can prevail because of the failure of the other to discharge\n\nits burden.” Williams Consol.

App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, no pet.). “Because each\n\nparty was a movant, the burden for each was the same: to establish entitlement to a\n\nsummary judgment by conclusively proving all elements of the claim or defense as\n\na matter of law.” Id. Thus, the questions presented by the standard of review are:\n\n   • Issue 1: Termination: Did the lease terminate as a matter of law? Or did the\n\n      evidence conclusively establish that it did not terminate?\n\n   • Issue 2: Bad faith: Did the summary-judgment evidence conclusively\n\n      establish Escondido was a bad-faith trespasser?\n\n   • Issue 3: Vacancy tract: Did Justapor conclusively establish its\n\n      interpretation of the letter agreement or its (unpleaded) right to specific\n\n      performance?\n\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\fI.    The trial court erred by granting summary judgment that the lease\n      terminated because Escondido did not correctly reconcile royalty\n      underpayment.\n\n      This is not an ordinary contract construction case. Under Texas law, lease\n\nlanguage must meet a heightened level of clarity and plain language in order to\n\nprovide for automatic termination. If the conditions for termination are not clear,\n\nunequivocal, and unambiguous, the lease will not terminate. Nor will termination\n\nbe enforced if forfeiture would be inequitable.\n\n      The trial court erred in granting summary judgment that the lease\n\nterminated, and it erred in denying Escondido’s cross-motion for partial summary\n\njudgment that it did not terminate, for three independent reasons:\n\n      (1) the lease did not clearly, unequivocally, and unambiguously provide for\n\n      termination based on failure to reconcile underpayment of royalty;\n\n      (2) Justapor did not conclusively establish that Escondido failed to correctly\n\n      reconcile any underpayment of royalty; and\n\n      (3) termination and forfeiture are impermissible under Texas law because\n\n      they would be inequitable on these facts.\n\n      A.     Texas law disfavors lease termination and prohibits termination\n             absent clear, unequivocal, and unambiguous lease language.\n\n      The automatic termination of a lease or other contract is a forfeiture.

Where a contract is so\n      vague in its terms that a court cannot determine its meaning, it would\n      be unjust to enforce a forfeiture under it against one whose only fault\n      has been to possibly mistake its meaning. Forfeitures are harsh and\n      punitive in their operation. They are not favored by the law, and ought\n\n\n                                         36\n\f      not to be.

Paragraph XIV does not provide that the lease terminates for a\n             failure to reconcile underpaid royalties.\n\n      Paragraph XIV of the lease does not clearly, unequivocally, and\n\nunambiguously provide for termination based on either an underpayment of\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\froyalties or a failure to reconcile underpayment.

The beginning of\n\nthis analysis is “the contract’s express language.” Id.\n\n      This lease contains two separate provisions with different procedures for (1)\n\nadjustments of past royalty payments including overpayment and underpayment,\n\nand (2) nonpayment. The key language of these provisions is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\fIII(g)—royalty adjustments, overpayment,               XIV—nonpayment\n           and underpayment                      CR3:996-97 (¶XIV) (bold emphasis\n   CR3:987-88 (¶III(g)) (emphasis added)                     added).\n\n“In accounting to Lessor for royalties payable“Royalties payable to Lessor in the\nhereunder, Lessee shall be required, on a     manner hereinabove provided for\nmonthly basis, if requested by Lessor, to     are due and payable to Lessor\naccount to Lessor for each well on leased     within a period of sixty (60) days\npremises based upon the volume of             following each month’s production\nproduction…the BTU…content of such            of oil or gas produced and sold from\nproduction, the royalty interest in such      the premises.

The provisions use different words. The discussion of underpayment in\n\n III(g) refers to an amount of payment: “payment of production royalties paid to\n\n Lessor” that are “less than those required to be paid.” And other parts of paragraph\n\n                                          39\n\fIII(g) refer to adjustments to past royalty amounts for deductions, overpayment,\n\nand underpayment. In contrast paragraph XIV expressly refers to a failure to pay\n\nmonthly royalties on time: “such royalties are not paid and become delinquent.”\n\nCR3:996 (¶XIV).\n\n      The use of different phrasing is consistent with industry custom and usage.\n\nThe oil-and-gas industry does not equate an underpayment of royalty with a\n\nnonpayment. CR3:1137 (¶3). Nor does the industry consider neglecting to\n\nreconcile a prior underpayment as failing to make a payment at all. Id.\n\n      b. The provisions address different concepts. Just as the oil-and-gas\n\nindustry differentiates royalty nonpayment from royalty underpayment, CR1:1137\n\n(¶3), so does this lease.\n\n      Paragraph III(g)—including parts not quoted above—addresses topics all\n\nrelating to adjustments to royalties. These topics include accounting, deductions,\n\nwithholding of taxes, reconciliation of overpayment, and reconciliation of\n\nunderpayment (“on or before March 1st of each year”). These detailed adjustment\n\nprovisions exist because gas purchasers frequently send the producer adjusted data\n\nabout volume or price many months after the royalty is paid, thus requiring a\n\nroyalty adjustment. CR3:1149 (¶6).\n\n      In contrast, paragraph XIV applies only to the deadline for monthly royalty\n\npayments (“sixty (60) days following each month’s production”), and the\n\n\n                                        40\n\fconsequences of nonpayment. The first sentence provides when monthly royalties\n\nare due—providing a different due date than reconciliation payments (60 days vs.\n\nMarch 1st). CR3:996-97 (¶XIV). The second sentence addresses late-payment\n\ninterest for monthly royalties that are not paid—not reconciliation payments for\n\nunderpaid royalties. The third sentence addresses termination when “such\n\nroyalties” are not paid within 60 days. Id. And the final sentence authorizes a\n\nparticular venue for suit to recover “such royalties [that] are not paid.” Id.\n\n      Each sentence in paragraph XIV addresses only monthly royalty\n\nnonpayment—the failure to meet the 60-day deadline. But here, monthly royalty\n\nnonpayment is not at issue. Justapor admitted that Escondido always paid monthly\n\nroyalties within 60 days. CR3:1041:17-1042:3. Rather, because Justapor seeks to\n\nrecover for alleged underpayment of royalties, paragraph III(g) applies. It\n\naddresses royalty adjustments and reconciliation of underpayment.\n\n      c. The      provisions have       different, inconsistent      procedures   for\n\nunderpayment and nonpayment. These two provisions provide separate paths for\n\n(1) underpayment and adjustments, versus (2) nonpayment.\n\n      If Escondido underpays by using the incorrect price or volume, the\n\nconsequence is not termination but instead the covenant that Escondido will make\n\na reconciliation payment by March 1 of the following year. CR3:987-88 (¶III(g)).\n\nParagraph III(g) does not specify a remedy, termination or otherwise, for a breach\n\n\n                                          41\n\fof that covenant, leaving available an ordinary action for breach of contract and\n\ndamages. See Rogers v. Ricane Enters., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1568694\"><a href=\"/opinion/1568694/rogers-v-ricane-enterprises-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">772</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 79 (Tex. 1989).\n\n      Unlike paragraph III(g), paragraph XIV does not provide a grace period until\n\nthe following March 1. Instead, it provides that the failure to meet the 60-day\n\ndeadline for monthly payment of royalties allows a series of immediate remedies:\n\n(1) termination “on the date that such royalties were due and not paid,” (2)\n\nimmediate accrual of 10% interest, and (3) the immediate right to sue “without\n\nother notice than this paragraph.” CR3:996-97 (¶XIV).\n\n      It would be inconsistent with the lease’s plain language to treat a breach of\n\nparagraph III(g) as a trigger for termination under paragraph XIV. Paragraph III(g)\n\nprovides a grace period to make up underpayment and provides no express\n\nremedies for a failure to make up underpayment above and beyond contract law. In\n\ncontrast, Paragraph XIV provides immediate and severe consequences, which\n\nmakes sense for nonpayment but not for a royalty payment that often later requires\n\nadjustment. The two provisions in completely different parts of this contract do not\n\naddress the same subject.\n\n      d.    Unlike the long process for adjusting underpayment, the remedy\n\nof “ipso facto” termination is immediate and based on an instance that shows\n\nan obvious breach. Under paragraph XIV “ipso facto” termination occurs\n\nimmediately. CR3:996-97 (¶XIV). Unless the event triggering termination would\n\n\n                                        42\n\fbe immediate and obvious, parties would have no marker to know that their legal\n\nrelationship has automatically changed.\n\n      Nonpayment of royalties within 60 days is exactly the sort of event that\n\nwould be instantaneously obvious to the parties so that they know termination has\n\noccurred.\n\n      In contrast, an underpayment or failure to reconcile an underpayment is not\n\nan immediately apparent breach and therefore cannot result in an instant lease\n\ntermination. If paragraph XIV applied to underpayment or the failure to make a\n\nreconciliation payment by March 1, the lease could easily terminate without either\n\nparty knowing. But oil-and-gas producers frequently receive information from\n\npurchasers many months later that affect the volume or price on which the payment\n\nwas made. CR3:1149 (¶6). Under Justapor’s interpretation, if such information\n\nwere received about a December royalty payment in the following April, for\n\ninstance, the lease would have terminated on March 2 without either party’s\n\nknowledge. That interpretation is not what the contract says and is not reasonable.\n\n      An ipso facto termination provision provides a bright line that allows both\n\nparties to know the lease has immediately terminated and to adjust their conduct\n\naccordingly. Here, Justapor first claimed termination 20 months after the initial\n\nunderpayment and 18 months after the March 1 deadline for reconciliation\n\npayments. CR1:22; CR3:1044:20-1045:9. Such a strained interpretation would\n\n\n                                          43\n\fpermit no-fault terminations that a producer who has invested more than $33\n\nmillion in the lease has no ability to correct. It makes no sense to apply the ipso\n\nfacto termination language to underpayment or the failure to timely reconcile\n\nunderpayment.\n\n            2.     Paragraph XIV terminates for nonpayment of royalties, not\n                   underpayment.\n\n      Justapor initially asserted that the lease terminated ipso facto under\n\nparagraph XIV when Escondido first made an underpayment. CR3:1304, 1307. But\n\nJustapor later adjusted its interpretation, conceding that the lease does not\n\nterminate   immediately    upon    any    underpayment.    CR3:1027:18-1028:12;\n\nCR3:1073:3-1074:13. Instead, Justapor now says that Escondido’s failure to\n\nreconcile underpaid royalties by March 1 of the following year results in\n\ntermination. CR1:248-49; CR3:1027:18-1028:12; CR3:1073:3-1074:13.\n\n      The plain language of paragraph XIV has nothing to do with underpayment\n\nat all—whether an underpayment by itself or a failure to reconcile an\n\nunderpayment. Instead, Paragraph XIV provides for termination when “such\n\nroyalties”—the monthly royalties due in 60 days discussed throughout the\n\nparagraph—“are not paid and become delinquent.” CR3:996-97 (¶XIV) (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n      Nothing in this paragraph refers back to the underpayment of royalties,\n\nwhich is addressed separately in paragraph III(g). Under the express terms of\n\n\n                                         44\n\fIII(g), underpayment must be rectified by the March 1 deadline rather than a 60-\n\nday deadline. CR3:988 (¶III(g)). The lease does not even use the same language in\n\nparagraph XIV (“delinquent payments”) that it uses to describe underpayment in\n\nparagraph III(g) (“royalties paid ... less than those required to be paid”). Compare\n\nCR3:988 (¶III(g)) with CR3:996-97 (¶XIV). Instead, the only thing that triggers\n\ntermination is nonpayment—which occurs immediately when the monthly\n\nroyalties due in 60 days “are not paid and become delinquent.” CR3:996-97\n\n(¶XIV).\n\n      If the lease were to terminate upon the date of any underpayment, the March\n\n1 reconciliation deadline would be meaningless. A violation of paragraph XIV\n\nresults in immediate termination, immediate accrual of interest, and immediate\n\nauthorization to sue. CR3:996-97 (¶XIV). If those consequences also apply at the\n\nmoment Escondido makes any underpayment, then it would be meaningless to\n\nprovide a reconciliation procedure and a March 1 deadline for reconciliation\n\npayments. A court should “give effect to all contract provisions, and render none\n\nmeaningless.” King v. Dall. Fire Ins.

Paragraph XIV does not provide for termination based on royalties\n\n“not paid in whole or in part.” It does not provide for termination based on\n\nroyalties “paid less than those required to be paid.” And it does not provide for\n\n\n                                        45\n\ftermination based on nonpayment “of any amounts due to the Lessor hereunder.”\n\nCf. Outdoor Sys., 105 S.W.3d at 69. The parties did not use the sort of language\n\nnecessary to specify clearly and plainly that the lease terminates in the event of an\n\nunderpayment.\n\n             3.    Paragraph XIV does not address remedies for failure to\n                   reconcile underpayment.\n\n      Justapor’s new interpretation, advanced in its summary-judgment motion,\n\nwas that paragraph XIV is triggered by Escondido’s failure to make March 1\n\nreconciliation payments. That interpretation is unreasonable for a number of\n\nreasons.\n\n      First, it has no support in the plain language. No part of paragraph XIV\n\nrefers to reconciliation payments of underpaid royalties or their March 1 deadline.\n\nInstead, the sentence about ipso facto termination uses the phrase “such royalties”\n\nto refer to the monthly royalties due within 60 days under the prior sentences of the\n\nparagraph. CR3:996-97 (¶XIV).\n\n      Second, Justapor’s interpretation also requires adding or implying language\n\nto the lease. Courts “may neither rewrite the parties’ contract nor add to its\n\nlanguage.” Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schaefer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894487\"><a href=\"/opinion/894487/american-mfrs-mut-ins-co-v-schaefer/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 162 (Tex. 2003).\n\nSpecifically, when construing a lease, a court should not imply “terms in\n\nopposition to the express language that the parties themselves have written into the\n\ncontracts.” Rogers, 772 S.W.2d at 79 (quoting Dallas Power & Light Co. v.\n\n\n                                         46\n\fCleghorn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2449285\"><a href=\"/opinion/2449285/dallas-power-light-co-v-cleghorn/\"><span class=\"volume\">623</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 311 (Tex. 1981)).

Waggoner Estate, 118\n\nTex. at 522, 19 S.W.2d at 31.\n\n      Yet Justapor’s interpretation would require that words be added. It would\n\nrequire changing:\n\n      In the event that such royalties are not paid and become delinquent, ...\n      this lease shall terminate ipso facto on the date that such royalties\n      were due and not paid.\n\nto add or imply the following highlighted language to the lease:\n\n      In the event that such royalties are not paid and become delinquent, or\n      in the event that underpayment of royalties are not reconciled by\n      March 1 of the following year under paragraph III(g) of this lease, ...\n      this lease shall terminate ipso facto on the date that such royalties\n      were due and not paid.\n\nThe parties could have written the highlighted language. But it does not appear in\n\nthis lease. Nor should the Court add it or imply it, especially when lease\n\ntermination under Texas law requires clear and unequivocal language.\n\n      Third, Justapor’s interpretation is unreasonable and oppressive.

The parties to oil-and-gas leases frequently disagree about the\n\nprices and volumes used in royalty calculations. CR3:1138 (¶7). New information\n\nmay be received months later that requires an adjustment of the royalty. CR3:1138\n\n(¶6). If the failure to reconcile underpayment by March 1 results in immediate\n\ntermination, the lessee would risk losing its lease based on a disagreement about\n\nthe methodology, pricing, or volumes to be used in royalty calculations, or if it\n\nmade a mistake. CR3:1138 (¶7). Such an interpretation would allow lessors\n\neffectively to blackmail a lessee by disputing every reconciliation. Id. And it would\n\nallow, as in this case, a lessor to conduct audits months or years after the claimed\n\ntermination event, looking for any type of uncorrected underpayment in order to\n\nhijack a valuable mineral lease and improvements to property and recover over a\n\nyear of past proceeds. Id.\n\n      Paragraph XIV does not clearly and unequivocally provide for termination\n\nbased on a failure to make reconciliation payments by March 1. By its plain\n\nlanguage, paragraph XIV does not provide for termination of the lease based on\n\nunderpayment at all. Instead, paragraph XIV provides for termination only for a\n\nnonpayment of monthly royalties within 60 days after the production month.\n\nAccordingly, this Court should reverse the summary judgment in its entirety and\n\nrender partial summary judgment that the lease did not terminate.\n\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\f             4.    In any event, Paragraph XIV cannot support termination so\n                   long as Escondido’s interpretation is reasonable.\n\n      Even if Justapor’s competing interpretation were somehow defensible, the\n\nfact that Escondido’s interpretation is reasonable would, at a minimum, mean that\n\nJimmy Jones drafted a lease agreement that is fundamentally ambiguous. Because\n\nan ambiguous termination or forfeiture provision cannot support that draconian\n\nremedy, the trial court erred in concluding that Escondido’s lease expired. See\n\nKnight, 188 S.W.2d at 566. “If the provision is ambiguous, that alone condemns it\n\nas a forfeiture provision.” Decker, 110 Tex. at 94, 216 S.W. at 386. Upon\n\nconcluding two reasonable interpretations exist, the result is not a fact issue on the\n\nprovision’s proper meaning, but instead a ruling as a matter of law against\n\ntermination. See Knight, 188 S.W.2d at 566; Decker, 110 Tex. at 94, 216 S.W. at\n\n386. This court should therefore render judgment that the lease did not terminate.\n\n      C.     Independently, termination is improper because Justapor did not\n             establish Escondido was required to reconcile any underpayment.\n\n      An independent reason to reverse the trial court’s holding of termination is\n\nthat Justapor failed to establish conclusively that Escondido breached the contract\n\nby failing to reconcile alleged underpayments. Although the Court could decide the\n\nissue of termination without deciding whether Escondido breached the contract, it\n\nis necessary for the Court to address this part I.C in order to rule on the summary\n\njudgment determination of breach of contract as a matter of law, the award of\n\n\n\n                                         49\n\f$3,619 in contract damages, and the severed claim for attorney’s fees and other\n\nfees. See CR3:1861, 1897-98.\n\n      Justapor’s claim of breach is based on two different periods and amounts of\n\nalleged underpayment: (1) $77,107 for production months February 2012 through\n\nJanuary 2013; and (2) $3,851 for production months October 2011 through January\n\n2012. Because the theory and defenses for these two periods are different, we\n\naddress them separately.\n\n             1.    Justapor did not establish any underpayment for\n                   production months February 2012 – January 2013 based on\n                   unambiguous lease terms.\n\n      There are two respects in which Justapor’s argument for termination is not\n\nunambiguously supported by the royalty-price provisions: (1) the effect of the\n\nspecial royalty pricing provision in the first lease amendment, and (2) the effect of\n\nthe royalty pricing prong on which Justapor relies. Summary judgment on the issue\n\nof breach was improper because the lease unambiguously supports Escondido’s\n\nreading of the amendment. Alternately, the lease is ambiguous, precluding\n\nsummary judgment. Reilly v. Rangers Mgmt., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2430984\"><a href=\"/opinion/2430984/reilly-v-rangers-management-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">727</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 529 (Tex.\n\n1987). Further, if there is any ambiguity, uncertainty, or doubt in the lease\n\nlanguage triggering termination, forfeiture is prohibited as a matter of law. Knight,\n\n188 S.W.2d at 566. Thus, Justapor’s motion should have been denied and partial\n\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\fsummary judgment of no termination should have been granted in Escondido’s\n\nfavor.\n\n                     a.     The special pricing provision replaced all pricing\n                            measures, or alternatively was ambiguous.\n\n         The parties’ dispute over the royalty price concerns the effect of the lease\n\namendment on the pricing provision in paragraph III(b), which provided that the\n\n25% royalty “shall be calculated and paid to [Justapor] based upon the highest of”\n\nfour different gas prices: (i) “CURRENT MARKET VALUE,” (ii) the\n\n“CURRENT          HOUSTON       SHIP     CHANNEL        PRICE,”     (iii)   “CURRENT\n\nPROCEEDS REALIZED BY LESSEE” [Escondido], and (iv) “the highest sales\n\nprice of any gas were gas produced from the property could be present when sold\n\nto a third party.” CR3:982 (¶III(b)). The first three of these prices were defined in\n\ndetail; the last was not defined at all. CR3:982-83 (¶III(b)(i)–(iii)).\n\n         In the lease amendment, the special pricing provision stated:\n\n         Provided however, Lessee shall have the right to enter into gas sales’\n         contracts that will determine the price upon which gas royalty is\n         calculated if such contracts provide no less than a price\n         redetermination every six months and provide the following minimum\n         terms....\n\nCR3:1015 (minimum terms omitted); CR3:1326 (¶5). The amendment, as drafted,\n\nplaced this provision in a paragraph labeled as an amendment to Paragraph III “(b)\n\nii.” It appeared at the end of a long paragraph in which the first parts of the\n\nparagraph define “HOUSTON SHIP CHANNEL PRICE.” CR3:1015.\n\n\n                                           51\n\f      The parties offer two competing interpretations:\n\n      1 – Escondido’s interpretation: The special pricing provision, on its face,\n\n      modifies “the price upon which gas royalty is calculated.” It replaces all four\n\n      alternate price measures as the single price on which gas royalty is\n\n      calculated.\n\n      2 – Justapor’s interpretation: The special pricing provision only modifies\n\n      the Houston Ship Channel Price—which means that any of the other three\n\n      alternate prices govern if it is higher. See CR3:1669.\n\nThere are several reasons why Escondido’s interpretation is the only reasonable\n\none, or alternatively, the amendment is at least ambiguous.\n\n      First, the special pricing provision does not modify only the Houston Ship\n\nChannel Price as Justapor claims. CR3:1015. The sentence does not mention the\n\nHouston Ship Channel Price. Instead, the sentence states in global terms that its\n\nmeasure “will determine the price upon which gas royalty is calculated.” Id.\n\nJustapor’s reading of this sentence contradicts its plain language. Justapor attempts\n\nto transform “price upon which gas royalty is calculated” into the Houston Ship\n\nChannel Price. But the gas royalty is not calculated on the Houston Ship Channel\n\nPrice under the original lease when the Houston Ship Channel Price is not the\n\nhighest of the four measures. The plain language of the special price provision\n\nmodifies the whole royalty price, not just the Houston Ship Channel Price.\n\n\n                                         52\n\f      Second, Justapor’s best argument is based, not on the language of this\n\nsentence, but on its label and location—at the end of a long paragraph that begins\n\nwith the title “(b) ii” and that, apart from this sentence, consists of a definition of\n\nthe Houston Ship Channel Price. But the location and label of the paragraph do not\n\ndetermine its meaning when the plain language requires a different construction.\n\nAlthough “in certain cases courts may consider the title of a contract provision or\n\nsection to interpret a contract, ‘the greater weight is given to the operative\n\ncontractual clauses of the agreement.’” Enter.

If the special pricing provision were to\n\nmodify only the Ship Channel price, then it would be redundant with part (iii) of\n\nthe 4-prong royalty in the original lease, which also is based on a “current\n\nproceeds” measure. Under Justapor’s reading, the amendment would make parts\n\n(ii) and (iii) redundant, therefore rendering one of them meaningless surplusage. A\n\ncourt should avoid an interpretation that renders a term meaningless. Italian\n\nCowboy, 341 S.W.3d at 333. Instead, the special pricing provision is a measure of\n\nroyalty price based on the current proceeds that Escondido receives from contracts\n\nthat meet minimum pricing requirements. That has nothing to do with the Ship\n\n\n                                          53\n\fChannel Price, but is a replacement for all of the royalty measures and therefore\n\n“will determine the price upon which gas royalty is calculated.” CR3:1015.\n\n      Fourth, the surrounding circumstances, including the parties’ prior\n\nnegotiations, demonstrate that Justapor’s interpretation is unreasonable. See\n\nHouston Exploration Co. v. Wellington Underwriting Ags., Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895349\"><a href=\"/opinion/895349/houston-explor-v-wellington-underwriting/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n469 (Tex. 2011) (noting that courts may consider “surrounding circumstances that\n\ninform, rather than vary from or contradict, the contract text”). Wrather told Jones\n\nthat Escondido did not want to use the royalty calculation in the original lease, but\n\ninstead wanted to base pricing on Escondido’s agreement with Enterprise.\n\nCR3:1325 (¶4); CR3:1274. And Jones agreed to such a non-assignable\n\namendment. CR3:1325-26 (¶4). These negotiations, consistent with Escondido’s\n\ninterpretation, render Justapor’s interpretation unreasonable.\n\n                   b.     The royalty price measure on which Justapor relies is\n                          ambiguous or meaningless.\n\n      Justapor’s motion for summary judgment argued that Escondido underpaid\n\nroyalties by around $77,100 for one year of production starting in February 2012\n\nbecause it did not use the fourth pricing measure in the original lease:\n\n      (iv) the highest sales price of any gas were gas produced from the\n      property could be present when sold to a third party.\n\nCR3:982 (¶III(b)); see also CR1:233-235 (motion for summary judgment);\n\nCR1:330-332 (expert calculations of underpayment). Justapor argued that this\n\n\n\n                                         54\n\fmeasure resulted in the highest gas price and should have been applied after\n\nFebruary 2012. CR1:233-35; CR1:330-332.\n\n      This provision is ambiguous at best, and meaningless at worst. Even if it is\n\nassumed that “were” is a typo and should mean “where,” this provision still makes\n\nno sense. For instance, would “where gas is sold” refer to the highest sales from a\n\nparticular well, from anywhere on the property, or to market price in the area?\n\nDoes “when sold” refer to the highest sales price at the exact time of the sale, the\n\nday of the sale, the month of the sale? And does “when sold to a third party” refer\n\nto the highest sales price for that particular purchaser or to any purchaser?\n\n      There was ample summary-judgment testimony that this language is\n\nmeaningless in the industry. According to Energy Law Professor Lowe, “[a]\n\ntypical lessee in the oil-and-gas industry would not know how to apply this\n\nprovision to the calculation of royalty payments” and it “could be interpreted in\n\nalternative ways....” CR3:1137 (¶2). It is not a “customary or usual royalty\n\nprovision” and is “unclear and ambiguous.” Id. According to CPA Abington, this\n\nprovision is “unclear” and is not defined. CR3:1150 (¶10). This provision was\n\ninherently ambiguous.\n\n             2.     Fact issues exist regarding production months November\n                    2011 – January 2012.\n\n      The issue for the alleged $3,851 underpayment for production months\n\nNovember 2011 through January 2012 is different. There is no dispute that\n\n\n                                          55\n\fEscondido paid Justapor royalties that were $3,851 less than the Enterprise special\n\npricing provision set out in the amendment. CR1:340:13-23; CR3:1148 (¶4). But it\n\ndid not make up that amount because (1) Justapor caused it to receive a lower price\n\nduring this period by terminating the Enterprise ground lease and insisting that\n\nEscondido continue to sell at the daily spot price, and (2) Jones verbally agreed to\n\nthe royalty he was going to get based on the lower daily spot price. CR1:340:20-\n\n341:20; CR3:1089:13-20; see also supra p. 24-25. Further, Jones did not complain\n\nabout this alleged nonpayment for over 18 months as he continued to accept\n\nroyalties from Escondido. CR3:1044:20-1045:9. During this time Escondido\n\ncontinued to invest an additional $10 million into its $33 million investment,\n\nincluding drilling costs and other improvements CR3:1220-21.\n\n      This evidence at least created a fact issue on Escondido’s defenses of waiver\n\nand estoppel. CR2:928. Jones’ verbal agreement to the reduced royalty, plus his\n\ncontinued acceptance of royalties for 18 months without complaint, raises a fact\n\nissue on waiver. See G.H. Bass & Co. v. Dalsan Properties-Abilene, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2386125\"><a href=\"/opinion/2386125/bass-co-v-dalsan-properties-abilene/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 578 (Tex.

It would be inequitable to enforce a termination in light of\n                     Justapor’s conduct.\n\n       Justapor’s claim of forfeiture disregards its apparent scheme to lay a trap.\n\nJones, while representing Escondido in other matters, drafted a lease that, under his\n\ninterpretation, enhanced the likelihood both of Escondido’s forfeiture and\n\nJustapor’s windfall. The evidence supports an inference that Justapor told\n\nEscondido that the “tough” aspects of the lease would not apply to it and that any\n\nproblems would be resolved by negotiation. Then, after reaping the benefit of\n\nEscondido’s $33 million in improvements, Justapor made every effort to find a\n\ntechnical reason to terminate the lease and caused Escondido to lose its highest-\n\npaying gas purchaser. This evidence of Justapor’s unclean hands should have\n\nprecluded summary judgment for Justapor. See Truly v. Austin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1529685\"><a href=\"/opinion/1529685/truly-v-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">744</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">934</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n938 (Tex. 1988) (preventing a party who caused the failure of a project to impose\n\nliability on others for its failure).\n\n       The negotiation and drafting of the lease. Before entering this lease, Jones\n\ngained Escondido’s trust by making reassurances about any future problems with\n\nthis lease and even becoming Escondido’s fiduciary in negotiating other leases.\n\n       Jones drafted the Justapor lease and the amendment. CR3:1325-26. He was\n\nalso acting as Escondido’s attorney. Although Jones did not represent Escondido in\n\n\n                                         58\n\fnegotiating this lease, he was Escondido’s attorney in other matters during some of\n\nthe negotiations and at the time this lease was signed.

The situation is similar to a lawyer who\n\nalready represents a client when he negotiates an attorney-client agreement with\n\nthat client.

CR3:1325 (¶2).\n\n      Jones assured Escondido that it would not be subject to the original lease’s\n\npricing terms and that any disagreements would be negotiated. He told Escondido\n\nJustapor would agree to payment of royalty based on the Enterprise pricing terms,\n\nbut only so long as the lease was held by Escondido. CR1325 (¶4). And he agreed\n\nto draft the “special royalty pricing provision, based upon the Enterprise price.”\n\nCR1325-26(¶4). He told Escondido that he had drafted a “tough agreement” in\n\ncase Escondido ever assigned its rights under the Lease Agreement to another\n\nparty, but that he would work out with Escondido any issues that might arise.\n\nCR3:1329 (¶17). He never told Escondido that he interpreted the termination\n\nprovision to mean that the lease could terminate based on an underpayment of\n\n\n\n\n                                        59\n\froyalties, a circumstance the lease covered under a separate provision. CR3:1329\n\n(¶17).\n\n         Despite these representations and Jones’ fiduciary relationship with\n\nEscondido, he now seeks to do the opposite—argue that the royalties were not\n\ngoverned by the Enterprise price agreement and assert that the lease terminated\n\nipso facto, without notice, and without any attempt to work out any issues that\n\nmight arise.\n\n         Justapor’s creation of the circumstances resulting in underpayment.\n\nJones, acting on behalf of Justapor, created the situation that gave rise to the first\n\nunderpayment. No gas royalty payments were disputed until Jones terminated the\n\nEnterprise Surface Site Agreement unilaterally. Justapor improperly terminated\n\nthat agreement because Enterprise was late on one $4,500 lease payment.\n\nCR3:1326 (¶8); CR 3:1092:5-11; CR3:1282. Justapor refused to give Enterprise\n\nthe notice of default and opportunity to cure required by the lease, and it even\n\nrefused to accept Enterprise’s subsequent rental check. CR3:1054:17-1059:13. It\n\ntold Enterprise that Enterprise could not use the meter and that Justapor was going\n\nto take their equipment. CR3:1092:7-19. And Justapor insisted Escondido sell gas\n\nat a lower daily spot price to Kinder Morgan rather than shutting in the wells until\n\nEscondido could negotiate a better price. CR3:1326-27 (¶8). This prevented\n\n\n\n\n                                         60\n\fEnterprise from purchasing gas produced on the Justapor Ranch and forced\n\nEscondido to sell gas for a lower price. CR3:1326-27 (¶8); CR1:341:5-13.\n\n      Justapor’s agreement to the underpayment. There was evidence that\n\nJones verbally agreed to the royalty price based on the lower daily spot price.\n\nCR1:340:20-341:20; CR3:1089:13-20. Although this verbal modification of the\n\nlease may not be enforceable, it is evidence that Justapor led Escondido to believe\n\nthe lower royalty payment was not a problem. This is especially true in light of\n\nJones earlier promise to Wrather that, notwithstanding the lease’s “tough” terms\n\ndesigned for assignees, Justapor would work out any problems that arose with\n\nEscondido. It would be inequitable to terminate the lease based on an\n\nunderpayment to which Justapor consented.\n\n      The evidence supports an inference that Justapor terminated the Enterprise\n\nSurface Site Agreement to cause Escondido to lose that purchaser, provoking an\n\nact of default resulting in forfeiture. Equity should not reward that scheme.\n\n             2.    Forfeiture is inequitable because               it    would   be\n                   disproportionate with the alleged breach.\n\n      The trial court terminated Escondido’s lease in which it had invested more\n\nthan $33 million, and awarded well more than $12 million in damages, as legal\n\nremedies to Escondido’s royalty underpayment of somewhere between $3,800 and\n\n$81,000, or somewhere between .00067 and .014 of the $5.7 million in royalties\n\npreviously paid to Justapor.\n\n\n                                         61\n\f      Even if the lease clearly and unambiguously provided for termination, the\n\ninequity of such disproportionate result does not justify a forfeiture. See T-Anchor\n\nCorp., 529 S.W.2d at 627.\n\n             3.    Forfeiture would be inequitable because Jones did not raise\n                   it for 18 months after the alleged termination.\n\n      Justapor first notified Escondido that it believed there had been any\n\nunderpayment of gas royalties when it sued Escondido in August 2013. CR1:22;\n\nCR3:1044:20-1045:9. This was 20 months after the underpayment of October 2011\n\nroyalties and 17 months after the March 2, 2012 date Justapor alleges, and the trial\n\ncourt held, that the lease terminated. CR3:1859. During this time Escondido\n\ncontinued to invest an additional $10 million into its $33 million investment,\n\nincluding drilling costs and other improvements CR3:1220-21. Yet under the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment, Escondido loses all of its investment, must return all revenues\n\nfrom that 18-month period, and cannot deduct its expenses during that period. See\n\nCR3:1859-61. That result is neither fair nor equitable.\n\n      E.     Remedy: the summary judgment should be reversed in its entirety\n             and partial summary judgment rendered that there was no\n             termination.\n\n      Both Justapor’s grounds for summary judgment and all affirmative relief\n\ngranted to it in the judgment were premised on the termination of the lease. See\n\nCR1:260-61; CR3:1858-1861. Accordingly, the summary judgment granting\n\nJustapor’s affirmative claims should be reversed in its entirety.\n\n\n                                         62\n\f      Additionally, because the lease did not terminate as a matter of law,\n\njudgment should be rendered in Escondido’s favor denying the following causes of\n\naction asserted by Justapor, all of which are premised on lease termination:\n\ntrespass (including claims of bad-faith trespass and punitive damages), trespass to\n\ntry title, and its request for an accounting and declaratory relief. CR1:153-155;\n\nCR2:812. Justapor’s claim of breach of contract should be remanded for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this Court’s judgment.\n\nII.   Regardless of whether the lease terminated, Justapor did not\n      conclusively establish Escondido was a bad-faith trespasser.\n\n      In its final judgment and summary-judgment orders, the trial court found\n\n“that from March 2, 2012 through the date hereof [Escondido] has remained, and\n\nremains, in unlawful possession of minerals covered by the Justapor Lease as a\n\nbad-faith trespasser, and is not, and never has been, a good faith trespasser.…”\n\nCR3:1760, 1797, 1859. Based on this ruling, the trial court declared that Justapor is\n\nentitled to damages in the amount of all proceeds from the sale of oil and gas\n\nproduced from the Justapor Lease from March 2, 2012 until the date of final, non-\n\nappealable judgment in this matter, less royalties already paid by Escondido, but\n\nwithout any deduction for production costs or other expenses incurred by\n\nEscondido with regard to the Lease. CR3:1860; see also CR1:254.\n\n      Justapor’s claim that Escondido is a trespasser rests on the finding that the\n\nLease terminated. CR1:250-54. As shown in part I above, the trial court erred in\n\n\n                                         63\n\fthat ruling. Accordingly, as a matter of law, Escondido remained the lessee and\n\nwas not a trespasser at all, much less a trespasser in bad faith. If the Court reverses\n\nthe trial court’s ruling that the lease terminated, it should reverse the summary\n\njudgment on the bad-faith trespass claim without the need to examine this separate\n\nissue.\n\n         But even if the lease had terminated as a matter of law, Justapor did not\n\nconclusively establish bad-faith trespass, and the trial court’s summary judgment\n\nshould be reversed.\n\n         A.    Escondido was not a bad-faith trespasser per se because it lawfully\n               entered into possession of the land.\n\n         The question of whether Escondido was a bad-faith trespasser turns on\n\nwhether, as a matter of law, Escondido transformed from a lessee in lawful\n\npossession of land under a lease into a bad-faith trespasser at the moment Justapor\n\ncontends the Lease terminated (i.e., on March 2, 2012). In general, the question of\n\na defendant’s good faith in entering upon land and developing oil-and-gas\n\nproduction is one of fact. Gulf Prod. Co. v.

Thus, Texas law distinguishes between: (1) a person who\n\nenters into peaceable possession of land under a valid lease before any adverse\n\nclaim is filed; and (2) a person whose first entry on the land does not occur until\n\nafter a lawsuit has been filed to enforce an adverse claim.

When a lessee acquires peaceable\n\npossession of the land prior to a lawsuit on an adverse claim, allowing continued\n\nproduction pending resolution of a later claim furthers the recovery of minerals and\n\nlowers the risk of waste. Subjecting oil and gas lessees to the risk that, upon the\n\nfiling of an adverse claim (no matter how arguable or spurious), the lessee must\n\ncease operations until the claim is resolved would discourage lessees from agreeing\n\nto develop oil and gas production. Moreover, punishing a lessee who has obtained\n\npossession in an orderly manner without creating a breach of the peace, and who is\n\noperating under a lease that has not yet been declared invalid or void, would give\n\nthe landowner an unjust windfall. See Barnes, 200 P. at 986.\n\n      A lessee who enters into possession of land under a lease before the filing of\n\na lawsuit, i.e., without any knowledge of a pending action to enforce an adverse\n\nclaim, does not fall under the conclusive presumption standard and cannot be a\n\nbad-faith trespasser per se.

But its Final Judgment provided broadly that Justapor is entitled to a\n\nconveyance from Escondido “of mineral interests acquired under the Justapor\n\nRanch,...” and “all other additional interests and improvements acquired in or\n\nunder the Justapor Ranch, such as mineral interests, leasehold interests, or any\n\nother interests acquired by lease, deed or otherwise.” CR3:1858 (emphasis added).\n\nThe trial court also ordered specific performance: that Escondido “shall effectuate\n\nsuch conveyance on or before the date this judgment becomes a final, non-\n\nappealable judgment….” CR3:1858-59.\n\n      Escondido seeks to reverse this broad relief in the judgment, in part, because\n\nof the improper ruling on lease termination. But because the vacancy tract was a\n\nseparate summary-judgment ground, and appears to fall within the broad relief\n\ngranted, this separate issue addresses why Justapor is not entitled to a conveyance\n\nof interests specifically in the vacancy tract.\n\n      A.

When\n\nwords of a general nature are used in connection with the designation of particular\n\n\n                                        74\n\fobjects or classes of persons or things, the meaning of the general words will be\n\nrestricted to the particular designation. Hilco Elec., 111 S.W.3d at 81.\n\n      In order to hold that “additional” means something other than “mineral”\n\ninterests, the Court would have to strike out the term “mineral” from that version\n\nof the letter agreement and add the term “additional.” In contrast, interpreting\n\n“additional” to mean “mineral” interests harmonizes the two versions and prevents\n\na conflict that would render the term “mineral interests” in that version of the letter\n\nagreement meaningless. See Frost Nat’l Bank v. L & F Distribs., Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894678\"><a href=\"/opinion/894678/frost-nat-bank-v-l-f-distributors-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 312 (Tex. 2005) (per curiam).\n\n      Justapor acknowledged mineral interests do not include leasehold interests.\n\nCR3:1679 (¶38). Justapor’s position that “additional” means a different type of\n\ninterest, as opposed to additional interests of the same type acquired at a later date,\n\nwould require the Court to violate fundamental rules of contract interpretation and\n\ncommon sense. The letter agreement unambiguously requires conveyance only of\n\n“mineral interests,” which do not include leasehold interests. Accordingly, the trial\n\ncourt erred in granting summary judgment that the letter agreement requires\n\nconveyance of interests other than mineral interests.\n\n             2.     Unless “mineral interests” and “additional interests” mean\n                    the same thing, the letter agreement is ambiguous.\n\n      If the Court disagrees, however, the face of the summary judgment record at\n\nleast shows the letter agreement is ambiguous. If “mineral interests” and\n\n\n                                          75\n\f“additional interests” are given different meanings, it is unclear whether the parties\n\nintended to require Escondido to convey “mineral interests” or “additional\n\ninterests” and what “additional interests” might include. Compare CR1:447 with\n\nCR3:1310. This ambiguity would create fact questions about the letter agreement’s\n\nmeaning and effect, precluding summary judgment on Justapor’s vacancy tract\n\nclaim. See Reilly, 727 S.W.2d at 529.\n\n             3.    Justapor did not establish that it had chosen an entity to\n                   which any interests should be conveyed.\n\n      The letter agreement provided that Escondido was obligated to convey either\n\n“mineral interests” or “additional interests” “to an entity of [Justapor’s] choice….”\n\nCR1:447; CR3:1310. Justapor provided no summary judgment evidence that it\n\nidentified its chosen entity to Escondido, and neither the summary judgment\n\nmotion nor the judgment identifies the entity to whom Escondido is required to\n\nconvey unidentified “leasehold interests, or any other interests acquired by lease,\n\ndeed, or otherwise ….” CR1:254-55; CR3:1760.\n\n      Unless and until Justapor chose an entity to whom any later interests could\n\nbe conveyed, there is no basis to conclude that Escondido “failed” to convey any\n\nsuch interest or that it must convey any interest now.\n\n\n\n\n                                         76\n\f             4.     Justapor did not identify any leasehold interest that should\n                    have been, but was not, conveyed.\n\n      Justapor also did not identify any leasehold or other interest that Escondido\n\nacquired in the vacancy tract after Justapor’s approval and consent. The most the\n\nsummary judgment record shows is that Escondido has leased some interests from\n\nowners of the vacancy tract, but there is no evidence as to when these interests\n\nwere acquired or whether they were acquired “after [Justapor’s] approval and\n\nconsent.” CR1:355 (Deupree deposition). Affidavit testimony by Justapor’s Jones\n\nthat “Escondido has failed to convey all of its leasehold interest in the Vacancy\n\nTract” is conclusory and constitutes no evidence.

App.—Dallas 2007, no pet.). This testimony does not identify any lease,\n\nestablish it concerns the vacancy tract, or establish it was acquired after Justapor’s\n\napproval and consent.\n\n      Justapor’s claim for declaratory relief sought an advisory ruling regarding a\n\nphantom interest to be conveyed to a never-chosen entity. It is no support for any\n\nportion of the trial court’s judgment.\n\n      B.     Justapor was not entitled to specific performance.\n\n      Neither Justapor’s pleading nor its summary judgment motion requested\n\nspecific performance, but instead only a declaration that Justapor “is entitled to a\n\nconveyance of all of Escondido’s interest in the Vacancy Tract....” CR1:153 (¶¶22-\n\n\n                                         77\n\f24); CR1:255.

This grant\n\nof relief is beyond the summary judgment motion. Compare CR1:255 with\n\nCR3:1858-59.\n\n      Even if Justapor had pleaded or sought summary judgment for specific\n\nperformance, Justapor did not show it was entitled to such relief. Claims for\n\ndeclaratory relief and specific performance are not interchangeable. A\n\ndetermination that an agreement is enforceable—i.e., a declaration of the parties’\n\nrights under an agreement—does not equate to a determination that a party is\n\nentitled to specific performance.

By failing to\n\nprovide any evidence (much less, conclusively establish) that it had chosen an\n\nentity to whom any interests should be conveyed, Justapor was not entitled to\n\nsummary judgment affording specific performance.\n\n      In addition, a party seeking specific performance must establish that the\n\nother party has breached the contract.

If the letter agreement does not\n\nprovide unambiguously that Escondido is required to convey only mineral\n\ninterests, not leasehold interests, specific performance is improper.

Lessee shall also Install, operate and\nmaintain a separate gas meter on this lease at each point of exit of a pipeline\ntransporting gas production off of this lease and shall report such gas production\nvolumes taken from this lease, on a monthly basis, to lessor. All gas volume\nmeasurements at the point of exit (whether one or more) shall be compared to the\naggregate of all the Individual wellhead gas volume measurements, and for the purpose\nof royalty payment calculations, Lessee shall use whichever volume Is greater. lessee\nshall report such gas production volumes taken from this lease, and the discrepancies If\nany on a monthly baSiS, to lessor. Lessee shall be required to perform an accurate gas\nanalysis on all gas production, on a well-by-well baSiS, periodically, but at least monthly\nfrom date of first production of each gas well drilled and completed hereunder, which\nanalYSis shall extend to the BTU content of such gas production and other commercial\nconstituents thereof. A copy of such gas analysis shall be furnished to Lessor as\nobtained by Lessee if requested by Lessor. In the event that any distillate or other liquid\nhydrocarbons are contained In the gas stream of any gas well on this lease, In\ncommercial quantities, then lessee Is required to extract such liquid hydrocarbons on\nthis lease and to store and to sell and market the same separately from the gas\nproduction, paying Lessor's royalties thereon. In the event that the gas production\ncontains distillate, condensate, or other liquid hydrocarbons, or water, such gas\nproduction shall first be separated at the wellhead prior to measurement of such gas\nproductfon as provided above. All liquid hydrocarbons removed from the gas stream\nthrough such separator shall be stored In steel distillate or condensate tanks at each\nwell site and such liquid hydrocarbons shall be purchased by Lessee at the current\npricing provisions specified under subparagraph a) of this Article III, Lessee being\nrequired to pay and account to Lessor for Lessor's royalties on all of such separated and\nstored liquid hydrocarbons on a monthly basis. In the event that the gas .production\nfrom this lease needs to be compressed, the compression thereof shall occur through\nfac1l1tles located on this lease In a manner designed to maximize production.

The term \"shut·ln\" as used\n      herein shall mean the later of the date that a well Is completed or the date that a\n      commercial well ceases actual production. The term \"completed or completion\" as used\n      herein shall mean the date thirty (30) days after the date that the well Is drilled to Its\n      permitted depth as reflected on forms flied with the Texas Railroad Commission.\n      Nothing herein shall relieve Lessee of Its duty to market such gas production pursuant\n      to the Reasonably Prudent Operator Standard, as that standard Is deflned by Texas\n      case law, now or hereafter.\n              In the event that Lessee exerclses Its rights under the foregoing provisions of\n      this subparagraph (h), Lessee shall, conduct appropriate and adequate tests of each\n      shut-In gas well designated by Lessor to determine whether such deSignated gas well Is\n      actually capable of producing gas In paying quantities. Such tests shall be conducted at\n      times selected by Lessee, but not more than thirty (30) days after which Lessee has\n      shut In the well or wells. Lessee shall give Lessor reasonable notice prior to conducting\n      such well tests and Lessor or Lessor's representative shall have the right to be present\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     988\n\f   at all testing and shall be entitled to receive full Information, Including all data and\n   Interpretation, In connectIon wIth such testing. In the event any such test reveals that\n   the well or wells tested (on a well by well basis) are non-commercial as provided In\n   Article XIII hereof, It shall be considered that such well or wells have ceased to produce\n   gas in paying quantities on the date of the test of each such well.\n\n          Lessor shall have the same privileges as above outlined to test any 011 well on\n   said fands and obtain and deliver operating expense and revenue data on each such\n   well and If such test and examination reveals that such oil well or wells are not\n   producing In paying quantities, then such well or wells shall be considered as having\n   ceased to produce 011 In paying quantities on the date of such test, and such well shall'\n   not qualify as a productive well, the acreage allocated thereto shall not be held thereby.\n\n           No shut-In royalty shall be due during the primary term of this lease.\n\n             (I) Subject to the other provIsions contained herein, after the primary terms of\n      this lease, Lessee shall pay to Lessor an Annual Minimum Income which shall never\n      be 'Iess than the amount of SIXlY AND NO/100THS ($60.00) DOLLARS per acre, for the\n      acreage held by this lease.

Subject to the provisions of Article XlV, If at the\n   expiration of the primary term, all 01' gas Is not being produced on said land, but Lessee\n    Is then engaged 10-bona fide drilling or reworking operations thereon, this lease shall\n    remain In force and effect so long as such bona fide operation or operations on said\n   well or any additional well or wells are prosecuted, with no cessation of more than\n    ninety (90) consecutive days, between the completion of a well as a producer or a dry\n    hole ·and the commencement of drilling or reworking operations on a subsequent well,\n  ~and JI~ they result In the production of 011 or gas In paying quantities, so long thereafter\n .. as .01[ or gas In paying quantities Is produced from said land. The term \"drilling\n':opera,tlons\" as referred to In this agreement, shall mean actual drilling operations with a\n   drillil'\\g rig on location on Leased Premises, together with all attendant eqUipment\n    needed to drill a well to the permitted depth, with the drill bIt actually making hole. The\n  term \"~\\rewol'klng operations\", as referred to In this agreement, shall be construed to\n    mean the actual reworking or deepening of a well that on Leased Premises, with the\n    eqUipment necessary on location to condl,lct such reworking of such well and actually In\n    the operation of reworking of such well or wells and the prosecution of such operations\n    without cessation for longer than thirty (30) days. Only a well that has been previously\n    completed as a producer may be reworked. The provisions of this paragraph shall\n    control over the doctrine of temporary .cessatlon of production, which doctrine shall\n    never be construed to be applicable to this lease.\n\n         Lessee agrees that In the event an' off-premises well Is draining the leased\n premises, Lessee will drill, complete and produce such offset well or wells on this leased\n premises as a Reasonably Prudent Operator would under the same or similar\n circumstances Lessee shall commence operations to drill such offset well not later than\n ninety (90) days from the date of the first production of the draining well. Any off lease\n well drilled within or whose well bore, where prodUCing, passes within 1,000 ft of the\n leased property, shall be presumed to be draining the leased premises.\n\n        In lieu of drilling an offset well on the leased premises, Lessee may elect to pay\n a . compensatory royalty equal to 25% of the gross production and quality of gas\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    990\n\f           procluced from the draining well so long as the draining well Is In production. If the\n           BTU content of the gas produced from the draining well Is not known, the highest BTU\n           content from production on any well on this lease shall be used In the calculation of\n           compensatory royalty due Lessor. Lessee 'shall either drill or pay a compensatory\n           royalty within 60 days of first production of any draining well. Lessee Is prohibited from\n           releasing any acreage subject to the offset well obligation, In lieu of drilling or paying\n           compensatory royalty. Lessee must protect the premises from drainage on a well-by-\n           well basis. Lessee shall not defend a claim for damages resulting from drainage by\n           contending that production between the leased premises and the draining land will\n           \"balance out\" In light of future production or development of the lease.\n\n                   If, this lease Is kept In effect by the payment of Shut-In Gas Royalty, and gas Is\n           sold and delivered from an off-premise well located within one thousand (1,0001 feet,\n           of the leased premises, the right to continue to maintain the lease by paying the Shut-In\n           Gas Royalty shall cease. The lease shaH only remain In effect upon the drilling and\n           completing of an offset well or payment of a compensatory royalty as stated.above.\n           TermInation of this lease does not relieve the Lessee of paying a compensatory royalty\n           during the life of the production of the draining well or wells.

In no event may ~ny well ever perpetuate lease\nacreage In excess of forty (40) acres, unless Lessee proves that more acreage Is\nrequired to protect a well from drainage, and as to all other acreage covered\nhereby, Lessee covenants and agrees, subject to the provisions for Continuous\nDrilling Operations as hereinafter provided, to execute and deliver to Lessor a\nrecordable written release as to any and all of such other acreage not so\nallocated to a producing or shut-In well or wells. The acreage allocation per well\nshall be made within sixty (60) days following completion of the last well\ncompleted on this lease or the cessation of drilling operations under the\ncontinuous development provisions of this lease, whichever time period occurs\nlater. In the event Lessee falls to make such unit allocations following (60) days'\nwritten notice from Lessor, Lessor reserves the right to make such unit\nallocations based upon the acreage area which any such completed well will\nreasonably drain (not to exceed however the above unit sizes), by the filing of\nunit designations of record In the Office of the County Clerk of Webb County,\nTexas, and the acreage covered hereby which Is not allocated to any such well or\nwells shall no longer be held by this lease.\n\nIn the event that this lease has been perpetuated by production of 011 or gas In\npaying quantIties as above provided for on or after expiration of the primary\nterm, hereof, then the release of such unallocated acreage to well unit or units\nmay be postponed only In the event that withIn a perIod of ninety (90) days after\nthe expiration of the primary term hereof or the completion of the last well\ndrilled on this lease following expiration of the primary term (whichever occurs\nlast) Lessee commences drilling operations (with adequate drilling rIg and\nequipment to drill and complete the contemplated well) of an additional well or\nwells on such unallocated acreage and, In such event the entIre lease shall\nremain In force so long as such drilling operations on said additional well or wells\nare prosecuted with reasonable dJJJgence, and If after the completion or\nabandonment of any such well, Lessee commences the drilling of an additional\nwell or wells within ninety (90) days from the completion or abandonment of the\npreceding well, and If Lessee continuously conducts drilling operations In good\nfaith and with reasonable dlligence on said lease, without any cessation for\nlonger than ninety (90) days, this lease shall remain In full force and effect\nduring such drilling operations and until the end of ninety (90) days after the\ncompletion or the abandonment of the final well; at which time, this lease as to\n all rights granted hereunder shall automatically terminate as to all acreage\ncovered hereby, LESS AND EXCEPT all acreage allocated to a producing 011 or gas\n well or wells on a well unit by well unit basiS as hereinabove provided for,\n Lessee shall be obligated to release all acreage and depths not so allocated to a\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                       1017\n\f  producing all or gas well or well as herein provided.

My name is David Wrather. I am employed with Escondido Resources II, LLC\n(\"Escondido\") in the position of Senior Vice President. My position includes responsibility for\nland operations, including involvement in the negotiation of oil and gas leases on behalf of\nEscondido. I participated in the lease negotiations between Escondido and Justapor Ranch\nCompany, L.C. (\"Justapor\") for the lease of oil and gas interests on an 803-acre ranch owned by\nJustapor in Webb County, Texas (the \"Justapor Ranch\"). I negotiated the lease with James &.\nJones (\"Jones\") who I understood to be the owner of Justapor. As a result, I have personal\nknowledge of the facts set fOlih in this affidavit and they are true and conect.\n\n        2.     Jones contacted me in May, 2008, to inquire about Escondido's interest in leasing\nthe oil and gas minerals on the Justapor Ranch. Jones informed me that he was a lawyer in\nWebb County, Texas. Escondido did not have separate counsel representing it in the negotiation\nor execution of the lease between it and Justapor.\n\n        3.    On June 4, 2008, Jones e-mailed me a lease agreement form for the Justapor\nRanch. On June 6, 2008, I e-mailed Jones comments to the lease form and an example of a\nproposed royalty provision which Escondido had rccently used in another lease. A hue and\ncorrect copy of the e-mail chain and fOlm are attached to Escondido's response to Jones' Motion\nfor Summary Judgment (the \"Response\") at Exhibit 1.\n\n        4.      During our negotiations, I told Jones that Escondido wanted to base its royalty\npayment obligations upon the pricing (enns Escondido had negotiated with Enterprise for a gas\nsales agreement (the \"Enterprise Gas Sales Agreement\") as a minimum price that Escondido\nwould pay for purposes of royalty payments. On June 13, 2008, I e-mailed Jones the pricing\nterms we had negotiated with Enterprisc for thc paymcnt of gas. A true and correct copy of this\ne-mail is attached to the Response as Exhibit J. Jones infOlmed me that Justapor would agree to\nthe payment of royalty based upon the Enterprise pricing terms with Escondido, but not with any\nsubsequent assignee of Escondido. Jones informed me that Justapor wanted an amendment to\nthe proposed lease that would incorporate special pricing terms related to Escondido's price\narrangement with Enterprise. Jones provided me with a draft of the proposed amendment. On\n\n                                               1\n\n\n                                                                                                   1325\n                                            Ex. S\n\fJune 13, 2008, I e-mailed Jones connnents to the proposed amendment wherein I referenced in\nc()mlection with the pricing provision, \"as per Enterprise offer\". A hue and correct copy of this e-\nmail and the attached draft are attached to the Response as Exhibit K. Based upon my\ndiscussions and negotiations with Jones, the parties agreed that an amendment was to be drafted\nto provide a special royalty pricing provision, based upon the Enterprise price, that would be\navailable only to Escondido, and not any subsequent assignee.\n\n        5.     Escondido and Justapor entered into the oil and gas lease dated June 24, 2008,\ncovering the lease of minerals on the Justapor Ranch (the \"Lease Agreement\"). On the same\ndate, Escondido and Justapor also entered into an amendment to the Lease Agreement titled\n\"Amendment to Oil and Gas Lease\" (\"Amendment No. I \"). Based upon the negotiations and\nagreement reached with Jones, Escondido understood and believed Amendment No. I, and its\nspecial pricing provision, to be a replacement provision for the pricing provisions contained in\nAlticle III(b) of the Lease Agreement. The patties entered into Amendment No. I so that\nEscondido's royalty obligations under the Lease Agreement would correlate to the pricing terms\nof the Enterprise Gas Sales Agreement. At the time the Lease Agreement and Amendment No. I\nwere executed, Enterprise was the only market readily available to transpOit and purchase gas\nproduced from the Justapor Ranch.\n\n        6.     In order to sell gas produced fi'om the Justapor Ranch to Enterprise, Escondido\nneeded to constlUct a meter site on the Justapor Ranch and build a pipeline from the Justapor\nRanch across other adjacent propetties to a cOlll1ection point on the Enterprise System.\nEscondido acquired the right of way necessary to constlUct the pipeline. As part of this project,\nEscondido and Justapor executed a Surface Site Agreement which included a pipeline right of\nway and meter station surface site on the Justapor Ranch, a copy of which is attached to the\nResponse as Exhibit L. It was discussed with Jones that the Smface Site Agreement and pipeline\nwould be conveyed to Enterprise when the facilities were conshucted. Escondido did constlUct\nthe pipeline and ultimately assigned the Surface Site Agreement ,md pipeline to Enterprise with\nthe consent of Justapor, a copy of which is attached to the Response as Exhibit M.\n\n        7.     By 201 I, capacity constraints on the Enterprise pipeline system caused Entelprise\nto limit the volume of gas which was purchased fi'om Escondido, including gas produced fi'om\nthe Justapor Ranch. During this period of time, Escondido made sales of gas produced from the\nJustapor Ranch to an altemative market, Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, LLC (\"Kinder\nMorgan\"). Gas was delivered to Kinder Morgan via a gathering system installed by a new\nmidstream company that had entered the area, Meritage Midstream Services, LLC. Meritage\nacquired a meter site for their pipeline fi'om Justapor and acquired right of way to take\nEscondido's gas, including Justapor's gas, to Kinder Morgan.\n\n        8.     In October 2011, Enterprise informed Escondido that it had capacity available on\nits system, and intended to re-initiate gas purchases from the Justapor Ranch. The price which\nwould be realized from the sale of gas to Enterprise was greater than the price available from\nKinder Morgan. Escondido made plans and was prepared to sell gas from the Justapor Ranch to\nEnterprise. However, by letter dated October 19, 20ll, Jones communicated to Entelprise that\nthe Surface Site Agreement was terminated. Entelprise informed me that it could not purchase\ngas from the Justapor Ranch as a result of the termination notice sent to it by Jones and Jones\n\n\n                                                 2\n\n\n                                                                                                       1326\n\finformed me that he now owned the Enterprise meter and equipment located on the meter site.\nJones informed me that Escondido could not sell gas from the Justapor Ranch to Enterprise as a\nresult of the termination of the Surface Site Agreement. Because of the termination of the\nEnterprise Surface Site Agreement, the right of way and meter station on the Justapor Ranch\nwere not available to Enterprise to accept gas from the Justapor Ranch. Jones informed me that\nJustapor would negotiate with Entelprise for a new surface site agreement containing additional\nterms.\n\n        9.      During the same period of time, Escondido was attempting to access additional\nmarkets for gas produced from the Justapor Ranch. Escondido negotiated processing contracts\nwith ConocoPhillips Company (dated September 1,2011) and Copano Processing, L.P. (dated\nOctober 25,2011), and expected these additional markets to be available by the end of 2011 or\nearly 2012. Escondido also believed, based upon Jones' statements regarding negotiations with\nEnterprise, that a new surface site agreement would soon be executed again providing Escondido\nwith access to the Enterprise market. Each of these alternative markets was expected to provide\na higher price for the Justapor Ranch gas than that available from Kinder Morgan, due in part to\nprocessing capability. As a result of the timing ofthe termination of the Surface Site Agreement,\nand the expected availability of markets fi'om Copano and ConocoPhillips in the near future,\nEscondido decided to shut-in the wells on the Justapor Ranch until those higher-priced markets\nbecame available. I informed Jones that Escondido wanted to shut-in the wells on the Justapor\nRanch nntil higher-price markets became available. The only shOlt-term market available to\nEscondido at that point in time, due to the termination of the Surface Site Agreement with\nEnterprise, was sales to Kinder Morgan based upon a daily spot price. At that point in time, the\ndaily spot price was lower than the price which would have been paid by Entelprise if the\nSurface Site Agreement had not been tClminated, and lower than the price Escondido expected to\nreceive in the future for sales to Copano and ConocoPhillips. Jones directed me to continue sales\nand not shut-in the wells. I explained to him that Escondido wanted to sell gas to Entelprise and\nbelieved that Jones and Enterprise were working on resolving their issues and that Escondido\nwould rather shut-in the wells rather than sell the gas at the lower gas daily spot price, without\nprocessing. Jones stated that he wanted Escondido to proceed with sales, even though processing\nwas not available.\n\n         10.   Also in 2011, a disagreement arose between Escondido and Justapor over the\ncalculation of a compensatory royalty payment relating to a well drilled on propelty adjacent to\nthe Justapor Ranch. There were also issues outstanding between the patties related to drilling\ncOllllnitments under the Lease Agreement; a working interest owned by another Jones entity,\nJAK Passive Minerals, L.C.; and mineral interests owned by third parties on a portion of acreage\nwithin the Justapor Ranch referred to by the parties as the \"Vacancy Tract\". Each of these issues\nwas addressed in a letter agreement entered into between Escondido and Justapor dated August\n9,2011 (the \"Letter Agreement\").\n\n       II.      Since execution of the Letter Agreement, Escondido has supplied Jones with\nexecuted deeds conveying all mineral interests owned by Escondido at that time, or subsequently\nacquired, for the Vacancy Tract. Escondido is not cUlTently the owner of any mineral interests in\nthe Vacancy Tract or the Justapor Ranch which has not been previously conveyed to Justapor or\nanother entity owned or controlled by Jones as a result of deeds signed and delivered by\n\n\n                                                3\n\n\n                                                                                                     1327\n\fEscondido to Jones. It was never discussed, contemplated, 01' agreed that Escondido would\nconvey any leasehold interest which it currently holds on the Justapor Ranch in connection with\nthe Letter Agreement.\n\n        12.    Also in May, 2008, Escondido was attempting to secure leases of minerals on\nother propelties in the Webb County area. In particular, Escondido was negotiating to obtain a\nmineral lease from William S. Hatte (the \"Harte Lease\") and one other propelty. These other\nleasing negotiations were underway in the same period of time during which Escondido was also\nengaged in negotiations with Jones for a mineral lease on the Justapor Ranch.\n\n        13.     In late May, 2008, Escondido sent leasing proposals for two negotiations it was\nengaged in, one of which was the Harte Lease. In early June, 2008, and prior to the execution of\nthe Justapor Lease, Jones informed me that he could represent Escondido in cOllllection with its\nleasing efforts in Webb County. I informed Jones of Escondido's interest in acquiring the Harte\nLease and, at least, one other. Jones informed me thaI he knew the parties involved with both\nlease negotiations and that he could represent Escondido in negotiating and securing the Harte\nlease. On June 10,2008, I e-mailed Jones with the terms of the lease offer Escondido had made\nin connection with one of the negotiations. A hue and COHect copy of the e-mail transmitting the\nBenavides Lease offer and the offer itself are attached to Escondido's Response to the Lawyer\nJones Motion for Summary Judgment (the \"Lawyer Jones Response\") as Exhibit Y (filed under\nseal). Negotiations on that Lease did not progress beyond the preliminary stage. However,\nEscondido continued negotiations in connection with the Harte Lease.\n\n         14.    Between June 10,2008, and June 16,2008, Jones and I discussed the terms under\nwhich Jones would undertake the representation of Escondido in connection with the Harte\nLease. Jones informed me that he would represent Escondido in connection with its effOlts to\nnegotiate and acquire the Harte Lease in exchange for the payment to Jones of a fee in the form\nof an overriding royalty interest on the Hatte Lease if the negotiations lead to the execution of a\nlease. Jones informed me that in exchange for Escondido's agreement to pay an overriding\nroyalty interest, he would represent Escondido in connection with the Harte Lease. On June 16,\n2008, I spoke with others at Escondido regarding the payment of an overriding royalty interest to\nJones as requested for his legal services. After these discussions, I e-mailed Jones on June 16,\n2008, confirming Escondido's agreement to engage Jones in connection with obtaining and\nnegotiating the Hatte Lease and Escondido's agreement to pay Jones an overriding royalty\ninterest. Exhibit Z to the Lawyer Jones Response is a true and conect copy of an e-mail\nexchange between me and Jones dated June 16,2008 through June 17,2008. The first e-mail in\nthis exchange on June 16, 2008, is the e-mail setting out the tenns of Escondido's engagement of\nJones. On June 17, 2008, Jones e-mailed me a request to send him a copy of Escondido's\nproposal for the Harte Lease as referenced in Exhibit Z, which I did. Jones' e-mail also requested\nthat I call him. I telephoned Jones on the 17th at which time we discussed his representation of\nEscondido in connection with the Harte Lease and the terms of the overriding royalty interest\nwhich Escondido had agreed to pay Jones in connection with that representation. Jones stated he\nwould represent Escondido in connection with the Hade Lease. At no time did Jones infonll me\nthat he had not agreed to undertake any representation of Escondido as of that time. As a result\nof my conversations with Jones, I understood and believed him to be engaged at that time as\nEscondido's counsel in cOlmection with the Harte Lease and other potential leasing effOlts. Jones\n\n\n                                                4\n\n\n                                                                                                      1328\n\fconfIrmed this understanding during out' conversation of June 17, 2008, when the Harte Lease\nproposal was discussed, Jones never advised me during this time period that he had not agreed\nto represent Escondido, There was no subsequent telephone conversation during the months of\nJuly 01' August, 2008, during which Jones told me he had decided to represent Escondido, I am\naware of no other writing between myself or others at Escondido, on the one hand, and Joncs, on\nthe other hand, constituting an engagement agreement for Jones other than the e-mail of June 16,\n2008, marked as Exhibit Z to the Lawyer Jones Response,\n\n        15,    Jones did proceed to represcnt Escondido as its attorncy in cOlUlection with the\nHarte Lease, Exhibit AA to the Lawyer Jones Response is a copy of a July 23, 2008 e-mail I\nsent Jones containing information related to Harte's legal representative, On June 24, 2008, I\nsent Mr, Harte an email (Exhibit FF to the Lawyer Jones Response) informing him that Jones\nwas representing Escondido and to expect a call from him, Exhibit BB to the Lawyer Jones\nResponse is an e-mail sent to me by Jones relaying to me information regarding his\nconversations wlth Harte's attorney and the status of negotiations, Exhibit CC to the Lawyer\nJones Response is an e-mail from Jones to me dated January 7, 2009, setting fOlih his opinions\nregarding the terms of the proposed Harte Lease, Exhibits DD and EE to the Lawyer Jones\nResponse are e-mails from Jones to me dated Jammry 7, 2009, wlth redlined comments to the\nproposed Harte Lease,\n\n        16,     At no time did Jones advise me that Escondido should engage separate counsel in\nconnection with the negotiation and execution of the Lease Agreement. At no time did Jones\nrequest 01' obtain Escondido's written consent to his representation of Escondido at the same time\nhe was negotiating with Escondido the Lease Agreement for the Justapor Ranch,\n\n         17,     While we were negotiating the Lease Agreement for the Justapor Ranch, Jones\ntold me that he had drafted a tough agreement in case Escondido ever assigned its rights under\nthe Lease Agreement to another party, but that he would work out with Escondido any issues\nWllich might arise, Based upon this conversation, and the fact that Jones was acting as\nEscondido's attol'lley, I assumed that any disagreements which might arise between Escondido\nand Justapor would be resolved through a negotiation process, During lease negotiations, Jones\nand I never discussed his interpretation of pricing provision III(b)(iv) of the Lease Agreement.\nWe also did not discuss the termination provision contained in Article XIV, I did request one\nchange to the annual certification requirement contained in Article III(g); however, Jones and I\nnever discussed his understanding or interpretation of Article III(g) insofar as it relates to the\nobligation to make allllualrcconciliation payments, Prior to this lawsuit, Jones never informed\nme that it was his position 01' Justapor's position that the Lease Agreement would terminate if\nthere were ever an underpayment of royalties which was not correctly and fully reconciled and\npaid by March I of the succeeding year, Jones never informed me that it was his position or\nJustapor's position that the Lease Agreement would terminate if there was an underpayment of\nroyalties, Jones never informed me of his 01' Justapor's interpretations of the pricing provisions\nin Article III of the Lease Agreement as asselied in this lawsuit, If, prior to the execution of the\nLease Agreement, Jones had informed me of the interpretation and construction being advanced\nby him and Justapor in this case, I would not have agreed to the Lease Agreement without further\nclarification 01' modification, In particular, Escondido would not have agreed to the pricing\nprovision contained in Article III(b) of the Lease Agreement if it were not modified by\n\n                                                5\n\n                                                                                                   1329\n\fAmendment No. 1 as Escondido understood based on its conversations with Jones. Escondido\nwould not have agreed to a lease which provided a remedy for underpayment of royalty as\nargued by Justapor in this case. Escondido would not have agreed to a lease which provided for\ntermination for a failure to reconcile an alleged royalty underpayment as argued by Justapor in\nthis case. None of these arguments 01' interpretations was explained to me by Jones prior to\nexecution of the Justapor Lease.\n\n\n       FURTHER AFFIANT SAYETH NOT.\n\n\n                                                   David Wrather\n\n\nSUBSCRIBED and SWORN to before me this the        ~;\\I day of Sf PTLMlSy;R         ,2014.\n\n\n\n                       CTRAVIS WAlNE               Notary Public, State of Texas\n                     My Comml&slon Expires\n                       January 25.2016\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\n\n                                                                                                  1330\n\f                                                                                                                  Filed\n                                                                                                  9/5/2014 3:46:44 PM\n                                                                                                     Esther Degollado\n                                                                                                         District Clerk\n                                                                                                         Webb District\n                                                                                                 2013-cv7 -001396-D1\n\n                                    NO.2013-CV7-001396-DI\n\nJUSTAPOR RANCH COMPANY, L.C.,                 §       IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF\n     Plaintiff,                               §\n                                              §\nV.                                            §       WEBB COUNTY, TEXAS\n                                              §\n                                              §\nESCONDIDO RESOURCES II, LLC,                  §\n     Defendant.                               §       49th JUDICIAL DISTRICT\n\n                               AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN S.

Lowe, who after being h me duly sworn, stated under oath:\n\n     1. My name is John S. Lowe. I am the George W. Hutchison ProfeSl;or of Energy Law at\n Southern Methodist University's Dedman School of Law. I have more than 35 years' experience\nteaching courses on issues related to property law, oil and gas law, and oil and gas contracts. I\nam also an attorney and member of the bars of Texas, Oklahoma, and Ohio. I am Past President\nof the Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Foundation, and Past Chair of the Section of\nEnvironmental, Encrgy, and Resources Law of the American Bar Association. I have published\nnumerous atiicles dealing with oil and gas contracts. I have also written, or co-written with\nothers, books on oil and gas leases and contracts. I often present lectures and papers on issues\nrelated to oil and gas leases and contract~. Additional information regarding my experience and\nqualifications is set out in my resume, a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as\nExhibit I and incorporated herein by reference. I am familiar with and have an understanding of\nthe customary terms used in oil and gas lease agreements, and industry custom, practicc, and\nusage in applying those terms. I have specialized knowledge, skill, education, and experience\nregarding oil and gas lease provisions and issues related to the custom, usage, and practice in the\noil and gas industry related to provisiops in oil and gas leases, including but not limited to\nroyalty-calculation provisions, royalty-payment provisions, and audit provisions. I have\nreviewcd the oil and gas lease dated June 24, 2008 (the \"Lease\") that is the subject of this lawsuit\nalong with amendments thereto including the Amendment to Oil and Gas Lease dated June 24,\n2008 (\"Amendment No. I \"). I have also reviewed Plaintiffs First Amended Petition and exhibits\nthereto; deposition testimony of Jimmy K. Jones, David Wrather, William Deupree, Kurt von\nPlonski, and Charlie E. Graham; Plaintiffs Designation of Expert Witnesses; Escondido's\nDesignations of Expert Witnesses; Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment; and, deposition\nexhibits 2A, 2B, 3, 11,42,48,57,59,61,62,64,69, and 74. I have personal knowledge of the\nfacts set forth herein, and am competent to testifY thereto. The facts stated in this affidavit are\ntrue atld correct.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  1\n                                            Ex. F                                                  1136\n\f     2. Article III(b)(iv) of the Lease is not a customary or usual royalty provision. This\nprovision is unclear and ambiguous. A tyPical lessee in the oil and gas industry would not know\nhow to apply this provision to the calculation of royalty payments. Unlike the other royalty\nprovisions contained in the Lease, there is no defined term or definition for the meaning of\nroyalty provision (iv). Justapor, in the deposition of James K. Jones, contends that royalty-\nprovision (iv) contains an error in that the word \"were\" should be \"where.\" Even if the word\n\"were\" was changed to \"where,\" royalty-provision (iv) would remain unclear and ambiguous. As\ndrafted, pricing-provision (iv) could be interpreted in alternative ways by a typical industry\nlessee. The uncertainlY and lack of clarity with regard to the meaning of royalty provision (iv) is\nincreased by Amendment No. 1. In this instance, it appears Amendment No. I was executed\nsimultaneous to the Lease in order to afford the lessee, Escondido Resources II, L.L.C.\n(\"Escondido\"), with a special pricing provision available only to it, and not to subsequent\nassignees. Escondido appears to have operated with the understanding that the provisions of\nparagraph 2 of Amendment No. 1 amending Article III of the Lease provided an alternative\nroyalty methodology that supplanted each of the four royalty provisions contained in Article\nIII(b) of the Lease. It is reasonable and consistent with industry custom and practice for\nEscondido to pay royalties in a manner consistent with this interpretation and wlderstanding of\nthe effect of Amendment No.1 on the Lease royalty-payment provisions.\n\n    3. Industry custom and practice would apply the termination clause contained in Article\nXIV of the Lease only to non-payment of royalty. The termination clause would not apply to\nImderpayment or miscalculation of royalty. The industry differentiates royalty non-payment\nfrom royalty underpayment. It is unusual, but not unheard of, to have lease provisions calling for\ntemlination if a royalty is not paid. But it is unheard of to have a termination provision in the\nevent of an underpayment. The industry does not consider non-payment of royalty to be the same\nas an underpayment of royalty. An unqerpayment is an underpayment, not a non-payment; in\nother words, if there is an underpayment, a subsequent failure to correct the llilderpayment does\nnot change the nature of the underpayment to a non-payment of royalty. Because the termination\nprovision contained in Article XIV does not expressly apply to the underpayment of royalties, it\nalso does not apply to a failure to correct an underpayment of royalty through a review or\nreconciliation process. A11icle XIV does not condition the continuation of the Lease on the\ncorrection of any or all royalty underpayments by March 1 of the succeeding calendar year.\nIndustry custom and practice does not consider royalty underpayments to be the same as a failure\nto pay royalty. Likewise, industry custom and practice would not consider a failure to reconcile\na royalty underpayment by March I of the succeeding year to be a non-payment of royalty. It is\nnot usual or customary to have a lease-termination clause for underpayment of royalties or for\nthe failure to correct or reconcile an underpayment.\n\n    4. Article XIV of the Lease states it does not apply in the event of a title dispute or title\ndefect. That \"carve out\" is included because it is industry custom and practice to hold payment\nof royalties \"in suspense\" when there is a title dispute or title defect. The carve out for a title\ndispute or title defect protects the lessee from termination for non-payment of royalty if there is a\nsuspension due to a title issue. The inclusion of the carve-out language for title disputes and\ndefects further evidences that the intent of the parties was that the termination provision\ncontained in Article XIV would apply to instances of non-payment, rather than instances of\nunderpayment. This is consistent with industry custom and practice.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n                                                                                                    1137\n\f    5. Article III(g) of the Lease calls for the lessee to review prices and production volumes\nused in its calculation of royalty payments against the price and production volumes required to\nbe paid under the terms of the lease by January 31 of each year, and to issue make up payments\nfor the difference on or before March 1 of each year. From an industry custom and practice\npoint of view, Escondido appears to have complied with this provision through its periodic\nmonitoring of prices and volumes throughout the course of the year, and through its periodic\nreconciliation payments made to the lessor.\n\n    6. The reconciliation provision contained in paragraph IIl(g) deals with underpayments of\nroyalties. Article JII(g) does not contain any term or condition which would terminate the Lease\nin the event lessee fails to correct any underpayment of royalties by the date set forth therein.\nThis is consistent with industry custom and usage. It is not be customary nor usual to apply a\nremedy of termination to a failure to correct royalty underpayments. Industry custom and usage\nwould not consider the provisions of Article XIV dealing with non-payment of royalties to be\ntriggered by any non-compliance with the provisions of Atiicle IIl(g) dealing with reconciliation\npayments.\n\n     7. Industry custom and usage would not interpret a provision relating to the \"true up\" or\nreconciliation of royalty underpayments such as is contained in paragraph III(g) to constitute a\nlease-termination event. In the lessorllessee context, there are frequently misunderstandings,\nissues, disagreements, and disputes relating to the prices and volumes used to make royalty\npayments, and applying a termination provision to underpayment of royalties in these sorts of\ncircumstances is not customary or usual. A lessee would be placed in an untenable position if it\nwas at risk of losing its lease in the event of disagreement about the methodology, pricing, or\nvolumes to be used in royalty calculations, or, if it made a mistake. The lessor would effectively\nbe able to blackmail a lessee, or conduct audits looking for any type of uncorrected\nunderpayment in order to declare a lease terminated. The industry does not conduct business in\nthis manner.\n\n    8. Applying industry custom and Practice, it appears Escondido acted reasonably in its\ncalculation and payment of royalties. The alleged underpayments at issue in this case appear to\nhave been made using accepted industry practices for the making of royalty payments and appear\nto have been done in compliance with at least one of the pricing prongs made the subject of the\nroyalty-payment provisions and Amendment No. 1. Escondido's conduct in making the royalty\npayments in this fashion would not be considered to have been done in \"bad faith\" from an\nindustry point of view and standard, but instead appear to have been made in good faith.\n\n    9. The parties included specific termination provisions in the Lease at Aliicles X and XIV.\nArticle X allows for tetmination in the event lessee is not conducting \"operations\" in compliance\nwith the terms of the Lease and fails to correct such non-compliance following notice by lessor.\nLikewise, as set forth above, the provisions of Article XIV relate to termination for the non-\npayment of royalties, not the underpayment of royalties. The inclusion of these two termination\nprovisions in the Lease coupled with the fact that the Lease does not contain a provision that\ncalls for termination in the event of an underpayment of royalties or a failure to correct an\nunderpayment of royalties suggests that the intent of the parties was not to include an\nunderpayment of royalties or a failure to correct a royalty underpayment as a terminable event.\nThis is consistent with industry practice.\n\n\n\n\n                                               3\n                                                                                                    1138\n\f    10. According to the deposition testimony and reports of other experts, Escondido has\ninvested over $30 million making improvement associated with the Lease. Applying a\ntermination clause to the underpayment of royalties as presented by the circumstances of this\ncase would, under industry standards, impose a harsh, unusual, disadvantageous, costly, unfair,\nand unreasonable consequence upon Escondido.\n\n     II. Forfeiture is a harsh remedy. It is the usual and customary practice in the industry to\nspecify, with clarity, the terms tmder which a lease may terminate. In the absence of an express\nand specific provision, industry practice would not consider an act or omission of the lessee to be\na termination event. In this case, the plain language of Article XIV addresses temlination for the\nnonpayment of a royalty. Article XIV does not expressly or specifically provide for termination\ndue to underpayment of a royalty or a failure to reconcile an underpayment. Similarly, Article\nXIV does not provide for termination of the lease agreement when there is it dispute between the\nlessee and the lessor regarding the calculation of royalty payments.\n\n    12. The oil and gas industry recognizes the \"doctrine of obstmction,\" which includes an\nimplied covenant on the part of the lessor not to interfere with the lessee's performance of the\nlease agreement. In this case, testimony indicates that the lessor's termination of the Enterprise\nsurface-site lease prevented Escondido fwm selling to the high-priced Enterprise market. If the\nlessor's termination was not done in accordance with the surface-site lease, then the termination\nwas not proper and may have prevented Escondido from achieving a higher price for pwduction.\nSuch conduct would be inconsistent with and contrary to the implied covenant on the part of the\nlessor arising under the \"doctrine of obstmction.\"\n\n   FURTHER AFFIANT SA YETH NOT.\n\n\n                                               ~.c-)\n     .9,.,.,J;UBSCRlBED AND SWORN TO BEFORE ME, the undersigned authority, on this\nthty<.:_~_':t day of August, 2014, to certify which witness my hand and seal of office.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 MARIANNE HUNT\n                                                                 NoIary Pubic.

Abington, who after being by me duly sworn, stated under oath:\n\n    1. My name is William B. Abington.' I am a Certified Public Accountant, Certified in\nFinancial Forensics, a Certified Fraud Examiner, and an honors graduate of Texas State\nUniversity. I am a member of the American Institute of Celtified Public Accountants,\nAssociation of Certified Fraud Examiners, and American Bar Association Section of Natural\nResources, Energy and Environmental Law. I am the Managing Director for Alvarez & Marsal's\nGlobal Forensic and Dispute Selvices Group. I have over 25 years experience providing\naccounting and complex financial analysis, forensic investigations and advisOlY selvices. I lead\nAlvarez & Marsal's dispute and forensic services in the energy sector. Additional information\nregarding my qualifications is set out in my resume, a tme and correct copy of which is included\nin Exhibit I attached hereto. I have personal knowledge of the facts set fOlth hcrein, and alll\ncompetent to testilY thereto.\n    2. Attached as Exhibit 1 to my affidavit is a true and correct copy of my report prepared in\nthis case.\n\n    3. I have calculated the royalties Escondido paid Justapor in cOllllection with the Lease\nAgreement. Escondido paid Justapol' $5,749,323 in royalty payments for production under the\npal1ies' Lease Agreement from June, 2009, through April, 2014.\n\n    4. According to the expert l'epOli prepared by Chal'les E. Graham, Ill, Escondido allegedly\n\"underpaid\" Justapol' royalties totaling $80,958. This alleged \"underpayment\" represents 1.4%\nof total royalties paid to Justapol' dUl'ing the period of time set forth in the preceding paragraph.\nMr. Graham alleges royalties in the amount of $3,851 were underpaid for the months of October,\n20 II, November, 2011, and Januaty, 2012. This amount represents 0.00067 of the total royalty\npaid.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   1\n                                             Ex. G                                                      1148\n\f    5. I reviewed the amount of money expended by Escondido on capital improvements made\n under the pat1ies' Lease Agreement. Escondido incurred $33,100,287 of costs on capital\n improvements to the propel1y which is the subject of the pat1ies' Lease Agreement.\n\n    6. Article III and Article XIV ofthe Lease Agreement both address royalties; however, they\naddress two different accounting aspects of royalty payment. Al1iclc III of the parties' Lease\nAgreement addresses the accounting of how to calculate royalty and when to make adjustments\nto the royalty calculation. Article XIV of the Lease Agreement addresses the accounting of\nwhen royalty payments are to be paid to the lessor. At1icle lU(g) describes when to make\nadjustments, 01' \"hue-ups\" to the royalty calculation. Article III does not call for the Lease\nAgreement to terminate if adjustments are not identified by lessee and processed by March I of\nthe succeeding year. It is common in the oil and gas industry for companies to periodically\nreview royalty calculations and to make hue-up payments. It is also common for producers to\nreceive adjustments from purchasers that impact the volume or the price upon which the royalty\npayment was based. These adjllstments may be received numerous months following the initial\nroyalty payment and require the company to make a tme up payment to the royalty owner.\n\n     7. At-ticle XIV describes the timing of when the royalty payment is due, for both existing\nand first production, and describes the consequences for not making the royalty payment.\nSpecifically, Article XIV states \"Royalties payable to Lessor in the malmer hereinabove provided\nfor are due and payable to Lessor within a period of sixty (60) days following each month's\nproduction of oil 01' gas produced and sold from the premises\". Unlike At1icle III(g), which\ndescribes the manner and timing to account for potential adjustments to royalty, At1icle XIV\ndescribes when the initial payment on monthly production should be accounted for to the royalty\nowner and the penalty for a delinquent payment. In other words, it addresses lIOn-payment of the\nroyalty in a timely manner. The reference to a title dispute 01' defect demonstrates this point. If a\ntitle dispute 01' a title defect exists, royalty payments are typically not paid and are instead\naccounted for as \"suspense\" and held accordingly until the title matter can be resolved. In such\ncircumstances, Article XIV provides an exception for non-payment of royalty on a timely basis.\nThe lease termination clause contained in Article XIV is tied to the monthly production and\nrequirement to pay royalty within 60 days following each month's production. Underpayments\nand adjustments to underpayments are not addressed in Al1icle XIV.\n\n    8. I have reviewed the royalty payment information related to the pat1ies' Lease Agreement.\nProduction under the Lease Agreement began during June, 2009. Escondido has routinely made\nroyalty payments to Justapor for production since that time. Additionally, Escondido has made\ntrue-up 01' reconciliation payments to Justapor over the life of the Lease Agreement. Escondido\nmade 15 true-up or reconciliation payments to Justapor fl'om September, 2009, through June,\n2014, totaling $441,596.\n\n    9. Escondido's interpretation of the methodology for royalty payment calculation is\nreasonable. David Wrather of Escondido testified that he believed Alnendment No. 1 to the\nLease Agreement replaced the entire pricing provision contained in Article III of the Lease\nAgreement so that the pricing provision would mirror the Enterprise contract and limit\nEscondido's royalty exposure to what it was receiving fi'om Enterprise. Lease agreements often\ncontain language providing that royalties will be paid based on the lessee's proceeds. Oil and gas\ncompanies generally strive to align their cash outflows (in this case royalty payments), to their\n\n\n\n                                                 2                                                      1149\n\f cash inflow (in this case gas sales). Gas accounting involves many complexities, and companies\n generally desire to pay royalties bused on the same pricc which the company sold the gas to a\n third party.\n\n     10. The royalty pricing provisions in the, tease Agreement are not entirely clear. Article\nIII(b) of the Lease Agreement, as it reads without Amendment No.1, sets f011h a royalty pricing\nmethodology calling for gas royalties to paid at the highest of:\n\n        (i)     Current Market Value\n\n        (ii)    Current Houston Ship Channel Price\n\n        (iii)   Current Proceeds Realized by Lessee, 01'\n\n        (iv)    The highest sales price of any gas were gas produced from the property\n                could be present when sold to a third pat1y.\n\nOil and gas leases commonly include pricing provisions based on current market value, the\nHOllston Ship Channel Price and/or cllrrent proceeds. Even so, the Lease Agreement goes on to\nprovide definitions of each of three terms. An accountant can detemline the value associated\nwith each of these provisions. However, the fourth provision appears unclear, but the Lease\nAgreement does not define this provision.\n\n    11. Amendment No. 1 to the Lease Agreement sets forth pricing amendments to Article III of\nthe Lease Agreement. Amendment No. 1 includes a paragraph that addresses the Houston Ship\nChannel Price. At the end of this pat'agraph, a provision states, in patt:\n\n       \"provided, however, Lessee shall have the right to enter into gas sales contracts\n       that will determine the price upon which gas royalty is calculated if such contracts\n       provide no less than a price redetermination every six months and provide the\n       following minimum terms:\"\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the \"Pricing Provision\").\n\nAlthough the Pricing Provision is inclUded in the satUe section that describes the Houston Ship\nChannel Price, Mr. Wrather testified that he believed the Pricing Provision replaced the royalty\npricing terms :110m the Lease Agreement. Interpreting the Pricing Provision to only relate to the\nHoustoll Ship Channel Price, as Justapor contends, appears to bhu' the meaning of the pricing\npoints contained in Alticle Ill(b) of the Lease Agreement. Accountants are routinely required to\nread and apply oil and gas royalty pricing terms in leases. The language in Amendment No. I\nthat describes the circumstances of the Pricing Provision is describing a current proceeds\ncircumstance. Therefore, if the Pricing Provision in Amendment No. I amends the entire royalty\npricing terms set forth in the Lease Agreement, as testified to by MI'. Wrather, royalties would be\ncalculated based upon the CUI'rcnt proceeds so long as the sales price is greater than the minimum\nprice set forth in the Pricing Provision. This interpretation allows each pricing point to\nconcurrently exist in the Lease Agreement, as atllended. However, if the Pricing Provision\napplies only 10 the Houston Ship Chanllel Price, then the Pricing Provision is stating that the\ncurrent proceeds can be paid instead of the Houston Ship Chmmel Price. Further, if such currcnt\n\n\n\n                                                  3                                                   1150\n\fproceeds are received from a third party at an arms-length basis, then those proceeds represent a\nmarket value transaction. Thus, if the Pricing Provision only applies to the Houston Ship\nChannel Price, then the Houston Ship Channel Price would be the same as currcnt proceeds and\nwould be the same as market value price. This intelpretation appears to blur the distinction of\nthe pricing points and appears to create two different definitions of current proceeds.\n\n     12. The affidavit of Charles E. Graham, III and the copy of his report attached thereto, both\nincluded as Exhibit F to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, sets out alleged trespass\ndamages in the amount of $10,413,114 from March 2, 2012, to Feb11lary 28, 2014, or\nalternatively, $4,825,866 from March 2,2013, to February 28, 2014. According to the Graham\nreport, these numbers are calculated based on \"net proceeds\" but subtract only royalties and taxes\npaid from gross proceeds. The amounts set fOlih by MI'. Graham in his affidavit and report do\nnot account for other operating costs incurred by Escondido. An acc\\ll'ate calculation of the\nvalue of the net proceeds to Escondido would include a reduction for the costs associated with\nproduction. Taking into account the operating costs incuned, the actual value of the net\nproceeds realized by Escondido was $6,671,268 from March, 2012, to February, 2014, and\n$2,820,095 from March, 2013, through February, 2014. A monthly breakdown of these amounts\nis set forth in my report attached hereto as Exhibit I.\n     13. The Graham report alleges royalties were underpaid in the amount of $77,107 for the\ntime period of February, 2012, through January, 2013. It appears the Graham repoli does not\nconsider two factors relating to the calculation of this amount. First, the Graham report does not\naccount for the time period from February 1,2012, tlU'ough February 21, 2012, when Escondido\nwas selling gas only to Kindel' Morgan. Instead, the Gmham report calculates an alleged\nunderpayment related to Escondido's use of a weighted average price for the entire month,\nthereby applying the higher Conoco sales price to the time period during which Escondido was\nnot selling to Conoco. Second, it appears that the Graham report does not consider the difference\nbetween the entrained NGL mix that exists in the Justapor gas stream and the NGL composition\nof the co-mingled gas stream delivered to Conoeo for processing. I have calculated adjustments\nto the alleged underpayment for the two above factors, which result in a decrease of more than\n$55,000 to the alleged underpayment amount of $77, 107. A similar adjustment may be in order\nfor the entmined NGL mix of sales to Copano.\n\n   14. The facts stated in this affidavit are true and correct.\n   FURTHER AFFIANT SA YETH NOT.\n\n\n                                               William BAbington\n\n        SUBSCRIBED AND SWORN TO BEFORE ME, the undersigned authorHy, on this\nthe :') ~ day of September, 2014, to certify which witness my hand and seal of office.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n                                                                                                     1151\n\f                                                                                                                  Filed\n                                                                                                  9/5/2014 3:46:44 PM\n                                                                                                     Esther Degollado\n                                                                                                         District Clerk\n                                                                                                         Webb District\n                                                                                                 2013-cv7 -001396-D1\n\n\n\n\n                                (\n\n\n\n\nEscondido Resources II, llC\n526 Kingwood Drive, /1353\nKingwood, Texas 77339\n(lSl) 359-6780 oHice\n(281) 361·6780 fax\nblll@es(:ondldo·resources,com\n\nAugust 9, 2011\n\nMr. James I<.

Joint venturer filed\ncounterclaims and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Parties entered into a memorandum\nof settlement agreement (MSA). Joint venturer then added claim of fraudulent inducement to\nenter the MSA. Following directed verdict against developer on all claims, and jury trial on\njoint venturer's claims, the 201st District Court, Travis County, Suzanne Covington, J., entered\njudgment for venturer on fraudulent inducement claim and awarded declaratory and injunctive\nrelief and attorney fees for breach of JVA.

Rancho took out a $2.4 million loan from OmniBank\nto develop the property, with Turner as the guarantor. Problems arose during the development,\nso OmniBank required Rancho to bring in a new partner before it would continue financing.\nA Rancho employee put Turner in touch with Eddie Jones who agreed to a joint venture. For\npurposes of the joint venture, Jones established Aquaplex, Inc. Rancho and Aquaplex (through\ntheir representatives Turner and Jones) then signed the Tumbleweed Investment Joint Venture\nAgreement (JVA), which included the following provisions:\n\n   • Contributions: Rancho would contribute the property and existing project; Aquaplex would\n      contribute $400,000.\n\n    *771 • Loans: Only Rancho and the property remained responsible for the existing $2.4 million\n      OmniBank loan—Aquaplex had no liability. Aquaplex also made a $644,000 loan to the joint\n      venture, with repayment priority second only to the OmniBank loan.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Aquaplex could make all but “major decisions” without Rancho's approval.\n      One “major decision” was selling any of the development's properties for less than $60,000\n      per unit. Even in a major decision, however, a partner could not unreasonably withhold its\n      approval.\n\n   • Cash Calls: Aquaplex, as managing partner, could issue a cash call when needed and both\n     partners would be responsible for their pro-rata share. If a partner failed to comply with the\n     cash call, then the other partner could either contribute the amount, loan the joint venture the\n     amount, or could seek to dissolve the joint venture.\n\n   • Third-party Offers: On an offer of purchase by a third-party of the property, either party that\n      dissented to the sale could make a matching offer to buy the property. If no offer was made,\n      the sale would go through.\n\nDisputes between Aquaplex and Rancho arose soon after the JVA was signed. Aquaplex\nterminated the project manager and took over the day-to-day management. Aquaplex also\ndemolished the clubhouse, which Rancho had already completed. Aquaplex then issued a cash\ncall under the terms of the JVA, but Rancho refused to contribute. Rancho sued Aquaplex,\nalleging fraud, breach of duties under the JVA, and conversion and destruction of partnership\nassets. Rancho claimed that Aquaplex overstated the budgetary needs that led to the cash call and\nwas needlessly destroying property. Aquaplex counter-claimed, alleging frivolous suit, negligent\nmisrepresentation, fraud, breach of the JVA, and breach of warranty. Aquaplex claimed that, prior\nto the JVA, Rancho misrepresented the status of the project and Rancho's own financial ability to\nmeet continuing financial obligations. In the meantime, Rancho's loan with OmniBank went into\ndefault, causing concerns about a potential foreclosure.\n\nThe parties proceeded to mediation. They entered into a Rule 11 memorandum of settlement\nagreement (MSA), which envisioned selling the property or ending the joint venture within six\nmonths. The terms of the MSA provided that:\n\n   • OmniBank would roll all existing interest into the note and extend it for six months.\n\n   • Rancho would deposit $100,000 into an OmniBank account to pay all interest, taxes, and\n     expenses on the property for those six months.\n\n   • The property would be listed for six months at $5 million, but that the property could be sold\n      at any price exceeding $4 million. Rancho retained a right of first refusal on any offer.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 7\n\fAquaplex, Inc. v.

The MSA contemplated the later execution of a formal settlement\nagreement. However, Rancho never established the $100,000 account and a formal settlement\nagreement was never executed, causing OmniBank's forbearance agreement to lapse.\n\nAfter the collapse of the settlement, the case proceeded to trial. A few days before trial, Rancho's\ntrial counsel filed a motion to withdraw, claiming that his services were being used to perpetuate\na fraud. Rancho then filed for bankruptcy, which temporarily stayed the trial court proceedings.\nDuring the bankruptcy, an individual named Jeff Greenberg offered to purchase the Tumbleweed\nProperty (the “Greenberg Offer”) for $4.05 million. Rancho refused to consent to the sale and filed\na lis pendens on the property to prevent a sale of the property until the dispute was adjudicated.\nThe bankruptcy court later dismissed Rancho's bankruptcy suit as a bad-faith filing. The trial then\nresumed. Aquaplex amended its petition to include allegations of breach and fraud related to the\nMSA. At the close of Rancho's case in chief, the court directed a verdict against Rancho on all\nof its claims, ruling that Rancho breached the MSA as a matter of law for failing to fund the\n$100,000 account. This left Aquaplex's claims as the subject of the remainder of the trial. In a video\ndeposition shown at trial, Rancho's former attorney testified under the crime-fraud exception about\nhis dealings with Turner. See TEX.R. EVID. 503(d)(1) (“There is no [attorney-client privilege] ...\n[i]f the services of the lawyer were sought or obtained to enable or aid anyone to commit or plan\nto commit what the client knew or reasonably should have known to be a crime or fraud.”). The\nformer attorney testified that he discovered that Rancho did not intend to put up the $100,000\ndeposit required under the MSA and that Rancho was negotiating with bankruptcy attorneys on\nthe side during the settlement process. The jury found that Rancho had breached both the JVA and\nthe MSA and also committed fraud in connection with both. The jury also found that Rancho had\nassigned its interest in the joint venture to OmniBank in an earlier document.\n\nAquaplex elected to recover damages for fraud under the MSA and pursued declaratory and\ninjunctive relief for the breach of the JVA. The trial court entered judgment on the jury verdict,\nwhich awarded Aquaplex:\n\n   • actual damages for fraudulent inducement under the MSA, itemized as:\n\n      # $597,183.70 for the loss of the Greenberg Offer;\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The court held that there was no evidence supporting this relief\nand rendered judgment that Aquaplex take nothing.

First, Aquaplex's counter-claim for declaratory and injunctive\nrelief was premised on breach of the JVA, not the MSA. Second, the unambiguous language of\nthe “assignment” makes clear it was a security interest. It states that Rancho “assigns, transfers\nand conveys unto OMNIBANK ... all of Assignor's right, title and interest in and to Assignor's\n40% ownership in [the joint venture] ... including, but not limited to all rights to cash and other\ndistributions from the Venture.” It states that “[t]his assignment is given in consideration of and\nas security for the payment of all the indebtedness ... owing by Assignor ... to Lender.” It further\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Lastly, it provided that, upon payment in full, the assignment was\nvoid. An “assignment” such as this, where the creditor does not assume any obligations and the\neffectiveness of the instrument is terminated on final payment, is a security interest. See Amco\nTrust, Inc. v.

Nevertheless, we agree with the\ncourt of appeals that nothing in the record indicates OmniBank ever elected to exercise any rights\nit had under the “assignment” upon Rancho's default. Finally, relief cannot *774 be premised on\nParagraphs 5.2(j) and 5.9 of the JVA. Under 5.2(j), Aquaplex, as managing venturer, had a right\nto sell the property as long as the amount of the sale equaled $60,000 or more per condo. The\nGreenberg sale would have fit that description. Under 5.9, Rancho could have offered to buy out\nAquaplex, but did not. There is some evidence that Rancho's actions prevented the Greenberg sale.\nBut none of the contractual provisions cited by Aquaplex in the JVA or MSA explicitly supports a\nforfeiture of interest in the event of a breach. Forfeitures are not favored in Texas, and contracts are\nconstrued to avoid them. See Sirtex Oil Indus., Inc. v. Erigan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2456711\"><a href=\"/opinion/2456711/sirtex-oil-industries-inc-v-erigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 787 (Tex.1966).\nGenerally, the proper remedy for breach is damages.

Thus, the denial of injunctive\nrelief is proper as there was no threat of imminent harm. See Schneider Nat'l Carriers, Inc. v.\nBates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894611\"><a href=\"/opinion/894611/schneider-nat-carriers-inc-v-bates/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 285 (Tex.2004).\n\n[8] [9] [10] While we agree with the court of appeals with regard to relief under the JVA, we\ndo not agree with regard to the fraud claim under the MSA. The elements of fraud are:\n\n             (1) that a material representation was made; (2) the representation was false;\n             (3) when the representation was made, the speaker knew it was false or made it\n             recklessly without any knowledge of the truth and as a positive assertion; (4) the\n             speaker made the representation with the intent that the other party should act\n             upon it; (5) the party acted in reliance on the representation; and (6) the party\n             thereby suffered injury.\n\nIn re FirstMerit Bank, N.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1743657\"><a href=\"/opinion/1743657/in-re-firstmerit-bank-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 758 (Tex.2001) (citing Formosa Plastics Corp. v.\nPresidio Eng'rs & Contractors, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2427974\"><a href=\"/opinion/2427974/formosa-plastics-corp-usa-v-presidio-engineers-and-contractors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (Tex.1998)).

The timing of the bankruptcy, filed just after the execution of the MSA,\nconstitutes further circumstantial evidence of Rancho's lack of intent to perform. These examples\nsatisfy the “slight circumstantial evidence” standard enunciated in Tony Gullo Motors I and\nSpoljaric, and when combined with Rancho's breach, establish the fraudulent intent requirement.\nSee, e.g., Tony Gullo Motors I, 212 S.W.3d at 305–06 (breach plus spoliation of evidence and\nforged signatures met standard); Spoljaric, 708 S.W.2d at 435–36 (breach plus evidence that\nemployer refused to commit bonus plan to writing and remained silent when asked if plan would\nbe approved after it had already been approved met standard).

We disagree. “Texas recognizes two measures of direct damages for common-\nlaw fraud: the out-of-pocket measure and the benefit-of-the-bargain measure.

Under the benefit-of-the-bargain measure,\nAquaplex suffered some damages under each of these categories.\n\nRancho argues that there is no evidence supporting a causal relationship between the alleged fraud\nand the $35,000 attorney's fees awarded in relation to the bankruptcy filing. But the bankruptcy\ndelay was in direct contradiction to the purpose of the MSA—to end the litigation. The attorney's\ntestimony that Rancho was consulting with bankruptcy counsel and that it did not intend to fund\nthe $100,000 as it agreed in the MSA, along with the evidence of the bad faith bankruptcy filing\nis *776 legally sufficient evidence to support these damages.\n\n [17] Some evidence also supports Aquaplex's claim that it lost the benefit of the sale of\nthe property due to Rancho's fraud. “Under the benefit-of-the bargain measure, lost profits\non the bargain may be recovered if such damages are proved with reasonable certainty.”\nFormosa Plastics, 960 S.W.2d at 50. But the damages cannot be based upon an “entirely\nhypothetical, speculative bargain that was never struck and would not have been consummated.”\nId. “[D]etermining whether lost profits have been proved with reasonable certainty is a fact-\nintensive determination dependent upon the circumstances of a particular case,” but “[w]hen a\nreview of the surrounding circumstances establishes that the profits are not reasonably certain,\nthere is no evidence to support the lost profits award.” Id. at 50 n. 3. Here, there is some evidence\nthat Aquaplex lost profits due to the fraud—specifically the loss of a sale to Greenberg. Greenberg\noffered $4.05 million for the property, which under the terms of the MSA, satisfied the minimum\noffer amount of $4 million. Rancho refused to consent to the sale and filed a lis pendens, effectively\nblocking the sale. The court of appeals held, and Rancho argues, that there is no evidence as to\nwhy the Greenberg Offer failed, and it is thus speculative to claim the alleged fraud caused its\nfailure. But both parties testified that they knew of the Greenberg Offer, and Rancho testified that\nit filed the lis pendens to prevent the sale. This is sufficient evidence that the sale fell through due\nto Rancho's actions. Therefore, damages were proper.\n\n [18] The damages were calculated incorrectly, however. The jury and trial court awarded\n$597,183.70 for the loss of the sale. It appears from the record that this figure was reached by\nsubtracting Aquaplex's original investment of $1,044,000 ($400,000 in contribution and $644,000\nloan) from $1,641,183.70, which is the amount Aquaplex argued it was due (including interest)\nunder the JVA had the property been sold to Greenberg. But this figure does not take into account\nthat Aquaplex still received an interest in the property by way of its interest in the joint venture,\nwhich survived the failed sale under the Greenberg Offer. The damages figure must reflect this\noffset. See Formosa Plastics, 960 S.W.2d at 49–50. Therefore, the trial court's award was not\nproper and must be recalculated.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The\ncourt of appeals held that there was no evidence that the money was to be paid to Aquaplex or that\nAquaplex had to make the payments in lieu of Rancho. 253 S.W.3d at 736. Aquaplex argues that\nthe $100,000 was a benefit-of-the-bargain, and that it was damaged by Rancho's failure to fund\nthe $100,000 because the property remained encumbered with this amount. The court of appeals\nis partially correct: Rancho's failure to fund the $100,000 damaged the joint venture because its\nasset is encumbered by additional interest. Because of its ownership interest in the joint venture,\nAquaplex was injured and may recover to the extent of that injury. This amount, though, would\nnot necessarily be $100,000, and must be recalculated.\n\nThe court of appeals also held that the evidence did not support $279,000 in damages for the loss of\nthe forbearance agreement because Aquaplex put on evidence of damages over a two-year period\nwhen the agreement at issue was only a one-year period. 253 S.W.3d at 735. The court of appeals\nis correct here. Aquaplex outlined the value of a two-year forbearance agreement in a chart at trial,\nbut the agreement *777 introduced into evidence was only for one year. Thus, while there may\nhave been damages, it was only for one year and Aquaplex failed to put on any evidence of the\nappropriate amount of damages for a one-year period.\n\n [20] We hold that some evidence supported an award of damages for fraud under the MSA, just\nnot at the level awarded by the trial court. This Court may not order a remittitur, but the courts of\nappeals may. TEX.R.APP. P. 46.3; Tony Gullo Motors I, 212 S.W.3d at 310. Therefore, we affirm\nthe portion of the court of appeals' judgment rejecting Aquaplex's declaratory and injunctive relief,\nand reverse the portion of the court of appeals' judgment related to the monetary damages. We\nremand the case to the court of appeals so that it may determine whether to remand for a new\ntrial on damages, see Formosa Plastics, 960 S.W.2d at 51, or whether to suggest a remittitur, see\nTEX.R.APP. P. 46.3; Tony Gullo Motors I, 212 S.W.3d at 310. Furthermore, because we hold\nthat actual damages were proper, the court of appeals must reconsider whether punitive damages\nare appropriate.

Under our holding, Aquaplex has only one recovery.\n3      This provision in the JVA listed Aquaplex's authority as “managing venturer.” It provided that Aquaplex is authorized to “[sell] all\n       or a portion of the Land or the Project for $60,000.00 per condominium unit or more.”\n4      This provision in the JVA discussed third-party offers. It provided that if an offer was made, a dissenting partner may buy out the\n       other partner for the amount that partner would have made if the sale went through and the joint venture was immediately liquidated.\n       Otherwise, the third-party offer shall be accepted.\n5      Rancho did not raise this alternative ground for affirmance as a cross-point in its response to the petition for review. It raised it for\n       the first time in its brief on the merits. Aquaplex argues Rancho has waived this point. See TEX.R.APP. P. 53.3(c)(2) (providing\n       that the issues presented section in the response to the petition for review must include any “independent grounds for affirmance of\n       the court of appeals' judgment”). Rancho's “Issues Presented” section did not assert that the court of appeals could have found no\n       evidence supporting the intent element. But Rule 53.4 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure provides: “[T]o request that the Supreme\n       Court consider [points briefed in the court of appeals but not decided by that court], a party may raise those issues or points in the\n       petition, the response, the reply, any brief, or a motion for rehearing.” TEX.R.APP. P. 53.4. The court of appeals did not consider\n       the intent element, but Rancho raised that issue before the court of appeals and its brief on the merits before this Court. Therefore,\n       the point is not waived.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

That decision sustains the\nholding of the Court of Civil Appeals in the present case.\n\n[2] The oil lease contained this provision:\n         ‘It is further agreed that in the event oil is found in paying quantities in said\n         first well, then the lessee agrees and covenants that within thirty days from the\n         completion of such successful well he will begin the boring of a second well on\n         some other acre of said tract herein leased, and continue to bore additional wells\n         with due diligence in such order as to additional wells on the tract herein leased\n         as developments may justify, until at least five or six wells have been completed,\n         or the acre upon which said second party has failed to drill a well reverts to the\n         first party by written notice to that effect being served upon said second party by\n         said first party.’\n\n\n\n\nThe tract of land leased embraced about 20 acres and was laid off in acre blocks. Decker bored his\nfirst two wells upon different acres. He completed five wells with due diligence, but four of them\n *94 were upon the same acre. **386 Upon the question as to whether this provision in the lease\nwould sustain a forfeiture because of a failure to bore all of the five wells upon different acres, the\nCourt of Civil Appeals held that the provision was ambiguous and that its meaning should have\nbeen submitted to the jury for decision.\n [3] If the provision is ambiguous, that alone condemns it as a forfeiture provision. A forfeiture\nshould rest upon surer ground. Where a contract is so vague in its terms that a court cannot\ndetermine its meaning, it would be unjust to enforce a forfeiture under it against one whose only\nfault has been to possibly mistake its meaning. Forfeitures are harsh and punitive in their operation.\nThey are not favored by the law, and ought not to be. The authority to forfeit a vested right or\nestate should not rest in provisions whose meaning is uncertain and obscure. It should be found\nonly in language which is plain and clear, whose unequivocal character may render its exercise\nfair and rightful.\n\n\nIt is not necessary that we determine whether this clause in the lease requires the boring of the five\nwells upon five different acres, or sanctions their location upon but two different acres. If it be\nconceded that it admits of the first construction, it is not certain that such is its true construction.\nIt does not plainly say that each of the wells shall be upon a different acre. It is only by inference,\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    3\n\fDecker v.

It\nheld that there was evidence tending to establish an entire abandonment of the land by the lessee,\nand also evidence of his failure to operate producing wells for 30 days and longer. Its ruling simply\nwas that such being the record the issues both of an entire forfeiture and a partial forfeiture should\nhave been submitted to the jury.\n\n\nIf we have jurisdiction to review this holding of the Court of Civil Appeals, it is in virtue\nof subdivision 6 of article 1521 as amended by the Act of 1917 (chapter 75), by which the\nappellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is now governed. That is, it must appear that the\nruling constitutes ‘an error of law * * * of such importance to the jurisprudence of the State, as\nin the opinion of the Supreme Court requires correction.’ The amendment of this subdivision by\nthe Act of 1917 was plainly intended to further limit the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as\nconferred by the Act of 1913. Whether the Court of Civil Appeals ‘has erroneously declared the\nsubstantive law of the case’ is no longer the test as applied to cases falling within the subdivision.\nThe amendment declares, in effect, that it is not enough that the error of law be obvious, in the\nopinion of the Supreme Court; nor that it be of importance to the aggrieved party; nor **387\nthat its correction be necessary in the view of the Supreme Court to prevent an injustice in the\nimmediate case; nor even that it be ‘of importance’ to the jurisprudence of the *96 State. For\nthe Supreme Court to be invested with the power to revise the ruling, it is required that it amount\nto an error of law ‘of such importance’ to the jurisprudence of the State as in the opinion of the\ncourt requires correction. This clearly presupposes a ruling of such erroneous consequence as, if\npermitted to stand, would constitute a serious departure from the established law or introduce a\ndoctrine violative of fundamental principles.\n\nWhatever may be the difficulties of its administration, this is the theory and plain meaning of the\namendment. It is the written law, and our duty is to give it effect.\n [5] We do not consider a ruling of the Court of Civil Appeals in a particular case either that there\nwas some evidence warranting the submission of a given issue to the jury, or that there was no\nevidence justifying its submission, as within the purview of the amendment unless it can be fairly\nregarded as so flagrantly wrong as to amount to a virtual denial and abrogation of the established\nrules of law which, in the one instance, enjoin upon the trial court the exercise of its essential\nfunction, and in the other preserve the right of jury trial. Where these questions are presented, our\npractice is to examine the record; but unless it discloses that the ruling is of the character stated,\nwe do not regard it as one within the court's power to revise.\n\n\nWe have examined the record here under the assignment challenging the ruling of the Court of\nCivil Appeals above noted. If erroneous at all, the ruling was not so clearly wrong as to bring it\nproperly within the Supreme Court's jurisdiction.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

S. art. 1521, Acts of 1917.\n\nIt is my opinion that whenever it is shown here, to the satisfaction of this court, that a Court of\nCivil Appeals has held erroneously that a given issue is or is not supported by some evidence,\nthereby determining whether such issue is or is not properly referable to the jury, such error should\nbe treated by this court as being, in and of itself, of such importance to the jurisprudence of the\nstate as to require correction.\n\nI believe that the requirements of this jurisdictional statute are met in every such instance, and that\nintrinsically such error is of the stated importance, even though such error may have been *97\ncommitted in treating an issue which is not of frequently recurring nature or of general interest,\nand even though such erroneous ruling may not have been intended as an assertion of a general\nprinciple or a general rule of practice.\n\nI think that a holding by the Court of Civil Appeals, approving or directing the submission by the\ndistrict court to the jury of a given issue when in the opinion of the Supreme Court there is no\nevidence to support it, or approving or directing refusal of a district court to submit to the jury a\ngiven issue when in the opinion of the Supreme Court there is evidence to support it, constitutes\ninevitably in every instance ‘a serious departure from the established law,’ and introduces into our\njurisprudence ‘a doctrine violative of fundamental principles.’ Instances of the former character\ninvolve refusal of the trial court to perform an ‘essential function’-to discharge a legal duty which\nought not to be shifted to the jury; and instances of the latter character involve a practical denial\nof the right of trial by jury, in plain contravention of our state Constitution.\n\nSuch errors very naturally will occur occasionally, and that is bad enough, even though all such\nerrors be subject to correction by our Supreme Court; but for any such error to be recognized\nby this court and yet not be subject to correction by it, for lack of jurisdiction in this court, is, I\nthink, a very serious reproach to our jurisprudence. In view of the phraseology of said amended\nsubdivision 6 I cannot concur in a construction of it which entails that deplorable result.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We\nreverse and render in part; modify in part; and, as modified, affirm in part.\n\nThe significant economic issue between the parties is who owns the two billboards located in\nDallas. If the forfeiture was effective, the billboards are owned by the landlord, BBE. If the\nforfeiture was ineffective, the billboards are owned by the tenant, Outdoor Systems, who has the\nright under the leases to come upon the land and remove the billboards. In 1998, the city of Dallas\nenacted a moratorium prohibiting the construction of new billboards within the city limits. The\neffect of that moratorium significantly increased *69 the value of the two billboards. The trial\ncourt found that the value of the billboards as constructed on the land is substantial and that the\nvalue of the billboards removed from the land is minimal.\n\nThe two leases were dated July 20, 1987, and each provided for a primary term of 10 years. After\nthe expiration of the 10–year term, each lease was automatically renewed for 1–year terms unless\nterminated in writing by either party 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the respective lease.\nThe anniversary date for each lease was September 1.\n\nIn February of 1997, Outdoor Systems acquired the leasehold interest in two tracts of land which\ncontained a billboard on each tract. At that time, the land was owned by Sun NLF Limited\nPartnership. BBE purchased the land from Sun on or about June 29, 1999. On or about June 28,\n1999, Sun sent a letter to its tenant, Outdoor Systems, advising Outdoor Systems that it was selling\nthe land to BBE and that future rent payments should be sent to BBE. Before receiving the letter,\nOutdoor Systems had mailed the July rent to Sun.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Upon receipt of the July 2 letter, Tanya\nLillie, an employee of Outdoor Systems, contacted Donald L. Woodsmall, BBE's manager, and\ntold Woodsmall that the July rent had been sent to Sun. Because Sun had returned the July rent\npayment to Outdoor Systems and because Outdoor Systems only cut rent checks once a month,\nLillie asked Woodsmall if Outdoor Systems could reissue the July payment when the rent check for\nAugust was sent out. Woodsmall told Lillie that he would get back to her regarding her proposal.\nWoodsmall did not get back in touch with Lillie.\n\nOn July 16, 1999, BBE sent a second letter (second default notice) to Outdoor Systems. This\nletter stated that Outdoor Systems had miscalculated the amount of rent owed under the leases\nand demanded that Outdoor Systems perform other acts within ten days or the leases would be in\ndefault and BBE would look “to all of our remedies both at law and under the Leases.” The July\nrent, as calculated by Outdoor Systems, was tendered with the August payment. 1 BBE rejected\nboth the July and August payments.\n\nEach lease contained the following provisions:\n\n   4. Rentals.\n\n   (c) It shall be deemed a default by Lessee under the terms of this Agreement if Lessee fails to\n   make any payment to Lessor pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and such failure continues\n   for a period of ten (10) days following receipt by Lessee of written notice from Lessor specifying\n   such default.\n\n   5.

The payments are not to\n      fluctuate on a monthly basis, but a new minimum is to be set each year based on 25% of the\n      previous year's gross billings. Outdoor Systems method miscalculates the Lease payments\n      owing and results in an understatement of the true payments. The arrearages for the last\n      ten months alone equal $878.50. The amount of the arrearages prior to the last ten months\n      is unknown to us as we do not have the information needed to calculate those payments.\n      Inasmuch as BBE, l.l.c. has succeeded to all of the rights, title and interest of the previous\n      Property owner in and to the Leases, these arrearages under the Leases belong to BBE. I\n      would appreciate receiving within ten days from the date hereof both the $878.50 relating to\n      the last ten months and the total arrearages from the inception of the Leases up to the last\n      ten months; failing which, Outdoor Systems will be in default under the Leases and we will\n      look to all of our remedies both at law and under the Leases.\n\n      We would also ask that you forward to us your advertising contracts from the inception of the\n      Leases to the present so that we may audit and calculate the percentage payments that are\n      owed throughout the term of the Leases. We are preserving all of our rights with regard to\n      the previous underpayments of rent until such audit has been performed. (Emphasis added)\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It was merely a reminder that the July rent had not been\npaid. The July 16 letter demanded too much. The demand was not specific but was excessive,\nunreasonable, imprecise, and required Outdoor Systems to perform acts not required by the leases.\n\n [3] The July 16 letter demanded that Outdoor Systems, within 10 days, pay to BBE an unspecified\namount based upon “total arrearages from the inception of the Leases.” The leases were signed by\nthe original tenant and landlord in 1987. Lillie, an employee of Outdoor Systems, testified that she\nwas responsible for calculating and paying the rent on the billboards. Lillie testified that, assuming\nthere was an arrearage owed on the two leases, neither she nor anyone else at Outdoor Systems\nhad the information or ability to calculate, within the 10–day period, any arrearage *72 that might\nhave been owed back to 1987. The trial court, in its findings of fact, found that Outdoor Systems\nignored the July 16 demand from BBE and that Outdoor Systems made no effort to calculate\nor pay any rental arrearages. We look at the notice of default that was sent to Outdoor Systems\nby BBE to determine if the notice was sufficient. The response of Outdoor Systems does not\ndetermine the legal sufficiency of the notice. The demand letter purported to address both of the\nleases; however, it failed to segregate the amount demanded to cure the alleged default under each\nagreement. Furthermore, BBE demanded that Outdoor Systems provide advertising contracts from\nthe inception of the leases so that BBE could audit and calculate the percentage payments that\nwere owed throughout the term of the leases.\n\n [4] Outdoor Systems was not personally liable for any unpaid rent prior to the time it became the\ntenant under the leases in February 1997.

The issues involved in this appeal were not discussed in Rohrt. There, the court observed\nthat the effect of the default notice was not “disputed.”\n\nNeither the July 2 letter nor the July 16 letter was a sufficient notice of default. On August 11,\n1999, BBE sent a “Notice of Termination” to Outdoor Systems purporting to terminate both leases\nand to declare that title to the billboards had “automatically” vested in BBE. We hold that the\nnotice of termination was ineffective because it was not preceded by a proper notice of default.\nSee Ogden v. Gibraltar Savings Association, supra.\n\nOutdoor Systems refused to vacate the land and continued to operate the billboards and tender\nmonthly rental payments to BBE who rejected each of the tendered rent payments. On May 12,\n2000, BBE sent a letter to Outdoor Systems stating that the leases had terminated because of\nnumerous defaults by Outdoor Systems. However, to remove any misunderstanding, BBE notified\nOutdoor Systems that, pursuant to Paragraph 3(b) of the leases, the May 12 letter constituted\nOutdoor Systems's 60–day notice of termination. The letter stated, “The Leases shall not renew\nbut shall cease and expire on the anniversary date thereof, which can in no event be later than\nSeptember 1, 2000.” Outdoor Systems agrees that this was a proper termination of the leases\nbetween the parties.\n\nOutdoor Systems vacated the land prior to the September 1, 2000, anniversary date and advised\nBBE that it was prepared to remove the billboards. BBE objected to the removal of the billboards\nand refused to permit Outdoor Systems to remove the structures.\n\nWe reverse the trial court's judgment awarding title to the two billboards to BBE, and we render\njudgment that the two billboards located on the separate tracts of real property described in the\njudgment as Exhibits A and B are owned by Outdoor Systems and that Outdoor Systems *73 has\nthe right to remove the two billboards.\n\nIn its conclusions of law, the trial court found that the leases terminated on August 11, 1999, and\nthat Outdoor Systems violated TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 80.002 et seq. (Vernon\n1997 & Supp.2002) by remaining in possession after that date and by failing to remove advertising\nfrom the billboards after August 11. The court assessed trespass damages against Outdoor Systems\nin the amount of $75,604.58. We reverse this award and render judgment that Outdoor Systems\nis not liable to BBE for trespass damages because the leases did not terminate on August 11. The\ntermination letter was ineffective because it was based upon an insufficient notice of default.\n\nAs part of its damages award, the trial court found that Outdoor Systems was liable to BBE for\nunpaid rent of $4,430.13. Outdoor Systems does not challenge this finding. We, therefore, will\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

However, the court stated that a party\ncould make an excessive demand for an unliquidated sum. The court said:\n\n            Certainly one can conceive of circumstances in which a demand for an\n            unliquidated sum would have to be characterized as excessive, and attorney's\n            fees denied.\n\nThe Findlay court also held:\n\n            [W]e do not find a sufficient level of unreasonableness or bad faith to warrant\n            finding excessive demand as a matter of law.\n\nWe find in the present case, as a matter of law, that the demand made by BBE in the July 16\nletter was an excessive demand for an unliquidated sum and, thus, discharged any liability for fees\nexpended thereafter.\n\nBBE's demand was not for a specific liquidated sum. As pointed out earlier in this opinion, the July\n16 letter demanded that Outdoor Systems, within 10 days, pay BBE an unspecified amount based\nupon “total arrearages from the inception of the Leases.” The original lessor and lessee executed\nthe leases in 1987. Outdoor Systems acquired the leasehold interest in 1997. BBE demanded that\nOutdoor Systems provide advertising contracts from the inception of the leases. The leases were\nforfeited by the trial court, and title to the billboards was awarded to BBE. We have reversed that\nfinding. The trial court found that Outdoor Systems was a trespasser because it failed to comply\nwith the demand and awarded BBE $75,604.58. We have reversed that finding. Under our decision,\nBBE has a judgment against Outdoor Systems for $4,430.13. Unlike the court in Findlay, we do\nfind a sufficient “level of unreasonableness ... to warrant finding excessive demand as a matter\nof law.”\n\n[7] BBE argues that Outdoor Systems cannot rely upon the defense of “excessive demand”\nbecause Outdoor Systems failed to expressly plead the defense.

In Paragraph IV of BBE's trial brief submitted to the trial court, BBE\nstated:\n\n   Excessive Demand—A creditor who makes an excessive demand upon a debtor is not entitled\n   to attorneys' fees for subsequent litigation. An excessive demand is one which is manifestly\n   unreasonable, or made in bad faith. Findlay v. Cave, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1679808\"><a href=\"/opinion/1679808/findlay-v-cave/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58 (Tex.1981). Where\n   the demand in Findlay was for more than a jury awarded the close of the trial, the Court\n   found that was some evidence of excessive demand, but not enough to support the “manifestly\n   unreasonable” or “bad faith” standard. The court noted that the cases on excessive demand\n   occurred where the amount in controversy was liquidated and the creditor made demand for\n   more than it was entitled. Clearly the testimony in this case shows that BBE's demand for a\n   specific sum of money was for less than the amount due and that its further demand was for\n   an amount that could reasonably be thought to be within the knowledge and control of Outdoor\n   Systems. There is no authority to support that an excessive demand is otherwise void or vitiated.\n\nBBE did not argue in the trial court that Outdoor Systems had failed to sufficiently plead the\ndefense. On the contrary, it is apparent that the issue was before the court, as evidenced by BBE's\nbriefing and argument presented to the trial court. We hold that Outdoor Systems's “excessive\ndemand” defense to any liability for attorney's fees was tried by implied consent. See City of Los\nFresnos v. Gonzalez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1517411\"><a href=\"/opinion/1517411/city-of-los-fresnos-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1993, no writ). The award of\nattorney's fees, both trial and appellate, to BBE is reversed; and we render judgment that Outdoor\nSystems is not responsible for attorney's fees.\n\n[8] In its brief, under issues presented, Outdoor Systems states:\n\n            [T]his case should be remanded for consideration of Outdoor Systems'\n            counterclaims, including its claim for conversion of the billboards. (Emphasis\n            added)\n\nOutdoor Systems argues that, because the trial court erroneously concluded that BBE's termination\ncomplied with the leases, the trial court improperly failed to consider Outdoor Systems's\ncounterclaims. This was a conventional nonjury trial on the merits. The judgment provides that\n“all relief not expressly granted herein is denied.” The trial court considered the counterclaims,\nand they were denied. We overrule Outdoor Systems's request that its counterclaims be remanded\nto the trial court for consideration.\n\n[9]    [10]    [11] Finally, Outdoor Systems seeks a remand of this matter to the trial court in order to\nseek the recovery of the billboards pursuant to our holding. 2 It would appear that Outdoor Systems\nhas an avenue for seeking the recovery of the billboards without the case being remanded to the\ntrial court. Texas courts have long held that a party obtaining any advantage or benefit through a\ntrial court's judgment that is later reversed must return the benefit to the other party.

None of the prior\n       landlords had complained. At trial, Outdoor Systems attempted to prove an alleged oral modification between a prior tenant and\n       landlord. The trial court agreed with BBE that Outdoor Systems and prior tenants had not followed the contract in the method used\n       to calculate the rent. The trial court found that the alleged modification was invalid. Outdoor Systems argues that the earlier conduct\n       of BBE and its predecessors waived, as a matter of law, any claimed forfeiture arising from payment of reduced rents. Because we\n       hold that the forfeiture was invalid, it is not necessary that we reach this argument urged by Outdoor Systems.

We note\nthat, among other contentions, appellee insists that appellant's claim for possession and title\nbased on termination or forfeiture of the contract was not raised at the trial level and cannot\nproperly be advanced for the first time and considered in this appeal. However, after reviewing the\nentire record, including the pleadings and the evidence admitted, we have determined to consider\nappellant's asserted rights concerning the alleged forfeiture and the injunctive relief sought.\n\nAfter trial on the merits, the trial court rendered its judgment which decreed that: (1) certain\ninterlocutory orders be dissolved which had restrained and enjoined Travarillo Associates, the\nassignee of Young Properties, the original purchaser, from the taking possession of the Travelodge\nWest Motel, the subject of the contract of sale entered into on April 4, 1973; (2) Travarillo is\nthe owner and holder of all rights of ‘purchaser’ as formerly held by Young Properties under the\ncontract of sale; (3) the contract of sale is in full force and effect, and Travarillo with its acquired\nrights as purchaser is entitled to possession of the Travelodge West Motel described therein; (4)\ncertain monies tendered into the registry of the court by Travarillo be paid to T—Anchor, the seller,\nand that the balance in the registry be paid to Travarillo; (5) the only real parties in interest in this\ncase are T—Anchor and Travarillo; and (6) all other parties named as defendants have no interest\nin this controversy and are dismissed from the suit. Subsequent to the judgment, the trial court\nordered that the agreement of the parties with respect to the payment and receipt of the monies\npaid out from the registry of the court would not constitute any agreement to the judgment entered\nin this cause by T—Anchor nor in any manner affect T—Anchor's notice and right of appeal.\n\nUpon request, findings of fact and conclusions of law were made by the trial court. Since this\nappeal is determinable from competing equitable considerations necessarily based upon a series of\nacts and conduct of the parties, we shall set out what we deem to be the court's significant factual\nfindings and legal conclusions.\n\nAmong other facts found by the trial court were that: on April 4, 1973, T—Anchor, the seller,\nentered into a contract for the sale of the Travelodge West Motel in Amarillo, Texas, with Young,\nthe buyer; as a part of the same transaction, Young and Travarillo entered into an agreement of\npurchase and sale of the motel whereby Travarillo acquired all of Young's interest *625 in the\nmotel; T—Anchor consented to the assignment of the contract interest from Young to Travarillo\nupon the terms that Travarillo could acquire all of Young's interest in the motel if Young should\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The court further found that pursuant to\na proceeding brought by Young, on October 31, 1973, a bankruptcy court in California entered\nits order restraining all creditors of Young from accelerating or attempting to accelerate any\nindebtedness of Young, from enforcing any rights or remedies provided in any agreements with\nYoung, and from cancelling any such agreements or commencing any kind of forfeiture proceeding\nagainst Young; and that throughout the restraining period ordered by the bankruptcy court, Young\nremained in possession of the motel, but made no payments to T—Anchor or to Travarillo.\n\nAdditionally, the court found that: T—Anchor defaulted in the first and second lien payments\nwhich it was required to make to Home Savings and Loan Association of Waterloo, Iowa, and to\nAmarillo National Bank of Amarillo, Texas, under the sale contract with Young; both T—Anchor\nand Travarillo appeared in the bankruptcy proceeding seeking relief from the bankruptcy court's\nrestraining order, T—Anchor seeking cancellation of the sales contract and Travarillo seeking\ncancellation of the lease agreement and possession of the motel; T—Anchor, in its pleadings in\nbankruptcy court, fully recognized that Travarillo was the assignee of Young and held all of the\ninterest of Young in the motel and that Young was only a defaulting lessee at the time of the\nbankruptcy; on April 2, 1974, the bankruptcy court entered an order directing Young to vacate\nthe motel ten days after the date of the order, and dissolving the restraining orders against T—\nAnchor and Travarillo on or about April 12, 1974; as of the date of the dissolution of the restraining\norders, Travarillo was the owner of all of the interest of Young in the sales contract with T—\nAnchor; immediately after the bankruptcy court entered its order on April 2, 1974, the general\npartner of Travarillo tendered full payment of all delinquent land sales contract installments to\nT—Anchor and otherwise tendered performance of all delinquent obligations of Young to T—\nAnchor to make performance current under the contract; and T—Anchor wrongfully refused the\ntender by Travarillo and assumed possession of the motel as Young vacated.\n\nThe trial court further found that: the money contributed to the purchase of the motel was\nprincipally that of Travarillo in the amount of $300,000; T—Anchor received as cash consideration\nfor the motel $137,500; and some $200,884.32 was required to bring the obligations of Young\ncurrent under the land sales contract, including delinquent interest and penalty due from T—\nAnchor to the first lienholder plus attorneys' fees paid by T—Anchor in attempting to secure\nperformance of the contract or possession, all of which, ought equitably to be reimbursed to T\n—Anchor.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

For convenience we shall discuss\nT—Anchor's points of error in the same groupings as in its brief.\n [1] [2] In its first two points T—Anchor contends that the judgment of the trial court denying\nforfeiture of the contract cannot be supported without findings of waiver and default on the part of\nT—Anchor. T—Anchor requested amended and additional findings of fact and conclusions of law\nwhich would have established and held that T—Anchor did not waive its right under the contract\nto forfeiture and that through the effective date of forfeiture, T—Anchor fulfilled its obligations\nunder the contract. Both of these theories of waiver and default by T—Anchor as requested are\ninconsistent with and contrary to the findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the trial court.\nThe trial court need not make findings of fact or conclusions of law which are in conflict with\nthe original findings and conclusions made.

Further, in view of the holding of the trial court that\nTravarillo is entitled to equitable relief from forfeiture, a finding of waiver or default by T—\nAnchor is not necessary to support the judgment. Points of error numbers 1 and 2 are overruled.\n\n [3] In points of error numbers 3 through 11, T—Anchor contends that the tender of performance\nby Travarillo was deficient and thus cannot operate to prevent forfeiture of the contract of sale.\nPoints of error numbers 3, 5—7, and 9—11 all concern the amount of the tender of money made\nby Travarillo. T—Anchor contends that a tender of the amount necessary to bring the contract\npayments current is not tender of a sufficient amount to put Travarillo in possession of the motel as\nits owner. Such a contention by T—Anchor is *627 predicated upon its assertion that the contract\nwas, indeed, forfeited; therefore, T—Anchor contends that the only amount that can be tendered\nby Travarillo to put Travarillo in possession of the motel is the balance of the unpaid purchase\nprice under the contract of sale. However, the holding of the trial court was that the contract was in\nfull force and effect so that the equity of redemption mentioned in paragraph XIII of the contract\nwas not required to be invoked. Thus, Travarillo was not required to pay the balance of the unpaid\npurchase price since it had never forfeited the contract. By bringing the contract obligations up to\ndate, Travarillo made T—Anchor whole under the contract of sale which was held to be in full\nforce and effect.\n\n\nFurther, in points of error numbers 3—11, T—Anchor contends that the equities are in its favor\nto allow a forfeiture and not in favor of Travarillo to deny forfeiture. The trial court found that it\nwould be exceptionally harsh and unjust to forfeit the monies contributed to the motel project and\nunjust enrichment to T—Anchor to allow forfeiture of Travarillo's rights under the contract in the\nface of unusual circumstances, namely, that the debtor in bankruptcy, Young, was continued in\npossession of the motel while paying no one. The trial court held that the order of the bankruptcy\ncourt prevented forfeiture of the contract until April 12, 1974. The trial court further held that since\nTravarillo was tendering performance in full prior to April 12, 1974, it would be unreasonable\nto refuse Travarillo the right to pick up the contract obligations of its assignor Young upon\ntermination of the restraining order of the bankruptcy court. The trial court found that T—Anchor\ndefaulted on its first and second lien payments because of the restaining orders which continued\nYoung in possession without requiring Young to make contract payments to T—Anchor.\n [4] [5] It is our opinion that the evidence supports the holding of the trial court that Travarillo\nwas entitled to equitable relief from forfeiture. It is an established rule of law that forfeitures are\ndisfavored. Although parties may contract to provide for forfeiture upon default, where equities\nare shown which justify a continuation of the contract rather than forfeiture of it, the forfeiture will\nbe prevented.

In view of the disfavor with which the law looks upon forfeitures in a contract for the sale\nof land and in the light of the unusual chain of events which eventually left Travarillo as the buyer\nunder the contract ready, willing and able to perform, we overrule points of error numbers 3—11.\n\n [6] T—Anchor contends in point of error number 12 that the trial court erred in holding that\nthe net profits of the motel earned during a period of possession and operation by T—Anchor\nwere the property of Travarillo as owner of complete title to the motel. T—Anchor presupposes\nthat a forfeiture has, in fact, occurred. The trial court held that a forfeiture was prevented by the\nrestraining order of the bankruptcy court. Therefore, possession of the motel by T—Anchor was\nduring a period when Travarillo was entitled to possession, and, under the holding of the trial\ncourt that the contract is in full force and effect, Travarillo is, and T—Anchor is not, entitled to\nthe profits of the operation. It is our opinion that the holding of the trial court is sustained by the\nevidence and the equities of this particular situation. Point of error number 12 is overruled.\n\n [7] In points of error numbers 13—15, T—Anchor contends that it was error to hold that\ndefault in the payment of monthly installments by Young commenced with the failure to make\nthe November, 1973 payment. T—Anchor points to undisputed testimony that payments were\nlate in more than one month prior to November, 1973, and that notices of default were sent to\nYoung. The trial court made no express *628 finding of waiver by T—Anchor. We recognize\nthat where express findings of fact are made by the trial court, independent issuable facts may not\nbe supplied by extension of the express findings. Duncan v.

However, the same evidence that would support a finding of waiver by T—Anchor supports\nthe trial court's application of equitable principles which would efficiently prevent forfeiture of\nthe contract sale. Testimony by Boyce Box, president of T—Anchor, revealed that T—Anchor\nultimately received purchase money installments up to the payment due in November, 1973, and\nthat an oral extension of time until October 11 was agreed to by T—Anchor after the September,\n1973 payment was made late. This testimony tends to show that T—Anchor considered the\ncontract as continuing after making its initial gesture with respect to forfeiture, and supports the\ngranting of equitable relief to prevent forfeiture. Points of error numbers 13—15 are overruled.\n\n\nIn points of error numbers 16—22, T—Anchor next contends that the trial court erred in failing\nto find certain facts since such findings are, as stated in T—Anchor's brief, ‘supported by the\nuncontroverted evidence.’ The findings requested by T—Anchor relate to the defaults, notices of\nsuch defaults sent to Young and absence of tender of performance by Young, prior to November,\n1973, as claimed by T—Anchor to establish forfeiture of the contract and termination of Young's\nand, therefore, Travarillo's interest under the contract.\n [8] Even if the specific findings requested by T—Anchor had been made, the result reached by\nthe trial court would not necessarily be changed. In fact, the record reveals that there is evidence\nof conduct by T—Anchor showing an intent not to terminate the contract but to continue in a\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Even after giving notice concerning forfeiture, T—Anchor accepted late\npayments of purchase price installments although Young failed to comply with its agreement to\nbring the delinquent payments to a current status or to vacate the motel. The findings requested\nby T—Anchor even if made would not, in the light of all the evidence, compel a conclusion of\nlaw by the trial court that the contract was forfeited and cancelled in October, 1973, as contended\nby T—Anchor. The trial court need not make findings of fact on mere evidentiary matters with\nrespect to the ultimate issue. Plaza Co. v. White, supra; Wade v. Taylor, supra. Points of error\nnumbers 16—22 are overruled.\n\n [9] With respect to points of error numbers 23—28 we believe that the requested findings of fact\non which they are grounded relate only to evidentiary matters not required to be included in the\ntrial court's findings of fact. The facts they seek to establish would show that Travarillo failed to\nmake various payments to T—Anchor prior to trial. Such facts, even if included in the trial court's\nfindings of fact, would not compel a result different from that reached by the trial court since there\nwas evidence that Travarillo made tender of performance to bring its contract obligations current\nearly in April, 1973, just prior to dissolution of the Young bankruptcy restraining order. Points of\nerror numbers 23—28 are overruled.\n\n\nThe testimony reveals that after this suit was filed and hearing had on temporary injunction,\nTravarillo attempted to put the motel under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court by filing for\nan arrangement under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act. By its points numbered 29—32, T—\nAnchor contends it was error for the trial court to fail to find that by this action, Travarillo, in\neffect, failed to do equity and effectively withdrew its tender of any sums to T—Anchor, resulting\nin the defeat of any right to prevent forfeiture.\n\nThe trial court made no findings of fact with respect to the Chapter XI proceeding initiated\nby Travarillo. There is much controversy *629 about the reasons for filing the petition for\narrangement under Chapter XI. T—Anchor insists that Travarillo sought to repeat the actions of\nYoung, and thus remain in possession of the motel without being required to make payments to\nT—Anchor. Travarillo insists, on the other hand, that by filing a bankruptcy petition it was only\n‘trying to litigate in every conceivable form’ to protect its rights. Travarillo contends that it wanted\nto use the Chapter XI proceeding ‘to get a court to make a determination that (it) had a right\nto cure because (it) had substantial equities' it was in danger of losing. Morgan Jones, a lawyer\nfor Travarillo, testified that it was upon his advice that the Chapter XI proceeding was initiated,\nasserting that insolvency is not presumed in a Chapter XI proceeding. The only evidence before\nus on the issue of solvency is that Travarillo was solvent.\n [10] [11] The purpose of Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act is to provide a quick and economical\nmeans of facilitating simple compositions among general creditors who have been deemed by\nCongress to need only the minimal disinterested protection provided by the Chapter.

Plaza Co. v. White,\nsupra; Wade v. Taylor, supra. Moreover, the evidentiary finding would not necessarily compel\na different conclusion by the trial court regarding such ultimate and vital issue of termination of\nthe contract.\n\n\nFurther, it is our opinion that the case of Smith v.

In that case the vendee pleaded defenses inconsistent\nwith his tender of the purchase money; the court held that the plea of limitation title precluded the\nadjustment of any equities in the vendee's favor that might allow him to pay the unpaid balance\nof the purchase money and hold the land. Id. at 930. The court stated in Smith v. Owens, supra,\nthere were no equities pleaded or proved that would entitle the vendee to defeat the remedy of\nrescission of the contract sought in that case.\n\nIn the instant case we have no pleading by Travarillo of any theory inconsistent with its tender\nof whatever amount the trial court determined to be owing. Further, in the instant case, we find\nevidence to support a judgment in favor of Travarillo upon equitable grounds. By way of cross-\naction Travarillo invoked the equity jurisdiction of the trial court to deny cancellation of the\ncontract.\n\nHere, Travarillo had paid into the registry of the trial court which, in turn, has paid to T—Anchor,\nan amount making Travarillo current in its obligations. The Chapter XI proceeding initiated\nby Travarillo was dismissed, with no change in possession resulting from the proceeding. T—\nAnchor's conduct with reference to the forfeiture that it claims occurred on October 11, 1973\nwas not consistent with such claim of forfeiture. By accepting late payments and by making a\nsubsequent agreement for cure of defects T—Anchor indicated that it continued to consider the\ncontract in force.

It is noted that the buyer in Stevenson made no tender of all or part of the contract\npayments until after suit in trespass to try title was filed. The buyer advised the seller that he would\nmake no further monthly payments, and the seller treated the contract as abandoned. Travarillo\nhas tendered performance to bring the contract obligations up to date before this suit was filed\nin April, 1974. In the instant case there is evidence that subsequent to the time when T—Anchor\ncontends it first declared a forfeiture, it treated the contract as continuing and not as abandoned.\nAlso, in Stevenson, the court significantly pointed out that the vendor's right of possession upon\ndefault could be defeated by the vendees ‘upon pleading and proving such facts as would make it\ninequitable to enforce it.’ In view of the equities pleaded and proved here, points of error numbers\n29—32 are overruled.\n\nWe recognize that this is a case that requires the weighing of competing equities and that the\nequities do not lie wholly in favor of either party.

After successor acquired lessee and the\nleases, owners amended petition by substituting successor as party and adding breach of contract\nclaim and request for a declaratory judgment seeking termination of the leases. The 271st District\nCourt, Wise County, John H. Fostel, J., granted successor's motion for summary judgment without\nspecifying the grounds, and dismissed the owners' action with prejudice.\n\n\n\nHoldings: The Court of Appeals, Gardner, J., held that:\n\n[1] letter from owners was an inadmissible settlement offer, and\n\n[2] owners were only entitled to damages, rather than forfeiture of oil and gas leases.\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\nTerrie Livingston, C.J., concurred and filed opinion.\n\n\n\n West Headnotes (16)\n\n\n [1]    Evidence         Offers of Compromise or Settlement\n        Letter from mineral rights owners to oil and gas lessee was an inadmissible “settlement\n        demand,” rather than a “demand letter” sufficient to trigger a forfeiture under the terms of\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(XTO) filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the Vinsons'\nclaims relating to ten oil and gas leases covering the Vinsons' ranch in Wise County, Texas. The\ntrial court granted XTO's motion and denied the Vinsons' motion. The Vinsons, as one or more of\nthe lessors in each of the leases, contend that they are entitled to terminate the leases with XTO, as\nsuccessor lessee, because XTO failed to make “undisputed payments” after demand. Because we\nhold that the Vinsons presented no evidence that they provided XTO with a proper written notice\nor demand for payment as required by the leases, we affirm.\n\n\n\n                                             II.

Threshold is a Vinson family\ncompany *347 in that the owners, officers, and directors are members of the Vinson family. In\n2003, Antero Resources Corporation bought Threshold's interests as lessee in the leases for $25\nmillion.\n\nIn early 2005, the Vinsons began disputing Antero's calculations of royalty payments to the\nVinsons from 2003 to 2005 and commenced an audit of Antero's accounting records of royalties.\nBy letter of January 25, 2005, the Vinsons informed Antero that they were “waiting on requested\ninformation to complete [the] audit of production and royalty payments” and that the Vinsons'\n“potential claim” for royalty underpayment was $2 million. In March 2005, the Vinsons provided\nAntero with audit exceptions listing, among other complaints, improper deductions from royalty\npayments for compression, fuel, treating, and transportation charges by an “affiliated” pipeline\nowned by Antero “to be determined” but “estimated ... to be in the range of $600,000.” 1\n\nThe relationship between the parties deteriorated as the Vinsons raised other issues, including\nclaims for reassignment of undeveloped acreage, drill site issues, and road and surface damage\nissues. On July 11, 2005, the Vinsons filed suit against Antero for numerous claims—including\ntrespass, breach of contract, incorrect calculation and underpayment of royalties and other\nproduction costs, surface damages, and failure to develop—seeking an unspecified amount of\ndamages and attorney fees.\n\nIn the meantime, two months before the Vinsons filed suit, XTO acquired Antero and the leases.\nXTO was made aware of the outstanding issues claimed by the Vinsons at the time it acquired\nthe leases. In March 2005, the Vinsons faxed XTO a copy of its January 25 letter to Antero\nregarding the status of their claims. By letter dated August 5, 2005, XTO's outside litigation\ncounsel initiated settlement dialogue with the Vinsons' counsel, requesting that the Vinsons (1)\namend their pleadings to substitute XTO as the sole defendant, (2) agree to suspend their ongoing\naudit during litigation, and (3) consider opening discussions with XTO “to see if some or all\nof these issues can be resolved, and good working relations restored, before pursuing litigation\naggressively.” 2\n\nIn a January 18, 2006 letter to the Vinsons' counsel, confirming delivery of documents in response\nto discovery, XTO's counsel reaffirmed its “intention to resolve the royalty payment issues both\nprospectively and [as] to past months, by an agreed method of changed payment and a lump sum\nsettlement for past months once the new payment method is agreed upon.” A few days later,\nXTO's and the Vinsons' accountants and legal counsel met to discuss settlement of all issues in\nthe suit, including the issue of the new methodology to be agreed upon in order to recalculate\nthe disputed royalties. Under the methodology proposed by XTO, its “estimated” preliminary\ncalculation of royalty payments owed to the Vinsons for the period from November 2003 through\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

XTO described this number as an estimate,\nsubject to adjustment as XTO continued reviewing Antero's boxes of accounting *348 records. 3\nThe Vinsons and XTO agreed at this meeting to continue working, without the presence of legal\ncounsel, on the changed methodology to recalculate the disputed royalty payments owed to the\nVinsons during both the Antero period and the period after May 2005, when XTO acquired Antero\n(the XTO period). In this regard, the parties obtained a Rule 408 Agreed Protective Order from\nthe trial court that included a provision for informal meetings of representatives of the parties to\ndiscuss royalty accounting issues. 4\n\nOn March 16, 2006, XTO's counsel wrote the Vinsons' counsel, summarizing the current status\nof the ongoing settlement discussions on all issues and proposing that XTO recalculate all prior\nroyalties under a revised methodology and format and “in due course, make a retroactive payment\nto bring all prior periods up to the new payment methodology.” The letter requested that the\nVinsons present a settlement demand “to resolve all issues in the case” as follows:\n\n            Please discuss these issues with your client and present XTO a settlement\n            demand to resolve all issues in the case. If we have misunderstood your pleading\n            in any respect, or if you would need to discuss any of these issues prior to\n            submitting a demand, please call me at your convenience.\n\nOn May 12, 2006, the Vinsons' counsel responded with a three-page letter faxed to XTO's counsel\n(the May 12 letter). The letter began with the following paragraph:\n\n   In response to your March 16, 2006, letter regarding possible settlement of this matter, [the\n   Vinsons have] been thoroughly engaged in reviewing all of the information available related\n   to this dispute. Now that this review is complete [the Vinsons are] prepared to respond in full\n   to your suggestion as to “what XTO might offer to attempt to resolve the rest of the claims in\n   the lawsuit.”\n\nIn the May 12 letter, the Vinsons' counsel characterized their claims as falling into two major\ncategories, summarized as “surface/lessor issues” and “working interest/reassignment issues,”\nwith four main causes of action. He discussed those issues in detail, including the following:\n\n   Royalty/Accounting Issues. If XTO makes a retroactive payment as represented, including\n   interest and attorney fees, and revises the format for making future payments then this issue\n   should be resolved. Until agreement on each of these matters is reached, in accordance with the\n   terms of [the Vinson] leases ... demand is hereby made for all undisputed payments due under\n   the Wise County leases. As a part of any *349 settlement of this issue XTO will also have to\n   confirm that it will provide [the Vinsons] with daily production information....\n\nThe letter concluded with the following paragraph:\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Recognizing the risks of\n            litigation and the costs associated therewith, I have been authorized to settle\n            all claims in exchange for a payment in the amount of $9,500,000 and XTO\n            bringing itself into compliance with the Barnett Shale Project Agreement\n            by signing JOA's correctly identifying Threshold's before and after payout\n            working interests after XTO acquired Sinclair Oil Corporation's interest in said\n            agreement, in the same manner as all previously executed JOA's.\n\nOn May 25, 2006, XTO paid the Vinsons the amount of $103,047.68, representing underpayments\nfor royalties owed for the XTO period, and using the new methodology that had been discussed. 5\nThe Vinsons accepted that payment. XTO then began using the new methodology to adjust the\nroyalty calculations previously made by Antero from the 348 boxes of accounting documents,\nwhich were incompatible with XTO's computer system, in order to calculate amounts to be paid\nfor the Antero period. 6\n\nSixty days after sending the May 12 letter, the Vinsons filed an amended petition substituting XTO\nas the defendant. In addition to the claims for damages previously asserted, the Vinsons alleged\nthat XTO was in breach of contract by failing to make “undisputed royalty payments” demanded\nby the Vinsons in the May 12 letter. By the new pleading, the Vinsons added a request for a\ndeclaratory judgment seeking termination of the leases under the following portion of Section 3\n(entitled “Royalty Payment”) of the leases: 7\n\n\n   3. Royalty Payment. Royalties on oil, gas, and other substances produced and saved hereunder\n   shall be paid by [XTO] to [the Vinsons] as follows: ...\n\n      e. ... If [XTO] wrongfully or unreasonably withholds any undisputed payment or payments\n      due to [the Vinsons] for a period of sixty (60) days after written demand for payment is made\n      by [the Vinsons] on [XTO at the above address (or such other address as may be specified in\n      writing hereafter by XTO) ], at the election of [the Vinsons] this lease may be terminated. The\n      foregoing sentence *350 shall not apply to payments withheld by [XTO] because [XTO]\n      contests such payments in good faith so long as [XTO] has timely paid to lessor all undisputed\n     payments due to [the Vinsons]. 8\nOn October 16, 2006, the Vinsons filed a partial motion for summary judgment asking the trial\ncourt to declare the leases terminated under Section 3(e) of the leases because of XTO's failure to\ncomply with the Vinsons' alleged May 12 demand that “all undisputed amounts” be paid within\nsixty days. 9\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

XTO made\nsubsequent payments of $16,972.79 and $2,380.82 to the Vinsons later in November 2006 as\nfurther adjustments for the underpaid amounts by Antero, as well as $150,000 in attorney's\nfees. After a hearing, the trial court denied the Vinsons' motion for partial summary judgment.\nEventually, the parties settled all other claims and issues, with the Vinsons reserving their right\nto pursue the lease forfeiture claim.\n\nXTO then filed a motion to exclude the May 12 letter under Texas Rule of Evidence 408, together\nwith a motion for no-evidence summary judgment. XTO's no-evidence summary judgment motion\nasserted that the Vinsons had no evidence\n\n   (1) that it fully and sufficiently described in writing the alleged breach or default and properly\n   notified XTO of the forfeiture to result from said breach;\n\n   (2) that undisputed royalty payments were due and owing under the Leases;\n\n   (3) that undisputed payments were withheld in bad faith; and\n\n   (4) that undisputed payments were wrongfully or unreasonably withheld.\n\nThe Vinsons responded to XTO's motion and also requested that the court reconsider their motion\nfor partial summary judgment. The trial court granted XTO's motions to exclude and for summary\njudgment without specifying the grounds relied on, denied the Vinsons' motion for reconsideration,\nand dismissed the Vinsons' case with prejudice.

First, they contend that the trial court erred by denying\ntheir motion for summary judgment and granting XTO's motion for summary judgment because\nthe Vinsons made written demand for payment of undisputed sums in the May 12 letter, XTO\nfailed to pay those sums within sixty days, and the leases expressly provide that they may be\nterminated if “undisputed” sums are not paid within sixty days of written demand. Second, the\nVinsons assert that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding from evidence the May 12\nletter, which they contend was their “written demand” pursuant to the terms of the leases. Third,\nthe Vinsons argue that the trial court erred by excusing XTO from complying with the leases and\nby *351 applying the doctrine of disproportionate forfeiture.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

XTO further asserts that the Vinsons were made whole by the payments they\naccepted, which foreclosed any election to sue for forfeiture of the leases.\n\n\n\n                                                IV. ANALYSIS\n\nAt the core of the Vinsons' appeal is their complaint that the trial court abused its discretion\nby excluding from evidence and refusing to consider the May 12 letter, which the Vinsons\ncharacterize as their “Demand Letter.” The Vinsons contend that the May 12 letter was admissible\nand was a proper written demand that met the requirements of Section 3(e) of the leases. We will\nfirst consider whether the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the May 12 letter from\nevidence.\n\n\nA. The May 12 Letter Was Not a “Demand Letter.”\n [1] The Vinsons argue that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the May 12 letter\nfrom evidence under Texas Rule of Evidence 408 as a compromise offer because the letter was\nnot a compromise settlement demand but was clearly a “Demand Letter” notifying XTO of its\nobligation to pay an amount that XTO knew it owed but was withholding until all issues could be\nresolved. The Vinsons point out that the letter contained wording from Section 3(e) of the leases\nmaking “demand ... for all undisputed payments due” and that it expressly referred to the Wise\nCounty leases, which was, according to the Vinsons, sufficient language to put XTO on notice that\nthe leases gave it sixty days to respond in order to defeat forfeiture of the leases. Thus, the Vinsons\nargue that the letter was admissible as evidence of a demand. XTO replies that the language of\nthe letter is couched as a global settlement demand offering to compromise all issues in the case\nfor a total specific amount (the only amount demanded in the letter); that the amount owed for\nroyalties was disputed; that if the Vinsons intended a demand for payment in the letter, it was not\nrecognized as such by XTO's forty-year veteran oil and gas litigation attorney; and that the alleged\ndemand was misleading and surreptitious with no specified amount to cure a default and did not\nspecify a time within which to pay but, instead, indicated it would remain open until settlement.\nThus, XTO argues the May 12 letter was properly excluded by the trial court.\n\n[2] Offers of settlement are not admissible to prove liability or invalidity of a claim or its amount.\nTex.R.

Only when the trial court abuses its discretion\nwill its ruling be disturbed on appeal. 10 See id.\n\nXTO contends that, when the “demand” language is properly viewed in the context of the\nremainder of the May 12 letter and the parties' ongoing negotiations, the letter was clearly a part of\nsettlement negotiations, not a demand for payment of undisputed amounts triggering forfeiture of\nthe leases if not paid. 11 XTO points out that the May 12 letter's first paragraph begins: “In response\nto your March 16, 2006, letter regarding possible settlement of this matter, ....” [Emphasis added.]\nMoreover, the very paragraph of the letter the Vinsons rely upon as setting forth the demand\nbegins by expressly acknowledging, immediately before the words they claim to be a demand\nfor payment, that a settlement had not been reached, stating: “Until agreement on each of these\nmatters is reached. ...” [Emphasis added.] Immediately following the demand language, that same\nparagraph references payment of such undisputed amounts as a part of a proposed settlement,\nstating that “[A]s a part of any settlement of this issue, XTO will also have to confirm” that it will\nprovide various production information in a timely manner. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThen, as XTO notes, the letter closes with a straightforward compromise settlement demand for\nthe entire case, stating that the Vinsons value the case at more than $30 million, but “[r]ecognizing\nthe risks of litigation and the costs associated therewith, I have been authorized to settle all claims\nin exchange for a payment in the amount of $9,500,000.” [Emphasis added.] The Vinsons deny\nthat the last paragraph of the letter was intended to constitute a settlement demand for all claims\n—including their claim for unpaid royalties—and insist that the letter made clear that the Vinsons'\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We disagree with\nthe Vinsons' post hoc interpretation. “All claims” necessarily includes the Vinsons' *353 claim\nfor unpaid royalties, which were sought in the pending litigation.\n\nThe May 12 letter speaks for itself. It begins with a discussion of settlement, states that it is in\nresponse to XTO's request for a settlement demand, clearly and unambiguously concludes with a\nsettlement demand for “all claims,” and was written during the parties' ongoing negotiations for\nsettlement of an existing lawsuit that included the Vinsons' claim for underpayment of royalties.\nThe May 12 letter also concludes by conceding a right to which the Vinsons believe they are\nentitled. See Mercedes–Benz, 720 S.W.2d at 857 (holding that an offer of compromise exists when\na party concedes some right to which he believes he is entitled to bring about a mutual settlement).\nSpecifically, the letter concludes with a valuation of “this case” greatly in excess of $30 million\nand an offer to settle “all claims” for $9.5 million. The language and context of the letter negate\nany reasonable interpretation of the language buried in the middle of a sentence, buried in the\nmiddle of a paragraph, and buried in the middle of the three-page letter as a stand-alone “demand”\nfor payment under Section 3(e) of the leases that can be considered separate and apart from the\nrest of the letter.\n\n [5] The purpose of rule 408 is to encourage settlement.

Insufficient Evidence Existed to Raise an Issue of Fact as to Notice and Demand to\nEntitle the Vinsons to Forfeiture of the Leases.\n [6] The Vinsons contend in their first issue that the trial court erred by denying their motion for\nsummary judgment and granting XTO's motion for summary judgment because the May 12 letter\nconstituted written demand for payment, XTO failed to pay those sums within sixty days, and the\nleases expressly provide that they may be terminated if “undisputed” sums are not paid within\nsixty days of written *354 demand. But even if the trial court erred by excluding the May 12\nletter from evidence as a demand, the Vinsons were only entitled to damages, not forfeiture of\nthe leases. Thus, the Vinsons have failed to show how the exclusion of the May 12 letter led to\nrendition of an improper judgment. See Tex.R.App. P. 44.1(a).\n\n [7] The promise to pay royalties is generally a covenant, 12 which will give rise only to a remedy\nof damages in absence of a specific clause allowing the option of termination of the lease upon\nthe lessee's failure to pay. Blackmon, 276 S.W.3d at 606 (citing Linton E. Barbee, The Lessor's\nRemedies for Nonpayment of Royalty, 45 Tex. L.Rev. 132, 159 (1966)). As XTO acknowledges,\nthe Vinson leases are among the “few” that contain a specific clause making non-payment of\nroyalties a condition subsequent, expressly permitting the Vinsons, as lessors, to elect to seek\nforfeiture of the lease. See Barbee, 45 Tex. L.Rev. at 159–60.\n\n [8] [9] Upon breach of a condition subsequent, the lessor must elect between seeking damages\nor forfeiture; the lease is not automatically terminated upon breach.

See 28 S.W.3d at\n764–65. We agree that Coastal is similar to this case but find it distinguishable in material respects.\n\nParagraph 3 of the Coastal leases, specifically regarding royalties and other payments for\nproduction, and similar to section 3(e) of the Vinsons' leases, provided:\n\n            Royalties and other payments for production shall be due and owing to Lessor\n            within 120 days from the date of first production.... If Lessee wrongfully or\n            unreasonably withholds any such payment or payments due to Lessor for a\n            period of thirty (30) days after written demand for payment is made by Lessor\n            on Lessee at the above address (or other such address as made by [sic] specified\n            in writing hereafter by Lessee), at the election of Lessor this lease may be\n            terminated.\n\nId. at 761–62.\n\nLitigation had been pending by the lessor against Coastal for several years for underpaid royalties\non several other leases, but not for the “E” or “F” lease. See id. at 761. Coastal, as lessee, failed\nto pay any royalties due on the F–6 well on its “F” lease by the 120th day after first production\nof gas from the well it drilled on that property. See id. at 762. Coastal suspended payment of any\nroyalties due on the F–6 well while it awaited return of a signed division order from the lessor.\nSee id. Without returning the division order, the lessor sent a written demand letter that read, in\ntoto, as follows:\n\n            Plaintiffs hereby make demand for all royalties due and owing pursuant to each\n            paragraph 3 of the (a.)

The Corpus Christi Court of Appeals affirmed a summary judgment for the lessor,\nholding that the written demand sufficed to invoke the right of the lessor to terminate, despite\nthe rule that oil and gas leases must be construed against forfeiture, 13 and despite the additional\nrule that the prerequisites of notice of forfeiture must be “literally complied with” 14 because the\nCoastal lease did not require the lessor to explain the particulars of the breach or to specify how\nthe lessee had defaulted and, thus, the lessor's global demand did “literally compl[y]” with the\nrequirement of written demand for *356 payment. Id. at 763–65. Coastal differs significantly\nfrom this case. First, the demand in Coastal was clearly a “written demand” as required by the\nlease, unlike the alleged demand here, which was contained within a letter offering to settle\nthe pending litigation. See id. at 762. Coastal clearly recognized the demand as such because it\nresponded and complained that the demand letter was inadequate. See id. Most significantly, the\nCorpus Christi court's holding in Coastal that the lessor “literally complied” with the forfeiture\nclause rests upon the absence of any language in that lease requiring the lessor to describe the\nbreach or specify the particulars of the default. See id. at 764. Holding that “literal compliance”\nwith the prerequisite of notice to forfeit did not require the lessor to identify the specifics of the\nbreach, the court of appeals noted in a footnote:\n\n\n   An example of a clause in a lease requiring the lessor to indicate the specifics of the breach is\n   found in 4 HOWARD R.

They offered no answer to the prerequisites of notice and\ncure under Section 11 of the leases in their opening brief except to assert that Sections 11 and\n3(e) involve “different circumstances.” For the first time in their reply brief, they argue that\nthey repeatedly made their complaints *357 known in writing in their audit exceptions provided\nto XTO as early as March 2005, and more than 60 days expired before they brought suit. But\nnone of those communications specified any amount due or gave XTO a time within which to\ncure the alleged default. For example, the Vinsons' audit exception with respect to the improper\ntransportation charges stated only that “the Dollar amount ... to be determined but is estimated ...\nto be in the range of $600,000.” And none of their communications claimed any amount to be\n“undisputed.” 15 Thus, even if the language in the May 12 letter was intended to constitute notice, it\nwas for an unspecified amount to be paid by an unspecified time for unspecified claims or charges,\nas to all of which XTO was left to guess.

However, by precluding initiation of\nlitigation until notice has been provided, the lease agreements effectively prevent the use of a\npleading to make a demand. Moreover, the Vinsons did not make a “demand” by their amended\npleading. Rather, they used XTO's alleged failure to pay within sixty days after May 12, 2006, as\nthe reason to assert their election to terminate.\n\nAs previously discussed, Section 11 of the leases precluded the Vinsons from “initiat[ing]\nlitigation” unless XTO had received “written notice fully describing the breach or default” and\nhad “fail[ed] to remedy the breach or default within” sixty days of receiving the notice.

Evid. 408.\n\nTexas Rule of Evidence 408 mandates exclusion of evidence of settlement offers unless offered for\nsome reason other than to establish liability. Id. Additionally, the burden is on the objecting party\nto show that the evidence was not offered for some other reason or purpose allowed by rule 408.\nSee In re Univar USA, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2106244\"><a href=\"/opinion/2106244/in-re-univar-usa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 182 (Tex.App.-Beaumont 2010, orig. proceeding).\nAnd courts have recognized the admission of some portions of settlement agreements if relevant\nfor proof of some other element than liability. Id.\n\nBecause the letter was written in response to XTO's request to provide such a “settlement demand,”\nthe Vinson demand letter must be read in context with that preceding request. Basically, XTO\nasks, “What will it take to settle all the various other/remaining claims [other than the accounting/\nroyalty issues] asserted in the Vinsons' latest pleading?” In other words, XTO's letter implies\nthat it believes they have basically resolved the accounting/royalty issues. And apparently, the\nMay 12, 2006 Vinson letter acknowledges this: “[T]his issue should be resolved.” However, that\nbelief is clearly contingent upon XTO's performance in accordance with the representations it had\nmade to the Vinsons regarding the accounting/royalty issues. Furthermore, the Vinsons follow this\nstatement with a clear demand for “all undisputed payments due under the Wise County leases.” As\nthe Vinsons point out, XTO admits that it has calculated and is ready to pay undisputed amounts,\namounts that necessarily can only be fully determined by XTO. Thus, I believe that this *361\nportion of the May 12, 2006 letter is a demand for payment of undisputed amounts, not evidence\nof a settlement offer, and that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding this portion of the\nVinsons' response under rule 408. This portion of the letter was admissible because it was offered\nfor “another purpose than validity of the claim.” Tex.R. Evid. 408.\n\nAs to the forfeiture issue, we are to construe oil and gas leases disfavoring forfeiture. See Coastal\nOil & Gas Corp. v.

If a lease states how to give notice of demand or forfeiture, such notice must comport with\nthe lease. Id. at 764.\n\nHere, the remaining question is whether this portion of the letter is a sufficient demand and whether\nit made clear that failure to perform within a certain time would result in the Vinsons exercising\ntheir forfeiture rights. I would agree with the majority as to the insufficiency of the forfeiture. The\naccounting/royalty demand portion gave no notice of a time limit within which to perform, which\nthe lease states can be no less than sixty days with prior written notice. Furthermore, and more\nimportantly, the last paragraph of the letter, which would have also had to have been admitted,\nincludes the value of the entire “case” and is an offer to settle “all claims.” Again, there is no\nnotice or mention of the possibility of forfeiture. And as XTO points out, the last paragraph refutes\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  20\n\fVinson Minerals, Ltd. v.

Thus, I believe, and would conclude, that the letter, although admissible in part, provided\ninsufficient notice of what performance was required and when and insufficient notice that the\nfailure to timely perform would result in the exercise of the election to forfeit the leases.\n\nBecause my analysis would result in the same affirmance of the trial court's granting of XTO's\nmotion for summary judgment, I join in the judgment of the court and concur only to set forth\nthese distinctions.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    In his affidavit, Threshold's CFO stated, “Although I was unable to calculate a precise figure at that time because I had not received\n        all documentation I had requested, I was able to arrive at the estimate within a matter of hours, and I noted it in the audit exceptions.”\n2       In the letter, XTO observed that “relations between Antero and [the Vinsons] had deteriorated to a point that discussions for a\n        reasonable resolution of some or all of the issues of the lawsuit became impossible.”\n3       Following XTO's acquisition of Antero, XTO received 348 boxes of Antero records. To establish the $643,548.19 estimate, XTO\n        “pieced together” information contained in 59 boxes from Antero labeled “accounting records.” However, at the time of this estimate,\n        XTO was finding numerous accounting records in the other 289 boxes. The document XTO provided to the Vinsons that contained\n        its estimate was titled “Preliminary Accounting Review” and included the following notation: “These are preliminary findings only.\n        All calculations are subject to further examination and revision by XTO Energy, Inc. Accounting personnel.”\n4       The last paragraph of the order, in part, states:\n              [The Vinsons] and [XTO] further agree that at certain times in this Lawsuit, it may be necessary for representatives of both [the\n              Vinsons] and [XTO] to meet in person or via telephone, without counsel for either [the Vinsons] or [XTO] present, to discuss\n              certain accounting issues raised in this Lawsuit. Such informal meetings ... shall be governed by Texas Rule of Evidence 408.\n5       Joni Van Meter, XTO's accounting representative, explained in her September 2007 deposition that she was able to calculate\n        applicable charges for gathering and transporting already in XTO's own computer system, to give them separate deduct codes, and\n        to flag royalties for each individual owner as being exempt from those deductions.\n6       The Vinsons dispute that the “methodology” issue had anything to do with the amounts they claim for underpaid royalties but had\n        to do with Antero's improper use of weighted averages and composite rates in calculating the royalties. According to the Vinsons,\n        royalties were not being calculated on the higher of the proceeds from sale of the gas or the market value but simply on the amount\n        realized, contrary to the leases, and XTO's proposal was to use an index price to simplify calculations. The Vinsons provide no\n        record references to support this proposition but contend that the changed methodology would have no effect on the “undisputed\n        amounts” at issue.\n7       The Vinsons' amended pleading attached a copy of the May 12 letter with all parts redacted except the single paragraph relied upon\n        by the Vinsons as their demand for payment. Only when this amended pleading was filed did XTO's counsel learn of the Vinsons'\n        interpretation of the May 12 letter as a “demand” that allegedly entitled them to termination of the leases.\n8       The Vinsons omitted the last sentence of Section 3(e) of the leases in their amended petition and in their opening brief in this Court.\n        Because we resolve this appeal on other grounds, we do not reach XTO's cross-point that the summary judgment may be upheld on\n        the ground, raised in its motion for summary judgment and not addressed by the Vinsons on appeal, that the Vinsons produced no\n        evidence that the payments were not contested by XTO in good faith.\n9       The Vinsons sought partial summary judgment because other claims were pending at the time the motion was filed.\n\n10      The abuse of discretion standard of review is limited to the trial court's determination to exclude the May 12 letter from evidence.\n        We review the trial court's summary judgment ruling de novo.

To the extent that both interpretations may be reasonable, we must adopt the\n       construction that avoids forfeiture. Coastal, 28 S.W.3d at 763; Wisdom, 154 S.W.2d at 334. We conclude that the term “undisputed”\n       as used in Section 3(e) of the leases requires a specific amount to be undisputed by both parties, which was never the case here.\n16     Because the summary judgment in favor of XTO may be upheld based upon no evidence of a sufficient demand, we need not\n       consider the Vinsons' third issue as to whether the trial court erred by excusing XTO's compliance and by applying the doctrine of\n       disproportionate forfeiture, nor need we consider XTO's alternative grounds raised in the trial court to sustain its summary judgment\n       based on no evidence that it “wrongfully or unreasonably” withheld undisputed payments or did not act in “good faith” in contesting\n       such payments under Section 3(e).
